  Outside the exam arena, Yun Suyi was chasing after Lone Bamboo. He left as soon as Han Sen started fighting.

“Brother Lone Bamboo, please wait!” Yun Suyi shouted as she chased after Lone Bamboo.

Lone Bamboo stopped, looked at Yun Suyi, and said, “Sister Suyi, what do you need?”

“Brother Lone Bamboo, who were you watching earlier?” Yun Suyi knew all about Lone Bamboo. There was no reason to beat around the bush.

“Why would this matter concern you?” Lone Bamboo frowned.

Yun Suyi quickly said, “Han Sen is my friend. Were you watching his fight?”

Lone Bamboo nodded. He had no reason to hide the fact. “It is because of him that I joined the exam. I do not want to be number one. I only wish to fight him.”

Yun Suyi had guessed that he had come here for Han Sen, but she didn’t expect this answer. It shocked her.

“Why…” Yun Suyi looked confused.

Han Sen was smart, but Lone Bamboo was even stronger. After seeing Han Sen’s power, she still believed Lone Bamboo was superior. This thought was inside the heads of everyone in Sky Palace. Han Sen could not change everyone’s expectations simply by performing well.

“It is because he activated the twelve buildings and five cities in White Jade Jing,” Lone Bamboo said, before he turned around.

“What?” Yun Suyi was shocked. In the history of Sky Palace, fewer than one hundred people had experienced what Lone Bamboo just claimed. And out of all the Earls in the exam, Lone Bamboo had been the only one to see all the buildings and cities.

Even Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang had only been able to spy the twelve buildings. They hadn’t seen a single one of the five cities.

After Han Sen beat Cool Jade, there were no more fights left for Han Sen that day. He would have to wait until the next day. He didn’t leave, though. He stayed to watch the fights.

There was a difference between the geno arts of the geno universe and the geno arts of the sanctuaries. Somehow, there seemed to be a thread connecting them. Sky Palace’s geno arts were very high tier. After watching the fights, Han Sen found himself learning a lot. He compared what he saw to what he had learned in the past.

Han Sen left the place when all the exams were over for the day.

Over the next few days, Han Sen did not encounter any strong enemies. Spell was so powerful that her pistols could beat everything she was put against. In no time at all, five Earl students were brought down.

It was a shame that not many of his enemies had much in the way of fame. As a result of this, his continued success drew little in the way of attention. But when people did pay attention to his fights, they were greatly interested in what sort of geno armament Spell was.

Aside from the first match that Lone Bamboo spectated, he did not return. Perhaps it was because Han Sen’s opponents were so inferior, he wouldn’t see much of anything regardless. Whatever the reason was, he did not come back.

And Lone Bamboo’s fights were fan meet-and-greets.

No one in Sky Palace had the courage to fight Lone Bamboo. There was only one that had the courage to fight him, but when Lone Bamboo pulled out his sword, he could only move a step before the Earl student conceded.

Han Sen watched that match, and he was shocked. Lone Bamboo was stronger than he thought.

“After all, he is the one that survived the nightmare,” Han Sen thought to himself.

If he wanted the position of first, to receive Under the Sky, he’d have to beat Lone Bamboo. There was no getting around that.

The next day would be the day when Han Sen was to fight Lone Bamboo. When he returned to Jade Island that evening, he went straight to studying Jadeskin. He didn’t worry about the fight the next day.

Han Sen’s level would not be affected by emotions. Win or lose, as long as he tried his hardest, that was enough. Worrying over the results was a waste of energy.

“Brother Han, are you here?” Yu Jing had arrived at Han Sen’s island.

“What is it?” Han Sen came out the door and saw Yu Jing riding his Jade Night Crane. It circled the sky above.

Seeing Han Sen come out, Yu Jing came down and landed with the bird. He walked before Han Sen with a look of great worry and said, “Brother Han, what are you going to do to prepare for tomorrow?”

“What should I be preparing?” Han Sen looked at him with confusion.

Yu Jing looked depressed hearing that, and he gave a wry smile. “You are going to fight Uncle Lone Bamboo. You know how strong he is! You should be getting prepared.”

“How so?” Han Sen asked, laughing.

“Such as taking some pills that can temporarily boost your power. Or perhaps even a treasure. The exams allow you to take drugs, and if you don’t have any, I have some very effective pills you might benefit from,” Yu Jing said, bringing out a few bottles. He placed them in front of Han Sen and said, “I can sell them to you for a cheap price.”

“I don’t have money.” Han Sen held his hands out to the sides, showing his empty palms.

“I can take an IOU,” Yu Jing said quickly.

“I don’t want to be in debt,” Han Sen said.

Yu Jing was angered by this, and he asked, “Do you want to win or not?”

“Yeah.” Han Sen nodded.

Yu Jing gritted his teeth and pulled out a bottle. He said, “This bottle belongs to the grandmaster elder in the sixth seat. It contains the fenghou pills he created. After you use them, they can make you as strong as a Marquise for a short time. The effects last one hour, and for the purpose of fighting Lone Bamboo, I can let you borrow them all.”

“Borrow? How? If I eat it, it’ll be gone,” Han Sen asked Yu Jing.

“You use them before the fight. If you win, you reimburse me for the pills,” Yu Jing said.

“What if I lose?” Han Sen smiled at Yu Jing.

“Then that is okay. You can pay me back slowly.” Yu Jing’s jaw was starting to ache.

“I want them, but never mind. I can’t pay you back if I lose.” Han Sen smiled.

“You…” Yu Jing was so angry. Yu Jing had never done anything that put him at a disadvantage before. He had received those pills from the grandmaster, and he treated them like a treasure. He wouldn’t use them willy-nilly. He kept them in a box, and no matter how much money he was offered, he wouldn’t sell them.

Now he wanted to give them to Han Sen, and Han Sen was declining. It made him furious.

If Han Sen lost the next day, he’d also go bankrupt. Thinking of that, Yu Jing had to suppress his anger. He squeezed the bottle into Han Sen’s hand and said, “Fine. You don’t have to pay me back. These are a gift. Use all your strength to fight, and try your best to win tomorrow.”

When Yu Jing spoke, he felt as if his heart was bleeding. His eyes were all red when he put the pills into Han Sen’s hand.

He knew that even if Han Sen did use the fenghou pills, there was a fine chance he wouldn’t win. But any chance was better than no chance. Yu Jing had to try everything he could to hold onto his money.

“If you really want to help, get me some Earl xenogeneic genes. I’ll pay you back for those,” Han Sen said, after a moment of thought.

“Sure. Which element do you need, and how many?” Yu Jing said quickly. If they’d give Han Sen a higher chance of winning, he’d do it. If he was going to go bankrupt anyway, he might as well risk it.

It does not matter. The more the merrier, but they do have to be Earl.” Han Sen smiled.
