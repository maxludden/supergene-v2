<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he was shaking with the sonic power and going
to fall apart.</p>
<p>Within a second, the buildings around them turned into sand. No
matter whether or not they were made of stone or metal, under the
super high-pitched shaking, they all turned into dust.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unable to dodge the scary attack that damaged
everything around.</p>
<p>Armor instantly showed up on Han Sen’s body. His Spell armor was
close to his body when it appeared. It broke the clothes Han Sen
had been wearing. Only the blue robe with a black stripe
remained.</p>
<p>After the Spell armor appeared, the spell on it flickered.
Forever Solid power covered Han Sen’s body. The super high-pitched
sonic power lost its effectiveness. It was unable to spread in his
body.</p>
<p>Now, the demon lady was present. Old Vulture and the eyeless big
beast were nearby as well. They surrounded Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, this is your last chance,” Auntie Mei coldly said as
she stared at Han Sen. “Give me back the holy spirit, and I can
allow you to leave this place unharmed.”</p>
<p>“Give me Littleflower, and you guys can have anything you want,”
Han Sen coldly said. “Otherwise, even if some god from the sky
came, I am still going to tear this holy palace down.”</p>
<p>“How dare you say that!” Old Vulture was furious. The black
smoke in his mouth was crazier. It suppressed the light of the
Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. It was headed toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are kind of a genius,” the demon lady said. “Not
many people can be like you and achieve so much in such a short
amount of time in this universe. I am impressed by your talents. It
is a shame that even though you are Littleflower’s father and your
genes are stable, in the future, you won’t be regarded as the
greatest. I suspect you already know that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Han Sen coldly said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“I will explain it to you. How about this? In the sanctuaries,
you get all of the creatures’ genes to use. It is to improve your
power. At the same time, when you absorb the genes of the
xenogeneics, it means the genes of your own body will receive a
flush and change. They will make your geno substance chains very
unstable. So, no matter how your genes evolve, they will still be
very unstable.”</p>
<p>“Littleflower is different. Although he has your genes, the
genes he has have already been modified. They became his basic
genes. Thus, the instability problem is gone. That means
Littleflower receives all your benefits and has none of your flaws.
He will be even greater than what you are right now. So, the
potential Littleflower has is what you don’t have.”</p>
<p>“So, what is your point?” Han Sen coldly asked. “It does not
matter how good my son is. He is my son. He is not some tool to be
used by Sacred.”</p>
<p>“We never thought of Littleflower as a tool,” the demon lady
seriously said. “He is our Little Master. He is the new Sacred
Leader.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at her with disdain. He coldly laughed and said,
“If Sacred Leader’s position is that prestigious, why has no one
else replaced him all these years? Why does it now have to be
Littleflower?”</p>
<p>“Fine. Let’s not talk about that. Take 10,000 steps backward.
Even if we let you go to the holy palace, you could not destroy
anything there because the holy palace is indestructible. If it
was, it would not have ended up fine after the huge fight.” The
demon lady paused and said, “You must believe us. Little Master is
the one that was chosen by God. He can liberate Sacred and become
the king of the universe. You are his father. You should be proud
of him. You should not stand in the way of his potential.”</p>
<p>“I am proud of Littleflower, but that is not because he is some
bullshit Sacred Leader. I am proud because he is my son.” Han Sen
mocked the demon lady.</p>
<p>Old Vulture continued spitting out black smoke while screaming,
“Stop talking crap with him and just kill him!”</p>
<p>The demon lady waved her hands. She looked at Han Sen and said,
“Believe it or not, I can tell you for sure that when you are in
the holy palace. You cannot do anything. Like the holy spirit you
stole, you took it because you could. It is worthless to you
because you cannot use it. The holy spirit is a geno armament
Sacred Leader created. Only the people with a holy body can use it.
It is useless for others to make use of it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the demon lady was telling the truth. Although he
had taken the Holy Kirin’s holy spirit, he could not summon the
Holy Kirin out like an ordinary beast soul for a geno armament.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt that the Holy Kirin had no intention of fighting
him. For some reason, there was a gap. Even if the Holy Kirin was
willing to be used, Han Sen could not use it. Their powers were not
compatible.</p>
<p>For example, it was like the voltages of two currents did not
match. It was like a machine that required four volts to work, but
Han Sen could only provide 22. Thus, he was not able to start up
the machine.</p>
<p>The reason Han Sen did not use the holy spirit was that he was
unable to activate the Holy Kirin. He could not use it as a geno
armament.</p>
<p>The demon lady saw Han Sen’s face keep twitching. She said,
“Plus, you are Littleflower’s father. You would not steal his
stuff, would you? It belongs to him, and it will be with to him
sooner or later. Why must you be so stubborn? We just want to treat
Littleflower nicely. Why do we have to fight? Don’t you think this
is going too far?”</p>
<p>Old Vulture’s black smoke almost touched the Shield of the
Medusa’s Gaze. Han Sen felt the power of the black smoke had left.
He suddenly felt a strange power. It was like a very small vortex
was consuming all of the life forces around. Han Sen’s skin felt a
chill.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face did not change. He watched the demon lady, Auntie
Mei, approach him and said, “What you said really makes sense. If
everyone is good to Littleflower, we should let Littleflower be
returned to his father. A son being with his father is normal,
isn’t it? If you guys want to see him? You can see him if
Littleflower wants to see you.”</p>
<p>“Silly and clumsy.” The demon lady was angry. After all that,
Han Sen was still not taking it soft or hard. She had lost her
patience.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and replied, “Ha! Ha! You stole my son, yet you
call me silly and clumsy. It is no wonder Sacred was the first
faction in the universe. It was very overbearing.”</p>
<p>“If you insist, then we have to be like that,” the demon lady
said. “You cannot blame us. Auntie Mei took out a hairpin and
pointed it at Han Sen.</p>
<p>A dot of starlight appeared. It was headed for Han Sen’s
eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Why are you wasting time talking to him?” the eyeless big beast
quietly asked. His body was as big as a boar, but it was now
expanding. Some vessels that looked like chimneys had formed on his
back.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>The sounds of honking cars could be heard from the vessels. A
scary shockwave was released. It was all headed for Han Sen.</p>
