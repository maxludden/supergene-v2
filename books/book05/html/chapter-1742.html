<h2>Evolving Again</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1742</h3>

<p>Bao’er’s small body was in the air. The gold dot on her forehead
began to spread, dyeing the entirety of her little body gold. She
looked like a small sun.</p>
<p>The golden light had so much energy, Han Sen bathed in its glow.
He felt as if he was back inside his mother, swimming in the
lifeforce.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra,
absorbing as much of Bao’er’s lifeforce as he could.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra required more energy than any of Han Sen’s
other skills. It was different from the Dongxuan Sutra and The
Story of Genes. It was not destructive, but it had the strongest
lifeforce.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra was pushed to the max amidst this energy.
His blood started to boil, as if his life was suddenly ignited. His
blood became a fire, rushing through the construct of his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very happy. With the help of that lifeforce, his
Blood-Pulse Sutra was going to break through. His blood, bones, and
cells were refined by this fireblood. A red substance was
released.</p>
<p>This red substance covered Han Sen’s entire body, and it kept
twisting and turning, until it formed into a red battle armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already generated his Spell geno armor, so he knew
to run his Blood-Pulse Sutra and help generate the armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s success in generating the red geno armor made him feel
as if he had a layer of bones. It was a part of his body, like the
Spell geno armor, and he could control it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was getting used to the new armor, but it suddenly
changed again from armor mode.</p>
<p>“A second evolution?” Han Sen was so happy, so he kept on
running his Blood-Pulse Sutra while he waited for the change. Now
Han Sen could see what geno armament he would receive as a
Noble.</p>
<p>The geno armor melted into Han Sen, becoming his blood. Just as
Han Sen thought it would become a geno weapon, it went inside
him.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic?” Han Sen’s face changed. Things seemed to be
turning out a way he had not expected.</p>
<p>There were two directions that things could go in a person’s
second evolution. One was to generate a geno weapon, and the other
was for him to end up mutating and becoming a xenogeneic
himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen was currently undergoing his second evolution—that was
his situation right now. The geno armor was combining with his body
to prompt a mutation.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to be a xenogeneic, as it couldn’t be
reversed. It was comparable to the human body, which could not
become younger. So, he had no choice but to watch it happen.</p>
<p>“Am I going to become one of those monsters?” Han Sen felt a
chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen two xenogeneics before. They weren’t just
creatures; they were killing machines. Han Sen did not know if they
were all like that, but whatever the case might have been, he
didn’t want to end up like one.</p>
<p>The red liquid from the geno armor blended into Han Sen, going
into his blood vessels and becoming one with his blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood began to boil, and inside the red liquid, it
exploded. Han Sen’s blood was detonating inside the vessels,
causing him severe pain. It was like he was becoming powder.</p>
<p>Blood was everywhere, and so Han Sen felt the pain everywhere,
too. The mutation was more painful than getting kicked in the
balls, or delivering a baby. Han Sen couldn’t help but scream.</p>
<p>The vessels had endured too many changes, and it made the
smaller vessels twist and writhe like snakes.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood vessels were sticking out, like snakes curled
around his bones. His body was red, making him look like a muscle
monster.</p>
<p>The blood mutation continued, and his other body parts were soon
affected. Although they didn’t change as dramatically as his blood,
his fitness was given a jump.</p>
<p>Han Sen was glad he was still awake right now, though, and he
didn’t feel an urge to kill. He hadn’t lost control of who he was,
but being awake meant the pain was more excruciating.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the mutation. But Han Sen’s Nine-Life Cat tattoo
suddenly lit up, emitting a red light.</p>
<p>As the mutation went on, the red on the tattoo went into the
blood, combining with the mutation.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if that was good or bad, but his blood’s
mutation was now crazier and more painful than ever.</p>
<p>Roar! Han Sen opened his mouth and screamed, then fainted with
the pain.</p>
<p>But after passing out, the pain roused him to wakefulness again.
Then the sheer pain knocked him out and woke him again in a cycle.
Han Sen felt as if his brain and bones were exploding, but his body
wasn’t actually being destroyed.</p>
<p>Han Sen, despite having a strong will and wanting to live,
wished his body would just blow up and be done with it.</p>
<p>God knew how long it took for the pain to finally subside. He
was like mud, lying on the floor now. He felt numb and
powerless.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know when the pain left him. But after a while,
his will rejoined his body and formed a reaction.</p>
<p>Han Sen could only barely see Bao’er in front of him, looking
very worried. She stroked his cheek and hair, telling him
something. “Dad! Dad!”</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to open his eyes to stay awake. He heard a voice,
which was very familiar. It was Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Bao’er…” Han Sen wanted to speak, but his throat hurt, as if he
had swallowed a grinder. He sounded rougher than an eighty-year-old
smoker.</p>
<p>As time passed, Han Sen’s body recovered. He eventually regained
some proper wakefulness. His body was covered with countless
lesions, as if someone had cut him a thousand times.</p>
<p>But it was strange. He wasn’t bleeding. There was not a drop of
blood, and when you looked into the exposed wounds, you could see
fat like jade.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked inside his body and was shocked.</p>
