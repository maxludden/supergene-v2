	<p>Hearing that Qin Bai had been playing checkers for two days in the Feng family castle, without his ass leaving
		the chair once to touch the sword, Jia Shi Zhen was extremely worried.</p>

	<p>Other kingdoms had many inheritors. There was always a choice in who succeeded the throne. The Qin Kingdom only
		had one crown prince. He was sure to be the next one wearing the crown. If Qin Bai continued his ridiculous
		behavior, the Qin Kingdom’s lofty position would likely fall.</p>

	<p>“A bad officer is able to destroy a kingdom.” Jia Shi Zhen kept thinking about that phrase. The officers always
		spoke those nine words.</p>

	<p>After she returned to the Qin Kingdom, those nine words were what Jia Shi Zhen heard the most. Every time she
		heard them, it seemed to be connected to Han Sen-another two words she frequently heard.</p>

	<p>In the beginning, Jia Shi Zhen had the attitude to not totally trust those words. She did not believe them. After
		this experience, she was starting to believe that Han Sen was a bad influence. He was a very bad influence.</p>

	<p>“I want to see this reckless nobody and what he is doing to trick Mister Crown Prince.” Jia Shi Zhen decided to
		go to Feng Castle. She wanted to meet the very famous bad influencer.</p>

	<p>Han Sen returned to Feng Castle and saw Bao’er playing games with Qin Bai. Bao’er seemed happy, but Qin Bai did
		not look to be faring as well.</p>

	<p>Feng Yin Yin was watching their engagement with interest. In fact, during the past two days, she and Bao’er had
		been playing games with Qin Bai. She had just learned checkers, so she was really interested in it. She thought
		Qin Bai was like her, which was why she gave up her rest time to play checkers with them.</p>

	<p>Only God knew that Qin Bai now hated playing chess. For as long as he lived, he never wanted to play another game
		of chess. He believed he would throw up the next time he heard someone even mention the checkers.</p>

	<p>Upon seeing a shadow in the garden, Qin Bai looked at Han Sen as if he was asking for help. That look was worse
		than that of a sheep going to be slaughtered.</p>

	<p>Han Sen pretended as if he did not know anything. He walked up to Qin Bai and asked, “Crown Prince, are you
		having fun with Bao’er?”</p>

	<p>Qin Bai felt relieved to gain his freedom. He fell out of the chair.</p>

	<p>Han Sen immediately picked him up and shockingly asked, “Crown Prince, are you okay?” Qin Bai felt as if he was
		so angry that he could explode. He was going to yell at Han Sen. When he saw Bao’er, he felt more fear than
		anger. He madly whispered to Han Sen, “Han Sen, I treat you like a friend. I treat you nicely. How could you do
		this to me?”</p>

	<p>“Mister Crown Prince, what are you talking about? Why would I want to harm you?” Han Sen looked at Qin Bai and
		spoke with a tone of shock.</p>

	<p>“You didn’t bring me harm, but why is she treating me like this?” Qin Bai looked at Bao’er and sounded weaker.
	</p>

	<p>He was scared of quite a few people, including Jia Shi Zhen, but even she didn’t make him this scared. Jia Shi
		Zhen was now viewed as being much nicer when compared to Bao’er. The girl’s pretty face now looked demonic in
		his eyes.</p>

	<p>Han Sen seemed to understand. “I thought you wanted to practice with the sword. Bao’er is here teaching you the
		ways of the sword. Is she not? How has she harmed you?”</p>

	<p>“She…” Qin Bai suddenly did not know what to say.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not wait for him to formulate a proper response before asking, “Have you been playing chess games
		with Bao’er?” “We have been playing games of chess for two days and two nights.” Qin Bai loudly chomped his own
		teeth.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not wait for him to speak. He looked at Qin Bai with shock and said, “Crown Prince, you really are a
		man with a mind like steel. It is no wonder you are the Qin Kingdom’s crown prince. You will be the greatest
		leader. You’ll be a leader that can conquer the world. A normal person’s will is weak. To play a game of chess
		against Bao’er, they would break. Yet you have been playing against Bao’er for two days and two nights. You are
		strong. You are very strong. I have never admired anyone before, but I have to admire you, Crown Prince.”</p>

	<p>Qin Bai was frozen. He was just a child who loved goofing around. He did not think that sounded right. Seeing Han
		Sen’s shocked face, Qin Bai at least thought it was rather surprising</p>

	<p>“Cough. Cough. It was nothing. It was just a few rounds of chess. To a crown prince, it is not much of a feat.”
		Based on the way he was now speaking, Qin Bai seemed to enjoy the praise.</p>

	<p>“Bao’er, did I not tell you to allow him to rest? Why do you keep playing chess games with the crown prince? You
		are so rude.” Han Sen looked cold as he told off Bao’er.</p>

	<p>Bao’er looked innocent as she said, “I planned on that, but the crown prince wanted to play 300 rounds with me.
		He is the crown prince. Why would I disobey his wishes? How could you take this out on me?”</p>

	<p>Bao’er’s face looked as if she had been wronged. Even Crown Prince Qin Bai felt sorry for her.</p>

	<p>After thinking about it, he had said something like that to Bao’er. He really wanted to slap his mouth. If he had
		known this would happen, he would not have said something so brash.</p>

	<p>“I will punish you this time so you will not be so ignorant. You could run into trouble someday.” Han Sen looked
		glum. It was as if he was ready to really teach Bao’er a lesson, but he gave her a subtle wink.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s hand had yet to touch her when Bao’er started crying. She was crying as she said, “Crown Prince made me
		do this. Why don’t you punish him instead of me?” “It is fine. It is fine. It was me that did not clarify
		things. Please, do not punish Bao’er.” Qin Bai felt really guilty as he spoke.</p>

	<p>“Go and thank the crown prince. Don’t do it again after that. Do you hear me?” Han Sen let Bao’er go.</p>

	<p>“I am so sorry, Crown Prince. Next time, when you play a game of chess against me, I will let you rest after 10
		rounds.” Bao’er made a promise.</p>

	<p>When Qin Bai heard that, his legs felt soft. He was shocked. He fell to the ground and shook his head. “No more
		games. No more games. I will never play chess again.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought it was funny. He wanted to say something, but someone suddenly made a declaration from outside
		the garden. “Mister Han, Teacher Jia wants to see you.”</p>

	<p>After the person said that, a woman with a cold-looking face walked in. Qin Bai saw the woman. His body started
		to tremble. He immediately bowed to her and said, “Qin Bai greets Teacher Jia.”</p>

	<p>“You are welcome, Crown Prince.” When Jia Shi Zhen spoke, she did not look at Qin Bai. She looked at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>He was different from the figure she had often heard about. There were no legends about his remarkable sharp
		mouth and monkey throat. He looked like a handsome man. His face was very sharp. It was hard to tell his age.
		Judging from his looks, he looked like he was in his twenties.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen was not someone who determined a person’s character via their appearance. Her thoughts of Han Sen
		did not change because of the way he looked.</p>

	<p>“Mister Crown Prince, what are you doing here?” Jia Shi Zhen did not speak to Han Sen. To her, Han Sen was just a
		rankless, albeit loved, officer. Talking to him made her mouth feel dirty.</p>
