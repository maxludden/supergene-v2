    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The rubberized spear collided with the umbrella. Han Sen had hoped for it
      to be a flaccid hit, but the power of the spear was too great, and it
      managed to maintain some of its hardness. When it struck Han Sen, he was
      still knocked back a good distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thrown back through the air, heading in the direction of a rocky
      surface. But fortunately, there was a definite reduction in the damage
      that last hit had dealt him. It did not make him any worse for wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Han Sen was in the air, he brought out his crystal egg again, and
      then he lobbed it at the wall he was on a crash course towards. When the
      egg hit the wall, it pinged back to Han Sen’s hand. Where it had struck
      was now as soft as a cushion, ready to catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall was like a sponge, and he was able to walk away from it without
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaped forward, knowing Nan Litian would be on him like a hound on a
      pork chop. He raised his umbrella and aimed it at his nemesis’s face. Nan
      Litian put away his softened spear and instead brought out a green sword.
      With it, he performed an upwards slash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his crystal egg and threw it once more. The egg was not
      thrown on a distinct, clearly defined trajectory, and it just flew around
      in the air like a crazed firefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It eventually came to a stop in front of Nan Litian, and the moment he
      tried to grab it, the egg pierced through his hand like a bullet. It
      almost managed to reach his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a bell appeared. It covered the egg and then dropped to the
      ground like a pillar of firm stone. Han Sen could hear his egg bouncing
      around inside the bell, and swiftly knew there was no chance of the egg
      getting itself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bad thing about the egg was that it could not break things. It had no
      real strength of its own, so now, trapped in an enclosed space, it could
      do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian struck against the umbrella another three times until it was
      knocked free from Han Sen’s strained grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go to hell!” Nan Litian screamed, as he tightened his clutch on the sword
      he wielded and brought it down towards Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>Seeing the green sword descend, Han Sen couldn’t help but smile.</p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian thought Han Sen was either slightly deluded or just flat-out
      crazy. He firmly believed he was about to end the pest and slice him in
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, Nan Litian felt a pain in his eye. He blinked, and a second
      later, Han Sen was gone. He had dodged the strike, and then, he noticed he
      was grabbing a hold of his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian roared in fury, moved away, and then used his fist to punch at
      Han Sen, who was in the process of delivering a palm-strike of his own.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian’s fist and Han Sen’s palm collided, but no shockwave was
      generated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s fingers were inside his fist, but strangely, no blood came out.
    </p>
    <p>Buzz!</p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian’s body twitched. He tried to scream, but something jammed the
      noise in his throat, and no sound was made. After a pause of silence, he
      coughed up a torrent of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian was in immense pain, as if the entirety of his being was being
      pulled apart. It was like he was suffering a charlie horse with each and
      every muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pain continued to increase until he could no longer remain composed
      and hold it together. He was losing control, thrashing about like he was
      suffering a violent seizure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised to see Super Spank fail to break Nan Litian’s
      sequence structure. It was obvious Nan Litian was just too strong compared
      to Han Sen. But while he may not have been able to annihilate the man, the
      attack had at least delivered an insufferable amount of hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sequence structure had most certainly been damaged somewhat, and Han
      Sen knew he’d just have to pull harder if he wanted the rest of his enemy
      to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Han Sen was about to do the same thing again, Nan Litian switched
      to the defensive and summoned a shield.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>But Han Sen’s palm shattered the shield with no trouble.</p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian was in agony and shock, but still, the prevailing emotion was
      anger. His bloodlust for Han Sen was only heightening. With the green
      sword still in-hand, he flailed it around aimlessly in the hopes of
      striking Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the difference in fitness, Han Sen could not efficiently keep up
      and dodge Nan Litian’s blisteringly speedy strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly, Han Sen raised his umbrella to block the attacks that were coming
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an opportunity presenting itself, Han Sen ducked to the side, down
      where the bell lay. He shattered it and took his egg back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without stopping, Han Sen took off in the direction of Hidden Valley once
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian followed after him, but kept his distance. From behind, he
      fired out gusts of power at Han Sen as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Han Sen was able to keep using his umbrella, it didn’t deflect all
      the incoming damage. He still had to suffer more and more pain while he
      was on the run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Nan Litian was not able to keep up too well, following the
      agony he had been in. He slowly fell behind until Han Sen was out of
      sight, having undoubtedly escaped into the Hidden Valley he had been so
      desperately trying to get to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian continued after him, though. He could tell where he was going,
      and slaying Han Sen was his number one goal right then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hidden Valley was a large, sprawling valley, but it was knotted, twisted,
      thorned, and tangled by a variety of different geno plants. The trees
      there were enormous, and thick, creepy vines wreathed their way up and
      around each gigantic trunk like tinsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      After entering the valley, not even the sun could penetrate that expanse.
      In the denseness of that place, Han Sen felt as if he was treading through
      a green cave.
