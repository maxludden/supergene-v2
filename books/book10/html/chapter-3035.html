<p>One punch. Han Sen felt as if he had just enjoyed a nice sleep.
He felt so good that he almost groaned.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes. What he saw in front of him gave him a
shock. He wasn’t able to figure out what had happened to him in the
space of a second.</p>
<p>Han Sen only remembered the black crystal armor dragging him
into a reverse tunnel. He had kept falling and falling until he
lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he was done for. It seemed as if the black
crystal armor was content to kill him, but that wasn’t what
happened. It was like he had just slept.</p>
<p>When he woke up. Han Sen noticed he was naked and curled up in
the remnants of a broken eggshell. Wan’er was missing, and a
middle-aged man was standing in front of him. He was staring at his
body with a greedy look in his eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head was flashing with a few words: horny, gay, and
glasses. Han Sen looked at the middle-aged man with his wriggling
fingers who was approaching him in a rush. He was mumbling, “You
are mine. You are mine.”</p>
<p>“Go to hell, you pervert.” Han Sen thought but did not say
anything. He swung a punch toward the middle-aged man. The
middle-aged man saw Han Sen wave a punch. He did not notice his
face looked even more excited as he said, “Humanoid gene race. A
very rare humanoid gene race. I wonder what element it is. The
legends claim King Qin’s gene egg was a time and space element. If
this is a time and space humanoid gene race, after growing him, he
can take a god temple and create his own kingdom. This would be
possible.”</p>
<p>“Be careful, Mister Meng. Something is wrong here…” Mister Yang,
who was nearby, looked weird as he tried to caution the other
man.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. Do you think I cannot claim a humanoid gene race
that was freshly born?” Mister Meng did not care for Mister Yang’s
words of caution. He felt no power from Han Sen’s punch. He had
just been born, so the gene race could not do anything to him.
Mister Meng thought, “No matter what, let’s just claim him first.
We can then teach him. Humanoid gene race people are very precious.
We cannot allow this news to leak. I cannot keep Mister Yang.” He
suddenly pushed out some power and reached out his hand to block
Han Sen’s punch.</p>
<p>Mister Meng’s body expanded. He had weird features. His head had
cow horns, and his body had black hair like steel. His body was
becoming very strong. Some very powerful presence emerged from him.
When his hand touched Han Sen’s fist, Mister Meng’s face suddenly
changed. He did not have a chance to fight back. Mister Meng’s hand
was perforated by the fist. The fist proceeded to strike his chest
and blast his body away. He hit a stone wall, exploded, and became
a smear of blood across the wall.</p>
<p>Mister Yang’s mouth opened wide. He was frozen upon seeing
Mister Meng become a bloodstain. He could not believe it.</p>
<p>He knew he had sensed something wrong, but he did not suspect
something as awry as this would happen.</p>
<p>It did not matter how high the level of a gene race was, it
would not be as strong as this upon their birth. Although
high-class gene race babies were stronger, there were not strong
enough to turn Mister Meng’s body into a smear with one punch.</p>
<p>Mister Meng was an elite who was at a very high level in Ancient
God City. Even if he had not used a gene race, with his blood’s
power, he would have been better than most humans. A gene race that
was just born would not be so easily killed by one measly
punch.</p>
<p>Mister Yang was certain that if he told others this story, no
one would believe him.</p>
<p>“How could he be so weak?” Han Sen looked at his fists with
surprise.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not meant to murder someone. He thought that the
middle-aged man looked quite strong, but he was so weak and could
not endure one small punch.</p>
<p>In fact, that was a very small punch for Han Sen. When Han Sen
punched, he cast a geno art. He wanted to use the geno art’s power
to trap the man so he could obtain information to figure out what
was going on.</p>
<p>Who would have known that once he used a geno art, he would feel
some scary pressure land on him? It forced him to suppress his
power. He erased the geno art’s power and weakened the punch
considerably. It was like punching water. The resistance was very
extreme.</p>
<p>Yet, a punch like that still blew up the middle-aged man that
looked strong. Han Sen was not afraid of murdering people, but he
was afraid of murdering good people. Thus, he wanted to ask
questions first. Unfortunately, things had already ended up this
way. He felt kind of bad. He looked at Mister Yang, who was
nearby.</p>
<p>Mister Yang was feeling the willies. Earlier, Han Sen had killed
Mister Meng with a punch. The scary scene had his guts in turmoil.
Now, Han Sen was calmly looking at him. It was scarier than being
looked at by a demon king. Mister Yang’s legs went soft. He laid on
the floor. His pants were wet.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He wanted to cast the Dongxuan Sutra to look at
the man. Right when he cast his Dongxuan Sutra, he felt the scary
pressure that suppressed the sky and ground land on him. He could
hardly stand it. It was like a mountain crushing him. He could not
use geno arts.</p>
<p>After Han Sen canceled the geno art, the weird suppression that
crushed the sky and ground was gone.</p>
<p>“Does that mean… Have I come to another world?” Han Sen was no
stranger to that feeling. When he used blue blood power, his body
was destroyed by the rules of the universe. But it was never that
strong.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried it a few more times and discovered that his guess
was right. This world’s power was repelling him, but not repelling
him entirely. If he did not use a geno art or use a power that was
too much, the world would not repel his body. He felt nothing when
he was not doing anything.</p>
<p>“Now I understand. This should be the world Qin Xue was born in.
My body has some of Qin Xue’s genes, so I am not being repelled. In
this world, the geno arts of the universe are repelled. My
situation is like Qin Xue going to the universe.” Han Sen quickly
learned what was going on.</p>
<p>He had been afraid that the world Qin Xue came from had many
powerful creatures, so this discovery made him happy. It did not
look like that was the case. At least, the two men in front of him
were very weak. They could not stand a chance.</p>
<p>“If Qin Xue was able to enter the universe, I should be able to
get back there. The most important thing is to find out what is
going on in this world. Perhaps then I can find something out about
Qin Xue.” Han Sen looked at Mister Yang, who was shaking on the
ground.</p>
