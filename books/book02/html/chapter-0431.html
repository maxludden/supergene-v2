    <p>
      Gradually, Han Sen felt that it was not because Lu Bin did not have the
      intention to kill, but because Lu Bin’s intention to kill was too strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there was one lamp in a room, then it would be easy to tell where the
      light was from. However, if the room was filled with lamps, there was
      little point in figuring out the source of the light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because Lu Bin’s intention to kill was off the chart, his opponent could
      no longer discern his intention, because it was everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Han Sen was trying to figure out the source of Lu Bin’s
      intention to kill, but he soon gave up. Under such scorching murderous
      intent, there was no point to figure out anything, because it would not
      make a difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      When fighting someone like this, there was only one way to win—may the
      brave one live.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen no longer stepped back, but made a kick himself, his leg hitting
      Lu Bin’s and making a loud sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lu Bin’s leg skills were practical, which meant the skills not that
      unusual. Having learned Panorama which was an encyclopedia of all kinds of
      commonly seen skills, Han Sen felt it was easy to mimic Lu Bin’s Killer
      Kicks. In fact, many people could easily imitate the skills, but the true
      difficulty was how to use it well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on one’s capability and mentality, the same leg skills were
      different when used by different people. It was especially true when it
      came to these kicks that were designed for life-and-death battles. Small
      difference could realize in completely different result.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was someone who knew the intention to kill very well. In fact, it
      was what he started out with. The only thing he needed to do different was
      that unlike the past when he needed to hide his inventions, he should fill
      himself with such intentions in this fight.
    </p>

    <p>Boom boom boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Lu Bin became almost the same person standing opposite each
      other. Kicking at each other in madness, they were making sounds that gave
      people goosebumps. Although the audience knew it was a simulated fight,
      they were still afraid that the two fighters’ bones might be broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is it. Hiding back is not a soldier’s way,&#8221; Lu Bin
      yelled in excitement, his legs kicking again as swiftly as wind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was also extremely excited. Lu Bin’s style was so aggressive that
      Han Sen also wanted to get it all out under his influence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Killer Kicks against Killer Kicks. Although only two persons were
      fighting, the audience felt there were two troops present, making them
      thrilled and terrified at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few fainthearted girls could not help yelping, forgetting it was a
      simulated fight.
    </p>

    <p>Kill kill kill kill kill!</p>

    <p>
      The long legs went up and down like blades, making sounds like metal.
      Every exchange made the heart of the audience tremble. It was hard to
      imagine that it was just a simulated fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Killer Kicks… He is also using Killer Kicks…&#8221; Wang Daqing
      finally realized that and could not help exclaiming.
    </p>

    <p>
      Others suddenly realized Wang Daqing was right. A Soldier On Warship was
      also using Killer Kicks. He was able to use Killer Kicks in front of Lu
      Bin and did not seem to fall short.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone suddenly had a weird expression on their faces, watching the two
      going at each other like lunatics.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who is A Soldier On Warship? Is he also a veteran?&#8221; Everyone
      suddenly had such a doubt. They could not imagine what kind of person you
      must be to use Killer Kicks as well as Lu Bin.
    </p>

    <p>If he was not a veteran, how could he use Killer Kicks that well?</p>

    <p>
      Qian Hezhen was dumbfounded. He just understood that Lu Bin was right. A
      Soldier On Warship was much stronger than him in fitness. Just now when
      they were fighting, A Soldier On Warship did not use all he got at all,
      but was trying to suppress his strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How is that possible? How long has it been? How could he have
      improved his fitness by so much?&#8221; Qian Hezhen looked at Han Sen,
      feeling complicated.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill!&#8221; Lu Bin suddenly roared and jumped up, his leg hitting
      at Han Sen like an axe.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Seven Kill!&#8221; Wang Daqings eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

    <p>
      The majority of Killer Kicks was common skills, so the focus was on
      mentality rather than techniques. Only seven kicks of Killer Kicks were
      exceptions, which were called &#8220;Seven Kill&#8221; by Lu Bin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The seven kicks were let the last moves in Killer Kicks. One must jump in
      the air to make seven consecutive high kicks from above. It was so
      difficult that it was even rare among leg skills designed for evolver’s.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was difficult for anyone to make seven kicks in one jump, let alone
      make all seven kicks fierce and swift. Even many top evolvers could not
      master Seven Kill.
    </p>

    <p>
      The seven kicks were almost finished in one moment without any pause. One
      should manage to kick seven times in one breath. It was extremely pleasing
      to look at, like a battle ax splitting the earth. For the viewers, it was
      even hard to imagine that seven kicks had been made when the fighter had
      already landed. It was so smooth that it looked like one hard kick.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was unable to block Seven Kill and fell back immediately. His
      health went down significantly, almost reaching the bottom
      instantaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Victory!&#8221; Wang Daqing was excited, and others started to
      cheer already.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the cheers only lasted a second. A soldier on worship was already
      on the ground suddenly stood up. His health bar was almost empty, with
      only a hair left. The number was down to 2%.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Great leg skills. What’s the name of it?&#8221; Han Sen asked Lu
      Bin seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Seven Kill.&#8221; Lu Bin laughed and said, &#8220;this is my very
      best work. It is impressive that you could block six kicks.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Seven Kill, noted.&#8221; Han Sen repeated the name of the skill
      and his eyes suddenly became sharp. Staring at Lu Bin, he said slowly,
      &#8220;Let’s do this one more time.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;As you wish.&#8221; Lu Bin could no longer resist the murderous
      urge. He dashed and jumped up with no hesitation, kicking at Han Sen as if
      his leg was the battle ax that splitted heaven and earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not move, his eyes fixed on Lu Bin. When the kick was about to
      fall on his head, Han Sen suddenly moved.
    </p>

    <p>
      A magnificent step! Using Sparticle, Han Sen made an incredibly fast step.
      In the meantime, his body was also moving subtly, making him swing like a
      lotus leaf in the autumn wind.
    </p>

    <p>Swoosh!</p>

    <p>
      Lu Bin’s leg came down and turned into seven kicks. However, all of them
      hit the air, while none hit Han Sen who was swinging. Lu Bin landed, with
      his eyes fixed on Han Sen incredulously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Seven Kill!&#8221; Han Sen exclaimed, jumping up like Lu Bin did
      and kicked at his opponent.
