  “Chairman, our plan has failed. Blood Bone Demon was killed. I take full responsibility.” Inside the New Community’s headquarters, Qing Ya stood with his head lowered.

The Chairman of New Community said, “I already know what happened to Blood Bone Demon. That has nothing to do with you. You’re not responsible for her stupidity.”

The Chairman then said, “Go to the Departed Abyss, and take the creature there to Han Sen. It will definitely be able to kill Han Sen, as long as it’s not as stupid as Blood Bone Demon.”

“Will the one in Departed be willing to help us”? Qing Ya asked, frowning.

“It doesn’t have a choice. Take this.” The Chairman handed a box to Qing Ya. “When the creature sees this, it’ll understand.” “Yes.” Qing Ya left the meeting room with the box without asking what was in it.

“Chairman, is it appropriate to give something so important to Qing Ya?” asked a Shura man who entered the meeting room right after Qing Ya left.

“Do you think there’s anyone else who is capable of taking the one in the Departed Abyss to Wind Song Desert?” asked the Chairman calmly.

The Shura man frowned and said, “I’ve always thought there’s something wrong with that Qing Ya. He’s always so mysterious.”

It doesn’t matter. As long as he can finish what I told him to do, everything will be well, said the Chairman of the New Community. “Go do your job now. There isn’t much time left.”

Han Sen and Lin Feng took off to the desert oasis where Ancient Demon Beast lived. Based on what Lin Feng knew, Ancient Demon Beast was ferocious, and it had the power of time. It was one of the most powerful super creatures in Wind Song Desert.

Han Sen chose it because of its unusual power. If he could obtain its beast soul or geno core, it would benefit him a great deal.

“I can’t believe there are so many creatures in this desert.”, After half a day of walking, Han Sen saw a black river in front of them.

However, it wasn’t actually a river; it was a large swarm of black sand mice. No one could tell how many mice there were. They moved together in a group as they rushed deeper into the desert.

“Sand mice are the most common creatures in Wind Song Desert, so we see them all the time. However, this is the first time I have seen so many sand mice together.” Lin Feng looked at the group of sand mice, surprised.

Jing Jiwu was also looking at the sand mice. He thought about it and said, “I’ve seen such a large group of sand mice before, but that’s because they encountered powerful enemies and escaped their homes through a secret portal under the sand. However, they don’t seem to be running away from anything this time. It looks more like they’re looking for something.”

Han Sen observed the sand mice using his Dongxuan Aura and tried to hear what they were thinking.

Han Sen thought that he wouldn’t be able to gain anything. The Dongxuan Aura didn’t work well on demigods, unless the thinking ripples of demigods were very strong.

To Han Sen’s surprise, he could actually hear something. The thoughts of those sand mice were very strong, so strong that Han Sen could actually hear each sand mouse shouting.

“Fruit… fruit…”

Han Sen listened to it for a while, then he shut down his Dongxuan Aura. His ears and brain had been about to explode because of the noise. The only thing those sand mice were thinking about was “Fruit.”

“Fruit? What is the fruit? Is there a top-tier geno plant maturing and bearing fruits nearby?” Han Sen thought. He turned to Lin Feng. “I think those sand mice are up to something. Let’s follow them and see if we find anything.”

Both Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu agreed to it. The Chef and Xu Mi were also curious. They then followed the group of sand mice to see what they were after.

Han Sen’s companions were naturally much faster than the sand mice, and they soon reached the front of the group of sand mice. There they found a sand mouse the size of a cow with a body of marble, leading the entire group of sand mice forward.

“A super creature!” Xu Mi looked at the king of mice, surprised.

Everyone was just as surprised as Xu Mi. Though there were many sand mice, the vast majority of them were at ordinary level, with only a few primitive mice mixed in. There wasn’t even one sacred-blood creature.

It was indeed surprising to see a super king of mice among them.

Though it was possible for extraordinary circumstances to occasionally produce a more powerful variant among low-level creatures, it was extremely rare. As for low-level creatures like sand mice, it was rare for them to have a mutant creature, and it would be a miracle to have a sacred-blood creature among them. However, there was a king of mice that was a super creature, which made Han Sen wonder what was going on.

The king of mice just continued leading the group of mice forward, and it didn’t show any hostility. Han Sen followed the king of mice forward, continuing to become more nervous.

The king of mice was capable of running very fast, but it wasn’t doing that Instead, it was just jogging so that the group of sand mice behind it could keep up with it. The smaller sand mice followed their king tirelessly as they ran across the desert

The group of sand mice kept running until midnight. Suddenly, Han Sen and his friends saw a river in front of them, and this time, it was a real river.

A river lay across the desert like a thread made of jade. It looked bizarre. Despite the fact that the night was at its darkest and there wasn’t much light from the stars in the sky, the river was gleaming as if the water itself was glowing.

The river was only a couple of feet wide, but the water flowed as fast as that in Yellow River. However, after a short while, the water decreased and then flowed away, like a snake slithering away.

The king of mice made a noise, and then it went on to catch up with the river, chasing the water that continued to flow away across the desert.

Han Sen and the others were all the more curious. They followed the king of mice.

After only a short while, Han Sen found something weird. The river was flowing through a place with lots of dunes, and rather than pooling or flowing around the dunes, the water just flowed up and down them. It was scientifically impossible. Water didn’t flow up. It was just bizarre.

Despite using his Dongxuan Aura to observe the water for a long time, Han Sen couldn’t find anything strange about it It just felt like a normal river with normal water.

They followed the king of mice and ran for a couple of hours, and suddenly, the fluorescent river in front of them disappeared. Holes emerged in the sand, and the fluorescent water all flowed into them.

Those sand holes were only as large as fists, which meant Han Sen and the others definitely couldn’t get in. They had to stop.
