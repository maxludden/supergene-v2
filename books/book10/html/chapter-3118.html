<!--Gold wing peacock king: Mutant god-class gene race (ultimate mode)-->
<!--Skills: Gold god ring, peacock king eye, sky full of feathers--></div>
<p>After examining the details of the gold wing peacock king, Han
Sen was even happier. That gold wing peacock king had three gene
skills. It had top-notch talents.</p>
<p>Ordinary juvenile gene races only had one gene skill. There was
a chance of some having none. If there weren’t any gene skills,
they had to wait until they were adults before receiving their gene
skills.</p>
<p>Each time they leveled up, there was a chance of gene skills
being awoken inside a gene race. Still, that chance wasn’t very
high. Ultimate-mode gene races could have three skills at the
most.</p>
<p>Even if ordinary gene races did reach ultimate mode, they rarely
possessed three gene skills. Having two was already quite
phenomenal. Most of them only had one gene skill. Some gene races
did not even have a single gene skill.</p>
<p>The gold wing peacock king had three. It was definitely the best
of the best.</p>
<p>If Han Sen wanted to sell it, the price could be a few times or
a dozen times more than the same species at the same level of gene
race with only one skill.</p>
<p>This was especially true with gene races with three skills. If a
gene race was rare and the gene skill was useful, it would go for
the highest price. Han Sen had only seen a juvenile gene skill gold
god wing. After combining, he was given golden wings. After he
activated it, there was a break-space flying power available, and
the gold wings had a scary destructive power. The wings behaved
like blades that could cut through anything.</p>
<p>As for the peacock king eye and sky full of feathers, they were
the awakened gene skills. Han Sen did not know what they did.</p>
<p>They were getting close to Gold Crystal System. The light was
getting extremely bright. Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy combined with
gene races to block it. Han Sen did not need to combine with a gene
race, but he still wanted to try. He attempted combining with his
gold wing peacock king.</p>
<p>A blurry, gold, glassy god light shone on Han Sen. The peacock
wings, which were made of gold, appeared. Han Sen’s eyes had a
shiny god light in them. It was like they were swirling with gold.
They looked weirdly pretty. His long, gold hair was wavy like a
waterfall. Every strand of hair was like crystal. It was like there
was a glassy god light spinning inside it.</p>
<p>After combining with it, Han Sen was affected by the gold wing
peacock king’s genes and presence. His face and body seemed to
become longer. He looked rather pretty but somewhat like an evil
king.</p>
<p>Bald Guy looked at Han Sen with shock. After a while, he
swallowed his saliva and asked, “Han Sen, what is that gene race
you have? Where did you get it from? Do you still have</p>
<p>it?”</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu looked at Han Sen. She had a strange expression.
After combining with the gold wing peacock king, Han Sen looked far
too pretty and handsome. He looked more handsome than an evil god.
His entire body had an evil, pretty aura that was quite
attractive.</p>
<p>“The gold wing peacock king,” Han Sen replied. “Oh, I dug it up.
I do not know if there is another of the same type of gene
race.”</p>
<p>“That is a shame. Your gene race looks really awesome after
combining with it. If I, Bald Guy, had a gene race like that,
perhaps my dreams would come true. Maybe I could have God Thousand
Lotus.” Bald Guy looked at Han Sen with excitement. He then asked,
“Is your gene race up for sale? If you sell it, the price is of no
object. I will squander all of my savings and buy it from you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard the God Thousand Lotus name before. With Feng
Fei Fei, it was the same. She was one of the three big singers in
the Qin Kingdom. Bald Guy obviously had a crush on her. He always
talked about her, but she had no interest in him.</p>
<p>“I am not selling it.” It was not easy for Han Sen to get his
hands on that ultimate-mode gene race. Han Sen wanted to use it. He
wasn’t ready to pawn it off just yet.</p>
<p>The blood god dragon was also under Han Sen’s command. It had
swallowed the black crystal armor to enter evolution mode. It would
be hatching before too long. The only gene races Han Sen had to
rely on now were the gold wing peacock king and the blood ghost
spirit. It was a shame that the two of them could not become an
exclusive blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse gene race. It was
hard to receive the boons of a blood dragon God Spirit Blood Pulse.
Their powers would have been inferior to the blood god dragon.</p>
<p>Bald Guy thought it was a shame, but he had not even asked Han
Sen about the level or power of the gold wing peacock king. That
was something very private. It was something unremarkable, so no
one would have asked about it.</p>
<p>After getting close to the Gold Crystal System, they were able
to see that it was not a big sun. It was a system made of many
lights.</p>
<p>Most planets did not glow. Only planets like a sun glowed. Most
other planets only reflected the light.</p>
<p>Now, all the Gold Crystal System’s planets were glowing with a
scary light. The ordinary rocks and trees on the planets shone like
treasures.</p>
<p>Even the manmade buildings and machines glowed in the
incandescent radiance. The entire world looked as if it had been
carved out of precious gemstones. It was incredibly holy.</p>
<p>Bald Guy pointed at the God Wind Dragon and commanded it to fly
to a planet the humans lived on. When he saw what was glowing
behind the buildings, his face changed. He said, “This God Spirit
Blood-Pulse is too shocking. Even some spiritless items that are
manmade have been touched by the scent of the God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. It is far scarier than I imagined. Perhaps there is a
rare gene race being born.”</p>
<p>“A rare gene race, huh?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. During the past
two days, he had not seen the big sky demon. He didn’t know if she
was still following him around or not.</p>
<p>Because the planet was close to the edge of the Gold Crystal
System, many human nobles were able to travel there. They saw many
people digging all around and across the place.</p>
<p>Bald Guy looked at them with much disdain. He steered the God
Wind Dragon deeper into the Gold Crystal System. He said, “They
don’t know anything about God Spirit Blood-Pulses. They are here to
dig gene eggs. They will not be able to dig up a thing. This God
Spirit Blood-Pulse is very scary, but not just anywhere will have a
gene egg.”</p>
<p>Han Sen asked, “Where might there be a gene egg?”</p>
<p>Bald Guy seriously said, “In this place, the God Spirit
Blood-Pulse has a lot of light. Usually, light and heat are
elements that mesh well together. Although the light in this place
is weird, the temperature has not changed. Judging from the light
that is around this place, and if I have guessed it correctly, this
God Spirit Blood-Pulse is in the light abyss formation.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the Qin Kingdom had a light abyss God
Spirit Blood-Pulse 20 years ago?” Li Bing Yu suddenly said.</p>
<p>Bald Guy nodded with excitement. “Yes. This place is very
similar to the light abyss the Qin Kingdom had. This light abyss
has an Annihilation class wild God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It created
the Qin Kingdom. A general there, named Tian Shan, shocked the
world. The formation here is similar to that light abyss. Perhaps
it will have an Annihilation class wild God Spirit
Blood-Pulse.”</p>
