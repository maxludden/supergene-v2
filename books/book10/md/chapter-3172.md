  “Fei Fei, do you have something to say?” Ever since Feng Fei Fei had returned, Han Sen felt as if she had been looking at him differently.

Feng Fei Fei felt weirded out. She strangely looked at Han Sen. She hesitated for a while before mustering the courage to finally ask, “Mister Han, do you like Yin Yin?”

“Of course, who wouldn’t love a cute little girl like Yin Yin?” Han Sen replied with a laugh.

Feng Fei Fei had a nasty flare of the heebie-jeebies. She thought, “Is that so? It is no wonder he has done so much for Yin Yin. He has been crazily helpful, even going so far as to give Yin Yin a mutant eight sound bug. He even gave her an Annihilation inheritor Blood-Pulse and an extremely powerful gene race.”

After thinking about all of that, Feng Fei Fei’s heart was starting to be poisoned with a tincture of sourness. She once thought Han Sen had done as much as he had for Feng Yin Yin because he liked her.

Now, it seemed as if that was not the case. At the very least, Han Sen hadn’t tried to do anything too sordid to her. Even though Han Sen lived in the Feng family’s castle, he never spoke with her too much.

Everything was explained. Han Sen was not there on her behalf. He was only in the castle for Feng Yin Yin. “Mister Han, Yin Yin is only a child.” Feng Fei Fei did not know what else to say.

Although Han Sen was an excellent man, he was already the father of one child. Feng Yin Yin was just a kid. To let her marry a single father was something she could not accept.

“Don’t worry, Yin Yin knows her stuff. She knows how to measure things and make sound decisions. She will not be led astray.” Han Sen thought Feng Fei Fei was suggesting that he had been spoiling Feng Yin Yin too much and risked turning her into a spoiled brat. When those words entered Feng Fei Fei’s ears, they made her face start looking even weirder. She gnashed her teeth and said, “Mister Han, you are free to say that, but Yin Yin is too small. She cannot really explain how she truly feels. She is not ready to be a stepmother just yet. Please, give her some time. When she grows up, she can choose as she sees fit. If she still decides to be with you, then that is fine. I will not stand in the way.”

Han Sen was frozen. He had a strange and shocked expression. “What? No. Um, what are you talking about?”

“I am sorry, Mister Han. I cannot let Yin Yin be with you right now.” Feng Fei Fei lowered her head and bowed.

“Pfffff!” Han Sen almost spat out all the water he had in his mouth.

“Me… you…” Han Sen had never thought about things this way before. After a while, he looked at Feng Fei Fei and displayed a wry smile. “Miss Feng, I think you’ve been overthinking this. Your imagination has really gone places! I am not interested in underdeveloped girls. I love large and mature women. The type with a big booty. Even if I was to search for a woman to involve myself with romantically, it would be someone quite like you, Miss Feng. What kind of man do you think I am?”

When Feng Fei Fei heard what he had to say about himself, she profusely blushed. “No…” Han Sen was too nervous. He felt as if he had said too much. He realized he had said something wrong. “Mister Han, I understand what you are trying to tell me.” After that, Feng Fei Fei blushed and left.

“No, I do not think you understand. That is not what I meant…” Han Sen was frozen. He did not know how to explain it to her.

Before Han Sen could formulate a sentence of some shaky cohesion, Feng Fei Fei was long gone. He was left alone.

Han Sen felt depressed about it, but he also felt a nasty chill run down his spine. It was like there was a spirit staring at him from behind. Han Sen turned around to have a look at what it might have been. He saw Bao’er holding Small Cat. She was sitting on a small, flowery altar. Her were flashing with a weird type of light. She was also smiling at him.

“Dad, I saw everything that happened there.” Bao’er’s lips were lifted. She smiled at Han Sen.

“What do you want from me?” Han Sen knew that explaining this to Bao’er was probably a futile endeavor. That little girl always wanted to cause chaos.

Bao’er ran into Han Sen’s arms. She grabbed Han Sen by the neck and acted as cute as she could. “I know you love Bao’er the most. You love me more than anyone, so I would never think of selling you out. Whatever happens here will be kept on the hush-hush. That is a promise I can keep for you. I will not let my Mom know, but…”

Han Sen once made a deal with Bao’er that he had to go to a street to eat snacks or some other unfair treaty like that. It had satisfied Bao’er, that little demon. “Who did I provoke?” Han Sen glumly sighed.

The god fights were still going on. After reaching the top 100 rankings, the performances of Dollar, Lucky, and Ingot caught the eyes of many more people. The small flying fish that no one knew about was now a hot topic. It was now a creature recognized by all.

Because of the small, flying fish, many people were trying to guess who Ingot was. At the very least, Sky King knew that Ingot was Bao’er. “An Annihilation God Spirit gene race has joined the god fights. Isn’t that cheating?” Sky King was happy this had happened. Because people could not combine with God Spirits to fight, ordinary elites would not use a God Spirit gene race. So, the small flying fish in the god fights was like a big fish in a pond full of small fish. It was a boss.

This boss was going up against Sky King’s sworn enemy, God Word King. How could Sky King not be happy about that?

Sky King could not wait to see God Word King square off against the small flying fish. He suspected the small flying fish would chase him into the sky, where there was no way out, and then chase him to the ground, where there were no doors.

“Even God Word King has not yet exposed his trump card Risk, which will be him using a God Spirit gene race. I am only afraid he is not the opponent of the small flying fish.” Sky King felt very cocky about the outcome. It was like he could picture the God Word King being fried alive by the small flying fish.

In fact, the elites of all the other kingdoms turned their focus to this fight. It was a fight with one of the God of Wealth’s team, which consisted of three people. They were to square off against a real, overbearing elite. They hoped this fight would make Ingot show her true self. They wanted to know who Ingot was.

On the day of the fight, it was not just the Qin Kingdom tuning in. The elites of every other kingdom were keen to spectate this fight. The other fights, which were supposed to have many viewers, did not have many people watching

Even Dollar’s and Lucky’s matches did not have many people watching them. After all, their opponents were far weaker than the God Word King. There was nothing particularly interesting about their fights to watch.

When the match started, people saw the jade white flying fish enter the space battleground. It flapped its white wings and sailed slowly through space. It looked like a lazy, small fish that was afloat in a sky of water. It did not look as if it was harmful at all.

Now, people of the seven kingdoms knew how scary that flying fish was. It even turned god-class gene races into dust.

Everyone waited for God Word King to show himself. They wanted to watch this fight, which could shock the world. They even imagined the master of the small flying fish would show themselves to fight God World King

It was a shame the small flying fish’s master did not show up. It looked like it was going to use the small flying fish to fight.

Using a gene race to fight an Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse was more ignorant than words could describe. People were earnestly hoping to watch a good fight.

Time went by, but God Word King had yet to reveal himself.

“Is God World King forfeiting?”

“Impossible. People like God Word King would not give up, no matter what. It doesn’t matter how strong that gene race is. God World King is the strongest.”

“Why has God World King not shown himself yet?”

Everyone was talking about it. When the space battleground’s time limit ended, God World King had yet to show up. People were able to confirm that one of the Qin Kingdom’s two kings with a different surname, God World King, had thrown in the towel. He did not dare fight the small flying fish.
