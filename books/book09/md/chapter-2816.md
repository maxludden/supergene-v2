  "Kirin power!" Evil Lotus's face changed. His body brimmed with a god light that pushed the red light away. The skin on his face and hair returned to normal.

Everyone was shocked. They all generated powers to get ready, but they did not notice there was a problem. It was like the power had focused solely on Evil Lotus.

"Hmph! The pottery statues have a problem. The pottery powder has a Kirin power inside it." Evil Lotus's god light kept releasing. Everyone saw the broken statue had scattered some of its powder onto his body. It resulted in a strong reaction with the god light. It jumped and sparkled like lightning.

Everyone had been sprayed with the same powder. Second Uncle had crushed a piece of pottery, but nothing had happened to him.

Second Uncle and the others were confused, but Han Sen could guess why this had come to pass. The phoenix fire and phoenix flame were like that too. They did not deal any damage to any creature, but they were able to harm the Sky Vine Radish. It seemed as if the pottery pieces had been created by the same stuff.

"Break all the pottery here. I want to see what the Holy Kirin is up to," Evil Lotus said to Second Uncle with a cold and commanding voice.

Second Uncle's heart leaped inside his chest. He addressed the others. "You all heard the man! Mister God wants us to break these Kirin statues. Hurry up."

After all, Second Uncle was Meng Lie's brother. He saw Second Uncle's eyes and knew what he meant. He punched toward a Kirin statue. A whole line of them was broken.

Meng Lie had easily destroyed those Kirin statues. This time, he broke them hard. He made sure lots of dust was kicked up. He generated a plume so large that it choked the entire hall.

The dust that touched down on Han Sen's body and the bodies of all the others seemed fine. When they landed on Evil Lotus, it prompted a large reaction to occur with his god light. It made his entire body become wrapped up by some burning lightning.

Evil Lotus screamed. His body was like a thunderbolt. He raced out of the palace, looking as if he had been severely damaged.

"Now is the only chance we have to live. Everyone, put some pottery powder on yourself!" Second Uncle commanded. He collected many pottery pieces. He crushed them and rubbed them on his body. Not long later, it looked as if he was a person that had been built entirely from dust.

Everyone realized that the power in the pottery dust only affected Evil Lotus God. It did not affect them. Although they did not know why, they knew it was the best weapon they had against Evil Lotus.

"Collect more pottery powder! We will need it to escape this place. We cannot keep digging for him. If we do, it is only a matter of time before we are all killed." After speaking, Second Uncle broke a few more pieces of pottery. He used a pill presser to store the powder within.

Everyone copied the same method. They broke a few of the pottery statues and collected the powder.

Han Sen really admired them. Second Uncle, in particular, was very focused when he was very scared. When the time came for them to be decisive, he was decisive. He was definitely not an ordinary person.

"Bai Buyi, do you know what consequences you will bear if you do this? Do you really think these crappy pottery statues can go against me? I am a God." Evil Lotus' voice boomed from outside the hall.

"Mister God, what are you talking about?" Second Uncle politely asked. "We have followed your orders to break the pottery statues." He and Bai Buyi kept breaking the pottery statues while also collecting the pottery's powder.

"Ha!" Han Sen was unable to suppress a laugh. Second Uncle was a genius. Even now, while gasping, he still said that.

"Good. Very good," Evil Lotus coldly said from the outside. He stopped talking due to the anger he was feeling.

"Mister God, we are breaking the pottery statues," Second Uncle said. "Is there anything else you would like us to do?"

They did not hear Evil Lotus respond to them anymore. Perhaps he was too mad to even speak, or perhaps he was doing something else entirely.

"Be quick! We do not have much time. Try to bring all the pottery pieces you can. Our return to the Extreme King is entirely dependent on this." Second Uncle hurried them up.

Han Sen was collecting pottery statues. Bao Ying suddenly said with shock, "This Kirin statue has some stuff in it."

Everyone looked at Bao Ying. Seeing a Kirin statue that had been broken by Bao Ying, their attention was snared by the presence of a metal box.

The metal box was square. It was pitch black and looked incredibly heavy. On the outside of the box was the carving of a Kirin.

"It looks like it was left behind by the Holy Kirin, but I wonder why it chose to leave a box behind here," Second Uncle said as he observed the metal box.

"Should we open it?" Bao Qin merrily asked. "Perhaps it contains some treasure left behind by the Holy Kirin. If the pottery powder did not hurt us, perhaps something inside this thing can help us deal with Evil Lotus God."

Second Uncle was not as optimistic as Bao Qin. He shook his head and said, "We should not take that risk right now. Bring the box, but do not open it."

Londo carefully picked up the box. Nothing went awry. Second Uncle felt relieved. Everyone went back to collect the pottery powder.

They broke all the pottery statues inside the palace and collected the remains, but no other metal boxes were discovered. There was just that one metal box.

Second Uncle wanted to put the metal box inside a plastic bag that compressed things, but he noticed he was unable to put it in. He made Londo carry the box.

"When we exit, we need to use the pottery powder," Second Uncle reminded them. "If Evil Lotus comes, everyone just start throwing the pottery powder. There is no need to use any other powers."

Everyone now knew what to do, but their hearts were overwhelmed with worry. They did not know if the pottery powder would really rival Evil Lotus.

Trying to get back to the Extreme King this way was a long shot. They had a long way to get back to the safety of the Extreme King. Even if the pottery powder repelled Evil Lotus, it might not have been enough to carry them all the way back to the Extreme King.

Because there was no other way to go, they still had to try despite the danger.

"Mister Holy Baby, please stay next to me," Bao Ying said as she looked at Han Sen.

Han Sen nodded. He stayed next to Bao Ying, followed everyone, and went outside.

After they exited the palace, they were surprised to no longer see Evil Lotus God. They were not sure where he had gone off to.

"Where is Evil Lotus?" Fourth Uncle frowned.

"There is no need to care about him. Let's just run," Second Uncle said. He hurried everyone out of the East Holy Garden.

Han Sen and the group carefully exited the East Holy Garden. On the way, they did not see Evil Lotus.

"Evil Lotus must know we have the pottery powder to protect ourselves," Bao Qin said with a laugh. "I think it is afraid of us and no longer dares to show up."

Second Uncle frowned and said, "Run and stop talking crap."

Everybody got ready to move. Suddenly, they felt the ground vibrate. It was like a scary beast was running across the ground. They quickly turned their heads to see where the noise had come from.

They shockingly saw Evil Lotus slowly approach. He was not walking fast, but one step was like crossing a mountain and going over water. Behind him was a scary xenogeneic.

Upon seeing the xenogeneic, Second Uncle's face changed. "Oh, no! Evil Lotus is scared of the pottery powder, so he won't attack us. But he brought a xenogeneic to deal with us instead."
