      After hearing Six Paths speak, Han Sen thought it sounded like he was
      confident in his chances of reaching first place. But the placement test
      had actually put Six Paths in fifth place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crystal Core had been in fourth place, and when Six Paths conducted his
      test, he could not pass it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are you from?” Han Sen asked. The spirit sounded very confident and
      full of himself, so he must have had some modicum of proper talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am an emperor that was created. I come from pure chaos; I have no
      parents nor background. There is no need to concern yourself with this.
      Just fight,” Six Paths said with a cold tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen smirked. “Do you think I was born yesterday? Born-emperors start
      with emperor geno cores; you sound like the son of an emperor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths looked at Han Sen coldly and told him, “When I came from chaos,
      I had an emperor geno core. But I didn’t like it, and so I killed myself
      to receive another. Now, I am just like you; starting over with a bronze
      geno core.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really?” Han Sen’s eyes opened wide. He didn’t expect a spirit would ever
      give up an emperor geno core in exchange for a bronze geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would I gain by lying?” Six Paths glum seriousness suggested this
      really wasn’t a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why didn’t you like your previous geno core? Your body has the same
      element, and the second core can’t be all that different from the first.
      What’s the point?” Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is pointless to earn something grand when no effort of your own has
      gone into its retrieval. I’d prefer to earn things through my own hard
      work; the satisfaction gained that way is far more meaningful.” Six Paths
      peered down at Han Sen for a moment, before continuing. “I destroyed my
      geno core, but my emperor body is still here. I will scale down my power
      to combat you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, let’s see what you got.” Han Sen used his hands like blades and
      began slashing towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was employing Ghost Slash, which involved the powers of time and
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths pulled out his sword and struck Han Sen’s hand. The collision of
      powers made an explosion. Six Paths was not moved, but Han Sen staggered
      backwards through the air a few meters.
    </p>
    <p>“I know your power. I will scale down. Fight me!” Six Paths said.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned and thought to himself, “He really does have the body of
      an emperor. Ordinary super creatures could never possess such power!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked dim, but he wasn’t going to turn his nose up at the
      prospect of making battle with an emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not use his Real Blood geno core, and instead, he used his
      phoenix techniques to fly towards Six Paths. Six Paths scaled his level to
      match Han Sen, and his speed and power were brought down to a similar,
      more manageable amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Use your geno core!” Six Paths blocked Han Sen’s attacks three times in a
      row with just his hands, and his opponent still refused to use his geno
      core.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Feel free to use yours. I’ll use mine only when I need to,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>“Okay, then. So be it.” Six Paths pulled out an ancient sword.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt a chill run down his spine when he saw it. It was wholly
      black, with no sheen or gloss. It didn’t reflect a single thing, and it
      looked almost sullen. The appearance of the sword made something clench in
      Han Sen’s gut, as if he was in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen watched him hold the sword, he believed the spirit really was
      named Six Paths. His sword, the Six Paths Sword, became one with its
      wielder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My Six Paths Sword has six different powers; I will make use of the
      first. It is called Heart Sword.” Six Paths pulled out his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen only knew there was an animal path, but he had never heard of the
      heart one.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Six Paths attacked, Han Sen felt a great power overwhelm him. He felt
      as if he wanted to get stabbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like watching a horror movie. They could cause much distress due to
      how terrifying they were, but people insisted on watching them to ride out
      the thrills, anyway. Han Sen felt like a moth, drawn to a flickering flame
      that could incinerate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used his phoenix techniques to dodge, but he couldn’t shake the
      desire of wanting to get stabbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Han Sen had an incredibly strong will. Most would find
      themselves thrown onto the sword by now already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths attacked swiftly, and over time, the attraction grew stronger.
      Han Sen was having to fight physically and mentally, the latter being the
      temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Han Sen’s point of view, Six Paths was an alluring person. He felt as
      if he wanted to die by the spirit’s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Six Paths scaled his power down, Han Sen realized he was at a
      genuine, clear-cut disadvantage. This had never happened to him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This Heart Sword is evil!” Han Sen did his best to fight back against
      that suicidal attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was able to see into Han Sen’s mind and read what was going on,
      and he said, “The path of the heart is one of faith. It makes people
      believe what you say, regardless of whether you’re right or wrong. Your
      faith becomes stronger than everything else, and that is why it is called
      Heart Sword.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought the man was extremely attractive, and he felt small and
      unworthy in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths had gone on to tell Han Sen his secrets, but Han Sen was so
      selfish he hid everything. It made Han Sen feel like he was a much worse
      person, and Six Paths was someone he could greatly admire. His sword was
      extremely attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This skill is so powerful! I cannot believe I underestimated a spirit in
      this sanctuary.” Han Sen thought he was invincible against those of the
      same level as him. Now, Six Paths had revealed to him that spirits of such
      might, at that level, still existed.
