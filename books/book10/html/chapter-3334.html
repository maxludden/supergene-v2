<p>“We both used our power,” Han Sen said. “Therefore, you cannot take the blame out on me.”</p>

<p>“Just wait until I get my body back. I will kill you. I will tear you apart and grind you into dust.” The purple copper sword seemed to know that being angry was pointless. After it said that, it stopped talking to Han Sen. There was no way to tell what it was thinking.</p>

<p>After the girl was spooked away, Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to look around. Within 10 miles, aside from the native little girl, there were no other natives around.</p>

<p>The girl had gone too far away. She had run into a giant helmet that was 9 to 12 feet high and two miles away. There were some simple living things inside the helmet. There were water and fruit. It was unknown where she got them from.</p>

<p>Within 10 miles, Han Sen did not see any rivers or plants. There were only weapons all around.</p>

<p>“Where did that little girl come from? How has she managed to survive here?” Han Sen thought.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, the little girl stayed away from that area. She was scared by what had happened.</p>

<p>Aside from the little girl, no other creature showed up. That made the purple copper sword very sad and angry. It kept roaring and swearing. After it was freed from its current state, it would skin Han Sen alive. It would mount him atop a sword mountain and crucify him.</p>

<p>Han Sen ignored the sword and watched how the little girl lived.</p>

<p>Although the little girl was only seven or eight years old, she had a lot of power and was very fast. She was like a little leopard traveling around the forest of weapons. She would go into the weapon forest every day and journey far. Whenever she returned, she would do so with some water and fruit. Sometimes, she would even come back with broken furniture.</p>

<p>It was a shame that Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura had been blocked by the forest of weapons. He could not extend his vision, so he did not know where the little girl ventured to whenever she left.</p>

<p>After seven or eight days, Han Sen had yet to see another native. So he asked for the purple copper sword, “I say, Old Sword, is there only one native little girl around here?”</p>

<p>“You are an a<strong><strong>le. Your entire family is composed of a</strong></strong>les.” The purple copper sword swore profusely.</p>

<p>“Tell me if you do not like it. I do not have to call you Old Sword. But seriously, why must you swear at me?” Han Sen used another title and said, “Little Sword, are there any other natives in the area?”</p>

<p>The purple copper sword’s teeth itched, but it seemed to know yelling mean words were not going to work. It coldly said, “I told you earlier that there are not many natives here. You will not meet one in 10 days or even half a month, but you just had to go against me, didn’t you? You had to go and scare that little girl. You must have a death wish or something.”</p>

<p>“You can’t take it out on me,” Han Sen said. “It wasn’t my fault. One native can take only one weapon. If you were selected by the little girl, I would be so lonely.”</p>

<p>“Could you not just wait a few more days? Other natives will come eventually. You can be taken away from this place too.” The purple copper sword sounded mad as it spoke, but it had just admitted the fact that only one native could take out one weapon for themselves.</p>

<p>“I am just a nobody, but you are Sky King,” Han Sen said. “You should be generous. Why don’t you be generous when a native comes along? You can let them take me away first.”</p>

<p>“No way. That is impossible.” If the purple copper sword could spit, it would have spit on Han Sen.</p>

<p>“Little Sword, it is bad for us to keep fighting like this. No one will benefit from such sour animosities. Why don’t we have a bet as to which one of us will be picked up first?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He smiled at the purple copper sword.</p>

<p>“What do you want now?” The purple copper sword did not think Han Sen would be honest.</p>

<p>“There are no tricks up my sharp sleeves. We just need to guess whether or not the native that comes next is a man or a woman. If it is a woman, you shut up. I will be the one to lure her. If it is a man, I will not fight and make him take me. You can lure him.”</p>

<p>Before Han Sen could finish, the purple copper sword interrupted him. “Why must you be the one to lure the women while I have the men? That will not work. We have to swap. I will have the girls, and you will have the boys.”</p>

<p>The purple copper sword thought, “I am not stupid. I have been here for many days. That little girl is the only one I have seen in the area. She is probably the one who will come back here.”</p>

<p>Han Sen quickly agreed to the terms. “Fine. Then, that is the deal. No one can regret this fair trade. If you break your word, your son will have no ass, and you will be cheated on by your wife every day.”</p>

<p>“Hang on.” The purple copper sword did not think this was right. It thought, “How can that guy agree to this so quickly? He has been here for a while. He has only seen a little girl native. The most likely to come here is the little girl. He made a bet like this at first but has now agreed to let me take the girl. He is likely digging a pitfall he expects me to stumble into.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Something is wrong with this guy. Creatures that come to the 33 skies cannot be weak. They are all strong. Maybe this guy is very good at sensing things. Maybe he has sensed a man is on the way and that is the entire hole he has been digging. That is the ploy. For sure, things must indeed be this way.” The purple copper sword thought this hypothesis was correct.</p>

<p>“What? Are you going to regret this?” Han Sen asked. “But we just made a promise. Whoever regrets would be…”</p>

<p>“Stop. Stop. Stop. You are making this decision by yourself. I have not said anything. I have not yet decided.” The purple copper sword coldly laughed. “I changed my mind. I will go for a man, and you will have the women.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you want the men?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>Seeing that Han Sen was not so fast this time, the purple copper sword believed its judgment was correct. It coldly said, “Yes. That is right. I want a man.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you really don’t want a woman?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“I said that I don’t want a woman,” the purple copper sword said. “You have the women, and I have the men. You said whoever regrets this will give birth to a son without an ass and their wives will be dishing out green hats every single day.” It made a vow and was not going to let Han Sen alter the deal any further.</p>

<p>“Fine.” Han Sen looked sad after conceding.</p>

<p>Hearing Han Sen’s powerless voice, the purple copper sword looked cocky and asked, “Do you think you can trick me? You should know your limits.”</p>

<p>Soon after, the purple copper sword heard a sword come from far away. It was very happy. “Really? Those footsteps don’t belong to the little girl?”</p>
