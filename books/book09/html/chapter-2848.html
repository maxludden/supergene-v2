<h2>The Broken Scabbard</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2848</h3>

<p>“You being dead and me being alive is the best gamble to bet
on,” Yisha coldly said. A jade, crystal-looking Teeth Knife was
brewing in her hands. It quickly came flying at Han Sen.</p>
<p>The purple knife air became a roaring, swallowing, evil ghost.
It slashed toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled. He used the scabbard in his hands like a knife
and thrust it forward.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not use Teeth Knife power. He only used pure
power to slash toward Yisha’s teeth knife.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The two powers collided in space. The purple, evil,
ghost-looking knife air was being cut open by the scabbard in Han
Sen’s hand. The purple air was like some dragonfly that vanished in
the air.</p>
<p>“You have really reached larva class,” Han Sen said. “With that
kind of practice, you are better than the old Rebate alpha.”</p>
<p>Yisha seemed to know her attack would do nothing against Dollar.
She used the teeth knife, which only God knew what kind of beast’s
teeth it was composed of, and made some weird kind of powerful
movement.</p>
<p>It wasn’t actually the teeth knife moving. It was the space
around that was moving.</p>
<p>Teeth knife power did not leak out. It had been kept at a very
low profile, which made the energy around go toward the teeth
knife.</p>
<p>The teeth knife, which looked like crystal or jade, was suddenly
dyed and turned a deep purple. It was like an evil ghost fang that
had emerged from hell.</p>
<p>This kind of power movement is kind of like teeth power, but it
is also kind of different. What kind of power is this? Han Sen was
shocked, but he quickly realized what sort of power it was. The
teeth knife itself has just reached deified class, and Yisha is
only larva class. The second part must have been a modification of
her own. This must be the teeth knife she has modified. I wonder
what the difference is between this teeth knife and the teeth knife
from the past.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not in a rush to strike. He wanted to know what the
knife skill was that Yisha had modified through teeth knife. He
wanted to know the sort of power it possessed.</p>
<p>Yisha’s stared at Han Sen with an invasive look. The teeth knife
movement in her hand was becoming weaker, but the color was
becoming deeper per. The purple looked so deep that it almost
appeared black.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart felt a little bit scared. It was the reaction
one had when sensing one was in danger. It made Han Sen’s face more
serious looking.</p>
<p>“I thought you wanted to bet, so let’s bet if you are going to
live under the strike of my knife,” Yisha said. The teeth knife in
her hand, which looked like an evil ghost fang, was lifted above
her head. She immediately slashed toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a line of knife airs teleporting in front of him.
Their substance chains were thinner than a hair by 100%. Normal
people could not see it. One could not see the knife air.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart was shocked by this. Anywhere a knife air went,
there was space fabric tear. It was scarier than a space element,
space-cutting skill.</p>
<p>The knife air came fast. Han Sen had no time to hesitate. He
generated power with the scabbard and struck toward the
silk-looking knife air.</p>
<p>It was silent. The scabbard’s sturdiness was comparative to a
deified treasure, but it was suddenly broken by the thin knife air.
The scary knife air still kept coming toward Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>His body made a quick reaction. He flashed, and the scary knife
air went right past his shoulder. The armor on his shoulder and a
piece of his flesh were taken away.</p>
<p>The knife air kept expanding. Wherever the knife air went, the
purple spread. It was like ink in water. It was slowly dyeing
everything around.</p>
<p>Space was not water. It could not be dyed, but that scary purple
ripped through space and kept on tearing it.</p>
<p>“Since when did teeth power become this scary? It can
continuously rip space?” Upon seeing space continue to rip, many
deifieds were shocked.</p>
<p>“That is not pure teeth power. It has combined with some kind of
cutting-element power. Even Dollar was unable to withstand that
sharp power. It looks like Knife Queen has practiced teeth power so
much that it has reached a whole new level. The strength of that
power is no worse than the most destructive geno arts in the whole
universe.” Sky Palace Leader stroked his beard. He was feeling
pleased, so he smiled.</p>
<p>He admired Yisha. He even wanted Yisha to become his student.
Although something happened to stop her from becoming his student,
he was not being cheap with his praises of her.</p>
<p>It did not matter what happened before. Since Yisha brought the
Rebate to Sky Palace, he treated Yisha like a proper student.
Otherwise, no matter how talented Yisha was, she could not have
leveled up this much in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>“Scary teeth knife. From now on, this could be one of the best
geno arts in the universe,” Second Uncle Bai Buyi said.</p>
<p>Space was being ripped. The wound on Han Sen’s shoulder was also
being ripped. With the strength of his xenogeneic body, it was not
quick. Still, he was being ripped slowly but surely. Purple was
spreading across his wounds, making his wounds split up further
inch by inch. It was like a demon, hell, ghost mouth opening.</p>
<p>“That is very powerful knife air, but if you think this kind of
knife air can kill me, you have underestimated me. I am Dollar.”
Han Sen did not move. The wound on his shoulder suddenly went
still. It was as if it had frozen. It stopped spreading. It was
like the wound and the knife air had been frozen stiff.</p>
<p>Han Sen forcefully stopped the universal cogwheel’s spin. It
made the wound on his body stop, but his power was not enough to
wholly reverse the spin of the universal cogwheel. So, the wound
did not go away.</p>
<p>“If one slash won’t work, I will just have to perform another
cut.” Yisha’s voice was cold as ice. She slashed forward with her
teeth knife again.</p>
<p>There was no defense involved. She used her aggressive knife
skills, and that was all. It was a very mad knife skill that only
attacked people. In fact, she did not even have to defend. With
teeth knife’s new scary and destructive powers, it could rip up
every substance. If she was able to get a hit on her enemy and kill
the enemy, that was already the best defense.</p>
<p>Han Sen held the broken scabbard and presented a wry smile. He
thought, She does not even want the scabbard! She is trying to kill
me!</p>
<p>Han Sen was ready to raise the scabbard again, but he noticed
something was wrong. Where the scabbard had broken, a weird light
flashed from inside.</p>
<p>What’s going on? The knife air was near him. Han Sen did not
have the time to look at what had happened with the scabbard. While
he was dodging, he dodged the knife light.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen evaded the knife air, Yisha’s teeth knife was
like a purple bolt of lightning. It slashed and crossed where he
had been, but the knife air that had generated in space was like a
purple bolt of lightning that did not disappear. It did not just
stay in space. It kept ripping. Suddenly, a large parcel of space
was doused in purple. It was like a purple spider web in space.</p>
