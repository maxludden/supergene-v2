<p>“Why is this process so familiar? Why do I feel like this is the
same concept as the crystallizer glasses?” Han Sen looked at the
God Spirit Touch on the table, deep in thought.</p>
<p>The people of Sky Palace were observing the God Spirit Touch.
They didn’t believe the God Spirit Touch could reveal such amazing
information.</p>
<p>If their future was able to be decided by an insect, then what
was the point of continued practice?</p>
<p>“It’s just a bug. How can it decide our fate?” Thousand Feather
Crane asked in annoyance. He was speaking aloud what everyone else
in Sky Palace was thinking.</p>
<p>Bixi looked as cold as he always did. He looked at Thousand
Feather Crane and said, “Although it is not 100% accurate, its
margin for error is small. If you people don’t believe me, you are
welcome to give it a try.”</p>
<p>“How do we give it a try?” Thousand Feather Crane asked, looking
at the coin-sized God Spirit Touch ladybug.</p>
<p>Bixi didn’t speak. He reached his hand out to tap the God Spirit
Touch. The God Spirit Touch’s body shivered. Then, it climbed back
into the bug shells it had previously shed. Layer by layer, it
pulled itself back into the bug shells to recompose itself. They
fit around it without a single seam showing.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t witnessed that, the crowd would never have
suspected that the bug had nine layers of the shell to shed.</p>
<p>Now, Bixi said, “Give him a drop of your blood. It will eat your
blood and start removing its shells per the genes within your
blood.”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane didn’t hesitate. He put out his finger
and squeezed out a droplet of blood. He allowed the God Spirit
Touch ladybug to swallow the droplet of blood.</p>
<p>But this time, the ladybug only shed seven layers of its shell.
Then, it stopped moving. It looked exhausted again.</p>
<p>“Seven armor talent. Not bad. If your luck doesn’t work against
you, you can become deified and even reach the rank of
transmutation,” Bixi said, looking intently at the God Spirit
Touch.</p>
<p>“I just say this bug has gotten tired, and that is why he
stopped moving after taking off seven layers of its shell,” Yun
Suyi said with a slight sneer.</p>
<p>All of the Sky Palace students agreed. They all doubted the
truthfulness of the God Spirit Touch’s ability.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, why don’t you show us?” Bixi said, looking at
Exquisite. Exquisite nodded. She used her finger to touch the head
of the God Spirit Touch. The God Spirit Touch put on its layers of
shell again. Exquisite fed it a droplet of her blood. As everyone
watched, the bug started to shed its layers of armor again. It
removed nine layers of the shell.</p>
<p>“If you guys still don’t believe us, you are welcome to try it
yourselves. The genes of the Sky are quite good when compared to
most of the higher races. A five-rank gene talent is most common,
but it isn’t hard to get seven or eight. Nine is very rare, though.
Right now, in the Sky, we have only been able to confirm that Lone
Bamboo and Yu Shanxi have a nine armor talent,” Bixi said.</p>
<p>People still didn’t believe it, and Yun Suyi suddenly said, “It
is easy to tell if this bug is accurate.”</p>
<p>“Please enlighten us,” Bixi said while looking at Yun Suyi.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace students all looked at Yun Suyi, as well. Yun
Suyi looked at Bixi and confidently said, “You said Lone Bamboo had
a nine armor talent, right?”</p>
<p>“That is correct,” Bixi answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“Then it is easy,” Yun Suyi said with a laugh. She looked at Han
Sen and said, “If Lone Bamboo has a nine armor talent, then I
present to you Brother Han, who has the same skill as Lone Bamboo.
I think he is as talented as Lone Bamboo. Would you not agree?”</p>
<p>“Right, right; Brother Han and Lone Bamboo are similar. Perhaps
we should allow Brother Han to give it a try.” The Sky Palace
students were all in agreement.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s reputation in Sky Palace was as solid as Lone
Bamboo’s, and he had done so much outside of Sky Palace to exceed
everyone’s expectations of him. He had even taken down the Extreme
King’s Fourth Uncle. If the bug said Han Sen wasn’t talented, they
wouldn’t believe in the insect’s accuracy.</p>
<p>“Maybe not.” Bixi looked at Han Sen and coldly said, “The gene
talents of the crystallizers have flaws in them. They are only
advanced in their intelligence. They don’t exceed others in any
capacity. Most of their race is like that. Even a few of the
mutated ones aren’t much different; they might gain one or two
additional shells. Having three more is incredibly rare.”</p>
<p>“Having three more shells is great. If normal crystallizers have
a six armor talent, then it isn’t outlandish to believe Brother Han
might have a nine armor talent,” Yun Suyi said. “The Sky are a high
race. Ordinary people of the Sky have a five armor talent. The
crystallizers are not a high race. Ordinary crystallizers only have
three or four armor talents. My race has seen many crystallizers
and tested them with the God Spirit Touch. Four armor talents are
very rare, and I have never seen one with a five armor talent,”
Bixi said levelly.</p>
<p>“If Brother Han cannot test and display a nine armor talent,
then it proves the God Spirit Touch isn’t accurate,” Yun Suyi
surely said.</p>
<p>“I agree. Brother Han’s skill, if he doesn’t get a nine armor
talent, that means the bug is faulty.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes. If Brother Han doesn’t have a nine armor talent, then
further testing is unnecessary. Even if he has a nine armor talent,
it is useless. We cannot reach Brother Han’s achievement. That
means the results from this thing are pointless.”All of the Sky
Palace students were excited. Some of them weren’t actually
suspicious of the God Spirit Touch, but this was about Lone Bamboo.
Bixi and the others had made them mad. The Sky Palace students
weren’t fond of Bixi and Exquisite, and that was why they were so
excited.</p>
<p>“I cannot tell you if it is real or not. We will have to find
out through further testing.” Bixi remained emotionless. It was
like his face was wearing a mask that never moved.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t want to participate in such a test. It was none
of his business, but the Sky Palace students were begging him to.
So, he stood up and walked next to Bixi.</p>
<p>Bixi didn’t say much. He pressed the God Spirit Touch’s head to
have it scurry around, collecting all of its shells. Then, he told
Han Sen, “It’s ready.”</p>
<p>“The genes of humans aren’t stable, and even the crystallizer
glasses weren’t able to tell me anything. I wonder if this God
Spirit Touch can do what the glasses couldn’t,” Han Sen thought to
himself. Then, he squeezed out some blood from his finger and held
it in front of the God Spirit Touch.</p>
<p>The God Spirit Touch sucked Han Sen’s finger, pulling Han Sen’s
blood into its belly.</p>
<p>The people of Sky Palace observed the God Spirit Touch
nervously. Bixi and Exquisite watched the God Spirit Touch, as
well. They were interested to see how much armor talent he had.</p>
<p>As everyone watched, the God Spirit Touch’s body shivered. It
twitched slowly as it processed the blood it had taken in.</p>
