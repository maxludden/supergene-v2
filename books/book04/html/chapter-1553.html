      He didn’t know when the chimenea had begun spewing icy fire again, but
      that’s what it was now doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouths of the eleven Black Seahorses were shaped like megaphones. They
      spat out frosty air at the white metal tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shit! Are those Black Seahorses that cruel? Even if I did steal your
      little Ice Seahorse, there’s no need to freeze him and me together. You
      guys are crueler than tigers.” Han Sen felt depressed, and he tried to
      think of a way he might escape this predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frosty air cropped across Destiny’s Tower, webbing the entirety of its
      metal structure. Even if Little Star used its Starsea powers to escape,
      Han Sen thought they’d be frozen, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The glaciers all around were broken by that frosty air. The peaks
      collapsed, and soon after, the cap of the white metal tower came crumbling
      down with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deadly flowers had become nothing but icicles under the force of that
      frosty air. The cold ruined and destroyed any powers they possessed. And
      soon after, the very ground began to tear and come asunder. It was like
      the world was ending.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eleven Black Seahorses and their power were too much. The wrath they
      unleashed could have definitely put them in the category of being berserk
      super creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fuck! They’re trying to kill me. Wait a minute… If they’re using such
      powerful frosty air, then why don’t I feel cold?” Han Sen was shocked when
      he realized he didn’t feel cold, at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frosty air froze the glaciers stiff until they broke, but Han Sen was
      not feeling a thing. The frosty air might as well have not even existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it so cold that my brain froze, and now I cannot feel the cold
      anymore?” Han Sen pinched himself, but he did feel pain. His skin was
      still silky smooth, as well. He definitely wasn’t frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s going on? Has the white metal tower shielded us from the Black
      Seahorses’ ice spit?” Amidst Han Sen’s shock, he asked himself this
      question
    </p>
    <p>
      The white metal tower was atop an ice mountain. The eleven Black Seahorses
      had broken the mountain with their frosty air. The white tower had been
      falling, but now, they were no longer feeling any such movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen quickly returned to the window, and what he saw surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white metal tower hadn’t fallen with the mountain. It was actually
      hanging in mid-air. A hand was there, holding it aloft in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a giant, rock-like hand. And the huge white tower was being
      casually held up by this hand. It wasn’t taking up the entire hand,
      either. The tower looked like a toy that just happened to rest in its
      palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen followed the hand back to the arm that supported it. The hand was
      actually connected to a man made of rock. A giant rockman. It also just
      happened to be headless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rockman was sitting between the glaciers with its hand holding the
      white metal tower aloft. This was the headless rockman Han Sen had seen on
      the first floor of the white tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that rockman was shining, and the light it gave off was so bright, it
      obscured sight of the mountain itself. It was a god-like sort of magic.
    </p>
    <p>“Destiny. Destiny.”</p>
    <p>
      A really sad voice came from the rockman. It was like he was saying you
      could not control destiny. Destiny was full of unfairness, and it was
      governed by cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rockman had no head, though, so Han Sen wasn’t sure where the voice was
      actually coming from. Regardless, it boomed like thunder. It made the
      blood inside his body vibrate so wildly, it felt like it was trying to
      break out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen looked at the eleven Black Seahorses and the chimenea next,
      his face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Seahorses and the chimenea had somehow become gigantic. They
      were almost as big as the rockman.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Black Seahorses looked like sun-class battleships. And the
      chimenea looked like an entire planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Destiny. Destiny. My life is my life. My life is my life. It does not
      belong to the sky.” Rockman’s voice sounded even crazier than it had
      before. It was spoken with a force that should have been enough to sunder
      the earth. It was like an undying warrior, filled with a zeal for murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After all these years, do you still not understand?” The chimenea now
      spoke, and it was a cold voice that came from it. It was not loud, but its
      volume was still greater than the rockman’s. It came into Han Sen’s ear
      without losing a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      That voice was unisex, too. Han Sen couldn’t determine whether or not it
      was the voice of a woman or a man. But what Han Sen could tell was that it
      was the creature with the armor that was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I won’t understand, even in death.” The rockman had a very loud and angry
      voice. Its other hand, which was like a mountain, came towards the eleven
      Black Seahorses and the chimenea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It felt as if the ground was breaking when that big hand moved. Wherever
      the big hand went, the entire dimension was cracked. It felt like the
      whole world could be crushed below its might, whenever it struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eleven Black Seahorses were screaming at it angrily. The megaphone
      lips that were like the gun emplacements on a sun-class battleship spat
      out frosty air. Their force was enough to impede and stop the movement of
      the stone hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      That scary, frosty air made its hand freeze in place. The creatures then
      generated more ice, to encase it inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are dead. You should understand that.” The chimenea spoke again with
      an even colder voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I won’t. Even if I die.” The rockman sounded very sad, and he continued
      pushing down. The ice that encased his hand was broken and cast away, and
      the hand resumed its advance. It was going to break the heads of the
      eleven Black Seahorses.
    </p>
    <p>Pop!</p>
    <p>
      The eleven Black Seahorses spilled blood and fell back. Even they could
      not withstand the rockman’s power.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let it burn to dust.” With that cold voice, the chimenea’s grate was
      opened. The ice fire came out, and it began to rapidly approach the body
      of the rockman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen now knew that neither the rockman nor the Black Seahorses were
      coming after him. Still, witnessing such wrathful power was very
      frightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had simply come there for treasure. He didn’t expect to encounter
      such bad luck and stumble into the cross-fire of two bosses fighting.
      Compared to the chimenea and rockman, Han Sen’s power was like a small
      river running into the sea. He was not very effective by comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the ice flames come like a river, Han Sen was worried that the
      tower would be completely destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rockman’s hand that held the tower moved, and the tower flew through
      the air. It was going towards the airborne fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, Han Sen saw the frost get absorbed and nullified by the body of
      the white metal tower. It sucked it up clean.
