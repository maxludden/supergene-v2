<h2>Escape</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2242</h3>

<p>With the Demon Bug King Bai Sema’s protection, Han Sen quickly
escaped to an unexplored area of Planet Ice Blue.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King teleported after Han Sen with a fist
brimming with power, and he thrust it forward against the Demon Bug
King Bai Sema. The Bai Sema vibrated, but it showed no sign of
cracking.</p>
<p>“The shield can block Ice Blue Knight King’s attacks. It really
is powerful, but it cannot last forever. We should get ready to
show ourselves soon,” Edward said. He snuck out of the base and
went after Han Sen.</p>
<p>Edward had nothing to be afraid of. Ice Blue Knight King had
disobeyed orders when he attacked Han Sen, and Edward technically
had nothing to do with this. He would simply help the Knight King
capture Han Sen and ensure his safety.</p>
<p>As Ice Blue Knight King pounded the Demon Bug King Bai Sema, Han
Sen heard the shield groan as if it was going to shatter. It was
like glass that had been strained to the breaking point. He
frowned. “It looks like the Demon Bug King Bai Sema can block
half-deified attacks, but not forever. It’s a shame those other
Demon Bug King Bai Semas are currently damaged. If I had those in
play, the tri-colored Demon Bug King Bai Sema would definitely be
able to block Ice Blue Knight King’s attacks.”</p>
<p>Han Sen kept flying, trying to think of a way that he could
shake off his pursuer. He knew simple speed wouldn’t aid him in the
long run. He had to find a way to escape before the Bai Sema
broke.</p>
<p>“If I can slip out of Ice Blue Knight King’s vision and hide my
presence, I can use Little Invisible to help me escape the rest of
the way. But right now, doing that is too difficult,” Han Sen
thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew above a nearby mountain. Wherever they went, the
creatures fled. The skies were filled with xenogeneics racing away
in fear, and that surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King’s superior speed had allowed him to catch
up quickly. Han Sen had a few ideas on what he could do, but he
couldn’t find a good opportunity to make any of them work.</p>
<p>The Bai Sema took more and more damage, and it looked likely to
break. Ice Blue Knight King punched with increasing ferocity, but
suddenly, a roar rang out from the mountain beneath them.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A white light shot out from deep in the mountains. Its target
was Ice Blue Knight King.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King turned to block the incoming light, and
there was a blinding collision of blue and white lights in the sky.
Its force ended up destroying everything around them. Part of the
backlash washed over the mountain, and then, a giant beast that was
around a hundred meters long emerged. It sent more of that white
power towards Ice Blue Knight King.</p>
<p>“Even God is helping me!” Han Sen grinned and shot off into the
mountains. The beast kept Ice Blue Knight King engaged,
unintentionally stopping him from following Han Sen. The Knight
King kept punching with more and more power, as if it was the only
thing that could stop the annihilation of the world.</p>
<p>The entire mountain range shook as mountaintops and peaks fell
from their lofts. The grounds were sundered while creatures
fled.</p>
<p>Han Sen rushed into a mountain and threw Bao’er into Destiny’s
Tower. Then he dropped onto the ground and turned himself into a
Stone Cow. He thundered towards a nearby crowd of xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Han Sen was blending into the stampede of xenogeneics when he
suddenly saw a shadow circle the mountain. It was Inspector
Edward.</p>
<p>Edward’s eyes roved over the ground. It seemed as if he was on
the prowl for Han Sen, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t look at Edward, hoping that the man wouldn’t see
through his disguise. He followed the xenogeneics deeper into the
mountains.</p>
<p>“Weird. Where did he go?” Edward frowned. He had seen Han Sen
land in that area, but Edward’s quarry had now vanished into thin
air.</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s turned himself invisible? Even if he did, he still
wouldn’t be able to escape my eyesight. The mountain isn’t too
damaged, and there are no secret escape tunnels. His only option
would be to walk out. So, the things that are currently leaving…”
Edward’s green eyes looked all around. After a while, he raced
towards the group of fleeing xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Edward looked very excited. His eyes brightened, and he spoke to
himself, “A powerful guy! He can even shapeshift. If he was also
half-deified, I don’t think I would be able to defeat him!”</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Edward raced after the xenogeneics that were
fleeing the area. He hovered right above them.</p>
<p>He looked down on the thousand xenogeneics, and the irises of
his eyes turned to crystal as he examined them.</p>
<p>Edward took one look and made a mental note of each and every
animal that was there. In just a second, he noticed the
problem.</p>
<p>“That Stone Cow has disappeared.”</p>
<p>But Edward didn’t keep following the group of xenogeneics.
Instead, he looked back the way he had come.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When Han Sen escaped Edward’s vision, he used Little Invisible
to leave the group of xenogeneics. He didn’t go too far, though. He
circled around and went back to where Ice Blue Knight King and that
goliath were fighting.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen headed straight into the deep hole
that the beast had emerged from.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t believe that the monster’s intervention was truly
coincidental, but now, he was looking for a way to escape. There
was a strong xenogeneic blocking Ice Blue Knight King, and he was
going to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>It looked as if the fight between Han Sen and Ice Blue Knight
King had disturbed the beast, but instead of coming after them
both, the monster had decided to ignore Han Sen and go straight for
Ice Blue Knight King. That seemed strange to Han Sen.</p>
<p>He ran into the abyss it had emerged from to have a look around,
and he immediately noticed that the cavern wasn’t the beast’s
home.</p>
<p>It looked very similar, but under the clarity gifted to him by
the Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen could see the molecular traces of the
beast. It had come to the cave recently, and it had only been there
for a short time. It couldn’t have been there any longer than two
days.</p>
<p>The cave did house a powerful xenogeneic nest, but the molecular
traces of the cave’s original inhabitants were different. They
didn’t belong to the beast that had saved him.</p>
<p>“It looks like Edward was willing to help me escape from Ice
Blue Knight King.” Han Sen ran deeper into the nest without
hesitation.</p>
<p>Han Sen was certain that all the creatures that should’ve been
living there were now dead. The beast must have had some kind of
relationship with Edward.</p>
<p>But if Edward had sent the creature, then Han Sen sneaking into
the lair of the dangerous beast should be the last thing he would
expect.</p>
<p>“Edward’s mind is pretty scary. He will come here sooner or
later. I need to get out of here quickly,” Han Sen thought to
himself as he observed the nest.</p>
<p>After entering the giant nest, Han Sen saw some large bones
strewn about the cavern.</p>
<p>Most people would have assumed that those bones were the remains
of the beast’s prey, but Han Sen could tell their true origin from
the molecular traces. The bones belonged to the xenogeneics that
originally lived there.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if this nest has another exit.” Han Sen confirmed
there were no other xenogeneics present, then decided to explore a
little deeper into the nest.</p>
