  Tail Fire Beast was a Break World beast with a Break World rate of 95% or above. It increased Han Sen’s Break World gene tally by eight, so the reward for the effort was not too shabby.

“Bao’er, this is for you.” Han Sen carried Bao’er to a no man’s land. He used his Burning Red Sky leader’s power to hide the Burning Red Sky rules. He took out the gourd seed and passed it to Bao’er.

Bao’er’s eyes opened wide as she looked at Han Sen and the gourd seed he was offering to her. She was confused and asked, “Dad, what is this? Why does this thing give me a familiar feeling?”

“I found it on a gourd vine. You came from a gourd, so maybe it is related to you.” Han Sen did not tell Bao’er about the God Chaos Party’s old leader.

Although the God Chaos Party Leader’s soul was gone, telling Bao’er about all that would likely upset her. It was best for him not to say anything.

“Thank you, Dad.” Bao’er happily accepted the gourd seed.

The gourd seed, which looked normal in Han Sen’s hands, exhibited weird changes when it was in Bao’er’s hands. It was like the seed came alive. It grew fast and quickly became a gourd vine. It surrounded Bao’er.

Han Sen did not interfere. He merely watched. If that gourd vine did anything explicitly negative to Bao’er, he would do all that he could to destroy it.

As Bao’er subjected herself to the gourd’s treatment, she looked very happy. The gourd vine surrounding her kept growing. It was like a living thing that could grow on its own and become a set of vine-wreathed armor cladding Bao’er’s body.

When the vine armor was composed, the gourd vine started to die. The leaves looked like dust as they fell and scattered. The green vines looked dry. They changed from yellow to brown and from brown to grey and black.

As the vine armor kept changing, it became a grey vine armor. It perfectly wrapped up Bao’er’s small body. It looked very delicate. It was like it was tailor-made.

Bao’er tried to move with it. The vine armor did not affect her movement. It was very light.

“This vine armor is interesting. I feel as if I can hear it.” Bao’er waved her hand, and the vine armor swam around it. It became a vine hammer.

Bao’er kept morphing. The vine armor kept changing into whatever she wished it to be. It turned into a knife, spear, sword, or whip. It could easily become anything like that. It was also able to create a gatling gun. It made Han Sen freeze.

“Bao’er, quit playing around,” Han Sen said. “Let’s see if this thing actually works.”

He could not sense a special power in the vine armor. All he could feel was a presence that was quite similar to the black-crystal armor. It was, however, a bit different. It was unknown what sort of power resided inside it.

This was something the God Chaos Party Leader had left behind for her daughter. It was likely something quite special, so Han Sen could not wait to see the true power of the vine armor.

Bao’er paused and thought for a moment. She then turned the vine armor into a big vine hammer. She smacked a rock next to her.

Pang!

The vine hammer smacked the big rock. It made a huge sound. Han Sen’s eyes opened wide.

He did not open his eyes wide because of the vine hammer’s power. The rock was not broken. It bounced the hammer back. Bao’er fell onto her head. She dropped her butt on the ground, and her little head rolled around. She looked dizzy.

“Holy shit! The God Chaos Party must have tricked us. Why would she leave something that lame behind for her daughter?” Han Sen wanted to laugh.

Han Sen knew something had to be amiss. God Chaos Party Leader would not actually leave something totally useless for her daughter.

Bao’er shook her head. She stood up and looked a little bit mad. She lifted the hammer and used even more strength to break the stone in front of her.

There was a pang sound. Again, the stone was not affected. The vine hammer flew out of Bao’er’s hands. It hit the ground, bounced a few times, and stopped moving.

Han Sen and Bao’er were frozen. This was the first time they had ever seen such a useless weapon.

With Bao’er wielding it as a weapon, even an ordinary steel sword would make the rock be hewn in two. But the vine hammer did not even leave a mark on it.

Bao’er could not help but summon the vine hammer back. She turned it into a knife, sword, spear, and trident. She tested all its forms out, but the results were always the same. The vine, which once looked really powerful, was unable to damage a stone.

“What is going on with this thing?” Han Sen knew it might be that Bao’er had not yet found the proper way to use it, so he had Bao’er put it away for further research at another time.

Bao’er madly tossed the vine on the ground, but the vines surrounded her again. It became a set of vine armor that wrapped up Bao’er’s body.

“Bao’er, you go back. Without my permission, do not come to the 33 skies again.” Han Sen picked up Bao’er, Small Cat, and the small flying fish, and readied himself to send them out of the 33 skies.

He was the leader of Burning Red Sky. He could take people out of Burning Red Sky whenever he wanted to, which meant he could also leave.

Before Han Sen left, a scary presence suddenly appeared in Burning Red Sky. The suppression was like hell. It was like a sea. It covered all of Burning Red Sky.

Han Sen’s face changed. He could not see who this person was, but this was a scary suppression. He had not seen this very often. This power indicated that whoever had it was not someone ordinary.

When Han Sen saw who had arrived, his face changed. One could have said that his face looked very glum.

A gold light was coming down from the sky. A blonde lady wearing white, royal clothing appeared. She was like an angel, descending on the land. She was like a holy goddess floating down from the godly realms.

Han Sen recognized her. She was the blonde Wan’er, but he had turned Wan’er into the black hair variant. He did not know why she was blonde again.

Seeing blonde Wan’er and her cold eyes, Han Sen knew he was in trouble.

“Qin Xiu, that asshole. He turned Wan’er into a cold, killing machine again. Does he not know Wan’er is the happiest when she has black hair?” Han Sen knew Qin Xiu had done something to make Wan’er blonde again. He was very annoyed.

At the same time, Han Sen no longer felt safe. “Mister White said I will face bad luck in the 33 skies. Does that disaster have something to do with Wan’er showing up?”
