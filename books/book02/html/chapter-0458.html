    <p>
      Li Mingtang thought about it and said, &#8220;We are all coworkers, so
      there&#8217;s no need to get to the bottom of this. We can just laugh it
      out.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Xin did not want to let it go and said, &#8220;Professor, as a
      graduate from Alliance Central Military Academy, I could not stand vicious
      words against my alma mater. I must clear it up.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After he said that, Tang Xin stared at Han Sen fiercely, obviously upset.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Researcher Tang Xin, that is not right. You have your alma mater,
      but don&#8217;t we all have ours? You slandered Han Sen&#8217;s alma mater
      first…&#8221; The fat squad leader could no longer watch this and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was just stating a fact, not trying to slander anything.&#8221;
      Tang Xin sneered. &#8220;If we ask Professor Li Mingtang to look it up, we
      will naturally know who is stating the fact and who is slandering.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The fat squad leader simply said, &#8220;Look it up! I believe that Han
      Sen would not lie. Professor, please look it up for us, so we could clear
      Han Sen&#8217;s name.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the fat squad leader said that, Li Mingtang had to connect to the
      Skynet, looking for the military school contests that Han Sen had
      participated in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shortly, many entries appeared. All the researchers and cookhouse soldiers
      looked to the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before long, his face became stern. At that time, almost every media
      reported the archery tournament between the emperor and the monster. It
      was fair to say that the match was a historic one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game ended Jing Jiwu and Alliance Central military Academy&#8217;s
      rule in the league. The nickname of Han Sen, emperor, was broadcasted in
      the league by all kinds of media.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any report would reflect how the game went down and how Han Sen performed.
      The media almost described Han Sen as a godsent archer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it was exaggerated, there was no doubt that Han Sen did lead
      Blackhawk to beat Alliance Central Military Academy which was the ruler at
      the time. As Han Sen had said, in that game, Blackhawk was the winner.
    </p>

    <p>
      The researcher suddenly changed their attitude about Han Sen. A cookhouse
      soldier, even one on Daphne should not be too good a fighter. Otherwise,
      he would not end up as a cookhouse soldier.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, no one had expected for Han Sen the new recruit to have such a
      successful past.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being able to be called the strongest person in the entire league was an
      honor that none of the researchers who graduated from Alliance Central
      Military Academy had enjoyed, including Tang Xin.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, when they were at school, they were not the strongest person on
      campus.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, I did not realize you were so good when you were at
      school.&#8221; The fat squad leader was so happy that he patted Han Sen on
      the shoulder with his meaty hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some researchers had always looked down on ordinary soldiers, and Tang Xin
      was the worst of them. The fat squad leader was very happy to see his face
      slapped by Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was not that good. It&#8217;s just the opponent was too
      weak.&#8221; Han Sen was not a pushover. Since Tang Xin had tried to bully
      him, he would punch back as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Xin&#8217;s face became purple, the corner of his mouth twitching
      without making a single sound. He quit lunch and left immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well done, Han Sen. That Tang Xin is such a snob, mean and picky as
      if he was better than all of us. The guy annoyed the hell out of me. I did
      not realize how great you were at the military school.&#8221; When Han Sen
      returned to the kitchen, the vice squad leader also complimented him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;All right, stop that.&#8221; The fat squad leader closed the door
      of the kitchen and said to Han Sen solemnly, &#8220;Han Sen, be careful in
      the future. That Tang Xin is a petty person. You are probably already on
      his enemy list.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am a cookhouse soldier, and he is a researcher in the expert
      panel. What could he possibly do to me?&#8221; Han Sen said with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is nothing he could do to you on the warship, but it is hard
      to say when we arrived at the Crystallizer ruin. There are many weird
      stuff inside the ruin. We don&#8217;t really know how they work. If he set
      you up, then it will be very hard for you to protect yourself. After
      arriving at the ruin, remember not to walk around alone. Just stay on the
      warship so that he could do nothing to you,&#8221; the fat squad leader
      warned Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Others also gave Han Sen some advice. Since Han Sen did not want to worry
      them, he nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But then again, since you were so great in military school and got
      the rank of major, how come you came here to be a cookhouse
      soldier?&#8221; Li Mingliang couldn&#8217;t help asking.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In fact, my dream is to be a soldier on the warship, even as a
      cookhouse soldier, which is why I&#8217;m here…&#8221; Han Sen was telling
      the truth. However, he did not tell the whole truth. He wanted to be a
      soldier on the warship of Ji Yanran, that is.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen entered God&#8217;s Sanctuary again, he eventually saw the
      pretty face of Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It seems it&#8217;s time to conquer the spirit shelter.&#8221; Han
      Sen found Yang Manli to summoned everyone in God is again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Everyone, I decided to set out to conquer the spirit shelter
      tomorrow and use that shelter as the base of Goddess Gang. If anyone wants
      to quit, now is the time. I do not want to force you, so I will let you go
      with no strings attached.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s gaze swept across
      people&#8217;s faces.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Captain, is it too early for us to conquer the spirit shelter?
      There is an aristocrat spirit in the spirit shelter and many mutant
      creatures. We do not have quite the strength yet to do that. How about we
      develop our strength a bit further and do that when we have all maxed out
      on ordinary geno points and primitive geno points? In that case, we would
      have a much better chance.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, Captain. We should focus on cultivation now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We have no idea how many mutant creatures there are in the spirit
      shelter. Is it too big a challenge for us to go now?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We have enough strength to kill primitive creatures in batches. How
      about we spend more time doing that and when…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen glanced at the mob he was leading and said coldly, &#8220;Today I
      am gathering you to tell you my decision. So, all you need to do is to
      execute it or quit. I do not need your advice. However, there is one thing
      I must state clearly right now. If you quit at this point, Goddess Gang
      will never welcome you back, not now, and definitely not when we have
      conquered the spirit shelter. It&#8217;s your own choice to stay or
      go.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s words brought silence to the scene. Very soon, someone
      stood out, gritted his teeth and told Han Sen, &#8220;Sorry, captain, we
      do not have enough resources to take down the spirit shelter. I
      can&#8217;t risk it with my life.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bring me his contract.&#8221; Han Sen did not answer but asked Yang
      Manli to bring the guy&#8217;s contract and voided it.
