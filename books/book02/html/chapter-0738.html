    <p>
      &#8220;No.&#8221; Han Sen pushed her away and went back to lie down on the
      bench.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Why? I can pay you!&#8221; Zhou Yumei quickly suggested.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s because I can&#8217;t; that&#8217;s why,&#8221; Han Sen
      replied coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8230;&#8221; Zhou Yumei quickly got angry, wishing she could
      just bite Han Sen. But she knew she couldn&#8217;t compete with him,
      despite her desire for him to escort her out of that place.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Big Brother, if I offended you earlier—in any capacity—it was
      because of how young and reckless I was back then. Could you find it in
      your heart to forgive me?&#8221; Zhou Yumei held onto the urge to try to
      strangle Han Sen. She hovered around him in a cute pose, smiling fondly
      towards him as she spoke.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay, I forgive you.&#8221; Han Sen nodded.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brilliant! Then come on, let&#8217;s go. I&#8217;ll pay you back
      once we&#8217;re free from this place. When should we head out?&#8221;
      Zhou Yumei had been driven slightly mad, after being here all alone for so
      long.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans desired and required social correspondence, and they always lived
      together. She, however, had been stuck in this place for over a year all
      by herself. If it wasn&#8217;t for the presence of Little Orange, she
      would most likely have been driven completely insane. Although her initial
      encounter with Han Sen had been a bad one, her desire for contact with
      someone else—no matter who that was—overcame her wrath. That was why she
      had made the decision to stay.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was afraid of being alone once more, and even if it was with a bad
      person or a person she would incessantly argue with, it was better than
      being alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I told you I forgave you, didn&#8217;t I? I didn&#8217;t say
      I&#8217;d take you out of this place,&#8221; Han Sen calmly told her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8230; what do you want?&#8221; Zhou Yumei almost fainted in
      anger, and her finger trembled as she pointed it at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nothing. I just don&#8217;t want to commit to the effort of getting
      you out of here,&#8221; Han Sen told her, drinking his beverage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Saving people was a good thing, but it was more often than not a
      troublesome task. If he brought Zhou Yumei out with him now, the Zhou
      family would most likely be made aware of the connection he had with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he didn&#8217;t bring Zhou Yumei, perhaps the Zhou family would hate
      him for it. If Han Sen tried escorting her away, and something was to
      happen to her while she was in his hands, the Zhou family would be out for
      his blood, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the Zhou family would be understanding, but with what he had
      recently been embroiled in, he wanted to be more careful. He would rather
      have her see him as a bad guy, than end up in trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Zhou Yumei followed him, he would have liked to bring her along. If
      something did happen through such a circumstance, perhaps the Zhou family
      would not treat him as a foe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei was fuming mad, but she knew there was nothing she could do.
      She couldn&#8217;t beg, fight, or do anything for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Zhou Yumei&#8217;s eyes drifted to the snacks Han Sen had
      brought with him. She suddenly grabbed the bag and ran. While she ran off
      she said, &#8220;You drank all my beverages; this is payment for
      that!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei quickly jumped on top of Little Orange and presented Han Sen
      with an ugly face. She pulled the drinks and snacks out of the rucksack
      and shouted to Han Sen, &#8220;Since you aren&#8217;t going to make an
      effort to bring me away from this place, I&#8217;m going eat all the
      snacks envisioning they are you!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei imagined the snacks were Han Sen, and so she ripped, tore, and
      bit into them to release her anger.
    </p>

    <p>
      It had been a long time since she last ate and drank like that. Once her
      belly had been stuffed and she couldn&#8217;t eat anymore, she went to
      sleep atop Little Orange.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Zhou Yumei next woke up, she noticed Han Sen and the silver fox were
      gone. She thought Han Sen had returned to the Alliance for a while and
      would come back shortly, but after he had disappeared for a whole day, she
      began to get worried.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had previously asked her what points of interests there were in
      the area, and she had informed him of a black mountain that wasn&#8217;t
      too far off. That mountain was inhabited by a strange Twin-Tail Purple
      Scorpion. It was a creature that even Little Orange was afraid of, and was
      most likely a fearsome super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen heard of a lonely super creature out there, he had shown a
      feverish desire to slay it. If it was a second-generation super creature,
      that would have been the icing on the cake he very much desired.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the directions Zhou Yumei gave him, Han Sen had to walk one
      hundred miles to just about see the mountain in the distance. The mountain
      did not have a sharpened peak, and was more like a rolling mountain range.
      It was strange to see mountains lined up like so, out in a place such as
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen rode his Golden Growler towards the mountain, and with the silver
      fox by his side, all the other creatures that inhabited the area hid. The
      creatures he did see, however, were not grouped as he expected.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Black Desert was very unique in this aspect, as most of the creatures
      that inhabited this place tended to be alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t long before he began his ascent of the black mountains. He
      managed to detect the life force he had been searching for and hurried his
      Golden Growler up the slopes. Eventually, he laid eyes on the Twin-Tail
      Purple Scorpion, which he found wandering the foothills of the mountain.
      It was fervently digging into the sand.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were many black rocks in the hole it dug, and it was a trying task
      for it to remove them. The Twin-Tail Purple Scorpion was one meter deep,
      but Han Sen could not guess what it may have been searching for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to observe the twin-tail scorpion&#8217;s strange behavior
      for a little while longer, so he did not summon his little angel to
      immediately attack the fiend. For a better view, he climbed atop a ten
      meter tall boulder and then resumed watching the scorpion digging up the
      rocks. He had become quite keen.
    </p>

    <p>
      While watching, he opened his gene lock with the Dongxuan Sutra to observe
      its energy flow and assert whether or not it was a second-generation super
      creature as he had hoped it to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was disappointed, however. The energy inside the scorpion was all
      blurred, and he could not watch the energy flow properly, which meant it
      was only a first-generation super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since it was only a first-generation super creature, all he could hope for
      by defeating it was a beast soul. The Life Geno essences weren&#8217;t
      useful to him, and only fronted a monetary value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t want to sell too many Life Geno essences, either, as
      they tended to make others jealous. The entire Alliance was currently
      focusing on him like starved beggars admiring a spit roast. Unsure of what
      others were thinking, Han Sen thought it was best to maintain as low a
      profile as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if I can get a beast soul, at least.&#8221; Han Sen
      stared at the twin-tail scorpion, knowing that the chances of obtaining a
      beast soul were low no matter which way it was cut. He had calculated
      that, even with his own luck, the drop-rate for a beast soul was only
      around fifty percent.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was still quite curious, and he was keen to learn what the
      scorpion was doing. It continued to dig into the black rocks beneath, and
      by now, it had dug three meters into the ground without slowing down.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this guy a little too thirsty, maybe? Perhaps it&#8217;s trying
      to get some water?&#8221; Han Sen said this in half jest, because he knew
      that super creatures did not need to eat or drink to survive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only certain special super creatures or pregnant super creatures would
      occasionally eat. But even still, he had never seen them drink water.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is it doing?&#8221; Han Sen had a strange feeling while
      observing this.
