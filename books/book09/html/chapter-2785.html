	<p>The white phoenix fires ravaged the wound. This injury was so small that it clearly mattered little to Sky Vine
		Radish and his god body, but to Han Sen, it was a very important step on the path to taking down Sky Vine Radish
		completely. If he was unable to harm the god body at all, how could he even think about killing a god?</p>

	<p>Han Sen had now focused his awareness on the phoenix flame that the phoenix had given him. He had originally
		wanted to get rid of it, but he hadn’t expected that the phoenix flame used in conjunction with the phoenix
		feather would unleash such devastating power. It was able to slice open a god’s body.</p>

	<p>But right now, Han Sen didn’t have the time to sit idly by and think through all the ramifications of what he had
		just done. He continued to swing his phoenix feather with the ferocity of a furious stormcloud. Sword lights
		flew everywhere, slashing here and there across Sky Vine Radish’s god body. As Han Sen cut Sky Vine Radish again
		and again, the flow of blood increased.</p>

	<p>“Stop or I will bury you!” Sky Vine Radish bellowed angrily.</p>

	<p>Han Sen ignored the warning. He kept slashing Sky Vine Radish’s god body without relenting. He let the god blood
		splatter him.</p>

	<p>“This is blasphemy against god! Your sons and your grandsons and the rest of your filthy race will be cursed now
		and forever! Great disaster will fall upon you!”</p>

	<p>Sky Vine Radish released an enraged roar into the sky, but over time, it slowly turned into a scream. And still,
		he couldn’t move. Han Sen continued to slash the god body like a madman.</p>

	<p>Although each slash only cut a little bit into the god’s flesh, after Han Sen slashed his enemy 1000 times, then
		10000 times, he was able to open Sky Vine Radish’s flesh to the bone. God blood poured out.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>As Sky Vine Radish’s voice kept up an unending stream of curses and profanity, Han Sen lost count of how many
		times he had slashed the god. But before long, he was able to lop the god’s head off.</p>

	<p>That big jade head fell to the ground, creating a big crater in the earth when it landed. The jade skull’s face
		was turned up toward the sky. The eyes that had been closed were now finally open. They glared at Han Sen right
		before the head shouted, “Gods can never die! Today, you have destroyed my god body, but I will ensure that your
		sons and your grandsons pay me back millions and billions of times more. All the women in your race will become
		whores, and all the men will become slaves.”</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>Han Sen thrust his feather sword into the god’s eye, blinding it. God blood sprayed up like a freshwater spring,
		splattering all over Han Sen’s body.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had nothing to be afraid of. Han Sen knew that his family was meant to fight these gods. He would not be
		intimidated by the empty threat of some ominous curse.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had seen how Sky Vine Radish treated the Flower Gods, so he knew that the gods never treated the people
		of the universe as equals. Gods thought of the people in this universe as little more than livestock. They would
		kill and eat the people that Han Sen knew for nutrition.</p>

	<p>“If gods can eat people, then why can’t people eat gods? Today, I, Han Sen, will be the first person to dine on
		the flesh of a god.” Han Sen licked the god blood around his lips. It felt as hot as boiling water.</p>

	<p>“Deified Gene +1… God Body Evolution +1…”</p>

	<p>“Just one drop of blood can raise my tally by one whole deified gene… No wonder you are considered a god.” Han
		Sen looked at his fallen enemy with disdain. He didn’t stop moving his sword. He kept slashing the corpse over
		and over. Every slash parted flesh and broke bones.</p>

	<p>There was a reason that these gods were creatures of legend. Even with a heavily damaged body, it was still so
		strong. Its strength was difficult to comprehend. Han Sen had decapitated the creature and perforated its heart,
		but he still couldn’t kill it.</p>

	<p>“I don’t believe you can still live if I wholly dismember your god body.” Han Sen continued to hack his way
		through the creature’s flesh. He made sure to consume the blood that sprayed him.</p>

	<p>It was like he was swallowing lava into his belly. Han Sen felt as if his entire body was on fire. It was so hot,
		he wanted to take off his skin just to cool down a little.</p>

	<p>“Deified Gene +1… Deified Gene +1…”</p>

	<p>The announcements kept adding up. A single drop of god blood granted a deified gene. The body of a god could
		bring an unimaginable bounty of wealth to someone like Han Sen.</p>

	<p>“God evolution 100%… can evolve…”</p>

	<p>Finally, Han Sen heard the announcement that he had been waiting for. But he didn’t have the time to evolve right
		now. He was determined to kill Sky Vine Radish and do it soon. He couldn’t give the monster any chance to
		reassemble itself and regain its fighting strength.</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>Han Sen had been cutting his way through Sky Vine Radish’s giant skeleton, but his blade had come up against a
		bone that it couldn’t cut through. The other bones had snapped with relative ease, but he couldn’t even leave a
		mark on this one.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was shocked, and he leaned closer to the bone to get a better look. Han Sen didn’t understand much about
		how these god bodies worked, but it was clear that this bone didn’t resemble any of the structures in a human
		body.</p>

	<p>The bone snaked its way around the heart and lungs like a crooked vine. It was green, and it was only two meters
		long. A bone like that, in a giant god body like Sky Vine Radish’s, was truly tiny. Interestingly, the bone was
		shaped differently than the rest of the god’s skeleton, as well.</p>

	<p>Although most of the bones looked like they were made of a green stone, this one was rather transparent. Inside
		that bone, it looked like there were strange symbols floating. The bone seemed like something out of a dream,
		some mysterious item that could exist only in Han Sen’s imagination.</p>

	<p>“Let’s make a deal. If you stop this, I can help you conquer the universe…” Sky Vine Radish’s voice quivered with
		something that resembled fear.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>Han Sen acted as if he hadn’t heard Sky Vine Radish. He slashed at the bone that connected the giant’s heart and
		lungs, and it was sliced open.</p>

	<p>“Argh!” Sky Vine Radish screamed like his heart was being ripped out and his lungs torn open. He hadn’t even
		moaned when his head was cut off, but now, he was squealing like a pig.</p>

	<p>“That must have been your weak spot.” Han Sen grinned in delight. He swung his phoenix feather at the strange
		bone even faster. Every slash struck the tether between the bones, the flesh, and the organs. He cut that tether
		slowly.</p>

	<p>Sky Vine Radish kept screaming and cursing Han Sen, but Han Sen remained undeterred. Han Sen might obey God, but
		not this sort of god.</p>

	<p>“You will die!” Sky Vine Radish suddenly screamed when he saw that Han Sen was on the verge of slicing through
		the strange bone. His god body flashed with a green light. His flesh began to glow like superheated steel.</p>

	<p>“Oh, no!” Han Sen suddenly understood what Sky Vine Radish was doing. The god knew that he didn’t stand a chance
		against Han Sen, so he was going to self-destruct.</p>

	<p>Han Sen couldn’t stop the god from self-destructing, so he pushed himself to strike even faster with his sword.
		He wanted to dig out the bone before the monster blew itself up.</p>

	<p>But Sky Vine Radish’s body detonated far too quickly, and Han Sen didn’t have enough time to cut the strange bone
		free. A scary power suddenly exploded from Sky Vine Radish’s god body. It was like a nuclear bomb going off.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>At the top of the Space Garden, a green light shot into the sky like a volcanic eruption. Once it entered the
		sky, it spread out and began to shower the area. The light rain rained down across the flower fields, and the
		xenogeneic plants that touched the light rain started to grow at an accelerated rate. The whole of the Space
		Garden changed. It was like the sky and the earth had been flipped.</p>

	<p>Han Sen exited his super god spirit mode, and then, he heard the announcement play in his head.</p>

	<p>“Killed God Spirit. Obtained God Spirit. Found God Spirit Gene.”</p>
