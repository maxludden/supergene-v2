Han Sen was wandering aimlessly on the streets. He looked forward and saw a Buddha woman in the midst of a crowd. She was clad in white robes, and her eyebrows were like those of a painting as she smiled at Han Sen.

“Speechless Buddha Lady?” Han Sen was shocked.

“Mister Han! If you want, I can guide you around the Buddha Kingdom.” Speechless Buddha Lady came before Han Sen and spoke to him.

“Yes, please,” Han Sen said.

It was impossible to escape from the Buddha in Buddha Kingdom. Han Sen had nothing better to do, and she was freely offering to guide him, so he wasn’t going to say no. And that aside, Speechless was pretty to look at.

Then please follow me. I won’t let you down.” Speechless smiled at Han Sen and then started walking.

Han Sen felt strange. There were many people in the city, but it didn’t seem as if anyone recognized Speechless. He wondered why no one gave him peculiar looks.

Speechless knew what Han Sen was thinking, though. She smiled and said, “The Buddha aren’t very interested in celebrity. I rarely go out with my rank on display.”

“That’s why?” Han Sen nodded, and then asked, “Is there anywhere special I can visit? I’m sure you know the most interesting landmarks around here.”

You can call me Speechless, by the way.” Speechless paused and then said, “I don’t think ordinary relics would interest you, but there is a Buddha Wall that resides four hundred miles from here. It is a place that was visited by a half-deified Buddha King. You should take a look, sir.”

“Call me Han Sen. Being called sir is strange.” Han Sen smiled.

Speechless Buddha Lady nodded and spoke about the origin of the Happy Buddha Wall. She spoke well, and she was pretty to boot. It wasn’t a boring listen.

The Happy Buddha Wall was not created by Happy Buddha King. It was a student that drew an image of Happy Buddha King across that wall. That was how it came to be known as Happy Buddha Wall.

Happy Buddha King was a very famous half-deified person, but he left a long time ago. His name was still commonly heard in the city, though, and he was a figure that was most well-known.

The student that drew his image was not any ordinary person, either. He was a legendary fellow.

Out of the higher races, the Buddha society included the most outsiders. In the Buddha Kingdom, only one percent of its people were full-blooded Buddha. The rest were outsiders, and many of them were quite famous.

Some of the famous outsiders were even Kings.

The person that drew Happy Buddha King was an outsider Duke named Silla. That person admired Happy Buddha King a great deal, so they wished to draw him a portrait.

There were many different stories. Silla met with Happy Buddha King ten times with the offer, and each time Silla was rejected. The eleventh time, however, Happy Buddha King allowed Silla to proceed. The Happy Buddha Wall was the result.

Before finishing the drawing, Silla practiced for three years straight in complete isolation. When Silla returned, Silla did so as a King. Silla eventually went on to become half-deified, as well.

There was a saying amongst the Buddha: Silla King was a famous King, but just like Happy Buddha King, history forgot them. All people now knew was the remnant of the Happy Buddha Wall.

Han Sen liked the story, and when it came to a close, they were on Sky Cliff. That was where the wall was.

Han Sen thought that the place, due to its sacred importance, would be well-protected. But there was not even a railing, and they were able to come right before the wall.

The Happy Buddha Wall was drawn on the cliffside. It was at least ten meters high. It looked rather strange.

Han Sen looked at the Happy Buddha Wall from far away. He wondered, “I thought this was an image of Happy Buddha King. Why are there two Buddha’s painted on the wall? Which one is he?”

The wall portrayed a Buddha sitting upon a lotus flower, smiling. But there was also a Buddha lady next to the Buddha. She was holding his neck, and they were locked in a kiss.

Speechless smiled and said, “I thought there were a lot of gods in the beliefs of the Rebate. Happy Buddha King is our lover god. Happy Buddha King is called Ming King, and the Buddha lady there is Ming’s wife. They were both deified, and forever together. They were both called Happy Buddha King.”

“I see.” Han Sen may have said that, but inside, he thought, “Isn’t this like a combination of two? I thought it was just one King, but it was in fact a horny old man and his woman.”

“Nothing is sense, and sense is not nothing. Nothing is not sense. Where the senses are, is where the Buddha are.” Speechless spoke to Han Sen seriously.

“I don’t understand this. It seems as if I am not suitable enough for the Buddha.” Han Sen smiled.

Speechless smiled and said, “I cannot tell you if this is suitable for you, but perhaps by looking at the wall, you may learn a thing or two. When Silla drew this picture, Silla King learned of what it meant to be happy. The happiness is inside this very wall. If this is your fate, then you will learn something, also.”

Han Sen examined the Happy Buddha Wall, but could not learn anything. He gave a wry smile and said, “It seems as if I am not suitable for the Buddha, as I am unable to glean anything.”

“I have a way for you to see it, but I will have to help you. Are you willing to try this?” Speechless’ beautiful eyes peered right through Han Sen.

“If you are willing to help, then of course.” Han Sen smiled.

“Okay, then look into my eyes. Tell me what it is that you see.” Speechless smiled at Han Sen, as her eyes began to show some form of movement.

Han Sen looked at her eyes, but her eyes were too pretty. It was difficult to describe how beautiful they were. They were crystal-clear, and looking at them made people want to stare in awe.

Han Sen felt like his vision was becoming sucked into her own. Within the reflection of her eyes, he clearly saw himself. But the shadow was so strange, and he saw himself naked. He wore nothing in front of Speechless Buddha Lady.

*Boom!*

Han Sen felt as if he had just been shot in the head. So many thoughts rushed to his mind all at once, many of which made him blush.

Speechless’ eyes continued looking at Han Sen. They became watery, and she looked at Han Sen strangely.
