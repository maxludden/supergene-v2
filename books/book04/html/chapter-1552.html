    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to kill the little Ice Seahorse, but Bao’er seemed to like
      it. This prompted him to drop the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never thought the chimenea would bear a creature like that. I wonder
      what it is,” Jade Little Lion said.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s alive, so it cannot be the relic.” Little Fairy looked annoyed.</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know if it is the relic or not, but it would be best if we don’t
      provoke it. The Black Seahorses are super creatures, but it can snare them
      with those chains with ease. They were completely unable to resist. The
      creature in the chimenea must be strong. I don’t think we can fight it,”
      Han Sen said, and then walked forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was of the same mind. Giving up on the chimenea, they then opted
      to try somewhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Ice Seahorse followed after Bao’er. At first, the creature
      missed its group of seahorses, but after a while of playing with Bao’er,
      its mood turned happy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen spent the next few days traversing the ruins, but he couldn’t find
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen did not care too much if he did not get a reward for
      the current endeavors, as he was spending a lot of time practicing the
      skill he learned from the Destiny’s Tower. Once he was done, he was going
      to return there with Starsea Beast and see if he could take the treasure
      out of the tower with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ( .c om ) The seven items in there had the possibility of being the relics
      that they were all seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy and the others searched in the ruins, as well. Han Sen, in
      the meantime, just took it for a nice trip and nothing more. He didn’t
      expect to find anything else that was decent.
    </p>
    <p>
      One particular day, after two weeks of traveling and searching, everything
      seemed to be the same for Han Sen. He sat on Starsea Beast’s back and
      practiced the skill he was in the midst of learning. But suddenly, he felt
      his Life Door shake, and the pumping of his blood accelerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood in his body wasn’t being driven by his heart anymore. Its rush
      was sustained by the Life Door now. And with each fresh pump, new changes
      came along with it. It was a brand-new cycle, and it brought changes to
      the way Han Sen’s body operated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The changes did not just apply to his blood. The blood was simply the
      catalyst for everything else. Han Sen’s cells and genes were undergoing
      direct changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s appearance mostly did not change. All the changes were internal,
      save for his black eyes that became red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from his eye color, though, Han Sen seemed exactly the same. There
      were a lot of changes to his insides, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if his bones and flesh had been wholly rebuilt. His entire
      body actually felt much heavier, by a few multiples. And yet, his body and
      bones were like a bird’s. His blood was not carried by vessels, as it was
      directly entwined with his bones and flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      These changes made Han Sen’s body feel far more sensitive. He was able to
      control himself better, and even his base power seemed to be much
      stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen looked at Starsea Beast and Jade Little Lion, though, he was
      given a shock. His vision had been altered with his new red eyes. With
      that red vision, Han Sen could see the blood that coursed through their
      bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or at least, that was what Han Sen thought at first. After a closer
      examination, Han Sen noticed it wasn’t the blood he was observing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the blood was flowing, then its course must have been dictated by the
      heart. But this was not what Han Sen saw. A red force was inside their
      bodies, just flowing, and there was a saturation depicted in different
      areas on them. There was no set route to the flow he was seeing.
    </p>
    <p>“Is that their lifeforce?” Han Sen guessed, although he was not sure.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to get a closer look, but he felt a pain in his head and
      his body started to twitch. It was like he was getting stabbed by a number
      of needles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen stopped the skill immediately, and when he did that, the pain and
      needle-like sensation went away immediately. The changes in his body
      reverted back to how they were before he practiced the skill, and the
      blood began pumping from his heart, just like it used to.
    </p>
    <p>
      ( .c om ) Han Sen could feel his body was now rather weak, and he thought
      to himself, “This skill costs a lot of energy. I only had it activated for
      a few minutes, and already my body felt as if it was on the verge of
      collapsing. I wonder what my strength is like when I use this
      transformative skill? And was the red flow I saw their lifeforce?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen rested for the next half-day. His body soon returned to normal,
      and there were no lasting effects or issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s time to go back to the white metal tower to collect the treasure
      there.” Han Sen had also thought of a way in which he might get Little
      Fairy and Jade Little Lion out of his hair for a time. He told them it
      would be best to split up and search separately. So, Han Sen ended up just
      bringing Bao’er, Little Silver, and Little Star with him to the white
      tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little Ice Seahorse followed Bao’er, determined not to leave. As a
      result, Han Sen had no choice but to allow him to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Little Lion was still, by all accounts, an outsider. And Little Fairy
      could be a touch suspicious. As a result, he didn’t want them to come with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starsea Beast brought Han Sen to a glacier mountain, the one that was
      populated by deadly flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starsea Beast was super class, and casting its traveling skill no longer
      cost it as much energy. It brought Han Sen right to the doorstep of the
      white tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was excited, and he hastily threw the door open. He scrambled up
      to the top floor and saw the seven pedestals of treasure were still intact
      and untouched. He breathed a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like God’s Retribution really couldn’t learn the skill. If he
      could, he would have come back here before me. Either that, or he can
      learn it and just hasn’t finished yet,” Han Sen thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the seven treasures sitting neatly on the stone pedestals, Han Sen
      cast the skill. His body engaged with all those weird changes again, and
      then he reached his hand out to see if he could go past the Space-Vortex
      Shield and grab the treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did this very carefully. His hand approached the prizes slowly.
      But when his nails brushed the end of the platform, the tips of his
      fingernails disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s face changed. He pulled his hand back and said, “This skill
      doesn’t even let me go past the Space-Vortex Shield?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had spent a lot of effort in coming here, and after all that, this
      was the result. It was dismal, and it sent a chill running through his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this happened, though, Han Sen heard a loud sound come from outside. It
      rocked the construct itself. Then, he heard the crying noises that were
      all too familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen’s face changed. He went up to the window and pushed it open.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked down from there, and it was just as he thought. Eleven
      Black Seahorses were situated right outside Destiny’s Tower. They were
      blocking the entrance, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eleven Black Seahorses repeatedly cried at the tower, making extremely
      loud screaming noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shit! Those Black Seahorses are really p*ssed, and they even brought the
      chimenea with them. If I knew they’d come after me, I wouldn’t have
      brought the little Ice Seahorse.” Han Sen thought the Black Seahorses had
      come there to rescue the small creature. The notion made him feel
      depressed.
