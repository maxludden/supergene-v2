<p>Littleflower climbed up and looked at the beast at the end of
his bed. He was curious.</p>
<p>The beast stood up and walked around him, observing, all the
while smiling. The beast was Old Cat. When the sanctuary gate was
open, he had managed to sneak back in. Everyone was focusing on the
xenogeneic monster and officer; no one had seen the cat sneak
inside.</p>
<p>“You are Littleflower?” Old Cat walked around some more before
sitting down in front of Littleflower. He looked at the child and
smiled.</p>
<p>Littleflower nodded, and with curiosity, he asked, “Are you a
cat?”</p>
<p>Old Cat had a cold sweat His mouth twitched, but he still said,
“Littleflower, would you like to play a game?”</p>
<p>“No.” Littleflower shook his head.</p>
<p>“Why not? It’ll be fun.” Old Cat looked depressed.</p>
<p>“Mom told me not to bully animals.” Littleflower spoke with
seriousness.</p>
<p>Old Cat almost choked. He rolled his eyes and pulled out an item
before him. He said, “Littleflower, if you win this game, I will
give this to you.”</p>
<p>Littleflower looked at it carefully. It was a beautiful gemstone
like a fist. A lovely-looking smoke or mist enshrouded it Seeing
Littleflower show no interest, Old Cat said, “How about this, then?
If you simply play with me, I’ll give this to you.” But
Littleflower shook his head. “Mom said I shouldn’t accept gifts
from strangers.”</p>
<p>Old Cat wanted to grind his teeth, but he quickly scrambled to
say, “Then we should play the game. If you win, it’s yours.”</p>
<p>Littleflower looked at the gemstone, and then looked at Old Cat.
He blinked and said, “If I win, can I not have the gemstone? Can I
have a doll instead?”</p>
<p>“What doll?” Old Cat did not know what Littleflower was talking
about.</p>
<p>Littleflower looked at Old Cat and asked, “Aren’t you an Al
doll?”</p>
<p>“You are the doll. You’re all dolls!” Old Cat was angered by the
question, and he resisted the urge to punch Littleflower. He forced
himself to present a smile and said, “Okay, but only if you
win.”</p>
<p>“Great! Let’s play the game, then.” Littleflower clapped.</p>
<p>Old Cat, hearing that Littleflower finally wanted to play,
sighed. He touched his body and pulled out a box.</p>
<p>“Are you a doraemon?” Littleflower asked Old Cat, his eyes
wide.</p>
<p>Old Cat ignored the question and simply opened the box. There
was a book inside it.</p>
<p>Old Cat brought the book out and flipped it open to the first
page. There was a picture on it, of a human body in a strange
position. There were a lot of green and red dots. It was a
complicated image.</p>
<p>“Littleflower, here is the game. You have to copy my posture. If
you can, you win.” Old Cat squinted and smiled.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Littleflower nodded.</p>
<p>“Watch carefully, then,” Old Cat said, then assumed a strange
position, in accordance to the book.</p>
<p>The animation inside the book looked weird, and the fact that it
was being done by a cat made it even stranger.</p>
<p>Littleflower looked at Old Cat and imitated him. For
Littleflower, it wasn’t difficult, as he had a very bendy body.</p>
<p>“Try and breathe like me,” Old Cat said. He kept the position,
but started breathing with a strange rhythm.</p>
<p>Littleflower followed, and it was no big deal.</p>
<p>Old Cat looked quite happy, so he flipped to the second page and
said, “You did that? Wow! Let’s try the next.”</p>
<p>Old Cat followed the instructions in the book, and animated
himself in the positions demonstrated. Littleflower thought it was
funny, but he followed and found it to be fun, putting himself in
various positions.</p>
<p>Old Cat started to feel happy, but as more and more animations
were done, he eventually became shocked. He was frozen with the
surprise.</p>
<p>Littleflower was able to follow perfectly, all with the greatest
of ease.</p>
<p>“No way! Is he super lucky or can he really just learn all of
this?” Old Cat felt so shaky, he had trouble flipping the pages of
the book with his claws.</p>
<p>As he did more animations, Littleflower followed suit without
flaw. The movements and rhythms were precise, and he had no trouble
doing as instructed.</p>
<p>Old Cat was happy, but he also had a thought. “If Littleflower
learns everything, I’m going to lose.”</p>
<p>Old Cat didn’t actually plan on losing, though. He wanted
Littleflower to try out a few animations so he could see if the
child was talented, that’s all. But it was no longer about a test
of talent. As Old Cat flipped through the book, he knew that
Littleflower was going to become something amazing in time.</p>
<p>There were only three pages left, and nothing had challenged
Littleflower yet. It didn’t seem as if it was difficult at all for
the child to learn the positions.</p>
<p>“Oh no! It is no wonder the monster in Sky Palace wants him.
This is very weird.” Old Cat clenched his jaws and finished off the
final three animations.</p>
<p>Littleflower had trouble doing them, but only a small amount. He
was still able to complete them.</p>
<p>“Cat doll, you lose!” Littleflower looked right at Old Cat. He
wasn’t stupid, and he knew Old Cat had been following the book, and
now there were no fresh pages left to do.</p>
<p>Old Cat was a little mad, but shock was the reigning
emotion.</p>
<p>Littleflower did not know what the book was about, but Old Cat
did. It demonstrated breathing techniques, and very few people
could actually copy its teachings.</p>
<p>“There is one more animation. If you can do this, then I lose.”
Old Cat laughed.</p>
<p>After Old Cat spoke, he assumed a position. It was not from the
book, but it didn’t look difficult and Littleflower thought he
would perform it with ease.</p>
<p>But when Old Cat assumed the posture, he spat out some air that
became a purple swordlight in front of him.</p>
<p>“If you can learn that, then and only then will I admit defeat.
I won’t be just your doll. I’d accept you as my grandpa.” Old Cat
was very cocky about this.</p>
<p>Although Littleflower knew the movements thus far, they were all
things he could copy. Learning something like what Old Cat had just
done could take years. You couldn’t just generate a sword on a
whim.</p>
<p>But the next second, Old Cat was shocked. Littleflower opened
his mouth, and a swordlight appeared in front of him.</p>
