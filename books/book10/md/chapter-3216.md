Han Sen absorbed the Extreme King prince’s water origin, so he was no stranger to water powers. His movement in the water was not negatively affected. He looked like a fish that had been given water.

Wan’er was not affected by the rainbow liquid either. Like a ghost, she pursued Han Sen.

“I wonder where the guarding temple of the second sky lies,” Han Sen thought.

In Soldier Knife Sky, Han Sen had to pull out the Inch Grey Sword to surprise Weapon God. Otherwise, Soldier Knife Sky was so big that Weapon God would not have known that he and his crew had entered Soldier Knife Sky without doing so.

Han Sen used Galaxy Teleportation to keep moving through the water. Even if he was unable to find a god temple, finding the way that would lead to the third sky was fine too.

Han Sen thought the suppressing god temple of each realm would likely be the exit point.

His Galaxy Teleportation came to an end. Han Sen suddenly felt his body get stuck by something. He looked around but did not see a creature. There was still liquid everywhere. He was in a portion of the sea that had purple liquid.

Han Sen had a closer look and noticed what the problem was. The purple liquid was shaped like a giant whale. He had gotten stuck inside the whale’s brain.

Perhaps it was because Han Sen was there, but the whale-shaped purple liquid started to move. It swung its tail and started to swim. It looked like a real whale even though it was a purple liquid whale. “In this water world sky, all the creatures seem to be liquid creatures.” Han Sen now fully understood.

The purple liquid whale had just begun to swim when gold light started to shine. The whale’s body was cut by the gold light. A lot of purple liquid started to leak out everywhere.

Han Sen was too late to use Galaxy Teleportation because he was stuck. He could no longer escape, so he had to draw his Inch Grey Sword. He generated Break World power to stop the gold light.

Dong! The gold light struck the Inch Grey Sword. Han Sen felt the unstoppable power coming at him. It was like he had been hit by a bullet train. His body was like a spring as he flew away.

Fortunately, the Inch Grey Sword was very weird. It did not break because of the gold light. On top of that, Han Sen was very good when it came to borrowing the powers of others and using them for himself. With that power flying at him, he took it and made the knockback send him further.

Han Sen thought, “Escaping like that is not the most ideal method. If I cannot make Wan’er focus on the God Chaos Party, I will be unable to escape her.”

While he was thinking, he saw a weird building come lurching through the depths of the water. It was a crystal-like palace in the midst of the water world. It was not touching the sky or touching the ground. It was just floating in the water.

Han Sen looked at it. The signboard of the palace had three words written on it: “Liquid God Temple.”

“The guardian here is not a water god. It’s a liquid god. I wonder what the difference between a water god and a liquid god is.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He rushed toward the Liquid God Temple and threw a punch at its door.

Pang!

Han Sen’s Break World power was not an attacking power, but Liquid God Temple’s door and the small hall beyond was broken.

“Who broke my god temple?” An angry voice sounded from within the god temple. Han Sen did not bother looking at who it was. He just used Galaxy Teleportation to go behind the god temple.

“Let’s allow this Liquid God to see Wan’er,” Han Sen said in silent prayer. Perhaps it was because Han Sen had not done anything bad recently, but God should have surely realized Han Sen was well-behaved. He thought there was a fair chance God would enable things to go his way.

Liquid God stormed out of the god temple. He saw Wan’er, who was pursuing Han Sen. He thought it was Wan’er who had destroyed his temple, so he immediately flung his tentacles toward the lady.

Liquid God looked very weird. He kind of looked like an octopus or a jellyfish. His body was transparent like water. He had many tentacles and rainbow-like liquid flowing around him.

Upon seeing Liquid God’s tentacles go to snare and tie her up, Wan’er’s body blazed with gold fire. It was like a sharp blade that was going to cut up Liquid God’s tentacles.

“Naive. Liquid cannot be attacked. It is everywhere. No kind of attack can do anything to me.” Before Liquid God could say anything else, his body was turned into nothing by the gold fire. There was not even a drop of water left.

The shiny god light was still there though. It turned the crystal-like Liquid God Temple into nothing.

The entire god temple was incinerated. Not even a god base remained.

Han Sen was terrified. His Super God Spirit mode had invincibility. His attacks were always improved with it, but it was nothing compared to what she was able to do.

Obviously, Wan’er’s power was aggressive. It was the opposite of Super God Spirit mode.

From now on, aside from the Inch Grey Sword in Han Sen’s hand, he did not think there was another item in existence that could shield him from an attack unleashed by Wan’er.

Bao’er had been sitting on Han Sen’s shoulder the entire time. She pointed forward as she said, “Dad, it looks like there is something at 11 o’clock.” Han Sen looked where she was pointing and saw a giant swirl manifest in the liquid of the realm. It was like a black hole. It conducted very strong movements in space. “Is that the entrance to the third sky?” Han Sen immediately rushed toward the vortex. Liquid God had just been delivered a nasty strike and killed by Wan’er.

After that, God Chaos Party was going to have a grudge with Wan’er. At this point, Han Sen’s plan to draw the disaster to the east had halfway succeeded.

While Han Sen was going to go to the third sky, in God Chaos Party’s headquarters, God Chaos Party’s core members and leaders opened a screen of light. It panned through Water World Sky.

A God Chaos Party member angrily stated, “Liquid God from the main headquarters is gone. Liquid God Temple is gone. Who dared do this to us?”

Another member of the God Chaos Party coldly said, “If I have guessed things correctly, the person has now entered the third sky. Let third sky’s Shadow God check the enemy out.”

“Contact Shadow God,” the leader said as he looked across the members before him.

The screen of light quickly displayed a circus-clown like God Spirit gene race. The clown took off its hat and bowed. “My Leader, what is it that you require?”

“An enemy has invaded Thirty-Three Days,” the leader said. “He will be in the third sky now.”

“Do you want the intruder dead or alive?” Shadow God politely asked with a weird smile. “Who dares stir up disasters in Thirty-Three Days?” God Chaos Party Leader coldly asked. “Whoever it is, I will not allow someone like that to exist.”

“I understand,” Shadow God said with a laugh. His eyes looked a bit evil. “Do not worry, Leader.”

“By the way, open your spirit light screen,” the leader said. “I want to watch you kill the invader.”

“OK, Leader. Await my performance with bated breath. I will not disappoint you.” Shadow God walked out of the god temple.
