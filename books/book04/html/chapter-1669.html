      After Han Sen returned to the shelter, he asked the Armored Man more about
      what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armored Man was very angry, and he had no way of releasing his rage. He
      started ranting, and Han Sen understood what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armored Man was a born-emperor that was actually called Inferno Skeleton
      Emperor. Ancient Devil destroyed his shelter and claimed his spirit stone.
      He had no choice but to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after submitting to the service of Ancient Devil, he was placed inside
      a chimenea. While imprisoned, he was burned with ice and fire for a very
      long time. Inferno Skeleton Emperor could not die inside the chimenea, but
      he had to endure incredible agony the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some urgent matter pulled Ancient Devil away, and he left. For a long
      time, it was only the guardian that was left there, so there was nothing
      Inferno Skeleton Emperor could do to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But despite all that, he still earned something after the ordeal. During
      the time he spent in the chimenea, the emperor’s body was reinforced. He
      also learned to command the powers of ice and fire, as well. When he
      gained control of the chimenea, he absorbed much more ice and fire. That
      was how he had made himself an overwhelming contender in Divinity’s Bout.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he could gain his revenge and go up against Ancient Devil, Han
      Sen claimed him and trapped him inside Destiny’s Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armored Man didn’t know much about Headless Rockman and Destiny’s Tower,
      but he knew that the feud between Headless Rockman and Ancient had been
      going on since before he was forced to serve Ancient Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing Han Sen learned, however, was that Ancient Devil was apparently
      afraid of Destiny’s Tower and Headless Rockman. And Ancient Devil was
      unable to defeat Headless Rockman who controlled it. When Inferno Skeleton
      Emperor was made free, so was Destiny’s Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inferno Skeleton Emperor knew that Ancient Devil was scared of Destiny’s
      Tower, so he wanted to take that tower with him in his pursuit of revenge.
      After trying many times, he finally managed to defeat Headless Rockman,
      but unfortunately, he did not receive the tower he had been so desperate
      for. Han Sen was the one who got it
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me out” Inferno Skeleton Emperor was raging. He hated Ancient Devil
      more than he hated Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen kept him within Destiny’s Tower because his struggles had weakened
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen ignored his repeated plight, but after a while, he said, “Although
      you are strong, you cannot beat Ancient Devil. But Ancient Devil, you
      said, could not kill Headless Rockman. Yet you managed to kill Headless
      Rockman. Perhaps he put you in the chimenea to strengthen you, so that he
      could use you to defeat the one opponent that he feared. Then, he could
      have Destiny’s Tower.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Inferno Skeleton Emperor froze. His eyes flared with an icy fire, and he
      said, “Regardless of what his purpose was, I have to get my revenge. I
      have to kill him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can have your revenge, but he’s not here right now. There is no point
      of you conning out. And even if you did find him, there is no way you
      could catch up with the beast he rides. Even I was unable to chase him,
      and you’re not very speed- efficient. Or at least I don’t think you are,”
      Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he heard that, Inferno Skeleton Emperor went silent. Then he got
      back to roaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait a bit. If the opportunity arises, I’ll let you get the revenge you
      seek.” Han Sen provided him a little comfort. There really was a chance he
      could be a useful half-ally further down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inferno Skeleton Emperor’s physical power was most certainly as good as
      Ancient Devil’s. His strength must have become quite impressive over the
      years. Unfortunately, his skills were too simple. If he did go up against
      a mysterious elite like Ancient Devil, things would turn awry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, Cheap Sheep appeared. He had come with a report, and he
      looked glum carrying it. He said a creature had just died inside the
      shelter. And now, all the creatures there were scared. No one knew who
      might be next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some creatures had even sneaked away from the shelter to escape, but their
      attempts hadn’t worked out. Elites were outside the shelter, so none of
      the escaping creatures made it very far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen called a meeting in the spirit hall to discuss how they should
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ancient Devil is scary, and we’re in a bad situation,” Gu Qingcheng said.
      “There is a limit to his power. He can kill one of us every day, but he
      won’t be able to select the target at will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Even so, that is bad. If he kills one of us a day, it won’t take long for
      everyone to die.” Cheap Sheep sounded scared, and he was one of the
      weakest there. He could be brought down with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you are afraid, go and obey Ancient Devil,” Han Sen told the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep jumped up and said, “What is that supposed to mean? I am your
      sheep, and I always will be: dead or alive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep wasn’t that loyal, though. There were so many people outside
      the shelter, he was just worried that if he did try to switch bosses, he’d
      be killed before he could explain himself. And right now, he thought Han
      Sen was just testing his loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen actually wanted Cheap Sheep could go and serve Ancient Devil as a
      boss. Perhaps there was a chance Ancient Devil could die before striking
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he knew there were too many elites out there, and Cheap Sheep was too
      weak to do much of anything. He’d probably be eaten before opening his
      mouth to speak. He wouldn’t even catch a glimpse of Ancient Devil’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a shame Ancient Sky Mirror’s power is limited. Otherwise, I would go
      and fight them, and kill as many of them as I can,” Tang Zhenliu said.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were talking, Green Cow barged into the meeting and said,
      “Boss! The enemy is coming; they are almost before our shelter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised by this. He looked at Gu Qingcheng, Lin Feng, and
      the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they were striking now, that meant they had found a way to ignore the
      Ancient Sky Mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If things go wrong, you guys all return to the Alliance. I’ll find a way
      to make it out of here,” Han Sen said to Lin Feng. Then, he ran out of the
      spirit hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky above the shelter was clouded by countless flying beasts, and
      creatures swarmed across the ground like the tumultuous waves of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were so many scary lifeforces to be seen amidst them. And in the
      front, there was Ancient Devil and Sacred’s leader. And there were many
      more spirits and creatures Han Sen did not know. But even without knowing,
      Han Sen could tell they were things to fear.
