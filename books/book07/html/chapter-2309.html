<p>Bai Canglang took his four guards with him as he marched away.
He turned hard eyes on Red Sleeve and said, “Who told you that you
could cast a deadly attack on Han Sen?”</p>
<p>“Maybe we can overlook the fact that Knife Queen rejected your
offer, but for that Duke to disobey your wishes? I just wanted to
make an example of what can happen to anyone who dares to cross
you,” Red Sleeve said as she lowered her head.</p>
<p>“I can take care of my own business. Don’t do that again, or
I’ll see to it that your life ends there.” Bai Canglang grunted
coldly, and then he said, “It was fortunate that you were unable to
kill him. Not even I would be able to pull enough strings to get
you pardoned for murdering someone in King’s Garden.”</p>
<p>“I was being reckless. Please punish me.” Red Sleeve quickly
bowed.</p>
<p>“Whatever. Just don’t do it again.” Bai Canglang waved his hand
and began to search for another primary root king dragon.</p>
<p>Because primary root king dragons showed up in different
locations every time, the royal children were forced to search a
new king dragon out every time they wanted to train. The only other
option was to never leave the king dragon, even when the tree
wasn’t releasing golden light.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bai Wei climbed back atop their primary root king
dragon. They waited there for another chance to be taken
underground.</p>
<p>Luckily, only the royal children were permitted to access the
King’s Garden, and there weren’t many of them. King Bai only had
one hundred children.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bai Wei had some luck. Aside from Bai Canglang, they
encountered no other royal children.</p>
<p>No one showed up over the next ten hours, and Han Sen thought
that their training might go smoothly. But then he noticed someone
flying quickly toward him.</p>
<p>“Bai Wuchang!” Han Sen said, startled by the man’s sudden
appearance. It was the same man he had met in the space
station.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang was clearly coming to see Han Sen. Bai Wei blanched
when she saw him coming, but by then it was too late to run.</p>
<p>“Han Sen. Why did you not come when I asked?” Bai Wuchang hung
in the air, staring down at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I never agreed to come.” Han Sen raised his hands as he
spoke.</p>
<p>When Bai Wucheng heard Han Sen, his face did not move a muscle.
His features were as still as stone, which gave him a great poker
face. “In that case, how about you and I fight right here?”</p>
<p>“I am Bai Wei’s guard, not some stadium gladiator. I will not
accept…” Before Han Sen could finish, Bai Wuchang swung his knife
at him.</p>
<p>“Shit! Is everyone in the Extreme King this unreasonable?” Han
Sen pulled out Ghost Teeth Knife to block Bai Wuchang’s sucker
strike.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The knives collided. Bai Wuchang was slashing downward, while
Han Sen was pushing up. Purple and white knife airs came against
each other. The knife airs broke and spread out everywhere.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen was standing atop the king dragon’s head, the
shattered knife air hit the primary root king dragon and woke up
the sleeping beast.</p>
<p>The primary root king dragon roared. Its body rose, and its
golden dragon scales shook as it swung its head.</p>
<p>The primary root king dragon couldn’t release its power, but
even its physical strength was terrifying. The power of its
head-swing was capable of breaking the fabric of space. It created
a teleportation and shadow effect, leaving behind afterimages of
its head as it moved.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Bai Wuchang, and Bai Wei were thrown off.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang barely seemed to notice. He slashed at Han Sen from
the air again.</p>
<p>His knife was like ice. The blade was very cold, but the power
it exuded seemed minimal. It didn’t unleash ice power. It was very
weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Ghost Teeth Knife came against Bai Wuchang’s knife
twice, and neither of them appeared to have an advantage over the
other. The primary root king dragon roared and tried to consume
them.</p>
<p>Han Sen flapped his wings and teleported. He wanted to get away
from that angry primary root king dragon, but Bai Wuchang
mindlessly rushed after him without a care in the world for
anything else.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang kept chasing him, and the king dragon kept trying to
consume them. It made Han Sen angry. He pushed his Jadeskin and
Blood-Pulse Sutra to the max. He focused on Bai Wuchang, who was
drawing near, and slashed towards him.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang was a Duke, too. Han Sen’s blow landed on him and
knocked him away. He fell a few thousand meters before he came to a
stop.</p>
<p>“Good! Good! Good! Now I see why you are considered to be on the
same level as Lone Bamboo. You did not disappoint me!” Bai Wuchang
wasn’t angry, but happy. He smiled.</p>
<p>But his face was way too stiff. The smile looked strangely
forced as a result. It made people feel uncomfortable whenever they
saw it.</p>
<p>While they were talking, a cold white air erupted from Bai
Wuchang’s body. The cold air turned into an icy fire that gave off
no heat.</p>
<p>With the cold fire burning, Bai Wuchang’s body started to look
transparent within his white armor. He was like a translucent
phantom.</p>
<p>“Phantom Ghost King Body! Han Sen, get back.” Bai Wei ran in
front of Han Sen and placed him behind her. She spoke to Bai
Wuchang, “Brother Wuchang! You are a prince. Attacking my Royal
Guard like this will damage your reputation. People like Han Sen
aren’t worthy of being your enemies.”</p>
<p>Bai Wei knew Bai Wuchang’s true capabilities. The king body of
an Extreme King was usually activated at King class.</p>
<p>It was one of the reasons that Bai Wei was looking forward to
King class.</p>
<p>This was true for all of the Extreme King, with the sole
exception that was Bai Wuchang. When he was a Viscount, his king
body awoke.</p>
<p>He was very talented. In the Extreme King, where everyone was so
rich and powerful, he was a genius of extreme rarity. He usually
didn’t need his king body to beat opponents of the same level,
though.</p>
<p>With his Phantom Ghost King Body, he could challenge King class
elites. Since Bai Wuchang had activated his Phantom Ghost King Body
against Han Sen, it was evident that he was taking this fight quite
seriously.</p>
<p>The rules of King’s Garden applied to all the royal children,
but Bai Wuchang didn’t seem to care. He was completely ignoring the
King’s Garden rule that forbade murder.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang’s eyes danced with excitement. It was as if he
didn’t see Bai Wei at all. He stared at Han Sen and said, “Come on!
Fight me!”</p>
<p>“Is this guy insane?” Han Sen sighed. He felt as if he was a
magnet for nutcases. Before, Barr wanted to kill him. And now, Bai
Wuchang. Han Sen wondered if there was something special about his
body that made him attract such crazed individuals.</p>
<p>Bai Wei started to say something, but Bai Wuchang was already
slashing downwards. In his eyes, it was as if she did not exist. He
came swinging at Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Bai Wei stayed in front of Han Sen. She was going to take
the blow instead.</p>
