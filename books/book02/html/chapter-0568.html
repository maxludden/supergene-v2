    <p>
      The battle was about to start. Han Sen gave his beast souls to the Snow
      Charmer to increase her power.
    </p>

    <p>
      The list of beast souls he gave her included the sacred-blood, Blood-Scale
      armor Han Sen received in exchange for the sword from earlier, a Gargoyle
      glyph, a Golden Roarer to ride, a Golden Rock Worm King, Berserk pet
      armor, Nightmare Wings, a Snow-Lady transfiguration beast soul, and a
      Desert Bird. The Snow Charmer would be able to take advantage of all those
      beast souls, and so Han Sen made sure to transfer them to her for her
      usage.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Snow Charmer used a lance, and Han Sen did not have a sacred-blood
      lance. This meant she would have to rely on her default weapon. However,
      her opponent would be another royal spirit, and so her Ice-Blood Lance was
      sure to deal decent damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the arena, the Demon was already there. It was a two-meter tall
      warrior, plated in black armor and wielding a greatsword. It was no
      ordinary-looking greatsword, and it could very well have been a
      sacred-blood one.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Demon entered the arena, it did so to the welcoming cheers of
      much applause. It was to be expected; after all, a battle of royal spirits
      was a supremely rare occurrence. The Demon was the only one owned by the
      arena, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, is your Snow Charmer ready to enter the arena?&#8221;
      Zhang Xiang looked at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen nodded to confirm his preparations were complete, and then the
      Snow Charmer walked out and into the arena.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Snow Charmer came out, the audience went crazy, screaming with
      excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It really is a female spirit. Whoa, she is so beautiful!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Ah, this royal spirit is far too pretty.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who is the owner of this spirit? He is a lucky man, indeed.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven watched the Snow Charmer&#8217;s reveal with focused eyes.
      Initially, he wasn&#8217;t too concerned with the coming fight, and he
      hadn&#8217;t even asked who his Demon&#8217;s opponent would be. But the
      Snow Charmer&#8217;s appearance startled him, and so he sat up,
      captivated.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the beginning, before the arena, Son of Heaven wanted a beautiful
      spirit for himself, but there did not exist many in this world for him to
      claim. The likes of an actual lady spirit were even rarer. The appearance
      of his challenger was enthralling to see, and his eyes were wide in
      admiration.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fight began. Holding its greatsword high, the Demon roared and dashed
      towards the Snow Charmer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Snow Charmer did not move, but her body shone with a red armor that
      was decorated in a variety of different glyphs. The icy cane she held in
      her hands became the Ice-Blood Lance she would use for battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, a golden light hovered between her legs and from it, what appeared
      to be a golden beast formed and raised the Snow Charmer upon its back. She
      had become a lancer of elegant doom.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The Snow Charmer rode the Golden Roarer majestically, and their perfect
      synergy made them look like they were one. The speed at which she rode
      towards the Demon enabled Raging Impact. The Ice-Blood Lance thrust into
      the Demon and the Demon&#8217;s greatsword slashed the Snow Charmer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Demon took a few steps back, but fortunately for it, the armor had not
      been pierced. The slash that the Snow Charmer received was fair, but under
      the protection provided to her from Raging Impact, she was not hurt. After
      the dust settled on their opening moves, it was too early to gauge who
      seemed likely to win.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven&#8217;s eyes gleamed with a certain fire. It was too soon
      for him to level up and gain access to the Second Shelter, so he had never
      seen a Golden Roarer before and was therefore unfamiliar with its talents
      and abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven was shocked to see the equipment that the Snow Charmer was
      loaded with. He knew that whoever owned that royal spirit was no ordinary
      person.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Someone call for Zhang Xiang!&#8221; Son of Heaven ordered for the
      people beside him to locate Zhang Xiang so he could inquire about who the
      Snow Charmer&#8217;s owner was. He also wanted to know if there was any
      chance he could bargain for possession of her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhang Xiang quickly appeared in front of Son of Heaven and politely said,
      &#8220;Boss, is there anything you require?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who is the owner of that Snow Charmer?&#8221; Son of Heaven asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhang Xiang hastily replied, &#8220;It is a young man of the name
      &#8216;Han.&#8217; He must have arrived here from another shelter. He is a
      reserved fellow, so I wasn&#8217;t able to learn much about him.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han?&#8221; Son of Heaven could not help but frown, as that surname
      brought up many unpleasant memories. It reminded him of a person he hated
      a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Son of Heaven shrugged it off, believing the name was a coincidence
      and that the Snow Charmer would assuredly not belong to the Han Sen he
      used to know. That person was a late arrival to the Second Shelter, and he
      had only been there for less than a year. It would be impossible for him
      to acquire such spirits and beast souls in that amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wait until the battle is over. Then bring him to me.&#8221; Son of
      Heaven relayed this order to Zhang Xiang and did not say anything more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the Snow Charmer&#8217;s performance was amazing, and the beast
      souls she owned were pretty remarkable, Son of Heaven still believed she
      was no match for his Demon. He watched quietly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The clashes of the two spirits had pumped the audience into a frenzy of
      sheer excitement. The colliding of lance against sword, the trading of
      blows between a beautiful woman and a warrior, and the accompaniment of a
      terrifying mount rallied the crowd&#8217;s enthusiasm to the max.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The royal spirits' fight is much better! Now that I think about it,
      the fights between knight class spirits suck.&#8221;
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Of Course This Is Awesome. Just Look At The Beast Souls They Use;
        They Are Sacred-Blood Ones.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      &#8220;I really want a royal spirit. If the Snow Charmer was mine, that
      would be a dream come true!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Stop dreaming, then! It would be impossible for an ordinary person
      such as you or me to take a shelter. Even if you did, the spirits would
      most likely ignore you. The chance to tame a royal spirit is 10,000 to 1.
      It would be easier for you to win the lottery.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Demon, it is time for you to reveal your true strength!&#8221; Son
      of Heaven observed that the mood of his audience was fever-high. A creepy
      smile raised his lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, the Demon leapt out of the battleground and screamed as a
      light emanated from the partings in its plate armor. The body quickly
      morphed into that of a black ape built from metal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A sacred-blood Blacksteel Ape? I had no idea that the Demon had a
      sacred-blood transfiguration beast soul.&#8221; Someone recognized the
      Demon&#8217;s transfiguration beast soul and screamed aloud in mounting
      excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was not the extent of its abilities. The Demon pointed its
      greatsword and summoned a yellow lion which had a horn on its head. After
      the lion appeared, it roared at the sky intimidatingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A sacred-blood pet Golden-Horn Lion? That is not fair! How is the
      Snow Charmer supposed to compete with that?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Two versus one? And it&#8217;s a sacred-blood pet! Victory for the
      Snow Charmer is surely unobtainable now.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He is too rich. He has too much money. It&#8217;s only a royal
      spirit, but it was stocked with so many beast souls.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;There is nothing we can do. There are not many spirits.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Everyone was in a heated debate over the most recent turn of events, and
      Son of Heaven was wallowing in the chatter of praise. He loved nothing
      more than to crush those who opposed him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But before the Demon could start attacking, the Snow Charmer made a move
      of her own. Her body started to shine, and a really beautiful Snow-Lady
      transfiguration beast soul appeared to combine with the Snow Charmer. From
      it, the Snow Charmer&#8217;s hair turned white, her eyes gleamed silver,
      and her body was consumed with a biting frost.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah! It is a humanoid transfiguration beast soul! It almost looks
      human now.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is the Snow Charmer&#8217;s transfiguration a sacred-blood
      type?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      While everyone was reeling from shock, the Snow Charmer raised her lance.
      A red-armored beast with four wings then spawned. It approached the
      Golden-Horn Lion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two beasts collided with each other. One could not overcome the other,
      which resulted in a stalemate that rocked the audience to their cores. No
      one had expected the owner of the Snow Charmer to be so rich, almost as
      rich as the Demon&#8217;s owner himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Son of Heaven laid eyes on what was happening, he was just as
      rattled. It was normal to have armored beast souls raise a sacred-blood
      pet, but that wasn&#8217;t something ordinary elites could do. It must
      have had really strong power.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who is this person?&#8221; Son of Heaven furrowed his brow once
      more.
