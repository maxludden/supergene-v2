<p>“Mr. Zuo Yu, Yu Kun asked Han Sen to kill the Demon Abyss Beast
King for him. They are going to the Demon Abyss.” In the hall, a
Sky Palace student was talking to a Sky man in black armor. He had
grey hair</p>
<p>“Yu Kun has practiced the Deep Abyss Demon Spell. If he gets the
Demon Abyss Beast King’s deified gene, he can become deified. But
the fact that he has managed to secure Han Sen’s assistance is
surprising,” Zuo Yu said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“I have heard he gave Han Sen the Wood Spirit Rhino in exchange
for his services. That is why Han Sen agreed to help,” the Sky
Palace student said.</p>
<p>“I see. Then, it makes sense,” Zuo Yu nodded.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zuo Yu, Yu Kun is still under suspicion. Should we prohibit
Han Sen from helping him slay the Demon Abyss Beast King?” Zuo Yu
shook his head. “No. Han Sen is like a son to the leader. If he is
willing to help Yu Kun, Sky Palace Leader must have given his
approval. We will take the backseat and observe for a while.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Zuo Yu said, “Go and find Shiya. Tell her to
prepare. She will be going to the Demon Abyss on a trip with
me.”</p>
<p>“You are going to the Demon Abyss yourself?” the student asked
with shock.</p>
<p>“We do not understand our target yet. This will be a fine
opportunity to learn more about Han Sen and Yu Kun,” Zuo Yu said
coldly.</p>
<p>As Han Sen and Yu Kun traveled toward Demon Abyss, Yu Kun seemed
very relaxed. Aside from Han Sen, he hadn’t hired anyone else to
help with the hunt.</p>
<p>Han Sen had accepted payment for the job, so there was nothing
else he could do. He had no choice but to help the man.</p>
<p>After making his agreement with Yu Kun, Han Sen had received a
detailed synopsis of the Demon Abyss Beast King from Sky Palace
Leader. The file contained essentially the same information that Yu
Kun had already given him. Han Sen had a seventy percent chance of
killing this beast.</p>
<p>Of course, there was always the chance that the Demon Abyss
Beast King would be stronger than the reports stated. It could have
evolved, too. So, Han Sen had to be very careful when calculating
his odds. There was a lot to account for.</p>
<p>The Demon Abyss was a giant hole in space with a massive star
inside it. Space seemed to have collapsed under the weight of the
enormous star, but then the star had reached an odd state of
equilibrium instead of exploding as stars usually did under such
conditions.</p>
<p>The space hole contained many xenogeneics. Sky Palace students
often enjoyed hunting there, but ordinary students wouldn’t venture
too far into the Demon Abyss. They could always hunt the low-level
xenogeneics that remained on the outskirts, which would be far
safer for the students than heading to the interior of the space
hole.</p>
<p>When the nearby Sky Palace students saw Han Sen and Yu Kun
approaching, they all came forward to bow. It was mainly a show of
respect for Han Sen. They only called Yu Kun “uncle” because
formality required them to.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed their faces, guessing they must have known
about Yu Kun and the allegations.</p>
<p>Yu Kun didn’t pay any attention to their barely-veiled disdain,
though. With Han Sen, he pushed on deeper into the Demon Abyss. He
avoided the larger groups of xenogeneics, obviously not wanting to
waste time on low-rank creatures.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Yu Kun through the Demon Abyss for two whole
days before they reached their destination. There, they saw the
Demon Abyss Beast King talked about in legends.</p>
<p>There had been videos of the creature in the file that Han Sen
had received, but there was a big difference between seeing a
creature on a video and in real life. The sight of the beast was
astounding.</p>
<p>It had a scorpion body and a dragon head. Dragon wings spread
from the creature’s back, and it was covered in blue scales. The
head had eight pairs of draconic eyes. So, there were sixteen eyes
in total. Its body was one hundred meters tall. Even the sight of
the creature was horrible and disturbing. It was sleeping on one of
the walls in the Demon Abyss. It was like a drowsing demon.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his peacock king’s soul robe and his Six Core
Snake Bow. Then, he turned to Yu Kun.</p>
<p>“Let’s put our plan into action.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Yu Kun said with a nod. He pulled out his blade. His
weapon was a black ring blade that was close to thirty centimeters
wide. It looked incredibly sharp. It was a very rare and weird
weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen drew the string on his bow, but before he could release
it, the Demon Abyss Beast King woke up. Its sixteen eyes peered at
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t hesitate. He fired at the Demon Abyss Beast King,
sending an arrow imbued with rainbow light soaring through space.
It flew straight toward one of the Demon Abyss Beast King’s
eyes.</p>
<p>But just as the arrow approached, the Demon Abyss Beast King’s
eye opened like a black hole. The arrow disappeared into the black
hole, then vanished. The Demon Abyss Beast King was not
injured.</p>
<p>The Demon Abyss Beast King screamed weirdly. It flapped its
wings, making its body shine with a shimmering blue light. As it
flew, the creature’s wings looked strangely beautiful against the
background of the Demon Abyss. A writhing substance chain emerged
from the creature and came flying toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen drew his bow and fired again and again, sending many
rainbow light arrows at the Demon Abyss Beast King. The Demon Abyss
Beast King didn’t care. Han Sen aimed at several different places
across the creature’s body, but wherever his arrows landed, a black
hole manifested. The arrows flew into them and disappeared. None of
them could deal a speck of damage to the Demon Abyss Beast King’s
body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Demon Abyss Beast King opened its mouth. Suddenly, a blue
flood poured out of it like a volcano erupting. It was headed
straight for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body flashed away quickly to avoid that flooding blue
substance chain. He didn’t retreat, though. He continued to fire
his arrows, getting closer and closer to the Demon Abyss Beast
King.</p>
<p>Han Sen was like a surfer riding a tsunami that would end the
world. The sky was full of blue energy, but it didn’t hurt him.
That primitive class Demon Abyss Beast King couldn’t do anything to
harm him.</p>
<p>From some distance away, a Sky man and woman watched the
unfolding battle.</p>
<p>“What powerful movements!” the woman said, complimenting Han
Sen’s efforts. “His movement isn’t the truly impressive thing,”
replied Zuo Yu. He shook his head and said, “The remarkable thing
is his ability to judge and analyze details. His body responds with
perfect precision.”</p>
<p>“Precision?” Shiya frowned.</p>
<p>“You can see him falling back on the left. Before he fell back
to the left, though, his body leaned right. And while leaning
seventy degrees to the right, he fired three arrows. He did it all
at the same time. He misled the Demon Abyss Beast King, tempting
the creature into spitting its demon stream to the right. That, in
turn, forced the Demon Abyss Beast King to go right. It gives him
the space to go left. So, he has the time to move to a more
advantageous position for his next attack. Details like that are in
every single move. If this guy isn’t just insanely OCD, then he is
a born fighter,” Zuo Yu said.</p>
<p>Shiya looked at Zuo Yu, suddenly unnerved. Han Sen’s skills
didn’t look very special, at all. But when she paid attention to
the minuscule motions of Han Sen’s body, it was just as Zuo Yu had
said. He was moving with amazing precision and planning. Shiya had
formed her impression of Han Sen when she saw him fight Exquisite.
Those cruel, overbearing, and violent attacks were seared into
Shiya’s analysis of who Han Sen was. She considered him a violent
man, and so she hadn’t taken the time to look for any finesse in
his attacks. Now that she could see it clearly, she was shocked.
The way he was fighting now was totally different than the
techniques he had employed against Exquisite. It was hard to
believe this fighting style belonged to the same person.</p>
