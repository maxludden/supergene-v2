  The feeling was amazing. It was like many small ice cubes were melting around him. They melted when they touched his skin, and were then absorbed.

As the Jade Air was absorbed into his cells, Han Sen noticed some changes that were happening across his body. His skin was developing a jade-like color. Under the influence of the Jade Air, Yun Fei and the others were all shining like crystals. They were like statues built from jade.

“This powerful Jade Air can change the genes of the body? This Jade Air must come from a xenogeneic gene, yes?” Han Sen thought to himself.

“Left Crazy did say that rocks possessed sentience, but their lives are different from ours. White Jade Jing must be a creature, and the Jade Air must be a xenogeneic gene. That being said, I can’t determine the level of White Jade Jing.” Han Sen made a number of guesses while he absorbed the Jade Air.

But guessing was all he could do since his theories stemmed from what Left Crazy had once told him. No one could prove if what he was thinking was the truth.

Han Sen used The Story of Genes to absorb the Jade Air, transforming the Jade Air’s energy.

The Story of Genes was very compatible when it came to other elements. After absorbing Jade Air, there was a noticeable improvement. But it still wasn’t enough to break through, and there was obviously something missing.

“Didn’t Thousand Feather Crane say that the higher you get, the stronger the Jade Air is? Maybe I can use a stronger Jade Air to breakthrough,” Han Sen thought, standing up. He walked towards the fourth floor, with the Jade Air all around.

The third floor, with its Jade Air, offered too little for him. Everyone there was a Viscount, but Han Sen had used many xenogeneic genes to improve his body. He was much stronger than the average Viscount.

Han Sen could compete with Earls if he maxed out his genes as a Viscount.

When he stepped onto the fourth floor, he felt very cold. The third floor felt cool, but the fourth felt cold. After going in, he felt as if he had stumbled into an ice cave.

But that cold could not affect Han Sen’s body. He looked around the fourth floor and saw some people sitting amidst swirls of Jade Air. Aside from the Sky, there were two outsider races. Thousand Feather Crane was not on this floor, however.

Han Sen absorbed the Jade Air to help breakthrough with The Story of Genes, but it wasn’t working. So, he decided to walk to the fifth floor.

When he reached the fifth floor, he felt as if he had been frozen. He stopped at the entrance and became like a real statue.

The Jadeskin melted from ice to water, and with Han Sen’s strength, he could not refine that Jade Air. The Jade Air started to fill his body. Han Sen felt his body go cold. It was not his temperature decreasing, either; it was his life that was weakening.

Han Sen could feel his body turning into jade, growing weaker. He cast The Story of Genes, but he could not withstand the jade.

The Jade Air’s gene power was far stronger than Han Sen’s gene power. So, the genes in his body were being changed by the Jade Air.

Han Sen was surprised. In the space of one floor, there had been a massive difference. His power was sufficient to counter the Jade Air, but that would nullify the point of practicing there.

Han Sen cast Petrify and turned himself to stone. When the Jade Air tried to invade the stone, it could not invade the genes of Han Sen’s body. It moisturized Han Sen’s petrified body, making itself much easier for him to absorb.

When using Petrify, the only other skill Han Sen could activate was The Story of Genes. So, without hesitating, he activated The Story of Genes to absorb the Jade Air around him.

The Jade Air was absorbed by his petrified body. He continued running The Story of Genes, and as he did so, his petrified body turned to jade.

The powerful Jade Air kept trying to break through and send him up to Earl class. But again and again, something held him back and made the process fail. The air was very powerful, but for some reason, it couldn’t carry him through to the last stage.

After two hours, the Jade Air disappeared. And when it was gone, Han Sen stopped using Petrify. He felt awful.

“Such powerful Jade Air, and it still isn’t enough to break through with The Story of Genes? What do I have to do to become an Earl?” Han Sen felt depressed.

The people on the fifth floor saw a stranger—they were looking at Han Sen. They noticed he was not of the Sky, and that was even weirder.

Those people did not know who Han Sen was, and they did not expect a Viscount could accompany them on the fifth floor when the Jade Air erupted. So, they guessed Han Sen was an Earl.

Han Sen did not stay and talk to them, and he went straight up to the sixth floor. He had Petrify, so the Jade Air could not damage him.

“If the fifth floor’s Jade Air cannot help me break through, I will have to keep going.” Han Sen walked to the sixth floor.

More people were practicing there.

It was not the time for Jade Air to erupt there, but no one noticed Han Sen. Han Sen looked around the sixth floor, and again he could not see Thousand Feather Crane. So, he went ahead to the seventh floor.

Han Sen found him there on the seventh floor. And on the seventh floor, aside from Han Sen himself, there were three people in total.

Two of them were of the Sky, and one of them was bald. He had nine moles on his head, so he was from the Buddha. He looked young, like Speechless. So, it must have been hard to reach this point at the age he was. He was the best of the Earls, as most Earls could go no further than the fifth floor.

Of the two Sky, one of them was Thousand Feather Crane. The other Sky was a young woman that Han Sen did not know.

Han Sen looked at them, and they looked at Han Sen.

“Brother Han, why are you not practicing down there? Why have you come here?” Thousand Feather Crane asked. Before Han Sen could answer, the young Sky woman looked at Han Sen and said, “You are Knife Queen’s student Han

Han Sen saw how scared she looked, and he knew what she would soon say. He smiled and told her, “Yes. I am Han Sen, who was brought in by Thousand Feather Crane.”
