<h2>Giant Prisoners</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2701</h3>

<p>“Five times… six times…” Han Sen was silently counting each
chime. He counted all the way to 12, then the bells fell quiet.</p>
<p>The moment the bells stopped, the doors of every palace opened
wide. Some of the buildings looked like modern metal structures,
while others were crafted like vintage castles. Regardless of their
appearances, all of the palaces opened their doors at the same
time, as if they had been rigged to do so automatically.</p>
<p>When the palace doors opened up, a sense of life came to the
previously dead and barren ocean. Han Sen could even hear footsteps
echoing from the nearest palace.</p>
<p>Even a person who was almost deaf could have heard those booming
footsteps. Each one was like a small earthquake, and the sounds
pressed against Han Sen’s eardrums like a physical weight.</p>
<p>Those earthquake-like footsteps drew Han Sen’s gaze toward the
palace’s door, and he soon saw something massive emerging through
the open door frame.</p>
<p>It was a giant that was 100 meters tall. Although it was big, it
didn’t seem clumsy or awkward. Instead, it moved its massive body
with grace, exuding a sense of explosive power with every motion.
If the being wished to, Han Sen figured it could cast power with
enough strength and speed to destroy an entire planet with
ease.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s brows furrowed as he noticed the manacles attached to
the giant’s hands and legs. It gave him the sense that this was a
prisoner of some notoriety. The giant’s eyes looked very dull, and
it just stared forward into space.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly realized that the giant he was watching wasn’t
the only one that had emerged. A giant now stood in front of every
palace across that entire ocean.</p>
<p>All the other giants were bound hand and foot as well, and their
eyes were lifeless. They stood quietly in front of their respective
buildings.</p>
<p>“They have such large bodies. They aren’t sinking, despite the
fact that they’re standing on the surface of the sea. The current
seems to be moving them, though. They’re all being pulled in the
same direction.” Han Sen hesitated. He wasn’t sure if he should
follow and see what was up, as all of this seemed like weird
nonsense.</p>
<p>Outer Sky shouldn’t have allowed a foreign object to conduct
space teleportation, but the Four Sheep Cube had brought them
effortlessly to this strange sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen had visited too many weird places in his time. So, even
though this place was very strange, Han Sen wasn’t too shaken. What
caught him off guard, however, was the presence of those
giants.</p>
<p>There was an incredible gravitas to the presence of the giants,
and it made Han Sen wonder if they were deified elites.</p>
<p>But as Han Sen thought about it, he realized that he could see
200 or 300 of the giants. If they were all deified elites, he
couldn’t imagine what race they must have represented to have so
many deified elites in their ranks.</p>
<p>Even more frightening, these power giants were being treated
like prisoners. Their limbs were chained, and something was wrong
with their eyes. Who could have imprisoned giants like these?</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to go and find out, but he concluded that it
would be too dangerous. If something had been able to trap those
giants, it could likely detect Han Sen’s presence, especially if he
went looking for it.</p>
<p>“Never mind. Let’s just find a way to leave this creepy place.”
Han Sen picked up Bao’er and returned to the Four Sheep Cube.</p>
<p>“You aren’t going to go see?” Bao’er asked, looking at the
giants that were drifting away on the currents.</p>
<p>“It’s too dangerous. For now, let’s just figure out a way to get
out of here,” Han Sen answered with a shake of his head. He walked
over to the Four Sheep Cube. He remembered Bao’er stepping on one
of the sheep heads, which triggered the whirlpool that had brought
them to this place.</p>
<p>“Now, we have to take a risk.” Han Sen directed the small pigs
to go back into the pool of water in the Four Sheep Cube. He picked
up Bao’er and jumped in after them, but not before stepping on one
of the bronze sheep heads.</p>
<p>Katcha-cha!</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s foot came down on the bronze sheep head, the two
goldfish started to swim around like mad again. The water in the
cube became a whirlpool once more.</p>
<p>“We must go back.” Han Sen once more felt a magnetic force
emanating from the cube. He and Bao’er were sucked into the cube
and its whirlpool. The 16 little piggies were spinning around
inside like mad, too.</p>
<p>When the water flow stopped, and Han Sen emerged from the cube,
he realized with pleasant surprise that they were back on the
shores of Underworld Lake.</p>
<p>“Is the Four Sheep Cube a teleporter? If that is the case, I
wonder where it sent us. And what were those giants?” Han Sen
looked at the Four Sheep Cube as he mulled these questions over. He
continued to think to himself, saying, “This bronze sheep head
gives me the ability to teleport. I wonder what the other three
sheep heads do. Does each one provide a different function? Or will
the others send me to different places?”</p>
<p>Han Sen gave the matter some thought. His curiosity regarding
the object had increased immensely, but he didn’t want to take too
many risks. If his instincts were correct, those giants were
deifieds. And if that was true, wherever they were going had to be
very dangerous.</p>
<p>Based on that assumption, Han Sen imagined that the other three
bronze sheep heads would lead him to someplace else that was
dangerous, too.</p>
<p>Despite all his strengths and talents, Han Sen had a flaw. He
could be too curious. He knew how dangerous that sea filled with
giants could be, but now that he had discovered such a weird and
mysterious place, it would drive him insane if he didn’t go and
find out its secrets.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, you stay here.” Han Sen set Bao’er down, planning to
visit the giant world alone.</p>
<p>“Dad, I’ll go with you.” Bao’er clutched Han Sen’s leg, not
wanting to let go.</p>
<p>“That place is too dangerous. I will go and scout ahead. If it
looks fun, I will take you there.” Han Sen had to comfort Bao’er
for a while before she agreed to stay behind.</p>
<p>Han Sen took Bao’er someplace far away before returning to the
Four Sheep Cube. He used his hand to press down on the sheep
head.</p>
<p>Just like before, the two goldfish in the water started to swim
in a swift circle. They created a whirlpool in the water that
sucked Han Sen inside.</p>
<p>When Han Sen emerged from the Four Sheep Cube, he found himself
standing atop that big sea again. The giants had all disappeared.
He looked at the sun, and the clock was showing that only a dozen
minutes had passed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly heard a massive explosion come from where the
giants had gone. He could feel the spike of power coming from that
direction.</p>
<p>As the power shook the air around him, Han Sen’s face changed.
He whispered to himself in a hoarse voice, “That shockwave… It
feels like Break Six Skies. Are these giants the legendary
Breakskies?”</p>
<p>Break Six Skies was the secret geno art of the Breakskies. The
Destroyed were one of the few races with the blood of the
Breakskies in them, but they were never as good as the Breakskies
themselves.</p>
<p>The legends of the universe claimed that the Breakskies were
unable to breed. So, the universe gradually forgot them. If they
wanted to extend their bloodline, they had to interbreed with other
races to create hybrid Breakskies, like the Destroyed.</p>
<p>If these giants really were Breakskies, then the story of the
Breakskies’ fall wasn’t as simple as it initially seemed.</p>
