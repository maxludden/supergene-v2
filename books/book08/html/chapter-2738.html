<p>“That wasn’t my intent. Our families are friends, so we should
help each other out.” Although Ning Bu Ao was cocky, he wasn’t
stupid. He realized that he had said something he shouldn’t have,
and so he quickly tried to steer the conversation back down a more
pleasant avenue.</p>
<p>“I understood your intent perfectly fine, but I don’t require
help,” Tang Ming’er said. She took the boy’s arm and said,
“Littleflower, let’s go.”</p>
<p>When Ning Bu Ao saw the pretty girl he liked getting close to
another boy, it upset him. He ran in front of the boy and pretended
to be shocked. He asked, “What is your name, little bro?”</p>
<p>“Han Littleflower,” the boy answered while meeting Ning Bu Ao’s
gaze.</p>
<p>When he heard the surname Han, Ning Bu Ao felt his heart take a
huge leap. He was really afraid of that surname, due to something
that had happened to him when he was younger.</p>
<p>There was a time, on a beach, when a little demon girl belonging
to the Han family had lobbed him into the briny depths of the sea.
Even now, Ning Bu Ao continued to have nightmares about that
terrible incident. It was the most terrifying memory he had.</p>
<p>“Han Littleflower, he said. I don’t think such a person belongs
to the Han family. Maybe he’s a member of some other family with
the same surname.” Ning Bu Ao dug into his memories and felt some
relief. As long as Littleflower wasn’t from that Han family, then
he didn’t need to worry.</p>
<p>As far as Ning Bu Ao knew, the Han family only had a daughter.
She was only a few years old, so there was no chance she had
entered the sanctuaries just yet.</p>
<p>The legends said that the Han family did have a son, but for
unknown reasons, the son had gone missing. Ning Bu Ao remembered
that the boy was called Han Fei. He didn’t have an old-fashioned
and funny name like Littleflower.</p>
<p>Littleflower was just his nickname, though. His family members
called him Han Littleflower, but ordinary people would only know
him as Han Fei. It was no surprise that Ning Bu Ao failed to
recognize the name.</p>
<p>“Brother Littleflower, if you need anything, just ask. I, Ning
Bu Ao, am very talented. It is easy for me to kill xenogeneics.
Killing sacred-blood creatures is a piece of cake for a guy like
me.” Ning Bu Ao smiled at Han Littleflower as he boasted.</p>
<p>“Thank you. You seem like a nice guy. I will ask you if there is
anything I ever need,” Han Littleflower said politely.</p>
<p>In Sacred, Auntie Mei had taught Littleflower to be polite with
other creatures. Even when he was eating, he had to act like the
gentleman he was. He had to keep up good etiquette at all
times.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? I found a sacred-blood creature to
the east side of the shelter. I’m going to kill it. Let’s go,” Ning
Bu Ao said with a smile.</p>
<p>He was very confident about his appearance and power. He thought
he would only need to flex his powers for a little girl like Tang
Ming’er to fall for him head-over-heels.</p>
<p>Han Littleflower wasn’t interested in killing sacred-blood
creatures, though. He had only stayed in the first sanctuary
because he was having trouble finding more super creatures. If he
could find them more reliably, he would be in the second sanctuary
already.</p>
<p>“Littleflower, if Mister Ning is inviting you, we should go.”
Tang Ming’er suddenly winked at him.</p>
<p>She was a smart girl, so she knew what Ning Bu Ao was up to. He
obviously had a thing for her. She also knew the Ning family were a
very arrogant and self-loving set of people, overall. If she didn’t
sort out this trouble now, the way Ning Bu Ao was annoying her
would just snowball. That was why she said they should go, despite
secretly harboring another reason for going.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao was happy to hear her agree. He summoned two
sacred-blood beast soul mounts and said, “The distance between us
and that place is a bit far. I will give you these two sacred-blood
mounts as a gift.”</p>
<p>He was never hesitant about showing off. Ning Bu Ao always
thought if he had something decent, he should let other people
know. Just talking wasn’t enough, so he sometimes gave out gifts to
demonstrate his wealth.</p>
<p>Two sacred-blood mounts were something excellent. After all,
there were many types of beast souls, so sacred-blood beast soul
mounts were quite rare.</p>
<p>“It is fine. Littleflower has a mount already. I will just ride
it with him.” Tang Ming’er smiled at Littleflower as she spoke.</p>
<p>Han Littleflower didn’t say anything. He just summoned his own
ride.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A giant, gold, two-headed dragon appeared in front of Han
Littleflower. The mount beast souls around all started to scream
and run away. If their masters hadn’t commanded them to stop right
where they were, all of them would have fled.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao froze when he saw it. It was a very powerful beast
soul. He had seen things like this in his family’s house, but they
were high-class beast souls from the later sanctuaries. In the
first sanctuary, he had never seen a beast that scary before.</p>
<p>“This… This cannot be a super beast soul. That is impossible.
It’s just a bluff, surely. It cannot be a super beast soul.” Ning
Bu Ao was really suspicious about its presence there, but he didn’t
want to ask what type of beast soul it was. Otherwise, it would
make him sound like an ignorant redneck.</p>
<p>“Let’s just go.” Ning Bu Ao had to force a smile as he spoke to
Han Littleflower and Tang Ming’er, who were happily sitting on the
two-headed dragon’s back.</p>
<p>“Please led the way, Mister Ning,” Tang Ming’er said with a
smile.</p>
<p>Although he was upset, Ning Bu Ao still commanded his team to go
forward with haste. The sacred-blood mounts ran as fast as they
could, trying to leave the two-headed dragon behind.</p>
<p>But they had only just started running when the giant dragon
spread its massive wings and soared off into the sky. It moved with
incredible speed. Compared to the two-headed dragon mount, Ning Bu
Ao’s sacred-blood mount was as slow as a turtle.</p>
<p>“That can’t be a super beast soul, can it?” Ning Bu Ao was
stunned. His mood was very sour, and he had to keep comforting
himself, saying, “That kid must have just gotten lucky. Another
family member might have just given it to him. In terms of power,
he certainly can’t compete with me. When I kill the sacred-blood
creature, Tang Ming’er will know for sure who the real man is
here.”</p>
<p>The sacred-blood mount moved reasonably quickly in comparison to
most beast mounts. It took them two hours to reach their
destination. They saw a creature there that was like a titan. It
was resting quietly atop a hill.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao gave a command and sprang forward. He led his team to
fight that sacred-blood creature.</p>
<p>The sacred-blood creature stood up and roared when Ning Bu Ao’s
army surrounded it. It couldn’t get clear, and it was quickly
hemmed in on all sides.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao’s soldiers moved with great coordination as he issued
commands. The sacred-blood creature was unable to harm a single one
of them. Ning Bu Ao was very active, too, and he attacked the
sacred-blood creature again and again. It took them half an hour to
bring the titan down.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao was very satisfied with his performance. He had
fought and commanded his men to the best of his abilities. He was
very satisfied with how the fight had gone.</p>
<p>He smiled at Han Littleflower and Tang Ming’er. He began walking
toward them, but after a few steps, he heard an angry roaring
coming from the sky. He raised his head, and his face paled.</p>
<p>This new creature was similar to the sacred-blood one they had
just killed, but this one was bigger. It was like a small mountain.
It fell toward them out of the sky. Ning Bu Ao’s soldiers were
still reveling in the joy of their victory, unaware of what was
going to happen. If the creature landed, half of them would
die.</p>
<p>“Run!” Ning Bu Ao shouted as he started to run. But the normal
soldiers didn’t react as fast as he had. As he looked up at the
giant beast about to crush them all, Ning Bu Ao was shocked and
furious. He couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something flashed in the corner of his vision. The
giant beast coming down from the sky jerked to a stop. Its descent
was halted.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao was shocked. His eyes tracked down the body of the
behemoth until he saw Littleflower standing beneath it. The boy was
holding up the mountainous beast with one hand. He stood there
casually. The soldiers all around were staring at him in
dumbfounded awe. They looked at the little boy holding up the beast
like they were seeing a ghost.</p>
