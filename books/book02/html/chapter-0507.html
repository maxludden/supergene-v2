    <p>Ding!</p>

    <p>
      The seemingly clumsy body of the golden crab suddenly bounced, facing Han
      Sen with its head. The golden pincer blocked Han Sen&#8217;s claws.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeling a huge force, Han Sen&#8217;s right hand started to bleed. His
      entire arm was numb, and he couldn&#8217;t help stepping back a dozen
      steps before he could stable himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving all its eight claws, the golden crab moved sideways toward Han Sen
      quickly in an incredibly nimble way.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What kind of crab is this? So weird.&#8221; Han Sen turned back and
      ran around the crystal sailboat. Since the golden crab was incredibly fast
      and strong, Han Sen found he could not take care of the creature at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Running after Han Sen for several laps, the golden crab failed to catch up
      with him and became so upset that it kept making noises with its pincer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because Han Sen was so good at his footwork, although he was slower than
      the golden crab, he could leverage the crystal sailboat as an obstruction
      to get rid of the golden crab.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was pondering what kind of tricks he needed to adopt to take
      care of this golden crab, the crab suddenly gave up chasing him and ran
      toward the body of the silver eel.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I wonder if this guy eats the toxic meat of the silver eel, will it
      be poisoned as well?&#8221; Although Han Sen had this thought, the meat of
      the silver eel would be wasted if the golden crab was immune to the
      toxins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking that, Han Sen ran to launch a sneak attack against the golden
      crab from its back, trying to stop it from eating the silver eel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and the crab were both trapped in a dilemma. The golden crab could
      not catch up with Han Sen. Nor could it eat the eel peacefully. They kept
      fighting and none of them was able to take any advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guarding the body of the silver eel, the golden crab faced Han Sen, no
      longer wanting to chase him. However, it did not dare to turn around to
      eat the meat either.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the golden crab next to him, Han Sen stared at the creature. Neither
      of the two knew how to proceed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen observed the golden crab carefully, wishing to find its
      weaknesses. If it were an ordinary crab, the links and gaps between its
      shells should be its weakness. However, this golden crab was obviously
      somewhat different. The links between its shells were of a deeper golden
      color. Although the links were narrow, he could tell that they were even
      tougher than the shells. As for gaps, the golden crab did not have any. It
      was as if the crab was made of a piece of gold.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was feeling depressed, he suddenly saw the golden crab waving
      its pincer at him. Han Sen thought it was about to attack again, and then
      found it did not move.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was waving its pincer to Han Sen. The act did not look like a
      provocation or an assault but seemed to be a &#8220;come here&#8221;
      between humans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought he was mistaken, rubbed his eyes, and found it was still
      waving like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Big crab, you are not a flirty girl. A there is no use for you to
      tempt me like this.&#8221; Han Sen did not know what the golden crab
      wanted, so of course he could not approach it. Han Sen simply yelled at
      the crab.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know whether the golden crab understood himself, but it
      most likely did not. After Han Sen said that, the golden crab turned
      around and pointed at the silver eel&#8217;s body with its pincer and then
      pointed to Han Sen. Han Sen saw the golden crab making gestures, not
      understanding what it meant. He was so confused that he was full of
      questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Han Sen only regretted that he had never learned the
      language of the crab. Otherwise, he might be able to chat with this crab
      to see what was it that it wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden crab made the gestures again and again, repeating its moves. It
      was blowing bubbles from time to time, seeming to be very anxious, wishing
      it could speak to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched for a while and felt his talent in learning the crab
      language was indeed lacking. However, he suddenly thought of one thing,
      which was the fact that he still had the spirit Snow Charmer. Although she
      had lost the ability to control other creatures after it gave Han Sen her
      allegiance, she had been the master of creatures once, so she might
      understood what the crab was talking about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Summoning Snow Charmer, Han Sen pointed at the golden crab making the
      gestures and asked her, &#8220;Snow Charmer, do you know its
      language?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Snow Charmer answered decisively.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was suddenly very disappointed. Since even Snow Charmer did not
      understand the crab language, it was impossible for himself to know what
      it was trying to say.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;However, I do know what it means,&#8221; Snow Charmer continued to
      say.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What does it want to say?&#8221; Han Sen was excited and asked Snow
      Charmer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Snow Charmer said quietly, &#8220;Its gesture is quite obvious. It wants
      to split the body of the silver eel with you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was dazed. Looking at the gestures of the golden crab, he felt it
      was true.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden crab made a gesture in the middle of the silver eel&#8217;s
      body and then pointed to both sides and Han Sen. It seemed to be saying
      Han Sen could pick one side.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen blushed. Such a simple gesture, yet he was unable to understand
      it. How foolish!
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly took Snow Charmer back. Making his servant see his foolish
      side, Han Sen felt quite embarrassed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Half is no… Two thirds… Mine&#8221; Han Sen gestured as he spoke,
      sounding like an alien.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this time the golden crab was the one who was confused. It stared
      at Han Sen with bubbles coming out of its mouth and even scratched its
      head with its pincer like a person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that the golden crab did not understand him, Han Sen did not dare
      to approach the body either. He had to gesture to the golden crab to ask
      it to step aside repeatedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, this gesture was easy to be understood. The golden crab moved
      aside and stared at Han Sen in suspicion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gestured it to move aside a bit further, and so it did. After a
      couple of times, Han Sen made sure that the distance between the golden
      crab and the silver eel was safe to him. He then walked next to the silver
      eel&#8217;s body, gesturing at two thirds of the body like the golden
      crab. He then pointed the smaller part and then the golden crab, the
      larger part and then himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden crab seemed to be understanding this time. As its shook its
      pincer, it moved its claws and returned to the eel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt scared and stepped back quickly, but the golden crab did not
      mean to chase after him. It gestured on the body again, meaning it
      insisted on half and half.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could not believe that he would bargain with a crab at this place
      with gestures. And this golden crab looked like an older lady bargaining
      in the farmers market, not willing to sacrifice anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man and the crab discussed for a while and finally reached an
      agreement. Han Sen could take about three fifths, while the golden crab
      was to take two fifths.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eat as you want. I wish you the bloody crab would be poisoned to death.
      Han Sen cut the body of the silver eel according to the proportion they
      had agreed through gestures. Seeing the golden crab taking its part with
      its pincer, Han Sen cursed inwardly.
