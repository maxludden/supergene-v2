<p>The sixth day after their arrival to the base, Han Sen summoned
everyone to a plaza.</p>
<p>He had been busy over the past few days, writing out the
document of ground rules he dubbed the Han Family Discipline. If
there was no rule of law, the place would not be considered
complete. It’d be impossible to gather people of different cultures
and races, and expect them to live together in harmony, if there
weren’t any rules established.</p>
<p>Han Sen had brutally killed a Baron, and the other Barons and
Viscounts had behaved awkwardly, following the deed. They wouldn’t
disobey one of Han Sen’s orders, but they also wouldn’t fight and
prove their worth to him as hard as they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>So, now, Han Sen summoned everyone together. On the stage, he
said, “I don’t care where you came from. I don’t care who you are.
From now on, you are a servant of the Han family. Everyone here is
equal, and there are no exceptions to that.”</p>
<p>The Barons and Viscounts were not happy to hear that. One
Viscount frowned and hollered back, “Master! We are here to depend
on you. We are here to be managers, not servants.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at him coldly, and he replied, “There will be
managers, but you are not yet qualified. So, for now, you are all
servants.”</p>
<p>“What must we do to become a member of your higher class?” The
Viscount looked dim, and he coldly laughed. He seemed to mock the
concept.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Zero and Little Angel to roll out a copy of the
discipline sheet and post it in the plaza.</p>
<p>“These are my rules of discipline. If you want to be a part of
the management team, the qualifications are posted there for your
viewing. I hope you will remember the words written here, because
they will affect your current way of life. I gave that Baron a
second chance yesterday, but now that you know the rules, if that
happens again… Don’t blame me for what I do,” Han Sen said
darkly.</p>
<p>Everyone moved forward to look at the scroll. Viscounts, Barons,
women, and their kids all went to read it.</p>
<p>The Viscounts and Barons looked enraged. It didn’t take long for
them to realize that being a servant meant they would not receive
any preferential treatment. Aside from a place to live, everything
cost money.</p>
<p>The xenogeneics they hunted would have to have half shared with
Han Sen. If they sold their kills to Han Sen, they wouldn’t receive
money. Instead, they’d receive points.</p>
<p>Those points could be spent in the base. They could get what
they wanted with them, and by collecting enough, they could earn
member status.</p>
<p>Amidst family members, however, there were also ranks. The
lowest one was only a little bit better than a servant. The higher
your tier, the greater the benefits you would receive.</p>
<p>But the points required increased more and more, after each
upgrade in status. By the end, there was a whole lot of digits
required to level up. Even though they were servants, though, Han
Sen would still pledge to protect them. The women and kids would
have to work for points, too.</p>
<p>But Han Sen would give the women and kids separate work. They
could do the brushing up, for example. Han Sen would give the
children free food, too, if they needed it.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, what kind of rules are these? We were brought here
to be managers. We didn’t sign up for hard labor!”</p>
<p>“I am a Viscount! What you are doing is far too much.”</p>
<p>“What kind of family requires their very own employees to pay so
much?”</p>
<p>“I am a Viscount. Wherever I go, I am offered weaponry. In here,
you want me to pay for my own food? What is this?” After the
Viscounts saw it, they all began to rabble amongst themselves. They
all become angry.</p>
<p>“These are the Han family rules, take them or leave them. If
anyone breaks the law established there, you full-well know what
will happen to you,” Han Sen said unsympathetically.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought they were all spies, anyway. He planned to use
all their power in whatever way he could.</p>
<p>“If that is the case, then I am going to leave,” a Viscount said
coldly. He wasn’t even referring to Han Sen as his Master now.</p>
<p>“Yes! We are going to leave the Han family, too.” The rest of
the Viscounts and Barons all said the same thing.</p>
<p>Han Sen had killed a Baron, but he was a Baron himself. But
right then, he only had two young ladies and a silver fox. With
four other Viscounts backing them up, the Barons weren’t
afraid.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Han Sen shouted. They were quickly silenced, and he
went on to coldly say, “What do you think this place is? This is
Planet Eclipse of Narrow Moon. It is my planet, and it is Knife
Queen’s place. You cannot just come and go. I am telling you, you
are all my servants right now. And without my permission
relinquishing you from my service, you will be my servant, even in
death.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, the Barons and Viscounts looked poorly. They were
all spies, and they knew about Han Sen. Knife Queen had given Han
Sen twelve geno fluids for him to become a Baron. She even let him
enter the space tunnel.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a famous person, and he also had Ghost Teeth Knife.
They did not believe Knife Queen would leave him in that place
without any protection.</p>
<p>Knife Queen was ignoring Han Sen right now because she wished to
train him. When he was in danger, however, she wouldn’t sit and
watch. They were certain that Knife Queen would do anything to
ensure Han Sen wasn’t killed by his own servants.</p>
<p>At this point, they were silenced. Even the Viscounts were.</p>
<p>If they were going to fight there, they would be at a
disadvantage. Han Sen was a dictator, and nothing good was going to
happen to them.</p>
<p>“If you have no problems, then read up on the Han family rules.
They come into effect today. You can explore, hunt, and clean; and
for as long as you have points, you may benefit from the VIP
service.” After that, Han Sen left with Zero and Little Angel.</p>
<p>The three of them went into a warehouse, and there, they guarded
the resources. Without permission, no one could go in or out.</p>
