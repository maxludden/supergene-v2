<p>“What bet?” Yisha asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“I will pick someone whose life is comparable to an ant, and if
you can make him challenge his fate by gaining independence from
you and becoming a duke, then I lose. I will find the person that
you want me to find. How does that sound?” the man said
seriously.</p>
<p>“What if I accomplish the task and you fail to find the man that
I want?” Yisha said with confidence.</p>
<p>“If I cannot deliver this man to you directly, then my head is
yours to remove. If you want it, you can just tell me. You don’t
have to get your hands dirty if you don’t want to.” The man looked
serious, and it didn’t look as if he was joking.</p>
<p>“Okay. Who said an ant’s fate is fixed? Even if he is just a
dumb guy with geno armor, I’ll make him a Duke in three years,”
Yisha agreed.</p>
<p>She really hated Dollar. She wanted to kill him, but she had
been unable to find him, so using this fortune-teller might be her
best option. Raising a Duke was not difficult. She did not think it
would be a trying task, and she didn’t believe in fate.</p>
<p>“Not many people are truly talented. Most of them are ants by
default. So, just go ahead and pick anyone.” The man randomly
pointed. “What about him? If you don’t think he is suitable, pick
another. They are all ants.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. I’ll choose him then. Just in case you would
later find fault with my selection.” Yisha looked at the person the
man pointed at as she spoke coldly.</p>
<p>“I am quite famous and known by many races. There is no chance
of escaping this bet You, however, are trying to challenge your own
fate. I must warn you to be careful.” The man smiled.</p>
<p>“In three years, I will come looking for you. If you are unable
to find him, don’t blame me for what happens.” Yisha walked up to
the person that had been pointed out to her.</p>
<p>The person on the street had no clue what was going on. But he
was suddenly pulled in by a weird power, and then he disappeared
completely.</p>
<p>Yisha took the man and left. Her power vanished with her, and
when the fortune-teller appeared again, the Kate behind him almost
walked into him.</p>
<p>When he saw Yisha disappear, he smiled strangely. He continued
walking, carrying his small banner. If Han Sen had seen the banner,
he would have understood the words. They read, Calculating Destiny
in the human language.</p>
<p>The man disappeared into the crowds. He did not look strange. He
was a drop of water in the midst of the throng of people. ***</p>
<hr />
<p>Han Sen walked down a street filled with people, thinking about
how he might get to Seven Mirrors.</p>
<p>Planet Kate had almost fallen completely, and when it did, the
Taurus would rule it Han Sen couldn’t live there much longer, and
he knew he would have to leave soon. But he couldn’t get on the
ship as there were already too many people trying to get off the
planet. If he showed he was a Noble, he could probably board a ship
immediately, without the need to queue.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wouldn’t do that. If he did, Yisha might find him.
And if she did, that would be bad. After leaving Demon Grave, Han
Sen knew he didn’t stand a chance against a deified elite. They
could kill him with the greatest of ease.</p>
<p>Walking down the street, Han Sen was thinking about how he might
get to Seven Mirrors so he could find Qiao and Lan Se. As he
walked, he suddenly felt cold, like a shadow had fallen over him.
He was wrapped up by a strange power and lifted off the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked and unsure of what was going on. He had no
clue why he had been suddenly trapped.</p>
<p>Han Sen was trying to think about who he might have made angry
this time. “Yisha? Hawk Wing? Mister Ji? The Taurus? Some surviving
Feathers?” Han Sen had offended a lot of people by this point, but
none of them should have known he was Dollar.</p>
<p>“Did someone find out I am Dollar? I cannot be that unlucky.”
Han Sen felt depressed, and he kept thinking, “I cannot fight back
against power like this. They must be a Duke. I wonder if I’ll be
given an opportunity to speak. If I am killed before I can speak,
that would suck. I at least need the time to teleport away.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was wrapped up by this power. He was snared and unable
to move. He couldn’t even use his skills, so he was just hoping the
person who had done this did not hate him too much. He hoped he
still had a chance of surviving.</p>
<p>Han Sen might end up getting beaten and tortured before they
locked him up. But if that happened, at least he’d be able to
return to the sanctuary.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was worrying about this, he saw some light. He fell
to the ground, which sent pain shooting up through his butt.</p>
<p>That was the least of his concerns right now, though. When he
looked around, he noticed he was on an aircraft. He was inside a
control room, and the black of space was visible through the
windows.</p>
<p>The ship looked fairly advanced. It did not look like some cheap
thing you’d find on Planet Kate. And there was another person in
the control room. They had bunny ears, and they were operating the
ship.</p>
<p>“Rebate! There’s no way I’m this unlucky!” Han Sen’s heart
jumped.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked up and saw a throne perched at the highest point
of the deck.</p>
<p>On that chair, the first thing Han Sen saw were long legs. They
were crossed over each other, and whoever sat like that had to be
someone who was very proud and arrogant.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked up a little higher, and that was when he saw the
white uniform filled with big boobs. Her arms were crossed, and her
face was stone cold. Atop this person’s head were white bunny
ears.</p>
<p>“Oh no! It’s Yisha!” Han Sen moaned. In front of the Knife
Queen, he could not teleport away.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how she had managed to find him. And he
didn’t think he had left any trace to follow. But that did not
matter right now, as he knew he would soon be dead.</p>
<p>Now, he was just hoping that Yisha would not kill him right
away, so he’d have the chance to escape.</p>
<p>“It does not matter who you are, but from this point forth, you
will be my student In three years, I will see to it that you’re a
Duke.” Yisha looked down at Han Sen like the queen she was.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at her and opened his mouth. He believed himself
to be dreaming.</p>
