“How is that possible? Hasn’t he only been practicing sword skills for a year?” The old man looked at Sky Group Leader high above with shock.

Sky Group Leader saw the god light screen was displaying a bit of purple mist. After a while, he sighed and said, “Zhuo Dong Lai really is some strange sort of genius, which is very rare to find.”

The old man looked rather perplexed, but he did not know how to respond.

One Dollar Sword Mind was not just any sword mind. It was a top-class geno art of the Wu Wei Dao Palace. It was created by the Wu Wei Dao Alpha.

Everything in this world started with one. One becomes two. Two becomes three. Three makes 10,000 things. One Dollar Sword Mind started a path to the infinite.

The whole Wu Wei Dao Palace legacy started with one. A gene race of any element was able to practice with the One Dollar Sword Mind. The sword mind would become a One Dollar Sword Mind, and a knife mind would become a One Dollar Knife Mind.

Any Wu Wei Dao Palace student could try their hand at learning the One Dollar Sword Mind, but the one who could truly be exceptional with the mind was considered a rare and prestigious student in Wu Wei Dao Palace.

It took Sky Group Leader 30 years to start basic proficiency with the One Dollar Sword Mind. He finally had entered the door to the big path.

Zhuo Dong Lai had only practiced his skills with a sword for a year, yet he already had One Dollar Sword Mind. It was very hard to believe.

Han Sen saw the purple mist swirl around Zhuo Dong Lai’s fingertips. His eyes turned bright at the sight.

In the universe of kingdoms, people rarely saw people practice the power of their minds. Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword mind was far greater than that of Yan Bei Fei. It made Han Sen’s heart feel a twitch.

Han Sen used his finger as a sword too. He pointed it at Zhuo Dong Lai’s fingertips from afar.

Before the sword could move, the sword mind was already breaking through the sky.

Suddenly, the entire audience felt as if two sword minds were rising. They did not see any knife lights or sword shadows, but it was enough to make people feel a chill. It was like some scary swords were piercing their bodies. It made them want to fall back.

After people reacted to this, they noticed the sword mind was only inside the space battleground. It was unable to hurt them as they watched.

“That’s a very powerful sword mind!” Yan Bei Fei’s face changed.

He wasn’t the only one who was shocked. The nobles of all the kingdoms were frozen as they watched.

Han Sen and Zhuo Dong Lai casually moved at the same time. They suddenly reached a spot where the two men could wave their arms for sword airs to cross each other. They did not have the powers of destroying the sky or destroying the ground. Nothing was brought any harm, but it gave people the feeling that an entire army was being slaughtered. Just watching them fight was enough to make people’s blood boil. They wanted to go and kill as well. They wanted to see their blood spill across the yellow sand.

“Today, I have noticed what can be accomplished if one takes up the sword,” a noble who practiced with a sword said with a sigh.

The humans of the universe of kingdoms were obsessed with power, but they lacked power themselves. Thus, the fight between Zhuo Dong Lai and Han Sen was a unique one to witness. It opened people’s eyes to what was possible.

The skills of both men seemed fairly normal. They did not use any powers that could break mountains and rivers. There were no bright lights. Still, every thrust of a knife went into one’s heart. Even the audience felt a chill in their hearts.

In a sword palace to the east, a white-bearded old man sighed and said, “Practicing with the sword costs 50 springs and autumns. Only by watching this sword fight can I truly realize what it means to take up a sword.”

Han Sen was getting excited. He had been in the universe of kingdoms for a long time. On this day, he had finally encountered an elite.

No matter how strong someone’s power was, their power still came from the outside. Only self-knowledge and one’s willpower defined and made someone truly strong. Han Sen thought elites like Zhuo Dong Lai had a powerful sense of willpower and faith. He did not just have extreme power.

Han Sen used all of the sword skills he had learned to do battle with Zhuo Dong Lai.

Zhuo Dong Lai only knew one skill, which was Purple Mist That Comes from the East. He kept on using it, but it had many different facets. There were many layers and moves to use within the same skill set.

One Dollar Sword Mind provided two machines. Four machines resulted in four elephants. Four elephants turned into gossip. To be able to bring a sword skill to this level, it was obvious that Zhuo Dong Lai understood a lot. He was a swordsman who was as good as Lone Bamboo.

He was also different from Lone Bamboo. Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword skills were bright and obvious. They gave people a sense of righteousness. As a person, along with his sword, he gave people a sense of hope and not destruction.

Suddenly, Han Sen fell back. He ran away from the battleground.

Han Sen frowned and looked at Zhuo Dong Lai as he asked, “Why do you want to die?”

Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword skills kept pushing forward, making the fight very intense. In the most intense moment, there was no sense of victory. Han Sen felt he was driving toward death.

Zhuo Dong Lai happily laughed. “I owe someone a life. Now, he wants to take it back. Therefore, I must pay. To be able to die against a swordsman of your talent, I can only say it has been worth it.”

“Can the life you owe only be paid back with your own life?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

“Yes,” Zhuo Dong Lai said with a nod. “Without him, I wouldn’t be here today.” Han Sen replied, “Fine. Use all the power you have to fight me. I want to kill a strong swordsman, not a man with a death wish.” The blood dragon god pulse exploded. His blood-red dragon air almost looked solid. It was like a blood dragon was surrounding Han Sen’s body.

“OK.” Zhuo Dong Lai looked at Han Sen and nodded.

The purple air was like a mist that appeared on Zhuo Dong Lai. It turned into a purple and misty pair of clothes that draped over Zhuo Dong Lai’s body. They created 10,000 purple lights, which made him look like a purple sun god king.

His black hair turned purple. The light was like a sun that gave people warmth.

His eyes were like a sun in the sky staring at everything.

A scary presence suddenly covered all of space. It was like the whole battleground only had light left in it.

“Zhuo Dong Lai used purple mist holy clothes.” Yan Bei Fei sighed.

The purple mist holy clothes moved. It did not matter if Zhuo Dong Lai died or not, but no God Spirit would allow their members to fight a God Spirit’s power to win in a god fight. His God Spirit Blood-Pulse would be taken away. This just proved his God Spirit was no good.

“This strong power matches your sword skills,” Han Sen said with a nod.

“In that case, come,” Zhuo Dong Lai said. “Let me die when it is the brightest time in my life.” His fingers were swords again. This time, it was not just a purple light that appeared on his fingertips. The entire sky looked like it was overwhelmed with a purple light. It seemed as if it all stemmed from his fingertips. The purple mist holy clothes were surrounded by a holy light it. It was like 10,000 misty lights were there.

Zhuo Dong Lai waved his sword. Countless misty lights moved. They unceasingly came roaring at Han Sen. Suddenly, the sky, ground, and space only had a purple sword light in it. It was like a flood or a disaster drowning space. The power of a sword could kill a god or a Buddha. Even a sky full of God Spirits would change their expressions at this sight.

The Annihilation God Spirit gene race’s purple mist holy clothes gene skill and purple mist holy light buff released a misty light that was like Zhuo Dong Lai unleashing a full-power attack. It was too scary to imagine. “Back in the day, Wu Wei Dao Palace’s alpha used one sword to destroy a kingdom,” Yan Dan said with a sigh. “Today, Zhuo Dong Lai is doing something similar. It is a shame he was born in the wrong place and grew up with the wrong person.”
