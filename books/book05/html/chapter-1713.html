<p>“Weak!” Han Sen gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to rebut, but Lan Se’s communicator rang, cutting
him off. She picked it up and said, “This is Lan Se, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Officer Lan, please go to the Steel Mill in the west Something
has happened there,” said a rushed voice on the other end of the
line.</p>
<p>“I will be there in five minutes,” Lan Se replied, her
expression growing tense.</p>
<p>Lan Sen looked at Han Sen, then thought of something. But the
next second, she turned the car around and drove in another
direction.</p>
<p>It was rare to see cars in the Alliance, and Han Sen had never
before had the opportunity to sit in one. It was quite cool,
witnessing her smooth driving skills.</p>
<p>The car was very fast on the streets, as well. And because she
turned on the siren, the cars around would move to let her pass by.
With the siren and her crazy driving skills, Lan Se did indeed make
it to the mill in five minutes.</p>
<p>There were many more cat policemen there, all cordoning off the
area. They were all clad in geno armor, and it was difficult to
distinguish one from another.</p>
<p>“Sit here and do not move. If you run off, Planet Kate’s laws
bid we punish you severely.” Lan Se got out of the car and shut the
door. Then, she went to the middle of the hubbub.</p>
<p>“I should follow you. I don’t know this place, and I’m an
outsider. I’d hate for there to be a misunderstanding,” Han Sen
said, getting out of the car after her.</p>
<p>Lan Se nodded and said, “Okay. But you must do as I say and
don’t make any sudden movements.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen agreed. He could smell something very bloody
coming from the mill, and he wished to see what had happened.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed her. The cops seemed to know who she was, and
none moved to stop her. With haste, she entered the mill.</p>
<p>Once they entered, though, Han Sen frowned. It wasn’t a very
large mill, but there were many bodies scattered across its floors.
The bodies weren’t whole, either. Many of them had been cut open,
and limbs and legs were spread everywhere. It was a terrible
sight.</p>
<p>The bodies were those of cat people, too. They looked as if they
had been ripped apart, and there was no clean-cut, weapon-dealt
damage to the corpses.</p>
<p>What surprised Han Sen the most was that the dead cat people
were also wearing geno armor. But even so, with such strength, it
looked as if they had all been brutally killed with no chance of
fighting back.</p>
<p>“It seems that this place isn’t as safe as I thought it was,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Lan Se moved over to another cop. She looked
down at the bodies, her face gloomy.</p>
<p>The cop said, “They were the night-shift workers here. When the
morning crew came in, they found them like this. There doesn’t
appear to have been any sign of a struggle, break-in, or combat.
And yet, their bodies and geno armor seemed to have been torn off
of them by claws.”</p>
<p>“They did this?” Lan Se looked sicker by the second.</p>
<p>“They could have. We contacted the supervisor, and the leader is
sending a Noble over. They should be here soon,” the cop said.</p>
<p>Lan Se, looking across the mound of bodies, nibbled her lips and
did not say any more.</p>
<p>“Don’t be sad, Se. If it was them, we can still stop them. The
leader will resolve everything.” The cop tried to comfort her. Han
Sen watched while Lan Se examined the crime scene. Things didn’t
seem to be going well.</p>
<p>Not long after, an aircraft landed just outside the mill. A
cold-looking man was sitting inside, and when the cops saw him,
they all parted to provide him a path that led to the scene. And
furthermore, all the cops bowed when the man walked past them.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the man and noticed that he was another cat
man. He had black hair, and the cops referred to him as Mister Hei
Xun.</p>
<p>This Mister Hei Xun gave Han Sen a different feeling than the
others did, but Han Sen couldn’t be certain what the difference
was.</p>
<p>Even Lan Se bowed before Hei Xun, referring to him as “sir.” Han
Sen could at least determine he was the superior amongst them. But
Hei Xun just walked around, telling them he’d handle things from
there on. After that, all the cops departed.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Lan Se to leave, too. On the way, he couldn’t
help but ask, “Who is Hei Xun? He seems powerful.”</p>
<p>“Hei Xun is a Noble who has a geno weapon. You can’t compare
someone like that to normal people.” When Lan Se spoke about Hei
Xun, admiration permeated her voice.</p>
<p>“Can I become a Noble if I obtain a geno weapon?” Han Sen asked,
curious about this prospect.</p>
<p>“Of course. Those who can gain geno weapons are called chosen
ones. They are regarded as Nobles,” Lan Se answered.</p>
<p>“If… I had a geno weapon already, would that mean I would
receive special treatment here?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Lan Se looked at him and said, “If you can generate a geno
weapon, and you were willing to join us, you can most certainly be
treated as well as Mister Hei Xun. You’d be shown much
respect.”</p>
<p>Speaking of that, Lan Se went on to say, “But you are an adult,
and you don’t even have geno armor yet. Your race is weak, so I
don’t think you’ll be able to generate a geno weapon. Just go to
work, and when you’ve got enough money, get lost and go back to
where you came from.”</p>
<p>“What are the requirements for obtaining a geno weapon?” Han Sen
was not angered by her insults, and he just continued asking his
questions.</p>
<p>“You need a good race, for a start. That heightens the chance of
earning one. Don’t you know this? Has your race never generated a
geno weapon before?” Lan Se asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Han Sen gave a wry smile, but he went on to ask, “Are
there any other eligibilities?”</p>
<p>“Not really; they wouldn’t be referred to as the chosen if there
were. On Planet Kate, Nobles are very rare. The younger you are,
the easier it is to generate one, too. There are no eligibilities,
though. Some were quite weak compared to others, when they earned
theirs,” Lan Se said.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and thought to himself, “Can I generate a geno
weapon?”</p>
