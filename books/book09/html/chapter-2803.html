	<p>The old man and Bai Wanjie were in shock. The Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was a supremely important item for
		the Extreme King. If something happened to it, it would affect the Extreme King a lot.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>The black and white eyeballs burst out of the sockets. They were each around the size of a football. Half of each
		was white and half of each was black. They carried a black and white light that was beaming out madly.</p>

	<p>The old man was shocked. His body burst with a silver flame that came out of him like a tsunami. He had to become
		a roaring demon to suppress the black and white eyeballs.</p>

	<p>After a minor touch, the old man’s power vanished. The old man’s demonic power was erased into nothing greater
		than dust. The Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye went right in front of Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body was set free. Before he realized what was going on, the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye went into
		his left eye.</p>

	<p>One was not able to imagine what kind of scene this was. A ball the size of a football went into Han Sen’s left
		eye. His eyes were quite big compared to humans, but they were not as big as footballs.</p>

	<p>Seeing the black and white light explode, the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye went into Han Sen’s eye. It made his
		eyes look like they were erupting like a volcano. It released black and white flames.</p>

	<p>Under that huge amount of pain, Han Sen could not help but hold his eyes. His hands were unable to prevent the
		black and white light from exploding.</p>

	<p>Bai Wanjie and the old man were in shock. They did not know what to do, so they just stood where they were. They
		looked at Han Sen in mid-air. He was just cupping his hands. The black and white light surged out from the gaps
		in his fingers. It turned everything around them black and white. It was like a comic without color.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The entire King’s Kingdom shook a little as if something had broken.</p>

	<p>“Oh, no!” Bai Wanjie’s face turned green. He looked glum. He almost had tears forming. Apparently, something had
		changed with the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye. It had a problem with King’s Kingdom’s defensive system.</p>

	<p>Before Bai Wanjie could think of something more, he saw a few people land nearby. All of their bodies had a scary
		presence. One of them was the Extreme King’s king.</p>

	<p>Bai King looked at Han Sen, who was floating in the air with his left eye spewing out a black and white flame. He
		looked at the old man and asked, “Old Iron, what is going on?”</p>

	<p>“My Lord…” The old man was going to say something, but Bai Wanjie interrupted.</p>

	<p>“Father, it was my fault.” Bai Wanjie kneeled before him and explained what happened.</p>

	<p>“Go and get Mister White.” After Bai King heard this, he did not pin any blame on Bai Wanjie. He only spoke to an
		Extreme King elite.</p>

	<p>The Extreme King elite nodded and quickly disappeared. A moment later, his body reappeared. He had brought Mister
		White with him.</p>

	<p>“Bai, greetings, My Lord.” Mister White bowed to Bai King.</p>

	<p>“Mister White, can you explain what has happened here?” Bai King looked at Mister White. He sounded gentle, but
		there was an inescapable pressure hidden within that was difficult to explain. If he was asking a man with a low
		level of will, even if the man did not make a mistake, he would be expected to kowtow to Bai King.</p>

	<p>Mister White looked at Han Sen, who was floating in the air. He had an ironic smile on his face. He bowed to Bai
		King and said, “It is my fault. Please punish me.”</p>

	<p>“Why would you say that?” Bai King casually asked without moving.</p>

	<p>“I told Mister Crown Prince that the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye could break this xenogeneic’s two extreme
		bodies,” Mister White said with a wry smile. “I did not expect this xenogeneic would be able to attract the
		Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye. This was my fault.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, how did you tell the crown prince?” Bai King asked.</p>

	<p>Mister White explained what he had told him. He sighed and said, “It was my mistake. You can punish me instead.”
	</p>

	<p>Bai King ignored Mister White. He looked at Bai Wanjie, who was kneeling. “Did Mister White tell any lies in his
		story?”</p>

	<p>“No,” Bai Wanjie quietly said with his head lowered. His entire body was quaking.</p>

	<p>“If it was like that when you discovered how strange the sin meter was behaving, why did you not stop it?” Bai
		King asked.</p>

	<p>“I…” Bai Wanjie was suddenly speechless. Mister White had warned him many times that he shouldn’t rush things,
		but all he could think about was the Space Garden and the god’s personality. He did not heed the warnings he had
		been given.</p>

	<p>He knew if he did not explain this, he would have committed a serious crime. He might have even lost his crown
		prince seat.</p>

	<p>“Father, there is one thing I would like to talk to you about in private.” Bai Wanjie gritted his teeth as he
		spoke.</p>

	<p>“Say it.” Bai King did not move, but there was some sort of invisible power spreading that filtered out
		everything else around.</p>

	<p>Bai Wanjie did not dare hide anything. He told him everything about Han Sen and his thoughts regarding it.</p>

	<p>“Did that really happen?” When Bai King heard him, he looked at Han Sen, who was still mid-air, in shock.
		Clearly, the god’s personality thing had surprised him a good deal.</p>

	<p>“It was me being dumb. I was too greedy…” Bai Wanjie lowered his head as he spoke.</p>

	<p>“If you were not ambitious and someone not decisive, you would not be my son.” Bai King changed his tone. “But
		the way you go about things is still immature…”</p>

	<p>Before Bai King finished, they suddenly heard a sound. Patong! They saw Han Sen fall from the air. He fell to the
		ground of the hall. His left eye no longer had a black and white flame in it, but he was not entirely his usual
		self. His left eye looked ordinary. There was a white eyeball with a black pupil. Comparing it to other eyes,
		this eye had no layers. The white eyeball and black pupil were really distinct. It was white like snow and black
		like ink. It did not look lively. It was like a lifeless eye.</p>

	<p>“My Lord, it was me who did not watch carefully and made the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye suffer this
		accident,” the old man apologized. “Please punish me.”</p>

	<p>Bai King waved his hand to stop the old man from talking. “There is no need to do this, Old Iron. You have been
		guarding the Extreme King’s Law Hall for a long time. You have always been good to us. This is not your fault,
		so do not blame yourself.”</p>

	<p>Bai King looked at Han Sen and walked over to him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt terrible. He had no idea what would happen next. Something this huge had happened. Even Bai King had
		come. Han Sen felt like something really bad was going to happen to him soon.</p>

	<p>As he watched Bai King approach him, Han Sen was very glum. He thought, It looks like I am going to have
		something bad happen to me no matter what. I might as well strike first.</p>

	<p>After thinking that, Han Sen got up off the floor. He straightened his body and puffed out his chest. He opened
		his eyes wide and stared at Bai King. He was not going to bow down.</p>
