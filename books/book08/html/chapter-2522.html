<h2>Yellow Clothes</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2522</h3>

<p>Wan’er had been sleeping for a few days straight, and yet, there
was no sign of her waking up anytime soon. That made Han Sen feel a
bit depressed.</p>
<p>The white whale was doing the same as it always was. There was
still no way for them to escape the dimension they were locked in,
and the white tiger pest was still too skittish to get close to
them. Still, whenever a horde of snakes approached the island, it
would make sure to shoo them off.</p>
<p>Everyone still had a mushroom on their heads. The mushrooms
weren’t hurting them, though. Every time Han Sen came back from the
core area, his head would grow a new mushroom. Before he entered
the core area each time, he used his Original Water King Body’s
power to get rid of it and be separated from the mushroom.</p>
<p>Bao’er released the knights of the Extreme King to work on the
ship as deckhands and the like. They didn’t dare disobey, because
doing so would be pointless. Even if they knew their situation,
they wouldn’t dare to leave the safety of the white whale.</p>
<p>Bao’er had her new toys, so she was no longer bored. She carried
around her big carrot that she called ginseng, and she had a bunch
of Extreme King knights that she could freely order around. The
Kings and even half-deifieds were being bossed around like they
were rookies.</p>
<p>The deckhands became more afraid of “Little Captain Bao’er” than
they were of Han Sen or even the little red bird. Whenever her name
was mentioned, the men of the ship would tremble.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s tally of King class genes reached a hundred. Without
hesitation, he increased his Dongxuan Area to the fourth tier. Now
that he had enough King class xenogeneic genes, Han Sen planned on
maxing out his Dongxuan Area before anything else.</p>
<p>Because the Blood-Pulse Sutra and Spell were of little use in
combat, he could only choose between Jadeskin and the Dongxuan
Sutra. The Dongxuan Sutra was harder to improve than Jadeskin, and
it required more power from his self-cogwheel. However,
strengthening that geno art’s area would prove more useful in the
short term.</p>
<p>Whenever he leveled up an area, his fitness and his area’s power
would increase by a lot. Still, Han Sen didn’t notice any
changes.</p>
<p>This lined up with what he had been told about the process. He
would only feel the changes when he became half-deified and his
nine tiers condensed into one. Reaching that level would be like
having all nine tiers of his area combined into one. Stronger than
all that, even.</p>
<p>It was almost time to return to the core area. Dia Robber should
have been in a rush to see him by now. Han Sen used the Dongxuan
Sutra’s self-cogwheel to open the door to the core area.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that after fighting the Gold Armor General, many
more Kings would come seeking him out. Dia Robber was likely going
to be one of many.</p>
<p>Yet when Han Sen entered the core area, he couldn’t see a single
King. He flew for thousands of miles, and yet he found no hide nor
hair of Dia Robber in the core area.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why is no one looking for me? That isn’t normal. Am I
too expensive, and my high prices have scared people away?” Han Sen
looked around in confusion. His performance was so spectacular, how
could others not pay attention and want him?</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was depressed by the lonely stretches of space
around him, he still had to kill a few more xenogeneics. He wasn’t
familiar with the xenogeneics in the core area, and after thinking
about things for a while, he planned to call on the bronze furnace.
It should have been familiar with the core xenogeneics, so his job
would be easiest if it led him to populated areas. It would be
better than wandering around aimlessly, all alone.</p>
<p>After Han Sen returned to the bronze furnace’s planet, he
finally found the bronze furnace. It looked to be in poor
condition, though. A yellow-clothed woman of the Sky was beating it
up. It was trying to flee from her, and it was in a sorry
state.</p>
<p>“This little guy is really unlucky. I beat him up once, and now
he is getting beaten up by a woman,” Han Sen thought with a slight
smile.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen, the bronze furnace flew over to him, crying
all the while. It hid behind Han Sen’s back.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman flew in front of Han Sen, looked at
him, and said, “Are you going to steal my prey?”</p>
<p>“Lady, you misunderstand. I don’t want to do that.” Han Sen
looked at the yellow-clothed woman and then went on to say, “This
furnace is my pet. Please, find it in your heart to let him live on
my account. This core xenogeneic gene will be a gift for your
kindness.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen pulled out a core crystal for the
yellow-clothed woman.</p>
<p>Han Sen had once studied in Sky Palace, and he still planned to
seek out their protection while on the lam. That yellow-clothed
woman was one of the Sky, and so the last thing he wanted was to
make an enemy of her.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman didn’t accept the core xenogeneic gene
from Han Sen. She just looked at him and said, “I need this core
furnace’s material to make a treasure. No other xenogeneic gene can
replace it.”</p>
<p>“Lady, must you really kill it? Is there no other way?” Han Sen
asked patiently.</p>
<p>“There is another way, but it would be annoying,” the
yellow-clothed woman said.</p>
<p>“That is good! As long as there is another way, we’re all set.
Just tell me what it is, and I will do my best to fulfill your
wishes.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman pointed at the bronze furnace and said,
“You aren’t helping me. You are just saving his life.”</p>
<p>“Right. I was wrong. In that case, tell me what to do to save
its life?” Han Sen was still giving her that care-free smile.</p>
<p>“You don’t look like a bad person. If you can hunt a core bronze
tripod with me, then I’ll let the bronze furnace go,” the
yellow-clothed woman said.</p>
<p>“That is no problem. Do you know where the core bronze tripod
can be found?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman looked at Han Sen and said, “Core
bronze tripods aren’t difficult to locate, but they are
half-deified xenogeneics. Can you kill one? Don’t just go there and
get yourself killed.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think highly of my strength, but I do think I can kill
a core bronze tripod. Plus, you will be helping me, too, right?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s go.” The yellow-clothed woman said that and
then flew off in another direction.</p>
<p>“My Lady, might I ask your name?” Han Sen signaled the bronze
furnace to follow them and headed after the woman. The bronze
furnace was terrified of her, and it wouldn’t dare stay close. It
just hid behind Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know your name, either,” the yellow-clothed woman
said.</p>
<p>“My name is Dollar,” Han Sen told her.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound like a name. It sounds more like a title,”
the yellow-clothed woman said.</p>
<p>“All names are just titles, aren’t they?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“In that case, you can just call me Yellow Clothes. It is just a
title, anyway,” the yellow-clothed woman said.</p>
<p>“Lady Clothes, are you a student at Sky Palace?” Han Sen didn’t
tell her his true name. There was no reason for them to be on a
first-name basis, so he picked a name that was easier to
pronounce.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman smiled and said, “What? I’ve never
heard your name before, and you are asking about me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the woman’s temper was strange, and that getting
along with her would be difficult.</p>
<p>Yellow Clothes went on to say, “The core bronze tripod that
we’re hunting is different. Normal half-deifieds cannot defeat it.
You can die within the blink of an eye. Let me see what sort of
geno art and area you are good with. I don’t want you to die and
blame it on me.”</p>
