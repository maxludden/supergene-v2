<h2>Shadow God</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3216</h3>

<p>Han Sen absorbed the Extreme King prince’s water origin, so he
was no stranger to water powers. His movement in the water was not
negatively affected. He looked like a fish that had been given
water.</p>
<p>Wan’er was not affected by the rainbow liquid either. Like a
ghost, she pursued Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I wonder where the guarding temple of the second sky lies,” Han
Sen thought.</p>
<p>In Soldier Knife Sky, Han Sen had to pull out the Inch Grey
Sword to surprise Weapon God. Otherwise, Soldier Knife Sky was so
big that Weapon God would not have known that he and his crew had
entered Soldier Knife Sky without doing so.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Galaxy Teleportation to keep moving through the
water. Even if he was unable to find a god temple, finding the way
that would lead to the third sky was fine too.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the suppressing god temple of each realm would
likely be the exit point.</p>
<p>His Galaxy Teleportation came to an end. Han Sen suddenly felt
his body get stuck by something. He looked around but did not see a
creature. There was still liquid everywhere. He was in a portion of
the sea that had purple liquid.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a closer look and noticed what the problem was. The
purple liquid was shaped like a giant whale. He had gotten stuck
inside the whale’s brain.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Han Sen was there, but the whale-shaped
purple liquid started to move. It swung its tail and started to
swim. It looked like a real whale even though it was a purple
liquid whale. “In this water world sky, all the creatures seem to
be liquid creatures.” Han Sen now fully understood.</p>
<p>The purple liquid whale had just begun to swim when gold light
started to shine. The whale’s body was cut by the gold light. A lot
of purple liquid started to leak out everywhere.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too late to use Galaxy Teleportation because he was
stuck. He could no longer escape, so he had to draw his Inch Grey
Sword. He generated Break World power to stop the gold light.</p>
<p>Dong! The gold light struck the Inch Grey Sword. Han Sen felt
the unstoppable power coming at him. It was like he had been hit by
a bullet train. His body was like a spring as he flew away.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Inch Grey Sword was very weird. It did not
break because of the gold light. On top of that, Han Sen was very
good when it came to borrowing the powers of others and using them
for himself. With that power flying at him, he took it and made the
knockback send him further.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Escaping like that is not the most ideal
method. If I cannot make Wan’er focus on the God Chaos Party, I
will be unable to escape her.”</p>
<p>While he was thinking, he saw a weird building come lurching
through the depths of the water. It was a crystal-like palace in
the midst of the water world. It was not touching the sky or
touching the ground. It was just floating in the water.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at it. The signboard of the palace had three
words written on it: “Liquid God Temple.”</p>
<p>“The guardian here is not a water god. It’s a liquid god. I
wonder what the difference between a water god and a liquid god
is.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He rushed toward the Liquid God Temple
and threw a punch at its door.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Break World power was not an attacking power, but
Liquid God Temple’s door and the small hall beyond was broken.</p>
<p>“Who broke my god temple?” An angry voice sounded from within
the god temple. Han Sen did not bother looking at who it was. He
just used Galaxy Teleportation to go behind the god temple.</p>
<p>“Let’s allow this Liquid God to see Wan’er,” Han Sen said in
silent prayer. Perhaps it was because Han Sen had not done anything
bad recently, but God should have surely realized Han Sen was
well-behaved. He thought there was a fair chance God would enable
things to go his way.</p>
<p>Liquid God stormed out of the god temple. He saw Wan’er, who was
pursuing Han Sen. He thought it was Wan’er who had destroyed his
temple, so he immediately flung his tentacles toward the lady.</p>
<p>Liquid God looked very weird. He kind of looked like an octopus
or a jellyfish. His body was transparent like water. He had many
tentacles and rainbow-like liquid flowing around him.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Liquid God’s tentacles go to snare and tie her up,
Wan’er’s body blazed with gold fire. It was like a sharp blade that
was going to cut up Liquid God’s tentacles.</p>
<p>“Naive. Liquid cannot be attacked. It is everywhere. No kind of
attack can do anything to me.” Before Liquid God could say anything
else, his body was turned into nothing by the gold fire. There was
not even a drop of water left.</p>
<p>The shiny god light was still there though. It turned the
crystal-like Liquid God Temple into nothing.</p>
<p>The entire god temple was incinerated. Not even a god base
remained.</p>
<p>Han Sen was terrified. His Super God Spirit mode had
invincibility. His attacks were always improved with it, but it was
nothing compared to what she was able to do.</p>
<p>Obviously, Wan’er’s power was aggressive. It was the opposite of
Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>From now on, aside from the Inch Grey Sword in Han Sen’s hand,
he did not think there was another item in existence that could
shield him from an attack unleashed by Wan’er.</p>
<p>Bao’er had been sitting on Han Sen’s shoulder the entire time.
She pointed forward as she said, “Dad, it looks like there is
something at 11 o’clock.” Han Sen looked where she was pointing and
saw a giant swirl manifest in the liquid of the realm. It was like
a black hole. It conducted very strong movements in space. “Is that
the entrance to the third sky?” Han Sen immediately rushed toward
the vortex. Liquid God had just been delivered a nasty strike and
killed by Wan’er.</p>
<p>After that, God Chaos Party was going to have a grudge with
Wan’er. At this point, Han Sen’s plan to draw the disaster to the
east had halfway succeeded.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was going to go to the third sky, in God Chaos
Party’s headquarters, God Chaos Party’s core members and leaders
opened a screen of light. It panned through Water World Sky.</p>
<p>A God Chaos Party member angrily stated, “Liquid God from the
main headquarters is gone. Liquid God Temple is gone. Who dared do
this to us?”</p>
<p>Another member of the God Chaos Party coldly said, “If I have
guessed things correctly, the person has now entered the third sky.
Let third sky’s Shadow God check the enemy out.”</p>
<p>“Contact Shadow God,” the leader said as he looked across the
members before him.</p>
<p>The screen of light quickly displayed a circus-clown like God
Spirit gene race. The clown took off its hat and bowed. “My Leader,
what is it that you require?”</p>
<p>“An enemy has invaded Thirty-Three Days,” the leader said. “He
will be in the third sky now.”</p>
<p>“Do you want the intruder dead or alive?” Shadow God politely
asked with a weird smile. “Who dares stir up disasters in
Thirty-Three Days?” God Chaos Party Leader coldly asked. “Whoever
it is, I will not allow someone like that to exist.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” Shadow God said with a laugh. His eyes looked a
bit evil. “Do not worry, Leader.”</p>
<p>“By the way, open your spirit light screen,” the leader said. “I
want to watch you kill the invader.”</p>
<p>“OK, Leader. Await my performance with bated breath. I will not
disappoint you.” Shadow God walked out of the god temple.</p>
