    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The man yanked the chain, and a powerful force tugged Han Sen towards him.
      Han Sen was shocked, but he let go of the Flaming Rex Spike that had
      become entangled with the chain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his Snow-Lady beast soul and combined with it, returning
      the rex spike as he did so.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man lashed his black chain, which had split into a thousand smaller
      snakes that sought to latch onto Han Sen. If he didn&#8217;t do something,
      he&#8217;d be covered in a legion of the slithering fiends.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;m dead. Did you just want someone to die alongside
      you, so you didn&#8217;t have to die alone? I have never had a boyfriend,
      and I have never had sex. I don&#8217;t want to die yet!&#8221; The
      short-haired lady was still under Han Sen&#8217;s arm, and seeing the
      black chains, she almost started to cry.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then Han Sen moved his body. With the lady in-hand, he managed to
      weave and evade every single chain lash.
    </p>

    <p>
      The attacker looked spooked, and so he lashed his chain again. The black
      chain that he wielded looked alive, and it turned into a toxic snake that
      tried to snap and bite Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ran between the chains, and no matter how frightening the weapon
      was, it could not touch him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m going to die! I&#8217;m going to die!&#8221; The
      short-haired lady felt like a passenger in a car, driving at top-speed
      along a cliffside. Any second, the car might tip and send her plummeting
      to the distant ground below. The short-haired lady&#8217;s eyes were
      starting to water.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had the skills to dodge the attacks, however; if the short-haired
      lady had been left to her own devices, she&#8217;d have been snatched up
      by the chain in an instant. But still, being held by Han Sen and having
      her life put entirely within his hands was more terrifying than anything
      else imaginable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face was starting to look gloomy, though, and he was
      already pushing his Dongxuan Sutra to the max. All he could do was
      continue to dodge the man&#8217;s chain, and no matter how much he tried,
      he couldn&#8217;t find a window of opportunity sufficient for him to make
      an exit.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is a super spirit, that&#8217;s for sure. But why has it been
      locked up in here like this?&#8221; Han Sen pondered the peculiarity of
      spirit&#8217;s situation, as he observed the hall in between his evasions
      of the attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no statue in the hall, just one black pillar. There were two
      black chains that were each as thick as an arm. They were wielded by the
      spirit, yes, but they were attached to the pillar through exposed wounds
      in the man&#8217;s chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man had less than one meter leniency in movement, and the chain he
      used was one of the two that bound him to the pillar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used dongxuan aura but was unable to observe the man&#8217;s
      energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tried escaping six times, but his withdrawal was prohibited each
      time by the chain.
    </p>

    <p>
      But still, the chain had yet to hit him, and Han Sen&#8217;s continued
      evasion was fueled by his simulation of Light Son of God&#8217;s energy
      flow through Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact that he was up against a chained-up super spirit began to grate
      on Han Sen, however. He believed he should have had more than what it took
      to defeat such a foe, and his inability to do so made him sulk. Still, he
      knew it would be best for him to try to escape right then, and so that was
      where he utilized his power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every time he attempted to flee, he was pulled back for some reason. He
      didn&#8217;t feel anything, but the short-haired lady was in tears as if
      she was riding a rollercoaster.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had screamed so much, she had now lost her voice. With a sobbing,
      tear-drenched face, all she could do was helplessly remain carried in Han
      Sen&#8217;s arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he was unable to observe the man&#8217;s energy flow, he could
      still memorize the pattern and methodology of how the man used the chain.
      If he learnt his chain skill and understood all his movements, he could
      escape the spirit hall without issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the spirit itself was chained to the pillar and unable to
      move. If it wasn&#8217;t chained up, he wouldn&#8217;t have concerned
      himself with fighting the spirit, and would have just summoned his little
      angel instead .
    </p>

    <p>
      But battles such as this were very educational for Han Sen. He rarely
      encountered a weapon such as this, so viewing it was quite the surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was now getting quite excited. He almost forgot about the crying
      woman under his arm. His mind excitedly raced to find a way in which he
      might shatter the chain that was used against him.
    </p>

    <p>
      After an hour of this, Han Sen finally managed to exit the hall. The
      spirit&#8217;s full power was undoubtedly restricted by its binding.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why is that spirit chained up here? There is no statue or spirit
      stone here; it&#8217;s pretty strange to say the least.&#8221; Because he
      had no spirit stone, Han Sen had no particular interest in killing the
      spirit. Killing him did not provide Han Sen any benefit, and instead, it
      might only aid his attacker. If the spirit died, it would simply respawn
      at its own spirit stone, and it would not be trapped like it was now.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You damn pervert; let me go!&#8221; The short-haired lady, whose
      face was painted with dried-up tear marks, felt her waist begin to hurt.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sorry; I forgot all about you.&#8221; Han Sen only now remembered
      he was carrying a beautiful lady. He put her back and removed the platinum
      chain he had used to bind her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The short-haired lady tried to stand up, but her waist was very sore. Her
      whole body was feeling numb, too. She stood up halfway, but then stumbled
      and fell back into Han Sen&#8217;s arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen helped her stand up straight, smiled, and said, &#8220;Lady, I
      know I am handsome but please slow down. There is no need to literally
      throw yourself into my arms. I am not willing to date just anyone. It is
      important that we get to know each other first.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You go to hell!&#8221; The lady pushed Han Sen away and sat down on
      a stone stair, feeling somewhat crippled. She then began rubbing her sore
      waist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to flirt with the lady for a bit longer and perhaps come to
      learn of what might have happened here. But suddenly, he felt a scary
      presence dawn someplace outside the city walls. It was moving quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen seemed glum and looked out towards the city gate. He asked the
      short-haired woman, &#8220;Lady, aside from this spirit, do any other
      horrible creatures reside in the area?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The short-haired lady did not answer. Han Sen heard loud footsteps,
      however, and then he saw a creature that looked like a cat. It looked like
      a cat, but it was as large as an elephant. It had orange fur and was
      stomping towards them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen frowned. With the life force he could sense, he acknowledged it as
      a super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Orange, good timing! This big pervert has been trying to
      bully me; so get over here and kick his ass.&#8221; The short-haired lady
      saw the super creature and suddenly looked overjoyed. She leapt onto the
      back of the cat and stroked its head. With a paw, it pointed towards Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature used its big round eyes to look at Han Sen, and then let out
      a fearsome cry.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Meow!&#8221;</p>
