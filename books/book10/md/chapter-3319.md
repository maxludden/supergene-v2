The Story of Genes brought a Break World power that completely destroyed the gene messages.

The geno tablet that originally suppressed his body relinquished its control. Han Sen was let free. The Dongxuan Armor generated a black set of armor, but it was burning with a white flame. Black and white, the two colors, made a strong contrast.

“Huh? How can the genes of your body produce such grand changes?” The emotionless geno tablet made some unexpected confusing sounds. It was as if it was unable to understand.

Han Sen was no longer in the mood to talk nonsense with it. After his body was freed, he wanted to use his Galaxy Teleportation to get out of the geno tablet.

No matter which direction he went or how far he went, all he could see was an endless sea of stars. It was like that place was incredibly big.

The geno tablet’s sounds were in Han Sen’s head again. “Weird. The genes of your body have the shadow of a super gene, but it is just a replica of the real thing. The geno arts you practice are still on a testing level. They have great flaws, yet they can make the genes of your body evolve to this level. How could this have happened?”

Along with the geno tablet’s voice, numerous tentacles were emerging in the sea of stars. They came racing toward Han Sen. His xenogeneic body’s speed was not enough to avoid the tentacles. His body was quickly snared.

The power, which looked like electricity, came crackling out of the appendages. They made Han Sen feel as if his body was quaking. He immediately released The Story of Genes’ Break World power. Under the explosion of white flames, it made Han Sen’s body suddenly feel as if he had an unlimited amount of power.

Jadeskin’s Break World power was buffed by The Story of Genes. It made it clearer. It made Han Sen’s genes more stable. The electricity from the tentacles could no longer get into his body.

“Good.” Han Sen was very happy. He cast the Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power. The structure of the tentacles, which he could not analyze before, were now able to be seen via his eyes.

“Super Spank!” Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power exploded. It made the tentacles capturing Han Sen shatter.

The Story of Genes’ Break World power was not special by itself, but it greatly improved the three geno arts in Han Sen’s body. It was like his body had become extra strong because of it.

That was especially true of his xenogeneic mode. It worked on his body but on the three geno arts more.

The geno tablet’s voice sounded again. “You are truly a very weird creature. Your soul genes are not strong, but the fact you can evolve to this level is truly remarkable.”

This time, the weird, giant planet, appeared. It was impossible to tell where it came from, but it was now directly in front of Han Sen.

The giant planet twisted in its spot as a countless number of transparent tentacles came wriggling out to snare Han Sen. He was able to break each and every one of the tentacles. Even so, it only led to the development of more coming his way. They lecherously wished to snatch up his body. When they grabbed a hold of him, they yanked him into the planet.

Light flickered across the tentacles. It was like there was a substance going into Han Sen’s body, but the Jadeskin-looking body shut them out.

Han Sen tried his best to destroy the tentacles, but the tentacles were simply endless.

“Very interesting genes. Although you are not the life I wanted, such an interesting life and genes could make you suitable for becoming a part of my body.” When Han Sen heard that, his body froze. Something was latching onto his back, but he didn’t know what it was.

Some weird bones were coming out of his back to lock up Han Sen. From afar, Han Sen looked as if he had been snared by a skeleton.

“Argh!” Han Sen’s body was locked up by a skeleton. He could not move freely. It felt as if the skeleton was sticking needles into his body.

“The Super God Spirit mode!” Han Sen used his Super God Spirit mode. He wanted to use his spirit body to shake off the skeleton that had him in its grip.

Nothing he tried seemed to work. His spirit body was firmly snared by the skeleton, and he was unable to escape it. The bones inside his body were like syringes stripping him of his power.

“Interesting genes. I cannot believe that you are an ordinary soul gene and have been able to evolve a gene to this level.” A voice came from the skeleton. It sounded exactly like the voice Han Sen had been listening to earlier.

“Who on earth are you?” Han Sen used his Super Spank power. He could not free himself from the clutch of the skeleton.

“I told you that I am the geno tablet,” the geno tablet said as its voice returned.

“In that case, why are you here waiting for the leader of the God Chaos Party?” Han Sen held himself strong against the pain that was pulling the marrow from his bones. He gnashed his teeth.

Han Sen was curious, but he was not that curious in a life-and-death moment.

The reason he asked that was purely because he wished to make an important decision.

“He is the real master here,” the geno tablet replied. “It is my job to wait for him to come back and command. There is no why.”

Han Sen was depressed. People could come there to be a boss, but he was there to have his genes stolen by the geno tablet. That was a bad sort of treatment.

The geno tablet’s reply gave Han Sen an answer to a private decision.

“I hope big sky demon did not lie to me.” Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He gathered up power in his finger and used it like a knife. He went into the sea of stars.

The endless sea of stars was the geno tablet. Carving into the sea of stars was basically carving into the geno tablet. Han Sen could not get rid of the geno tablet, so he had to risk the 24-spell password that big sky demon had given him.

If God Chaos Party Leader was the master of the geno tablet, and if the 24-spell password was real, it would work on the geno tablet.

Knife light appeared on Han Sen’s middle finger. He used Super Spank to slash the sea of stars. He left many knife marks across the sea of stars.

the knife marks were messed up. They did not make the password.

“Stop wasting your breath,” the geno tablet’s voice sounded in Han Sen’s ear. “I am connected to the universe, and I am a part of it. It should be an honor for you to become a part of my body.”

“I do not want any honor. All I want is to kill you.” Han Sen gnashed his teeth. His body tremored. The pain of having his power being taken away was not something ordinary people could endure.

“Death is pointless for me, and your power is useless at trying to destroy the geno tablet,” the geno tablet explained. “Unless the universe itself is destroyed, the geno tablet will recover.”

“Oh, yeah? Well, how about this?” Han Sen asked. His middle finger arose. A scary knife light landed across the sea of stars. He slashed a big knife mark across the sea of stars.

After that slash, all the messed-up knife marks Han Sen had unleashed came back. Earlier, it might have looked like he was doodling. Now, it had all come together to compose a spell. Han Sen added the last slash on every password. It lit up.
