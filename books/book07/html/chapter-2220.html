<h2>Stealing the Stone Slab</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2220</h3>

<p>That stone tile was lying amidst the rubble, and in order to
pull it out, Han Sen would have to remove the cluster of rocks that
buried it. Unfortunately, the two Dukes were still present. It’d be
impossible to retrieve the stone without disturbing them.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to think of a way that he could grab the stone
tile without drawing their attention.</p>
<p>Killing the two Dukes wouldn’t be difficult for Han Sen, but if
he wasted them, it’d alert Edward that someone had found the ruins.
It would prompt the Inspector to investigate, at the very
least.</p>
<p>After all, the only non-xenogeneic residents of that planet were
the Ice Blue Knights. Edward’s target would be someone from the
base.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s best bet was to steal the stone tile while avoiding
drawing the guards’ notice. It would save him a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>But that Fire Bear and hybrid Dragon maintained their position
atop the statue. They were facing the direction of the tile, and so
taking it would be impossible for now.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, Han Sen abandoned the stone hall. He
looked around the city and realized that he was currently in a
desert with no creatures. There were no xenogeneics for Han Sen to
lure their way.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen returned to the well and summoned Little
Star. He put Little Invisible on Little Star’s back, then asked the
hidden Little Star to steal the tile.</p>
<p>Little Star could fetch things and move them through solid
materials. He could just grab the stone tile through the rubble
without attracting any attention.</p>
<p>Han Sen only had to distract the two Dukes long enough for
Little Star to make the tile disappear. That way, there would be no
trace left behind, as the rest of the stones wouldn’t have been
moved.</p>
<p>After Little Star entered, he phased into the pile of stone
rubble, and while the two Dukes were looking away, he swallowed the
stone tile and slipped away with it.</p>
<p>“Nice job!” Little Star and Little Invisible brought the stone
tile back to him, and their success made Han Sen very happy. He
tucked the stone tile into his pocket and took his companions with
him to exit the city via the underwater channels beneath the
well.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to the area he was supposed to be patrolling,
and then he placed Bai Wenxuan inside Destiny’s Tower. He took Ji
Qing with him to slay more xenogeneics, but while they were
fighting, their recorder broke.</p>
<p>The content inside the recorder couldn’t be deleted. They had
filmed Bai Wenxuan, and so the device had to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to the base to pick up another recorder, and
things went well. No one was suspicious. The xenogeneics apparently
had a habit of breaking recorders.</p>
<p>When everything was settled, Han Sen went to his room in the
base to rest. He also took the time to research the stone tile he
had retrieved.</p>
<p>The stone tile looked very ordinary. The slab itself was only
around the size of a man’s hand. There were no words or symbols on
it. It had a slight curvature, sort of like a stone plate.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Purple-Eye Butterfly lens to examine it, but he
couldn’t analyze its composition. He was unable to find out how it
had been created.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t find out anything more that way, he put the
stone plate away.</p>
<p>Han Sen gathered his team and readied himself to kill
xenogeneics again, and in a stroke of luck, the knights ordered
them to clear out Lava Valley.</p>
<p>The team that was previously in charge of clearing Lava Valley
had the misfortune to encounter a fiery Duke monster in the Lava
Sea. Due to the injuries they had sustained, they were no longer
able to work that area, hence the need for another team to be sent
in their stead.</p>
<p>Few teams wished to go there, due to the inherent dangers of the
locale. But the other groups quickly began recommending Han Sen and
his team.</p>
<p>Han Sen happily accepted the task, as he wanted to go there
anyway. He hadn’t expected things to work out this well, though. He
didn’t even have to think of an excuse for going there. Without
saying much, Han Sen rallied his comrades and took them to Lava
Valley. His enthusiasm made the officer who had given him the task
quite confused.</p>
<p>The valley was as long and winding as a dragon, and it stretched
into the distance beyond what their eyes could see. Lava bubbled
and spurted all around them, flecks of molten material rising like
steam. Fire-attuned xenogeneics were everywhere. Many bird
xenogeneics flitted back and forth near the walls of the valley,
trying to capture the fiery xenogeneics—such as the fire bugs—that
came from the banks of the river.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the Fire Crows. They were only a few centimeters
long, but their red bodies flew so fast that it was hard to see
that they actually had wings. They swirled around each other in a
mass, like red clouds hovering over the valley floor.</p>
<p>The murders of Fire Crows swarmed and swirled over the lava
river. They often swooped down to the surface of the lava stream
and ate any fire bugs they could catch.</p>
<p>After the Fire Crows caught the fire bugs, they would return to
their nests perched in the higher walls. There, they’d feed their
baby Fire Crows.</p>
<p>The Fire Crows had advanced reproductive abilities. They could
make babies every few months. If they didn’t require such an
extreme environment, their numbers would surely overtake the entire
planet.</p>
<p>Ji Qing wished to show off. Upon seeing a swarm of Fire Crows,
she drew her weapon and rushed towards them.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t hold back, either, as he immediately sent a
rocket toward the Fire Crows.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Viscount Finger Fire Crow killed. Xenogeneic gene
found. Obtained Finger Fire Crow beast soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen never got tired of hearing that announcement. He quickly
went to check what sort of beast soul he had gotten.</p>
<p>Viscount beast soul Finger Fire Crow: Halo-type</p>
<p>Han Sen froze. Halo beast souls were rare, but what he really
wanted was a weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned the Finger Fire Crow beast soul, and a flaming
halo appeared around his feet. It was like there was a fiery bird
circling around his legs. His body looked red.</p>
<p>When Han Sen attacked, his attacks would deal fire damage.</p>
<p>“A ring that deals fire damage. Hmm, it’s a shame there’s only
one of them.” Han Sen felt depressed. Combining the Sun Raven beast
soul with that would be a waste.</p>
<p>Luckily, there were many types of fiery birds occupying Lava
Valley. Han Sen had to look for a more suitable target. If he was
unable to find one that was suitable, he would have to think about
settling for the Fire Crow.</p>
<p>While Han Sen began to work his way across Lava Valley, slaying
xenogeneics as he went, a naked man with blonde hair was headed for
Ghost Bone Town. He was smiling, and his body looked like Apollo’s.
He was one of the Extreme Kings.</p>
<p>“Mister Edward.” The Fire Bear Duke and the hybrid Dragon saw
the Extreme King man approaching. They bowed very respectfully to
him.</p>
<p>Edward nodded. He looked around the hall, then stopped near the
stone rubble and frowned. “Have you moved anything in the
hall?”</p>
<p>The two looked very frightened, and so they said, “We have been
following your orders exactly. We haven’t moved from that statue
since you ordered us there, nor have we moved anything in the
hall.”</p>
<p>Edward nodded and asked, “Have you seen anything strange
around?”</p>
<p>“Nothing has been strange,” the two said after a moment of
thought.</p>
<p>Edward looked at the rubble. He thought for a while, then told
the two guards to remain on the statue. He turned and left Ghost
Bone Town.</p>
