<h2>Time Etching</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2982</h3>

<p>The whole of space in the area of the god temple was twisted.
Nothing was visible with any ordinary clarity. This was what the
deified elites could see, but even their vision started to become
distorted. It was like a shadow in the water. When the water moved,
the vision twisted.</p>
<p>Moment God held his time bracelet. He mumbled words like a
Buddha speaking for the dead. In that twisted parcel of space,
Moment God’s body was like a sky god covering the whole of the god
temple’s sky. Han Sen was like a tiny ant. “Accept a god’s anger…
Time etching…” Moment God’s god voice was loud. He raised the
bracelet that was in his hands. The needless present in the 12
eyeballs was spinning madly.</p>
<p>In one moment, Han Sen felt as if he could see the flow of time
with his eyes. All the numbers in the 12 eyes fired out some weird,
twisted lights. The light connected them in the 12 eyes. It was
like a giant net covering the entire god temple’s area. Han Sen did
not have a space to avoid it. He could not find a place to be
safe.</p>
<p>1g</p>
<p>He saw the weird light cross together like a net. It was coming
down. Han Sen pushed his Dongxuan Aura to the max, but he still
could not stop the twisting lines of time that were descending</p>
<p>The time light’s line landed on Han Sen’s Dongxuan Armor. It was
like a laser and left some weird markings on it. It was like a
symbol that represented time. It scrawled across the entire battle
armor’s surface.</p>
<p>“This is…” Han Sen noticed his body did not get injured.
Instead, his whole body was marked. The markings were releasing a
weird sort of power.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to raise his hands and see what had been etched
into his armor and what it meant for him. He shockingly found out
his arm was no longer listening to him. He was unable to move it.
“Why is this happening?” Han Sen quickly discovered that it was not
just his arm. His whole body was unable to move. He was not even
able to cast a geno art.</p>
<p>Han Sen was feeling very strange. Although he was unable to
move, he still felt his body existed. He was able to feel his
body’s presence flowing. Everything seemed to be normal. Whenever
he wanted to do something, his hands, legs, and presence
listened.</p>
<p>This feeling was very weird. It was like a ghost crushing him.
He felt everything but could not move.</p>
<p>Moment God looked at Han Sen coldly. The god blood was still
flowing from his eye sockets. He was holding the bracelet while he
said, “Stop wasting your breath. Your time is already being erased.
There is nothing you can do about it now. You can only accept god’s
punishment. That is the result of your blasphemy toward a God
Spirit.”</p>
<p>What Moment God said was very simple. Han Sen understood what he
meant because he had practiced a time area geno art. He knew
something about time element powers.</p>
<p>Moment God had just reminded him a little, so Han Sen knew what
the time etching power could do.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was not paralyzed because the time etching wiped
off his body for a while.</p>
<p>It was hard to explain. Normally, when Han Sen wanted to do
something, once his mind set it up, his body reacted. The time
etching marks erased his body for a while. When Han Sen had the
idea to move, the time would be empty afterward. He needed to wait
until the empty time was over. Then, Han Sen’s body would have the
needed reaction.</p>
<p>It was like playing a video game and the internet suddenly
lagged. The time in between was wiped away. When the internet came
back, the body reacted.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how long that empty time was. After seeing
Moment God’s very relaxed face, he knew it would not be anytime
soon.</p>
<p>Moment God’s hands were clutching the bloody eyeball necklace.
He walked toward Han Sen. The sockets that had god blood coldly
looked at Han Sen. They were going to touch Han Sen’s face.</p>
<p>He licked his lips and smiled evilly. Moment God then said, “I
thought you were so good at fighting. I am standing right here. Why
are you not moving?” Han Sen wanted to slap him 1,000 or 10,000
times, but it was a shame his body would not listen. The time
etching erased the time he had in his body. He was not even able to
speak.</p>
<p>“Don’t say I did not give you a chance. If you don’t move now,
you will receive god’s punishment.” Moment God weirdly laughed. He
reached out his hand and moved forward to grab Han Sen’s head. “It
looks like I will have to use this.” Han Sen gently closed his
eyes. He was going to use Super God Spirit mode. At this time, the
Super God Spirit body was not going to be affected. With Wan’er’s
effect, his Super God Spirit mode would not last long, but it was
enough. Moment God was very close to him. His awareness was very
low. He only needed one moment to take Moment God’s life.</p>
<p>Moment God’s face had a bloody smile. The claw, which looked
like a very sharp talon, drew closer to Han Sen’s head. Clearly, he
did not want Han Sen to die a swift death.</p>
<p>“Do you want to live? Beg before me. Perhaps I will show you a
speck of mercy and let you, a low-life, cheap creature, continue
your pitiful existence.” Moment God weirdly laughed as he
spoke.</p>
<p>The creatures watching the fight saw Dollar being suppressed by
Moment God. He was unable to move, so it was needless to say they
were shocked.</p>
<p>Although Dollar was not the real No. 1 fighter on the god list,
his real power put him in the top 10. Yet here he was getting
suppressed by a Disaster class God Spirit by such an obscene
amount. How was anyone supposed to not feel shocked?</p>
<p>This was just a Disaster class God Spirit. Above Disaster class
were Annihilation and Reboot. There were two higher classes of god
spirits. They must have been absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p>“We are just creatures of the universe. We cannot fight God
Spirits. Only by becoming God Spirits ourselves can we shed the
trappings of our mortal body. That way, we can become superior
lifeforms.” Many creatures thought that.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just watching Moment God. Although he was not able
to speak, even if he could, he would not beg for his life before
Moment God. That equaled making a wish to Moment God. Han Sen had
briefly been a God Spirit. He knew making a wish like that would
cost him a fortune.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes made Moment God feel so annoyed. They made him so
angry that he coldly said, “If you want to die, I will do as
you</p>
<p>ask.”</p>
<p>After that, the claws sped up. They came slashing toward Han
Sen’s head. Han Sen was unable to fight back. He watched the claws
land on his head.</p>
<p>“Stop it!” A voice sounded from beyond the god temple. The voice
was so slow that no one noticed a body flying into the god temple’s
plaza.</p>
<p>Because of that moment, Han Sen’s body shone brightly. He was
like a volcano erupting. His body armor was covered by the time
etching marks. It turned into a bright white color.</p>
