“You should just come out and meet with your real body.” Han Sen used his will to talk to Qin Xiu’s clone. The ice-jade jian he had become suddenly started to fly. It carried ice-jade light and pierced through the woman’s forehead.

Usually, the soul of a member of the soldiers was transferred to the victor of combat. The fighters would live together and die together. If a member of the soldiers was killed, the holy weapon was killed with it.

Breaking the saw sword was not easy. On the other hand, breaking the woman’s head was quite easy.

The woman’s eyes looked extremely cold. She held the handle of the sword. The saw sword in her hands kept hitting the ice-jade jian Han Sen had become.

The sword slashed outward. It was like the woman’s body had been absorbed by the saw sword. It combined with the saw sword. It carried a scary sword light in a rage-fueled lash toward the ice-jade jian.

Dong!

Outside the ice-jade jian, the ice-jade shield broke. The saw sword and ice-jade jian struck each other. They cut into the ice-jade jian. When the ice-jade jian was almost cut out, the sword power was gone.

In the next second, the saw sword became nothing more than dust that flew away. A voice rang out and played in Han Sen’s head. “I will be waiting in front of the geno tablet.”

Han Sen knew that had to be Qin Xiu’s true self. It was not just a powerful and empty clone.

Han Sen thought, “If Qin Xiu said he will be waiting for me in the 33rd sky, that means he is actually incapable of coming down to the first sky. I can become the leader of the first sky. That much is certain.”

Han Sen was not really too concerned about such prospects as becoming a leader of a sky or getting the geno tablet. He only wanted to find Bao’er. If he found her now, he would immediately exit the 33 skies.

Unfortunately, things had not gone too well for him. Han Sen brought the little girl with him on his journey. They scoured the land for a very long time without seeing any sign of where Bao’er might be. He met many members of the soldiers along the way.

Every time he killed a member of the soldiers, the little girl’s body grew stronger. She steadily and sharply grew up.

In a few days of this, the little girl was already a 15- or 16-year-old young lady. Her speed and power were stronger.

Because she lacked the power to refine Han Sen’s soul mark, she could not resonate with him. She was unable to use Han Sen’s power for herself. So, she was not like the other members of the soldiers. She did not have armor for protection either. She had to use her body to fight.

Han Sen had been looking around that place for days. He was unable to find Bao’er, but the geno tablet was glowing. The 25th sky was taken. It now had a leader.

“The 25th sky’s leader is Human King.”

“Is that Human King who belongs to Blood Legion?” After hearing the name, Han Sen was given a shock. It was likely that only the leader of Blood Legion would have the audacity to use such terms. He was the alpha of the Humans and straight from the sanctuaries.

Upon seeing those two words, the humans of the universe of kingdoms were angered. They had never seen someone so crazy who would go so far as to declare himself the king of all humans.

The fights across the 33 skies became far worse. Many scary creatures tried to attack the 33 skies. They tried to fight and claim a sky for themselves that they could lead.

Han Sen had now looked all over Soldier Weapon Sky. He had yet to find Bao’er. He was also unable to find a way that might take him to the next tier or realm of the 33 skies. It made him feel weird.

Suddenly, Han Sen had a thought cross his mind. His expression grew dim upon the realization. “It cannot be that when a creature enters the 33 skies, they do not all come to the first sky. They are spread out all across the 33 skies. If things are like that, then it will be very tough finding Bao’er. I don’t have a clue which sky Bao’er might have been tossed into.”

“Plus, when the 33 skies returned to their origin, the space tunnels between them ceased to exist. I cannot go to the other skies of the 33 skies. The only way I might be able to do that is to become the leader of this sky. I will reach the geno tablet no matter what. If Bao’er ends up as the leader of another sky, perhaps I will be able to see her there.”

Without finding Bao’er, Han Sen had to keep going with his determination to kill all members of the soldiers he could find. The soldiers could be weak or strong. It was a mixed pot since their powers all came from the weapons they wielded. The stronger a holy soldier was, the stronger their wielder would become. It would also be the reverse. They could end up weaker.

Soldier Weapon Sky was home to countless weapons. To find and draw a strong weapon was not easy. Not everyone had a chance to pull out a sword as powerful as Han Sen or the purple copper sword.

They kept on battling, but they had to encounter a formidable foe. All the soldiers were killed by Han Sen.

Ever since the little girl reached the age of 16 or 17, she stopped growing up.

“Little Black, you are so strong!” Han Sen cut down another member of the soldiers, which made the girl clutch Han Sen and hug him tightly.

Although Han Sen did not like the name he had been given, he was unable to talk to her. He had to just accept it.

“How do I become the leader of the Soldier Weapon Sky?” Han Sen had been thinking a lot about that question.

In the 33 skies, seven of the skies had already been claimed. He only knew that killing members of the soldiers was one route to becoming the leader of Soldier Weapon Sky.

He had killed many soldiers by this point, yet he had not yet become the leader.

Over the course of the past two days, he only found one member of the soldiers to eliminate. It seemed to him as if he might have already killed almost all the soldiers out there.

Han Sen wondered, “Do I have to kill every single member of the soldiers to become a leader? Weird. Why have I been unable to encounter the purple copper sword again? That guy’s power was, admittedly, rather scary. With his power, he could certainly create a stir in Soldier Weapon Sky. Why have I been unable to find him?”

The geno tablet started to glow again. Light Goddess lit up the seventh sky. She became the leader of the seventh sky.

Whenever a leader popped up, Han Sen felt depressed. His heart sank every time he did not see Bao’er’s name. He took it as a form of bad news.

“Bao’er, please do not let anything awry happen to you.” As Han Sen worried profusely, he saw a purple sword light break space and approach him. It was the purple copper sword that had been missing for days.

When Han Sen saw the purple copper sword, he did not see the member soldier that might have been wielding the purple copper sword.

The purple copper sword flew to a space not too far away from Han Sen. Through its will, it spoke to Han Sen. “Obscene Old Jian, are you going to fight me?”

Han Sen did not know the purple copper sword was Demon Alpha Asura. After it flew over, Han Sen laughed and asked, “What do you want to bet with this time?”
