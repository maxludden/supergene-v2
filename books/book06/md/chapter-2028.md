“This Infinite Buddha is a xenogeneic. It seems that there are many xenogeneics amongst the Buddha.” Han Sen stared at Infinite Buddha, but he didn’t move.

Infinite Buddha looked like an angry King Kong. He put his hands together, and then, lots of stars began to fly together and form one large cluster.

As the power built, the stars became brighter and brighter. Still, their sizes remained the same. And by the end, the stars looked like miniature suns. They looked very scary.

“The Buddha’s Infinite Galaxy geno art is powerful, but it takes too long to generate. Using it to attack Han Sen, who is not being offensive, is a good idea,” Sharon said, with a laugh.

The Dragon lady also laughed, and she said, “This time, Han Sen will have to move. No matter how powerful his Empty White Teeth is, there’s still a limit. With Han Sen’s power, he won’t be able to return Infinite Galaxy’s power.”

“Yup. Infinite Buddha has not struck yet, and he is still generating power. Infinite Galaxy will only keep getting stronger. Han Sen definitely won’t be able to return it, and trying to would only lead to his body being destroyed,” said another person.

Infinite Buddha’s face was dark with rage. His countenance was scary to see. The power in his hands continued getting stronger, as if there was no end to its power.

Han Sen did not strike, and the Buddha wasn’t ready to unleash yet. He was going to generate enough of the Infinite Galaxy’s power to secure a one-hit kill on Han Sen.

He didn’t care about the ways that Han Sen could be useful to them. Killing Han Sen to maintain his pride was far more crucial to him than letting Han Sen lead them somewhere. If he missed this opportunity, he wouldn’t have another.

Infinite Galaxy was getting stronger. Han Sen looked grim. He held his Blood Feather Knife and stared at the light in his opponent’s hands. But still, he did not move.

“He is still not moving. He really wants to face the wrath of Infinite Buddha’s Infinite Galaxy,” the Dragon lady said with surprise.

“I am afraid he thinks he is able to,” Sharon laughed.

Infinite Buddha’s hands were too bright for him to close now. He was on the brink of losing control.

Infinite Buddha shouted and pushed his hands towards Han Sen. The light became a destructive wave that hurtled towards Han Sen.

Han Sen stared at the light, which looked like a compressed galaxy. It contained an unbelievable amount of power. Not even a top Marquise could face-off against it.

Han Sen waved his Blood Feather Knife and created another circle. It was Empty White Teeth.

You cannot return the power possessed by Infinite Galaxy!” Infinite Buddha roared. It looked like Han Sen’s behavior thus far had humiliated him.

As Infinite Buddha roared, the light approached the knife circle. It looked like a solar system bearing down on an ant. It looked ready to explode. The knife circle was quivering, looking likely to break.

“Let me give you some advice. Never use something you cannot control,” Han Sen said quietly. Then, the power in his body was unleashed. The power inside the knife circle was thrown back towards Infinite Buddha.

“…Impossible…” Infinite Buddha was shocked. Facing that power, he did not attempt to block it. Instead, he tried to run away.

*Boom!*

The power slammed into a boulder sitting on the ground. The shockwave was like a planet exploding. It destroyed everything within a few hundred-meter radius.

Infinite Buddha was unable to evade that explosion, and half of his body was hurt badly. He was brought down to the ground, bleeding profusely.

“Mister Sharon! Are you not going to attack?” Infinite Buddha wanted to stop his wounds from bleeding, but the purple knife air was spreading. It was ravaging his wounds.

Sharon looked at Infinite Buddha and said, “I would strike, but in a capacity that has nothing to do with your own petty grievance against Han Sen.”

“As long as you strike, the reason does not matter!” Infinite Buddha screamed, looking frightened.

“It is a shame you are so badly hurt. And with the addition of Teeth powers, I am afraid I cannot save your life,” Sharon said, looking calmly upon him.

“That is fine. Just kill Han Sen!” Infinite Buddha said, while coughing up blood.

His body could no longer keep the Teeth power down. In a few seconds, he was torn to shreds as if in the maw of a beast. Blood poured out of him as he died.

“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Star King Kong: xenogeneic gene found.”

An announcement played in Han Sen’s head, but he knew he couldn’t just go and take Infinite Buddha’s xenogeneic genes.

A creature that looked like a white tiger moved over and swiftly swallowed the corpse. The xenogeneic genes went with it. And then, the creature stared at Han Sen.

Sharon looked at Han Sen with curiosity. “I did not believe that you dueled and came to a draw with Lone Bamboo, but now I most certainly do.”

“He tied with Lone Bamboo?” one of the other xenogeneics asked in shock.

News in Sky Palace was buttoned down, but the Demons were not friendly with Sky Palace. So, they gleaned as much information as they could about things there. Sharon was the only one who knew about Han Sen and Lone Bamboo.

Sharon laughed and said, “During that exam, Lone Bamboo leveled up to being a Marquise. He was disqualified from the Earl exam, so there was no winner.”

“If this man can fight Lone Bamboo in such a way, then he is not someone so simple.” The Dragon lady looked at Han Sen, now showing a greater interest in him.

Sharon looked at Han Sen. “It is a shame you are not a Marquise. Otherwise, I would very much like to fight you. Even if I gave you time to heal, I’d still beat you. I don’t want to have to kill you right now, so you’d best lead the way.”

Han Sen smiled. “I don’t have a good temper. It might be easy for you to kill me, but even so, you won’t get me to lead.”

Sharon frowned. The Dragon lady laughed and said, “Then I shall make a bet with you. If you beat me, we will let you go. And if you lose, then you lead.”

“Who are you?” Han Sen asked, looking at the Dragon lady.
