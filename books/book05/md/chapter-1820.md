Yisha sat on a chair, watching Han Sen gather up power to evolve a second time. She looked at him emotionlessly, as if she was made of ice.

But her eyes twitched sometimes, showing that she was not all that calm.

Her heart was bleeding. After their discussion, Han Sen had used another three Magnet Fruit elixirs, two Thunder geno fluids, two Reborn geno fluids, one Fire and Ice geno fluid, and one Beast Blood geno fluid. They were all the treasures that could force someone to evolve a second time. Normally, one would be enough to accomplish this.

But Han Sen had almost emptied her entire treasury by this point, and he hadn’t evolved a second time.

To Knife Queen, that might have been nothing. But they belonged to the One, and she couldn’t just take whatever she pleased whenever she wanted.

These were her private items. She was rich, but these items were priceless. They couldn’t be bought with money, and Han Sen had yet to evolve a second time. It made Yisha start to feel quite ill.

“I am sorry, but it looks like I have failed again.” Han Sen stood up. With this latest failure, he had failed eleven times. “Continue,” Yisha said emotionlessly. Her eyes twitched another couple of times, though.

She only had one Boiling geno fluid left to give, and a Cell geno fluid. If those two didn’t work, her current investments would have all been for nothing. She wouldn’t know how to deal with him after she went gone through these.

She couldn’t just let Han Sen go after investing so much in him with no return. If this were to continue, she’d have to pay a big price to gain an item that would instigate the evolution she wanted to see. And that was something that she really, really didn’t want to do.

Han Sen grabbed another geno fluid and drank it. Then, he cast The Story of Genes.

The Spell armor was brimming with energy, and it thumped with boundless strength.

And then, all of a sudden, a strange power lit up the armor. It made Yisha’s heart jump. All the other symbols and etchings began to light up, too. Not long after, the geno armor was covered in those symbols and scrawls, making it look like a rippling flame.

Yisha was so happy to see this, and she said, “It’s going to succeed this time!”

Twelve vials of geno fluid was an investment of goliath proportions. She felt grand relief seeing this. If the final two fluids did not help, she wasn’t sure if she would have been willing to dip her hands into the ones owned by the entire tribe.

Amidst the flame-like symbols, the geno armor started to melt. It melted into a liquid that then took on another form.

Seeing Han Sen become a Noble and not a xenogeneic was a great thing, too. If he became a xenogeneic, things might have been even harder.

Yisha looked at the geno armor’s shape, trying to figure out what sort of geno armament he was set to receive. A geno art that required so much was sure to yield a fascinating result.

The geno fluid kept swirling and changing, and eventually, it started to become transparent But Yisha’s face started to turn, too. It looked perplexed.

Most armors would evolve to create something that was obviously a weapon. You might even find items or enhancements to the armor itself.

But the geno armament that Han Sen created looked very strange. It was not finished, but you could start to make out its shape.

It was a crystallizer kid, complete with limbs and a face.

“Is that a doll geno armament?” Yisha was thinking to herself.

But when the armament had almost finished, Yisha started to look shocked.

In the air, after the geno armor melted, the geno armament appeared. It looked so weird.

It looked like a twelve-year-old girl. Her long black hair reached down to her feet, and her eyes were black, also.

Her skin was white and smooth, like that of a real human. Some parts of her were wrapped up in white armor, and in her hands, she was holding two revolvers. There were names etched into the grips of both guns. Yisha thought it was the language of the crystallizers, so she wasn’t able to read the words.

The girl moved her eyes and crouched down against the floor. She lifted her guns and pointed them at Yisha, as if she was guarding Han Sen from a hostile.

Yisha’s eyes opened wide as she stared at the girl. She had seen many geno armaments, but nothing like this. This one looked alive. She had a proper lifeforce. She also looked like she had intelligence, too.

For a geno armament to have life like that, and to have armor and guns, her knowledge on what was possible when it came to evolving was wholly flipped on its head.

When the geno armament finished generating, Han Sen looked at the girl and said, “Why is my armament a woman? Is that really my geno armament?”

The grips convinced Han Sen that this really was his geno armament, though. On the grip of the two pearl-white revolvers, the letters Spe were carved into one, and the letters II were carved on the other. Together, they formed Spell. And that was the name of his geno armor.

When Han Sen used his mind, the woman came towards him. When they bumped into each other, she became a white armorset that covered his entire body. The word Spell was written all across it.

An incredible power filled Han Sen’s body now. It gave him much more power than the geno armor ever did.

“This is my geno armament!” Han Sen was shocked. He went to check on its information, and the geno body said he had become a Duke behind the word Spell.

“My Queen, I think I succeeded!” Han Sen said, looking at Yisha.

“Very good… now keep practicing.” Yisha was still in shock, and she was roused from a slumber of deep thoughts by Han Sen’s sudden shout.

Yisha had never heard of a geno armament like this.

“Maybe this guy really can achieve something special. A geno armament like this is strange,” Yisha thought to herself.
