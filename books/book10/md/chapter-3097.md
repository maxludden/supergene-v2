Feng Yin Yin patted Han Sen’s hand and spoke said, “You being here is enough of a gift for me.” She did not want Han Sen to feel bad.

Han Sen looked at Feng Yin Yin apologetically. “Sorry. I did not know it was your birthday today.”

When everyone heard Han Sen say that, they thought the situation was even more hilarious. The woman laughed and asked, “Who doesn’t know Feng Fei Fei celebrates her birthday alongside Feng Yin Yin?” Han Sen ignored her. He pulled out a gene egg and presented it to Feng Yin Yin. “It means I did not have the time to get a gift box. So, I will give it to you like this.”

“I like it!” Feng Yin Yin did not know it was a mutant eight sound bug egg. She just didn’t want Han Sen to feel bad, so she smiled at Han Sen and accepted it.

“That… Mutant eight sound bug…” Feng Fei Fei, who was next to them, was shocked.

She had seen it many times online. She wanted to buy it for Feng Yin Yin. She knew about the mutant eight sound bug. When she saw Feng Yin Yin holding it, she immediately recognized what it was.

“Really? That is a mutant eight sound bug egg?” Everyone looked at Feng Yin Yin’s gene egg with a look of disbelief. They had not thought something like this would happen. After talking about the mutant eight sound bug egg, Han Sen had handed one out immediately after.

“Fei Fei, have you made a mistake in identifying it?” Si Tu Ya did not know what a mutant eight sound bug egg looked like. She looked at Feng Fei Fei with suspicion.

Feng Fei Fei looked at Feng Yin Yin’s gene egg. Suddenly, she seemed to notice something and asked Han Sen, “Mister Han, did you say your online shop is called Shop?”

“Yes,” Han Sen said with a nod.

After receiving the confirmation, Feng Fei Fei started to look weird. “Are you the owner of Shop? Does that mean it was your shop selling the mutant eight sound bug egg?”

“Yes,” Han Sen said with a nod again. The singer, who was next to the table, said with shock, “I remember now! It was Shop. No wonder it sounded so familiar. I saw it online too. It was a mutant eight sound bug egg. It was being sold for 999,999,999 and not a cent less. I had a friend that I offered 3 million to, but I was declined. The owner is you Mister Han?”

After hearing her say that, everyone knew that this was the mutant eight sound bug egg. Everyone started looking at Han Sen a bit weirdly.

Si Tu Ya was a bit jealous now. She did not want to believe this was possible. She smiled at Feng Yin Yin and said, “Such a rare gene race. Why doesn’t Feng Yin Yin hatch it now to let us all see it?”

Feng Yin Yin looked at Han Sen. He nodded.

Feng Yin Yin agreed to do it. She activated her God Spirit Blood-Pulse and hatched the mutant eight sound bug egg. A beautiful, silver eight sound bug appeared in Feng Yin Yin’s hand. It was like a butterfly flying. Si Tu Ya was even more jealous. “I tried my hardest to achieve all that I have today. I have suffered so much to get to where I am, but she receives these things so easily. Why?” Si Tu Ya was incredibly jealous, but her smile managed to fake it.

With the mutant eight sound bug egg for a gift, all the other amazing gifts she received from others paled in comparison.

Feng Fei Fei was really suspicious about what Han Sen did. It was such a profound treasure, so she couldn’t quite believe he had given it to Feng Yin Yin. She did not know what he was trying to achieve.

It was not like Han Sen was trying to befriend her by doing that. When Feng Fei Fei wanted to buy the mutant eight sound bug off Han Sen, he had not agreed. Furthermore, he had offended Gong Shu Jin by declining. Now, he had merrily given Feng Yin Yin the egg. He obviously wasn’t doing it for Feng Fei Fei. “How did Yin Yin even become his friend?” Feng Fei Fei wanted to ask that, but she did not want to ask it at the party.

Now, many people were interested in Han Sen’s shop. They asked what sort of rare gene eggs he sold.

In the universe of kingdoms, humans relied on gene races too much. Everyone wanted a friend who could gather rare gene eggs. Han Sen’s answers disappointed them. He said he only owned a small shop that sold low-class gene eggs. The mutant eight sound bug egg was the best he had in the shop. There were no other gene eggs up for purchase. The nobles did not believe him. If he was able to hand out a mutant eight sound bug egg for free, there was no chance his shop had nothing else of prestige. Everyone made sure to remember the name of the shop. They were going to check it out sometime.

“Auntie, why would you…” At the party, Feng Yin Yin suddenly pointed at Feng Fei Fei and screamed.

Everyone looked at Feng Fei Fei. After they saw her, they were shocked. Blood was coming out from her eyes.

The bloody tears rolled down her cheeks. Feng Fei Fei’s pretty face looked weird and scary. “What happened to me?” Feng Fei Fei looked confused. She did not feel anything. She took a mirror out of her purse and looked. When she saw the blood, she was given a fright.

Without hesitation, Feng Fei Fei summoned the holy sound phoenix and combined with it. The holy sound surrounded her. She had phoenix wings and glowed with a god light.

Feng Fei Fei knew she must have had a gene race power afflicting her, but she did not know what sort of gene race might be endangering her life. She used the holy sound phoenix power to protect herself. She hoped that might stop her from getting any worse. Feng Fei quickly realized that it was futile. Her adult god-class holy sound phoenix could not achieve anything Now, she did not just have bloody tears. Her mouth, nose, and ears were bleeding. She was like a ghost. Although the holy sound phoenix air was nearby and she was pretty, she looked very scary. “Feng Fei Fei, do not worry. Allow me to help!” A handsome young man at the main table looked overbearing. He combined with a giant spirit. He was soon glowing with holy light. He fired holy light at Feng Fei Fei to stop the weird power from damaging her further.

His efforts did nothing either. Feng Fei Fei’s eyes were blood red, and her god mark displayed a problem. She screamed at the sky. With the holy sound phoenix still with her, frightening acoustic shockwaves were generated. The entire lobby was destroyed.

Many nobles reacted quickly. They combined with a gene race to block the shockwave, but many people were still shocked by the scream and bled.

Han Sen pulled Feng Yin Yin behind him. He used blood fire to stop the scary sound.

The very beautiful lobby had suddenly become something more akin to a landfill.
