<p>That sword did not appear to be very special. It was made of bronze and looked rather antique. It had no frills or special adornments. It was just a sword that had some interesting and old text scrawled across it.</p>

<p>“One-inch thinking, then one-inch grey.” Han Sen slowly read the words on the sword out. They were only a few words, but it enabled the people there to feel what it was like to miss someone profusely. Jian Bu Gu said, “Yes. This is the sword. When I first encountered it, I thought it was just an obsessed-type of a sword.”</p>

<p>After saying that, he saw Qin Bai stepping toward it. He swiftly stepped forward to prohibit Qin Bai’s way. He casually said, “This sword is different from the other swords of Soldier Knife Sky. This empty area is his. You cannot access it.”</p>

<p>“Mister, what would happen if we did?” Jia Shi Zhen politely asked.</p>

<p>Jian Bu Gu’s face usually looked calm. Now, he looked rather confused. He said, “In fact, there aren’t many big issues that can arise. Unless you absolutely have to, though, I suggest you do not enter.”</p>

<p>“Would our lives be put in danger?” Qin Bai asked.</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, there should not be a danger posed to your lives,” Jian Bu Gu said. “The sword will not harm anyone randomly. If you really want it, you can try to draw it. Perhaps you will be able to keep it.”</p>

<p>“That is good. I want to see what sort of sword it is.” Qin Bai’s power had not reached that level yet, so he couldn’t see. He felt terrible about it all. He heard Jian Bu Gu say there wasn’t any danger, so he climbed toward the empty area.</p>

<p>Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen knew what Jian Bu Gu had said meant something else, but Qin Bai was already on his way there. Therefore, they might as well have followed.</p>

<p>Han Sen and Bao’er followed too. Only Jian Bu Gu did not move. He still stood where he was in the forest of weapons. He watched them go forward and said to himself, “Although there is no danger to one’s life, that sword is a real pain. It would be best not to provoke it.”</p>

<p>The few of them had only just been in the empty spot for a few steps when they suddenly heard a sword sound that was rather like an instrument. The acoustics were quite dreamy and unreal.</p>

<p>When Thousand Mile Reach heard the sword sounds, he said to Qin Bai, “Crown Prince, in the past, I always taught you how to find out the sounds of swords. Do you recognize what kind of sword this is?”</p>

<p>“It should be metal,” Qin Bai said, but he wasn’t entirely sure.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” Thousand Mile Reach said. “That is a metal sword. To be a bit more specific, it is likely a bronze sword. Hearing the sword sound, you can tell the sword is around four feet long and has a thick body of around 1.5 inches. You can also tell the blade is at 30 degrees.”</p>

<p>Han Sen admired that. Thousand Mile Reach really was the greatest teacher in the Qin Kingdom. He was very good at listening to swords. Although Han Sen could do it too, he required the Dongxuan Sutra. This was Soldier Knife Sky. Without the restrictions of the universe’s rules, Han Sen could cast the Dongxuan Sutra with ease. He did not have to bother listening with his ears. Qin Bai could not wait to find out if Thousand Mile Reach was right. He hurried up and ran to where the sword’s sound came from.</p>

<p>For a god-class gene race combined human, 30 feet was nothing. In haste, Qin Bai was able to see the old bronze sword emblazoned with the words, “One-inch thinking, then one-inch</p>

<p>grey.”</p>

<p>“Thousand Mile Reach is so powerful,” Qin Bai said with shock. “It is just as you said.”</p>

<p>“It is just due to experience. Mister Crown Prince only needs to see and hear more to become like me.” Thousand Mile Reach used this opportunity to help Qin Bai learn more.</p>

<p>“Why is Mister Jian not coming?” Jia Shi Zhen was surprised to notice Jian Bu Gu was not going with them.</p>

<p>“Maybe he does not want to be involved in some kind of trouble.” Han Sen knew Jian Bu Gu had not gone with them, and he was able to guess why.</p>

<p>Qin Bai had not noticed. He looked at the old, bronze sword and said, “Thousand Mile Reach, with the sword skills you taught me, this sword seems fairly average. It only looks like an old, bronze sword that might be used for decoration. It looks old and powerful, but it does not look like it can be of much use. Is this really some kind of ultimate sword?” Thousand Mile Reach replied, “Looking at sword skills is a very deep thing. You cannot judge it by its appearance. When you reach a certain level, if you can see a sword is a god, this sword looks fairly normal but exudes a scary god light.”</p>

<p>Qin Bai kept nodding. He looked hopeful and asked, “According to what you can see, would the sword will of this weapon match mine?”</p>

<p>“Mister Crown Prince is a future king. Your mind is special. Ordinary weapons will not suit you.” Thousand Mile Reach felt terrible to admit it, so he tried to cushion the disappointment as much as he could. Qin Bai’s will was too weak. Not many weapons were able to match with him. It was even hard for Han Sen to pick one. It would be hard to find another one that was as powerful. The chance of it approving Qin Bai was abysmally low.</p>

<p>Although Thousand Mile Reach said it in a roundabout way, Qin Bai was not stupid. He was able to understand him and fairly disappointed as a result. “Thousand Mile Reach, will you match with this sword?” Qin Bai asked.</p>

<p>“Regarding that, I would have to give it a go. A god sword like this was not something Mister Jian was able to take, so I do not think I can.” Thousand Mile Reach said that, but he still had a budding hope. What if he did match with the sword?</p>

<p>This was a sword Jian Bu Gu was unable to take. If he was able to tame it, that would be quite glorious.</p>

<p>“In that case, why don’t you give it a go?” Qin Bai could not take the sword, but he still wanted to see how amazing that sword was.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we let Mister Han try it first?’” Thousand Mile Reach politely offered.</p>

<p>When Han Sen heard him say that, he knew the teacher still wanted it. He smiled. “Why don’t you go first, Thousand Mile Reach? I don’t use swords often anyway.”</p>

<p>Thousand Mile Reach offered it to Jia Shi Zhen, but she was indifferent. So, Thousand Mile Reach approached the sword.</p>

<p>Although picking up a sword alone was risky, Jian Bu Gu said it would be a threat to one’s life. Jian Bu Gu was not a liar, so Thousand Mile Reach was not so worried.</p>

<p>“If I really can get the sword’s approval…” Thousand Mile Reach blushed. He was very excited.</p>

<p>Although he was excited, he was old and smart. Thousand Mile Reach would not dare be careless. He summoned four gene races and combined with them. He then touched the handle of the sword.</p>

<p>Thousand Mile Reach’s body glowed with a golden light. It was like the light of the sun and the moon. When his hands touched down on the sword, he wanted to pull it up.</p>

<p>Han Sen and the others opened their eyes wide as they watched him. They were eager to see what was going to happen. Strangely, nothing did.</p>

<p>It was not that nothing happened. Thousand Mile Reach let go of the handle, and the gene race was removed. He returned to his original self. He slowly turned around to look at them.</p>
