  “Stay away! This is the battleground of men. This is nothing for you to be involved in,” Han Sen said over his shoulder, keeping his eyes on the red demon.

After Han Sen combined his four geno arts, the Dongxuan Area’s power increased exponentially. Han Sen discovered that this God’s Knife wasn’t really a knife. It was a xenogeneic. Although it was a living creature, its body and soul were like knives.

Han Sen didn’t know the level of this xenogeneic, but its power was already beyond what Han Sen could accurately gauge.

The blood demon’s shadow stared at Han Sen coldly. The sharp knife in its hands glowed with a bloody light. The space around the knife was twisted by that bloody light, hiding the body of the knife. The only thing still visible through the twisted space was the knife light held by the glowing shadow of a hand.

The next second, the shadow moved. It traveled like a red mist beneath the sun. It was coming for Han Sen.

The power in Han Sen’s body exploded. He teleported behind the shadow and sent a punch toward the blood demon.

But the blood demon looked as if it didn’t know that Han Sen had already teleported away. Its knife was still headed for Han Sen’s previous location.

Han Sen was surprised that his opponent had been thrown off course by such a simple trick, but he continued with his strike. For him, this was a good opportunity. He couldn’t just stop mid-attack because of his suspicion.

Katcha!

But before Han Sen’s fist hit the blood demon, his chest was cut open. A few of his ribs were sliced clean through, and some of his organs and crystallized blood were showing.

“What is going on…? Why did I get hit?” Han Sen’s face contorted in sudden pain. He didn’t understand how the creature had managed to hit him.

The blood shadow hadn’t turned around or even swung its knife toward Han Sen, but he had still been injured. This was so weird.

There was no time to think. He summoned his Immortal Dragon, and it immediately released an immortal substance chain toward Han Sen’s chest that healed Han Sen’s wounds quickly.

The blood demon moved forward and swung its knife at Han Sen in a crazed fury.

Han Sen understood that his xenogeneic power was extremely inferior to that of the blood demon. He wanted to know how he had been hit, as well, so instead of attempting to block the attack, he used teleport again. But this time, he didn’t teleport closer to the blood demon. He teleported away, trying to put some distance between his enemy and himself.

Katcha!

There was a space of 100 miles separating Han Sen and the blood demon, and the knife light wasn’t slashing toward Han Sen. But even so, an invisible blade split Han Sen’s head open. His skull cracked down the center, opening wide enough to show his pink brain. The pain of the attack was excruciating, and Han Sen’s face turned white.

“I see…” Although the attack had been brutal, Han Sen had learned something. He now understood how he had been hit.

The bloody knife light had traveled to where Han Sen had previously been standing. There, a very dim blood shadow had appeared. That blood shadow resembled Han Sen’s face. The bloody knife light slashed that blood shadow, and Han Sen’s body was injured by the blow.

“Is it a time or space power? Or is it a bit of both?” Han Sen’s wounds were healed by the Immortal Dragon’s power. Not even such a grievous injury was going to kill him now.

But the blood demon was clearly a scarier opponent than he had expected. Han Sen had already used Forever Solid on himself. Under the buffs of Forever Solid, even transmutation deifieds couldn’t damage his xenogeneic battle body.

Plus, the pesky dragon scales growing on his skin gave him an immunity power. He was indestructible.

The bloody knife light wasn’t physically striking his body, but it could still cut through his armor, scales, and bones. This was very frightening.

The blood demon didn’t seem to be putting as much thought into the situation as Han Sen was. Its face looked murderous as it came for him without hesitation. Wherever the knife light went, the space nearby was badly distorted. It was like many twisting blood lights were dancing around the knife light.

This time, Han Sen didn’t try to teleport. Instead, he summoned his Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. He was going to block the blood demon’s knife.

The blood demon’s power was strange, and trying to dodge it seemed to be useless. Han Sen had to block it.

But the next second, Han Sen’s chest was spilling blood. His entire body flew away. He hurtled through the air for a few miles, then his body slammed into the field like an asteroid.

Han Sen regained his senses in a giant, circular hole. The armor on his chest had been cut open, revealing the flesh inside. His scales, bones, and ribs were cut in half.

Han Sen’s shield was still fine. Although the shield could stop all sorts of physical attacks, it was apparently unable to inhibit the knife light.

That weird knife light phased through the shield like a ghost and struck Han Sen in the chest, completely unimpeded.

The blood demon’s body flashed, and it kept up an endless stream of attacks. No matter how Han Sen dodged or blocked, he couldn’t manage to stop the blood demon’s knife light. Every slash hit him, and Han Sen’s god body bled as he incurred more and more knife-borne injuries.

If not for the Immortal Dragon madly healing him as he fought, Han Sen would probably have been sliced to pieces a long time ago.

Even so, there was a limit to how fast the Immortal Dragon could heal him. Its healing ability was beginning to lag behind the injuries Han Sen was receiving. Before Han Sen’s wounds healed completely, he was hit a few more times.

“Powerful. Incredibly powerful. It is so powerful that fighting it makes one feel rather hopeless.”

“Just run! You’re going to get killed!” Gu Wan’er shouted from her position near the carriage. Countless shockwaves were being unleashed from Han Sen and the blood demon’s fight, but the carriage wasn’t taking any damage. It looked as if some magical power was protecting the vehicle in some capacity. Whenever a shockwave reached the carriage, it would fade.

Han Sen wanted to run away, too, but he couldn’t. Even teleporting away was futile. He would still end up injured by the demon. And some sort of cruel, restrictive power was locking this planet down. Entering was easy, but leaving would require Han Sen to somehow break through the bai sema. Not even his teleportation skills were enough.

The knife’s power was so weird. No matter what Han Sen did, he would end up being hit.

The only good thing about this situation was that the blood demon’s power couldn’t kill him in a single blow. If it had been any stronger, he would have died before he even had a chance to fight back.

Katcha!

A slash struck Han Sen’s body again. Han Sen couldn’t even see how he had been injured. The blow almost severed his arm at the shoulder.

Suddenly, Han Sen’s body started to glow with blood light. Black scales grew like crazy, forcing their way through his armor. In seconds, the scales had wrapped all the way around Han Sen’s body and through his armor.

Before Han Sen figured out what was going on, he felt the ground shake. A blood light had shot down from space, and now it was gleaming in front of Han Sen. It was the blood coral that looked like a blood dragon.
