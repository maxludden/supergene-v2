<p>Han Sen frowned. He had tried using his Destiny’s Tower to try to claim the other Jade Drum, but it did not work.</p>

<p>“This is bad. If I am unable to make a sound with the Jade Drum, I will have no choice but to leave it here.” Han Sen felt bad about this, but he was short on time.</p>

<p>Queen had less than a day. If she didn’t register her own Drum in time, she wouldn’t be able to take it with her, even if she did have one willing to follow her. Han Sen had a tight deadline for earning the approval of the Jade Drum.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter which Jade Drum accepts me. As long as one of them will make a sound, we can figure the rest out later,” Han Sen thought to himself. He picked up the white Jade Drum Duke. Then, he gave Bao’er to Huangfu Jing. “Take Bao’er away from me. I am going to hit this Drum. If it works, I don’t want to bring you two any harm.”</p>

<p>Huangfu Jing nodded. Then, she took Bao’er towards the exit.</p>

<p>When Huangfu Jing left, Han Sen brought out his Demon Bug Bai Sema. He looked at the white Jade Drum, then straightened his middle finger and his thumb. A gold light appeared.</p>

<p>Han Sen couldn’t rely on using luck to get the Drum to obey, so he would have to rely on brute force. He actually wanted Huangfu Jing to take Bao’er away because he didn’t want to be seen in his Dollar persona.</p>

<p>A coin appeared in his hand. On its surface was the number one. As time passed, the number increased in singular ticks.</p>

<p>Two… Three… Four… Five…</p>

<p>Saving Money was working, and the number went up. With every jump in number, the force that gathered on the coin was multiplied.</p>

<p>The white Jade Drum was a Duke. So, Han Sen brought the coin’s power up to the number ten. When that was done, he fired it at the Jade Drum. The coin was unleashed with the force of a meteor, and it hit the Drum hard.</p>

<p>Dong!</p>

<p>A strong power made a very loud noise atop the white Jade Drum. The sound washed out of the Drum like a tsunami. When it hit the gold Demon Bug Bai Sema, however, it bounced back.</p>

<p>The sonic force inside the Bai Sema kept bouncing and rolling around with the echo. It was getting stronger.</p>

<p>Han Sen was inside all that sonic force, but he was not hurt. He had struck the white Jade Drum brutally and gotten its approval. The way he had gone about it was just a little violent, but the white Jade Drum’s power did not hurt him because it had accepted him.</p>

<p>But after the results of the blow surprised Han Sen. The sonic power inside the Demon Bug Bai Sema was increasing. It reminded Han Sen of White Real’s Echo ability.</p>

<p>He had once joked that if he had a big bell to trap his enemies, he could use Echo to increase sonic powers in the confined space. The Demon Bug Bai Sema might not have been a bell, but it had been proven to be able to trap an enemy. On top of that, Echo seemed to work inside it.</p>

<p>“I have only been thinking about the Demon Bug Bai Sema’s ability to protect me, and so I’ve been overlooking an incredible opportunity. I should really go back to Sky Palace and learn Echo from White Real. Using Echo and the Jade Drum in combination could work very well,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

<p>The white Jade Drum, after that manic and violent display, gave its approval to Han Sen. When Han Sen tried to confirm this and hit it again, it was a much simpler affair. By just hitting it lightly, the Drum now made a sound and emitted sonic powers.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, violence really does work more than reason.” Han Sen chuckled as he put away the white Jade Drum. Then he looked at the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.</p>

<p>“Let’s see if I can take this one with me.” Han Sen brought out a coin and began gathering up power again. When the number ticked its way up to ten, he fired the coin at the Drum.</p>

<p>Dong!</p>

<p>The coin hit the Drum’s surface. A metal noise sounded. He wasn’t able to make it respond with a proper drum sound.</p>

<p>The coin was stuck to the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum, but it wasn’t having any amazing effects. The Drum wasn’t being crushed; not that he wanted that. Han Sen didn’t want the Drum to get damaged, of course.</p>

<p>“Reaching the number ten with Saving Money is all I can do. Even if I can take it further, that won’t be much of an increase. It looks like this thing really is King class. My power isn’t enough to make a sound.” Despite his failure, Han Sen wasn’t disappointed. He only wanted to take the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum away with him so he could have the time to claim it in the future.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought for a moment, then cut his finger. He melted his crystal blood and dropped a little onto the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.</p>

<p>He saw the blood slowly melted into the scorpion symbol, but still, it took a while to absorb.</p>

<p>But it actually was absorbing. Although it hadn’t melted completely into the symbol just yet, there was a weird red spot on the scorpion’s back. It didn’t match with the image.</p>

<p>“If blood is able to melt into it, then I’m sure I will be able to infect it. That would make gaining the Drum’s approval far easier,” Han Sen thought to himself. He took the two Jade Drums with him as he left the cave. He went looking for Bao’er and Huangfu Jing.</p>

<p>Now that Han Sen had the white Jade Drum’s approval, the three of them could each take a drum and leave.</p>

<p>After Han Sen found them, they all headed for the Thousand Treasures base that was located on the planet. He wanted to leave with the Jade Drums as soon as he could.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew that it was exceedingly rare for three people to appear with Jade Drums all at once, and that made him certain that the trip home wouldn’t be a safe one.</p>

<p>Han Sen was not afraid of trouble, of course. If he had been, he wouldn’t have come in the first place. But this wasn’t just any trouble. This had the potential to be Big Trouble. Three Jade Drums might entice many sonic-practicing elites into coming after them. Any enemies that started hunting them would have to be dealt with.</p>

<p>In the Planet Jade Drum’s base, a half-humanoid and half-snake Ghana King was in the middle of registering his claim on a Gold Drum.</p>

<p>All the elites standing around were looking jealous of the Ghana King, who was registering the highly-coveted Gold Drum. The Ghana King wasn’t happy with his prize, however. In fact, he looked rather glum.</p>

<p>His target had been a Jade Drum, but after ten days of searching, he had only managed to find a Gold Drum. That wasn’t what he wanted, and it made him ill.</p>

<p>A beautiful man with butterfly wings walked in front of the Ghana and laughed. “Stephen, I see that you found a Gold Drum.”</p>

<p>“Sonic Butterfly King, didn’t you just get a Gold Drum, as well?” Stephen looked at his Gold Drum and smiled.</p>

<p>Sonic Butterfly King sighed and said, “This planet still has Jade Drums, but too many people are digging for them. They are being taken faster than they are being birthed. They aren’t easy to find anymore.”</p>
