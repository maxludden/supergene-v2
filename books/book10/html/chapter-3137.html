<p>“Mister Wei, please explain to me the details you have about Bee
Planet,” Sky King said to Mister Wei.</p>
<p>Mister Wei remained silent. He did not speak. Sky King
understood what Mister Wei was worried about. He said, “Mister,
please explain it to me. The people in this carriage are all my
friends. There are no outsiders in here.”</p>
<p>After hearing Sky King say that, Mister Wei was surprised. One
would have expected Sky King and Han Sen to be rivals due to their
associations with different factions.</p>
<p>Now, all the nobles were supposed to hate Han Sen. Sky King was
the biggest noble in the Qin Kingdom, and he was saying that Han
Sen was not an outsider. Mister Wei thought it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Mister Wei did not know why Sky King had to be like this. Others
did not know about the power the fish in Bao’er’s hand possessed.
Sky King knew it very well.</p>
<p>Regarding the personalities of the father and daughter, he knew
about them all too well.</p>
<p>To prevent Han Sen from coming to mess things up while digging
land pulses, they might as well have given him a cut to stop him
from starting anything. Of course, Sky King was hoping to use Han
Sen and the little fish’s power. With the help the flying fish
could provide, even they were all in danger, there was something
crucial that could always turn the tides in their favor.</p>
<p>Mister Wei remained silent for a moment and then finally said,
“This planet is one of the seven planets of Ghost Starlight. This
planet is now filled with scary toxic bee gene races. There is only
one possibility for why that happened. When the god pulse was
formed, this planet already had a powerful bee gene race that was
at least god class.”</p>
<p>“Mister Wei, the planet’s beehive is so scary. Did the bee king
swallow the god pulse on this planet?” Sky King was scared of
everything.</p>
<p>Mister Wei shook his head. “My King, you think too much.
Although the beehive on this planet is huge, there is only one
toxic bee. The entire bee legion you see was summoned by him. The
power of that toxic bee is probably summoning those bees.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Mister Wei said, “I have been watching them for a
while. Although the toxic bee legion is scary, there isn’t the
presence of a God Spirit. I cannot tell what the toxic bee’s level
is, but it did not consume the God Spirit Blood-Pulse. From what I
have been able to determine, this planet does not have a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse.”</p>
<p>“That is very good,” Sky King said with a nod. “If things are
this way, then there is no use in delaying things further. Let’s go
to the planet and slay the toxic bee gene race. I do not want it to
ruin the gene eggs in the land pulse.”</p>
<p>“I totally agree with that.” Mister Wei agreed with Sky King’s
decision.</p>
<p>Sky King did not make any orders yet. He looked at Han Sen and
said, “Brother Han, as for the benefits we claim from the planet,
you and Mister Wei can have 30% each. Since we will use my power
and resources, I will get 40%.”</p>
<p>“Sure. We’ll do as you tell us,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Mister Wei and Bald Guy felt weird. Mister Wei was in charge of
seeking out land pulses. He provided a lot of support, but he was
only going to get 30%. Han Sen did not use power or resources, and
he was still going to get 30%. That was hard for them to
believe.</p>
<p>They did not know that Sky King only wanted Han Sen and Bao’er,
the father and daughter duo, to not mess things up for them. He did
not actually expect them to do anything.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu thought, “Why does Sky King treat Han Sen like this?
How did the two even meet? If they used to know each other, Han
Sen’s identity wouldn’t be so simple.”</p>
<p>“That must be right. Han Sen must be the hidden heir of some
family in the Qin Kingdom. Otherwise, why would Sky King give his
self-identifying Sky Order to Han Sen’s daughter? It wouldn’t make
any real sense otherwise. Why else would he treat Han Sen so nice?”
Li Bing Yu thought that had to be right.</p>
<p>The big dragon space riders headed down into the planet. The
toxic bee crowds were scary but having big dragon riders ahead of
them made them not as scary. The big dragons spewed fire to burn
down the cloud-like assembly of toxic bees. With haste, they sped
into the planet, but there were too many toxic bees. It was hard to
clear them. The big dragon space riders could only clear the toxic
bee legions around them.</p>
<p>Just as Mister Wei said, the crowds of toxic bees were not real.
Once they were killed, the bodies disappeared. The vast amounts
killed did not litter the planet. They were not genuine gene
races.</p>
<p>Sky King looked at Mister Wei and asked, “Mister, is there a way
to find out where the real toxic bee is hiding?”</p>
<p>“It is not hard,” Mister Wei said with a nod. He summoned a gene
race. The gene race looked like a turtle, but its head was shaped
like a snake. Many mysterious symbols were present on the turtle’s
back. There was a needle inside the creature too. It looked very
weird.</p>
<p>Mister Wei bit into his finger and dropped a spot of blood onto
the needle in the turtle’s back. Once it came into contact with
Mister Wei’s blood, the needle started to spin.</p>
<p>When the needle stopped in a direction, Mister Wei quickly said,
“The toxic bee’s real body is that way.”</p>
<p>Sky King immediately commanded his riders to go that way, but
the needle on the turtle’s back kept changing its orientation. They
were quickly able to find out where the toxic bee was actually
hiding.</p>
<p>When the toxic bee changed direction, the needle on the turtle’s
changed direction to follow it.</p>
<p>After finding out where the toxic bee was, Sky King did not need
to do anything. His elites were already able to slay the king-class
toxic bee.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this was rather interesting. No matter if it was
a scary summon power toxic bee or Mister Wei’s compass turtle, they
all had magical powers.</p>
<p>That was especially true of Mister Wei’s compass turtle. It was
just a duke-class mutant gene race, but without it, it would have
been difficult to find the god-class toxic bee.</p>
<p>“The gene race powers really do change a lot. The level of
something is not the problem. It all depends on the caster. If a
gene race is used well, that is how victory can be determined.” Han
Sen noticed a gene race’s utility was not defined by its level.</p>
<p>Of course, higher-level gene races did provide greater benefits.
Compared to a gene race with a similar element, one at a higher
level was still better.</p>
<p>The toxic bee king was killed. The entire planet’s toxic bee
legion vanished. The big dragon’s space riders controlled the
entire planet.</p>
<p>Mister Wei and his students searched the land pulse. They found
the land pulse and had the big dragon riders do the digging. Han
Sen and the others did not even have to lift a finger. He was just
there, chilling with Sky King and idly chatting</p>
<p>“What makes Han Sen and the others worthy of having a 30% cut?
They did not do anything.” Brother Three knew about that, and it
made him angry. The big brother quietly said, “Brother Three, stop
talking crap. If Sky King gave him 30%, that means Han Sen was
worth it. You should stop trying to provoke him.”</p>
<p>Brother Three was not happy, but he knew he was right. His face
turned green, but he no longer dared to say anything.</p>
<p>Including Mister Wei, everyone was busy. Only Sky King, Han Sen,
and a few others were free. They gathered before a table, watching
and talking. “Brother Han, are you and Bao’er interested in the god
fights?”.</p>
<p>“It depends. I will join if I have the time,” Han Sen casually
said. He sounded really chill about it, but he did not actually
know what the god fights were. Thus, he did not answer clearly.</p>
