<p>“Say, brother<sub>friend</sub>! Are you from a higher race?” Lao
Zhuoma was going to call Han Sen “brother,” but it wasn’t
appropriate. So, he called him “friend.”</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma thought Han Sen was from a higher race, because
normal Barons should never reach that sort of level. It didn’t
matter how much they practiced, they just couldn’t.</p>
<p>“On the form, didn’t I tell you I was human?” Han Sen acted like
he didn’t understand what he was being asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, you did.” Lao Zhuoma felt disheartened, as he had never
heard of a human before. And he knew there was no higher race
called that.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma still felt depressed, and without saying much, he
told Han Sen, “Dollar, you will have to wait a few days on this
airship. But going to Seven Mirrors won’t take long, once we
depart.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. I greatly enjoy traveling,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma gave Han Sen a room to live in, but without anything
to do, Han Sen found himself going up on deck. Many refugees wished
to board the airship and go to Seven Mirrors. Going to an
underdeveloped planet was better than remaining in a warzone, or so
they felt.</p>
<p>But Seven Mirrors wasn’t willing to take just anybody. The
Nobles were always favored, which made it difficult for commoners
to be accepted.</p>
<p>Seven Mirrors was not a charity, and they were only going to
take those who could prove themselves useful. The old, sick, or
injured weren’t allowed on board.</p>
<p>“What race do you belong to? You don’t look like you’re from
Planet Kate,” a Baron Kate asked. He had come forward to check Han
Sen out</p>
<p>“Human,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“I have never heard of them, so I can only assume they are even
smaller than the Kate.” The Baron wasn’t insulting Han Sen; he was
mocking himself, more than anything.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at him and asked, “What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“I am Mike.” The Baron introduced himself, and then said, “So,
we’ve been recruited by Seven Mirrors and we’re headed to an
underdeveloped planet for work? If you want, why don’t we go to the
same place and partner up?”</p>
<p>“I still haven’t decided if I want to go yet.” Han Sen did not
reply.</p>
<p>Mike shook his head. “When the fighting starts, it’s not only
the common folk that will be in grave danger. The Barons will be,
too. Land reclamation is hard, but it is still better than war. So,
why the hesitation?”</p>
<p>“We’ll see.” Han Sen didn’t much care for what he was being
told.</p>
<p>Han Sen had spoken to Qiao, and he was able to confirm that war
had not yet reached Gran City. Qiao and Lan Se were thinking of
ways they could escape and where they could go, but they had so far
been unable to reach a decision.</p>
<p>Han Sen told them about Seven Mirrors recruiting, and they told
him they might consider it. They’d talk about it in greater depth
once they were all together again.</p>
<p>The Third Master had evacuated from Planet Kate with Mister
Tiger, and they extended an invite for Han Sen to join them at
another headquarters of the Black Gold Group. It was an offer Han
Sen quickly rejected, though.</p>
<p>Mike wished to say something more to Han Sen, but something
occurred down below.</p>
<p>They both looked down and saw a legion of centaurs in front of
the airship. They surrounded the people who were waiting for a
chance to conduct the test in the hopes of boarding the
airship.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma quickly went down to meet the centaurs, though. He
smiled and said, “Taurus, please do not misunderstand. We are from
Seven Mirrors, and we are friends, not enemies.”</p>
<p>After that, Lao Zhuoma pointed at the Seven Mirrors emblem on
the ship.</p>
<p>The leading centaur recognized it; in fact, it was the reason
that the centaurs had taken action.</p>
<p>The centaur, seeing the Seven Mirrors symbol, looked at Lao
Zhuoma and coldly said, “We don’t care about Seven Mirrors. Kill
all these Kate.”</p>
<p>The centaur warriors lifted their spears to kill the Kate that
had been lining up. Lao Zhuoma looked horrified at the wrath of the
centaurs. He had joined Seven Mirrors, yes, but he was Kate. It
hurt to see his own people get slaughtered.</p>
<p>“Can you show mercy? Seven Mirrors will be accepting these Kate.
We were going to take them to help develop an empty planet.
Please?” Lao Zhuoma gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>Although many people would fail the test, Lao Zhuoma was a Kate
himself. He couldn’t just watch them die.</p>
<p>Mike looked just as angry, too. He said. “The low lives of
Taurus happily licked the boots of the Feathers when they were in
control, but now that they have fallen, these scumbags have aligned
themselves with the enemies of the Feathers. This is f*cking
horrible!”</p>
<p>“Which race did they sign up with?” Han Sen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I think they are called Demons. They looked similar to the
Kate, but they have horns on their heads,” Mike said.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but the leader of the centaurs
shouted, “What a load of crap! Only the people currently onboard
the ship count as Seven Mirrors. Just kill the rest of them.”</p>
<p>After that, he commanded his warriors to attack the people.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Lao Zhuoma shouted.</p>
<p>The leader centaur coldly laughed and said, “What? Would you
like to fight us, as a representative of Seven Mirrors?”</p>
<p>“No. We are merely recruiting. Please be nice and let us take
these people. Seven Mirrors has bought their services,” Lao Zhuoma
said politely.</p>
<p>Seven Mirrors was not weak, but they weren’t the sorts to engage
in conflict. This time, when they came to Planet Kate, the
supervisor had informed them not to come into contact with any
Demons.</p>
<p>“Okay. Let’s make this simple; from now on, if they are on the
airship they are yours. If they cannot get on board, then I am
sorry.” After the centaur leader said that, he gestured with his
hands for his soldiers to rush forward.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma didn’t fight He just shouted at the people, saying,
“Get on the ship! Hurry!”</p>
<p>“Animal!” Mike shouted down from atop the ship.</p>
<p>“Why are they killing them? Don’t they need people to develop
Planet Kate, too?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Mike coldly said, “Taurus is a race that takes pleasure in
killing. They have a grudge with the Kate, due to the Kate beating
them once before. Now they’ve got a clear chance, they aren’t so
willing to let us leave.”</p>
<p>There was some crying heard from the crowds, as people tried to
rush forward and get aboard the barge. The entryway was narrow,
though, and if many more people boarded, it would overload the
airship.</p>
<p>The centaur warriors thundered into the crowds, butchering
merrily. The Kate were all just commoners, and so they had no
chance of killing the centaur warriors. They were not trained for
anything of the sort.</p>
<p>In moments, a dozen of the Kate had been killed.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma called for everyone to hurry, but there was not
enough room for everyone to get on.</p>
