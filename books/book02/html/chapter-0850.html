    <p>
      Yi Dongmu wasn&#8217;t the only one dexterous in the arts of
      assassination; Han Sen was, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the cane approached Han Sen&#8217;s forehead, he made a quick dodge
      to the left. As he moved, he threw his palm towards the spirit&#8217;s
      chest like the sudden lunge of a snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King coldly snickered, seemingly prepared for this. His
      dagger-like fingers snatched Han Sen&#8217;s wrist, and his lethal nails
      pierced through the armor and into the flesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You have already been poisoned by my Devil-Blood powers. How can
      you willfully elect to escape? And worse yet, attempt to assassinate me.
      Fool; do you have a death wish?&#8221; The Devil-Blood King was ready to
      break Han Sen&#8217;s wrist.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not really.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s eyes glimmered with amusement.
      He reversed his hand and a fairy appeared, blowing white mist into the
      Devil-Blood King&#8217;s face.
    </p>

    <p>In a single moment, the spirit became ice.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill him.&#8221; Han Sen summoned over Little Angel and issued the
      command. With her greatsword, she sliced the icicle in half.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King scattered into dust and returned to the spirit stone,
      dead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, Han Sen used his holy light to remedy the Devil-Blood poison.
      Wasting no time, he immediately took off running towards the Spirit Hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scimitar-witch had yet to submit, however. She went after him, but Han
      Sen was aware. His eyes shone blue as he caught her gaze, and she froze in
      place for a moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in that single second Han Sen cast his Sonic-Thunder powers. He
      punched the scimitar-witch&#8217;s lightshield, and so great was the power
      of the strike, it pierced directly through without reprieve. The silver
      sun of his fist smashed into her body, unyielding.
    </p>

    <p>Aaah!</p>

    <p>
      The scimitar-witch&#8217;s body was enveloped by lightning. Her body
      convulsed as she tried to retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Little Angel found her window of opportunity, and after flapping her wings
      to draw closer, swung her greatsword. She cut open the lightshield and
      severed the witch&#8217;s head from her body, allowing blood to gush from
      the exposed throat.
    </p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his Spirit Owl and let it gorge on the witch&#8217;s
      flesh, and then, he took off running towards the Spirit Hall without any
      impediment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The status quo in the shelter had yet to be wholly flipped, but Little
      Angel and Han Sen&#8217;s pets had more than what it took to handle four
      rival super creatures. Without worry, he ran to the Spirit Hall as quickly
      as he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a statue inside, reminiscent of Yaksha. In its forehead, a
      spirit stone rested. But as he looked, Han Sen began to develop an uneasy
      feeling, suspecting something was amiss.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit stone did not seem alive. It lacked its spirit and was instead
      just a stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless, he flew towards the statue and collected the lifeless gem. The
      Devil-Blood King did not show after this, and so Han Sen crushed the jewel
      into dust. He didn&#8217;t believe that the spirit had been killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;D*mn it! This is not the Spirit Hall.&#8221; Han Sen felt awful. If
      this wasn&#8217;t the Spirit Hall, then he knew he&#8217;d have great
      difficulty searching for the true location in such a large shelter. The
      real Spirit Hall must have been hidden, a machination of the Devil-Blood
      King, undoubtedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Running out of the false hall, he used his dongxuan aura as he ran all
      across the shelter. His time was running out, and still, he could not find
      the Devil-Blood King nor the spirit stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;D*mn it!&#8221; Han Sen cursed his predicament. He calculated his
      remaining time, and determined he had fifty minutes left before the rest
      of the super creatures returned to the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen stopped scouring the shelter for the Spirit Hall. The
      Devil-Blood King had obviously devised a way to make finding the Spirit
      Hall nigh impossible, and he knew he wouldn&#8217;t have been able to find
      it in the time he had.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of wasting more time, he thought it would be better to kill as
      many super creatures as he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      The red-maned lion was battling the silver fox, the black-bat fought with
      Little Angel, and the fairy did combat with the big-mawed monster.
      Although Han Sen&#8217;s pets were stronger, the holy light bug had
      continued buffing and increasing the defense of its compatriots. As such,
      the time it was taking them to kill the super creatures was far longer
      than it should have been.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that the Spirit Owl had devoured half of the Cruel Witch, Han Sen
      then summoned his Death Knell to soak and drink as much blood as it could.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue bell hovered in and above the blood, sucking the blood up like a
      vacuum.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue bell then became red, with diagrammatic symbols and etchings
      illuminated brightly across its surface. After that, the bell tolled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen didn&#8217;t have the time to inspect what had happened
      closely. He summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and kept on running towards the
      holy light bug. If he did not slay that pest, it would be extremely
      difficult to kill anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had already sensed that the holy light bug was a second generation
      super creature, due to his ability to discern the energy flow inside it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The holy light bug, seeing Han Sen approach, skittered away rapidly with
      its four legs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised by this. He was exhausted and weak, so he was taken
      aback about why the critter would be so scared of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The holy light bug ran away from him as if it was panicking. Suddenly, its
      condition became clear to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That bug keeps on buffing other super creatures, yes; but it never
      joins the fight itself. Does that mean it is really weak?&#8221; Thinking
      of this, Han Sen&#8217;s mood lifted. With greater haste, he sped up to
      chase after it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when Han Sen ran faster, so too did the bug. And with the speed of the
      super creature that it was, Han Sen was unable to catch up.
    </p>

    <p>The holy light bug eventually turned around, as if to mock Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      When it looked back, Han Sen summoned his devil-eye mask. His eyes flashed
      with a blue light that seemed to confuse the bug. It stopped moving and
      its holy light dimmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Die!&#8221; Han Sen cast Sonic-Thunder Punch at the shell of the
      creature with unbridled force.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thunder sounded in the shelter as a sun of silver light was driven inside
      the bug. It screamed as lightning poured out of its every orifice.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Angel?&#8221; It hadn&#8217;t been killed yet, so he called
      over his pet to deliver the finisher. With her greatsword, she pierced
      right through the shell.
    </p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      &#8220;Again, no beast soul? Why am I so unfortunate?&#8221; Han Sen
      recalled his promise to Wang Yuhang, who was set to receive the first
      beast soul. Now, his thoughts were starting to shift. &#8220;I
      shouldn&#8217;t have allowed him to get first pick of a beast soul. With
      his bad luck, we are likely not to receive any today, anyway.&#8221;
