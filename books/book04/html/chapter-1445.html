    <p>
      The wooden sword was black, but the lightning was white. It struck the egg
      and was absorbed by the shell. As this occurred, the egg began to shine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the wooden sword and the egg in shock. The lightning
      from the wooden sword did not look aggressive, but it was radiant and
      brimming with energy. It looked as if it wished to bestow life upon its
      target.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if the egg Little Silver had become was desiring flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then placed the sword on top of the egg, to see if Little Silver
      would have some sort of reaction. Thunder Godwood was rare, but if it
      could speed up Little Silver’s evolution, Han Sen wouldn’t mind spending
      it on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, Little Silver had been with Han Sen for a very long time. He
      had saved Han Sen’s life many times, as well. As far as Han Sen was
      concerned, Little Silver was a part of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sword came into contact with the egg, the lightning flowed into
      the egg like silk. The egg glowed brighter and brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprisingly, despite the fact that the Thunder Godwood had been shaped
      into a sword, it began to look lively. Its charcoal body looked as if it
      had been moisturized, and it was undergoing a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, Han Sen saw a sprout on the wood. More and more began to
      pop up across the sword, making it look like some dry fallen log that had
      submitted to overgrowth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does this represent the turn of seasons; the coming of spring replacing
      the winter?” Han Sen sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightning continued to pour out of the wood, and the egg’s glow made it
      look like a silver sun. The wooden sword had become a little tree,
      flourishing with green leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not last long, though. When the wooden sword was decked in green
      leaves, the lifeforce it had exhibited began to fade. Slowly, those leaves
      began to die. And as this occurred, the lightning it generated diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, all the leaves had died and there was no more lightning. After
      a momentary stillness, pat! The sword crumbled into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt hurt. It was a treasure one could earn only once every ten
      thousand years, and it had been procured from an emperor. Now that it had
      been destroyed, Han Sen was unsure if he’d ever get another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the silver light that still burned before him, Han Sen could detect
      Little Silver’s lifeforce becoming stronger.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      Inside the silver sun, there was some noise, then a thunderbolt burst out
      to beam through the entire hall. But the silver light did not hurt Han
      Sen. It made him feel good, as if he was being energized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the silver light, something elegant, decked in silver fur, had
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Silver!” Han Sen was so happy that he picked the furry thing up
      and stroked its head. Little Silver squinted its eyes and looked proud.
      But above all, it looked happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lightning slowly began to fade, and when it did, Little Silver jumped
      away from Han Sen. It shook itself, showcasing its extremely smooth hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t randomly hold a girl.” Little Silver said in a mockingly feminine
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, hearing this. He went over to pick up Little Silver
      again and said, “You speak the human language now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I said you shouldn’t grab me. Look, you’ve messed up my hair again.”
      Little Silver leaped away from Han Sen again and shook down his hair to
      reset it. With a proud tone of voice, he turned to tell Han Sen, “The
      human language is easy to learn. It’s nothing to be proud of.”
    </p>
    <p>“I knew you were the best.” Han Sen bent down to rub his head.</p>
    <p>
      Little Silver looked all cocky, but did not tell Han Sen not to touch him
      this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Little Silver had been reborn, Han Sen was exuberantly happy.
      Unfortunately, this upset Bao’er. She used to be the sole recipient of Han
      Sen’s love, and he took her everywhere. Now, she felt she’d have to
      compete for Han Sen’s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er and Little Silver looked at each other. A spark of rivalry jolted
      between them, and they both turned around to look away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Silver was like the heir of a super creature, and so was his
      fitness level. Little Silver had received a geno core, but it was only a
      bronze one. He’d have to spend much time leveling it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen planned to take Bao’er and Little Silver down into the Underworld.
      He worried if he was gone from there for too long, Ling Mei’er would fall
      prey to another one of Spirit Thirteen’s machinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a shame if such a cute girl was tricked into making babies for
      Spirit Thirteen, of all people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Han Sen left Shadow Shelter, he felt something very powerful
      approaching. It immediately made him frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew who it was. It had visited the shelter twice before, after
      all. It was Qing Le from Outer Sky Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen quickly went to hide in the spirit hall, while Cheap Sheep and
      Green Cow went over to welcome him in and see what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow commanded a few creatures to open the gates. The
      sheep smiled as the gates opened and said, “Mister Qing Le, welcome! I
      wonder what business brings you here. Whatever it is, I assure you we will
      strive for co-operation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Qing Le looked dim and replied, “From now on, I own this shelter. You are
      all to follow my command.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Qing Le was in a bad mood. Han Sen was the only member of their search
      party to escape the mystic shelter. Qing Le and Yu Xuan had been
      responsible for recruiting Han Sen, so Qing Le expected a reward of his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen did not provide them with useful intel, and they couldn’t
      claim the shelter. The rewards Qing Le wished to receive did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reward aside, despite the fact that Qing Le was close with Yu Xuan, Yu
      Miao hated him. He had been forced to patrol this region, but there was
      nothing at all around. Shadow Shelter was one of the only decent shelters
      in the vicinity. Plus, he believed Han Sen’s mind had been damaged. Now,
      he wanted to occupy the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>Hearing him say this, Cheap Sheep and Green Cow’s faces changed.</p>
    <p>
      “Mister, there is no need for you to control this entire shelter. Just
      tell us what it is you need, and we will go and fetch it for you,” Cheap
      Sheep said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cut the crap! Take me to the spirit hall. I’m your boss now.” Qing Le was
      very upset, and he had no interest in discussing matters with the sheep.
      He barged inside the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine! Fine! Fine! This way.” Cheap Sheep rolled his eyes and lowered his
      head as he spoke.
