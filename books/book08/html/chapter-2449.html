<p>The giant black beetle flew at high speed toward the last
location shown in the video. When they arrived, they found many
cloud beasts in the midst of battle. But because they were
surrounded by so many clouds, they could only catch occasional
glimpses of the battleground.</p>
<p>Bao Qin ordered the black beetle to be brought to a stop, then
turned back to the old butler. “Let’s not get too close to the
battleground. Before we enter, we should send someone in to
scout.”</p>
<p>Before the old butler could agree, a huge white whale appeared
out of the clouds and headed straight toward them.</p>
<p>Following the white whale was a group of cloud beasts. They
seemed very angry.</p>
<p>“Ready yourselves to fight!” Bao Qin shouted, frowning as the
white whale approached.</p>
<p>The black beetle’s Extreme King knights quickly assembled into
battle formations. The big white whale approached at high speed,
but instead of ramming the black beetle as they expected, the whale
dove and went right under their ship.</p>
<p>Bao Qin and the Extreme King knights wondered why the white
whale had decided to simply pass them by, but they didn’t have much
time to think about it. The cloud beasts that had been chasing the
whale surged over them in a wave.</p>
<p>A King class group of giant cloud dragons were flying behind the
cloud beasts, but even they seemed weak and unthreatening compared
to what followed.</p>
<p>The giant cloud dragons were hitched to a rainbow-colored
carriage made of cloud stone. Despite their incredible power and
ferocity, the cloud dragons were being used as mere beasts of
burden.</p>
<p>“D*mn it! It’s the sea demon’s carriage! We have to get out of
here!” Bao Qin’s face paled slightly, and his words were
rushed.</p>
<p>But it was already too late. The sea beasts were upon them, and
the giant cloud dragons dragging the stone carriage arrived before
the black beetle.</p>
<p>The white whale had vanished at some point, and the giant black
beetle was now surrounded by monsters of the clouds. The Extreme
King knights engaged the cloud beasts in combat.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Good job, everyone!” Han Sen said to Fang Qing Yu and the
others as he admired the Extreme King, who were now fighting the
cloud beasts.</p>
<p>“It is our honor to work for the captain and the little
captain,” one of the pirates said, bowing deeply. An ingratiating
smile covered his face.</p>
<p>“The captain and the little captain are the smartest people in
the whole universe. Those Extreme King aren’t even fit to lick your
boots.”</p>
<p>“The captain is so handsome. The little captain is so beautiful.
You both hold the universe in your hands, and every decision you
make is a turning point in history.”</p>
<p>“Long live the big captain and small captain! Long live the big
captain and small captain!”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at all the pirates who were gushing praises for
him and Bao’er, and he couldn’t help but admit that it felt pretty
good. Bao’er was loving it.</p>
<p>“No wonder everyone wants to become a tyrant with an evil
right-hand man. This is great,” Han Sen thought happily.</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen hadn’t deluded himself into thinking that this
was actually his idea. Fang Qing Yu had come up with the plan, and
Han Sen was only reaping the advantages of its employment.</p>
<p>It was just as Fang Qing Yu had said. The Tianxia System was way
too dangerous, and getting through it safely might have been little
more than wishful thinking. They hadn’t been planning to encounter
the scary cloud dragons, after all.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t dare to fight the cloud dragons. He piloted the
white whale away from them as he tried to escape. Then, he allowed
Fang Qing Yu to create a scenario that would draw in the Extreme
King search party. Once the Extreme King arrived, they had earned
the ire of the monsters within minutes.</p>
<p>The cloud dragons weren’t happy to have intruders in their
territory.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what the stone carriage behind the cloud
dragons was, but after Fang Qing Yu used the Wanjie Rubix Cube to
contact his Thousand Treasures step-father, they learned that it
was the legendary Sea Demon Carriage. If not for the Thousand
Treasures, Han Sen might not have fled from the carriage in time.
It would have certainly been a nasty fight.</p>
<p>That Thousand Treasures elder used the Rubix cube to tell Han
Sen that the Sea Demon Carriage was the most mysterious and scary
xenogeneics in the Tianxia System. The legends said that the giant
cloud dragons pulled the Tianxia System’s leader in that
carriage.</p>
<p>Not many people had ever glimpsed what was inside that carriage,
though. When the Sea Demon Carriage opened, anyone who saw it
usually died shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>The white whale hovered some distance from the battlefield. They
hid amidst the clouds, and Fang Qing Yu looked very excited. He
filmed the fight between the Extreme King and the cloud beasts
intently, streaming the video to his Thousand Treasures
step-father.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu took special care to capture the Sea Demon Carriage
on video. He would never miss an opportunity to film that.</p>
<p>He wanted the chance to film the being inside the Sea Demon Car.
He wanted a first-hand account of this fight. That information
might be the most valuable thing he had ever possessed.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t just the information that would fetch a
high price. The video itself would be worth a lot. Fang Qing Yu’s
step-father had already started working on it. The Thousand
Treasures was the best organization in the universe when it came to
making money, and a video like that would be a money-making
machine.</p>
<p>The video would require some editing before it was released,
though.</p>
<p>Han Sen really admired the business acumen of the Thousand
Treasures. Plus, with Fang Qing Yu remaining in constant contact
with his step-father, the Thousand Treasures could give them
information about any creatures they encountered in the Tianxia
System. Han Sen could avoid many potential dangers and pitfalls,
and they wouldn’t have to go up against a creature that might be
too much for them. They could even detour around areas with a
particularly high death toll.</p>
<p>“It’s out!” Fang Qing Yu shouted very excitedly.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked back to the battleground. The cloud dragons were
cringing away from the open door of the carriage, and after a few
long seconds, something stepped through the open door.</p>
<p>All eyes were drawn to the newly-emerged monster. Han Sen had
never seen a living creature like it before. Its body was like a
black cloud, with a black demonic form standing somewhere in the
middle. It was impossible to see exactly what the creature looked
like, but it possessed a dark humanoid shape.</p>
<p>But the being seemed to have a shadowy tail, and its hair was
like fire. A pair of eyes could be seen through the dark cloud,
burning with a red and purple flame. Only its disturbing eyes could
be seen clearly, as everything else about its form was murky and
indistinct.</p>
<p>Bao Qin stood atop the castle, watching the scary creature
emerge from the stone carriage.</p>
<p>“Demon Spirit, we of the Extreme King have never offended you.
We were pursuing someone else along this path…”</p>
<p>But that scary creature didn’t answer. Its eyes glowed evilly,
and it threw a punch toward Bao Qin.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others didn’t see the punch land, but they could
see the enormous black beetle explode under the force of the
shockwave. Blood rained everywhere, dyeing the blue clouds scarlet
around it.</p>
<p>Some Extreme King knights hadn’t been able to get clear of the
black beetle, and so the hit destroyed their King knight bodies.
They disintegrated, becoming a part of that red mist.</p>
<p>Bao Qin hung in the air, and the ghostly Demon Spirit teleported
directly in front of him.</p>
<p>“It has started.” Han Sen’s eyes brightened with anticipation.
There was going to be a deified fight. If the two fighters ended up
badly injured, he could take advantage of the situation and claim
them both.</p>
