<h2>Battle in the Dragon Pool</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2042</h3>

<p>Han Sen only noticed now that the helmet on the seat turtle
statue had a circular, plate-sized slot in the top.</p>
<p>The Spiky Turtle King’s body landed atop the helmet. It withdrew
its neck and limbs into its shell and dropped neatly into the slot.
It was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The Spiky Turtle King’s black diamond shell began to shine.
Then, the entire statue started to shine with that same black
light, too. The blue statue slowly turned black, and the turtle’s
hammers transformed into black crystals. A lifeforce began to
radiate from them.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were appropriately shocked. They had
never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The hammer-wielding turtle moved forward. With a single step, it
made the floor of the entire pool shake. The power surged through
the water around it, sweeping all the turtles backward.</p>
<p>“Such power! That exceeds even a King!” Long Yin was in
shock.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen shook his head. “No, it is not above King class.
It is around half-deified.”</p>
<p>Xius nodded and said, “It is not deified, but it is certainly
greater than a basic King class. It is half-deified.”</p>
<p>As the three of them spoke, the dual-wielding turtle walked
through the ruins. That giant palace was perfectly sized for the
turtle. He walked toward the palace, smacking down buildings that
happened to be in his way with his hammers.</p>
<p>Every swing released a frightening shockwave, crushing the blue
rocks scattered about. He pushed all the stone and rubble aside,
forming a path for himself.</p>
<p>He came to the front gate of the palace, approximately one mile
away.</p>
<p>When he approached the palace and swung a hammer toward it, a
dragon-like power suddenly shot out of the palace and collided with
the shockwave.</p>
<p>The two powers crashed against each other, but no explosion was
released. The two powers tangled together instead, forming a giant
underwater tornado. Everything around them was sucked into it.</p>
<p>The turtles in the vicinity tried to swim away. Some of the
slower Spiky Turtles were pulled into the tornado. They were
crushed by its velocity within a second, and red streams began to
circle within the vortex.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Turtle Statue swung one of its hammers. The power of its
strike broke through the tornado, allowing some of the luckier
Spiky Turtles to get away.</p>
<p>Han Sen immediately started swimming away, as that power was too
frightening. It was far beyond a level he could be expected to
fight.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen was of the same mind. Together, they all looked
to escape. If they did not leave now, they might not be able to
withstand the power that would be released as the fight continued.
They could very well die there.</p>
<p>A strange door then opened within the palace. Han Sen was in the
midst of swimming away, but he still turned to look back.</p>
<p>Through that doorway, a giant head appeared. It was the Dragon
God that had eaten Han Sen.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>A Dragon roar came from its mouth. The shockwave shot forward
with blinding speed, and Han Sen and Dragon Fifteen were too slow
to evade it. The impact left blood trailing past their lips.</p>
<p>Now the fight began in earnest. As the two monsters fought, the
simple shockwaves were enough to kill Han Sen and Dragon
Fifteen.</p>
<p>There were more hammer-strike sounds, and Han Sen heard two more
roars. And then, the world started to tremble again.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have time to look at what might have happened.
He swam quickly toward the surface.</p>
<p>Long Ying grabbed Dragon Fifteen and summoned her powers. Her
dragon wings unfurled and then snapped downward with the force of a
cannon, firing the two Dragons toward the surface. She completely
ignored Han Sen and Xius.</p>
<p>Xius flapped her snake tail and used a holy light for a boost,
which let her swim faster than any fish. She outran all the Spiky
Turtles, even those that were of Duke class.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not slow down, either. He focused all his power and
skill into swimming, and he was able to keep up with Xius.</p>
<p>Xius was shocked to see Han Sen maintaining pace with her. But
now was not the time to watch Han Sen. She had to focus on reaching
the surface.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A giant shockwave was approaching. Han Sen moved fast, ducking
into the refuge offered by a Duke turtle’s shell. And then, that
power went right past him. It tore apart all the lesser turtles
around. Their shells were ripped open like paper, and their gore
dyed the water red.</p>
<p>The Duke class giant turtles were bounced ten meters
forward.</p>
<p>Han Sen was knocked into a giant turtle. He quickly grabbed the
cannon-like spikes and allowed the turtle to tow him back to the
surface.</p>
<p>Xius was hit, too. But she was strong, and she survived the
shockwave. She also reached the surface.</p>
<p>When they reached the surface, Dragon Fifteen quickly gathered
Long Shan and the others onto a giant green leaf. Xius landed on
another green leaf. They were leaving that island with all
haste.</p>
<p>The turtles wanted to escape, too. Han Sen remained atop a
turtle’s back, clutching its spike. The Duke class Spiky Turtles
could run faster than he could.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Before the turtles reached the shoreline, a noise began to
rumble from the pool. The water in the pool swelled up like a
pillar, rising a hundred meters into the sky.</p>
<p>And then, an angry beast appeared. It had blue scales, and it
possessed the head of a dragon. Its body, however, was like a
kirin’s. It was glowing blue. It wasn’t like a monster, overall; it
was more like a holy beast.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen knew what the Dragon God really looked like. He did
not know what sort of xenogeneic it could be, though.</p>
<p>The black crystal turtle followed it out, wielding two black
hammers in its hands. The hammers tore apart space itself, and the
turtle teleported in front of the Dragon God.</p>
<p>The Dragon God roared. Its blue presence struck the hammer with
earthquake</p>
<p>force.</p>
<p>The power broke the mountains of the island, and Han Sen’s Spiky
Turtle was sent rolling. Not long after, Han Sen and the turtle
fell into the sea. Han Sen was still clutching the spike
firmly.</p>
<p>The scary power flew wildly throughout Return Ruin Sea. Even
underwater, Han Sen could feel the surges of power. Waves rose to
heights of a hundred meters, and lots of water was vaporized.</p>
