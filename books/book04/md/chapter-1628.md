“Who is in danger?” Tang Zhenliu asked.

“Dollar. He is gambling. Even if you’ve successfully gambled a hundred times, all it takes is one loss. If he loses, he’ll be done for,” Gu Qingcheng explained.

“Gambling?” Everyone looked at Gu Qingcheng with confusion. The fight between Han Sen and Six Paths was too fast for them to keep track of.

Gu Qingcheng, after a moment of thought, said, “Six Paths Emperor’s sword skills are incredible. He is a champion with the sword. He won’t grant an opponent a moment of reprieve, and he is flawless. He does everything he can to take the advantage and make his opponent lose hope of victory. His sword skills are something you can’t overcome.”

“Does that mean Dollar is actually losing?” Wang Yuhang opened his eyes wide.

Gu Qingcheng shook her head. “Maybe not. If it was someone else, they might use strength to break the attack. If the power was sufficient to suppress Six Paths, his sword skill would break. I don’t think anyone can possess more strength than Six Paths in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, however. So, Dollar is doing something different. He is gambling a potential victory.”

“Gamble?” Wang Yuhang still did not understand. He had no clue what she was talking about.

Gu Qingcheng looked at Han Sen and said, “Yes, he is gambling. The Champion Sword is using his experience to beat the opponent. He’s not supposed to reveal a single flaw he has to his foe. Dollar, on the other hand, is doing things differently. He is not trying to uncover flaws through skills. He is going with the flow, rather. When the enemy strikes, he falls back. When the enemy falls back, he strikes. It’s keeping Six Paths from gaining the advantage and pushing Dollar to the point where his hope begins to wane.”

“That sounds good. Why is it gambling?” Tang Zhenliu did not understand, either.

Gu Qingcheng said quietly, “Swordskills can be different. You cannot predict where Six Paths Emperor, who is so strong, or an average run-of-the-mill swordsman, will put their strength.”

Now they knew why Dollar was gambling. It was hard to predict how an opponent would use their sword precisely, especially for a fight as wild as that. Everything was happening at breakneck speed, and it was difficult to determine where the next strike would fall.

If Han Sen did this correctly, he could slowly eliminate Six Paths’ sword power. But that was just the power of his sword, and there was still no guarantee of victory.

If he blocked the wrong direction and failed to beat back the Six Paths Sword, things could go bad.

All that time, Han Sen was using his finger to flick Six Paths’ blade away. It didn’t cost much strength, but it required a lot of unflagging judgment That was much harder than exerting total strength. He couldn’t afford to miss once.

“If this continues, Dollar will miss and Six Paths is going to win. He has gotten so strong… I hope I don’t have to meet him until I reach the rankings of the ten Son of Gods.” A powerful elite now realized Han Sen was actually in trouble.

It was a gamble that he could not afford to lose. Dollar only had one life, whereas Six Paths had many.

Time passed and the fight raged on. The faces of the audience began to change.

“Weird. Why does he keep succeeding? Does he know Six Paths’ skills better than Six Paths himself?”

“No way! How can he always be right and never miss?”

“This Dollar is weird.”

“Does he have Falsified-Sky power, and that means he always moves correctly?”

“This is unbelievable.”

The match continued, alongside much discussion. No one understood why Dollar was so lucky in his judgment.

“Interesting.” Jade Shura looked at Han Sen with much intrigue.

Six Paths looked interested, too. He was keen to see how long his opponent could last He was pushing Blood Sword to the max, but still, he could not penetrate Han Sen’s defense.

As everyone looked on, trying to predict how much longer he’d last, the swordlight suddenly disappeared. Six Paths withdrew his sword and stopped attacking.

“That is some incredible power control and foresight. You are undoubtedly the best I have ever seen,” Six Paths spoke to Han Sen.

Han Sen looked at Six Paths but did not say anything. He knew the next attack would be even scarier. Life Sword was even more frightening than Blood Sword.

If Blood Sword was a Champion Sword, Life Sword was a Killer Sword.

You could predict the Champion Sword, but not the Killer Sword. Han Sen was not psychic; he was just excellent when it came to prediction.

Six Paths Emperor then turned into a different person. Now, he was like an animal that was full of the wild unknown.

He brandished his sword towards Han Sen, prompting Han Sen to flick it again. But this time, he could not send it astray. Six Paths’ sword skills had changed. He started to slash without a moment of reprieve in between.

Six Paths became a monster that wished to strangle Han Sen. He came out from different directions to attack Han Sen’s weakspot, and he took aim at his Life Door.

It wasn’t steady, and the chance of calculating the attacks was non-existent. Every slash did not seem connected, and they couldn’t be predicted. Han Sen had no choice but to fight

Han Sen’s body then glowed with holy light. He could not predict the flight of the Six Paths Sword, and he had to react instantly.

They were both like a pair of ancient monsters, battling in a primitive arena.

“These two are too scary. We’re only talking about battle skills, and yet they can cause a reaction such as this? Their battle powers must be inside their bones,” Furnace Emperor said with a little awe.

“Dollar is starting to take advantage,” the Sacred leader spoke to himself.

It wasn’t just Sacred leader thinking this. The entire elite audience had watched Six Paths unleash himself. Yet when he used Life Sword, he was suppressed by Dollar and put at a disadvantage.

“Powerful Dollar. I wonder where he comes from?” Outer Sky looked confused.

Six Paths Emperor used Life Sword and got suppressed. This had only happened once before. And at that time, Six Paths hadn’t been this strong, either.
