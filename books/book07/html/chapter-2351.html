<h2>Breaking the Door</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2351</h3>

<p>While Han Sen was staring at the geno hall, the black crystal
armor inside his Sea of Soul suddenly released a mysterious
substance. It wrapped around Han Sen, covering him completely.
After that, Han Sen couldn’t even detect his own presence. It was
as if he didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly thought back to the time with Kong Fei. “When
the geno hall appeared previously, the black crystal armor did
something similar to this. Is the black crystal armor connected to
the geno hall? Or is it simply afraid of the geno hall?”</p>
<p>While Han Sen pondered this, he heard Ancient Water God roaring
to the sky. “I have the name Water God! I am the alpha of water! I
am going to become the Water God Spirit, and no one can stop
me!”</p>
<p>When Ancient Water God roared to the sky, the water that had
been suppressed by the geno hall began flowing toward him again. It
was like a bunch of stars amassing in Ancient Water God’s body.</p>
<p>As the additional water strengthened him, Ancient Water God’s
body grew powerful enough to tear the fabric of space into shreds.
His enormous form rose, heading for the geno hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared up blankly. Ancient Water God’s power must have
been practically endless to have reached such a high level. His
body was unimaginably large, and it drowned the nearby planets as
it moved. Seawater was the only thing visible in any direction.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked to the sky and saw that even the sky had been
overtaken by water. And yet somehow, above that ocean, the
mysterious geno hall was still visible.</p>
<p>“Ancient God is scary,” Han Sen thought with trepidation. He had
seen many deified elites since coming to the geno universe, but
this was the first time he had ever seen destructive power on such
a massive scale.</p>
<p>If Ancient Water God wanted to kill, he could destroy an entire
system within the space of a second. No living creature could block
that sort of power.</p>
<p>Xius looked up with wide eyes, and she said, “Ancient Gods are
born deified, and their lifespan is a billion years. Few creatures
can ever hope to rival the Ancient God in this universe.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A loud noise boomed above them, forming massive waves on the
surface of the hovering water. Then, a heavy rain was unleashed. A
shockwave rolled out from the water, shaking the mountains as it
brushed their peaks.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Xius were blasted away by the scary shockwave that
had been released. It was as if they were struggling against the
rush of a tsunami, but their efforts were futile. They were tossed
aside like ants.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body hit a mountainside, and the peak collapsed. Blood
trickled from Han Sen’s mouth. He used all his power to repel the
force, but he couldn’t hold back the overwhelming shockwave. He
couldn’t even stand up straight.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Another shockwave rolled across the sky, and lots of heavy rain
followed in its wake. The rain slammed down like a tsunami, shoving
Han Sen back even further.</p>
<p>As the blows slammed into Han Sen and damaged his organs, they
triggered the Kingese. Shining gold symbols appeared across Han
Sen’s flesh, making him far stronger. Han Sen regained his feet
against the force pressing down on him.</p>
<p>Xius hit the bottom of the sea and was pressed into the mud with
the dying ocean creatures. She was about to be buried inside a
crevice that appeared in the bedrock.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He broke through the tsunami-like shockwave and
raced next to Xius to pull her out of the crevice and the sea.</p>
<p>He grabbed Xius and looked up into the sky. The turmoil and
heavy rain that followed obscured his vision, casting the entire
planet into chaos. He couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Ancient Water God was still roaring above him, and he heard the
sounds of big waves hitting space. The impacts seemed strong enough
to make the stars themselves rattle and shake. Countless mountains
were crumbling under the onslaught.</p>
<p>This level of power was far beyond what Han Sen could
comprehend. With the protection of the Kingese, Han Sen barely
managed to stay upright in the storm. He stood atop a big rock,
looking up at the sky. He wanted to know what Ancient Water God was
doing, but he couldn’t see past the wall of rain.</p>
<p>Xius was close to becoming a King, but she could only hide in
the shelter provided by Han Sen’s stalwart body. She held onto him
tightly to avoid getting pulled into the bottom of the sea
again.</p>
<p>The whole universe appeared to be shaking under that tumultuous
sea. Ancient Water God’s voice resounded throughout the universe
with deafening volume.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t see the actual battle, but he could hear in
Ancient Water God’s roar that the creature was fighting. It sounded
like the Ancient God was putting everything he had into the
fight.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen heard a strange sound, like a stone door
grinding open. A light shone through the air.</p>
<p>That light beamed through the water above, cutting clean through
all of the chaos. Han Sen had been nearly blind earlier, but now he
could clearly see through the storm.</p>
<p>That light didn’t seem to be at full strength, though. It was as
if someone had pushed open a door to let the light of a flickering
candlestick seep out.</p>
<p>“The geno hall’s door has opened.” The water kept smacking Han
Sen in the face, but he was still able to see what was happening
clearly. That light was coming from the geno hall’s door, which had
been pushed open a little.</p>
<p>“I am a god spirit, and no one can stop me!” Ancient Water God
kept roaring. His enormous body was trying to force its way into
the gap of the geno hall’s door.</p>
<p>“Did he succeed?” With the Purple-Eye Butterfly running in his
right eye, Han Sen was staring at the geno hall’s door.</p>
<p>He didn’t know exactly how someone became a god spirit, but
judging from what Ancient Water God was doing, Han Sen could guess
that the Ancient God was making his way into the geno hall. Perhaps
if he entered the hall, he would become a god spirit.</p>
<p>A thousand races had lanterns there, but they were just
lanterns. Entering the geno hall as an individual was a different
matter. Only a race’s geno lantern could reside in the hall.</p>
<p>Now, Ancient Water God was trying to force his body into the
geno hall. He wanted to go in, but it wasn’t clear what would
happen if he succeeded.</p>
<p>The enormous body pressed against the door, waves continually
slamming into its surface. The water was going to rush into the
hall at any second.</p>
<p>But suddenly, Han Sen saw a hand emerge from the gap of the ajar
geno hall door.</p>
<p>That hand was so beautiful. The moment the hand emerged from
beyond that gap, it pressed against Ancient Water God’s body and
drove him back.</p>
<p>Then the hand vanished behind the door again. The geno hall’s
door shut. The sea hung above them, perfectly still, and the storm
stopped.</p>
<p>The door was closed, and the light was gone. Han Sen was now
unable to see the geno hall. All he could see was that blue sea
that had taken over the sky.</p>
<p>The next second, a red dye began to spread through the water. It
opened like a flower. In moments, the water in the sky had become a
sea of blood.</p>
<p>With a boom, the bloody sea collapsed. A rain of blood poured
down, covering everything in crimson.</p>
