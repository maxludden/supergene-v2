People are not born with willpower. Although some people are born with stronger willpower, it could not be much stronger.

The true elites gained experience through repeated failures. It enabled their hearts to become stronger. The more times they failed, the stronger their hearts could become.

Of course, many people were not up for enduring such training. They easily gave up under the intense suffering repeated failures can bring. They would lose themselves and become the ones who never were special or anything big in life.

Han Sen had encountered constant troubles. It was unknown how many times he had almost died. He had succeeded a lot and failed a lot. His heart had been trained through many crises. Although no one could say his willpower was more stable than the willpower of others, in this world, few things could truly move his will.

Although the sword shadow’s willpower was stronger than his, it was unable to make Han Sen bend enough to break.

A man and a sword were frozen there. The woman in Han Sen’s head kept repeating the sentence, “One-inch thinking, then one-inch grey.” The strong mental power kept increasing. Still, the piled-on pressure was not enough to make Han Sen’s willpower bend and break.

The sword mind was like a big wave in a raging sea. That wave was immensely strong, but Han Sen’s will was like a piece of coral. Coral was small, but the sea and waves were still unable to break it.

“What is this sword? It has such scary willpower. I am afraid it might be as strong as God Hall Leader, but this is just a sword.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He did not dare think too much about things. He just held on in his battle against the sword mind.

Now, Han Sen was riding a tiger. Whenever his heart wanted to give up and let go of the bronze sword, the sword mind attacked him harder and forced him to lose even faster. Therefore, Han Sen had no choice but to continue. He could not risk quitting.

Many musical waves attacked Han Sen’s willpower. It made him feel as if he was being cut up by icy knives or scorched by raging fires.

He knew if he chose to concede, the pain would go away. He only needed to be controlled and forced to dance once. That way, he could escape the unceasing pain. Han Sen did not want that.

It was unknown how much time went by when the sounds of the illusion stopped. The woman looked at Han Sen strangely before suddenly vanishing. Han Sen felt as if his entire body had been rendered empty. He had not participated in a big fight, but that kind of mental fighting cost more energy than an ordinary fight that would cause him to bleed.

The bronze sword’s sword light went dim. It looked like it originally did. Han Sen pulled it with his hands. The bronze sword was removed from the ground.

The bronze sword no longer resisted him, but it did not comply with Han Sen’s will. It was a dead object without a soul. “Han Sen pulled the sword out,” Qin Bai said with glee. He sensed that Han Sen was much stronger than his teachers. Even Thousand Mile Reach had been turned into something weird by that sword. If Han Sen was able to resist that, it was obvious Han Sen was stronger.

Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach were strong. They looked happy as they said, “Mister Han really is a character that is quite like a god. Even these weapons must pledge allegiance and obedience to you.”

Han Sen shook his head and said, “I only removed a sword from the ground. I did not really make it obey me. It might belong to me now, but it won’t listen to me. This is like a rubbish sword.”

“Why would it be like that?” Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach were confused.

Han Sen tried to control the bronze sword, but the bronze sword did not move. It was not lively like the emerald stone sword or diamond great sword. It was just an ordinary bronze sword.

While the few of them were checking it out, it suddenly felt as if the space around them was starting to madly shake. The weapons nearby and in the distance were trembling. In the twist of space, a strange god temple started to appear.

The god temple was very weird. The bricks were made of battle hammers, and the roof was built from swords and knives. The walls were made from long spears. The plaza’s grounds were built from shields.

That entire god temple was composed of all sorts of different weapons. It was like one grand, weird, and cluttered arsenal.

The expressions on the faces of Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach changed. The god temple appearing there had to be the one that belonged to the God Chaos Party. That was the only one that existed in that realm.

Han Sen looked at it. He saw the weird god temple sign only had three words, “Weapon God Temple.”

Before everyone inspected the Weapon God Temple, the door of the temple opened. The shape of a giant suit of armor, which was around 30 feet tall, walked out.

Behind the giant set of armor, all sorts of strange weapons were lined up and floating behind him. From behind, it looked like some sort of Buddha light.

Han Sen guessed it was Weapon God Temple’s Weapon God. Judging from the sense he was getting from it, it was probably as scary as Decapitation Queen. “Where did the God Chaos Party find so many scary elites to plump up their ranks?” Han Sen thought.

Han Sen was not entirely sure. There were quite a few God Chaos Party members, but there weren’t many real members. When it came to the main core members, there were even fewer. Not many people knew about their god temples either.

In Soldier Knife Sky, only that Weapon God would have a god temple. It was likely because he was a core member of the God Chaos Party. He had to be one of the eight big kings of the God Chaos Party, and he was in charge of governing Soldier Knife Sky.

Weapon God’s eyes flashed with a god light. It was like he could see through the universe. He coldly shouted at Han Sen, “Who are you? How dare you move the grey sword! Do you want to die?”

Han Sen quickly made a realization. “This is called Inch Grey Sword. Is it because of the

poem?”

Weapon God looked cold. He did not say anything. He took out a big knife from the arsenal of weapons behind him. He faced Han Sen and slashed toward him.

The knife light shocked the sky and cut through space. It suddenly came before Han Sen with an insane speed.

Han Sen was holding the Inch Grey Sword. He used the sword like a knife. He used Teeth Knife’s Fang to attack the gigantic knife the 30-foot Weapon God was using against him.

Katcha!

Han Sen did not feel any power. The Inch Grey Sword, which looked like a useless piece, behaved as if it was slicing through tofu. It cut Weapon God’s big knife into little pieces.

“This sword did not activate its power. I only used the sharpness of the sword, yet I can cut the sacrifice weapon of an Annihilation God Spirit with it. This is truly terrifying.” Han Sen was very shocked.

Han Sen could not fathom what sort of power this sword could unleash if it did unleash all of its power. He could not imagine how strong it might have been.

Weapon God’s face changed. He looked at the Inch Grey Sword in Han Sen’s hand with shock. He was wearing armor. While he looked to be devoid of emotion, his eyes flickered with a god light. It proved how shocked he was.

Weapon God coldly looked at Han Sen and said, “Let the Inch Grey Sword go, and I will spare your life,”

Qin Bai shouted, “You are not making sense! Your knife was broken by Han Sen! You should be the one begging for your life to be spared!”

After hearing that, Weapon God turned his attention to Qin Bai. As he stared at the boy, Qin Bai hid behind Bao’er.

Han Sen looked at Weapon God and said, “This sword is not yours. What makes you think you can just tell me to put it down?”

Weapon God replied, “Whatever. You disrespected the Inch Grey Sword. Therefore, you should die. I was going to spare your life. If you want to die so much, then you can go to hell!” He exploded with a god light as a spear glowed in the arsenal behind him.
