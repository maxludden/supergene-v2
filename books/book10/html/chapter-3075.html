<p>The sounds coming from the cloud were something Han Sen had
heard before. They were the same sounds that had accompanied Golden
Growler’s golden door.</p>
<p>No one knew what was beyond the golden door. Whatever was pulled
inside it was dead, that much was certain. At least, no one was
able to leave when pulled inside.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was standing before the golden door, he had heard a
weird sound. It was like an ancient god was praying or reading the
chants of the Buddha.</p>
<p>It was just that Han Sen had not entered the door. He stood
outside the golden door and listened, but it was never something
clear.</p>
<p>Now that he was trying to remember it, the sounds of the golden
door were just like the sounds coming from the cloud. Han Sen just
did not understand what the sounds meant.</p>
<p>Many women loved shopping, even the three big singers, which
included Feng Fei Fei. She was browsing around in the virtual
community. She was different from ordinary women. She did not have
to buy makeup products. She was in search of the eight sound
bug.</p>
<p>She had been unable to get an eight sound bug from Night Cry
Valley and could not be bothered going back there again. So, she
planned on buying eight sound bugs online instead. She wanted to
create gene medicine for bolstering her throat.</p>
<p>She searched for an eight sound bug and sorted the results by
price from high to low. Feng Fei Fei did not care about shopping
for a bargain. She wanted the best stuff, and that was that.</p>
<p>A line of virtual products appeared before her. Feng Fei Fei was
used to browsing prices from high to low, but she froze upon seeing
the first item.</p>
<p>“Mutant eight sound bug egg? Really?” Feng Fei Fei clicked on
the item. The photo of a mutant eight sound bug egg appeared. “It
really is a mutant eight sound bug egg!” Feng Fei Fei was very
happy. In the virtual community, the shops scanned the real items.
If there was a picture, one could bet their bottom dollar that it
was genuine.</p>
<p>When Feng Fei Fei looked at the price, she frowned. The price
was placed at the maximum. It was a healthy sum of 9,999,999.</p>
<p>A mutant eight sound bug egg was very rare, but it was just an
earl class creature. That price was far too ridiculous to consider.
Clearly, the shop keeper was not going to sell it properly.</p>
<p>“Boss, how are you selling the mutant eight sound bug egg?” Feng
Fei Fei asked after contacting the person running the shop. “Dear,
the shop is selling it at the price listed. It is indeed available
for purchase. You can feel free to order it at any time. We will
have it delivered in 24 hours. If not, we’ll pay you double.” It
was Jiang Shi. Mister Yang was in charge of running the shop, but
Jiang Shi operated the customer services. She worked really hard.
Even if she received complaints, she never got mad about it.</p>
<p>Jiang Shi and You You used to be slaves. Now, they followed Han
Sen. He did not treat them like slaves. Jiang Shi was very grateful
for that. She tried to do her best with whatever task Han Sen asked
them to do.</p>
<p>“I really want to buy it, so give it to me at the price you
truly want to sell it for,” Feng Fei Fei said.</p>
<p>“Dear, I really cannot sell it to you for a lower price,” Jiang
Shi quickly said. “That is as low as it can go. You can take a look
at the other products in the shop if you would prefer. There are
very economical viscount class eight sound bug eggs for sale. They
are of good quality and fairly priced. Their abilities are great
too.” Those were the lines Mister Yang had taught her to say. She
performed them very well.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei looked around. She saw the shop was selling
ordinary eight sound bug eggs. With her identity, the ordinary
eight sound bug eggs did not really entice her.</p>
<p>“If you really want to sell it sometime, why don’t you send me a
message? We can talk about the price some more.” After saying that,
Feng Fei Fei put the mutant eight sound bug egg in her shopping
cart. “Alright, dear,” Jiang Shi replied.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei was a bit depressed. She did not want to buy the
mutant eight sound bug egg for herself. She wanted to send it to
her little niece as a birthday gift.</p>
<p>Although Feng Fei Fei had better sonic gene races, the level was
too high. Her niece was too young. She could not combine with any
high-level sonic gene races.</p>
<p>The mutant eight sound bug egg’s level was not too high.
Furthermore, it was a gene egg. If it hatched, it would be a baby.
It did not tax the body too much, so it was suitable for a child.
When the mutant eight sound bug egg grew up and had an ultimate
body, it would be very good to improve one’s voice. It would be
even better than a marquise or duke class gene egg.</p>
<p>After all, sonic gene races did not only improve one’s voice.
Mutant eight sound bugs did not do much in another direction. To
improve one’s voice, it was still a little bit worse than other
sonic gene eggs.</p>
<p>“It is a shame the seller does not plan on selling it.” Feng Fei
Fei looked at the shop’s name. She planned to remember that the was
shop called Shop.</p>
<p>In Gong Shu manor, a worker went to Gong Shu Jin’s study. He
bowed and said, “Mister, the results of my investigation are here
for your perusal.”</p>
<p>After that, the worker pulled out a file of information he had
been tasked to collect and put it down in front of Gong Shu
Jin.</p>
<p>“Good job.” Gong Shu Jin looked at the information and coldly
said, “A redneck that comes from Ancient God City, huh? He has no
background. He has no faction. In that case, how dare he insult me,
Gong Shu Jin? I must teach him a lesson. If I don’t, he won’t
understand what it means for many nobles to be under a prince’s
feet.”</p>
<p>“Mister, people like that do not deserve you to take action.”
The worker bowed and suggested, “Perhaps you should send someone
else.”</p>
<p>“You are right,” Gong Shu Jin said. “I will let you handle it.
Remember, you must bring the mutant eight sound bug’s body back
complete. It will be Miss Fei Fei’s birthday in a few days. I will
give it to her as a birthday gift.”</p>
<p>“Do not worry, Mister, I will do all this very secretively,” Lou
Jiu said with very murderous eyes.</p>
<p>“Mister, five of the eight sound bug eggs have already been
sold. Each one has sold for 35,000, and there are lots of people
asking for the price of the mutant eight sound bug egg.” Mister
Yang happily reported the results to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Their shop had only been open for a day, and they had already
raked in a few sales. It was natural to feel ecstatic.</p>
<p>“Good job.” Han Sen nodded. The mutant egg was not a small price
for Mister Yang, but it meant nothing to Han Sen. He did not really
care about it.</p>
<p>“By the way, Mister, have you heard of one weird thing?” Mister
Yang tried to test him.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Mister Yang and asked, “What weird thing?”</p>
<p>Mister Yang looked at Han Sen and said, “It was the seventh of
the last month when the jade city had a big earthquake. The king’s
family’s temple was destroyed. Someone saw that the temple had a
gold beam of light shoot into space.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang told him about this because the seventh day of the
previous month was when he and Mister Meng had dug up Han Sen. He
thought there was a connection between the two events.</p>
<p>“Really? Aren’t earthquakes breaking big buildings normal?” Han
Sen quietly asked.</p>
<p>“Mister, it is normal for other cities to have earthquakes, but
the jade city is a space city that was man-made,” Mister Yang said.
“Why would there be earthquakes?” After thinking for a moment, Han
Sen asked, “Where is the king family’s temple?” “Mister, ordinary
people cannot go there,” Mister Yang quickly answered. “There are
lots of elites guarding it. Only members of the royal family can go
there to pay their respects. They usually do that at some
festival.”</p>
