Han Sen went to meet with Yisha. He told her about the agreement he had made with Bai Wei.

When Yisha heard the details, she said, “It is good that you are going with the Extreme King. If you stayed in Narrow Moon, it is unlikely that you would find enough resources to reach King class. Although I am the ruling queen of Narrow Moon, I cannot plunder all of its resources for the sole purpose of making you a King. You will eventually have to blaze your own trail, and going with the Extreme King isn’t a bad way to start down that path.”

After that, Yisha looked at Han Sen and said, “I thought you would have chosen to follow Prince Fourteen. I didn’t expect you to go for Queen Bai Wei. Did you choose her because of her appearance?”

“That is very funny, My Queen.” Han Sen felt a chill run down his spine, and so he tried to explain. “Prince Fourteen wants to use me as a tool to get to you. There is no way I would allow that to happen.”

Yisha nodded and said, “Prince Fourteen did want me, that is right. But Prince Fourteen has much more powerful backers than Queen Bai Wei. You would earn far more resources by following him. Choosing to follow Bai Wei is a pretty bad decision.”

“Is Bai Canglang that much more important?” Han Sen hadn’t contemplated this possibility.

“His mother is of the Dragon. Therefore, he has the support of both the Dragon and the Extreme King, and he can exploit both of their resources. Queen Bai Wei is just the daughter of a servant in the Extreme King. And that servant is now dead. Compared to most of the Extreme King royals, Bai Wei’s base of support is very weak.”

After pausing, Yisha continued to say, “But because of that, her desperation and self-sufficiency may give you other opportunities. There is good and bad. Following her might not be too bad of a decision.”

Han Sen agreed. He didn’t plan on being with the Extreme King forever, though. All he wanted was to gain some more resources.

Even if Bai Wei wasn’t the best-connected of the royalty, she was still a queen. She had a far better opportunity to gain resources than any commoner did, that was for sure. She just needed to earn those resources for herself.

Han Sen packed his stuff and left with Bai Wei. During the journey, he spent a lot of his time refining his stores of Ghost Bone power to strengthen The Story of Genes.

The Story of Genes kept growing stronger, but it would still be a while before it reached Duke class. Even once he refined all of the Ghost Bone power, Han Sen wasn’t sure it would be enough to make him a Duke.

When Bai Canglang saw Han Sen board a battleship with Bai Wei, the prince stopped paying attention to him.

Bai Canglang wanted Han Sen because of his affiliation with Yisha. He wasn’t that interested in Han Sen himself. A Duke wasn’t worth very much if he didn’t have connections with more powerful people.

Han Sen had rejected his invitation, too. That had upset Bai Canglang, but the prince wouldn’t hold it against him.

At first, Han Sen thought that Bai Canglang had let the matter drop out of respect for Bai Wei, but that wasn’t the real reason. In truth, Bai Canglang still desired Yisha. Since he would have to try other methods to recruit Yisha, he didn’t plan on bringing Han Sen any harm for now.

To Bai Canglang, Han Sen had made a hilarious mistake by joining Bai Wei. He figured it would not be long before Han Sen expressed regret in his decision.

“You only brought her?” Bai Wei asked in surprise when she saw Han Sen’s young daughter.

The Extreme King wasn’t an easy place for children. Instead of bringing the powerful Han Meng’er, Han Sen was being accompanied by a small infant. It was enough to make Bai Wei frown.

“My daughter and I are very close. Without me, she cannot fall asleep.” Han Sen smiled and did not explain much.

The Extreme King’s main xenogeneic space was known as the King’s Kingdom. The system was very big. It was almost as big as the systems of chaos.

Bai Wei was a royal, but she did not live in a palace. Bai King wanted his royal family to be independent, so they were given a small planet in the King’s Kingdom as their starting point.

Bai Wei’s planet was called Planet Wind Zone. Once Han Sen reached the planet, he quickly understood why Bai Wei was having such a hard time amongst the Extreme King.

Planet Wind Zone’s environment was terrible, and there were very few resources available. It seemed as if Bai Wei was getting the shaft on her starter planet. No member of the royal family should have ended up on such a barren planet.

After bringing Han Sen to the living quarters, Bai Wei turned to address him seriously. “Now you see the squalor of my condition. I was going to finish the mission assigned to me by my father and bring back the Undying Bird Nest. If I did that, I’d have been given a planet with many resources. But now I have nothing. So, we have no time to relax. Settle in, but be ready to start working tomorrow.”

Bai Wei was living in a castle. The castle was in the center of a city, but the city looked very poor. It made Han Sen frown.

The servants and the knights in the castle were of a low caste. It was obvious that Bai Wei was having a very hard time living there.

“My Queen, do you have any enemies in your race?” Han Sen could not help but ask.

Bai Wei’s face did not change. “I am a royal, but my mother was a mere servant. There was never a way I could become a proper leader or anything. As long as I don’t challenge others for stuff, I won’t get bothered. But Princess Ten and her mother are different.”

Han Sen listened attentively, but it didn’t seem like Bai Wei wanted to talk about it. She just told Han Sen to rest, then she left.

But even though she hadn’t explained much, Han Sen could make some guesses.

He had heard stories about infighting in the royal family.

But the internal politics of the Extreme King didn’t matter to Han Sen. He was only concerned with how he could earn resources from the Extreme King.

Quickly, Han Sen realized that the Extreme King had resources everywhere. They were far wealthier than Sky Palace, but the resources here had to be fought for.

Of course, ordinary people couldn’t lay claim to items of such value. But Bai Wei was a royal, so there was a chance for her to claim resources.

The next morning, Han Sen was called to the meeting hall by Bai Wei. There, they discussed how they might enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.

The Grave of Soldiers and Kings wasn’t really a grave. It was an armory. The weapons there had been used by an assortment of different kings.

Of course, the Grave not only held the deified weapons that the kings had used at the end of their lives; it also included the weaker weapons that they had used in their youth.

The royal children were able to enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings, and if they were lucky, they could earn the approval of some of the weapons. They could then take the weapons out of the Grave and use the weapons as their own.

But to enter that place, the royal children had to endure a test. Bai Wei had repeatedly failed the test, and so, she had never been able to gain access to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.
