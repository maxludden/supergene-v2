<h2>Holy Garden</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2932</h3>

<p>Moon Shadow God wanted to retreat into the darkness. Han Sen
realized she was very nimble, but her moving distance with each
evasion was very short. It was like she hadn’t moved at all.</p>
<p>The radius of the time area was very small. Unless the enemy was
at a close distance, it was very difficult to restrict and restrain
the movements of an opponent.</p>
<p>Earlier, Moon Shadow God thought Han Sen would be killed by the
death angel. There was also a bai sema to keep them apart. That was
why she stood so close to Han Sen. Only the bai sema kept them
apart. She wanted to watch Han Sen get killed at close range.</p>
<p>But Bao’er had turned into death angel. After hitting the death
angel, the bai sema broke. Moon Shadow God was exposed and directly
in front of Han Sen. Time area was able to touch Moon Shadow
God.</p>
<p>Moon Shadow God could not move by much, but Han Sen’s knife air
hit Moon Shadow God like it was hitting a shadow. It went right
through her image. He was unable to damage her.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed a few times, but it was the same result each
time. He was not able to touch Moon Shadow God’s body. Moon Shadow
God coldly laughed and said, “Time area is such a strong power. How
long are you going to last? When the time area disappears, it will
be time for me to avenge the death of my son.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid you will never have that chance,” Han Sen coldly
replied. He put the stone lantern in front of him and brought out
the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. He activated Medusa’s Gaze.</p>
<p>Two weird lights went through the flame, which was dyed white.
When the Gaze went toward Moon Shadow God, she was trapped by the
time area. She was unable to move. She had to generate Moon Shadow
power to fight it.</p>
<p>Medusa’s Gaze, which had been boosted by the fire, froze Moon
Shadow God’s body. It made her freeze in the air.</p>
<p>Medusa’s Gaze was a true god weapon, and it was reinforced by
the lantern. Even a true god would not be able to block it. She was
frozen. She was like a dead person.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored Moon Shadow God. He looked at Bao’er, who was
still fighting the death angel. He noticed Bao’er had an advantage
on the enemy, and she was able to keep suppressing the death
angel.</p>
<p>When the power and geno arts were in the same situation,
Bao’er’s power and geno arts had the Han family legacy. Her timing
and understanding of combat were impeccable. At the very least, it
far exceeded the death angel. She was beating the death angel,
which had the same level of power as her.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Bao’er was slashing on the death angel’s chest. She cut open its
chest armor. Han Sen noticed that the death angel’s armor did not
show flesh beyond. There was only white light.</p>
<p>“It really isn’t a living thing,” Han Sen complimentarily said.
“Everything Sacred Leader does is a bit beyond belief. I cannot
believe he made such a powerful machine. If he was able to make
many death angels, it would be easy for him to conquer the
world.”</p>
<p>The death angel kept getting injured, but it refused to concede.
It was like it did not know about pain or fear. It continued to
fight Bao’er.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The death angel’s head was cut off by Han Sen. It didn’t die
though. The fire from its neck continued to burn, and it was still
headed for Bao’er.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s body flashed. She slashed open the death angel’s chest
piece, revealing a white-colored crystal inside.</p>
<p>Bao’er flew right at her enemy. She grabbed hold of the crystal.
Suddenly, the white light of the death angel’s body was gone, which
led to the armor crumbling into itself.</p>
<p>“Dad.” Bao’er flew back and returned to her true self. She
looked very tired. It looked as if she had used the sunglasses too
much.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly held her. Bao’er was like a cat in Han Sen’s
arms. She looked super tired. She almost immediately fell asleep in
Han Sen’s arms.</p>
<p>Han Sen rarely saw Bao’er tired. He thought, “Using the
sunglasses is quite the drain of energy. Even Bao’er was unable to
last long.”</p>
<p>He picked up the death angel’s crystal, which was in Bao’er’s
hands. There were a lot of sides to the crystal. The shape of it
was rather oval. It was shiny on the inside, and it released a
scary power.</p>
<p>“I wonder what this thing is made of. If there are no
announcements for its killing, I presume it cannot be a xenogeneic
gene.” Han Sen did not understand what the crystal was for, so he
put it away.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to exit the area, but he suddenly thought
about Moon Shadow God. Next to the big crack was the death angel
and the entrance to the holy garden.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “I do not know what sort of place the holy
garden is. If Sacred Leader wanted the death angel to guard there,
that means there must be something important worth guarding. If the
death angel that guards the door is dead, maybe I should go into
the garden and see what is there. Perhaps I will find
something.”</p>
<p>He had entered Sacred to find Littleflower. He also wanted to
learn more about Sacred. This was a very important place, so he had
to explore it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the stone lantern. He shone its light below
the big crack. It was very dark. There did not seem to be a bottom.
It was unknown how deep it was.</p>
<p>Han Sen held the stone lantern and carefully entered the crack.
After he flew down for a short amount of time, he was able to
confirm that there was no danger. He then allowed the big goldfish
and little goldfish to fly in.</p>
<p>Han Sen held the still-sleeping Bao’er as he descended atop the
big goldfish’s back. It was pitch black down there, so Han Sen did
not dare allow the big goldfish to fly down too quickly. He went
down slowly. After an hour, he saw something flicker down
below.</p>
<p>“A long, bright lantern…” Han Sen stared at it for a while. He
suddenly noticed a door by the long, bright lantern.</p>
<p>He let the big goldfish go toward the long, bright lantern. The
closer he got to the long, bright lantern, the more he used its
light to highlight the stone door. The door was not as powerful as
the Sacred door. It was just a very small stone door. It looked
like the entrance to a garden.</p>
<p>After he got close enough, he saw the sign above the door, which
said, “Holy Garden.”</p>
<p>The door was open, but it looked as if what lay beyond was not
in ruins. The conditions of it were still quite good. As Han Sen
stood in front of the door, he could see the view beyond it.</p>
<p>He saw the holy garden had many long, bright lanterns there.
They lit up the entire place. When Han Sen had been above, he had
not seen any lights.</p>
<p>The holy garden had a pavilion and some buildings. There were
fake mountains, flowers, and grass. It looked very elegant. The
combat had not reached and destroyed that place. Its condition was
remarkably fine.</p>
<p>When Han Sen looked at one of the pavilions, his expression
changed. Someone was sitting in the pavilion.</p>
