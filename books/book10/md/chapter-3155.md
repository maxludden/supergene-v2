“Teacher Jia, what do you think of my sword skills?” After Qin Bai finished his performance with Wavy Sword Skill, Jia Shi Zhen looked surprised. She couldn’t believe what she had just witnessed. Qin Bai suddenly exploded with confidence. He looked at Jia Shi Zhen with confidence.

Usually, he never dared to talk to Jia Shi Zhen like that. Now, he was cocky. He did not have the fear he usually harbored.

“Mister, your Wavy Sword Skills are very good,” Jia Shi Zhen said with a nod. “If you combined with the nine-wave fish, you could conduct a miraculous performance.”

She was very surprised, so she asked, “How did Mister Crown Prince practice in the past two days? You have got the Wavy Sword Mind. You are a genius.”

When Qin Bai heard that, his cockiness was amplified by a few more levels. He did not want to tell her Bao’er tortured him to learn it. He made it sound better. “You wanted me to learn sword skills, but I did not know where to begin. So, I asked Han Sen for help. He allowed his daughter to practice with me and help train the Wavy Sword Skill. During the past two days, I have been practicing sword skills. If you think I’m doing alright, then I guess I succeeded.”

Qin Bai was a person who could just heal the sky and forget the pain. He thought Han Sen had done well. Even Teacher Jia was complimenting him. He never thought something like this could ever happen, so he mentioned Han Sen for him to earn some credit. “In a critical moment, Han Sen is the most helpful. If it was not for him, Teacher Jia would not be complimenting me.” Qin Bai was overjoyed.

Jia Shi Zhen frowned. She looked at Bao’er and thought, “This little girl is only four or five years old. How could the crown prince learn a sword mind by practicing with her? I do not believe this one bit!”

She did not believe it, but Qin Bai did learn a sword mind in two days. If he had not practiced, then it would not explain his achievement.

“It looks like many myths cannot be trusted. This Han Sen might not be as useless as I first suspected.” Jia Shi Zhen looked at Han Sen again. She now put everything on Han Sen. After all, Han Sen had killed Steel Scene. If there was someone who was able to teach Qin Bai a sword mind, it would have had to be Han Sen.

“Do you know the sword?” Jia Shi Zhen spoke to him with a different tone of voice.

“I know a bit, but I am not very good.” Han Sen was being very honest.

Han Sen’s sword and mind skills were not as good as Six Paths King. He was not as good as Lone Bamboo either. They were the real swordsmen. Han Sen did not put much effort into learning the sword skills.

Words like that going into Jia Shi Zhen’s ears seemed wretched. To be able to teach Qin Bai a sword mind was an extraordinarily difficult thing.

“No worries. If you do know a few sword skills, why don’t we at least compare sword skills?” Jia Shi Zhen really wanted to give it a go. She wanted to know what skills Han Sen had.

If he was someone good, then it was fine for Qin Bai to spend more time hanging out with him. If he had used some sort of trick to let Qin Bai learn a sword mind, she could not let Qin Bai hang out with him.

“The knife and the sword do not have eyes,” Han Sen said. “I am afraid hurting each other is bad.”

“That’s fine,” Jia Shi Zhen said with a frown. “You and I can compare sword skills. We don’t have to use gene-race power.”

By saying “hurting each other is bad,” Han Sen meant it would be bad to hurt her.

Jia Shi Zhen was determined. She did not want to accept his answer.

“If the teacher really wants this, then I have no choice but to comply.”

Jia Shi Zhen did not speak. She picked up two swords and threw one to Han Sen. She held one in her hands. When she waved her sword, it was the beginning of Wavy Sword Skill. It was called Calm and Calm.

Han Sen watched her perform Calm and Calm. He knew precisely what she meant. Jia Shi Zhen was going to test out his Wavy Sword Skill.

Wavy Sword Skill was not a very powerful sword skill. Skills in this world were not as great as the ones in the geno universe.

They depended on the outside power too much. It made their own powers possess extraordinary flaws. Aside from some powerful elites, no one could do them both well.

Sen already had skills that were similar to that. After he saw Qin Bai’s performance, he was already familiar with Wavy Sword Skill. He used the Calm and Calm beginner’s skill.

When Jia Shi Zhen watched Han Sen perform the same skill, she frowned. She used Calm and Calm as a beginning skill because she wanted Han Sen to strike first.

Han Sen did the same thing as her, which meant he wanted her to go first.

She was a teacher of the Qin Kingdom, and she was widely renowned for her sword skills. Han Sen’s behavior suggested he was underestimating her. Jia Shi Zhen did not mind that. She readied herself to attack Han Sen first. When it came to the point where she needed to unleash a strike, she wasn’t sure where to begin.

Han Sen just stood where he was, using the Calm and Calm skill she was very good at. When Han Sen used the skill, it looked fairly average. Yet, when she wanted to attack, she could not discern a single flaw in his performance.

When she couldn’t find a flaw, it gave Jia Shi Zhen the feeling of being in a crisis. It was as if she’d receive a deadly counterattack if she dared try to strike. If that happened, the next strike would determine life and death.

Jia Shi Zhen stopped her actions. She looked very serious. She looked at Han Sen’s sword skill, wanting to find a breaking point.

Try as she might, Jia Shi Zhen could not help herself from thinking about how incredibly weird Han Sen’s wonderful performance of the sword skill was. It was like an endless sea full of danger. It looked like a calm sea, but under the water, many beasts lurked in wait.

Jia Shi Zhen’s forehead started to produce sweat. She did not dare move. If she moved, she was afraid she would be the recipient of a very scary counterattack.

She never thought Calm and Calm, which was not a very powerful skill, could produce such a scary mind and atmosphere.

Jia Shi Zhen thought Han Sen was a mysterious individual. She thought the sword skill he used was like an endless sea with many scary tricks and things hiding beneath the waves.

Jia Shi Zhen felt like she could not attack. She felt as if she was a lone human facing an endless sea. The power made her feel small and insignificant.

If she was able to use a gene race, she could have used its special powers to fight back. Unfortunately, this was a fight based purely on their sword skills. It made Jia Shi Zhen’s entire body develop a sweat. Her clothes were wet. She was unable to move. If she moved, it felt like Han Sen would cast a deadly skill and kill her.

“Who is this Han Sen? How can his sword skills be so scary? It was just a very normal skill, yet he has made it so scary. It is no wonder he can teach Qin Bai a sword mind.” Jia Shi Zhen’s impression of Han Sen had radically shifted.

Jia Shi Zhen did not believe someone who had such good sword skills and mind was an evil influencer like a dog.
