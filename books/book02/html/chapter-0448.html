      The fat squad leader became slightly pale. There had been many great
      soldiers who had tried the device and failed, so Wang Hou was clearly
      bringing the cookhouse up to set them up. However, there was no way the
      fat squad leader could argue with that.
    </p>

    <p>
      After hearing Wang Hou’s words, Chen Shoushan looked at the fat squad
      leader and said with a smile, &#8220;That is right. Luo, you are having a
      lot of fun just now, so it’s time for you to move around. I think you have
      a great team, so you will definitely do well.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, captain.&#8221; The fat squad leader stood up and saluted,
      cursing Wang Hou inwardly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although everyone in the cookhouse was an evolver with high ranks, they
      were not the best fighters, because that’s not what they did.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were only there to see other people train but did not expect to be
      set up by Wang Hou.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the fat squad leader wanted to go himself, the rule regulated
      that no team leads shall participate. In addition, with his round figure,
      he would probably lose even worse if he were to participate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fat squad leader looked to his team members and received pleading
      looks, meaning they were not confident at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fatty, isn’t there a new recruit in your cookhouse? Let him make an
      appearance. It doesn’t matter what the result is. We just want to meet
      him.&#8221; As the fat squad leader was hesitating whom to pick, Wang Hou
      spoke again.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that day, Wang Hou looked through Han Sen’s profile. He did not see
      anything special about Han Sen. The greatest strength about the sky was
      probably the fact that he graduated with the rank of major.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, that rank was nothing special on Daphne. Many soldiers had that
      rank and they were all more experienced than this new recruit, since a new
      recruit was unlikely to be assigned to this post.
    </p>

    <p>
      A mission like this required veterans. For Han Sen, who had just graduated
      from the military school, it was abnormal for him to be assigned to this
      place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Hou looked into Han Sen’s background a bit further and found he
      graduated from the same school as Ji Yanran. The two must have known each
      other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naturally, Han Sen was counted as Ji Yanran’s fervent by Wang Hou. He
      wondered how strong a fighter Han Sen was. Wang Hou had always thought he
      should take every chance to know his enemy better.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fat squad leader frowned and wanted to say something. However, Han Sen
      said calmly, &#8220;It’s okay. I can try. I want to anyway.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay.&#8221; The fat squad leader did not stop Han Sen. After all,
      this was not a real drill. Since no one had succeeded, it was simply
      normal for Han Sen to fail as well. And worst case he would get shocked,
      which was nothing to a soldier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen got up, shot a glance at Wang Hou, and entered the training field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Daphne only had one warframe department, it was an advanced
      department comprised of fifteen warframe soldiers, who were all carefully
      selected veterans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Basically, except for the cookhouse, every other department was elite
      units. For example, the warship crew had a lot of groups such as the
      repair group and others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen entered the training field, and the gravity trainer was turned up.
      He suddenly felt a lot more burden.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone’s eyes were suddenly on Han Sen. Although they all knew this new
      recruit would fail, it was fun to predict when he would fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to Wang Hou, some other people were also observing Han Sen
      with scrutiny.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran did not manage to hide the fact that she was the one who got Han
      Sen on the warship from Chen Shoushan. The fact that Chen Shoushan was
      helping Wang Hou get Han Sen up the stage was because he was also
      wondering what Han Sen could do to make Ji Yanran spend so much effort.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen took a deep breath and walked to the first metal wall.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had asked Ji Yanran about Wang Hou in private, because as
      sensitive as he was, he could feel the hostility Wang Hou held against
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was abnormal. Han Sen was merely a new recruit and had not offended
      Wang Hou ever. He had not even met Wang Hou before. Han Sen did not feel
      that the hostility simply came from the bump.
    </p>

    <p>What Ji Yanran told Han Sen corroborated Han Sen’s assumption.</p>

    <p>
      Wang Hou was connected to the expert panel. Although he was the head of
      the warframe department, he was elected because of the suggestion of the
      expert panel. Wang Hou himself had selected all the soldiers in his
      department. It was fair to say that the warframe department worked for the
      expert panel.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were many scholars and experts pissed at Ji Yanran, which was a
      known fact. After all, Ji Yanran had just become an evolver. Although she
      came from a prominent family, that did not help the fieldwork, which was
      why the expert panel did not like her very much.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the old Captain whom Ji Yanran had replaced was very close to
      the expert panel, so that had also added to the prejudice the expert panel
      held against Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of Ji Yanran’s family, no one dared to say anything. However, if
      Ji Yanran herself made some serious mistakes, it would be natural for her
      to be removed from Daphne.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Han Sen did not want any drama, and only want to finish his
      tasks while improving himself. However, since he was here because of Ji
      Yanran, many people would know that. If he acted poorly, Ji Yanran would
      be humiliated.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not an option for his girlfriend to be humiliated. Not just that,
      he needed to make her proud. Otherwise, he would not call himself her
      boyfriend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew very well what Wang Hou was trying to do, but he did not
      care.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You want to watch, I’ll let you watch.&#8221; Han Sen made the
      first step on the metal wall, dashing on the white zone which was only 1
      foot wide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was very fast, unlike the previous soldiers who were trying to
      control their speed so that they had more time to observe and decide how
      to go ahead. Han Sen did the opposite thing. He was fast from the
      beginning, going forward on the randomly laid metal walls.
    </p>

    <p>
      A newbie is just a newbie. Going like this, he would fall in seconds. Many
      people were thinking in their head.
    </p>

    <p>
      Watching Han Sen going as fast as this, Wang Hou could not help but feel
      surprised, wondering if Han Sen was a true idiot or trying to fall as fast
      as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even Chen Shoushan frowned slightly. If this was all he could do, it would
      be a waste of Ji Yanran’s energy. Chen Shoushan was quite disappointed.
