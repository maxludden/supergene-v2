  “Destroyer Wolf got away through a space crack. What clue do you think you can find here?” Elysian Moon said, frowning.

“Let’s just look around. Perhaps we can find some clues,” Han Sen said as he walked.

“Then you can try your luck here. We don’t think we’d find anything,” Elysian Moon said while pointing in another direction.

“There nothing to find here. We can secretly follow the groups from Sacred and Outer Sky. Better that than wasting our time here,” said Gu Qingcheng.

“Then let’s separate into two teams. You can follow them, and I’ll keep looking here.” Han Sen wasn’t in a rush.

There were too many powerful beings from Sacred and Outer Sky, and everyone was on high alert, so Han Sen’s group would be easily spotted. Han Sen planned to walk around to check for any remaining molecules. He wanted to see what kind of creatures were with the Destroyer Wolf.

“Okay. I’ll leave you some marks to indicate where we’ve gone.” Elysian Moon was already walking away, so Gu Qingcheng left Han Sen a mark and hurried after her.

Xu Mi wanted to follow them as well, but since Han Sen was not going, he had to follow Han Sen.

“Teacher, that Destroyer Wolf has fled through the space fault. Why are we still looking for clues here? We’d better follow Goddess’s group. There’ll be some interesting things happening later,” Xu Mi said. He didn’t think he’d be able to seize the egg; he just wanted to watch those powerful beings fight each other.

Han Sen smiled and said, “I’ll keep searching here. You can follow those two if you really want to go.”

Xu Mi thought for a minute and said, “I’d rather follow you, teacher,”

Han Sen didn’t say anything more. Instead, he followed the molecules along the lake. There were only a few molecules left. It had been quite a long time, so there were only some scent molecules left, and they were not continuous. It would take Han Sen a long while to follow such a faint trail.

Xu Mi saw Han Sen walk around the lake, looking around everywhere. He walked slowly, but he didn’t know what Han Sen was looking at. He could only follow behind Han Sen.

Han Sen walked around most of the lake, and at some point, the trail disappeared. He walked forward, but he couldn’t find any more molecules.

“Weird. Where are they?” Han Sen walked back to the last spot he had seen the molecules, and he observed the place carefully.



It was very close to the lake shore, and there were some black water stains at the shoreline.

“Does this lake rise at some point? Did the creature that left the scent enter the lake? Why did he walk around for so long instead of entering the lake immediately? Is there something special in this location?” Han Sen frowned as he thought.

He observed the lake, but he couldn’t see anything special. The lake here was exactly like other areas of Rolling Dragon Lake. It was dark like ink, and he couldn’t see anything inside.

The surface of the water was peaceful as well, and there were no ripples. Han Sen couldn’t find any living beings in the lake using his Dongxuan Aura.

“What are you looking at, teacher?” Xu Mi stood beside Han Sen and looked at the lake, but he couldn’t see anything either.

“I’m looking for clues,” Han Sen said with a smile.

“Clues? What clues? I can’t see anything.” Xu Mi was curious. He observed the lake again, but he still couldn’t see anything there.

“What would you need me for if you could see through everything?” Han Sen said condescendingly.

Xu Mi said, “No wonder you’re a teacher. I can’t even compare with you. Please, teacher, teach me something. What kind of clues are there in this lake?”

“My disciple, you will only truly learn if you find the answers yourself. You have to use your brain more and think it through. That’s how you actually learn things.” Han Sen pointed at the lake and said, “Just observe here. I’ll go to other areas to see if I can find other clues.”

“Okay, teacher. I won’t let you down.” Xu Mi kept staring at the lake, trying to find the clues his teacher alluded to.

Han Sen kept walking around the lake, carrying Bao’er. He walked all the way around the lake, and then he began walking around in the forest nearby, hoping to find the scent molecules again.

Xu Mi gazed at the lake for a long time, but he still couldn’t find any clues.

“Teacher is indeed wise and mysterious, and I’m not at the same level that he is. What did teacher find here?” Xu Mi gazed at the lake more carefully.

Actually, Han Sen didn’t find any clues himself. He just felt that it wasn’t a coincidence that he found some scent molecules there, so he asked Xu Mi to stay there to see whether he could find anything.

If Han Sen was correct, the creature must have dived back into the lake when the tides rose in Rolling Dragon Lake. Han Sen then decided to walk around Rolling Dragon Lake and come back when the tides rose again. Perhaps he could find something after that.

Han Sen walked around the nearby forest for a while, and he didn’t find the trail he was looking for, but he did find a familiar scent.

“Ghost Eye? Why is it here? It’s so weak. Is it being suicidal?” Han Sen checked it carefully, and he found some other molecule traces that resembled those of Ghost Eye. There were two other types of molecules, but he wasn’t sure which creatures they belonged to, and he couldn’t tell the power of those creatures either.

He toured the forest, and he felt several powerful forces sweeping across the sky, but none of them stayed nearby. After a short while, they were all gone.

He didn’t find anything new, and it was getting darker. Han Sen went toward Rolling Dragon Lake.

“Teacher, I’ve found something!” Han Sen was a bit stunned. He only asked Xu Mi to stay there on the off-chance that something happened, but he hadn’t expected the spirit to make a discovery.

Xu Mi pointed at the place where Han Sen asked him to stay and watch. The place where Han Sen and Xu Mi stood before was already covered by the black lake water, but there wasn’t anything special there.

However, after the lakewater rose, a small section of lakewater looked different. In that one place close to the shore, the lake water that was originally black became transparent like the water in a normal lake.

However, it was already dark, and it was only a tiny area. If they didn’t look at it carefully, they wouldn’t have noticed the clear water at all.

“Teacher, you indeed have great acumen. I wasn’t able to see anything special before, but I only saw the difference of that part of the lake after it got dark.” Xu Mi looked at Han Sen in awe.
