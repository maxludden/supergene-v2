    <p>
      The fog lay heavy, and Han Sen made sure to summon his most useful beast
      souls before entering the mist. He pierced into the clouds without
      hindrance, but as he entered, a frightful feeling crept along his spine
      and chilled him to the bone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw a fire-wreathed shadow approach from his side. If he
      wasn&#8217;t wearing his devil-eye mask, he wouldn&#8217;t have caught its
      coming.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The little angel came over to cover him, and her greatsword collided with
      something in the fog. She was knocked back a bit, but before anything else
      could happen, their phantom assailant retreated into the deeper recesses
      of the mist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Han Sen could continue his journey through the fog, the shadow came
      at them again from another side. It was fortunate Han Sen was able to
      follow it as it neared, and command the little angel to respond
      appropriately.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen commanded her to deflect the shadow&#8217;s incoming attack,
      Han Sen took advantage of the window of opportunity and flew faster
      through the fog towards the shelter. He knew that the shelter&#8217;s
      walls were only a hundred meters away, but it now felt as if he had
      traveled several hundred meters. And still, he had yet to see the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; The wretched realization that this was no ordinary
      fog dawned on Han Sen. He wanted to leave its stuffy-clutch, but it was
      too late. Despite flying back a few hundred meters again, in the direction
      he had come, he was unable to exit. He wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was at least glad he was in possession of the devil-eye mask,
      so he could watch any creature that lurked inside the mist. It did well to
      keep him alert and out of danger.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It seems as if there is only one super creature hiding out here in
      the mist with me. If the others don&#8217;t come near, then perhaps
      I&#8217;ll be able to kill it one-on-one,&#8221; Han Sen thought to
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not believe whatever super creature lurked around him would pose
      too much danger, and even without his devil-eye mask, he could use his
      dongxuan aura to sense its presence and see it coming.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only problem was the need to deal with it quickly. If he didn&#8217;t
      take care of it soon, it was only a matter of time before the big monster
      down below would beat itself to death against the doors. If that happened,
      Han Sen would have one less ally on the field.
    </p>

    <p>
      The evil-eye mask could only enable Han Sen to watch the shadow of the
      creature. It was a lifeforce, one that seemed to have been wrapped in
      flames. He couldn&#8217;t quite see what sort of super creature it was.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel could not see very well in the mist, and she had to rely
      on the commands of her master for when and where to react.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quietly drew his peacock crossbow and loaded it with Z-steel
      bolts. He propped it up, ready for the creature&#8217;s re-emergence.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The little angel used her greatsword to knock away an incoming shadow. Han
      Sen did not do anything yet, and he just patiently watched it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flaming shadow failed in its attempts to attack a few times, and it
      appeared to be frustrated. So, it gave up trying to strike them, sunk into
      the mist, and watched the two in return.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pretended as if he could not see it, rolling his head in a number
      of different directions to feign inattention. But in truth, aside from the
      creature, he really could not see anything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he was outside, he had managed to catch the presence of other super
      creatures by spotting their lifeforces. But now, inside the mist, this
      singular lifeforce was the only anomaly he could make out.
    </p>

    <p>
      After observing for a while, the flame began to believe Han Sen and the
      little angel had truly lost their target. It sailed through the fog behind
      Han Sen, and slowly approached.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued looking left and right, as if it he had no idea where it
      was coming from. But with the dongxuan aura that he cast a while ago, he
      was able to keep an eye on its every slight movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flaming shadow came within ten meters of Han Sen when it suddenly
      became enraged, and it launched itself towards the mist&#8217;s intruder.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment the flame got close to Han Sen, he quickly turned around and
      used his Flaming Rex Spike to block the attack while his left-hand fired
      the peacock crossbow repeatedly. Consecutively, he fired eight of the
      Z-steel bolts towards the foe.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen and the rex spike were rocked away upon the collision, which
      negatively affected his accuracy. Still, he heard a foreign noise in the
      mist sound three times. Three of the eight bolts had found their target.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, little angel flew to the shadow&#8217;s head and brought
      down the greatsword upon it with all her might.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Roar!&#8221; The flaming shadow screamed in agony, seemingly
      injured by the bolts. Frantically, it tried to scramble back into the
      cover of the mist.
    </p>

    <p>
      But under the all-seeing gaze of the devil-eye mask, Han Sen was able to
      observe its every move. With the little angel by his side, he took off
      after the misty-menace.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature had been well-and-truly fooled by Han Sen, and now, the
      little angel instantly caught up with the monster. She swung her sword
      like a loon and brought an end to the fleeing monster&#8217;s escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen fired the peacock crossbow again, emptying the other six bolts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The timing could not have been more perfect, as the creature had just
      exhausted all its strength in avoiding the brutal cleaves of the little
      angel&#8217;s greatsword.
    </p>

    <p>
      More moans rumbled out across the fog, as four of the bolts found their
      target. The creature trembled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like a sudden streak of light, the little angel shot right past the
      creature. As she did so, a head launched into the sky, trailing blood.
      Before the choking mist could be dyed red, it began to disappear with the
      felling of its master.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Mirage-Gas Freak Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. The
        Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You May Harvest Its Life Geno
        Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno
        Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The mist faded, and Han Sen&#8217;s prior vision of the shelter&#8217;s
      walls and gate returned to him. It was only ten meters away now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Mirage-Gas Freak that the little angel had slain began to fade away.
      It was strange, like a cat. The head had been lopped off, and that too
      began to melt away with the body.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      A Life Geno essence, one that looked like an orb of solid mist, fell to
      the ground. Han Sen made sure to pick it up, and after doing so, flew to
      the back of the gate that had previously barred their passage. Then, he
      lifted and removed the bolt that prevented its opening. After doing so, he
      made sure to make a quick escape backwards.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The purple-door was smashed open by the big monster. With a loud roar, it
      marched inside without hesitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the shelter was a large and beautiful palace, but strangely, it now
      seemed devoid of creatures or spirits. The place seemed empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the mirage cloud totally disappeared, Han Sen&#8217;s vision became
      clearer. He couldn&#8217;t see any creatures. Even the small monster that
      had been captured by the black tiger was totally gone, and not even its
      screams could be heard anymore.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The big monster quickly arrived before the grand palace, and at its tall
      doors, it again tried to open them by throwing its weight. It wanted to
      see with its own eyes whether or not the little monster was inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its strike did not collapse the palace, but as Han Sen watched, he saw the
      flash of a sword. Suddenly, a huge, bloody gash had been drawn deep into
      the big monster&#8217;s hardy scales.
