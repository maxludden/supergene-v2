  “What did you do to me?” Xius asked simply. She didn’t sound frightened.

“Nothing. It’s just a little insurance to guarantee that we have a jovial co-operation,” Han Sen said with a smile.

“There is no grudge between you and me! When you were being hunted by Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying, I did not attack you once. Why are you doing this?” Xius asked calmly.

“I don’t mean to trouble you. As I said, I only wish to co-operate with you. If you take me away from Return Ruin Sea, I will take the blight off of you,” Han Sen said reassuringly.

“What did you do to me?” Xius asked again.

Han Sen laughed. Some things were better left unsaid. Fear was something no one was immune to.

“Would you believe me if I told you that your life was in my hands?” Han Sen asked.

“Of course,” Xius said with certainty.

“So I don’t need to say anything. If I want to get out alive, I cannot kill you. Neither can I hurt you. However, if you do anything to expose my presence here, you can watch yourself die,” Han Sen said.

You think I wouldn’t take a chance?” Xius looked at Han Sen impassively.

Han Sen smiled. He looked into her pretty eyes softly.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang. A lady’s voice sounded from the other side. “Lady Xius, are you resting? Brother Fifteen is here, and he wishes to see you.”

“Coming.” Xius looked at Han Sen, then headed for the door.

Instead of stopping her, Han Sen shapeshifted back into the Stone Cow.

When Xius saw that Han Sen wasn’t stopping her, her face looked glum. It was only for a moment, though. Her expression cleared, and she opened the door to find Dragon Nineteen standing on the other side.

“Where is Fifteen?” Xius asked with a smile.

“Brother Fifteen is in the control room. Something has happened, so please go there,” Dragon Nineteen said, looking awkward.

“Okay,” Xius answered. She closed the door slowly behind her, looking at Han Sen the Stone Cow as she did.

Xius closed the door without prompting the smallest reaction from Han Sen. He had gone to sleep, and it made her frown. If Han Sen had looked uncomfortable and nervous, it would mean that he was not confident in what he had put upon her.

The fact that he showed no reaction or desire to follow her showed that he was confident she had no hope of escaping his wrath.

Xius kept checking her body up and down. The power had disappeared into her heart, and it was as if nothing had happened in the first place.

There were only two possibilities that explained this. Firstly, this entire scheme was just a bluff. The other possibility was that Han Sen was simply too strong for her to comprehend.

She wasn’t sure what to make of the entire situation. Being unable to determine what was going on actually made her worry a touch.

Han Sen stayed in Xius’ room with a bit of worry himself. Han Sen did not know what effect the crystal blood would have on her. But all he could do was stay where he was. He had to stay put and not show his worry. If he showed a lack of confidence, Xius would doubt him. That would be bad.

“I’ve made my gamble. Let’s see if she can remove the crystal blood inside of her.” As he waited in the room, Han Sen thought about what he might do if she sold him out.

Time passed, and Han Sen had been left in the room for two hours before the door opened again. Han Sen didn’t look up. His Dongxuan Aura was enough to tell him that Xius had returned to the room alone.

“Fine, you win. How do we co-operate?” Xius walked over to the bed and sat on it. She smiled at Han Sen.

“It’s simple. You take me away from here, and I will remove the effects I have stricken you with.” Han Sen then went on to say, “But I am telling you right now that my appearance as a Stone Cow can only last another two days. You have two days to take me away from here. If you don’t, then you and I must suffer together.”

“But this deal is not fair! How can I be certain that you’ll remove whatever it is you’ve put upon me?” Xius asked.

“I am controlled by you, too.” Han Sen pointed at the halo around his neck.

“How can a small trick like that trouble you? You killed Sharon! This is just a minor halo,” Xius said casually.

“If you don’t believe me, you can put something else onto me, and we can remove them together once we’re free. But I don’t think that is necessary. It is as you said: there is no grudge between us. If you save me, I will have no reason to upset you or the rest of the Gana,” Han Sen said.

“Sure. Let me put an effect on you. We can remove them together once we’re out of here,” Xius said.

“Okay, but you have to remove this halo. Only one effect on each of us at a time,” Han Sen said.

Xius waved her hand, and the halo around his neck broke. She slithered her snake body closer to Han Sen.

Han Sen didn’t move. Whatever she put on him, it would be removed whenever he enabled his super god spirit mode.

Xius, seeing Han Sen stand where he was without moving, sighed and thought to herself, “He is so confident. He must have cast something really powerful on me.”

With a bit of hesitation, Xius smiled at Han Sen. She put a hand on Han Sen’s face—his human face—and tilted it upward. Her hands were touching Han Sen’s jaw as she angled his head for a clear display of his neck.

“You have good skin. Even I am jealous!” Xius’ voice was magnetic. Her lips were coming in close to his neck.

Her red lips opened, and just as they were about to come into contact with his neck, two white teeth were revealed, like the fangs of a snake. They shone as she bit into the flesh of his neck.

Han Sen did not avoid it. He just stood there like nothing was happening.

Xius raised her head and pulled back. His neck had teeth marks on it, with two deeper spots where the fangs had been. “Okay, now we can discuss business.” Xius licked the blood off her lips with her tongue. She smiled at Han Sen.
