<h3>Chapter 2446</h3>

<p>“What are you doing? Step back! Don’t be rude to Brother Han,”
Fang Qing Yu shouted, his face contorted in displeasure.</p>
<p>But the other men didn’t seem willing to stop. The Destroyed
leader laughed and said, “Mister Fang, we are doing this for your
own good. Our ride, Wind Cloud Bird, was consumed by that deified
xenogeneic. Without a ship, we cannot travel through the Tianxia
System. And now that there is a ship right here, we cannot deny
that this is obviously the help of God.”</p>
<p>“If you guys try this, then you are no better than pirates,”
Fang Qing Yu said, not sounding happy at all.</p>
<p>“Haha! Mr. Fang, you are right. We are pirates. Who else do you
think would dare to escort you through a zone like the Tianxia
System?” The people swapped glances with each other and
laughed.</p>
<p>Once they were in the Tianxia System, they had been planning to
rob Fang Qing Yu and kidnap Gu Qincheng and Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>They didn’t have much luck, though. They entered the Tianxia
System, and mere minutes before they planned to execute their
sordid little scheme, they encountered a deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>“You guys…” Fang Qing Yu’s face changed. He was too furious to
say anything.</p>
<p>With that revelation, the situation made a little more sense to
Han Sen. It would have been unusual for normal mercenaries to agree
to escort Fang Qing Yu into such a dangerous place. Entering the
Tianxia System was way too risky. If someone was willing to go
there, they were most likely interstellar pirates, or they were on
the lam like Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You’re referring to us as ‘you guys’? Haven’t you heard of the
Pirate? We are true Pirates, so if you know who I am, then show
some respect. I only want money. If I don’t get it…” The Destroyed
King laughed threateningly as his sentence trailed off.</p>
<p>Hearing the man’s claim, Han Sen didn’t know what to say. The
guy was bluffing. The Pirates were a powerful faction, and there
were many of them.</p>
<p>They robbed the amazingly rich and powerful, often entering
high-race xenogeneic spaces to attack their prey. They wouldn’t
behave like these guys, stealing from the weak in such a sneaky
way.</p>
<p>Many of the pirates started to approach Han Sen. Gu Qingcheng
frowned and started to draw her sword, but Han Sen stopped her.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the pirates and smiled. “It is good that you
aren’t leaving. We need people here. We need men that are willing
to tidy, clean, and make food. If you want to stay here, you may
remain to do such things.”</p>
<p>When the pirates heard that, they laughed until their eyes
watered. The Demon man looked extra cocky, and he said, “The Rebate
and Knife Queen might be famous, but we don’t care. Plus, you are
only Knife Queen’s student. How dare you propose that we become
your deckhands!”</p>
<p>“Stop talking to him! As it is his wish, we’ll flip the offer
around and make him the one who does the washing, cleaning, and
cooking for us!” one of the pirates said.</p>
<p>They were fearless. They had seen the battleship from one end to
the other. The ship was host to Han Sen, a little girl, and a very
frightened woman.</p>
<p>Aside from them, there was only a little red bird.</p>
<p>“Let me do it,” the Demon man said with a smile. He unleashed
his area. He went over to Han Sen while saying, “Do you want to get
out, or do you want me to help you? If you want me to help, you
will…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish, Han Sen punched the man in the face.</p>
<p>“D*mn you!” The Demon man suddenly looked terrifying. He lifted
his fist and threw a punch at Han Sen that was imbued with Sky
Demon powers. Very few Demons could make use of those powers, and
the few that could were mostly of a pure Demon blood lineage.</p>
<p>The fact that the Demon could make use of Sky Demon powers
surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>But the Sky Demon powers, even at full charge, was useless
against Han Sen.</p>
<p>That Demon man was stunned when Han Sen’s fist collided with his
own. He had put all of his power into that strike, and Han Sen had
blocked it.</p>
<p>The Demon man had shock written all over his face. His entire
body stopped moving, and then a block of ice encased him.</p>
<p>The other pirates were shocked, too. The Demon man wasn’t a top
King, but his Sky Demon power was nothing to trifle with. Han Sen
had blocked that Sky Demon power and froze him in a single punch.
That surprised them all.</p>
<p>Many of the pirates pulled out their knives. Han Sen’s hands
closed into fists, and then he rushed into them. He threw punches
that wrecked each of their King areas and their powers. He froze
the pirates one by one, leaving them standing on the deck,
motionless and confused.</p>
<p>The pirates were dumbfounded. They were just a group of outlaws
who weren’t really connected to the Pirate. And they had never
witnessed a King with such impressive strength.</p>
<p>“Don’t! Stay back! If you come any closer, I’ll kill her.” The
Destroyed King had the quickest reaction. Upon seeing all his men
frozen, he stumbled back toward Bao’er and put a knife to her
neck.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already frozen all the other pirates. When he turned
to see the frightened Destroyed King holding a knife to Bao’er’s
throat, he laughed and didn’t approach.</p>
<p>The Destroyed King looked at his men in disbelief. The Demon and
two others had been Kings, but Han Sen had dealt with them as
easily as he had the Dukes. They had all been frozen by Han Sen’s
punches. The entire group only lasted a few seconds.</p>
<p>Han Sen grinned at the Destroyed King. He didn’t come any
closer.</p>
<p>“Don’t take another step. If you do, what happens then is on
you.” The Destroyed King’s heart began to pound as Han Sen gazed at
him. The Destroyed pulled Bao’er closer to himself, wanting to
retreat with her as a hostage. For now, all he wanted was to leave.
The further away he could get, the better.</p>
<p>“Uncle,” said a very young voice from the Destroyed King’s arms.
When he lowered his head, he found that it was the little girl he
was using as a hostage.</p>
<p>The little girl had a knife to her neck, but she didn’t look
scared like most little girls would, however. She smiled at him,
looking so happy. She even started to laugh.</p>
<p>“Stop laughing!” the Destroyed King shouted angrily at the
little girl, feeling insulted.</p>
<p>Before he could come up with another threat, though, the
Destroyed King’s eyes widened in surprise and terror.</p>
<p>The little red bird upon the girl’s shoulder jumped into the
air, and red flames began to spread from its flapping wings. It was
like a volcano erupting. Under the incredible heat, the Destroyed’s
King class knife suddenly melted into molten juice. But the fire in
the bird’s eyes didn’t lessen; in fact, the bird seemed to grow
even more enraged.</p>
