"Where is No. 107?" Han Sen spitted out some blood in his mouth and asked quietly.

"You will know when we get there." Ning Yue did not talk to Han Sen again and hit the road.

Ning Yue never expected to get much from Han Sen's mouth. And there was no way he would let Han Sen off the hook at this point.

Han Sen was curious about the No. 107 Ning Yue mentioned. However, the group of people did not speak about it at all. All they did was traveling. It seemed that they were in a hurry.

Han Sen understood the reason. All of them had evolved and could not stay too long in First God's Sanctuary, otherwise their bodies would not be able to take it.

Under this circumstance, Ning Yue still insisted to take him to No. 107, which made Han Sen even more curious about it.

Very soon, Han Sen's question was answered. The group of people traveled across Devil Desert on sacred-blood mounts and entered an arid mountain.

There was only a very narrow path to enter the valley. Only one man could pass at a time. A couple of men took Han Sen to enter the valley. When they approached the valley, Han Sen saw everything.

He could barely see any other creature. White rocks and sand were everywhere. In the middle of the valley, there was a giant blooming red flower that looked like a rose facing upward.

Around the flower, there were many vines and leaves covered with thorns. The vines almost covered the entire valley, making it look like a greenhouse for the flower.

Han Sen looked around. In addition to the red flower and the vines, he did not see anything else, let alone any creatures.

"Is this No. 107?" Han Sen asked, surprised.

"That's right. This is No. 107," Ning Yue answered him, to Han Sen's surprise. Ning Yue then continued, "Every time Starry Group finds a creature that is suspected to be something beyond sacred-blood creatures, we would give it a number and record it. This is No. 107."

"You mean this giant flower?" Han Sen checked out the red flower, which looked like a plant in every way. Although it was huge in size, there was no way it could be a creature.

"You will know that very soon. Enter the valley." Ning Yue asked his men to aim their arrows and weapons at Han Sen, forcing Han Sen to go inside.

"Go inside." After Liu Lin unchained Han Sen's legs, he pushed Han Sen hard.

"What is in there?" Han Sen almost lost his balance, but he did not pay Liu Lin any mind.

Ning Yue did not ask for his beast souls. Although there were a lot of vines growing in the valley, as long as he had sacred-blood wings, it would be easy for him to fly away. He could not see how the valley could trap him.

"Give me the dagger now, and you don't need to go inside," Ning Yue said calmly.

"I do not want to give you my dagger, and I don't want to go inside either," Han Sen replied.

"You can try to kill us all and run away," Ning Yue said with a smile.

Ning Yue's words made the evolvers laugh. They all pointed their weapons at Han Sen, indicating that they were could take Han Sen's life anytime.

No one believed that Han Sen could run away under the siege of fourteen evolvers.

In addition, Han Sen's upper body was chained with the special Z-steel locks on his joints. Even an evolver could not get rid of this kind of locks.

Only those strong evolvers with their fitness level around eighty could break free from the locks with their own strength.

"Young master, why do you have to kill me. If you resent me for killing your doppelg√§nger, I could pay you." Han Sen stared at Ning Yue.

"If you have just crossed me, I will never try to kill you. Unfortunately, you gained something you shouldn't have. Give me the dagger or go in the valley, your pick," Ning Yue said quietly.

"I choose to kill." Han Sen shook his body and twisted in the weirdest angle. All the locks that were on his joints fell from his body. Han Sen had been practicing Jadeskin for a long time and was better and better controlling his own body. Moving his bones and muscles, he felt the locks were completely useless on him.

After removing the locks, Han Sen quickly summoned the cursed wolf dagger and stabbed it at Ning Yue.

Ning Yue did not look surprised. He summoned a slim sword and wielded it at Han Sen. The thirteen evolvers also summoned their own weapons and started to attack Han Sen.

If Han Sen insisted to kill Ning Yue with his dagger, he would be facing thirteen weapons himself. Therefore, he had to go backward and waive his weapon at other people.

The fitness level of Han Sen was slightly weaker than the sacred-blood evolvers. Although he could increase his strength and speed using Heresy Mantra and Overload, his original fitness was not improved. When cutting by the evolvers, he would still get hurt, which was why Han Sen was still trying to dodge their attacks.

This way, however, Han Sen felt himself trapped. Even with Heresy Mantra and Overload and the cursed wolf dagger, he still found it difficult to get rid of the evolvers.

Han Sen could not even hurt an individual or damage a single weapon. Thirteen different weapons came at Han Sen continuously, leaving him at an absolute disadvantage. Han Sen had to retreat into the valley.

It was not because the thirteen evolvers were strong, but because of Ning Yue.

The sword skills of Ning Yue did not seem very impressive. Instead, it was somewhat irrational. Sometimes, the sword did not even come at Han Sen, but toward empty space.

However, it was exactly the sword skills that connected the attacks from the thirteen people together, making it into a trap which Han Sen could not run away from. Han Sen did not even have an opportunity to fight back. Although he had a sharp weapon, he had to retreat again and again.
