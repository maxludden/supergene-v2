<h3>Chapter 2873</h3>

<p>“Finally moved.” Han Sen quickly looked at the other name. He
noticed Zhang Xuandao was challenging Ancient Sacrifice God, who
was ranked sixth.</p>
<p>Ancient Sacrifice God was one of the Ancient Gods, and he was
the highest-ranked person within the Ancient Gods.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Ancient Sacrifice God fight before. He proved
himself to be an incredibly strong true god. He had a mysterious
sacrificial power that enabled him to easily defeat a true god
deified xenogeneic that challenged him.</p>
<p>Han Sen believed that with Ancient Sacrifice God’s power, his
rank could be higher.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised that Sky Palace Leader was willing to
challenge Ancient Sacrifice God. Han Sen thought he would go for a
higher-ranked person, such as Seeking Perfume Beast.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader landed in space. He looked like holy winds and
bones. People who did not know him would have thought he was like
some kind of god fairy.</p>
<p>Zhang Xuandao looked at Ancient Sacrifice God coldly and said,
“Ancient Sacrifice God, it is time we finished this.”</p>
<p>Ancient Sacrifice God was like a green giant. A bronze tripod
was in his hands. He coldly looked at Zhang Xuandao. Suddenly, the
bronze tripod in his hands had a strange glow. All the stars in the
sky were falling. A river of stars descended. It was all going
toward the bronze tripod. It was like the whole universe was being
sucked into the bronze tripod.</p>
<p>Han Sen once watched Ancient Sacrifice God battle a true god
xenogeneic. It was sucked into the bronze tripod and was unable to
fight back.</p>
<p>Zhang Xuandao was in space. He let the stars fall and the suns
break. He let them all go past his body while he did not move an
inch. It was like the bronze tripod power did not exist. “Ancient
Sacrifice God, use all the powers you can. Do not leave any
regrets.” Zhang Xuandao was like a god standing between the sky and
the ground. His power was like everything in the world was nothing.
Ancient Sacrifice God was angry, so he roared. The bronze tripod
was glowing with light. The markings on the tripod lit up. Some of
the markings were like a bird, whereas others were like a
beast.</p>
<p>The suns, moons, stars, birds, beasts, fish, flowers, grass,
trees, wood… All the substances were becoming abstract symbols on
the tripod. As those symbols brightened, the entire universe seemed
to have some sort of power that went toward the bronze tripod. It
made the power of the bronze tripod stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>“It can use the power of the universe. Ancient Sacrifice God is
so scary.” Han Sen was so scared.</p>
<p>God looked at Ancient Sacrifice God with keen interest. “Ancient
Gods are born deifieds. Their talents are the highest out of the
high races, but their growth is the least out of all races. In
history, they are the oldest race. They are all born deified. Yet
today, they are still like this. Nothing has improved much.”</p>
<p>“They are already true god class,” Han Sen said. “How many more
breakthroughs do you think they can achieve? Getting into the gene
god hall?”</p>
<p>God shook his head. He did not explain. He went on to say, “You
cannot blame the Ancient Gods. Other creatures have countless steps
to climb, whereas they only have two or three steps. It is normal
for them to ascend so slowly.”</p>
<p>The bronze tripod was buffed by everything in the universe. The
power was becoming scarier. Ancient Sacrifice God was roaring. He
raised the tripod in his hands. The tripod made some roaring sounds
like a dragon or a tiger. At the same time, it released a scary
light. It became a beam of light firing into the sky.</p>
<p>Inside the beam of light, Han Sen saw a weird shadow flashing.
It was like a God Spirit grabbing Sky Palace Leader in space.</p>
<p>That shadow was very strong. It was the strongest Han Sen had
ever seen in a god fight before. Even when Dragon One used his
dragon race weapon, the Blood Dragon Ruler’s, which was seven true
gods combined into one mode, it was not as scary as this beam of
light in the shadow.</p>
<p>The light shadow gave Han Sen the feeling of a God Spirit that
could destroy the world. It had an incredible power that was
terrifying. Even with Han Sen’s power and willpower, it made him
feel very small.</p>
<p>“Many years have passed, yet you still only use this trick.” Sky
Palace Leader looked at the light shadow with disdain.</p>
<p>A finger moved. A light spell was cast. It latched onto the
giant palm from the shadow.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>The light shadow touched the light spell. The palm went back. It
made a silent roar as if something was electrified.</p>
<p>It was not over yet. The light spell stuck to the light shadow’s
palm. The light grew brighter. It suppressed the light shadow and
pillar of light.</p>
<p>When the light spell power became stronger, the holy power
suppressed the beam of light and light shadow. It forced them back
into the bronze tripod. No matter how that light shadow roared, he
still could not stop it.</p>
<p>“Very powerful Sky spell, and Very power Sky leader.” Han Sen
could not help but compliment him.” Sky Palace’s original gene
killing spell was something Han Sen had seen before. How Sky Palace
Leader used it surprised him. Of course, the main part of it was
the fact that Sky Palace Leader was too strong. The power he
commanded was as high as a true god could be. In the next second,
the light spell landed on the tripod. No matter how much power
Ancient Sacrifice God used, it was like the bronze tripod had been
suppressed by a mountain. He could not release any power. As the
light spell grew stronger, the bronze tripod became more
suppressed. Ancient Sacrifice God seemed incapable of moving the
bronze tripod. His arms were starting to bend.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Ancient Sacrifice God madly roared, but he could not
stop the tripod from failing. In the end, the bronze tripod fell
out of his hands and flew into space.</p>
<p>Zhang Xuandao waved his sleeves and put the bronze tripod in
them. He coldly said, “Sacrifice God Bronze can lend me this for a
thousand years as interest.”</p>
<p>Ancient Sacrifice God was furious. His bronze body shone
brightly, making his seem like a glowing sky giant. He ripped
through space toward Zhang Xuandao. Zhang Xuandao waved his
sleeves. Ancient Sacrifice God’s bronze body, which looked like it
could support the sky and ground, was hit into space. He fell into
a rip in space and disappeared. “A thousand years later, you may
come and collect your sacrifice bronze tripod from Sky Palace.”
After Sky Palace Leader said that, he turned around. All the
creatures were in immense shock. “He is so powerful,” Han Sen
thought. He had to admit that Sky Palace Leader had what it took to
be cool. His powers and method were similar to Very High
Leader.</p>
<p>Even God complimented him. “Very good Sky Zhang Xuandao!” The
next challenge was boring because of Zhang Xuandao’s match. All the
creatures were still talking about the fight between Zhang Xuandao
and Ancient Sacrifice God. People thought that if the challenges
were not one-chance affairs, Zhang Xuandao’s rank could have been
higher. He might have even replaced Very High Leader to become
second. More interesting fights occurred over the next few days,
but none were as good as Zhang Xuandao’s fight. They were nothing
worth focusing on. Seeing that there was only one day of challenges
left, Han Sen finally used his challenge. His target was going to
be Maha God Elephant.</p>
