	<p>Han Sen’s body could not move, and despite the fact that he still had control over his senses, he couldn’t tell
		what element the green light was. He wasn’t in a rush, though. The xenogeneic’s power was amazing, but at the
		end of the day, it was only a Viscount. Han Sen had Marquise armor on, and that meant he had no reason to be
		afraid.</p>

	<p>Plus, he had his super king spirit body to rely on. All things considered, Han Sen was feeling pretty secure.</p>

	<p>When the centipede approached, Han Sen noticed that it was skittering around small orchid-like plants. There were
		no flowers atop them, but small shapes like gold rats grew from them.</p>

	<p>No, they weren’t rats. After a good look, Han Sen noticed it was something quite familiar. The things growing on
		the plants were very small Red Mist Minks.</p>

	<p>There were seven of them, and their eyes all looked so big. They looked very spiritual, but even so, they all
		vibrated together in fear. Because their tails were grown into the plants, they could not run. They all looked
		so scared as they stared at the centipede.</p>

	<p>Now, Han Sen knew that the centipede had come for the red mist spring. It had come for the minks. What Han Sen
		didn’t know was who the creature was going to attack first.</p>

	<p>The centipede quickly skittered up to Han Sen with its blade-like claws. It attacked Han Sen, making repeated
		ding dong noises. The claws were unable to break Han Sen’s armor, but they left marks on its surface. That was
		very impressive for a Viscount class pair of claws.</p>

	<p>The Viscount xenogeneic should have found it impossible to damage a Marquise armor.</p>

	<p>This xenogeneic is a bit creepy.” But even so, Han Sen still felt safe. It was creepy, yes, but it could not harm
		him.</p>

	<p>The centipede wreathed itself around Han Sen, trapping him in the grip of its body. Its feet were also like
		blades, and they kept scrabbling against him.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, only a few white scratch marks were left on the armor. The attacks still couldn’t damage him.</p>

	<p>The creature did not have a mouth, and its head was very flat. It had two long beard-strands, too. Aside from the
		claws and the blade-like legs, there was no other way for it to attack Han Sen.</p>

	<p>It kept slashing Han Sen for quite some time, but it was unable to hurt him. The centipede eventually gave up. It
		climbed over to the plants that were growing minks, instead.</p>

	<p>It circled the minks, but it did not seem to hurt them.</p>

	<p>But the minks were still frightened. They were shaking in fear.</p>

	<p>“What is it trying to do?” Han Sen was confused, and so he resumed trying to break through the green light.</p>

	<p>Jadeskin, his mutant blood, and The Story of Genes were all useless. When he cast his Dongxuan Sutra, he could
		sense something from the light. But it was just Baron class, and one level lower than the green light. He could
		not get it to break through.</p>

	<p>Han Sen kept using his Dongxuan Sutra to battle the green light. He also watched the xenogeneic. He was
		interested in learning what it was up to.</p>

	<p>As he fought the green light, Dongxuan Sutra’s power flowed through him like it always did. But Han Sen felt as
		if the power was changing slightly. He felt as if he was on the precipice of breaking through.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was so happy about this, seeing as he had used the Dongxuan Sutra to fight against the green light. He
		wanted the green light to sharpen the Dongxuan Sutra, and perhaps prompt a level-up.</p>

	<p>Right now, the most effective thing about the Dongxuan Sutra was the Dongxuan Aura. Han Sen did not have the
		power to unleash Dongxuan Sutra-fueled skills. If he made it reach Viscount, he could cast attacks with the
		Dongxuan Sutra. Han Sen had been waiting for this moment for a very long time.</p>

	<p>Han Sen kept using his Dongxuan Sutra to fight the green light, but it was one level lower. The power was being
		used up very quickly.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could only take very minor breaks. Whenever he regained some of his power, he’d get right back into
		fighting.</p>

	<p>After two hours of this, the cave was shining with red light. Some of the mist had drifted into the cave like a
		river. The entire cave was full of this red mist now.</p>

	<p>As Han Sen wondered why the red mist was coming in, he realized that the red mist in the cave had begun reducing.
	</p>

	<p>The red mist was flowing as if it was being blown away by a fan. It didn’t exit the cave, though. So, Han Sen had
		a peep at where the red mist was going. It was seeping into the plants with the red minks.</p>

	<p>After half an hour, the red mist had become very thin. It no longer hindered Han Sen’s senses.</p>

	<p>The plants that absorbed the mist were releasing a light. Especially the seven small minks. They looked so shiny,
		like little treasures. They looked very golden.</p>

	<p>After the mist was absorbed by the plants, no more mist entered the cave. The shiny look on the plants and the
		minks began to dull.</p>

	<p>Han Sen took a closer look, and he noticed that the fur of the minks was much fuller. Their eyes were brighter,
		too, and their lifeforce had grown stronger.</p>

	<p>“That centipede must be waiting for the minks to grow. I wonder how much longer this might take?” Now Han Sen
		knew just what that xenogeneic wanted.</p>

	<p>Han Sen kept using the Dongxuan Sutra to battle the green light. Every time Han Sen used up all his power in
		combat with the green light, his powers grew stronger as they recovered. It was a process that delighted him.
	</p>

	<p>After a while, the mist entered the cave again. Just like last time, the plants absorbed it. And then, the minks
		grew bigger.</p>

	<p>The third time the mist was absorbed, the mist was absorbed by the Red Mist Minks themselves. Han Sen’s body then
		moved. He lowered his Ghost Teeth Knife, which he had been holding in the air.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could not break through the binding of the green light, but the Dongxuan Sutra’s power was starting to
		work. And he knew this because he could now move his body a minute amount.</p>

	<p>The centipede sensed his movement, though. It turned around and shone many of its eyes at Han Sen. It increased
		the power of the chains it had locked around Han Sen, prohibiting him from moving any more.</p>

	<p>The xenogeneic had not been able to hurt Han Sen, and he didn’t consider it much of a threat. So, Han Sen kept
		using the green light to practice with the Dongxuan Sutra. And over time, he developed a resistance to the green
		light.</p>

	<p>On the twenty-third time the mist started pouring into the cave, the plants’ light was growing again. They were
		becoming brighter than the red mist. Amidst that heavy fog, the outlines of the plants were visible, shining
		brightly. The seven plants each had a Red Mist Mink growing on them.</p>
