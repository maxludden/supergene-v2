<p>“If you listen to what I say, perhaps you won’t suffer much.
Otherwise, you will end up like this thing.” Han Sen waved his hand
and cut the xenogeneic plant next to them in half.</p>
<p>The red-robed child quietened down. He nibbled his lips and
stopped screaming and struggling, but his eyes were still red with
tears. He was looking at Han Sen as if he had just been
bullied.</p>
<p>“Get those xenogeneic plants out of the way,” Han Sen commanded
the red-robed child.</p>
<p>The red-robed child did not speak or move. Han Sen raised his
hand to pretend he was going to hit the boy and shouted, “Yeah!” He
saw the xenogeneic plants simply part to pave a way. Even the
deified xenogeneic plants were doing it.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, The power to control these plant xenogeneics is
weird. I wonder if he can control plant xenogeneics of an even
higher level. If he can, that would surely be awesome. He then
addressed the Flower God Leader and said, “Leader, can you please
take a look if the flower seed is still there?”</p>
<p>The Flower God Leader quickly ran to the vine tower that held
the flower seed. Everyone followed him. The vine tower was a mess
inside, but there was no flower seed.</p>
<p>While looking directly at the red-robed child, the Flower God
Leader said, “It is gone. I would wager that he is the flower seed.
His body bears the presence of that flower seed.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and looked at the red-robed child. He was
thinking about how best to deal with the child. First and foremost,
it all depended on whether or not he could control the Space
Garden.</p>
<p>Although the red-robed child did not like this, his power had
been restricted by Han Sen. He was not able to defeat him or
escape. He now had to listen to Han Sen’s commands.</p>
<p>Han Sen let the red-robed child find all the Flower Gods there.
With the red-robed child present, all the plant xenogeneics in the
Space Garden listened to him. It was easy for them to gather the
rest of the Flower God people.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his phoenix flame to clear away the vegetation that
had claimed their heads to bring them back to normal.</p>
<p>Upon seeing what Han Sen had done and with the red-robed child
adhering to what Han Sen told him to do, the Flower God people did
not dare break their promise or raise qualms with the new sheriff.
They had to stay, listen, and do whatever Han Sen and Xie Qing King
ordered them to do. They had become a subordinate race. There was
no doubt about that.</p>
<p>Han Sen rounded up the displaced deified elites and commanded
the red-robed child to open the Space Garden’s door to send them
away.</p>
<p>“Farewell.” Before Long Bamboo left, he smiled at Han Sen. It
seemed as if he knew who San Mu really was but simply did not want
to expose him.</p>
<p>When all the deified elites departed, Han Sen did not worry too
much about others learning about the Space Garden.</p>
<p>Even if they knew about it, the knowledge was pointless to them.
The Space Garden was a scary xenogeneic ganoderma lucidum. Even
true god elites were not able to overcome the power of the
ganoderma lucidum. As long as Han Sen kept a tight leash on the
red-robed child, no one else would be able to enter the Space
Garden.</p>
<p>“From now on, we have a territory to call our own. Now, all we
need to do is light up a lantern.” Xie Qing King and Han Sen were
relaxing in the garden. They were having a barbecue and drinking
beer.</p>
<p>The red-robed child was sitting next to Han Sen. He was holding
some grilled meat, and he really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>“Breaking the door and lighting a lantern would not be
difficult, but we need to think about which lantern we should
replace,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Do we need to think about it?” Xie Qing King asked. “The Flower
Gods and Tree Men already have a grudge. We can use the name of the
Flower Gods to get rid of the Tree Men.”</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and said, “By doing that, we will be
helping the Flower Gods light up the lantern. It would have nothing
to do with humans and spirits. We will have to light up our own
lantern. We cannot use the name of some other race.”</p>
<p>“Does it really matter?” Xie Qing King asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>“From what I can tell, there is a problem with the human name.
Many scary people in this universe are in search of humans. If I
use that name to light up the lantern, it will probably attract
many disasters and bring danger to the Space Garden.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Han Sen said, “There is no rush. I have another
plan. We should use this time to get our people to the Space
Garden. I need to watch this little guy in case he tries to stir up
some mischief. I suppose you will have to do the people-ferrying
service.”</p>
<p>Xie Qing King agreed and said, “That will be easy. I will go to
Sky Palace and pick up Bao’er and the others. As for the other
guys, I will just have to let them know.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He really missed Bao’er, Zero, Little Angel, and
Han Yan. Previously, he did not have a territory of his own, but
now he did. He was going to bring them there.</p>
<p>Han Sen was worried about one thing. The Sky Vine Radish’s gene
power was too strong. After it had been absorbed by the Space
Garden, the Space Garden was continuously evolving. Many plant
xenogeneics and the flower fields leveled up to become humongous.
And, they did so quickly. There were many deified xenogeneics
around. Han Sen thought, If things keep going like this, there will
be transmutation or even larvae class deified xenogeneics running
about. If he was not able to claim the red-robed child to keep
everything under control, he was sure to end up in trouble.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that red-robed child did not accept anything. He
was listening to Han Sen’s commands for now, but Han Sen sensed
that as soon as he had the chance he would revolt.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, It looks like I will have to wait until Bao’er
gets here. I can’t wait to see what Bao’er will do to this little
guy. If Bao’er is unable to tame him, we’ll have no choice but to
lock him up.</p>
<p>After the Flower Gods lost the flowers on their heads, their
levels had significantly dropped. Now, even a King class Flower God
was rare to find. Luckily, they only had to make geno fluid, and
that never cost them much power.</p>
<p>Because the Space Garden had mutated, many of the xenogeneic
plants had leveled up. They used their old formulas to make geno
fluids because the ingredients were now better. That meant the
effect the fluids had on geno arts was able to increase. That
greatly surprised them.</p>
<p>With the talent the Flower Gods had for synthesizing geno
fluids, they could reproduce the genes of the xenogeneics. One geno
fluid was able to concentrate a few or even a dozen xenogeneic
genes. After humans used them, their genes increased quickly. They
did not have to waste time by digesting flesh.</p>
<p>“Technology really does make things much easier,” Han Sen said.
“If I knew there was a skill like this, I would never have had to
practice a digesting geno art.”</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s deified genes had already reached 100. He did not
need to drink geno fluid anymore.</p>
<p>Which battle body should I increase first? Han Sen was in his
room. He was thinking about which geno art he should evolve
first.</p>
<p>By having 100 deified genes, it made one’s battle body evolve.
Han Sen did not hesitate much. He leveled up his The Story of
Genes.</p>
<p>The Story of Genes was the hardest to evolve. Therefore, Han Sen
chose it. Now that he had the Space Garden, it was easy to collect
more deified genes. He did not have to worry too much.</p>
