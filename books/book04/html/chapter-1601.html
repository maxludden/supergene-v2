      Han Sen tried a lot of things, but he still couldn’t get the crystal shoe
      off his foot. That shoe seemed to have been permanently attached to him,
      and he couldn’t even get the thing to wiggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short while, a sand mouse managed to cross the entire fluorescent
      lake and reached the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island was very small, around two thousand square feet in total area,
      and there was a fruit tree growing in the middle of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fruit tree wasn’t very tall, and it looked like an ordinary pear tree.
      Despite the fact that it was around ten feet tall, there were only three
      pieces of fruit hanging on it. Perhaps some of the fruit had already been
      taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the pears was green, one was red, and the third one was yellow. It
      was strange how different all the pieces of fruit looked from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the green pear hadn’t matured yet, then what about the red pear and the
      yellow pear? Which one had matured?
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s get onto the island first.” Han Sen saw that he couldn’t get the
      crystal heel off at the moment, so he let Little Star fly to the island
      anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn’t anxious at all. Since entering super king spirit mode had some
      impact on the crystal heel, he would probably try to deal with the problem
      that way. Even if everything else he tried failed, he could just cut off
      his foot. With Han Sen’s physical strength and the curing power of Little
      Silver, his foot would regrow again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Little Star flew to the island, it was already late. The sand mouse,
      which had somehow made it to the island, had climbed up the fruit tree,
      and taken a bite out of the yellow pear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pear wasn’t large, about the size of a man’s fist. When the sand mouse
      bit into it, almost half of the pear disappeared down the mouse’s throat.
      The fluids of the pear were rich, and a delicious smell permeated the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sand mouse wanted more, but before it could take another bite, its
      body got stiffened as if it were petrified, and it fell down from the
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and the others were all shocked, and they didn’t dare to move
      forward after seeing the mouse’s reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sand mouse fell on the ground, and there was yellow light coming out
      of its body. The original dark fur had seemed to have been dyed, and it
      became golden yellow.
    </p>
    <p>It looked like a lively golden sculpture.</p>
    <p>
      The light coming from the mouse’s body got denser and denser, and the
      golden light became purer and purer. The mouse’s lifeforce, however,
      became weaker and weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short while, the sand mouse became completely lifeless, and the
      light vanished. The mouse became a motionless golden sculpture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and the others looked at each other, and none of them moved. Even
      Xu Mi, who had been craving the fruit, didn’t dare to touch it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that it isn’t entirely beneficial to eat that fruit. The king of
      mice might’ve eaten a fruit that is beneficial to its body, and that’s how
      it got so powerful. As for that sand mouse, it wasn’t so lucky. It seems
      that it made a bad choice, said Xu Mi, looking at the two and a half pears
      on the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can anyone tell which fruit is good and which is bad?” Lin Feng looked at
      everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dragon Chef, you know the most about this stuff. Can you tell?” Han Sen
      looked at the female cook. He couldn’t tell the differences between the
      three fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the fruit looked good, and there was nothing unusual about them. Han
      Sen couldn’t see anything different about them other than their colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Chef shook her head and said, “I’ve never seen fruit like this, and
      from my perspective, there’s nothing wrong with any of the fruit I just
      can’t figure out why the sand mouse had such a bad reaction after eating
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dragon Chef couldn’t tell, even though she was an experienced cook, so
      Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu had no idea how to figure out which of the fruit
      were safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treasure was right in front of them, but none of them dared to take
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen walked around on the island, trying to find something that might
      help him. He was wearing a crystal shoe on his left foot. He hadn’t felt
      anything when he was in the water, but now that he was walking on the
      ground, his feet were unbalanced. Though it didn’t affect him much, he
      still felt weird walking like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu had the same plan as Han Sen. They all walked
      around the island, and after walking around for a while, they found
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked around the fruit tree, and then they found that there was a
      line of characters on the trunk of the fruit tree, and they belonged to an
      ancient human language.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If there was no parting grief before the eye, I don’t believe men on
      earth would have white hair.” Lin Feng read the sentence out loud.
      Apparently, he had also studied ancient languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems that it’s been a long time since the characters were carved
      here, and the tree has grown deeply around the words. Unfortunately, we
      don’t know about the growth cycle of this tree, so we can’t tell when the
      carving was made”, said Jing Jiwu, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which human demigod did this, and how did he come here so long ago? Did
      he eat the fruit?” Lin Feng wondered out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu assumed that the characters had been left by a
      human demigod. Though Han Sen also thought it was possible, he wasn’t as
      sure as the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past few years, Han Sen had discovered that humans weren’t the only
      ones who used ancient human languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It must have been a woman who left these characters”, said the Dragon
      Chef, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?” Han Sen and the others looked to the Dragon Chef, but they didn’t
      have any idea how she had come to the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growth of the tree had changed the writing a little bit. The
      handwriting was still visible, and it was even very neat and regular, but
      it was difficult to tell whether the letters were beautiful or forceful,
      so it was difficult to tell whether they came from a woman or a man.
    </p>
    <p>“My natural instinct as a woman”, said the Dragon Chef.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t know how to react. “Women’s intuition” wasn’t accurate or
      reliable at all, and besides, the Dragon Chef wasn’t a woman but a female
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter where the handwriting came from, it was completely useless to
      Han Sen. Han Sen and the others searched the island carefully again, but
      they couldn’t find anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sand mice were still trying to swim toward the island. Most of the ten
      thousand sand mice had sunk into the lake, and now, there were only a few
      dozen of them struggling to swim toward the island. The mice were still
      being dragged into the lake, so it was difficult to tell whether any other
      sand mice would make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While everyone was thinking about what to do, Bao’er climbed up in the
      tree and took a bite of the green fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was completely shocked. He knew that Bao’er was exceptional, yet
      he was still worried. After all, they had almost no information on the
      fruit, so nobody could say for sure that Bao’er would be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er finished the green pear in three bites. Similar to a pear, the
      fruit didn’t have a stone inside. Bao’er swallowed the entire fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er licked her lips. It seemed that she still wanted more. However,
      green light shone from her body, and she fell from the tree, which
      terrified Han Sen.
