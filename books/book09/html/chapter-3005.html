<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his body had hit water. He was following the
stream, continuously rolling in its flow. He did not know how far
he had rolled. He stabilized his body and came out of the water. He
realized he was emerging from a lake. He saw many grass fields
around and clear blue skies overhead. The lake was so clean that it
was like a mirror.</p>
<p>The sky was reflected in the water. It made people feel as if
they were swimming in the sky.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Han Sen knew that it was not a simple
place since he had fallen there through strange means. He had
likely fallen through some teleport. Otherwise, he would not have
ended up in that lake.</p>
<p>He went to a place that was like a mountain. There were many
mountains and dense woods around him. No matter how he had fallen,
he would not have found himself in a field.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He noticed space was different from
before. He was no longer in the same system.</p>
<p>He wanted to get up, but the red and blue blood were causing too
much of a conflict in his body. His limbs were numb. He could
barely control himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that if this continued, he would lose complete
control of his body. He knew his body would guide him to do
something he could not control.</p>
<p>He gnashed his teeth. He used his shaky hands to grab the
medicine Han Jinzhi had given him. He popped the lid and drank the
liquid.</p>
<p>Now, he needed to heal himself like a dead horse. He could not
allow himself to lose control.</p>
<p>Han Sen still did not understand things very much. He did not
understand why the blue blood inside his veins gave him a desire to
kill Bao’er. He had no such feelings for Bai King or Sun Moon God
Ape.</p>
<p>“Is it because of the xenogeneic battle body or Bao’er herself?”
Han Sen suddenly could not think of the answer. Han Sen drank the
medicine, which tasted like spring water. It expressed all the
bloody air. The effect was better than a pill that stopped
diarrhea. Blood-Pulse Sutra was running at an insane pace. Without
the blood air, it finally stopped running</p>
<p>No matter if it was the blue blood or the Nine-Life Cat tattoo,
it was like a fire had been put out. Everything quieted down. “It
works!” Han Sen got control of his body again, but then he felt
depressed.</p>
<p>When Blood-Pulse Sutra stopped, his body had no more power to
run. No matter the geno art or Blood-Pulse Sutra he tried to cast,
nothing worked.</p>
<p>That meant Han Sen’s body had true god class power but no
special skills to use.</p>
<p>Right now, Han Sen could jump very high, but he was unable to
fly. He could punch a star, but his fist had to touch a star to do
that.</p>
<p>“This is bad. I cannot fly now! How else can I go to the cold
planet?” Han Sen felt a bit sad.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to risk using the Blood-Pulse Sutra power
again. Yet, he was that afraid after using the Blood-Pulse Sutra,
he would end up activating the blue blood power again. If that
happened, he would be in trouble.</p>
<p>“It looks like I will have to see if my Super God Spirit mode
can break the blue blood power.” Han Sen ceased hesitating. He
tried to use his Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A bright, white light was on Han Sen’s body. It made him go into
Super God Spirit mode. His entire body was like a God Spirit in
space. All of the powers returned to Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Because of Wan’er, the Super God Spirit mode only lasted a short
amount of time. Han Sen quickly returned to his normal body.</p>
<p>“I cannot remove this weird situation affecting my body.” Han
Sen noticed he was still unable to use any gene power. On top of
that, his blood was still blue.</p>
<p>“It looks like I must go to the cold planet.” Han Sen planned to
go to the cold planet. Even if Super God Spirit mode could remove
his blue blood, he still wanted to find Han Yufei and ask her what
was going on.</p>
<p>Now, he could not remove the blue blood restrictions. That meant
he really had to go.</p>
<p>“Han Yufei should be the woman who was trapped in Two Worlds
Mountain. If I know her face, then she was in Two Worlds Mountain.
Finding her should be easy, but how do I go to the cold
planet?”</p>
<p>Han Sen rested for a while. He let his body recover before using
Super God Spirit body again. That way, he could use all kinds of
geno arts. At that moment, he used Dongxuan Area to scan the
planet. He looked at the star map to review the geography.</p>
<p>The results disappointed were disappointing. It was just a
primitive planet. There were creatures, but they were low-life
creatures. There was not a single creature with intelligence that
could talk.</p>
<p>It was the same with the planets around him. Han Sen was not
familiar with those planets. Aside from this planet, no other
planet had life or civilization of any kind.</p>
<p>“That means I can only risk using Galaxy Teleportation.” Han Sen
was glad his Super God Spirit mode could be used. Otherwise, he
would be jumping around in space. He would not know when he would
reach the cold planet if he did that.</p>
<p>Han Sen rested on the grass for a while. After he recovered his
energy, Han Sen used the Super God Spirit mode again. He used its
moment of time to make use of Galaxy Teleportation.</p>
<p>Because he was unable to confirm the location and distance, he
used luck to teleport. He did not know which way to go or where the
desired location was situated.</p>
<p>Han Sen prayed, “Please, God, be nice to me. Let me teleport to
a planet with intelligent life.”</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>Super God Spirit mode lost its effect. Han Sen fell out of
Galaxy Teleportation. He felt as if he had fallen into water again.
“Am I having some extremely bad luck with water? Why do I keep
falling into water?” Han Sen dragged himself out of the water.
After looking around, he did not know what to say.</p>
<p>He had fallen into water, but he did not fall into a lake or
river. It was not a sea or a bathtub. He had fallen into a big
pot.</p>
<p>It was a very big, steel pot. The pot was 12 feet wide and about
21 to 24 feet tall. It was half-filled with water. Some other
things were floating in there. There were chives, ginger, garlic,
and chili.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s started to salivate. He licked it. He felt a numb and
spicy taste overwhelm his mouth.</p>
<p>“Holy crap! Why did I teleport into someone’s hot pot? What is
he doing, cooking numb and spicy fish?” Han Sen looked around. He
discovered the pot had a lot of green and red chilies, and many
other spices he could not even recognize.</p>
<p>The red and green chilies were all bigger than his head. It was
not some normal species.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to get out of the pot. When he looked at the
bottom of the pot, he froze.</p>
<p>The pot had more than just spicy chilies. There was something
alive in it. Han Sen knew it was something living.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Has the god list fight’s No. 8 Empty Dragon
King become a crayfish in a spicy hot pot? No. He is Numb and Spicy
Dragon King now!” Han Sen looked at the living thing at the bottom.
He did not know what to think.</p>
