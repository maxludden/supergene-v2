<h2>Capture</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1802</h3>

<p>The battle started with an arrow falling from the sky. It landed
the midst of everyone, and they all stared at it in shock. They
raised their heads, and they saw Chaos descending from the sky. The
Chaos quickly surrounded everyone, and their numbers were several
hundred strong.</p>
<p>A line of arrows were targeting them, and everyone was shocked.
That included Han Sen.</p>
<p>He had already tried escaping from four Chaos, and that was
extremely trying. But now their numbers were vast, and he quickly
realized that escaping might be impossible here. Unless he used his
super god body, of course. In his current state, though, he
couldn’t flee.</p>
<p>It was a shame he still needed to recover. Even if he did use
super god spirit mode, it wouldn’t last very long. He might be able
to take down a few Chaos, but he couldn’t kill a few hundred while
maintaining enough strength to escape.</p>
<p>“Put down your weapons and put your hands behind your head.” A
Chaos made use of the universal language to speak with them.</p>
<p>Facing so many drawn bows, no one dared do anything to provoke
the Chaos. Looking glum, they all did as instructed. They put down
their weapons and put their hands behind their heads.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned the scabbard to his waist and lifted his arms
like the higher races were. The Chaos moved closer and pointed the
arrows right at them, then ropes were brought out to bind them. The
Chaos put long spears through the ropes and carried them like
pigs.</p>
<p>“They are vegetarians, right? Or are they cannibals?” Han Sen’s
heart sank. If it wasn’t for those who had been captured with him,
he would have been long gone by now. He wouldn’t have been in this
predicament.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Chaos didn’t seem to want to kill them immediately.
The creatures were headed into the desert.</p>
<p>After four days, they came to an oasis. This oasis was far
bigger, and wooden houses were visible amidst the foliage. So, it
must have been where the Chaos lived.</p>
<p>Everyone was brought to a meadow filled with stone pillars.
Yisha was tied to one. She was still wearing her mask, but the
wound in her chest now looked fine.</p>
<p>The higher races didn’t seem to recognize her, and the two
Rebate with him didn’t realize who she was. They seemed none the
wiser.</p>
<p>Then, the Chaos tied them to the stone pillars. Han Sen was not
too far from Yisha, as she was only two pillars away.</p>
<p>Yisha did see Han Sen there, though. And she also saw the
scabbard he was carrying. Her eyes looked bright and confused, and
she fervently wondered why the scabbard would behave like that.</p>
<p>The Chaos took the wooden weaponry that the group carried. They
didn’t see a knife in the socket of the scabbard, so they left it
with Han Sen. Han Sen couldn’t use it, anyway.</p>
<p>“What do the Chaos want to do with us?” the bird-faced man
asked.</p>
<p>No one could answer him, as no one knew what the Chaos wanted.
The creatures just tied them to the pillars and then left. There
were a few Chaos children looking at them, though. The kids stared
at them like they were animals in a zoo.</p>
<p>The Chaos were affected by Demon Grave, and so they didn’t have
any Nobles. They only had geno armor. But their fitness, even when
they were children, was quite good.</p>
<p>The Demon called Vic turned to Yisha and asked, “Rebate Lady,
when did they capture you? Do you have any idea what they plan to
do?”</p>
<p>Yisha ignored him. She was a King that had touched a deified
door. If she had not been injured by Han Sen, she would not have
gotten captured. This was a humiliating situation for her, and so
she wasn’t willing to let anyone hear of her identity.</p>
<p>Vic frowned when he got ignored, but it wasn’t as if he could
threaten her into talking now.</p>
<p>A Rebate man asked, “Look, we’re all in the same boat here. If
you know anything, you should tell us. Maybe then we can escape
together.”</p>
<p>The other high race people agreed, in the hope that she could
tell them something they could use to escape.</p>
<p>Yisha pretended she did not hear any of them. She simply closed
her eyes and rested.</p>
<p>The Rebate man was made angry by this, and he shouted, “Did you
not hear me? I am Rocks Fall Duke, and I command you to answer
me.”</p>
<p>Yisha still kept her eyes closed, and she pretended as if she
did not hear him. Han Sen just looked at the woman curiously. It
was strange that they did not know Yisha. Han Sen thought she would
be a person of enormous importance, the type of person that a mere
Duke wouldn’t dare to compare themselves to. So, how could Rock
Falls Duke not recognize who she was?</p>
<p>The sky went dark, and eventually, the Chaos kids looked tired.
They returned to the houses, leaving only those who were tied up
outside.</p>
<p>The Chaos were sleeping now, and no one was watching them. Some
of the higher races wished to shake off their ropes and see if they
could escape.</p>
<p>They did not know what their bindings were made of, though. They
couldn’t get free from them. Even when they squeezed their bodies,
the rope would constrict and squeeze, too.</p>
<p>“Argh!” A weird voice came from outside of the oasis. Everyone
was shocked, and they thought the Chaos had noticed their attempts
to escape.</p>
<p>They looked around and noticed that the wooden doors of the
houses were all closed. No Chaos seemed to be coming out. And then,
they heard that noise again. It sounded as if it was coming from
every angle.</p>
<p>Eventually, the noise drew nearer and nearer. And not long
after, some green eyes were seen peering at them. They were
everywhere in the dark. There were oh-so-many of them.</p>
<p>“What is this? I thought that, aside from the Chaos, there
wouldn’t be any other creatures here,” the bird-looking higher race
man said.</p>
<p>The others of the higher races looked terrible, and it soon
looked as if the eyes were coming towards them. It didn’t seem as
if they were only there to admire the captives.</p>
