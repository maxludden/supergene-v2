The king of mice stopped in front of the holes in the sand, then it called to the group of mice behind it. The sand mice immediately ran into the holes.

Nobody knew how deep the holes were, but they looked like an abyss. A great many sand mice had already entered, but it still wasn’t full.

“I can’t get into a hole like that”, Jing Jiwu looked at the holes that were the size of a fist and shook his head.

“How about we dig into a hole to see what’s inside?” Xu Mi suggested.

Jing Jiwu shook his head and said, “If we could simply dig into a hole, the mouse king wouldn’t be staying outside. I’m pretty sure that he would be much better at digging holes than us.”

Xu Mi thought that made sense.

The sand mice were still entering the holes. Lin Feng examined the mouse king and said, “Do you think that mouse king became a super creature because of something inside one of those holes?”

Jing Jiwu’s eyes gleamed. “If so, then it’ll bring all its descendants here to make sure that its descendants can also evolve like it did.”

“Yes, that must be the case! Let’s try digging a hole.” Xu Mi was excited.

No need for the trouble, Han Sen said to Xu Mi, jumping on Little Star’s back. “Get on Little Star’s back, all of you.”

Although Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu didn’t know Little Star’s power, they both suspected that Little Star might be great at digging holes.

Everyone climbed on Little Star’s back. Starlight shone around Little Star’s body, covering Han Sen and the others, and they went into one of the holes.

Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu had thought that Little Star had the power to dig holes, but instead, Little Star was traveling straight through the sandstone layers.

“He can pass through materials?” Lin Feng asked in surprise.

Han Sen nodded, and Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu were all the more surprised seeing that Han Sen had confirmed it. This ability was very rare and quite impressive.

After seeing Han Sen kill Blood Bone Demon, Little Silver use incredible curing power, Little Star pass through solid materials, Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu were continually amazed.

“Han Sen, you’re just favored by God. You have all the nice things in the world. How are we supposed to catch up?” asked Jing Jiwu, smiling.

Han Sen also smiled. “There’re many good things in the shelter. I’m just a little bit lucky.”

Neither Lin Feng nor Jing Ji Wu said anything. If Han Sen was only considered “a little bit lucky,” they had no idea what real luck meant.

The sand hole was very deep, and after several miles, the small sand holes started to converge into a giant rock road.

Han Sen saw the fluorescent river flowing away down the underground rock road while the group of mice chased after it.

The king of mice hadn’t entered with them, so only the small sand mice were chasing the river. Many ordinary sand mice were not able to keep up with the river, but they kept driving themselves forward until their bodies were twitching and foam was spewing from their mouths.

Unfortunately, they were not able to keep up with the river anymore. As Han Sen saw more and more sand mice falling behind, the rest sped up and tried to catch up with the river.

The underground rock road was like a cobweb, and it extended in all directions. The river didn’t leave any traces where it flowed across; if they didn’t follow the river, they would definitely get lost in the underground labyrinth.

Han Sen and the others chased the underground river for more than forty hours, and they saw more and more sand mice dropping out of the race. Only less than one percent of the sand mice were able to keep up.

However, even one percent of the mice was at least ten thousand. Most of them were mutant creatures, while some were primitive creatures.

Now, lots of them had burned out already. Many primitive sand mice couldn’t run anymore, and they were foaming at the mouth.

At this moment, the river in front of them suddenly stopped, and so did Han Sen and the others. They didn’t rush to chase it.

The rock road got broader in front of them, forming an enormous underground space. The fluorescent river flowed into the cave, forming an underground lake, and it stopped right there.

Han Sen and the others followed the group of sand mice to the lake, and they saw that at the center of the lake was a small island with a small tree growing on it There were fruits that looked like pears on the tree.

“There’s indeed something amazing here. We made the right choice to come here.” Xu Mi was exhilarated. He wanted to fly across the lake and go to the island immediately.

Han Sen grabbed Xu Mi, shook his head, and said, “Let’s observe it first If it’s really that valuable, it won’t be so easy to take.”

After only a short while, the sand mice rushed into the late. They tried to swim toward the island, wanting to eat the fruit.

The sand mice began swimming across, and nothing happened at first Halfway across the lake, though, the sand mice sunk as if they had been grabbed by something in the water. They vanished under the surface.

Han Sen and the others were all shocked. They watched the water for a short while, but they couldn’t see what had dragged the sand mice down.

Though the fluorescent water was bright, it wasn’t very transparent Because it was too bright, it was difficult to see what was beneath the surface.

The sand mice had sunk one by one as if they were dragged down by a water ghost

Yet the group of mice didn’t give up; on the contrary, they continued swimming toward the island without any consideration for their lives. Many sand mice were dragged into the lake, but a small portion of them were lucky, and they were gradually approaching the island.

Not all the sand mice are sinking. I don’t think it’s the water itself pulling them down. It’s something inside the water, Jing Jiwu said, looking at the lake.

It should be okay for us to fly across the lake, right? said Xu Mi.

We can try that, but we still need to be careful. Han Sen nodded.

Everyone saw that some of the sand mice were about to reach the island. They stopped hesitating and flew up into the sky, trying to fly as high as possible.

Nothing happened in the beginning, but when they were halfway there, Han Sen felt that a powerful force grabbing him and trying to drag him into the lake.

Han Sen looked down and tried to see what there was down there, but he couldn’t see anything under the water.

Sploosh! Sploosh sploosh!

Han Sen summoned his butterfly wings and bloodthirsty ant king to stop himself from falling, but at the same time, the Dragon Chef, Xu Mi, Lin Feng, and Jing Jiwu all fell into the lake, and they were quickly sinking.
