<p>The geno tablet’s text lit up. It kept releasing mysterious
thoughts. It was like it was trying to tell Han Sen he did not have
permission to activate the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care. His fingers continued to draw across the
geno tablet. His body’s power was being amassed on the tip of his
finger. It drew a lot of finger marks for a while.</p>
<p>The symbol was not complicated. There were seven of them, but
none of the lines were straight. They were all curved. Seven lines
crossed each other to create a mysterious symbol.</p>
<p>As Han Sen’s finger kept drawing on the stone tablet, his spirit
body became dimmer. After drawing seven times, his spirit body was
transparent and crystal clear. It was going to fade away.</p>
<p>“At last, I have drawn it all!” Han Sen did not relax. He stared
at the geno tablet symbol.</p>
<p>When the symbol was on its final drawing, the very normal symbol
suddenly started to glow with light. It created some sort of rhythm
that was sort of ancient.</p>
<p>When the symbols were shining in the geno tablet, the whole of
the 33 skies shook. The space in the black hole started to become
smaller.</p>
<p>“It really is useful! Han Sen was delighted about this.</p>
<p>In the God Chaos Party, Qin Xiu frowned. Shoot Shadow and the
others were all shocked. “How could things turn out like this? The
space tunnels are suddenly disappearing.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu stepped forward. He came before an altar. Sky King was
trapped at the center of the altar. His entire body was releasing a
weird power. That power kept melting into the altar, and the
altar’s power was affecting the whole of the 33 skies.</p>
<p>“Sky King’s power has not been reduced. Why would the space
tunnel just vanish?” Qin Xiu frowned and retreated into thought. He
could not formulate a reason for why this was happening.</p>
<p>The black holes of the two universes were getting smaller very
quickly. The black holes were disappearing. The life souls that did
not enter the geno universe were blocked outside. They went back to
the universe of kingdoms.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the black holes were disappearing and felt a bit
relieved. Although the situation in the geno universe was bad, it
was better than having many more life souls pouring in.</p>
<p>The geno tablet’s symbols were still shining with light.
Compared to before, the light was dimmer. Han Sen noticed the stone
tablet’s markings were slowly healing.</p>
<p>“Ancient Devil, why is the mark slowly recovering?” Han Sen was
looking at the Sea of Soul and Ancient Devil, who was within
it.</p>
<p>“This tablet is called the foundation of the universe,” Ancient
Devil coldly said. “Even if the universe was destroyed, this would
not be destroyed. To leave words on it is very hard. Do you want it
to be there forever? Even when the old leader left symbols on it,
his graffiti did not last on it forever. His would only have lasted
a bit longer than yours. If you want to continue suppressing Sky
King’s power, you need to wait until the symbol is gone for a
while. Then, you need to write the symbol on the tablet again.”</p>
<p>“Writing down the symbol cost me a lot of power the first time,”
Han Sen coldly said. “The speed of it disappearing is faster than
what I recover. If I keep drawing it back on, I will be unable to
do anything else. I will be stuck in the 33rd sky forever.”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil smiled and said, “No one is forcing you. If you
want to leave, no one can keep you here.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled. “It is no wonder why you were the vice president
of the God Chaos Party. You set me up with this, wanting to keep me
trapped here. I cannot find the problem you had.”</p>
<p>“It is not like that. If this was not for me, there would be no
other that could sort out the problem in the geno universe. We
needed each other for this. You should be thanking me just as
much.” Ancient Devil smiled.</p>
<p>“I suppose you are right.” Han Sen released Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil wanted to use the geno tablet, but he had to stop
Qin Xiu from coming to the 33rd sky. If he did that, Ancient Devil
could live longer. Otherwise, Han Sen would not let him go.</p>
<p>After Ancient Devil emerged, he smiled at Han Sen and said, “You
and I have the same foe. We should be friends.”</p>
<p>“Having a friend like you makes me pretty scared,” Han Sen said
with a smile.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil shook his head and said, “You are not afraid of
me. If you were afraid of me, you would not have set me free. You
and I are the same. We are scared of Qin Xiu, and that is because
we play the game by its rules. We play games by abiding by the
rules. We don’t cross lines and break the rules. So, no matter how
strong you are, I am not afraid of you. Qin Xiu is different. He
always does things by breaking the rules. People like that are the
scariest ones there are. It is not because of how strong he is. It
is because people like that can never have their intentions
guessed. You never know what they plan to do.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Ancient Devil was correct. People who followed the
rules weren’t scary. That was because everyone knew the rules. If
they did not cross the line, no matter how strong they were, no one
had to fear them.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was different. He did not have those lines. He could do
anything he wanted to. Plus, people with as much power as him were
the scariest.</p>
<p>“While the symbol has not disappeared yet, can you send me out
of the 33rd sky?” Ancient Devil asked with a bow.</p>
<p>“Fine.” Han Sen sent Ancient Devil out of the 33rd sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if Ancient Devil would follow the rules,
but Han Sen knew Ancient Devil would want to get the geno tablet
for himself. That was what Qin Xiu wanted to, and that was enough
for him.</p>
<p>After he sent Ancient Devil out of the 33rd sky, Han Sen
returned to the geno tablet. The black hole in the geno universe
had almost shut down. The symbol on the tablet had become lighter.
Han Sen thought the symbol would only last a few days.</p>
<p>If he did not draw a new symbol by then, Sky King could open the
space crack again.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and thought, “A few days is just enough for me
to recover my spirit power.”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil used him to go against Qin Xiu, and he had trapped
him there. That was him removing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>“They are vice presidents. Big sky demon should know something
about this geno tablet.” Han Sen got his body back. He sat at the
bottom of the geno tablet. He relaxed and went to sleep.</p>
<p>“My dear, you are very cruel. You have only come to see me now.”
Big sky demon looked a bit angry in Han Sen’s dream. She put her
arms around him from behind. She brought her cheeks up to his
face.</p>
<p>After she had been injured, she was happy to live in Han Sen’s
dreams. If Han Sen did not dream, she would not show up, but she
could not leave. Han Sen had not slept in a long time. So, big sky
demon had been trapped in his head, unaware of what was going
on.</p>
