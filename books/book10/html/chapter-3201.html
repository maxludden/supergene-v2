<p>Han Sen clutched the bronze sword. Bao’er, Jia Shi Zhen, Qin Bai, and Thousand Mile Reach all had their eyes open wide as they watched him. They kept wondering whether or not Han Sen would end up being affected by the power of the sword and was going to repulsively dance like the man before him had done.</p>

<p>Facing a sword that could break the world, Han Sen did not dare underestimate things. He channeled power into his hands. It was one main power and one power reversed. The two types of power started to surge and generate a Break World power. It was directed into the sword through Han Sen’s hands. The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra created this Break World power. It was able to analyze the origin of a lifeforce. It could also dissolve and rebuild it. That was the power it had. It could discern the building blocks of a creature’s origin with remarkable accuracy.</p>

<p>Although its power was not strong, it was useful to all kinds of lifeforms.</p>

<p>The moment Han Sen placed his hands on the sword, the Break World power went into the bronze sword. The sword released a scream that shocked the sky. The sword’s body exploded with a green light. It blocked Han Sen’s red Break World power, trying to keep it from entering it.</p>

<p>It was not just that either. A dreamy power was coming out from the green sword light. It went through Han Sen’s Break World power. It felt as if electricity was zapping his brain. Some kind of scary power had forced its way inside him.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s face quickly changed. The bronze sword’s power was far stronger than he had expected it to be. It was easily contesting his Break World power, but Han Sen had the impression that it wasn’t even using the full breadth of its power. It had the spare power to release a weird power. It invaded Han Sen’s brain. It looked as if it was going to control him like Thousand Mile Reach.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s willpower was stronger than Thousand Mile Reach’s. Although his brain conjured some strange thoughts, Han Sen was still able to keep a clamp on his emotions and remain still and motionless.</p>

<p>Han Sen continued to hold the sword while standing strong. He stood so quietly that he looked like a statue. The sword’s green light and the red light created a strong contrast that released a wildly bright volume of light.</p>

<p>Qin Bai looked at Jia Shi Zhen and asked, “Is Han Sen going to make it and pull through?”</p>

<p>Jia Shi Zhen shook her head and said, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>They really could not tell which of the two had an advantage. Power was not the main thing. The real battle was happening in the fields of their minds. Unless one won, outsiders could not tell what was happening or going to happen. Han Sen had a heart like steel, but the mental power from the sword was intense. It was like an overobsessed girlfriend. Its love was corrosive and toxic. The mental power it wielded was not all-encompassing, but it was extraordinarily clingy. No matter how strong Han Sen’s will was, he still felt as if his mental power was being beaten back by it.</p>

<p>Han Sen furrowed his brows. He did not want to end up like Thousand Mile Reach, dancing like a horny devil in front of everyone. He quickly gathered up his power to mentally fight against the sword. The bronze sword’s power seemed endless. It was like an unpredictable sea. Han Sen turned his heart into stone. He was not going to allow anything to invade him. That was how he was going to go against the bronze sword’s power.</p>

<p>A man and a sword kept fighting. Qin Bai and the others had their eyes wide open as they stared at the pair. Bao’er was looking at the sword as if deep thoughts were crossing her mind.</p>

<p>At this point, the bronze sword’s text shone, “One-inch thinking, then one-inch gray.” The words flickered with a weird light. As this happened, Han Sen’s face changed. He felt as if the mental power he had been fighting was changing from a flowing river into a tsunami that could shake the sky. He felt battered by it. A strange scene flashed in his brain.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s brain had been overtaken by an illusion. It was one that displayed what happened when his heart had been broken.</p>

<p>When Han Sen took a closer look at the conjured illusion, he was shocked. The bronze sword in his illusion had taken on the shape of a pretty woman. The woman’s eyebrows were like a beautiful painting. She was so pretty that it did not even seem possible that she was real.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought Gu Qingcheng was the prettiest woman in any universe and that he would never find someone prettier than her. Even a real goddess was not prettier than Gu Qincheng.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this woman in the hallucination, Han Sen’s opinion had been turned on its head. He did not even think Gu Qingcheng could match the beauty and grace of the woman inside this illusion.</p>

<p>The prettiness was not what shocked Han Sen. He had seen many beautiful women. While they were not as pretty as the woman in this illusion, many pretty women exuded different feelings. Han Sen had already passed the age of being able to determine who was good and who was bad by gauging their appearance.</p>

<p>The reason he was shocked was that this woman looked incredibly familiar. It was like he had seen her somewhere before.</p>

<p>To be accurate, this woman looked like someone Han Sen knew very well. Her eyebrows and eyes made Han Sen think of someone familiar. It made Han Sen feel as if he was looking at Bao’er’s face.</p>

<p>Yes, this woman’s eyebrows were very similar to Bao’er’s, but Bao’er had a pretty face that was cute and adorable. This woman looked mature and pretty. Her body was not like Bao’er’s, but her face was certainly reminiscent.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s heart felt a bit tempted. After seeing her face, Han Sen was able to calm down and not be overwhelmed by the corrosive mental powers that assaulted him.</p>

<p>“How could this happen? How could a sword wield a face that is so familiar? Have I just imagined all this? Did I imagine what Bao’er’s face will be like after growing up?” Han Sen was shocked, but he did not think it was possible.</p>

<p>His will was not completely broken yet. He could not have the heart shadow there. That woman’s face must have been a reflection from the sword.</p>

<p>The eyebrows of the woman in the image frowned. She looked sad. It made people want to pity her. The woman looked at Han Sen as if she was singing and saying, “One-inch thinking, then one-inch gray.” It was just an illusion, but Han Sen could hear that woman’s voice loud and clear. The remarkable sound was echoing in his brain. It kept echoing. It was getting louder.</p>

<p>The sound possessed the feeling of profound loss. As she sang louder, Han Sen’s will followed the echo. He could not control his emotions. Before long, he started to cry.</p>

<p>Han Sen stared at the woman’s face. Only by doing that could he see Bao’er’s shadow and not have his will be destroyed.</p>

<p>The echo of his brain was like a crazy wave. It created many waves in his heart. His heart was under constant attack.</p>

<p>Qin Bai, Jia Shi Zhen, and the others saw that Han Sen was crying. They felt bad and surprised about it.</p>

<p>“Is Han Sen going to be consumed by that sword?” Qin Bai nervously asked.</p>

<p>Although he wanted to watch Han Sen dance, he was afraid something worse had happened to him.</p>

<p>Of course, no one was able to answer him. Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach had no clue what was going on either.</p>

<p>“Han Sen is not lost,” Jia Shi Zhen said with uncertainty. “He can last a bit longer.”</p>
