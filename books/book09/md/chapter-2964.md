  There were still many temples of all kinds of styles under the geno hall.

In the past, when the geno hall appeared, it looked like the moon and flowers in a mirror. Although one was able to see it clearly, it gave people the impression that it could not be real. The geno hall and many temples that appeared now gave people a real feeling. It was like those palaces and temples were going to fall from the sky at any second.

“Sky Armor Temple… Sky Vine Radish Temple… Empty Temple…” The elites of many races saw the words appear above the doors of those temples.

All those buildings were like a giant pyramid. There were many temples at the bottom. At the very top was the geno hall, which a sky full of races knew.

Sky Palace Leader said, “It has been so many years, but the space barrier is now finally broken. The era of god fights has come. Is what happened to Sacred going to happen again?” He was standing atop his cloud palace. He looked at the old and mysterious geno hall. His expression looked very complicated.

“The space barrier is broken. Our time has come.” In the dark abyss, some scary creatures were madly roaring.

“Whatever should come has finally come.” On the streets of a small, broken planet, a fortune-teller was holding a flag. He sighed as he looked at the geno hall.

“Finally, we have waited for this day. Sacred Leader did not disappoint me after all. He did have a way. He broke the space barrier.” In a palace on a red dwarf planet, a weirdly pretty man was sitting atop a throne reserved for kings. He was looking at what was going on with sublime interest.

Lou Lie bowed and said, “Leader, the space barrier is broken. The god hall has landed. This is our best chance. Please, leader, let me fight. I can take a god temple for Blood Legion.”

The other two Blood Legion members kneeled as they shared their desire for combat. “Please, leader, let us fight.”

“There is no rush. There will be other people in more of a rush than us.” Blood Legion leader looked at the god palace in space. His eyes made it look like he was smiling.

The sound of a bird spread across space. It was staring at all the creatures looking at the geno hall. The black-feathered, giant, strange bird with nine heads ripped space as it flew. It carried an incredibly powerful and scary power as it flew toward a palace.

“Ghost Car…” Han Sen recognized what it was. The Ghost Car looked like the Ghost Car Han Sen had brought back with him, but it was not a stone element. This was the real Ghost Car.

Ghost Car was called Nine Phoenix. The legends said it was a deformity of the phoenixes. It should have been nine different babies. For some reason, nine of the baby fetuses combined and created that deformed nine-headed phoenix.

Ghost Car had a different element to the phoenix. It did not have magical nirvana phoenix flames. Its body was full of black smoke. It did not look fiery at all.

As the sky full of races looked on, Ghost Car traveled through space and came before a god palace. It was headed for the lowest layer of temples. It landed on a plaza.

“You small and insignificant creature. How dare you come to me at my god temple.” A god voice came out of the temple like thunder.

As the god voice sounded, Ghost Car’s nine heads were strangely laughed. One of the heads said, “The space barrier is broken. Gods are no longer gods. Today, I, the holy, am going to swallow your god personality. I will pull down your flag and occupy your god palace.”

After that, Ghost Car’s bird wings flapped. One of the heads was going to bite the thunder god flag inside the temple.

“How dare you!” The god voice sounded angry. It was as loud as thunder. The temple doors opened. A giant was inside. The God Spirit was surrounded by thunder. It came out from the god temple and turned into 10,000 lightning strikes that hit Ghost Car.

“Eating God Spirits is something I did a long time ago. Why would I not dare?” Ghost Car weirdly laughed. He was not scared of a sky full of thunder. The scary lightning struck him. It suddenly turned his body into dust.

The dust did not just disappear and scatter. It turned into a cloud of black smoke that went toward the giant god’s body. It wrapped up the God Spirit inside the black smoke.

All of the races saw what happened inside the god temple. The God Spirit was wrapped up by black smoke. It was uncertain what was going on.

The black smoke was rumbling in the thunder. Suddenly, a God Spirit was screaming. They thought the God Spirit’s situation must have been bad.

Not long later, the black smoke from the waves and the screaming noise was gone. One was no longer able to hear it or see it. The black smoke also disappeared and returned to the form of Ghost Car.

The giant God Spirit turned into a pile of white bones. The bones did not have a speck of flesh on them. It was like they had been eating clean by a hawk.

Pang!

The white bones broke in the wind. They turned into many thunder lights. They gathered up into a thunder trident in the air.

Ghost Car opened its mouth and sucked. It sucked the thunder trident made by the god personality. It raised its head and laughed.

In the god palace, at the top level of the geno hall, there was a familiar voice. “You beat thunder god. You only need to bring the god flag down to replace it as a new God Spirit. You can have immortal life. Are you willing to have that?”

Han Sen still remembered when Golden Growler attacked the geno hall. It was that voice.

“I go across the universe and eat whoever I want to eat. I destroy whoever I want to destroy. I will not be a measly watchdog. Today, I am full. I will be back another day for more.” Ghost Car laughed and flapped its bird wings. It turned into a cloud of black smoke and flew out of the god temple. It disappeared to someplace in space.

After seeing this, all of the creatures were frozen. Ordinary creatures did not know about Ghost Car before this. It shocked them all to see it eat a God Spirit with such ease.

Suddenly, a big beast that looked like a macaque came forth. It was headed for the god temple that Ghost Car had flown away from. It made its way before it with its giant claws moving to grab the giant god flag inside the temple.

The giant macaque said, “It might not want to be a god, but I do! Let me be an immortal God Spirit.” It was full of burning desire. Its hand was going to touch the god flag, but it suddenly heard the god temple’s door open. A God Spirit came out from the god temple. Its body danced with thunder. It flew out and turned the big macaque into dust.

All the creatures saw the God Spirit come out from the god temple. It looked the same as the God Spirit that was eaten by Ghost Car. They were all shocked. “Is that really an undying God Spirit?”

Han Sen had known about all this a long time ago. God Spirits in god temples were immortal and could not die permanently. He was not surprised.

“Qin Xiu! Qin Xiu! I suppose I lost this round.” Han Sen looked at the crystal disc and jade statue that had become a pillar of light. He had a wry smile as he put out the five lanterns and picked up the stone lanterns that no longer had a light.

He was planning on breaking Sacred Leader’s plan, hoping to let Littleflower be away from Sacred Leader’s game. Who knew he had fallen right into what Sacred Leader always had planned? He helped Sacred Leader break the space barrier. He had become a chess piece that helped the god palaces show up.
