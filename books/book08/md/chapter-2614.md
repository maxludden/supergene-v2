  Upon seeing this, many Sky Palace elites frowned. Although Sky Path wouldn’t allow anyone to use their powers, provoking the holy vine like that wasn’t a good thing. If Han Yan made the holy vine mad, it wouldn’t go well for her.

Sky Palace Leader felt a headache coming on. “Why must the Han family always be like this? Don’t they have a decent leader to instill good behavior into them? This girl is going to be an enormous pain in the *ss for Old Ten.” Yun Changkong’s face was conflicted. Before today, he never thought that he would end up taking someone like this as his only student. He didn’t know if he should cry or laugh at the sight.

Sixth Elder was laughing so hard, and he said, “This Han Yan… is so interesting… Old Ten, you are going to be in a lot of trouble!”

Then, the Sixth Elder’s laughter stopped abruptly. He was still smiling, but his features seemed to have frozen in place. His eyes were wide.

His face had changed expression so fast that laughter and shock occupied his expression at the same time. It made the Sixth Elder look very weird. Yun Changkong was about to reply to the Sixth Elder, but when he saw the other man’s horrified expression, he spun back to look at the holy gourd.

When his eyes found the holy gourd, Yun Changkong felt like his heart stopped. His eyes bulged slightly as he stared in disbelief.

The two elders weren’t the only ones who were shocked. The whole of Sky Palace had fallen quiet.

A teacup hung forgotten from Sky Palace Leader’s fingers. He had been about to take a sip when his entire body grew still. His face looked as if he had laid eyes on a ghost.

Han Yan still held the gourd in her hands. A thin stem had once connected the gourd to the vine, but now, that stem was broken. Han Yan had managed to pick the gourd off the vine.

The nobles of Sky Palace were shocked. They didn’t believe what they were seeing. They had never dreamed that the gourds could be picked like this.

Over the history of Sky Palace, a few people had attempted to pick a gourd from the vine. None of them had been ordinary students, though; they were deified elites.

And those deified elites hadn’t merely been trying to obtain some holy air like Han Yan was. They wanted the vines and the gourds to craft deified treasures.

It was impossible to tear a gourd loose by force. Even if the Sky Palace Leader wanted a holy gourd, he needed to perform a special ritual and provide treasures that would provide energy to the holy vine. If the holy vine was in a good mood, it might give out a holy gourd.

At that time, Sky Palace had seventeen treasures made from holy gourds. They were all deified weapons. The most powerful holy gourd treasure was a scary butterfly level weapon.

Of course, some holy gourds had failed when the Sky tried to shape them into weapons. They weren’t included in this number.

But everyone knew, regardless of all that, that the holy vine was a terrifying being. Even though Sky Palace had many deifieds, none of them would dare to mistreat it. Forcing a holy gourd off the vine had only been accomplished by two people in the entire history of Sky Palace.

However, Han Yan was just a Duke. She hadn’t sacrificed anything in the vine’s honor; she had just lackadaisically collected the gourd from the vine. It was very hard to believe. Everyone looked at Han Yan like she was insane.

Han Yan was so happy. And she thought to herself, “It looks like you really can take a holy gourd from this vine. If the holy gourd has holy air, I must take it back with me to research. I won’t be able to open the gourd now, but after I become stronger, I’ll find a way to break open the gourd and collect the holy air within.”

“Right. I have heard each person can only walk across Sky Path once. Let me get one for Big Brother and another one for Bao’er,” Han Yan thought to herself. She put the gourd in her bag and looked at the small gourds next to her.

Han Yan was worried that if she tried to pick a gourd that was too big, she might not be able to collect it. So, she took the small ones instead.

“What is she doing?” Sky Palace Leader stared at Han Yan with worried eyes. He felt terrible. He almost leaped out of his seat when he saw Han Yan reach for an additional gourd.

As Han Yan reached out and picked another gourd off the vine, she said to herself, “One for Big Brother. One for Bao’er. One for Meng’er. And one for our princess Ling’er. Oh, and one for Littleflower.”

The holy gourds, which not even deifieds could harm, were plucked one by one. Han Yan collected them from the vine like she was picking grapes. She picked three or four. And after this, Sky Palace Leader’s eyes turned green.

The elders, butlers, officers, and ordinary students of Sky Palace were all dumbfounded. They couldn’t speak. They watched with gaping mouths as Han Yan in her super god spirit body picked the gourds off the vine.

“This… this… How is this possible? Why is the vine not reacting to her? How can it allow a Duke to collect its holy gourds…” The Sixth Elder rubbed his eyes hard. He thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, and he had been struck with some foul hallucination.

Yun Changkong turned back to the Sixth Elder. His heart was screaming with joy. He tried to play it cool, but his lips were still curled up at the edges. Everyone knew he was trying to hold in his laughter. “Brother Sixth, my student is quite foolish. She couldn’t even get a holy gourd air on Sky Path, so she had to go and pick it up for herself. That is really silly… Hahaha!” After saying that, Yun Changkong began to laugh until tears rolled down his face.

A holy gourd could be used as the base for a deified weapon. The process of crafting such a weapon often failed, and other rare materials were required to supplement it, but a holy gourd was priced equally with a primitive deified xenogeneic gene. Seeing Han Yan pick up the fourth gourd and place it in her satchel, Sky Palace Leader found himself incapable of sitting still any longer. He got up and spoke aloud.

“Han Yan… hurry up and enter the Sky Palace Door. Stop loitering!” a voice boomed and echoed across Sky Palace. It was only in Han Yan’s ear, though. No others could hear it.

Han Yan was a smart person. When she heard that, she knew she wouldn’t be allowed to collect any more gourds. She felt that was quite a shame, and she thought to herself, “I didn’t get one for Littleflower.”

But Han Yan didn’t remain by the vine any longer. She took her bag of gourds and left Sky Path. She headed to the Sky Palace Door.“Were my eyes playing tricks on me? I think Han Yan took four holy gourds,” one student asked with great confusion. He looked as if he had just woken up from a deep slumber.

“I thought I saw that, too.”

“It must be Brother Han’s sister. I want to know if he would like a brother-in-law.”

“The women of the Han family are scarier than Brother Han. His daughter made the gourds shiver, and his sister was able to just grab them off the vine.”

“That was so weird. Why do the holy gourds treat the Han family so nicely? The vine let Han Yan collect the holy gourds without reacting at all.”

“This family… All of them are so strong!” “Are you stupid? If the holy vine wasn’t willing to let the gourds go, do you think a Duke could have picked them?”

“I don’t know about all the other ramifications of what just happened, but I do know that Sister Han earned a lot. Four holy gourds can make four deified weapons.”

“Uncle Han, please take me…”
