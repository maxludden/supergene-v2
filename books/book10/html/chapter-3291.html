<p>This was a voice Han Sen was no stranger to. In the past,
Ancient God’s Water God attacked the geno hall. The master of this
voice suppressed the assault.</p>
<p>When Golden Growler attacked the geno hall, the master of that
voice appeared there as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen peered through the god light. He saw a woman standing
there. Under the 10,000 race lamps, it made her look very holy and
pure. It was like the entire world should obey that figure.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the goddess and asked, “Are you talking to
me?”</p>
<p>The goddess smiled. “Aside from you and the geno hall, are there
any other creatures around?”</p>
<p>“I do not think I am familiar with you.” Han Sen looked at the
goddess and asked, “Why are you waiting for me?”</p>
<p>“You know I am an unclean goddess,” the goddess coldly said.
“How could you not know who I am?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. “I am afraid there might have been a
misunderstanding. I have never seen you before. How am I supposed
to know whether or not you’re pure?”</p>
<p>“If there is no light, there is no darkness. Light and dark are
two sides of the same coin. Light God is not holy. Did you not say
something like that before?” The goddess looked as if she was
smiling, but she wasn’t smiling.</p>
<p>“Are you Light Goddess?” Han Sen now knew the identity of the
goddess. He developed a wry smile. It was always awkward for a
person to find out someone was talking about them behind their back
and confront them.</p>
<p>“According to what you have just said, you can call me Dark
Goddess,” Light Goddess emotionlessly said.</p>
<p>“Light and dark is a necessary component of the universe. I
cannot deny that.” Han Sen felt as if he was not very good at
explaining things. He coughed and changed the subject. “I want to
see the leader of this hall. Is he in today?”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen tried peeking into the hall. Aside from the
10,000 race lanterns, there was nothing else to see. He did not
know if God Hall Leader was in there or not.</p>
<p>“He is not in,” Light Goddess said. “For this year in the
universe, I am the one tasked with protecting the geno hall. If you
want to see him, I recommend that you come back another time.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Light Goddess was a trustworthy person. If God
Hall Leader knew he was there, he would have come. Otherwise,
unless the God Hall Leader did not want to see him, he would have
been the one to go there.</p>
<p>If God Hall Leader really did not want to see him, it was
pointless even if he insisted.</p>
<p>“If God Hall Leader is not here, might it be possible for me to
ask for your help.” Han Sen had to take a step back.</p>
<p>“Your body has already become a spirit. You are like an empty
spirit. Aside from reincarnating, you cannot become human again. If
you want, I can send you through the geno hall to reincarnate.”
Light Goddess clearly understood why Han Sen had come to see her.
So, she was honest with him.</p>
<p>“If I reincarnate, can I still keep the memories of my past
life?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“That is impossible,” Light Goddess replied with certainty.</p>
<p>If Han Sen could not keep his memories, he did not want to
reincarnate. To be reborn with an empty soul was not far off from
dying.</p>
<p>“Is there any other way?” Han Sen quietly asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” That surprised Han Sen. Light Goddess’s answer was spoken
with strong confidence.</p>
<p>“If you are saying there is another way, then why did you just
tell me there was no other way a moment ago?” Han Sen thought, but
he did not actually say it out loud.</p>
<p>After all, Han Sen needed her help. He couldn’t offend her.</p>
<p>Light Goddess seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. She
coldly said, “I said there was no other way aside from
reincarnating if you wanted to be a human again. When I tell you
there is another way, there is another way. It just means you won’t
be a human.”</p>
<p>“Not be human? Do you want me to be a God Spirit?” Han Sen’s
heart jumped.</p>
<p>Light Goddess nodded and said, “Yeah. You have a pure spirit
body. Aside from reincarnating, you cannot be a human again. You
can, however, become a God Spirit.”</p>
<p>“What is the difference between a God Spirit and my current
shape?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“Of course, there is a difference,” Light Goddess said. “Right
now, aside from your situation that involves your past memories,
you are like an empty spirit. Before you reincarnate, you will not
have a connection to this world. You cannot touch anything that
exists here, and no one can hear or see you. According to the
theory, you are still alive, but your current status is not all
that different from you being dead. If you want to become a God
Spirit, you can make a god base. With a god base, you can make a
god body again. If you do that, you will become someone like
me.”</p>
<p>“This might be a silly thing to ask, but if I become a God
Spirit, what level of God Spirit will I become?” Han Sen squinted
his eyes as he peered at Light Goddess.</p>
<p>Light Goddess did not hesitate to answer. “You are the master of
the God of Wealth Temple. You can use the God of Wealth Temple to
become a god. You will be the 13th Annihilation-class main
god.”</p>
<p>“After I become a God Spirit, what will I need to do?” Han Sen
did not want to become a God Spirit.</p>
<p>He was just a common man. He wanted the life of a commoner. He
did not want to sit in a god temple all day.</p>
<p>“You must protect the geno hall and keep the universe in order,”
Light Goddess answered.</p>
<p>“If I become a real God Spirit, can I choose not to do that?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Light Goddess’s answer made Han Sen a happy chap, but
Light Goddess added, “But Annihilation main gods are different than
the average God Spirit. If the geno hall is destroyed, your god
bases will be destroyed. If you do not mind that happening, then
you will not have to do anything.”</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly thought about the Sky God Crown he already had.
He thought about how becoming the master of the God of Wealth
Temple was one grand setup for this.</p>
<p>He looked at Light Goddess, turned around, and ran.</p>
<p>If he was to become a God Spirit, he could live. That solution
was not any better than his current condition.</p>
<p>Light Goddess saw Han Sen leave in a hurry. She was shocked by
this sudden change, but she did not want to stop him from escaping.
In a short amount of time, he was gone.</p>
<p>The geno hall’s doors closed. The spirits going there like mad
returned to normal.</p>
<p>Light Goddess walked to an altar. She placed a right on her
chest and bowed before the leader of the geno hall. “Mister, it is
just as you said. Han Sen did choose to leave. If you were so sure
about this, do you think he is going to do that?”</p>
<p>“No matter how small the chance is, a chance is a chance,” God
Hall Leader said with a smile. “It is better than no chance.”</p>
<p>“Spirits have existed here for 10 million years, but no one has
been this shocking before. If he can fight against Qin Xiu, you
have to know that Qin Xiu is…” Light Goddess had to stop talking.
She sounded as if she had just misspoken. She lowered her head and
apologized.</p>
<p>“His spirit is normal,” God Hall Leader coldly said. “It was
always normal. But in this life, he has a chance to not be
normal.”</p>
