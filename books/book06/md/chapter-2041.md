  When Han Sen had lived in the Alliance, he had been good in the water. After spending several months in the Dream Lake, his talents underwater only improved. He had become so proficient that he could

swim easily, even if he was tied up.

The last of the Spiky Turtles vanished into the

Dragon Pool, and Han Sen was the first to jump in after

them. Dragon Fifteen invited Xius to jump into the pool

after Han Sen. Then Dragon Fifteen’s maid, Long Ying,

followed Dragon Fifteen into the water.

Han Sen did not show off his abilities, though. He

pretended to use a godlight to swim.

Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying were also comfortable in the water, performing just as well in the water as on land. They were Dragons, after all.

Xius swam behind them, her snake tail sending her

smoothly through the water.

“Pure Dragons are strong,” Han Sen thought. “Dragon Fifteen and Xius are both Marquises, so Dragon Fifteen will be stronger than Dragon Thirteen was. That Long Ying is more powerful than either of them, though. She must be a Duke. There is no way!

could beat them in battle.”

The pool did not seem large from the outside, but

it was like a bowl turned upside down. It got wider

towards the bottom. Han Sen could see many Spiky

Turtles swimming beneath them. Down there, even the giant Duke class turtles did not look very big.

The pool was deep, and Han Sen could not see

very much. He couldn’t see what might have been so

alluring, so he just followed the turtles down.

Dragon Fifteen and Xius were not in a rush, and they simply followed Han Sen. They could talk underwater, so they didn’t even need to rely on clumsy

hand signals.

The deeper they swam, the darker it became.

When they were ten thousand meters down, however, a

light appeared. It was like the light at the end of the

tunnel.

Han Sen had never been there before, so he had

no idea what the light was.

“Does this pool lead someplace else? Is it going back to the Ancient God space?” he wondered.

Han Sen swiftly realized that he was incorrect. The light was not an exit. As they went deeper, the blurry light resolved itself into an object. At the bottom of the

pool, there was a large palace.

Han Sen didn’t know what material the palace was

made of, but it gleamed with blue light. The radiance lit

up the entire underwater world like some fairytale.

But the fairytale palace had mostly collapsed. It was in disarray, little more than a ruin. The turtles, however, accelerated as they saw it.

Han Sen looked around, but he did not catch a

glimpse of the Dragon God. The thought that it was

gone made him feel safer, so he followed the Spiky

Turtles towards the palace.

Upon drawing closer to the palace, he realized that

the palace was far bigger than he had originally

thought. A single pillar was dozens of meters tall.

Han Sen looked over the palace, eventually picking out a stone table that was very large. Several human adults could lie flat on the table without covering its surface. It clearly belonged to a civilization that was

neither human nor Dragon.

The bodies of the Dragon were quite similar to

humans. They would have no reason to produce a relic

of that size.

“What is this palace?” Dragon Fifteen asked Han

Sen.

Han Sen shook his head, and he pretended to choke on water as he tried to answer. Then, using a godlight to clear the water away from his mouth, he said, “I don’t know. I told you, the Dragon God brought me here. I don’t know anything about this place. There is nothing I can do to prove it if you do not believe me.”

Dragon Fifteen stopped asking. He had forced Han Sen to swim down with them because he found Han Sen suspicious, not because he really wanted Han Sen to lead them. He couldn’t leave Han Sen alone, and he

had to keep a watchful eye on him. It was the safest

thing to do.

Xius, looking at the palace, said, “Fifteen, the legends say that the Return Ruin Sea belongs to the sea gods from the xenogeneic space. Is that true?”

Dragon Fifteen raised an eyebrow. “When the Dragon took over Return Ruin Sea, we didn’t find

evidence of any sea gods. I don’t know if myths about

them are true, for I’ve never discovered any sea god relics before. You seem to know a lot, though. Can you tell me if the palace is related to the conundrum of the sea gods?”

Xius smiled and said, “The sea gods are a higher race, according to the legends. They fell a long time ago, however, so no one knows much about them. There are bits and bobs lying around, scattered, in faint

remembrance for their past existence. The ruins found

prior to this were far smaller and less significant,

though. Judging from the architecture, this really does seem similar to the style of the sea gods. I cannot be one hundred percent certain, of course.”

As they held their discussion, the Spiky Turtles

reached the palace. Their purpose there was clear. They did not travel around the palace in search of something. Like arrows, they went straight past the palace to one ruin in particular.

Many Spiky Turtles stopped at a ruin that looked like a mountain. They floated in the water. When the giant Spiky Turtle brought the Turtle King there, the Turtle King squealed. The rest of the turtles surrounded the ruin and started to dig through the mound of rubble.

The rocks were the same unknown blue material.

Whatever they were, they must have been very hard, as

not even the Duke turtles could break them. They had

to just displace them, instead.

All the turtles got busy moving the rocks away. Han Sen and the others stopped some distance

from the palace and watched the turtles dig through

the ruins. They did not make a move.

The army of turtles quickly dug through the rubble, and something became visible beneath the collapsed ruin. As more and more of the rocks were moved away, the object became clearer.

Beneath the mountain of rubble was a statue of a

sea turtle. It was a very strange sea turtle, though. It

seemed to be standing on two feet, and it was clad in a

weird set of armor. A circular helmet rested on the sea

turtle’s head, and it held a hammer in each of its

claws.

That statue was a dozen meters tall. It was very strange, but it seemed to be made from the same blue rock. The weirdest thing was the biped turtle that it

depicted.

As Han Sen observed the statue, the rest of the

turtles stopped moving. The Turtle King screamed, and the rest of the turtles lay down below it. It looked as if

they were kowtowing.

The Spiky Turtle King floated down from the giant turtle’s head and swam over to the sea turtle statue.

“Are those turtles related to the statue? Are they

blood related?” Long Ying asked with surprise.

“That might be a possibility.” Xius was looking at

the statue and the Turtle King.

Long Ying wished to say something more, but the

Turtle King had reached the statue. The plate-sized black body landed atop the helmet of the turtle statue.
