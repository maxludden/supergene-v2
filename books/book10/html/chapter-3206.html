	<p>Back in the geno universe, Ling’er sat upon a stool in Space Garden. She placed her hands up against her jaw to
		cradle it and stared up into the sky to daydream. “Little Ling’er, did you miss Brother Yuhang?” A man
		approached her with a smile on his face. He smiled at Ling’er.</p>

	<p>“Grandad Yuhang! You have come back so quickly.” Ling’er looked at Wang Yuhang with surprise.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang’s face looked dim. “I told you that you should call me Brother Yuhang. You are still calling me a
		grandad. Am I really that old?”</p>

	<p>“But they say my father called you an uncle,” Ling’er said with a blink of her eyes.</p>

	<p>“We are not related, so it does not matter,” Wang Yuhang said. “Our relationship has nothing to do with them. You
		should just keep calling me Brother Yuhang.” “By the way, is Littleflower here? Where is he?” Wang Yuhang asked.
		“Brother Littleflower is with Big Sister Meng’er, Big Sister Zero, and Big Sister Little Sky,” Ling’er
		explained. “They have gone to Outer Sky. They heard Mirror Lake has something new going on there.”</p>

	<p>“That is fantastic that they found something new,” Wang Yuhang said as he rubbed his fists. “I cannot wait to go
		to the anti-material world. I want to see how Han Sen is doing.”</p>

	<p>After saying that, Wang Yuhang readied himself to leave Space Garden. He was going to go to Mirror Lake. After
		taking two steps, a hand grabbed his sleeves.</p>

	<p>“Big Brother Yuhang, can you take me to Outer Sky? I want to go see Mirror Lake as well.” Ling’er looked at Wang
		Yuhang with a pity-filled face.</p>

	<p>“No way,” Wang Yuhang said with a shake of his head. “You are too small. It is too dangerous for you to go over
		there.” He did not want to take this princess to such a place.</p>

	<p>If something happened to her, all the creatures of Space Garden would want to bite a chunk out of him.</p>

	<p>“Brother Yuhang, are you not going to bring me?” Ling’er looked at Wang Yuhang with sadness in her eyes and
		blinked.</p>

	<p>“Cough. Cough. I really am busy. I don’t have the time for that. Now, please put me down.” Wang Yuhang struggled
		with his words and his body. Nothing he tried could help him escape. It was like an invisible rope had tied him
		up.</p>

	<p>“Take me or stay here and play with me,” Ling’er said with a smile.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang looked angry and asked, “Little Ling’er, how could you do something like this to me? I am your
		grandad, Yuhang. Did your mother not teach you to respect your elders? Ling’er is supposed to be a good child,
		so stop messing about and put me down.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, my mother taught me to respect elders, but you said you are Brother Yuhang and not Grandad Yuhang,” Ling’er
		said as she blinked her eyes.</p>

	<p>“Fine! Fine! Fine! I will play with you. What would you like to play? Big Brother Yuhang is going to play.” Wang
		Yuhang was very angry, but he could not fight back. He had to blame himself for being stupid earlier. “Let’s
		play your favorite game, Little Six, shall we?” Ling’er clapped her hands. The Six-Ear Macaque came running
		over. It ran right in front of her.</p>

	<p>After hearing Ling’er’s words, the Six-Ear Macaque’s eyes were bright as it looked at Wang Yuhang</p>

	<p>“What do you want? Don’t come any closer!” Wang Yuhang looked at the Six-Ear Macaque, which did not look nice. It
		felt as if something was wrong. He felt very bad.</p>

	<p>Not many people were at Outer Sky’s Mirror Lake, but a giant laboratory had been built there.</p>

	<p>Many people were seriously examining the screen inside the building. Many people were controlling all sorts of
		tools.</p>

	<p>Xie Qing King could not help but ask, “Sister Yufei, what is going on here?” She did not understand all the data
		streams and what the machines were doing.</p>

	<p>Over the past few months, Mirror Lake had been exhibiting many weird events. The whole Outer Sky was affected.
	</p>

	<p>The Very High had been unable to find out why. They asked the elites of Space Garden to help out. That was why
		Han Yufei had built a lab near Mirror Lake. In fact, across the whole of Space Garden, only Han Yufei was good
		at this. Everyone else was useless.</p>

	<p>Han Yufei kept looking at the data and said, “Judging from the data and the information I am receiving, over the
		past three months, the anti-material movements of Mirror Lake have become stronger. The anti-material springs
		are going off more often. It used to be once every four or five days. Now, it is happening two or three times a
		day.”</p>

	<p>“What does that mean?” Xie Qing King asked.</p>

	<p>“According to the data, there are two possibilities. One possibility is that the anti-material world is
		undergoing some weird changes. The buffer zone between the two worlds has been impacted, so that is why there
		have been these changes.” Han Yufei paused. She looked excited as she went on to say, “One possibility is that
		there is a power breaking the barrier between the two near Mirror Lake.”</p>

	<p>When everyone heard that, their faces changed. Someone happily asked, “Is Big Brother coming back from the
		anti-material world?”</p>

	<p>Han Yufei shook her head. “According to the information given to us by the Very High, this movement already
		existed, but it was weak and did not affect anywhere else in Outer Sky. Therefore, no one gave it any attention.
		I am sure that it has not been going on just in the past few years. So, it probably isn’t Han Sen.”</p>

	<p>“Does that mean those creatures in the anti-material world are going to try and break through Mirror Lake and
		enter our world?” Xie Qing King asked with shock.</p>

	<p>“So far, that is the most plausible theory,” Han Yufei replied. “If the veil is broken, what might happen?” Xie
		Qing King asked with a serious look of concern.</p>

	<p>“I do not know,” Han Yufei said with her eyes glowing. “The one thing I do know for sure is that when the two
		worlds are connected, we can feel the power of the two worlds straight away. Perhaps we can be our race’s elite
		Tai Yi and have the two world powers to become break world elites.”</p>

	<p>Xie Qing King’s eyes glistened as he asked Han Yufei, “What kind of power is a Break World power?”</p>

	<p>Ever since the geno hall battle, the geno universe had undergone many big changes. All the resources grew like
		crazy. Many people were able to level up and develop at a much faster rate. Xie Qing King had already reached
		the max god level. He could not go any higher.</p>

	<p>He also did not want to be a God Spirit, so he stopped, unable to improve himself any further.</p>

	<p>“I have not reached that level yet, so I do not know the proper details.” Han Yufei seemed to grow more excited
		as she said, “I only know that putting the main and second world powers into one, for the Witch, was something
		only Tai Yi managed to achieve. The reason why achieving Break World is hard is because we cannot feel the
		powers of the other world. If Mirror Lake is broken, we will be able to immediately feel the powers of the
		anti-material. That means breaking the world will be much easier.”</p>
