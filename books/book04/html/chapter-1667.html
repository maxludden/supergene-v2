    <p>
      Han Sen’s mind was like steel. He focused and did not allow the Sea of
      Soul’s discord to affect him. He punched towards Ancient Devil’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an opening for Ancient Devil, but Han Sen also thought that it
      was an opportunity. His Dongxuan Aura was not maxed out yet, and because
      of that, he was unable to place one finger on the donkey. It was best to
      end these proceedings than continue with a stalemate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fists and hands swung through the air, but there were no collisions to be
      seen. Han Sen felt as if he was powerless, like he had been sucked into an
      infinite hole. His power was being drawn, but nothing else happened. This
      drain sapped his power and nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used some of his power and realized he could not escape Ancient
      Devil’s hand. His power kept on getting sucked into Ancient Devil’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumbling inside Han Sen’s Sea of Soul was getting stronger, as well.
      Eventually, he noticed that the activity was coming from Destiny’s Tower.
      But it wasn’t the tower itself making the fuss; it was the Armored Man
      that had been trapped inside it. He was casting ice and fire spells,
      thrashing around his prison inside Destiny’s Tower. He couldn’t break the
      trappings, but it made the tower shiver and shake, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised. When Armored Man was first captured, he tried to
      break out to no avail. And in that process, he had ended up hurting
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>But ever since then, there had been no further activity from him.</p>
    <p>
      If he was causing a commotion at this moment, perhaps he knew Han Sen was
      in the midst of a fight and that there’d be no chance of containing him if
      he managed to break free.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen did not think this was the case, either. Armored Man was
      trapped inside Destiny’s Tower. He could not see what was outside that
      prison, so there shouldn’t have been a way for him to know Han Sen was in
      the middle of a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not have to think right now, though. His power was like a
      river, all going into Ancient Devil’s hands. If this were to continue,
      he’d eventually dry up his reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen summoned Bulwark Umbrella and used it to take stabs at Ancient
      Devil’s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil tried to grab the umbrella, and just like earlier, he wished
      to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bulwark Umbrella then opened up. Ancient Devil’s hand made contact
      with it and yet, there was no shockwave. None of the geno core’s power was
      absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light appeared, separating Han Sen from Ancient Devil. Ancient Devil’s
      hand was unable to absorb Han Sen’s power now, which meant his hands were
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil looked at Han Sen’s Bulwark Umbrella in immense shock. Then
      he changed his momentum, and when he did, a burst of air came out from
      him. His hands were collapsing onto Han Sen next
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned, and he saw a red light appeared around Ancient Devil. It
      was the power of Han Sen’s God geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Han Sen knew Ancient Devil could absorb the power of his enemies, and
      even make use of it. It wasn’t just that, either. Ancient Devil’s own
      power was stronger than what Han Sen was losing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he absorbed the powers of his enemies, he could put his own power
      into the element of what the enemy had been using. It was practically
      cheating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Han Sen knew why Gu Qingcheng had said Ancient Devil could make use of
      any element. It was too easy for him to make use of other elements.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil threw his palm forward at the umbrella. The umbrella curved
      like a broken drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after that, the surface bounced back into a correct position. It
      hadn’t been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil continued to slap the umbrella, as a red light doused the
      entire area. The umbrella was repeatedly curved, expelling thunderous
      noises. But no matter how strong Ancient Devil’s powers were, he could not
      break a gemstone class umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation had been changed. Han Sen had initially been attacking, but
      now Ancient Devil was on the offensive. Han Sen used Bulwark Umbrella to
      block each and every attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The umbrella is strong; where did it come from?” Ghost Eagle Emperor
      looked at the Bulwark Umbrella in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil’s palm was strong, and every strike was like a red sky
      falling. Each blow deformed Han Sen’s defenses, but the umbrella still
      bounced back every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Skysword has good sword skills and a good geno core,” Elder Yin grumbled.
      He actually looked greedy when he looked at the Bulwark Umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil was suppressing Han Sen like a demon. Every palm was a
      shocking spectacle, but none of them could harm Han Sen. Everyone knew it
      was because of the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a powerful defense geno core, and many elites thought it was
      keeping him alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wonder what Skysword’s self geno core is.” Sacred’s leader frowned as
      he watched the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had used a few different geno cores, and each one was powerful.
      They couldn’t tell which one had actually come from Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one thought it was actually the Bulwark Umbrella. It was famous, but it
      was only gemstone class. They didn’t think something like that could break
      Ancient Devil’s powers.
    </p>
    <p>Sacred’s leader thought Bulwark Umbrella was a super geno core.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not expect the umbrella to be so strong, either, Ancient Devil
      had taken Han Sen’s God geno core power, and so his strikes were stronger
      than anything that Six Paths could deliver. And yet, a gemstone class
      Bulwark Umbrella was able to block it. Han Sen was shocked to see that it
      had not been damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is no wonder it is Dongxuan Sutra’s geno core. It is so strong!” Han
      Sen complimented his own blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used the defense of the umbrella to wait for the right time to
      fight back.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, Ancient Devil hadn’t used his geno cores. It had been a while
      since Han Sen went up against a strong enemy such as that, though. If he
      was unable to win, he’d use super king spirit and summon Destiny’s Tower
      to suppress Ancient Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of that, Han Sen turned his attention to the Armored Man who was
      in the tower. He was still shouting. The ice and fire powers were gunning
      like active volcanos.
    </p>
    <p>
      His body kept slamming against the barriers, but he could only shake the
      tower. That was bad, as his body kept getting cut by the vortex whenever
      he slammed into it
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard armor was unable to withstand the powers of space. He kept on
      getting cut even now. His blood was flowing like streams of white lava,
      seeping through the gaps of the armor, even. It went everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armored Man would not stop, though. It was like he had completely lost his
      mind.
