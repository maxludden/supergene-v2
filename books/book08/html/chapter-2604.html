<p>The people of Sky Palace could see the God Spirit Touch on Han
Sen’s hand. Then a red light manifested in Han Sen’s palm. It was
then that they realized what was going on.</p>
<p>“There it is! There it is! Here it comes again. It must be that
thing… you know what I’m talking about.”</p>
<p>“You jest, surely! It can’t be that thing that got Brother Han
the title of God’s Daddy.”</p>
<p>“I bet you it is. Did you know that I watched him bless Barr?
What I’m seeing here is that exact same red light.”</p>
<p>“What is this all about then? Isn’t the beetle supposed to be
testing Brother Han’s talent? Why is Brother Han helping the God
Spirit Touch evolve instead?”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re no longer testing. Brother Han’s eleven armor
talent is so strong. Did you not see the God Spirit Touch crawl
over to Han Sen? Perhaps it’s requesting his aid.”</p>
<p>“I must confess that this really is starting to become an…
interesting turn of events, to say the least…”</p>
<p>Exquisite and Bixi felt an odd swirl of emotions within their
chests. They had heard the tales of Han Sen blessing Lando and
Barr, but they thought there must have been some sort of trick to
the whole thing. There was no way Lando and Barr became deified
because of his power.</p>
<p>But the God Spirit Touch belonged to Bixi, and he knew a lot
about the little creature. He knew the God Spirit Touch would never
become deified. So, he was conflicted and confused when he saw what
Han Sen was aspiring to do.</p>
<p>Everyone was watching the God Spirit Touch in Han Sen’s and. It
was covered by a small, red light. The crystalline body started to
glow.</p>
<p>All of the red light rose from the God Spirit Touch’s body. And
its oval body grew smaller.</p>
<p>The God Spirit Touch had lived for God knew how long. The Very
High had taken it in so it could repeatedly test people. It had
absorbed the genes of many creatures, and the blood it had consumed
featured many nine armor talents across the years. And all it had
been given was for free.</p>
<p>Although the God Spirit Touch couldn’t properly absorb the genes
in the blood, it had received many benefits. With the amount of
resources it had received, it should have become deified a long
time ago.</p>
<p>But its talents were limited, and it couldn’t break through the
last stage. It stopped at half-deified. Right now, it was breaking
through like the wall was nothing more than paper. And it was all
attributed to Han Sen’s Blood-Pulse Sutra. The God Spirit Touch was
now becoming deified. Its genes no longer limited it anymore.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only cast a small amount of his Blood-Pulse Sutra to
lightly push the self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Han Sen, holding the God Spirit Touch. And
then, a light appeared out of the God Spirit Touch. It was such a
small bug, but the light from its body reached all the way up into
space. It lit up the whole system, and deifieds throughout the
system turned to look in that direction.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Amidst the light, as the bug’s body became smaller, cracks
started to form. A small crystal claw emerged.</p>
<p>And then, another crystal claw came into view. And then a body.
Through the shining light, onlookers could barely make out a
crystal butterfly starting to emerge. It flapped its wings and
happily danced around Han Sen.</p>
<p>When the crystal butterfly flapped its wings, its light became
clearer. Its substance chains became visible. The substance chains
formed together into a giant butterfly wing. It lit up the whole of
Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. Before, they thought this was awesome
because they had seen it on video. Seeing what happened through a
screen hadn’t left a terribly deep impression on them, though.</p>
<p>But now, they were seeing a creature become deified right in Han
Sen’s hands. His hands</p>
<p>ere like the hands of a god. They had an unlimited amount of
power, and they were full of magic. He could turn even trash into
the working of a miracle. It was difficult to believe.</p>
<p>As they watched Han Sen hold the deified crystal butterfly
gracefully in his hands, it was like he was the creator of God.</p>
<p>“It really became deified?” Bixi and Exquisite were more shocked
than the others. They had doubted Han Sen’s blessing powers before.
But now, he had lackadaisically made Bixi’s God Spirit Touch
deified. This power was more than Bixi and Exquisite knew what to
do with. Even the Very High elders couldn’t accomplish something
like this.</p>
<p>The God Spirit Touch had just become a crystal butterfly, and it
was now flying merrily around Han Sen’s hands. It flew around Han
Sen three times. And then, it suddenly flapped its crystal wings
and disappeared. It just vanished all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Everyone was frozen, and they all looked at Bixi. They thought
Bixi had returned it.</p>
<p>But Bixi was frozen, too. His coldness and calmness were now all
gone. He looked at Han Sen, his expression rigid. It looked as if
he was wondering where the God Spirit Touch had gone.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Bixi’s face changed. He felt as if something in his pocket had
just snapped. He felt bad. He quickly reached into his pocket. The
spell that had the God Spirit Touch’s symbol was now broken.</p>
<p>The Very High used a secret skill to tame the God Spirit Touch.
That spell was the key to its control. It was like a leash for the
creature.</p>
<p>As long as the spell was there, he could control the God Spirit
Touch, and the creature couldn’t disobey. If the master desired it,
the God Spirit Touch would suffer pain that would make the creature
wish it was dead.</p>
<p>When the God Spirit Touch became deified, Bixi hadn’t
immediately seen the problem. Now that the spell was broken, he
realized what had happened. His stomach sank. No God Spirit Touch
had become deified before this. The Very High’s secret skill was
only used on creatures that were half-deified or below. The God
Spirit Touch was a creature that was easy to control. But now that
it had become deified, it destroyed the secret skill. It became
free and ran off.</p>
<p>The God Spirit Touch wasn’t a top-class xenogeneic, but it was
very rare. Most of them were given out by Very High parents. If
Bixi lost it, he couldn’t get it back.</p>
<p>“Mr. Bixi, did you put your God Spirit Touch away?” Han Sen
looked at Bixi. The question was irrelevant, though. Judging from
the perplexed look on Bixi’s face, Han Sen knew that he hadn’t. He
knew that the God Spirit Touch had actually escaped.</p>
<p>He couldn’t openly admit it had run away, though. Bixi might try
to hold him responsible for what had happened.Bixi frowned. He
didn’t blame Han Sen for letting the God Spirit Touch escape. He
only coldly said, “The God Spirit Touch became deified when it
transformed into a butterfly. It broke my restraints and ran.”</p>
<p>The Sky Palace students, upon hearing that the God Spirit Touch
had become deified right from Bixi’s mouth, believed it now.</p>
<p>“It looks like the legends concerning you are true. Brother Han
really can bless others.”</p>
<p>“Well, duh. Of course, he can! Why else would you think Brother
Han was labeled God’s Daddy?” “This is too awesome… He is a King
class that can produce xenogeneic deifieds! That is better than
what most deifieds themselves can do!” The Sky Palace students
discussed all this happily. They felt very hopeful. If Han Sen
stayed in Sky Palace, perhaps Han Sen would be willing to bless
them sometime.</p>
<p>Many of the Sky Palace elites that saw this were feeling
flat-out strange. It had been a bewildering thing to witness, after
all. But many disregarded their confusion to simply revel in the
result. And the results made them more than happy. Still, more than
anything, there was one emotion they couldn’t deny, and that
emotion was worry.</p>
<p>Other races would take Han Sen’s abilities very seriously after
seeing this. Sky Palace would no longer be a mellow place.</p>
<p>There were the Extreme King, first of all. They no longer had a
good relationship with Sky Palace. That being said, Sky Palace
wasn’t afraid of them.</p>
<p>But now, the Very High had seen Han Sen’s power in person. It
was difficult to tell whether they would want to do something with
Han Sen or not.</p>
