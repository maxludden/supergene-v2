	<p>Night River King shouldn’t have stayed that close to Han Sen. The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s attack wouldn’t have
		been so potent if the distance between them had been greater. At such close range, Night River King had tried to
		attack Han Sen without reserving any of his strength for defense. His King class body was unable to withstand
		the noise unleashed by the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.</p>

	<p>The sound of the drum was like the sting of a scorpion tail, jabbing directly into his brain. Thinking suddenly
		became very difficult, and he felt as if his head was going to explode. Gathering the willpower necessary for
		the smallest action became almost impossible.</p>

	<p>Bao’er’s hand kept pounding the Jade Drum in a simple rhythm.</p>

	<p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Every beat of the rhythm felt like a thick needle being driven deeper
		into Night River King’s skull. He clutched his head and screamed aloud. He couldn’t control his body, and so he
		started to fall.</p>

	<p>The booming of the drum echoed through the sky. It hit the gold Bai Sema, but the shield blocked it. The noise
		couldn’t hurt Han Yan and the others, who were still safely ensconced in the shield.</p>

	<p>Han Sen followed along with the rhythm to slash Night River King. The powerful beats of the drum didn’t affect
		him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s blood, which possessed the power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, had sunk deep into the Blood Scorpion Jade
		Drum. Although he couldn’t totally control the Jade Drum yet, some of his blood had merged into the Blood
		Scorpion. A connection was beginning to form between the two.</p>

	<p>The Blood Scorpion believed Han Sen was a part of it, so it had decided not to hurt him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wielded his knife like a ravaging demon. He stood directly over Night River King and slashed the Rebate’s
		neck over and over. The knife let out a shrieking metal noise every time it struck, and a light mark began to
		split the neck.</p>

	<p>But that wasn’t Night River King’s biggest problem. Bao’er’s drum went on and on, and as long as it continued to
		beat, Night River King would be unable to fight back. He clutched his head, and he was soon bleeding from every
		orifice.</p>

	<p>Han Sen kept striking the same spot, making the wound a little larger with every blow. The purple knife air was
		scarier than ever.</p>

	<p>If one slash didn’t work, then a hundred slashes were sure to. If a hundred slashes didn’t work, though, then it
		would take a thousand slashes. It didn’t matter how tough Night River King’s body was; he would have a limit,
		and Han Sen would find it. Night River King wouldn’t be able to withstand those cuts forever.</p>

	<p>An ordinary Marquise couldn’t even cut the skin of a King, but Han Sen’s knife air was so strong that he could
		destroy far more than a normal Marquise could. Not even Dukes could compete with him.</p>

	<p>And Teeth powers also had a tearing force. As Han Sen slashed the wound, he let that teeth power build up. The
		purple wound became deeper and deeper, while the tearing force became stronger and stronger.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei was still standing inside the Bai Sema. She watched as Han Sen began cutting into Night River King’s
		neck, as the blood began to spill. The scene left her speechless.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had given her many surprises, and he had proven himself to possess both confidence and a fine sense of
		judgment. He had a shield that could withstand the blow of a deified enemy, and on top of that, he had a Jade
		Drum that could leave a King class elite dazed and disoriented. All of Han Sen’s possessions made the Extreme
		King queen jealous.</p>

	<p>If Bai Wei wanted a King or deified weapon, she could get them easily.</p>

	<p>But having such a weapon would matter little. She was just a Marquise, and she couldn’t utilize the full powers
		of a deified weapon. It would be pointless for her to have one.</p>

	<p>However, Han Sen’s tri-colored shield could be used by a Marquise, and it could block deified attacks. It was
		difficult to imagine what sort of treasure that was.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei recognized the Jade Drum, too. Even though the Jade Drum was King class, she couldn’t strike the Jade
		Drum in the same way Bao’er was able to. She could never deliver such an impact against a King class opponent.
	</p>

	<p>Even more frightening, the person using the Jade Drum to unleash such devastating attacks was just a child. She
		looked like a five-year-old kid.</p>

	<p>Han Sen kept slashing, and eventually, Night River King’s neck was cut open. Blood spilled out freely, and even
		the bone was marked by his blows.</p>

	<p>Han Sen slashed at it endlessly. The Teeth power was sinking in the bone, ripping at it. Marks covered the bone
		now.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>Han Sen slashed again, and his Ghost Teeth Knife split the bone open. Night River King’s head dangled.</p>

	<p>Night River King had been dazed by the drum, and he couldn’t fight back. Blood trailed from his eyes, nose, and
		mouth.</p>

	<p>Han Sen waved for Bao’er to stop hitting the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. He looked at the half-dead Night River
		King. “Who sent you to kill me?”</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t believe Night River King had the pull to come to Planet Ice Blue and attempt to assassinate him
		alone. If Night River King owned the Ancient God statuette, he wouldn’t have saved it for that day.</p>

	<p>Night River King had wanted to kill Han Sen long before they left with the Extreme King.</p>

	<p>Han Sen already knew the answer, but he still wanted to confirm it.</p>

	<p>Night River King’s neck was in the process of breaking, and the Teeth powers were tearing ever deeper into the
		wound. As his grievous wounds deepened, he lay on the ground, completely immobile. His face was bleeding, and
		his eyes were starting to close.</p>

	<p>“No… don’t… kill… me…” Night River King’s eyes turned white as he mumbled. He had blood leaking out of his mouth,
		so his words were garbled.</p>

	<p>“Who sent you to kill me?” Han Sen repeated his question.</p>

	<p>“In… Inspector… Don’t kill me…” Night River King’s words were clear enough to remove all doubt.</p>

	<p>Upon hearing what the man said, Han Sen just slashed. He severed Night River King’s neck that was still being
		devoured by his Teeth power.</p>

	<p>Night River King’s head rolled away. A King class elite had been killed.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had needed to know who was behind all of this, but no good would come from keeping Night River King
		alive. His word alone wouldn’t be strong enough to take down Edward.</p>

	<p>Edward might have had more opportunity to distort the truth if Night River King was left alive. Saving Night
		River King would have been possible.</p>

	<p>After killing Night River King, Han Sen looted the corpse. There were two King class Moon Wheel Blades to take,
		and a bunch of other things as well. But these weren’t beast souls that could go in his Sea of Soul; Han Sen had
		to physically carry them. He was already carrying many of his own things, so there was a limit to how much he
		could take.</p>

	<p>The two Moon Wheel Blades had to be extraordinarily expensive. He should be able to swap them and some of the
		other items for King class xenogeneic genes.</p>

	<p>After killing Night River King, Han Sen couldn’t search anymore. So, he destroyed the camera and took Night River
		King’s body back to base.</p>

	<p>Han Sen blamed Night River King for destroying the camera, and that excuse managed to save him a lot of trouble.
	</p>

	<p>Ice Blue Knight King was enraged upon Han Sen’s return. It wasn’t because Night River King had sought to kill Han
		Sen, though; he was angry because Bai Wei had almost been killed.</p>
