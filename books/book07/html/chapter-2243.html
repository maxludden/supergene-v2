<p>Han Sen looked around the cave, but he couldn’t find another
exit. He wasn’t in much of a rush, though. He released Little Star
from Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>“Little Star, let’s see how you do here.” Han Sen leaped atop
Little Star.</p>
<p>“Ookini Ookini!” Little Star bellowed. Starlight began to glow
softly from its form as its body—and Han Sen’s—started to become
transparent. Then, it raced into the stone.</p>
<p>Little Star had only been gone for ten minutes when Edward
appeared in the mouth of the cave. After he entered, he had a look
around.</p>
<p>“Not here?” Edward frowned. He was confident in the logical
process that had led him there. It took him by surprise when Han
Sen was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“This guy is a lot of trouble to deal with. Every creature
leaves traces of their presence, even if it is only a couple of
molecules. He hasn’t left behind anything, however. How has he
managed to do something like that?” Edward frowned as he continued
poking around.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t found Han Sen, Edward felt certain that his
quarry had indeed entered this cave.</p>
<p>“My lead comes to a dead-end here. It looks as if I will have to
find him by another means,” Edward observed to himself, looking
around the nest. He looked at one of the walls and then took his
leave.</p>
<p>With Little Star’s help, Han Sen had traveled directly through
the stone. Together, they must have gone at least a few hundred
miles before reaching another underground cave.</p>
<p>Han Sen let Little Star rest for a bit while he went to look
around the cave.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Edward will be able to find me anytime soon, but
regardless, I cannot emerge just yet. I need to find out what is so
special about that stone plate.” Han Sen looked around. That cavern
they had found was a segment of a complicated subterranean
complex.</p>
<p>That area was devoid of xenogeneics, so Han Sen settled in to
rest for a while. As he leaned back against a comfortable
outcropping of stone, he thought about how he might proceed.</p>
<p>“The stone plate seems to be something of tremendous value, and
very few people know what powers it holds. Some of the
upper-echelon of the Extreme King might know, but at the very
least, King Bai doesn’t seem to be aware of it. If he was, Ice Blue
Knight King wouldn’t have risked disobeying his orders. Sending me
back to the Extreme King means giving the stone plate to King Bai.”
Han Sen was deep in thought when he suddenly heard a sound coming
from deeper within the stone cave. It sounded as if something was
crawling around.</p>
<p>Han Sen peered into the cave with his Dongxuan Aura activated.
He detected a lifeforce was getting closer to his position.</p>
<p>The lifeforce didn’t seem to be very strong, though, and that
helped settle Han Sen’s nerves.</p>
<p>The noise was getting closer, and a few minutes later, Han Sen
saw a weird xenogeneic appear in the cave.</p>
<p>A body covered in sleek black fur appeared. It looked
startlingly smooth, and its fur glistened. It was about the size of
a cat, and its eyes were huge, like shiny pieces of black jewelry.
It looked like a big-eyed thief.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the xenogeneic, and the xenogeneic looked back
at him. They both stared at each other for a while.</p>
<p>Then, the xenogeneic just ignored him. It turned to saunter down
another stone path. Its butt wiggled as it walked, waving its tail
in a slow rhythm.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised an eyebrow, as the creature’s tail seemed to be
holding an item that looked like a bracelet.</p>
<p>It was odd to see the piece of platinum attached to the
creature’s tail, rather than being held in the creature’s claws. It
looked like the item had been deliberately placed there,
though.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to take a closer look, and
he noticed there were a few words inscribed across the item.</p>
<p>“Sacred General Ghost Bone.” Han Sen’s eyes widened, and he made
the decision to follow that little critter.</p>
<p>“Is that thing related to General Ghost Bone, by any chance? It
doesn’t seem nearly strong enough. At the very most, that thing is
no greater than a Viscount. If General Ghost Bone wanted a pet, I
doubt he would select something that was so weak.” Han Sen wasn’t
in a rush to take down the little beast, and so he just trailed
after it.</p>
<p>The little beast showed no sign that it was afraid of him.
Without pausing, it meandered its way down a series of caves. It
wasn’t in a hurry, and its pace was quite lackadaisical.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed it patiently down the tunnels. And the whole
time, he had many thoughts going through his mind. “That ancient
city was called Ghost Bone Town, but the Ghost Bone statue there
was just like a guard for the gate. Inside the hall of the palace,
there was a statue of that Human King. The top of the Human King
Statue is what pedestaled the stone plate. What does that mean, I
wonder?”</p>
<p>After the beast had been traveling for about an hour, it reached
a hidden river. It crouched down on its stomach so it could drink
some water.</p>
<p>“This guy has walked so far. Surely he didn’t come all this way
for a drink of water,” Han Sen thought in agitation.</p>
<p>Eventually, the beast seemed to have drunk its fill. Without any
warning, it leaped into the dark river. It lay on its back in the
water like an otter, floating down with the stream.</p>
<p>Han Sen put Little Star away and followed after it.</p>
<p>But soon, the underground river sank into the ground. The
creature sank into it, as well. Han Sen gritted his teeth and
jumped into the water. He used his Purple-Eye Butterfly as he
followed after the creature.</p>
<p>The underground water was fast-flowing, and it was fortunate
that Han Sen didn’t encounter any water element xenogeneics. Han
Sen followed it for a few hundred miles, but there seemed to be no
end in sight.</p>
<p>After an interminable time in the water, the floating beast
suddenly swam towards a wall.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked towards it, and there, he saw a small tunnel
leading through the stone wall. The hole was around the size of a
melon, and the creature wriggled its way in without much
trouble.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too big, so he couldn’t follow it in. He summoned
Little Star to carry him inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen soon discovered that the hole hadn’t formed naturally.
It was actually a metal pipe.</p>
<p>“Why is there a man-made metal pipe here?” Han Sen was
surprised.</p>
<p>The little beast drifted down the metal pipe, and Han Sen
pursued it atop Little Star. They traveled a couple of miles before
the tunnel brightened and Little Star emerged from the wall.</p>
<p>As he looked around, Han Sen found himself gaping in surprise.
That place was an underground palace. The metal pipe he had
followed brought him out via the mouth of a giant fish statue.
Water flowed continuously out of the tube, creating a small
waterfall down into a pool.</p>
<p>The pool was made of jade-like stone. The water was very clear,
and Han Sen could see all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen looked closer, he froze. Inside the pool, there
was a black-and-white eye staring back at him.</p>
<p>Han Sen gazed into that stony stare, and his breath caught in
his chest.</p>
