In the Alliance universe, in the kindergarten on Planet Roca.

A little boy was writing, and there was a little girl with a hairstyle that resembled the horns of a goat. She moved her chair over to sit next to the little boy. She lay down on the table and looked up at him.

The little boy was still writing, and didn’t stop.

“Littleflower,” the little girl said.

“Yes?” Littleflower stopped writing, raised his head, and looked at the little girl.

The little girl smiled with her eyes squinted closed. She said, “Littleflower, you look so good. When you grow up, can you be my boyfriend?”

“What is a boyfriend?” Littleflower asked.

The little girl opened her eyes wide. “A boyfriend is the best man for me. I would always let a boyfriend eat good stuff first. I would let him play with toys first If he was in trouble, I’d help him. I’d protect him.”

“How does that sound, then? Would you like to be my boyfriend?” the little girl asked, taking Littleflower’s hands.

Littleflower thought for a moment, but then shook his head. “My mom said it is the man who should protect the girl. Otherwise, he is not a real man. I don’t want to be your boyfriend. I want to be a man.”

The little girl rolled her eyes. She was still holding his hands, and she said, “Okay, be my husband then. Husbands protect their girls. They are the manliest of men.”

“Really?” Littleflower asked, with shock.

“Of course.” The little girl blinked and asked, “Littleflower, are you willing to be my husband to protect me?”

“In that case, yes!” Littleflower nodded and spoke with gravitas.

“Great! You’ll be my future husband.” The little girl hugged Littleflower like mad and kissed his cheeks.

“Littleflower, me too!” A few more little girls came racing over to surround him.

Above the kindergarten, the dimension started to distort and twist. The leader of God’s Organization came out of it. There were no elites around him, and all alone, he watched Littleflower.

“Officer, you shouldn’t be here.” The moment the officer showed up, Stay Up Late appeared as well. He was standing right next to him.

“Night, do you really have to go up against me?” the officer said icily.

“I won’t go against you, as long as you don’t put a finger on the child I am tasked to watch,” Stay Up Late said.

“That means there is nothing we can do.” The officer did not move, but the fire wings on his back looked like the wings of a phoenix. They covered the entire sky.

The sky was bright, and when the wings spread, they scorched and turned the atmosphere red.

Stay Up Late’s face changed. He drew the Western King Sword and raised it up towards the officer. The officer flapped his wings and flew directly before Stay Up Late. Stay Up Late was calm, though, and he merely swung his sword.

*Boom!*

The air around the sword cracked as flames rained down across the buildings. Rock and concrete started to quake and fall all around.

The kindergarten was in the middle of that chaos, and the whole building was violently shaking. The kids and the teachers started to scream.

“Littleflower, run!” The little girl pulled Littleflower away, but after a few steps, there was a katcha noise. The seventh floor of the building fell, burying the playground in rubble.

The kids were crying even louder, out on the grass. When the teachers who were helping to evacuate the kids saw it collapse, they looked utterly hopeless.

“Littleflower, run!” The little girl pushed him, as Littleflower got to a place that was not covered in shadow. But she pushed too hard and landed on the grass.

Seeing the building falling down, the kids cried even harder. The teachers tried to shield the kids, closing their eyes as they did.

Littleflower was in a normal school, and the teachers and kids were from ordinary families. There was nothing they could do, but not even elites could protect them all from a disaster such as that.

*Boom!*

A white holy light suddenly erupted like a volcano. The building was hit and shattered by the holy light, which then blasted into the sky and on into space.

The kids and the teachers stared at the holy light, and they forgot they were even crying.

A little boy was hovering in the air with white, long hair. His eyes were shining like a holy sun.

“Littleflower!” The little girl on the floor looked at his back, speaking uncertainly.

“As a husband, I will protect you all.” Littleflower spoke with seriousness, as the volume of light increased. It covered the entire kindergarten, and nothing could penetrate that defense.

Stay Up Late was fighting the officer. The officer, when he saw Littleflower in the air, gave the child a strange look. He couldn’t believe the heir of a human could be that strong.

Not even the babies of crystallizers were that powerful.

“I need to get him!” The officer looked at the child with excitement.

Suddenly, a swordlight manifested in the sky. The sword was so overbearing, the officer threw a punch at it, but even he was knocked back fifty meters.

“Officer, I can’t believe that you dared to come here!” The woman was clutching a copper sword. She looked like a sword fairy from some legend.

“Gu Qingcheng! You just became a god; you can’t talk to me like this,” the officer said coldly.

“It isn’t just me here.” Gu Qingcheng smiled.

Many scary presences started to appear. Bao’er showed up first, flying right next to Littleflower.

Little Angel, Golden Growler, and Han Yufei all arrived, then. A man with silver light approached, too. It was Xie Qing King. Somehow, he had managed to come to the Alliance.

They all started to surround the officer. Ji Yanran raced to Littleflower’s side in her crystal armor.

“Officer, just give it up. Even without Han Sen here, you know you cannot challenge us.” Stay Up Late sighed.

“I may not be able to fight you, but I do have something you can’t block.” The officer had a weird smile, and he pointed his finger to the sky.
