<p>Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng frowned. They were sensitive
enough that they noticed the glance that the man directed toward
them.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen saw it, he said nothing. Considering the beauty
of the two women, it would be weird if men didn’t have any reaction
towards them.</p>
<p>The Demon and humans looked alike. Their definitions of pretty
were similar, so it wasn’t strange that a Demon man would be drawn
to the appearance of a human woman.</p>
<p>Attraction was one thing, but it would be a different matter if
the Demons tried to make a move. If Ji Yang Sheng didn’t do
anything stupid, Han Sen wouldn’t begin a conflict himself.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng turned away from Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon,
then said to Han Sen, “Teacher Han, Mister Moldo might have spoken
to you before about how he hoped that you could bless me. Do you
have time now?”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, Moldo mentioned that.” Han Sen went quiet for a moment,
then he told Ji Yang Sheng, “I told Mr. Moldo before that my
blessings can affect others, but I cannot make people deified.
Becoming deified is all about the potential of one’s genes.”</p>
<p>“I understand, but I would be very grateful if you were willing
to try to help me. Whether we succeed or not, it is the thought and
effort that counts.” Ji Yang Sheng was maintaining his politeness
quite well.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “There is no need to say that. We are merely
trading. I will still charge you.”</p>
<p>“That is okay. Tell me if there is something you want. If I can
pay it, I won’t disappoint you,” Ji Yang Sheng responded
quickly.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “We can talk about the price later. I
haven’t yet fully recovered from the blessing I gave Lando. It will
take another four months for me to recover enough that I can bless
someone else. We can talk about it then.”</p>
<p>In truth, Han Sen could use his Blood-Pulse Sutra power
whenever. That didn’t mean he wanted to keep using it, though. If
he did, its value would drop off substantially.</p>
<p>Up until now, Han Sen had only used it on Lando, Gu Qingcheng,
and Elysian Moon. He wanted to use it on Little Silver, too. Han
Sen wouldn’t use it on Bao’er or Ling’er, because they were so
talented themselves. They had so many possibilities, and the use of
the Blood-Pulse Sutra could limit their development.</p>
<p>Little Silver’s talents were a bit on the weak side. The
Blood-Pulse Sutra could only do good for him.</p>
<p>“Okay. If you don’t mind, though, I can protect you. I won’t let
anyone disturb whatever you are doing in the meantime,” Ji Yang
Sheng said with a look of sincerity.</p>
<p>“Thank you, but no thank you. We are only here to hunt
xenogeneics. It wouldn’t be appropriate for us to be together.” Han
Sen didn’t want a bunch of people following him.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will contact you at a later date. This is my
contact information. If you need anything, all you have to do is
ask,” Ji Yang Sheng said, before taking his people with him to
depart. He didn’t say anything about wanting to loot
xenogeneics.</p>
<p>After Ji Yang Sheng left, Elysian Moon coldly grunted and said,
“That guy doesn’t seem very likable.”</p>
<p>“You will probably end up meeting a lot of other people you
hate,” Han Sen said, with a shrug of his shoulders. Their own
beauty might have been their biggest challenge.</p>
<p>In that universe, many races looked just like humans, including
the Rebate, the Demons, the Sky, and the Extreme King, to name a
few. Their definition of beauty was quite similar, and so the two
girls were undoubtedly quite eye-catching to those of such
races.</p>
<p>“From what we have seen, we should learn from Dollar and wear
armor,” Gu Qingcheng said, glancing at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid wearing armor won’t help. Your bodies are quite
distinctive, and even if others cannot see your faces, your curves
are sure to attract men. Your appearance makes quite an impact.”
Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“If we are that sexy, why aren’t you affected by us?” Elysian
Moon asked, quirking her lips into a half-smile.</p>
<p>“I’m different. People like me are so faithful and loyal. I’m
just a good man, so a few looks here and there keep me happy. I’m
afraid you’ll never meet another man like me in the universe,” Han
Sen joked.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng smiled but said nothing. Elysian Moon looked at him
with disdain, and she said, “You’re just a creep who has no balls.
You call yourself a good man? Pff.”</p>
<p>After that, she ignored Han Sen and resumed her flight.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with her? Since when did I become a creep?” Han
Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng laughed and raised an eyebrow at him. Not saying
another word, she flew after Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>“Hey, what is wrong with you both?” Han Sen was so depressed.
Although Gu Qingcheng said nothing, he felt as if he had been
bullied.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng and his Demon allies didn’t venture far. When Han
Sen and the others departed, Ji Yang Sheng spoke to a King in his
entourage and said, “You go home and bring me my Demon Doll. If my
father asks, tell him I need it.”</p>
<p>The Demon King was shocked, and so he said, “Are you going to
attack Han Sen?”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that I encountered him here. This is a very
rare opportunity. We were unable to find him in the systems of
chaos, but now we have a second chance to snare him,” Ji Yang Sheng
said in a hard voice.</p>
<p>“Please think about this, sir! The Extreme King sent deifieds
after him, and even they were unable to capture him. Only
half-deifieds can come to the core area. I don’t think you have
what it takes to catch Han Sen. If he knows that we have tried to
snare him, I do not think he will ever spare the time to bless
you,” the Demon said.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m going to use the Demon Doll; it is deified.
Attacking Han Sen will be a guaranteed success. And even if it
fails, Han Sen will have no clue it was us who used it,” Ji Yang
Sheng stated flatly.</p>
<p>“But the Demon Doll is the Demon’s…” The Demon King wished to
say something, but Ji Yang Sheng cut him off.</p>
<p>“Just bring me the doll and stop your protesting,” Ji Yang Sheng
snapped.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The Demon King didn’t dare disobey a direct command. He
opened his core area hall and returned to the Demon Realm.</p>
<p>An hour later, the core area hall’s door opened again. The Demon
had returned, but with someone else in tow.</p>
<p>If anyone else had seen this, they would have been very
surprised. Kings could only use their power to open a personal door
to the core area. No other creature should have been able to enter
through that same door. That Demon King brought a creature through
the door with him. Even the Extreme King wouldn’t have been able to
believe their eyes if they had seen this.</p>
