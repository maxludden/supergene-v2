<p>“Plus, I know that there is hell blood in the statue, but I
don’t know where it is concentrated. And since you are still so
weak, I’m not even sure you can damage it. On top of that, even if
I do get the hell blood, the success rate of activating my own hell
blood is low. That is why I have told you it is a one in a billion
chance. If you have a method of escape, I suggest you make use of
it now.” By the time Yisha finished speaking, her face had grown
even paler.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned to face the statue, then he activated his
Purple-Eye Butterfly.</p>
<p>If he wanted to live, he needed Yisha. He didn’t want to watch
her die, either. If there was a way to save her and resolve his own
dire situation by extension, he wanted to try. It was killing two
birds with one stone.</p>
<p>But as Yisha had said, it was a dangerous thing to attempt. If
they failed, there was a very high chance he could die.</p>
<p>If Han Sen’s strike didn’t work, the ghost statue might attack
him in return.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen had the bird’s nest to defend himself. With
a shield like that, he didn’t have to be afraid.</p>
<p>Plus, he had the blood kirin. Even if his own power couldn’t
break the body of the ghost statue, the blood kirin’s strength
might be enough.</p>
<p>But before he could allow the blood kirin to attack, Han Sen
first needed to locate the hell blood inside the ghost statue. And
when he had located it, he had to ensure success in a single hit.
He didn’t know if he would be given a second chance.</p>
<p>The Purple-Eye Butterfly kept analyzing the ghost statue. Han
Sen detected many mysterious substance chains wrapping around and
through the statue. Those substance chains were very complex, and
they were difficult to understand. But Han Sen didn’t have to
understand how the ghost statue was made; all he had to do was
locate the point where the hell blood was stored.</p>
<p>Through the Dongxuan Aura and Purple-Eye Butterfly’s combined
analysis, Han Sen’s eyes eventually brightened. “It’s there!”</p>
<p>When Han Sen looked at the ghost statue’s eyebrow, he noticed
there was an extra tight substance chain. The purple substance was
so thick that he could not detect a single seam.</p>
<p>“Blood Kirin, attack here!” Han Sen lifted his Thunder God Spike
and took aim at the ghost statue’s eyebrow.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was carrying Han Sen, and the beast glowed with
red light. Blood air swirled around to cover its entire body. It
loosed a thunderous roar before leaping up at the ghost statue’s
eyebrow.</p>
<p>Yisha was surprised as she watched her student. She was too weak
to participate, and it was only now that she noticed the beast that
Han Sen was riding. It was a scary half-deified being, she could
tell. It wasn’t an ordinary half-deified creature, either; it had
to be at the very top of what was achievable in that class.</p>
<p>Yisha was surprised Han Sen was able to command such a powerful
mount. The sight gave her a little bit of hope to cling to.</p>
<p>A xenogeneic that was almost as strong as her might be able to
crack the ghost statue and retrieve the hell blood she
required.</p>
<p>While Yisha was mulling this over, the blood kirin’s claws were
tearing through the fabric of space. The beast lashed out at the
ghost statue’s forehead, sending a vicious attack against the
statue’s brow.</p>
<p>But suddenly, the ghost statue shone with purple light. Before
Han Sen and the blood kirin could react, the statue’s other hand
grabbed the blood kirin, just as it had Yisha. Its sharp nails dug
into the blood kirin’s flesh.</p>
<p>The blood kirin let out a horrendous screech. The statue’s
talons easily punched through the creature’s tough scales, and they
were digging in deep.</p>
<p>Han Sen was saved by the fact that the ghost statue’s claws only
went for the blood kirin. He tumbled to the surface of the bridge.
Looking up at what had occurred, he was given a shock.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the ghost statue’s power was deified. Even the
blood kirin couldn’t fight it off. The powerful creature was in the
statue’s hand, and no matter how much the blood kirin tried to
struggle, it could not pry itself free from the claws.</p>
<p>The blood kirin kept squirming in a bid to get free, but that
only made the claws sink in deeper. Blood seeped out in greater and
greater volume.</p>
<p>Yisha looked depressed. She had underestimated the statue’s
cunning. She thought she was pulling the attention and power of the
ghost statue’s power, but now, she realized that the ghost statue
had more power than she initially assumed. The power it had used to
attack the blood kirin was as great as anything she could unleash
herself.</p>
<p>“Blood Kirin, don’t move!” Han Sen shouted up at the blood kirin
from where he stood on the bridge.</p>
<p>The blood kirin, upon hearing Han Sen’s voice, stopped squirming
and resigned itself to the pain it was already feeling. When the
blood kirin stopped fighting the ghost statue, the powers of the
ghost statue’s claws seemed to lessen.</p>
<p>“D*mn it! Now I understand. It wasn’t because Yisha and the
blood kirin weren’t strong enough. The thing attacked them because
they have hell power already.” Han Sen looked at his own purple
body and the purple air.</p>
<p>The ghost statue wasn’t a creature. Just as Yisha had said, it
was indeed a statue. And inside its body was a pocket of hell
blood. That was the source of its strength. While it did have a lot
of power, it lacked intelligence. It didn’t make plans or schemes;
it did the job it was programmed to do.</p>
<p>It was the hell power inside Han Sen that would cause the statue
to act. If Han Sen used his power, the hell power that was now
inside his body would be triggered. And the ghost statue, in turn,
would be prompted to make its move.</p>
<p>The events would play out like falling dominoes. Unless Han Sen
could get rid of the hell power, not even a deified elite could
block the ghost statue’s attack.</p>
<p>Once enough hell power accumulated within Han Sen’s body, the
ghost statue would attack him even if he didn’t act first.</p>
<p>Just as it had been for Yisha. When she walked across the
bridge, she hadn’t attacked the ghost statue, but the statue still
grabbed her. That was why she was unable to evade it.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the blood kirin hadn’t activated the ghost statue
when they walked near it because of the bird’s nest. Han Sen had
thought that the bird’s nest was ineffectual against the hell
power, but it actually had gotten rid of some of it. That was why
the hell power in Han Sen and the blood kirin hadn’t triggered the
ghost statue to attack the moment they walked up to it.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly felt a headache coming on. The problem was no
longer getting the hell blood from the statue; it was the fact that
he couldn’t even hit the ghost statue. If Han Sen used a certain
amount of power, then the hell blood that had accumulated in his
body would be triggered. Then, the ghost statue would come after
him. He wouldn’t be able to escape if he was struck by it.</p>
<p>“Just go.” Yisha was smart, and she understood the issue as
well. She knew she couldn’t escape her predicament. Once their
bodies were infected by hell powers, all hope of defeating the
ghost statue was lost. The same would be true even if a deified
elite joined them.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at the ghost statue and did not speak. He didn’t
want to simply leave. He hadn’t saved Yisha yet, and now the blood
kirin had been captured as well. There was no way Han Sen was going
to throw in the towel and call it quits now.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the Thunder God Spike. The wings on his back
flashed, and he teleported in front of the ghost statue. But the
instant he got close enough to strike, the fist that was holding
Yisha slammed into him.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen used the bird’s nest to protect himself, but he was
still sent flying. He flew in a long arc that ended with a
crunching impact with the hard surface of the bridge. Han Sen’s
body was like a meteor thudding into the earth. He might not have
broken the bridge, but the same could not be said for his body. He
coughed, and blood sprayed the ground in front of him.</p>
