<p>Han Sen thought, “How come I have never heard about Zhao Ning’er
having a twin sister before? In addition to that, they both look
the same. Zhao Ning’er is the one I need to see right now. I do not
want to spend time with her sister.</p>
<p>The girl took Han Sen up to her bedroom. She laid on the bed,
holding the mud man that Han Sen had become. She said to herself,
“Big Sister is so strong. She captured the Qin Kingdom’s No. 1
swordsman. Are life souls really that powerful?”</p>
<p>When ordinary people became mud men, they would become real mud
men. There would be no sense of their former selves. Han Sen,
however, had not become an actual mud man. He heard whatever the
girl said.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the girl, who look fairly worried. She said,
“Big Sister was only born a few minutes before I was. She takes
care of me. Although she has not said a word about it, I know she
has worked very hard to provide for us. She keeps hanging around
rich people to ensure I am never put at a disadvantage. She works
so very hard. If it was not for me, Big Sister, would not have
taken the life soul.” Han Sen did not move. There were many sad
stories in this world. Everyone had their excuses and sorrows. Han
Sen was not a god inside a geno hall. He could not make everyone’s
wish come true.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just feeling a bit weird about it all. He wondered
why the girl kept talking to a mud man.</p>
<p>The girl placed the mud man down on the head of the bed. She put
her hands together and prayed to the mud man. She looked sincere as
she mumbled, “I know you are innocent. Big Sister did not hate you,
and she should not have brought you harm. Big Sister really did not
want to hurt you. The reason she did was because of me. If you want
to exact vengeance, become a ghost and haunt me. Do not lash out at
my sister.”</p>
<p>The girl looked very sincere as she prayed to the mud man.</p>
<p>Han Sen believed the girl was serious. Whomever Zhao Ning’er
turned into a mud man would be unable to hear her or understand
what she was doing. This girl would not be faking this act.</p>
<p>Han Sen came up with a brilliant idea. He suddenly spoke up to
say, “If you are a kind person, you should just let me go. I will
be grateful forever.”</p>
<p>The girl was shocked. She looked at Han Sen, who was still a mud
man, and asked, “How are you still able to talk? A creature that my
sister turns into a mud man should be as dull as a dead
person.”</p>
<p>“My powers are very special. I can talk, but I cannot get out of
this place. If you are a really nice person, then be nice and let
me go free.” Han Sen wanted to know if this girl was really nice or
not.</p>
<p>“If I let you go, Big Sister will be very mad,” the girl said
with some hesitation.</p>
<p>“If you do not let me go, I will be killed. Do you really want
me to die because of your sister? I really think you should help
me. Please?” Han Sen begged.</p>
<p>The girl hesitated. After a while, she said, “I can help you,
but you must promise me one thing. You cannot hate my sister. You
cannot trouble my sister. She was forced into doing this. She did
not mean what she has done.”</p>
<p>“OK. I can promise you that. If your sister does not come to
kill me, then I will not kill her.” Han Sen could not be sure if
she was being really nice or faking it.</p>
<p>The girl picked up the mud man and asked, “How can I save you?”
“Can you take me back to the Qin Kingdom?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. “I have never left the Jade System.
Over the past few years, I have not even been able to leave Planet
Ning’er. I do not know how to get to the Qin Kingdom. Even if I did
know the way there, my sister would not allow me to leave Planet
Ning’er.”</p>
<p>Han Sen pretended to be sad. “There is only one way, but that
way is very difficult. I will require your co-operation if I am to
save myself.” “If it is something that is within my capabilities of
helping you, then I will help you,” the girl said.</p>
<p>Han Sen paused and said, “To save me, you must break the
restrictions your sister has placed on me. Do you know how to erase
the restrictions your sister left?”</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. “The God Spirit Blood-Pulse I have is
different from the one my sister has. Our gene races are different.
When she was given her life soul, she was able to break the world.
I am afraid that cannot break her resistance.”</p>
<p>“I have a way that enables me to break it,” Han Sen said. “You
must follow my instructions to use that power. Put your power in
me, and I can erase my restrictions.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” The girl nodded and agreed. “How would I do that?”</p>
<p>After a brief think, Han Sen said, “After you combine with a
gene race, gather up its power on each of your fingers. Then, place
it on my…”</p>
<p>The girl followed Han Sen’s directions. Her body developed
feathers that turned into a wing. Her body looked very holy.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the power she wielded, it was obvious that her gene
race was quite special. It was nothing ordinary, that was for
sure.</p>
<p>The girl held the mud man. She put her finger on Han Sen and put
her power into the mud man.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the girl was very dumb. She really did put all
of her power into his body. While that boosted his willingness to
believe her, he did not put 100% faith in her just yet.</p>
<p>“Now comes the most important step. Put your power into your
chest and kiss me on the forehead. Then, put the power in. It will
only take a second to remove the restrictions.” Han Sen planned to
give it a try.</p>
<p>The girl did not hesitate. She did just as Han Sen told her to.
She put power in her chest and kissed the mud man on the
forehead.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt some pure power enter him. It was a lot. The girl
looked very pale. Sweat started to develop across her forehead.</p>
<p>“They have the same mother and are twins. Why is there such a
big difference between the two?” Han Sen thought the young lady was
dumb.</p>
<p>The girl could see the mud man had yet to move. She thought she
did not put in enough power, so she put more in. Han Sen felt
guilty for doing this. He did not mind tricking evil people. He
would do it as much as he was able to, but tricking a dumb lady
made Han Sen feel absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>“Enough. The restrictions are gone.” After that, Han Sen
returned to normal.</p>
<p>After seeing Han Sen come back alive, the girl looked delighted.
She instantly looked nervous and said, “You promised me you would
forgive my sister and not seek vengeance. Will you keep your
promise?”.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I, Han Sen, keep promises. Assuming she does not
come after me again, I will not go after her.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“In that case, you better run off now,” the girl said. “Do not
let my sister see. I will be unable to save you a second time.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I am leaving.” Han Sen stood up and started
walking. He pretended his legs went soft and was going to fall
over.</p>
<p>The girl held Han Sen and offered support. She worriedly asked,
“Are you OK?”.</p>
<p>“Breaking the restrictions cost me all my power. I am so weak
that I cannot stand.”</p>
<p>Han Sen leaned against the girl. He gasped as he spoke.</p>
