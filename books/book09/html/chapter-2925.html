<p>“I am afraid that in this universe, it might be difficult to
find another Dead Area Demon Dragon.” Han Sen licked his lips and
felt a bit disheartened. He spoke to himself sadly.</p>
<p>The ability to get a beast soul or not was something Han Sen
could not control. As for what the chances were, he did not know
yet.</p>
<p>According to what God told him, God Spirits and beast souls had
to have been composed of the spirits of creatures. Every creature
had a spirit, so why was it that one could only get beast souls by
killing xenogeneics in the universe? Why was a beast soul not given
every time? Han Sen did not understand the reasons behind all of
that.</p>
<p>If every xenogeneic had a spirit, then killing a xenogeneic
should have definitely yielded a beast soul. But it wasn’t like
that.</p>
<p>“This Dead Area Demon Dragon’s deified xenogeneic gene should be
enough to get my deified gene tally up to 100, but this guy is too
big. I do not know how long it will take me to eat it all.” Han Sen
looked at the dragon’s body, which looked like a giant rock. It
made a wry smile develop on his face.</p>
<p>Although his Consume was at the highest level, swallowing such a
big dragon body would still take a long time. He would have to
spend 10 days to half a month eating it.</p>
<p>“The black dragon is dead. I wonder if there are any other
treasures to find on the three black mountains.” Han Sen raised his
hand and held the stone lantern high. He was still feeling a bit
greedy. He called Bao’er and put her in a blanket. The two of them
headed up the three black stone mountains.</p>
<p>They did not find any treasure. In the center of the three
mountains, there was a circular valley. At the bottom of the valley
was an old teleporter. It was unknown where it led.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know where the teleporter went, so he did not
want to try it. He had to leave the valley and play with the stone
lantern he had.</p>
<p>The stone lantern was strange. Han Sen could not activate its
power and or control it. If he put his power through the fire, the
flames imbued strength into the power he passed through it. It did
not matter what power went through the flames. Any power was
boosted. That was true for anyone who used it.</p>
<p>“What is this stone lantern? It does not look like a god
personality armament, and it does not look like a xenogeneic
treasure. It kind of looks like a race lantern from the geno hall,
but it is not quite the same as them either.” Han Sen studied the
lantern for a while. He was still unable to find out what the stone
lantern was.</p>
<p>If it was safe to use, Han Sen was not going to research it too
much. He put it inside Destiny’s Tower and went to start eating the
Dead Area Demon Dragon’s flesh.</p>
<p>After he took a few bites, he saw a gold and red light appear in
the sky. The big goldfish was flying toward him. It had brought the
little goldfish along.</p>
<p>Because the big goldfish had not lied, and Han Sen had maxed out
his genes after eating the Dead Area Demon Dragon, he was not
planning on killing either goldfish.</p>
<p>When it saw the body of the Dead Area Demon Dragon, the big
goldfish looked very excited. It brought the little goldfish before
Han Sen and kept firing bubbles as if it was trying to say
something.</p>
<p>Bao’er translated the bubbles. “It says thank you for killing
the Dead Area Demon Dragon for it. He and his child appreciate it a
lot. If the chance ever arises, it wants to return the favor
someday.”</p>
<p>“Of course, you need to pay me back. Just show up whenever I
need you,” Han Sen said to the goldfish and its kid.</p>
<p>The goldfish family seemed to understand Han Sen’s words and
nodded. The big goldfish spat out many bubbles at Han Sen. After
that, it swam to the top of the three black mountains. It turned
its head and fired many more bubbles to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“It said the Dead Area Demon Dragon is dead,” Bao’er said. “Now,
the child can finally be returned home. It wants to invite us to
its house.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the big goldfish with curiosity and asked,
“Your home would not happen to reside on the other side of the
teleporter, would it?”</p>
<p>The big goldfish nodded. It spat out many bubbles. Bao’er tried
to explain. “It said its home is on the other side of the
teleporter. Something that happened many years ago was the whole
reason it teleported to this place. Then, the Dead Area Demon
Dragon took over the teleporter. They have been unable to go back.
Now that you have killed the Dead Area Demon Dragon, they are
finally able to go home. So, they are really grateful. They want
you to go and visit them. They will also reward you with some more
treasures too.”</p>
<p>“Sure. I don’t mind going there.” Upon hearing there was
treasure to be found, Han Sen stopped hesitating. He put the Dead
Area Demon Dragon meat inside Destiny’s Tower and followed the big
goldfish into the teleporter.</p>
<p>He now understood it completely. People said fish only had a
seven-second memory. Whether or not it was true was unknown. This
big goldfish was a top-class deified xenogeneic. Its intelligence
and memory were not so good.</p>
<p>Han Sen estimated its intelligence and did not think it was able
to lie to people. So, he was not too worried.</p>
<p>He held onto Bao’er and followed after the big and small
goldfishes to the teleporter. The big goldfish’s body released a
red light. The light went into the teleporter. The teleporter was
activated. It started to glow.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his eyes had gone black. When his vision
returned to normal, he was no longer in the snowfields. It was all
dark upfront.</p>
<p>There was no space. There was no hint of the universe around.
There was no land, and there were no mountains. It was like
nothing. It was just a pitch-black void. In front of that black
nothingness, there was a broken stone door. That door only had two
broken stone pillars left. The stone of the roof was broken. He saw
half of a sign hanging on the broken roof. There was a lamp in
front of the door. It was releasing some obscenely dim yellow
light. Han Sen only saw half of the sign, which said the word
“holy.”</p>
<p>“Is this place a ruin that belonged to Sacred?” Han Sen was
shocked. He was not able to think of any other race that would dare
use the word “holy” aside from Sacred.</p>
<p>The big goldfish led the small goldfish toward the broken door.
The big goldfish looked very confused. It seemed as if it did not
recognize the place.</p>
<p>Han Sen held Bao’er and followed. Before the big goldfish walked
in front of the door, it saw the door released some cold light. The
big goldfish was not prepared. It was shot in the forehead. Blood
was everywhere. It was like a very sharp arrow pierced into the big
goldfish’s forehead. Although the arrowhead did not go deep, it
broke the big goldfish’s protective substance chains. That arrow
was very strong.</p>
<p>“How dare you come to Sacred! Do you guys want to die?” A very
dim voice came from the left side of the stone pillar. They then
saw someone walk out from behind the stone pillar.</p>
<p>That someone, who had a human body and a dog face, was holding a
teethy bow. There were three teethy arrows on the person’s back.
The person reached out a hand. The teeth arrow lodged in the big
goldfish’s head flew back into the person’s hands. The wound on the
big goldfish ripped. Blood came out with the arrow. It could not be
stopped.</p>
