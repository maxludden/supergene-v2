<p>Not long after entering the silver statue, Han Sen heard buzzing sounds coming from close to the statue’s entrance.</p>

<p>Han Sen was familiar with this sound. It was the sound of the silver glass bug flapping its wings. He summoned Spell in the form of a rocket launcher and fired it at the cave wall.</p>

<p>After firing it, he didn’t stick around to see the result. He just took the time to tuck himself into a narrower passage and hide his presence.</p>

<p>The rocket exploded against the wall, and a loud noise echoed throughout the caverns of the statue’s interior. Han Sen heard the buzzing get stronger, and not long after, the silver glass bug came to patrol the area.</p>

<p>“Dragon Thirteen must have heard that,” Han Sen thought, as he kept himself hidden.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen and Sharon did hear the noise. They did not know what had happened, but whatever it was would not make them give up the chase. Dragon Thirteen led Sharon in Han Sen’s direction.</p>

<p>As Dragon Thirteen drew nearer, the silver glass bug searched fruitlessly for Han Sen. When Dragon Thirteen and Sharon reached Han Sen’s proximity, however, what they saw was the silver glass bug.</p>

<p>The silver glass bug caught sight of them, too. With a squeal, it came charging towards them. Its mouth opened to spew silver light.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen, who was in the front, was quick to react. She raised her lance and thrust it towards the incoming silver glass bug.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>The lance and the silver light collided. The silver light was broken, but the lance that was sharper than a needle came against the silver glass bug’s shield. The shield flashed in response to the strike, but it was unbroken. Dragon Thirteen was spent spiraling back ten meters by what remained of the silver light.</p>

<p>“A mutant Marquise xenogeneic.” Dragon Thirteen’s face paled.</p>

<p>“Kill it,” Sharon said. Then, he drew a scimitar. With his Sky-Demon powers, he used it to strike the silver glass bug.</p>

<p>There was a dong noise as the Sky-Demon power came against the silver glass bug’s shield. The creature was unhurt, and the impact only knocked it back a small distance.</p>

<p>Sharon and Dragon Thirteen attacked the silver glass bug together. The silver glass bug’s silver shield kept flashing under the combined strikes, though, and it looked as if it might break.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen’s lance was very effective when it came to piercing things. Her strength was focused on the tip of the weapon, where it could deal the most damage. The silver glass bug’s silver shield might not withstand the repeated blows for long.</p>

<p>“I can’t let them kill the bug! If they kill it, I am done for,” Han Sen thought to himself. He emerged from the small passage he had been hiding in, and with Tusk, he attacked Dragon Thirteen from behind.</p>

<p>But Dragon Thirteen was quick to react to this sneak attack. Her screw-shaped lance quickly came against Han Sen’s knife air. They collided, and the knife air was almost penetrated by the power of the lance.</p>

<p>Han Sen expected this, however. He dodged the lance and attacked again. Then, he used Under the Sky.</p>

<p>“You deal with Han Sen while I deal with the xenogeneic,” Sharon told Dragon Thirteen.</p>

<p>“Okay.” Dragon Thirteen did not hesitate. With her lance, she continued to attack Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen used the complex geography of the cave to evade Dragon Thirteen’s lance. He drew her deeper into the tunnels so he could separate her from Sharon.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen was very confident. The Dragon were known to be fearless, and she above all was worthy of the title bravest. She would never find herself scared by an Earl. She knew full well that Han Sen sought to separate her and Sharon, but she was more than fine with following him.</p>

<p>The lance was like a needle, and she turned a few-meter-thick wall into a pincushion. There was no point in Han Sen’s hiding behind any stone.</p>

<p>The Evilbreaker Lance was of the Yang element. It was the opposite of something like Moon. If Han Sen had been a Marquise, then the power of Moon would have been able to break Dragon Thirteen’s body.</p>

<p>But Moon’s knife silks were unable to damage Dragon Thirteen. He was at a disadvantage, and Dragon Thirteen was making him fall back further and further.</p>

<p>Han Sen eventually failed a dodge, and it led to the lance piercing his shoulder. The lance left a hole in Han Sen so small that it would have been difficult to find with the naked eye. But when the lance was inside Han Sen, it drilled into his bones. It wracked Han Sen with pain, and he shuddered under its force.</p>

<p>Han Sen had failed to dodge because the effects of the first lance strike were still in his body. The strike had hurt his organs badly, and for a brief second, it made him freeze.</p>

<p>“Han Sen, you have no chance. There is still time to concede. You will be permitted to retain your life,” Dragon Thirteen said gravely.</p>

<p>“You took the words from right out of my mouth,” Han Sen countered.</p>

<p>“Why must you continue to be so stubborn? Give me the two Beginning of Ancient Gods, and I will let you go. Otherwise, the two hits delivered by my Evilbreaker Lance will only continue to break down your body. You have to get rid of the damage.”</p>

<p>“Really? I don’t think that is going to happen,” Han Sen said, but in reality, he was thinking about how he might be able to escape from the situation he had found himself in.</p>

<p>With his powers, he could kill a Marquise. But Dragon Thirteen was amongst the greatest Marquises alive. He would probably require super god spirit mode to finish off Dragon Thirteen.</p>

<p>But there was the issue of super god spirit mode being a limited thing. He could kill Dragon Thirteen, yes, but then he’d be left even weaker. And there were three more Marquises, including Sharon, waiting for him. That’d have him in an even sorrier state.</p>

<p>Han Sen was too tired already, and the effects of the lance were doing a number on his body. He could not keep going on like that.</p>

<p>“Whatever. I’ll kill one of you first.” Han Sen decided to use super god spirit.</p>

<p>But before he could, his body suddenly shook. Something inside him broke. And then, he suddenly felt as light as a feather. It was as if he had been carrying a mountain on his shoulders, and now, he was able to relieve himself of that load.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s speed increased. He easily dodged Dragon Thirteen’s lance.</p>

<p>“The Sky Heart Lock has been unlocked!” Han Sen was exuberantly happy. He had been carrying the weight of the Sky Heart Lock through his entire fight with Dragon Thirteen. Now that it was gone, the true extent of his power could be unleashed.</p>

<p>Dong!</p>

<p>Han Sen cast many more knife silks upon Dragon Thirteen, and this time, the bravest Dragon body was riddled with wounds.</p>

<p>Han Sen was so happy. The Sky Heart Lock was open. The speed and power he possessed increased.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen frowned. Holding her spear, she said incredulously, “A Sky Heart Lock? I did not know you were carrying them as you fought. But even so, you cannot beat me.”</p>

<p>After that, Dragon Thirteen’s lance came towards Han Sen in a mad flurry of attacks. Han Sen kept swinging his Blood Feather Knife, too. When they came against each other, Han Sen’s body was sent flying. He came to a stop against a sturdy wall.</p>

<p>“I told you. You cannot beat me.” Dragon Thirteen kept moving, and she used her lance to attack Han Sen.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The sound of something else breaking inside Han Sen’s body sounded. The second Sky Heart Lock was broken.</p>
