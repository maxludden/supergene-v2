<p>“I want to activate the geno tablet, but you and I do not have
that power.” Ancient Devil looked around and asked, “Did I not tell
you the 33 skies are a new god world from the old leader, and it
was broken during the chaos that transpired during the reboot? It
became a layer of 33 different skies. The 33 skies were supposed to
be whole.”</p>
<p>“How is that related to the sealing of the space tunnels?” Han
Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Sky King is affecting the whole 33 skies, but the 33 skies have
been broken open. His effectiveness will be weaker because of the
broken layers of space. If he is totally awoken and comes over here
himself, he will still be unable to pierce through the thirty-three
skies. The black hole-like space tunnels are just some unstable
gaps around the 33 skies. It is very dangerous inside. Only spirit
bodies like life souls can get through them safely. If a creature
with a body enters there, there is a high chance they will end up
dead. Even Break World elites might not be able to enter such a
tunnel, reach the other universe, and emerge alive.”</p>
<p>Han Sen believed that. Up until now, aside from the life souls,
Han Sen did not see any universe of kingdom creatures enter the
geno universe.</p>
<p>If they were able to go through safely, the God Chaos Party
would have done something by now.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil went on to say, “The space tunnels are just some
unstable gaps. Just seal up the gaps.”</p>
<p>“How do I seal them?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Even with God Spirits, which were good with space powers, it was
still hard to block the space tunnel.</p>
<p>“We need to use this geno tablet.” Ancient Devil pointed at the
geno tablet and said, “This tablet is the center of the 33 skies.
When the universe rebooted, the 33 skies were broken. The tablet
ended up above the 33 skies.</p>
<p>After saying that, Ancient Devil hesitated. He then said, “The
history of the geno tablet is something I am not fully clear about.
But hearing it from the old leader, this tablet is the foundation
of the universe. If you can control the tablet, you can control the
main and the reverse universes. Right now, we do not have the power
to assert control of the tablet. With your power, maybe we can make
the geno tablet have some use. Although it is only a little, it
might be enough to fill up the gaps in space.”</p>
<p>“If that is what you want me to do, then you will be
disappointed,” Han Sen said. “I do not have the power needed to
activate the geno tablet.”</p>
<p>“Of course, you do not,” Ancient Devil said. “Even back in the
day, the old leader could only use a different trick to control the
geno tablet. I know the method the old leader used to assert
control over the geno tablet. It cannot accomplish something great,
but it should be enough to close the gaps in space. When you
activate the geno tablet, some geno tablet power will affect it.
Even Sky King will not be able to break the 33 skies easily. You
can buy yourself some time.” Ancient Devil cast out a spirit light.
The spirit light became an image that spoke in front of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“I recorded the method to activate a geno tablet,” Ancient Devil
slowly said. “You can have a look at it first. You can do it if you
think it will work.” Ancient Devil did not rush Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe Ancient Devil, so he examined it with
great care.</p>
<p>It was not very complicated. He only needed to use his power to
leave a special symbol atop the geno tablet. By doing that, it
would affect the geno tablet.</p>
<p>He could not completely control the geno tablet, but he could
use it. The key was that he needed enough power to leave a mark on
the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil gave him 17 special symbols. Each special symbol
did different things. One of the symbols was able to fix the 33
skies’ spaces. That included the cracks in space.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a bit suspicious. How could Ancient Devil be so nice
and elucidate so many secrets to him? He had written down 17, which
was a high number.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil could have just told Han Sen the one symbol that
was needed. He was being generous, but that made Han Sen wary of
the man.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking. He
coldly said, “If you do not believe me, you can just pick a symbol
and try its effect. See if I am lying to you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted his lips. “So, what? With the other 16 symbols
even work?”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil smiled. “You are a very suspicious individual.
Even after all these years, your personality hasn’t changed a
bit.”</p>
<p>“I am who I am,” Han Sen said. “I live a happy life being like
this. I do not need to change.”</p>
<p>“You are right.” Ancient Devil nodded. “If you do not believe
me, and I do not have enough power to write the symbol down on the
geno tablet, it seems like we wasted a trip.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was silent. Ancient Devil was trying to provoke him, but
Han Sen had no other choice. Aside from this, there was no other
way he could save the geno universe.</p>
<p>This was a difficult decision. This could save the universe or
have Han Sen stumble into a trap concocted by Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did not seem to worry. He smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil and asked, “Are you not afraid I
will kill your spirit and draw the symbol down?”</p>
<p>“That is not who you are,” Ancient Devil coldly said. “If you
wanted to kill me, you would not have kept me trapped inside
Destiny’s Tower.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. “If you knew that, you should have been
prepared. Why don’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>“With your power, you can trap my soul. You can trap my soul
first. When the geno tablet works and proves my earnestness, you
can let me go.” Ancient Devil wanted to be jailed.</p>
<p>“Good. In that case, stay in my Sea of Soul and take a rest.”
Han Sen opened his Sea of Soul. He did not force Ancient Devil to
go inside. He quietly looked at him.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil smiled. He walked into Han Sen’s Sea of Soul and
sat in space.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Ancient Devil enter his Sea of Soul. He decided to
stop hesitating. His Super God Spirit body power exploded. He
lifted his finger and drew on the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Life souls kept going to the geno universe through the black
holes. The more he delayed, the more life souls were able to enter.
Han Sen could not wait any longer.</p>
