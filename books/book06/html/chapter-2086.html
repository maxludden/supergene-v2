<p>Mountain. River. Sun. Moon. Knife. Axe. Sword. Spear. The holy air came out again, all headed towards Han Sen. They entered through his forehead, one after another.</p>

<p>“Good Bao’er! I raised you well, after all.” Han Sen was so happy, he wanted to pick her up and kiss her cheeks.</p>

<p>One holy air headed for Han Sen was like the mountain of a god. Han Sen felt the power of a mountain go inside him.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt as if he himself had become the god mountain. The strength, vitality, and power of a mountain were inside him. He now understood what a mountain truly was.</p>

<p>A river came next, and Han Sen became a river in accordance. The swell of the river, and the infinite reach of its waters came into Han Sen’s heart. At that moment, Han Sen was the river, and the river was Han Sen.</p>

<p>Galaxy and snow. All these strange things landed atop Han Sen. He understood everything at a greater level than he had before.</p>

<p>A myriad of experiences flowed into Han Sen. His world was a fish. It was a tiger. It was a bug. It was a dragon. His world had been turned upside-down, and he saw the world from a different point-of-view. It was something that he should not have understood.</p>

<p>These weren’t just feelings; the holy air cleaned his body. He could understand other things more. Now Han Sen knew why, after the holy gourd sword air, the sword skills would increase.</p>

<p>After learning the essence of the sword, with the body cleansed, the sword skill talents would increase.</p>

<p>Ten thousand gourd holy airs were coming. To someone like Han Sen, who already knew everything, it was a magnificent boon.</p>

<p>Holy gourd airs did not increase one’s level or power, but the benefits they gave weren’t something you could get by leveling up, anyway.</p>

<p>“How…?” The Sky Palace leader and all the elders were stunned again. Even the deified ones could not find the means to shut their mouths.</p>

<p>“Damn! The holy vine’s holy airs can be requested? I thought nothing could influence whether or not they were bestowed on someone. What is going on now?”</p>

<p>“Is everything I have come to know a lie? The gourd doesn’t need to approve of who it gives its holy airs to?”</p>

<p>“Fuck! I thought the holy gourd air was something noble. It turns out to be something quite cheap.”</p>

<p>“F*ck you! This favoritism is too much. Han Sen’s daughter can get holy air, and then ask the same to be given to her father? This has to be a joke!”</p>

<p>“Does walking Sky Road require social connections now?”</p>

<p>“Making a good baby is better than living well, it would seem. Make a good daughter, and you can have everything.” “There is no need for the Sky Road anymore. It sucks.”</p>

<p>The elders were silent. They could not understand why the vine would accept Bao’er’s request. It was unbelievable. Not even the deified elites could get a holy air without the vine’s approval.</p>

<p>Bao’er had casually spoken her wish, but the vine released plenty of holy airs from its gourds. It made all the elders wonder about the meaning of their existence. Perhaps the gourd had been gathering up its holy airs for millions of years, and now it was randomly spewing them out to the lucky.</p>

<p>But deep down, they knew that wasn’t true. Many people had walked across Sky Road, and only a very few ever gained the approval of the gourds.</p>

<p>“I want this student. Whoever fights me on this will no longer be my friend.” The fourth-eat elder sounded angry.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? This girl is my student. We look so similar, after all.” The elders started to argue amongst themselves again.</p>

<p>That was a sleepless night for the Sky. Two people had received ten thousand holy airs in one day. The most unbelievable thing was that one set had been given upon request.</p>

<p>After that day, many Sky Palace students re-walked the Sky Road. They hoped a miracle would occur for them, but nothing ever did. There was no reaction from the gourds, even if they walked across it a few times. They never got approved.</p>

<p>Some students begged it, hoping to touch the holy vine and have it give them its holy airs. They burned so many sacrifices, and they kowtowed until their foreheads were bloody. But no matter what they tried, the gourd vine was unmoved.</p>

<p>Now people knew that begging for holy air depended on who you were. Not just anyone could do that.</p>

<p>After that, Bao’er was bestowed the title of Little Fairy. She didn’t look like Han Sen’s daughter, and she looked more like a fairy due to her having ten thousand gourd holy airs.</p>

<p>Han Sen also experienced the winds of ten thousand gourd airs, and when all was done, he felt amazing. When he looked at things’ he saw them a whole different way now.</p>

<p>Four hours later, all the holy airs had successfully blended into Han Sen’s body. The gourds looked exhausted when they were finished.</p>

<p>Thanks,” Han Sen said to the gourds. Then, he picked up Bao’er and walked to the main island.</p>

<p>The Road to the Sky did nothing to Bao’er. Nothing strange happened there. Han Sen held Bao’er and carried her into Sky Palace safely.</p>

<p>The students of Sky Palace looked at Han Sen as if he was a stranger. It was as if they thought he was a monster that had escaped from the zoo.</p>

<p>Before Han Sen had a chance to go to the leader and elders with Bao’er himself, they came running towards him.</p>

<p>“Han Sen; I am going to take your daughter as a student. You may have whatever you wish.”</p>

<p>“No, she is my student! Han Sen, I have so many weapons you can choose from. You can take any you wish, if you allow your daughter to be a student of mine.”</p>

<p>“What is the point of giving out so many weapons? Come to my Medicine King Island. All the medicines and geno fluids there are now yours.” “I… I…”</p>

<p>“Enough! Look at what you people have become. Do any of you still respect me? Act like the elders you are!” the Sky Palace leader roared, slamming his fist into the table.</p>

<p>All the elders looked ashamed of themselves. The leader walked in front of Han Sen. “Han Sen, you know Lone Bamboo. You know how strong he is. If you allow Bao’er to become his student, with my teachings as well, she can become something great.”</p>

<p>“Obscene.” The elders became even angrier. They started to fight again.</p>
