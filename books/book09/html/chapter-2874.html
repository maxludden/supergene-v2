<h2>Maha God Elephant</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2874</h3>

<p>Han Sen hastily appeared on the space battleground. He saw a
red, giant elephant also appear across the distance of space
between them.</p>
<p>That giant elephant was all red. Its body had a burning red
flame. If one went to feel it, one would notice that the blaze did
not have a temperature.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Maha God Elephant’s trunk lifted. The crystal-looking,
fiery, crystal stone elephant teeth were also lifted.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out with his hand and had his Sky Vine Radish
God Lance appear in his arms. In the next second, Han Sen
teleported directly before the Maha God Elephant. The Sky Vine
Radish God Lance was thrust into Maha God Elephant’s flesh. The tip
of the lance plunged into the elephant’s tough skin. As Han Sen
pushed it in, he felt the muscles inside the elephant were like
beef tendons. They were very tough. The Sky Vine Radish God Lance
only had its tip pierce into it. It was difficult trying to push it
deeper in.</p>
<p>“That’s a very tough body. No wonder it was able to reach the
top 20 as a true god xenogeneic.” Han Sen was shocked. Before the
elephant’s trunk came at him, Han Sen pulled the lance back and
leaped away.</p>
<p>Maha God Elephant had a massive amount of power. He was able to
hit a true god body with a might other true gods would not even
attempt to block. Han Sen was only a butterfly, so he did not want
to get hit.</p>
<p>After the Sky Vine Radish God Lance was pulled out, the wounds
did not drip with god blood. A sapling was growing, but it did not
grow fast.</p>
<p>The god elephant’s red lights were burning. The wound where the
sapling had appeared quickly healed. The saplings were like little
tufts of grass weaseling their way through a wall stone. They tried
their best to squeeze through the gaps. It was so hard that it was
like fighting the sky. They did not get squeezed to death, but it
was hard for them to grow.</p>
<p>“If one hit won’t work, then I will have to give it many more.”
Han Sen’s body flashed like a ghost. He kept appearing in front, at
its back, and to the left and right of the god elephant. At the
same time, the Sky Vine Radish God Lance in his hands flashed like
thunder. It kept striking the god elephant’s flesh. Before the god
elephant’s elephant trunk got close, Han Sen could easily flash and
bolt over to another location.</p>
<p>There was infinite power when using the Sky Vine Radish God
Lance. It left one hole and another hole on the god elephant. Every
hole creating saplings growing from the wounds. Even though the god
elephant’s flesh was extremely sturdy, and it was running under the
bounty of the powerful healing fires, its body had many saplings
growing all over it like a layer of green hair. But the saplings
were having great difficulty growing. They were squeezed by the god
elephant’s flesh, almost to the point of death.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Any true god xenogeneic in the top 100 is hard
to deal with. If I could become true god, I could use my own power
to rip its body to shreds before it healed once. Now, I need the
Sky Vine Radish God Lance power. Even so, it is still really
difficult.” His hands did not stop. The lance’s green lightning
kept striking the god elephant’s body. It left many saplings behind
in its wake.</p>
<p>It looked like he had the advantage, but it was still hard to
damage the god elephant.</p>
<p>“Maha God Elephant’s healing power is too effective. It is no
wonder it is the xenogeneic that represents life. Even god
personality armaments cannot kill it.”</p>
<p>“It looks like Dollar is in trouble.”</p>
<p>“He could pick anyone, yet he decided to challenge the Maha God
Elephant. If he selected a higher rank xenogeneic, he would have
killed it already.” The audience was talking. Sky Palace Leader was
laughing and saying, “It looks like Dollar underestimated Maha God
Elephant’s defense and healing powers. This is the xenogeneic with
the best life element. Although the god personality armament is a
weapon, it is plant-based. Normal creatures might be able to be
killed easily by it but killing the Maha God Elephant with it will
not be easy.”</p>
<p>“It is a shame the Maha God Elephant is very grumpy and proud,”
the woman said with a sigh. “If we could tame it to protect the
palace, we could have a true god join our forces.” “Although that
guy is living in Ancient God’s holy place, it has been living in
the Sand Lake,” Sky Palace Leader said with a laugh. “No one can do
anything there. Even the Ancient Gods cannot do anything there.”
“Fortunately, its healing power is strong and supremely powerful,”
the woman said. “It is very clumsy, though. It can easily be
tricked by geno arts. It is good enough to be a guard but not
enough to be a warrior.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not. With it here, it will be like a needle in the sea.
It would be hard for it to die. It would be very useful for
fighting in a xenogeneic space.” Sky Palace Leader sighed and said,
“But it keeps guarding Sand River. It won’t work for anyone.” Han
Sen realized he had underestimated Maha God Elephant’s power.
Killing it with the Sky Vine Radish God Lance was not easy.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had selected it, he was prepared. He retreated and
stopped attacking Maha God Elephant.</p>
<p>“He is so strong. Even Dollar, who has a god personality
armament, cannot do anything.” “Is he going to give up?” “I do not
think so. Dollar still has that eye skill that judged Sky Armor
God.”</p>
<p>“You are right. It looks like we can see the scary judgment
power again.”</p>
<p>Everyone wanted Han Sen to use the eye of law. Han Sen had seen
that although the Maha God Elephant looked very red, in the eye of
the law, it was white like a sheet of paper. It did not have any
level of crime. Using the law eye would not work on it.</p>
<p>Maha God Elephant saw Han Sen leave, but it was not planning on
chasing him. He provoked him by raising its trunk and screaming a
lot of taunting noises. Its body was full of green saplings, but it
did not care. It was like the saplings did not affect him.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “You were cocky too soon.”</p>
<p>Han Sen put the Sky Vine Radish God Lance away. His thumb and
middle finger on his right hand came together. A gold light was
shining in between them. It created a gold coin.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding a coin. He did not move. He watched the
number on the coin keep jumping up. 1… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…</p>
<p>As the number on the coins jumped, Han Sen’s presence became
scarier. It was like he was a bomb brewing and about to
explode.</p>
<p>Maha God Elephant realized something might have been wrong. It
roared and used its four legs to run at Han Sen. At the same time,
its elephant trunk was like a pillar that opened the sky. It
created a scary red light that tried to break Han Sen.</p>
<p>Seeing Maha God Elephant in front of him, Han Sen did not dare
use his own body to block its attack. Maha God Elephant suddenly
bounced the coin away.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>The coin created some gold light in space. It hit Maha God
Elephant’s forehead. It gathered up all the way to 13 times the
power. At that point, the coin was like a heavy hammer. It shook
the Maha God Elephant, which was running away.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “It is a shame I am just butterfly. If I was
true god, that would have been Saving Money times 13. It would turn
his body into dust.”</p>
<p>Maha God Elephant madly roared. It wanted to run at Han Sen
again. It was too slow. It was like it was carrying a mountain.</p>
