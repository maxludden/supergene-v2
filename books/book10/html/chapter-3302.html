<p>The blonde Wan’er had the will of the Qin Kingdom’s Wan’er. The
black-haired Qin Wan’er had the will of the Witch Wan’er. It did
not matter which will was in control. She would always retain the
memories from both worlds. It was just her personality that would
greatly differ depending on which was in control.</p>
<p>The blonde Qin Wan’er called Qin Xiu a brother. The black-haired
Qin Wan’er added his name, Qin Xiu, after it.</p>
<p>“I just woke up,” the black-haired Wan’er answered.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu did not see anything amiss in the old tower, and his
security system was still untampered. No creature had been
detected. Qin Xiu was confused.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at Wan’er and asked, “Wan’er, who has been
here?”</p>
<p>“No one came,” Wan’er replied.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was smart. By looking at Wan’er’s face, he knew someone
had paid a visit. After a brief thought, he asked, “What did Han
Sen do here?”</p>
<p>Wan’er was frightened, but she quickly explained, “Big Brother
did not mean me any harm. He only came to visit me.”</p>
<p>“It is fine,” Qin Xiu softly said, despite the sting of betrayal
on show in his eyes. “As long as you are happy, you can have
anything. If you want to see him again, I can make him come here
and let him visit you more often.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really, Brother Qin Xiu?” Wan’er was shocked and happy.</p>
<p>“Of course, you sweet dumpling. Just be happy, and I will do
anything I can in my power to sustain that joy.” Qin Xiu rubbed
Wan’er on the nose and smiled.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Brother Qin Xiu,” Wan’er happily said.</p>
<p>“Do you know where Han Sen went?” Qin Xiu inquired. “I can go
and get him. I can bring him over here to meet you.”</p>
<p>Wan’er shook her head. “I do not know where Big Brother went. He
only said he would come and see me in the future.”</p>
<p>“That is fine. I will find him. If you like it, no matter where
he is, I will bring him right here in front of you.” Qin Xiu
stroked Wan’er’s hair and looked at her softly.</p>
<p>After leaving the old tower, Qin Xiu looked very cold. “What did
Han Sen do? He made Wan’er’s will take over her other will. It
looks like I have to put my skates on and speed things up.”</p>
<p>After a few steps, Qin Xiu traveled through space to visit a
jail.</p>
<p>“Mister Leader, you are here!” Shoot Shadow kneeled.</p>
<p>“How is the life soul combination process fairing?” Qin Xiu
looked at Sky King who was currently chained to a metal pillar.</p>
<p>Sky King’s body had been shredded by various meat hooks that
kept him in place. The chains were connected to a giant block of
copper that looked like a beast. There was a weird spirit air
coming out from the copper. It was going to the chains that went
into Sky King’s body. It made Sky King howl in pain.</p>
<p>“Reporting to Mister Leader, I can confirm that things have been
going well,” Shoot Shadow quickly replied. “His Break World rate
has reached 83%. It is very stable. I believe that it will not be
too long before he reaches 90% out of 100.”</p>
<p>“Very good,” Qin Xiu said. “Keep things on track with our
timing. We must make his Break World rate hit 90%, but we cannot
afford any mistakes. We need him and his power to break the 33
skies.”</p>
<p>“Do not worry, Mister Leader. I will not disappoint you.” After
speaking, Shoot Shadow curiously asked, “Mister Leader, do you know
where this guy even came from? How can his power react to the 33
skies? It is quite hard to believe.”</p>
<p>“There is no more time for chit-chat,” Qin Xiu coldly said.
“That is how long we live.”</p>
<p>“My mistake.” Shoot Shadow’s face changed. He kowtowed on the
floor, shaking madly with fear.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu ignored Shoot Shadow’s behavior. He looked at Sky King
and said to himself, “With him, we should be able to break the 33
skies in three months.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed in the geno universe for two or three days. Every
day, he took Ling’er to visit Ji Yanran and watch her kill
xenogeneics. It was a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was now in the geno universe. She was steadily
practicing her battle talents, but her battle abilities were
admittedly not the best. Fortunately, she was talented with Xuan.
Han Sen taught her Under the Sky Knife skills. She learned them
quickly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was studying the Story of Genes. After it became solid,
he used the reverse the Story of Genes and managed to reign it in.
It was no longer as dangerous as it used to be.</p>
<p>Although sometimes the geno chains exploded, it was better than
what happened before. It was now mostly able to be kept under
control. He used the Dao member’s reverse the Story of Genes to his
own advantage. Now, he could successfully use the Story of Genes,
but he really wanted to combine the main and reverse into one. He
was going to need even more knowledge of the Story of Genes for
that to happen. He was not done yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen cared even more about his body’s changes.</p>

<p>That confused Han Sen quite a bit. The Break World genes he knew
were more practically defined as a Break World rating. The Super
God Spirit body’s Break World rate was based on what Han Sen used
to have.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not understand this. The Break World mode of the
Super God Spirit body could not touch anything. No matter how high
a Break World rate was, it was useless. He could only fight in his
solid mode. The Super God Spirit body was useless.</p>
<p>Han Sen had tried it many times. With that Super God Spirit
body, Han Sen could only run the Story of Genes. After running the
Story of Genes, he would get his body back. He would then exit
Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>In that mode, normal people could not see him. Even Break World
creatures could not see him, especially when he was fighting. Only
a handful of people, such as Ling’er and Littleflower, could see
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was most surprised about the fact that Zero and Little
Angel could see him. He was quite confused by this.</p>
<p>Zero and Little Angel did not have spirit bodies. They did not
have a spirit body type. It was unknown how they were able to see
him.</p>
<p>Even if they were able to see him, it was useless. Even though
Ling’er could see Han Sen, she could not touch his body.</p>
<p>“Beautiful Lady, do you want us to take you to hunt gene races?”
A rough voice sounded from far away.</p>
<p>Han Sen was looking at Ji Yanran in the grassy pastures they
occupied from afar. There was a group of Dragon race people
approaching Ji Yanran. They were trying to talk to her.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not in a rush to go over to her. Ever since the year
of Dollar began, humans and Space Garden had risen to become a
powerful faction. Human women were quite popular in the universe.
Many races were quite proud of the fact that they might have
individuals marry human women.</p>
<p>Of course, many beautiful women from all different sorts of
races wanted to marry human men too. Dragons and the humans had a
good relationship. Seeing their faces, they did not seem to be
malicious as they approached Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>“It is fine. I already have someone looking out for me,” Ji
Yanran answered with a smile.</p>
<p>“Who? Who could be better than me, Dragon Two?” The young Dragon
proudly patted himself on the chest.</p>
<p>“It’s that guy over there. I do not even know if I can beat
him.” Ji Yanran pointed at Han Sen, who was chilling with
Ling’er.</p>
<p>Dragon Two and the other Dragon people all looked in the same
direction. When they saw Han Sen’s face, Dragon Two’s face changed.
He shockingly shouted, “Han Sen!”</p>
