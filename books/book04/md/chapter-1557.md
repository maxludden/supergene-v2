  Han Sen hesitated, but he still followed Jia Shidao back to Godslayer Shelter.

According to Jia Shidao, there wasn’t only one super creature; instead, there was a group of them. Also, if someone had enough power to break the skin and flesh of those super creatures, it would be easy to kill them all.

Even Han Sen was interested in that, so he wanted to learn more. Though there were some conflicts between him and Jia Shidao, they were small issues that could be set aside when both of them had proper motivation.

Though Han Sen didn’t particularly want to see members of the Luo family, he wasn’t scared of meeting them.

Godslayer Shelter was enormous, and chances were good that it was a super shelter. However, only a small number of the members were humans, while the vast majority of them were creatures and spirits.

That was normal. After all, there was only a small number of humans in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, so even in shelters belonging to humans, humans were a minority.

Just as Han Sen and Jia Shidao entered the shelter and began walking towards Jia Shidao’s house, Han Sen saw a couple of humans walking towards him. One of them was Luo Li.

Luo Li wasn’t really Luolan’s sister, but Han Sen still needed to call her aunt. A long time ago, Luo Li went to Han Sen and asked him to practice the Falsified-Sky Sutra, but Han Sen didn’t know that the woman was his aunt until his mother told him.

Luo Li was talking to two men as she walked out of the shelter. Two men followed Luo Li’s gaze and saw Han Sen. They didn’t seem to recognize Han Sen.

“Who is this, Jia Shidao? Is he a new demigod?” said one of the men. Despite the fact that he was speaking to an experienced demigod like Jia Shidao, the man was aloof and casual.

Jia Shidao smiled and said, “This is actually a relative of yours. Don’t you know him?”

“Relative? The Luo family doesn’t have any relatives,” Luo Yu said, curling his lips and as if disgusted with what Jia Shidao had just said.

Because of the power of Godslayer Luo, the Luo family had never actually cared about the ordinary people of the Alliance. They didn’t even respect other demigods.

After all, many demigods in Godslayer Shelter were under the protection of the Luo’s, so almost all the demigods venerated those of Luo family, and after a long time, the Luo’s had become filled with pride.

That pride had been injured twice before. One time was when Luo Haitang chose Han Sen as his heir, and the other was when he chose Han Yan as his heir.

They were crushed by that. Though the Luo family wasn’t large, there were plenty of members in the sanctuaries. The fact that Luo Haitang had chosen someone outside the family instead of them deeply frustrated them, and they felt wronged by the Han family.

However, because of their pride, they deliberately showed disdain to the Han’s, and they didn’t even seem to care about Han Sen and Han Yan. They even tried to avoid hearing news of them.

Just like someone would switch channels if they saw someone they hated on TV.

In truth, there were only a few families in the Alliance that the Luo’s actually paid attention to.

“That’s right. Han Sen’s mother is Luo Lan. You guys are uncles of Han Sen,” said Jia Shidao.

Both Luo Yu and Luo Hui were dismayed hearing the names “Han Sen” and “Luolan.” In the Luo family, these two names were taboos.

“You’re Han Sen. It’s impressive that you became a demigod by yourself at such a young age, but you didn’t follow the correct path, so you’ll never make it to the top,” said Luo Yu coldly.

“Is this guy mental?” Han Sen frowned. He’d never met Luo Yu before, but the man was being incredibly impolite for no reason. Little did Han Sen know, many people in the Luo family had wanted to succeed Luo Haitang, yet Luo Haitang had picked Han Sen instead. What’s worse, Han Sen hadn’t given a d*mn about the Falsified-Sky Sutra, which upset the Luo’s.

From the perspective of the Luo’s, they were the most powerful family in the Alliance, so the Falsified-Sky Sutra had to be the strongest technique. How Han Sen behaved was both ignorant and laughable.

“What correct path?” said Han Sen, looking at Luo Yu.

He had something of a grudge against the Luo’s as well, so he wouldn’t just let this matter go.

Luo Yu sneered. “It’s useless to talk to stupid people.”

Finishing that, Luo Yu walked by Han Sen, completely ignoring him.

“Is there something wrong with them?” Han Sen asked with a frown. Luo Yu had been incredibly annoying.

“Let’s go back and talk.” Jia Shidao originally thought that the Han’s were close to the Luo’s, which was why he introduced them to each other. He hadn’t expected the whole thing to turn out so awkwardly, so he changed the topic quickly.

Luo Yu and Luo Hui both walked away. Luo Li looked at Han Sen without saying anything.

She wasn’t a real member of the Luo family, as she was adopted. Though she also had some of the Luo pride, she wasn’t as arrogant as Luo Yu.

And because of Luo Lan, Luo Li paid extra attention to the Han’s, so she knew much more about Han Sen than Luo Yu did. She knew that Han Sen was actually an incredible person, and Luo Yu couldn’t begin to compare with him.

However, she belonged to the Luo family after all, so she shouldn’t say much to Han Sen, who had been scorned by the Luo’s.

Luo Li continued walking with Luo Yu, but she found an excuse to leave soon after. She went to the place where Luo Haitang lived and told him that Han Sen had arrived at Godslayer Shelter.

Han Sen followed Jia Shidao to where he lived. Jia Shidao explained his proposal to Han Sen.

Jia Shidao had discovered a special kind of super creature. These super creatures couldn’t move themselves, but they had exceptional defenses. It was difficult for Jia Shidao and the others to injure mere sacred-blood creatures, so it was impossible for them to kill that kind of super creature.

After seeing Han Sen’s incredible attack power, he had decided to invite Han Sen back as he wanted to collaborate with Han Sen to kill those creatures.

Han Sen didn’t ask where those super creatures were; instead, he asked about their basic characteristics.

Han Sen frowned, then repeated what Jia Shidao had just said. “They are born on the ground, and they have a narrow attack range, so they can just stand there and be hit. Super creatures like that really exist?”

“They’re real! I saw them with my own eyes! I’m the only one who knows that place. If you’re willing to cooperate with me, I’ll take you there in the near future.” Jia Shidao pointed at the sky with his fingers and swore.
