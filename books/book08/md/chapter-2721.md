  The Star Gauge Mirror wasn’t useful for him, but its power was excellent nonetheless. It could rewind time, and that power alone made it exceedingly overpowered.

However, Empty God and the many gods like him were always… economical with the truth. The power of the Star Gauge Mirror wasn’t a lie, but there were limitations to what it could present. Normal people couldn’t use the mirror on a whim as Empty God could.

Of course, Empty God wasn’t going to mention that to Bao’er. He would only let Bao’er see how amazing the Star Gauge Mirror was in his own hands.

Empty God studied Bao’er’s face as he showed off the mirror, hoping that she might exhibit some surprise. Bao’er’s eyes did widen as she watched the image playing across the Star Gauge Mirror, but after watching it for a while, she was confused. She said, “Uncle, this power—in my home—can be achieved through something called a camcorder. We have many items that can showcase the past, like datapads and phones. There are also holograms and other similar gadgets. If you like them that much, then when we head into civilization, I will ask my father to get you the best camcorder money can buy. It will be much prettier than this one. The picture will be much clearer, too. Think of it as a gift for giving me this gem.”

Bao’er looked at him as if she was looking at someone who was very out-of-touch with the modern world. Empty God felt a muscle in his cheek twitch.

He wanted nothing more than to murder Bao’er right there, but he held in his rage. Empty God was being very slow and patient. “This isn’t a camcorder. You can rewind time. It can show you anything that happened in the past.”

“Is there a difference?” Bao’er tilted her head, looking confused.

Empty God opened his mouth to explain, but then he realized that it might be too hard of a concept for a child to understand. Time travel was a complicated subject, and explaining the difference between that and using a camcorder to record past events might be too difficult.

“It is fine if you’re not interested in this power. Star Gauge Mirror has a stronger ability.” Empty God was having trouble reasoning with this child, so he went for a more exciting aspect of Star Gauge Mirror to win her over.

Empty God spun the compass-like dial on the back of the Star Gauge Mirror, and the item began to shine with a wavering light.

Moments later, the mirror was displaying a different image. The Star Tree stood in the center of the picture again, but there were no Star Beetles and neither was there Han Sen.

In the video, there was a man who had a human body and a lion head. He was picking Star Fruit.

But this time, the video was very short. The man picked fruit for a few seconds, and then the video vanished.

“What was that all about?” Bao’er asked with confusion.

After striking a pose that was both mystical and aloof, Empty God answered, “This is the true power of the Star Gauge Mirror. It reveals the future. The footage you have just seen is something that will happen in the near future. There will be a creature like the one you saw coming to collect Star Fruit soon. Everything you see in this mirror is the truth. It will come to pass.”

“Uncle, are you a movie director?” Bao’er looked at Empty God. She blinked, looking curious.

A muscle in Empty God’s cheek spasmed. He suppressed his urge to kill the d*mn kid, and answered her, “Director? I didn’t hire people to film this. I don’t know who this creature is. This is the Star Gauge Mirror showing you what will happen in the future.”

“Ah, it can see the future? Its power is that magical?” Bao’er finally looked surprised. She stared at the Star Gauge Mirror in wide-eyed disbelief.

Seeing Bao’er’s face, Empty God finally felt a bit better. He laughed and said, “This is one of the best true god items in existence. There is no other like it in the whole universe. Just say you want it, and I can give it to you.”

“Really, Uncle? You are such a good man.” Bao’er looked at Empty God with surprise.

“You want it?” Empty God extended the Star Gauge Mirror, holding it out in front of Bao’er. But this time, he reassured himself that he wouldn’t let her touch the mirror before she made a wish, just in case something embarrassing happened.

Bao’er opened her mouth. Judging from the expression on her face, it definitely seemed that she was about to express her desire for the mirror. This filled Empty God with joy. If Bao’er spoke the three words “I want it,” then she would be making a wish to him.

Then, he would gain control of her. And in regards to the Star Gauge Mirror, he would no longer have to give it to her. There were many explanations for making someone’s wish come true, and Empty God already had several different excuses ready for use.

But after Bao’er opened her little mouth, she didn’t say anything. She seemed to suddenly think of something, and she shut her mouth quickly.

“What is it?” Empty God demanded, his heart sinking. Being forced to wait like this was like having an itch that he couldn’t scratch.

Bao’er’s face looked a little excited. She thought of something good and almost burst out laughing. Empty God looked at Bao’er with confusion. He did not know what was so funny about this situation. It made him feel as if something was going on that he was completely oblivious to.

“Uncle, this mirror can predict the future. Isn’t that right?” Bao’er asked, gripping her hands excitedly into fists.

“Yeah,” Empty God said with a nod.

“In that case, it can predict the lottery numbers of the next universal lottery, right? It can win me prizes.” Bao’er looked at Empty God with excitement.

Many races had lotteries, so Empty God was familiar with the concept. The most famous of those universal lotteries was operated by the Thousand Treasures.

The lottery tickets were cheap, but if someone won the top prize, they would earn billions of Thousand Treasures’ coins.

How much money was a billion of those coins? It would be enough to purchase a low-level deified treasure straight from the Thousand Treasures.

Right now, the universal lottery’s price had gone up to a billion. Whoever won the prize could get all that money without paying any taxes.

Throughout the years, many creatures had made wishes to Empty God concerning the universal lottery, and Empty God had various ways of getting them the jackpot. However, Star Gauge Mirror didn’t have this function. The Star Gauge Mirror could only predict things that would happen in the specific location that it was used. In addition, the snippets of the future that it revealed were random. The user couldn’t choose how far into the future they wanted to look.

Empty God had no way of adding a power like this to the Star Gauge Mirror, so he was rendered speechless.

“Uncle, have you never heard of the Big Universe lottery? It is a small card with numbers on it. If you win the prize, you can buy lots and lots and lots of food and clothes.” Bao’er thought Empty God might not know about the universal lottery, so she tried to explain how it worked.

“Star Gauge Mirror is a true god item. It has too much dignity to be used on something so lame,” Empty God said.

“You can’t do it?” Bao’er looked disappointed. Then, she thought of something and asked, “Can it predict what will happen after book seven of Overbearing President Love Luv Looove? Can I see that before it comes out?”

“What the hell is that?” Empty God seemed entirely befuddled.

“It is the work of a very famous comic author. He has a comic that is so good, but the author writes so slowly. There have only been seven books. I want to see what happens next. Can Star Gauge Mirror predict it?” Bao’er looked at Empty God hopefully.

“This…” Empty God’s head was full of black lines. Star Gauge Mirror couldn’t do this. Even if the mirror could reveal the author working on his next comic, it wouldn’t show much. Even in a best-case scenario, Bao’er would get only a glance at the work.
