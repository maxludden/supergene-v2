<p>A moment later, the Original Water King Body became a drop of
water that was as transparent as a small diamond.</p>
<p>“Mutant xenogeneic King hunted. Original Water King: mutant
xenogeneic gene found.”</p>
<p>Feeling rather weak, Han Sen exited his super god spirit mode.
When his body and level increased, the time he could use super god
spirit body tended to increase, as well. But even so, the effort
cost him a lot of power. It was very difficult for him to maintain
his super god spirit mode for any length of time.</p>
<p>“If I become deified, I wonder if I will be able to use super
god spirit mode for a long time?” Han Sen thought to himself. Then
he swallowed the drop of water and used his Blood-Pulse Sutra and
Blood-Pulse Plunder to refine it.</p>
<p>It was similar to the ordinary process of refining things like
the dragon wings and the Stone Cow. After the Blood-Pulse Sutra
refined the water drop, Han Sen obtained a new blood-pulse gene
power. But this time, it was a King class blood-pulse gene
power.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart leaped. He felt his body become transparent
liquid, and it looked as if he was made of water.</p>
<p>“Is this the power of Original Water King Body?” Han Sen was so
happy. He used his body to separate the ripples and waves of the
water. He created a water area-of-effect attack. It was exactly the
same as the one Bai Yi had used on him.</p>
<p>“If I can nab a few more mutant King xenogeneic genes, or even a
deified mutant xenogeneic gene, then I will be invincible.” Han Sen
really loved the combination of the Blood-Pulse Sutra and
Blood-Pulse Plunder.</p>
<p>But Han Sen felt a headache coming on when he thought about the
ramifications of Bai Yi’s death. He had earned this benefit by
killing Bai Yi, but King Bai would definitely start an
investigation. It would be difficult to use his new ability without
drawing suspicion.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang would be aware that Bai Yi had encountered Han
Sen. Even if Bai Ling Shuang did not know, the Extreme King would
surely have someone like Mister White in their midst. Perhaps some
special geno art out there would help them deduce that Han Sen
really was the one who killed Bai Yi.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura and Purple-Eye Butterfly to erase
any trace of him being there. He could take comfort in the
knowledge that super god spirit mode wouldn’t leave any evidence
behind. No one should be able to find out exactly what transpired
there.</p>
<p>Super god spirit body truly left nothing behind. It was
impossible for him to be found out by a mere geno art.</p>
<p>But Bai Yi had died where Han Sen had appeared, and there
weren’t many guards going to Planet King Kong. Even if they had no
evidence of him being responsible, King Bai might just decide to
slay any and all suspects just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t stay on Planet King Kong any longer. He retrieved
the body of the Metal Doll and left. He needed to figure out a way
to escape the realm of the Extreme King if his murder of Bai Yi was
ever exposed.</p>
<p>In fact, staying there was too dangerous already.</p>
<p>Han Sen left Planet King Kong and returned to the space station.
There, he waited for an airship that would take him away from
Knight’s Paradise. A woman approached and sat next to Han Sen. She
looked right at him.</p>
<p>“Brother Sixteen, you used Return to Origin?” the woman asked
with shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he tried to replicate Bai Yi’s
voice. He coldly said, “That Han Sen was quite good to force me to
do this. Bai Ling Shuang, did you try to trick me?”</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang laughed. “Brother Sixteen, you made the decision
to go there. It’s not my fault that things turned out this way, but
by combining yourself with Han Sen… I can tell you that you now
look much better.”</p>
<p>“Bai Ling Shuang.” Han Sen’s face was hard. He used Original
Water King Body, and his entire body transformed into transparent
water. The Water King area-of-effect spread to envelop the entire
space station.</p>
<p>“Brother Sixteen, why are you so angry?” Bai Ling Shuang stood
inside the area-of-effect, but she seemed completely undisturbed.
It was like the scary spread of water had no effect on her.</p>
<p>Blue light shone around Bai Ling Shuang, and her beautiful smile
and sexy body made her look like a goddess that had descended from
the sky. It looked as if nothing in the world could make her
dirty.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang’s blue light spread, and it froze Han Sen’s
water area-of-effect. She waved a hand and cracked it, allowing the
shards to spill all over the floor.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Bai Ling Shuang was half-deified. She was
at the very top of her league, too. She was far stronger than Bai
Yi.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang broke the area-of-effect, and then the blue
light faded away. She said quietly, “You did what you had to do. I
won’t forget what I promised you. Two nights from now, go to Night
Charm Town. I won’t pay you any less than the sum we
discussed.”</p>
<p>After that, Bai Ling Shuang turned to leave. After taking two
steps, though, she thought of something. She turned around and
said, “Brother Sixteen, since you have merged with Han Sen’s body,
you should use his identity while you can.”</p>
<p>“What do you want now?” Han Sen snarled.</p>
<p>The woman flicked one of her blonde locks away from her forehead
and smiled. “Han Sen brought a half-deified xenogeneic with him.
You should go and take everything he has. I saw the xenogeneics,
and their genes are good. One of them could be deified. You could
gain a lot by nabbing a xenogeneic like that.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to tell me that. I know what to do.” Han Sen
looked at her with contempt.</p>
<p>“Remember, in two days, Night Charm Town.” Bai Ling Shuang
smiled and said nothing more. She stood up and left the space
station.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head swam with confusion. This was a complicated
situation, and now he had to make a decision.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang thought Bai Yi was Han Sen. An ordinary Duke
really couldn’t have endured what Han Sen had. Not even most King
class elites would have survived Bai Yi’s hand.</p>
<p>The only good thing for Han Sen was that Bai Yi had used his
Return to Origin. Bai Ling Shuang knew this. After he used Return
to Origin, Bai Yi would look just like Han Sen. He would eventually
change back to his original appearance, but it would be a slow
process.</p>
<p>Now that Han Sen had the Original Water King Body, he could keep
up his disguise as Bai Yi. He could be mistaken for Prince Sixteen
of the Extreme King.</p>
<p>This would be much safer than King Bai learning that Bai Yi was
dead.</p>
<p>If Bai Yi had succeeded with Return to Origin, then he could
have claimed everything belonging to Han Sen, including his
memories.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had only refined Bai Yi’s mutant gene. He had the
Original Water King Body, but none of the man’s memories.
Attempting to keep up his disguise as Bai Yi would be risky. There
was still a good chance of him being exposed.</p>
<p>“There is nothing else I can do, though. I have to try.” Han Sen
tried to calm down, and he thought about what to do next. He didn’t
want to draw any more suspicion.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t know anything about Bai Yi. From his short
time of observation, Bai Yi was a man that didn’t look too far
ahead.</p>
<p>“Even so, I have to find the blood kirin and the others. Then I
will have to go to Bai Yi’s house.” Han Sen made the decision in
his heart. He wasn’t going to hesitate.</p>
<p>With what had happened, he had no choice but to try.</p>
