<h2>Blue Gold Demon Bug</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2082</h3>

<p>That massive power, brought down with Yisha’s knife, tore its
body in half. The part with the head fell down to roll through the
streets of the city.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were busy killing the smaller
xenogeneics. When Han Sen saw half of its body coming toward him,
his first thought wasn’t to get an easy kill; it was to dodge the
thing.</p>
<p>The Blue Gold Demon Bug’s lifeforce was scary. Being cut in half
wouldn’t kill the creature immediately. And a half- deified elite
could kill most weaker beings just by moving its finger.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the other half of the body did not come that way.
Yisha teleported over and slashed the head of the beast.</p>
<p>The body was already injured. The head had a few wounds in it,
exposing some of its brain. There was no muscle or blood, though.
On the inside, the creature was composed of metal machinery and
gears.</p>
<p>The Blue Gold Demon Bugs were strange, and this was reflected in
their lifeforce. They were beings of metal.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>More breaking sounds were heard. The Blue Gold Demon Bug’s head
was chopped in two, opening like a cut watermelon now. Han Sen
could see the blue crystal xenogeneic gene that had almost fallen
out.</p>
<p>No matter how strong that bug was, that strike ought to have
killed it.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw half of its head roll his way. There was still a
distance between him and it, but he teleported closer. He went to
that half of the head and used his knife to dig out the blue
crystal core.</p>
<p>He did not dare to take the xenogeneic gene, but he wanted to
test his luck. He wanted to see if he could get an easy kill
register by doing so. There was a chance he’d get a beast soul or
something.</p>
<p>That half of the head still trembled a little, but after Han Sen
removed the core, the body stilled.</p>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted. Blue Gold Demon Bug King:
xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Blue Gold Demon Bug King beast
soul.”</p>
<p>A voice played in Han Sen’s head, and upon hearing it, Han Sen
almost thought he could hear a choir of angels singing. It felt
like he was going to transcend to a higher plane of existence.</p>
<p>Han Sen just wanted to give it a shot; the chances of actually
gaining a beast soul had been virtually nonexistent. Luckily, no
one around him knew what had just happened. Han Sen himself was
struggling to believe it.</p>
<p>“Good people always have good karma. It is lucky that I have
been such a good boy for so long. It hurt to let them kill so many
Marquises and Dukes, but now it is all worth it.” Han Sen was
ecstatic.</p>
<p>After the Blue Gold Demon Bug King died, the rest of the bugs
became frenzied. There was no order or cohesion to their formation,
which made the work of killing them a lot easier.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly lifted the blue crystal core and lobbed it at
Yisha. He also shouted, “Queen, you should take this before it gets
lost in the fight!”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen continued killing the Blue Gold Demon
Bugs.</p>
<p>Trying to steal the Blue Gold Demon Bug’s xenogeneic gene would
be foolish. For now, Han Sen was satisfied with obtaining that
King-class beast soul.</p>
<p>Yisha caught the blue crystal core and put it away. She then
returned to space to help Black-Moon King and the others kill the
other King-class Blue Gold Demon Bugs.</p>
<p>The situation had taken a turn for the better, and the Blue Gold
Demon Bugs were no longer much of a threat. Han Sen led Overbearing
Teeth Duke in a rush against their foes, killing many bugs and
xenogeneics as they went.</p>
<p>When the situation improved further, Han Sen found a chance to
take down some Duke Blue Gold Demon Bugs and xenogeneics by
himself. He didn’t gain any additional beast souls by doing this,
however.</p>
<p>With Yisha’s help, the King-class Blue Gold Demon Bugs were all
destroyed. When Yisha rejoined Black-Moon King, the horde of bugs
knew that their time of death was nigh.</p>
<p>Many nobles had been killed in Narrow Moon that day, but
fortunately, Han Sen had been there to lead a highly-trained team
in pulling many of the bugs and xenogeneics away to lessen
casualties.</p>
<p>Even so, that bug disaster was the worst crisis Narrow Moon had
endured in many centuries.</p>
<p>The bugs that flew to other planets were eventually killed, too.
Han Sen found a few Marquise and Duke xenogeneics to claim for
himself, and when all was said and done, he had earned quite a
bit.</p>
<p>The biggest reward was the mutant King-class beast soul, of
course. If the bug’s head hadn’t rolled right in front of him, Han
Sen had no idea how long he might have had to wait to benefit from
a King xenogeneic. The fact that this one was mutant was just the
icing on the cake.</p>
<p>After that fight, Han Sen’s reputation grew even larger. He had
led the Dukes to fight the monsters, and his performance that day
was given grand compliments by many Narrow Moon nobles.</p>
<p>Sad Night was the one who opened the blue metal cube, so he had
unleashed the invasion of the Blue Gold Demon Bugs. He hadn’t been
killed, but he had been arrested. He was pending an investigation
into his actions. In the end, Han Sen heard nothing about what
happened to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen, on the other hand, received a reward from the Full Moon
Council. He was the recipient of many geno fluids, which he could
use to practice. He was also bestowed many titles and many more
benefits.</p>
<p>Han Sen had permission to join Moon Garden, but he wasn’t going
to be a student this time. Now he was offered the opportunity of
being a teacher.</p>
<p>Yisha wouldn’t let Han Sen join Moon Garden just to become a
student. Han Sen had the Teacher title in Sky Palace, and it would
be an insult to Sky Palace if he was only a student in Moon
Garden.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, though, he received many more rewards.
Planet Eclipse was exempt from paying taxes for an additional fifty
years, which saved Han Sen a lot of money.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s performance wasn’t the only reason he was so
generously rewarded; Yisha played a big part in fighting for what
he was given. Without an important figure like her backing him, Han
Sen wouldn’t have received half as many rewards.</p>
<p>After all was said and done, though, Yisha called on Han Sen to
visit her in the palace.</p>
<p>You did well, but The Story of Genes isn’t Marquise yet. How did
you earn so much power?” Yisha randomly asked, while holding
Bao’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen had wondered if she might ask this, so he had a lie
already prepared. He said, “I practiced Consume. I discovered that
Consume can steal the powers of xenogeneics, like these dragon
wings. I took them out of Sharon’s xenogeneic gene. And as a
result, these dragon wings have the Break Space Flash power.”</p>
<p>Because no one aside from the Consuming Ants could practice
Consume, Yisha wouldn’t be able to tell if he was lying.</p>
