    <p>
      Despite the fact that the fairy continued to chase him, Han Sen still
      decided to push on and make his escape. After all, the twin-tail scorpion
      was only a first-generation super creature, as opposed to the
      second-generation one that lusted for his blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to escape the underground labyrinth, first and foremost.
      Despite being drained of energy, he still had to keep his gene lock open
      to enable his flight. He just hoped the twin-tail scorpion would not be
      made aware of his presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      But lady luck did not smile on Han Sen, for the scorpion noticed him. With
      its gnashing pincers, it did not wait a single moment before racing
      towards him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth as his heart kicked into overdrive. The power in
      his arms was focused; he leapt into the air like a sparrow in the breeze,
      and spun around doing loops to dodge the scorpion&#8217;s tail-sting and
      pincer-snap combo. After launching right over the scorpion&#8217;s head
      and successfully evading his foe&#8217;s attack, Han Sen remained airborne
      in his flight towards the exit.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he flew, he returned and redeployed the little angel, hoping that the
      scorpion would turn its attention to her and engage her for a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scorpion, however, let out a wheezy shriek and turned around to
      continue its pursuit of Han Sen. The wag of its legs and pincers were
      incredibly fast, and it skittered so quickly, it might as well have
      sprouted wings.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy had caught up now, as well, and it didn&#8217;t even blink at
      the scorpion. All she did was fly past it, wholly fixated on Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Today is not a good day. How can I be this unlucky?&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s heart was sinking fast, but soon after, he was greeted with
      the open skies atop the slopes of the mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen wasn&#8217;t the only one keen to make an exit, as the fairy
      and scorpion quickly bolted out of the subterranean labyrinth, as well.
      Han Sen summoned and redeployed the little angel in response, hoping she
      could snare the fairy&#8217;s attention for a time and keep her occupied.
      Han Sen, in the meantime, took off running in the direction of the
      Yellowstone City.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the little angel&#8217;s suppression of the fairy, Han Sen&#8217;s
      gambit was a success, and his nemesis could no longer keep up with him. It
      was fortunate, for by now, he had slowed. The scorpion was still on him,
      though, and it managed to sting his buttocks more than a few times with
      its tail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, he was still clad in his berserk super armor, and this provided
      the protection he very much needed. Although the tail&#8217;s stinger
      managed to pierce through the plate, the subsequent damage was
      significantly reduced and the literal pain in his ass just made him shout.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scorpion&#8217;s tail was very sharp, and if it wasn&#8217;t for the
      protection provided by the armor, it would have skewered his entire body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s body was exhausted, but he had little time to pay his
      tiredness heed. On and on, he kept running in the direction of the shelter
      he had previously departed. It was now in sight, and just that mere glance
      perked up his rapidly declining spirits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei had waited two whole days for Han Sen&#8217;s return, but he
      had yet to show up. She was as mad as she was sad, at his absence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Asshole. Horny bastard. Scumbag. I can&#8217;t believe he just left
      me hanging like that. I curse him to be eaten by creatures!&#8221; Zhou
      Yumei&#8217;s spirits had rarely dipped so low, and so she just lay
      slouched on the bench outside the shelter&#8217;s gates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being alone for over a year had taken its toll on Zhou Yumei, and her
      brief interaction with Han Sen made her realize how afraid of being alone
      she now was. Meeting him was an extremely rare stroke of luck, and
      although she wasn&#8217;t particularly fond of his character, his presence
      still enthused her.
    </p>

    <p>
      At least she did not have to remain under the desert&#8217;s baking sun,
      alone. Even arguing with the bad guy was better than being alone, bored to
      death.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was worse was the fact he had just left without saying a single word.
      Her eyes were now swelling red at the thought of no goodbye.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Zhou Yumei cursed him to high-heaven, she suddenly saw the man running
      towards her with extreme speed. It made her overjoyed, and she immediately
      stood up and shouted to Han Sen, &#8220;Mister Asshole! I thought you were
      gone for good; what brought you back?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen removed his armor and approached Zhou Yumei like the wind. He
      didn&#8217;t say anything to her; he just grabbed her by the waist and
      carried her inside the city.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You sick pervert; let me go!&#8221; Zhou Yumei was a little
      embarrassed and tried to shout as she struggled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Take a look at what is following me. Do you really want me to leave
      you as their lunchtime snack?&#8221; Han Sen casually told her, as he
      continued to run forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei then took a proper look, and she saw the twin-tail scorpion
      that ravenously followed. She also saw the little angel further behind,
      but not the fairy. The fairy was too small for her to see from that
      distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Zhou Yumei quickly understood what was happening and her face changed
      as swiftly as one could turn a page. She said, &#8220;Big Brother, run
      faster!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The scorpion waved its tail as it approached, trying to sting them, and
      Zhou Yumei&#8217;s heart leapt at the creature&#8217;s every attempted
      strike. With each dodge, a gasp and a tear or two would follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t have the time to respond, and simply rushed into the
      shelter. He turned around to take a look and noticed that only the
      scorpion had followed them inside the city. The fairy seemed wary of
      something and stopped pursuing them near the gate. She flapped her wings
      in the air but did not go inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      This turn of events made Han Sen happy. If he only had to deal with the
      scorpion, he could manage, and he would no longer be forced to run for his
      life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ran towards the plaza and simply waited for his little angel to
      deal with the scorpion.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Meow!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Little Orange saw Zhou Yumei getting chased by the scorpion, and it
      growled angrily in response. With rage, it rushed towards the creature to
      engage.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Little Orange!&#8221; Zhou Yumei worriedly called out.</p>

    <p>
      Although Little Orange had jumped onto the scorpion, the foul creature
      lived up to its namesake and spread its tail in two. With both ends, it
      stabbed Little Orange, making the cat cry out in pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Please save him; Little Orange cannot fight the scorpion. He used
      to run-off whenever we saw it in the past.&#8221; Zhou Yumei was dribbling
      tears, as she pleaded for Han Sen&#8217;s aid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not make a move, but the silver fox acted on his behalf and
      spat out a bolt of silver lightning to nastily strike the scorpion&#8217;s
      head.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The scorpion was shaken by the lightning, and Little Orange managed to
      free itself. But then, Little Orange sunk its teeth into one of the
      scorpion&#8217;s tails and made a hissing sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      As it writhed in pain, the twin-tail scorpion raised its other tail and
      took aim at Little Orange&#8217;s head.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox jumped down near the scorpion and bit into the other tail,
      in a desperate bid to save Little Orange&#8217;s life.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the little angel finally arrived, she swung her greatsword down on
      the scorpion&#8217;s head under Han Sen&#8217;s command. The shell of its
      head cracked open, as green fluids squirted out of the crushed carapace.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hzzzh!&#8221; The twin-tail scorpion hissed and squealed in immense
      pain. It wagged both of its tails, attempting to shake off Little Orange
      and the silver fox that clung onto it with their teeth. But it was to no
      avail, as their teeth had been driven deep and they had a firm grip.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel&#8217;s face looked cold as she raised her greatsword.
      She brought it down again and lopped off the scorpion&#8217;s pincers and
      claws to prevent any more possible attacks.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      The little angel brought the greatsword down upon its head continuously
      after that, which fully exposed the innards of its head. In one final
      attack, the little angel clutched the greatsword&#8217;s hilt with both
      hands and drove it down right through the head of the scorpion, pinning it
      to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Rawr&#8230;&#8221; The scorpion, as it slowly slipped into the
      embrace of death, waved its tails quicker than ever and managed to shake
      Little Orange and the silver fox off. With a few final twitches, it gave
      up the ghost.
