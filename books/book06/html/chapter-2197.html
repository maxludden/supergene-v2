<p>“Where is the Jade Drum? Give it to me, and I will permit you to
live.” The Taurus began to approach Huangfu Jing, lifting his
creepy weapon to point it at her threateningly.</p>
<p>The weapon looked very strange. It was roughly the shape of a
greatsword, but the back of the greatsword had a rectangular slot.
Inside of that slot, there was something that looked like a
string.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing gave no response, so the Taurus Marquise looked at
her murderously. He unleashed a strike in her direction.</p>
<p>That strike was strong. The string in the slot moved and made a
sharp sound.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing dodged it. She immediately flowed into her Heavenly
Go and phoenix movements, the latter of which she had learned from
Han Sen. Just as she was about to evade that swordstrike, she
suddenly realized that a sonic attack was coming for her, as well.
It struck her, and it made her body shake. Her brain felt as if it
had been prodded with a number of prickly needles.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The disorientation allowed the sword to hit Huangfu Jing’s body,
and the blow sent her flying away. Blood trailed behind her through
the air.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Huangfu Jing was incredible capable at evasive
maneuvers. She had a strong will, too, so after that sonic attack,
she immediately returned to dodging. If she hadn’t done this, her
arm would have been hacked off.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want me to cut your limbs off one by one, then
give me the Jade Drum.” The Taurus Marquise’s eyes looked to be on
fire. His four legs sprinted towards Huangfu Jing, and his arms
lifted the greatsword above his head.</p>
<p>And then, the shadow of a red beast appeared behind him. It
roared as the greatsword moved. And as this occurred, the sonic
powers surged angrily into her brain.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing wiped the blood off of her face and slipped back
into her Heavenly Go movements to avoid her foe.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing felt as if her brain was being stabbed by knives.
It almost left her paralyzed. Still, she managed to dodge the
strike and avoid getting hit.</p>
<p>The Taurus Marquise saw Huangfu Jing evade his greatsword, and
he frowned. He looked angrier than ever, following that.</p>
<p>“It is useless!” he barked. “With my sonic sword, you will not
live. Your only hope is to give me the Jade Drum.”</p>
<p>After that, the greatsword came swinging at Huangfu Jing with
even more speed. The sound emitted by the string grew louder and
louder.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing’s expression didn’t change at all, though. She
calmly looked at the Taurus Marquise, and then her body began to
change.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing had a geno armament, which had come after she
initially obtained a geno armor. Just like Han Sen’s Dongxuan
Sutra, it provided her with an entire set of armor.</p>
<p>The gold geno armament clad her entire body. Although it was
just an Earl set, it was still very powerful. It was no weaker than
the armors possessed by the very top Earls.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the scariest thing about her. A strange power
started to brew within the gold armor. It changed her actual
body.</p>
<p>A gold light began to shine from her armor, and the armor itself
began to look like red steel. She looked as if she had just emerged
from a pool of lava.</p>
<p>There was no heat coming off of her, though, and the growing
power remained contained by the armor. It made her shine gold.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The greatsword slashed, but this time, Huangfu Jing did not
dodge. She raised her arm and grabbed the falling blade. That
slashing power was brought to a dead halt by Huangfu Jing’s hand.
The blade came to a standstill, and despite the force the Taurus
was using, the blade refused to descend any further.</p>
<p>The gold-looking hand was glowing, and a flurry of sparks spewed
out from the point of contact. The Taurus stared with wide eyes. He
could not believe an Earl had managed to block his sword. He was so
angry that he couldn’t help but roar. As he held his greatsword, he
began to apply even more force in a bid to drive it downwards.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing’s eyes shone, and the gold light radiated
powerfully from her form. Her other hand was like a blade then, and
it came across her body to slash the assaulting greatsword.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The greatsword’s string snapped under Huangfu Jing’s strike, and
the sharp noises were at last brought to an end. But the force
drove Huangfu Jing to her knees on the ground.</p>
<p>“Even without sonic powers, killing you will be a satisfying
endeavor!” the Taurus thundered. His muscles were bulging, and his
shadow looked furious. The greatsword came slashing down at the
half-kneeling Huangfu Jing.</p>
<p>Even as the greatsword came bearing down on her, Huangfu Jing
remained absolutely calm. And then, she moved. She ignored the
incoming strike of the greatsword as her gold fist punched up
towards the Taurus.</p>
<p>“Damn!” The Taurus Marquise looked upset, but he was still
greedy. He had only aimed for her hand. He didn’t want to kill her
just yet. He needed her to locate the Jade Drum for him, after
all.</p>
<p>Just as the greatsword was just about to hit Huangfu Jing, her
body suddenly disappeared. She teleported behind him, and her fist
was driven into the back of his head.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>That brightly-lit fist hit the back of the Taurus’ head like a
hammer. It broke through his protection and wrecked his helmet.</p>
<p>The Sagittarius was both shocked and enraged, and so he hastily
swung his sword behind him.</p>
<p>But the greatsword found no target. It couldn’t touch her, as
her body teleported to his left side. A powerful leg swung toward
his neck with the ferocity and speed of a hunting cat.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The glowing leg was like an ax as it came forward to strike his
neck. The leg broke the armor of his neck and drew blood from his
flesh.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing did not stop, though. She appeared all around him,
striking like a killing machine. She attacked him with her fists,
fingers, elbows, legs, and knees. She left the Taurus an abundance
of wounds. His armor kept breaking further and further with each
hit.</p>
<p>The Taurus Marquise looked as shocked as some stupid bear. No
matter how much he struggled now, he wasn’t able to attack Huangfu
Jing, and every attempted counterattack just ended with him getting
hit again.</p>
<p>The Taurus was covered in his own blood. Anger, fear, and
hopelessness were painted all across his face. It made him scream
in pain.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Amidst those crazy attacks, the rest of the Taurus’ armor broke.
Huangfu Jing ripped his head off completely, and the headless body
slumped to the floor, squirting blood.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing settled herself back down on the floor. Her face
hadn’t changed at all. The light glowing from her faded gradually,
until she looked like her usual self again.</p>
<p>Han Sen had arrived in time to witness Huangfu Jing make use of
her super god body. Her performance really impressed him. “Killer
Queen’s super god body is real. The unlimited teleporting ability
will be more than enough to carry her through this universe.”</p>
