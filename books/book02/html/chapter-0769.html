	<p>&#8220;Will you follow me along the path of evolution?&#8221; the man said with a cold tone of voice, looking at
		the rhino.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Roof!&#8221; the rhino responded to the man. Then, it began flying towards the metal door. Hovering beside
		the man, it turned around to look at the desert as if it was going to miss the place.</p>

	<p>The man had a smile, and then he brought the rhino to leave. He casually looked around and seemed surprised. Just
		as he was preparing to lead the rhino through the door, he scanned the creatures on the ground.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could suddenly feel that the man&#8217;s eyes were aimed at him, and there was no chance of him being
		mistaken about that.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Why would I even bother looking at him? This man is bringing whoever he wants. Even super
		creatures would not dare look at him. It seems all I ever do is look for trouble!&#8221; Han Sen wanted to slap
		himself.</p>

	<p>Earlier, things seemed to be proceeding without trouble for him. But Han Sen realized his foolishness in looking
		the man&#8217;s way, and now, the mysterious man had him in his sights.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt incredibly nervous. If he could have run away, he would have done so in a heartbeat. But he
		wasn&#8217;t the only one still pinned down to the ground, as the fairy, black-flame phoenix, and green kirin
		were, too. Han Sen&#8217;s chance of escape was slimmer than ever.</p>

	<p>After seeing Han Sen where he lay, the man looked upon him with interest. With a finger, he pointed at him.</p>

	<p>A black laser beam fell on Han Sen&#8217;s head.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Is this it? Am I going to die?&#8221; Han Sen used all his strength to try to dodge out of the
		way, but try as he might, he could not move an inch.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The beam of light struck Han Sen&#8217;s head, and his heart felt cold for a second.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s karma. I&#8217;ve been smacking people&#8217;s heads all my life. Now, it is my turn to be
		smacked in the head. Maybe I deserve this, but if I don&#8217;t have a head, will anyone be able to recognize
		who I am when my body is discovered? That&#8217;s to assume my body will remain intact; with all these creatures
		around, I&#8217;ll be chow in no-time. I doubt even my bones will remain. Can I not even tell my family
		goodbye?&#8221; Han Sen felt so sad in his heart.</p>

	<p>But it was then like nothing happened. The beam of light did not crush his skull, as expected. He felt no pain at
		all. It was as if the beam of light was nothing but an illusion.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are my man.&#8221; The man lifted his lips as he spoke, then turned around and departed beyond the
		metal door.</p>

	<p>The holy rhino followed him inside, and then the door shut. As slowly as it first appeared, it now disappeared
		into nothingness.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was finally able to move, and the first thing he did was quickly touch his head. Much to his relief, his
		head was firm, warm, and whole. He was super pleased, and so he thought, &#8220;My head is still here. Yay! I am
		not dead.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But a second later, he spared no time for celebration. He summoned his Golden Roarer, and with the fairy
		alongside, rode over to the sand crater.</p>

	<p>It wasn&#8217;t just Han Sen who went there, either. All the creatures, black-flame phoenix and green kirin
		included, raced forward. There were some bones and flesh that had been left behind by the rhino. It was the meat
		of a top super creature, and clearly the aim of everyone&#8217;s desire.</p>

	<p>The black-flame phoenix and green kirin sprinted there, firing flame and thunder as they went. Any creature that
		attempted to steal from them, they killed mercilessly.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had the little angel and fairy to protect him, however. And quickly, he leapt towards the mound of flesh.
		He summoned his Death Knell and lobbed it into the blood.</p>

	<p>An idea then sprang upon Han Sen, and he chucked the gourd in there, too. Although he didn&#8217;t know whether
		or not it would have an effect, this was a remarkably unique opportunity, and he didn&#8217;t want to let this
		chance pass him by.</p>

	<p>The black-flame phoenix and green kirin jumped towards the meat and began devouring it as best they could.
		Although they ate like mad, they still managed to incinerate anything that came close.</p>

	<p>The fairy took the time to grab a bite to eat, too. Her little mouth worked incredibly quickly to gobble down
		decent chunks of meat.</p>

	<p>The little angel had her fair share, as well. So, Han Sen then summoned Meowth and let it dine on some.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was currently regretting his decision to leave the silver fox behind. If that little silver black hole
		was here, it would be in ecstasy at the prospect of all this food.</p>

	<p>The rhino was incredibly large. Even though those two monsters were slaughtering creatures, others were able to
		join in and eat from afar.</p>

	<p>Han Sen lay on the ground to have a sip of the blood, but after giving it a taste, quickly spat it all out. The
		blood was like acid, and it almost melted his entire mouth and tongue.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is this? Can only creatures consume this?&#8221; Han Sen was disheartened, seeing all the other
		creatures jovially eat to their heart&#8217;s content.</p>

	<p>The little angel had no problem, either. It was only Han Sen who was not able to take part in eating the
		rhino&#8217;s remains. Han Sen did not want to give up so easily, however. Instead of trying to drink the blood,
		he grabbed a chunk of meat and bit into it. It tasted like lime, and it burnt his mouth fiercely. Quickly, he
		spat it all out.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Holy smokes! What is happening?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was incredibly sad, and his inability to eat
		the meat drove him nuts.</p>

	<p>Suddenly, Han Sen remembered a tear had fallen from the rhino. The tear seemed as if it had solidified, and he
		wondered if it was still there.</p>

	<p>From what Han Sen could recall, it fell into the pool of blood. He snuck over to where he had seen it fall and
		rummaged around for it. If it did not melt, then it had to still be there.</p>

	<p>After a while, his hands touched something circular. With a quick rebound of joy and excitement, he pulled it up.
	</p>

	<p>It was indeed the rhino&#8217;s teardrop. It was transparent, and about the size of a fist. Although it came out
		of the blood, it hadn&#8217;t been stained by it. Strange, considering Han Sen&#8217;s hand was all mucky with
		the blood it had been submerged in. It was fortunate he was wearing beast soul armor, too. If he wasn&#8217;t,
		he imagined his skin would have all melted away by now.</p>

	<p>Han Sen held the tear and felt a lot of energy coursing around inside it. The item itself felt incredibly holy.
		Merely holding it soothed his being, as if being in its proximity cleansed him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now this is some good stuff.&#8221; Han Sen was ecstatic, and he carefully pocketed the tear.</p>

	<p>Han Sen pulled out a bag and placed some meat inside it, so he could offer it to the silver fox when he returned.
		He couldn&#8217;t let the silver fox—the creature that loved to eat so much—go without this sort of food.</p>

	<p>Of course, Han Sen also harbored the desire to see the silver fox grow up a little faster. An adult silver fox
		was sure to be incredibly powerful, and if it never grew up, his investment in the little creature would have
		been a waste.</p>
