  There was no getting rid of Ning Yue, so Han Sen had to bring her with him. Gu Qingcheng, Elysian Moon, Bao’er, and the little red bird also came along. Fang Qing Yu decided to stay behind.

The further into the depths they went, the scarier the wind became. Whenever the wind blew, not even Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon could keep their balance. They didn’t know why the wind was becoming so strong as they went deeper.

For there to be so much wind, there had to be a windy exit. But when he looked down, what was seen was a hellish crack. No air could escape.

Ning Yue was scared, but she was unaffected. The little green sword she wielded kept the scary wind from getting close to her.

“I wonder what that little green sword is? Its abilities are too scary,” Han Sen said with a sigh.

As Han Sen was thinking, the white tiger suddenly disappeared. It was like it had just vanished into thin air.

“Why has the white tiger disappeared?” Ning Yue shouted in fear.

Before Han Sen could answer, the white tiger was there again. It rumbled at Han Sen, and while Han Sen was still reeling from the shock, it disappeared again.

Han Sen and the others moved carefully forward and found a hole in the ground. It dropped almost straight down, which was why it looked like the white tiger had disappeared.

Due to the angle, Han Sen hadn’t noticed the hole until they were right on top of it.

They followed the white tiger down, and what they found at the bottom caught Han Sen by surprise.

It was a jar-shaped cave. They came in from the side, but there was no other exit. That place was a dead end.

The fact that the cave was a dead end wasn’t what had caught their attention, though. There was something in the cave.

Han Sen didn’t recognize the device. Most of it was obscured by the stone that covered it, and only about one foot of it could be seen. The device was purple like copper, and there were some strange symbols carved across it. It looked like the handle of something, but it wasn’t like the grip of a sword or a knife. That was because this handle was only as thick as a couple of Han Sen’s fingers. And even with the little they could see right now, the group knew that it was too long to be a normal handle.

Boom!

Han Sen and the others were still looking at that purple copper object that was buried by rocks when suddenly, a weird symbol shone with purple light. And right after, a scary storm came out of the purple object.

Everyone was blown away by the wind. They bounced around the cave like rubber balls until the wind escaped through the passage they had used to enter. The respite afterward allowed them to get back on their feet.

Han Sen and the little red bird had been left rather disheveled by the abrupt gust. The wind was far stronger than what they had experienced before.

The wind was comparatively gentle when it entered the tunnel, but inside that cave, they were exposed to the full power of the gusts.

“What is this? How can it be so powerful?” Han Sen looked at the purple copper object with shock. His eyes were glowing.

“Meow.” The white tiger had walked over to stand next to the purple copper object. It used a paw to point at the item, and then it called to Han Sen.

“You mean, you want me to get it out of there?” Han Sen asked.

“Meow,” the white tiger said with a nod.

Gu Qingcheng was staring intently at the purple copper object, and she made a guess. “Maybe this thing can restrain the monster outside.”

“Meow.” The white tiger immediately nodded after hearing Gu Qingcheng speak.

“Is such a thing possible?” Han Sen thought, suddenly excited by the prospect. He had been trying to think of a way they could deal with the monster on the island, but he hadn’t yet come up with anything. If this weapon could be used against their enemies, then their crisis would be resolved. And Han Sen would receive another treasure, to boot. This was good.

Han Sen didn’t say anything, and he went straight up to the purple copper object. He used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine it.

The Purple-Eye Butterfly spun around in Han Sen’s eye like four cherry blossoms. Within Han Sen’s vision, the history of the purple copper object began to play back like a movie.

Han Sen was shocked. While the Purple-Eye Butterfly was rewinding, he was able to see what it was. It was a purple copper jian swordbreaker.

The jian was a very rare weapon. It looked like a sword, but the blade was square. Rather than having a typical blade, which focused on sharpness, this weapon was all about strength.

Ordinary jians were used in pairs, so a single jian was rare.

There was only one weapon here, though. There might have been another one lying around somewhere, but if so, Han Sen hadn’t seen it yet.

For some reason, the jian had been left behind in the black sea. Layers of sediment had accumulated from the black sea, slowly building up to form the island they were currently inside.

Based on its depth, Han Sen couldn’t help but wonder if the weapon had somehow drawn the sediment together to make this entire mushroom island.

But that jian’s weird symbols kept releasing storms, so its handle was clear of any rock. Furthermore, it had carved out an entire cave. Based on how well it was hidden, Han Sen had no idea how the white tiger had found it.

Han Sen then had a weird thought. “That means this island is a stone inside the Black Hole Spider’s stomach. The spider should have expelled any substances it couldn’t digest over the years. Instead, because of this purple copper jian, the substances have built up into a solid mass. After billions of years, this entire island has been created.”

“Let me try it,” Elysian Moon said. As Han Sen watched, Elysian Moon walked over to the purple copper jian. She cast a power and wrapped her hands around the exposed portion.

Pang!

Before Elysian Moon applied any strength to her grip, a frightening gale of wind blasted her body away at lightning speed. Han Sen and the others didn’t fare much better.

They did not know what the purple copper jian was, but the fact that it could release such power when no one was even using it was amazing. Not even the little red bird could withstand the wind it summoned. This wasn’t an ordinary item, that was for sure.

“It looks like a deified weapon with a wind element. Is there anyone who is a master of the element of wind?” Gu Qingcheng said.

Everyone swapped glances with each other. No one there really focused on wind.

“Let’s keep trying. Maybe we don’t have to be too attuned with the wind element. If we can’t pull it out, we can remove the rocks that are surrounding it,” Han Sen said.

Elysian Moon nodded and drew her paper umbrella. She used it as a sword and slashed at the rocks atop the purple copper jian. The tip of the umbrella unleashed a raging swordlight that slammed into the rock.

That strike was strong enough to cut a hole through an entire planet, but when the light faded, the rocks weren’t even scratched. Everyone stared at the undamaged rocks with slack jaws.
