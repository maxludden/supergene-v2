    <p>
      There was no use turning back now, and Han Sen opted to push on and find
      out what was going on. The super creatures they had encountered all seemed
      to ignore them, as if something greater attracted them. If he came to a
      place where they all had gathered together, he resolved to go around them
      and simply continue on his way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, with Zhou Yumei in tow, continued walking in the same direction.
      The fairy was still inside the scallop shell, refusing to come out.
      Whether or not she could by now was still up in the air, as her entire
      body was rotting. In a few more days, she&#8217;d most likely be melted
      into a bloody goop entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      But unless it wanted to exit the shell, there was nothing Han Sen could
      do. The shell was unbreakable, and if the fairy wanted to come out, he
      assumed it would have to be of her own volition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The weather was surprisingly volatile in the desert. It often became
      windy, spurring the sands high into the sky and obscuring their vision.
      During the extremely windy periods, the sands rose like monsters seeking
      to consume them wholly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen told Golden Roarer to maximize its size, and it looked like a
      little hill marching through the fierce sandstorms. Han Sen and the rest
      of his companions would then burrow into the Golden Roarer&#8217;s fur to
      remain comfy and unaffected.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame that Golden Roarer is only a super creature from
      the First Shelter. If it could evolve, it would most likely be greater
      than any other Second Shelter super creature.&#8221; Han Sen sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sandstorms left almost as quickly as they came. After half a day, they
      all stopped. But it was the lasting effects that were the most
      troublesome. Following the sandstorms, the landscape morphed. The
      rhino&#8217;s footprints disappeared and the dunes changed their
      positions.
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen heard a clapping noise, and he turned around to see Zhou Yumei
      slapping her cheeks. He laughed and said, &#8220;Why are you hitting
      yourself?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is a mosquito.&#8221; Zhou Yumei continued to wave her hands
      around, all to no avail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took a look and saw a small mosquito flying around her. It was
      pretty quick and surprisingly agile. No matter how much she tried to hit
      it, the mosquito perfectly evaded every attack.
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>Han Sen clapped his hands and killed the mosquito in one hit.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Mutant Creature Bloodlust Mosquito Killed. No Beast Soul Gained.
        Eat The Flesh Of The Mutant Creature Bloodlust Mosquito To Gain Zero To
        Ten Geno Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen was incredibly surprised, having not suspected the small mosquito
      to be a mutant creature.
    </p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>
      A few more mosquitos showed up, which Han Sen promptly killed. After that,
      even more showed up. They flew around madly, producing an infuriating
      sound.
    </p>

    <p>Pat! Pat! Pat!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen attacks were quick as lightning, and he was killing mosquitos
      left, right, and center. There were ordinary class creatures this time, as
      well as many mutant class variants.
    </p>

    <p>
      After killing all of them, Han Sen noticed Zhou Yumei looked frozen. She
      was staring at something ahead of them with an agape jaw. Her face was
      distorted into one of fright, as if she had seen something most wretched.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221; Han Sen frowned.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mo-mo-mosquito&#8230;&#8221; Zhou Yumei raised her finger, pointing
      ahead of them. With a trembling voice, she called out what made her look
      so scared.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What? They&#8217;re just mosquitos. There is no need to be afraid,
      I can clap-kill them all.&#8221; Han Sen then turned to look in the
      direction she pointed towards and noticed a giant crack in the desert
      sands. From it, swarms of the mosquitos emerged like a geyser. In their
      countless numbers, they turned to face them. And like the very sandstorms
      they had weathered before, they inked the skies and blotted out the sun.
      It was if the clouds of mosquitoes had turned the day into night.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you waiting for? Run!&#8221; Han Sen shouted. He grabbed
      Zhou Yumei and carried her underneath his armpit, while running.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bloodlust Mosquitos conquered the skies like a sandstorm, and they
      even struck fear into the silver fox and Little Orange. Together, those
      two scrambled to get away.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it was just a small number of mosquitos, even at mutant class, there
      was nothing to be afraid of. But a countless horde such as that would be
      too much. Han Sen had the appropriate super armor to block the attacks,
      but Zhou Yumei would be killed in an instant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, he&#8217;d feel bad wearing super armor in front of her. So,
      like she did, he wore sacred-blood class armor instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there were large numbers of sacred-blood class mosquitos, he was afraid
      they&#8217;d be enough to kill the silver fox and Little Orange, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t long before the mosquitos caught up and descended upon
      them, however. The silver lightning crackled across the silver fox&#8217;s
      fur, and he emitted a number of bolts to zap those that sought to
      overwhelm him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used his Flaming Rex Spike to incinerate the mosquitos around
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Little Orange&#8217;s body was jumping up and down to kill many, but a
      fair number of the mosquitos had already latched onto it. Without
      reprieve, the hungry insects drank deep of its blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was well and truly shocked. He didn&#8217;t expect the mosquitos
      to be able to drink the blood of a super creature, and that meant Little
      Orange and the silver fox were in as much danger as they were.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although only female mosquitoes could drink blood, their numbers were
      still scary enough to place them all in serious danger.
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen slapped a mosquito that was drinking Little Orange&#8217;s blood.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Sacred-Blood Bloodlust Mosquito Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Eat
        The Flesh Of The Sacred-Blood Creature Bloodlust Mosquito To Gain Zero
        To Ten Geno Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      &#8220;There really are sacred-blood class variants amongst them.&#8221;
      Han Sen&#8217;s face changed, and he commanded the little angel to clear a
      path for them. Then, he sped up to attempt an escape. But the mosquitos
      were like a sandstorm, and more and more were coming to engulf them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was doing better than all of them, however. The electricity
      on his body worked like a shield, and it prevented the mosquitos from
      landing on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for the others, they were slowly being swarmed by the fiends. Numerous
      mosquitoes were starting to land on them, especially Zhou Yumei. Although
      she was plated in armor, the sections of skin that were still showing were
      ripe for a biting. Her blood kept on being sucked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mosquitos weren&#8217;t deadly on their own, and even if they sucked
      until their bellies were full, it wasn&#8217;t much blood to lose. But
      with this number of them bearing down, things were dire. Within seconds,
      Zhou Yumei&#8217;s body was host to a large number of lumps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sucking her blood was fine, but the lumps were driving her insane. They
      were itchy, and each of her ten fingers went into overdrive, scratching as
      fiercely as she could. She was doing it so much, blood was being drawn to
      the surface. And as people say, the more you scratch, the itchier it gets.
      It wasn&#8217;t long before her skin was all frayed, and yet she
      couldn&#8217;t resist scratching.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tried his best to fight off the mosquitos, but his efforts seemed
      to be in vain. There were too many of them for him to handle. Even Little
      Orange&#8217;s body had been swarmed, and many mosquitos were helping
      themselves to a buffet of blood on its backside.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bodies of the super creatures were far better than Zhou Yumei&#8217;s,
      that much was plain to see. The itch didn&#8217;t seem to affect them at
      all, so the effects of the bloodsucking didn&#8217;t seem so concerning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox continued to fire electricity, but it was clearly a drain
      on his energy reserves. Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure how much longer it could
      last.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt really bad in his heart. He couldn&#8217;t find a way to give
      Zhou Yumei the immediate aid and respite she needed right now.
    </p>

    <p>If this was to continue, Zhou Yumei seemed likely to die out here.</p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen contemplated his next move, he suddenly saw a white fog
      approaching. When the mosquitos came into contact with it, they fell to
      the ground like hard rain.
