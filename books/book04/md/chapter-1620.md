  When Han Sen arrived at the martial hall and was preparing to sign up, he saw both Gu Qingcheng and Red Pony there. Apparently, they were both going to sign up for the Divinity’s Bout as well.

Han Sen was dazed. If all of them signed up in Shadow Shelter, the three would need to fight each other before Divinity’s Bout to determine which of them could enter Divinity’s Bout.

“You two are also signing up?” Han Sen wasn’t sure whether he could defeat Gu Qingcheng and Red Pony or not.

His geno core wasn’t at super level yet, and with only his physical power and beast souls, he wouldn’t be at a good advantage.

“You’re joining too?” Gu Qingcheng asked, looking at Han Sen.

“If you both are going to sign up, I won’t.” Han Sen raised his hand and exited the martial hall.

Han Sen certainly wouldn’t give up the battle, but he wouldn’t sign up in Shadow Shelter. He needed to find another shelter to sign up with.



Han Sen thought about it for a while, and he decided to go to the shelter of Ling Mei’er. After all, Ling Mei’er had already seen him in his super king spirit mode. Even if Han Sen went to the other shelters to compete, Ling Mei’er could still recognize him. He might as well just go to her shelter.

Fortunately, Ling Mei’er was very innocent, and she trusted Han Sen completely. There wouldn’t be that much of a problem.

Besides, with Han Sen’s current power, he wasn’t really afraid of having his identity exposed. However, with the existence of the organization God, he didn’t want to expose himself if he could avoid it.

Fortunately, Ling Mei’er didn’t have any plans to join the Divinity’s Bout, and no other creatures in that shelter intended to join either. Han Sen prepared to get the first place in the shelter right after he signed up.

It took more than a month for every shelter to determine their first place and the real Divinity’s Bout to begin. Han Sen planned to practice the Dongxuan Sutra so that he could improve his Bulwark Umbrella.

However, only a few days later, Han Sen heard from Ling Mei’er that a party from Sacred shelter had come to the Underworld, and they went to see the elder of the Dark Spirit race at Dark Spirit shelter.

“What are they doing here in the Underworld?” Han Sen asked, frowning.

He still had some unfinished businesses with Goddess. He had originally intended to go find Goddess after his geno cores reached super level, but he hadn’t expected a group from Sacred to come to the Underworld.

“I heard from the elder that they want to ask him to help them control God’s Ruin,” said Ling Mei’er.

“They’re asking the elder to attack God’s Ruin? I thought you guys from Dark Spirit can’t leave the Underworld because of the Hundred Tribe Deal?” asked Han Sen.

“You can leave here, of course, but if you die outside, you won’t be protected by the Hundred Tribe Deal. Besides, our elder is a great being, so he can go wherever he wants. As long as he doesn’t go to the territories of other races to slaughter their creatures, the other races won’t say anything,” said Ling Mei’er.

“Where is God’s Ruin now? Why are they asking the elder of your Dark Spirit race to help them?” asked Han Sen.

“The elder said that God’s Ruin is always dark, so even the great beings at emperor level can’t see in there. However, those of the Dark Spirit race have an absolute advantage, which is why they’re asking our elder to help them. However, the elder has already rejected them,” said Ling Mei’er.

After hearing what Ling Mei’er said, Han Sen’s interest piqued. After sharing some pleasantries with Ling Mei’er, he left the shelter.

The elder of Dark Spirit rejected the Sacred group’s request, and now that those from Sacred had left the underground shelter, Han Sen went to catch up with them.

He wasn’t sure whether Goddess was amongst them or not. If Goddess was still there, he could revenge himself for what she did to him before.

Right after Han Sen left the underground shelter, he entered super king spirit mode and started to chase after the molecules left by all the creatures from Sacred.

However, he didn’t detect any of the molecular remains of Goddess, and after he caught up with them, he didn’t see Goddess.

Han Sen was a bit hesitant. Goddess was his only foe; he didn’t hold any grudges against the other creatures from Sacred, so he didn’t want to kill them.



Just when he was about to leave, he heard a statue-like creature leading the group say, “The Dark Spirit elder doesn’t want to help us. I think we need to turn to Night Empress.”

Han Sen stopped when he heard of the name of Night Empress, eavesdropping on what they were saying.

Night Empress was the mother of Lotus Empress, and when Han Sen had summoned her in the Third God’s Sanctuary, she had helped Han Sen a lot.

The thing was, Han Sen always got along with Lotus Empress very well, and when Han Sen was summoned to the Fourth Sanctuary, Lotus Empress had already become a demigod, so he didn’t have a chance to meet her again.

He didn’t know where Lotus Empress was. Though they were both in the Fourth Sanctuary, it was an enormous place. It was too difficult to find her.

Another creature that looked like a western dragon said, “Night Empress has already rejected us. It might be useless to go to her again.”

“Hmph. If she refuses again, we’ll attack her shelter and her spirit stone. That God’s Ruin is very important to Sacred, and we have to have it,” said the statue-like creature coldly.

“What if Night Empress would rather destroy her own spirit stone than help us?” asked the giant dragon.

“No need to worry. She has a daughter she loves, right? She might be willing to die, but I don’t think she’d abandon her daughter,” the god-like creature said with a sneer.

“Let’s hope so. It would be best if she’s smart enough to agree to help us, so that we don’t need to do anything dirty,” said the giant dragon.

Han Sen then frowned. He gave up going back, and he kept following the creatures from Sacred shelter.

It was likely that the daughter they were talking about was Lotus Empress. Even if it wasn’t, he needed to help Night Empress for the sake of Lotus Empress.

Han Sen followed those creatures from Sacred all the way to the west. He had to admit that Sacred was indeed powerful.

All the creatures and spirits respected them, and nobody dared to disturb them. They didn’t meet any obstacles, and even the masters of super shelters venerated them.

“No wonder it’s one of the top-tier shelters in the Fourth Sanctuary.” Han Sen sneered inside.

They had been going straight the whole time without taking any detours. After only four days, the group from Sacred arrived at a shelter.

Han Sen saw a flag with the word “Night” hanging from the shelter. It was the same as the Night flag he had seen before, so it should be the shelter of Night Empress.

Han Sen hesitated for a while, but he was still following the creatures from Sacred. He didn’t have time to tell Night Empress what was going to happen. Besides, he only knew Night Empress and Lotus Empress, so some random creature in the shelter wouldn’t just believe everything he said. It would take him some time to meet Night Empress, and he didn’t have enough time now.
