Amongst the human demigods, and even the creature and spirit demigods, the Falsified-Sky Sutra was an infamous technique. And furthermore, it was always associated with Godslayer Luo.

Of course, alongside Godslayer Luo, the entire Luo family possessed and practiced the Falsified-Sky Sutra, as well. It was just that none others of the family were as frightening with the skill as he was.

If Godslayer Luo was taken out of the picture, the Falsified-Sky Sutra would not be as notorious as it was.

Now Jade Shura had just popped out of nowhere, wielding enough Falsified-Sky power to break Fire Empress’ geno core; it would have been believed to be the work of Godslayer Luo, had it not been a woman.

Fire Empress looked glum. Her geno core had been destroyed, and she herself had ended up injured. Seeing the Falsified- Sky power wielded with such dexterity, she no longer wanted to fight Jade Shura. She simply exited the battleground.

Jade Shura left Divinity’s Bout after winning, too, but many people fervently discussed what they saw. Even the spirits and creatures chattered amongst themselves about it, all wondering who it might have been.

It was primarily just the humans who knew about the shura, though. Most others didn’t, and so they didn’t know that only the shura Empress had the name Jade Shura. Nothing ultimately came from their discussions.

Han Sen was positive that this contender was from the Jade Shura family, he just wasn’t sure if it was the queen herself.

Han Sen observed the matching index in order to determine whether or not he could win the next six fights. It looked likely he’d go up against Jade Shura in the seventh match.

But Jade Shura had to win six times, as well.

“This is good. I would like to see how strong Jade Shura’s power has become, in case Little Yan winds up at a disadvantage against them,” Han Sen thought to himself.

If Han Sen wanted to battle Jade Shura, he had to win the next six times.

Over the course of the next two days, Han Sen observed many elites. There were far too many creatures competing, and nothing was as exciting as the fight between Jade Shura and Fire Empress.

Finally, on the third day, Han Sen noticed it was almost time for his first fight. He became a super king spirit, and then walked into Divinity’s Bout from the Martial Hall.

There were many creatures in the stadium, all focused on the battleground before them. Without a doubt, they were already paying attention to the place where Dollar and Six Paths would compete.

Many creatures were in the Martial Halls of their shelters watching, as well, via the tablets there.

“Dollar! It really is Dollar!” When the humans saw a shadow enter, they all screamed.

“It is Dollar! He really has come!”

“This will be a good show. I hope Dollar can beat Six Paths.”

“He very well might. Dollar killed Destroyer Wolf, so he’s not weak.”

“It’s the same Dollar as the one that killed Destroyer Wolf? I don’t think it’ll be easy for Six Paths to win this one.”

“What are you talking about? No matter who the opponent is, Six Paths is invincible in combat.”

“I think Six Paths will win, too. After all, he was an elite in second place long ago. He self-destructed so he could begin his practice all over again and become an emperor that way. He must be even stronger than before.”

As everyone discussed these matters, another figure appeared on the battleground.

He was wearing green clothes with a black piece of wood in his hands. He was approaching quietly and slowly, as people’s vision and focus narrowed in on him.

It was like he was carrying the spotlight, and the crowd couldn’t tear their eyes away from him. People watched him more closely than they did celebrities.

Han Sen watched the man walk slowly toward him, and he knew it was Six Paths. But Six Paths did not know who his opponent was.

Six Paths had seen Han Sen’s true self, but he had never seen him in super king spirit mode. He was unable to recognize him.

Six Paths stopped ten meters away from Han Sen and spoke. “You are strong.”

After Six Paths said this, the humans felt very happy. For a human to have been approved and complimented by a top-tier demigod was something of a glory.

The spirits and creatures that knew about Six Paths were all in shock. They knew of Six Paths’ personality.

When people complimented their opponent, it wasn’t usually truthful. But Six Paths spoke the truth, and that spoke volumes for how extremely strong he knew his opponent to be.

“Thanks for the compliment,” Han Sen calmly said. He didn’t look away from Six Paths for a second.

Han Sen knew a lot about Six Paths, and he had even learned his skills. But while Heart Sword was easy to learn, Han Sen had not had any practice with the other five techniques.

When Six Paths entered the battleground, Heart Sword was already active. Han Sen was not affected by this, and that was what prompted the initial compliment.

Han Sen’s swordmind was very strong, and he wasn’t bothered by Six Paths’ Heart Sword. This also made Six Paths think he had been presumptuous.

Six Paths shook his head and did not say anything else. He lifted his sword and came striking at Han Sen.

There was no more dialogue or gesturing, and his attack was something that shocked quite a lot of people. Normal people wouldn’t understand, though, thinking that it looked like any other strike. It seemed like a simple swing, something even a novice could do.

But that simple strike was different under Six Paths’ control. There was nothing tricky, and there wasn’t much raw power, either, but that was because it focused on the swordmind.

Heart Sword was dependent on the heart. Six Paths’ Sky Sword Path used the power of the sky, so when he struck, he combined it with the power of the earth.

People assumed it was an ordinary strike, but in the eyes of the elites, it looked like a tremendous force that could crush Han Sen in an instant

The sky and the ground lent power to the sword, and the attack was impossible to dodge. The strike was using the origin sword skill at max capacity.

Han Sen had the name Skysword, but he knew it was Six Paths with the genuine Sky Sword. He was just a guy who was talented with the sword, but nothing like a proper Sky Sword.

Outer Sky leader saw this and complimented it, saying, “Six Paths Emperor has become scarier than ever. It is difficult to tell who will win.”

The Sacred leader from Sacred Shelter saw it and frowned. “Six Paths Emperor really is a legend.”
