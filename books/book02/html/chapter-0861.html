    <p>
      The Crystallizer civilization lessons he had received in the past were
      mostly the same, but this time, Han Sen noticed they were going into a lot
      more depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the training was over, Han Sen went to a restaurant with Fat Squad
      Leader and his teammates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although they weren&#8217;t in the same camp, they had to work hard in the
      sanctuary. Furthermore, their working locations were not the same and so,
      they did not meet up frequently. Gathering together in one spot was a
      rarity, so they were keen to take advantage of the opportunity and have a
      meal together.
    </p>

    <p>
      They spoke about the many trials and tribulations they had each
      experienced in their lives up to that point. Fat Squad Leader recalled a
      tale in which he almost died while in the sanctuary. It was a story
      fraught with danger and arduous troubles, but he was a remarkable
      storyteller. He told the tale with humor and enthusiasm, which had
      everyone else leaning in to listen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Han, you have seen more than we, I am sure. Could you tell
      us a story concerning one of your adventurers?&#8221; Fat Squad Leader
      asked, and his request was joined by nods and noises of agreement from the
      others there, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Fat Squad Leader had been drinking, so Han Sen told them much
      about what he had been through. He received a barrage of questions as he
      told the stories.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to embellish the tales he told, but he realized his
      adventures were as fantastical and as wild as a story could get. He
      started to acknowledge how almost ridiculous his experiences were, that
      further flourishes weren&#8217;t even necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What a load of shit! A moving mountain, a tree that sunders the sky
      and bears fruit that craps out treasure? Where do you think you are, the
      Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary?&#8221; As Han Sen told his stories to the
      keen listeners, an inappropriate comment was made from someplace behind
      them. The voice was mocking.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen&#8217;s story was interrupted, the listeners all turned their
      heads to see who had the gall to do so. They were prohibited from wearing
      military uniforms outside the camp, so they wondered if the outspoken
      person only said as much because he didn&#8217;t know who they were.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, we were only exchanging tales. You interrupt us as if you
      have been offended.&#8221; Fat Squad Leader stood up and spoke to the
      person who had interrupted them, and noticed he was standing in the
      presence of others, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is a public area and there is a little thing called free
      speech. What? Are you guys allowed to spout whatever nonsense you want,
      whereas I must remain quiet?&#8221; the man said with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fat Squad Leader looked ready to respond, but Li Jin tugged at his arm. Li
      Jin had recognized who those people were, and so he told Fat Squad Leader,
      &#8220;Leader, they are from the Royal Warframe Team. I saw them while we
      were training.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Fat Squad Leader frowned and said, &#8220;If we are allied, then I can
      excuse your bullish intrusion. At the very least, I hope that you can be a
      touch more respectful going forward.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Fat Squad leader sat back down, but the man raised his eyebrows and
      retorted, &#8220;Oh, I apologize. But our Royal Warframe Team is not
      comprised of bullshitters.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      At this, Han Sen and Fat Squad Leader furrowed their brows. &#8220;Dude,
      you&#8217;re way over the line!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I apologize again. Did I touch a nerve? That&#8217;s fine;
      I&#8217;m sure that Hero Han can kill all manner of wretched creatures and
      surmount insurmountable challenges. Do not worry for my talent, as I am
      not a person that can move mountains and bring down the sky. I am merely a
      surpasser that has just reached the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Haha. I
      suppose he could fight me, if he figured he was strong enough.&#8221; The
      man was unbearably cocky.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen heard the man refer to him as Hero Han, he knew right away
      that the sole purpose for the man&#8217;s intrusion here was to cause
      trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you have no shame? You are a surpasser, who has come to
      challenge and pick on evolvers?&#8221; Fat Squad Leader was aggravated.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a mocking expression, the man said, &#8220;I may be a surpasser, but
      I can only suppose I am weaker than the monsters Hero Han described. If he
      can deal with those creatures, then I am sure he would have no problem
      competing against me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Fat Squad Leader and his friends were now riled up, but they
      couldn&#8217;t quite formulate an appropriate response to this. They too
      believed Han Sen was embellishing his tales, and exaggerating his stories
      for the sole purpose of entertainment. The Royal Warframe Team was mocking
      them, taking advantage of Han Sen&#8217;s jests. Unable to say anything,
      their efforts of provocation were proving effective.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay. Are we to have a friendly duel or commit to a warframe
      fight?&#8221; Han Sen asked, after standing up and moving right in front
      of the man.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen was not willing to accept their bullying.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had already taken the time to sense the surpasser&#8217;s energy
      flow, and he noted how he wasn&#8217;t that far off the average super
      creature. He was most certainly not someone special.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haha, are you serious? You are going to fight us, the Royal
      Warframe Team?&#8221; The man looked as if he had just heard the funniest
      joke ever devised, and he couldn&#8217;t help but burst into laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other team members joined in with the man&#8217;s amusement, and they
      all did their best to mock Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Royal Warframe Team was the greatest team in the Alliance. Only the
      most elite were able to join them, and they were people who were able to
      control warframes.
    </p>

    <p>
      To enter the Royal Warframe Team, a person had to undergo vigorous
      training. The Royal Warframe Team&#8217;s training regime was different
      than that of ordinary warframe teams. Furthermore, Han Sen was not a
      warframe soldier.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have heard of you Royal Warframe lot, and I have heard there are
      many warframe masters.&#8221; Han Sen spoke with a cold tone of voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hearing Han Sen say this, the man became awfully cocky. The Royal Warframe
      Team was indisputably the best of the best, and it was something they were
      proud of. They&#8217;d take advantage of any opportunity they could to
      trumpet their accomplishments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fat Squad Leader knew Han Sen wouldn&#8217;t compliment someone like this,
      willy nilly, so he waited patiently for what Han Sen was going to say
      next.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But I have also heard that the most powerful warframe users are
      female. The men are dragging the team down, apparently,&#8221; Han Sen
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fat Squad Leader and Qiu Cheng laughed heartily at the burn. Li Jin joined
      in with a serious tone of voice, adding, &#8220;Yes, I have heard about
      this, too. The Royal Warframe Team is frequently referred to as the Royal
      Princess Team. I thought the team was only comprised of women.
      You&#8217;ll have to accept my apology, for I did not know there were men
      amongst your ranks.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Li Jin&#8217;s words were not false, and what they said was
      partly true.
    </p>

    <p>
      The leader of the Royal Warframe Team was a woman, and most members were
      indeed female; like Yu Qianxun, who Han Sen had filmed advertisements
      with. Wang Mengmeng was a member of their team, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary reason for the Royal Warframe Team&#8217;s reputation as an
      elite army was due to their appearance. Being mostly comprised of women,
      that was not a difficult task.
    </p>

    <p>
      The team always showed up at the Alliance&#8217;s Independence Day
      celebrations, the New Year festivities, and the Marching Army events. They
      showed up to spruce up these occasions, and it helped that all of the
      smaller squads inside the Royal Warframe Team were spearheaded by women,
      too.
    </p>

    <p>
      With all of its authoritative figures being women, the Royal Warframe Team
      had been dubbed the Royal Princess Team. It wasn&#8217;t a snide name, and
      no contempt was harbored in its usage. The nickname really was just used
      to illustrate the many women in its ranks.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What did you say?&#8221; Now that Han Sen and Li Jin said this, the
      man&#8217;s face had changed. The other men accompanying him stood up
      angrily.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had been mocked for this state of affairs before, and hearing it used
      against them again was really quite triggering.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s have a warframe fight!&#8221; The men who had now
      been provoked looked at Han Sen with anger in their eyes.
