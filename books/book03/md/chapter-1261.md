As Han Sen relished the joy, Little Angel delivered the Life Geno Essence to him. He accepted it and then returned Little Angel and Disloyal Knight.

“Not bad; I got another beast soul!” Han Sen smiled as he told Qin Xuan.

Qin Xuan looked at him with confusion rather than delight. She thought it was a sacred-blood creature, but seeing the Life Geno Essence, it had struck her with a paralyzing shock that he had just killed a super creature with ease. It was unbelievable.

Humans could collect super geno points, but they’d still need to fight hard and struggle in the Second God’s Sanctuary if they sought to obtain them.

In the Third God’s Sanctuary, slaying a super creature was unheard of. Han Sen had just mopped the floor with one, though. It was then that she realized the mount she rode upon must have been a super creature, too, for it to initiate a battle with one so fearlessly.

When Qin Xuan finally managed to speak, she said, “Now I know how you were able to take down an emperor class shelter. You’ve blown the socks off people’s power expectations. You’re far better and stronger than anyone could have imagined!”

Han Sen smiled warmly in response, and said, “When you obtain more geno points, gene locks, and beast souls, the rest comes naturally. We’re all capable of such feats, I am sure!”

Qin Xuan shook her head and did not say anything more. She knew he was strong, but she almost felt as if she had been misled about the extent of the strength he had gained. It was bewildering how strong he truly was.

When Han Sen first came to the First God’s Sanctuary, he didn’t even know what a creature was. Qin Xuan was the person leading him. But now, Qin Xuan had been left behind in the dust. He was the person who walked too fast, and too far ahead.

Reflecting over the past, she couldn’t help but blush.

Han Sen said, “There are strong spirits on the heels, or fins rather, of the fish king. It would be best if we avoid them and not alert them to our presence.”

“Whatever you say,” Qin Xuan.

Han Sen headed for the peak via a different road. He had done so to ensure Yaksha would not see the two.

Along the way, Han Sen mowed down a few sacred-blood creatures on her behalf, so she could earn a handful of sacred geno points and get a headstart.

The lower tier geno points could always be filled up at a later date, and a few slayings later, there was already far more sacred-blood creature meat than she could eat in any reasonable amount of time.

As she watched Han Sen cut down such creatures in a flash, Qin Xuan couldn’t help but think, “This man is too powerful. If I ever seek to catch up, I’ll have my work cut out for me.”

Qin Xuan had managed to earn a lot of sacred geno points in a small amount of time. She had received some help in the Second God’s Sanctuary, but nothing compared to this sort of power-leveling.

Han Sen also gave her some mutant and sacred-blood beast souls, so she could chip in if she wanted to and tackle the weaker sorts by herself.

But seeing Han Sen kill so many high-level creatures with ease, when she triumphed over the lower variety, the feelings of success and accomplishment escaped her.

Han Sen refined the Abyssal Beast’s Life Geno Essence, and with Ice Wolf God’s Life Geno Essence, he had managed to reach a total of eighty-one super geno points.

Although he wasn’t full, his body was practically equal to a super creature in strength and might.

It was just a shame his Dongxuan Sutra could not keep up with Han Sen’s rapidly rising power. It was sluggish, by comparison.

Han Sen really admired Dongxuan Zi. It was difficult to practice the Dongxuan Sutra, and for Dongxuan Zi to practice it up until he broke through the vacuum, Han Sen figured he must have possessed the power of a monster.

Han Sen was proud of his talents, but he still thought he paled in comparison to Dongxuan Zi when he held himself up against the man.

Those who succeed always have help to become better, and Han Sen wanted to do the same.

There were no more super creatures on the way, so the opportunity for another would have to wait a little while longer.

After half a month of travel, they reached the mountain. There, they saw the big dragon-like waterfall.

Because Han Sen had taken a different path, the fish king had yet to arrive.

Han Sen did not want to get too close, so he took the opportunity to poke around and find a nice cave to hide inside.

When night fell, Han Sen donned his Night Cloak and left the safety of the cave.

He didn’t know if Yaksha had arrived yet, but after searching all night, he had yet to find hide nor hair of the spirits. But what Han Sen did find was a super creature residing inside the nearby lake. He didn’t even need his Dongxuan Aura to sense it.

“The fish king is not here, but does this mean other berserk super creatures want the vine, too?” Han Sen wondered.

Han Sen returned to the cave again, and there, he waited for the fish king and Yaksha to show up.

Two days later, after dark, a strange noise sounded from the lake. It sounded as if someone had opened a can of soda right next to his ear. Han Sen left Little Angel and Bao’er behind, with instructions to protect Qin Xuan. Wearing his Night Cloak, he snuck down to see what had occurred.
