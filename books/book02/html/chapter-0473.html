    <p>
      Oval parasite crystals threw themselves at Ji Yanran and Han Sen like
      bouncing balls in increasing numbers, making the couple cringe.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Run!&#8221; Without any hesitation, Han Sen took Ji Yanran&#8217;s
      hand to run toward the exit of the treasure. Although parasite crystals
      could be crushed, there were so many of them that even Han Sen could not
      fend them all off since they would grow on human body as long as they
      touched the skin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The couple rushed out of the treasure and ran for their life in the tunnel
      that was slightly taller than a person. Countless parasite crystals
      followed them like ocean waves and filled their sight. The pink crystals
      were incredibly fast as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dammit. Where do these parasite crystals come from? How come we did
      not see them when we entered the place?&#8221; Han Sen was slightly upset.
      They were right inside the core area of the Crystallizer royalty ruin,
      running recklessly. If they died here, they would not even know what
      killed them.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, looking at the endless parasite crystals following them, Han Sen
      knew they would die definitely if they did not run, so he did not dare to
      stop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, the snow-toothed wolf mounts was running ahead of them as their
      scout, which was more or less a comfort to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The snow-toothed wolf which was running in front was suddenly cut in half
      by a beam of light. It fell heavily on the floor and then disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Rubik&#8217;s cube!&#8221; Han Sen saw the 12 x 12 Rubik&#8217;s
      cube in the next intersection and became pale.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This way.&#8221; Ji Yanran ran into a side path first and Han Sen
      followed her.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, neither the parasite crystals nor the Rubik&#8217;s cube was
      retreating. Both of them followed the couple.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran and Han Sen ran around several corners and suddenly found
      themselves in a dead end. There was no way to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whatever.&#8221; Han Sen knew it was time to fight for his life. He
      drew his laser gun and shot at the incoming parasite crystals like crazy.
      Ji Yanran did exactly the same, shooting at the parasite crystals with her
      laser gun nonstop. However, the guns were not that useful. After breaking
      several parasite crystals, more started to go at them. There was simply no
      end to the crystals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Very soon, a large number of parasite crystals had come close to them and
      tried to attach to their bodies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth and threw a grenade before he covered Ji Yanran
      to hide in the corner. The grenade exploded in the tunnel, smashing lots
      of parasite crystals.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen was only using a in ordinary grenade. The crystal wall
      and floor quickly expanded under the impact like foam, filling up the
      entire tunnel and almost drowning Han Sen and Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221; Han Sen tried to move his body, but he was
      trapped in crystals that were still expanding because of the explosion,
      which made it hard for him to even turn around.
    </p>

    <p>
      The couple were trapped in a narrow space, so they had to stand hugging
      each other. There was no additional space at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; Ji Yanran answered in a soft voice, her
      cheek on Han Sen&#8217;s chest and her body pressed to his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen enjoyed making out with Ji Yanran, it was obviously more
      important to run for their lives. The entire tunnel was filled up by the
      expanding crystals, so there was no way to go out from the way they came
      from. The only possible exit would be the space behind the dead end, if
      there were any. As long as they could break this crystal wall, they would
      still have hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen no longer had any beast soul weapon he could use. He had
      to run Jadeskin and turn his hands into Jade, throwing punches at the
      crystal wall behind Ji Yanran&#8217;s back.
    </p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Under Han Sen&#8217;s fist, the wall only had a hairline crack.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have a sacred-blood dagger from Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Let
      me try.&#8221; Ji Yanran said and summoned her dagger, stabbing at the
      wall behind her backward.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Ji Yanran could hardly move her arm, so it was hard for her to
      put much force into the move. In addition, she had just become an evolver
      before long, so she did not have great fitness. After stabbing with her
      dagger a few times, she was only able to leave several shallow white marks
      on the crystal wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; Han Sen stopped Ji Yanran and punched at
      the crystal wall again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had achieved initial success in Yin Yang Blast. Using the
      technique of yin force, it was not hard for him to make a powerful punch
      in a short distance. With slight vibration, Han Sen&#8217;s fist punched
      at the crystal wall with loud bangs. After dozens of punches, the crystal
      finally cracked. Pieces of crystals started to fall from the crystal wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen followed up by punching hundreds of times, expanding the cracks.
      Eventually, the crystal wall was pierced by his fist.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know that God will not let me die here.&#8221; Han Sen was
      overjoyed. The crystal wall was only less than an inch thick.
    </p>

    <p>
      He accelerated in punching the wall and quickly expanded the opening to
      the size that one person could cross through.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Turn around slowly and crawl into the hole.&#8221; Han Sen glanced
      into the hole and saw a hall. There did not seem to be much stuff inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, if there was anything inside, it must have been alerted by
      the loud noises he was making.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran turned around slowly. However, looking at the hole, her eyes
      suddenly became red. She cried, &#8220;Han Sen…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      She sounded like she was crying. Tears filled up her eyes and she grabbed
      Han Sen&#8217;s hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crystal next to the hole was colored red by blood, which was
      astonishing to look at. And the back of Han Sen&#8217;s hands was
      completely broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Breaking the crystal wall with bare hands was something difficult for him
      even though he had practiced Jadeskin. In the end, her bones were almost
      broken. However, Han Sen gritted his teeth and pulled through without
      making a sound, which was why Ji Yanran only noticed his wound until this
      point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Holding Han Sen&#8217;s hand, Ji Yanran could not make a complete
      sentence. Her tears fell like rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No worries. It&#8217;s a small injury. My bones are good.
      Let&#8217;s go out first.&#8221; Han Sen smiled and urged Ji Yanran to
      crawl into the whole. Han Sen followed her inside and was astonished by
      what he saw.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hall was the size of a factory workshop. It was empty inside, but on
      the ceiling of the hall, red crystals were floating like red stars,
      blinking with red light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen recognized this type of crystal immediately, which was the
      simulating crystal.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      When the couple just stood up, all the simulating crystal started to flash
      red lights at them, as if there was a press conference in the hall.
      Shortly, red crystal humans that looked exactly like Han Sen or Ji Yanran
      fell from the ceiling and ran toward them.
