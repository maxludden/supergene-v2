  Han Sen was a part of the Rebate now. But he was a very prestigious individual in Sky Palace, and he could come and go as he pleased. He was treated like one of the people of Sky Palace, as if he shared a direct lineage with them.

Han Sen even had an island for himself in Sky Palace. It was the little jade island he used to occupy.

Little Silver and Little Star were registered to occupy the little jade island as well. Han Sen wanted to use his Blood-Pulse Sutra power on them to make their blood stronger. But his body had yet to recover, and so, he could no longer do it.

Little Silver tried to heal Han Sen’s damaged body using his healing powers, in all of their electrifying glory. His attempt did have a positive effect, but it was fairly minuscule.

Han Sen gave the Thunder God Spike to Little Silver. Little Silver and the Thunder God Spike’s power could benefit each other, so it would be good for his evolution.

He used Glasses to examine all the creatures around him. They all had a five-star potential. And in regards to their real potential, he would find that out once they became deified.

One day, Han Sen was on his island sunbathing. Bao’er was sitting nearby, still nibbling her purple ginseng. It wasn’t getting any smaller, despite her constant gnawing. Little Angel and Zero were preparing lunch. Han Meng’er was holding the Six Core Snake Bow, and she was practicing archery.

Little Silver and Little Star were lying on the ground quietly. There was a little beast that was like a white snowball scurrying around. Snowball was a creature from the sanctuaries. It was very special, as it could shield itself inside a white orb that couldn’t be broken.

Han Sen had brought the little creature to the geno universe back when he was on Planet Eclipse. Snowball had a good relationship with Xie Qing King, and it had spent most of its time in the universe following him about.

When Narrow Moon was first brought to Sky Palace, Snowball wasn’t there. It had been with Xie Qing King.

Han Sen was wondering why Xie Qing King had sent Snowball to him instead of just calling him on the phone. When Han Sen saw the item Snowball had come to deliver, he realized with shock that Xie Qing King’s Overbearing President Love Luv Looove had been made into a movie that was going to be on air soon.

Snowball’s delivery of a ticket of admission was a roundabout way of showing off.

Han Sen searched the internet of the universe and found that Xie Qing King’s Overbearing President Love Luv Looove was insanely popular. His title was Teacher Xie.

Han Sen tried to find out how many copies of Overbearing President Love Luv Looove had been sold so far, and there were many zeroes. There were at least a billion, Han Sen thought. “Good grief! How much did Xie Qing King earn?” Han Sen was frozen. No matter how much Han Sen fought or all the deified weapons he earned, he hadn’t made as much money as Xie Qing King and his drawings.

“Should I start drawing something, too?” Han Sen was interested in the concept, but he realized that his drawing abilities were more than lacking. So, he shelved the idea.

Sky Palace was going to be screening the movie, too. Han Sen brought Han Meng’er with him to watch it. It was just going to be them, so they could have the entire theater exclusively for themselves.

When they went to the theater, Han Sen encountered Yun Suyi, Yun Sushang, and Thousand Feather Crane. They were all King class now. They had progressed just as quickly as Han Sen.

In fact, Han Sen’s progress hadn’t been all that fast. He was slowed by his need to fulfill the requirements of four separate geno arts. If he only practiced one, and it wasn’t The Story of Genes, he would have likely been deified by now.

“Brother Han, are you alright?” Yun Suyi asked, looking at Han Sen.

They had wanted to visit the little jade island to see Han Sen a while ago, but Sky Palace forbade ordinary people from visiting there. So, this was the first time they had seen Han Sen in a long time.

Han Sen didn’t look so good. His body was all dry like a piece of smoked meat. It took Thousand Feather Crane a minute to recognize him.

“Much better. I’m almost okay. I was going to visit you guys a few days ago, but Elder Yun wouldn’t let me leave the little jade island until now,” Han Sen explained.

“We know. We were told the same thing, or we would have already visited you on the little jade island,” Thousand Feather Crane said.

“The movie is going to start. Let’s go in!” Yun Sushang said with a smile.

Han Sen bought the whole theater. There was a lot of space, so he invited them there to watch it all together.

Due to Han Sen already knowing what happened in the story, he wasn’t too caught up in the movie. He was surprised to see Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang like it as much as they did. They were very excited. They would laugh at times, and at other times weep and cry their eyes out.

In the end, the main character rescued a female character. When they kissed, Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were so touched, their eyes almost turned into the shape of little hearts.

“It doesn’t matter how strong a woman might be; they all have the same heart.” Han Sen couldn’t help but sigh.

After the movie finished, Han Sen invited the three of them to have dinner. They talked comfortably together as they headed back.

“How come I never hear about Lone Bamboo anymore?” Han Sen asked Thousand Feather Crane. He had asked other people about Lone Bamboo, but they were all so dodgy about the subject that he never really received an answer.

Thousand Feather Crane hesitated, but Yun Suyi said angrily, “It is because of that Exquisite!”

“Exquisite?” Han Sen was shocked. He knew the name, but he didn’t think Exquisite would have anything to do with Lone Bamboo.

“Suyi, stop talking.” Thousand Feather Crane frowned.

“Is this something I’m not allowed to know about?” Han Sen asked, glancing at Thousand Feather Crane.

Thousand Feather Crane shook his head and said, “Not exactly, but this incident cannot be helped. Even if you know, there is nothing you can do.”

“If it isn’t taboo, then why don’t you just tell me?” Han Sen said.

Thousand Feather Crane still hesitated. Yun Suyi had practically told Han Sen the whole story, anyway.There was a good connection between Sky Palace and the Very High. People often believed Sky Palace was the mouthpiece for the Very High. Although Sky Palace wasn’t one of the three highest races, the Extreme King were quite scared of Sky Palace, as well.

In fact, Sky Palace depended on the power of the Very High. So, Exquisite and the other Very High came to Sky Palace. They asked Lone Bamboo and Yu Shanxin to join the Very High, and it was a request that Sky Palace couldn’t refuse.

Yu Shanxin agreed, whereas Lone Bamboo refused Exquisite’s offer.

This created some tension and a widening rift between Sky Palace and the Very High. The Very High didn’t relent in their request, though. And Lone Bamboo didn’t waver or give in to their demands. So, the leader of Sky Palace locked Lone Bamboo up.

“Couldn’t Lone Bamboo refuse to join the Very High?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Thousand Feather Crane shook his head with a wry smile. “The relationship between Sky Palace and the Very High is very complicated. It seems as if there was some sort of agreement in place. Our leader is in hot water right now. He cannot refuse the demands of the Very High.”

“If Lone Bamboo is locked up, does that mean that they’ve dropped their demand?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Thousand Feather Crane chuckled and said, “Were it so easy. The Very High haven’t said anything. They haven’t yet said whether or not Lone Bamboo has to go. If they haven’t canceled their request, we have to respond somehow. We cannot sweep this matter under the rug.”
