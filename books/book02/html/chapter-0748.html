    <p>
      Without a choice in the matter, Han Sen quickly brought Zhou Yumei back to
      the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the little angel could distract the maniacal fairy, the creature
      would not allow them a single break or moment&#8217;s rest if they
      attempted the trip while it was after them. And this was a trip that would
      require stops, so they couldn&#8217;t continue with the fairy on their
      heels. And Han Sen was responsible for the life of Zhou Yumei right now,
      as well. So, he had to share concern for her, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, Han Sen decided to return to the shelter and formulate a plan
      for how they might kill the fairy, or at the very least lose its pursuit.
      If they couldn&#8217;t figure that out, they&#8217;d never be able to
      leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few days, Han Sen had come up with a number of ways he might be
      able to fight the fairy. But if he could not kill her, he could not lose
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Does that thing really want to fight to the death with me?&#8221;
      Han Sen thought it was an awkward predicament.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the fairy did not dare to enter the shelter. As such, he
      planned to stay in the shelter for an even longer amount of time and see
      whether or not she would leave. No matter how much she despised Han Sen,
      she couldn&#8217;t remain watching this place forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was nothing to do while staying in the shelter, however, so Han Sen
      returned to the Alliance and researched the sheet of leather and its
      scripture. He wanted to find whatever information he could on Blood-Pulse
      in the army.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had seen the Blood Legion&#8217;s Blood-Pulse before, and it was
      little more than a religious doctrine that spoke of lore and mythology. He
      had never heard of them teaching skills before. The Blood-Pulse he had in
      his possession now was completely different.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is all this about, huh?&#8221; Han Sen mulled the questions he
      had for a while, but eventually decided to ask Qin Xuan. He wanted to ask
      whether or not there was a person called Qin Huaizhen in the seventh team
      of the Secret Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen called her up, after some time of deliberation and hesitation. He
      said, &#8220;Team Qin, I remember you once told me you had an elder in the
      Secret Service.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, what about it?&#8221; Qin Xuan looked a little confused when
      Han Sen asked her this.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have recently heard of this man called Qin Huaizhen. Is that
      him?&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan nodded and said, &#8220;There was a person called Qin Huaizhen in
      our family; so who did you hear it from? And why would someone mention his
      name?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was on my way to the Blue Crystal shelter, when I happened to
      meet an old man on the road. He said he was a friend of Qin Huaizhen, one
      who used to travel around with him in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. He
      mentioned that his last contact with Qin Huaizhen was on a trip he took to
      the Black Desert. He never heard from him again, so it&#8217;s possible
      that he died there. I just thought I should mention this to you,
      that&#8217;s all,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan laughed in response, saying, &#8220;You must have been told a
      tall tale! There was an elder of ours called Qin Huaizhen, but he was a
      member of the Secret Service&#8217;s seventh team. He must have been
      amongst the very first people to ever set foot in this world. He died
      shortly after returning. How could he have died in that world? And how
      could it have been the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary? Back then, they had
      only just discovered the existence of god sanctuaries. When he was alive,
      they didn&#8217;t even know about the difference in tiers between
      sanctuaries.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen froze for a moment, having not thought of this issue before. When
      Han Jingzhi first entered, it was shortly after the discovery of the
      sanctuaries. Even he would not have known about the tiers that separated
      them. Even if they did know, they couldn&#8217;t have been there long, and
      they most certainly couldn&#8217;t have been in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary already.
    </p>

    <p>
      After returning from the sanctuaries, people died one-by-one. They
      didn&#8217;t return to the sanctuaries, so there was no way they could die
      there. And they especially couldn&#8217;t return to the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this only added to Han Sen&#8217;s confusion. &#8220;If that person
      was not Qin Huaizhen, who was he? Why would he possess Qin
      Huaizhen&#8217;s working license?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hm, I must have been fooled then. I apologize.&#8221; Han Sen
      coughed afterwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Where are you now, anyway?&#8221; Qin Xuan smiled and did not press
      the issue further.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m still in the Black Desert.&#8221; Han Sen did not dare to
      say he found the body of that man. If it really wasn&#8217;t Qin Huaizhen,
      telling her would only confuse her.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he ended the conversation with Qin Xuan, Han Sen found himself
      trapped in a perplexing quandary. Identifying that person seemed hard, and
      trying to learn what may have transpired there seemed even more difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was not a truth-seeking person. If there was a puzzle that was
      proving too difficult to solve, he&#8217;d rather shelve the issue than
      continue confusing himself with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not plan to learn Blood-Pulse. After all, his Dongxuan Sutra
      was one of the best Qi Gongs. He didn&#8217;t want to waste time teaching
      himself a new one that wouldn&#8217;t produce further benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was researching the Blood-Pulse to see if there was anything
      particularly special about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after his time reading, Han Sen began to pick up on the fact that
      Blood-Pulse had a greater depth to it than Jadeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen had only unlocked one, Jadeskin had nine tiers he could
      unlock in total.
    </p>

    <p>His Dongxuan Sutra had ten tiers.</p>

    <p>
      Blood-Pulse also had ten tiers of possible unlocks, which placed it on the
      same level as the Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through Han Sen&#8217;s research, he came across the knowledge of a
      function of Blood-Pulse he thought to be particularly remarkable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Practicing Blood-Pulse could extend your powers with it. The powers you
      earned could also be genetic, and their traits and benefits could be
      passed down to your children when they were born.
    </p>

    <p>
      To put it more scientifically, after practicing Blood-Pulse, it would be
      written down in your genetic code. The generation that followed the
      learner would be granted the powers when they were born.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a scary thought. Technology had come so far, it had allowed humans
      to modify certain genes and cure genetic afflictions that carried across
      generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      But passing skills to children via their genes was supposedly impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Human genes were affected after a few generations or dozens of
      generations; it was something that humans referred to as evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      This manner of evolution was rather slow, but the results were easier to
      see following the discovery of the god sanctuaries. Every new generation
      of the sanctuaries' inhabitants naturally possessed a greater fitness
      level.
    </p>

    <p>
      The increases weren&#8217;t massive, however. And noticeable differences
      only arose after a few generations. But for the learning of Blood-Pulse to
      become a natural, genetic gift to your children was quite a shocking
      aspect.
    </p>

    <p>
      A power like this was scarier than simple gene modification. Heirs of such
      a talent could be considered cheaters, even. For those who inherited the
      skill, it would undoubtedly prove to be a big leg-up right from the moment
      they were born.
    </p>

    <p>It was like being a few generations ahead of your peers.</p>
