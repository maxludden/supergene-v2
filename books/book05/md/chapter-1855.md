  The three of them sped up. They chased after Captain Wood’s group for a dozen miles, before coming across a body crumpled on the floor. It looked as if the person had died a long time ago, but strangely, the clothing the body wore belonged to one of the Barons that had previously accompanied them.

And there wasn’t just one such body. A little further on, they found more Baron corpses. The manner in which they died seemed to reflect what had occurred to Wind Viscount. Their heads had been blown open, leaving a gaping hole.

“Weird. Didn’t they have the lotus roots? Didn’t they erase the markings? That should have at least lasted them a good while.” Gu Qingcheng frowned.

“It looks like the lotus root might be useless, after all.” Han Sen pointed to the ground. There were some remains of the lotus on the ground.

And near the shreds of lotus, there was another Baron corpse. The man was holding half of a lotus root, indicating he had been eating it when he died. Halfway through his consumption of the plant, part of his head had exploded.

You are telling me that those lotus roots are actually useless?” Xie Qing King’s face changed.

“Maybe they’re useless, but we don’t know for sure yet. These guys are dead, but you guys are alive. It doesn’t look like this matter is all that simple. Hmm, we need to catch up with them. I hope I am wrong, of course. If I’m not, things will have taken a swift turn for the worse.” Han Sen sped up on his travel, and every now and again, they would catch sight of a Baron that was dead and clutching a lotus.

Little Silver suddenly came to a stop. The egg mark on his forehead turned into a black bird. Little Silver seemed upset by the change, and he kept on scratching the point.

“My head feels weird, too.” Xie Qing King grasped his forehead.

Han Sen looked at Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng. The egg markings on their foreheads had turned into birds.

“You guys should eat some of the lotus and stay back here. Don’t follow me any further.” Han Sen grabbed a lotus and passed one to Little Silver.

Little Silver gobbled it up, and he was struck with that chilling sensation. Afterward, the bird on his forehead grew fainter.

“You guys should take more of the lotus and stay away from here. I’ll go on ahead and take a look.” After that, Han Sen summoned his Teeth Rabbit shoes and ran forward quickly.

He traveled a dozen miles in a single moment. On his way, he saw the bodies of many more Barons, and even one Marquise. The latter was one of Captain Wood’s guards.

Han Sen kept going forward until he came before a palace. There, he saw something that gave him a shock.

In front of that palace, the big black egg was hovering in mid-air. It was burning with golden fire. Below the egg, three Marquise and Captain Wood himself were also ablaze with golden fire. They looked ready to become charcoal.

Captain Wood was doing okay. His body was surrounded by blue light, and he was managing to hold off the flames. The three Marquise, on the other hand, were truly on fire.

Black Steel had fallen across the stairs. The Dragon Back Knife was hovering over his head, as the shadow of a dragon covered him to protect him. It was holding the gold fire at bay.

Bzzt!

Ghost Teeth Knife leaped out from Han Sen’s backpack, its blade pointed at the egg. It emitted a purple mist, like the egg was a grand foe. The gold flames of the egg were approaching like a meteor. Ghost Teeth Knife cut them in half.

But the golden flames that were cut in half continued their approach.

Han Sen dodged them, then grabbed Ghost Teeth Knife.

Ghost Teeth Knife could only attack. It wasn’t much for defense, so Han Sen could not use it to block. It was a far cry from the Dragon Back Knife, which was currently focused on protecting Black Steel.

“What’s going on?” Han Sen asked, as he evaded more fire.

He was wearing his Teeth Rabbit shoes, so he was blisteringly quick. The fire was unable to burn him.

When Captain Wood saw Han Sen, who had not died or been permanently wounded from his time in that hall, he was incredibly shocked. He couldn’t dwell much on the matter, given the current circumstances, however. So, he just said, “Kill the Raven blood and do not let it get free. Otherwise, we are all dead!”

Black Steel then yelled to Han Sen, “The egg absorbed Skygod’s fireseed! The power of its fire is cruel and strong; you should run!”

Wood Duke was screaming. Eventually, he proved unable to hold back the fire, and his skin began to sear and sizzle.

Han Sen wasn’t keen on the prospect of saving Captain Wood, but Little Silver and the others had the mark. If he didn’t destroy the egg right here, they’d all end up like Captain Wood.

Han Sen’s Teeth Rabbit shoes were incredibly fast, and with a swift move, he was able to dodge two flames. Holding Ghost Teeth Knife, he swept forward to strike the giant egg wreathed in golden fire.

Han Sen’s power wasn’t sufficient to activate Ghost Teeth Knife’s true strength, but right now, the knife was feeling threatened. It summoned power by its own volition, power of proportions that exceeded the capabilities of a Duke.

It was like the egg was a living creature. It cast a number of gold flames towards Han Sen, which came down on him like rain.

Han Sen’s body was like a bird in the sky. He evaded a dozen fires and slashed the egg.

Dong!

The purple mist and the golden flames were both extinguished. But the egg did not get damaged.

Ghost Teeth Knife’s full strength did not affect it. This realization made Han Sen frown.

More attacks were coming at Han Sen now, too. So, Han Sen used his Teeth Rabbit shoes to fly. He evaded all the fire and employed his knifemind. He looked like a monster as he swooped down at the eggshell, slashing.

Katcha!

Some marks were left on the egg, but it had yet to crack.

Han Sen was too weak, and he could only push his power to reach the capabilities of a Viscount. If he had the power of a King, alongside that Ghost Teeth Knife, he could undoubtedly break the egg in two.

Han Sen kept moving his body, as he tried to dodge the golden flames. He was going to hit the giant egg again.

When he hit the egg this time, however, there was no noise. It was like the knife found itself suddenly sticking to the egg. But when he did this, the egg itself showed a reaction, and it bounced itself away.

Han Sen was delighted by this, as he had just used Yin Yang Blast. The power he used from the Ghost Teeth Knife seemed to work.

The egg backed away like it was scared. But it still carried its golden fire. It dodged Han Sen’s knife, not wanting to get hit again.

It was just an egg, though, and it couldn’t move very fast. Han Sen, on the other hand, soared through the sky like a phoenix. Again, he slashed the giant egg.

The egg jumped like a cat getting its tail stepped on.
