	<p>As he left Night Charm Town, Han Sen got to thinking about the exam.</p>

	<p>The exam gauged the power of the royal children. Some of the tests would judge the royal children’s leadership
		potential and their collective power when placed in groups. Their guards were allowed to join them.</p>

	<p>But other tests focused on the individual power of the royal children. Only the royal children could participate
		in those.</p>

	<p>One of the activities, for example, involved hiking up Bone Mountain and reaching its peak.</p>

	<p>Bone Mountain was one of the three famous mountains in King’s Kingdom. It wasn’t as dangerous as Extreme
		Mountain, but that didn’t mean reaching its peak would be easy. Its slopes were quite treacherous.</p>

	<p>Hiking up Bone Mountain was a trial that showcased power, courage, and endurance.</p>

	<p>The mountain was commonly called Rot Bone Mountain. The environment was highly toxic, and when people were too
		stubborn to abandon their attempts to climb the mountain, the toxicity would corrode them until their bodies
		were gone. Only their proud skulls were left behind.</p>

	<p>Han Sen hadn’t been to Rot Bone Mountain before, so he wasn’t sure what sort of power he would have to contend
		with. He knew that it could destroy courage and endurance, and make proud creatures lower their heads.</p>

	<p>But Bai Ling Shuang mentioned that if royal children possessed the Kingese Ao or Ju, they were sure to have a
		higher chance of reaching the peak.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had received loads of Kingese protection, including Ao and Ju. The chance of him reaching the top of Rot
		Bone Mountain was high, so Bai Ling Shuang was willing to pay a high price for his help.</p>

	<p>Bai Ling Shuang wanted to go to Rot Bone Mountain’s peak, not for King Bai’s compliments, but for the benefits
		Rot Bone Mountain could provide. Those rewards could only be claimed by reaching the summit of that place.</p>

	<p>In regards to the exact nature of what she hoped to gain, Bai Ling Shuang didn’t elaborate, and Han Sen didn’t
		ask.</p>

	<p>“What is atop Rot Bone Mountain’s peak?” As Han Sen wondered about this, his phone started to ring.</p>

	<p>He looked at the number calling him and noticed that it was listed as “unknown.” He had disguised himself as Bai
		Yi, but he had kept his old phone number. He had been careful not to contact anyone on Planet Eclipse, though,
		in case the Extreme King screened the calls and picked up on something.</p>

	<p>Now, suddenly, a strange number was calling him, which was confusing. He hesitated, but he still answered the
		call. He was curious.</p>

	<p>A beautiful woman with long, black hair appeared on his screen. Her face looked divine, and her emerald eyes were
		captivating. Her boobs were small, but everything else was great.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at the woman in the video. She wasn’t the most beautiful woman he’d seen, but he would rate her at
		a fine nine-out-of-ten. Still, he didn’t remember ever seeing her before.</p>

	<p>“You are?” Han Sen looked at the woman, and he noticed her reserved expression. The longer he looked at her, the
		more familiar she seemed. He just couldn’t remember where they might have met.</p>

	<p>“I am Ning Yue. Can you talk?” The woman’s voice was very clear, but her words shocked Han Sen. His eyes opened
		wide, and his mouth gaped.</p>

	<p>Han Sen hadn’t been able to place his sense of familiarity with the woman. Hearing the name Ning Yue, however,
		made him feel like he’d been tased. Now he knew where that familiar feeling came from.</p>

	<p>Aside from having a female body, the woman appeared and behaved just like Ning Yue. If not for the emerald eyes
		that had captured his gaze, Han Sen probably would have guessed who it was eventually.</p>

	<p>Even so, Han Sen was still left speechless.</p>

	<p>“Hang on, I’ll call you back.” Han Sen ended the call and went to his computer. He logged in and called the
		number back.</p>

	<p>The call rang through, and the image of that beautiful woman appeared on Han Sen’s computer.</p>

	<p>“What is it?” Han Sen held his laughter at bay. He didn’t think anyone could disguise themselves as Ning Yue.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue was a very special person, so masquerading as him would be difficult. But even if someone went to the
		trouble to steal another person’s identity, why would they choose Ning Yue? He wasn’t famous or important in the
		geno universe, so what was the point?</p>

	<p>Not to mention that, even if there was something benefit to be gained, no one could make a woman disguise
		themselves as Ning Yue. This was too much.</p>

	<p>Seeing Han Sen attempting to hold back his laughter, Ning Yue’s eyes twitched. In an emotionless tone, he began
		to explain what had happened.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue had been captured by the Hell, and he was forced into slavery in a secret Hell xenogeneic space. During
		his incarceration, a strange woman appeared out of a black rock. She killed all of the Hell and the slaves
		without discrimination.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue had gotten his hands on a little green sword during the chaos, and he used it to kill Hell King and the
		woman from the rock. After killing them, Ning Yue discovered that Hell King and the woman were both deified
		elites, not half-deified as he had assumed. This shocked Ning Yue. He didn’t understand how the little green
		sword had wielded so much power.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue only had the power of a Marquise. Even if he held a deified weapon, he shouldn’t have been able to kill
		a deified xenogeneic. But the little green sword had decapitated two deified xenogeneics with ease.</p>

	<p>They had been injured, of course, so that was worth considering. But the little green sword’s power was still
		mind-boggling.</p>

	<p>“You say you used the green sword to kill two deified xenogeneics?” Han Sen stared at Ning Yue, unable to believe
		his ears.</p>

	<p>Even if Han Sen used the Thunder God Spike, he couldn’t damage deified xenogeneics. Ning Yue was just a Marquise.
		The feat he had achieved with the little green sword was a bit unbelievable.</p>

	<p>“Yes. And I received a deified beast soul,” Ning Yue pulled the little green sword out.</p>

	<p>“That’s a deified beast soul? You won big!” After Han Sen’s shock subsided, he examined Ning Yue’s little sword.
		The blade was two fingers wide. It was an intriguing shade of dark green, but other than the color, nothing
		about the sword seemed very special. There were no engravings on the blade, and it didn’t even have a scabbard
		to go with it.</p>

	<p>“I would rather not have earned it,” Ning Yue said grimly. He flipped the green sword over to reveal its other
		side to Han Sen. There was a green mark on it, as if some liquid had stained its surface.</p>

	<p>“What is that?” Han Sen asked.</p>

	<p>“I don’t know. It won’t go away.” Ning Yue paused and then went on to say, “After I killed the two deifieds,
		their bodies became liquid, then disappeared. Nothing remained. Not even a xenogeneic gene.”</p>

	<p>When Han Sen heard this, he furrowed his brows, and his expression turned suddenly serious.</p>

	<p>With deified xenogeneics, their entire bodies were their xenogeneic genes. Melting one shouldn’t have been
		possible. It had to be related to the green sword.</p>

	<p>“I left the xenogeneic space. The first time I went to sleep, I woke up looking like this.” Ning Yue sighed.</p>

	<p>“You, uh… Did you lose…” Han Sen didn’t know what to do.</p>

	<p>“No, my manhood is still here. But some parts of me look woman-like.” A muscle in Ning Yue’s cheek spasmed.</p>
