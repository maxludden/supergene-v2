  Han Sen was shocked. He looked at his hand. It had a purple light shining on it. A small, purple flower revealed itself.

“It is the Otherside Flower.” Han Sen looked at the little purple flower. It had 13 petals. There were no more and no less. This was the small, purple flower Han Sen had seen before.

As Han Sen wondered why the Otherside Flower was appearing on his hand, he saw one of the thirteen petals fall off. It floated onto Wan’er’s forehead. It was like a spring sun that was melting the snow. It slowly melted into her forehead.

A moment later, the petal melted. Wan’er’s forehead was covered with a purple, misty light.

As this occurred, the Otherside Flower that was on Han Sen’s hand vanished. It was like it had melted into his hand.

Han Sen’s heart was rattled. He looked at the purple, misty light covering Qin Wan’er. Her eyes moved a little. It looked as if she was going to wake up.

When the purple, misty light grew dimmer, Qin Wan’er’s blonde hair turned black. She suddenly became the black-haired Wan’er Han Sen used to know.

“Huh?” Qin Wan’er opened her eyes, which were black. They were clear and full of life. They were like black gems without any dirt.

“Big Brother!” Qin Wan’er looked at Han Sen. She looked to be in shock. She sat up and opened her arms to jump at Han Sen.

Han Sen was confused. Wan’er previously mistook him for a big brother because Qin Xiu’s black crystal armor was inside his Sea of Soul.

Now, the black crystal armor was gone. Why would Wan’er still be calling him her big brother?

Patong!

Wan’er was unable to touch Han Sen’s body. Her hands went right through him. She fell on the floor.

“Big Brother, what happened to you?” Qin Wan’er dragged herself off the floor. She tried to grab Han Sen’s body many times, but she was unable to. Every time she tried, her grasp went right through him.

“It looks like Qin Wan’er is similar to Bao’er. They can see me, but they cannot touch me.” Han Sen sighed. He looked at Qin Wan’er and asked, “You know that I am not your big brother, right?”

Qin Wan’er was shocked by his words. She nodded, but then shook her head. “I know you are not Brother Qin Xiu, but I still think you are already my big brother.”

Han Sen’s heart felt warm. He wanted to touch Qin Wan’er’s hair, but his hands kept going through her.

“I can accept you as my little sister.” Han Sen withdrew his hand and presented a warm smile.

“Great, but what is wrong with you, Big Brother?” Qin Wan’er still wanted to reach her hands out and touch Han Sen, but she was unable to feel any part of him.

“It’s nothing. My body has a small problem. That’s all. Everything will be fine soon.” Han Sen did not want to say too much about it. He casually asked, “Do you know where Qin Xiu went?”

Qin Wan’er shook her head. “I remember Qin Xiu brought me here, and then I fell asleep. After I opened my eyes, I saw you.”

“It was worth keeping you with me for so long.” Han Sen felt better after hearing all of that. When Qin Wan’er referred to Qin Xiu, she referred to him by his name, Qin Xiu. Whenever she referred to Han Sen, she referred to him as a big brother. It made them sound closer.

Han Sen looked at Qin Wan’er. It was unknown what was happening to her. It was unknown how many memories she had.

Han Sen watched her look at him. Qin Wan’er seemed to understand something. She lowered her head and said, “I am Wan’er of the Witch. I am the Wan’er from the Qin Kingdom. Will that make you hate me?”

“Why would I hate you? For as long as you think of me as a big brother, I will be your big brother forever.” Han Sen fondly looked at Wan’er. He patted his chest to double-down on certifying his words.

Han Sen knew this all looked and sounded a bit childish, but he preferred to be childish than being blown to bits. He did not want to think too much about this matter.

“Big Brother!” Wan’er was very happy. She reached out her hands to keep trying to grab Han Sen’s neck, but she was unable to grab anything.

“You should rest here. If there is a chance for me to take you back, I will.” Han Sen was not exactly safe where he was. Even if Wan’er could go along with him, he knew he shouldn’t take her away right now. This was probably the safest place for her to be for now.

“OK.” Wan’er politely nodded.

Han Sen waved his hands. He bid farewell to Wan’er and departed the old tower.

Since Qin Xiu was not there, there was no reason for Han Sen to stay in the tower. He wanted to see if he could travel through the 33 skies and reach the geno universe.

If Wan’er was able to see him, perhaps Ling’er and Littleflower would be able to see him too. He really wanted to go and see his son and daughter.

From ancient times, no one had ever been as strong as Han Sen or able to travel through the 33 skies. Even God Spirits with a spirit body required a god temple and geno hall power to reach the geno universe.

The 33 skies was a really odd place. It had many incredible and mysterious places. Even Han Sen was surprised by what he saw there. Fortunately, his spirit body did not have to touch a single speck of dust. No form of power was able to repel or keep him down. If that wasn’t the case, even if he was in peak physical condition, Han Sen thought he would not have been able to make his way through the 33 skies.

Some of the creatures that lived in the 33 skies gave Han Sen goosebumps.

In one sky, Han Sen saw a type of ant. The ants were small like ordinary ants. They had wings and flew so fast.

A group of these ants became like a black storm. Even if a Break World gene race tried to run away from them, if they weren’t careful, they’d be devoured in a short amount of time. Not even a single bone would have remained.

The life form of the flying ants was very weird. Although they were individual entities, in a group, they shared the same presence. The more flying ants there were, the more powerful they were.

In another sky, Han Sen saw a giant vine that went through the ground. The giant vine had many gene races and Break World-class existences occupying it. Those gene races were not very scary, but the big vine was extremely terrifying. Even with the Break World race gene races that lived on the stalk, the big vine was shockingly powerful.

It was very a powerful existence. There were many such things in the 33 skies. The higher Han Sen went, the scarier and weirder the creatures became.

“Weird. Outer Sky is above the 33 skies. How can the 33 skies have so many scary gene races, yet there are none in Outer Sky?” It made Han Sen wonder if Outer Sky really was above the 33 skies.

“The 33 skies are quite scary. Not even Qin Xiu is able to punch through them in a short amount of time. Now, I know a lot more about the 33 skies. If I can recover my true body, perhaps I will be able to beat Qin Xiu and become better than him.” Han Sen did not want the 33 skies to break. That would be very bad for the geno universe.

Compared to the creatures in the universe of kingdoms, the creatures of the geno universe were like flowers in a greenhouse. They were trapped in the greenhouse to grow, unable to experience storms. There were not many Break World elites there.

“This is the last sky.” Han Sen looked into the sky. A spirit light was flying up. Han Sen entered the last layer of the 33 skies.
