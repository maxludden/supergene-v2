<h2>A Rare Opportunity</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1842</h3>

<p>Eighty percent of Planet Eclipse was covered by clouds. The
magnetic storms were constantly unstable, and they were always
shining with volatile power. Tools were almost useless in those
conditions, and satellites in orbit never wor^^ because they could
not see what lay beneath those clouds.</p>
<p>That was one of the reasons Han Sen made the decision to come
here. While it was hard for him to watch other Nobles and track
their movements, it was also hard for others to watch him.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not mind his inability to keep close watch over
the Nobles, as he had never planned on keeping tabs on them
anyway.</p>
<p>Not long before Han Sen left the base, one of the Viscounts
decided to follow him. The Viscount’s name was Lake, and he was of
the fairly small Inkcloud race. That race did not even have its own
planet, and they were just a faction of creatures scattered across
a number of different planets. It was extremely rare for them to
have a Viscount.</p>
<p>But there was more to Lake than it seemed. When he became a
Viscount, he was treated very well, and he received a lot of
special training.</p>
<p>Lake came to Planet Eclipse with the sole purpose of
assassinating Han Sen. Assassination in Narrow Moon was difficult,
but Planet Eclipse would be his best chance.</p>
<p>Han Sen was only just a Baron, but still, Lake patiently
followed after him. When he attacked, he needed to kill Han Sen in
a single strike. He didn’t want to slip-up and give Han Sen the
chance to resist or draw his King class weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not use all the power of the weapon, but its
presence in combat would still be annoying.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought Little Silver with him on his excursion into the
mountains. The creatures around there were far too messed up, and
he couldn’t be sure that the maps the Barons had drawn for him were
entirely accurate.</p>
<p>Far away, Han Sen caught a glimpse of a few creatures near the
mountain. They were the xenogeneics the Barons had described.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, Han Sen noticed that there were six of
them. There were big ones and small ones. Some were as big as an
elephant, whereas others were as small as a dog.</p>
<p>The bodies of the xenogeneics were all different as well. Some
had four legs, whereas others stood up on two legs. Some were like
creepy bugs with wings, while others had six arms.</p>
<p>Despite their variety, they all shared one physical attribute:
there was a shell upon all their backs. The shells didn’t look too
sturdy.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the Barons tell him that when their weapons hit
the shells, they did not deal much damage. And that was why the
Barons’ attack on the creatures had completely failed.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched them for a while. He pulled his Ghost Teeth
Knife from his backpack. The scabbard he had was broken, so he
carried the knife drawn.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife possessed Ghost Teeth powers. Normal scabbards
could not house it, and they’d usually break after a few days. Han
Sen was fairly annoyed by that aspect of the blade.</p>
<p>He did have that spare scabbard he could use, but he didn’t dare
to. If Yisha saw it, the jig would be up. Han Sen had hidden that
scabbard in the sanctuary instead.</p>
<p>When Lake saw the mountain Han Sen was heading for, he frowned.
There was nowhere to hide there, and if he followed Han Sen up
there in plain sight, his presence would surely be discovered.</p>
<p>Han Sen had brought a silver beast. Lake thought Han Sen was
being very arrogant, thinking he could take on six xenogeneics
under those bare conditions.</p>
<p>But Lake could also use this opportunity to gauge the true
extent of Han Sen’s power.</p>
<p>The strike Han Sen used to kill the Baron had drawn its strength
from the weapon he used. It wasn’t an effective measure of his true
strength.</p>
<p>“It’s fine with me if you want to get yourself killed by
xenogeneics, so I don’t have to do it. If you don’t die, though,
I’ll help you along.” Lake looked calm. He was taking his time, as
there wasn’t any particular rush.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s presence was soon discovered by the xenogeneics up
ahead. The six xenogeneics perked to a state of alertness and
roared. They looked murderous, and they all ran straight for Han
Sen like a pack of wolves.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved straight towards them with an unfaltering speed,
knife raised and ready to strike. Little Silver was coming right
behind him.</p>
<p>Quickly, Han Sen closed the distance to his first xenogeneic
target. He swiped right past the beast, with his knife swinging as
he went.</p>
<p>He did not stop moving. He swung Ghost Teeth Knife from all
manners of different angles.</p>
<p>Within a second, Han Sen had made his way past all six of the
xenogeneics. They had all attacked in a different manner, but none
had managed to land a single hit on Han Sen.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Cracks formed in the six xenogeneic bodies, then widened as they
began to seep blood. All of the beasts fell down, squealing and
bleeding. Their lives would soon be over.</p>
<p>Lake, seeing what had just occurred, was shocked into horror. He
thought to himself, “Powerful Teeth Knife! Powerful Ghost Teeth
Knife! That power must stem entirely from his knife. Aside from the
Rebate, I didn’t think any other race could learn Teeth
powers.”</p>
<p>Lake was happy that he hadn’t blindly tried to attack Han Sen
without seeing this first. Han Sen was a far stronger foe than Lake
had initially believed him to be. He had Ghost Teeth Knife, which
meant a face-to-face battle would be very difficult.</p>
<p>Not long after, the six xenogeneics were all dead. Han Sen dug
out the xenogeneic materials. Even if he didn’t need them, the
people back in the sanctuary could still use them.</p>
<p>“These xenogeneics are weaker than I thought. I should think
about hunting down Viscount xenogeneics sometime. Otherwise, I
won’t be able to improve at all.” Han Sen put away the xenogeneic
genes and looked over his maps.</p>
<p>He looked for the locations where Viscount xenogeneics had been
discovered. There were quite a few of them.</p>
<p>Han Sen selected a spot in which he could leave the mountain. He
followed a path on the left because someone had spotted a Viscount
xenogeneic that way. So, he was planning on going that way.</p>
<p>Lake, seeing Han Sen go that way, felt happy. Lake had made the
report of a Viscount there.</p>
<p>There were actually Viscounts there, but there were two. He had
only reported the presence of one. He was going to report it again
to encourage Han Sen to go hunting, but Han Sen was arrogant enough
to head there immediately with the hopes of fighting one.</p>
<p>“An opportunity. This is a rare opportunity.” Lake was so happy,
and he quickly followed after Han Sen.</p>
<p>Lake had made his mind up now. He was going to kill Han Sen,
even if the two Viscount xenogeneics couldn’t kill him on Lake’s
behalf.</p>
<p>“I just need to hide in one of Han Sen’s escape routes. When he
tries to run from the xenogeneics, he won’t escape my
assassination. He is a dead man.” When they got close to the place
the Viscount was said to reside, Lake hid himself on one of the
paths.</p>
