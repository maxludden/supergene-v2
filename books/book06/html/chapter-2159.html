<h3>Chapter 2159</h3>

<p>All the races that sent Marquise teams to Metal World were
growing worried. Their elites had been waiting outside the planet,
but after half a month went by, not a single Marquise had returned.
They sent a few more Marquises to find out what might have
transpired there, but none of them came back either. All of the
elders were growing angry at the threat to their people.</p>
<p>The first scouts that they sent to Metal World had gone in and
then come back out without issue, but now, not a single Marquise
seemed able to return. It confused them a great deal.</p>
<p>They were very disturbed. Although one hundred Marquises was
nothing to those higher races, they were fighting for territory.
They had sent out their best elites of Marquise rank. Having their
fighters trapped inside dealt a lot of damage to those races.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast told Han Sen how he could leave Metal
World. The storm that plagued Metal World cycled between blue and
red, and most of the time, leaving was impossible. Every tenth swap
of color, however, there would be a brief pause in the storm. It
was only during that time that the planet could be escaped.</p>
<p>When the Demons and the Buddhas first traveled there, it was
during that small window. That was how they were able to enter and
leave.</p>
<p>Now, they needed to wait for ten red and blue storms to pass
before trying to leave the surface. In total, that would be a month
and a half. There was still a while until the window opened again,
so Han Sen wasn’t in a rush to move just yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen was enjoying the benefits of being friends with Metal
Eater, and he was able to consume the metal xenogeneic fluid each
and every day. He actually didn’t want to leave the cave for the
time being. He wanted to drink as much as he could so he could
level up The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to search for Yuya and the others. They were
staying with the remainder of the Dragon, Buddha, and Demon. They
were surviving under the protection of a secluded cave. They
weren’t really in any danger, but their supplies were swiftly
dwindling. Thus, they were becoming desperate to find a way out.
Unfortunately for them, they’d yet done so.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t meet with them, though. He stayed close to the
white Metal Beast and kept drinking its metal xenogeneic fluid. As
he waited for the tenth cycle of the storms, he spent most of his
time practicing The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>For some reason, the white Metal Beast had no interest in
leaving the metal city. Han Sen couldn’t lure or take it away from
there, either.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept refining the metal xenogeneic fluid, and after a
whole month, The Story of Genes finally began to change.</p>
<p>It was becoming Marquise.</p>
<p>“Is it finally happening?” Han Sen was excited. He had used so
many resources to level it up, and he had always wondered what new
powers he might achieve upon leveling it up to Marquise.</p>
<p>“I wonder if it will develop a new shape. Of course, if the
power doesn’t increase proportionately, then this geno art wouldn’t
be very well-balanced. The resources consumed thus far would be a
waste, and I’m not even sure if there would be any point carrying
on with its practice.” The Spell armor began to glow with holy
light. Spell was now shining as brightly as a sun.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body shook, and then the armor disappeared. It took on
the shape of a lady standing directly in front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>The lady was covered in a holy light, and her hair waved like
sunbeams. The two pistols Spell wielded became bright, too. They
gave off so much light that Han Sen couldn’t look directly at
them.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body felt like a fast-flowing waterfall was rushing
through it. His body connected with Spell’s energy and began
glowing extremely strongly.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Finally, Spell’s light started to explode like a volcano, and a
holy light fired into the sky. Spell’s body floated in the midst of
that holy geyser of light, and a strange Spell symbol appeared on
her forehead.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what changes the flower-like Spell was
experiencing. She was shining, but not very brightly. But she was
inside the stream of light, and the shadow of her form was clearly
visible.</p>
<p>The holy light focused on her forehead, and it gathered up the
powers of Spell. All of that light was beaming down into Spell’s
flower. The flower had not changed, and Spell looked just like she
always did.</p>
<p>“Spell’s battle body has increased to Marquise class.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard this announcement in his head. His body had also
gotten a whole bunch stronger.</p>
<p>His physical form now made him invincible amongst all the other
Marquises. Even a top-class Dragon Marquise wouldn’t have a body
that was remotely comparable to Han Sen’s.</p>
<p>What confused Han Sen was that Spell did not gain a new form;
her forehead was just imbued with a strange Spell symbol. He had no
idea what the symbol even meant.</p>
<p>Yuya, Kahn, and the others all looked glum. They had been
looking for a way to leave Metal World for the longest time, but
their efforts had all failed. They were on the verge of running out
of supplies. It was usually safe when they left the cave during a
blue storm, but this time, they met a few metal dragonflies. They
killed the insects, but more appeared and chased them back to their
camp.</p>
<p>They relied on the constricted entrance of the cave to fight off
their enemies, and at first, it worked. But there were some Dukes
among their attackers, and as a result, they were unable to hold
the enemy off.</p>
<p>“Damn! We are losing men! Should we retreat?” A dragonfly sank
its teeth into a Buddha, and a whole chunk of his arm’s flesh was
torn out. He let out a blood-curdling scream.</p>
<p>“All of our resources are here. If we lose those, we won’t
survive long no matter what we do. Plus, there are too many
xenogeneics for us to risk splitting up. That would just get us all
killed,” Yunyi coldly said.</p>
<p>“If we don’t run now, we will surely die here!” the Buddha
Marquise shouted back. “There are too many xenogeneics in the blue
storm this time. And there are Dukes amongst them. We cannot fend
them off forever.”</p>
<p>Dragon Eight and Yuya remained silent as the others argued. At
this stage, there could be no falling back. They would settle for
either getting out of Metal World or dying.</p>
<p>The group kept killing what they could, but some Marquises fled
the cave. They wanted to take their chances outside the cave.</p>
<p>But the dragonflies, upon spotting the deserters, came from
everywhere. There was nowhere they could run that the dragonflies
wouldn’t follow. They would have to fight until exhaustion claimed
them, and when that happened, their bodies would be devoured.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight roared, and the rest of his Dragon followed him to
abandon their camp. When he saw what was outside, however, he felt
hopeless. Not even his gold dragon body could keep up this fight
forever.</p>
<p>Yuya brought the Sky Palace students out with him, too. All
those dragonflies swarmed them, and they had nowhere to flee.</p>
<p>As despair came to claim their hearts, something weird appeared
inside the swarm of xenogeneics.</p>
