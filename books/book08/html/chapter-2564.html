<h3>Chapter 2564</h3>

<p>Li Keer and Exquisite were feeling something beyond shock; as
they watched Dollar make kill after kill, they were growing numb.
They couldn’t wrap their heads around how Dollar was doing
this.</p>
<p>He had used the Very High’s teleportation ability to beat a
member of the Very High. Even Exquisite, whose face was forever
cold and expressionless, looked shocked.</p>
<p>In fact, when they encountered the last two crocodiles,
Exquisite had given up trying to steal the kills from Han Sen. She
resorted to paying attention to how Han Sen moved. She wanted to
learn how he moved faster than her.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Exquisite confirmed that Han Sen’s God’s Wander
really was a beginner variant. It should have been slower than
hers, yet for some reason, it didn’t look slow.</p>
<p>The fact that he seemed to be using the skill in an ordinary
manner made Exquisite feel rather strange. A while later, Exquisite
finally unearthed the truth.</p>
<p>“This planet’s gravity doesn’t seem to affect him.” Han Sen’s
teleportation ability wasn’t actually faster than hers, but it was
unhindered by the gravity that hampered her. Han Sen used the
ability at the same speed that he would anywhere else in the
universe.</p>
<p>Exquisite’s theory was correct. Han Sen used the Dongxuan Area
to stop the universal cogwheels of gravity. The planet’s gravity
wheel no longer affected him, but Exquisite was still under its
thumb. That resulted in her becoming slower than him.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Sutra was similar to the Very High Sense, but they
had been developed in different directions. As a result, the Very
High Sense lacked this ability.</p>
<p>“Power that can ignore the effects of gravity? That is very
interesting.” Exquisite nodded. There were geno arts like that in
the Very High, but she hadn’t chosen to practice them. So, she
wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>“It looks like this place isn’t giving him a reason to display
his true power. I need to wait until the Crocodile God shows up.”
Exquisite hadn’t expected this to be an ideal place for Han Sen to
demonstrate his true power, anyway. She hadn’t come here to watch
Han Sen slay some demon crocodiles. She wanted him to square off
against the Crocodile God.</p>
<p>King class xenogeneics weren’t easy to find, and the three of
them only located a dozen demon crocodiles.</p>
<p>Because of the planet’s gravity and scary temperature, King
class fighters that couldn’t teleport would be in a lot of danger
if they came there to fight Chain Demon Crocodiles. And if it had
been an easier place to hunt, there wouldn’t have been many Chain
Demon Crocodiles for Han Sen to slay.</p>
<p>After Han Sen killed seven demon crocodiles, another half-day of
travel failed to bring them any more xenogeneics.</p>
<p>“It looks like the demon crocodiles are getting wiped out by our
efforts. Are there any other places with Kings?” Han Sen asked,
still wanting more.</p>
<p>“Since we’re already here, let’s walk around the planet just in
case we’ve overlooked something,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>Han Sen readily agreed to that. It was rare to find King
xenogeneics, so he needed to ensure he killed all the creatures
they were able to find.</p>
<p>The three of them continued to scour the planet, and after a
short while of walking, they discovered another demon crocodile.
This time, however, Han Sen didn’t immediately strike.</p>
<p>After all, Li Keer and Exquisite had brought him there. He would
feel bad if he took every single kill. So, he decided to leave one
for them to take out.</p>
<p>Exquisite seemed to look on Han Sen’s generosity with contempt.
When Li Keer noticed Han Sen not moving, however, she knew exactly
what he was thinking. She teleported forward and slew the Chain
Demon Crocodile.</p>
<p>Li Keer was weaker than Exquisite, but killing fourth-tier Chain
Demon Crocodiles was a trivial task.</p>
<p>After killing the crocodile, they saw some movement out in front
of them. It looked like a bubble of lava rising to the surface of
the planet, as if something was about to emerge from down
below.</p>
<p>“More demon crocodiles?” Han Sen asked, glancing in that
direction. Then, he saw a demon crocodile appear.</p>
<p>But this demon crocodile looked different from the other demon
crocodiles. It looked similar to the others, but this demon
crocodile seemed smaller than usual. It was the size of an ordinary
crocodile, and it didn’t have any wings.</p>
<p>Ordinary demon crocodiles had red, metallic bodies. This one,
however, was pitch black. If its body hadn’t been releasing a
strange glow of some sort, it would have looked just like a normal
crocodile at a passing glance.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the demon crocodile with narrowed eyes, and a
wave of tension rolled through his body. He only felt this way when
he was in danger.</p>
<p>As Han Sen observed the small demon crocodile, he remembered the
behavior of the bronze furnace. He was able to guess what this
creature was.</p>
<p>“I thought it was the gravity and heat that frightened the
bronze furnace. I guess there really is a deified xenogeneic here,
huh?” Han Sen wasn’t terribly shocked about this. On the contrary,
he was rather happy. Another chance to kill a deified xenogeneic
was the best thing he could hope for. Han Sen was close to becoming
deified himself, so he needed to collect as many deified xenogeneic
genes as he could.</p>
<p>If he became deified, he wouldn’t be able to enter the core
area. So he had to kill as many core deifieds as possible while he
still could.</p>
<p>“Careful. This looks like a deified demon crocodile,” Li Keer
warned them.</p>
<p>Exquisite didn’t say anything in response. She had detected the
Crocodile God’s presence a long time ago; the Very High Sense was
better than the Dongxuan Sutra in this regard.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Sutra could only sense what was in the area. The
Very High Sense was about the sky and practitioner becoming one.
When Exquisite stood on the planet, she could see everything on
that planet clearly. She didn’t have to use an area to discover
what was around her.</p>
<p>And she was only using the Very High Sense at a very low level.
If she reached the top level possible, she would be able to see and
detect anything across the whole universe.</p>
<p>Of course, that was just a theory on what a perfect version of
the Very High Sense could do. No one in the Very High had ever
become that proficient with it.</p>
<p>The Very High Sense focused on one’s senses. The sense-detecting
ability was greater than the Dongxuan Sutra’s, but its ability of
control was weaker than the Dongxuan Sutra. They both had their
pros and cons.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the Crocodile God. The crocodile’s eyes looked
like the eyes of a lion as it stared at them.</p>
<p>It might have just been the shape of the crocodile’s face, but
the creature seemed to be staring at Han Sen and his companions
with scorn. It also looked as if it didn’t care for their presence.
That was especially true of its very small eyes. Its gaze was
snobby and patronizing.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was about to move, the Crocodile God released a black
light. That light was like a black hole that encompassed the entire
planet.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body felt as if it was sinking. There was a loud
noise, and he fell. He hit the planet’s surface with his limbs
outstretched.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t the only one who had slammed into the ground in
an undignified manner. Li Keer and Exquisite fell, too. They
crumpled to the ground in very awkward postures. They no longer
looked like elegant women.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast all his powers to try and stand up, but it felt as
if the strength of his abilities was being sucked away by a strong
magnet. He was unable to get back to his feet. He couldn’t even
lift his head off the ground.</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite were in a similar situation. They were
unable to move.</p>
<p>The three of them were stretched spread-eagle on the ground, and
they all watched the small crocodile come over to them.</p>
