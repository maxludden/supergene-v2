	<p>“That is very good. Yes, just like that. Let me see the true potential of your body.” Crape Myrtle watched the
		changes manifesting across Han Sen’s body. His eyes flickered with a weird light. One could only hear his voice
		come through as mumbles.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s muscles were tightening, and so was his skin. He wanted to escape the pinning restrictions of the 28
		lights with his strength.</p>

	<p>“You were right in saying that my body is unable to feel the rules and order. It is like a stone that is so hard
		it is also useless.” Han Sen kept saying things like this while struggling because he had exhausted so much
		strength. The places the light pinned him were not producing grooves in his body. It was like invisible pins
		were going to pierce through his skin at any given moment.</p>

	<p>“What does that have to do with anything?” Han Sen asked while he continued to struggle. “Even if you cannot feel
		the rules and order, my body still exists. Earlier, you said everything is complete and separate from everything
		else. One ant. One lion. One stone. Each thing is a complete, small universe unto itself.”</p>

	<p>“Yeah, but so what? Just spit it out, man! What on earth are you trying to say?” Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen
		with great interest.</p>

	<p>“Even so, my body will still have a universe of its own on the inside,” Han Sen said. “Because this universe is
		in chaos mode, we cannot understand it. At least, I myself cannot understand it.” His right arm, which had been
		exerting force moved a little. Blood started to seep from the limb.</p>

	<p>He was using too much strength. The skin of the arm that had been pinned by the light had been torn. Blood came
		out from it.</p>

	<p>“Do you mean that your body is like the chaos mode from before the universe exploded?” Crape Myrtle asked after
		taking more than a moment to think about it.</p>

	<p>“Yes, that is precisely what I mean. You are correct.” When Han Sen spoke, the skin broke where the 28 lights had
		him pinned. He was bleeding.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not care about the wounds he had incurred. He still used strength and tried to escape the light, but
		this movement only made his wounds bigger. Blood came out like drops of water.</p>

	<p>“You are a very daring person to think this way. You treat your body like the universe before it exploded. This
		makes it seem like you might have infinite possibilities.” Crape Myrtle slightly pursed his lips, smiled, and
		said, “But there is one thing you have wrong. I said every creature can use their body as a little universe, but
		this little universe, compared to the real universe, is very small and very simple. It is more like a prototype.
		The body still needs to keep evolving to make the beginning of this universe more complete. Do that, and it can
		be strong like the universe. If, in accordance with what you said is true, your body is a chaotic universe
		before it exploded, it means you are the lowest-tier creature of the pyramid. You are more behind than any other
		creature.”</p>

	<p>“You are right if that is how you want to view it. My body’s evolution is worse than any other creature in the
		universe…” Han Sen only spoke half of what he meant to when his right hand clenched into a fist. The light that
		pinned his hand went through his flesh and bones. It left a bloody hole inside him.</p>

	<p>“So, what? No one understands my body more than I do. Although it is very slow, I know I can feel it. It is not
		powerless. I can even say it is incredibly strong. I just don’t have the ability to break its binding and
		unleash its power. If I can take that step, I believe this body will become the strongest in the universe.”</p>

	<p>When Han Sen spoke, more blood oozed out as the light was ripped away. It went through his flesh and bones.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body leaned forward. The light was still where it was. It went through his body and skull. His eyebrows
		and his brain had bloody holes in them.</p>

	<p>His body was absolutely drenched in blood from top-to-bottom. Just the mere sight of him was revolting. All the
		people who were paying attention to the battle felt their skin crawl and itch, but it was a visual that was
		worth enduring. Han Sen managed to get rid of the restrictions that were nailing him down. He managed to shed
		the 28, cruel lights that had been doing their best to keep him immobile.</p>

	<p>The muscles in Han Sen’s body were extremely tense at this point. He looked like a burning fire that was raging
		brightly. He looked at Crape Myrtle and approached him. With each step, the blood holes in his body healed.
		Suddenly, he was back to normal. Not even a scar remained to indicate where he had been damaged.</p>

	<p>If his clothes were not stained in blood, no one would have believed what experience he had just been through.
	</p>

	<p>Crape Myrtle frowned. When Han Sen walked closer step by step, he thought, “Is his body really that tough? Not
		even the universe power that I enlightened can make his body breakthrough.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen said, “Crape Myrtle, I really appreciate the assistance. As a reward, please take my punch.” At the same
		time, he lifted his fist and threw a punch into Crape Myrtle’s belly.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was now certain that Crape Myrtle was Mister God from the geno hall. Aside from him, no one understood
		the universe that much.</p>

	<p>At this level, even Qin Xiu and Tai Yi were not as good as God Hall Leader.</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew Crape Myrtle wasn’t really there to fight him. Crape Myrtle had many chances to kick him out of the
		battleground, but he always seemed to elect to staying there and chatting</p>

	<p>Even the universe theory was something Crape Myrtle very obviously wanted to explain to Han Sen. He clearly
		wanted Han Sen to understand his current body type.</p>

	<p>Crape Myrtle had also told Han Sen his universe theory might not be correct. Han Sen still needed to determine
		what was up with his body through his own understanding.</p>

	<p>“Your body is still in a chaos mode. A guy such as you cannot get hurt now…” Crape Myrtle was not planning on
		dodging. His body was composed of bright spirit lights. It gave people the impression that he looked extremely
		unreal.</p>

	<p>In fact, in that universe, not many powers were able to hurt Crape Myrtle. It was more like there weren’t any.
	</p>

	<p>Unless he walked the last step, even a guy like Qin Xiu would be unable to harm Crape Myrtle.</p>

	<p>Crape Myrtle was only half a step away from achieving the Universe class. That was one reason. The most important
		one was the fact he was the leader of the geno hall, and the geno hall was like a machine that controlled the
		universe. Crape Myrtle himself was the greatest master in the universe.</p>

	<p>In the universe, unless you had a Universe-class power, one could not hurt him.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen’s fist struck Crape Myrtle’s belly, Crape Myrtle stopped talking. His eyes opened wide. The size of
		his pupils shrank.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>With Han Sen’s fist at its center, one could see the wave go across Crape Myrtle’s body. It was like Crape
		Myrtle’s body was a giant blob of jelly.</p>
