<p>Countless Buddha gathered before the lantern. Their bodies burned with Buddha Light. Everyone was giving their power to the lantern, which made the Buddha lantern’s flame blaze even brighter. It was like a northern light shining across every creature in the universe. It released an unimaginably scary power.</p>

<p>“Han Sen! Are you really going to fight the Buddha to your death?” Burning Lamp looked calm, but his eyes could not hide his seething desire for murder.</p>

<p>“I am only destroying the Buddha,” Han Sen coldly said. “It can’t be that difficult.”</p>

<p>After hearing Han Sen say that, everyone in the universe had a strange expression.</p>

<p>Buddha power was not great in terms of a higher race, but Burning Lamp, the Buddha Alpha, was an exception. He had surprisingly reached butterfly class. During, the geno god list fights, he had managed to beat a Pluto Peacock. He destroyed a powerful true god xenogeneic to achieve the 80th rank. Even people from higher races or ranks would have thought twice about challenging the Buddha.</p>

<p>Plus, the Buddha had the support of the Extreme King. The Extreme King would not sit idly by and watch the Buddha get attacked. If they did, no one would place their trust and faith in the Extreme King anymore.</p>

<p>“Godfather Han is too arrogant. Although there are many deifieds in Space Garden, they are all just primitive. How can he compare to Burning Lamp, who was in the top 100 on the geno god list?”</p>

<p>“Godfather Han is challenging the Buddha alone.”</p>

<p>Everyone was talking. Yisha looked weird and said, “Of course, he challenged the Buddha and did it alone.”</p>

<p>Sky Palace Leader laughed and said, “I see Han Sen’s level is not too low. He might succeed, but…”</p>

<p>“But what?” Yisha asked.</p>

<p>“The crystallizers failed their challenge back then. It was because an outsider joined the race fight. The high race that appeared back then might show up once more to stop the crystallizers again. Even if they do not show up, the Very High might not be willing to let Han Sen go. This will still be very difficult.” Sky Palace Leader shook his head.</p>

<p>“Back then, who interfered and prevented the crystallizers from becoming a higher race?” Yisha asked with a frown.</p>

<p>“It is hard to say. It has been a long time. Whatever creatures witnessed that fight are most likely all dead. Even the old antiques that are still alive won’t talk about it anymore.” Sky Palace Leader laughed and said, “Regardless, the people that stopped the crystallizers have already become historical cosmic dust. They might not appear again. What Han Sen needs to do now is deal with Burning Lamp and the Very High.”</p>

<p>While they were talking, the Buddha were furious after hearing what Han Sen said.</p>

<p>“Mister Alpha, this guy should be killed.”</p>

<p>“We have to rip him apart and have him atone for his crimes.”</p>

<p>“Mister Alpha, please give us the order. I swear I am going to kill this man.”</p>

<p>Burning Lamp continued to look calm, but the murderous fires in his eyes became wilder. He coldly said the Buddha’s catchphrase, “Amitabha! If you really are going to do this, then you cannot blame the Buddha for being mean to Sky Palace.”</p>

<p>That sentence was obviously not meant for Han Sen. He was saying it to Sky Palace Leader and Yisha.</p>

<p>After saying that, Burning Lamp’s Buddha blazed with Buddha Light. He waved his hand and cast a weird Buddha Light. It was a transformation skill that turned Han Sen into an ant.</p>

<p>Now, Burning Lamp was butterfly class. He was stronger than he was before. This transformation light, as a result, was stronger than before. Under his palms, it was like he could claim the whole of space.</p>

<p>The Buddha saw Han Sen had no reaction. When he was hit by the shapeshifting Buddha Light, he looked happy.</p>

<p>When the shapeshifting Buddha Light struck Han Sen, it was like a breeze across his face. It did not change the shape of Han Sen’s genes. It was not even able to ruffle his hair. Han Sen remained coldly standing in space. Not even his sleeves had moved.</p>

<p>Along with Burning Lamp, the expressions of many Buddha elites changed. When Burning Lamp began the geno god list fight, he used this shapeshifting Buddha Light to turn a primitive deified into a toad.</p>

<p>Han Sen just stood there. He did not do anything against the shapeshifting Buddha Light, yet he was unaffected. His body was incredibly resilient. He was more than a primitive deified.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s Jade Skin skills had already become butterfly. It was hard to imagine how much stronger his body had become. It was not easy to change his appearance and genes.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just Burning Lamp’s shapeshifting skills that would not work. Even if Very High Leader came, using a skill to change the sky and ground would not move Han Sen’s gene base.</p>

<p>“That is a very powerful non-leaking body,” Sky Palace Leader complimentarily said. “It looks like this kid has become butterfly class.”</p>

<p>Yisha’s eyes were closed. She was glad Han Sen had become butterfly so fast, but the way forward was now more dangerous. Being a butterfly may not have been enough for him to deal with the can of worms he had opened.</p>

<p>Han Sen stood in space, coldly looking at Burning Lamp. He said, “You should just give me the causal karma knife and true god weapon. Using your dirty little tricks will only make people laugh.”</p>

<p>The Buddha students were livid, but they were not as cocky as they were earlier. Han Sen took Burning Lamp’s hit and did not get hurt, which worried them.</p>

<p>“Amitabha!” Burning Lamp spoke the Buddha catchphrase but said nothing else. He brought out the causal karma knife.</p>

<p>The knife was in his hands. Burning Lamp’s entire body seemed to change. It was as if some God Spirit had slipped into his skin to operate his bones. The Buddha Light was incredibly bright. A scary power came toward Han Sen. It was like a scary wave.</p>

<p>No matter how Burning Lamp’s power increased, Han Sen saw it as nothing. He only saw Burning Lamp’s hands with the causal karma knife. It just made him laugh. “Burning Lamp! Burning Lamp! You are alright as a person. You did this really well. You turned my knife blank into a splendid weapon. In fact, I should thank you.”</p>

<p>Burning Lamp shouted, “This knife is my race weapon! Don’t you talk crap!” He was not going to allow Han Sen to speak. He slashed toward Han Sen. The Buddha Light on the knife arrived in front of Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not flash or dodge. He turned his hands into a knife and used Teeth Knife for an eye-to-eye fight.</p>

<p>The purple knife light came out of his hands. It went across Burning Lamp’s Buddha shadow knife light. The Buddha Light looked strong, but Han Sen was able to crack it with just one slash. The purple knife light was powerful. It appeared in front of Burning Lamp. He was shocked by this, so he tried to dodge it. He was too late. His Buddha clothing was cut a little.</p>

<p>The universe was shocked. Burning Lamp was in the top 100 of the geno god list. His power was not great, but he was still a butterfly. He also had a true god weapon, yet he could still not defeat Han Sen.</p>
