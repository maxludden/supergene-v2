    <p>
      Han Sen looked in the direction that Son of Fate&#8217;s gaze had
      stiffened, and noticed it was Zero who he had seen. She had emerged from
      the Tree King and was now approaching them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero had already returned to her human form, but her hands held a red
      knife.
    </p>

    <p>
      The knife was around a foot long, and it was completely red. It had
      skeletal characteristics, and its color made it look like a bone that had
      been soaked in blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen frowned, unsure why Son of Fate would be so scared upon seeing
      Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible! Impossible!&#8221; Son of Fate was screaming like a
      madman, and he looked horrified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at him, ready to tell him to shut up, but before he could,
      a red flash cut across his vision. When his eyes steadied their focus, he
      saw the blood-bone knife lodge itself in Son of Fate&#8217;s heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Fate twitched. All the blood in his body began to course towards
      his heart, forming a coagulated lump. Then, his skin shrivelled and dried
      out, becoming another unrecognizable, skeletal husk of a corpse, just like
      the rest in the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s eyebrows jumped. He did not know where Zero had gotten
      this knife, but she had callously murdered Son of Fate with no given
      reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero walked in front of Son of Fate and pulled the bone knife out of his
      heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why would you do that? You killed him!&#8221; Han Sen asked, with
      his eyebrows furrowed.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;He deserved it,&#8221; Zero answered.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whether or not he deserved it is irrelevant; I asked you why you
      killed him, so tell me,&#8221; Han Sen asked again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero looked at Han Sen but did not speak. She merely looked at him the
      same way she always did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at her bone knife and asked, &#8220;Where did you get that
      from?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It was inside the tree,&#8221; Zero answered.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You punched a hole into the tree so you could retrieve this
      knife?&#8221; Han Sen was surprised, and so he asked for confirmation.
    </p>

    <p>Zero nodded.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How did you know this bony knife was inside that tree?&#8221; Han
      Sen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero had never been to this area of the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary
      before, so how could she know the knife was there?
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It was calling for me.&#8221; Zero swung the bone knife.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen reached out his hand, attempting to grab the knife and saying,
      &#8220;Let me take a look.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      But Zero quickly withdrew her hand and snapped, &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch
      it!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why not?&#8221; Han Sen frowned, thinking Zero was behaving
      abnormally.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You will die,&#8221; Zero said, with a queasy amount of gravitas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen froze. He wasn&#8217;t sure what she meant; would he die if he
      touched it, or would she kill him if he laid a finger on it?
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking into Zero&#8217;s clear eyes, Han Sen pondered which she meant. He
      was leaning towards the former, however, as he didn&#8217;t believe Zero
      would simply kill him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t ask any further questions. Instead, he returned his
      focus to the corpse of Son of Fate. He plundered his pockets in search of
      any notable loot he might have possessed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Fate&#8217;s body was not heavily clothed, and much of what he wore
      was already in tatters. After his body had dried up, the clothes were like
      loose strips of fabric crumpled across a twisted branch. There was nothing
      to be found.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when Han Sen looked at Son of Fate&#8217;s back, he was shocked. The
      tattoo of the nine-life cat had completely disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen checked every nook and cranny across his body, but he could not
      find anything remotely similar to the tattoo he had seen earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you know who this man is?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Zero and
      posed the question.
    </p>

    <p>
      She shook her head. Han Sen believed she did not know anything, so he
      didn&#8217;t ask again. He approached the coffin Son of Fate had been in.
    </p>

    <p>
      The coffin seemed to have been constructed from the wood of the local Dark
      Haunted Trees, but there was nothing else of significance. The coffin was
      empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unable to find anything there, Han Sen instead turned his attention to the
      Tree King and started walking in its direction. No longer did it drain Han
      Sen&#8217;s lifeforce, so he walked right up to it without trepidation.
    </p>

    <p>
      He observed the hole that Zero had punched into it, and noticed how eerie
      it looked. It seemed like an infinite abyss, where no light could reach.
      Looking back at Zero, he saw that she was just following him in the casual
      manner she always did. Gritting his teeth, Han Sen entered the hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interior of the tree was big, but there did not seem to be anything
      special on the inside. There was nothing notable there for Han Sen to
      find.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Strange.&#8221; Han Sen frowned and looked at Zero. He wanted to
      ask her more questions, but it was unlikely she would answer him directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unable to find anything, Han Sen decided to ride atop his Golden Growler
      and go off in search of the missing Liu Fang and Wang Jiangang. When he
      found them, they were still in shock, but uninjured. The curse of the
      woods seemed to have been lifted, so Han Sen was able to lead them out.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dark Haunted Trees and bugs did not look any different than they used
      to, but nothing prohibited their exit. In fact, they found the borders of
      the forest relatively soon. The forest was only a few hundred miles wide,
      at the most.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Fang and Wang Jiangang&#8217;s joy was only suppressed by their
      relief, after leaving the forest. They believed themselves incredibly
      fortunate to have survived in the forest all that time, including the
      dangers that had followed Han Sen&#8217;s arrival. But still, an uneasy
      feeling over the ordeal had managed to latch itself onto Han Sen&#8217;s
      mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero&#8217;s blood-bone knife had vanished from her hands, too, Han Sen
      noticed after some time. He wasn&#8217;t sure where she put it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If the nine-life cat&#8217;s necklace is a relic of the Blood
      Legion, that means I will be able to practice the Blood-Pulse
      Sutra,&#8221; Han Sen thought, excitedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he had already learned the Dongxuan Sutra, the more he learned
      the better. What&#8217;s more, the strengths of the Blood-Pulse Sutra
      could benefit his next-in-lineage, if he ever had a child.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen followed the Blood-Pulse Sutra and held the nine-life cat necklace
      for its practice. It took him half a month before he could label himself a
      beginner, so it was clearly going to take quite some time before he
      unlocked its first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      He practiced it frequently, on his trip towards Blue-Crystal Shelter, and
      six days later, he found a second-generation super creature down near a
      riverbank.
    </p>

    <p>
      It looked like a serpent-wyrm, and when it flew above the river, it
      attempted to eat Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and the silver fox quickly beat it up, however. And because he had
      grown fond of smashing the skulls of his opponents lately, Han Sen made
      sure to turn into a silver ape to lay the smackdown.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Riverbank Wyrm Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. The
        Flesh Of This Creature Is Edible, And You May Harvest Its Life Geno
        Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno
        Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen refined the wyrm&#8217;s Life Geno Essence and received six super
      geno points. He only needed two more points to max out now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flesh of the creature was shared between the silver fox and the fairy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Soon, I will reach the Third God&#8217;s Shelter. I hope my luck
      holds out.&#8221; Han Sen was a little worried, but he still had the lotus
      symbol on his forehead.
    </p>

    <p>
      He went to a nearby human shelter to restock his supplies and ask around
      for where he might find more super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen heard a strange tale, one that seemed worth checking out. He was
      told of a mountain that was repeatedly thunderstruck, night and day. If
      there was a super creature there, it was most likely one that adhered to
      the elements of thunder. If that was true, then its slaying would prove
      beneficial to the silver fox.
