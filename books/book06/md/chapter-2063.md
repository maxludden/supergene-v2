  Han Sen did not care. He kept on swinging knife airs at his foe. Most of them failed, but many were able to come close to the basic shape that he needed. It was like a plucked string, vibrating to produce tones that could break the sky.

Dragon Nine’s Evilbreaker Blood Dragon Light was unable to touch Han Sen, and it made him furrow his brows in frustration. The Blood Dragon Light flowed brighter, and the light in his wings became solid. It was like a fog of blood obscuring the sky.

Red scales appeared all across Dragon Nine’s body, and his hands produced red Dragon talons. A red mist rose from his horns, and his entire body grew to twice its original size. He was four meters tall now.

The scary presence he once carried only grew scarier. It was like an ocean wave, endlessly building in size.

Han Sen looked at Dragon Nine. The Blood Feather Knife was still busy producing knife silks. Dragon Nine didn’t bother dodging. He allowed the silk to fall upon him, as the light would break them before they could even land atop his scales.

“Your xenogeneic draconic body is really nice,” Han Sen said politely.

Dragon Nine snarled, “A xenogeneic dragon body is nothing to one of the Dragon. My Blood Dragon body is different, however. Even if you have Break Space Flash, I am now something you cannot hope to escape.”

“I would like to know what the difference is.” Han Sen kept talking as he repeatedly swung his knife.

He was starting to grasp a subtle sense of what he needed to do. The knife silks that were made of both a soft and strong power were manifesting with a better success rate. All he had to do now was to concentrate what he was coming to grips with, and channel what he needed to learn from Dragon Nine to make them as tough as the Dragon Lights.

Dragon Nine did not respond. He lifted his Dragon lance with two hands. His Evilbreaker Blood Dragon Light was spreading across the weapon, and the lance reacted as if it was alive. It became a scary Blood Dragon, and it roared in Dragon Nine’s hands. Its glow intensified.

Han Sen kept swinging. The knife silks cut across Dragon Nine’s body repeatedly, but the attacks did nothing.

“Old Nine is really mad. He cast Blood Dragon’s Anger!” Dragon Seven said with a smile.

Dragon Fifteen said, “If this is all he needs to kill Han Sen, he should just do it. What’s the point in talking?”

Han Sen looked glum. He knew Dragon Nine’s Lance was strong, and so he started moving his Blood Feather Knife faster.

“Han Sen, accept my Blood Dragon’s Anger!” The power in Dragon Nine’s body reached the max. His red dragon wings flapped, and the lance he held looked like a ravenous monster. The Dragon was a manifestation of light, and it held the power to destroy the world. It appeared in front of Han Sen, and it was going to consume him.

Han Sen flapped his red dragon wings and teleported one hundred meters away. This was the furthest away he could teleport with Break Space Flash.

But when Han Sen moved, something went awry. The Blood Dragon’s body exploded, and the Dragon Light went off like a firework.

The concentrated lancelight was perfectly pure, and it expanded to a radius of one mile. And it was not like an arrow that, once fired, became nothing.

The Dragon Light exploded like a hail of needles. No matter which way Han Sen moved, he’d be unable to dodge it.

The Dragon Light wasn’t random or uncontrolled. If one touched Han Sen, the other streams of light would turn to riddle him with numerous strikes.

Han Sen’s body would be turned into a pincushion, and the Dragon Light would explode from inside him. Not even a Duke elite could escape a power as wretched as that.

Break Space Flash’s max distance was a hundred meters. Han Sen couldn’t use it to get far enough away to escape the Blood Dragon’s Anger’s area of effect.

“If I cannot dodge, then there is no point trying.” Han Sen gripped his Blood Feather Knife and kept swinging at the Dragon Light. He did not use Under the Sky. Now, he was using Teeth Knife.

Fang!

The purple knife air became a toxic fang headed towards the Dragon Light. The purple knife air struck the Dragon Light and made a katcha sound.

Teeth Knife’s purple mist was broken through and dispersed. A second later, the Dragon Light had destroyed it, and the light kept moving towards Han Sen.

Han Sen retreated and continued using his Blood Feather Knife. He was still determined to use Tusk, and so two purple teeth marks appeared on the Dragon Light next. It made a scary, cracking noise once again.

The Teeth power was shattered, but it shattered more slowly this time. It made the Blood Dragon’s Anger far slower, and it gave Han Sen enough time to get out of the Blood Dragon’s Anger’s area of effect.

But the Blood Dragon’s Anger was like something alive. The Dragon Light became a red dragon that sought to consume Han Sen. When Han Sen evaded it, it exploded.

“Let me see how many times you can teleport.” Dragon Nine coldly looked at the Blood Dragon’s Anger covering Han Sen.

Han Sen used Teeth powers, but this time, they were more solid than before. A squeaking noise was made when the two collided, and then the Teeth powers shattered.

Dragon Seven was shocked. “His Teeth powers now seem different!”

“What’s the difference? He copied Brother Nine’s concentrated powers. No matter how hard he tries, though, he won’t get anything half as good as Brother Nine’s Blood Dragon Light.” Dragon Fifteen looked haughtily as Han Sen.

Things weren’t as simple as he initially believed them to be, however. When Han Sen used Teeth powers the fourth time, the purple Fang struck, it was still broken by the Blood Dragon’s Anger. However, it also managed to chip off a bit of the Dragon Light.

Han Sen wanted to use soft and strong powers on the knife silks, but knife silks were merely thin strings. They were worse than the Dragon Light, when compared side by side.

The results were different when Han Sen tried to use that concentrated power on Teeth Knife instead. The strong and soft powers melded well with the Teeth powers. When it was concentrated, the sharp power was no worse than what the Dragon Light could achieve.

After adding the soft elements, the Teeth power became both soft and tough. It was not easy to break when it was hit.

If it was too tough, it’d break. If it was too soft, it’d bend. Teeth powers were able to benefit well from both aspects. While they were concentrated, his tearing power became stronger.

Katcha! Katcha!

Toxic Teeth and Dragon Lights came to collide against each other in the air. In the beginning, Han Sen’s Teeth power was at a disadvantage, and it kept being broken.

But as Han Sen kept swinging, Teeth Knife gradually improved. After ten slashes, he could fight the Blood Dragon’s Dragon Light.

The purple smoke broke, and a red light went flying. Teeth and a Dragon were fighting in the air. No one could tell who had an advantage between the two.
