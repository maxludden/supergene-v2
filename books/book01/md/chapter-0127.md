The reason he chose Devil Desert was that there were not many creatures that could fly, hence it was relatively safe for Han Sen who could. Few people would go there, so there was no shortage of mutant creatures, if not sacred-blood creatures.

Han Sen studied the conditions of the desert and was ready to ask Qin Xuan for a leave. Qin Xuan smiled and said, "Perfect. Our squad needs to protect someone in hunting and I was just thinking where we should take her. You could lead the team to Devil Desert then. It is your first task in the squad, make sure you do a good job."

"What is the reward for this task?" Han Sen blinked and asked, he did not want to do a job that would not pay well.

"If you can make the girl satisfied and designate you as her protector in Steel Armor Shelter, you could get an S-Class license of Saint Hall." Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen and laughed. "Any interest?"

"Yes, I am very interested," Han Sen quickly said. Babysitting alone would pay an S-Class license. Such a good thing could only happen in a dream.

"Then do well. You will get nothing if she is not satisfied with you." Qin Xuan handed him the portfolio.

After reading the materials, Han Sen felt he did not learn anything, as these people's personal information was all confidential. All he knew was the name, age and gender.

"Wang Mengmeng, female, 16 years and 47 days old. Stationmaster, you are not asking me to take a girl who has just entered God’s Sanctuary to a place like Devil Desert. I can’t guarantee her safety." Han Sen looked sullen.

"Of course not. This is your first task, so I will ask Gambler to follow you. You could also pick some people from Steel Armor Shelter." Qin Xuan smiled. "About Wang Mengmeng, I can tell you one more thing. She is your schoolmate."

"My schoolmate? Blackhawk? You must be kidding me. She just entered God’s Sanctuary and with that kind of fitness, she could not even have reached the standard for any special enrolment program." Han Sen did not believe her.

"Some people do not need to pass the exam. We all have different starting points, like you are to protect her, and she is to be protected." Qin Xuan smiled. "Remember to keep a good relationship with her."

"I'm not interested in little girls," Han Sen shrugged and said.

Qin Xuan rolled her eyes at him and said, "Go pick some team members in Steel Armor Gang. You can choose anyone but the team leaders. There should be less than ten members and the fees will be covered by the squad."

Han Sen asked Su Xiaoqiao and some others who had a mutant mount. He did not want to waste his time on walking and would not consider those without mounts.

As for Gambler, Han Sen was confident in him. He was an old member in the squad and had amazing skills, like Sleeveblade.

When Han Sen saw Wang Mengmeng, he finally knew what privileges meant. A girl just over 16 who had just entered God’s Sanctuary for one month had mutant shapeshifting beast soul, mutant armor, mutant weapon and one sacred-blood beast soul mount, making Han Sen and the rest rather jealous.

Although Lin Beifeng was rich, he was only an upstart when compared with Wang Mengmeng. The beast souls she had probably could not be bought with money.

Fortunately, Wang Mengmeng was not an annoying princess. She was delightful and lovely.

She also fought well. Although she had only been in God’s Sanctuary for a month, it looked like that she had gained quite a few geno points already. She must have practiced multiple advanced hyper geno arts since childhood.

Using her advanced beast souls, she could probably beat Su Xiaoqiao in a combat.

The team had been traveling all the time and Wang Mengmeng never complained.

"Brother Han, I heard from Sister Qin that you are also in Blackhawk. I’m in Department of Warframe, which department are you in?" Wang Mengmeng called Han Sen brother in a natural and sweet tone.

In fact, kids from prominent families like Wang Mengmeng, Qing and Yuan were all quite well mannered and easy going.

"Ahem, you can call me Sen. I was enrolled this year as well. We are both freshmen and I am an archery major." Han Sen enjoyed talking to an adorable girl like her, which make the journey less boring.

"Archery Department is the department our school is trying to enhance this year and I’m sure the change will happen fast. You must be specially enrolled?" Wang Mengmeng started to chat with him.

"Oh right, Brother Han, you came to Steel Armor Shelter early, so you must have seen Dollar himself?" Wang Mengmeng asked hopefully.

"Yes, we have all seen him at the contest. Why do you ask about him?" Han Sen looked at Wang Mengmeng, surprised.

"I am a fan of Dollar’s, but unfortunately he never showed up since I came here, so I never got to see him," Wang Mengmeng said with some disappointment.

Wang Mengmeng asked again, "Brother Han, can you tell me something about Dollar?"

"Ahem, I have no way of knowing. You have to ask him, because he knows everything." Han Sen pointed to Su Xiaoqiao.

Su Xiaoqiao quickly thumped his chest and said, "What do you want to know? I’m Dollar’s buddy and it was me who named him Dollar."

"Wow, then you must know what Dollar really looks like? He must be very handsome?" Wang Mengmeng looked at Su Xiaoqiao happily.

"Handsome, of course, he is most handsome. He has wide chest, long legs and nice round bottom..." Su Xiaoqiao babbled on and Han Sen almost wanted to kill him.

It took them four days to reach Devil Desert. Wang Mengmeng had nice skills and was improving very fast in hunting.

Han Sen and Gambler were always shadowing her. Even when she was fighting with a creature, Gambler was always following her and Han Sen’s bow and arrow were always ready to rescue her.

If something happened to her, the entire squad including Qin Xuan would be in trouble, so Han Sen did not dare to slack at all.

The next afternoon after they had entered the desert, Su Xiaoqiao who was the scout cried in surprise, "A mutant creature!"

Everyone quickly urged their mounts on and saw a fox-like, fire-red and golden-horned creature the size of a tiger barking at them.

"It is mine." It was the first time Wang Mengmeng had seen a living mutant creature. She put away her mount and charged the mutant creature with a pair of mutant beast soul lancets in her hands.
