  The leader of the centaurs looked murderous. He was gleefully watching his men commit happily to the slaughter, as the droves of people began screaming and crying. This wasn’t war; this was a massacre.

Ordinary Kate had geno armor, but they could not fight They could not resist the onslaught.

A centaur warrior struck a woman down with his spear. She grabbed it with one hand while pushing her daughter away with a blood-curdling scream. “Run to the ship!”

The centaur warrior tried to pull his spear back out of the woman’s body, but her grip was firm. She held tightly to the spear that was deep in her blood-dyed chest.

A little four-year-old girl came running over to her mother in tears. She hadn’t run to the ship as she had been instructed to. Even if she had listened, though, she’d have been unable to penetrate the crowd.

Another of the centaur warriors smiled cruelly. He swung his spear down towards the crying little girl.

“No!” The woman’s voice broke.

Pang!

A horn arrow appeared, punching through the centaur warrior’s head, then pinning the beast to the asphalt.

Han Sen held his Gold Feather Bow as he leaped off the ship. He ran in front of the fallen warrior and pulled the arrow out of its head.

Han Sen had seen a lot of life and death, and his mind didn’t care. But sometimes, his body didn’t listen.

The other centaur warrior screamed. He pulled his spear out of the woman and tried cutting Han Sen down. But all Han Sen had to do was move slightly and step past the warrior.

He moved his bow and brought its string up to the beast’s neck. Then, the severed head fell off and bounced across the ground.

“D*mn you!” The centaur leader shouted furiously. His muscles flared up as he suddenly chucked his giant spear. It crossed a few dozen meters, coming right at Han Sen.

Han Sen didn’t even seem to look at the spear as he stepped around it. He pulled his Gold Feather Bow and fired two horn arrows. Each arrow neatly punctured the head of a centaur.

The closest warriors ran towards Han Sen, but he was able to swing around with his bow and use the string to decapitate several of the beasts. The heads barreled through the sky with bloody trails.

One step, one kill. He pulled his horn arrows from the corpses and immediately fired them at another two centaurs.

“How dare you kill my Taurus warriors! I’m going to skin you alive.” The centaur leader roared and jumped towards Han Sen.

As this occurred, a few other warriors blew on horns to gather more reinforcements. It was really loud, echoing through the sky.

Han Sen had been quickly killing the enemy. He had one bow and two arrows, but that didn’t stop him from being a complete killing machine. Everywhere he went, the warriors lost their heads.

“That Dollar is a nice person, but he sure is reckless. The Taurus HQ is fairly near. He must have a death wish.”

The Barons on the ship came on deck and talked as they watched the action below.

Mike’s face kept changing. He wanted to go down and save the crowd, but he knew his own limits and realized that he likely couldn’t help. It would be easy to get off the ship, but nigh impossible to get back on. If he killed one of the Taurus warriors, those of Seven Mirrors would not let them back.

With the situation unfolding the way it was, choosing to engage the Taurus really was akin to having a death wish.

As Han Sen was killing like mad, Lao Zhuoma looked at him with a conflicted expression. He felt both touched and ashamed. He was a Kate, but he had been unable to protect his own people.

With Han Sen there, the warriors did not run to the crowd. They all tried to kill Han Sen.

As Han Sen fought, he kept moving further and further from the ship.

He knew it was pointless to kill the warriors, but he just wanted to buy some time for the Kate to get on the ship.

The centaur leader was finally in front of Han Sen. The beast swung his spear, and it was most certainly stronger than what the other warriors could do. The leader was a Baron. But Han Sen’s face did not change. For some reason, his movements allowed him to dodge the attack. When he walked past the leader, the string took off the leader’s head just like it had with the other warriors.

The Barons and Lao Zhuoma on the ship all sighed. The Taurus were very good at killing, and their Barons were much greater than Kate Barons.

Watching Han Sen cut off the leader’s head was quite scary.

“This guy is so strong! He said that he’s a human? What is that race? Is it a higher race?” a Baron asked in shock.

“It is a shame. If he was allowed to live, he might have been able to do a whole lot more. But he is too reckless.” Another Baron shook his head.

As this occurred, a flurry of footsteps was rushing Han Sen’s way. A centaur warrior was coming, but it was twice as big as the average centaur. It was also clad in metal armor. The four legs could cross a dozen meters in one step.

It was different from the spear-wielding warriors, and it was holding a two-meter-long greatsword. Despite that, it carried the sword lightly, like it wasn’t heavy at all.

But seeing the texture of the blade, it was obvious that the sword was made from heavy steel. There was no way it was actually light.

“Oh no! This is a Taurus greatsword-wielding Viscount It is a really high rank amongst the Viscounts. He is so strong, and he can wield the element of fire to incinerate foes,” explained a Baron on deck.

“I hope he can hold out a bit longer. Since he is going to die anyway, holding out another few minutes will allow a few more Kate to get on.” Another of the Barons sighed.

Han Sen saw the greatsword centaur coming, but he still remained oh-so-calm. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t killed a Viscount before. He had already killed three of them, after all.

He kept moving forward, trying to lure the warriors away from the ship. When the greatsword-wielding centaur got close, Han Sen sped up a little more.

The creature was only a hundred meters away.

“Die!” The greatsword-wielding centaur’s feet were like thunder. It jumped a few dozen meters with the greatsword swinging towards Han Sen’s head.

The steel suddenly blazed with red fire, radiating enough power to sunder a building.
