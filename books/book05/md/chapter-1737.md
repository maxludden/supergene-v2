  Han Sen held Littleflower, and as he did, he felt the power extinguish. He fell to the ground and almost broke his bones.

After getting his vision back, Han Sen saw a broken palace around him. It was made of jade and metal, and it looked as if he had ended up in heaven.

It was all broken. And there was a fissure that was as wide as a valley across the palace. What had occurred there, Han Sen had no idea.

Han Sen was standing on a gold plaque. There were strange symbols inscribed across it: ones he could not discern.

Not far from Han Sen stood a man with green clothing. He was smiling at Littleflower, who was in Han Sen’s arms. It was like the man was inspecting an ancient antique.

Littleflower looked scared, though. Han Sen held his child tight, and he stood up off the floor. Han Sen said, “Thank you for killing the xenogeneic beast. But why have you brought us here?”

The man did not even look at Han Sen. He only looked at Littleflower. “I require one more student. This kid looks decent. Let me take him.”

“If you want to accept my son as a student, at least tell me what you are and tell me where we are.” Han Sen did not want Littleflower to have a master, but the man was obviously quite scary. So, he went along with it.

If the man wanted to take Littleflower away by force, no matter what strength Han Sen could muster, it wouldn’t be enough to stop him.

As this occurred, the man’s vision turned away from Littleflower. He now looked at Han Sen. “I am the king of Sky Palace. You have such an amazing kid. If he follows me, he can become so powerful… You cannot imagine it.”

Han Sen had never heard of Sky Palace before, but seeing the man, it must have been a very powerful faction.

“I am glad that someone powerful like you wants to take my son as a student, but he is still young. And I hope you can approve of me coming with him,” Han Sen said.

The man shook his head. “You are too weak. You cannot go to Sky Palace.”

“I don’t expect myself to become a student. I can be a janitor or something,” Han Sen said.

“You are too weak to enter the palace, so stop talking.” The man sounded annoyed, and he reached out to grab Littleflower. Han Sen felt an incredible strength come and try to snatch Littleflower, but he held onto his son and got pulled, too.

The man looked as if he did not care about family one tiny bit. He grabbed Littleflower and tried to take him away from Han Sen.

“Dad!” Littleflower was in shock. He tried using his holy light, but it couldn’t overcome the power. He was still being pulled away.

Han Sen roared. He walked forward and tried to punch the man’s hand.

Boom!

When Han Sen’s fist hit the man’s palm, he could not hurt the palm, and his arm snapped immediately.

“You are his father, so I will forgive you for this disrespect. I’d turn you into dust, if you were anyone else.” The man grunted and pulled Littleflower again.

Han Sen’s legs released a power. He took half a step back and got pulled away.

Boom!

The red light behind Han Sen was shining, turning into a red vortex. Before the man could grab Littleflower again, the vortex consumed Han Sen and the child. They just suddenly vanished.

“D*mn it! He is a descendant of the Nine-Life Cat bloodline.” The man’s face changed, as he gritted his teeth.

In the Alliance universe, Gu Qingcheng was swinging her weapon at Zero’s head. As the blade touched her skin, everyone stared at her speechlessly. The redlight behind Zero shone like a flower.

And Gu Qingcheng’s sword was brought to a halt It only touched Zero’s neck, and it didn’t really cut it As the light gleamed from Zero’s back, two bodies fell out It was Han Sen and Littleflower.

Ji Yanran and Luo Lan were so happy, they cried. They raced over to them.

The dangerous fight had passed. Everyone was injured, so they all went home to heal.

Han Sen was worried that the Sky Palace guy might show up in the sanctuary again, but luckily, it didn’t happen. It was quiet over the next few days. Now that Han Sen knew how the sanctuary operated, not even elites like that could destroy it in his absence.

Han Sen was also quite glad he was back in the Alliance, but he was still worried.

The Nine-Life Cat tattoo was far too weird. Han Sen could travel between his tattoo and Zero’s tattoo.

That wasn’t what he worried about the most, though. He was mostly worried that if Old Cat had that power, the cat could also summon Han Sen. It had happened to him once before, and he had no doubt it would happen again.

So, Han Sen wanted to learn more about the Nine-Life Cat tattoo. He and Zero were unable to control its power, but it was obvious that something triggered the activation of those tattoos. Its unpredictability annoyed Han Sen.

Han Sen couldn’t figure it out, though, Not long after, the Luo family contacted Luo Lan. Luo Haitang was hoping Luo Lan could bring Han Sen, Han Yan, and Littleflower to see him.

Although Luo Haitang couldn’t explain what it was all about, Luo Lan was able to guess why. They had a family meeting, and ultimately they decided to go and see the Luo family.

Han Sen did not object. If Luo Haitang was telling the truth, he did not have much time left. The man had raised Han Sen’s mother, and even if Luo Lan did not explicitly say she wanted to see him, it was clear that she did.

Aside from the Han family, they also brought Bao’er along.

“Is he really…” Luo Lan couldn’t help but ask Han Sen about Luo Haitang.

Han Sen shook his head. “That’s what he told me. I don’t know if it’s true.”

Luo Lan’s face looked sad. “People like him… I don’t think he’d lie about this. I hope he is okay.”

Han Sen sighed.

When they reached the Luo family’s planet, Luo Li welcomed them in. But even Luo Li looked terrible.

“Sister, you are back. He has waited for you for a long time,” Luo Li said sadly.

“How is he?” Luo Li asked, feeling ill.

“Follow me. He’s waiting.” Luo Li did not answer. She simply brought them to a garden.

When Luo Lan saw Luo Haitang, she couldn’t control a sudden urge to sob.
