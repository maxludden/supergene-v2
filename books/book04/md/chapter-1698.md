  Han Yufei’s expression looked dire. The gap between their strengths was too wide to cover. If Rudy and the others used geno armor that originally belonged to others, Han Yufei reckoned he could make battle with them. He could possibly kill them, too.

But someone who had generated their own self-geno armor was in another league entirely.

Han Yufei knew there was nothing he could do right now. So, the best he could come up with was buying more time by throwing his own fist to meet Yake’s.

“Idiot.” Yake snorted coldly, channeling even more strength into his fist He was primed to deliver the blow straight to Han Yufei’s head.

Ji Yanran thought it was strange, seeing what was going on high above. It seemed as if they were fighting amongst themselves.

Luo Lan looked at Han Yufei and suddenly felt a great worry come over her. Although Han Yufei had transformed and didn’t look the same, when Luo Lan looked into his eyes, she could sense something.

Just as Han Yufei was about to get punched by Yake, a hand suddenly blocked that immense fist and extinguished all that power. It was as if the punch had never been thrown.

“Stay Up Late?” Luo Lan and the others were shocked. Somehow, Stay Up Late was up near Han Yufei, blocking Yake’s punch.

Stay Up Late had seen Han Yufei save Luo Lan once before. Seeing this same, familiar person try to attack Yake from behind, Stay Up Late recognized him.

Stay Up Late blocked Yake’s fist and immediately pulled Han Yufei away from Yake. Then he simply said, “Go back to the Han family.”

“Thanks.” Han Yufei was in shock, but he knew now was not the time for talk. So he held his arm and flew towards Ji Yanran’s building.

Yake looked at Stay Up Late. He didn’t bother trying to pursue Han Yufei, and he simply stared at Stay Up Late.

“You are a crystallizer?” Yake asked, looking up at Stay Up Late.

“I did not expect there to be another crystallizer survivor, apart from myself.” Stay Up Late looked at Yake.

“As a crystallizer, you have chosen to work for a human?” Yake asked.

“I observe the Han family,” Stay Up Late answered. “Why are you killing those of another race? They could be qualified. You should not kill them.”

Yake laughed mockingly. “Observe? The crystallizers were destroyed long ago. That thing doesn’t exist, so it is pointless to observe.”

“I am still here,” Stay Up Late said quietly.

“So what? Even if you are a crystallizer, you can’t say that.” Yake snorted and threw a punch at Stay Up Late.

Stay Up Late deployed his armor, but he didn’t fight Yake. He evaded the attack so that Yake only hit air.

“You don’t dare fight?” Yake looked a little annoyed. He hated Stay Up Late’s face, the way it was currently.

“I am a soldier, and the oaths I am bound to forbid me from issuing harm to just anyone,” Stay Up Late said coldly. His face did not change.

“Soldier? The crystallizers are gone. There are no more soldiers. There are no more oaths. I am the oathmaker now.” When Yake said that, he summoned greater strength and tried to strike Stay Up Late.

Stay Up Late managed to dodge the raging attack, and after, he said, “The oath is in my blood, regardless of whether or not the crystallizers exist”

“In that case, let me see your blood so I can check for the presence of these oaths.” Yake’s armor started to glow, shattering the dimension around him.

But no matter how Yake attacked, nothing he did enabled him to land a strike on Stay Up Late.

“You can’t fight back.” Yake looked cruel as he punched a building. His fist was like a meteor, plummeting into a building with the intent of killing everyone inside.

Stay Up Late frowned and immediately appeared in front of Yake. He punched towards that power and broke it.

“Good timing.” Yake’s geno armor unleashed more power, directed at Stay Up Late in the form of another punch.

Two powers collided against each other, generating a massive shockwave that broke the buildings all around. Yake deliberately placed the shockwave near their building.

“As a crystallizer, you know this is against the law.” Stay Up Late moved and destroyed the power unleashed at the building. He did not allow any of it to touch them.

“So what?” Yake punched again towards the building, continuing to say, “Soldiers are nothing in this era. What is the point of war?”

Stay Up Late punched Yake’s power once again. He stared at Yake and said, “True. The crystallizers are gone, and there are no more crystallizer soldiers and crystallizer laws.”

“It is good that you understand this. Join us. You will earn more than you did when you were a soldier.” Yake continued to attack as he spoke.

“It does not matter who I belong to, but you are the sort of person that I hate. So…” Stay Up Late looked at Yake coldly, and his armor began to shine. A light began to envelop his fist.

Boom!

The scary power of his fist, like an erupting volcano, came down on Yake. Yake used both fists to fight back against it, but Stay Up Late was too strong and quickly whittled away Yake’s defenses.

“Argh!” Yake screamed, as the volcanic power continued to mount. Eventually, his geno armor broke.

Pang!

Yake’s body collapsed on the ground, forming a crater that was filled with blood.

He was struggling down in the earth, unable to get up. Yake looked at Stay Up Late and said, “Enthusiastic rush. You are not a normal soldier. Are you from the Third Division Special Forces?”

“It does not matter. Leave this place and never come back. If the crystallizers weren’t destroyed, you’d be in jail,” Stay Up Late said coldly.

“Haha!” Yake suddenly laughed. “A member of the Third Division Special Forces, huh? That is interesting. When you see him, it will be fun.”

Stay Up Late frowned and looked at Yake, as Yake spoke to the sky. “Officer, you aren’t coming out? Are you simply going to watch us die? Or are you watching the power of the Special Force member killing me?”

Stay Up Late’s body shook, and he looked up to the sky. There, a shadow was slowly approaching. When he saw it, he looked at it in disbelief. He screamed, “Officer, you are not dead!”
