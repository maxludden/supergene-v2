The whole of the Big Qin Kingdom wanted Han Sen dead, but who would have figured Han Sen would not end up arrested? He was holed up in the Feng family’s castle surrounded by the king’s guards.

Although the king had extended comfort to the Steel family, the king did not talk about Han Sen being responsible for the killing of Steel Scene. The officers on the case only said they were investigating it.

Seeing this entire thing was coming to an end, the officers, who were so proud of their law system, could no longer sit back and watch. All of them wrote letters asking King Jing Zhen to right the wrongs and not allow criminals to get off scot-free. Otherwise, the kingdom was to become bad, and chaos would claim everything

There were even officers outside the palace kowtowing. They were shouting various slogans about arresting criminals and upholding the practice of law. It was like if they did not kill Han Sen, the entire kingdom would fall apart. The letters were like snowflakes piling up on King Jing Zhen’s table. Usually, he did not receive that many letters. King Jing Zhen had to take a step back.

This time, inside the palace, there was not much movement. Only the officers who were on the case were given an answer a few days later. After the investigation, other people were deemed responsible for the murder of Steel Scene. It was revealed that Han Sen was set up.

The officers in the government had many sources. Everybody knew that no one had investigated the case properly. Han Sen was not questioned the entire time he was inside the Feng Castle. How was the case over so soon?

The entirety of Jade Wall City was reeling in shock. Overnight, Han Sen had become the biggest villain in the kingdom. Crown Prince Qin Bai had become the most ridiculous and dumbest crown prince in history.

It was unknown who incited all of this. Many nobles were gathering at Feng Castle to protest. There were even some nobles swearing outside the palace, saying the Qin Kingdom had an absurdly incompetent crown prince. Something like this had never happened before in the Qin Kingdom, and the matters were becoming worse. Not even King Jing Zhen knew what to do about the nobles and officers.

The twisted laws of the Qin Kingdom were unique. They were what brought the Qin Kingdom from being on the brink of collapse to a glorious nation again. They also made the Qin Kingdom’s glory unable to reach a higher zenith.

The nobles of the Qin Kingdom were very influential. They fought against royalty. Even King Jing Zhen was not able to do whatever he wanted. He was significantly restricted with what he could do. The royals had two Annihilation class god temples. The nobles also did. The royals had elites, but the nobles had even more. There were many times when King Jing Zhen had to concede. It created a strange balance inside the Qin Kingdom’s government. This time, King Jing Zhen was not going to concede. No matter how much the officers sent letters or how many loyal officers cried and threatened to kill themselves, King Jing Zhen did not say anything. He said the case was over, and that was that.

The nobles and officers did not give up. With grand fury, they were still against the decision.

Han Sen did not care. He just hid inside the Feng Castle, eating and drinking.

“Han Sen, when I go back to the palace, will father kill me?” Qin Bai asked with fear. He thought things had become too big for him.

“Do not worry,” Han Sen said with a smile. “If the king did not come in to capture you or me, that means he has allowed you to remain here.”

Upon hearing that, Qin Bai felt better, but he was still worried. The Qin Kingdom’s nobles were the most powerful in the seven kingdoms. They were willing to fight against the royals. Qin Bai knew about that. Outside, many nobles were surrounding Feng Castle. That made him worry profusely.

It was only now Han Sen learned that the Qin Kingdom’s nobles had such power. Not even the royals were able to clamp down on them.

This time, he had killed Steel Scene and triggered the nobles and their benefits. He had started a conflict between the nobles and royals.

From the results, the royals could not take on everything. Seeing Jian Bu Gu, whose eyes were like jade, focus on working, Han Sen really wanted to fight him. He wanted to see how strong the world’s strongest elite truly was.

It was a shame Jian Bu Gu said he would never fight again. He would not fight back, even if it cost him his life. Han Sen was not going to force him.

Han Sen thought the nobles were going to keep annoying them. After two days, the nobles were all gone.

“Are they really that impatient? They should not be.” Han Sen thought their absence was weird. With the time he had spent in the Qin Kingdom, he knew the people should not have backed off so easily.

Feng Fei Fei had other people go to figure it out. The Gold Crystal System had an infinite light. It covered the whole system, turning it into a rainbow sun.

Everyone knew this was the weird scene of a super God Spirt Blood-Pulse showing up. The nobles did not have time to keep annoying Han Sen. They all ran to the Gold Crystal System to dig up a gene egg. According to the Qin Kingdom’s first mister, Mister Wei, who was Bald Guy’s master, that God Spirit Blood-Pulse had a weird scene that shocked the world. That place probably had a high-class God Spirit Blood-Pulse.

It made the nobles go crazy. If there was an Annihilation class God Spirit Blood-Pulse and they had possessed it, then they would go into the skies with one step. Even if they could not get an Annihilation class God Spirit Blood-Pulse, this was a super God Spirit Blood-Pulse. There were many gene eggs, so there would eventually be a god-class gene race. “I have never seen such a super God Spirit Blood-Pulse before. Let’s go and take a look.” Han Sen knew the nobles and officers would not let him go so easily, but he did not want to be trapped with the Feng family and do nothing. He wanted to explore. After witnessing the power of Thousand Mile Reach, he thought getting a powerful God Spirit Blood-Pulse or gene race would be a good thing. It would help him achieve all the things he had wanted to do.

After all, breaking the rules cost too much trouble. It cost him too much trouble, especially since he couldn’t break them for long.

Since the nobles had already fallen back, Han Sen sent Qin Bai back. He did not want Qin Bai to follow him around. If something happened, he could not go back to Jade Wall City.

Mister Yang and Jian Shi, the mother and the daughter, had to run the online shop. They could not go with Han Sen either. Jian Bu Gu, who was unable to fight, had to remain. Han Sen was ready to go alone, but Li Bing Yu insisted on going with him. Han Sen did not reject her offer.

Han Sen did not know much about the universe of kingdoms, so having someone knowledgeable along would be helpful. He used a quantum teleporter to enter the Gold Crystal System’s Heavy Soil Area. They saw a giant rainbow sun in the sky. The system around was clear. It was like it was right above their heads.

Han Sen knew it wasn’t a real sun. It was a giant system, but the light was too bright. That was why it looked like a sun.
