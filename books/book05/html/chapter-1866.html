<h3>Chapter 1866</h3>

<p>“Bullshit! Why did he join the fight? An Earl fighting a Baron?
What is this?” An old man that was of a higher rank saw the
beautiful man step into the fight. This displeased him a lot.</p>
<p>When most average people saw this, however, they did not mind.
In fact, they were quite excited to see the beautiful man
fight.</p>
<p>“Gao Ji’s attacking! His Dragon Sun knife skill is a Dragon
Moan, and not even Viscounts can withstand something like that. Han
Sen will surely suffer now.”</p>
<p>“Haha. It’ll be good to squash this outsider’s reputation. If
this hadn’t occurred, this entire Moon God’s Festival would have
been his show.”</p>
<p>“Knife Queen is so powerful. She selected a very powerful
student. It may be difficult, being a Baron, but his luck and
talents are very good.”</p>
<p>“Of course. It sounds like you guys thought she only picked him
because he’s good-looking.”</p>
<p>“It’s true that he doesn’t look bad. He is suitable to earn
respect amongst the beauty of the Rebate, but when compared with
us, he is only average. There are many more handsome Rebate men
that far exceed him.”</p>
<p>“It is fine if he loses to Gao Ji. He has done well.”</p>
<p>The Nobles and the commoners were talking. Yisha, Moon Wheel
King, and Night River King were in absolute shock. Gao Ji’s Dragon
Moan was shocking. It was capable of freezing Viscounts on the
spot.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had proven resilient to it, and he was not affected.
Han Sen still gripped his knife, and just as the copper knife was
about to hit him, he drew out his Ghost Teeth Knife.</p>
<p>Seeing Ghost Teeth Knife about to slice open Gao Ji’s neck, the
observers still had to remember that Earls were Earls. Their speed
and reaction times were too fast to comprehend. A green dragon of
light swiftly appeared to swallow Gao Ji’s body.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife hit the green dragon’s shadow. Han Sen tried
his hardest, but he was unable to break the shadow of that dragon.
Han Sen did not put his knife away, though. He still used his knife
to release a purple mist, right next to the green shadow.</p>
<p>Gao Ji frowned. He had used his green shadow dragon’s power to
shake Han Sen away from him.</p>
<p>The moonlight of Narrow Moon was like water. The moonlight shone
on Han Sen, bathing him in its glow. He was getting stronger, and
Gao Ji couldn’t do anything to get away from him. Ghost Teeth Knife
was still mauling the green dragon shadow.</p>
<p>Within that moonlight, Han Sen’s strength continued to rise.
Still, he hadn’t accumulated the strength necessary to overcome his
opponent. The moonlight buff was strong, though, and Gao Ji
continued to use his green dragon shadow, though he still wasn’t
succeeding in shaking Han Sen loose.</p>
<p>“D*nnn! A moonlight buff! Is that a blessing of the Moon
God?”</p>
<p>“It must be. Did you not hear the Moon God say that Han Sen is
the Sun of the Moon? Wherever there is a moon, he will earn a buff
by it.”</p>
<p>That is way too strong. It has buffed a Baron enough to compete
against an Earl. This is too incredible to believe.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but it obviously isn’t fake. This is Narrow Moon, and
there is an abundance of moons. The buffs Han Sen can receive here
are very strong. Anyone of the same tier who tries to fight him
here must have a death wish.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean Narrow Moon has become Han Sen’s territory?”</p>
<p>Yes. Otherwise, he would not have been given the title Son of
the Moon.”</p>
<p>Gao Ji looked glum, unable to shake Han Sen away. So, he decided
to go on the offensive and slash towards his opponent. His knife
carried a green dragon light and a dragon bone.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not think his title would bear such significance.
The moonlight power there was far too strong, so much so that it
allowed him to do battle with an Earl.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not retreat. He used Tooth-for-a-Tooth and struck
towards the green dragon light. Ghost Teeth Knife came against the
fully-powered green dragon knife, and still, it managed to block
the green dragon knife.</p>
<p>They stopped right there, with both knives repeatedly colliding
with each other.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>A crack appeared on the green dragon knife, which then began to
expand and spread across the shadow of the green dragon. It made
the green dragon shadow start to look like a shattered mirror.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife and the green copper knife came against each
other again. Gao Ji had to withdraw his green copper knife and
reluctantly fall back. His powers were less than the moonlight buff
given to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Gao Ji looked cold. He swung his knife with a desire to fight,
but his face changed when he saw his own blade.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife had dealt a crack to the green copper knife.
And soon after, the crack started to spread, until the green copper
knife was wrought with an entire web of cracks.</p>
<p>“This is…” Yisha stood up from her seat. With wide eyes, she
intently observed the cracks that were rapidly manifesting across
the green copper knife.</p>
<p>Yisha, Moon Wheel King, and Night River King, who knew about
Teeth powers, suddenly felt their faces grow pale. They couldn’t
believe what they were witnessing.</p>
<p>“No way…” Night River King looked to be in shock, and he could
do nothing but stare at the green copper knife.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Gao Ji swung his knife again, but when he put the green dragon
light into the green copper knife, there was a sound. And then, the
green copper knife shattered into pieces. It was reduced into
nothing but bits, surrounded by a horrible purple mist.</p>
<p>“Teeth power.”</p>
<p>Everyone had those two words form in their mind. But even still,
it was hard to believe that it was true.</p>
<p>That was the Rebate’s strongest geno art. It was the strongest
skill the entire race of the Rebate possessed. Not many could
practice that, not even amongst the Rebate. But now, an outsider
had just used Teeth power to defeat a Rebate Earl in battle. The
Rebate could not believe this was happening.</p>
<p>Everyone knew Knife Queen was good with Teeth Knife, and
everyone knew Han Sen was her only student. Everyone knew Han Sen
practiced Teeth Knife.</p>
<p>But no one thought, or even dreamed, Han Sen could successfully
use Teeth powers.</p>
<p>In the hearts of the Rebate, learning Teeth power would place
you amongst the most talented of the whole race. Now, the glory and
pride had been crushed by Han Sen. That strike had made all the
Rebate shocked. They could not even think straight.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder that Knife Queen took him as a student. It
wasn’t just for fun.” Night River King looked dim.</p>
<p>“An outsider can use Teeth power, and that person is Knife
Queen’s student. Is he good or bad for Narrow Moon?”</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King was in shock, too.</p>
<p>Yisha was the one who was shocked the most, though. Her mind had
yet to return to her. “How could he have practiced Teeth
power?”</p>
