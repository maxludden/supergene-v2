  Han Sen's body flashed. He kept dodging Yisha's knife attacks. Her knife air could destroy everything. If a planet was to encounter that knife air, it would be cut in half.

That ripping knife air, which could tear the fabric of space, would keep on ripping. The entirety of that space was full of purple knife airs. It was like a giant net. It greatly reduced the safety zones where Han Sen could move. Ripped space was everywhere. If Han Sen's body touched the ripped space, he would be hurt.

"A knife skill like that… A knife air like that… I am afraid the Rebate's status will rise a lot after this showing," Dia Robber said. "Through Knife Queen's efforts alone, getting into the top 100 is not an impossible feat."

"What a scary woman. Her knife air seems to be a Destroyed god body's weakness." Barr's eyes were shining. He stared at Yisha as he spoke.

Dia Robber nodded and said, "Yep. Your Destroyed god body is powerful, but if you were to encounter her knife air, you would lose your advantage. You would keep ripping and end up dead. If you go up against her, you will have to be careful."

At this time, Han Sen was not in the mood to care about how scary Yisha's knife airs were. The halved scabbard in his hands was releasing waves of strange power.

Han Sen knew that was not normal. If a scabbard could be broken by Yisha's knife air, it should keep on ripping. Where this scabbard had broken, knife air did not continue to spread. It still had some light flickering within. The broken scabbard itself was shaking strongly. It was like an object that kept on vibrating. It was like if Han Sen let go, it would fly away.

Is there a secret somewhere inside this scabbard? Han Sen was shocked. He had possessed this scabbard for a long time. Aside from the knife mind inside the scabbard, he did not notice anything special. Now, the scabbard's weird changes surprised Han Sen.

Yisha slashed forward again. Han Sen wanted to evade the strike. From inside the broken scabbard, some power suddenly came out. It was like a volcano erupting out of the scabbard.

Everyone was watching Yisha madly attack Dollar, whose safe zones were continuing to decrease. Han Sen was going to run out of space to dodge. Suddenly, the half-broken scabbard in his hands had a purple light beam coming out of it.

Pang!

The purple beam of light struck Yisha's knife air and broke it. The purple beam of light blasted through, making the place look like a sea of purple. The space that had been ripped up by teeth knife had been mended by the purple light beam's light. Suddenly, the whole of space returned to the clear black color it usually carried. Aside from the pillar of light, there was no more purple.

"What is this? This thing can instantly mend torn space, and it can get rid of teeth knife power?" Sky Palace Leader squinted with his eyes. He looked at Han Sen, who was holding that beam of light.

Every creature in the universe was staring at the beam of light Han Sen was holding. Even Yisha did not attack him again. She stared at Han Sen's hands.

Other people did not know, but Yisha did. The scabbard had been left behind by the Rebate alpha. The Rebate alpha made a wish that the heir could locate the scabbard again. That was why Yisha took a risk and went to Demon Grave in pursuit of that missing scabbard.

But she suffered a bad stroke of luck. She encountered Han Sen, who was posed as Dollar. He had stolen it.

Yisha only knew that it was a relic that once belonged to the alpha. She did not know what the secret inside the scabbard was. If she did, she would not have merrily cut through the scabbard.

That's why Yisha thought this was strange. Her power was already better than the Rebate alpha, but the light beam that came out of the scabbard was able to destroy her knife air. That made her feel shocked. It did not seem to be the power their alpha should have possessed.

If the alpha had left a power behind inside the scabbard like that, Yisha would not have believed it.

After the purple light exploded, the shell of the broken scabbard in Han Sen's hand started to melt in the purple light. The casing of the ink-black scabbard melted away. It revealed a smaller scabbard, which looked as if it had been made from purple copper. It had many weird and pretty engravings across it. The purple beam of light came from the engravings that adorned the scabbard.

When the symbols started to shine, the scabbard became bigger. It was quickly becoming a 3-foot-long scabbard. The scabbard's light slowly started to dim.

After the scabbard's light was extinguished, Yisha and all the creatures in the universe saw Han Sen holding a completely new scabbard that was purple. It was different from the black scabbard he was holding before.

Yisha looked at the purple scabbard with a face that was scribbled with confusion. She had never heard of the alpha scabbard having another scabbard hidden inside it.

"That is... Return Empty Scabbard..." In the halls of the Extreme King, an Extreme King deified elite, whose beard and hair were completely white, was watching the match intently and stood up. He stared at the purple scabbard in Han Sen's hand.

"Return Empty Scabbard!" That name suddenly exploded in the hall.

"Elder Bao, do you really recognize that as the Return Empty Scabbard?" Bai King looked at the old Extreme King man with a serious face.

"I cannot be mistaken. This is definitely Return Empty Scabbard. The elites of the Extreme King's Knife King searched for the Return Empty Scabbard. Back then, my elder Bao King was planning many ways to find the Return Empty Scabbard, but we never did find it. I cannot believe it was in Dollar's hands all along. We must take back the Return Empty Scabbard." Elder Bao was very excited.

"Yes... Return Empty Scabbard is a treasure that belongs to the Extreme King's king. We cannot allow outsiders to possess it. We must take it back."

"We must kill Dollar to take back the Return Empty Scabbard."

The Extreme King knew the Return Empty Scabbard's history. They were all hungrily rubbing their palms together. They now wanted to go to the space battleground and get the Return Empty Scabbard from Han Sen.

The name Knife King was not very famous across the universe. People only knew Knife King was one of the kings of the Extreme King. There was not much about him known across the universe. Knife King had only been a king for the Extreme King for a short amount of time.

In the real Extreme King's higher echelon of people, Knife King's reputation was almost as good as the very first king and perhaps even higher.

It involved one of the Extreme King's greatest secrets, which few people knew about. Even within the Extreme King, only those in high-up places knew it. That secret was like an insult to the Extreme King.

In the history of the Extreme King, an Extreme King's king became a puppet. Behind all that was a god known as Sky Armor.

There were a few Extreme King kings who became a puppet that fell under its control. Although only the high-up members of the Extreme King knew about Sky Armor God, to the Extreme King, it was the most humiliating thing there was in the Extreme King's history.

That was until Knife King was born. He was born in space. One slash could break nine tiers of the sky. He was able to break Sky Armor God and allow the Extreme King to escape the god's control and avoid being humiliated further.

Because he was injured too much in his fight, Knife King's lifespan was damaged badly. He became the Extreme King king with the shortest reign.

The Extreme King did not want to reveal this humiliating history, so Knife King's reputation in the Extreme King was very high. But outsiders did not know him. Much more was known about the other kings.
