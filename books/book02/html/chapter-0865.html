    <p>Silver-Blood Macaque: Shapeshifting Beast Soul</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had finally received a new shapeshifting beast soul. With these
      buffs, Han Sen could definitely go up against super creatures, and perhaps
      things that were even stronger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he couldn&#8217;t allow Moment Queen to help him out anymore,
      fearing she might try something else or even self-destruct, the
      Silver-Blood Macaque would make up for her absence in battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Death Knell and Spirit Owl had also finished evolving by now, becoming
      super pets that could fight. His team would be stronger than ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen now had Little Angel, Death Knell, Spirit Owl, Little Silver,
      Little Fairy, and Wang Yuhang. With such a team, Han Sen believed it was
      possible to take down Devil-Blood Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Big Black, Small Black, and Little White stayed behind to defend Moment
      Shelter while they were gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without delay, Han Sen brought Wang Yuhang right to the front gate of
      Devil-Blood Shelter. On this day, they weren&#8217;t going to spend time
      trying to lure some of the residents away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spirit Owl flew high in the air and summoned an army of rats to assault
      the shelter. Each rat was sacred-blood in strength, and they ran in like a
      vermintide for boorish reconnaissance.
    </p>

    <p>
      And just as Han Sen had deduced, the Devil-Blood King only had six super
      creatures left in his company. Han Sen and Wang Yuhang entered the shelter
      with the goal of killing the super creatures, first and foremost. They
      weren&#8217;t going to take out the spirit and his spirit stone just yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox and Little Fairy were loosed, while Spirit Owl and Little
      Angel each picked themselves a target.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen caught sight of a wolf-like super creature. Han Sen&#8217;s eyes
      gleamed with silver, and when they did, Han Sen transformed into a
      three-meter-tall silver ape. Holding his Flaming Rex Spike, Han Sen spared
      no time in swinging it down on the wolf&#8217;s head.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The super creature collapsed on the ground after Han Sen&#8217;s attack.
      In one swing, its head had been smashed in. The skull had been skinned and
      half-shattered, exposing a bleeding brain on the inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      The increase in power Han Sen had received was incredible to behold, and
      the thrill of unleashing it almost made him scream to the sky in delight.
      He picked up the Flaming Rex Spike in one hand, and the fallen super
      creature in the other. He tossed the super creature into the air and,
      while it was airborne, used his rex spike to beat it repeatedly. The wolf
      had no chance to fight back against such brutality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another super creature then went to fight Han Sen. In response to this,
      Han Sen pointed his finger and summoned Death Knell. The blue bell became
      a big bell, and with its bottom like a hungry maw, it set itself down upon
      the incoming creature. The super creature was then trapped beneath the
      bell like a spider in a glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      From inside the bell, the clapper went wild. Amidst the tolls and scraping
      of nails against its hard interior, the super creature was going mad in
      its bid to escape. Alas, there was nothing it could do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was no longer affected by the noise, but it did disturb the wolf
      creature. Grabbing the lifeless body of the wolf by its wretched wounds,
      he pulled the wolf apart with his massive simian arms.
    </p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King suddenly popped up from Han Sen&#8217;s shadow. He
      tried to strike at Han Sen&#8217;s back with his claw-like fingernails,
      but Han Sen was ready. He fought back with Sonic-Thunder Punch, and when
      his fist collided with the Devil-Blood King, the silver sunlight went
      supernova. The strike against the Devil-Blood King&#8217;s talons was
      tremendous, and it sent the spirit spiralling backwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was overjoyed at this result, and without reprieve, moved in to
      perform the same skill again. And then he did it again and again and again
      without pause. The shelter was washed with a blinding white light from the
      repeated explosions of Han Sen&#8217;s silver suns. The shadows all around
      were either dispersed or made faint, prohibiting the Devil-Blood King from
      melding into them to travel and escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the vitality boost given to him by the Silver-Blood Macaque,
      Sonic-Thunder Punch no longer drained his energy as it used to. Without
      getting weak, he could continue swinging his fist as a Sonic-Thunder Punch
      without delay, over and over like any average punch. The Devil-Blood King
      could do little but try to fall back, as lightning crackled and sparked
      all across him.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen punched his face, and when he did, the Devil-Blood King was thrown
      into the air. Then he punched his belly, and the Devil-Blood King was sent
      flying away a few hundred meters, striking the gate wall and making it
      crumble.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blood spilled from the Devil-Blood King, and he turned black as charcoal
      with the lasting electricity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ignoring him for now, Han Sen turned his attention elsewhere. He saw the
      silver fox in a fight of its own, and it had managed to paralyze its
      opponent. Running over there to help out, he brought down a Sonic-Thunder
      Punch on the stunned creature&#8217;s head.
    </p>

    <p>
      Silver sunlight blasted out of every orifice of the super creature, and a
      little later, its belly exploded from the heat. Lightning and blood were
      everywhere, and a second later, it was pronounced dead.
    </p>

    <blockquote>

        Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt pretty awesome at this point. The raging silver ape body he
      now possessed moved fast, and he had managed to effortlessly beat back the
      Devil-Blood King and slay super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hadn&#8217;t had a good, easy fight like this in a while. Wang
      Yuhang, on the other hand, wasn&#8217;t sure how to compose his thoughts.
      He was frozen by what he saw. When they first came to this place, Han Sen
      valued his help and needed it a good deal, especially with pulling
      creatures away. But now, in a short amount of time, Han Sen had reached a
      point where he was the one chasing the super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is sickening,&#8221; Wang Yuhang thought to himself, unable to
      believe there was nothing he could do to help right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The six super creatures were soon killed. Two of them were
      second-generations, but none of them provided beast souls. That might have
      been a consequence of Wang Yuhang&#8217;s presence, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King screamed as he suffered one last hack from Little
      Angel&#8217;s greatsword. When she brought down her sword that one last
      time, it hewed the head off Devil-Blood King&#8217;s shoulders and sent
      him back to his spirit stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go and look for the Spirit Hall,&#8221; Han Sen told the Spirit
      Owl.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spirit Owl made a noise not unlike a baby. And from below the Spirit Owl,
      a legion of rats followed and spread out like a tide in search of the
      hall. Within ten minutes, they had found it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was through a small hole, hidden inside a palace. When Han Sen reached
      the hall, he saw something strange on the spirit stone. He promptly bent
      to pick it up.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit stone shone black and red, and then blew up in Han Sen&#8217;s
      hand into nothing but dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I failed.&#8221; Han Sen had a wry smile, for this was the first
      time he ever failed capturing a spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, he was now in possession of Devil-Blood Shelter. It was a decent
      reward, and when factoring in the two second-generation Life Geno Essences
      he had also obtained, he felt satisfied.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two essences gave him fourteen super geno points, bringing his total
      up to ninety-two. He was only one step away from maxing it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gave a thunder-element Life Geno Essence to the silver fox, and it
      was happy. The same could not be said for the fairy, however. There were
      no water-element Life Geno Essences to be obtained, and she was a little
      grumpy in her disappointment.
