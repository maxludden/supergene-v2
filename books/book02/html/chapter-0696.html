    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, I was trying to help you.&#8221; Han Sen smiled at Philip.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Philip looked troubled and said, &#8220;I wanted to take her away from
      Devil&#8217;s Mountain. I wasn&#8217;t interested in this woman at all,
      but after what you have done, if you do not stay, I will be in trouble
      when she wakes up.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You want to hand me over to her?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Philip.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course not; you were just helping me, after all.&#8221; Philip
      ground his teeth and continued to say, &#8220;You should just go.
      Don&#8217;t mention our encounter to anyone else and do your best to stay
      out of this woman&#8217;s sight in the future.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen shrugged his shoulders and resumed his journey towards the canyon.
      Han Sen helped Philip, due to him being a partner of the Goddess Shelter.
      He never expected this to happen. He was trying to do good, despite the
      negative result.
    </p>

    <p>
      Philip held the woman in his arms and walked away with the intent of
      leaving the mountain, but after a few steps, he stopped. He turned to look
      at Han Sen, who was on his way into the canyon, and suddenly became very
      curious. Anyone who was willing to enter this place alone had to be quite
      powerful, and this intrigue led him to want to know exactly how powerful
      this person he met was.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen entered the canyon, numerous butterflies madly fluttered
      their way towards him from every direction. Philip knew these butterflies
      and knew that some of them were mutant-class.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man in golden armor did not hesitate, however. He continued walking,
      paying no heed to the butterflies that now clung to his body. Strangely,
      he just allowed them to be on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was like the butterflies were playing around him, and it made for quite
      a lovely picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Philip was shocked at what he was seeing, and his jaw dropped. It remained
      open for quite some time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The butterflies were poisonous, besides the fact that they were
      mutant-class. If you were bitten by them or dusted with the poisonous
      powder the wings carried, you&#8217;d fall incredibly ill. Even Philip
      would not dare venture into the canyon, with those butterflies about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there the man went, not caring about the toxic butterflies all around
      him. He allowed them to hang on him or fly around. But the butterflies
      didn&#8217;t bite through his armor, nor did they poison him. It was
      shocking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, from out of a light that encompassed a particular bush, a white
      butterfly appeared. It approached the gold shadow, which shocked Philip
      and caused him to say aloud, &#8220;Careful, my friend! That is a
      sacred-blood class ghost butterfly. If you get poisoned, your body will
      rot until there is nothing left but fizzled bones.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The man seemed to hear what he said, as he turned around and nodded back
      in Philip&#8217;s direction. The sacred-blood ghost butterfly was already
      floating around Han Sen, however. It was indeed like a ghost.
    </p>

    <p>
      The White-Ghost Butterfly&#8217;s body was strange, and it was how it
      received its namesake. Even elites who could attack with blistering speed
      had trouble striking this white ghost.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white ghost was going to land on the golden man, but he then quickly
      raised his right hand and trapped the White-Ghost Butterfly between his
      fingers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The butterfly fluttered its wings repeatedly, attempting to escape his
      fingers. The fingers were like prison bars, and despite its desperate
      struggle for escape, it could not free itself.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The man clenched his hand into a fist and the scary white butterfly was
      crushed inside, its blood seeping from his palm.
    </p>

    <p>
      A scary White-Ghost Butterfly was crushed in an instant and he was not
      poisoned, at all. With no delay, he continued his descent through the
      canyon. His body was still a post for numerous butterflies, however, and
      he continued to allow them to just land on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beneath the morning light, between the vetivers, the butterflies trailed
      the gold shadow on its travel. Philip was frozen whilst watching all this.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This man cannot be Dollar, can he?&#8221; The gold shadow
      disappeared out of sight, which prompted Philip to snap out of his daze
      and react. When this thought entered his head, he couldn&#8217;t help but
      speak it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the man was already long gone, and it was too late for Philip to ask.
      He spoke to himself again, saying, &#8220;Drat! I should have asked him
      his name again; perhaps he really is Dollar!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason Philip did not ask for his name again was to protect the man.
      If Xu Yuan asked about him when she awoke, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to
      tell her anything about himâ€”and that would be the truth! He didn&#8217;t
      even see the person&#8217;s face, so he had very little to go on. It would
      have been better that way, so that was why he did not ask again.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now Philip regretted his decision. He liked watching Dollar fight a
      lot, and he always dreamed of meeting him. He very well could have been
      Dollar, and if he had let the opportunity of meeting him pass him by,
      he&#8217;d be depressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he wanted to go deeper into the canyon and ask the person whether
      or not he was Dollar, seeing Xu Yuan unconscious in his arms, he gave up
      the idea. He couldn&#8217;t venture in there while carrying a passed-out
      woman.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was very happy right now. He had managed to squeeze the white
      ghost to death in his hand and heard the charming, oh-so familiar voice
      call out to him.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Sacred-Blood Creature Hunted: White-Ghost Butterfly. The Beast
        Soul Has Not Been Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric
        Amount Of Mutant Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Although he did not receive its beast soul, Han Sen was still quite happy.
      The butterfly was so small, he could gobble it down in one or two bites.
      He had the chance of increasing his sacred geno points a lot with these
      things, as the massive monsters he generally tended to go for could often
      take a whole month to eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was not worried about the poison that coated the White-Ghost
      Butterfly&#8217;s body. A poison like that could not harm his body, which
      possessed Jadeskin and the Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eating a raw butterfly like this, however, would not have sat well in his
      tummy. So, he found a nice little alcove in the canyon to rest in. He
      started a fire and began cooking the butterfly with oil. He added some
      spices, and the end result smelled pretty good. It was like a dish from
      another planet, which he called &#8220;Fried Silkworm.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is very nutritious.&#8221; Han Sen had lived here for a very
      long time and no longer felt disgusted eating such things. He munched on
      the white butterfly with glee.
    </p>

    <p>
      It tasted pretty good, particularly after the voice that told him of his
      increase in sacred geno points. The gross feeling of dining on a bug
      quickly evaporated.
    </p>

    <p>
      After eating the butterfly, his sacred geno points number raised by six.
      This meant his total of sacred geno points had reached 72, and it
      wasn&#8217;t far from maxing out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I could find small sacred-blood creatures like this more often,
      I&#8217;d have already maxed out my number.&#8221; Han Sen felt pretty bad
      right now, as he used to spend at least half a month dining on the massive
      sacred-blood creatures he killed, in the absence of smaller ones. It was
      often all for one single sacred geno point, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      But right now, Han Sen was mostly glad he could just absorb Life Geno
      essences from super creatures. Otherwise, due to their enormous size, they
      would have taken forever to eat. He pondered whether or not he could eat
      an entire one in half a year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen packed his stuff and continued to travel. Then, he suddenly heard
      a strange noise coming from beyond a canyon wall. It sounded as if
      something was digging through the rock.
