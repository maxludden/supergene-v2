    <p>
      The subterranean bamboo forest was enormous, but it had no stone pillar or
      significant stalagmites to support it. Supporting this humongous cavern
      was the bamboo itself, as the countless bamboo shoots rose from the ground
      and supported the ceiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had traveled thirty miles through this subterranean kingdom, but
      he had yet to see an end. It looked mostly the same, as well; the only
      difference he noticeed was in the temperature. The deeper he went, the
      lower the temperature seemed to tick.
    </p>

    <p>
      The thickets of black bamboo all around him grew denser, and after another
      fifty miles, the bamboo stalks were as thick as the trunks of trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frost covered the ground and the temperature had dropped to what would be
      an insufferable level for most people. Han Sen proceeded, unfazed and
      unchilled, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he ventured into a wholly
      ice-veiled area. The bamboo there was thicker than ever, and it would take
      three grown men, with their arms outstretched, to circle just one shoot.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If there are Dark Silkworms in here, I wonder how big they
      are?&#8221; Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to investigate but could not
      see through the black bamboo to tell whether or not there were silkworms
      inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deeper in this wondrous bamboo forest, however, Han Sen managed to detect
      one particular lifeforce. This force was like a babbling brook of spring
      water, and he was curious what manner of creature would possess such an
      enticing lifeforce.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen approached it with moderate alertness and strode through the
      bamboo forest with a little more care and caution. He came across an empty
      meadow amidst the bamboo shoots.
    </p>

    <p>
      The meadow was skirted by the thick bamboo, but not a single one of the
      shoots grew atop the field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite possessing Jadeskin, this frosty area and the icy lifeforce that
      swirled around it had Han Sen shivering with the cold. The energy he had
      followed was strange, indeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he drew closer to the sparse meadow, Han Sen&#8217;s eyes remained
      fixed upon it in deep observation and contemplation. It was thickly iced
      and in the center was a chilly—but not totally frozen—lake. In the lake, a
      plant that looked like a narcissus rested. The flowers were white.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had seen his fair share of strange flora before, and although the
      narcissus was strange to see there, it didn&#8217;t stand out or even
      unnerve him.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there was a super creature guarding the narcissus, Han Sen would be
      glad.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that wasn&#8217;t so, as he couldn&#8217;t espy the presence of any
      super creatures around the lake. What Han Sen did see, however, was a man
      sitting beside the still waters. He stared at the narcissus without
      moving, and this surprised Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could tell that he was a human due to his attire; he was wearing a
      human battlesuit. Creatures and spirits wouldn&#8217;t wear what this man
      was currently geared in.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why are there other people here?&#8221; Han Sen used dongxuan aura
      to observe the fellow and the results surprised him. He had quite the
      lifeforce, one that was far from weak.
    </p>

    <p>
      This place having an actual living person surprised Han Sen, as he
      believed himself to be the first person to ever set foot here. After all,
      the only entrance he knew of was the one that the twin-tail scorpion had
      made. But it wasn&#8217;t as if he had reached the end of this place, and
      perhaps further ahead was another more accessible entrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, what is your name?&#8221; Han Sen carefully walked across
      the ice and tried greeting the man.
    </p>

    <p>
      Provided there was no conflict of interest, Han Sen was not willing to
      make another enemy. After all, meeting others of the same kind in a place
      such as the Black Desert was a delightful thing. And even a simple
      correspondence or dialogue with someone of your own kind was nice enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man did not respond to Han Sen, though, and it looked as if he was
      sleeping. Of course, Han Sen couldn&#8217;t properly tell, as the man was
      facing away from him and toward the narcissus. His position was set to
      suggest he had been observing them, but with his back towards Han Sen, he
      couldn&#8217;t quite be sure. Neither could he wholly deduce what the
      person looked like.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, I come without cause for alarm. I mean you no harm and have
      found myself wandering here of my own accord and curiosity. Would you like
      to have a chat? If not, I&#8217;ll be happy to move along.&#8221; Han Sen
      continued talking as he approached the man.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, there was no response. He didn&#8217;t turn around or give any
      reaction. All he did was continue gazing at the narcissus in the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued his approach, despite the lack of engagement from the
      other person. By now, it was starting to be a little unnerving, and Han
      Sen felt as if something wasn&#8217;t quite right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen got closer but did not go near the man. He didn&#8217;t approach
      him head on, and instead walked around him a bit, so he could get a look
      at him from the side.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he saw him more clearly, Han Sen was shocked—it wasn&#8217;t a living
      man. The man&#8217;s clothing was fine, but the body inside had been
      frozen solid. It was like an ice statue.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact that only his flesh had been frozen was strange, indeed. His
      clothing didn&#8217;t even have a speck of frost upon them. Also, he did
      not understand why the lifeforce inside him seemed to swirl and suggest
      that he was a living person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face quickly became grim. The man before him wore a
      battlesuit, but its model was something that hailed from the previous
      century. It seemed to be a relic from over a hundred years ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How can this man be frozen here? Is he dead or alive?&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s heart had been given a shock, and as he inspected the person,
      he noticed something in his pocket.
    </p>

    <p>
      Judging from its shape, it appeared to be a notebook or wallet. Han Sen
      came a little closer and attempted to take it out of the pocket, as he was
      direly interested in a clue that would tell him who this person was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen&#8217;s heart leapt inside his chest and the silver fox
      on his shoulder stood up in alarm. Its hair was all standing up, and it
      made grunts of caution towards the water of the lake.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen retreated without falter and stared at the frosty lake.</p>

    <p>Splash!</p>

    <p>
      The water in the lake suddenly arose into a thousand airborne threads—with
      Han Sen as the target.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen attempted to evade them, but the crystal threads were faster than
      Han Sen was. He summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and swung it towards the
      crystal threads that came towards him.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The Flaming Rex Spike smacked against the threads like burning charcoal
      tossed into water. Many of the icy threads evaporated into steam, but
      there were too many, and they came from every direction. They quickly
      wrapped around Han Sen and became entangled like a spider web.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if a frosty air was beginning to invade his body. There
      were too many threads, and no matter how much he swung his Flaming Rex
      Spike, the threads he smacked weren&#8217;t enough. More and more threads
      wreathed their way around him, draining him of warmth.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t long before the threads had wrapped him up completely,
      encasing him in a cocoon of sorts. His hands were tied up and he could no
      longer lash out with the Flaming Rex Spike.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox wasn&#8217;t doing very well, either. He kept blasting the
      threads with his silver lightning as much as he could. It did nothing to
      end their unceasing advance.
