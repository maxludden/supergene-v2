    <p>
      Han Sen was not worried at the thought that someone might come to steal
      his geno fruit. Mister Li, Old Qiu, Xu Yanmeng, Wang Zhao, and Zhong
      Sanxiao already had gemstone geno cores and would not need his geno fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Hezhi would need the sacred fruit Han Sen possessed, so it might not
      have come as an absolute surprise for him. And indeed, Hezhi had been
      waiting for this opportunity. He was a bit of an outsider himself, and he
      wasn’t closely associated with the others who were on the expedition,
      anyway. Now that he had caught Han Sen alone, it was his time to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at his metal wolf geno core and said, “You used this to get
      away?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hezhi said, “Yes. My geno core is called Ditto, and it can take on the
      form of any creature it wishes to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s a fairly brilliant geno core you have, but it’s a shame…” Han Sen
      stressed an exaggerated sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s a shame?” When Hezhi said that, the wolf slowly began to approach
      Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upgrading that geno core to the best it could be might yield some
      impressive results, but it’s a shame your ascension will come to an end
      here,” Han Sen said, his threat made clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was going to leave you alive after taking your spoils; I’ll take that
      as permission to silence you for good.” When Hezhi said this, the wolf
      immediately jumped towards Han Sen with its maw open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used his Gold Dragon Lock in response, immediately tying up the
      airborne wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wolf was quickly bound, and it dropped to the ground like a stone. It
      did its best to squirm free, but it was clearly having trouble.
    </p>
    <p>“You have a gold geno core?!” Hezhi’s face swiftly turned sour.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, but it’s no big deal,” Han Sen said.</p>
    <p>
      “Yeah… you’re right. It isn’t,” Hezhi suppressed the sudden flash of fear
      he had been stricken with, and he summoned a purple sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three-feet-long, and many strange writings had been inscribed
      across the length of its blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hezhi waved his sword, which sent beams of light shaped like the
      characters on the sword shooting towards Han Sen like a number of lasers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen opened up his Bulwark Umbrella to block the barrage of plasma
      rounds. All the lights exploded against the protective shielding of the
      umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had eaten a great many sacred geno fruits, so gold geno cores
      weren’t able to deal half as much damage now.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How have you managed to obtain so many gold geno cores?” Hezhi thought
      the umbrella was a gold geno core, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only bronze, but that spoke volumes about its efficiency. Han Sen
      did not respond, though; he simply summoned his Crystal Core and tossed
      the egg at the unsuspecting bandit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were lying this whole time. You are a liar; a big fat liar! You are a
      demigod with gold geno cores.” Hezhi was angered by his mistake, and he
      swung his sword towards the egg that was headed his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal egg was able to dodge each and every plasma round headed
      coming towards it, prompting Hezhi to swing his sword directly at it.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The sword beat the egg down to the ground, but it ricocheted off the floor
      at an even greater speed. It walloped his body with the might and
      swiftness of a bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been unable to dodge, and after it struck his leg like lightning,
      it bounced right back to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had become very proficient in wielding the egg, and when the egg
      was returned, Han Sen went back to wielding his umbrella. Then, he began
      walking forward towards Hezhi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling nothing occur when he was hit by the egg, Hezhi still possessed
      his confidence. He stepped forward, swinging more and more plasma rounds
      at Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light-bullets exploded in a haze of sparks against the umbrella,
      though, and he was still unable to deal damage to the opponent he once
      thought would be a cakewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hezhi gritted his teeth and continued trying to attack. But this time, Han
      Sen did not even use his umbrella. He simply stood where he was and let
      his foe try his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hezhi brought his sword down directly on Han Sen’s body, but the results
      astounded him. It did nothing, and the sword itself began to bend like
      rubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at his sword in disbelief, unable to grasp why this might have
      happened. So, next, Hezhi used his fist to strike Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again, Han Sen did not dodge. He simply stood where he was and allowed
      Hezhi to do his worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Hezhi’s fist came into contact with Han Sen’s skin, however,
      chills shot through his body, and cold sweat poured from his forehead. He
      watched as his own fist bent upwards against Han Sen, as if he was made of
      sponge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, like an eerie ghost, Han Sen reached out his hand towards his
      once-pompous opponent. Han Sen was too close, and with a futile reaction,
      Hezhi brought up his arm to deflect Han Sen’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen simply grabbed the man’s arms and ran his hand down to Hezhi’s
      clenched fist. Han Sen latched on and did not let go, as if he was sucking
      Hezhi’s soul dry.
    </p>
    <p>Sha!</p>
    <p>
      Hezhi’s body was delivered one strike, and then it shattered and crumbled
      into fertilizer for the wretched garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this occurred, the geno core was also destroyed. The sword he was
      wielding, however, dropped to the ground with a heavy clanging sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen swiftly moved to pick it up. It was a gold geno core, and Han Sen
      needed a replacement for his horn. He quickly pocketed it by placing it in
      his Sea of Soul.
    </p>
    <p>Just as Han Sen was about to turn and leave, he heard more sounds.</p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen turned to take a look at what lay ahead, a human-shaped tree
      was shambling its way over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is this thing alive?” Han Sen asked himself, as he stepped back in
      caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tree was not that strong, and it gave the illusion of being an
      ordinary plant like all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it came to a stop near the mound of dust on the ground that was once
      Hezhi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen realized the tree was coming for the man whose sequence structure
      he had just destroyed. The roots of the tree moved atop the mound of dust,
      and then, it all got absorbed.
