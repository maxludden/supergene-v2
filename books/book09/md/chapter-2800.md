  The Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was a forbidden place in the Extreme King’s realm. Even within the Extreme King, not many people received permission to enter.

Bai Wanjie was a crown prince, and he had only just recently earned the correct permission to go there. Of course, he knew what the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was, but he did not understand why Mister White would mention the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye. What did it have to do with the taming of a xenogeneic?

Mister White was not in a rush as he answered, “This xenogeneic is very special. It is a xenogeneic that was grown from a plant, but it has received special treatment. It even has a body. It is a born-deified with two extreme bodies. Its body structure and thinking are completely different. That is the reason normal mind control skills like Mister Yin used are inefficient.”

After pausing, Mister White went on to say, “From what I can tell, the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye is a true god eye that was left behind by the second ancestor. It has absolute order power. Use the absolute order power to govern the xenogeneic’s two extreme bodies. Then, all you will need is a simple mind-control talent to control his heart. You will not need anything like Ghost Head Fall.”

Bai Wanjie looked at Mister White and asked, “Will that really work?”

”

“I am just guessing, but I do not think the truth will differ much, ” Mister White quietly said. “There is one thing you must remember, though, Crown Prince.”

“Please tell me.” Bai Wanjie’s looked at Mister White with eyes as sharp as a sword. It was like he was attempting to see through his heart.

It was just as Mister White said. The Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye came from the Extreme King’s second ancestor. It was a true god eye when he became a true god. It was the best gene the second ancestor had. It had an unbelievable amount of power.

The second ancestor did not decide on heading to the geno hall. It left its true god eye with the Extreme King to suppress King Kingdom’s luck.

That was the very core of King Kingdom’s defensive systems. Its position was like Sky Palace’s Sky Eye. It was the item to control and determine the fate of an entire race. It was more important than any true god item, so it was something they could not afford to lose.

It was not just Mister White. Anyone who mentioned the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was put on alert. He never wanted anyone to make use of it.

“While you use the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye to split his two extreme bodies, do not rush the process, ” Mister White seriously said. “You need to be careful. Otherwise, something may backfire. Please remember that, Mister Crown Prince. If you decide to try this, do not rush it. If you do, there may be a disaster.”

“Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye is the very core of the Extreme King’s civilization,” Bai Wanjie said. “I cannot bring any other creature there. Is there another way?”

Mister White thought for a while and said, “It is not like there isn’t. I have heard the king has a King’s Book. It can split up many creatures in the universe. If you use that book, you can control that spirit.”

“The King’s Book has not been used by my father for a long time,” Bai Wanjie said. “He will not use it for a small spirit.”

“Then, there is nothing else I can do.” Mister White bowed and said, “King’s Kingdom has many elites. Perhaps you can ask others for a suggestion on what you might be able to do.”

“Thanks a lot, Mister White.” Bai Wanjie sent Mister White away.

The Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was very important, so Bai Wanjie did not believe the man right away. He asked a few other Extreme King deified elites for their opinions to see if there was anything they could do to control Han Sen. But it was just like Mister White said. There was nothing they could do to Han Sen. A butterfly class being that was good at using mind-control skills was unable to control Han Sen’s mind.

Bai Wanjie asked his uncle to come over. He still could not control Han Sen, so Mister White told his uncle about Mister White’s method. “Uncle, do you think Mister White’s method might actually work?”

“It seems as if it makes sense, but before we try it, I am not sure it is actually all that useful,” Nan Huai Kang quietly said.

“Do you think I can give it a go, Uncle?” Bai Wanjie asked.

The more powerful Han Sen was, the greater Bai Wanjie’s desire for control became. Back in the Space Garden, he saw the green light shoot into the sky. He thought the person that killed the god was still inside the Space Garden. Perhaps the god’s personality was still there in the Space Garden. It made Bai Wanjie want to claim the Space Garden all the more.

“It could be useful, but the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye is too important,” Nan Huai Kang said. “In case something happens, perhaps you should not use this on such a trivial matter. Even if you were the one to cause a mess with this, not even that would quell the fury of the king.”

Nan Huai Kang did not know Bai Wanjie wanted the Space Garden. Aside from the resources of the Space Garden, he also wanted the god’s personality that everyone else wanted.

Getting the god’s personality meant they could become god spirits. That was something true god elites could not even achieve. Bai Wanjie would not miss out on such an opportunity.

After sending Nan Huai Kang away, Bai Wanjie used many methods and all kinds of torture tools on Han Sen. No matter what he tried, he could not make Han Sen obey. That made him start to do something else.

Han Sen’s situation was bad. There was no doubt about that. He was injured all over. This time, he was getting tortured so much that his body was in agony. Even so, it was not enough to make him change his mind. Bai Wanjie was unable to discover a way to break Han Sen, who was still holding on non-stop. Han Sen was not going to divulge a thing. He knew Bai Wanjie wanted the Space Garden. He would not kill him before he found it.

Bai Wanjie looked at Han Sen with disdain. After being silent for so long, he suddenly turned off the supergravity suppression. He lifted Han Sen and departed the supergravity cabin.

He had thought about it day and night. He could no longer resist the temptation of the Space Garden and the possibility of finding the god’s personality. He wanted to take Han Sen to the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye and do what Mister White had told him to do.

Now, Han Sen was feeling terrible and thought, Where is Bai Wanjie taking me to? It looks like Mister White really didn’t recognize me. Otherwise, he would have reacted. He should have at least given me a hint if he did.

Bai Wanjie carried Han Sen the entire way. They went through many doors. Han Sen was shocked. He thought, I did not think his father’s bedroom has this much security. Where is he taking me?

Han Sen was a bit worried. After all, his body had not yet recovered. He was rather scared.

When Bai Wanjie stopped before a palace, he saw a familiar statue. That statue was the same as the one he saw in an Extreme King Pavilion. It was the second leader of the Extreme King.

This statue looked a little different from the statue of the Extreme King’s second ancestor he saw in the Extreme King Pavilion. The second ancestor’s statue on this palace’s platform was holding a scale. It made the whole statue look serious. It looked like everything had to be fair and square. It looked like a god, but it did not have the emotion to look at everybody.
