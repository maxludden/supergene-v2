<p>This was bad. Han Sen shoved the white whale to full
acceleration so they could get out of the Black Hole Spider’s
territory. The white whale’s engine labored so hard that it
released enormous clouds of smoke, but the white whale didn’t go
forward. It seemed to be being pulled back.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked behind them, and he saw the Black Hole Spider
spreading its jaws. Its open mouth was like a giant black hole. It
formed a vortex in space that sucked the white whale toward its
gaping maw.</p>
<p>“We are going to die! Who is going to save me? I don’t want to
die… I’m a virgin… I still haven’t gotten married…” Ning Yue sat on
the floor, holding Bao’er and sobbing.</p>
<p>All the pirates were in shock. They had heard about the Black
Hole Spider before. Even in the wild systems of chaos, the Black
Hole Spider was the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>Han Sen pushed the white whale to the max, but the white whale
was only being pulled back faster. The hull ground against the
fabric of space as it was pulled backward, spawning a flurry of
sparks.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>An unexpected asteroid suddenly slammed into the side of the
white whale. The white whale began to spin.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen had time to think, the white whale fell
completely into the grip of that black hole. It spun faster and
faster inside the black hole, and other small objects slammed into
the white whale. Each strike made a horrible sound. The pirates
rolled across the floor like a bunch of gourds.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to die!” Ning Yue was screaming with every
breath.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved fast. He shifted his feet as the white whale
rolled around. He kept himself balanced, using the Peacock King’s
soul robe. He was going to release a power of his own to get them
out of that space vortex.</p>
<p>Bao’er was jumping nimbly around the command deck, still holding
onto her big purple ginseng. That kind of shaking was unable to
affect her balance.</p>
<p>Little red bird stood on her shoulder. It kept looking
around.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Seconds later, the white whale fell out of the space vortex. It
landed on a black sea, and the big sea was in massive turmoil.</p>
<p>“What is this place? Why is there a sea?” Han Sen wondered. He
kept looking around. That black sea was so big that it looked
endless. Mist rose in all directions, so he couldn’t see very
far.</p>
<p>Batong! Batong!</p>
<p>Other things kept raining into that same sea. There were
asteroids, plants, the wreckage of ships, and even some
xenogeneics.</p>
<p>While Han Sen looked around in frozen silence, a planet even
came down. It fell into the black sea, and the waves that rolled
out from the impact sent the white whale flying. It kept rocked
violently across the big waves, and it was some time before the
ship stopped flipping.</p>
<p>Then, Han Sen saw something even scarier. As all of these
objects fell into the black water, they started to melt.</p>
<p>“Are we… inside the Black Hole Spider’s stomach?” Han Sen was
looking at the mountain-like asteroids that appeared to be melting
as he pondered the idea.</p>
<p>“Oh no! We are done for… We are being digested to become poopoo.
I don’t want to become poopoo.” Ning Yue sat on the floor,
crying.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Our ship isn’t being corroded.” Han Sen observed
the white whale’s hull. The ship was like a deified creature
itself, and so it wasn’t dissolving under the corrosive power of
the black water.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t know how long the white whale would last, so
he also knew he had to get out of there as fast as he could.</p>
<p>But that Black Hole Spider was too big. It had captured the
white whale merely by inhaling. Compared to the Black Hole Spider’s
size, the white whale was a tiny shred of meat.</p>
<p>Han Sen then realized that the Black Hole Spider hadn’t actually
been attacking them; they had simply picked a terrible time to try
to travel through the system. They had encountered the Black Hole
Spider just as it decided to eat lunch.</p>
<p>Based on what they could see through the mist, they knew that
the spider had ingested countless asteroids and more than a few
entire planets.</p>
<p>Han Sen regained control of the white whale and guided it up and
out of the big black sea. That dark water was probably the stomach
juices of the Black Hole Spider.</p>
<p>Han Sen drove the white whale, all the while dodging the falling
asteroids. He wanted to get as high as possible. If this was the
Black Hole Spider’s stomach, he should have been able to get out
via its esophagus.</p>
<p>After traveling through the mist for God knew how long, he was
unable to see any more asteroids falling. But he still couldn’t
find the esophagus.</p>
<p>“Is this really the Black Hole Spider’s stomach? It’s too big.
Are we in another dimension, perhaps?” Han Sen looked weirded-out
as he spoke to himself.</p>
<p>“We are dead!” Ning Yue cried.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu had a wry smile, and he said, “If I have guessed
things right, we are in the Black Hole Spider’s body. And this is
its stomach, or at least an organ that is similar to a stomach. The
Black Hole Spider has space powers. It is deified, and its space
powers extend through its body, as well. If we want to get out of
here, we have to figure out the space powers locking this place
down. If we don’t, we aren’t going to find a way out.”</p>
<p>“How do we break the space powers here?” Han Sen asked as he
glanced at Fang Qing Yu.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu smiled wryly again, and he said, “The only
information I have on the Black Hole Spider is what I’ve seen in
the Thousand Treasures Alliance’s database. I can try to guess what
we are going up against, but I won’t be able to break whatever it
is. I hope the white whale can last a while. Otherwise, we will all
be digested very soon.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything. He peered into the mist with his
Purple-Eye Butterfly, and he noticed that the mist was made of
substance chains formed of a space substance. The power of those
substance chains was twisting space into a closed loop with the
creature’s stomach. He would be unable to fly out through ordinary
means.</p>
<p>But he had to try, even if it didn’t work. None of them knew if
the white whale could withstand the corrosive juices and mist for
long. If they couldn’t get out, they were dead.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t turn on the white whale’s weapon systems because
using those weapon systems would pull valuable power away from the
energy reactor. The white whale didn’t have an infinite amount of
energy available for use at all times. If he used all the available
energy, he would be unable to fly.</p>
<p>“Little Red,” Han Sen said to the little red bird.</p>
<p>The little red bird seemed to know what Han Sen wanted. It
screamed and flew off of Bao’er’s shoulder. It became a fire
phoenix and flew out of the white whale. It spat fire at the
mist.</p>
<p>The red flames turned the space substances and substance chains
into dust. But when the space substance chains broke, faults opened
in space. It made reality very unstable around them. The little red
bird almost fell into the cracks, so he came back.</p>
<p>“So this is a space element deified xenogeneic.” Han Sen looked
gloomy. Space deified xenogeneics were scarier than he had
believed.</p>
