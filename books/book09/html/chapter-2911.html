<h2>Ghost Car</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2911</h3>

<p>This bird had four wings and was very big. Its feathers were
very long, especially those on its back. They were like a stream of
knives on the creature’s back, reminiscent of a waterfall.</p>
<p>It had nine small necks and nine bird heads. It looked like a
phoenix. Its small feathers were like small blades. It was very
white and very murderous.</p>
<p>This strange, murderous nine-headed bird emerged from the
rainbow. The two parts of the tablet were gone from the ground.
Rainbow rain poured down on the weird bird.</p>
<p>Its four wings flapped. Its knifelike feathers made
“katcha-katcha” noises. The sounds were like knives and swords
colliding against one another.</p>
<p>“This is the true god xenogeneic Ghost Car!” a primitive deified
screamed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He had heard the name of the Ghost Car
xenogeneic before. Some people said the Ghost Car had phoenix
blood. Some people said Ghost Car was a murderous bird, and
wherever it went, chaos followed in its wake.</p>
<p>That was not the reason Han Sen had heard of Ghost Car before.
In the legends, one of Sacred’s four holy beasts was Ghost Car.
That was where Han Sen had heard its name before.</p>
<p>In the legends, Ghost Car had black feathers. This one had white
feathers like knives. It was a stone element. It had absorbed Han
Sen’s Under the Sky Knife light, which was why it looked how it
did.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “This is a weird xenogeneic. I cut it in half,
yet it did not die. Instead, it turned into the Ghost Car
xenogeneic. What if I killed this thing again? Would it turn back
into a stone tablet?”</p>
<p>The Ghost Car flew around Han Sen. It did so three times before
stopping in front of him. It raised its head and squawked. Nine
voices broke the sky and universe. It was like 10,000 knives
moaning together.</p>
<p>After the scream, Ghost Car put away its four wings. Its body
and nine bird heads leaned forward. It was like it was obeying Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Can I bring this bird out of God Area?” Han Sen tried opening
the God Area door to take the Ghost Car outside of God Area.</p>
<p>Because ordinary creatures could only use their own God Area
door to enter the God Area, the creatures in God Area could not
open a God Area door to leave.</p>
<p>If Ghost Car was unable to leave the God Area with Han Sen, it
was pointless for Han Sen to keep it around.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not expect Ghost Car would follow him out of the God
Area door back to Space Garden.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it might be because Ghost Car absorbed Under the
Sky Knife power. It was very curious.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! Where did this murderous bird come from?” Upon
seeing Ghost Car, Wang Yuhang was shocked. Ghost Car stared at him
with raised feathers. It was scary. It was like a mountain of
knives.</p>
<p>“It is a pet I just claimed,” Han Sen said with a smile. “It
looks good, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Pet? What level?” Wang Yuhang stared at Ghost Car.</p>
<p>“True god,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You and your family get all of the luck in the world for
yourselves. You just went out there and came back with a true god
xenogeneic pet.” Wang Yuhang looked very envious and jealous.</p>
<p>“Come. Let me ride it and see what it feels like to ride a true
god.” Wang Yuhang got close to Ghost Car, which made Ghost Car mad.
Its knifelike feathers shone. Snow white knife lights were like a
galaxy rising upon him. It covered the sky, ground, and the
entirety of Space Garden.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang was frightened and fell back. He waved his hands and
said, “No, no, no. I was just joking with you. I would not dare
ride it.”</p>
<p>“Do not hurt people randomly,” Han Sen told Ghost Car. The knife
stream on Ghost Car retreated. The bird still angrily stared at
Wang Yuhang.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, this is a xenogeneic,” Han Sen said with a laugh.
“It is not a beast soul mount. You cannot just ride it.”</p>
<p>Bao’er and Ling’er were holding hands as they came running
forward. They looked at Ghost Car with curiosity. The Six-Eared
Macaque and Holy Baby were behind them. They arrived like
servants.</p>
<p>Bao’er pulled Ling’er next to Han Sen. She looked at Ghost Car.
“Dad? What is this bird, and why is it so ugly?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ghost Car and said, “I do not know what it is
called.”</p>
<p>Although its name was Ghost Car, it was a stone element that
merged with Han Sen’s Under the Sky Knife power. It was not the
true Ghost Car. Calling it Ghost Car, therefore, was not
appropriate.</p>
<p>“Call it Little Nine. I am going to pick fruit with Little
Sister. Tell Little Nine to take us there.” After speaking, Bao’er
pulled Ling’er with her and jumped toward Little Nine.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Little Nine was a true god xenogeneic and
could get very angry. If its anger were invoked, it would hurt
Bao’er and Ling’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to stop them, but the nine-headed bird, which had
been named Little Nine by Bao’er, put away its knifelike feathers.
It lowered its body and allowed Bao’er and Ling’er to climb atop
its neck and sit.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque and Holy Baby wanted to follow. Before
they could get close, Little Nine used its knifelike feathers to
threaten them. It also screamed from its nine heads.</p>
<p>“Little Nine, let’s go,” Bao’er said while patting it on the
head. “Take me and Ling’er to collect fruit.”</p>
<p>Little Nine flew into the sky. It seemed worried about Bao’er
and Ling’er not being comfortable, so Little Nine flew slowly and
kept its body balanced.</p>
<p>“How does that work?” Han Sen was frozen as he watched. He was
the one who claimed Little Nine, but Bao’er had been able to
commandeer it.</p>
<p>“It must be Little Nine knowing that Bao’er and Ling’er are my
daughters. They carry my blood. Hence, they listen… I am the
strongest…” Han Sen tried to comfort himself.</p>
<p>After thinking of that, Han Sen felt calmer.</p>
<p>Although Little Nine had been tamed by him, its identity was
still very weird. Han Sen did not trust the thing completely. He
would not leave it in Space Garden alone.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned on taking it outside of Space Garden so it could
fight for Space Garden. If Bao’er could control it, he did not need
to do that.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “The stone tablet was absorbed by Under the Sky
Knife power. The Ghost Car xenogeneic’s power has reached top-class
true god. I feel safer with it protecting Space Garden. Even if
people like Holy Pirate have a special power to sneak into Space
Garden, it can protect Space Garden during my absence. No one will
be able to do anything to it.”</p>
<p>Although it was a good thing to have Little Nine, Han Sen was
still annoyed that he had been unable to claim any more deified
xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>“Speaking of that, the true god materials are deified xenogeneic
genes, right? Am I able to eat them?” Han Sen wanted to do that,
but he forgot about it. Getting true god items was harder than
killing butterfly xenogeneics.</p>
