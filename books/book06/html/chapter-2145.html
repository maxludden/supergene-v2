<h3>Chapter 2145</h3>

<p>The host of metal rhinos moved down to the riverbank. They
eventually walked into the stream and began playing in the water
that looked a lot like mercury.</p>
<p>They had great, hulking metal bodies. They looked like they were
made from rough, dull steel, and their bodies were a stark contrast
to the glimmering silver river.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what the silver liquid in the river was, but
it was most certainly not water. The metal rhinos drank the silver
liquid freely, though, so there was a small chance that the liquid
was harmless.</p>
<p>While the rhinos drank and played, a rumbling noise began to
come from the forest. Many more metal creatures came down from the
mountains and emerged from the forests. They all went straight for
the river, and when they reached it, they began to drink from
it.</p>
<p>There were metal snakes that had to have been at least one
hundred meters long. There were silver-colored lions and centipedes
with a seemingly-infinite number of legs. There was a great variety
of metallic creatures, all headed for the river with an insatiable
thirst.</p>
<p>The metal creatures looked very scary. At first glance, they
appeared to be Duke or even King class monsters. For some reason,
though, there didn’t seem to be any hostility between the various
creatures. Many low-level metal creatures came forward to drink the
silver liquid alongside the more powerful ones.</p>
<p>“The metal creatures sure seem very friendly,” White Real said
with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Perhaps not.” Yuya summoned a pigeon-like xenogeneic. It came
out of his sleeve and flew towards the river. The bird xenogeneic
obviously wasn’t a creature that was native to Metal World.</p>
<p>A bronze body suddenly soared through the sky. The creature was
shaped something like a dragonfly, but it was made completely of
bronze. Its body was at least five meters long, and its bulging
eyes and mandibles made it look monstrous.</p>
<p>The bronze body flew past the river, and it snapped up the bird
xenogeneic that Yuya had released. It gobbled up the bird with just
a few seconds of chewing, feathers and all.</p>
<p>Everyone was frozen, and Yuya felt compelled to say, “It looks
like they are only friendly to other creatures that are native to
Metal World. Outsiders don’t receive the same treatment.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. Now, he really admired Yunyi. The creatures had
crossed over mountains and traversed forests to get there from all
around, but the minor place Yunyi had selected for camp was absent
of creatures.</p>
<p>Even if creatures did come close to their safe zone, they could
fall back into their cave and remain hidden. No one would be able
to find them there. It was a solid spot to establish camp.</p>
<p>Because there were too many powerful metal creatures nearby, Han
Sen set up a rota of shifts for the men to keep an eye on those
creatures. For now, no one was to travel.</p>
<p>Ten hours later, some of the metal creatures were still
occupying the river. The beasts kept coming and going. It seemed as
if it might have been the only river on the planet, and as a
result, everyone would eventually swing by to drink from it.</p>
<p>“Captain Han, come and take a look at this.” Han Sen was resting
when Yuya suddenly called him.</p>
<p>Han Sen got up and followed Yuya to the mouth of the cave and
peered cautiously outside. The metal creatures that were near the
river were starting to look nervous. They began staying out of the
liquid, visibly fearful of something.</p>
<p>Han Sen waited and watched a while, until eventually, a white
metal beast approached the river. Whenever the other creatures saw
it draw near, they avoided it. None were keen to step in its
way.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the white metal beast. It did not look very
big, probably about two meters long. But it was white and looked
like a mammoth.</p>
<p>That metal mammoth went right into the river and began sucking
up the silvery liquid with its snout. The other metal creatures
made sure to stay far away from the mammoth, all of them keeping a
vigilant eye on the beast. It looked as if they didn’t dare drink
the liquid while the mammoth did.</p>
<p>They waited until the mammoth was satisfied and left the area.
When it was gone, the average metal creatures returned to the river
and resumed drinking.</p>
<p>Seeing that mammoth walk back into the metal forest, Han Sen and
Yuya looked at each other and sighed. When the mammoth appeared,
they did not dare to even breathe. The last thing they wanted was
for that thing to find them.</p>
<p>The mammoth was very powerful. A Marquise wouldn’t be able to
deal with such a fiend.</p>
<p>“It looks like our situation is not very favorable. Only
Marquises can enter this place, and yet some of the creatures here
are King class? One mistake could leave all of us dead,” Yuya
said.</p>
<p>Yunyi nodded and said, “Those of the other races might be in
hiding, as well. We can wait for now, but it does seem as if the
metal creatures only emerge when the sky turns pink. Perhaps when
the magnetic storm returns to blue, the creatures will all
disappear again.”</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others thought that made perfect sense. There
was no need to rush their operation, either. They had to take their
time and figure things out, first and foremost.</p>
<p>They set up a series of shifts for watching the river. Over the
course of time, many different types of metal creatures came to
drink from the river.</p>
<p>There were other scary things like the mammoth, as well, which
was quite worrying for Han Sen’s team.</p>
<p>After eighty hours, the stream of metal creatures visiting the
river began to slow. And before long, the pink magnetic storm began
to change. An hour later, the lightning flashing across the sky
returned to blue. Things looked normal again.</p>
<p>Finally, the Marquises concluded that there were no more metal
creatures coming to the river. Han Sen sent out a few trackers to
explore the area.</p>
<p>The results were as expected, but it surprised them all the
same. The metal creatures that had appeared near the river were now
all gone. It was as if they had just vanished.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Have they turned invisible? Or are they just hiding away
someplace underground?” White Real asked with a strange look.</p>
<p>Yuya did not speak. They were all deep in thought. The Metal
World was strange, and they couldn’t come to much of a conclusion
until they learned a lot more.</p>
<p>While Han Sen and the others were thinking, someone approached
them from the direction of the mountain. When he reached the
perimeter they had established, he called out to them.</p>
<p>“I am Kahn of the Demon. Is your group from Sky Palace?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around carefully, but the only person he could
see was Kahn. He went forward to speak to the felon, taking Yuya
with him. “Kahn? What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“You are the leader of this team, Han Sen? Great! Since we’re
already friends, we can co-operate.” Kahn laughed.</p>
<p>“I don’t recall us ever having much in the way of co-operation,”
Han Sen responded coldly.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I don’t recall being chummy with you, either. But
right now, the Dragon, Buddha, and Destroyed are all working
together. If we don’t form some sort of alliance, they might come
after us in this dangerous place.” As he spoke, Kahn’s shoulders
slumped.</p>
<p>“Why should I believe you?” Han Sen did not move.</p>
<p>“We arrived here long before you did. I think you’ll be
interested in the information I possess.” Kahn smiled.</p>
