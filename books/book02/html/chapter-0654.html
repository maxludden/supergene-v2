    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the man with uncertain eyes, not sure whether he was
      being serious or if he was merely joining in with the jest. Seven billion
      was not a small amount, and generally, even the richest of people never
      carried such money around with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;For that price, are you certain?&#8221; Han Sen, still looking,
      asked the man.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course I am,&#8221; the man responded, with absolute confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Give me the money and I&#8217;ll sell them to you,&#8221; Han Sen
      said, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you really think I have seven billion in my pockets, at this
      very moment? Give me your communication number and when I return to the
      Alliance I will contact you and wire you the money,&#8221; the man said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Han Sen did not give the man his communication number,
      just his virtual community account number on Skynet, as a way for the man
      to find him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, both of them exited the shelter together. Back in the Alliance, they
      both logged into the virtual community and went to meet each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not believe there was such a loser out there with that much
      money. He found it staggering when the man immediately came and saw him
      in-game.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, might I have a word with you?&#8221; The guy had a peculiar
      face as he approached.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What? You don&#8217;t want to buy them anymore?&#8221; Han Sen was
      cracking up with laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No. Is that what you really think? I have a different proposition,
      that&#8217;s all. How about if I give you fifty million, you lend me the
      pets for no more than three days? I will return them to you in three days,
      without a single hair on their furry coats having been brought
      harm.&#8221; The man smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fifty million is petty pocket change. This sort of exchange would
      require at least one hundred million. But I can only loan you the black
      cat. The white pet is not up for grabs, by any means.&#8221; Han Sen
      immediately knew what the man was implying, so he tried his best not to
      laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I accept that. But, when we return to the shelter, you&#8217;ll
      have to play along,&#8221; the man told Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then agreed. Without wasting any time, the man sent Han Sen one
      hundred million and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy you dinner.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure. We can have dinner, but you have to promise me you&#8217;ll
      take care of the pet. I&#8217;ve had it for a very long time and I&#8217;m
      awfully fond of it,&#8221; Han Sen told him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, if you don&#8217;t believe that I, Lin Mei, will take good
      care of it, then believe in Lin Feng. He is my little brother. We have a
      contract together, so fear not.&#8221; Lin Mei patted his puffed-up chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lin Feng? Who?&#8221; Han Sen acted as if he didn&#8217;t know the
      person, with a puzzled look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You really don&#8217;t know who I am?&#8221; Lin Mei was genuinely
      surprised. But after a while, he smiled and said, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s
      fine if you don&#8217;t know me. Just know that I am a trustable fellow,
      okay?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you know Tang Zhenliu?&#8221; Han Sen had to ask, as the person
      before him really did look like Lin Feng.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course I know him. He&#8217;s my little brother&#8217;s best
      buddy; they even wear identical, matching pants together! They&#8217;re
      inseparable. Do you know him, too?&#8221; Lin Mei asked in return.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then we aren&#8217;t strangers. I am a good friend of Tang
      Zhenliu.&#8221; In Han Sen&#8217;s heart, however, he thought, &#8220;I
      can&#8217;t believe Lin Feng has a brother like this? I&#8217;m not sure
      if they&#8217;re real brothers, though. Or just cousins.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, isn&#8217;t that remarkable? Well, if that&#8217;s the case,
      how about you offer me a discount, on the account we have such
      ties?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No. Relations are relations, business is business,&#8221; Han Sen
      immediately rejected.
    </p>

    <p>
      They then discussed the details of their arrangements for the remainder of
      their time in the virtual community. After that, they returned to the
      shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      They both went to meet each other back where they first left off. When Lin
      Mei arrived, he was holding his big-boobied ladyfriend and had a
      displeased look. They approached Han Sen and Lin Mei said, &#8220;Hey,
      that&#8217;s not very fair. You said two for seven billion! Now
      you&#8217;re increasing the price even more?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am too fond of them to part with them so easily. If you&#8217;re
      still determined to buy them, the black one can be bought for seven
      billion. The little white fellow is not for sale.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, that matters very little to me. Money runs like tap water for
      me. Very well, I will accept the black one for seven billion. I will buy
      the white one for seven billion, as well. The only thing that concerns me
      is the happiness and contentment of my wife. I will spend as much as I
      must, to keep her smiling.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, darling! You are so wonderful!&#8221; The woman fawned and
      kissed Lin Mei.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I already told you; only the black one is for sale. This little
      white ruffian is mine alone.&#8221; Han Sen, in his little show, was
      adamant about only going for the sale of Meowth. Eventually, Lin Mei
      conceded and purchased it. The woman, while holding Meowth in her hands,
      was beaming with joy and didn&#8217;t complain at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ever since, a yarn was spun from the Devil&#8217;s Mountain. It was a tale
      that recited the desperate lengths a little man would go to please a
      woman. This sorry man was said to have bought a useless pet cat for the
      whopping sum of seven billion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, did you really sell that pet for the sum of seven
      billion?&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s mouth was wide open with disbelief as
      he looked at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He said he was from the Lin family. His name was Lin Mei; he said
      he was the big brother of Lin Feng. If you don&#8217;t know him, then he
      must be a liar,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lin Mei? That womanizer? It had crossed my mind as to which wretch
      could be a sorry enough loser to pay such a sum. It was him, eh?&#8221;
      Wang Yuhang now understood.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Lin family really has someone like that in their midst?&#8221;
      Han Sen was surprised to learn that Lin Mei was a genuine member of the
      Lin family, as he half-suspected he hadn&#8217;t been truthful about his
      identity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang nodded and said, &#8220;He is real, all right. He is Lin
      Feng&#8217;s cousin. He should be much older than him and of a comparable
      age to Lin Weiwei. Before Lin Weiwei became famous, this Lin Mei was
      renowned as a genius of sorts. It was short-lived, and a credit that only
      applied during his teenage years. Before long, he became addicted to the
      carnal pleasures of women and soon after, he was widely referred to as the
      greatest loser of the Lin family. His father, however, funds his every
      desire and as a result, Lin Mei is very rich. The figure of seven billion
      is little to him. I don&#8217;t stay current with what he gets up to
      anymore and he rarely shows up at familial events, anyway. It was nice to
      get a quick sneak-peek today.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A loser, huh?&#8221; Han Sen lifted his lips but didn&#8217;t say
      any more.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they continued walking down the street, a commotion of some sort seemed
      to be occurring further down. Many evolvers were running down towards the
      gate of the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang quickly started asking about what was going on, to which
      someone responded a powerful creature had emerged from the Devil&#8217;s
      Mountain and brought ruin to three different shelters. Now, it had come
      here. Lu Hui had issued a command, instigating his men to man rally for
      combat and halt the advance of the creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quickly, many evolvers amassed and marched in unison beyond the walls of
      the shelter, out to the trail the monster rampaged along.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lu Hui had already gotten there with his own little regiment, but they
      hadn&#8217;t started their attack yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If Lu Hui takes this threat so seriously, surely it must be a super
      creature,&#8221; Han Sen thought. Then, he turned to Wang Yuhang and told
      him, &#8220;We should go check it out, too.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      They exited town and when they reached the plains of battle, countless
      evolvers were gathering. There were also other people in their midst, who
      seemed to have arrived just so they could enjoy the coming spectacle and
      watch the battle with glee.
    </p>

    <p>
      After walking a dozen miles, they heard the trumpeting of a loud elephant.
      Han Sen said to himself, &#8220;Is that the White-Bone Elephant from the
      Devil&#8217;s Mountain?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The same thought coursed through Wang Yuhang&#8217;s mind. They both
      turned to look at each other, with a look fright on their faces. The
      White-Bone Elephant was far too terrifying a foe, and in one mouthful, it
      had gobbled up a berserk sacred-blood creature. It was undoubtedly a
      monster from the upper echelon of super creatures. With its hulking size,
      stopping its approach would be no small feat.
    </p>

    <p>
      They walked forward for another few miles before they saw it. A White-Bone
      Elephant was hastily marching down the trail, producing tremors with each
      step. The humans around it were like ants.
