  Han Sen looked at Yisha. They were confused. What was this thing? It was sort of like a treasure, but it wasn’t a treasure. It was sort of like a creature, but it wasn’t a creature.

The Jade Drum was a creature, but the Jade Drum was created naturally. It wasn’t something that was man-made. Words were scrawled across the little bell’s body, though, and that suggested it wasn’t a natural being.

“Okay, Big King. Why did you snatch us and bring us here?” Han Sen asked the bell.

Big King Bell rolled its eyes and jumped. He said, “What do you mean by ‘snatch’? I was saving you guys. Couldn’t you tell? Don’t talk big if you don’t know shit, kid.”

“You were saving us? How?” Han Sen looked at Big King Bell with confusion.

“Ugh, you guys don’t understand anything! And yet here you come, waltzing into the Holy Spirit Sea. You must have a death wish. If it wasn’t for me saving you guys, you two would have ended up like him. You know, with only bones left.” The bell jumped up to land atop the skeleton’s skull as it spoke.

“Who is he?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

He had originally thought that the skeleton was Big King Bell’s master, but now, that didn’t seem to be the case.

“Ha! This piece of garbage? How do you expect me to remember who he was? He was just another pawn, like a background extra in this tale.” Big King Bell proclaimed, lifting his lips in disdain.

Han Sen didn’t believe the bell. There was no way that an unimportant person would have been in charge of controlling a technological marvel like the white whale. Even if the man hadn’t been very powerful personally, he could have used the whale to hold his own against a deified being.

“How did he die?” Yisha asked Big King Bell.

Big King Bell rolled its eyes. “He thought that since he had this strange machine, he could cross the Holy Spirit Sea and take the Sacred Leader’s treasure. He had no idea of the power of the Holy Spirit Sea. This thing didn’t stand a chance of repelling the sea’s power. Not in the least. He died before he even made it to Holy Spirit Town. Only his bones remained.”

After that, Big King Bell jumped onto the control platform and cockily said, “But this thing was quite interesting, and so I decided to hold onto it as a keepsake.”

Han Sen knew Big King Bell was talking about the white whale. He looked at the skeleton and told Yisha, “This guy must have dived a long time ago. He didn’t get here recently.”

“What? Another creature was here?” Big King Bell asked before Yisha could respond. He seemed startled as he stared at Han Sen.

“Yeah, there’s a few of them.” Han Sen looked at Big King Bell and asked, “You came here, too. What is so strange about that?”

“Ha, I was here…” Big King Bell trailed off as a thought crossed his mind. He stopped talking.

“Here what?” Han Sen asked.

“Huh.” Big King Bell grunted and said, “That is none of your business. Don’t you have the relic with you? How were so many other creatures able to reach this place? Or is Under Overbearing now so old that people are reaching the palace through his mouth?”

Han Sen was shocked that Big King Bell knew he possessed the relic. This bell seemed to know things that it shouldn’t, so perhaps it was connected to the Sacred Leader’s treasure somehow.

“Let’s not waste our breath. Give me the relic, and when I open the holy town’s treasury, you will receive what you are owed.” Big King Bell hovered in the air before Han Sen as it spoke.

“You can have the relic, but I will have to see if you have what it takes.” Han Sen smiled.

“I was born deified. I have beaten billions of people in this universe. I am the strongest in the sky or on the land. Even the Sacred Leader, when he met with me, would refer to me as Big King Brother. Are you honestly trying to compete with me?” Big King Bell looked at Han Sen with actual surprise. He hadn’t expected Han Sen to be so ignorant.

“Big King Brother, even if you are so strong, you should demonstrate that strength. Otherwise, how am I honestly supposed to believe that you are as strong as you claim?” Han Sen put out his hands as he spoke.

“I pulled you guys in here on a whim. Wasn’t that enough? Do I have to kill you idiots to show you how strong I am?” Big King Bell looked at Han Sen coldly as he slowly rose higher into the air. He looked as if he was going to kill Han Sen.

“Big King Brother, it was a powerful demonstration when you grabbed us. But that isn’t enough to make us want to hand over the relic. Will you show me again? If you can convince us, I will give you the relic without argument.” Han Sen smiled at Big King Bell.

He thought that the Big King Bell was quite interesting, and that was an impetus for Han Sen to trash talk it.

The bronze bell had shielded them as it pulled them inside. But that was because they hadn’t been prepared for its sudden arrival. Yisha still hadn’t shown off her true strength, so Han Sen wasn’t worried about annoying the bell.

Big King Brother looked down on Han Sen with utter disdain. “Even a small fraction of my power would convince you to obey me, but I have way too many powerful geno arts. Let me think of a weaker one I can show you. Just in case my geno art is too strong, and I accidentally end up killing you all.”

Big King Bell spun in the air twice, looking as if he had made a decision. He jumped onto the control platform and punched a few buttons. The white whale then rose to the surface and opened its mouth. The front of the control room looked out through the white whale’s eyes, letting the operator see what was going on outside.

“Idiots! I am going to open your eyes to my power. I am going to show you the techniques of a real and invincible elite,” Big King Bell said. His body began to glow green and spin as it grew bigger and bigger.

The bell turned onto its side, aiming its opening out the white whale’s mouth. Then, they heard a loud chiming noise from the bell. A scary shockwave blasted out of the bell.

Boom!

The whole sea was cut in half by the bell’s sonic blast. The waters were parted down to the seafloor and all the way to the opposite shore of the ocean.

“Oh, d*mn! This guy really does have a lot of power.” Han Sen was frozen. Big King Bell’s power really did seem to exceed that of Yisha and Fox Queen.

Yisha looked shaken, too. The power that Big King Bell released was truly magnificent.

Holy Spirit Sea wasn’t just a vat of ordinary seawater, either. Yisha didn’t think she could split that much of it.

“So, how about that? Do you guys believe me now? Give me the relic at once! Follow me, before I decide that I don’t like you. If you do come, you guys will benefit greatly,” Big King Bell said to Han Sen with a lot of pride.

While they were talking, three shadows appeared above the sea. It was Fox Queen, Mister White, and Crime.

When Fox Queen saw the big white whale, she shook her fox tail. An invisible cord of power lashed around the white whale, and she lifted it out of the sea.

Big King Bell quickly leaped atop the platform and hit the buttons on the panels. The white whale opened its mouth and created a black hole, then sent a force of suction towards Fox Queen.

But Fox Queen’s hand tugged on the cord of power, binding the white whale’s mouth. The white whale was unable to open its maw, and so the black hole died inside it.

Han Sen was waiting to see how Big King Bell disposed of Fox Queen. If she was killed, they’d lose a dangerous enemy.

But when Han Sen turned around, he saw Big King Bell pulling out a big bag seemingly out of nowhere. The bell was going to flee out of the whale via the backdoor.

“Big King Brother, aren’t you going to kill her?” Han Sen asked with confusion.

“I am busy. I will let her live for now, but I will surely remember her. The next time I see her, I will blow some air at her to kill her,” Big King Bell said firmly. Then he left through the backdoor with his big bag in tow.

Han Sen and Yisha were frozen. They weren’t sure about how to react.
