<p>As Han Sen got closer to the candle, the cold air felt very
heavy. Even someone like Han Sen, who had a strong body, felt the
cold air penetrate him.</p>
<p>“Weird. This power does not seem to be a cold element.
Otherwise, Jadeskin should have been able to resist it. Now, the
cold air goes into my body, but Jadeskin does not react. It is not
just a cold element. It isn’t that simple.” Han Sen was more
interested in that half-burned candle.</p>
<p>The reverse Dongxuan Sutra ran on its own because it was a power
native to the universe of kingdoms. Unlike its counterpart, it
wasn’t going to be hampered by the rules that governed the
universe.</p>
<p>The reverse Dongxuan Sutra was different from the powers of the
primary Dongxuan Sutra. The main Dongxuan Sutra power came through
the Dongxuan Aura’s powers of analysis and inspection. The Dongxuan
Sutra did not need to analyze things either. It could just simulate
the powers of an opponent.</p>
<p>It was kind of like a copying machine. No matter what the
content was, it would just copy it.</p>
<p>If the main Dongxuan Sutra was a skill, then the reverse
Dongxuan Sutra was a violent skill.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power was suddenly swapped. It became the cold power,
which was practically the same. It was different from the main
Dongxuan Sutra. The reverse Dongxuan Sutra was violent, but it
could only be used after it had been transformed. One was not able
to witness the miracles inside it. Even though Han Sen was now
using a power that was the same as the candle, he had no idea what
kind of power it was.</p>
<p>Although that was enough, Han Sen’s power became just like that
of the half-burned candle. He suddenly felt like the dark was
starting to fade away. The cold air went away. The stone pavilion
was still the stone pavilion, and the candle was still the candle.
Han Sen still stood in the pavilion. It felt as if everything was
just a dream.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that this was not a dream. He still felt the
candle’s power, which was very scary.</p>
<p>It was different from before. The power started to get closer to
him. It was clearly because Han Sen’s power had changed. It thought
he was one of them, or it was getting closer because it sensed the
same power.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to get close to the candle, and the candle did not
deny him. The white, half-burned candle still burned with gold
fire. There was no longer a cold feeling from it. Beneath the
burning candlelight, Han Sen felt warm. It was like he was bathing
in fire. “Can you talk to me?” Han Sen walked in front of the stone
table to talk to the white half-burned candle.</p>
<p>The white candle was an unknown creature. Obviously, it could
not speak or think for itself. Yet, it shook its light to try and
communicate.</p>
<p>“Are you Mirror Moon?” Han Sen asked. He wasn’t sure if his
question would be answered.</p>
<p>The half-burned candle shook a little. It looked like a
confirmation.</p>
<p>“Do you know Moon God?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>The candle’s flame shivered a little. It clearly recognized Moon
God.</p>
<p>“Are you Moon God’s gene race?” Han Sen asked another
question.</p>
<p>This time, the candle’s flame jumped twice. Han Sen knew what
that meant. Clearly, it was not a gene race that belonged to Moon
God. If it jumped twice, it meant no.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes squinted as he asked, “Did Moon God try and take
you away?”</p>
<p>He saw the flames of the candle jump once, so Han Sen
immediately proceeded to ask, “Does that mean you did not want to
follow her?”</p>
<p>The candle’s light jumped. Han Sen was shocked. “It looks like
there is some truth to the legend after all. It was not that Moon
God did not want to take it with her. She just couldn’t take it
with her.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the candle and asked, “In that case, are you
willing to follow me?”.</p>
<p>He directly asked that question because there was no need to
beat around the bush. If Jadeskin did not react, that meant the
strange half-burned candle could not be used to reverse his
Jadeskin body.</p>
<p>It would have been great if he could take it with him. If he
couldn’t, he would not be missing out on much.</p>
<p>This time, the half-burned candle’s flame did not move. After a
while, it flickered once.</p>
<p>“That means you want to follow me,” Han Sen said with glee. The
candle, which was called Mirror Moon, was amazing. It would have
been excellent if he could take it with him. It would likely come
in handy at some point.</p>
<p>This time, the candlelight jumped extra fast. Despite that quick
flicker of the flame, the actual body of the candle itself did not
move an inch. It was rather strange.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt compelled to ask, “Can’t you move?”</p>
<p>The candle’s flame flickered one time and one time only. That
seemed to suggest Han Sen was indeed right in his clever deduction.
The gene race he was talking to was not able to move by itself. If
it needed to move, it would require a helping hand.</p>
<p>This was too weird. Gene races at Mirror Moon’s level had an
Annihilation God Spirit power, yet it could not move. That was very
hard to believe.</p>
<p>“It can’t talk or communicate. It cannot even move. What kind of
God Spirit gene race is this?” Han Sen looked at Mirror Moon
weirdly before asking, “Can I just use my hands to pick you
up?”</p>
<p>After receiving an answer, Han Sen put his hands around the
half-burned candle and picked it up.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen picked the candle up, he sensed darkness
ahead. He felt as if space and time around him had been twisted by
a strange power.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood where he was, looking ahead with caution. One
could not tell what sort of emotions he was feeling. It was like he
was seeing a ghost but was not scared.</p>
<p>“If I tell people what happened, no one will believe what I have
seen.” Han Sen held the candle with a wry smile.</p>
<p>He understood why the candle had a strong and cold presence.
That presence was not simply a cold power.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a closer look. He saw that the space above Jade Wall
City display many transparent, white ghosts flying. They were all
headed into the sky.</p>
<p>They weren’t just above Jade Wall City. All of space seemed to
be filled with transparent ghosts drifting off into the skies.</p>
<p>The spirits featured old people, young men, men, and women. It
looked like they all knew geno arts. Everyone was flying in that
direction.</p>
<p>This scene was incredibly beautiful. All the dead souls in the
universe were flying. It was indescribable how creepy and awesome
the scene was.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s vision focused on a giant god hall. The giant god hall
had four giant words on it.</p>
<p>“Geno hall?” Han Sen was shocked. “Does this mean the white,
transparent souls are the souls of creatures that are
reincarnating? Does that mean the geno hall is a place where the
two worlds can connect?”</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly put the candle back on the stone table. The
spirits and the geno hall instantly disappeared from the sky. When
he picked up the candle again, all of that was revealed again.</p>
<p>“This half-burned candle’s power is connected to the concept of
reincarnation.” Han Sen was shocked as he held the candle.</p>
