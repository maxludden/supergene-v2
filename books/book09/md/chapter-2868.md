Buddha had issues with resources and gene talents. Only Burning Lamp was deified, but his lifespan was almost gone. His ability to level up was practically over.

With a guy like that getting into the top 100, it made Han Sen wonder.

It was a shame that Han Sen did not read the complete geno god list fight. He only saw the fights that were about him. He did not notice Burning Lamp working his way into the top 100.

God looked at Han Sen’s rank and laughed. “The top 100 is not bad. Although it is starting a little low, fighting upwards will be fun.”

Han Sen pointed at the number 84 that displayed the name Burning Lamp and asked, “Have you seen this guy’s matches? How did he get into the top 100? As far as I know, he is just larva class.”

“He is not larva class. He is the same as you. He is butterfly.” God paused and said, “This Burning Lamp was quite interesting. His power was OK, but his lifespan is almost gone. His body is like a lamp that has almost run out of oil. He has managed to rely on one treasure to get here. Getting into the top 100 was due to his complete reliance on that treasure.”

“What treasure?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

“It was a knife with cause power,” God said. “It looked like a true god class treasure, but it was a bit weird. It looked like a race weapon, but it was not a race weapon.”

“Buddha has a true god class treasure?” Han Sen did not dare believe this.

“If he fights later, you’ll get a chance to watch and find out.” God shrugged his shoulders.

Han Sen did not say anything, but he had made his mind up. When the god list fights ended, he would go see Buddha. He was going to take back his knife blank, the true god class knife, and the rewards Burning Lamp Alpha would receive.

“When a man takes revenge, he takes back triple what was taken. He stole my knife blank… Wait… Knife blank… The treasure knife Burning Lamp possesses might have something to do with my knife blank. Han Sen suddenly thought of that.

The reason Han Sen did not think of that first was that he did not believe his knife blank could compose the base of a true

god treasure.

Now that he thought about it, it was too much of a coincidence.

No! I must take a look at Burning Lamp’s knife and see if it is my knife blank. Han Sen wanted to see Burning Lamp’s treasure knife, but Burning Lamp’s rank was too low. No one dared to challenge him, so he would not get a chance to see it.

What kind of crap rules did God decide on? That old man Burning Lamp is number 84. No, no way! Han Sen was not happy.

If Han Sen was going to challenge Burning Lamp, 84 was too low. It was not worth doing it.

There are 10 days left, anyway. Let’s just wait. Han Sen sat next to God and watched the ranked fights.

The first round of the ranked fights was for first place. Very High Leader challenged Golden Growler. It seemed as if he really wanted first place. Han Sen thought it must have been Very High Leader not stealing first place, which was why he was going to challenge it instead. “Out of Very High Leader and Golden Growler, which do you think is stronger?” Han Sen asked God. God said, “They are both deified elites. It is hard to tell. Anyone could win, but I’d put my money on Golden Growler.” “Why?” Hearing God support Golden Growler, Han Sen felt relieved.

“His blood is the best in the entire universe,” God said. “It is one of the strongest old bloods that has ever existed. Although Golden Growler’s blood is not pure, the power of his genes is almost as good as the pure blood. The blood of the Very High is not bad, but it is not as good. According to the theory of the advantages and disadvantages of innate genes, Golden Growler is better. But the advantages and disadvantages of one’s innate genes cannot decide everything. It still depends on their practice and performance. They have both reached the top, so whoever reigns supreme will still be up for debate.”

While they were discussing that, Golden Growler and Very High Leader were already atop the space battleground.

“We are starting with Golden Growler and Very High Leader? That is so exciting!” “Who do you think is stronger? Very High Leader or Golden Growler?”

“Of course, it will be Golden Growler. He swallowed Ancient Thunder God. He is absolutely invincible.”

“I think it will be Very High Leader. After all, he is the leader of the top race in the universe. Ordinary creatures will not be able to compare to him.”

The creatures in the universe were discussing the upcoming battle. The green-haired beast looked nervous and said, “Little Mountain Leader is too cocky. He selected first place right away. He should have chosen something lower to fight his way up.”

The woman did not agree. She shook her head and said, “That will just prove he is weak. If he needed to fight, he would have to fight like an invincible champion. That is how race should be.”

On the space battleground, the Very High Leader’s green clothes looked kind of fairy- and bone-like. The expression on the man’s face, however, was far too cold. It was like he existed outside the universe, independent of everything. His eyes displayed no emotion. He looked like an emotionless machine.

Golden Growler looked like he always did. He came from space. His body was full of gold hair. It was like he was made from gold silk.

“I have heard your race can swallow everything. You can eat gods and swallow phoenixes. From the old times, you are at the top of the food chain. It is very rare to find one still living.” Very High Leader was not joking around. The more powerful the creature, the more likely they were to destroy themselves. Things had always been that way. The race was invincible in ancient times, so it was rare for them still to have a bloodline continuing.

At that time, there were many great races wiped out from the annals of history. Even some of the weaker real dragons and phoenixes were hard to find in that day and age.

Hubris could fell the mightiest of creatures. Winning too much could lead to failure. It was the natural balance of the universe.

Golden Growler was not in the mood to talk about the rising and falling of civilizations. He opened his mouth like a lion that swallows the sky. He tried to swallow Very High Leader.

Suddenly, the whole of space was covered by Golden Growler’s big mouth. His mouth created a scary vortex that generated a very scary sucking power. Even true god class beings could not repel the force of the suction.

Ancient Thunder God was swallowed by Golden Growler this way. Right now, Golden Growler was doing the same trick. He was going to swallow Very High Leader too.

Very High Leader’s expression did not change. The power in his body did not change. It was like he had combined with the universe and space at large. He raised his hands like he was flipping the entire universe upside-down.

Golden Growler had his mouth wide open. He could swallow the sky, yet he somehow landed on Very High Leader’s hands.

It was not just Golden Growler either. Even the whole of space was landing in Very High Leader’s hand. Golden Growler was just a part of it.
