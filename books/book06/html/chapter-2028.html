<p>“This Infinite Buddha is a xenogeneic. It seems that there are
many xenogeneics amongst the Buddha.” Han Sen stared at Infinite
Buddha, but he didn’t move.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha looked like an angry King Kong. He put his hands
together, and then, lots of stars began to fly together and form
one large cluster.</p>
<p>As the power built, the stars became brighter and brighter.
Still, their sizes remained the same. And by the end, the stars
looked like miniature suns. They looked very scary.</p>
<p>“The Buddha’s Infinite Galaxy geno art is powerful, but it takes
too long to generate. Using it to attack Han Sen, who is not being
offensive, is a good idea,” Sharon said, with a laugh.</p>
<p>The Dragon lady also laughed, and she said, “This time, Han Sen
will have to move. No matter how powerful his Empty White Teeth is,
there’s still a limit. With Han Sen’s power, he won’t be able to
return Infinite Galaxy’s power.”</p>
<p>“Yup. Infinite Buddha has not struck yet, and he is still
generating power. Infinite Galaxy will only keep getting stronger.
Han Sen definitely won’t be able to return it, and trying to would
only lead to his body being destroyed,” said another person.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha’s face was dark with rage. His countenance was
scary to see. The power in his hands continued getting stronger, as
if there was no end to its power.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not strike, and the Buddha wasn’t ready to unleash
yet. He was going to generate enough of the Infinite Galaxy’s power
to secure a one-hit kill on Han Sen.</p>
<p>He didn’t care about the ways that Han Sen could be useful to
them. Killing Han Sen to maintain his pride was far more crucial to
him than letting Han Sen lead them somewhere. If he missed this
opportunity, he wouldn’t have another.</p>
<p>Infinite Galaxy was getting stronger. Han Sen looked grim. He
held his Blood Feather Knife and stared at the light in his
opponent’s hands. But still, he did not move.</p>
<p>“He is still not moving. He really wants to face the wrath of
Infinite Buddha’s Infinite Galaxy,” the Dragon lady said with
surprise.</p>
<p>“I am afraid he thinks he is able to,” Sharon laughed.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha’s hands were too bright for him to close now. He
was on the brink of losing control.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha shouted and pushed his hands towards Han Sen.
The light became a destructive wave that hurtled towards Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at the light, which looked like a compressed
galaxy. It contained an unbelievable amount of power. Not even a
top Marquise could face-off against it.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved his Blood Feather Knife and created another
circle. It was Empty White Teeth.</p>
<p>You cannot return the power possessed by Infinite Galaxy!”
Infinite Buddha roared. It looked like Han Sen’s behavior thus far
had humiliated him.</p>
<p>As Infinite Buddha roared, the light approached the knife
circle. It looked like a solar system bearing down on an ant. It
looked ready to explode. The knife circle was quivering, looking
likely to break.</p>
<p>“Let me give you some advice. Never use something you cannot
control,” Han Sen said quietly. Then, the power in his body was
unleashed. The power inside the knife circle was thrown back
towards Infinite Buddha.</p>
<p>“…Impossible…” Infinite Buddha was shocked. Facing that power,
he did not attempt to block it. Instead, he tried to run away.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The power slammed into a boulder sitting on the ground. The
shockwave was like a planet exploding. It destroyed everything
within a few hundred-meter radius.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha was unable to evade that explosion, and half of
his body was hurt badly. He was brought down to the ground,
bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>“Mister Sharon! Are you not going to attack?” Infinite Buddha
wanted to stop his wounds from bleeding, but the purple knife air
was spreading. It was ravaging his wounds.</p>
<p>Sharon looked at Infinite Buddha and said, “I would strike, but
in a capacity that has nothing to do with your own petty grievance
against Han Sen.”</p>
<p>“As long as you strike, the reason does not matter!” Infinite
Buddha screamed, looking frightened.</p>
<p>“It is a shame you are so badly hurt. And with the addition of
Teeth powers, I am afraid I cannot save your life,” Sharon said,
looking calmly upon him.</p>
<p>“That is fine. Just kill Han Sen!” Infinite Buddha said, while
coughing up blood.</p>
<p>His body could no longer keep the Teeth power down. In a few
seconds, he was torn to shreds as if in the maw of a beast. Blood
poured out of him as he died.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Star King Kong: xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>An announcement played in Han Sen’s head, but he knew he
couldn’t just go and take Infinite Buddha’s xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>A creature that looked like a white tiger moved over and swiftly
swallowed the corpse. The xenogeneic genes went with it. And then,
the creature stared at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Sharon looked at Han Sen with curiosity. “I did not believe that
you dueled and came to a draw with Lone Bamboo, but now I most
certainly do.”</p>
<p>“He tied with Lone Bamboo?” one of the other xenogeneics asked
in shock.</p>
<p>News in Sky Palace was buttoned down, but the Demons were not
friendly with Sky Palace. So, they gleaned as much information as
they could about things there. Sharon was the only one who knew
about Han Sen and Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>Sharon laughed and said, “During that exam, Lone Bamboo leveled
up to being a Marquise. He was disqualified from the Earl exam, so
there was no winner.”</p>
<p>“If this man can fight Lone Bamboo in such a way, then he is not
someone so simple.” The Dragon lady looked at Han Sen, now showing
a greater interest in him.</p>
<p>Sharon looked at Han Sen. “It is a shame you are not a Marquise.
Otherwise, I would very much like to fight you. Even if I gave you
time to heal, I’d still beat you. I don’t want to have to kill you
right now, so you’d best lead the way.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled. “I don’t have a good temper. It might be easy
for you to kill me, but even so, you won’t get me to lead.”</p>
<p>Sharon frowned. The Dragon lady laughed and said, “Then I shall
make a bet with you. If you beat me, we will let you go. And if you
lose, then you lead.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked, looking at the Dragon lady.</p>
