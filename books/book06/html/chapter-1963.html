<p>“Strange. All the gourds showed a reaction, but they didn’t give
out a holy aura. This is really strange.” Inside a building, a man
of the Sky race frowned as he looked upon Han Sen traversing the
Sky Road. He was in deep thought.</p>
<p>Everyone in Sky Palace showed a similar expression. They had
never seen a holy gourd react that way, and so no one knew what it
meant.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was talented, the holy gourd would provide him with a
holy aura. His potential was yet to be determined. Wherever he
went, the gourds did have a reaction, but it was one that yielded
nothing. It was very peculiar.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed. He thought he could go home by failing
under spectacular circumstances, but the Sky Road was nothing
special. It was like an ordinary bridge, really, except longer. It
also went upwards.</p>
<p>Han Sen stepped onto the main island, and then Thousand Feather
Crane rode his bird over towards him. Han Sen said to him, “That
gourd vine only shakes. Is it supposed to spook people into falling
off?”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane looked at him strangely, and said,
“Brother Han is talented. You have nothing to be afraid of. It is
getting late, and the leader awaits you. Let us be off!”</p>
<p>Han Sen followed him via the steps. They went between a vast
array of clouds, many of which had buildings situated upon them. It
was like he was in heaven.</p>
<p>The jade stone steps were going up high. When Han Sen finally
saw the end, he found himself looking at a grand palace. Ahead was
a large plaque that said, “Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>Han Sen walked up the stairs, one step at a time. Every step he
took felt heavier than the last. It was not that the stairs had
some trick to them, it was just that the Sky Palace looked so
intimidating. People below it would feel pressure going up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a feeling, either. There was an increased weight
upon his shoulders. The closer he got, the stronger it grew.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane kept watch over Han Sen.</p>
<p>The staircase to Sky Palace was called the Road to the Sky.
Those of the Sky race felt no particular sensation when they
climbed the stairs, but the outsiders that traversed those stairs
would feel a massive amount of pressure from Sky Palace. The
pressure came from the plaque that said Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The plaque was crafted by the first leader of Sky Palace. It had
the powers of Sky Palace Outer Sky. It suppressed all people.
People with a poor will would be greatly suppressed, and they would
not be able to reach Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Even people with strong wills would feel as if they were
marching through hell when they walked that road. Most of them
would feel exhausted as they climbed.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane kept watching Han Sen, just in case he
fell. If he did, Thousand Feather Crane would carry Han Sen to Sky
Palace. It was his job to guide him there.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been invited by the Sky Palace leader. He had
crossed the Sky Road, and so Thousand Feather Crane could not allow
him to be crushed by the Road to the Sky. And it would look poorly
if he ended up crawling in.</p>
<p>Not much later, he saw Han Sen frown. He paid more attention to
Han Sen, ready to help him if he collapsed. The first leader of Sky
Palace was powerful. A mere two words were enough to buckle most
people’s knees.</p>
<p>Normally, only Dukes could withstand the pressure and enter. Han
Sen was just a Viscount, so it would not be embarrassing for him to
be unable to keep his feet.</p>
<p>But only people who went through it the first time would suffer
this pressure. They wouldn’t feel it once they were past it, and
that was what was most amazing about the Road to the Sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and kept ascending the stairs. His pace was
ordinary, and there was no sign of him struggling. He looked at the
plaque that read Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen could discern the feelings elicited by the words, and he
understood how intimidating they were. It made him admire whoever
had left the words there.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not fight back with his will. He had come there to
practice, so he wasn’t there to cause issues. And the leader was
Yisha’s teacher. He didn’t want to embarrass himself, so he didn’t
fight it. He accepted the feelings the two words gave him.</p>
<p>Sky Palace feelings were strange. Han Sen felt as if he was
getting crushed. It was getting harder and harder to walk, and his
forehead eventually started to sweat.</p>
<p>Han Sen refused to fight against the feelings the words gave
him, but it was still very difficult to bear with them. If Han Sen
did not possess a great will of his own, he’d have been brought
down to the ground and made immobile.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane observed the beads of sweat on Han Sen,
and noted how it looked as if the man had just stepped out of the
water. He frowned.</p>
<p>They had only gone up one hundred steps, and yet, Han Sen
sheened in sweat. It was pretty extreme.</p>
<p>He was a Viscount, so there was no way he’d last one thousand
steps. But if Han Sen’s situation continued like that, he might not
even make it to the two hundredth step.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace is strong.” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not use his own will to try to break Sky Palace’s
will, but it was obviously very powerful for it to suppress him
like so. Han Sen did not know what to do.</p>
<p>Since Han Sen had decided not to fight back, he didn’t plan on
releasing the feeling. He accepted the pressure and just kept
going. It was so heavy, it was like he was carrying a mountain.
Every step he took left the stair behind him wet with sweat.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept feeling that pressure as he walked, and as he
pushed on, he learned something.</p>
<p>It was a pure feeling, and it did not come from Han Sen. The
intensity of the suppression began to give Han Sen some manner of
inspiration.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Aura’s power could only mask his senses. It didn’t
affect his body.</p>
<p>If Dongxuan Aura could be suppressed like so, the power would
reach another level.</p>
<p>As Han Sen kept walking, he loosened himself up. He allowed the
pressure to fall on him fully. He hoped to learn something from
those words.</p>
<p>It was getting harder and harder for Han Sen to walk. By the
time he reached the two hundredth step, he had to spend a lot of
power to take every step forward.</p>
<p>“Let me carry you.” Thousand Feather Crane saw Han Sen on the
verge of collapse, and so he resolved to help him.</p>
