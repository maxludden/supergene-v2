<h2>Searching for Treasure</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1772</h3>

<p>A swordmind itself did not have power, and you couldn’t kill
others with it. But a swordmind represented the extent of a
swordsman’s skill, and it showed how much their sword skills
connected with the earth. The more synergy a swordsman had with the
earth, the more powerful his skills would be when they were
unleashed.</p>
<p>Someone with a strong swordmind could make even common sword
skills incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not focused on the sword, but his swordmind was the
best. Although it had been achieved through luck, he tried hard to
practice with it, too.</p>
<p>One strike drew blood, and the second strike lopped off an arm.
The sword strike went for the soul.</p>
<p>Under Han Sen’s sword, Mister Elephant felt as if he could not
use his own powers to compete. It was as if he had been restricted,
and couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p>He could not block anything completely. All he could do was
watch his own blood cascade.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not strong enough to seriously injure Mister
Elephant, but the Pirate Bone Sword’s ice-like light managed to cut
open his enemy’s flesh and bone with ease.</p>
<p>Roar! White Elephant called angrily. Ignoring Old Turtle’s
strikes, he ran over to Mister Elephant. He wanted to save him,
since he was obviously in extreme danger.</p>
<p>But it was already too late. No one would have expected a Baron
to use such a frightening swordmind or such sophisticated sword
skills.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Mister Elephant’s head was sent arcing through the air. Han Sen
wasn’t going to stop to watch it, though. He held the Pirate Bone
Sword in one hand and picked up Hai’er with the other. Then, he
ran.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Xenogeneic Viscount Hunted; Xenogeneic Gene Found: Old Elephant
Man”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen ran ten meters and saw Mister Elephant’s head hit the
ground. Unfortunately, Han Sen had to leave the body behind; he did
not have the time to collect the xenogeneic materials.</p>
<p>White Elephant and Old Turtle squealed, racing into the forest
Han Sen kept on running, putting the sword next to Hai’er’s neck.
He shouted back to Old Turtle, “Old Turtle! Get that White
Elephant, or I’ll cut her head off.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t dare!” Old Turtle shouted in the common
language.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say a word, and he actually got ready to do the
deed.</p>
<p>“Stop! I promise!” Old Turtle screamed in panic.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bone Sword’s blade had been pressed against Hai’er’s
neck for a bit, nicking the skin to draw a few drops of blood. If
Old Turtle had answered any slower, Hai’er would have been
killed.</p>
<p>“Now!” Han Sen looked like he was about to cut her neck
again.</p>
<p>Old Turtle shouted and jumped in front of the White Elephant to
fight it.</p>
<p>“If I see you or the White Elephant, I will cut her head off.”
Han Sen put away the sword and ran into the woods along with
Hai’er.</p>
<p>Old Turtle was a little hesitant to do as instructed, but when
he tried to catch up, he could not find Han Sen. Not a trace of him
could be seen. It was like the two had just vanished into the
woods.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Aura was excellent when it came to hiding people.
Even Earl class xenogeneics would not be able to track them, when
they were out of direct sight.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed Hai’er and took her into a cave. Then, he lobbed
her onto the ground.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar! You are safe. I was worried about you.” Hai’er
looked so innocent. She looked at Han Sen with sincerity in her
eyes.</p>
<p>“It is a shame you didn’t choose to become an actress.” Han Sen
complimented her feint, then proceeded to ignore her. He just
reached out his hands, searching up and down her body.</p>
<p>Hai’er was someone special, that much he could tell. She must
have received something from Old Turtle, too. When he had grabbed
her back there, he hoped to threaten Old Turtle into helping him.
And not just that, but also so he could nab whatever treasure she
supposedly had.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, what are you doing? I am not an adult yet!”
Hai’er was on the floor, blushing like a shy lady.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen many hot women in his time, so he wouldn’t get
turned on by her.</p>
<p>Han Sen searched her body, trying to find the treasure.</p>
<p>Hai’er was evil, but she was just a woman. When Han Sen touched
her, she screamed, “Don’t touch me! I am of the Pirate. If you
disrespect me, the others of the Pirate will come after you. They
will slay your entire family.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I am the only one. Come after me whenever you want,” Han
Sen said coldly, before continuing to rummage through her
clothes.</p>
<p>Han Sen found a Toxic Fang Dagger, and then continued his
search.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, tell me what it is that you want and I will
give it to you.” Hai’er had tried things the hard way, so she
approached him from a more pitiable angle.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored her and kept searching.</p>
<p>“Asshole. Pervert. I’ll kill you. Slice you up like good
sashimi.” Hai’er squirmed and struggled, but Han Sen put a few
coins on her. She couldn’t move away. Han Sen was still searching,
so she shouted.</p>
<p>Hai’er had many items on her, but Han Sen could not tell which
was the treasure. He took it all, anyway. Aside from her clothes,
he claimed everything she possessed.</p>
<p>After the search, Han Sen looked at her to see if there was
anything missing.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked like a woman that had been bullied, and she weakly
said, “What are you doing? If you touch me any further, Big Pirate
Uncle won’t let you go. He will skin you alive!”</p>
<p>Hai’er looked very pitiable, and while it was very attractive,
Han Sen said coldly, “Don’t worry, I am not interested in a woman
with no boobs.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen turned around and left. He abandoned her in
the cave, all alone.</p>
<p>“You asshole! I won’t forget about this. If you had the balls
to, you’d kill me. Otherwise…” Hai’er looked at Han Sen as she
shouted. She had been humiliated and infuriated by the search.</p>
<p>Now, she was enraged. She had one sole treasure that kept her
safe, but it resided inside her body. Unfortunately, it was too
high class for her, and she could not control it just yet It only
worked when she was critically wounded.</p>
<p>She wanted to lure Han Sen into hurting her body and triggering
the item, so she could blow him into bits.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t do anything. All he did was rummage through
her things and leave. She was so mad that she thought she was going
to get a nosebleed.</p>
<p>Han Sen had earned a lot from his venture. Aside from Hai’er’s
treasures, he also got what he earned from Hawei and Nicai. He
found a few xenogeneic ingredients, too. It was pretty great.</p>
