<p>When Qin Bai heard what he said, he developed a wry smile and
replied, “It is very hard for me to leave the palace for any
duration of time. I always have to come up with excuses to leave
the palace and see you. Why would my father allow me to travel and
study with you?”</p>
<p>“Just give it a go,” Han Sen said with a smile. “Perhaps your
father might agree. By the way, when you ask your father, you can
tell him that Mister Jian is going too.” “I would not dare tell my
father something like that,” Qin Bai said with a sigh. “He is going
to say I am a loser.”</p>
<p>“If you give it a go, you might have a chance,” Han Sen said
with a tilt of his head. “You can never know anything unless you
try, so why not? I have given you the option. It is up to you if
you want to act on it.”</p>
<p>“What do you think the percentage of this working is?” Qin Bai
asked with a gnash of his teeth.</p>
<p>“I would say there is a 50% chance,” Han Sen casually said.
Whatever happened before always meant there was still a 50%
chance.</p>
<p>When Qin Bai heard that, he felt excited. “If there is a 50%
chance, I will risk getting told off. Let’s go give it a shot.”</p>
<p>After sending Qin Bai on his way, Han Sen returned to the
castle. He saw Bao’er playing with a wooden sword. It was the same
one Jian Bu Gu had given her.</p>
<p>“Did I not ask you to give it back to Mister Jian?” Han Sen
asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>Bao’er said, “Mister Jian said he didn’t need it. He said it was
a gift for me, so I don’t have to give it back.” Han Sen remained
silent. He then walked to Mister Jian’s room.</p>
<p>Han Sen knocked on the door. Mister Jian’s voice soon sounded
from beyond. “The door is not locked, so please come in.”</p>
<p>Han Sen pushed the door and went in. He saw Mister Jian was
holding a needle and stitching up clothes. He thought it was
weird.</p>
<p>He was the Qin Kingdom’s first elite. He was a person who could
use a sword mind to suppress a God Spirit. Strangely, he was now
looking like a family man.</p>
<p>“Please sit, Mister,” Mister Jian said. He kept fixing clothes
as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Mister Jian, I am planning a long-distance trip,” Han Sen said
with seriousness. “Would you be willing to come with me?”</p>
<p>“You bought me as a slave, so you can tell me to do whatever you
want,” Jian Bu Gu flippantly said.</p>
<p>“I am going to a place called Thirty-Three Days,” Han Sen said
to Jian Bu Gu while he looked at him. “I am sure it is a place that
you are no stranger to.” Jian Bu Gu put down his needle, looked at
Han Sen, and asked, “Will you be taking Qin Bai to Thirty-Three
Days?”</p>
<p>“Thirty-Three Days is dangerous, but I can look after myself,”
Han Sen casually said. “There is no need to worry about that. Qin
Bai is the Qin Kingdom’s crown prince. He is the future of the Qin
Kingdom. He should experience more. It will only bring him
goodness. It will not be anything bad. What do you think, Mister
Jian?” “Although you might be able to say that, that place is too
dangerous,” Jian Bu Gu said. “I have been through Seven Skies and
almost died. Plus, you have a rivalry with the God Chaos Party.
Going there is like a lamb waltzing up to the slaughter.”</p>
<p>“Mister, if you have been, I am sure you must know that place
relatively well,” Han Sen said with a smile. “I have never been
there before. Would you mind introducing me?”</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu tried to remember the locale. “Seven Skies is for
fallen people. They obey the evil gods of the God Chaos Party. That
place is different from the universe of kingdoms. Fallen humans and
gene races are all full of hatred there, and they are under the
effect of the mysterious powers of Thirty-Three Days. Humans and
gene races undergo scary changes in that place. You have seen what
Rocky Dee is capable of. If you have, then you should know how
scary the gene races there might be.”</p>
<p>“Aside from that, there are many other scary things there. Even
God Spirits can die in that place, and we are talking about Qin
Bai.” Jian Bu Gu made an oath not to care about the Qin Kingdom,
but he was from there. His heart still cared about the Qin Kingdom.
“There is no need to worry about my problems with the God Chaos
Party. I have a way to sort things out, and it will not affect this
trip.” After pausing, Han Sen said, “Plus, this time I want to see
One Sky. I will not go deep. I do not think there will be many
dangers. It would be fantastic if you could go so you could watch
out for Qin Bai.”</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu looked at Han Sen, but he did not say anything. His
eyes looked weird. “I said my life is indebted to you. You can ask
me to do anything your heart desires.”</p>
<p>“In that case, please ready yourself,” Han Sen said. “It does
not matter if Qin Bai comes or not, but you and I are still leaving
come tomorrow.” He left after speaking.</p>
<p>That night, someone broke into the Feng family castle. They put
something down in Jian Bu Gu’s room. Jian Bu Gu left the Feng
family castle. He went out in the middle of the night. It was
unknown where he went.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw everything, but he learned nothing The next day, Han
Sen heard Qin Bai’s happy voice call out, “Han Sen, where are you?
Why are you not up? Come and pack. We have to go!”</p>
<p>“Why are you so early?” Han Sen yawned and emerged from his
room. He saw Qin Bai looking very excited. He knew Qin Jinzhen had
permitted him to go on the journey.”</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are a god. Father did not agree right away. After
I mentioned Mister Jian, as you said to do, father immediately
acted differently. His determination to not permit me to go was
weakened. He did not fully agree either. At first, I thought it
failed. This morning, my father told Thousand Mile Reach that I
would be allowed to travel with you.” Qin Bai looked at Han Sen
with sheer admiration.</p>
<p>“As I expected.” Han Sen blushed and pretended to gasp.</p>
<p>Qin Bai wanted to say something, but Bao’er walked in. He
immediately hid behind Han Sen. He forced a smile and said,
“Bao’er, hello.”</p>
<p>“Crown Prince, hello,” Bao’er said with a blink of her eyes. “It
has been a while since we played chess together. Why don’t we play
some?”.</p>
<p>“No… No…” Qin Bai’s face had turned white. He shook his head and
said, “I have stuff to do with Han Sen. I can’t play chess today.
Perhaps next time?”</p>
<p>“Bao’er, have you packed your things?” Han Sen asked while doing
his best not to laugh.</p>
<p>Bao’er lowered her head. Her left hand held the small flying
fish whereas her right hand had Small Cat in it. She nodded and
said, “I have packed.” When Qin Bai heard that, his face changed.
In shock, he said, “Bao’er is so young. Are we studying together?”
“Traveling is better than studying books,” Han Sen said with a
smile. “It will be nice to have her learn something new too.”</p>
<p>Bao’er did not speak. She looked at Qin Bai as if she was
smiling, but she was not smiling.</p>
<p>Qin Bai now regretted his decision to come. If he knew that
demon child was going, he would not have been so excited.</p>
<p>Qin Bai made up his mind that he was not going to do anything to
invoke her ire. He would not promise to play chess with her
either.</p>
<p>Everyone was packed and ready to go. Before they departed the
Feng family castle, they saw a man and a woman waiting outside.</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked and noticed it was his teacher, Thousand Mile
Reach, whom he admired. The other was Jia Shi Zhen. He knew
something bad must have happened.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen bowed to Han Sen, but they
both looked at the small flying fish Bao’er was holding.</p>
<p>The small flying fish had a bit of notoriety. After all, it had
recently shocked the universe. Everyone knew about it. It was only
Qin Bai who did not fight or watch the fights who did not know
about the small flying fish. Everyone else knew.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach said, “Mister Han, the king has asked us to
accompany Mister Crown Prince on your journey. Will this disturb
you?” Qin Bai’s face immediately collapsed.</p>
