  Because of what Horizontal Evil was doing, the metal pillar began to shine. It shook in his hands, as if it was desperately trying to keep drilling into him. But Horizontal Evil had the pillar solidly in his grip now. No matter how brightly the pillar shone or how much it wanted to burrow back into him, Horizontal Evil was still able to remove it with his hands.

Boom!

When the last of the metal came free of Horizontal Evil’s chest, Han Sen finally realized that the metal pillar was actually a giant spear. That spear was writhing like a snake in Horizontal Evil’s hands. It seemed to be trying to escape from his clutches, but the giant bore down hard, pinning the spear in place.

Horizontal Evil toppled from the mountain, and Han Sen thought, “If you had the power to free yourself, why have you remained trapped here for so many years? And all those Breakskies were kept here for many years trying to free you.”

After Horizontal Evil escaped, the wounds on his chest quickly healed. The gaping edges of the gashes pulled closed, and soon after, there was not a single mark left on his chest.

But once Horizontal Evil was free, the mountain began to shake. It wasn’t just the mountain, either. The ocean that spread around them as far the eye could see began to grow turbulent and wild. It was like the world was ending.

Horizontal Evil stood upon the waves of the sea. He gripped the spear in his hands, and he roared defiantly to the sky. His voice made the whole realm become even shakier. Han Sen had been flying, but the sheer volume of the noise knocked him out of the sky.

“Stop shouting! I’m going to die.” Han Sen felt as if his chest was filling up with blood due to the noise. Eleven of his organs felt like they were about to be torn apart. He had to use all of his power to fight against the damaging acoustics, but nothing he did seemed to help.

Han Sen’s voice was like an ant’s compared to that thundering roar. No matter how much he shouted, he couldn’t even hear himself.

Just as Han Sen thought he was going to die because of that shouting, Horizontal Evil finally stopped.

Han Sen felt instant relief. He coughed, and dark blood bubbled over his lips. He straightened back up to see Horizontal Evil looking at him. He thought the giant was going to say something, but Horizontal Evil merely lifted the spear, turned the point toward his chest, and slammed the weapon through his heart.

The blade punched straight through Horizontal Evil’s heart again, but he didn’t seem to care. After he pulled the spear back out, he put his hand into the wound. He searched around a little, then pulled something out.

“Take it. From now on, every god in existence will be your enemy. Whether you like it or not, this is your fate. And it is a fate you can no longer escape from.” Horizontal Evil opened his fist, and something that looked like a meteor came flying toward Han Sen.

When Han Sen saw the speed and massive power of the item flying toward him, his heart leaped into his throat. He moved to catch the item.

But when it landed in his hands, it touched his skin as gently as a feather.

Han Sen knew that it was Horizontal Evil controlling the flight of the item, so he wasn’t too surprised. But when he opened his hands and had a look at that thing, Han Sen’s breath caught in his chest. He stared at his hands in dumbfounded awe.

Han Sen was holding a black crystal. He was familiar with its shape, size, and weight. In some ways, no one could be more familiar with it than he was.

The black crystal was the same as the one he had taken from the black armor bug’s belly so long ago. If Han Sen hadn’t already absorbed that black crystal and received the black crystal armor from it, he would have thought it was the exact same.

“What’s going on? The thing Horizontal Evil has been referencing is the black crystal. Is this black crystal the same as the one I found inside the sanctuaries? Does this also contain a black crystal armor?” Han Sen’s mind was in shambles, and he tried to formulate thoughts on this revelation.

“You should leave now. After this life, there will be no more Horizontal Evil. The Breakskies will no longer exist.” Horizontal Evil’s eyes looked as if they were on fire, and he turned to look up toward the sun clock in the sky. Han Sen didn’t ask anything more of the man. Horizontal Evil suddenly jumped, broke space, and shot toward the sun perched in the sky. The metal spear he held was raised and pointed at the sun clock.

Now, finally, Han Sen understood some of what was happening in this strange world.

The Breakskies had been digging the mountain all their lives, hoping to save Horizontal Evil. But Horizontal Evil had allowed himself to be pinned to the mountain because of them. He let himself be tortured. He had the power to escape, but if he escaped, the giants of that world would die. That was why Horizontal Evil had been there the whole time.

When Han Sen flew away from the mountain and found himself among the palaces, he found that they were no longer protected from the waves. The giant walls of water battered the palaces, slowly pulling them down in the deep. The flesh of the giants was sloughing off as Han Sen watched, leaving only gaunt skeletal remains behind.

“What a cruel curse. This is so sick. Horizontal Evil had to remain trapped in order for them to live. And if he escaped, they would rot down to their bones in minutes. Horizontal Evil didn’t want to see his people become extinct, but who knows how long he was tortured on that mountain. Dead or alive, his entire existence had become pain. This must be the most horrible torture ever.” Han Sen sighed. He didn’t want to see those giant bones anymore. He flew fast toward the Four Sheep Cube.

Boom!

Before Han Sen could reach the Four Sheep Cube, he heard an explosion. Bright light covered everything around him. Within that shiny explosion, he couldn’t even see his fingers. The shockwave rocked the entire dimension. It was like the landscape had been turned on its head, with the water now up in the sky.

Han Sen cast his Purple-Eye Butterfly as he looked up. The weird sun clock in the sky had been cracked, and Horizontal Evil was rushing forward, still holding the spear.

Waves of fire washed out of the broken sun clock like tsunamis. Han Sen knew instantly that the power he was witnessing was greater than what a deified elite could unleash at max power. Han Sen didn’t dare remain. He accelerated hard, racing toward the Four Sheep Cube.

“After guarding the red dust for a billion years, one spear breaks the sky to slay a ghost and god,” Horizontal Evil shouted. His voice echoed throughout the realm, but Han Sen could no longer see him.

The waves of fire swept across the sky, but Han Sen didn’t dare slow down to watch. Although he had many more questions he wished to ask Horizontal Evil, he wouldn’t have the chance to do that now.

He glanced at the strange scene in the sky one last time as he stepped on the bronze sheep head. Then, he teleported away from that mysterious world through the Four Sheep Cube.

Han Sen wanted to know what happened to Horizontal Evil in the end, but he couldn’t go back. He held the black crystal, and his heart felt sick and saddened.

“This black crystal… Is it really like the first one I found?” Han Sen rubbed the black crystal with his fingers. That feeling was so real… It couldn’t be fake.
