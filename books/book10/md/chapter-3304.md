  Bury Path God started to look awfully heavy. He did not know how Qin Xiu had managed to accomplish what he had done, but he thought this must have had something to do with Shoot Shadow controlling the life soul test subject Sky King.

They looked at Shoot Shadow. He looked very red. He looked more excited than any other scary creature.

Qin Xiu’s body came from space. All the God Chaos Party members immediately bowed to show their respect.

Qin Xiu coldly said to Shoot Shadow, “Shoot Shadow, you can start.”

Shoot Shadow excitedly went forward. Bury Path God and the others all looked confused. They did not know what Qin Xiu was doing.

Not long later, they saw Shoot Shadow bring 100 beasts forth. They were pulling a giant copper stove forward. The big beasts were not Break World beasts, but they were god-class genes races with an ultimate body. Many beasts were needed to pull that 9-foot-tall copper stove. They looked as if they were having trouble doing so.

The copper stove sank into the ground. The 100 big beasts were trying their best to pull it forward. It was just about enough to drag the copper stove forward. It left a deep trench in the ground.

The copper stove was pulled in front of Qin Xiu before coming to a stop. After that, the 100 big beasts were almost unable to stand. Their legs trembled. A few of them were weak. Some of them were heaving up a white froth.

Shoot Shadow politely bowed and said, “Mister Leader, everything is ready.”

“Turn it on,” Qin Xiu coldly said.

“Yes, Master,” Shoot Shadow replied. He walked in front of the copper stove, holding each side of the stove. The Break World powers burned madly. In the end, he shouted. He had barely opened a small gap in the lid of the copper stove.

Boom!

A black flame came out of the copper stove. It was like a volcano erupting into the sky. The copper stove and stone lid blasted away with Shoot Shadow.

“Life souls.” Bury Path God and the others were shocked.

Whatever came out of the copper stove was not a black flame. It was a countless number of spirit bodies that looked like monsters. They were like demons crawling out of hell.

They came crawling out of the copper stove. They went into the universe hole.

It was unknown how many life souls were in the copper stove. Even Bury Path God and the others could not believe what they were seeing. They could not believe Qin Xiu had that many life souls in his possession.

They thought they were overestimating Qin Xiu by believing he had over a hundred life souls already. Now, at least 10,000 life souls had come streaming out of the stove.

There were ghosts like angels, Buddhas, dragons, god birds, and all other types of life souls. They all came pouring out, shooting up and into the sky. Even Bury Path God felt cold and dim in the witness of this scene.

There were so many life souls. If they all became Break World beasts, things would have been absurdly scary.

Many life souls went drilling through the hole in the universe. They drilled their way out of the universe. Some life souls entered the geno universe. Some life souls entered the universe of kingdoms. It was like a sky full of dandelions. They brought their scary seeds to every corner of the two universes.

When Han Sen saw a life soul near the hole in the universe, his face changed.

Previously, he had seen creatures of the universe of kingdoms travel through the universal hole to reach the geno universe. The creatures of the universe of creatures had been suppressed by the geno universe. Weaker creatures were crushed and blown up.

Even top-class creatures of the universe of kingdoms visiting the geno universe were suppressed and prohibited from using their powers. It was not harmful.

These life souls were different. Life souls that went to the geno universe were not suppressed by the rules of the universe. They went to all sorts of planets.

Han Sen felt a chill. He saw five life souls were coming into the area. He did not know how many went to other areas. Han Sen could not imagine what consequences the life souls would bring to the geno universe.

“Die!” Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura. He raced into the life souls that were flying, but Han Sen noticed the Dongxuan Aura that had already reached Break World status and could not touch the life souls.

“The life souls and I are the same when I turned on Super God Spirit mode. Are they just spirit bodies?” Han Sen now understood that only spirit bodies were not affected by powers.

Han Sen looked frozen. He suddenly entered Super God Spirit mode. His heart jumped. He teleported in front of a tiger-like life soul. He threw a punch at the life soul.

Boom!

Han Sen blew up the tiger-like life soul. Han Sen’s body promptly flashed away. Seven to eight life souls were broken near the system. They became starlight and quickly vanished.

Han Sen thought, “It looks like these Super God Spirit bodies are useless against materials. But to spirit bodies, it is useful.”

While watching Han Sen go and kill a few of the life souls was impressive to many, to the life souls were fleeing to a different universe, the act was nothing. More life souls went into the other universe.

There was a life soul that was rather like a black dragon. It went into the Dragon system. It was heading for a dragon xenogeneic that was asleep. It entered that dragon xenogeneic’s body.

The dragon xenogeneic was sleeping soundly. It suddenly woke up and roared to the sky. Its body dramatically changed. Black flames burned across it. Its back developed large black spikes. The dragon’s wings kept growing. They developed backside hooks on them.

The dragon xenogeneic mutated fast. Its presence became scarier and scarier. It created a power that was the opposite of the world. It was going to break the world.

This scene kept happening in both universes. Powerful creatures were invaded by life souls and combined with them. The creatures quickly mutated.

Although not all the life souls invaded powerful creatures, a lot of them did.

“What is that?” Huangfu Jing brought 100 young men to kill xenogeneics in Space Garden. She suddenly saw a weird xenogeneic in front of them. That xenogeneic was like a tyrannosaurus rex. It burned with a black flame. Its back had many visible bones. Its eyes looked like they were holding black flames within them. It was like a demon that had come from hell.

A Sky Palace young man looked at the star tyrannosaurus rex curiously and asked, “Isn’t that a star tyrannosaurus rex? Why does it look so strange?”

“You guys should head back to camp right now.” Upon seeing the star tyrannosaurus rex, Huangfu Jing looked gravely serious.
