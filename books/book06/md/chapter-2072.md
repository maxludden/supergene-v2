  After returning home, Han Sen spent some time thinking about capturing the red cloud. It seemed likely that petrification or freezing abilities would be effective against the red cloud.

But his own petrifying shockwave was no match for the red cloud’s speed. Even if Han Sen teleported right next to the beast, the red cloud could still react fast enough to avoid the shockwave. Its ability to accelerate seemed almost endless.

“But the petrifying shockwave is a power obtained from refining a mutant xenogeneic gene. I need to follow its rigid terms of use to cast it. I can’t use it with knife silks. If I could, it might be a lot more useful.”

Han Sen was rapidly becoming obsessed with catching that cocky red cloud.

Turtle did not work on it. Han Sen had tried, but the Turtle image just wouldn’t stick to the clouds. When the clouds spread, the Turtle spell would just come off. There were no better methods for applying it, either.

“If my Jadeskin had a freezing power, and I could put the Jadeskin godlight into the knife silks, I could possibly tie it up and make it into an ice cube. Jadeskin’s godlight possesses the element of ice, but it doesn’t possess a powerful freezing ability.” Han Sen was starting to feel depressed.

He still couldn’t think of a way to catch the red cloud. He had no choice but to wait until he could think of a good way to catch it.

The next day, Han Sen picked up Blood Feather Knife and went to visit the tenth elder. Han Sen wasn’t going there to meet with him explicitly, though; more than anything, he was there to see Yun Suyi.

He had absorbed all of the mutant blood and returned the blade to its normal state. It was now a bona fide half-deified treasure. With some further refinements, there was every chance it could become a fully-fledged deified weapon.

Han Sen wanted to swap the Blood Feather Knife for his Ghost Teeth Knife. He needed to talk about it with Yun Suyi.

But Han Sen thought that if Yun Suyi had the knife, it would be best if he spoke to her father, Yun Changkong, as well. If Yun Changkong could not refine the deified weapon, he might have to ask for the leader’s help.

When Han Sen went to see the Yun family, Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were both there. Thousand Feather Crane was out hunting xenogeneics, and he had not yet returned.

“Sister Yun, thank you for lending me your Blood Feather Knife. I’ve come to return it. There is, however, something I need to tell you first.” Han Sen presented the knife to Yun Suyi. “I absorbed the xenogeneic blood. I am sorry I could not tell you about this any sooner.”

Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were both shocked. The Blood Feather Knife was famous because it was the blood that had always prohibited it from becoming deified. If Han Sen really had removed the mark, then it had a chance of becoming deified again.

Yun Suyi accepted the knife and inspected it. The blood really was gone. The knife was as clean as a glossy feather.

“How did you do that?” Yun Suyi asked Han Sen with visible shock.

The Feather had tried every method they could think of to remove the blood on the knife, but each attempt had ended in failure. If they knew removing the blood was possible, they’d have never given the knife away. Han Sen seemed to only possess the powers of an Earl or a Marquise, so she had no clue how he might have done this.

“Mutant blood meshes well with my geno art, so I was able to absorb it,” Han Sen explained.

“Brother Han, this is a great service. If the Feather knew about this, they’d be furious.” Yun Sushang, overhearing them talk, sighed.

“It was all down to luck,” Han Sen said with a grin.

Yun Suyi took the Ghost Teeth Knife from her waist and returned it to Han Sen. Her fingers lingered on the blade, though, and it seemed like she’d miss it. “I have not used it for long, so I can’t believe I am already giving it back.”

“But now you have the Blood Feather Knife, which is greater than the Ghost Teeth Knife,” Han Sen said, as he took Ghost Teeth Knife back.

The Blood Feather Knife was strong, but Han Sen was more comfortable with the Ghost Teeth Knife. It complemented his abilities.

“It’s different.” Yun Suyi shook her head, but did not say anything more. She didn’t sound happy about the prospect of the Blood Feather Knife’s potential.

Just as Han Sen expected, Yun Changkong took the Blood Feather Knife to the Sky Palace leader. The leader, in turn, passed it on to the folks at Sky Path Garden. He allowed them to work on it, in the hopes of making it deified again.

This news spread all across Sky Palace. According to the research results, there was an 80% chance it could become deified again.

Sky Palace was fervently excited. Even the nobles of Sky Palace seemed giddy. Millennia might pass without a new deified weapon turning up.

But Angia, and certain others in Sky Palace, weren’t as joyful. They did not look good.

“It’s Han Sen again!” Angia growled.

All the races guarded their deified weapons jealously. This one should have belonged to the Feather, but it now belonged to Sky Palace. The Feather in Holy Heaven heard what had happened, too. They all looked upset, and it was difficult to determine if they were shocked or just mad.

Han Sen found the opportunity to return to the sanctuaries again. There, he hugged his cute wife and daughter.

“Dad, I want a hug too.” Bao’er approached, looking at Han Sen.

Han Sen held one child in each arm. He felt happy. It would have been perfect if Littleflower was still around.

The next morning, Han Sen prepared to return to Sky Palace. But just as he was about to, Bao’er jumped into his arms and said, “Dad, I want to go with you.”

You still need to go to school. I will take you when you grow up,” Han Sen said.

“Huh! If you’re not taking me, then I will find my own way there,” Bao’er said defiantly, much to Han Sen’s surprise.

“You have a way of getting there?” Han Sen asked. Bao’er wasn’t an ordinary child, so there was a chance she might have actually found a way there.

“I’m not telling you. Since you’re not taking me, I will go there myself,” Bao’er said flatly

“Bao’er, it’s not that I don’t want to take you. It’s because I cannot take you. Just wait a little while, until I’m back on Planet Eclipse. I will take you there then, okay?” Han Sen said quickly, trying to comfort her. He didn’t want her to do anything rash.

Han Sen couldn’t take her there yet. Sky Palace wouldn’t allow the presence of a random outsider. If someone saw her, it’d be hard to explain.

“Fine, but you cannot lie to me. If this is a lie, I will still go there my own way.” Bao’er held out her finger for a pinky promise.

“I promise you. I will take you there when I return to Planet Eclipse,” Han Sen said seriously. He hooked her little pinky with his own, and then he touched her thumbs.

Bao’er believed Han Sen, and so she jumped out of his arms.

Han Sen suddenly thought of something. “Bao’er, the items that you sucked inside the little gourd. Can they be released?”

“Yeah.” Bao’er blinked.
