<p>Looking at Yisha slashing forward, Han Sen did not bother evading like before. He moved his body forward and teleported in front of her.</p>

<p>When the teeth knife slashed down from above, Han Sen pulled out his right hand&#8217;s middle finger and index finger to catch the teeth knife&#8217;s body. That scary knife power was captured by Han Sen&#8217;s fingers. The attack was unable to proceed anymore.</p>

<p>Yisha&#8217;s vision was like a blade. Her body&#8217;s power was gathering on the knife. She kept trying to press the blade down. As Han Sen&#8217;s fingers continued to clamp it, the teeth knife looked as if it was growing roots. It was unable to move.</p>

<p>It looks like the god spirit gene&#8217;s geno armament is rather lame. With the buff of the scabbard, Yisha&#8217;s power is still able to override my xenogeneic body. Han Sen had given Yisha the scabbard because he wanted to see how powerful the scabbard was. If Yisha was able to use the scabbard to beat him, he would let Yisha keep the scabbard as a reward for being his teacher.</p>

<p>When Yisha received the scabbard&#8217;s boon, she was still unable to influence the universal cogwheels that were currently under the Dongxuan Sutra&#8217;s control. It could not be spun.</p>

<p>It was because Han Sen&#8217;s xenogeneic body was too strong and Yisha had just received the scabbard. She was unable to activate the scabbard&#8217;s entire power.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the scabbard was not made from just a god&#8217;s personality. Compared to a god&#8217;s personality armament, it was considerably weaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does that work? Dollar&#8217;s power can restrict a scary Knife Queen who attacks like that. Is he butterfly class?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judging from his level of power, he should only be larva class. A larva class being with this sort of power must mean he is the best of the same level though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no wonder Dollar is so cocky. He has what it takes to be.&#8221;</p>

<br>

<hr />

<br>

<p>Han Sen released his hands and retreated a few steps. He looked at Yisha and said, &#8220;Knife Queen, I do not think you have enough power to beat me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yisha looked at Han Sen strangely. She flipped her hands and threw the scabbard back to Han Sen. When Han Sen caught the scabbard, Yisha was already flying out of the space battleground.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I beat you, I will take back the scabbard.&#8221; A cold voice echoed throughout the space battleground.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He left the space battleground.</p>

<p>Han Sen had won the match quickly and cleanly, but there were too many deified creatures. Many of them, including Zheng Xuandao, Dragon One, Demon Alpha, Destroyed Leader, and the Very High Leader, were taking part. That was a whole bunch of scary people. Golden Growler continued to prove itself invincible. No creature dared enter the space battleground to fight it.</p>

<p>Thus, Han Sen&#8217;s performance made people&#8217;s eyes brighten. He had reached a level that shocked people.</p>

<p>Back in the garden, Han Sen saw God sitting on a stone chair. There was a chessboard atop the stone table.</p>

<p>God looked at Han Sen and said, &#8220;Your power is not comparable to anyone else in the same class. Even against a butterfly class creature, you are pretty good. You have such powerful genes. It should be carried on by ancient blood. Yet, you do not look like anyone with ancient blood. It is very strange. Can you tell me what race you belong to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am human,&#8221; Han Sen casually answered. He saw the chess pieces were in a stalemate. He was confused and asked, &#8220;Who were you playing chess with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just an interesting guy,&#8221; God said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;An interesting guy, huh? Where is he?&#8221; Han Sen did not see anyone else there.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is here,&#8221; God said and pointed at the chessboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221; Han Sen looked at the chessboard with confusion. Aside from the chessboard itself, he could neither see nor feel anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is inside the chessboard,&#8221; God said with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he&#8230;&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s face changed. He closely inspected the chessboard&#8217;s chess pieces. He saw a black chess piece that looked very weird.</p>

<p>The black and white chess pieces were very simple. There were not many differences between them, but this black chess piece was carved with a symbol. It was an old man symbol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does this symbol look so familiar&#8230; Oh, crap!&#8221; Han Sen opened his mouth in shock. With a look of disbelief, he asked, &#8220;Is that Holy Pirate? Why was he turned into a chess piece?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He made three wishes to me. One of them was that he wished to play chess. I fulfilled his wish.&#8221; God pointed to the chessboard and asked, &#8220;Are you interested in finishing the round?&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen shook his head. He did not want to end up like Holy Pirate and become a chess piece on a chessboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, he is only like that because he made a wish to me,&#8221; God said with a laugh. &#8220;I am only going to play chess with you. Nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen shook his head. &#8220;My chess skills are only average. You should find a chess master to play against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your geno art is very familiar to the Very High&#8217;s Very High Sense,&#8221; God said. &#8220;Chess is very good for you to understand things. Learning how to play well might serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen knew God was right. The Dongxuan Sutra and the game of chess had a lot in common. In the past, he had researched chess skills, so his chess abilities were pretty good.</p>

<p>But playing chess against God was more than practice. There was bound to be a lot more pressure in a game of chess that was more like a deathmatch. If he fell for God&#8217;s tricks, there was every chance he could end up like Holy Pirate. Han Sen shook his head and said, &#8220;I am going to prepare the next round. I do not have time to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen was telling the truth. He needed to reach butterfly class before the next round began.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you lose, you do not have to give me anything. If you win, I can give you this chess piece.&#8221; God pointed at the chess piece that Holy Pirate had become.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would I need that chess piece for?&#8221; Han Sen shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;People can become chess pieces, and chess pieces can become people. If you have this chess piece, you can do anything you want with it. He can only do what you want him to do. If there is a knife mountain fire sea ahead, he cannot regret it.&#8221; After speaking God picked up a white piece, placed it on the chessboard, smiled, and said, &#8220;Your turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen did not know what Holy Pirate&#8217;s level was, but he had to be at least butterfly class since he could freely enter and leave Space Garden. Having a deified creature that could be controlled like that would be very good for him.</p>

<p>Holy Pirate also had the power to freely enter and exit Space Garden, which worried Han Sen. He was concerned that Holy Pirate would become a tool for people of other races to attack Space Garden. If he was able to keep Holy Pirate in his pocket, that would be beneficial.</p>

<p>It was a big temptation, but Han Sen did not dare believe God.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that for the next half a year, I would not do anything to harm you,&#8221; God coldly said. &#8220;I will not break my promise. You should know that God cannot lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK. You make a bet with me to do this. I suppose I will participate.&#8221; Han Sen picked up a chess piece and sat opposite of God.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought his chess skills weren&#8217;t too shabby. In the Alliance, he was one of the top-class chess players. When he played chess with God, he lost badly.</p>

<p>Stalemates didn&#8217;t count. Han Sen and God played eight rounds. Han Sen lost each and every time. He was unable to fight back. He lost completely.</p>

<p>Han Sen playing chess with God was like playing against a supercomputer. The moves he made took forever to calculate, but his opponent would respond with a move that seemed almost random. It did not look as if God even thought about what to do. Even so, Han Sen sorely lost each time.</p>
