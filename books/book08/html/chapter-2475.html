<h3>Chapter 2475</h3>

<p>Lando had placed the mark on Han Sen to keep him on a leash, but
now he had simply torn the mark off. That told Han Sen how serious
of a situation they were in. Lando wasn’t bluffing.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only been hovering there for a short time when the
horde of unicorns found him again. They rushed toward him in a
crazed mass.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t use his Blood Eye Evil God power this time.
Instead, he drew his Ghost Teeth Knife and Thunder God Spike. With
them in-hand, he plunged into the field of battle. In a few
seconds, he slew a dozen unicorns.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Duke hunted: White Unicorn. Xenogeneic gene found.
Obtained White Unicorn beast soul.”</p>
<p>After killing a few more unicorns, Han Sen received this beast
soul announcement. Han Sen took a quick glance into his Sea of Soul
and noticed that it was a mount beast soul. He could use it to
travel, but it wouldn’t fight.</p>
<p>In this situation, using a mount would be pointless. There were
too many other unicorns about. Maneuverability was incredibly
important right now, and using a mount would be too cumbersome.</p>
<p>The unicorns came in seven different colors. The colors he had
seen thus far included black, white, purple, red, gold, blue, and
green. The unicorns of each color were divided into ordinary Dukes,
Kings, and half-deifieds. Each color possessed different area
powers.</p>
<p>Just like the Demon Bug King Bai Sema that Han Sen used to use,
the unicorns’ powers could be overlapped and increased. But while
Han Sen’s old shield was a purely defensive bai sema, and the areas
of the unicorns could also be used to attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to deal with the group of unicorns and fight seven
unicorn Kings at the same time. It was a very chaotic fight.</p>
<p>There were simply too many unicorns. Although Han Sen was able
to avoid engaging directly with the unicorn Kings, he had his hands
full just killing the lesser unicorns. The blood that flowed in his
wake was like a river. Han Sen’s hands soon grew tired.</p>
<p>“Fuck! What is going on?” Han Sen looked over to Lando, who was
still fighting that deified unicorn.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so far away that he couldn’t see their battle
clearly, though. All he could see was the shifting light of seven
colors. He knew the deified unicorn had the upper hand. Lando was
having a hard time dealing with the creature’s attacks.</p>
<p>“I hope the legends about him are true, and he can actually take
down a deified xenogeneic. If those tales aren’t true, I don’t
think he will last very long.” Han Sen gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>While Han Sen and Lando fought, a giant turtle hovered above the
clouds. That giant turtle was carrying a pavilion upon its back. A
Dragon man and a deified of the Destroyed were drinking tea
together.</p>
<p>Behind the Dragon man was a female Dragon servant holding a
Wanjie Rubix Cube. It was filming Han Sen and Lando’s battle.</p>
<p>Every person in the geno universe was watching the tremendous
fight unfold.</p>
<p>“Klose, it doesn’t look like you are going to win.” The Dragon
man sipped tea and smiled at the Destroyed.</p>
<p>“Winning or losing, it’s all the same to me. If I lose, you can
have Lando and Han Sen. I won’t get in the way of that. But if you
lose, you won’t betray our terms will you, Dragon One?” Klose’s six
eyes looked at the Dragon man while he spoke.</p>
<p>“We Dragon always keep our promises. If Lando and Han Sen can
kill all of these unicorns and survive, the Dragon will leave the
Tianxia System and cease all involvement in this matter,” Dragon
One said firmly.</p>
<p>Although the Dragon man was being referred to as Dragon One, he
wasn’t the same Dragon One that Han Sen had seen before. This was
the Dragon One of a previous generation.</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s wait for the result.” Klose grabbed his cup
of tea and had a sip. He looked rather relaxed.</p>
<p>Dragon One could see that Klose didn’t appear worried. He smiled
and asked, “You aren’t afraid of Lando being killed by that deified
unicorn? If that happens, what will you tell the king of the
Destroyed?”</p>
<p>“He is just a servant. If he joins the Extreme King, he knows he
might sacrifice his ties to the Destroyed,” Klose said slowly. His
face didn’t move a muscle.</p>
<p>After that, Klose’s expression became interested. He looked at
Dragon One and said, “I’m afraid this is the Dragons’ best chance
at capturing Lando. If you fail, how will you explain that to the
king of the Dragons?”</p>
<p>“Lando has to die. You really think he can defeat a deified
being all alone?” Dragon One shot back, his tone dripping with
derision.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is still there.” Klose laughed.</p>
<p>“He’s just a first-tier King. It doesn’t matter how experienced
he might be; he’s no more than a strong ant,” Dragon One
growled.</p>
<p>Klose didn’t say anything more. He looked at the Dragon servant
holding the Wanjie Rubix Cube and said, “I can’t believe that
someone as strong and smart as you has decided to use the live
stream of the Thousand Treasures Alliance to his advantage.”</p>
<p>“No matter the resource, I can find ways to make use of it,”
Dragon One said with a chilly smile.</p>
<p>All the creatures in the geno universe were watching this stream
if they had the time.</p>
<p>But the video that Dragon One was streaming wasn’t as polished
as the previous videos that had come from the Treasure Identifier
Elder. He didn’t have a professional team to handle the video, so
he just played it straight to the broadcasting networks, 1:1 as
things happened. There was no editing or clean-up.</p>
<p>So, many creatures were unable to see that Lando was actually
fighting a deified unicorn. They could only see a video of flashing
lights. It was like the lights you’d see at the end of the
world.</p>
<p>In Han Sen’s fight, high-level Kings and Dukes were able to make
out a bit more. So, most of the Kings, Dukes, and nobles tuned into
Han Sen’s battle.</p>
<p>Some powerful elites focused on Lando and his fight against the
deified unicorn. They knew that Lando’s performance would determine
whether both he and Han Sen lived or died.</p>
<p>But they also wanted to know more about just how strong Lando
truly was. Although Lando had once killed a deified elite, most
elites believed there had to be more to the tale. After all,
Lando’s teacher wasn’t just an ordinary deified. And the way that
Lando slew his teacher indicated that they were missing
information.</p>
<p>“This is too scary. That Han Sen is surrounded by Kings and
half-deifieds, and yet he hasn’t lost his advantage. He has killed
so many unicorns. He’s even managed to bring down two King
unicorns. What impressive power.”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame, really. If he hadn’t been reckless enough to kill
an Extreme King prince, he could have become famous across the
entire universe.”</p>
<p>“I think that Yisha has the most cause to be upset about what
has happened. Han Sen’s genes aren’t stable, and yet she actually
brought him all the way up to King class. I can’t imagine how many
resources and how much effort was spent on him to get that done.
But now, it’s all gone. We don’t even know if what Han Sen has done
will affect her.”</p>
<p>“Yisha is smart. When Han Sen received Kong Fei’s deified
feather, many normal elites wanted to adopt him. But Yisha was the
one that took him in and brought him up to King class. No one
expected Han Sen to become this strong when he reached King. I bet
those other elites really regret it now.”</p>
<p>“What would they be regretting? No matter how strong he is, he’s
just a King. Not even a deified could get out of a predicament like
this, let alone a King.”</p>
