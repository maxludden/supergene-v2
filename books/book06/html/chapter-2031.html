<h3>Chapter 2031</h3>

<p>Not long after entering the silver statue, Han Sen heard buzzing
sounds coming from close to the statue’s entrance.</p>
<p>Han Sen was familiar with this sound. It was the sound of the
silver glass bug flapping its wings. He summoned Spell in the form
of a rocket launcher and fired it at the cave wall.</p>
<p>After firing it, he didn’t stick around to see the result. He
just took the time to tuck himself into a narrower passage and hide
his presence.</p>
<p>The rocket exploded against the wall, and a loud noise echoed
throughout the caverns of the statue’s interior. Han Sen heard the
buzzing get stronger, and not long after, the silver glass bug came
to patrol the area.</p>
<p>“Dragon Thirteen must have heard that,” Han Sen thought, as he
kept himself hidden.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen and Sharon did hear the noise. They did not know
what had happened, but whatever it was would not make them give up
the chase. Dragon Thirteen led Sharon in Han Sen’s direction.</p>
<p>As Dragon Thirteen drew nearer, the silver glass bug searched
fruitlessly for Han Sen. When Dragon Thirteen and Sharon reached
Han Sen’s proximity, however, what they saw was the silver glass
bug.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug caught sight of them, too. With a squeal,
it came charging towards them. Its mouth opened to spew silver
light.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen, who was in the front, was quick to react. She
raised her lance and thrust it towards the incoming silver glass
bug.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The lance and the silver light collided. The silver light was
broken, but the lance that was sharper than a needle came against
the silver glass bug’s shield. The shield flashed in response to
the strike, but it was unbroken. Dragon Thirteen was spent
spiraling back ten meters by what remained of the silver light.</p>
<p>“A mutant Marquise xenogeneic.” Dragon Thirteen’s face
paled.</p>
<p>“Kill it,” Sharon said. Then, he drew a scimitar. With his
Sky-Demon powers, he used it to strike the silver glass bug.</p>
<p>There was a dong noise as the Sky-Demon power came against the
silver glass bug’s shield. The creature was unhurt, and the impact
only knocked it back a small distance.</p>
<p>Sharon and Dragon Thirteen attacked the silver glass bug
together. The silver glass bug’s silver shield kept flashing under
the combined strikes, though, and it looked as if it might
break.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen’s lance was very effective when it came to
piercing things. Her strength was focused on the tip of the weapon,
where it could deal the most damage. The silver glass bug’s silver
shield might not withstand the repeated blows for long.</p>
<p>“I can’t let them kill the bug! If they kill it, I am done for,”
Han Sen thought to himself. He emerged from the small passage he
had been hiding in, and with Tusk, he attacked Dragon Thirteen from
behind.</p>
<p>But Dragon Thirteen was quick to react to this sneak attack. Her
screw-shaped lance quickly came against Han Sen’s knife air. They
collided, and the knife air was almost penetrated by the power of
the lance.</p>
<p>Han Sen expected this, however. He dodged the lance and attacked
again. Then, he used Under the Sky.</p>
<p>“You deal with Han Sen while I deal with the xenogeneic,” Sharon
told Dragon Thirteen.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Dragon Thirteen did not hesitate. With her lance, she
continued to attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the complex geography of the cave to evade Dragon
Thirteen’s lance. He drew her deeper into the tunnels so he could
separate her from Sharon.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen was very confident. The Dragon were known to be
fearless, and she above all was worthy of the title bravest. She
would never find herself scared by an Earl. She knew full well that
Han Sen sought to separate her and Sharon, but she was more than
fine with following him.</p>
<p>The lance was like a needle, and she turned a few-meter-thick
wall into a pincushion. There was no point in Han Sen’s hiding
behind any stone.</p>
<p>The Evilbreaker Lance was of the Yang element. It was the
opposite of something like Moon. If Han Sen had been a Marquise,
then the power of Moon would have been able to break Dragon
Thirteen’s body.</p>
<p>But Moon’s knife silks were unable to damage Dragon Thirteen. He
was at a disadvantage, and Dragon Thirteen was making him fall back
further and further.</p>
<p>Han Sen eventually failed a dodge, and it led to the lance
piercing his shoulder. The lance left a hole in Han Sen so small
that it would have been difficult to find with the naked eye. But
when the lance was inside Han Sen, it drilled into his bones. It
wracked Han Sen with pain, and he shuddered under its force.</p>
<p>Han Sen had failed to dodge because the effects of the first
lance strike were still in his body. The strike had hurt his organs
badly, and for a brief second, it made him freeze.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you have no chance. There is still time to concede.
You will be permitted to retain your life,” Dragon Thirteen said
gravely.</p>
<p>“You took the words from right out of my mouth,” Han Sen
countered.</p>
<p>“Why must you continue to be so stubborn? Give me the two
Beginning of Ancient Gods, and I will let you go. Otherwise, the
two hits delivered by my Evilbreaker Lance will only continue to
break down your body. You have to get rid of the damage.”</p>
<p>“Really? I don’t think that is going to happen,” Han Sen said,
but in reality, he was thinking about how he might be able to
escape from the situation he had found himself in.</p>
<p>With his powers, he could kill a Marquise. But Dragon Thirteen
was amongst the greatest Marquises alive. He would probably require
super god spirit mode to finish off Dragon Thirteen.</p>
<p>But there was the issue of super god spirit mode being a limited
thing. He could kill Dragon Thirteen, yes, but then he’d be left
even weaker. And there were three more Marquises, including Sharon,
waiting for him. That’d have him in an even sorrier state.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too tired already, and the effects of the lance were
doing a number on his body. He could not keep going on like
that.</p>
<p>“Whatever. I’ll kill one of you first.” Han Sen decided to use
super god spirit.</p>
<p>But before he could, his body suddenly shook. Something inside
him broke. And then, he suddenly felt as light as a feather. It was
as if he had been carrying a mountain on his shoulders, and now, he
was able to relieve himself of that load.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s speed increased. He easily dodged Dragon Thirteen’s
lance.</p>
<p>“The Sky Heart Lock has been unlocked!” Han Sen was exuberantly
happy. He had been carrying the weight of the Sky Heart Lock
through his entire fight with Dragon Thirteen. Now that it was
gone, the true extent of his power could be unleashed.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen cast many more knife silks upon Dragon Thirteen, and
this time, the bravest Dragon body was riddled with wounds.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so happy. The Sky Heart Lock was open. The speed and
power he possessed increased.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen frowned. Holding her spear, she said
incredulously, “A Sky Heart Lock? I did not know you were carrying
them as you fought. But even so, you cannot beat me.”</p>
<p>After that, Dragon Thirteen’s lance came towards Han Sen in a
mad flurry of attacks. Han Sen kept swinging his Blood Feather
Knife, too. When they came against each other, Han Sen’s body was
sent flying. He came to a stop against a sturdy wall.</p>
<p>“I told you. You cannot beat me.” Dragon Thirteen kept moving,
and she used her lance to attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The sound of something else breaking inside Han Sen’s body
sounded. The second Sky Heart Lock was broken.</p>
