<h2>Nothing Out of the Ordinary</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2194</h3>

<p>The highly corrosive power of that black water was something
like a whetstone. It looked like a grinder that could wear a
diamond down into dust. It whirled continuously just outside the
blue shield.</p>
<p>Night River King was confident in his Night River Beast God. The
geno art didn’t have overwhelming strike power like Yisha_s Teeth
powers, which could one-hit-kill almost any enemy.</p>
<p>But this corrosive and grinding power could destroy King class
weapons. Even a deified item could be reduced to dust if Night
River’s attack bore down on it for long enough.</p>
<p>Night River King didn’t believe Han Sen’s shield was deified.
And even if he did, with Han Sen’s Marquise power, he wouldn’t be
able to use it at max capacity. Whatever the blue shield was, it
wouldn’t last long if Han Sen’s rank was below the item’s.</p>
<p>This was the rule that applied to all treasures. Night River
King believed his power would be able to break Han Sen’s shield and
kill him. All he required was time.</p>
<p>Night River King only hoped that no other Narrow Moon elite took
notice of his actions before Han Sen was dead. If someone
interrupted, that would ruin his night.</p>
<p>Sadly, Night River King was woefully uninformed about the
differences between a beast soul and a treasure. A Marquise could
not make use of all the power of a treasure, that was true. But
that did not apply to a beast soul.</p>
<p>A treasure required the power of its user to support its usage,
but a user’s power wasn’t needed when it came to a beast soul.</p>
<p>Beneath the black water wheel that was like a countless number
of gears all spinning together, the Demon Bug Bai Sema was not
incurring a single point of damage.</p>
<p>The half-deified Demon Bug Bai Sema, when it shrank far enough
to only shield one person, provided a defense that could only be
defined as insane. No opponent could break through it unless they
were half-deified themselves. Only dust could be scraped off its
surface.</p>
<p>To those with King class power, its resilience was
mind-boggling.</p>
<p>“Night River King’s power is quite interesting. His attack power
isn’t the strongest, but it holds a strong corrosive ability. And
it’s shaped to create a grinding action, as well. It’s a pretty
smart technique.” Han Sen observed the black water that was
spinning like a wheel, and as he did, he walked forward.</p>
<p>The Bai Sema followed Han Sen’s movement, breaking away from the
black water as it went.</p>
<p>Night River King could see the mass of black water moving, and
the blue shield was becoming lighter and lighter as it emerged from
within. Han Sen was forcing his way out of the Night River Beast
God.</p>
<p>“What a powerful treasure.” Night River King’s face turned dim.
He watched as Han Sen broke away from the water with his blue
shield and walked away.</p>
<p>But Night River King seemed to expect this would happen.
Unhurriedly, he put his hand to his waist and brought out a black
blade. It was serrated, and its shape was like a crescent moon. He
lifted it and slashed towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>The spinning crescent blade carried Night River Beast God power
with it, too, and it was headed right for Han Sen’s Demon Bug Bai
Sema. The wheel power came against the surface of the Demon Bug Bai
Sema hard, and a flurry of sparks flew at the contact. A loud
screeching noise accompanied it.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how much force you can really repel,” Night River
King murmured.</p>
<p>The crescent blade sent out an unbroken series of slashes, and
the black water wheel came down on the blue shield again.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored it, though. He just kept walking across Planet
Blade.</p>
<p>Night River King had been very confident at one point. He would
break Han Sen’s shield before anyone else noticed, and when that
was done, Night River King would kill him. That way, the matter
would be finished. Even if it wasn’t looked upon fondly, no one
would bother raising an issue with Night River King’s deed.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen wasn’t one of the Rebate. He was an outsider. If
everybody hadn’t agreed with this fact, then they wouldn’t have
agreed to split Yisha’s legacy items up amongst themselves.</p>
<p>But the black water wheel that kept pounding the small blue
shield was not proving effective. It was like a ferry wheel,
grinding uselessly against the water.</p>
<p>Night River King created many of those black water wheels. A lot
of destructive power was now focused on the shield, but the blue
shield’s appearance hadn’t changed. Han Sen didn’t seem exhausted,
either. It was as if he didn’t have to use his own strength to keep
the shield up.</p>
<p>“Impossible! No matter what the treasure is, it has to be
feeding off his power.” Night River King’s face looked very gloomy.
But still, he kept attacking the shield.</p>
<p>And try as he might, nothing seemed to work.</p>
<p>Many giant black water wheels hit the shield, making the shield
look tiny beneath their mass and weight. After a countless number
of them were used, the shield was still there. It was unfathomable,
because that amount of corrosive power would have reduced the
planet itself to space dust. But the shield still gave off the same
blue light, unhindered and unharmed.</p>
<p>Night River King was causing such a ruckus that it was only a
matter of time before Moon Wheel King and the others took notice.
And they did.</p>
<p>“What is Night River King doing? Knife has only just passed
away, and already he seeks to kill her only student. What would
Night River King’s own student feel?” Moon Wheel King looked
grim.</p>
<p>When Black-Moon King saw this, he himself looked very dim. Then,
he smiled and said, “Night River King, you have abandoned your own
honor and tried to kill a student. But look at you: you have
failed. You are a complete and utter embarrassment.”</p>
<p>The few other Kings of Narrow Moon, witnessing the situation,
looked on with confused expressions.</p>
<p>They were all well-acquainted with Night River King’s power.
They knew he wasn’t the strongest, but if he had time, he should
have been able to grind down a King class weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blue shield was not even quivering beneath Night River
King’s unrelenting attack. The Kings had never seen anything like
it.</p>
<p>“What kind of treasure is that, though? It has that sort of
defense even in the hands of a Marquise?” everyone wondered.</p>
<p>Han Sen stepped off the surface of Planet Blade. Night River
King kept trying to kill him, but all his attempts were useless. He
couldn’t stop Han Sen from proceeding.</p>
<p>Rage and embarrassment warred across Night River King’s face.
Despite sacrificing his reputation in front of the other Kings, he
hadn’t even managed to mess up Han Sen’s hair. Shame washed through
him.</p>
<p>Night River King roared to the sky, and more black water rose
from him. His power exploded. His serrated crescent flashed towards
Han Sen, who was still rising from Planet Blade.</p>
<p>A flying crescent headed toward Han Sen, carrying the power of
the black water behind it. It struck the blue shield with all
force. The King class weapon kept spinning against the blue shield.
It ground harshly against the shield, emitting many sparks and
sounds. It lit up the entire sky.</p>
<p>Planet Blade was overtaken by the noise and lights, and all the
creatures fled as far away as they could. Only the King class
elites stayed to watch. Now, many of them saw the sparks in the
sky.</p>
<p>The elites stared at the light show in the sky, which centered
on Han Sen encased in his blue shield. Their eyes traced the lines
of the crescent with its black water power. They stood in silence
for a long moment.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Night River King’s King class weapon? Isn’t that the
crescent blade? How…”</p>
<p>“What did Han Sen do to provoke Night River King? What would
inspire Night River to attack with the serrated crescent?”</p>
<p>The sky erupted with sparks like there was an ongoing firework
show. The serrated crescent kept grinding. But the Kings could see
that Han Sen’s shield had yet to crack, and the jagged teeth of the
crescent blade were beginning to</p>
<p>The toothy crescent blade was going to lose its teeth. And even
so, it was unable to break Han Sen’s shield.</p>
<p>“River Night Beast God is failing already? It’s really nothing
out of the ordinary, huh?” Han Sen’s voice bellowed all across
Narrow Moon. He ignored the crescent blade and kept flying with the
wind.</p>
<p>Night River King’s eyes were bulging with fury, but he couldn’t
stop Han Sen from moving. He saw Han Sen leaving slowly, and as he
did, he felt a mixture of hopelessness, shame, and anger. A fire
burned in Night River King’s chest, making his blood pulse
savagely.</p>
