    <p>
      Outer Sky King’s appearance was rather similar to Yu Miao’s. He was a guy,
      but he was still very pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when people saw him, they wouldn’t notice that beauty right away.
      They’d sense a scary aura.
    </p>
    <p>
      By merely standing there, it felt as if he was above everyone. It was like
      everyone and everything had to obey and pledge allegiance. The world
      followed him, not the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Six Paths did not give off the strong feeling Outer Sky King
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen couldn’t retreat, though, and the crystal shoe continued bringing
      him forward. Still, he gathered up power in his Split-Blade and unleashed
      it towards Outer Sky King’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Outer Sky King swung his fist, it seemed to be done at random. But
      the whole world seemed to follow his will and focus on that punch. It put
      pressure on Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      The Split-Blade’s powerful cutting power and Han Sen’s own strength did
      not prove enough to turn away that incoming fist. Han Sen felt as if his
      strike had come down on a very soft and plush ball. He bounced away, as
      the enemy’s fist was still incoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no wonder he is the elder. He is so powerful. Han Sen was shocked.
      He used his Split-Blade like a sword, wanting to employ his sword skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sword skill he used included Ghost Sword and God’s Retribution’s
      skills. His swordmind broke through the sky. Han Sen was not a sword skill
      professional, but his sword skills were strong enough to be considered
      better than Six Paths’.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal shoe seemed to know it had a strong enemy. And then, it
      allowed Han Sen to control his body freely so he could fight Outer Sky
      King effectively.
    </p>
    <p>Outer Sky King, seeing Han Sen slash towards him, looked strange.</p>
    <p>
      Many spirits in Outer Sky had heard about the Endless Abyss Fallen
      Slaughter. He was powerful, and he was in the top ten on the super geno
      core leaderboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had only just scraped into the top ten. Compared to the top five or
      Outer Sky King, who once managed to achieve first place, he was
      considerably inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Outer Sky King was fighting, Yu Miao and everyone thought he
      would kill Fallen Slaughter easily. But things quickly didn’t seem quite
      like that
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallen Slaughter was fighting Outer Sky King, and the fists and sword
      skills exchanged were complicated. Outer Sky King was incredibly strong,
      and yet it was difficult to determine which of the two was winning. Han
      Sen was definitely not falling back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Weird. Fallen Slaughter uses reckless strength to beat enemies. How can
      he cast sword skills with such grace?” Upon seeing Han Sen’s skills, the
      elites from the Yu family thought it was strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallen Slaughter’s powers came from his body and the dark power he
      harnessed. He used physical strength for triumph in a similar way to Outer
      Sky King. The difference was, he just wasn’t as good as the emperor
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Fallen Slaughter was using a sword skill that was as good as Outer Sky
      King’s, and using a swordmind that was as powerful as the one they were
      witnessing. It was difficult to believe that this was the same Fallen
      Slaughter they had come to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is strange. What is happening today is so strange.” The spirits of
      the Yu family could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao was engaged in watching Han Sen fight, and the more she watched,
      the more her expression changed. The more she saw of the sword skills and
      the swordmind, the more she thought it wasn’t Fallen Slaughter—it was Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not commit to the belief it was Han Sen. If it was, it’d be
      truly terrifying. It was difficult to even begin fathoming that it was Han
      Sen going up against Outer Sky King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from Han Sen and Outer Sky King, the other fights about the shelter
      came to a stop. The army of the Wind Song Desert was used to their
      freedom, and with so many creatures all together in one place, they were
      getting confused about where they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they really hated Han Sen, so without thinking, they raced over to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The super elites of Outer Sky stopped their advance, though. And when the
      creatures realized the shelter and its occupants were as strong as they
      were, they calmed down and began stepping away one by one. Not many
      creatures remained there, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw what was happening as he battled Outer Sky King. This was not
      good. Even if he had strong sword skills, he couldn’t go against the
      entire shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, the timer for his transformation was limited. He couldn’t stay there
      for too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could not beat Outer Sky King in a short amount of time, either.
      He was fortunate enough to not have been beaten himself yet, but it was
      too late for him to back out of the fight now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen couldn’t let himself get distracted while fighting such a strong
      opponent. The first time he let himself get distracted, he took a nasty
      punch. He was sent flying against the palace behind them. He broke a few
      pillars before coming to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      His body felt as if it was being restrained by a phantom power. It was
      like his bones were tied up with string. He was now planning on using
      Destroyer Wolfs charm to aid him in the fight. He couldn’t think about
      much else, and he thought escaping would be the best he could accomplish
      right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen got up and tried to run, but after taking one step, the crystal
      shoe on his foot began pulling him back toward the glass palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Crap! Even if your woman is in there, you should hold on. Why are you
      still going forward in this situation? I will die and you might too.” Han
      Sen felt depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal shoe wasn’t alive, of course. And it could not hear what Han
      Sen had told it. It continued taking him back to the glass palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen still approach, Outer Sky King frowned. He was ready to
      kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he suddenly heard a flurry of katcha noises. The palace that had
      previously been shut tight was opening wide. The spirits of Outer Sky
      Shelter were shocked. Even Outer Sky King was, too. His face changed
      completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen continued running forward. He saw the gate open, and when he did,
      he heard a strange yet familiar sound.
    </p>
    <p>“Tap! Tap! Tap!”</p>
    <p>
      That was a strange noise to hear in such a situation. Han Sen recognized
      it as the sound of crystal high heels coming down on hard ground, however.
      It was similar to the shoe Han Sen wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt the crystal shoe then pull him into the palace at an even
      faster pace. The noise from the palace was becoming faster, too,
      eventually kicking up into a run to the outside.
