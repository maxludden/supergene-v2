    <p>
      &#8220;Huh, this Dancer is pretty good. He&#8217;s put Dollar in a pretty
      bad position.&#8221; Tang Zhenliu managed to secure a seat in the audience
      and watched the fight carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;His Mechanical Fist is fairly remarkable. He could be at an expert
      level of close-distance fighting. Very well done!&#8221; Lin Feng, who was
      also there watching, said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is it really that powerful?&#8221; Tang Zhenliu enquired
      inquisitively.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s okay. It can indeed be quite troubling if it gets
      close to you,&#8221; Lin Feng smiled and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you say it can be troubling at such a close distance, then it
      must be powerful! I wonder how Dollar will get out of this predicament?
      Surely, he cannot just keep dodging like that.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t only Lin Feng and Tang Zhenliu who had come to watch, but
      many others had arrived there in droves to watch the fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu was in the Alliance currently, and hearing about the fight with
      Dollar, made sure to come and watch. He was sitting in the stands and
      didn&#8217;t blink once as he watched the battle unfold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qian Hezhen and a few people from the Ares Martial Hall had also come to
      watch the fight, because people were whispering that Dollar was going to
      make use of Heavenly Go. Heavenly Go was a secret skill of the Ares
      Martial Hall. Very few trainees of the Ares Martial Hall would ever learn
      that skill, so it was only natural for them to desire to see it in action.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qian Hezhen invited the Queen to come and watch, but she lacked interest
      in such events and decline the invitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from those figures of prestige, many elite evolvers had come to
      watch the fight, eager to see and learn to what extend Dollar might use
      his skills and powers. Like the others, they were also interested in
      finding out whether what he used was Heavenly Go or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ever since Kill Dollar last fought in the arena, a lot of people had come
      to believe that he was a member of the Ares Martial Hall. After all, if he
      wasn&#8217;t, how did he come to possess the skill Heavenly Go?
    </p>

    <p>
      Dancer&#8217;s flurry of attacks were still coming on strong. In the
      beginning, people were shocked by the ferocity of his raging assault, but
      slowly, they came to realize that Dancer did not have as much of an
      advantage as they initially thought. Bit by bit, Dancer was being pushed
      into a corner.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How could this happen? Dollar was only dodging. How come it is
      Dancer who has been pushed into a corner?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollar is Dollar. Even without attacking he can reign supreme; he
      is too damn strong!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;This is amazing.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      The ordinary folk were shocked by how powerful Dollar was, but the elites
      had a strange look upon them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is the real Heavenly Go, right?&#8221; Tang Zhenliu pondered
      with surprise, turning to look upon Lin Feng.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like it.&#8221; Lin Feng spoke briefly and ended with a
      nod.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Heavenly Go? Is Dollar really from the Ares Martial Hall?&#8221; Yi
      Dongmu furrowed his eyebrows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qian Hezhen and many others had their eyes wide open. The excellent
      blocking abilities that Dollar possessed where indeed similar to the
      Queen&#8217;s Heavenly Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      But they knew it was impossible for Dollar to be a person of the Ares
      Martial Hall. The only evolver in the Ares Martial Hall was the Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Damn, just who is this guy?&#8221; Qian Hezhen was looking
      frustrated. He suspected that Dollar was doing this to deliberately throw
      mud at the Ares Martial Hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dancer was feeling terrible inside. He had been attacking all this time
      and yet he was unable to land a single punch or even brush his clothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t just that, either; Dancer had come to realize that the
      space in which he could move around was getting smaller and smaller. The
      powerful attacks he had were getting harder to perform as a result.
    </p>

    <p>Intimidation.</p>

    <p>
      Dancer was feeling intimidated. Although the opponent did not attack, the
      way he was dodging was forcing Dancer to alter his position. This made him
      think a lot more.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No. If I keep attacking here, all he has to do is reach out his
      hand and&#8230;&#8221; Dancer was getting scared. The way the opponent
      moved was quite threatening, and this was his weak point. Dollar was
      forcing him to change his skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people who were watching could observe this strange scene. Dancer was
      attacking while Dollar kept on dodging, without fighting back. As time
      went by, Dancer was getting more and more spooked. His attacks were
      getting sloppier, and they were sometimes cut in half in order for him to
      hastily reposition. The ordinary people who were watching thought it
      looked weird, having no idea what Dancer was doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real elites were able to tell what was so scary about Dollar. They
      really thought Dollar was using Heavenly Go, because no other skill could
      induce such an effect.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      In the end, Dancer had nowhere else to go and his back was now against the
      wall of the arena. He no longer cared much to attack.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Dollar threw a punch to attack Dancer&#8217;s weak spot, killing him
      outright.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That was too strong! He killed him in a punch; Dollar really is
      Dollar.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;The Dollar is real.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The level gap was too far; they were nowhere close to each
      other.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      People were discussing what had just happened. Many hopped into
      matchmaking in the hopes of being the next to go against Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Try it! See if you can match with him.&#8221; Tang Zhenliu also
      jumped into matchmaking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu did not hesitate to matchmake. Qian Hezhen and the people from
      the Ares Martial Hall were of the same mind, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did indeed decide to have another fight, thinking there was no
      point in leaving without warming up. He didn&#8217;t really care about the
      people who were watching, he just wanted a fun time sparring with people
      who were strong like Dancer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had learned a lot from Dancer&#8217;s Mechanical Fist. If he used
      Mechanical Fist to fight back, he didn&#8217;t think he would have been
      victorious.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you had to be well-rounded if you wanted to excel in combat;
      specializing in one area, such as the power of the fist, would never be
      enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quickly, Han Sen entered the arena. As soon as he was in, countless
      spectators joined to watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yi Dongmu?&#8221; Tang Zhenliu saw who had been selected to go
      against Dollar and was flabbergasted. He then laughed and said,
      &#8220;They really are inseparable! So many people are matchmaking at the
      same time but look who ends up being the one to fight him next! They
      really are meant to fight each other. This is going to be fun. I wonder
      how much progress Yi Dongmu has made in the past few years?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t just Tang Zhenliu who recognized Yi Dongmu, many others
      did so too. With wide eyes and mouths agape, no one expected that after
      all these years, Yi Dongmu went up against Dollar again.
    </p>

    <p>
      People who had seen their last fight were extremely excited, and they
      started screaming in anticipation. Those who didn&#8217;t know about it
      asked around, and when they heard of what had transpired, became just as
      feverous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan, who heard the news and quickly came to see, was streaming
      this fight. His whole body became excited at the prospect of those two
      fighting once again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;God, what am I seeing? Yi Dongmu! It&#8217;s Yi Dongmu! After all
      these years, could this fight prove to be Yi Dongmu&#8217;s much-desired
      revenge?&#8221;
