      Seeing the beautiful Lady Snake coming toward him, Old Cat thought through
      many different options very quickly. He couldn’t think of a way to get out
      of the predicament, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brother Han, didn’t you say we should find a way to get rid of her? I
      have an idea…” Old Cat said to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Xie Qing King laughed and said, “Sorry! We’ve changed our
      minds now. You are right, living is more important.
    </p>
    <p>We’ll run while you deal with her.”</p>
    <p>
      Lady Snake came close and ran into Old Cat a number of times. Then, Old
      Cat raised his paws and started to scratch the creature. He was so quick,
      though, Han Sen couldn’t even see him do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that close distance, Lady Snake saw the movements. Her hands that were
      covered by scales came into contact with the cat’s paws.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      A scary power blew a big hole in the earth. The dust and soil scattered
      everywhere, prompting Han Sen and Xie Qing King to take off running.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scary power kept on appearing behind them, driving Han Sen on in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this time, they were really running forward. They were no longer
      looping. Before long, they were at the outskirts of the ruins. They made
      it outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t expect the Fourth God’s Sanctuary to be a habitat for such
      extraordinarily strong beings. Not even emperors could fight them,” Xie
      Qing King said, as he felt the earth rock and shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Emperors are nothing to them.” Han Sen stood outside the ruins. It was so
      dark in there, but you could still see the powers wreaking havoc. There
      were only two creatures fighting down there, but you could immediately
      tell it was a bad battle.
    </p>
    <p>“Are we really going to just leave the cat?” Xie Qing King asked.</p>
    <p>
      “With the power we have, we can’t help.” After Han Sen said that, he heard
      a cat start to squeal. Then a scary power swiftly began heading out of the
      hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no! Old Cat couldn’t fight her. They are coming this way. Run!” Han
      Sen shouted, and the two ran away at an even faster pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Old Cat could get to them, though, Lady Snake caught up to him and
      he was re-engaged in combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Old Cat fought, he squealed, “Idiot! You think I can’t fight you? If it
      wasn’t for the rules, you’d be dead already. You better run while you
      still have the chance. If you make the cat angry, I’ll cook you alive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old Cat’s still spouting that egotistical crap?” Han Sen thought to
      himself, but he didn’t allow his legs to slow or stop. Suddenly, though,
      he felt something hot on his back. The heat increased until it burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t very happy about that. If something was now happening to
      his tattoo, then it wasn’t a good sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen turned his head and looked. The shadow of a red cat started to
      cover the ground, and it looked very oppressive and scary. It covered the
      entire area around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen, and the cat’s shadow gave him a fright-and-a-half. It
      made Han Sen feel as if he was as small as an ant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burning feeling of the Nine-Life Cat on his back was because of that.
      Old Cat’s transformation had triggered the reaction of his tattoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat did not have time to be tricky, and he looked like a beast as he
      tore off the arms of Lady Snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Snake immediately experienced immense pain, and she quickly wished to
      run away. But Old Cat was swift to break open her chest and pull out her
      beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “D*mn thing! You ruined the cat’s business. Now you die!” Old Cat screamed
      aloud, as he raised his claws to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Snake was then ripped to pieces, and not a complete bone remained.
      Her blood was spilled everywhere, and Han Sen and Xie Qing King were put
      into a state of shock.
    </p>
    <p>“The cat is that strong?” Xie Qing King’s eyes opened wide.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not say anything. Old Cat was strong, but his back was still
      burning and that worried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat killed Lady Snake, and before anything else could happen, the sky
      started to change. A black sun appeared above them, expanding in size.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a whirling black hole, getting bigger in the sky. And as it
      grew bigger, a force of suction started to manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scary Old Cat could not withstand the might of that suction power, and
      he was pulled towards the Black Hole. He used his claws to dig into the
      ground and fight it, but his attempts proved useless. The claws created
      drag marks that were a few miles long, but his body was still being pulled
      without reprieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suction did not seem to affect anything else. Not even the trees near
      Old Cat were swayed more than average, and it seemed only Old Cat was
      affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it wasn’t as if nothing else could feel the suction, and by now, Han
      Sen’s Nine-Life Cat tattoo was shining red. He felt the suction then, and
      he started flying towards it like a magnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen hugged the nearest tree to him, but the tree was pulled out by the
      force, unable to stop him from flying into the vortex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xie Qing King wished to help Han Sen, but Han Sen waved him off. If it
      could suck up Old Cat, then Xie Qing King would definitely have been
      pulled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell everyone I will find a way back. Tell them to be careful…” Before
      Han Sen could finish his speech, he was sucked into the black hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat was squealing all the way, but he could not resist the force. He
      was eventually sucked in, as well. They were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black hole, as if it had finished its mission following the
      acquisition of Old Cat, disappeared. And then, the lands returned to
      normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if he had been thrown into a washing machine. He kept
      getting rolled around, and he had no idea how long it took before the
      motion stopped.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if he had just been rudely thrown off his bed out of deep
      slumber. He felt great pain, enough to make it feel as if his bones were
      going to snap.
