	<p>A big electric storm was brewing in the space around them. All kinds of colors flowed, veiling the sky.</p>

	<p>A ship crew member ran into the room. He looked shocked as he shouted, “Mister, this is bad! We have encountered
		a giant magnetic storm! The ship is losing control!”</p>

	<p>Before he finished his words, the ship’s lights turned off. The ship was dark. They then felt the ship go
		sideways.</p>

	<p>Normally, a ship had a gravity system. Even if the ship flipped, a place like a cabin would still enable them to
		keep their balance. The gravity wouldn’t be changed.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt that the ship was sliding. It meant the ship had a big problem. The gravity was no longer working.
	</p>

	<p>The light was quickly in their eyes again. Outside the ship, the magnetic storm was so bright that it was like a
		window. The colorful lights went past the crystal-like windows. The inside of the ship was now a vibrant shade
		of hues. They were so bright that people could be blinded.</p>

	<p>No matter if it was darkness or strong light, Han Sen would not lose his vision. Through the crystal windows, Han
		Sen saw the light substance was a creature. It looked like a god dragon. Its body was traveling between the
		substances, but it showed a part of its body.</p>

	<p>“Break World beast.” Han Sen saw the creature’s presence and recognized what it was.</p>

	<p>“It is coming in fast.” Sky King frowned. He thought he had lost the one tailing him and would have had more
		time. He did not expect a Break World beast to come back so quickly.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had only just begun. Half of his presence had yet to be cut off.</p>

	<p>“Let’s just run.” Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to shield the ship. He wanted to use Galaxy Teleportation
		alongside the entire ship.</p>

	<p>Han Sen quickly noticed that the space there was weird. It was like it was being cut by some strange power. He
		could not teleport.</p>

	<p>Zhao Ning’er’s body displayed some weird notes. Her wings spread as she let out a roar. The sonic sound shook the
		storm away, but there were still a lot of storms raging around them.</p>

	<p>“Roar!” A dragon’s moan pierced the universe. It went against Zhao Ning’er’s voice, making her voice weaker.</p>

	<p>Zhao Ning’er raised her eyebrows. She prepared to use her asking heart sounds. Before she spoke, the substance
		storm started to fade. The ship drove away from the substance storm, but they were no longer in the same system.
		They had entered a place that had weapons in every direction.</p>

	<p>“Soldier Knife Sky!” Han Sen and Sky King’s faces changed. The whole ship had been taken to the first of the 33
		skies.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the others saw the weapon forest from above. There was a giant, dragon-looking creature hanging
		there. Its body was wreathed in electricity, and it glowed with a strange rainbow hue. The substance storm must
		have been created by that creature.</p>

	<p>The draconic creature’s head looked like a monster. It had long, red hair and three eyes. Its body was inside a
		shell. It looked like a man, but it was not a man. It looked like a bug, but it was not a bug.</p>

	<p>The weird man stood atop the rainbow god dragon’s head. He strangely said, “Han Sen, there is a way to heaven you
		are not walking on. Hell does not have a door, but you are knocking. To be an enemy of the God Chaos Party makes
		you a very dead man. Do you know how dead you are?”</p>

	<p>“Ning’er, protect Qiu Yi and the ship.” Han Sen flashed away and flew out of the ship.</p>

	<p>“I am going with you!” Sky King flashed and went into the sky.</p>

	<p>“So, do you mind telling me what your name? And, if you would be so kind, which position do you hold in the God
		Chaos Party that you serve?” Han Sen did not start fighting just yet. He merely asked the weird man those
		questions.</p>

	<p>The rainbow god dragon was a Break World beast, but the weird man was not a Break World beast.</p>

	<p>“I am God Chaos Party’s leader’s Shoot Shadow,” the weird man proudly answered. “Why are you blocking my way?”
		Han Sen asked with a smile. He smiled like an innocent bystander.</p>

	<p>“Hmph! If it was not for our leader having a big belly, he would have dealt with you already. You should have
		died a long time ago. Now, you have been interfering in the God Chaos Party’s testing scheme. We will not permit
		you to live a second later. Go and die!” Shoot Shadow spoke very grimly. He touched the rainbow god dragon’s
		dragon horns.</p>

	<p>The rainbow god dragon rolled up its body. The rainbow-like substance went everywhere across the land. Han Sen
		could no longer see.</p>

	<p>Sky King looked cold. His body had a weird power arise, but he did not go to attack the substance that was
		everywhere.</p>

	<p>While Han Sen wondered what Sky King was going to do, many weapons suddenly started to moan.</p>

	<p>In the next second, countless weapons broke space and arose. They did so like rain in reverse. They came up from
		the ground, ripping the substance in the sky.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at the sky, which was full of weapons no matter where one looked. He was given a shock. These were
		the Soldier Knife Sky weapons. The place had countless weapons available for Sky King and they exploded with
		scary power. They kept striking the substance storm.</p>

	<p>Many weapons were destroyed by the substances, but more weapons broke space and came for them. It was like their
		stream was endless. The substance storm became weaker.</p>

	<p>“Sky King can control Soldier Knife Sky’s gene weapon gene races.” Han Sen felt weird.</p>

	<p>Han Sen helped Zhao Ning’er escape the clutch of the God Chaos Party. The God Chaos Party had yet to do anything
		but touch Sky King’s life soul. The God Chaos Party immediately sent an old leader and a Break World beast after
		him. That meant Sky King had to be important to the God Chaos Party. He was likely more important than Zhao
		Ning’er.</p>

	<p>Sky King was able to control the weapons that populated Soldier Knife Sky. It made Han Sen wonder whether or not
		Sky King’s soul was special.</p>

	<p>In his past life, he was one of the eight generals of Ancient Devil. His identity was shocking. He might have
		even had a connection to the 33 skies. If that was not the case, it would be hard to explain how Sky King had
		the ability to control the weapon gene races that populated Soldier Knife Sky. In his past life, his strongest
		power was called 33 sky power. The chances were slim for that to be a coincidence.</p>

	<p>The substance storm was gone. The rainbow god dragon and Shoot Shadow’s body showed up again.</p>

	<p>“You do not have what it takes to kill us yet. If you want to kill us, you’d best go and ask Qin Xiu for help.”
		Sky King looked at Shoot Shadow.</p>

	<p>Countless weapons were aimed at Shoot Shadow and the rainbow god dragon. It seemed that if Sky King used his
		mind, he could tear their bodies to shreds.</p>

	<p>Shoot Shadow was not afraid at all. It was like he knew this was going to happen.</p>

	<p>“Lin Jin, I am afraid you have become cocky way too soon,” Shoot Shadow coldly said. He suddenly held the rainbow
		god dragon’s head. He looked evil and weirdly screamed, “Come on! Light Stream, let them witness your true Break
		World beast power!”</p>

	<p>With the roaring sounds of Shoot Shadow, the rainbow god dragon’s body flashed. It turned into a light-stream
		dragon spear that was in Shoot Shadow’s hands.</p>
