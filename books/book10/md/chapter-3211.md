  The young lady pulling the coffin let the chain go. She fell to the side and bowed to Qin Jing Zhen.

“Good. Good. Good. You did a fine job.” Qin Jing Zhen was so happy that he said the “good” three times.

One of the priests took the young lady away to heal while Qin Jing Zhen and the main priest went to examine the black metal box.

The rectangular metal box had no symbols on it, but the lid was different from an ordinary coffin. Normally, the lid of a coffin had one side. This metal box’s lid was on the side where the metal ring was.

A ring was positioned between the lid and the box. If the ring was pulled, the lid would open.

Qin Jing Zhen had no idea that the two servants present were Han Sen and Bao’er in disguise. He thought only his confidants were there, so he ordered the others to open the box via that ring. The ring was on one side of the metal box, which was not locked. The priests went to pull the ring and chain to open the lid.

It was different from what they had imagined. The lid was connected to something. As the lid was pulled, the item hung in the air.

Below the lid was a rectangular piece of ice. It was unknown how this ice had stayed so cold. It looked transparent like it was a perfect crystal. A blonde woman was encased in the ice.

“That is Wan’er’s dead body!” Han Sen secretly screamed. The woman in the ice looked just like Wan’er when she was blonde, but this blonde lady’s face was pale and snow white. It did not look lively. It did not look like she was alive.

Qin Jing Zhen and the main priest just looked at each other. Before they opened the lid, they had many guesses as to what was inside. No matter what they had predicted, they had not expected to see a lady’s dead body inside the box.

Qin Jing Zhen frowned as he looked at the priest and asked, “Is this the treasure that the alpha king left?” He had no clue how a woman’s dead body could aid him in ruling the world.

The priest was also very confused. He developed a wry smile and said, “The alpha king was a character like a god. There has to be a reason as to why he left behind this body.”

Qin Jing Zhen wished to say something, but he heard Qin Bai, who was still kneeling, start to scream. “She… She moved…”

Qin Jing Zhen and the priest looked over at the rectangular block of ice. There was nothing out of the ordinary. The blonde lady was still in the ice. She hadn’t moved.

Qin Jing Zhen wanted to ask Qin Bai something, but he immediately heard a “katcha” sound. A long crack appeared in the

ice.

That crack was similar to someone pushing the first domino piece. That one crack in the ice multiplied into many. Lots of them rapidly developed across the ice.

“Protect the king!” A guard moved to protect Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai. A “pang” sound was heard. The ice, which had formed many cracks, suddenly exploded. The dead body of the blonde lady did not fall down with the hailstorm of ice bits. She just floated in the air. Although she did not have a lifeforce, one could sense a golden wave within her body. It was the power that made her stable in the air.

Han Sen knew this power. This was the power Wan’er used to enter her blonde lady mode. It was bad for his Super God Spirit mode, as they always canceled each other out.

The priest’s expression did not change as he suddenly said, “My King, I remember. The legends claim that when the alpha king was born, he was no good. There wasn’t a single God Spirit willing to give him a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, but the alpha king’s real sister was blessed by God. When she was born, she had an incredible God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Because she did not want to see her big brother get bullied, she gave her God Spirit Blood-Pulse to her brother. Ever since then, the alpha was very powerful. From a nobody, he became the man that created the Qin Kingdom. It was all because of the princess giving away her God Spirit Blood-Pulse.” “I know that. The legend says the alpha king was unable to keep the God Spirit Blood – Pulse going, so the next of the bloodline was blessed by an Annihilation-class god temple instead. It never did come from the original alpha. The Qin Kingdom’s current God Spirit Blood-Pulse pulse is different from the alpha king. All of that is just a legend. No one knows for sure the validity of it all. Do you understand something, Priest?” Qin Jing Zhen finally understood what the priest was thinking.

The priest was very happy and nodded. “If I have guessed it correctly, that legend might be true. This is the alpha’s fabled princess. He left her body here and said it could help you rule the universe. Perhaps the princess’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse is different from that of the legends. Perhaps she did not give it all to her brother. Maybe her God Spirit Blood-Pulse can always be given to others, and that is why the alpha kept her body here. It was for his children to have too.”

Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes looked very bright. If he could get the legendary alpha king’s Blood – Pulse, he would be like the alpha. He could become a king that would shock the entire universe.

Qin Xiu had come close to ruling the universe. If Qin Jing Zhen received a Blood-Pulse like Qin Xiu, he thought he would not be any inferior to Qin Xiu.

Han Sen was not as optimistic about these prospects as they were. After all, Qin Jing Zhen and the others only knew about Qin Xiu from the books they had read. History books were not going to portray the Qin Kingdom alpha as an enemy. Let’s not suggest Qin Xiu was super evil, but even if he was, he would have been praised as a proper hero.

Han Sen understood the real Qin Xiu. Regardless of anything else, that man would have done anything for his sister, Wan’er.

Qin Xiu wanted Wan’er’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse so he could give it to his descendants. That was why he had set this up. Han Sen did not believe it, not one syllable of it. It was likely the other way around.

The gold waves from Wan’er’s body grew stronger. In the beginning, it was just like an ordinary wave of water. Now, it had become a gold fire that raged around her.

“Impossible,” the priest said upon seeing the gold flames around Wan’er. His eyes almost popped out of their sockets. “This is unbelievable. There is no sign of a God Spirit, and there is no scary gene race buff. It’s just her body power that is this strong. She is stronger than a Break World elite. What is the alpha princess’s Blood – Pulse power?”

In fact, there was no need for him to say that. Qin Jing Zhen was able to tell all of this as well. Wan’er was indeed very powerful. He was a king with an Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse and could use the strongest gene races of the Qin Kingdom. Even with all that, he could not match her might. “Just for her body to have such a scary power, with my Qin family’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse and gene races, who in this universe would be able to compete with me? Even the very high God Spirits would be afraid of me.” Qin Jing Zhen looked like he was picturing himself uniting the universe. His eyes glowed as he looked upon Wan’er.

Han Sen grew increasingly nervous. Wan’er’s power seemed stronger than when she was in the geno universe. She was far scarier here.

Wan’er was a good girl. In blonde mode, she could not control her will or her power. Even Han Sen had been beaten by her.

Han Sen suddenly thought of an incredibly scary possibility. “Hang on… Wan’er’s gold power goes against my Super God Spirit mode. Does that mean her power is a reverse Super God Spirit mode?”
