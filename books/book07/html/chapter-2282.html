<p>Han Sen and Yisha were unable to make the calculations to
determine the correct path. But instead of marching ahead
recklessly, they could follow the traces left behind by Mister
White. In the end, that proved to be a very effective solution for
navigating the palaces.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Yisha, and the blood kirin followed Mister White’s
tracks through each teleporter door. Han Sen was the guide.
Thankfully, they didn’t encounter any dangers along the way.</p>
<p>They went through a few palaces, and their journey remained
uneventful. It was an entirely safe course to follow.</p>
<p>“What is Mister White planning?” Han Sen wondered. He didn’t
know why Mister White was taking this risk.</p>
<p>It didn’t make sense for Mister White to believe that Han Sen
had the strength to stand up to Fox Queen. It also didn’t seem
likely that Mister White would leave a trail behind just to cause
Fox Queen trouble.</p>
<p>Using the evidence of Mister White’s passage as a guide, Han Sen
and Yisha made quick progress. It wasn’t long before they arrived
at the fourth checkpoint.</p>
<p>What they saw there made Han Sen and Yisha frown profusely. The
hall was half-collapsed. Broken pillars and remnants of a destroyed
ceiling lay strewn across the entire place.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked across the hall, but he found no hide nor hair of
a Sacred Leader statue there. In fact, there was nothing of any
remarkability there.</p>
<p>“It looks like Fox Queen managed to make it through this
checkpoint,” Han Sen said when he found nothing of interest in the
palace.</p>
<p>“I wonder what the Sacred Leader left behind here. Whatever it
was, Fox Queen must have made off with it.” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>The Sacred Leader’s items were all linked. If they were missing
an item, they might run into a lot of trouble further down the
line.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Yisha had no choice but to keep going. When they
went through the next teleporter, though, what they saw gave them a
shock.</p>
<p>They hadn’t arrived at another palace. When they stepped out of
the teleporter, they found themselves on the shore of an endless
ocean.</p>
<p>Under Overbearing was as big as a planet. It wasn’t really
surprising to see an ocean on such an entity, but the sight still
made Han Sen feel depressed.</p>
<p>Mister White and the others must have begun crossing the oceans,
but the ocean wind had destroyed all traces of Mister White’s
trail.</p>
<p>“It’s such a big ocean. I’m afraid it might be too difficult to
locate Mister White and the others,” Han Sen said sadly.</p>
<p>Yisha looked around. After a while of thought, she said, “This
could be where the Sacred Leader hid his treasure. Perhaps they
haven’t even gone very far, but they’re exploring someplace below
the waves.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had thought of this possibility, as well. If the
treasure was in the water, finding Mister White and the others
might be even harder.</p>
<p>“I guess we have no choice but to take a look,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>Yisha nodded and dipped into the sea. Her body unleashed a
purple smoke, and when the smoke came into contact with the water,
the water parted.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the blood kirin moved next to Yisha. They headed
deep into the sea, surrounded by the sphere of dryness provided by
Yisha.</p>
<p>Yisha’s purple smoke kept the water about ten meters at bay.</p>
<p>After they started their dive, they descended deep into the
ocean.</p>
<p>They walked a hundred miles beneath the sea, and in all that
time, they didn’t catch sight nor sound of any other creature. The
ocean looked dead. It was like a long-dead sea that was no longer
fit for any living thing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a giant shadow moved in the water. Yisha stopped and
stared at that giant shadow in the sea.</p>
<p>The shadow was approaching them quickly. Han Sen was given a
proper fright when he saw what the thing was.</p>
<p>It was a giant xenogeneic that looked like a whale. Its body was
pure white.</p>
<p>The white whale was more than a thousand meters long, and every
move sent devastating shockwaves rolling through the sea. Many
small vortexes popped up around it.</p>
<p>“Deified creature,” Yisha said quietly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect Under Overbearing’s body to be the home of
other deified creatures. I’m afraid that, aside from the Sacred
Leader, no other being could do something like that.” Han Sen had a
wry smile.</p>
<p>The big white whale noticed the three of them. After all, there
were no other creatures in that ocean, so their presence was rather
noticeable.</p>
<p>That was especially true of Yisha and the blood kirin. One of
them was a deified elite, and the other was full of blood air. It
was difficult not to notice their presence.</p>
<p>When the big white whale was a thousand meters away from them,
it suddenly opened its mouth and released a high-pitched sonic
wave. At the same time, its mouth produced a strong force of
suction. Many giant vortexes swirled to life within the water. They
snared everything within range and pulled it all into the whale’s
belly.</p>
<p>Wisps of Yisha’s purple air began to flow into that vortex, and
their sphere of air suddenly started to feel the force of that
suction. More and more of the purple air was pulled away through
the water, taken in the direction of the creature’s mouth.</p>
<p>Yisha frowned. She used her hand as a knife, and the purple air
suddenly gathered up into a large swathe of knife air. She lifted
her arms above her head and slashed towards the vortex.</p>
<p>The knife air became a roaring purple air demon. It was headed
right for the giant white whale. It broke through the vortex that
the big white whale had generated, but the demon-looking knife air
didn’t stop there. It continued on, going right for the white
whale’s head.</p>
<p>The big white whale showed no indication that it was going to
dodge the incoming blow. In fact, its mouth widened even further.
It looked like a gaping black hole. Its powers of suction
increased, and it swallowed Yisha’s demon knife air
effortlessly.</p>
<p>Gudong!</p>
<p>The giant white whale swallowed the demonic knife air whole,
then let out a satisfied burp. It then spat out some air and
created loads of bubbles in the sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen was dumbfounded. Yisha had just become deified, and she
was filled with hell power. She also had the Teeth knifeskills. Her
talents were famous among many races, and her wrecking abilities
were widely renowned. The big white whale, however, had swallowed
her attack easily. The power that the giant white whale possessed
was truly scary.</p>
<p>Yisha frowned. Purple substance chains rose from her body and
began to align in mysterious patterns. They created a purple knife
air around Yisha’s body.</p>
<p>Yisha’s entire body was now full of a knifemind. It felt to Han
Sen as if she was a cruel knife herself, that she could wreck
anything at any time.</p>
<p>Yisha raised the full extent of her power and prowess, but the
giant white whale still didn’t seem to be afraid. It opened its
mouth, and the black hole power returned. It sucked everything
nearby into its mouth. Sand and water came rolling in like they
were being pulled into a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>Seeing the giant white whale open its mouth again, Yisha coldly
shouted. Her arms swung at the big white whale.</p>
<p>The roaring demon headed for the big white whale once more,
dispersing the sand and shattering the rocks as it went. It left a
trail of devastation behind it.</p>
<p>The purple knife air and the big white whale’s black hole
collided with each other. The black hole was destroyed, and the
purple knife air was shattered. The shockwave of the collision
exploded the entire sea. Huge waves surged across its surface, and
it was like the entire ocean had been turned upside down.</p>
<p>The two strikes were balanced, though; neither had the upper
hand.</p>
<p>The next second, Yisha and Han Sen’s eyes widened. The big white
whale’s mouth was still hanging open, and suddenly, something flew
out of it. It wrapped around Yisha, Han Sen, and the blood kirin,
then pulled them into the big white whale’s belly.</p>
