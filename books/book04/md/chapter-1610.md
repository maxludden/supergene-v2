  “Blergh!” Han Sen coughed up some blood. The last punch from Outer Sky King had still caused him pain. Of course, he didn’t show it while he had his audience, as he had wanted to appear strong.

Han Sen hid inside an empty cave to heal. Before the healing process was complete, though, he heard a tapping noise. His face went slack with dread.

The tap-tap noise was fast, and when he looked towards the cave’s entrance, he saw a pair of Crystal Shoes. They were the Crystal Shoes from Eastern Palace.

Han Sen was afraid of those shoes, and he didn’t want to find himself being controlled by them again. As soon as he saw the shoes he ran, but it was like they remembered who he was. They pursued him, and the tap-tap noise followed.

“Why are you chasing me? Tell me what it is you like about me, and I’ll change that aspect!” Han Sen did not have the strength to run far. He placed himself behind a tree and looked back at the shoes in misery.

No matter where he went, though, he could not escape the tracking shoes.

The Crystal Shoes walked in front of Han Sen, but they did not attempt to attach themselves to his feet. All they did was follow him.

The Crystal Shoes came before him, but Han Sen realized that they didn’t want to control him. It was a big relief, so he was able to just ignore them and rest by the tree for a while.

The shoes settled next to Han Sen. Whenever Han Sen chose to rest, the shoes rested. Whenever Han Sen walked, they followed suit If Han Sen had not been able to confirm that there was nothing in the space above them, he would have believed the shoes had an invisible wearer.

Luckily, the Crystal Shoes did not want to control Han Sen. After he got his bearings, Han Sen was able to travel back to his shelter. He wanted to go back and find a way in which he might deal with the shoes.

Han Sen was in a rush to go home now, too. He didn’t know he had become famous in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, but regardless, everyone knew about Skysword now.

Running into Outer Sky Shelter for a fight, and then making it back out, was not something many had ever accomplished. But to top it all off, he was a human.

When Lin Feng and his friends heard the news, they could scarcely believe it. They asked around many times for validation, but it was confirmed to be the truth. Han Sen was Skysword, the one with Crystal Shoes.

They were chasing after Han Sen to help him, but they left when they got word he had already escaped himself. Little Star and Bao’er then brought them safely to Shadow Shelter.

“Boss, you are so good.” The whole Fourth God’s Sanctuary now knows that you are Skysword. Cheap Sheep looked at Han Sen in admiration.

Han Sen wasn’t in the mood to hear any such boot-licking, though. He headed straight for the spirit hall, wishing to return to the Alliance via the teleporter there.

Han Sen trusted those he had left with his family. He didn’t have to go back; he just wanted to get rid of the shoes. After all, they were in the sanctuary, and after he left, they shouldn’t have been able to affect him.

Han Sen walked into the teleporter, gave one last look at the shoes, and then left.

When Han Sen stepped out into the Alliance, he looked back at the teleporter. He was given an unfortunate shock, though; one that made his face turn green. For some reason, the Crystal Shoes had followed Han Sen out and made use of the teleporter.

“No way.” Han Sen frowned and walked back. The Crystal Shoes did the same.

“I’m warning you. You can go wherever you want, follow anyone you want, except for me. Okay? If this continues, I will bring you harm.” Han Sen pointed at the Crystal Shoes and went on to say angrily, “Don’t think I can’t or won’t do anything to you. I might not be able to do anything to you in the sanctuary, but the rules are different out here. I can kill you in this place. Do you believe me?”

The Crystal Shoes did not move, perhaps indicating that they did not understand him.

Han Sen turned around and walked. The shoes followed.

“You brought this upon yourselves.” Han Sen summoned the white crystal armor. Then, he reached toward the Crystal Shoes.

The Crystal Shoes evaded his lunge, so Han Sen used the armor’s power to maximize his speed and strength to try and break the Crystal Shoes.

But the Crystal Shoes moved too swiftly. Their speed was no slower than the white crystal armor’s, and Han Sen was unable to touch them.

Han Sen’s white crystal armor gave him a lot of strength. It gave him a power that exceeded the capabilities of a demigod. When he was wearing the white crystal armor, not even Outer Sky King could match his strength and speed. Han Sen was shocked to find out the shoes were faster than him in that state,

“What is this? Such a weird power and strength they have. And they can leave the sanctuary, too. This really is strange.”

Han Sen stopped and looked at the Crystal Shoes.

“Are these really made out of crystal? Are they crystallizer items, perhaps?” Han Sen thought to himself, although he knew he couldn’t be certain.

“Han Sen, what are you doing?” Han Sen was in his garden, and he had been busy chasing the shoes for a while. Ji Yanran came out of the house with Littleflower in her arms.

“I got followed by high heels.” Han Sen looked bitter.

“What does that mean?” Ji Yanran did not understand.

Han Sen pointed at the shoes on the floor and said, “I’ve been followed by these.”

“Those shoes are crystal art shoes. They aren’t implanted with an Al, so how can they follow you?” Ji Yanran looked at the transparent crystal shoes. There was no wiring on the inside to see, either. They were shoes, plain and simple.

But the style of the crystal shoes was something Ji Yanran really liked. She walked near them and pulled out her little white feet She wanted to try them on.

Han Sen quickly stopped her and said, “These things are evil. Don’t touch them!”

Han Sen told her about all that had transpired with the Crystal Shoes, and when he finished, Ji Yanran burst out laughing. She said, “Well, they didn’t do anything bad to you. Why are you so quick to assume they are evil?”

Han Sen wished to say more, but the Crystal Shoes then seemed to have heard and understood what Ji Yanran said. They went tap-tapping again, as if in agreement.

“These are such amazing shoes.” Ji Yanran was surprised.

The Crystal Shoes seemed to have been made extra happy by the compliments they received, and they decided to forget about tailing Han Sen and instead go for Ji Yanran. They slipped themselves onto her feet before Han Sen had a chance to react.
