<p>“Thank you for leading the way,” Han Sen said with a hearty
laugh. “I have already received the ice jade evil lady. I wonder if
Miss Tian also managed to retrieve the lost items of her
party.”</p>
<p>He could tell Tian Jing was trying to hide something from him
and hoping to do something with the ice jade evil lady before
him.</p>
<p>He could not blame Tian Jing for that. He had just stolen Tian
Jing’s opportunity. It was normal for Tian Jing to want it back.
They did things through power, and Tian Jing had not done anything
wrong. If Tian Jing did not want to kill him, that meant there was
danger. So, Han Sen did not plan on doing anything to her.</p>
<p>“I did not find them yet. If you are not in any rush to leave
this place, can you help me look for them together?” Tian Jing’s
face returned to normal. She tidied up her hair and smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and replied, “Maybe that isn’t such a good idea.
I am afraid your precious items will start flying toward me as
well.” He put his hands together and left.</p>
<p>Tian Jing felt bad. She was no longer able to remain calm. She
was mad as she watched Han Sen leave, but there was nothing she
could say or do about it.</p>
<p>“My party has been preparing for the claiming of the ice jade
evil lady for such a long time. No one could have expected the ice
jade evil lady to fly into a man’s hands. Fate is really funny… Han
Sen… I will remember you…” Tian Jing gnashed her teeth. She weirdly
looked at Han Sen leaving.</p>
<p>The way back was an easy route. Han Sen quickly returned to the
surface of the ice fields. He used Galaxy Teleportation to return
to the Feng family’s castle.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not wait to summon the ice jade evil lady from his
Sea of Soul. Han Sen was shocked that the ice jade evil lady
refused his will. She was unable to be summoned.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. This had never happened before. It did
not matter what beast soul it was or whatever gene race it was that
had been claimed. Once that happened and were placed in the Sea of
Soul, they could be controlled by his mind to do whatever he wished
them to. This is the first time he had been refused.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried it a few different times, but the results were
always the same. He was unable to summon the ice jade evil
lady.</p>
<p>“Stop trying,” the ice jade evil lady said. “You and my soul
contract put us on equal footing. I am different from how you
command other gene races. They might be slaves, but without my
permission, you are not allowed to summon me. Even if you summon
me, I can choose whether or not to fight for you. I can choose not
to combine with you.”</p>
<p>“In that case, why would you want to form a contract with me?”
Han Sen was not surprised. If the ice jade evil lady was willing to
speak, he believed he would learn something very soon.</p>
<p>“Your body has an opposite power to mine, and I will need your
power to accomplish something,” the ice jade evil lady said.</p>
<p>“That means you are not just a newborn gene race,” Han Sen said.
“You might say I am, but you can also say I am not.” The ice jade
evil lady’s response was weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen was silent for a bit before making a guess. “Do you have
memories about yourself before you were reincarnated?”.</p>
<p>“Pretty much, but I did not pass through the geno hall to
reincarnate.” The ice jade evil lady wasn’t planning on hiding
anything.</p>
<p>“Can you reincarnate without going to the geno hall and remain
in the same universe?” Han Sen looked at the ice jade evil lady in
shock. This was the first time he had heard about something like
this.</p>
<p>“I have my own way,” the ice jade evil lady coldly said. “You do
not need to ask me about that. Right now, my body is too weak. It
has been difficult for me to restore my former shape and strength.
I have no clue how long it will take before I can break the world
again. I cannot wait that long.”</p>
<p>“In that case, we should talk about striking a deal. What can
you do for me?” Han Sen asked his question as directly as
possible.</p>
<p>“I can lend you my power and fight for you like any ordinary
gene race,” the ice jade evil lady said. “In exchange, when I need
you, you need to do something for me and provide me power.”</p>
<p>“I think I should be told what sort of powers you will want me
to lend.” Han Sen looked at her with interest.</p>
<p>“When I had almost finished my evolution process, I was
backstabbed by a human and failed,” the ice jade evil lady said. “I
had to reincarnate. I want that human’s soul to be gone and forever
banished from this world.”</p>
<p>“Who is this human you are talking about?” Han Sen asked with
growing interest.</p>
<p>“I do not know,” the ice jade evil lady said. “I know him via
his appearance, but I do not know his name. I will be able to point
him out if you see him. If he can stop me from evolving, he cannot
be some random nobody of the human race. He should not be difficult
to find.”</p>
<p>n IV</p>
<p>“Good. We should keep going with the questions. What type was
your final evolution?” Han Sen looked at the ice jade evil lady. He
checked out her face.</p>
<p>“Reboot,” the ice jade evil lady said with a look of pride.</p>
<p>“Can gene races really evolve that far?” Han Sen was shocked. Up
until now, he had never heard of anyone approaching Reboot class in
terms of evolution.</p>
<p>Including all humans and every creature, it seemed as if Han Sen
knew only one Reboot-class being.</p>
<p>Even a guy like Qin Xiu would not have challenged the wrath of a
Reboot God Spirit. Now that he completely controlled the black
crystal armor, it was hard to say what he might do. With a cold
face, the ice jade evil lady said, “Yes. I only needed one more
step to succeed. It was all because of that horrible human.” She
looked as if she harbored a lot of hatred within her.</p>
<p>“The human you are talking about, did he look like this?” Han
Sen’s fingertip had a point of light on it. With it, he drew Qin
Xiu’s face in the air.</p>
<p>“You will have to summon me out,” the ice jade evil lady
said.</p>
<p>“Can’t you see it?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>“If this is all about fair trade, you cannot control me, and I
cannot control you. In your Sea of Soul, I cannot see or feel
anything out there. Without your summoning, I cannot leave your Sea
of Soul.” The ice jade evil lady did not hide anything from Han
Sen. Besides, these things could not be hidden. After a while, the
truth was bound to come out.</p>
<p>“This trade is fair.” Han Sen noticed the ice jade evil lady
mention the Sea of Soul directly, which surprised him. Aside from
those in the Alliance, very few beings knew what it was.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He summoned the ice jade evil
lady. This time, she was easy to summon. The ice jade evil lady
came before Han Sen. She looked at Han Sen’s drawing.</p>
<p>“That’s not him.” After seeing Qin Xiu, the ice jade evil lady
shook her head and asked, “Who is that human? From the way you have
drawn him, he does not look simple.”</p>
<p>This surprised Han Sen. Usually, things like this always
connected to Qin Xiu. This time, it was not related to him.</p>
<p>“It is good that is not the case. He is a difficult guy to deal
with. If he was the human who hurt you, vengeance would not come
easy.” Han Sen did not want to talk too much about him. He looked
at the ice jade evil lady and said, “If you want to co-operate with
me, let’s see what happens when we combine. Let’s see if our powers
can rip the world.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen summoned the ice jade evil lady. The ice
jade evil lady did not refuse his summons. She floated over to Han
Sen and combined with his body.</p>
