<p>“Why didn’t I think about collecting some gourds before I left
the Sky Path?” Han Sen thought with regret. There would be far more
than a single holy air in every gourd. He would have been rich if
he had collected a bunch of them.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was regretting his oversight, Han Yan had reached
the stone stairs that led up to Sky Palace. The words “Sky Palace”
were shining brightly, and the sensation was so overwhelming that
it was rather intimidating. It felt suppressive.</p>
<p>Dukes weren’t the only ones who would feel the strain of those
words. Even a King class elite would feel the suppression if they
began ascending those stairs. Most Kings wouldn’t dare to lift
their heads long enough to do more than glance at those words.</p>
<p>Many of Sky Palace’s nobles were eager to see how Han Yan fared
on her ascent of the stone stairs of Sky Road. Han Yan’s
performance on the Sky Path had surprised all of Sky Palace. They
were eager to see how she would perform in her ascent of the stone
stairs of Sky Road.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt now that she is Han Sen’s biological sister.
She is so strong!”</p>
<p>“Did you forget what happened when Brother Han ascended the
stairs? He had to be carried. I don’t know if his sister will
experience the same thing or not.”</p>
<p>“Brother Han was carried because he understood the two words of
Sky Palace and what they meant. It wasn’t because he was weak.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Sister Han will understand the two words of Sky
Palace and their meaning as well?”</p>
<p>“She collected the gourds like she was picking apples. She took
four of them. Understanding the meaning of two words won’t be as
difficult as taking those gourds.” “Yeah, I think so, too. The
crystallizers are likely to become significant once again, with
this Han family backing them up.”</p>
<p>As everyone discussed this, Han Yan reached the stone stairs of
Sky Road. Han Sen, Yun Suyi, and Thousand Feather Crane stood
outside the stone stairs. If something happened to Han Yan, they
could step in and save her.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried about Han Yan being crushed under the two
words of Sky Palace. He was worried she would end up like him,
understanding the meaning behind the words and allowing them into
her body. If she failed, as her big brother, he would have to carry
her up the rest of the way. It wouldn’t be appropriate for anyone
else to do that.</p>
<p>In regards to Han Yan’s talent, Han Sen was very confident. Han
Sen thought his family had many people whose talent exceeded his
own. He only surpassed them through his effort and determination.
That was why he could do things others could not. It had nothing to
do with talent.</p>
<p>Of course, luck also played a part in it all.</p>
<p>When Han Yan began to ascend the stone stairs of the Sky Road,
she quickly felt the pressure of the words. She slowed under the
sudden weight and had to lower her head.</p>
<p>“I’m not just representing myself here. I’m representing my
brother. I cannot lower my head while I walk up to Sky Palace.”
With that thought, Han Yan’s mind exploded forcefully outward. She
tried to fight back against the two words of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>But those two words carried deified power. She couldn’t force
them back. The more she fought, the more pressure was applied. Her
neck bone almost broke.</p>
<p>Her super god body opened again. A weird power covered Han Yan
once more, sending her into King Release Sky mode. Han Sen didn’t
know much about Han Yan’s super god body King Release Sky. He only
knew that it was a Causal-element super god body. And in regards to
how powerful King Release Sky was, Han Sen wouldn’t be able to tell
unless he fought her.</p>
<p>Han Sen had discerned that Han Yan was only able to collect the
holy gourds because of her super god body, but he wasn’t sure
exactly how she had done it.</p>
<p>Right now, Han Yan was using her King Release Sky super god body
again. Han Sen was paying keen attention, trying to understand
precisely why it was so amazing.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader saw Han Yan fighting back against the meaning
of the two words of Sky Palace. He smiled and spoke to the woman
next to him. “She is still young.”</p>
<p>“Everyone was young at some point,” the woman said tersely.
“Being reckless at such a young age isn’t a bad thing. Sometimes,
young people need that kind of drive.”</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader laughed and said nothing. He could tell that
the woman’s expression hadn’t changed, but anyone who understood
her could tell from the corners of her eyes that she admired what
Han Yan was doing. As they spoke, Han Yan was being suppressed by
the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace. Then, she suddenly
straightened out her neck and body. She stared forward and
continued walking toward the door of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The elites of Sky Palace were all confused, wondering why the
meaning of the two words of Sky Palace now seemed to be
ineffective.</p>
<p>“No way! The meaning of the two words of Sky Palace only affects
people and creatures the first time they ascend the stone stairs.
It loses its effect the second time, but this is Han Yan’s first
time. Why isn’t it working?” Sixth Elder looked confused. Something
was wrong. “No, it worked in the beginning, but then it suddenly
stopped. What kind of geno art does Han Yan possess to be so
amazing?”</p>
<p>“Brother Sixth, stop blabbering these questions. It would be
weird for the biological sister of a guy like Han Sen to be
completely ordinary,” Yun Changkong gently reprimanded the Sixth
Elder. His quiet smile spoke for itself.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong had agreed to take Han Yan at the behest of Han
Sen and Yun Suyi. He hadn’t expected that Han Yan would already be
so impressive. He felt as if he had just won some sort of student
lottery.Han Yan quietly walked up the stone stairs, and as she did,
the others of Sky Palace thought something was amiss. They were
quick to realize that the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace
hadn’t lost its effectiveness. It was working, and it was now
becoming stronger. As this happened, the words shone. If the Sky
Palace students looked closer, they could see that it wasn’t real
light. The brightness they saw was the waves of a mind that was too
strong. It manifested as a physical light, shimmering with
power.</p>
<p>The higher Han Yan went, the brighter the mind powering the two
words became. It was such a powerful mind. Only deified beings
could trigger it while they walked Sky Road. But Han Yan was just a
Duke, and she was already able to trigger the meaning of the words
to such a capacity. That was surprising.</p>
<p>Even more frightening was the fact that such a powerful mind was
still proving to be ineffective against Han Yan.</p>
<p>The mind was like a moonlit spring. Han Yan ascended the stone
stairs dressed in all white, like a fairy bathing in moonlight. Her
black hair floated in the shimmering moonlight behind her. Many of
the young students of Sky Palace couldn’t take their eyes off
her.</p>
<p>“I’m in love…” a male student said. He stared at Han Yan
longingly, while clutching his chest. He almost had stars in his
eyes.</p>
<p>“She is a true fairy.” Many of the eyes of young Sky Palace
students gleamed like hungry wolves.</p>
<p>As this happened, Han Yan slowly walked beneath the pressure of
the meaning of the two words of the Sky Palace plaque. She had
finished her ascent of the stone stairs. According to the past
experience of the Sky, the power of the mind behind the words would
now be reduced.</p>
<p>But this time, Sky Palace’s two-word mind did not reduce. It
exploded like a volcano.</p>
