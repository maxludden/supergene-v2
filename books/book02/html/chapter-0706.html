    <p>
      Where once there were only a few in the audience seats, now the stadium
      was jam-packed with eager spectators. They all stared down at the
      battlegrounds, waiting for the shadow of Dollar to emerge.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Here he is! Here he is!&#8221; A man clad in purple armor stepped
      onto the battlegrounds, and when he arrived, the crowd went wild with
      screams.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why is he wearing purple? Dollar is usually dressed in gold. Is
      this some sort of knock-off?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like him, yet it doesn&#8217;t at the same time.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen emerged onto the battleground not having researched his opponents
      nor read the forfeit guide. He only had to detect an opponent&#8217;s life
      force to determine how powerful they truly were. Even if he couldn&#8217;t
      tell, the devil ant king armor would keep him safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s opponent now entered the field. It was a pretty-boy
      spirit, dressed in silver armor. In his hand, he held a silver sword. He
      had bunny-like ears and there was an eye in his forehead. Aside from that,
      he could have passed for a regular human.
    </p>

    <p>
      People had already looked at Han Sen&#8217;s list of battlers, so they
      knew what to expect from his first opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The enemy was called Silver-Eye Prince. He was a royal spirit with a
      really quick moveset. In the analysis provided by professionals, he was
      one of the strongest foes Dollar would have to overcome if he hoped to
      fight against the Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Silver-Eye Prince checked out his opponent without saying a word.
      Then, he drew his sword. Like a sudden flash of silver light, he dashed
      towards Han Sen. At the same time, he unleashed a barrage of sword-thrusts
      towards Han Sen; there were too many to count. They came down on Han Sen
      like silver rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of people stood up, wanting to get a better look at how Dollar
      sought to best this silver-rain sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen did not move an inch. He stood and watched the silver rain
      fall without blinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver sword rain that came down was little more than an image. Han
      Sen had many talents, and before he became famous, he had already
      encountered this move. The fact that the Silver-Eye Prince sought to use
      this move on him was something Han Sen believed to be childish.
    </p>

    <p>
      The audience watched the silver shadows pierce through Han Sen. Their
      hearts pounded, and many women held their mouths to prevent screaming.
    </p>

    <p>
      But despite what they saw, nothing happened. Han Sen still stood where he
      was, unmoved. He just peacefully watched the Silver-Eye Prince prance
      about with his sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen raised his hand and used two fingers to catch a single
      silver shadow. And then, all the rain disappeared. Han Sen was left where
      he was, holding one silver sword between his fingers, three inches away
      from his throat.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the three inches might as well have been a thousand miles. Despite
      being held by two fingers, the Silver-Eye Prince could not budge his
      sword. It was stuck.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s fingers moved, snapping the sword. Then, he followed up
      with a palm strike into the Silver-Eye Prince&#8217;s chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the audience heard was the sound of shattered glass. The Silver-Eye
      Prince&#8217;s silver armor was smashed into little more than glitter, as
      its pale colors surrendered to the wash of blood. The spirit&#8217;s blood
      soaked the battleground, but he was dead before he hit the ground. Right
      before he crashed onto the floor, he disintegrated. He had returned to his
      spirit stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone who watched the fight had been petrified, as if they had been
      turned to stone. The supremely powerful Silver-Eye Prince did not stand a
      chance against the might of Dollar. The spirit didn&#8217;t even have the
      opportunity to fight back.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Dollar! It really is Dollar! Dollar has returned!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That is way too powerful. That&#8217;s frightening!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Cool! What nonsense were those professionals spewing? Didn&#8217;t
      they say Dollar could not break Black-Gold&#8217;s hammer? They also said
      Dollar could not defeat the Silver-Eye Prince. Well, take a look at that
      result. What are they to say now, huh?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Dollar, our Lord and Savior, is always with us.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kill! Kill! Kill!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Keep going Dollar! Show them spirits what&#8217;s up and become a
      Son of God!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy crap! Dollar really is still Dollar! Invincible as ever, even
      here in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Allow me to kneel before you and
      kiss your hand.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      A lot of Dollar&#8217;s fans were driven into a frenzy by the excitement
      of his most recent, sensational win. Although some humans had been known
      to show such strength in Divinity&#8217;s Bout, facing down Black-God and
      the Silver-Eye Prince and emerging untouched was an incredible thing. It
      was a very rare occurrence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, many people had never paid attention to Divinity&#8217;s Bout
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this fight, however, people were beginning to see a warming light of
      hope. They started to believe a human could actually claim a spot amongst
      the Son of God&#8217;s.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen exited the arena to wait for his next fight.</p>

    <p>
      Not long after, it was time for him to return. He didn&#8217;t look at the
      list, assuming such a thing would be trivial and pointless. As such, he
      didn&#8217;t know who he was to face-off against next.
    </p>

    <p>
      The person who arrived on stage surprised Han Sen. He never expected his
      next opponent was to be a human, and more surprisingly, someone he
      personally knew.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Queen? Queen is going up against Dollar!?&#8221; A lot of elite
      evolvers who saw the person standing in front of Han Sen were shocked. No
      one expected Dollar would be going up against Queen this day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time was short, and they had only briefly been given the opportunity to
      analyze the list. And in regards to who his second opponent might be,
      there were far too many possible matches. And there was also the variable
      of not knowing whether Queen would win her previous match.
    </p>

    <p>
      The list Hua Ping had formulated only accounted for spirits, and he cared
      little for the analysis of which humans might face each other. People read
      the list, assuming Han Sen would be facing either another spirit or a
      human called Huangfu Jing.
    </p>

    <p>No one knew Huangfu Jing was Queen&#8217;s real name.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is interesting. Queen is Dollar&#8217;s opponent. I&#8217;m
      not quite sure who will be stronger. It&#8217;s a shame Lin Feng is still
      on his mission and was unable to join Divinity&#8217;s Bout. His
      participation would make things even more interesting.&#8221; Teng Zhen
      Liu was shocked, seeing Queen square off against the enigmatic Dollar. But
      he still felt as if it was a shame.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teng Zhen Liu was hoping Lin Feng would be the one to go against Han Sen.
      Although he knew Queen was powerful, Teng Zhen Liu had to admit he did not
      know much about her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Queen versus Dollar will be an interesting fight, that is for sure.
      The Murder Dollar legend is Dollar himself, and he knows Heavenly Go,
      too.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s Heavenly Go or not.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is rather interesting. We&#8217;ll have a metric to determine
      how powerful Dollar truly is.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Who is Dollar, anyway?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      In the ice fields, in the royal-class Goddess Shelter, the Beetle Knight
      continued to take on the shape of Han Sen, like a doppelganger. It brought
      the little angel to observe the fight, and the people who had guessed
      Dollar was secretly Han Sen were quickly disappointed.
