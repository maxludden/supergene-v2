      Han Sen was standing in front of the headquarters of the company
      Impression Culture when the security guard saw him. He was wearing big
      sunglasses and a hat, with Littleflower in his arms and Bao’er perched
      upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have a meeting with your Chief Editor. Here is the appointment slip.”
      Han Sen handed the slip over to the security guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The security guard scanned the slip and then gave Han Sen a look of
      admiration. He handed the slip back with both hands and said, “You are Xie
      Qing King, the author of Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! I really
      love your comic. Can I have your signature?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I apologize, but I am merely his manager. Xie Qing King is busy, so he is
      unable to attend,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xie Qing King became a demigod a few years back, but there was no news
      about what became of him. Han Sen did not know if he was still alive or
      where he had gone, following his ascension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Han Sen continued to handle the matters surrounding his comics.
      Although there hadn’t been any new material published in the past few
      years, Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! was still popular. They were
      actually printed in physical, comic format, and a filming producing
      company had contacted Impression Culture with the desire to produce an
      anime and live-action adaptation of the work. Han Sen had come to talk
      about copyright matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brother Qing, I am so good to you. Even if you have died, your work has
      been immortalized. Your life and legacy will go on, even if you aren’t
      present,” Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t interested in these sorts of matters, but it was a personal
      matter regarding Xie Qing King. It might have been the last thing he left
      behind in this world, and Han Sen didn’t want to see it mishandled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The security guard looked disappointed, but he still said, “Please enter.
      The Chief Editor is waiting for you in the board room. An AI will show you
      the rest of the way there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen followed an AI to the discussion room. He made Littleflower happy
      as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran had been busy lately, so since Han Sen had some free time, he
      thought it would be good to bring Littleflower along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were worried Littleflower might have been affected by the time spent
      in the crystallizer’s Main Control Room, but nothing had seemed to go
      awry. Littleflower had grown up like a normal child, and at the tender age
      of being one year old, he could walk and talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even so, Littleflower was a very quiet boy. Unless someone spent time
      with him, he’d sit silently all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the board room, Zuo Lan frowned while looking at the screen. Before Han
      Sen reached the Impression Building, she had already been watching him.
      She was disappointed it wasn’t Xie Qing King himself who had shown up, and
      when she saw Han Sen had brought two kids with him to a discussion about
      copyrights, she frowned even harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan was not afraid of meeting with famous authors and superstars, but
      she was afraid of consulting with agents and managers. She was especially
      afraid of this one, as he didn’t look professional. He had brought two
      kids with him, after all. She didn’t think the discussion would go
      smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! was too popular, and after all
      those years, it was still in the top five. That alone could tell you how
      popular it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most comics that were still updating and ongoing were not as popular as
      it, and there were many investors interested in Overbearing President Love
      Luv Looove! due to its staying power. They wanted to make an anime and
      live-action adaptation of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chief Editor Zuo, why has Xie Qing King not come?” The middle-aged man
      next to her frowned as he watched Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Although Xie Qing King is an author for Impression Culture, he is
      freelance. He has his own way of doing things. If he allowed his manager
      to come here, that means he is the one who now has total control,” Zuo Lan
      said carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until now, no one knew who Xie Qing King actually was. Zuo Lan herself was
      quite curious, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan really loved Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! as well. Her
      mind was like that of a normal young lady. She’d love nothing more than to
      be loved by a man like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was also a little different from most young ladies, and she knew men
      such as that didn’t exist in the real world. She was smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you tell him it was Dong Te Film that wanted to discuss copyright
      issues? Our president is here, so isn’t he being a little rude?” a
      secretary-looking woman said, standing behind the middle-aged man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe he is busy, and as a result, he couldn’t make it here,” Zuo Lan
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What could be more important than this? Dong Te Film has a lot of
      investment capital.” The woman looked displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan smiled but did not say anything. She did not like how arrogant
      they were, but business was business. The copyright fee was rather high,
      and if the deal was a success, Impression Culture could receive 20% of it.
      That was a big number.
    </p>
    <p>So, even if Zuo Lan hated the woman’s attitude, she had to endure it.</p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t even say anything, and you’re just a secretary talking crap.
      You’re obviously just a b*tch who sold her body to achieve a modicum of
      fame.” Zuo Lan looked at her with disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were talking, Han Sen reached the meeting room. Zuo Lan turned the
      monitor off and let Han Sen and the baby inside. She was thinking, “This
      is bad. Such an unprofessional manager and a slutty b*tch all in one room.
      These matters of business will be difficult to discuss.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hi. You are Zuo, the Chief Editor? I am Xie Qing King’s manager. Call me
      San Mu.” Han Sen reached his hand out to Zuo Lan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan saw that he was holding a kid and wearing a hat and glasses, and
      she knew he had no manners. She still shook his hand, though, and she
      said, “Hello. I am indeed Zuo Lan. Allow me to introduce you to Dong Te
      Film’s president Yu Hetian. He would like to purchase the rights to
      Overbearing President Love Luv Looove!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hello President Yu. I am San Mu.” Han Sen reached out his hand to Yu
      Hetian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Hetian was on a chair, unwilling to stand up. He dropped some cigarette
      ash and said, “Why is Xie Qing King not here? Are you sure you can handle
      such big business matters?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not angry. He just smiled and said, “Xie Qing King is in the
      sanctuary, and he hasn’t come back yet. And I have total control over
      Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! I can represent Xie Qing King fully
      in these matters. You do not have to worry.”
