He didn't see Han Sen, so Holy Pirate was going to leave. Suddenly, the lady looked in his direction, which shocked Holy Pirate.

He was very good at hiding his presence. Even true god elites might not find him, so how was that little girl able to?

It must be just a coincidence. Holy Pirate looked more closely at her. She was a Sky girl who looked fairly weak. She did not seem to be deified, so he felt calm. He knew most elites in Sky Palace, so it was strange that he had no idea who the girl was.

Holy Pirate teleported in front of the girl. He drew a knife and placed it against her neck. "Do not scream. If you do, I will kill you."

If Han Sen were there, he would mourn Holy Pirate's mistake for three seconds. Unknowingly, he had dared to threaten God. Not many creatures in the universe would dare to do something like that.

God gently blinked as it looked at Holy Pirate and asked, "What do you want?"

"You just need to tell me where I can find Holy Baby. Do that, and I will spare your life. Otherwise… Ha-ha…" Holy Pirate coldly laughed. The light blade in his hand was close to God's skin.

"Do you really want to know where he is?" God looked at Holy Pirate with shock.

"You better be honest with me," Holy Pirate coldly said. "It will benefit us both."

God looked at Holy Pirate and asked, "Is that really what you want?"

"What are you talking about? I asked you, so you better respond fast. If you keep talking crap, I will cut off your tongue." Holy Pirate was annoyed. He did not realize that his annoyance was coming from deep within.

It was a shame Holy Pirate would have never guessed that God was occupying Han Sen's private garden. So he did not really think about it.

The feeling of being a thief made his heart feel really worried and tense. That is why he felt annoyed.

God smiled and said, "He is in Nine-Defense Palace."

Holy Pirate thought the little girl was a bit weird. Despite being in a situation like that, she was actually able to smile. Her sense of calmness was not like how other creatures would behave at a time like this.

The girl's life was already in his hands, and Holy Pirate's arrogance had consumed his common sense. He asked, "What is he doing in Nine-Defense Palace, and when will he be back?"

"He went to Nine-Defense Palace to hunt xenogeneics. He has been gone for days. I do not know when he will be back, but I should imagine that it would be rather soon." God answered the man much quicker this time.

When Holy Pirate heard the answer, he frowned. He had heard about Nine-Defense Palace before. The security of that place was absurdly tight, so it would be more than difficult for him to go there.

Nine-Defense Palace's restrictions would not stop him. When he looked at the deified elites that guarded Nine-Defense Palace, he knew getting past them would not be easy.

Holy Pirate looked at God as he asked, "Who frequently comes in here?"

"When Holy Baby is here, the maid will come to teach him manners every day," God replied. "Ever since he went to Nine-Defense Palace, no one else comes."

Holy Pirate was happy hearing that. "That is great. I will wait for him to come back. I will not be going to Nine-Defense Palace."

Seeing the girl was cooperating and not screaming her head off, Holy Pirate withdrew his knife. He looked at God, who appeared to be a girl, and said, "As long as you listen to what I tell you, I will not hurt you. If you do something bad, do not blame me for being cruel to you."

He looked around, but there was nothing particularly special about the garden. The girl was happy to watch the fights taking place on the geno god list. Holy Pirate was not interested in watching the fights. He took out a box of chess and asked the girl, "Do you know how to play chess?"

"I know a little," God said with a smile.

"Good. Play chess with me." Holy Pirate set up the chessboard while speaking with the girl.

"Sure." God smiled even more.

In Nine-Defense Palace, Han Sen released a long sigh and thought, "My deified genes have finally reached 100, but the fourth round of the god fights is going to start for me soon. I do not have the time to be a butterfly yet."

Han Sen exited Nine-Defense Palace and looked up at the geno god list in space. He looked at his opponent's name and sighed. I really don't want to go against her.

Yisha still didn't know that Dollar was Han Sen. She really wanted to beat Dollar and get her scabbard back. Han Sen thought Yisha might not fight Dollar, but they were being put against each other in the geno god list. Han Sen could not avoid fighting her.

"I guess it is good. I need to put an end to this once and for all." Han Sen was not going to underestimate Yisha. Her talents were extremely good. After she joined Sky Palace, she received significant support from Sky Palace Leader. Her practice had become exceptional. She even reached the fourth round. One could see how excellent her power was.

Han Sen looked at the geno god list. He perused another section of it. He noticed the people from Space Garden all lost their matches in the third round. It was not surprising. After all, they were only primitive deifieds. To be able to win their first two rounds was not easy. The enemies they encountered in the third round were at least larva class. For a primitive class, fighting enemies that were two classes ahead, which was the larva class in this case, was too much to ask of them.

Golden Growler was still able to prove his strength. In fact, Golden Growler had proven indestructible. He had reached his fourth bout. Aside from Ancient Thunder God, at the beginning of each match, his opponents threw in the towel and gave up. They did not even enter the space battleground to confront him.

Aside from Golden Growler, Han Sen saw a few familiar names doing well too. There was Bai Buyi from the Extreme King, Dragon One from the Dragon, and Zhang Xuandao from Sky Palace.

The Extreme King has many of its deifieds participating in the god fights, but why did Bai King not take part? Does he not want the god spirit's seat? Han Sen thought that was strange. Even Very High Leader had taken part in the fights. Bai King not showing up was quite surprising.

The Extreme Kings are one of the three higher races. That achievement was not something that boiled down to luck. "This Bai King is so mysterious. I wonder what he is planning." Han Sen couldn't find a reason for this.

Space flickered with light. It was now his turn to fight Yisha. Han Sen did not hesitate. He transformed into an adult, wore his armor, and entered the space battleground.

After reaching the space battleground, Han Sen saw Yisha was still standing in space. Clearly, she was eager to enter the geno god list's battleground immediately.

"Dollar, we finally meet again." Yisha's eyes looked very sharp. She stared at Han Sen.

"Knife Queen, why are you still hung up over that small incident?" Han Sen harshly asked.

"I am not going to stop until I die," Yisha coldly said.

Han Sen reached his hands into the air. A scabbard that looked to have been made of inky stone appeared in his hands. It was the scabbard Han Sen had collected from the Demon statue.

Yisha once said that the scabbard was a relic that belonged to the Rebate. From what Han Sen knew, the alpha of the Rebate was a woman. The knife mind left behind inside the scabbard belonged to a man, so Han Sen had been suspicious about her claim.

Han Sen had already learned about the knife mind inside the scabbard. The scabbard did not mean much to him anymore.

"How about we make a deal? If you win, I will give this back to you." Han Sen was holding the scabbard like he was holding a knife.
