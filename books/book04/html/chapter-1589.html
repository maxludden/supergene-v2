      When Zuo Lan heard what Han Sen said, she wasn’t sure if what he was
      telling the truth, but she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary could only roll her eyes and say, “This is a big business
      matter, and he goes to the sanctuary? And what is this attitude of yours?
      And what is with these children? Are you a manager or a babysitter?”
    </p>
    <p>Yu Hetian looked displeased. He didn’t like Han Sen at all.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, seeing them, had to resist the urge to laugh. He wouldn’t let Xie
      Qing King’s work end up in the hands of such people, and he thought it’d
      be wasted on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though Han Sen did not know much about art, he knew Yu Hetian did not
      know much about art, either. Han Sen wanted to do something good for Xie
      Qing King, but he wasn’t willing to give the rights of the book to such
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you smiling for?” Yu Hetian asked, sensing Han Sen’s desire to
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen laughed. “You might think this is a big business matter, but I’m
      telling you now that it is small. I decided that I could spare the time to
      come to this meeting, but if you don’t like the way I have presented
      myself, then let’s just shelve the discussion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Han Sen turned around and headed toward the door. Overbearing
      President Love Luv Looove! needed to be published, but he had to ensure
      those handling it were excellent. Even if Han Sen did not earn much money,
      that did not matter very much as long as the adaptation was done
      exceptionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan and Yu Hetian were in shock. They hadn’t expected Han Sen to say
      what he did. Normal managers wanted to earn money, but he was leaving as
      if he didn’t care at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Small business? Do you have any idea how much we are willing to invest?
      Do you know how much you will earn once the deal is done? You’ll never
      earn this much money any other way.” The secretary looked annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan stepped forward and said, “We are here for business. We can all
      sit down and talk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Zuo Lan and said, “There is no need for talk. Chief
      Editor Zuo, please find some decent people next time. I will only sell the
      copyright to people who can really make good films. If you only have
      people like this lined up, don’t bother contacting me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan knew things were about to get much worse. Yu Hetian really hated
      it when people talked as if he didn’t know anything. The truth was,
      though, he didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dong Te Film was rich, but that did not mean they could craft exceptional
      films. They weren’t even all that popular in the Alliance. Yu Hetian was
      one of the shareholders of Starry Group, too. Dong Te Film was initially
      constructed for fun, as something to support actresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wei Minzhen, the secretary, was one of Yu Hetian’s mistresses. She was his
      favorite. The reason he wanted to film this movie was because of her. She
      wanted to be the main character and earn fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Yu Hetian was just playing, he hated it when people suggested he
      didn’t know anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Young man, don’t be so reckless. If you continue like this, you’ll
      cluelessly walk by opportunities that are right in front of you.” Yu
      Hetian stumped out his cigarette in the ashtray. He spoke to Han Sen
      coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chief Editor, if there is nothing else to discuss, I’m leaving.” Han Sen
      attended the meeting to talk about copyright, yes, but it was also just a
      way for him to take Littleflower for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s mood was ruined by the way things had turned out, and he had no
      intention of talking with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zuo Lan wished to say something, but before she could, Yu Hetian said
      coldly, “Young man, do you think that if you leave now, Overbearing
      President Love Luv Looove! will never be sold?”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen heard the man say that, he turned around. He looked at him
      and said, “Yu Hetian, right? You talk big, but I’ve never even heard your
      name before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’ve never heard the names of the shareholders of Starry Group? How can
      you consider yourself a manager?” Wei Minzhen coldly laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know a few people from Starry Group, but not Yu Hetian,” Han Sen said
      and turned to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the other shareholders of Starry Group or the controllers of
      Starry Group, the Ning family, would treat him this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing Han Sen say this, Zuo Lan felt dizzy. Things were turning sour
      real quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Hetian was enraged. He slammed the table, wanting to say something, but
      just as he was about to, his phone rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Hetian was so angry that he almost destroyed it. He looked at the
      screen and picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Yue, why are you contacting me? I can do anything. I won’t
      disappoint you.” Yu Hetian forced a smile to the video stream of the
      on-screen call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image showed Ning Yue, dressed in white clothing. Ning Yue was still
      as elegant as ever, even after all the time that had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Hetian immediately became nervous, seeing Ning Yue. Even though it was
      just a video call, the respect he showed was nothing that could be faked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ning Yue ignored him, though. Ning Yue saw Han Sen leaving, through the
      video, and said, “Han Sen, why are you here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ning Yue remembered Han Sen. He recognized him, even though he could just
      see his back and he was wearing a disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ning Yue, long time no see.” Han Sen, hearing Ning Yue, turned around to
      say hello.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still tension between the two, so it was difficult to discern if
      they were friends or foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was going to drop by your house, but since you’re here, there is no
      need for me to go. My Second Uncle wishes to buy you dinner. Do you have
      the time?” Ning Yue said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Ning Yue said this, Yu Hetian’s legs felt soft. Rivers of cold sweat
      began to cascade down his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ning Yue spoke to Han Sen, Yu Hetian couldn’t muster a reaction. But
      when Ning Yue mentioned his Second Uncle, Yu Hetian’s heart almost
      exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      People knew the Ning family had an old man. He was a demigod, but few
      people knew that bit. They also had a Second Uncle. He was the genuinely
      cruel one. He dictated the lives of those in Starry Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ning family had become this famous, not because of the old man, but
      because of the Second Uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Second Uncle in the Ning family would only eat dinner with the
      president if he felt like it. He had never bought food for anyone else,
      either. This was a request no other demigod had received before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Second Uncle wished to buy the young man dinner, Yu Hetian’s body
      began to shake. He felt as if he was going to pee himself, as a cold chill
      struck him.
