<p>Han Sen thought, “There are so many princes and princesses that
are deified now. How many resources has this cost them? Have the
resources of the Extreme King all been depleted now?”</p>
<p>After reading it all, he made a mental record of all the princes
and princesses he would be accompanying. Bai King made it sound
like it was supposed to be a casual affair. If the princes and
princesses ended up dead, there was no doubt Bai King would be very
angry. It was not likely that Han Sen’s time in the Extreme King
would be as joyful as it had been.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to leave the Extreme King just yet, so he
planned on finishing this task. Plus, he was a bit interested in
learning more about the Starter King’s Land.</p>
<p>Bai King had only told him where the place was, but he never
said what sort of place it was. He had not described what it looked
like.</p>
<p>When Han Sen returned to the garden. Bao Ying was waiting for
him. Han Sen told her he was going to the Starter King’s Land. That
way, she would not have to go to the garden again.</p>
<p>Hearing that Han Sen was going to the Starter King’s Land, Bao
Ying appeared to be in a state of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem with going to Starter King’s Land?” Han Sen
wondered. He looked at Bao Ying.</p>
<p>Bao Ying shook her head. “The king must really love you a lot.
In the past, only princes and princesses could enter Starter King’s
Land. I would never have expected the king to give you
permission.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what kind of place Starter King’s Land is?” Han Sen
wanted to find out more about Starter King’s Land.</p>
<p>Bao Ying shook her head. “Only princes and princesses can enter.
Whatever happens in Starter King’s Land is never spoken upon when
they return. I do not know much. I only know that Starter King’s
Land is a secret place left by the Alpha King. That place was for
testing the mettle of the princes and princesses. It was for
choosing the one who would rightfully ascend the throne. Normally,
the better they performed in Starter King’s Land, the higher the
chance they could get the throne. But you are not of the king’s
bloodline. I suppose, no matter how well you perform, you won’t get
anything out of it.”</p>
<p>Bao Ying seemed to be trying to remind Han Sen not to offend the
princes and princesses.</p>
<p>“This will be interesting.” Han Sen stroked his jaw and thought,
“Why would Bai King let me go to a place like this? Is there some
conspiracy at play? Is something going on behind the scenes?”</p>
<p>No matter what the case might have been, Han Sen still had to go
there. He was definitely more curious about Starter King’s
Land.</p>
<p>The Extreme King’s Alpha King was Sacred Leader’s servant. What
he left behind might have been something truly special.</p>
<p>It was time for the rendezvous. When Han Sen was at the entrance
of the Starter King’s Land, the princes and princesses were already
gathered. They saw Han Sen arrive. When they did, they looked
confused.</p>
<p>“Good. Everybody is here,” Bai Buyi said. “The Starter King’s
Land is about to open. You guys must remember that Starter King’s
Land is very dangerous. Every time a group ventures in, princes and
princesses tend to die. Starter King’s Land only opens once in a
while and with a very short window. It will close very soon. You
will have to wait a month before you can access it again. In that
time, not even a true god elite can enter. So, you guys must be
very careful and help each other. If you do not co-operate, it is
unlikely anyone else can save you.”</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar coldly looked at Han Sen and said, “Second
Uncle, Holy Baby is not from father’s bloodline. Why is he allowed
permission to enter Starter King’s Land?”</p>
<p>Every prince and princess turned to look at Han Sen. They were
like Prince Swordstar. They thought letting an outsider xenogeneic
student into Starter King’s Land was a ludicrous prospect.</p>
<p>“This is a decree by the king,” Bai Buyi coldly said. “If you
have any questions, you can go and take them up with the king.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing what was said, Prince Swordstar did not speak
again. He just angrily stared at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders and did not say anything. He was
only in charge of keeping the sons and daughters alive. Han Sen
would not care if they got injured. If they were stupid enough to
fight him, he did not mind that either. As long as he battered them
around and did not kill them, all would be fine.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen was still in charge of recording their
performance in Starter King’s Land. Although he did not plan on
doing anything on the record, if they were really going to be mean,
he did not mind describing how dumb and pathetic they were. It
could heavily affect Bai King’s ultimate decision.</p>
<p>Most princes and princesses were similar to Prince Swordstar,
but they were even eviler. They did not show their distaste for Han
Sen’s company like Prince Swordstar did though.</p>
<p>“Your time is up! Please, everyone… Please go to the Starter
King’s Land now,” Bai Buyi said. He walked in front of the palace
and opened the palace’s door.</p>
<p>The princes and princesses looked inside the palace. They had
only heard about Starter King’s Land before, but they had never
entered it. They were curious.</p>
<p>Inside the palace, Han Sen many familiar pieces of
equipment.</p>
<p>“These… They cannot be crystallizer machinery.” Han Sen was
shocked. He stared into the palace and saw countless machines built
from crystal. They were all shining and strangely glistening. It
looked like the crystallizer control room Han Sen once visited.</p>
<p>Bai Buyi brought the group of prince and princesses into the
palace. He pointed at a glass container that looked like a machine
and said, “You guys stand in there.”</p>
<p>A bunch of prince and princesses walked into the crystal
container. That crystal container was 60 feet long, so 20 prince
and princesses were able to stand inside without feeling too
cramped.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been looking at the machines that looked like
crystallizer machinery. He thought, “Are these crystallizer items
the Extreme King Alpha used to have? Did these machines belong to
Sacred?”</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking, Bai Buyi stood before a crystal wall
that looked like a control room. His finger moved quickly across
the crystal wall. Each time he touched the crystal well, there was
a flash on it.</p>
<p>As Bai Buyi pointed at it, Han Sen noticed the crystal container
was starting to spin. The bottom was spinning in a different
direction to the crystal ball. This kind of program made Han Sen
think about the teleportation machines featured in the
Alliance.</p>
<p>The Alliance’s teleportation machines were not pure crystallizer
tech. There were a lot of restrictions, and they certainly couldn’t
teleport that many people at once.</p>
<p>“What is this thing?” Han Sen was very curious. He wanted to
know what the place called Starter King’s Land was.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a surge of magic go through his eyes. It was the
same feeling he had when using the teleporters in the Alliance.
When his vision stopped spinning, he noticed he was not inside the
crystal container anymore.</p>
