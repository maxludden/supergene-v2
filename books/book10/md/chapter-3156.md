  Qin Bai looked at Han Sen and Jia Shi Zhen. He did not understand the very high-level swordsmanship on display, but he could read people’s faces.

Han Sen looked calm. Jia Shi Zhen looked serious. She even had a cold sweat. By seeing that, he could tell which of the pair were winning

“Han Sen is so awesome. Even Teacher Jia cannot beat him.” Qin Bai was happy. He had the feeling one felt when finding someone to depend on.

This feeling was different from how others experienced it though. There were two types of people around Qin Bai. One type was the good subordinates that made him happy, and the other was like Thousand Mile Teacher and Teacher Jia, who taught him stuff.

Because he was not in charge of the kingdom yet, the officers around him did not have too much authority. They were just there to make him happy. They could not really sort out things for him.

But the teachers were too hard on him. Every time he saw a teacher, he acted like a mouse seeing a cat.

His mother died when he was young. Qin Jing Zhen was a good king, so he was always busy with work and did not spend time with his son.

When Qin Bai ran into issues, the officers could never help. He never talked about things with his teachers. They would not help him. They would merely tell him off. A person like Han Sen, someone who could support him, was the first person of this type that Qin Bai had ever met.

Steel Scene, Thousand Mile Reach, Teacher Jia, and the others annoyed Qin Bai feel, yet Han Sen was able to deal with them just fine. He even suppressed them. The confidence and power he repeatedly saw made Qin Bai feel as if he needed to lean on Han Sen completely.

This type of reliance was like a little brother depending on a big brother. Qin Bain was not scared of him. He just relied on him. No matter what he did wrong, he could always ask Han Sen for help. Han Sen would come and make things better for him.

Teacher Jia’s mood was not as positive as Qin Bai. She was in a place where she could not move forward or backward. Han Sen’s Calm and Calm made her unable to fight back, but she could not just quit like that. They were just frozen where they were.

“Dad, I am hungry,” Bao’er suddenly said with a blink.

When Han Sen heard her, he put his sword away. He smiled. “Mister Teacher, why don’t we stop here for today?”

Teacher Jia felt an immediate wave of relief hit her. The pressure was gone. She looked at Han Sen weirdly. After a while, she seriously said, “I lost. I will come and ask you for further demonstrations of sword skills another day.”

Jia Shi Zhen was no longer seemed as proud as she had earlier. Her tone of voice had changed.

On her way back, Teacher Jia kept thinking about what happened with Han Sen. She found it very hard to believe.

That very famous dog of Jade Wall City had such a powerful sword skill. In two days, he had managed to make that troublesome student, Qin Bail, learn a sword mind.

All of that that did not sound like the same Han Sen she had heard about from other people.

“Teacher Jia, the mister has asked you to come to the study.” When Jia Shi Zhen returned to the manor, Qin Jing Zhen summoned her to the palace. “Did you go meet Han Sen?” Only Qin Jing Zhen and Jia Shi Zhen were inside the study. The other maids and guards were kicked out by the king

Jia Shi Zhen nodded. “Yes, My King. I met him today.” “What do you think about him?” Qin Jing Zhen asked.

Jia Shi Zhen quietly said, “He is unpredictable. It is hard to grasp his aim with accuracy. Why do you ask?”

Qin Jing Zhen sighed. “He is getting closer and closer to my son. Ergo, I wish to know more about him. Do you think it is good or bad for my son to remain close to him?”

When Jia Shi Zhen heard him, she thought about it seriously. She did not answer his actual question. She asked, “Do you know where he came from?”

Qin Jing Zhen shook his head. “I have already had others investigate him. There is not much information to be learned. I only know that he is a villager from Big God Mountain. There is nothing else to be learned about him.”

Jia Shi Zhen looked serious. “I see. I think it would be best if the crown prince does not remain too close to him.”

“What makes you say that?” Qin Jing Zhen asked.

Jia Shi Zhen replied, “He is unknown, and his power is horridly strong. If he helps the Qin Kingdom and the crown prince, he will be a magnificent ally. If he does not help, he could do great harm to the Qin Kingdom. It would be best to keep some distance.”

When he heard her, Qin Jing Zhen nodded and said, “What you said makes sense. There is one thing about Han Sen I should tell you, and do not repeat this to anyone else.” “What is it?” Jia Shi Zhen looked surprised. Qin Jing Zhen rarely spoke like this.

Qin Jing Zhen said, “Teacher Jian is next to Han Sen.”

Jia Shi Zhen could not react. She was shocked. When she was able to clear her mind, she happily asked, “What are saying? Is it Jian Bu Gu, Teacher Jian?”

Before Qin Jing Zhen could answer, Jia Shi Zhen said, “It is no wonder this has happened. Han Sen must be a student of Teacher Jian. That has to be why his sword skills are so good. With Teacher Jian’s student to teach the crown prince, Mister Crown Prince will grow up to be a great man.

Qin Jing Zhen had a wry smile. “You are wrong, Teacher.”

“What do you mean? How I am wrong?” Jia Shi Zhen asked with confusion.

Qin Jing Zhen’s expression descended into being weirder and weirder. He looked at Jia Shi Zhen and slowly said, “Han Sen is not Teacher Jian’s student. Teacher Jian is with him. He claims… He claims he is Han Sen’s servant.”

“What?” Jia Shi Zhen was frozen like a wooden chicken. She opened her mouth wide and could not think straight.

Qin Bai did not stay in the Feng family’s castle. He was still afraid of Bao’er. Whenever he looked at Bao’er, all he could see was an angry dog. He wanted to avoid her the best he could.

After Bai Qin left, Han Sen played a bit with Bao’er. After eating dinner, he went off to do his own things. He wanted to research the positives and negatives of combine skills.

The reverse Cold Sutra did not have a suitable gene race, so he could not practice it. These days, Han Sen had already researched the core components of the reverse Cold Sutra. He focused on the positives and negatives of the combined skills. He researched them for a long time.

Han Sen wanted to use Night God No Moon’s experience to put his Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra together. He wanted to see if he could craft a power that might break the world.

After all, the two of them were different skills. Night God No Moon’s experience could be used as a reference, but most of the time, Han Sen had to depend on his own ability of modification.

Han Sen had to find a way to combine the negatives and the positives. His progress was not going in leaps and bounds.

“It would be great if I could find a gene race that was suitable for practicing the reverse Cold Sutra.” Han Sen started to look at the god fights.

If he was able to get first place in the god fights, he could earn a rare gene race. If the element fit, he could practice the reverse Cold Sutra with it.

Even if the element did not fit, he could use it for the Cast God Court or perhaps even match it with the Dongxuan Sutra or The Story of Genes. At the very least, it would certainly be of some use.
