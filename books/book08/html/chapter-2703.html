<p>To make sure he was seeing this correctly, Han Sen remained
where he was for a while. The craters that the giants had made were
becoming smaller and smaller. That meant his eyes weren’t going
funny; the mountain really was growing.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Han Sen was staring at it when he suddenly heard a high-pitch
sonic sound. When that sound hit his eardrums, Han Sen’s head
became all blurry. He clutched his skill and tumbled down. He fell
into the sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly cast a power to deflect that frightening sonic
power. He felt a bit better, but his head was still ringing. He
couldn’t completely block the sound.</p>
<p>Fighting his way back out of the water wasn’t easy. His head had
only just reached the surface when he could hear that sound clearly
again. He realized that the sounds were actually coming from the
metal pillar. The metal pillar spun like a drill bit, and the
patterns across the metal pillar shone with a weird light. The
lights spun with the metal pillar, carving into the scary giant’s
chest. Blood poured from the wound, splashing over the giant’s
armor and hair. The blood left red streaks over everything that it
touched.</p>
<p>Han Sen only now realized that the giant’s armor wasn’t actually
red. It had simply been dyed red by the blood pouring out of
him.</p>
<p>Blood had clearly been soaking into the giant’s hair for a long
time, as well. Only the upper-portions of the creature’s hair had
avoided the blood spray and maintained their silver-white
color.</p>
<p>Han Sen had thought the giant, impaled body was simply a corpse.
However, as the metal pillar spun, Han Sen could sense the body
trembling. It looked as if it was suffering unimaginable pain.</p>
<p>“That guy is alive!” Han Sen was in shock.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why are you here?” Han Sen was thinking to
himself. But then, he heard a sound. The metal pillar was still
drilling brutally into the giant’s chest, but with a thunderous
noise, the frightening creature turned its head to look toward Han
Sen. Its eyes peered at Han Sen through the unkempt hair. Although
the giant was only looking at him, it made Han Sen feel extremely
unsettled. The gaze was so intense that it almost felt like it was
burning him.</p>
<p>The scary giant’s voice shook while it spoke. It seemed as if it
was suffering.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t imagine what the giant must be feeling at that
moment. It would be worried if having a drill pushed into your
chest wasn’t excruciatingly painful.</p>
<p>“Who are you? And why are you here?” Han Sen flew backward out
of the water. He tried to put some distance between himself and the
giant, so he retreated to a careful distance before he spoke.</p>
<p>The scary giant continued to stare at Han Sen. He didn’t look
away. After a while, he said, “If you were able to come here,
shouldn’t you know who I am?”</p>
<p>“Why would I know who you are?” Han Sen asked, once he had
fallen back a little further from the giant.</p>
<p>The scary giant looked shocked, and then he laughed, “If you
don’t know who I am, then that is great. That means you don’t know
who Sacred Leader is.”</p>
<p>“You are Sacred Leader?” Han Sen was shocked. He looked at the
giant with sheer disbelief.</p>
<p>When the giant heard Han Sen ask that, he looked shocked as
well. He looked at Han Sen with a strange expression, and he didn’t
speak. It was like he was trying to figure something out.</p>
<p>When the giant fell silent, Han Sen asked again. “Who are you?
Why have you been pinned to the mountain?”</p>
<p>The scary giant gave Han Sen a conflicted look. He said, “I am
the Breaksky alpha.”</p>
<p>Although he was pinned to a mountain and enduring torture, the
scary giant sounded extremely proud when he said those words. It
was like the whole universe had reason to look up to him, all
because of that one simple fact.</p>
<p>“You are the alpha of the Breakskies? These giants are really
Breakskies, then?” Although Han Sen had already guessed as much,
hearing the scary giant admit he was one of the Breakskies still
came as a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>“Yes. The others are all Breakskies, too.” The Breaksky alpha
froze and asked Han Sen, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Han Sen. I am a nobody crystallizer,” Han Sen said, trying to
be polite.</p>
<p>“Since when have the crystallizers developed bodies like yours?”
The Breakskies alpha looked at Han Sen, but his face was impassive,
and his thoughts remained hidden.</p>
<p>“I think you have been locked up for too long, and as a result,
you don’t know what has been going on in the wider world outside.
The crystallizers are different these days.” Han Sen then cocked
his head to the side and asked. “Why are you locked up here? Why
aren’t your people saving you?”</p>
<p>“You are right. This is no longer the era of the Breakskies.”
The Breaksky alpha sighed and said, “If they hadn’t tried to save
me, they wouldn’t be locked up here forever and forced to dig
through a mountain each and every day.”</p>
<p>“Who was able to trap you here? Was it Sacred Leader?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>The Breaksky alpha had mentioned Sacred Leader earlier, so
perhaps there was a connection between the two of them.</p>
<p>Breaksky alpha shook his head. He started to say something more,
but then his expression changed. He told Han Sen, “Quick! Hide in
my hair or you will be dead.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had already noticed that something wasn’t right. Even
the black crystal armor was releasing a sense indicating imminent
danger. The Breaksky alpha wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body flashed away. He flew up to the alpha’s shoulder,
then climbed into the giant’s hair.</p>
<p>“No matter what happens, you cannot release a single speck of
your presence,” the Breaksky alpha murmured. He stopped talking and
turned to stare coldly up into the sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen buried himself in the giant’s hair and reduced the sense
of his presence. The black crystal armor released some weird sort
of power that locked down his body. Han Sen’s aura vanished until
he couldn’t even detect his own presence.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen felt a ripple flow through the space above
them. Han Sen looked into the sky, and he saw something emerging
from the area next to the sun-clock.</p>
<p>When he saw the shape of the descending body, Han Sen almost
screamed. It was King Jun, the being he had seen on Planet Eclipse
long ago. After he was injured, Han Sen hadn’t seen him again. He
couldn’t believe he was seeing him again here, of all places.</p>
<p>“Horizontal Evil, have you given this some thought?” King Jun
was wearing gold armor and a gold helmet. He looked like a god-king
in the sky. His eyes were like lightning as they looked at the
scary giant.</p>
<p>“It looks like your wounds have almost healed, and yet you have
time to waste here every day. If you have so much time, why don’t
you try to find out who attacked you and made you like this?” the
scary giant said.</p>
<p>Rather than being angered, King Jun replied with a voice full of
cool spite. “Horizontal Evil, do you really want to be trapped here
for all eternity? Do you want to see your people try to save you
without rest?”</p>
