<h3>Chapter 2616</h3>

<p>As everyone watched in confusion, the meaning of the two words
of Sky Palace exploded, and something flew out into the air.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Han Sen was shocked. He looked at Yun Suyi,
never having heard of anything like this happening before.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t know…” Yun Suyi was just as stunned as the rest. She
had never heard of a physical item emerging from the sign that held
the words of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>All the rest of the Sky were amazed, as well. The last thing
they had expected was for an object to fly out of that sign. They
stared at it blankly.</p>
<p>The thing that flew out of the sign looked like an elephant. It
was white like jade, but only one foot long. The elephant’s tusks
appeared to be made of crystal.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at that small elephant in befuddlement. They had
no idea why it had suddenly appeared there.</p>
<p>The defensive systems of Sky Palace were rock-solid. It would be
impossible for them to be unaware of a xenogeneic hiding out inside
that big sign.</p>
<p>The small white elephant flew over until it was right in front
of Han Yan. It then expanded, growing to the size of a mammoth.</p>
<p>Strangely, after the white elephant appeared, the meaning behind
the two words of Sky Palace disappeared. The sign went back to
normal.</p>
<p>The white elephant reached out its trunk and wrapped it around
Han Yan’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s muscles tensed. He thought the white elephant was
going to harm his sister, and he leaped forward. After he took a
step forward, though, he realized that the white elephant was just
lifting her up to sit on its back.</p>
<p>Once Han Yan was astride its back, the white elephant turned
around and headed deeper into Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Seeing that the elephant wasn’t a threat, Han Sen felt instantly
relieved. But still, he made sure to follow closely behind them.
Many Sky elders also hurried forward to examine the strange white
elephant as it walked farther into Sky Palace.</p>
<p>It was so weird. No one had known that the Sky Palace sign had a
white elephant hiding out in it. The situation was so odd that it
was hard to believe.</p>
<p>Even Sky Palace Leader came down for a closer look. He ransacked
his mind for an explanation of where the white elephant had come
from, but he couldn’t come up with one.</p>
<p>Just by feeling the white elephant’s presence, he could tell
that it was a deified creature. A deified creature had been hiding
out in that sign, and no one in Sky Palace had known. That was
simply embarrassing for the other deifieds inside Sky Palace.</p>
<p>But they knew immediately that the white elephant must have a
long history with Sky Palace, so no one tried to attack it. They
followed the white elephant, keen to see what it might do.</p>
<p>“Mister Leader, what is this White Elephant?” Han Sen was still
worried about Han Yan, and so he asked Sky Palace Leader once the
man arrived.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I will assure her safety. I won’t allow her to get
hurt,” Sky Palace Leader said as he continued to walk.</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard him say that, he relaxed a little, but he
still didn’t feel calm. He felt even more worried. That was because
it sounded as if not even Sky Palace Leader understood what the
white elephant was and where it had come from.</p>
<p>Although this entire scenario sounded a bit unbelievable-in
which a deified creature had resided in Sky Palace without anyone
knowing about its existence—this was actually happening.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and followed the white elephant. The
white elephant showed no sign of being hostile, though. And it was
moving forward at a rather slow pace. Han Yan looked down,
observing her mount quizzically. While she was surprised to find
herself atop its back, she hadn’t been hurt in any way.</p>
<p>“Little Yan, are you okay?” Han Sen asked as he followed the
white elephant.</p>
<p>“I’m okay. Is this some sort of induction ceremony for Sky
Palace?” Han Yan asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Can you get off its back?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Do you want me to come down?” Han Yan asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, come down for now,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Han Yan flew off of the white elephant’s back. But as soon as
she broke contact with the creature, the white elephant’s trunk
snatched her and made her sit down again.</p>
<p>The white elephant didn’t hurt her, however. It placed her down
gently and resumed its walk.</p>
<p>“Let her sit there for now. I promise not an ounce of harm will
befall a single hair on her pretty head,” Sky Palace Leader said
with a squint of his eyes.</p>
<p>A white elephant had flown out of the Sky Palace sign. That was
mysterious, to say the least. All of the Sky Palace students
thought this was amazing, and they were curious about what the
white elephant was.</p>
<p>But most of the students were eventually stopped and prohibited
from following the white elephant. Only the elders and other
leaders of Sky Palace were allowed to follow beyond that point.</p>
<p>The white elephant carried Han Yan through the Sky Palace hall.
Then, they came to the gardens of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>This was where the rulers of Sky Palace had lived down through
history. Now, it belonged to the man who was walking next to Han
Sen. Ordinary people weren’t permitted entry.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others followed the white elephant in. It was
like a natural garden, with mountains and the smell of grass. It
was like a fairy’s grove. Rare xenogeneic plants were scattered
about here and there. Just the sight of them made Han Sen want to
get out his knife and start cutting</p>
<p>The big white elephant carried Han Yan to the back of the
garden. They went to a wall with a small pond beside it. The wall
had two words that were roughly engraved: “Outer Sky.”</p>
<p>Those two words were jaggedly carved. Even though Han Sen didn’t
know much about calligraphy, he knew those words had been written
by a young man.</p>
<p>But how could a young man have made an inscription in this
place? That was where the rulers of Sky Palace rested. Other people
weren’t permitted entry, and they surely couldn’t leave evidence of
their presence.</p>
<p>The white elephant walked in front of the mountain wall, then
lowered its trunk into the water. As the water swirled around its
trunk, the elephant seemed to be feeling around for something.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the big white elephant, having no idea what
it was doing. After a while, the white elephant lifted its trunk
from the water. It was holding something. The object was a box made
of jade, and it was a foot long. The onlookers glanced at each
other, unsure what the appearance of this random box signified.Sky
Palace Leader looked at the jade box and frowned. He had an idea of
what the box might be, but he wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>The white elephant lifted its trunk and passed the jade box to
Han Yan. And then, it lay down next to the pond and closed its
eyes. It looked as if it had gone to sleep.</p>
<p>“Han Yan, come over here,” Sky Palace Leader said to Han Yan,
who had just received that box.</p>
<p>Han Yan saw Han Sen nodding. So, she got off of the white
elephant. This time, the white elephant didn’t respond. It allowed
Han Yan to move away with the box in her hands.</p>
<p>“Open the box,” Sky Palace Leader told Han Yan.</p>
<p>“Palace Leader, will there be danger inside the jade box?” Han
Sen asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“No.” Sky Palace Leader shook his head, a strange expression on
his face.</p>
<p>“Is this…” Yun Changkong’s face changed. He seemed to come to a
realization, and he looked at the jade box in astonishment.</p>
