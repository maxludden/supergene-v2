  After God said he was leaving, he left. Han Sen was a little worried. He thought Little Gold Gold might get bullied because of his relationship with God.

Han Sen knew there was no point in worrying. He just wanted to quickly level up, become true god, and enter the geno hall.

He researched ways he might infiltrate the Buddha. He was trying to get the knife back and revenge on Burning Lamp. The knife’s power would be a big boon to Han Sen. It was a weapon designed to help weaker beings wins. He thought it might prove useful inside the geno hall.

From the data Han Sen had collected, the elites who had entered the geno hall throughout history all had a true god weapon. Plus, from Han Sen’s experience battling God Spirits, true god class power did affect the God Spirits.

Any power below true god class did not do any damage to the gods. They were almost entirely useless. That was why Han Sen wanted to become true god class first. It would enable him to enter the geno hall.

“One of the sheep heads on the Four Sheep Cube leads to where Horizontal Evil was suppressed. One of them goes to God’s Farm, and another leads to a place where many scary xenogeneics were gathered. I wonder where the last place goes. If I use the Four Sheep Cube to teleport and travel with Han Sen’s identity, I do not think even God could find me.” After Han Sen thought of that, he decided to do it.

In the past, he was a bit scared of where the Four Sheep Cube sent him to. With his current level of power, he was no weaker than a true god class. Plus, he had Space Teleportation, so he did not have to worry too much.

Han Sen had not wanted to use Space Teleportation before because he was afraid God had a way to track his Space Teleportation. Four Sheep Cube’s teleportation, however, was almost untraceable. Han Sen knew the way it teleported him was different from any other kind of teleportation power. It was difficult to break.

Han Sen only needed the Four Sheep Cube teleportation power to slip away. Afterward, he would be able to get rid of his xenogeneic mode and look like Han Sen again. No one was going to think he was Dollar. Then, he would use Space Teleportation to go wherever he wanted.

Han Sen went to the Nine-Defense Palace and selected a room that had no xenogeneic in it. After he pressed the restrictions, he used his Dongxuan Aura to hide all of the spinning universal cogwheels. He then took out his Four Sheep Cube and activated the final sheep head.

The black and white goldfish spun fast. They brought Han Sen into the Four Sheep Cube. When he crawled outside of the Four Sheep Cube again, he was no longer in his xenogeneic mode. He looked like Han Sen again. Han Sen was very alert. He looked around, but he did not see any scary xenogeneics. All he saw was a void in space. Not far from it, he saw a palace that was bigger than a star. That palace was like a big black beast lurking in space. It was made of metal and looked horrendously cold.

The palace also looked like it was in disarray. Much of it had crumbled. It looked a little old. It was like a junkyard for machines.

Han Sen did not sense any creatures nearby, so he flew toward the palace. He wanted to see what sort of place it was. Even if he used Galaxy Teleportation, he needed to know in which direction to head. Right now, he had no idea where in the universe he was.

Han Sen quickly approached the metal palace. When he had a closer look at it, the place looked broken. Many giant cracks webbed around the metal construct. It was like the claws of some giant beast had ripped it.

Luckily, the door of the metal palace was complete. Han Sen saw two words written there: “Metal Temple.”

“Temple… Does that mean this place is somewhere inside the geno hall?” Han Sen was shocked. He had not expected it to be a temple.

Han Sen thought, “No way. This is the universe. It is different from the space where Sky Vine Radish Temple was. Perhaps I have thought too much. Perhaps this metal temple is not that kind of temple.” He used the Dongxuan Aura to scan the metal temple. If this place was that sort of temple, there was sure to be a God Spirit on the inside.

Han Sen felt instantly relieved. He used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the temple. He did not find any life forces there or see signs of any creature that resembled a God Spirit.

“That is what I am talking about. It cannot be that kind of temple.” Han Sen pushed the door and walked into the metal temple. There was a lot of broken metal inside. The palace was bigger than a planet. He was not able to see a complete portion of the building. It was hard to imagine what kind of battle had taken place there to render a palace into that kind of state.

Han Sen kept flying and examining the place. Since the temple was so damaged, it was hard to tell what many of the things once were. The shape of the building was also very weird. It was different from the other kind of buildings Han Sen had seen.

Suddenly, Han Sen saw something. It made his expression change.

In the fallen metal ruins, Han Sen saw a partially visible god altar. The alter looked similar to the ones he had seen in the Sky Vine Radish Temple. It was the altar that was able to revive Sky Vine Radish.

Han Sen waved his hands and moved all of the metal scraps away. The altar was now easier to see. It was the same as what Han Sen had seen inside Sky Vine Radish Temple. No matter the texture, the symbols, or stylings, it was the same.

“Is this place really a temple? How could a temple look so destroyed? Plus, it is in the universe… I thought the temples were only inside the geno hall.” Han Sen had a puzzled expression. He moved the stuff around in hopes of finding some useful leads. Han Sen quickly noticed that the altar was not complete. Some sort of power had broken it.

“What is going on here? A temple was destroyed. Who had the power to bring a temple into the universe and then destroy it?” While Han Sen pondered this, he sensed some movement from afar. Han Sen’s heart jumped. He put away his presence and hid behind a broken metal wall.

Not long later, Han Sen sensed a creature approaching the metal temple. It was standing at the door where it said, “Metal Temple.” The creature was staring at those two words.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to watch. He discovered that it was a man with a lot of white hair, but he was very strange. Although he had white hair, he did not look old. He was a middle-aged man with a fair aura about him. The man stared at the metal temple for a while. He sighed said. “It has been many years. I, Tai Yi, am finally back.”
