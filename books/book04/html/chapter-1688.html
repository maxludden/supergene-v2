      Han Sen and Old Cat looked inside the metal box. There was a bright light
      inside, seething like boiling water. But it didn’t spill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katcha noises were coming from the light, and the noises made them both
      shiver with a chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old Cat, what is that noise?” Han Sen looked at the light in the metal
      box, but he couldn’t see or feel anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How am I supposed to know? It sounds like teeth, munching on bones,” Old
      Cat said, peering at the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Munching bones? Be honest with me know: is this really some sort of
      greenhouse?” Han Sen hadn’t believed Nine-Life Cat when he was told it was
      a greenhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat decided to make a promise, and he said, “It is a greenhouse! I
      would not lie to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So why does this look like a coffin? You say you hear some bone-breaking
      noises, so if this garden had bones… why would that make any sense?” Han
      Sen looked at Old Cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat felt guilty, and mumbled, “This is a greenhouse! It’s just not a
      normal greenhouse.”
    </p>
    <p>“What do you mean? What is not normal about it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      Old Cat knew if he didn’t explain a little, Han Sen would just go on and
      on about this. So, he said, “I researched it for a while. If I am correct,
      this is a royal greenhouse belonging to the crystallizers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A royal greenhouse?” Han Sen thought Old Cat was lying. Greenhouses grew
      vegetables; they didn’t grow meat, and certainly not bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat looked serious and said, “Do not underestimate the greenhouses of
      the crystallizers. The stuff they grow is not limited to carrots and other
      vegetables.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It sounds as if you know what to expect.” Han Sen stared down at Old Cat
      with hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat coughed and said, “I only know a bit. This metal box is a
      crystallizer’s growing box. A new type of plant is inside it.” “What is
      different about their plants?” Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know. I have seen the plants of crystallizers before, and they
      look very weird. They shouldn’t even be called plants, really. They have a
      lifeforce,” Old Cat said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A plant with a lifeforce is nothing rare. There are loads of geno plants
      across the sanctuary,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat suddenly said, “This is what I’m trying to tell you. The sanctuary
      does not have geno plants. Crystallizers planted their seeds across the
      sanctuaries, and that is why they possess a lifeforce.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you saying a geno plant’s alpha is inside there?” Han Sen asked as he
      looked at the box with shock.
    </p>
    <p>The metal box continued to create creepy katcha noises.</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know about that, but if it has been created by a royal garden, it
      should be something good.” Old Cat stopped for a moment and then
      continued. “Crystallizers never planned to create new creatures or beast
      souls. What they wanted to grow was geno armor.”
    </p>
    <p>“You can grow geno armor?” Han Sen was shocked hearing this.</p>
    <p>
      “Not originally. Crystallizers tried combining the genes of creatures,
      spirits, and their geno plants. But something big happened. The
      crystallizers lost, and the leftovers were attacked. The unfinished seeds
      can be found across the sanctuaries, having become geno plants,” Old Cat
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Old Cat and said, “If you can find this place and dig up
      this box, you must have a greater idea of what exactly is inside.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat looked awkward and smiled. “Actually, I really don’t know. I came
      because of my sound judgment. This could have been a royal greenhouse. It
      is possibly a location for geno armor, and that is why I selected this
      place. It was the best spot, and many important things are around. That’s
      why I chose this place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know Feng Shui?” Han Sen didn’t believe Old Cat at all. And he looked
      at the cat as if he was a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat shrugged and said, “Fine. I admit I picked the place because of
      the fertilizer, but that’s important. I have dug through three other
      places nearby and found nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What fertilizer?” Han Sen looked at the deep hole he had dug, and there
      was nothing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you see how dark the soil in this place is? Look at the tablet. Do you
      see the red signs?” Old Cat pointed at the tip of the metal box.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen took a look, and it was exactly as the cat had been saying.</p>
    <p>
      “Did you really think this was a gravestone? This is a piece of
      crystallizer gear from the greenhouse. The fertilizer was injected through
      the tablet Look at the tablet The item inside the box is being taken care
      of. This might be a very important item for the royal greenhouse.” Old Cat
      looked at the box with shiny eyes.
    </p>
    <p>“Can you take it out, then?” Han Sen lifted his lips.</p>
    <p>
      “Crystallizers items are tricky. You should be careful.” Old Cat ignored
      Han Sen’s suggestion. He kept on looking, but he did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I didn’t appear, how would you have gotten the thing out by yourself?
      You can’t just watch all the time,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat wanted to say something, but they suddenly heard a slamming sound
      from inside the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand reached through one of the broken sections of the box. It looked
      like jade but it wasn’t; it looked like bone, but it wasn’t. It gripped
      the box like a demon’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and the Old Cat jumped away together, moving quite the distance.
