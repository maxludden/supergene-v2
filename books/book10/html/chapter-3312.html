<p>Ancient Devil did not look any different. He carried on with his
subject of conversation and said, “According to the old leader’s
plans, the 33 skies were to become the universe’s core area that
could control both the main and the reverse universes. If they were
to control them, they would require a manager. So, when they
designed the 33 skies, they established the plan for a manager to
operate in the 33 skies. That means they created a creature from 33
skies to become the manager. That way, they could make the 33 skies
run.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying Sky King is a creature the 33 skies made?” Han
Sen understood what Ancient Devil meant to say.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil nodded. “Yes. Sky King is one of the creatures the
33 skies made. He was supposed to be the No. 1 manager who
controlled the 33 skies. He was going to take direct orders from
the old leader. That meant he would be the primary manager in the
33 skies. When the universe was rebooted, the 33 skies were
affected. It created many layers in space. The creatures there were
affected too. Many creatures were reincarnated like Sky King.”</p>
<p>Hearing Ancient Devil speak got Han Sen to start thinking. He
eventually looked at Ancient Devil and said, “If I have guessed
things correctly, you are saying that the 33 skies had more than
one manager like Sky King. Does that mean the eight generals you
used to have were all creatures from the 33 skies?”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did not deny it. He laughed and said, “You are
right. The eight generals were the creatures from the 33 skies.
They had the power to protect the 33 skies. Even if they
reincarnated, the talents of their souls would not be changed. The
33 skies rely on their power. I found their reincarnated selves and
hoped to use their powers to control the 33 skies, but controlling
the 33 skies still requires them and their souls to be awoken.
Right now, Sky King’s soul has been awoken. If it wasn’t, the 33
skies would not be like how they are now.”</p>
<p>“Why must it be Sky King? Can it not be another general?” Han
Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Did I not just tell you that Sky King was the creature from the
33 skies appointed with the highest level of authority?” Ancient
Devil replied. “The other generals did not have a low amount of
authority, but the authorities permitted were still different. To
open the 33 skies, Sky King was required to be woken up.”</p>
<p>“What about Asura?” Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil with eyes
that were on fire.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil shrugged his shoulders and said, “Everything is
prone to accidents, and things going wrong. Asura was one such
accident. She is a spirit of the 33 skies. She was the manager in
control of all laws.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil, wanting him to keep on
talking.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil looked like he was smiling at Han Sen, but he
wasn’t smiling. “Do you want to keep hearing stories here or come
with me to the 33 skies and seal the holes in the universes?”</p>
<p>“Can you seal them?” Han Sen enquired Ancient Devil with
wonder.</p>
<p>“Sky King is already awake. Although he has not totally woken up
yet, the two paths he has opened cannot be closed easily. Even if
you closed them, he has what it takes to open them again.” After
pausing, Ancient Devil squinted his eyes and said, “If you and I
co-operate, we might stand a chance. I have a way in which we can
stop Sky King from opening the paths to and from.”</p>
<p>“What benefit do you get out of doing this?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You should know that I am interested in the geno tablet. I do
not want other people to fight me for it, especially a guy who can
control Sky King and the God Chaos Party. With my power being what
it is, I cannot fight Qin Xiu. If he enters the 33rd sky soon, I
will stand no chance of stopping him.” Ancient Devil was being very
honest and forthright.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and asked, “In that case, what do you think we
should do?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the 33 skies first,” Ancient Devil said. “Without
the geno prototype replica, I can no longer return to the 33rd sky.
Only you can take me there.”</p>
<p>“I can only use my spirit body to go there,” Han Sen said with
the shake of his head. “I cannot take anything with me.”</p>
<p>He was speaking the truth. If he could take Ancient Devil with
him there, he really would have done so. Ancient Devil could not
touch the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil seemed to figure that was the case, so he was not
surprised. He said, “That is not hard. I can use a soul coming out
skill. I can enter your Sea of Soul. Then, you can escort my spirit
to the 33rd sky.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Han Sen said with a nod. He watched Ancient Devil’s body
enter the 33 skies, so he was not surprised.</p>
<p>“You wait here. I will find a safe spot for my body.” Ancient
Devil teleported away. A moment later, he came back with a spirit
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his Sea of Soul. Ancient Devil flew inside.</p>
<p>Seeing that Han Sen’s Sea of Soul had many beast souls and God
Spirits, Ancient Devil could not help but compliment him. “You are
a human from the sanctuary, yet, by some miracle, you turned out to
be so special. You have the rule power approval of the sanctuaries.
I am so jealous.”</p>
<p>“What is there to be jealous about?” Han Sen asked. “The
sanctuaries were created by Qin Xiu and World King God. If they
could make it, I think you would have been able to make something
similar too.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil coldly said, “Qin Xiu is strong, but I never
fought him before. Knowing he was able to do things like this, I
know why he is so unique. But if he wanted to make the sanctuaries,
he should not have been able to make it then. It’s not just him.
Even the God Hall Leader should have been unable to make something
like the sanctuaries.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t Qin Xiu make the sanctuaries?” Han Sen enquired with
surprise.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Ancient Devil said with certainty. “When I
reincarnated in the sanctuaries, the sanctuaries did not have
humans or creatures. There was no Qin Xiu or World King God either.
Even if Qin Xiu created humans and creatures, that was just done
after finding the sanctuaries. Through the years of my research, I
learned the rules of the sanctuaries were never so simple. Its
rules are like the geno hall.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe this, so he asked, “What are you saying?
Are you saying the sanctuaries are on par with the geno hall? That
is a bit hard to believe. The power people have in the sanctuaries
is extremely low. How can it be considered the same as the geno
hall?”</p>
<p>“That is not how levels are determined,” Ancient Devil said.
“It’s like the education of the Alliance. Primary schools are
different from universities. To the Alliance, they are both as
important as each other. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at him weirdly and said, “That means, the
sanctuaries and the geno hall are the same levels but they just
function differently. But if that is the case, what is the function
of the sanctuaries?”</p>
