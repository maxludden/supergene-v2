<p>“God said he was here looking for someone.” The geno tablet’s
voice did not have any emotion in it.</p>
<p>“Who was he looking for?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“He did not say,” the geno tablet replied.</p>
<p>“What about the Wu Wei Dao person? What was he doing here?” Han
Sen asked.</p>
<p>“He said he came here to kill someone,” the geno tablet said. It
made Han Sen frown.</p>
<p>“Who was he going to kill?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“He did not say,” the geno tablet quickly replied.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned even deeper. Not many people could actually gain
access to that place. Even if Han Sen had achieved it, he was only
the third person to do so. That meant whoever God was looking for
was not residing in this place.</p>
<p>The Wu Wei Dao person might have had the same target as God.
Perhaps he wanted to kill God. Han Sen could not confirm any of
these theories.</p>
<p>“Where did God and the Wu Wei Dao person go?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“They left,” the geno tablet emotionlessly said. “They were not
the creatures I wanted, so they were not permitted to stay.”</p>
<p>“I am not the creature you were waiting for either. Can I leave
now?” When Han Sen heard that God and the Wu Wei Dao person were
gone, he felt relieved and thought, “It looks like this geno tablet
is a pacifist. He is not going to trouble me.”</p>
<p>“No.” The geno tablet’s answer made Han Sen jump.</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen sadly asked.</p>
<p>“You destroyed the geno message foundation,” the geno tablet
said. “The geno messages that were split up have to be taken by
you. Otherwise, it will be very bad for the universe.”</p>
<p>“Does it have to be like that? Is there no other way?” Han Sen
asked with a wry smile. He did not want to become a monster. The
red hair he had grown made his head itch. If he grew a few more
eyes or a few more arms on his head or something, Han Sen would
have much preferred to die.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The geno tablet’s answer gave Han Sen a glimmer of hope
to latch onto.</p>
<p>What the geno tablet said next made Han Sen depressed. “If you
can control the geno tablet, you can rebuild the geno message.”</p>
<p>If he was able to control the geno tablet, he would not have
been pulled inside to consult with the geno tablet and speak to it
like a prisoner.</p>
<p>“If you can’t, then use your body, which has already been split
up, and give it up to the gene messages.” When the geno tablet
spoke, a star spell flew over.</p>
<p>Han Sen now saw what the light spells looked like. The light
spells were made of stars and lights. They were a part of the ocean
of stars.</p>
<p>Han Sen had left a mark on the geno tablet earlier. He cut a
part of the star seas away. That was a part of the light spell.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was crushed by the geno tablet’s power. He was
made unable to move. He let the light spell land on him.</p>
<p>Because his body was in Super God Spirit mode, the light spells
went through his body. They entered his body, but they could not
melt and become one with Han Sen’s genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen was delighted when he found out the light spells could
do nothing to his body. He suddenly saw that the giant, weird
planet looked like a soft animal twisting. It gave birth to a
tentacle that came lashing toward Han Sen’s spirit body.</p>
<p>The geno tablet said, “Your genes can contain super gene
features, but it is not a real super gene. Fake genes are fake
genes. They will never be the real super genes.” Then, the tentacle
wrapped around Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he was being electrified. His body was
suddenly tremoring. His spirit body was changing. He was going to
exit his Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>When his spirit body became a body again, the light spell melted
into Han Sen’s body. He could feel his blood boil. It felt like his
body was being cooked.</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Han Sen wanted to enter Super God Spirit mode again.
When his body started to become a spirit body, the tentacles
electrocuted him again. It made Han Sen’s spirit body become an
average body. Han Sen tried to reverse it many times, but it failed
without a single sign of success. All he felt was increased
pain.</p>
<p>“Cheating geno tablet!” Han Sen cursed it. He gave up trying to
enter his Super God Spirit mode. He used his power to cast a few
geno arts.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s Break World power made the gene
messages’ assimilation with his body proceed slower. Even so, it
was only slower.</p>
<p>Although Jadeskin broke the world and provided him with a holy
body, it was unable to stop the invasion of the gene messages.</p>
<p>When the Dongxuan Sutra broke the world, it only analyzed the
gene messages. It could not stop a thing.</p>
<p>The Story of Genes was madly running, but Forever Solid was not
very useful.</p>
<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth and reversed his The Story of Genes.
After his body had mutated last time, he was able to use the
reverse The Story of Genes. Yet, he could not put the main and the
reverse The Story of Genes and combine them. He could not break the
world.</p>
<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth and tried to do that anyway. The geno
tablet’s gene messages were not too strong, but Han Sen could not
fight the geno tablet’s power.</p>
<p>The destructive power spread throughout Han Sen’s body. At the
same time, the Forever Solid power melted in his body. The two
powers clashed against each other. It made Han Sen’s body start to
develop changes that could very well flip the sky and the
ground.</p>
<p>His flesh was torn from his body, but it was instantly healed.
It was then ripped from his body again. Once more, he was instantly
healed. His bones broke, inch by inch, but would then repair
themselves inch by inch as well. One could not imagine that pain.
It was like the substance of his body was being broken and
rebuilt.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Han Sen could not endure the pain any longer. He started
to roar like an animal. He did it to release the pain that was
driving him insane.</p>
<p>His body entered xenogeneic mode. Xenogeneic mode did not
provide him with enough power to make his body enter spirit body
mode, but the four geno arts and their Break World powers made
things like water melting into plastic. Things started to
change.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body started to exhibit changes. His body looked like
bone and flesh. Even his organs glowed with holy light. It was the
purest body possible that did not have a single speck of dirt or
dust.</p>
<p>In that pure body, the red blood flowed. It was like a blood
river was running, roaring, and boiling. Wherever it went, it
brought a lot of energy.</p>
<p>That holy body was like flesh growing. It slowly created a set
of black armor. Han Sen’s body was slowly wrapped up inside the
shelter of a set of armor.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, a destructive and forever scary power
was wrapping up Han Sen’s body. It made his xenogeneic body
suddenly look like an erupting volcano.</p>
<p>The gene messages that invaded Han Sen’s body were destroyed by
the scary power. They turned into nothingness.</p>
<p>Within that explosion, Han Sen’s xenogeneic body started to
change. It was like a crab molting its shell or a silkworm breaking
through its cocoon.</p>
