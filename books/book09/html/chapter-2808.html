<p>Han Sen did not know what Bai King was thinking, but he had to
be up to something since he was spoiling him so much. There had to
be an ulterior motive. For the time being, Han Sen was unaware of
what it was.</p>
<p>After this news spread, many of the Extreme King elites knew
that Bai King spoiled the holy child to an ungodly level. Even Bai
King’s firstborn son did not receive such lavish treatment.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Bai King was always harsh toward his
children. He rarely spoiled someone like he was doing now.</p>
<p>Even more shocking was the fact that Bai King had given Holy
Baby access to the Nine-Defense Palace. This news spread after many
people saw the Black Demon Ape’s carcass. They guessed what had
happened, which made them even more shocked than what had happened
in the palace.</p>
<p>“Mister Holy Baby, can you start learning some manners now?” Bao
Ying saw Han Sen reclining on a rocking chair. She looked hopeless
as she made the request.</p>
<p>If she had a choice in the matter, she would not bother trying
to teach Han Sen. Since Bai King had commanded her to do it, she
could not decline and disobey.</p>
<p>Han Sen blinked and said, “My name is Holy Baby, and your name
is Bao Ying. That is a coincidence. As a result of this stroke of
fate, can you answer a question?”</p>
<p>“Aside from manners, I do not know anything else,” Bao Ying
said.</p>
<p>“Do not worry,” Han Sen said. “I am not asking you to divulge
any secrets. I have access to the Nine-Defense Palace now, so can
you tell me something about the Nine-Defense Palace?”</p>
<p>“What do you want to know about Nine-Defense Palace?” Bao Ying
weirdly asked.</p>
<p>“What is that place called Nine-Defense Palace?” Han Sen asked
with a smile. “And, that queen, she was only there to trouble me
because of my access to Nine-Defense Palace. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>The queen had not come to see him before that, so it was a bit
of a coincidence how she had come to trouble him after his first
trip to the Nine-Defense Palace. Considering Bai Wanjie’s behavior
earlier, it was not difficult to guess what had happened.</p>
<p>Bao Ying moved her eyes, but she still shook her head. “I am not
privy to what motivates the queen to do what she does.”</p>
<p>“You must know something about the Nine-Defense Palace, right?”
Han Sen asked. “You must know something. Stop telling me you don’t
know.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t know. You have the right to access Nine-Defense
Palace. If you don’t know, how am I supposed to know?” Bao Ying
still spoke coldly, despite maintaining her elegance.</p>
<p>“Let’s make a deal,” Han Sen said while looking at Bao Ying.
“You tell me about the Nine-Defense Palace, and I will concede to
learning manners from you. Otherwise, get ready to teach me
forever.”</p>
<p>Bao Ying was a little hesitant. She frowned and thought about it
for a while. “I don’t actually know all that much. I only know that
the Nine-Defense Palace is a place to lock up special xenogeneics.
Many generations have been controlled by the king or crown
prince.”</p>
<p>Although Bao Ying had just spoken three sentences, there were
many hidden messages in the subtext.</p>
<p>Nine-Defense Palace locked up special xenogeneics. Many
generations were controlled by the crown princes. It meant that the
person who controlled Nine-Defense Palace might become the Extreme
King’s future king.</p>
<p>Now, Bai King had given Nine-Defense Palace to Han Sen. It was
weird. Han Sen knew Bai King would not give up the throne to a
xenogeneic student.</p>
<p>It is no wonder Bai Wanjie was so mad. He could not even keep a
lid on his emotions. Even the queen came to annoy me. That has to
be why. But what is Bai King up to? I do not understand. If Mister
White was here, he might be able to analyze a thing or two.
Considering my current identity, seeking him out might be awkward.
It might end up harming him." Han Sen was a bit troubled, but he
forgot all about it. He wanted to get his benefits first.</p>
<p>“What is so special about the xenogeneics contained in the
Nine-Defense Palace?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I really do not know.” Bao Ying shook her head as she answered
him.</p>
<p>Seeing Bao Ying not wanting to answer him, Han Sen tried to
change the subject. “Your surname is Bao. Do you belong to Bao
King’s faction? If so, why are you here as a mere maid?”</p>
<p>“Mister, we should really get on with our lessons.” Bao Ying did
not want to answer that even more than his other questions.</p>
<p>“Answer one of my questions first, then we can start learning,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>There was nothing Bao Ying was able to do. She was silent a
moment before saying, “Nine-Defense Palace has always been in
charge of either the king or the crown prince. Outsiders do not
know why they trap the xenogeneics inside. Those xenogeneics are
locked up in there by the king himself. I am afraid you are the
only one who is not a king or a crown prince to have ever entered
Nine-Defense Palace. If you want a clearer answer, you will have to
find out more by yourself.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Bao Ying was not misleading him and being earnest,
Han Sen did not force her to say anything more. He smiled and said,
“Let’s start practicing. You can start teaching me manners. We will
later take a break to talk about more things.”</p>
<p>Bao Ying read out the manners to Han Sen. He kept listening but
thought, Is Bai King’s conspiracy related to my access to
Nine-Defense Palace? But he did not say anything, and he allowed me
to kill the xenogeneics of the Nine-Defense Palace. Why is he doing
that?"</p>
<p>A maid quickly rushed into the garden, speaking to Bao Ying, who
was in the middle of reading to Han Sen. “Bao Ying, the queen is
not feeling well. She wants you to go be with her.”</p>
<p>Bao Ying’s expression changed. The maid went on to say, “The
queen says you will have to go back with her, no matter what.”</p>
<p>“Mister, I am afraid we will have to pause our lesson here.” Bao
Ying stood up and bowed.</p>
<p>“Bao Ying, it was the king who asked you to teach me, right?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Mister, I will be back tomorrow,” Bao Ying said.</p>
<p>“I want to learn it now. Teach me now! Otherwise, you will be
disobeying the king’s orders.” Han Sen’s face did not change.</p>
<p>Bao Ying looked troubled. She glanced at the maid, who was
frowning. “You can learn manners whenever. The queen is ill. She
needs Bao Ying there for her. We cannot delay this matter.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the queen’s concerns are more important
than the king’s concerns? If the queen’s concerns are so important,
it looks like I should tell the king about this. I should let him
know just how important the queen’s affairs are.” Han Sen looked
like he was smiling at the maid, but he wasn’t smiling.</p>
<p>The maid’s face changed. She gritted her teeth. “There is no
need…”</p>
<p>“If there is no need, then get the hell out of here. If you
enter my garden again, things won’t be this copacetic.” Han Sen
summoned Yin Head Ghost and shone it at the maid.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The maid flew away and started to cry. She was sent soaring far
away from the garden. Everyone watched the maid go.</p>
<p>“He is so cocky. He is beating up a maid that belongs to the
queen.”</p>
<p>“That is because he has the backing of the king. When the king
was just a king, no one was mistreated like this before. I do not
understand what is so special about him that makes the king think
he is so important.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Why are you offending the queen?” Bao Ying asked with a sigh.
“You don’t get anything out of it.”</p>
<p>“You do not want to go back either, right?” Han Sen asked with a
blink.</p>
<p>Bao Ying was shocked. She did not know Han Sen was so
perceptive. He was able to see the doubts she harbored in her
heart.</p>
