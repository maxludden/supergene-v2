    <p>
      Yang Manli and her people followed Han Sen to the Spirit Hall, where Han
      Sen used his swords to utterly suppress the twin spirits. Through his
      ceaseless barrage of sword strikes, the twin spirits could not gain ground
      and push back, and it fell back further and further.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is something sinister and malevolent about this Han Sen. He
      has been in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary for less than a year, so how
      can he be so powerful? He is somehow managing to suppress two royal
      spirits simultaneously. And as for what happened earlier&#8230;&#8221; Zhu
      Ting bore a strange look, and he seemed to be disturbed by his thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The twin spirits had been pushed back as far as possible, and now had its
      back to a statue. The pretty faces of the royal spirits looked pale and
      hopeless.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver snake sword and ancient mascot sword were each pressed against
      a spirit&#8217;s neck. Seeing both of the spirits down on their knees,
      with pitiable and saddened looks on their faces, Han Sen felt remarkably
      happy. Once, these had almost cost him his life by severely injuring him.
      Today, he was finally able to turn the tides and win back some of the
      pride he had lost that time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Quickly, kill them and grab the spirit stone!&#8221; someone
      shouted from behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is no rush; I will wait a little longer.&#8221; Han Sen did
      not finish off the spirits yet, he just continued to rest the swords
      against their necks. He wanted to provide more time for Qi Xiuwen and the
      rest to slay more creatures for a greater bounty when the day was over.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Qi Xiuwen had a curious conflict of interest brewing in his
      heart, it was something he managed to mostly ignore. With the power of
      Thunderdevil and the Blackgod Shelter, they were assuredly the strongest
      force across the Icefield. He thought it was practically guaranteed that
      he would take the royal shelter for himself. Even if Li Xinglun and Philip
      wanted to prevent him from taking it over, any attempt at retaliation
      would be futile. There was absolutely no one who could go up against
      Thunderdevil.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, Qi Xiuwen found the Spirit Hall. As he approached its entrance,
      however, he was almost disturbed to notice the complete absence of
      creatures. Even more unnerving were the half-jovial sounds of human talk
      resonating from inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen and Thunderdevil looked at each, acknowledging what they were
      both thinking. Together, they ran into the Spirit Hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the rest accompanying, a larger host entered the Spirit Hall behind
      them. Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s pupils decreased into little beads after he was
      inside. He saw the people that were supposed to be fighting elsewhere in
      the spirit shelter reclined in the Spirit Hall. Han Sen already stood next
      to a statue, reaching out his hand to grab the spirit stone that was
      embedded within.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is the twin spirits!&#8221; Qi Xiuwen saw Han Sen holding a gold
      sword and a silver sword, with the twin spirits standing in concession
      beneath the blades. He couldn&#8217;t have been more surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen take the two spirit stones, the silver-haired lady and
      golden-haired lady then ceremoniously knelt before Han Sen. They lowered
      both of their proud heads and spoke in tandem, &#8220;Yin Princess and
      Yang Princess are willing to submit and offer absolute loyalty to a new
      master. We can become the most faithful of servants.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone else was now on their feet, staring at the princesses who were
      kneeling and swearing fealty to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a pair of princess spirits. It was rare enough to see a royal
      class spirit make such a vow, but to have two of them do it at the same
      time was almost unbelievable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In each of Han Sen&#8217;s hands rested a spirit stone, one silver and one
      gold. He placed the stones on the Yin Princess and Yang Princess&#8217;s
      foreheads. They then became one with their stones, disappearing into them
      in a blinding light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone continued to stand there, just watching. The taking of a royal
      spirit was something few people would ever see. And for it to be the twin
      spirits, above all, was something might happen once every one hundred
      years at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the royal spirits were taken, the creatures inside the shelter lost
      their reason to remain and defend what was previously their home, and so
      they fled. A little while later, Li Xinglun and Philip arrived at the
      Spirit Hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you guys supposed to be hunting the creatures? What
      are you doing here?&#8221; Han Sen turned to survey the hall with his
      eyes, which after one long pan, ended up on Qi Xiuwen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen sighed and said, &#8220;Brother Han, you are so blessed. You
      must be really lucky to have been able to tame the twin spirits.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s tone of voice changed. &#8220;But you
      cannot live off the merit of luck your entire life. Brother Han, I will be
      taking this shelter, okay?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Qi Xiuwen, do you not remember the promise made between
      Tang&#8217;s family and Dong Lin?&#8221; Han Sen kept his stare on Qi
      Xiuwen as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The promise between Dong Lin and Tang&#8217;s family only applied
      to the Blackgod Shelter. This isn&#8217;t the Blackgod Shelter, now is
      it?&#8221; Qi Xiuwen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun and Philip looked at each other, as if to confirm they were
      about to do something in tandem. But all of a sudden, Qi Xiuwen made a
      gesture with his hand. In seconds, countless soldiers from the Blackgod
      Shelter swarmed every corner of the hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is between me and Brother Han, so please don&#8217;t interrupt
      us. Thanks, I appreciate that,&#8221; Qi Xiuwen told Li Xinglun and
      Philip.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Qi, you promised that the three of us would be in charge once we
      took the shelter. You are going to take it all for yourself?&#8221; Philip
      said coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This world is reserved for the strong. Even if I did give it to
      you, could you honestly hold onto this shelter?&#8221; Qi Xiuwen then gave
      a signal which made the evolvers around him assume battle stances. There
      were more than forty evolvers with a fitness level of over one hundred.
    </p>

    <p>
      The faces of Li Xinglun and Philip changed. Both of their shelters only
      had ten evolvers with a fitness level of over one hundred. Blackgod
      Shelter, however, was only supposed to contain twenty. How could there now
      be so many?
    </p>

    <p>
      Against so many evolvers with such a level, it would have been impossible
      for them to fight back. And so they reverted to silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli scowled, as did the rest of her compatriots. A battalion such
      as that, would be enough to sweep clean the entirety of the Icefield.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen was right, however. Only the strong could thrive and become
      formidable leaders. The power Qi Xiuwen had now was truly enough to assert
      control over anything he desired upon the Icefield. It would be pointless
      for anyone to resist.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, you and I were friends. It is a shame we do not see
      eye-to-eye on this, but if you pledge fealty to me and swear obedience, I
      will keep you by my side. Our relationship can the remain the way it was,
      except our roles will be reversed.&#8221; Qi Xiuwen, empowered with a
      feeling of dominance, spoke to Han Sen in a tone marinated with the bitter
      sauce of bluster.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Qi Xiuwen, you honestly think these people can stop me?&#8221; Han
      Sen stroked the silver fox in his arms and asked his question calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen smiled and responded, &#8220;Brother Han is very powerful. This
      is something I acknowledge and I would not dare look down on you, if this
      is what you fear.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, Qi Xiuwen pointed to the man at his side, Thunderdevil. He
      then said, &#8220;I can only assume you do not know who this person is, so
      allow me to introduce you. This is the most talented evolver in Dong Lin.
      This is Thunderdevil. Few people could ever hope to be as talented as him.
      He is a successful learner of the skill Thunder Core. He also unlocked his
      first gene lock in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. He is quite the
      rarity in the Alliance.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone&#8217;s faces changed as they looked at Thunderdevil in fright.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he had been able to unlock his first gene lock in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary, the man by Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s side was undoubtedly a
      genius. He looked to be between forty and fifty, so already having such an
      achievement as a notch in his belt was remarkable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Silence deafened the ears of all in the hall. Qi Xiuwen had with him an
      elite who had already unlocked his first gene lock. This sort of power
      would not simply mop up its adversaries but crush them into dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hall had never been so quiet, and a sad realization dawned in the
      hearts of all who were there. Their hope had been depleted, and with this
      man and his crushing power present, the fear of losing everything in the
      ice field to Qi Xiuwen was all too real.
