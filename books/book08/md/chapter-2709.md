  If Exquisite was in peak condition, knocking her out wouldn’t have been so easy. But right now, she was completely exhausted. Her entire body was running on fumes, and she would never have expected Han Sen to attack her. So, she was instantly knocked unconscious.

“I’m sorry. I must do something that will affect a whole race, so I cannot let anyone else know about it.” Han Sen picked up Exquisite’s unconscious form. He looked up to the darkening sky above him, and as he did so, his eyes started to turn white. Then, his whole body began to glow as he activated his super god spirit mode.

Although the transformation had only just begun, the weird power that had been clinging to Han Sen was vanquished the moment his super god body activated. It was completely gone.

In a matter of moments, the glowing, white power disappeared as well. Han Sen’s body returned to normal again.

“Finally, it is gone!” The foreign energy that had plagued him had vanished, and he felt much relief. Bao Lian’s attack had been expunged. The scary God Spirit Storm wasn’t gone, though. It was still there in the sky.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Lightning flashed across the pitch-black sky, sending bursts of light across the clouds.

When the lightning struck, the whole sky rumbled with thunder. The lightning and thunder began to build in frequency and intensity. It made the whole sky and earth become an ocean of electricity.

Han Sen looked glum. He didn’t know if the God Spirit Storm was a remnant of Bao Lian’s power, or if it simply wouldn’t recede because it had already formed. Regardless, he was now stuck inside that God Spirit Storm. Any hope of an easy escape was gone.

That thunderstorm was so weird. Although the storm pulsed with lightning, the lightning bolts never damaged the grass when they touched down. It was like the lightning was fake.

But Han Sen knew the lightning was very real, but the element that composed it was rather special. And now that he was inside this thunderstorm, he couldn’t use his teleportation techniques. The surrounding area seemed to be locked down by the storm.

Exquisite had depleted her energy reserves before Han Sen knocked her out. And even if she had been awake and full of power, she wouldn’t have been able to teleport them away either.

“I have no idea if we can escape this God Spirit Storm alive.” Han Sen didn’t hesitate. Still holding Exquisite, he flew through the thunderstorm at full speed.

Lightning fell across his body like raindrops. Although it didn’t hurt or numb him, he could definitely feel it.

Boom! Boom!

Somewhere within the thunderstorm off to Han Sen’s side, a giant bolt of lightning exploded. But within the light of that bolt, he saw a shadow standing on the ground.

The burst of light was so bright that Han Sen could only make out the shape of the shadow. It was a monster with the head and horns of a bull. A pair of bat wings spread from its back.

That was all Han Sen could see in the momentary flash of light.

He didn’t dare to think about it too much. Instead, he continued to fly forward at full speed. While he was flying, another burst of bright light exploded in front of him. Han Sen saw the bull monster appear in front of him, and it was approaching.

Thunder rolled with every step it took, and the creature moved with a mountainous sense of gravity. Its body was 100 meters tall, and every step caused the realm to quake.

The hair on Han Sen’s arms stood on end. He knew he had been targeted by the scary xenogeneic, and while they hadn’t made contact yet, Han Sen could feel that its presence was not a meager primitive class.

“Sacrifice, are you calling me?” The mountainous bull monster stood amidst the storm. It was like a thunderbolt itself. Its eyes were massive, and they looked straight at Han Sen. Its voice rumbled, but Han Sen could hear it clearly within the thunderstorm.

Although it was looking at Han Sen, the monster was confused. It wasn’t sure if Han Sen was its sacrifice.

Han Sen’s heart jumped and he thought, “Bao Lian, that *sshole! His power put some sort of sacrificial marker on me that this deified can detect? No wonder the God Spirit Storm kept chasing me. He made me an offering for a deified xenogeneic!”

“I think you’ve made a mistake. I’m not your sacrifice. You should go and look elsewhere for it.” Han Sen wasn’t sure if the monster would understand him, but the creature did appear rather intelligent. If the creature could be reasoned with, then perhaps he could talk his way out of this.

The bull monster heard what Han Sen said, but it didn’t leave. It just looked at him and Exquisite.

“You might not be my sacrifice, but you are already here. I cannot return empty-handed. I must take one of you with me as my sacrifice.” The bull monster’s voice echoed in the thunder.

Han Sen understood what the bull monster meant. Either he or Exquisite would have to go with the creature.

He looked at the comatose Exquisite. There was no one to stop him from handing her over, but when he thought about Exquisite’s desperation and willingness to die in order to save him, he knew that giving her to the bull monster wasn’t an option.

But Han Sen didn’t want to sacrifice himself, either.

“We are both weak, low-level creatures. We cannot be your sacrifice. Why don’t I take you somewhere else to find you a better sacrifice?”

The bull monster didn’t speak. It stood silently as peals of thunder continued to roll across the sky.

Although it didn’t speak, Han Sen understood what it meant. It had already made its mind up to take one of them as a sacrifice.

“Does your sacrifice have to be a creature? Could it be something else?” Han Sen asked.

“I wouldn’t mind the shield that you’re carrying on your back,” said the bull monster’s rumbling voice.

Han Sen was shocked. He knew immediately which shield the bull monster was talking about. It was referring to the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze.

“This guy is smart, but he’s just a xenogeneic. He isn’t one of the Gana. Why does he want the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze? I’m afraid that only the Gana can make full use of it.” Han Sen was confused, and so he asked the bull monster, “What do you want this shield for? This is a treasure belonging to the Gana. It can’t be activated by someone who lacks the blood of the Gana.”

But now that Han Sen had a moment to think about it, he understood why the bull monster had been willing to stand around talking to them instead of just killing them on sight.

“This guy is scared of the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. That’s why he’s being cautious instead of just attacking me.” That realization was a great relief for Han Sen. If the bull monster had a reason to fear Han Sen, then he and Exquisite had a much better chance of escaping.

And Han Sen had no intention of handing over the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. His opponent was just a xenogeneic, so who could tell if it would even keep its promise? At the moment, its fear of the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze was keeping it at bay. If Han Sen gave it the shield, however, that would be the same as forfeiting his life. Han Sen would never allow another to control his fate.

“He doesn’t know that I cannot use the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. This is a chance for me,” Han Sen thought to himself.
