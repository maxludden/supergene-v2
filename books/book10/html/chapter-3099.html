<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The room’s door was blown open by Si Tu Ya, but no one was able
to see what was inside. All they saw was a strong, holy white
shadow blocking the door.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>Si Tu Ya could not see what that white shadow was. She felt
darkness approach her. Suddenly, the shadow of two legs appeared
and kicked her in the face. She went flying away. The white shadow
also took Feng Yin Yin from Si Tu Ya’s arms.</p>
<p>Si Tu Ya’s face had two red very distinct footprints. Her
cheekbones had been caved in. Her nose was broken as she fell
before the people. A noble in the back held her and stopped her. As
he clutched her, her face was full of blood.</p>
<p>Everyone knew it was a Holy Wen White Deer that had kicked Si Tu
Ya. The head of the creature had antlers with holy light. It was as
if it was the light from the sun.</p>
<p>The white deer put Feng Yin Yin on its back. It blocked the open
door and stared at the people. It was quiet and calm. It looked
like a white jade statue.</p>
<p>“Adult holy wen white deer!” someone yelled with shock.
God-class gene races were very rare to see, and this one was very
unique. Its rank was not particularly high, but it was not
something often seen.</p>
<p>Growing a god-class gene race into an adult was not easy. It
took a lot of monetary investment.</p>
<p>“Little Mister, Han Sen really does have the heart of a wolf!
You must save Fei Fei!” Si Tu Ya was in shock. She bled from her
mouth as she still tried to play innocent and have others do her
bidding.</p>
<p>She knew she had sold out Feng Fei Fei. If Feng Fei Fei lived,
people would know it was her. Given how popular Feng Fei Fei was
with the people, it would only lead to her death.</p>
<p>The Little Mister Si Tu Ya was referring to was the high-class
nobleman next to her. He had purple hair that looked like it was
glowing. His eyes were like the moon in the sky. His entire body
had a mysterious and noble feeling. He looked like some god
straight out of a fairytale.</p>
<p>There were a lot of humans on Feng Fei Fei’s guest list, but
there was only one real nobleman. Si Tu Ya was severely injured,
but she still insisted on trying to trick this man. She believed he
was the only one that could stop all this.</p>
<p>His name was Dou Tian Yu. He was the son of a general. He was a
real god-blood noble. He had the protection of a God Spirit. He was
certainly stronger than the average human. “Han Sen, even if you
are saving people, you must let us see what has happened to Feng
Fei Fei. Do that and assure us of her safety.” Dou Tian Yu let Si
Tu Ya go. He went toward the Holy Wen White Deer.</p>
<p>It was not certain what gene race he had combined with, but his
body developed a mysterious aura that swirled around him. It almost
looked solid. It turned into a holy light that flickered around
him.</p>
<p>His body grew bigger with every step he took. It made the power
and Holy Wen White Deer look small before him.</p>
<p>People knew this was just an illusion. Dou Tian Yu wasn’t
actually bigger. It was just because he was so strong that people
made the mistake of thinking that. They felt jealous of him.</p>
<p>Only the true god-blood nobles who were blessed by God Spirits
could possess such a power. That was someone born with noble blood
and loved by the gods.</p>
<p>Even the adult Holy Wen White Deer was scared before him. If it
was not for Han Sen’s command, it would have probably run off by
now.</p>
<p>Every step Dou Tian Yu took, he shouted, “Go away!”</p>
<p>The way he said it was not very harsh, but it seemed powerful.
It was very overbearing and suppressive. The Holy Wen White Deer
could not help but take a step back. Its body trembled. Because of
Han Sen’s command, it did not run away.</p>
<p>“If things are like that, then you cannot blame me for what I
will do,” Dou Tian Yu coldly said. His fist carried a scary god
light. He threw a punch toward the Holy Wen White Deer.</p>
<p>Si Tu Ya was watching from the back. Her face was injured, but
she looked happy. She remembered that was the gene combine skill
Jade Demon Punch. Dou Tian Yu had combined with the god-class gene
race jade crystal demon.</p>
<p>Legends claimed that the punch was indestructible, but it had
very soft power. One such punch was able to reduce a mountain into
dust. Even so, the mountain would stay still. It would remain
complete as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>When the wind blew, the mountain would fall apart. It resulted
in a sky full of dust. Even god-class gene races could not accept
such a strike.</p>
<p>To have been invited to the party, the people there had
reputations. They recognized Dou Tian Yu’s punch. Even if they did
not recognize it, they all knew something about it. People thought
it was a great shame. It was such a nice Holy Wen White Deer, but
it was now going to be blown up. It was soon to be reduced to
dust.</p>
<p>Seeing the Jade Demon Punch hit the Holy Wen White Deer, the
room was filled with a red punch power. It struck Dou Tian Yu’s
Jade Demon Punch.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>After that explosion, people were shocked to discover that Dou
Tian Yu had been struck by that red punching power. Dou Tian Yu’s
hair waved. His clothes were ruffled. His face had some weird red
on it. He had not taken the advantage. “How is that possible? He
blocked Dou Tian Yu’s Jade Demon Punch.”</p>
<p>“So scary. Han Sen has a big problem. He blocked the Jade Demon
Punch. Not many people in Jade Wall City can do such a thing.”</p>
<p>“This red light is so weird. What kind of gene race power is
that?”</p>
<p>Dou Tian Yu’s eyes glowed. He stared at the Holy Wen White Deer
that was blocking the doorframe. He coldly said, “The blood ghost
spirit. You have the blood ghost spirit! Who are</p>
<p>you?”</p>
<p>After he said that, the lobby fell silent. Everyone in the Qin
Kingdom knew about the blood ghost spirit. Mo Li used the blood
ghost spirit, which was one out of three gene races, to assassinate
the king of the Wei Kingdom to save the Qin Kingdom. It made him a
savior.</p>
<p>“No way. He is just a villager… How could he have a blood ghost
spirit gene race?” Si Tu Ya could not believe it.</p>
<p>Dou Tian Yu coldly asked, “If it was not blood ghost spirit, how
could any other gene race cancel my Jade Demon Punch in such a
fashion? This must be the blood ghost spirit!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the many high-class men in the lobby looked weird.
They thought Han Sen was just a villager with an online shop. They
never expected him to give out a mutant eight sound bug egg and
have gene races like a Holy Wen White Deer and blood ghost spirit.
Even a god-blood noble like Dou Tian Yu was punched away. How scary
was he?</p>
<p>“I am just a villager who opened a shop.” Han Sen’s voice
sounded from the room. There was nothing special about it. He was
still removing the si ming demon race from Feng Fei Fei. “If you
are not telling us, then I will come in and take a look.” Dou Tian
Yu’s eyes possessed a god light. His body flickered. He was like a
God Spirit going into the room.</p>
<p>The Holy Wen White Deer moved aside as Han Sen bid him to. He
went in front of Dou Tian Yu just as a blood-like punch came from
the room.</p>
<p>“Very good!” Dou Tian Yu coldly shouted. His fist emitted a jade
light. It was like a sun punching toward the red punch.</p>
