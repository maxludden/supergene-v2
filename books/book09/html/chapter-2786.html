<p>In that green, ripped space, a giant thing that looked like the
temple of some ancient god emerged from the crack.</p>
<p>“The Geno Hall!” The creatures of the universe, seeing the Geno
Hall appear before them, looked confused. They raised their heads
to stare uncertainly at the mysterious Geno Hall. No one had any
idea why it had shown up.</p>
<p>“The Geno Being Scroll fights finished up not too long ago. Why
is the Geno Hall appearing again?”</p>
<p>“I bet some elite triggered the door for another lantern
fight.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Last time, when Kong Fei fought, there was a
different feeling permeating the atmosphere. This feels like
something else entirely. Back then, all the stars arose. But now,
it looks like there is a wound in the universe itself. It feels
different from the way it felt before.”</p>
<p>“Yes, what is going on with the green crack? This is incredibly
strange. I have never heard of something like this before. Seeing
the green crack, I feel kind of sad. I want to cry. What is going
on?”</p>
<p>On the peak of Empty Mountain, there was a woman with a holy
horn rising from her head. She was standing next to a beast with
green fur. They were looking out across the universe’s green crack.
Their gazes were oddly intense.</p>
<p>“It has finally appeared again. It has been a billion years
since I was last able to witness the sadness of a god. I miss the
era of Mountain Leader, the man who could go against the sky and
kill gods, break the doors, and mark his place. He became a god
spirit. It has been a billion years since someone did something
like this. Today, I am able to witness god’s sadness once more,”
the green-haired beast said. He looked at the sight, an oddly
conflicted expression on his face.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who could go against the sky and slay a god right
now, though. And even claim their god spirit seat.” The horned
woman frowned.</p>
<p>“This is a good thing no matter who has done it. It proves that
the Geno Hall’s suppression is not infallible. Those gods are no
longer omnipotent opponents. We can slay them and take their
thrones,” the green-haired beast said. It looked at the sleeping
gold beast and said, “This might be Empty Mountain’s chance. With
Little Mountain Leader here, nothing can prevent Empty Mountain
from rising.”</p>
<p>Hearing the three words “Little Mountain Leader,” the woman’s
serious face showed a rare smile. “The blood of the Little Mountain
Leader isn’t pure, so its potential is unpredictable, but it can
certainly become a true god. And then, it will be able to go
against the sky and become something even greater. It will go into
the Geno Hall as Mountain Leader did. People will then know that
Empty Mountain is still here, and the race is composed of
invincible blood.”</p>
<p>Inside a scary red dwarf, there was a hidden palace. Within that
palace, there were many creatures that looked like humans. They
were staring at the god’s sadness in space.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had been there, he would have been shocked to find
God’s Retribution amongst them. He was a member of Blood
Legion.</p>
<p>“What we knew would happen has finally come to pass. For the
first time since Sacred, a war of gods has finally started anew. It
is a shame that we haven’t sufficiently prepared yet.” A man with
blue eyes stared at the sky and sighed.</p>
<p>“Although we aren’t yet prepared, it isn’t as if we don’t stand
a chance. Blood Legion has remained hidden for too long. It is time
to fight the god spirits in the sky.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.” The blue-eyed man looked at the green crack in the
distance. No one could tell what he was thinking.</p>
<p>On a small planet that belonged to the Thousand Treasures, an
old man who was holding a cloth flag frowned and looked up at the
green crack in space. He spoke to himself, saying, “This shouldn’t
be happening. Time isn’t yet up. The Geno Hall’s bindings should
still be in place. Was someone able to kill a god right now? Weird…
That shouldn’t be possible.”</p>
<p>On countless mysterious places in the universe, scary elites
stared at the green crack and the Geno Hall that was slowly
appearing. All of them were thinking about different things. Some
were very excited. Some were suspicious. Some of them were only
watching. They were watching in the hopes of finding out who had
managed to kill a god spirit and take the god spirit’s place.</p>
<p>The Geno Hall had completely revealed itself now. The whole
universe went pitch black, and only the green light shone in space
with its beautiful vacillations.</p>
<p>The door of the ancient, mysterious Geno Hall looked like it
hadn’t been opened for a billion years. Today, it was finally
opened again.</p>
<p>This was different from Kong Fei’s lantern fight. And it was
different from Ancient Water God’s fight to break through the door.
This Geno Hall’s door was completely open. Any creature from any
corner of the universe could see what was inside the door now.</p>
<p>Inside the door was a giant statue that looked like it had been
made from jade. Although it was just a statue, it was too
intimidating to be described. The mere sight of it weighed on the
mind like an anvil. When creatures with weaker minds looked at the
statue, they found themselves kneeling before they even knew what
had happened.</p>
<p>But right now, blood was trickling down from the statue’s eyes.
The sight filled everyone who saw it with sadness. It was
intimidating, but it didn’t feel as threatening as one might have
expected.</p>
<p>With many creatures watching, that statue slowly came out of the
Geno Hall. A webwork of cracks covered it.</p>
<p>When the statue passed the threshold of the Geno Hall’s door, it
shattered into a countless number of pieces that scattered
everywhere.</p>
<p>The sky shook as if a thunderstorm was rocking space itself. It
was like the sky was crying over the death of a god spirit.</p>
<p>“Who will be the new god spirit?” Sky Palace Leader squinted his
eyes. He stared at the Geno Hall with its open door.</p>
<p>A statue had departed the Geno Hall. There was an empty god slot
up there now, and there was guaranteed to be a new master to claim
the space. Sky Palace Leader wanted to know who, in that era, could
go against the sky and slay a god.</p>
<p>The other people of Sky Palace felt the same way, too. They all
stared at the Geno Hall door, and they waited for the elite who
killed a god spirit to ascend to their rightful platform as a new
god.</p>
<p>But after waiting for a long time, they still hadn’t seen a new
being fly toward the Geno Hall to claim their seat. A voice boomed
from the Geno Hall, sounding clearly across the nothingness of
space. “Sky Vine Radish has fallen. The god’s personality is lost.
Whoever has the personality of Sky Vine Radish can claim the god
spirit’s seat.”</p>
<p>Every person in the universe was shocked. A god spirit had
fallen, and the god’s personality had vanished. They had never
heard of something like this happening before. The elite that
killed Sky Vine Radish should have taken their god personality to
the Geno Hall and become a god themselves.</p>
<p>“What does it mean for a god’s personality to be lost? Does it
mean that the elite killed a god spirit and didn’t take the god’s
personality?”</p>
<p>“No way. Such a powerful thing. Why did he not take it?”</p>
<p>“Maybe the elite died alongside Sky Vine Radish.”</p>
<p>“It is possible.”</p>
<p>The hearts of many people were pounding in their chests. If the
elite and the god really had died together, then anyone could find
where the god died, claim the personality, and become a god
themselves.</p>
<p>As people all across the universe found their minds racing, the
door shut, and the Geno Hall returned to the nether. But the
sadness in the sky still lingered like a green mark. It didn’t
fade.</p>
