<p>“Little Xinxin, you are still as cute and naive as ever.” The
white-scaled woman smiled at Lan Haixin as she spoke.</p>
<p>“You… why are you here? I thought you were…” Lan Haixin was
having difficulty composing her sentences. The situation was so
incredibly unexpected that her mind was struggling to adapt.</p>
<p>The woman sighed and said, “Some unforeseen problems occurred
during my evolution, and Little Yun tried to kill me. She forced my
hand, and I had to put myself into the Siren Bottle to stay
alive.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood now. The Little Yun she had referenced was
undoubtedly the Siren Elder. It seemed that she had never actually
won over Bai Yi’s mother. The plan she concocted was actually just
a part of Bai Yi’s mother’s grand conspiracy. Even when she failed
to evolve, she had actually won.</p>
<p>The woman then looked at Han Sen. She still wore that soft
smile, and she said, “My son, I am glad to see you here.”</p>
<p>“You must have heard what the Siren Elder said. I’m not your son
Bai Yi,” Han Sen said simply.</p>
<p>The woman nodded. “I know. Bai Yi wasn’t my son, anyway.”</p>
<p>When the woman said that, Lan Haixin reeled in shock. Even Han
Sen was astonished.</p>
<p>The woman explained, “I am the Siren Virgin. I must keep my body
pure. I had no choice but to marry into the Extreme King, but I
made a deal with King Bai. I would be known as his wife, but when
it came to child-making, that would be done by another Siren woman
that I kept close by.”</p>
<p>“That person couldn’t have been the Siren Elder, could it?” Han
Sen’s heart jumped.</p>
<p>The woman gave Han Sen an appreciative look. She spoke softly to
him, saying, “Yes. It was indeed Little Yun. And she only slept
with King Bai once. She didn’t actually know about my deal with
King Bai, and she never realized that I was still a virgin.”</p>
<p>Han Sen shuddered, and he said, “Bai Yi was her son?”</p>
<p>“Kid, I like you more and more.” The woman smiled at Han Sen,
but she didn’t answer his question.</p>
<p>The realization felt like a chill sinking deep into Han Sen’s
bones. His guess had been correct, he assumed. The Siren Elder said
she had given her son for this woman. But the white-scaled woman
didn’t actually have a child. Bai Yi had the blood of King Bai and
a Siren. The only possibility was that Bai Yi was the Siren Elder’s
son, but this white-scaled woman had used some trick to take the
baby for herself. The Siren Elder had no idea, and she had believed
for all this time that her son was dead.</p>
<p>“What a frightening woman. The Siren Elder never guessed that
Bai Yi was her son. It’s lucky she didn’t find out; otherwise, she
would have done everything for Bai Yi, and she probably would have
exposed me to King Bai.” Han Sen looked at the woman’s sweet smile
and felt relieved.</p>
<p>“Kid, how about you and I strike a deal?” The woman smiled at
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What kind of deal?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You know of my situation. My body is destroyed, and I live
inside the Siren Bottle. If I do not find a body, I will fade away.
You have disguised yourself as Bai Yi. He was not my son, but he
was the son of King Bai. I assume you are aware of what might
happen if King Bai learned that you killed Bai Yi?” The woman was
straightforward, which Han Sen appreciated. “I can help you deal
with that, and I can help you make use of the Siren Bottle’s power.
But you will also have to find me a body to use. What do you
think?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound like a bad deal. I will agree to it,” Han
Sen said.</p>
<p>The woman seemed surprised. She hadn’t expected Han Sen to agree
so quickly. Her smile deepened. “Kid, I like you more and
more.”</p>
<p>“I can help you, but I do have a condition,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Speak then.” The woman nodded.</p>
<p>“You can call me by name, or you can just say ‘hey’ or ‘yo’ or
whatever. Just stop calling me a kid,” Han Sen said seriously.</p>
<p>The woman grinned at Han Sen and said, “Fine. I understand.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go,” Han Sen said, nodding to the woman.</p>
<p>“If you ever require my help, knock on the left side of the
Siren Bottle.” The woman met Han Sen’s eyes, and the Siren Bottle
stopped shining. The rainbow drained back into the Siren Bottle,
taking the woman with it. The Siren Bottle left the altar and flew
into Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>The light disappeared, and the Siren Bottle looked like nothing
more than an ordinary crystal bottle.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Siren Bottle for a moment, then put it
away.</p>
<p>That woman was strong. She had the Siren relic, the Siren
Bottle, as a base for her current existence. It was likely that not
even the little red bird could deal with her.</p>
<p>They had a temporary agreement to work together, as they really
had no reason to fight each other. If something happened that
caused them to butt heads, things would turn very bad very
quickly.</p>
<p>The woman had used the Siren Elder to bring the rest of the
Siren there to be killed. She clearly required the blood of the
Siren. Her plan had probably involved killing Bai Yi and Lan Haixin
as well.</p>
<p>But because Han Sen had been present, he had foiled the woman’s
plan. She was probably uncertain about Han Sen and his
capabilities, so she had chosen to form an alliance with him.</p>
<p>She couldn’t be trusted, though. He knew that. But right now,
working for her was a good thing for Han Sen. So, he had decided
not to expose her.</p>
<p>They both had something to gain, and they needed each other. So,
they joined forces without much trouble or negotiating.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin looked bewildered. She had listened to the entire
conversation leading up to the deal between Han Sen and the woman,
and she still didn’t really understand what had happened. It
sounded like some strange sort of joke.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Han Sen approached, and Lan Haixin grew
pale. She knew she was weak, and she couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a deified firebird. Even if he was alone, she
couldn’t hope to fight him.</p>
<p>“I’m taking my wife home. What else can I do?” Han Sen took Lan
Haixin’s arm and smiled.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare! You killed all of my people. I will not be with
you.” Lan Haixin tried to shake his hand loose, but she couldn’t
free herself. Han Sen began tugging her away from the palace.</p>
<p>“Their deaths were a result of your stupidity. Even if I hadn’t
cut them down, the Siren Elder would have killed everyone here,”
Han Sen said, his voice dispassionate.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin opened her mouth, but the words of response never
came. She looked pale, and a desperate thought crossed her
mind.</p>
<p>“If you are going to commit suicide, I will not stop you. But
think about this: you are the last Siren with virgin blood. You are
the last hope of your people. If you die now, it will be game over
for the Siren,” Han Sen said harshly.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin struggled to maintain her composure, and she did not
speak.</p>
