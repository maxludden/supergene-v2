<h2>Lancelight Breaks a Thousand Evils</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2061</h3>

<p>An invisible pressure came down from the sky, and it made Han
Sen frown. The xenogeneics and the nobles rolled back from him like
a receding tide. All they did then was surround him.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his head and saw ten beasts that looked like
birds. But they didn’t look exactly like birds, and they were
pulling a carriage. That scary presence stemmed from those
monsters.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt sick. Those ten monsters were stronger than the
Dragon Dukes, and they could very well have been King class. That
meant the person in the carriage they pulled had to be even
scarier.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not understand the Dragon society much, but he had
heard of Dragon One through Dragon Nineteen and Xius. They said he
was the absolute leader of the Dragon, but Han Sen believed him to
be young and a Duke.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen had forgotten one crucial thing. Being young as
a Dragon and being young as a human were two very different
things.</p>
<p>Humans under the age of thirty were considered young, but when
the sanctuaries were found, their lifespan was increased. The
definition of “young” was therefore pushed back.</p>
<p>Dragons had a longer lifespan, though. Their young ones could be
a few hundred years old, so that was far beyond Han Sen’s
expectations.</p>
<p>The curtains were drawn, revealing a Dragon sitting inside
wearing a crown. He was clad in black armor. Han Sen couldn’t get a
feel for his presence, but from his mere appearance, Han Sen could
tell that he was a King.</p>
<p>A male and a female Dragon also sat inside the carriage. They
didn’t look to be King class, but Han Sen sensed they were still
extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen and Dragon Nineteen ran to the black-crowned
Dragon King and bowed. “Greetings, Seven, Nine, and Big
Brother.”</p>
<p>“The Dragon King was Dragon One,” Han Sen thought. How would he
survive with a Dragon King adversary?</p>
<p>“You are Han Sen, Knife Queen’s student?” Dragon One asked the
question, but remained seated in the carriage.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Dragon One did not ask anything more. He spoke to the other
Dragon man. “Nine, go and take him. Others will think we are weak
if taking a Marquise costs too much.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Big Brother.” That young Dragon exited the carriage and
walked to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Xius saw the young Dragon walk to Han Sen, and her expression
became dire.</p>
<p>“The nine sons of the Dragon are different from ordinary
Dragons. All of them have a scary power, and Dragon One himself is
here today. There is no way Han Sen can escape from this, but I do
not know what he did to me. What if I will later be unable to break
the spell he put on me?” Xius was worried.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Dragon Nine approach with a lance. He couldn’t sense
any amazing power from the man, but Han Sen believed that he was
dangerous nonetheless. Han Sen thought he was the same level as
Sharon.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with these Dragons?” Han Sen thought to himself.
He was not worried about Dragon Nine, but he was worried about
Dragon One.</p>
<p>Nothing would be resolved by beating Dragon Nine. With Dragon
One there, though, he could not escape.</p>
<p>“Should I go back to the sanctuary again?” Han Sen really did
not want to do that.</p>
<p>“Dragon Nine!” The young Dragon stopped in front of Han Sen,
wearing red armor and carrying a lance. It was similar to the garb
Han Sen wore. It was all red.</p>
<p>Looking from afar, it would look like two Dragons were about to
engage in battle.</p>
<p>“Han Sen.” Han Sen merely said his name.</p>
<p>Dragon Nine did not speak again. He waved his red lance towards
Han Sen. His lance skills were similar to those of Dragon Thirteen
and Dragon Fifteen. That being said, those same skills were far
more wretched when yielded by Dragon Nine.</p>
<p>It made Han Sen feel that no matter how well he dodged or how
far he went, he could not escape the attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes froze, and he swung his Blood Feather Knife at
the Dragon. The knife silks came against the lancelight, but they
were broken. The lance that was sharper than a needle continued its
flight towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Blood Feather Knife’s blade struck the lance, but the lancelight
was not broken. It spun like a drill, creating a flurry of sparks
against the knife. Han Sen almost couldn’t hold it, as he was
pushed back.</p>
<p>Han Sen swung his blade three times to break the lancelight.</p>
<p>Han Sen was familiar with Marquise Evilbreaker powers. Dragon
Nine’s Evilbreaker power was far stronger than Dragon Thirteen’s,
though, and it was like a cold light.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power was no worse than Dragon Nine’s, but Dragon
Nine’s lance was too focused. It was like a small needle being
thrust into a patch of soil. There was only one small speck of
earth that would be hit, and the attack couldn’t be blocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen used an Under the Sky knife air. It was focused, but it
was still worse than Dragon Nine’s lance.</p>
<p>The Dragons were professionals when it came to concentrating
power. Fighting against them with simple force was something of a
deathwish.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to check Dragon Nine’s lance. The
sequence structure of the lance was like a beehive, and he almost
couldn’t make out the pattern of the honeycomb.</p>
<p>Han Sen just barely blocked that lance. But already, a second
lance had come. Before it ended, however, a third was on its
way.</p>
<p>The lancelights kept on coming, not cutting Han Sen a moment of
slack.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved his feet to evade Dragon Nine’s lance. Unless he
was able to concentrate power in a similar way, he would be beaten
by continuing down this road.</p>
<p>After Han Sen dodged every lancelight, the lights suddenly
exploded. That concentrated power was scarier than a Marquise’s
power should have been when it exploded.</p>
<p>It was too late for Han Sen to fight. Han Sen flapped his wings
and teleported. When he appeared again, he was a hundred meters
away. He had managed to avoid the explosion.</p>
<p>Dragon Nine kept on attacking. If the lancelight missed Han Sen,
it would explode. So, Han Sen had to keep on dodging and putting
himself in a disadvantageous state.</p>
<p>The Dragon nobles and xenogeneics that were watching were so
happy. They chanted Dragon Nine’s name so loudly that it was a
little frightening.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Blood Feather Knife hit the lance, and the lance moved
like a spinning dragon. He held Blood Feather Knife and kept
getting pushed back, with his legs cleaving two deep trenches
across the earth.</p>
