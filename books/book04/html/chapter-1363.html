    <p>“Who is that? Hopefully it’s Old Man Ji,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
    <p>
      He knew the chances of that were slim, but it was a nice thought for him
      to hope for. Unfortunately, he’d have better luck winning the lottery
      multiple times before bumping into someone he knew in that sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen followed a trail towards the shelter he had spotted. His Dongxuan
      Aura senses were tingling, informing him there weren’t just humans in the
      area, but creatures, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detection of humans there grew fainter for Han Sen, as his attention
      shifted to the shelter that was occupied by a ratio that favored a mixture
      of spirits and creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something up, not too far from Han Sen. As the distance between
      them closed, Han Sen was able to see it was a green cow, merrily grazing
      upon the snow-dressed grass.
    </p>
    <p>The green cow, seeing the approaching quintet, looked surprised.</p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep asserted himself as a diplomat and instigator of negotiations.
      He quickly trotted forward and said, “Boss Cow, what is this place? Who
      owns this shelter here, bub?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow heard what he said and replied, “This is Shadow Mountain. The
      shelter is called Shadow Shelter. The owner is a human by the name of Nan
      Litian.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow informed Cheap Sheep that the human welcomed all in his shelter,
      and was a very accepting and generous person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had not expected a human to own a shelter that was primarily
      inhabited by creatures and spirits. And as for the title of the shelter
      being Shadow Shelter, that was remarkably strange. The Alliance knew of
      only four human-owned shelters, and this name was not on that brief list.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a human did indeed rule the place, he could easily return to the
      Alliance as he pleased. If that was the case, how had Han Sen never heard
      of him before? From what Green Cow told them, he sounded like the sort
      whose name would carry some weight and fanfare back home.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does this demigod like to maintain a low profile? Does he like keeping
      things on the DL?” Han Sen curiously pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow told them it was a gold shelter, too. Nan Litian’s power was
      comparable to that of a mutant creature or a royal spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed creatures and spirits to join his club, and he had built a
      formidable alliance with those he commanded. He had done very well for
      himself, and he had achieved something Han Sen frequently had in other
      sanctuaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joining a shelter and being allowed to come and go was common, and often
      just required a small tribute. For this shelter in particular, those who
      joined it would have to cough up a primitive geno fruit each month to be
      allowed to stay. If you paid extra, you were even allowed your own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boss, this fella’ sounds like you. He even belongs to your hairless kind.
      Do you think we’ll find suitable refuge there?” Cheap Sheep asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head, knowing humans could frequently pose the worst
      threats. They were never predictable, and Han Sen knew he couldn’t waltz
      in with the assumption he and Nan Litian would become chums. He hoped they
      would, but he knew it was probably unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Han Sen could not go even if he wanted to. He would have to pay the
      toll of one primitive geno fruit, and that was something he lacked.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen asked Green Cow where he might be able to find such fruits.</p>
    <p>
      Green Cow answered, saying that the most dangerous thing one should be
      wary of was not rival creatures or rival spirits, but the plants
      themselves. It was common for many to band together and co-operate to
      retrieve the geno fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Han Sen turned to leave, Green Cow went on to say, “I say,
      moo-moo; you seem like a talented chap. Would you like to join my team? We
      are all primitive and are planning to amass a whole bundle of geno
      fruits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Dragon Lady thought following Green Cow would not be a bad
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We would gladly join you, but we haven’t yet collected a single fruit,”
      Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow told them, “That’s okay. If you want to join, we’ll welcome you
      with open arms.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Green Cow be so generous, Han Sen swiftly agreed to join her and
      her fellows. Then, on their behalf, Green Cow paid the fee that would
      enable them to stay at the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow, after bringing them to Shadow Shelter, seemed to look forward
      to introducing Han Sen and his party to her sure-to-be misfit allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadow Shelter was a gold shelter, and it was very much like a city. There
      was that metropolitan-vibe, with a hustle and bustle; it was a melting pot
      of various races and kinds, all working together. It was a charming place
      to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The civility came as a surprise, too. There was no aggression to one
      another, and every being there seemed charitable and caring.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old Cow, did you trick this entire party to follow you back here?” As
      they came in from the gate, a spirit spoke, directing his speech at Green
      Cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Dragon Lady looked at Green Cow with squinted eyes, unsure of
      what the spirit meant. Whatever the meaning was, it didn’t sound very
      positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow was quick to respond, saying, “Please, don’t pay heed to him,
      moo-moo!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard of the shelter laughed and said, “You keep tricking poor folk
      into joining your team, so they can follow you on another futile venture
      to Hidden Valley. You must have spent the lives of two hundred thus far;
      this is getting silly. How many have actually lived, following your stupid
      expeditions to that place?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard then turned to Han Sen and said, “I suggest you guys keep your
      distance from this one. She can talk her way out of a paper bag, and she’s
      as slippery as an eel in an oil slick. Don’t let those sweet emerald
      udders charm you.”
    </p>
    <p>“Green Cow, have you been dishonest with us?” Cheap Sheep asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Slow down a second and let me explain; the guard never paints anyone very
      flatteringly. And if you fellows don’t want to go, I won’t force you, but
      we should discuss these matters in proper detail. I was planning to later,
      with full transparency and all, I swear. Moo-moo!” Green Cow was tripping
      over her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not too surprised, and he knew he shouldn’t have expected free
      lodging without strings attached. It was shady from the get-go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not afraid of the conniving conspiracies that might have been
      wrought against him, though. But that aside, he at least had a place to
      stay.
    </p>
    <p>“Let’s go then. Let’s talk,” Han Sen said.</p>
    <p>
      After Green Cow paid the toll and everyone got set up, they all went to
      her room for the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way there, the creatures and spirits all looked at them
      strangely. Some had a humorous look, whereas others looked as if they held
      pity for them. Regardless, it seemed Green Cow had built herself quite the
      reputation.
