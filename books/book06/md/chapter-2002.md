Outside of Rare Beast Island, a dozen students were standing at the entrance looking around. They seemed to have grown quite bored as they waited.

A Sky student spoke to Shi Beifeng in a disgusted tone. “Brother Shi, Han Sen is too arrogant. He has made us wait here for so long, and he obviously isn’t taking your invitation seriously. Who does he think he is?”

Shi Beifeng looked at the man coldly. “If you can fight against Brother Lone Bamboo in the same fashion that he did, then I would gladly wait for you this long, as well. If you cannot, then just shut up.”

After hearing Shi Beifeng’s response, the student felt a chill. He looked away, lowered his head, and did not say anything.

They waited for another half an hour, and eventually, a legless Jade Night Crane arrived. When it landed, a man in white armor came floating down in front of Shi Beifeng.

“Brother Han, thank you for helping us.” Shi Beifeng smiled and then bowed.

The students looked Han Sen over. He didn’t look like a famous elite who had fought against Lone Bamboo, though.

“No problem. I took your money, so you are practically my employer. This is something I should do for you.” Han Sen smiled.

Shi Beifeng nodded and said, “Let’s go to Rare Beast Island. I’ll give you the details on the way.”

Shi Beifeng appreciated what Han Sen had said. He was not afraid of spending money, but he detested those who would take his money and not do the job they were commissioned to. Han Sen was expensive, but if he could get things done, it would be worth the price.

Han Sen followed Shi Beifeng to Rare Beast Island, and Shi Beifeng explained the job. What Shi Beifeng wished to capture was a mutant Earl xenogeneic. Its name was Crystal Kirin. It lived near Bibo Lake, and it was a water-aligned xenogeneic.

The Crystal Kirin could fly, run, and swim. It did all this at high speed. Its scales were very hardy, too. Shi Beifeng had to use a King class weapon to damage the scales. But even so, strikes went no deeper than the skin.

The Crystal Kirin moved incredibly fast, and it had a tendency to run off whenever it was in danger. When it was in the lake, it’d be harder to hunt, as well.

Shi Beifeng had led a few hunting parties here before, but they had been unable to capture a Crystal Kirin. Injuries were the only things they had taken off the island. So, ultimately, there was nothing they could do.

Han Sen heard what he was told, and he thought, “Mutant xenogeneic? It should be eaten! It is a waste to make it a mount.”

If the others knew what Han Sen was thinking, they’d declare him crazy. Mutant xenogeneics were incredibly rare, and for normal inhabitants of the geno universe, eating a mutant would be the waste.

“Brother Shi, let me make sure that I understand. I help you capture this Crystal Kirin, and in return, you provide me with a month to hunt xenogeneics across this island. Is that correct?” Han Sen asked Shi Beifeng.

Shi Beifeng passed a Beast Tablet to Han Sen, and he said, “This is a permit that grants you access to this place. You can come here with this card. Regardless of whether you fail or succeed, you may always return.”

Han Sen took the tablet and said, “That’s very nice. After I capture this Crystal Kirin, I will give it back to you in a month.”

Rare Beast Island was bigger than Old Night Island, and there were far more high class xenogeneics there. As they traveled, Han Sen had already detected many Earl xenogeneics.

But Shi Beifeng was in a big hurry to capture the Crystal Kirin, and so he didn’t bother with the other xenogeneics.

Bibo Lake was eight hundred miles wide, and there were many different beasts that occupied it. Water dragons could occasionally be seen playing on the shore.

“It is important to have a good dad. The xenogeneics here are of a high level, and they are of good quality, too. And compared to Xuanyuan Cave and Old Night Island, there really are a great many of them.” Han Sen sighed.

Shi Beifeng told his workers to establish camp in a nearby forest. There, they would wait for the Crystal Kirin to show up.

“The Crystal Kirin is almost always underwater, but there are too many xenogeneics beneath the surface of the lake. There are Marquises there, too. Fighting it underwater would be a bad idea for us, so we will need to wait for it to come out of the lake. Over the next few days, the Crystal Kirin is sure to show up. He will surface to eat the green flowers, but as for the exact timing, I don’t know. It’ll be sometime during the next few days.” Shi Beifeng pointed at the green flowers as he spoke.

“Then let us wait.” Han Sen nodded.

“Brother Han, how do you plan on capturing it? Do you need our help?” Shi Beifeng asked.

“You can ready the cage for the kirin, but I can take care of the rest,” Han Sen said, as he stood up and took a look around. “Before the Crystal Kirin appears, I will take a walk around the lake, so I can absorb its lovely views.”

After Han Sen left, one of the students next to Shi Beifeng said, “Brother Shi, is Han Sen being too reckless? The Crystal Kirin is so strong, and if we fail, we will have to wait another month.”

“He says what he says because he can do it. Wait and see if that is the truth,” Shi Beifeng said, after thinking for a moment.

Han Sen skirted the lake and walked for a dozen miles. He found a few Earl xenogeneics, and they were different from the ones on Old Night Island. All the xenogeneics he saw seemed to be of rare species.

Suddenly, Han Sen heard splashes from the lake. He turned around to take a look. There, he saw a white dragon that was halfway out of the water. It was spewing out a mist, as if it were absorbing the power of the earth.

“Another rare Marquise xenogeneic.” Han Sen watched it a while, before returning to camp.

Shi Beifeng was nice to talk to. He chatted with Han Sen, and it turned out that he knew a lot of things. He always had entertaining things to talk about, and he stopped the conversations from becoming boring.

Han Sen and the others had good luck. After waiting only a single day, they saw movement in the lake. Something emerged that was the size of an elephant: a kirin with jade-like scales. The kirin’s horns were shining like stars.

The Crystal Kirin came up the shore, and there, it started to eat the green flowers.

The people in the woods stopped breathing. They did not want to alert the kirin to their presence.

Han Sen knew the power of the Crystal Kirin, and its mutation made its speed greater and scales sturdier. Compared to others of the same level, it was remarkably powerful. But to Han Sen, this was the easiest sort to deal with.

The rabbit shoes appeared beneath Han Sen’s feet. He raced down to the Crystal Kirin, which startled the beast. It spat out globs of water at Han Sen, and it tried to retreat back into Bibo Lake.

Han Sen stretched out a hand that gleamed like jade. He slapped the Crystal Kirin on the back. A turtle symbol appeared there, and it brought the creature’s speed down to a crawl.

Han Sen then led the Crystal Kirin, which now walked as slow as a turtle, over to Shi Beifeng.
