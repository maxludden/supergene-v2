<p>“How is that possible? Hasn’t he only been practicing sword
skills for a year?” The old man looked at Sky Group Leader high
above with shock.</p>
<p>Sky Group Leader saw the god light screen was displaying a bit
of purple mist. After a while, he sighed and said, “Zhuo Dong Lai
really is some strange sort of genius, which is very rare to
find.”</p>
<p>The old man looked rather perplexed, but he did not know how to
respond.</p>
<p>One Dollar Sword Mind was not just any sword mind. It was a
top-class geno art of the Wu Wei Dao Palace. It was created by the
Wu Wei Dao Alpha.</p>
<p>Everything in this world started with one. One becomes two. Two
becomes three. Three makes 10,000 things. One Dollar Sword Mind
started a path to the infinite.</p>
<p>The whole Wu Wei Dao Palace legacy started with one. A gene race
of any element was able to practice with the One Dollar Sword Mind.
The sword mind would become a One Dollar Sword Mind, and a knife
mind would become a One Dollar Knife Mind.</p>
<p>Any Wu Wei Dao Palace student could try their hand at learning
the One Dollar Sword Mind, but the one who could truly be
exceptional with the mind was considered a rare and prestigious
student in Wu Wei Dao Palace.</p>
<p>It took Sky Group Leader 30 years to start basic proficiency
with the One Dollar Sword Mind. He finally had entered the door to
the big path.</p>
<p>Zhuo Dong Lai had only practiced his skills with a sword for a
year, yet he already had One Dollar Sword Mind. It was very hard to
believe.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the purple mist swirl around Zhuo Dong Lai’s
fingertips. His eyes turned bright at the sight.</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, people rarely saw people practice
the power of their minds. Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword mind was far
greater than that of Yan Bei Fei. It made Han Sen’s heart feel a
twitch.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his finger as a sword too. He pointed it at Zhuo
Dong Lai’s fingertips from afar.</p>
<p>Before the sword could move, the sword mind was already breaking
through the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the entire audience felt as if two sword minds were
rising. They did not see any knife lights or sword shadows, but it
was enough to make people feel a chill. It was like some scary
swords were piercing their bodies. It made them want to fall
back.</p>
<p>After people reacted to this, they noticed the sword mind was
only inside the space battleground. It was unable to hurt them as
they watched.</p>
<p>“That’s a very powerful sword mind!” Yan Bei Fei’s face
changed.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the only one who was shocked. The nobles of all the
kingdoms were frozen as they watched.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Zhuo Dong Lai casually moved at the same time. They
suddenly reached a spot where the two men could wave their arms for
sword airs to cross each other. They did not have the powers of
destroying the sky or destroying the ground. Nothing was brought
any harm, but it gave people the feeling that an entire army was
being slaughtered. Just watching them fight was enough to make
people’s blood boil. They wanted to go and kill as well. They
wanted to see their blood spill across the yellow sand.</p>
<p>“Today, I have noticed what can be accomplished if one takes up
the sword,” a noble who practiced with a sword said with a
sigh.</p>
<p>The humans of the universe of kingdoms were obsessed with power,
but they lacked power themselves. Thus, the fight between Zhuo Dong
Lai and Han Sen was a unique one to witness. It opened people’s
eyes to what was possible.</p>
<p>The skills of both men seemed fairly normal. They did not use
any powers that could break mountains and rivers. There were no
bright lights. Still, every thrust of a knife went into one’s
heart. Even the audience felt a chill in their hearts.</p>
<p>In a sword palace to the east, a white-bearded old man sighed
and said, “Practicing with the sword costs 50 springs and autumns.
Only by watching this sword fight can I truly realize what it means
to take up a sword.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was getting excited. He had been in the universe of
kingdoms for a long time. On this day, he had finally encountered
an elite.</p>
<p>No matter how strong someone’s power was, their power still came
from the outside. Only self-knowledge and one’s willpower defined
and made someone truly strong. Han Sen thought elites like Zhuo
Dong Lai had a powerful sense of willpower and faith. He did not
just have extreme power.</p>
<p>Han Sen used all of the sword skills he had learned to do battle
with Zhuo Dong Lai.</p>
<p>Zhuo Dong Lai only knew one skill, which was Purple Mist That
Comes from the East. He kept on using it, but it had many different
facets. There were many layers and moves to use within the same
skill set.</p>
<p>One Dollar Sword Mind provided two machines. Four machines
resulted in four elephants. Four elephants turned into gossip. To
be able to bring a sword skill to this level, it was obvious that
Zhuo Dong Lai understood a lot. He was a swordsman who was as good
as Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>He was also different from Lone Bamboo. Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword
skills were bright and obvious. They gave people a sense of
righteousness. As a person, along with his sword, he gave people a
sense of hope and not destruction.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen fell back. He ran away from the
battleground.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and looked at Zhuo Dong Lai as he asked, “Why do
you want to die?”</p>
<p>Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword skills kept pushing forward, making the
fight very intense. In the most intense moment, there was no sense
of victory. Han Sen felt he was driving toward death.</p>
<p>Zhuo Dong Lai happily laughed. “I owe someone a life. Now, he
wants to take it back. Therefore, I must pay. To be able to die
against a swordsman of your talent, I can only say it has been
worth it.”</p>
<p>“Can the life you owe only be paid back with your own life?” Han
Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhuo Dong Lai said with a nod. “Without him, I wouldn’t
be here today.” Han Sen replied, “Fine. Use all the power you have
to fight me. I want to kill a strong swordsman, not a man with a
death wish.” The blood dragon god pulse exploded. His blood-red
dragon air almost looked solid. It was like a blood dragon was
surrounding Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>“OK.” Zhuo Dong Lai looked at Han Sen and nodded.</p>
<p>The purple air was like a mist that appeared on Zhuo Dong Lai.
It turned into a purple and misty pair of clothes that draped over
Zhuo Dong Lai’s body. They created 10,000 purple lights, which made
him look like a purple sun god king.</p>
<p>His black hair turned purple. The light was like a sun that gave
people warmth.</p>
<p>His eyes were like a sun in the sky staring at everything.</p>
<p>A scary presence suddenly covered all of space. It was like the
whole battleground only had light left in it.</p>
<p>“Zhuo Dong Lai used purple mist holy clothes.” Yan Bei Fei
sighed.</p>
<p>The purple mist holy clothes moved. It did not matter if Zhuo
Dong Lai died or not, but no God Spirit would allow their members
to fight a God Spirit’s power to win in a god fight. His God Spirit
Blood-Pulse would be taken away. This just proved his God Spirit
was no good.</p>
<p>“This strong power matches your sword skills,” Han Sen said with
a nod.</p>
<p>“In that case, come,” Zhuo Dong Lai said. “Let me die when it is
the brightest time in my life.” His fingers were swords again. This
time, it was not just a purple light that appeared on his
fingertips. The entire sky looked like it was overwhelmed with a
purple light. It seemed as if it all stemmed from his fingertips.
The purple mist holy clothes were surrounded by a holy light it. It
was like 10,000 misty lights were there.</p>
<p>Zhuo Dong Lai waved his sword. Countless misty lights moved.
They unceasingly came roaring at Han Sen. Suddenly, the sky,
ground, and space only had a purple sword light in it. It was like
a flood or a disaster drowning space. The power of a sword could
kill a god or a Buddha. Even a sky full of God Spirits would change
their expressions at this sight.</p>
<p>The Annihilation God Spirit gene race’s purple mist holy clothes
gene skill and purple mist holy light buff released a misty light
that was like Zhuo Dong Lai unleashing a full-power attack. It was
too scary to imagine. “Back in the day, Wu Wei Dao Palace’s alpha
used one sword to destroy a kingdom,” Yan Dan said with a sigh.
“Today, Zhuo Dong Lai is doing something similar. It is a shame he
was born in the wrong place and grew up with the wrong person.”</p>
