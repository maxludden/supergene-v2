<p>The centipede opened its mouth to eat the little mink. It
suddenly stopped, though, and it turned to look behind itself. Tap!
Tap! Tap!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was jerking like a poorly-built robot as he
slowly approached.</p>
<p>The centipede released a weird shriek. And then, the eyes on its
back started shooting out more green light. Its body maneuvered
into a semi-circle as it did this.</p>
<p>The green light landed on Han Sen like a spotlight.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s body still moved. He wasn’t frozen in place this
time. A second later, he was walking forward once again.</p>
<p>The centipede let out another strange scream. The green light
burst forth from its eyes, shining powerfully across Han Sen, doing
its best to hold him back.</p>
<p>Despite all that green light, however, Han Sen was still
approaching the centipede. He didn’t get stuck in place, and his
pace was gradually increasing. As he drew closer, it became
apparent that the green light wasn’t actually hitting him. There
was an invisible barrier around him that kept the green light three
inches away from him.</p>
<p>That barrier, and the safety it provided, were expanding. It was
like an invisible wall, blocking the green light and red mist from
reaching him.</p>
<p>The centipede shrieked and continued firing rays of green light.
They struck the barrier and immediately disappeared. It was useless
now. And no matter how much green light the creature fired, nothing
could change the tide.</p>
<p>Han Sen calmly watched the centipede as he walked forward. The
barrier grew bigger and bigger, until the centipede was inside
it.</p>
<p>The centipede felt the danger it was in, and so it twirled its
body into a tighter defensive ball. The green, gem-like eyes were
shining brightly.</p>
<p>Inside the invisible barrier, it could still use its powers, but
the green light was twisted. The light would flash randomly around
the inside of the barrier, but none could strike Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted Ghost Teeth Knife and cut the xenogeneic
centipede in half.</p>
<p>“Viscount xenogeneic hunted: Evil-Eye Dragon. Xenogeneic Gene
found.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that was a bit of a shame. He hadn’t gotten a
beast soul that wielded that wicked power. But even so, leveling up
his Dongxuan Sutra through this battle was more than enough.</p>
<p>Tzi! Tzi!</p>
<p>The seven red mist minks squealed. They were shining. Their
tails disconnected from the plants, setting them free. When the
seven minks matured and fell off the plants, their anchors wilted
and disintegrated into dust.</p>
<p>The creatures looked incredibly scared. And it was clear that
they wished to escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to muffle their senses. Under his
blinding powers, the seven Red Mist Minks ran around like headless
chickens, unable to discern where the exit might be.</p>
<p>“Weird. It looks like these guys are really low level. They look
Baron at best.” Han Sen found this to be quite strange. After being
born in such an important place and absorbing so much red mist, how
could they only be Barons?</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his hand, and the seven of them flew right before
Han Sen. They couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed one of them to examine. They had gold hair and
bodies that were the size of a fist. Their eyes were big and took
up thirty percent of their faces. Their cheeks were plump balls,
and their tails weren’t too different from a squirrel’s tail. They
were big and fluffy things.</p>
<p>“It is a Baron. Weird.” Continuing to stifle the senses of the
seven minks with his Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen then walked over to the
centipede. He broke its body and took out the emerald eyes.</p>
<p>The evil xenogeneic’s evil eyes looked rather pretty. They were
only the size of pigeon eggs, but they gleamed green like one of
his grandmother’s emeralds.</p>
<p>Han Sen dug out each of the eyes and readied himself to leave.
The seven minks were eating the body of the centipede.</p>
<p>They were too small, and after eating a little, their stomachs
were rounded and full. Their claws could barely even touch the
ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen made them fly towards him, to tuck them into his
satchel.</p>
<p>After leaving the cave, Han Sen expanded the effect of his
Dongxuan Aura. And as Han Sen walked through the mist, it couldn’t
penetrate his barrier. It was ten meters wide by now, and Han Sen
had no issue with stifled senses. He could see all things
clearly.</p>
<p>With his Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen could search through the red
mist with great ease. He searched the entire area, though, and was
unable to find the spring.</p>
<p>“It looks like I will only be able to find it when the spring
actually erupts,” Han Sen thought to himself, as he headed for the
valley entrance. He wanted to see if there were any more annoying
enemies out there.</p>
<p>When he was beyond the valley’s exit, he saw Xie Qing King
surrounded by xenogeneics. He was fighting them like mad.</p>
<p>“Brother Qing, what are you doing here?” Han Sen walked straight
out of the valley and asked him with shock.</p>
<p>The Rebate have sent many Viscounts here, saying a decision has
been made. The spring is to be shared between everyone. Gu
Qingcheng reviewed their documents and confirmed their legitimacy.
Wang Yuhang is taking them around the mountains. I am here to
inform you.” Xie Qing King spoke all of this while he was still
engaged in combat.</p>
<p>“How did they learn there is a red mist spring here?” Han Sen
frowned.</p>
<p>Only Xie Qing King, Yisha, and the others knew about the spring.
He trusted Xie Qing King and the others. If Yisha, of all people,
had told him he should be the one to absorb the spring, then she
certainly wouldn’t have shared the information with anyone.</p>
<p>“Stop fighting. Let’s take a look at what’s going on.” Han Sen
and Xie Qing King left the area. The greedy xenogeneics wouldn’t
want to leave the valley, so they did not get chased. Xie Qing King
gave Han Sen a document. After glancing over it, Han Sen said,
“This has come from the elders, so it has to be legit.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew it was the truth, though. Otherwise, without
Yisha’s permission, the Viscounts would not have come. “Where are
they now?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“They are yelling at him about needing to be led to the spring.
There are too many of them, and Gu Qingcheng is worried they might
attack the base if their demands aren’t met. She is worried the
place will be messed up, and the women and the children could be
hurt. So, Wang Yuhang is taking them around and around.” Xie Qing
King went on to say, “Should we let Wang Yuhang get rid of them?
Take them to an area with powerful xenogeneics, to ensure they
won’t return?”</p>
<p>“This is an order from the elders. It is a decree that has been
signed by seven Kings and Yisha herself. If I don’t take them to
the red mist spring, I will be in trouble. I can’t tell Yisha that
I got them all killed.” Han Sen looked over the document, smiled,
and said, “If they want to come, let them.”</p>
