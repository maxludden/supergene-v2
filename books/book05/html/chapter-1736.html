<h2>Super Spank</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1736</h3>

<p>Everyone was in shock. The xenogeneic officer was incredibly
hard to deal with already, but now they had a real monster from the
outside to contend with.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a low-tier xenogeneic like the ones Han Sen had
already dealt with before, either. The sanctuary door led to the
Big Silence system. It was where the high-level xenogeneics
resided. There were high-tier xenogeneics there, very much like the
Dukes. If they entered, there’d be a grand disaster, just like what
had occurred to the crystallizers.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew those creatures were somewhat restricted when they
were in the sanctuary, and their strength would be limited by the
parameters of the place. They’d end up like Old Cat and get flushed
away.</p>
<p>Old Cat was a Nine-Life Cat, and it had authority in the
sanctuary. There was no need for his power to be suppressed in the
sanctuary, but the xenogeneics coming in would.</p>
<p>But the problem was, a xenogeneic could probably get off a few
attacks before it was kicked out of the sanctuary. If the
xenogeneic was too strong, even those few attacks would be enough
to level the entire Alliance.</p>
<p>The moment the xenogeneic came out, it opened its mouth in a
roar. But no sound came out; instead, a scary power gathered in its
mouth. It was ready to fire.</p>
<p>A black light was getting stronger around the creature. The
power created a vortex, generating storms in a multitude of
systems.</p>
<p>“It’s over!” Han Sen’s face changed. That xenogeneic was not a
Baron or Viscount. It was probably a Marquis, or even a Duke.
Regardless, Han Sen knew he could not fight an enemy such as
that.</p>
<p>Skills were useless in front of such raw power. That was
something that could destroy anything without question.</p>
<p>Stay Up Late’s face looked glum. Everyone thought the monster
was way too scary, too, and that it looked indestructible.</p>
<p>“Fuck! I have to try.” Han Sen knew he could not fight it, but
he couldn’t just sit around and wait for a wretched end, either. He
suddenly turned into a three-meter-tall silver ape. The
inscriptions across his geno armor all shone. A sort of power
entered his right hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his strongest attack on the monster in the sky. He
used his Super Spank power.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and Stay Up Late all used their own
strongest attacks, too. They all attacked it together.</p>
<p>All those frightening powers smacked against the beast’s mouth.
Han Sen didn’t expect that they would be able to kill it, but
destroying the power inside the being’s mouth might be able to deal
some decent damage. And releasing that much power might trigger the
sanctuary to force the creature out.</p>
<p>This was the only way, and if they couldn’t make it work, they
were all dead. No one could take that power and survive.</p>
<p>The overbearing swordlights and the high-tier holy lights and
the shocking swordair all converged on the monster’s mouth. They
didn’t do anything to the black light, though.</p>
<p>“It’s over!” Han Sen heart trembled, and he broke into a cold
sweat.</p>
<p>The others felt hopeless, too. Just like the crystallizers,
humanity was now facing an extinction event.</p>
<p>The monster’s mouth opened wider, and the black light whirled
faster. The monster lowered its head, ready to spit it all out. Han
Sen held onto Litteflower, as his brain repeatedly thought,
“Nothing can stop this.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, though, a hand emerged from the shrinking black hole
behind the monster. The hand grabbed the xenogeneic beast.</p>
<p>The hand did not look big, but the scary-looking beast shuddered
when the hand landed on it. And then, all its blood and flesh
started to fly apart. It formed a blood river, as the beast blew
into pieces under the grasp of that one small hand.</p>
<p>Everyone was in shock, and extremely happy. They were delighted
that the beast’s attack had been thwarted. They were shocked,
wondering who the hand might have belonged to. The fact that it had
just broken the monster so simply was terrifying.</p>
<p>If the hand’s master was hostile to the sanctuary, they were
afraid humans would be wiped out completely.</p>
<p>But the sanctuary gate then shut, and the black hole was only
small enough to show the hand. The body couldn’t come in.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the hand, and then, a voice followed it out.
“I did not expect to find someone like this in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Not bad.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wondered what that might have meant. He saw the hand
move, as an invisible power started to suck Littleflower in its
direction.</p>
<p>“Littleflower!” Han Sen was shocked. He didn’t care about
anything else at that moment, and with his ape body, he jumped at
Littleflower. He wanted to stop Littleflower 什om being pulled away
by the hand.</p>
<p>But the power was way too strong to deny. It pulled Han Sen into
the hand, too.</p>
<p>The hand did not look big, but when they landed on it, they felt
as small as ants on the center of its palm.</p>
<p>Before anyone did anything, the hand grabbed them both and
pulled back through the black hole. The black hole disappeared
then, too.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran almost fainted. Luo Lan and Han Yufei were extremely
worried, but there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>The sanctuary gate was shut, and they could not go out Even if
it hadn’t closed, they couldn’t hope to go up against a single
finger of that hand.</p>
<p>“Han Sen and Littleflower won’t be killed so simply.” Xie Qing
King looked at the sky. “I never expected something so strong could
be found here. I too need to get out.”</p>
<p>Everyone had a complicated expression on their faces. Gu
Qingcheng approached Zero, though, and said, “Zero, how did you
summon Han Sen here? Can you do it again?”</p>
<p>Zero shook her head. “It activated itself, and I can’t control
it. I don’t know how to do it again.”</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng did not respond. She merely lifted her sword Pure
and slashed toward Zero’s head.</p>
<p>“What are you doing!?” Everyone was shocked.</p>
