    <p>Han Sen was not surprised, as he never fully trusted Elysian Moon.</p>
    <p>
      “Telling me that now is pointless. Let’s just figure out how we’re going
      to live through the next couple hours. Let me examine your wounds.” Han
      Sen checked out her pierced shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her white skin had been gouged, and there was a lot of blood. It looked
      horrible, and as the blood continued to cascade, nothing seemed to close
      the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon tried to use her powers to stop the bleeding, but it didn’t
      work. And exhausting her powers had only made her weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen groaned. He simulated the powers of Holy Rhino and tried to imbue
      her injury with the healing properties and light. Unfortunately, that too
      was ineffective. Something was prohibiting her wound from being healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It won’t work. If my Elysium powers don’t work, then yours most certainly
      won’t.” Elysian Moon shook her head. “I’m afraid I won’t be leaving this
      place alive. I hope you can help me with one last thing before I go.”
    </p>
    <p>“What is it?” Han Sen asked, looking at her wound.</p>
    <p>
      “The chances are slim, but if you do make it out and return to the human
      world, I’ll need you to deliver a message to someone.” Elysian Moon seemed
      hesitant to tell him this, but she did anyway.
    </p>
    <p>“Who and what?” Han Sen looked at Elysian Moon.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought to himself, “It cannot be Han Jinzhi, can it? Did he trick
      the spirits, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her mouth but choked on her words. It seemed a struggle to tell
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t rush her to spit it out, though. He continued to examine
      her wounds, and it seemed as if a strange power was stopping it from
      healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had Han Sen’s super king spirit mode, this wouldn’t happen. But she
      did not have powers such as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, Elysian Moon mustered the courage to say it. She nibbled
      her lips and said, “I don’t know what her identity in the Alliance is, but
      her name is Tang You. She is a beautiful woman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised. He didn’t expect she’d want a message delivered to
      a woman, and not Han Jinzhi.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s your relationship with her? And what would you like me to say?”
      Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our relationship is none of your business, but if you do see her… Tell
      her I never hated her.” Elysian Moon spoke softly and quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I see her, I’ll tell her.” When Han Sen said that, he gathered his
      power and zapped lightning into her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Han Sen was simulating the silver fox’s healing power to strike
      the wound on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>“Argh!” She wasn’t prepared for this, and she screamed in pain.</p>
    <p>
      “What are you doing?” Elysian Moon wished to whack Han Sen’s hand away,
      but the wound that was now wrapped in lightning was actually beginning to
      heal. The broken skin began to seal and scab.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is that possible?” Elysian Moon looked at Han Sen in literal shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had learned Ghost Sword, and now he was showing her this. She was
      very surprised. His performances were continuing to surprise her more and
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both possessed an umbrella geno core. Han Sen’s silver one was able
      to block the attacks of a gemstone Geno Battle Soul, and had proven itself
      to be sturdier than her own gemstone geno core.
    </p>
    <p>Now Han Sen could heal her wounds where her own powers failed.</p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon withstood the pain of the lightning and looked at Han Sen as
      if she had just met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the lightning, her wounds were all healing. Unfortunately, she had
      bled a lot before she was able to recover, and it left her weak. And
      because the silver fox had just become a demigod, the powers Han Sen was
      simulating were rather weak. The entire healing process was a little slow,
      as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour later, Han Sen managed to heal her two most grievous injuries.
      Then, he moved on to aid her smaller wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a wound on her belly, and her green clothes had been shredded
      around it. The white skin of her torso looked lovely, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen put his hand on the wound. Perhaps it was the lightning hurting
      her too much, but her entire body shivered and she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took Han Sen more than two hours to heal her, but when he was done and
      dusted, she looked perfect. You couldn’t even tell she had been wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plenty of internal damage had been dealt, though, and she hadn’t fully
      recovered. Her lifeforce was weaker than before, but that was something
      she would have to focus on restoring herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen still had the red Ganoderma mushrooms, and if she ate one, she
      would recover much more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen was not a good person, and adding to that, she had lied to
      him. Healing her with his powers was the best he was willing to do for
      her. He wasn’t going to waste one of his precious mushrooms on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That place was very dangerous, and the red Ganoderma mushrooms might come
      in handy for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was good to have Elysian Moon at his side. She wasn’t the worst
      companion to have, and Han Sen did not mind helping her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, Han Sen had to consider the possible consequences if he ever
      returned without Elysian Moon. Gu Qingcheng might not take that kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t move!” Han Sen hissed. Elysian Moon was trying to stand up, but Han
      Sen held her in place by her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” Elysian Moon was shocked. She was still weak, and if Han Sen
      wished to hurt her, she’d be unable to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head and pointed at the river. Then, he held a finger up
      to his lips to gesture for silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon looked in the direction of the river and then noticed it.
      There was a shadow under the surface of the water, suggesting there was
      something in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon realized she had gotten the wrong idea, and she promptly
      blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was scanning the river intently, though, and hadn’t seen her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river was coated in a lot of leaves and flotsam, and the water itself
      was dirty. Under the red moon, it was almost like a blur. But the shadow
      was very clear to see. It was three to four meters long, shaped like a
      very big fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen ran his Dongxuan Aura, and he was able to sense something in the
      water that was much stronger than the minotaurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s walk away slowly,” Han Sen whispered into her ear, pulling her
      carefully back away from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after they took a single step, a big splash sounded from the river.
      Something came out with its gaping maw wide open, the smell of death
      wafting around it.
