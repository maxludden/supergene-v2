<p>“We can’t use this name. Think about his future! What if he becomes a president,</p>

<p>and everyone refers to him as President Littleflower! It’s a name that lacks strength!</p>

<p>Don’t use it.” Luo Lan was the one to reject the name first.</p>

<p>“There’s no need for him to become a president; take it from me. All you do is work</p>

<p>yourselves rotten. But this name is good! He’ll become famous by simply using it.</p>

<p>Our Littleflower will have what it takes to conquer the entire universe.” Ji Ruozhen</p>

<p>stroked his beard as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Dad, how about we accept it as a nickname and you come up with something else?”</p>

<p>Ji Yanran wasn’t very fond of the name, either.</p>

<p>The president had no choice but to concede, and so he told them, “Fine. Fine. Lucky</p>

<p>for you lot, I have a backup name. It’s not half as good, but you might like it.”</p>

<p>Hearing that, everyone felt more worried than relieved. Clearly, no one wanted Ji</p>

<p>Ruozhen to come up with more names for the baby.</p>

<p>Ji Ruozhen said, “If you really don’t like Littleflower, how about Han Fei?”</p>

<p>“Han Fei… that’s good. Yes, that is very good!” Everybody agreed this was actually a</p>

<p>decent name.</p>

<p>They were grateful he had managed to come up with an ordinary name, for they all</p>

<p>clenched their backsides when they heard he had come up with another name, that</p>

<p>was not as good by his standards. They expected him to name the baby Han Bigfoot</p>

<p>or something. That really would be awful.</p>

<p>So, after that, it was settled that the baby would be called Han Fei. Its unofficial</p>

<p>nickname remained Littleflower.</p>

<p>Ji Ruozhen continued to refer to the baby as Han Littleflower, but everyone just</p>

<p>ignored him when he did that.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s house was already full of high-tech AI-driven machinery and robots to</p>

<p>help out, but Ji Ruozhen insisted on coming over to do what he could, despite his</p>

<p>obligations and hefty workload.</p>

<p>Ji Ruozhen’s wife had also moved into Han Sen’s house for a time, under the pre-</p>

<p>tense of wanting to help out, but more than anything, she was just determined to</p>

<p>spend as much time with the baby as she could.</p>

<p>Luo Lan liked kids, but she did not like housework, and since it was her home, she</p>

<p>took every chance she could to command Ji Ruozhen’s wife to clean.</p>

<p>While the name Han Fei had been settled on, most people stuck to calling him</p>

<p>Littleflower.</p>

<p>The baby was well-behaved, and it never really cried or threw a tantrum. It swiftly led</p>

<p>to the mother-in-law believing it would one day grow up to be a remarkable person</p>

<p>and a shining example.</p>

<p>However, you could not make the baby mad. If you did, the house could end up</p>

<p>getting blown to kingdom come.</p>

<p>But the instances of the baby getting mad were very rare, and it only happened if</p>

<p>people were unusually and unnecessarily cruel to him, like Ji Ruozhen had been,</p>

<p>after picking up the baby and slapping it with no cause to.</p>

<p>Han Sen had nothing much to do in the house, especially with everyone crowding</p>

<p>there, so decided to return to the sanctuary for a bit.</p>

<p>“The geno cores level up so slowly, and that aside, I really need to generate a geno</p>

<p>core for super king spirit mode.” After thinking this, Han Sen traveled to a large valley</p>

<p>that was far beyond the middle of nowhere. There, he was going to find a way in</p>

<p>which he could generate a geno core.</p>

<p>He tried many different methods, but all were to no avail. He ended up using his old</p>

<p>trick Saving Money. And with it, he began to build up a vast reservoir of power.</p>

<p>The coin rattled between his fingers as it gathered power, and the numbers on the</p>

<p>coin ticked up to the number twenty-seven.</p>

<p>This was all Han Sen’s power multiplied by the figure of twenty-seven. Needless to</p>

<p>say, holding that much power was a difficult task.</p>

<p>But he held onto it firmly, not yet willing to let it go.</p>

<p>When the sum reached thirty, his body began to sweat profusely. It felt as if he had</p>

<p>just stepped out of the shower.</p>

<p>When the figure reached forty, the real strain began to settle in. His body was</p>

<p>trembling like mad, exhausting everything it could to hold onto that power.</p>

<p>The coin itself was glowing, having trouble containing that might. If it buckled and</p>

<p>exploded between his fingers, it was highly likely Han Sen could end up destroying</p>

<p>himself.</p>

<p>Normally, Han Sen wouldn’t hope to continue past a number this high. But on this</p>

<p>day, he was genuinely interested in seeing how far he could take Saving Money.</p>

<p>One-by-one, the figure grew higher. It hit the number fifty. If the power contained</p>

<p>inside that coin was inside his body, he’d be nothing more than a flash of light, and</p>

<p>then nothing at all.</p>

<p>Han Sen made sure to hold onto the coin carefully. He didn’t want to risk dropping it</p>

<p>on the ground.</p>

<p>With all the power inside that coin, it was becoming incredibly heavy, too. Han Sen’s</p>

<p>fingers were beginning to creak and make strange sounds as he struggled to hold it</p>

<p>up.</p>

<p>When it reached the almighty figure of one hundred, Han Sen knew he couldn’t take</p>

<p>it any further. The risk was too high and he was beginning to lose control of it.</p>

<p>Han Sen wanted to fire his coin and get rid of the power that he had bottled up inside</p>

<p>it. Unfortunately, he now realized he was unable to.</p>

<p>Han Sen understood the best he could do right now was toss it away elsewhere, so it</p>

<p>could explode.</p>

<p>He had decided to use this valley due to the presence of a strange hole there. He</p>

<p>hadn’t ventured down it before, and truthfully, he did not know precisely how deep it</p>

<p>was. He only knew that it was deep, and if he had to, he could drop the coin down</p>

<p>there and avoid blowing himself up.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t want to kill himself by mishandling the coin, but when Han Sen threw</p>

<p>the coin out, it really was too heavy. He was only three meters away from the hole,</p>

<p>but he felt as if he couldn’t even throw it ten centimeters.</p>

<p>He had to inch his way close to the hole and drop the coin in. Walking over towards</p>

<p>pit was a struggle, and each step left a crater-like bootprint in the earth. The very</p>

<p>core of his bones squealed.</p>

<p>After taking three steps, he had walked three meters. Those three meters felt like</p>

<p>three lightyears, however.</p>

<p>“Shit. Am I going to end up blowing myself up?” Han Sen stretched out his hand and</p>

<p>watched it fall slowly, under the crushing weight of that coin.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have done this. I won’t reach the hole.” The coin was about to drop.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>Cracks in the earth began shooting out from Han Sen’s feet. The ground could not</p>

<p>even handle the initial weight of the coin, and in less than a second, Han Sen felt the</p>

<p>earth around him give way. He found himself falling.</p>
