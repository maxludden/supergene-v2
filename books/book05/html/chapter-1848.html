<h2>Lotus Pool</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1848</h3>

<p>On their way to the palace, egg marks appeared on the foreheads
of both Little Silver and Xie Qing King. It was very worrying.</p>
<p>Lake Viscount gained it, as well.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King held up a mirror to examine himself. He kept
looking at it, and with a dire expression, he said, “So d*mn ugly!
The mark could at least be a flower or something. Having an egg on
my head makes me look stupid.”</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t believe that was precisely what Xie Qing King
was worrying about.</p>
<p>Little Silver was lying on Han Sen’s shoulder, not having any
particular sort of reaction.</p>
<p>With Captain Wood leading them, they had no trouble on their
journey. The power of four Marquise had already scared off most of
the xenogeneics nearby.</p>
<p>They didn’t bother killing any lower class xenogeneics they saw
along the way, as they were focused on reaching the Raven palace as
soon as they could.</p>
<p>They came to a valley, and Captain Wood cleared out the
xenogeneics that were hanging around. Deep Blue Viscount followed
closely, and spoke while pointing at a mountain.</p>
<p>“The entrance is here.”</p>
<p>“This is the peak! This is not an illusion. But there is no
door. Are you sure this is the place?” Captain Wood asked with a
frown.</p>
<p>Yes, I am sure of it,” Deep Blue Viscount said, as he trotted up
to one of the mountain’s cliffsides. He searched the wall for a
while, and eventually, pushed his hands firmly against a rock.</p>
<p>After Deep Blue Viscount pressed it, he returned to Han Sen. And
then, a boom noise sounded swiftly after. A few hundred meters of
mountain began to sink, as a higher peak began to rise behind it.
There was a door on its stone surface, one that was massive.</p>
<p>Han Sen and everyone else were in shock. The place had a grand,
powerful atmosphere, which spoke volumes about how scary the Ravens
might have been, once upon a time.</p>
<p>“How do we open the door?” Captain Wood asked Deep Blue
Viscount.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount said, “You just have to push it open. That’s
how I slipped in and slipped out.”</p>
<p>Captain Wood signaled for a Marquise to push open the stone
door. It was dozens of meters high, but the Marquise was able to
open it with a light push. There was no need for much strength.</p>
<p>What resided beyond the stone door was equally impressive in
size. Many palaces were visible inside, and the buildings extended
until they vanished into the distance.</p>
<p>“Master! You must follow behind me, with a gap of about three
meters.” Captain Wood stared at Black Steel with a serious look.
And after Black Steel agreed, the team was allowed to enter.</p>
<p>The palaces were all connected. They were all built from stone,
but they were so old, they looked very rustic and primitive. Even
with the protection of the mountain, they looked poorly kept.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a multitude of carvings on the walls, depicting
bird-like creatures. Large bird statues stood on both sides of the
plaza.</p>
<p>“Deep Blue Viscount, will there be danger up ahead? Captain Wood
asked.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount gave a wry smile. “Many warriors died before
I entered, but by the time I made it in, all was fine.”</p>
<p>“Maybe when Chiron Earl went in, they destroyed any traps left
behind by the Raven,” a Marquise suggested.</p>
<p>“That could be true, but even so, it is best to remain vigilant.
We cannot drop our guard for a single second.” Captain Wood was
speaking with a deep, authoritative voice.</p>
<p>The group of them followed behind Deep Blue Viscount as they
moved forward. It wasn’t long before they stumbled across a pile of
boney remains. They definitely belonged to Rebate.</p>
<p>“They must have been part of the previous group.” Captain Wood
checked out the bones, and noticed the skulls each had a large hole
in them. They were so big, you could squeeze a clenched fist clean
through.</p>
<p>The team kept traveling. Their path had proven to be
surprisingly uneventful. Aside from seeing the odd pile of bones
here and there, there was nothing that posed an actual threat.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought things over as he walked. “Weird. It looks like
this place has not been visited by anyone in quite a while. And
there are some creatures outside that could most certainly not have
been dealt with by a Viscount. How did Wind Viscount get into this
palace and get himself infected with the Raven’s mark?”</p>
<p>Although there was no danger, Captain Wood was being careful,
nonetheless. He didn’t speed up on his way; he remained at a slow
and steady pace.</p>
<p>After they walked a dozen miles, they went past a temple that
had also been constructed from stone. Their eyes turned bright when
they soon saw a pool of lotuses right next to it.</p>
<p>The lotus pool had no water, though. Most of the lotus’s stalks,
leaves, and flowers had all withered into death. There were only a
few living ones left in the middle. The flowers that were alive
were as white as snow. The leaves were like jade’ and with their
soft glow, they looked terrific.</p>
<p>“Is this the lotus pool you’ve been talking about?” Captain Wood
looked at Deep Blue Viscount. “This is it. I accidentally fell in
there and swallowed a lotus root. I was so hungry that I dug some
up and ate more of them. That was how my mark disappeared.” Deep
Blue Viscount looked surprised, and he desperately wanted to run to
it.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Lake Viscount and the other Barons all rushed
towards the pool.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Han Sen shouted, with a frown.</p>
<p>No one listened to Han Sen, though. They all wished to cleanse
themselves of the egg mark plaguing their foreheads by ripping out
the lotus roots and consuming them.</p>
<p>Even though it would be a temporary pause Han Sen was calling
for, it was better than getting ahead of themselves and snatching
the plants right now.</p>
<p>“Anyone who steps closer to the pool dies.” Captain Wood made a
hum. And then, the two Viscounts and the Barons stopped moving.</p>
<p>Captain Wood looked at Han Sen and said, “It looks like your
family members require some discipline.”</p>
<p>Yes, and I will give it.” Han Sen rubbed his nose. The Nobles in
his employ were mostly spies of one sort or another. They didn’t
want to listen to his orders, particularly so if claiming the
flowers meant the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>They hadn’t followed Han Sen for very long, either. So, it was
not as if Han Sen could control them.</p>
<p>“Mister Wood, I beg of you to provide me some of this lotus
root. I only need a little!” Deep Blue Viscount quickly turned to
begging.</p>
<p>After Deep Blue Viscount said this, the other Barons started to
beg, too. They all had a ticking timebomb planted on their heads,
after all.</p>
<p>But Captain Wood ignored them. He walked over to the lotus pool
and looked at the flowers. A while later he asked, “Do you know
what species of flower these are?”</p>
<p>Everyone shook their heads, not knowing what species of plant
they were.</p>
<p>“Alright… Go ahead and dig up a lotus root.” Captain Wood
frowned while he spoke to the Barons.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” the Barons responded happily.</p>
<p>You can dig it up, but if you dare steal a bite, I will cut your
heads off,” Captain Wood continued coldly. “Dig them up and I won’t
mistreat you. I won’t give you any less, leastways.”</p>
<p>The Barons looked bitter as they went forward to dig up the
lotus roots. Captain Wood and the four Marquise kept their eyes
peeled on them. No one dared to eat one of the roots against the
Captain’s orders.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you guys moving?” Captain Wood asked coldly, seeing
Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng.</p>
