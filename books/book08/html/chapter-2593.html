<h3>Chapter 2593</h3>

<p>“It sounds like you know something about the Charming God’s
Jian, but do you know what power it has?” Han Sen’s heart leaped at
the possibility. Meng Lie might be able to tell him the type of
power the purple copper jian possessed.</p>
<p>Meng Lie looked at Han Sen as if he knew what he was thinking.
But he still said, “I’m afraid you will be disappointed. The
Charming God’s Jian is the strongest race weapon in existence, and
it is also the weakest race weapon in existence. It is strong
because it has the power to supercharge a person’s charm. The Fox
alpha used it to attract everyone. If it was used well, it could
make a thousand races obey that alpha. I also say it is weak
because its powers of simple destruction are bad. It won’t help you
now.”</p>
<p>“So, you are saying it has no attack power? And therefore, it is
useless?” Han Sen didn’t believe him.</p>
<p>He fired at Meng Lie. A shockwave was created in space, and with
it, the purple copper jian disappeared.</p>
<p>When Han Sen had used the purple copper jian to defeat the
monster in the Black Hole Spider’s belly, it had revealed its true
strength. Han Sen didn’t believe it lacked destructive powers.
Pang!</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s attack reappeared, Meng Lie slashed at the jian.
His strike came against the purple copper jian.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face changed. Both of his hands moved to grab the
purple copper jian, but the weapon’s power was still active. Han
Sen tried his hardest to hold its grip, but the purple copper jian
struck his chest. He was sent flying, like an asteroid striking a
planet. He was pinned to a mountain. Han Sen lowered his head and
looked at the purple copper jian in his chest. That jian had
previously pierced through Meng Lie’s chest, but he didn’t expect
karma would repay the same strike so soon.</p>
<p>Han Sen clutched the handle of the jian and tried to pull it
out. But before he could use any strength, Meng Lie’s gold, godly
body appeared. He attacked with his gold lion head knife. His scary
gold knife light looked like it was going to cut the planet in
half.</p>
<p>The little red bird screeched like a phoenix. The fire in its
mouth became a sea of angry flames that rained down on Meng Lie. It
tried to stop Meng Lie casting that knife light to destroy Han
Sen.</p>
<p>But the little red bird was still only primitive, and the knife
in Meng Lie’s right hand had the same level of power. His right
hand turned that power into a shield that covered the sky. It
extinguished the little red bird’s fire.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Miss Mirror sighed. “In the end, Han Sen still
needs to die. It would have been okay if he had just killed Bai Yi.
He might have still been allowed to live. But now that he has the
true god Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze and the race weapon of the
Fox. He must die.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A scary gold knife light appeared, and the whole planet
exploded. The destruction caused by the gold knife light was so
bright that the entire galaxy shone with its radiance. Shockwaves
washed through the system.</p>
<p>“Han Sen.” Yisha was engaged with Miss Mirror, so she couldn’t
go and help. When she saw that explosion of power, her face fell.
“Captain! It is all over.” Far away, inside the white whale, all of
the pirates were shocked. Their faces looked cold.</p>
<p>Even a deified would have died if they were hit by that much
power. Plus, Han Sen wasn’t deified. He only used treasures of that
class.</p>
<p>The pirates were thinking about whether or not they should kneel
and beg. If they did, they might be permitted to live. On the other
hand, the captured Extreme King knights inside the white whale were
delighted.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is dead. You guys are next!” one of the Extreme King
knights said menacingly to a pirate.</p>
<p>ena</p>
<p>Slap! The Extreme King knight who said that was smacked to the
floor. Bao’er then went to clean her hand, as if she had touched
something dirty.</p>
<p>The Extreme King knight was rolling around on the floor,
clutching his injured face. His teeth had been broken and his jaw
had been shattered.</p>
<p>The other Extreme King knights didn’t say anything more. They
had almost forgotten that the little demon was still onboard the
ship.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at the Extreme King knights. They all lowered
their heads, not daring to meet her gaze.</p>
<p>“My Dad won’t die,” Bao’er said with disdain. Then, she looked
back out into space.</p>
<p>The Extreme King knights didn’t say anything to the contrary,
but they thought to themselves, “Han Sen only has a few deified
weapons. How could he possibly compete with Meng Lie? He will be
dead. And up next will be you, you little demon.”After a while, the
power shining around the wreckage of the planet began to dim. And
then, Fang Qing Yu suddenly shouted, “Han Sen isn’t dead!” The
pirates and the Extreme King knights looked over there. They
couldn’t believe their eyes. They saw Han Sen suspended in space,
holding a shield that had protected his body. Due to the fact that
the planet had exploded, his armor and feathers were a little
blackened. But he hadn’t been badly wounded.</p>
<p>The worst wound he had was the wound delivered by the purple
copper jian, which was in his chest.</p>
<p>“I forgot you have the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze, but the
Medusa’s Gaze isn’t a race weapon. It isn’t smart enough. It won’t
follow your orders, and you cannot use it like the Charming God’s
Jian. It would be annoying if it did.” Meng Lie’s eyes were on fire
as he looked down at the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze.</p>
<p>Han Sen coughed, and a trickle of blood spilled over his lips.
He looked at Meng Lie coldly and said, “Are you sure I cannot use
it?”</p>
<p>“The Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze was the true god weapon of the
alpha of the Ghana,” Meng Lie said with a sneer. “Back then, it was
a deified weapon that was in the top ten in existence. Its power
was comparable to the Ghana’s race weapon Purgatory Heaven. But
there is a big difference between true god weapons and race
weapons. Race weapons are their own life forms, in a way. They can
think for themselves and make judgments. If they approve of a user,
then the user can still activate their power, even if the
creature’s level is low. But true god weapons are different.
Without true god powers, you cannot make use of a true god weapon’s
power. If a low-level deified has the same element as the true god
weapon, they can use a little of its power. But you aren’t deified,
and your power isn’t compatible with the Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze. So, you cannot activate its power. You cannot tap into
1/10,000th of its power. You can only use it as an ordinary
shield.”</p>
<p>“It is a shame that the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze is a shield.
Despite that, its power doesn’t lie in defense,” Meng Lie said all
of this, and then he generated a scary gold power. The gold lion
head knife now possessed a god light that shocked the whole world.
It was like the universe was going to be cut in half by this god
light.</p>
<p>Seeing that Meng Lie was going to unleash that knife light, Han
Sen’s face didn’t change. He still held the Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze tight. As he watched that seemingly all-powerful knife light
form, the power in his body madly rushed into the Shield of the
Medusa’s Gaze.</p>
<p>There was a weird, pretty-looking woman carved atop the shield.
Suddenly, a light appeared in her closed eyes.</p>
