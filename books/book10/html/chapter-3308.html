<p>The nine-headed monster’s arms, which were going to hit Ning Yue
and Sheep, had a sword air come out from it. An arm was cut off.
The nine-headed monster squealed. Its broken arm bled like a
fountain of bloody, red water.</p>
<p>“I am going to kill you!” All of the nine-headed monster’s heads
roared together. Nine different powers gathered together. Another
fist deployed nine evil lights. They madly punched at Ning Yue.</p>
<p>Ning Yue let the little green sword go. He allowed the little
sword to float in front of him. He did not look at the scary power
that came from the little green sword. A man and a sword did not
move.</p>
<p>As the nine evil lights were coming closer, Ning Yue did not
move a muscle. The little green sword made a buzzing noise. It
released a strange sword cry. It turned into a green peacock that
went straight for Ning Yue.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The nine evil lights detonated on Ning Yue. Everything around
seemed to rise up. The nine evil lights shattered.</p>
<p>Sheep was hiding behind Ning Yue. His eyes were wide open.
Within the nine lights, a green color kept spreading. The nine god
lights could not get closer.</p>
<p>As the nine god lights faded, Ning Yue was still standing where
he had been. He looked unharmed, but his body was adorned in
beautiful, green feather clothing. He was like a proud, green
peacock.</p>
<p>Ning Yue looked into the sky. He lifted his lips to smile and
said, “I am back…”</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you talking about?” The nine-headed weird
beast roared. He threw more punches at Ning Yue, one after
another.</p>
<p>Ning Yue calmly looked at the nine-headed monster, whose futile
strikes could not accomplish anything. His feather clothing had
many peacock feathers coming out. They turned into many green sword
lights.</p>
<p>The nine-headed monster’s nine god light came again. It was
pierced by a green light. No matter how many nine god lights the
nine-headed monster unleashed, the same results happened every
time.</p>
<p>On top of that, Ning Yue’s body was decked in more and more
peacock feathers as time went by. The nine-headed monster was
unable to stop it. A green sword light suddenly pierced through its
head and broke it. That couldn’t be stopped either.</p>
<p>The head immediately grew back.</p>
<p>The nine-headed monster madly roared, “You cannot kill me! I am
going to rip you apart!”</p>
<p>After that, the nine-headed monster raised its head. It was
going to jump on Ning Yue.</p>
<p>Ning Yue squinted his eyes. The feathers on the peacock’s train
were lined up straight behind him. He became a sky full of sword
lights going for the nine-headed monster.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>The nine-headed monster tried its hardest to swing its fists,
but there were more and more sword lights piercing through its body
and head. Suddenly, its body and nine heads were broken.</p>
<p>The nine-headed monster’s giant body turned into a blood mist.
It did not heal itself.</p>
<p>“Holy crap! This person, who is not a guy and not a girl, is so
strong.” Sheep’s mouth was agape in awe of the spectacle. He could
not believe Ning Yue, who was such a noble-looking peacock, was the
same Ning Yue as the one that was always a wimp. He just couldn’t
picture it. He was too used to seeing him cry all day long.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We now have extra big trouble.” The feathers on Ning
Yue’s body had become wings. He prepared his body to fly up.
Suddenly, he turned into a green light and disappeared into the
sky.</p>
<p>Sheep realized what was happening. He looked in Ning Yue’s
direction and shouted, “Wait for me! Do not leave me!”</p>
<p>A green peacock feather floated down. It scared Sheep. He
thought Ning Yue was going to kill him.</p>
<p>The peacock feather stopped near Sheep. It bent into a curve to
carry Sheep up and away at a speed to break through space.
Suddenly, he flew into the sky.</p>
<p>Very High and Mirror Lake was host to many elites fighting for
their lives, but Outer Sky had more and more Break World beasts
showing up. They could not control it anymore.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin stepped forward. His feet moved like they were
stepping on a lotus flower. He stepped on the back of a
phoenix-like Break World beast. No matter how that weird bird flew,
Yu Shanxin was practically attached to its back. The beast couldn’t
shake its rider.</p>
<p>Although Yu Shanxin could not beat the Break World beast, the
Break World beast could do nothing to hurt Yu Shanxin.</p>
<p>“It looks like it is my fortuitous time as the silkworm is now
done,” Yu Shanxin said with a sigh.</p>
<p>He felt as if chains had been unlocked within his body. It made
Yu Shanxin’s body harder to touch. He followed the phoenix-like
Break World beast that was flying in the sky.</p>
<p>In the seven kingdoms, there were many Break World beasts. The
number of Break World beasts was less than the number invading the
geno universe. Even so, the seven kingdoms were incurring
significant damage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the seven kingdoms had Break World elites to
safeguard their realms. Furthermore, they believed in God Spirits.
They had the protection of the God Spirits. Things there were not
as bad as they were in the geno universe. The fights were not so
devastating.</p>
<p>Han Sen had initially planned on flying back to the Space
Garden, but he didn’t move. Ancient Devil suddenly arrived before
him.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, are you interested in going to the 33 skies?” Ancient
Devil knew Han Sen was there, which was why he looked for him.</p>
<p>“I do not have the time for that right now.” After saying that,
Han Sen readied himself to leave.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil asked, “If we do not put the main and the reverse
universal tracks back together, how many Break World beasts do you
think you will be able to kill? Plus, the targets of the life souls
are not just xenogeneics. They might even possess your family and
friends. Are you going to kill them too?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil and asked, “What do you
mean?”</p>
<p>He knew Ancient Devil was right. No matter how strong his power
was, he could not kill all the life souls singlehandedly. He would
not be able to keep everyone he cared about safe.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil looked at the black hole in the sky as he said,
“If I have guessed things correctly, Sky King must have woken
up.”</p>
<p>“What is Sky King’s history?” Han Sen guessed this might have
something to do with Sky King. He had only just broken the world,
yet he could use many of the weapon gene races located in the
Soldier Knife Sky. Plus, Qin Xiu needing him so badly had to mean
something. It was enough for Han Sen to make some predictions and
judgments.</p>
<p>“Back then, God Chaos Party brought down the geno hall,” Ancient
Devil said. “In the end, the last god hall leader successfully
rebooted the universe. The results of doing that were far from
perfect, but it was not as if it had been a useless thing to do.
The universe of kingdom’s universal rules are very broken. The
buffer zone between the two universes was split into 33 skies. That
did not happen suddenly. The old leader prepared for this a long
time ago.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil smiled. “To break the supremacy of the God
Spirits, a new order must be built to take over. The 33 skies are
the new god world the old leader wanted. After the geno hall was
destroyed, the 33 skies were to become the center between both
universes and control the process of reincarnation between all
living things. It was to be beyond everything.”</p>
