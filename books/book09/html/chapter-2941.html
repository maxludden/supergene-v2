<h3>Chapter 2941</h3>

<p>Han Sen’s heart felt that chill. It seemed like his eyes were
shutting, and he had no control over them. It was different from
how it felt when he faced the nine-eyed sword. This time, Han Sen
not only felt tired, but his will also seemed to be blurry.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder that is a god personality armament. It is much
stronger than that nine-eyed sword.” Han Sen’s will was like steel,
so it was not easy for Nine Thousand King’s god personality
armament to try and control him. The big goldfish was affected by
the rabid power. Its will was not so clear. It swam toward the
pavilion.</p>
<p>“Nine Thousand King, do you really think I, Han Sen, am
rubbish?” Han Sen’s face looked calm. Almost at the same time, he
vanished. In the next second, he was in front of Nine Thousand King
with his knife directly before his neck.</p>
<p>Although Nine Thousand King was rather afraid of Han Sen, he was
even more afraid of Sacred Leader. He would rather fight Han Sen
than risk touching an object left behind by Sacred Leader. He did
not want to get hurt by it.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King lifted his left arm to block Han Sen’s knife.
With the Thousand Eye Battle Armor, he did not have to be afraid of
Han Sen’s knife. The other fist gathered up some weird power and
released some green light through an eye. He was attacking Han
Sen’s belly.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King suddenly noticed that his arm and his fists
were still a foot away from Han Sen. He could not get close.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knife slashed across his unprotected neck. His neck
had a wound that revealed the bone inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “It is no wonder he is a true god that’s
top-class. My full power attack only cut his skin. I cannot even
break his bone.” His hand did not stop.</p>
<p>Han Sen was like a god demon as he waved the cause karma knife.
The knife lights slashed across each other. Every knife slashed
across Nine Thousand King’s neck.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King’s body kept changing. He was trying to block
or dodge Han Sen’s knife lights. He shockingly discovered that no
matter how fast he was, he could not dodge or block the attacks. It
was like he had been made terribly slow.</p>
<p>“Time area!” Nine Thousand King shockingly screamed. He saw what
power Han Sen was using now.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so cold. He did not say anything. He kept on
slashing and slashing. Nine Thousand King’s neck wound was getting
deeper and deeper. Even the bone had been given a few deep marks.
God blood kept flowing. The purple fire on the wound kept
spreading. That was teeth power’s power.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King’s armor kept flickering with a weird light.
In the time area, although they were only a foot away from each
other, nothing it did landed on Han Sen.</p>
<p>God blood was oozing. Nine Thousand King was triggered. He madly
asked, “Han Sen, do you really think you can do whatever you want
with a time area? Today, I will let you know why I am called Nine
Thousand King.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes moved. He saw Nine Thousand King had some weird
shadow. That shadow was like some angry demon crawling out of hell.
It looked extremely murderous. It made people feel a chill by just
looking at it.</p>
<p>When that mad demon shadow came out, Nine Thousand King’s entire
body was like an erupting volcano. He expanded a lot. Some weird
atmosphere covered the holy garden.</p>
<p>“One second is a thousand years!” Nine Thousand King madly
shouted. All the weird eyes on the armor opened. The eye lights
went past the time area to strike Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Can it break the time area restrictions? What kind of geno art
is that?” Han Sen was shocked. He teleported away from Nine
Thousand King to dodge the light.</p>
<p>“One second is a thousand years. I can turn a thousand into one
second. No matter how strong your time area is, you cannot black my
One Second Is a Thousand Years.” Nine Thousand King coldly looked
at Han Sen. His body exploded with light. This time, the light on
his armor was like a weird and green sun. It shone across the holy
garden. If Han Sen did not leave, he was going to be hit with the
light.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that Nine Thousand King said what he did about one
second being a thousand years was most likely a bluff. He could
probably only do one second for a year. Even so, it broke his time
area, which was a difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>When the eye light came down, there was nowhere to go to avoid
it. Han Sen could not leave the holy garden. All he could do was
rely on the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze to block the scary eye
light.</p>
<p>The goldfish family arrived at the stone pavilion, but the stone
pavilion could not block the light. The two of them were controlled
by the eye light. Their eyes became green lightbulbs, and their
bodies swam toward Wan’er’s statue.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He used the shield, but he could only protect
himself and Bao’er with it. He could not protect the goldfish
family with it.</p>
<p>The worst off, however, was Yang Yun Sheng. He was already
heavily injured and lying on the floor. He was unable to get up.
Now, he was affected by the Thousand Eye Battle Armor. His eyes
became lightbulbs. Ignoring his wounds, he somehow got up and flew
to the stone pavilion.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>There were three loud noises. The goldfish family and Yang Yun
Sheng had barely touched the clothes of the statue and been sent
flying across the holy garden.</p>
<p>Yang Yun Sheng was injured. Even though he was controlled by the
Thousand Eye Battle Armor, he could no longer get up. He was
covered in blood. The goldfish family was injured too, but their
injuries were not as severe.</p>
<p>“One second is a thousand years!” Nine Thousand King shouted.
The Thousand Eye Battle Armor released a scary eye light again.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed that Nine Thousand King’s silver hair was
looking a bit white, and his skin had a few wrinkles. He suddenly
understood and said, “This old man’s one second is a thousand years
will speed up his own time too. The more he speeds up, the older he
gets. This geno art will spend his lifespan. It is no wonder he did
not use it until now. He did not dare to use it freely. He only
uses it during important moments.”</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen thought, Nine Thousand King’s One Second Is a
Thousand Years sped up the time of others and his own time. If he
kept using One Second Is a Thousand Years, Han Sen would not even
have to fight. The man would just grow old and die.</p>
<p>“Weird. Nine Thousand King’s original power is not time. How can
he use a time geno art like One Second Is a Thousand Years?” Han
Sen started to think it was weird, so he checked Nine Thousand King
out.</p>
<p>Under the power and influence of the Thousand Eye Battle Armor,
the goldfish family hit the statue again. This time, Nine Thousand
King used more power. The big goldfish was not supposed to be
controlled easily, but the big goldfish had rabid power. It meant
its will was not so clear. It was worse than the small goldfish. It
sped up to the statue.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The big goldfish’s body hit the statue. The statue moved a
little. The big goldfish’s body flew away again.</p>
<p>At the same time, the statue had some holy light.</p>
