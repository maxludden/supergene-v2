A power went into his Sea of Soul. All the beast souls and geno cores suffered underneath that strength.

Han Sen felt terrible. He heard someone say it was best not to bring geno cores and beast souls to level up. But Han Sen wasn’t prepared for any of this, as he had been pulled inside unexpectedly. The beast souls and geno cores were in there with him right now, and they were subject to the cleansing.

The elements didn’t align, and the initial impact dealt a lot of damage to his beast souls and geno cores. The lower tier beast souls and geno cores were outright obliterated by the destructive power.

That was the power that was needed to rebuild the body, though. And as fruitful as it might later prove, it was currently feeling like one major disaster. Still, he knew he had to accept all that power so he could be rebuilt. In his current condition, Han Sen was losing molecules. The geno cores that were supposed to help rebuild his body were grievously damaged by the force that would do so. The geno cores were failing to reconstruct Han Sen’s body, and instead, they were being destroyed.

Just as Han Sen thought it was all over for him, he felt something tingle inside his Sea of Soul. The black crystal armor was pulsating with a strange power. It started to give off a protective aura that provided shelter for Han Sen’s geno cores and molecules. It was keeping Han Sen’s Sea of Soul safe.

But that power could only protect his geno cores, beast souls, and molecules. The armor was unable to protect the part of Han Sen that had been his actual body. That was because the elements did not match, and the rebuilding powers were incompatible with Han Sen.

The pain was horrific. Han Sen knew it was wrong to have entered someone else’s God’s Door. He had not been killed, but his body and genes were too powerful, and he could not integrate with the rebuilding forces.

“Do I have to enter the Alliance like this? I am afraid Mom will not be able to recognize me.” Han Sen was laughing in his heart.

“Dad?” As this happened, Han Sen heard a familiar voice. He was so happy to hear it. He hadn’t seen Bao’er follow him in, and he was worried Bao’er might be damaged by the God’s Door.

Han Sen wanted to talk back, but he found himself unable to. He was only a collection of molecules and a sense of will. He could not talk to Bao’er.

“Dad! Bao’er will help you.” Han Sen heard Bao’er speak again, and he wondered why she wanted to help him. And then, he suddenly felt a weird power in his molecular state.

When that power entered him, the black armor’s power was not stopped. The power just melted into Han Sen’s molecules.

When that power blended into the molecules, the black armor’s power relented. The rebuilding power moved back inside the molecules, then.

This time, it was different. The rebuilding power did not damage the molecules, and instead, it blended in with them. It began to rebuild Han Sen’s molecules.

With the power of the molecules, his four geno cores started to get rebuilt as well.

Pang!

Inside his Sea of Soul, the Split-Blade geno core could not handle the power. It exploded into nothing but dust.

Pang!

The Fallen Slaughter beast soul was blown up by the same power.

Many things inside his Sea of Soul exploded, one after another. The beast souls and geno cores Han Sen possessed were getting destroyed.

It was not like the Black Crystal Armor was incapable of protecting them, though. When Han Sen’s body started to get rebuilt, the beast souls and geno cores were exiled.

Little Angel and Golden Growler were strong, though. They didn’t get blown up by the rebuilding power, but they got squeezed out of the Sea of Soul and the connection Han Sen had with them was severed.

Suddenly, the God geno core came out of the Sea of Soul and combined with Han Sen’s molecules. The same applied to the other four self geno cores. They all combined with his molecules.

When the five geno cores melted into him and merged with his molecules, they kickstarted a process that started to rebuild Han Sen’s body.

It was strange to see a body get rebuilt. There was the blood, flesh, bones, hair, heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys, all coming together. It was a really weird thing to watch.

While the rebuilding process was underway, a sense of feeling started to return to Han Sen. But inside that weird dimension, Han Sen could not feel anything physical around him. All he could feel was himself.

His new, rebuilt body felt as familiar as it did strange. Han Sen knew he was inhabiting his own body, but it felt different.

When the body was finished being rebuilt, Han Sen recovered his control of his body and his Sea of Soul.

The Black Crystal Armor no longer showed any activity. Han Sen used his heart, but he could not establish a connection with it This disappointed him.

He thought he had become a god, and through that, he could now make proper use of the Black Crystal Armor. That was still not to be.

Inside the Sea of Soul, there was only the black armor and the white armor. He had stolen the latter from Tina.

Han Sen was unable to control the black armorset, so he tried using The Story of Genes. The white armor, however, listened to his core and wrapped up his entire body.

The moment he was wearing that armor, he could see everything around him in startling clarity.

He was in a giant crystal passageway. The light of twinkling crystals and a strange power was all around, and not too far from him, Han Sen caught sight of Bao’er. She rushed toward him.

Bao’er looked different now. She was wearing an armor that looked like maple leaves, and she was holding a mini gourd.

She scrambled over to see Han Sen.

When Han Sen returned to normal, Bao’er jumped towards him.

Han Sen patted Bao’er on the head. And then, he caught sight of Little Angel and Golden Growler. Golden Growler looked similar to how he always had. He was, however, clad in a golden armor.

There was something vaguely different about Golden Growler’s appearance, but Han Sen couldn’t pinpoint the exact difference.

Little Angel was inside the crystal light, with her body undergoing a change. It looked like her body was still being rebuilt, just as Han Sen’s had. She was in the final stage of that process and was almost done.

When Little Angel finished, the armor Han Sen had received from Marily appeared on her. And now Han Sen knew why Golden Growler looked different Both Little Angel and Golden Growler had received completely new bodies, and they were no longer bound to his Sea of Soul.

Han Sen was so happy seeing Little Angel and Golden Growler succeed alongside him.

Han Sen looked around him and did not see Ancient Devil, however. He was unsure if Ancient Devil had failed and died, or if he had managed to successfully enter the Alliance.
