<p>Golden Growler didn’t go soft like Han Sen had. He moved in
front of Han Sen, growling toward the green-haired beast The golden
light on his body was gleaming strongly, and he looked
murderous.</p>
<p>The green-haired beast, seeing Golden Growler behavior, looked
annoyed. He coldly said, “You possess the blood of the king. The
King of Unsolid Mountain. How can you associate yourself with a
lesser race like this?”</p>
<p>The green-haired beast displayed its fangs. The mouth had not
looked too big at first, but now it looked wide enough to swallow
an elephant. Its fangs were messy and jagged, unlike those of an
ordinary animal.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to launch his super god spirit mode, but
Golden Growler roared and jumped toward the green-haired beast’s
mouth.</p>
<p>The green-haired beast did not want to hurt Golden Growler,
though, so it did not bite. It grabbed Golden Growler by the fur of
his scruff. Then, the beast turned to look at Han Sen coldly. A
second later, it took off, abandoning the planet’s atmosphere. It
disappeared, right before Han Sen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not underestimate the power a creature like that
possessed because he flat-out could not. Golden Growler’s presence
was the only reason that such a powerful creature had even spared
him a glance. It wouldn’t even waste effort biting him. A lesser
race like Han Sen would not even make a decent meal.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care about that, though. What made him feel most
poorly about this was the fact that Golden Growler had been stolen.
It was difficult to explain the mesh of feelings.</p>
<p>“Unsolid Mountain.” Han Sen looked up into the sky, searing the
word into his memory.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not feel sad. Sadness was the weakest and most
pointless emotion to have when you needed to rise to a
challenge.</p>
<p>Han Sen could only take comfort in the knowledge that the
green-haired beast would not harm Golden Growler. Clearly, it had
some connection to Golden Growler. That was the only good news he
could glean. And that also meant he had time to do something about
it all. He didn’t have the time to wallow in sadness.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to Qiao’s house knackered. The green-haired
beast had only roared, and it made his body floppy. The gulf in
power between him and the beast was far too much.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been happy that Golden Growler had managed to
evolve, but he wasn’t anymore.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how the green-haired beast had managed to
find Golden Growler, either. This was something that worried him.
If Little Angel had the same issue when she evolved, there’d be
nothing Han Sen could do to stop that.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t entered super god spirit mode, and he hadn’t
taken Golden Growler back to the sanctuary. It was too late, and
that was the reason.</p>
<p>Not all creatures could live in the sanctuary, but Golden
Growler was a xenogeneic. That meant he’d be kicked out, upon a
return.</p>
<p>If he was kicked out, he’d end up someplace in the Big Silence
system. There’d be a high chance of him dying if he ended up there.
So, Han Sen knew it was best not to try that He’d only be
endangering him further.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked for information regarding Unsolid Mountain, and
he discovered nothing. Aside from the name, he knew nothing.</p>
<p>Han Sen pondered the issue for a long time. He called up Third
Master and asked about Unsolid Mountain.</p>
<p>When Third Master heard the name, his face changed. He didn’t
answer Han Sen’s question, and instead, with a terrible look,
asked, “Have you provoked a creature belonging to Unsolid
Mountain?”</p>
<p>“No. The place is just something I heard about.” Han Sen knew
Third Master must know something.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well if you did provoke them, you can’t talk to me right
now.” Third Master was starting to look a bit better.</p>
<p>After a while, Third Master went on to say, “Unsolid Mountain is
a place I cannot tell you about. Not even my old man can tell you
about it. Holy Heaven is the Feathers’ headquarters. Unsolid Heaven
is the headquarters for creatures that are far scarier than any
from Holy Heaven. That is a world for xenogeneics. Not just any can
find themselves there. For your sake, I hope you never have the
misfortune to interact with any hailing from that sordid
place.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded, and then Third Master stopped talking. This was
all Han Sen was able to learn, and he had no clue of the
location.</p>
<p>“Golden Growler’s bloodline can be traced to Unsolid Mountain’s
king. So, does that mean Golden Growler is a creature created by
the crystallizers, with the genes of another race?” Han Sen
wondered to himself. After all, Golden Growler was amazing. And he
was different from all the other creatures Han Sen had known.</p>
<p>But it did not matter now. While Han Sen knew this place
existed, he could not do anything about it,</p>
<p>“I’m too weak. I need to become stronger.” Han Sen didn’t think
he could carry on like this, and he had to level up.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he was different from the inhabitants of the geno
universe. If he had xenogeneic genes, he could ascend in power. He
didn’t have to sluggishly level up through slow practice like the
average Noble or xenogeneic.</p>
<p>In the western side of Gran City, Han Sen could not get many
xenogeneic materials. He had discovered only one way, thus far, to
obtain the ingredients he needed. And that was traversing the
xenogeneic space.</p>
<p>About five hundred miles away from town, there was a xenogeneic
space with some Viscounts. Han Sen wanted to push his luck and
venture out there.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Qiao he wanted to dare the xenogeneic space, and
Qiao’s eyes opened wide. She nibbled her lips and said,</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I know you are strong, but any xenogeneic space is
dangerous. Not even Nobles think they could live out there.”</p>
<p>“If there aren’t any accidents, I will be there for two months.
If you are willing, I can find another Baron to work in my stead,”
Han Sen told Qiao.</p>
<p>“That has nothing to do with it. You know, Viscount xenogeneics
aren’t something that a normal xenogeneic can deal with. You are
putting your life in serious risk,” Qiao said, clearly annoyed.</p>
<p>Han Sen drew his Rhino Horn Dagger and gave it back to Qiao. He
said, “Qiao, thank you for taking care of me. But there is
something I must do.”</p>
<p>“But…” Qiao wished to say something, but Han Sen’s actions
stopped her.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out a thin sheet of metal. Qiao knew that it was
a xenogeneic nail from a Baron Han Sen had killed only two days
ago.</p>
<p>Qiao watched as Han Sen’s right thumb and finger pushed against
the metal. It was only a slight movement, but the nail broke.</p>
<p>The sheet of metal was cut in half.</p>
<p>Qiao’s eyes opened even wider, and she looked on in utter
disbelief. A Baron Noble could not break a Baron material with
their bare hands.</p>
