<h2>Beating a Half-Deified</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2266</h3>

<p>Han Sen stood on the lotus mountain, watching with great delight
as the blood kirin entered the fray. Han Sen guessed that the
creature had finished consuming the black kirin, because it was now
half-deified. On top of that, it was still inside the White Bone
Hell. The ferocity of its attack sent Edward and Ice Blue Knight
King reeling back.</p>
<p>After mere seconds had passed, the blood kirin had already torn
two King class Ice Blue Knights to shreds. Joy sparked in Han Sen’s
chest as he saw the wretchedly wild face of the creature.</p>
<p>“You guys hold off this beast! I will go after Han Sen,” Edward
shouted. He rushed across the battlefield, headed for the lotus
mountain with the intent of catching Han Sen once and for all.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was in a killing frenzy, and it paid no
attention to guarding its flanks. It pressed the attack against Ice
Blue Knight King without sparing a glance at Edward.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed. “This thing’s intelligence needs to be
increased.”</p>
<p>Although Fox Queen had whipped Edward and injured him badly in
the process, his half-deified body wasn’t to be underestimated. He
circled the battle and arrived in front of Han Sen in moments. Han
Sen knew that trying to outrun the man with simple speed would be
impossible.</p>
<p>Han Sen slapped the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum at his waist,
sending a burst of scary sonic power toward Edward’s forehead. The
power flew out like a barrage of toxic needles.</p>
<p>Edward grunted dismissively, and his whole body turned to a
golden color. The Blood Scorpion’s toxic needles struck the gold
body and failed to puncture it.</p>
<p>Edward’s golden form shone like a sun, showering the entire
lotus mountain in golden light. Han Sen suddenly felt incredibly
heavy, as if he was now shouldering the weight of a mountain. He
couldn’t move much at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that he was struggling under the power of that
special gold godlight.</p>
<p>After Dukes became Kings, their elemental prowess increased
dramatically. They could use their powers to blanket the land
around them, laying claim to a large area. Edward’s power was a
heavy burden of suppression. It was a little similar to Ice Blue
Knight King’s deep blue power.</p>
<p>Edward didn’t hesitate. He reached out to grab the
currently-suppressed Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to fight it off, but the King class suppression of
the area was far too strong to compete with. Plus, Edward was
half-deified. Although Han Sen’s elemental prowess was very good
for his level, it didn’t have enough raw strength to counter this
attack. He couldn’t beat the suppressing force that was coming down
on him.</p>
<p>Edward’s hand had almost reached Han Sen’s neck when suddenly,
Han Sen’s hand lifted a small bird’s nest. In his other hand, he
raised a big army spear and thrust it toward Edward’s chest.</p>
<p>Edward was shocked. He hadn’t expected Han Sen to brush off his
King class area-of-effect technique. They were too close together
for Edward to block Han Sen’s, but Edward didn’t hesitate. He
ignored Han Sen’s strike and continued reaching out to grab his
prey by the throat.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just a Duke. Even if his weapon was deified, it
wouldn’t do too much damage to Edward’s half-deified body. If he
was able to catch Han Sen at the same time, Edward had no qualm
with accepting the strike.</p>
<p>At the moment Edward’s fingers closed around Han Sen’s neck, the
Thunder God Spike was plunged into Edward’s armor.</p>
<p>The armor stopped the Thunder God Spike dead, with only an inch
of the weapon’s tip embedding itself in Edward’s breastplate.</p>
<p>But the Thunder God Spike’s silver lightning completely ignored
the defense offered by that armor. When it discharged, it sent a
current of electricity directly into Edward’s body. Edward shook as
the power ran through him, and his electrified body was sent flying
away.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen struck the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum again. Edward was
still being ravaged by the silver lightning, and he couldn’t gather
his wits fast enough to summon power and repel the sonic attack.
That sonic force was driven right into his forehead.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Even for a half-deified elite, hearing the Blood
Scorpion Jade Drum felt like being stabbed in the head. Edward
couldn’t help but let out a shrill cry.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the bird’s nest on his head as he continued to pound
the drum. He had no intention of remaining idle, though. He
teleported directly in front of Edward and used his Thunder God
Spike to strike at Edward once more.</p>
<p>Half-deified warriors deserved their reputation, and despite the
dizziness and fierce pain, Edward tried to gather up power to block
Han Sen’s next attack.</p>
<p>The Thunder God Spike’s power wasn’t very destructive, but the
lightning energy it released could bypass any form of defense. The
lightning surged into every single cell of Edward’s body. Edward
shook under the force.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t have enough strength to use more than a tiny
fraction of the Thunder God Spike’s true power. Edward had only
been numbed a little. If the Thunder God Spike was used by someone
half-deified, a single hit would have left Edward shaking non-stop
for an entire day.</p>
<p>The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s sonic power swept into Edward in
a continuous stream, but Edward was holding strong against the
numbness induced by the lightning. He raised his shield again, and
the sonic attacks began bouncing off of him.</p>
<p>“I’m too weak! If I was stronger, the silver lightning would
have kept Edward from gathering enough power to resist,” Han Sen
thought to himself. He kept moving, though. Instead of thrusting
with his Thunder God Spike, he resorted to beating Edward with it
like some rod.</p>
<p>All that electricity had Edward shaking on the ground like he
was experiencing a seizure. He was like a normal person being
struck by a stun rod.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King and the others, who were still in the midst
of combat with the blood kirin, were frozen. The half-deified
Edward was curled on the ground as Han Sen beat the pulp out of
him. It was difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>They knew the extent of Edward’s strength, and a Duke should
have had no hope of repelling the golden godlight.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t seem hindered at all as he pounded Edward.
Edward’s defenses couldn’t withstand the lightning power emitted by
the rod, and the man screamed continually and frothed at the mouth.
It was too frightening to watch.</p>
<p>“What, you won’t treat me with respect unless I unleash my
power?” Han Sen kept hitting Edward, wondering how he might kill
the man.</p>
<p>The lightning could bypass an opponent’s defenses, but it
couldn’t actually kill anyone. And Han Sen couldn’t do the job
himself. He was too weak to break the man’s armor, so he couldn’t
kill Edward with his strength alone.</p>
<p>“The blood kirin!” Han Sen thought. Then, he beckoned for the
monster.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was still chasing the others, but Ice Blue
Knight King and his group didn’t dare to engage the beast. They
were keeping it busy by baiting it back and forth.</p>
<p>The blood kirin’s intelligence was low. They lured it left and
right, to and fro, and it hadn’t managed to kill any of them.</p>
<p>At the sound of Han Sen’s voice, though, the beast turned to
look at him. When it saw Han Sen slamming his fists into Edward, a
light came into its eyes. It ran over, chomped down on Edward’s
head, and katcha! The armor was destroyed. Edward’s head was bitten
off.</p>
<p>Severed arteries in the man’s neck sprayed blood all over the
blood kirin. It swallowed the head in a single gulp. The sight made
Ice Blue Knight King and the others shiver in fear and anger.</p>
