<h2>Knife Descends on the Buddha Kingdom</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2884</h3>

<p>Afterward, things got even better. The geno god list randomly
opened. He was able to rely on that knife and reach the top 100. He
ended up in the 80th position. He received a true god weapon and
the material of a true god.</p>
<p>After all that happened, he felt incredibly lucky. Burning Lamp
himself found it difficult to believe.</p>
<p>“My luck is not bad. I got a random true god weapon like this.
With this god doll, that means the Buddha have another true god
elite. When the oil of my lamp runs dry, I will not have to worry
too much about leaving the Buddha without anyone to continue the
legacy.”</p>
<p>Burning Lamp was looking at a black doll, which was as tall as
him. He looked excited.</p>
<p>The black doll had many weird and mysterious markings. It was
just standing there. It gave people the feeling that it possessed
powerful magic.</p>
<p>That god doll was the true god weapon Burning Lamp had received.
He just needed to activate the god doll for it to follow his
commands in combat. The power of it was like the power of a true
god elite.</p>
<p>But Burning Lamp was only butterfly class. He did not have
enough power, so he could not keep using the god doll to fight.</p>
<p>The power of a true god, even if it was used for only a short
amount of time, was still able to deal damage that could not be
imagined.</p>
<p>That satisfied Burning Lamp. As long as there was a deified
around, they could make use of the god doll. The duration it could
be used for was all based on how much power could be put in.</p>
<p>Although the time limit was short, even if Burning Lamp died,
someone in the Buddha could still make use of the god doll. The
Buddha could still maintain their power.</p>
<p>“With this god doll and the cause karma knife, unless a
top-class elite wants to fight the Buddha, we’ll be fine. We still
have the backing of the Extreme King. There won’t be many changes.
If we successfully refine this material…” Burning Lamp was looking
at a 3-foot long red bone. He looked excited.</p>
<p>That bone was the true god material he had earned. The bone was
called the Break Soul Bone. It was the arm bone of a true god
xenogeneic called Break Soul Beast.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp thought, “It is a shame to refine the causal karma
knife. The Buddha have used almost all the savings of this
generation. We will not be able to afford another true god weapon.
We will have to put his bone into the Buddha light pool. If we let
it get rinsed by the Buddha light, it will become pure in around
1,000 to 10,000 years. Perhaps then the Buddha might become very
famous, and we might have the resources to create another true god
weapon.” He was going to put the Break Soul Bone into the Buddha
light pool, but his expression suddenly changed.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s light pool was shaking. It was not just the
Buddha’s light pool, but the whole Buddha Kingdom was shaking. It
was like an earthquake was happening.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Buddha Kingdom felt the earthquake. The sky and
ground suddenly changed color. The Buddha light that covered the
Buddha Kingdom was like a candle in the wind.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Everyone in the Buddha Kingdom looked to the
sky in confusion. They shockingly realized that a man was floating
above Buddha Kingdom. That man was just standing in space. One of
his hands was touching the Buddha light that protected the Buddha
Kingdom. For centuries, the Buddha light had not been moved. Now,
the man was touching it and swinging it. It was like a bubble that
popped.</p>
<p>Many Buddha elites flew into space and madly shouted at the man.
“How dare you! How dare you destroy the Buddha Kingdom’s Buddha
light! Do you have any idea where you are?”</p>
<p>They knew that the man was powerful and a deified elite. He was
not someone they could fight. They did not dare to fight him, but
they were not going to cower and act weak. They were not going to
be scared because their opponent was deified. They even looked
proud.</p>
<p>The Buddha Kingdom’s elites were doing this because Burning Lamp
was 80 on the geno god list. Their alpha was an elite in the geno
god list, which gave them confidence. Their confidence and pride
had been greatly increased.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it was funny. If they were saying this was
Buddha Kingdom and asking him if he knew where he was, the Buddha
King was very interesting.</p>
<p>“Oh, I really didn’t know where I was. Where is this place?
Please educate me.” Han Sen looked like he was smiling at the
Buddha King, but he wasn’t smiling.</p>
<p>“Hmph! This is the Buddha Kingdom. It is where the geno god
list’s elite Burning Lamp Alpha rules.” The Buddha elite lifted his
eyebrows.</p>
<p>“That means I have come to the right place,” Han Sen coldly
said.</p>
<p>The Buddha King wished to say something, but the other Buddha
Kings had just arrived. When he saw Han Sen, Pure Sea King was
shocked. He screamed and shouted, “Han Sen!”</p>
<p>“He is Han Sen. He is God’s Daddy Han Sen!” The other Buddha
Kings were in shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not joined the geno god list fight this time, but
his reputation was no weaker than those that did. It was perhaps
even greater.</p>
<p>Space Garden had many deified elites join. Although they did not
get good results, many deifieds thought it was Han Sen who had
created them. Thus, Han Sen’s reputation was even brighter.</p>
<p>“Pure Sea King, you still remember me,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>
<p>“What are you doing with the Buddha?” Pure Sea King forced a
smile.</p>
<p>Back when Burning Lamp stole Han Sen’s knife blank and turned
him into an ant, Pure Sea King had been nearby. He knew Han Sen
really hated the Buddha, so he knew this was not a polite
visit.</p>
<p>Yet, Pure Sea King was not scared. Han Sen was famous, but his
power was not that great. Burning Lamp Alpha had just been number
80 on the geno god list, and he had beaten Pluto Peacock, which was
true god class. That made Pure Sea King very proud.</p>
<p>Plus, the Buddha belonged to the Extreme King. If Han Sen wanted
trouble from the Buddha, he had to worry about the Extreme
King.</p>
<p>“I am here to make you pay,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“We Buddha do not owe anything to anyone,” Pure Sea King said
with a dim look.</p>
<p>Han Sen coldly laughed. “Ha! Ha! You don’t owe anything? If you
say that, then I will say something else. I do not want you to owe
me anything. By that I mean I will make your race extinct.”</p>
<p>“How dare you! Is the Buddha a place where you can talk like a
crazy man?” Many Buddha elites were so angry and started
shouting.</p>
<p>Han Sen menacingly laughed. His fingers had strength. The
protecting Buddha light, which had protected the Buddha Kingdom for
a thousand years, broke like a bubble in his hands. The entire
Buddha Kingdom was left exposed in space.</p>
<p>All the Buddha looked shocked. They fell back. Without the
Buddha’s light for protection, their security was reduced by 50%.
They would not dare fight Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Amitabha!” The Buddha’s catchphrase was up. Burning Lamp was
wearing Buddha clothing. He was on his way, and he was quick to
arrive before Han Sen did anything else.</p>
