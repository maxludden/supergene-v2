      The skin was easy to heal, but bones and veins were not. Fortunately, the
      red Ganoderma was able to provide effective healing for all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen stayed in the shell for four days, until he was fully healed.
      Without those red mushrooms, it would have taken at least ten times that
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is good. It’s a shame there was only seven and I’ve eaten one. That
      means there are only six left,” Han Sen thought, with a greedy desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      His body felt better, but that was all that had changed. The crocodile and
      the monsters outside were still there. He went out of the shell to take a
      look at things and used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the crowds. Much to his
      dismay, he was able to detect super creatures in their midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If not even super creatures dare come in here to eat the meat, how strong
      must the crocodile be?” Han Sen was shocked, to say the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, the crocodile was still focused on the meat inside the shell. It
      had yet to pay any attention to Han Sen and Bao’er.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wouldn’t dare touch the crocodile, especially now that he had
      detected two super creatures down below. With all the sacred and mutant
      class creatures buffering the crowds, Han Sen thought it was too reckless
      for him to try to escape that way. As such, he decided to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do we do?” Han Sen did not want to stay, and he doubted that the
      crocodile would continue to ignore them after it had finished off the
      shell king’s meat. If the crocodile did show an interest in the two,
      things would turn sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he left now, he wouldn’t have to fight the spooky crocodile, but there
      was no guarantee he could escape the horde safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen watched the creatures from inside the shell, hoping there’d be a
      shift or an opportunity that might score him a chance to escape. But more
      and more creatures were coming over time, and with every second that
      passed, the chances of leaving were got slimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen noticed a problem, then. For the first few days, the creatures did
      not dare get too close to the shell. But now their patience was growing
      thin, and they were inching their way closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures that were able to fly had been bold enough to circle the
      hole. When that occurred, the crocodile roared at them, which prompted
      them to disperse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like it’s only a matter of time before they decide to breach
      this place and enter. When that happens, the crocodile will have no choice
      but to fight them. Perhaps I can escape in the midst of all that chaos,”
      Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen wasn’t going anywhere right now, he could only spend his time
      practicing the Dongxuan Sutra and Jadeskin so he could regenerate the
      Bulwark Umbrella and the Crystal Core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting them back was easier than generating them the first time had been.
      All it took, more than anything, was time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen tried to absorb the two Life Geno Essences he had retrieved, but
      for some reason, he was unable to. Han Sen tried to simulate the
      creatures’ energy flows, but it was to no avail. He guessed he might have
      been too weak to do that, in his current form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen tried researching and experimenting for a while, but he was unable
      to pinpoint why he couldn’t absorb the Life Geno Essences. He did notice
      that the energy inside them was strange, and somewhat different than what
      he had seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like the two Life Geno Essences were not just power; there was a
      life inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The shell king and the red cricket are dead. How can their Life Geno
      Essences harbor a lifeforce? It’s almost as if these things are unborn
      eggs. Does this mean they can come back to life?” Han Sen thought, but he
      was unsure whether or not that was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, the impatience of the creatures outside rose. Many of the
      flying creatures were spending time on top of the shell, while the ground
      ones were right against its bottom. They all looked hungry and greedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of them cared about the crocodile’s roaring anymore, so it had
      actually stopped trying to scare them off. As long as the creatures did
      not enter, the crocodile would ignore them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like they’re going to come in soon. I wonder what they are
      waiting for?” Han Sen thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later, Han Sen heard a noise. The creatures had formed a path,
      and traversing that was a horned creature with a turtle-like body and a
      snake-like head. It climbed into the shell without any hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the snake-turtle came inside, so too did the rest of the creatures.
      Quickly, things got out of hand. Every creature was like a hungry wolf,
      desperately leaping at every morsel of flesh they could grab.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They must have been waiting for the snake-turtle. I guess now my time has
      come.” Han Sen was so happy. The messier the fray, the better it would be
      for him and his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the creatures that came pouring in made the crocodile furious. It
      roared and summoned its geno core, which was like a giant pair of
      scissors. They were blue and the blades were cruelly serrated. They
      immediately swung open to cut a few of the creatures in half.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scissors flashed into the group of creatures, destroying everything
      that came into contact with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two creatures Han Sen believed to be super creatures avoided the
      scissors, not willing to fight the geno core face-to-face. They didn’t
      even summon geno cores of their own to make battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is no wonder they were all afraid of coming. The crocodile’s geno core
      is too strong, and it cuts everything in half. It’s scarier than the Red
      Crystal Cricket’s ruby slicer.” Han Sen was in quite a shock. He looked at
      the snake-turtle. “The creatures all waited for the snake-turtle to come.
      It must have been in the belief it could effectively make battle with the
      crocodile.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the snake-turtle. It didn’t care about the other
      creatures. The snake’s upper-body merely grabbed a hunk of meat and began
      ravaging it down. It paid no attention to the nearby slaughter and the
      crocodile’s scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn’t see the scissors, but when it ate the meat, it incited the anger
      of the crocodile. The crocodile roared, and the scissors flew forward to
      cut the snake-turtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snake-turtle was not afraid, though. It continued munching on the
      meat, as its body began to flash. A copper bell appeared to shield its own
      body and prevent the scissors from reaching it.
    </p>
    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      There was a metal noise. The scissors banged against the bell, unable to
      cut it in half. Under the protection of the copper bell, the snake-turtle
      could eat the meat unopposed. And while the crocodile’s attention had been
      drawn to the snake-turtle, the lesser creatures in the vicinity used that
      opportunity to chow down on the meat.
