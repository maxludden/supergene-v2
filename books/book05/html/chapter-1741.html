<p>“Dollar.” Ling Mei’er was delighted to see Han Sen. She already
knew Han Sen was his true identity, but that mattered little at
this point</p>
<p>“Mei’er, Elder; why are you here?” Han Sen asked in
confusion.</p>
<p>Dark Spirit Elder heard Ling Mei’er and remembered Han Sen. With
a strange expression, he said, “It is hard to tell.”</p>
<p>Ling Mei’er explained with anger, and when Han Sen heard what
had happened, he turned to the Elder. He told him, “Elder and
Mei’er, you should head on over to Mask Shelter first. When I get
rid of them, you’ll easily be able to go back and reclaim Dark
Spirit Shelter.”</p>
<p>“We can go and deal with the bad guys alongside you.” Ling
Mei’er waved her fist.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You guys should go on ahead to Mask Shelter and
wait,” Han Sen said. He couldn’t really take the gourd if Ling
Mei’er was there.</p>
<p>After convincing them to leave, he brought Bao’er to Dark Spirit
Shelter with them. It was good news, learning the gourd was still
there.</p>
<p>“Elder, can we believe that man?” one of the Dark Spirits asked
Dark Spirit Elder.</p>
<p>“He is unpredictable. Whatever the case may be, meeting him is
not something you can sit back and ignore,” Dark Spirit Elder said
with seriousness as he looked at them.</p>
<p>But he abided by Han Sen’s request, and he commanded his people
to seek refuge in Mask Shelter. He himself, however, went on to
Dark Spirit Shelter alone.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking about how he might get the gourd. He did
not want to hurt Ling Mei’er through its theft, so this event had
saved him some trouble.</p>
<p>Regardless, the elite elders occupying the shelter were
practically nothing to Han Sen now.</p>
<p>Bao’er was looking at the shelter with much excitement. A huge
lifeforce was radiating from it, making the underworld creatures
stronger. Han Sen could not see the gourd, but he knew this was not
something common in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>The elders and others were all staring at the gourd. While they
might have taken the shelter, they still couldn’t take the
gourd.</p>
<p>The gourd was like a golden crystal, only a little bit bigger
than a man’s hand. But it was an incredibly sturdy thing. Not even
an elder-class elite could damage its vines.</p>
<p>“Feather, you know a lot. Do you know what this is?” Beast Elder
asked Feather Elder.</p>
<p>Feather Elder said, “I don’t know, but it is definitely not
something from the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, It must have come from
someplace high above.”</p>
<p>“Dark Spirit had this thing for years. Now it is ours, but we
cannot take it? I don’t feel safe. Is there really no way to bring
it down?” Beast Elder said.</p>
<p>As they discussed the matter, someone else suddenly
appeared.</p>
<p>The man was wearing armor, so you could not see his face. There
was a little girl perched upon his shoulder, and they stood in
front of the gourd, looking at it.</p>
<p>The elders were so angry over the intrusion, they were ready to
quickly destroy the pair.</p>
<p>But before they moved, coins fell down from the sky like
rainfall. All the creatures around were hit by at least one of
them; especially Beast and Feather. They were unable to dodge the
coins, which planted themselves firmly upon the elders’ heads.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>All at the same time, the creatures fell to the ground. Even the
elders did. They were all lying on the floor, unable to get up, no
matter how much they tried.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t spare time looking at them, however. He remained
occupied with gazing upon the gourd.</p>
<p>Dark Spirit Elder was in shock as he watched them from a
distance. He knew Han Sen was strong, but he could never have
guessed he was that strong.</p>
<p>Beast Elder and Feather Elder were mighty foes. Out of all the
other elders there, there were none stronger than those two. But
Han Sen did not even have to look or move to suppress them all. It
was an incredible display.</p>
<p>“Are you Mister Dollar?” Beast Elder shouted, with actual
fear.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know you were here. Please forgive us!” The other
elders heard him, and reacted the same.</p>
<p>“From now on, you cannot enter the Underworld. If you do, your
tribes will be destroyed.” Han Sen spoke to them, but did not even
spare them a glance.</p>
<p>Beast Elder suddenly felt the pressure vanish. And then, he and
the rest all got up. They made a promise to never come back, ever
again. Taking their men with them, they all left.</p>
<p>For humans, creatures were a resource that could not respawn.
So, Han Sen didn’t want to kill them for no reason. He thought it
was best to allow other people to do it and earn something.</p>
<p>When everyone was gone, Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to
enshroud the entire shelter. Then, he let go of Bao’er, who was
wriggling with the desire to run to the gourd.</p>
<p>Bao’er was exuberantly happy, and she leaped for the vine. She
hugged the golden gourd.</p>
<p>When Bao’er touched the gourd, it fell from its place and landed
on her chest.</p>
<p>“This item really is related to Bao’er.” Han Sen was in shock.
He heard Ling Mei’er and the Elder saying they could not remove the
gourd, no matter what they tried.</p>
<p>Now, Bao’er had brought it down with just a touch. It definitely
had a connection to her.</p>
<p>“It cannot be Bao’er’s sibling, surely. It’d be crazy to have a
second Bao’er running around,” Han Sen thought to himself, while
staring at the gourd.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the golden gourd Bao’er was hugging began to shine. It
did so with the luminosity of a firework.</p>
<p>Mist came out of it, like the cascade of a fountain. The
lifeforce that appeared was like a dragon, descending out from the
fog. Music could also be heard.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the gourd with shock. The power from the gourd
was something that really impressed him.</p>
<p>Amidst all these strange scenes, however, something began to
rise. When Han Sen looked, he became even more shocked.</p>
<p>A drop of blood emerged from the gourd. It looked like a tear.
It looked like it had been forged from a golden crystal, and there
was a weird light inside it.</p>
<p>When the gold blood rose, the strange scenes began to fade. The
gourd in Bao’er’s hand became pale. It became little more than
dust. Then, the wind scattered it all away.</p>
<p>The golden blood was like life. It landed on Bao’er’s forehead
and sank down into her. It left a gold dot in the middle of her
forehead.</p>
