      “It’s no wonder. That thing is the chairman’s geno armor. She might not be
      able to wield its full strength, but it’s already so frightening. It
      really is the only sort of power a god could have.” Shafei looked at the
      sword strikes and complimented what she saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was still alive and had not been killed yet, but Shafei could see
      that he was underneath the incoming sword strike. Shafei felt incredibly
      happy, and she thought to herself, “I can’t believe Han Sen was that
      difficult to kill. It is lucky she brought the chairman’s geno armor with
      her. If she hadn’t, the mission would have been a failure and I would have
      been punished.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Tina slash through the emptiness, Shafei was shocked. Then, she
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planet Fantis had been wholly destroyed, but the hotel itself was fine. It
      wasn’t really damaged, and Shafei understood what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s sister and the others had only just entered the hotel, but Han
      Sen had saved it from annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Scary human. Even as the lady is attacking, he can still formulate plans.
      He led her attacks to avoid the hotel. If the human doesn’t die here, he
      will surely be a great threat to the New Community. It’s lucky she was
      smart enough to notice his plan. If he is unable to block her attack, Han
      Yan will be killed in the hotel. What will he decide?” Shafei thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw Tina slash through the hotel. His face changed, but he did not
      stop. He stood before that sword strike to try his best to block it and
      stop its descent upon the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina, seeing Han Sen directly in front of her, was delighted. She exerted
      more force to drive her strike harder. She hadn’t planned to kill anyone
      else, and she just went for the hotel to get Han Sen to stop dodging her
      attacks and confront her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No!” Han Yan saw Han Sen stand directly in front of Tina’s sword and
      screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hong Lianshun and the others did not say a word. The incoming strike was
      too strong, and even Han Sen wouldn’t be able to withstand it. Han Sen was
      clearly using his own body as a shield for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Han Sen was only doing it for Han Yan, but they all felt the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Tina’s shining greatsword coming down towards Han Sen’s body, even
      Fang Yuanyuan hoped a miracle might intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst that scary light, Han Sen’s body that was flashing red began to
      melt into it. Then, they couldn’t see anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      That power destroyed the entire construct of the hotel and all the nearby
      machines. The video feed for the safe zone was cut-off, and the image
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was shocked. When they noticed what had just happened, their
      faces turned grave. They hoped Han Sen was able to deflect that last
      attack; otherwise, they’d be next.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their hearts almost leaped out of their chests, they heard a big boom.
      After it, the entire safe zone began to shake.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      Outside the hotel, before Tina’s strike impacted Han Sen, a dark purple
      armshield appeared upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shield swiftly became three meters tall, sheltering Han Sen. Tina’s
      attack came down against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hit landed, the word overbearing appeared upon the shield. Han
      Sen was sent flying backwards into the hotel, breaking down a number of
      walls as he went. When he landed, he skidded across the ground for a few
      hundred meters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen was still on his feet. His mouth was bleeding, but he still
      held the shield. The armshield had a number of cracks across it, but the
      word overbearing was now shining like a sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, Tina screamed. The power she had unleashed was turned
      back on her by the shield. Tina felt a wretched strength come down upon
      her, and the armor that previously encased her began to fall. Her lips
      were bleeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina didn’t own that armor set, and what’s more, she couldn’t control it
      fully. Now that the power she had unleashed was turned back onto it, it
      disconnected the armor, and various pieces of the armor began to fall away
      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, Tina, and Shafei were all shocked. They did not expect Tina to
      end up being shaken out of the armor she wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could feel that the armor was too strong. The power he had
      ricocheted back was awful, but it wasn’t enough to actually destroy the
      armor itself.
    </p>
    <p>Now Tina had been bounced out of the armor, it was quite surprising.</p>
    <p>
      “Is Tina the same as me? Can she not control the armor properly, either?
      So, when the power bounced back on the armor, she was disconnected from
      it?” Han Sen was thinking, heading over towards the crystal armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Tina was unable to control the armor, Han Sen only needed to go and
      steal it. Even if he was unable to use it, asset denial was always a good
      idea. If she didn’t have the armor, Han Sen would surely be able to beat
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina’s face changed. Then, she headed directly for the crystal armor at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Han Sen thought, Tina was unable to properly control the armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The geno armor belonged to the chairman. He had taught Tina a method in
      which she could make use of the armor’s power—a method that only worked
      for her. It didn’t have any negative side effects, either. But that was
      because Tina had the chairman’s genes, which allowed her to temporarily
      use the power of the armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Tina could do this, and not even Shafei could prompt a reaction from
      the armor if she tried to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman taught this method to Tina in front of everyone. But despite
      everyone hearing what she was taught, only Tina was able to make use of
      the geno armor. Shafei and the others believed the armor contained the
      power of a god. Only gods like the chairman and Tina could make use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Tina rushed towards the armor with a similar speed.
      Unfortunately, Tina was closer to the armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used Taia, and he began swinging it at Tina. In a flash, she
      deflected it with a swing of her own sword. With the room that strike had
      bought him, Han Sen rushed to the armor to claim it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen grabbed it, but he immediately noticed how heavy it was. He was
      unable to lift the armor up, and he found himself falling down with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina, who had just been slowed down by Han Sen, laughed when she saw him.
      “This is God’s Armor, and mortals like you are incapable of staining it
      with your filth.”
