<h2>Little Red Bird Shows Off</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2361</h3>

<p>The faces of Han Sen and the blood kirin were squashed together.
Han Sen hesitated, trying to decide if he should take the blood
kirin with him to the sanctuaries. Even if the powers of the
sanctuary harmed the creature, it was better than being squeezed
into a sausage then and there.</p>
<p>The rainbow sea conch didn’t move. It kept pushing the glass
down on Han Sen and the blood kirin in a cruel bid to crush them.
The black sea conch was standing just outside the glass, and it
seemed darkly amused. It moved around a little, and small black
things emerged from its shell. They were the black sea conches.</p>
<p>Those small sea conches surrounded the glass like a tide of
water. There was a countless number of them, and they looked like a
cloud of ink.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a chill as he looked at them. If the glass squashed
him to a pulp, he wouldn’t feel safe dying. His dead body would be
devoured by the hungry sea conches.</p>
<p>As Han Sen gritted his teeth and prepared to use his Blood-Pulse
Sutra to return to the sanctuaries, a beautiful red light appeared
above him, shining down into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen saw a burning flame swoop across the sea. It
was like a fiery phoenix coming down from the heavens. The
strange-looking red light was its flames.</p>
<p>The black sea conch and the rainbow crystal sea conch noticed
the phoenix. The black sea conch was frightening, and it
immediately retreated back into its shell. Its blue light appeared
a moment later.</p>
<p>The rainbow sea conch gathered its rainbow-colored substance
chains into powerful waves of rainbow glass that went right for the
phoenix.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The glass covered the phoenix.</p>
<p>The black sea conch poked its head out when it saw the fire
phoenix get trapped. It was so happy that it jumped a little.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The next second, the phoenix shrieked, and the red flames of its
body rose. The incredibly hard glass turned to lava beneath the
strength of the bird’s flames. The melted glass began to run like
candle wax.</p>
<p>The phoenix flapped its wings, and the glass shattered
completely. Even the shards soon melted into a red liquid.</p>
<p>The underwater landscape was smoldering, and the light danced
strangely over the seafloor. It was shockingly pretty.</p>
<p>The rainbow sea conch saw all this, and even more rainbow
substance chains lashed out crazily. They became another weird
shape of glass that headed for the phoenix.</p>
<p>The phoenix flapped its wings and spat out some gold fire. The
fire pierced through the rainbow sea conch’s glass and kept on
going towards the beast.</p>
<p>The rainbow sea conch’s eyes opened wide. It gathered up power
upon its shell, and then its body retreated inside.</p>
<p>The gold fire splashed atop the crystal conch shell. Instead of
breaking the shell, though, the fire burned around the shell and
made it shine like a rainbow.</p>
<p>The phoenix looked at Han Sen and the blood kirin. It spat a
fireball toward them and melted the glass that had trapped
them.</p>
<p>“Little red bird!” Han Sen and the blood kirin escaped. Han Sen,
upon seeing the red phoenix, was ridiculously happy. He exclaimed,
“The Sun Raven’s body and the bird’s nest weren’t wasted. The
little red bird is good!”</p>
<p>The little red bird flapped its wings and sent even more fire
toward the rainbow sea conch. The scary gold fire wrapped around
the sea conch like an embrace of flames.</p>
<p>When the fire rose, the rainbow shell became a golden color. The
shine dimmed.</p>
<p>Han Sen glanced over and saw the black sea conch trying to
escape. So, Han Sen summoned Spell as a sniper rifle and fired a
bullet at the conch’s shell.</p>
<p>The black sea conch hadn’t wanted to draw the phoenix’s
attention, so it hadn’t made use of its King area. It was slow, and
Spell’s bullet hit the shell and broke it. The beast started to
bleed.</p>
<p>The black sea conch squealed. Its situation had become even more
desperate, so it unleashed its blue light and began moving away as
quickly as it could.</p>
<p>“You want to run away?” Han Sen pursued the creature, continuing
to shoot at it.</p>
<p>The next bullet went through the blue light area and struck the
black sea conch. It flew through the hole made by the previous
bullet, and this time, blood flowed out like a spring.</p>
<p>The black sea conch’s recovery powers were strong, but that
bullet hole wasn’t recovering in the least. The bullet hole existed
on the beast as if it was a separate entity. It wasn’t healing.</p>
<p>That was the work of Spell’s Eternity skill. It made a solid
wound that was impossible to heal again. That skill was more than a
match for the black sea conch, too. Even a deified creature might
not be able to break the power of that Eternity skill.</p>
<p>Han Sen got closer to the black sea conch, and he turned Spell
into dual pistols. He fired them repeatedly, and every bullet
struck that same bullet hole. Ever-increasing amounts of blood
poured from the black sea conch.</p>
<p>The blue light area combined with the sea conch’s shell and
created an excellent defense system, but the flesh of the sea conch
didn’t have a high level of defense. Plus, it wasn’t nearly fast
enough to evade the bullets. Before long, it had been shot many
times in that same spot.</p>
<p>The black sea conch’s body began to tremble. Its flesh shook,
and black clouds poured out of its flesh. The black clouds were
swarms of little black sea conches.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body shone with Kingese. The little sea conches tried
to drill into Han Sen’s pores, but they all broke against the
Kingese.</p>
<p>The black stone sea conch couldn’t run, and the little sea
conches were unable to do anything to Han Sen. The big beast had
been shot, and it was rapidly losing blood. The Purple Teeth power
kept spreading into it as well, making the wound even worse.</p>
<p>The black sea conch’s climbing ability slowed. The blue light
had weakened. When the blue light was fully extinguished, Han Sen
fired his pistols to completely shatter the creature’s shell.</p>
<p>Without the protection of the blue light, the conch’s shell
crumbled under the onslaught.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Xenogeneic King hunted: Move Mountain Sea Conch. Xenogeneic
gene found. Obtained beast soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen happily went to check out what type of beast soul he had
received.</p>
<div class="tables">
<table class="beast">
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King Class Move Mountain Sea Conch</td>
<td>(Area)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<!-- King class xenogeneic beast soul Move Mountain Sea Conch: Area type. --></div>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He hadn’t expected to receive another
powerful area type beast soul. He didn’t know if King class area
beast souls were extremely common or if he was simply lucky.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his new beast soul to find out what it was
like.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body shimmered with blue light, the same light that he
had just seen the Move Mountain Sea Conch use. This delighted Han
Sen.</p>
<p>He wanted to investigate the blue light further, but the rainbow
sea conch was starting to emit some strange wheezing noises. Han
Sen looked over and saw the rainbow sea conch still being slowly
cooked by the little red bird. The creature appeared to be in a
frenzy as it tried to run away.</p>
