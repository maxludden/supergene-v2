  Although Han Sen was still mostly outmatched by the Red Blood Demon, he discovered that his powerful predictive abilities, when used in concert with God’s Wander, were allowing him to begin protecting himself from the creature’s attacks.

“Has the Xuan Yellow Sutra started working? But this effect is much weaker than I thought it would be. It has only made the Red Blood Demon a little bit slower…” Even though his thoughts were negative, Han Sen was quite happy with this result.

Although his enemy was only a little weaker, it was enough for him to keep going. He wouldn’t be killed by the Red Blood Demon, and that meant he could wait for the Very High to rescue him.

But as time went by, he noticed that the Red Blood Demon’s power was continuing to decrease. Its red substance chains became thinner and thinner, and many of them were starting to fray and break.

“What is going on?” Han Sen thought in confused excitement.

If this was the power of the Xuan Yellow Sutra, then it really was scary. It was even weakening the Red Blood Demon’s substance chains, which were the essence of a deified’s power.

The shine of the Red Blood Demon’s armor started to dim, and its body seemed to be changing. The creature started to expand. It was like watching a bodybuilder slowly being transformed into a fat man. The body became bigger, but the strength and speed of the being decreased.

Han Sen’s fight was becoming easier and easier. He wasn’t quite able to beat the Red Blood Demon yet, but he was certainly able to protect himself. He didn’t need to teleport away anymore, at the very least.

While Han Sen reveled in his sudden good fortune, he saw the Red Blood Demon’s blood-red substance chains explode like fireworks. Lifeforce was leaving Han Sen’s enemy like the air from a leaking balloon.

“This… this… cannot be a deified dropping to become half-deified, can it?” Han Sen couldn’t believe his eyes. But judging from what he could see, that seemed to be what was happening. There was no other explanation that made sense. The Red Blood Demon’s entire presence was more like a King class now, and its power was insufficient to generate substance chains. It didn’t look deified at all.

Pang!

Han Sen was still holding the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze, and with it, he blocked the next strike from the Red Blood Demon. Their powers were tied, and Han Sen wasn’t tossed away like he had been before.

“Oh, crap! The Xuan Yellow Sutra is ferocious. It really did bring the Red Blood Demon down from deified to King class. That is so scary…” Han Sen was crazily happy.

Although Mister White had predicted that the geno art would be very strong, Han Sen hadn’t expected the effect of the Xuan Yellow Sutra to be that powerful. It had reversed the blood pulse of a deified creature, sending it back to King class.

The Red Blood Demon’s face was covered in disbelief. It was flabbergasted about what was happening to it.

“Now that we are both Kings, the fun can commence.” Han Sen’s eyes started to shine. He had been suppressed by the Red Blood Demon for so long, and he had almost been killed. Now it was time to unleash all the pent-up anger he had built up throughout the mistreatment.

“Die!” Han Sen thundered. He pounced like a tiger toward the Red Blood Demon.

The Red Blood Demon’s battle experience and will were still there, but its power had been reduced to that of a half-deified. Han Sen used his Apollo Set and his beast souls, and he carried deified power into battle with him.

Now, the advantage had switched. Although the Red Blood Demon’s mind and skills were strong, Han Sen’s absolute power was still enough to turn the tables in his favor.

And Han Sen’s battle experience and will weren’t weak, either. And after all the time he had spent fighting the Red Blood Demon, his experience had grown. His knowledge about the way the Red Blood Demon behaved probably exceeded what the Very High knew.

Before, Han Sen lacked the power to fight the Red Blood Demon. But now, things had taken a turn. Han Sen’s power had an absolute advantage, and he pressed that advantage hard, utterly suppressing the creature. His Six Core Snake Bow kept firing arrows. All of the arrows punched through the Red Blood Demon’s body, making it weaker and weaker.

Han Sen didn’t know how long the Xuan Yellow Sutra’s power would last, but he wasn’t going to wait around to find out. He focused all of his power on killing the Red Blood quickly.

Their initial fights had only lasted a few minutes, and this one wouldn’t last much longer. Within three minutes, the Red Blood Demon had been punctured a dozen times, and even more marks were left across its shell. It was bleeding everywhere.

The Xuan Yellow Sutra didn’t just weaken enemies. It made their blood pulse reverse. Their bodies would devolve. The Red Blood Demon was a far cry from the primitive deified that it had once been.

Katcha!

Han Sen’s bowstring started cutting. When he was halfway through slicing the Red Blood Demons’ head off, the creature was reduced to squeals as it thrashed on the ground.

As he continued with his work, Han Sen saw the Red Blood Demon’s red light flash. It was starting to coalesce substance chains again.

“Oh, no! The Xuan Yellow Sutra’s power is waning.” Han Sen was shocked. He didn’t dare delay these proceedings. He generated power and went right up to the Red Blood Demon. He wanted to kill it completely before it had the opportunity to recover.

Fortunately, Han Sen had already injured the Red Blood Demon badly. Now, the creature was gasping its final few breaths.

…

Exquisite and Li Keer tried their hardest to get to Jail Demon Hall. When they got there, people from the Inspection Department were already there. They were trying to shut down the restrictions that kept Jail Demon Hall locked.

“What’s going on in there? Is Han Sen still inside?” Exquisite asked in a rush.

“I don’t know. When the restrictions of Jail Demon Hall activated, they cut off all connection to the outside. We have to wait until we have deactivated the added security before we can see what is going on inside,” a member of the Inspection Department replied.

“Then what are you waiting for? Press the button and shut it down!” Li Keer said.

But the worker shook his head and said, “We cannot stop it just yet. We have to wait until Open Sky Elder gets here.”

“Why?” Exquisite and Li Keer asked at the same time.

“Jail Demon Hall’s security systems are active. That means the Red Blood Demon inside is raging already. Its power is primitive class, but even so, our strength won’t be enough to tame and defeat it. We need to wait for Open Sky Elder to get here before we lift the security,” the Very High man explained.

“We don’t have time to worry about that right now. Hit the button! Han Sen is still in there! Saving him is more important,” Li Keer said.

The Very High man shook his head and said, “If Han Sen was in there, it has been over half an hour. He would have been killed by the Red Blood Demon several times over by now. It is pointless for us to open it now. We should wait for Open Sky Elder to get here.”

Exquisite didn’t respond. She teleported past the man. She was going to press the button to open the building.

The two Very High men gaped in surprise. They moved to stop her, but a voice halted them.

“Let her open it,” Open Sky Elder said as he teleported beside them. When he received the news, he had come as soon as possible, but it had already been half an hour, and therefore, it was likely too late.
