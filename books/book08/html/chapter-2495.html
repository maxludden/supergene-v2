<p>Han Sen brought the Tianxia Peacock King’s body back to the
white whale, and Bao’er quickly whipped out the little gourd and
absorbed the cloud inside it.</p>
<p>The damage done to the white whale was pretty severe. It could
repair itself, but being damaged that badly meant it would take a
while before it was completely fixed. The ship could hardly move at
this point. There were many holes that went clean through the ship,
and the entire structure seemed on the verge of falling apart.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, was that really the Holy Area Grass? Might I see it?”
Fang Qing Yu asked Han Sen, his eyes gleaming with hope.</p>
<p>“You know what the Holy Area Grass is?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu nodded. “I’ve heard of it, although I’ve never seen
it before. Even in the Thousand Treasures Alliance, there are only
a few tales and legends surrounding its existence. The details are
scarce, and we don’t even have any pictures of it.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean the Holy Area Grass is something very precious?”
Han Sen was so happy.</p>
<p>“It isn’t just precious. Even powerful factions like the
Thousand Treasures would like the Holy Area Grass. If this is the
real deal, this Holy Area Grass could be exchanged for the
ownership of multiple systems.”</p>
<p>“What is the Holy Area Grass used for?” Han Sen asked with
confusion.</p>
<p>So far, Han Sen hadn’t seen the Holy Area Grass do anything
other than attract xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Even if eating it could make you deified, it still wouldn’t have
the same value as a few large systems.</p>
<p>“I only know a few legends about it, but I don’t know if they
are true. According to the records of the Thousand Treasures
Alliance, eating the Holy Area Grass can provide access to a
mysterious xenogeneic space known as the Holy Area. There is no
sickness or death in that place, and when you enter it, it can make
you immortal,” Fang Qing Yu said after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Han Sen was rather disappointed. He knew that
claim couldn’t be true.</p>
<p>If being immortal was so simple, then the Sacred Leader wouldn’t
have gone to such lengths in attempting to extend his own life. He
wouldn’t have spent so much effort trying to kill a god.</p>
<p>Entering the Holy Area didn’t sound legit to Han Sen. If eating
the plant would let him enter some Holy Area, the black cricket
would have been there already. Why would it still be here?</p>
<p>“Oh no, Bao’er! Get that cloud of your gourd,” Han Sen hastily
told Bao’er, thinking about the black cricket.</p>
<p>The black cricket was still somewhere inside of that fluffy
white cloud, and Han Sen didn’t know if it had eaten all the Holy
Area Grass.</p>
<p>So, Bao’er released the cloud. Han Sen approached it and saw
that the Holy Area Grass was still there. He brushed the leaves of
the Holy Area Grass. He soon discovered that the root of the Holy
Area Grass had something ball-shaped on it. There was a tiny hole
in the ball-shaped thing. The cricket must have made a house in
there.</p>
<p>The hole looked too small to admit Han Sen’s fingers. He didn’t
know how to get the black cricket out of there without hurting the
Holy Area Grass.</p>
<p>“Brother Fang, do you think this is the Holy Area Grass?” Han
Sen gave the Holy Area Grass to Fang Qing Yu.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu accepted it and examined it. After a while of
observation, he said, “There isn’t much information available in
the Thousand Treasures Alliance, but this does look the same as the
illustrations that I’ve seen. I cannot be entirely sure, though. If
it is the real Holy Area Grass, you are going to have to find a way
to hide it. The Holy Area Grass is very attractive to many
xenogeneics, and they will do anything to claim it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face looked glum. He didn’t know if this was the Holy
Area Grass, but it had already attracted many xenogeneics. It had
even attracted deified xenogeneics like the Tianxia Peacock King.
Not even Destiny’s Tower had contained its magnetic effect on
xenogeneics.</p>
<p>“Daddy, I will help you keep it,” Bao’er said, her eyes closing
in a slow blink.</p>
<p>“Sure. You take it for now, then.” Han Sen knew Bao’er liked the
plant.</p>
<p>Han Sen would never skimp on the resources that he provided to
his daughter. Plus, he didn’t know how to deal with the Holy Area
Grass for now, so there was no harm in allowing Bao’er to hold onto
it for the time being.</p>
<p>Bao’er was very happy about this. She put the Holy Area Grass
and cloud back inside her little gourd.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, inside the Holy Area Grass is a black cricket. Earlier,
it broke the Tianxia Peacock King’s belly. You need to be careful
with that thing,” Han Sen warned her.</p>
<p>“Crickets are my favorite! I should get another one to make the
crickets fight,” Bao’er said happily.</p>
<p>“What I mean to say is that the black cricket eats the Holy Area
Grass. Don’t let it eat all the Holy Area Grass,” Han Sen said with
a wry smile.</p>
<p>“We need to let him eat it. We can’t eat the grass. It is only
useful to us if he eats it,” Bao’er said.</p>
<p>“You know what it is?” Han Sen asked Bao’er in shock.</p>
<p>Bao’er thought and then said, “I don’t know why, but I do know
that if he finishes all the grass, it can take us to a fun place
called the Holy Area.”</p>
<p>“Bao’er must have some sort of prophetic power,” Han Sen
thought. He knew Bao’er wouldn’t lie to him, but Bao’er seemed to
have the answers to the strangest questions. It was hard to imagine
what sort of creature she was.</p>
<p>Although the white whale was heavily damaged, they had earned a
lot in their most recent adventure. Han Sen had captured the Holy
Area Grass and the black cricket. He had also gotten the Tianxia
Peacock King’s body and the soul robe beast soul. All those items
were priceless.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what sort of power Bao’er’s little gourd had.
Ever since the Holy Area Grass was sucked inside, though, no
further cloud beasts came for them. The Holy Area Grass was no
longer connected to the outside world.</p>
<p>Han Sen found a chance to quietly transport the Tianxia Peacock
King’s body back to the sanctuaries. Right now, Han Sen had no way
of consuming the flesh of a deified xenogeneic. So, he had to just
store it for the time being.</p>
<p>Han Sen drove the white whale through the rest of the Tianxia
System. For a few days, it was smooth sailing and nothing bad
happened. They encountered a few King class cloud beasts, which
were swiftly killed by Han Sen.</p>
<p>Whenever there was free time, Han Sen kept trying to push The
Story of Genes’ self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>The Story of Genes’ self-cogwheel was the same as the
Blood-Pulse Sutra’s. They were separate and not connected to the
other universal cogwheels. However, unlike the Blood-Pulse Sutra,
it couldn’t connect with other-self cogwheels either. This cogwheel
was completely independent. It had no connection to anything else
in the universe.</p>
<p>It was different from the Dongxuan Sutra. The Dongxuan Sutra
connected to every cogwheel in the universe. The Story of Genes
couldn’t operate with a single other cogwheel.</p>
<p>According to most theories, the fewer connections a cogwheel had
to others, the easier it was to push. After all, it took power to
move every cogwheel, so the more cogwheels that needed to be moved,
the more strength was required.</p>
<p>But with Han Sen’s power, he still couldn’t push the
self-cogwheel of The Story of Genes. It was as if the cogwheel was
locked up, or maybe it wasn’t supposed to be moved.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Area and noticed that the cogwheel
wasn’t big. The white cogwheel also had weird symbols engraved
across it. Han Sen realized they were the same as those on Spell’s
forehead. They might have meant Eternity.</p>
