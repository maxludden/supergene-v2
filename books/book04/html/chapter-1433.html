    <p>
      Han Sen and Ling Mei’er were on their way to a gold shelter. The
      Underworld was a sprawling labyrinth that featured all sorts of places.
    </p>
    <p>Creeping across many of the rocks were thick, hardy vines.</p>
    <p>
      “Are these vines geno plants, by any chance?” Han Sen asked Ling Mei’er,
      pointing at the vine. The vines looked familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vines were not strong like the Aqua Vine, and more than anything, they
      almost looked like the ordinary, garden variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is the Underworld’s Holy Vine. They support the entire world; we
      down here are its protectors. When we finally acquire a gemstone geno
      core, we are allowed to return to Dark Spirit Shelter. That is the place
      that houses the primary vine,” Ling Mei’er explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can the Holy Vines produce fruit, and if so, are they beneficial?” Han
      Sen asked with much curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ling Mei’er smiled and said, “It can produce fruit, yes. But the elder
      says it has only ever produced one. As for when it next might mature, none
      can tell. The elder never leaves the shelter due to the terms of the
      Hundred Tribe Deal, but he also remains there to safeguard the vine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If your elder wants to protect it that much, it must be something quite
      powerful,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ling Mei’er receded into thought for a moment, before saying, “There is
      one fruit currently on the vine, but it has yet to mature. He hasn’t told
      me what it does, but I recall when I was small, he let me sit next to it
      and touch it. I don’t remember it being anything particularly special.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ling Mei’er described the fruit’s shape and size and then said, “But I’m
      not sure how all the vines can only produce one small fruit like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked to hear Ling Mei’er describe it, because he realized
      she was talking about a gourd. And learning this, it was like a lightning
      bolt struck his brain. He knew now why the vine looked so familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vines that gave birth to Bao’er looked exactly like this. The only
      difference was that the vines he had seen long ago were rotten, and that’s
      why his mind didn’t immediately make the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hearing what she had to say, he realized now that the Holy Vine was
      what those vines would have looked like if they weren’t all dried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen drew the shape of a gourd on the ground and asked, “Did the fruit
      look like this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; have you seen it before?” Ling Mei’er patted her own head then, and
      went on to say, “Wait, you’ve only just been born. There’s no way you’ve
      seen it before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. The gourd he drew was exactly the same one that
      Bao’er came out of. Did that mean Bao’er would have a connection to the
      Holy Vine?
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had mulled this over a lot in the past, and he was always
      interested in learning more about where Bao’er came from. Only humans or
      creatures with human blood could travel between the sanctuaries and the
      Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was from the gourd, so it was unlikely she had human genes. But
      then again, if that was so, how was she able to travel between the two?
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen was able to find out more about the Holy Vine, there was a
      chance he could discover more about Bao’er’s origins.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ling Mei’er’s knowledge of the vine was lacking, and it was highly
      likely only the elder knew much about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen really wanted to examine the Holy Fruit now, to see whether or not
      it was Bao’er’s gourd. But Ling Mei’er required a gemstone geno core
      before she would be allowed to return to the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ling Mei’er was not weak, but she was young and had not yet grown up.
      Without Snake King, she might have already been killed. It was difficult
      to tell when she’d earn a gemstone geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After taking this shelter, I will bring Bao’er and let her take a look at
      the vine.” Han Sen decided to help Ling Mei’er take over a gold shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelters of the Underworld were hewn from the stone of the realm itself.
      They came before a stone gate, which Han Sen inspected keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lock on it that had not yet been opened. It was unclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black and white Snake King had found this shelter before, but he was
      prohibited from helping Ling Mei’er take it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing the large construct, Han Sen noticed the presence of many creepy
      mask symbols adorning the stonework. Usually, the symbols that adorned the
      gate of a shelter were in some way connected to the shelter’s power. What
      this indicated, however, Han Sen could not quite tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judging from the size of the gate, Han Sen did not believe the shelter
      would be particularly big. It was either a silver or gold shelter.
    </p>
    <p>“This is it.” Han Sen broke the lock and opened her up.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ling Mei’er entered the lobby of that place, while the Snake
      King stayed behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can we really take this place for ourselves?” Ling Mei’er looked uneasy
      and unsure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lobby was host to a stone table and a number of stone chairs. On the
      furthest wall from them, there was a large depiction of a gold mask. The
      mask was the same as what he had seen on the gate to the shelter, but this
      work was far prettier than the cruder exhibits outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they approached it, however, the gold mask suddenly came to life
      and raced towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They weren’t given much of a chance to retrieve their geno cores to
      respond to the threat, and what was coming to them looked like a gold geno
      core. Swiftly, Han Sen responded by firing a coin at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coin planted itself firmly on the gold mask’s forehead, but it did not
      stop the mask as it came right for Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned. The single coin could have been too weak, so he then
      fired a barrage of coins at it.
