</div>

<p>After examining the details of the gold wing peacock king, Han Sen was even happier. That gold wing peacock king had three gene skills. It had top-notch talents.</p>

<p>Ordinary juvenile gene races only had one gene skill. There was a chance of some having none. If there weren’t any gene skills, they had to wait until they were adults before receiving their gene skills.</p>

<p>Each time they leveled up, there was a chance of gene skills being awoken inside a gene race. Still, that chance wasn’t very high. Ultimate-mode gene races could have three skills at the most.</p>

<p>Even if ordinary gene races did reach ultimate mode, they rarely possessed three gene skills. Having two was already quite phenomenal. Most of them only had one gene skill. Some gene races did not even have a single gene skill.</p>

<p>The gold wing peacock king had three. It was definitely the best of the best.</p>

<p>If Han Sen wanted to sell it, the price could be a few times or a dozen times more than the same species at the same level of gene race with only one skill.</p>

<p>This was especially true with gene races with three skills. If a gene race was rare and the gene skill was useful, it would go for the highest price. Han Sen had only seen a juvenile gene skill gold god wing. After combining, he was given golden wings. After he activated it, there was a break-space flying power available, and the gold wings had a scary destructive power. The wings behaved like blades that could cut through anything.</p>

<p>As for the peacock king eye and sky full of feathers, they were the awakened gene skills. Han Sen did not know what they did.</p>

<p>They were getting close to Gold Crystal System. The light was getting extremely bright. Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy combined with gene races to block it. Han Sen did not need to combine with a gene race, but he still wanted to try. He attempted combining with his gold wing peacock king.</p>

<p>A blurry, gold, glassy god light shone on Han Sen. The peacock wings, which were made of gold, appeared. Han Sen’s eyes had a shiny god light in them. It was like they were swirling with gold. They looked weirdly pretty. His long, gold hair was wavy like a waterfall. Every strand of hair was like crystal. It was like there was a glassy god light spinning inside it.</p>

<p>After combining with it, Han Sen was affected by the gold wing peacock king’s genes and presence. His face and body seemed to become longer. He looked rather pretty but somewhat like an evil king.</p>

<p>Bald Guy looked at Han Sen with shock. After a while, he swallowed his saliva and asked, “Han Sen, what is that gene race you have? Where did you get it from?”</p>

<p>Li Bing Yu looked at Han Sen. She had a strange expression. After combining with the gold wing peacock king, Han Sen looked far too pretty and handsome. He looked more handsome than an evil god. His entire body had an evil, pretty aura that was quite attractive.</p>

<p>“The gold wing peacock king,” Han Sen replied. “Oh, I dug it up. I do not know if there is another of the same type of gene race.”</p>

<p>“That is a shame. Your gene race looks really awesome after combining with it. If I, Bald Guy, had a gene race like that, perhaps my dreams would come true. Maybe I could have God Thousand Lotus.” Bald Guy looked at Han Sen with excitement. He then asked, “Is your gene race up for sale? If you sell it, the price is of no object. I will squander all of my savings and buy it from you.”</p>

<p>Han Sen had heard the God Thousand Lotus name before. With Feng Fei Fei, it was the same. She was one of the three big singers in the Qin Kingdom. Bald Guy obviously had a crush on her. He always talked about her, but she had no interest in him.</p>

<p>“I am not selling it.” It was not easy for Han Sen to get his hands on that ultimate-mode gene race. Han Sen wanted to use it. He wasn’t ready to pawn it off just yet.</p>

<p>The blood god dragon was also under Han Sen’s command. It had swallowed the black crystal armor to enter evolution mode. It would be hatching before too long. The only gene races Han Sen had to rely on now were the gold wing peacock king and the blood ghost spirit. It was a shame that the two of them could not become an exclusive blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse gene race. It was hard to receive the boons of a blood dragon God Spirit Blood Pulse. Their powers would have been inferior to the blood god dragon.</p>

<p>Bald Guy thought it was a shame, but he had not even asked Han Sen about the level or power of the gold wing peacock king. That was something very private. It was something unremarkable, so no one would have asked about it.</p>

<p>After getting close to the Gold Crystal System, they were able to see that it was not a big sun. It was a system made of many lights.</p>

<p>Most planets did not glow. Only planets like a sun glowed. Most other planets only reflected the light.</p>

<p>Now, all the Gold Crystal System’s planets were glowing with a scary light. The ordinary rocks and trees on the planets shone like treasures.</p>

<p>Even the manmade buildings and machines glowed in the incandescent radiance. The entire world looked as if it had been carved out of precious gemstones. It was incredibly holy.</p>

<p>Bald Guy pointed at the God Wind Dragon and commanded it to fly to a planet the humans lived on. When he saw what was glowing behind the buildings, his face changed. He said, “This God Spirit Blood-Pulse is too shocking. Even some spiritless items that are manmade have been touched by the scent of the God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It is far scarier than I imagined. Perhaps there is a rare gene race being born.”</p>

<p>“A rare gene race, huh?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. During the past two days, he had not seen the big sky demon. He didn’t know if she was still following him around or not.</p>

<p>Because the planet was close to the edge of the Gold Crystal System, many human nobles were able to travel there. They saw many people digging all around and across the place.</p>

<p>Bald Guy looked at them with much disdain. He steered the God Wind Dragon deeper into the Gold Crystal System. He said, “They don’t know anything about God Spirit Blood-Pulses. They are here to dig gene eggs. They will not be able to dig up a thing. This God Spirit Blood-Pulse is very scary, but not just anywhere will have a gene egg.”</p>

<p>Han Sen asked, “Where might there be a gene egg?”</p>

<p>Bald Guy seriously said, “In this place, the God Spirit Blood-Pulse has a lot of light. Usually, light and heat are elements that mesh well together. Although the light in this place is weird, the temperature has not changed. Judging from the light that is around this place, and if I have guessed it correctly, this God Spirit Blood-Pulse is in the light abyss formation.”</p>

<p>“Are you saying that the Qin Kingdom had a light abyss God Spirit Blood-Pulse 20 years ago?” Li Bing Yu suddenly said.</p>

<p>Bald Guy nodded with excitement. “Yes. This place is very similar to the light abyss the Qin Kingdom had. This light abyss has an Annihilation class wild God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It created the Qin Kingdom. A general there, named Tian Shan, shocked the world. The formation here is similar to that light abyss. Perhaps it will have an Annihilation class wild God Spirit Blood-Pulse.”</p>
