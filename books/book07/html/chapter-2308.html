<p>Han Sen and Bai Wei spent a few hours waiting atop the golden
king dragon. The king dragon still hadn’t gone underground when a
few men approached them. That made Bai Wei feel rather nervous.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen’s eyes were better than Bai Wei’s, he knew
exactly who was coming. The sight made him frown.</p>
<p>The leader of the group was none other than Prince Fourteen Bai
Canglang. The people following him had to be his Royal Guards.
There were four of them: two of the Lane race, one Ghana, and one
female of the Extreme King.</p>
<p>The four guards had an intimidating aura. They had to be at
least King class, and on top of that, the female Extreme King was
familiar to Han Sen. When Han Sen looked closer, however, he
realized that he didn’t actually know her.</p>
<p>“Brother Fourteen!” When Bai Wei saw Bai Canglang, her face
paled. She was too weak to compete with Bai Canglang, and she knew
it.</p>
<p>Bai Wei walked up to him and bowed. “Greetings, Brother
Fourteen.”</p>
<p>Bai Canglang looked at Bai Wei. He waved his hand. “Since you
now have access to the King’s Garden, you are nothing but a
competitor to me. There is no need for you to remain so
polite.”</p>
<p>After that, Bai Canglang glanced over her shoulder, his eyes
barely flicking to Han Sen before returning to Bai Wei. He coldly
said, “But you are my little sister. As a big brother, I shouldn’t
be the one to bully you. Choose one of these four knights. If you
can withstand one of their blows, you can keep this primary root
king dragon.”</p>
<p>“Brother Fourteen, you must be kidding. If you want it, just
take it. We can go and find another king dragon.” Bai Wei bowed and
readied herself to depart.</p>
<p>Bai Canglang stepped over and grabbed Bai Wei by the arm. He
smiled, showing his teeth. “Sister Wei, don’t think so little of
yourself. You are in the King’s Garden! You cannot avoid a little
healthy competition. You should get used to it, sooner rather than
later. But don’t worry, Brother Fourteen won’t steal your king
dragon. I just want you to understand how you are expected to
survive here in the King’s Garden.”</p>
<p>Bai Wei forced a smile. “Thank you, Brother Fourteen. I don’t
dare to overstep my bounds, though. I don’t want to fight with
anyone, and I would much prefer a stable existence here.”</p>
<p>“It is fine. Win or lose, you can have this primary root king
dragon.” Bai Canglang was still holding onto her arm as he spoke to
her.</p>
<p>A primary root king dragon was nothing to a prince like Bai
Canglang. If he did not take this one, it would be easy for him to
find another.</p>
<p>Bai Canglang was forcing Bai Wei into this position because of
Han Sen. He wanted Han Sen to know that following Bai Wei was a big
mistake.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw that Bai Canglang had grabbed Bai Wei’s arm and was
keeping her there. So, he walked over smoothly and bowed to Bai
Wei.</p>
<p>“If you insist, Prince Fourteen, then I am willing to do this
for my queen.”</p>
<p>Bai Wei was about to say something, but Bai Canglang had started
speaking already. “Ah, you are Knife Queen’s student indeed! So
brave. I greatly admire brave individuals like you. Please pick one
of the four guards next to me. Whether you withstand the attack or
not, you will still keep this king dragon.”</p>
<p>After that, Bai Canglang turned to the four guards in his
company. “Han Sen is Knife Queen’s student. I am good friends with
Knife Queen. You guys cannot hurt her student too much, so please
don’t go overkill with your powers. Okay?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the four guards and hesitated. He went to the
Extreme King female guard and said, “If you please.”</p>
<p>“Red Sleeve, do not hurt him,” Bai Canglang said firmly to the
female guard.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the female guard answered. She walked in front of
Canglang to stand directly before Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I am Han Sen. What is your name?” Han Sen greeted the female
guard.</p>
<p>It didn’t really matter which guard he selected. Every single
one there was a higher level than him.</p>
<p>He had selected her simply because he thought she seemed
familiar. He just couldn’t remember where he might have seen her
before. By doing this, he hoped to jog his memory and confirm his
sense of familiarity.</p>
<p>“Red Sleeve,” the female guard answered shortly. She raised her
fist and said, “If you can take my punch without falling, then you
win.”</p>
<p>After that, the fist started to glow with light. The light was
like a moon, and wherever the moon shone, the fabric of space
twisted.</p>
<p>Han Sen shifted his body a little. He felt as if the area around
him was being stretched. After he moved his body, he was still
where he had been.</p>
<p>“Space powers?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Red Sleeve’s fist hurtled toward him. It was like a moon
falling. Han Sen moved, but her powers seemed to be locking him in
place. And that moon was coming closer.</p>
<p>Han Sen squinted and looked at that coming moon. If he couldn’t
dodge, then he wasn’t going to dodge. He lifted a fist and punched
towards the moon.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked ill. Red Sleeve was a King class elite. She might
have even been half deified. Han Sen, on the other hand, had only
just become a Duke. No matter how strong he was, there was no way
he could fight Red Sleeve in such a manner.</p>
<p>Bai Wei knew exactly what Bai Canglang was up to with all these
theatrics. If Han Sen took this punch, he would be seriously
injured, if not killed outright.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>At that moment, Red Sleeve’s fist came into contact with Han
Sen’s own fist. The moon shattered like glass, and the space nearby
also broke, cracks running through reality around Han Sen’s
body.</p>
<p>Bai Wei was stunned. She had been sure that Red Sleeve wouldn’t
dare kill anyone inside King’s Garden, but the woman had exerted
her power with the obvious intent to kill. Han Sen’s body had been
annihilated by space power. Unless Han Sen had a very strong
revival power, he wouldn’t even have a chance to recover over time;
living was no longer possible.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was ripped open. His form then exploded like
water, scattering everywhere.</p>
<p>But then, another image of Han Sen became visible in exactly the
same place that he had previously stood. He was in perfect
condition, and he was just standing there. The Han Sen that the
moon had wrecked was just a doppelganger built using the Moon
technique.</p>
<p>“I am useless. Please punish me, my prince!” Red Sleeve looked
horrified. She bowed before Bai Canglang to apologize.</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s doppelganger technique is amazing. It even fooled me.
In that case, I couldn’t expect you to have seen through it.” Bai
Canglang waved his hand and gestured for her to fall back. He
smiled to Han Sen. “You are better than your teacher. It is no
wonder that you are Knife Queen’s student. I am so close with your
teacher. If you have time, you should come and visit me.”</p>
<p>After that, Bai Canglang told Bai Wei, “Sister Wei, I am so
happy that you managed to enlist such a good guard. You can have
this primary root king dragon. I am going to look for another. I
will see you later.”</p>
<p>After Bai Canglang left, Bai Wei spoke to Han Sen. “That was way
too risky. You almost died.”</p>
<p>“I am fine, though, aren’t I?” Han Sen laughed. As he turned his
gaze back to Bai Canglang, an expression of deep thought crossed
his face.</p>
