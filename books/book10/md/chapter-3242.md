  Affected by Qin Yuan, many of Jade Wall City’s loyal volunteers shouted, “Kill the evil man Han Sen!” Their voices shook Jade Wall City.

Han Sen’s eyes looked very ghostly. It was like he did not need to eat. His eyes looked over the land. He saw the old buildings becoming black dragons as their lights shocked the sky. They were like real dragons that could fly up into cloud nine.

He laughed when he heard the people shout, “Kill the evil officer Han Sen!”

“Evil officer, huh?” Han Sen looked at Qin Yuan and said, “That’s not that bad. In my life, if I have never had a bad influence of a friend to mess around with me. Isn’t that a failure?”

His words weren’t actually directed at Qin Yuan. It was because of the Dongxuan Sutra being too strong. It covered Jade Wall City. Nothing could escape his eyes and ears.

Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai had been humiliated because of him. He already knew that.

He knew Qin Jing Zhen was only doing what he did on account of Qin Bai. No matter what, Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai were adamant in staying on his side. They had been bullied because of it.

“Hmph! He is fallen. He is obscene. I cannot allow you to continue living in this world.” Qin Yuan raised his fists. He saw many of Jade Wall City’s old buildings glowing with gold light. A scary god light became the shadow of a real dragon for Qin Yuan. It made Qin Yuan’s dragon air so scary that one could not imagine

it.

When the power reached the maximum level, Qin Yuan threw a punch at Han Sen. A real black dragon came soaring out of his fist to rip space and roar in Han Sen’s direction. Everything around was eaten and swallowed by that fierce thing. No power could have ever hoped to stop the advance of that wild, black dragon.

Jade Wall City’s people and nobles were shocked by the scary black dragon. The god dragon was descending, and it was more shocking than if God Spirits were to start descending. It made people want to obey it.

The scary power made many of Qin Kingdom’s officers kneel and cry, “Long live the Qin Kingdom. Long live the real dragon!”

Han Sen let go of the Demon God Sword Spirit. He allowed it to float next to him as his other hand held the Inch Grey Sword.

The Demon God Sword Spirit was strong. It was strong like a sword God Spirit, but its power could not compare to the 10,000 years of the Qin Kingdom. Even if an Annihilation God Spirit arrived, they could do nothing to Qin Yuan.

Han Sen was murderous, which was why he let the Demon God Sword Spirit go. He clutched the Inch Grey Sword.

It had been so long since the sword had left its scabbard. That was because Han Sen had not used it. He could not activate the power of the Inch Grey Sword either. He only used it for its sharpness. There were no other benefits than that edge.

That benefit was enough for Han Sen.

The main and reverse Dongxuan Sutra powers exploded. It turned into a weird power that claimed the Inch Grey Sword, which ignited with an empty sword air.

In Han Sen’s eyes, the whole world turned into one with endless dots. The black dots were solid. They were the most primitive forms of substances in the kingdom.

“In the past, the power of Super Spank enabled him to tear off substance chains. If he was to use the Break World Dongxuan Sutra’s power to break the most basic structures, what would happen?” Han Sen’s eyes looked at the roaring and consuming black, real dragon. The Inch Grey Sword’s sword air grew stronger.

When the real black dragon’s mouth came before Han Sen, it was obviously intending to swallow everything around him. That was the moment Han Sen drew his sword. He slashed toward the black dragon.

The real black dragon was very overbearing in space. It was big. It was like a god that could consume the universe.

In front of the real black dragon, Han Sen and his sword were smaller than an ant. His movement to draw the sword was easily ignored. Everyone in Jade Wall City looked into the sky to observe what was happening.

Many people complimented Qin Yuan and the power of the black dragon. Some people felt nervous. Other people thought of other things.

Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin were very worried. The black dragon’s power was very scary. It was like it could consume Jade Wall City if it chose to, and Han Sen was just a human.

Although Feng Yin Yin had a lot of confidence in Han Sen, she still felt a bit worried for him.

Upon witnessing the scene, Qin Jing Zhen felt very bitter. He was a leader that had lasted for a thousand years, but he was no now a useless, dying man.

An officer raised his head to the sky and said, “Gods have eyes. They kill evil people.”

Chanting noises were coming from an old building. It was like Jade Wall City had a god voice covering it.

Jian Bu Gu stood in a garden. He frowned and looked at the real black dragon, which was so invincible and overbearing in the sky. He sighed and thought, “The Qin Kingdom’s law system is balanced. I am afraid that has come to an end.”

Everyone’s thought process was different. They all looked at the descending black dragon. Its attacks could shock the sky.

Suddenly, a sword light broke the sky. The real black dragon’s giant body was cut in half by the sword light. The sword light did not stop. It headed toward Qin Yuan, who was in space.

Qin Yuan’s face changed, but it was too late to dodge. There was a roar as the black dragon’s shadow raged even harder. In Jade Wall City, the light dragon shone. It was like it had been protected by the black dragon god. It punched toward the sword light.

The sword light and Qin Yuan’s fists struck each other. The whole of Jade Wall City rattled with a massive shake. All the old buildings erupted with a scary god voice. The god light reached the maximum volume, making Jade Wall City look snow white. It was like there was a dragon jade wall in space. Qin Yuan used Jade Wall City as a shield. A scary dragon air roared and exploded. It struck the sword light.

The sword light just flashed away and disappeared. There were only shockwaves leftover. It headed for space as it started to split.

The civilians of Jade Wall City went quiet. They did not know what had happened to the fight. They only saw Qin Yuan still standing in space not doing anything at all.

Katcha!

Suddenly, everyone heard a crunchy sound like a jade stone crumbling. In the next second, Qin Yuan’s body was split in half. His blood was like rain spilling out of him. When Qin Yuan’s body split, Jade Wall City suffered an earthquake. All the old buildings broke. The ground split and cracked, creating many trenches and fractures. It was like the world was coming to an end. Suddenly, there was a lot of crying and screaming. Everyone was shocked. They tried to escape in a stampede as the old buildings broke or started sinking into the failing ground.

The giant Jade Wall City looked as if it was going to crack wide open. Cracks developed everywhere and continued to expand.

“Oh, God! What is happening?” Someone was so shocked that they started to scream aloud. Everyone looked into the sky and saw a shadow standing aloft in space. He was holding a bronze sword with a Demon God Sword hanging around him. He was looking down on the collapsing ground that was bathed in moonlight. One could not see his face, but it made people feel a chill.
