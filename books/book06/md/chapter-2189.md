The little toads gathered around him, and they seemed to think he was one of them. The thought made Han Sen’s heart sink, though, and he found himself thinking, “I’m not some dirty toad!”

After that day, Han Sen continued coming back to absorb cold and moon powers twice every month. He didn’t need the Cold Palace guardian tablet anymore, and the big toad allowed him to follow the toad family to the waterfall. He was able to absorb the moon powers right next to the deified toad.

Han Sen’s Jadeskin grew stronger far faster. Han Sen initially thought it might need another year to reach Duke rank, but it was on the precipice of that change already. He believed that if he continued this steady absorption of cold and moon powers, he’d make it to Duke in three months.

When Jadeskin did become Duke, though, he’d have to track down a source of high-quality resources for himself. He couldn’t rely solely on Planet Eclipse.

It was a good place for early practice, but he couldn’t develop fully if he remained stuck there.

On that fifteenth of the month, when Han Sen was done guarding the door, he planned to leave Planet Blade and return to Planet Eclipse. But when he reached Yisha’s palace, two Rebate butlers approached, alongside Snowbird Duke.

“Han Sen, Moon Wheel King is looking for you. Please follow us to Full Moon Hall,” said a butler, his face expressionless.

“Why is Moon Wheel King looking for me?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Full Moon Palace was a place to hold discussions. Only the Kings of Narrow Moon were allowed to debate there. It was very rare for Moon Wheel King to summon a Marquise for an audience in Full Moon Hall.

“You will know when you get there, won’t you?” another butler said coldly.

Han Sen looked at Snowbird Duke. She was behaving strangely, holding herself a little more rigidly than usual. He did not say anything, but he just nodded to her.

“Moon Wheel King and the other Kings are waiting for you. Let’s go,” the butler told him, apparently in a rush.

Han Sen followed them to Full Moon Hall. On the ship there, Han Sen got to thinking, “Something bad must have happened to Yisha. Otherwise, there’s no way I’d be called to the Full Moon Office. If something has happened to her, then my days here will be over. Things might be coming to an end.”

Han Sen knew that the only other person of rank in Narrow Moon who liked him was Black-Moon King.

The other Kings were not very keen on him, despite being Yisha’s student. After all, Han Sen was not one of the Rebate. And he had consumed many of their resources. He was just fortunate that the Rebate didn’t flat-out hate him.

If Han Sen had been able to practice really quickly, perhaps the Kings would have viewed him differently. However, leveling up took Han Sen an excruciatingly long time. They did not think Han Sen would ever reach King, let alone become deified. This was one of the primary reasons they didn’t think too highly of him.

To them, his guardianship was just another example of his deficiency. If the post had been given to another talented Marquise, that person would definitely have become a Duke after so much time. No change had been observed with Han Sen, though. No change for him meant no gain for them.

Han Sen was backed by Yisha, but if she was gone, then the Rebate wouldn’t waste more resources on an outsider like him.

“The Rebate is too small of a faction. It is a higher race that used to be a slave race. They aren’t selfless, either. Only Yisha was willing to help me. What a shame this is!” Han Sen vented silently. He knew what was going to happen on this trip.

When Han Sen reached the Full Moon Office, everyone was sitting around a large table within.

Almost all of the Narrow Moon Kings were present. Moon Wheel King was in the middle. Black-Moon King, Shadow King, Flower King, Night River King, and the other Kings sat next to him. The table resembled a half-moon, and as Han Sen walked in, they all turned their attention to him.

“Greetings to all the Kings.” After Han Sen bowed to each of them, he stood where he was without displaying any emotions.

Moon Wheel King sighed and told Han Sen, “Yesterday, the Extreme King delivered some news to us. Your teacher, on her venture into the chaos system, was killed. Not even her bones remain. We are going to build a mausoleum in her honor. You were her only student, and so there are many things we must now do together.”

“I will do whatever I am able to. May I ask how my master was killed?” Han Sen bowed, feeling very strange about this.

In truth, Yisha was Han Sen’s enemy. He had only become her student as a pretense, and Yisha seemed to have accepted him as a student for reasons of her own, not because she was being altruistic.

But in all the time they had spent together, Yisha had treated him nicely. She had provided him with many opportunities. Without those opportunities, He might have spent ten years wandering around, and he wouldn’t have achieved half of what he had right now.

So, his feelings towards Yisha were very conflicted. Hearing she had died, an odd pang rolled through him. He didn’t really know what he was feeling.

“According to the Extreme King ambassador, she joined the siege against a deified xenogeneic. She was swallowed by it, and so nothing of her remains,” Moon Wheel King said with a sigh.

Moon Wheel King’s sigh was not fake. It wouldn’t be easy for the Rebate to raise a half-deified warrior. And Yisha had been their best hope of gaining a fully deified Rebate.

Losing Yisha was a big blow to their race.

If Yisha had not gone to the Extreme King, though, she wouldn’t have been able to become deified by herself. If she remained in Narrow Moon, she’d have been half-deified forever.

For someone like Yisha, stopping there would have been worse than death.

Han Sen stayed silent after hearing about her death. Being killed by a deified xenogeneic, without so much as a bone being left behind, was something of a clean way to go out. That was very much like her own style.

When Moon Wheel King lapsed into silence, Night River spoke. “After sorting out Knife Queen’s mausoleum, there will still be some things I will need you to do. You are her only student, so there are some legacy matters and items you will have to take over. I will confirm them, and later give them to you.”

Han Sen knew that this was the primary point. He didn’t know how much of a legacy the Rebate would be willing to leave him with.

Han Sen was afraid he wouldn’t have a say in these matters. Night River King surely didn’t want to give him anything, and it was definitely going to be a one-sided decision.

Han Sen had expected this, though, so he didn’t say anything. He listened to what he was told, and then he left Full Moon Office. He went to sort out her funeral arrangements.

“The Extreme King have sent the reward she was owed for the fight. It should be given to Han Sen…” Black-Moon King said, but before he could finish, Night River King interrupted him.

“Han Sen isn’t one of the Rebate, have you forgotten? He isn’t qualified to accept it. We have discussed this already. Say no more,” Night River King said firmly.
