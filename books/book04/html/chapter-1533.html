      “Is there a problem with this place?” Han Sen frowned as he looked around.
      He didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      God’s Retribution looked serious when he spoke next. He said, “It’s more
      than just a problem. It’s a big problem! I have been to this area before,
      and these flowers are frightening things. You’d do well to avoid touching
      them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The flowers are strange, that’s for sure. They are very vibrant, but they
      lack a lifeforce,” Six Paths chimed in, as he looked at the colorful
      flowers all around.
    </p>
    <p>“What happens if I touch them?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      God’s Retribution laughed and said, “I accidentally touched a red one
      once. I had to cut off my finger to save my life. If you want to give it a
      try, be my guest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the man’s hands and noticed he had all his fingers
      intact. Perhaps the missing finger had regrown, but he couldn’t know for
      sure. And that meant he didn’t know if God’s Retribution was lying or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to remain on the safe side, Han Sen followed the man’s advice and
      avoided interaction with the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be best for your pet, Little Star, to take us away from here. He
      can avoid touching these flowers, so he won’t be affected,” God’s
      Retribution said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen nodded. That would be the only way. There weren’t many flowers,
      but Little Star was huge, and he might have touched them if he walked
      normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone climbed atop Starsea Beast again, and Han Sen asked God’s
      Retribution, “So, you have been here before? Which way should we go to
      leave this place?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have come to this place, but I’ve never been to this spot precisely. I
      have no clue, either.” God’s Retribution shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths remained silent, but he didn’t know this place either. Six Paths
      was a born-emperor, and he couldn’t have come inside before. This was his
      first time here, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then we will have to try our luck then, won’t we?” Han Sen randomly
      selected a direction and allowed Starsea Beast to take them forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the starlight, Han Sen traveled between, across, and beyond the
      glaciers and flowers. Nothing was able to touch them, so they weren’t in
      any danger. But as they walked, they felt something was wrong. When they
      went past the next glacier, they saw a whole host more flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think you’ve selected the wrong direction. There are more flowers here
      than ever. We’re just going deeper into the meadow!” God’s Retribution
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you I was guessing. If you don’t like this direction, then how
      about you choose a way?” Han Sen shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That way.” God’s Retribution pointed out the direction he wished to
      travel in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen made Starsea Beast head in that direction, but after some time,
      Han Sen noticed the number of flowers had actually increased. They still
      seemed to be going deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go back! We can’t go any further here. There are too many of the
      flowers,” Little Fairy said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, Starsea Beast’s starlight began to dim. Its body was
      going back into a solid state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen checked the creature’s body and noticed its lifeforce was much
      weaker. Traveling that way must have cost it a lot of energy, and it
      wouldn’t last much longer.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen let Starsea Beast rest in a place that had no flowers.</p>
    <p>
      “It’ll be difficult for us to return,” God’s Retribution said, while
      panning the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the basketball court-sized patch they were in, the flowers
      covered every inch of ground that they could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless they could fly through the sky, he did not know how else the
      flowers could be avoided. Starsea Beast’s body was so big that without its
      special traveling skill, it’d end up touching each and every flower, after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen considered flying, but he saw some strange clouds in the sky
      above. It made him have second thoughts about that idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy had already told him he couldn’t fly too high while in the
      ruins, too. He most certainly couldn’t go much higher than the glaciers.
      If he did, the clouds would unleash a strange power. It was a force that
      had killed many creatures in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought about what he should do next. But suddenly, they saw a few
      shadows in the sky. Eleven of the Black Seahorses were flying by. They
      were pulling the same black chimenea behind them. Its snout flickered with
      the presence of blue flames, and it looked as weird as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is this?” God’s Retribution hadn’t seen those Black Seahorses
      before, so he frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths looked at the Black Seahorses in the sky and then appeared to
      think of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had seen them only once before, but he had no clue what they were
      doing or what they might have been after.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did appear slightly different than they had the last time Han Sen
      encountered them, though. That was because there were only Black Seahorses
      this time. There were no other Ice Seahorses around. Perhaps something had
      occurred, and they remained in the Frozen Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They can fly in the sky? If they can, I can do it, too. Let’s try flying
      away.” God’s Retribution made a decision, seeing the Black Seahorses
      flying above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t that hopeful, though. He shook his head. “You can try it,
      but I’ll stay here and wait for Little Star to recover.”
    </p>
    <p>
      God’s Retribution wanted to move, but he too decided to stay. He couldn’t
      truly fly, as his ability was more akin to jumping very high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eleven Black Seahorses, pulling the black chimenea, eventually
      disappeared from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths had been frowning at them the entire time, and it seemed as if
      he knew thing or two about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Six Paths, do you know anything about the Black Seahorses and their
      chimenea?” Han Sen asked. He wasn’t blind, so he knew Six Paths knew
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths maintained his silence for a little while longer, before asking,
      “Have you heard about the big fight of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary? The
      fight was huge, and many elites participated. Emperors and berserk super
      creatures abounded in it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I heard the super elites signed a Hundred Tribe Deal. Was it a result of
      this fight?” Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths nodded. “It was, but I wasn’t born yet. I don’t know the details
      all too well, but one berserk super creature who took part said they were
      fighting over a relic. Most of the spirits had never seen or heard about
      it, but they were dragged into the conflict by family or friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      No one said anything. They merely allowed Six Paths to continue, as they
      knew he wouldn’t bring up the story for no reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief pause, Six Paths said, “I knew that berserk super creature.
      He was one of the creatures that managed to steal the relic itself. It was
      said to be that black chimenea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was shocked, and they all exclaimed, “Surely it cannot be the one
      we just saw.”
