<p>Han Sen looked around carefully. Aside from the glowing silk,
there was nothing else he could see.</p>
<p>The sound of a heartbeat lasted for about a minute before it
came to a stop.</p>
<p>“There must be something bad about this place, for the monsters
to bring us here. Perhaps they are using us as a sacrifice to some
creatures that reside here. We shouldn’t walk in too deep, and we
should head back the way we came,” the bird-faced man said to Rocks
Fall Duke and Vic.</p>
<p>“Hawk Wing, you think too much. The cocoon has been put back
down, and an exit is no longer possible. Even if we were able to
escape this place, the monsters outside would surely not let us go
free,” Rocks Fall Duke said. Then, he turned to Han Sen and Yisha,
and said, “Arguing like this is wasting time and getting us
nowhere. So, why don’t we compete to see who will become the
leader?”</p>
<p>“You want us to kill each other in order to co-operate?” Yisha
laughed.</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke smiled and said, “My contest does not consist of
fighting. I have a hard metal, so let’s see who can inflict the
deepest mark upon it. Whoever does can be our leader.”</p>
<p>“That sounds fine to me,” Vic said.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing had no opinion, and Yisha just nodded. Han Sen didn’t
say anything, so everyone pretty much agreed.</p>
<p>“Who wants to go first?” Rocks Fall Duke pulled out a sheet of
metal that was about as big as his hand.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that their powers were being suppressed by Demon
Grave, so the difference in class did not matter much. Whatever the
case might have been in the outside world, their powers would be
similar here.</p>
<p>Leaving a mark would all be down to the weapon used and the
wielder’s proficiency with it. This wouldn’t be a contest for pure
strength.</p>
<p>“You suggested this, so you first,” Vic said.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Rocks Fall Duke agreed. He’d already known that he’d be
the first to strike.</p>
<p>He pulled out his long knife and slashed it. The blade came
against the metal, and it emitted a purple spark.</p>
<p>A dong noise was heard, and afterwards, a mark was left upon the
metal plate. It was around one inch deep.</p>
<p>“Teeth power. You have practiced the Rebate elder’s skill Teeth
Blade?” Vic looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke looked on cockily, and he said, “Mister Vic, you
are smart. You recognize a skill that belongs to the elders.” “Back
then, the Noble elder used Teeth Blade and teeth powers to light up
a lantern and grant the race its higher status.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this. But Teeth Blade requires a lot to practice.
Not many Rebates are able to cast it, so I cannot believe you are
so talented and have managed to,” Vic said.</p>
<p>“It’s a minor achievement.” Rocks Fall Duke lifted his lips. He
was very happy to hear such gushing praise.</p>
<p>Han Sen found it funny. Rocks Fall Duke’s Teeth Blade was
clearly beginner level. He didn’t have a pure cast of the Teeth
power. How Han Sen had learned enough of Teeth Blade to know that,
though, he was not sure.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Teeth Blade was just beginner, as well. But his Teeth
power was definitely stronger than what Rocks Fall Duke could
do.</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke wanted to use this power to achieve leadership
over the others. It was a great idea, but the reality was far
crueler than he expected</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen Yisha, who he guessed was a real heir to the
grand power of Teeth Blade. As such, she did not have any thoughts
to share over the demonstration.</p>
<p>“Who is next?” Rocks Fall Duke looked at them all.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing waved his hand and said, “Do not mind me. I don’t mind
having you or Mister Vic as our leader.”</p>
<p>“I’m not interested either; let him try,” Yisha said, nodding at
Han Sen. Why Yisha kept rooting for Han Sen was perplexing. Han Sen
was not moving yet, though. And Vic smiled and said, “Let me do it,
then.”</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke gave Vic the sheet of metal. Vic held the metal
and smiled. “I can use whatever power I possess to leave a mark on
it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If you can leave a darker mark than me, then you will be
our commander.” Rocks Fall Duke still sounded confident about
himself.</p>
<p>The destructive ability of Teeth power was the best in the
entire universe. Demon was good at Sky-Demon powers. They did not
miss, but they also did not destroy like the Teeth powers
could.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Vic smiled and unsheathed a dagger. Then he swung it at
the metal.</p>
<p>There was a katcha noise, and the metal broke.</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke was in shock. Even Yisha looked surprised.</p>
<p>All the power from the outside had been suppressed there, and
even the King class treasures would suffer suppression. For Vic’s
dagger to be able to cut through the metal, it meant that he could
easily kill them all if he so wanted.</p>
<p>With the Sky-Demon power, Vic seemed to be the strongest
there.</p>
<p>“Now I am the commander! Does anyone have an opinion about
that?” Vic said coldly.</p>
<p>The others did not speak. Rocks Fall Duke’s face had turned all
red, and he couldn’t bring himself to say a word.</p>
<p>“What dagger is that? And why does it have that raw power in
Demon Grave? It is stronger than the wooden weapons built from the
plants that reside here,” Hawk Wing asked as he looked at Vic’s
dagger.</p>
<p>Vic put the dagger away, smiled, and said, “I found this weird
dagger by chance. It’s only a Viscount weapon outside of here, so
even I was surprised to find out that it was not suppressed upon
being brought inside.”</p>
<p>Nobody else believed him. He had brought the dagger here
intentionally, that much was certain.</p>
<p>“Do you want to try leaving a mark?” Vic asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“No thanks.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>He knew nothing about this place, so commanding would not do him
any favors. If Yisha did not want this position, then there was no
point in him taking it, either.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will lead.” Vic smiled. He issued a formation
for their travel, and then they set out.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Rocks Fall Duke were up front. Vic and Hawk Wing
were in the back. He allowed Yisha to simply walk in the
middle.</p>
<p>They walked for a long time, but they never did feel right.
Nothing appeared, but as they went, they could tell there was
something residing inside the silk. It was like lightning.</p>
<p>As they went forward, the lightning became more active.
Eventually, it leaped out of the silk and landed on Han Sen. He
felt very numb.</p>
