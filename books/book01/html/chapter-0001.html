    <p>
      By a stony creek in a valley, a black-clad young man was holding a black
      beetle with a metallic sheen that looked like a cross between a crab and a
      Hercules beetle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Holding a dagger in his other hand, the young man swiftly cut the
      still-struggling claws off the beetle, revealing white and tender meat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost without hesitation, the young man sucked the meat out of the claws
      as if he were eating a crab, and swallowed it together with larger pieces
      of tougher meat.
    </p>

      A strange voice sounded in Han Sen&#8217;s mind, and some data also
      appeared.

    <p>
      &#8220;I have received zero geno points from more than thirty black
      beetles in a row. I must have eaten too much black-beetle flesh to evolve
      from it further. Zero points! When will I ever finish the first evolution
      and gain status.&#8221; Han Sen looked frustrated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over five hundred years ago, science and technology reached a very high
      level, and humans finally mastered space teleportation technology.
      Shockingly, when they tried to be teleported, they found that they were
      neither sent back to the past nor teleported to the future. They didn’t
      even travel from one planet to another. A completely different world lay
      at the other end of the space teleport channel.
    </p>

    <p>
      A world that human beings could not have imagined. In this world, all
      scientific and technological means lost their function: a machine gun in
      this world was not even as useful as a steel knife. Missiles and nuclear
      weapons would not explode, same as a heap of scrap iron. No mechanical or
      electronic equipment would work either.
    </p>

    <p>
      All kinds of horrible creatures inhabited this world. Human beings, who
      used to stand on top of the food chain because of their wisdom and
      technology fell to the bottom.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when people killed certain relatively weak creatures and ate their
      flesh, they were surprised to find that their own bodies changed
      considerably and evolved quickly in ways that science could not explain.
    </p>

    <p>
      What made people pleasantly surprised was that in this world, with the
      evolution of the body, their lifespans also increased, which was amazing
      news to all mankind.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following century, more and more people entered this world called
      &#8220;God&#8217;s Sanctuary,&#8221; gradually became familiar with the
      rules of this world, hunted its creatures, and saw their own bodies
      evolve. The higher the degree of physical evolution, the longer the life.
      Theoretically, if you could continue evolving, it could be possible to
      live forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this world, science and technology became completely useless. The only
      things that could help humans were the most primitive fighting skills.
      Ancient martial arts, which were almost forgotten in modern society, had
      an unexpected effect here.
    </p>

    <p>
      All kinds of ancient martial arts had been re-developed, and after more
      than 100 years of development, new martial arts schools were formed and
      became prominent.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to ancient martial arts, God&#8217;s Sanctuary offered another
      tool to enhance humans, the beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      When killing a creature in God&#8217;s Sanctuary, a person had a chance to
      obtain the beast soul of the creature. Beast souls had all kinds of forms
      and appearances. Some could be summoned to fight for men, and some
      appeared in the form of armor or weapon.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, some beast souls could even help humans transform so they
      could take the shape of terrifying monsters, magical birds flying between
      heaven and earth, or insects drilling underground.
    </p>

    <p>Neither martial arts nor beast souls had anything to do with Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      Even in modern society, advanced science and technology were in the hands
      of just a few people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen completed integrated compulsory education and entered God’s
      Sanctuary when he turned 16. What he had learned from school was no more
      than the beginning level new martial arts that everyone knew.
    </p>

    <p>
      As for beast souls, they were so expensive that Han Sen couldn’t afford
      even the cheapest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without martial arts and beast souls, or even advanced man-made alloy
      weapons, Han Sen was only able to kill some low-level creatures to eat
      their flesh and evolve, and he was having a difficult time in God’s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the more meat of low-level creatures he ate, the less effect of
      evolution he gained. Three months in God’s Sanctuary and he still could
      not complete a physical evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had tried to kill some of the more powerful creatures, but even
      the weakest primitive creature, the copper-toothed beast, almost took his
      life. He had to rest for nearly a month before returning to God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      By this time Han Sen had eaten all kinds of ordinary creatures around him,
      and it wouldn’t help to eat their flesh any more. If he didn’t risk
      hunting more advanced creatures, he would never evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he was about to try to kill a copper-toothed beast, Han Sen saw
      something climbing out from the ripples of the creek.
    </p>

    <p>
      He originally thought it was a black beetle, but immediately noticed
      something different: all black beetles had black shells, but a bright
      golden color caught his eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gazed at the creature climbing out of the water. It really was a
      black beetle, but different from the ordinary ones because of its golden
      body as big as a basketball. It was like a sculpture carved from gold, and
      its eyes were crystal clear, like gems. It did not even look like a living
      thing unless observed carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why is this black beetle so strange?&#8221; Han Sen stared at the
      golden black beetle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently he had killed countless black beetles and knew everything about
      them. Their vision was poor, but their hearing was very sensitive. As long
      as he remained still, even in close proximity, a black beetle would not
      notice his presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stared at the strange beetle, and unexpectedly, it climbed toward
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without hesitation, when the golden black beetle crawled next to Han Sen,
      he held down the golden black beetle&#8217;s shell with one hand and
      swiftly cut into its fragile joints with the dagger in his other hand. He
      made six clean cuts vertically and horizontally to remove all six claws of
      the beetle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden black beetle struggled and flipped over. Taking this
      opportunity, Han Sen pierced his dagger into a white mark on its belly and
      turned it sharply. The golden black beetle suddenly stopped moving.
