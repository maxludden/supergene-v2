<p>Han Sen’s continued traversal of the core area was free from
strife. Although many people sought to follow him, none of them
sought trouble.</p>
<p>That was what depressed Han Sen, though. Not even the Demons
came looking to start a fight. Han Sen wanted more of those Demon
Dolls, and he wasn’t getting another chance to procure one.</p>
<p>The next day, Han Sen decided to let Autumn Wind go. He didn’t
really need another person to pull the rickshaw for him, and if the
Demon weren’t going to come, there was no point in doing any of
this.</p>
<p>“Brother Wind, you’ve fulfilled your promise. You can leave
now.”</p>
<p>Autumn Wind was actually pretty nice, so Han Sen didn’t want to
trouble him too much.</p>
<p>After Autumn Wind heard this, he shook his head determinedly. He
said, “No! No! Since I lost, I must uphold my end of the
bargain.”</p>
<p>“You’ve already pulled it all day. That’s plenty,” Han Sen
replied with shock.</p>
<p>“One day is not enough,” Autumn Wind said. “I have to help you
and these two ladies for at least year. No, ten years! It is my
pleasure to help you three out.”</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng was so angry, and he thought to himself, “You are
such an idiot. Why would you want to be a rickshaw boy?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Autumn Wind and said emotionlessly, “We don’t
need this rickshaw anymore. You may leave. Perhaps we will meet
again one day.”</p>
<p>Autumn Wind still didn’t look willing to leave. He said, “Even
if you don’t need a rickshaw, there must be some other service I
can do for you. I can hunt down xenogeneics and cook well. Let me
work for you.”</p>
<p>“Just go while we’re letting you live. Stop talking crap!”
Elysian Moon said in annoyance.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind sighed and said, “If you insist on me leaving, then
I will. I hope I can see you both again someday.”</p>
<p>After that, Autumn Wind dropped the rope and departed. He kept
looking back as he was leaving as if he didn’t want to go. People
would think that being a rickshaw boy had been a luxurious vacation
for him, not an arduous task that he was conscripted into.</p>
<p>“This Autumn Wind would do anything for pretty girls. What a
player.” Han Sen laughed. He knew that Autumn Wind was only there
for Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng.</p>
<p>After Autumn Wind left, Ji Yang Sheng saw Han Sen look at him.
He thought to himself, “Let me go… let me go… let me go now…”</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? Hurry up and pull our rickshaw,” Han
Sen said with a cruel stare.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Ji Yang Sheng was furious. He wanted to slap Han Sen
more than a few times, but all he could do was pull the
carriage.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In a distant corner of a dark world, a dim light was shining
amidst the old ruins of a palace.</p>
<p>“Old Cat, are you sure Little Sacred Leader can go to the
sanctuaries now?” Auntie Mei asked, looking at Nine Life Cat.</p>
<p>“Old Cat, you better think this through. If something happens to
Little Sacred Leader, I will kill you,” Old Vulture said to Old Cat
with a fearsome gaze.</p>
<p>Old Cat laughed. “Don’t worry. I’m not wrong about this. Little
Sacred Leader is going to be King class. This is the best time for
him to earn genes in the sanctuaries. If he reaches King class, his
self-cogwheel will be complete. Then, it will be too late for him
to earn the genes he requires. He must reset his body’s genes
before he becomes King class, then he can use his self-cogwheel to
become King class.”</p>
<p>“But Little Sacred Leader is already a Duke. Are you sure it is
safe for him to go to the sanctuaries?” Auntie Mei asked.</p>
<p>“Others might not fare well, but Little Sacred Leader won’t have
any trouble.” Old Cat paused and then went on to say, “Don’t worry.
I will be following behind Little Sacred Leader. I won’t allow
anything bad to happen to him.”</p>
<p>“You better… Otherwise…” Auntie Mei coldly grunted.</p>
<p>Those scary people said goodbye to Littleflower. Not long after,
a man and a cat took a lantern with them as they left the ruins.
They ventured out into the darkness.</p>
<p>“Old Cat, I want to see my mother,” Littleflower said to Old
Cat. He was holding the lantern as he walked.</p>
<p>“Of course. You can now go anywhere, but you must know that your
mother loves you so much. When you are back, she will want to keep
you and not allow you to go anywhere. But this world is going to
end, and when that happens, your mother, family, and friends will
all die. If you don’t level up and save all of existence, then your
mother and your father will leave you. Even your cute sister will
die. You saw the video of her, right? Do you really want them to be
killed?” Old Cat said.</p>
<p>“Only I can save the world? Is there no other way?” Littleflower
asked, looking at Old Cat.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are the savior of this world. Only you can save
everybody,” the Old Cat answered seriously.</p>
<p>“Fine. We will go to the sanctuaries. I won’t let my parents or
my sister get hurt. I will save the world.” Littleflower’s face
looked certain of this.</p>
<p>“Yes. Just like that. Save the world, and then you can be with
your family,” the Old Cat said with a nod and a blink.</p>
<p>Standing in the First God’s Sanctuary, Tang Ming’er happily
clutched her knife and rushed forward. She headed for the fields,
wanting to kill creatures. She had just turned sixteen, and this
was her first time in the sanctuaries, but the weird thing was, the
shelter she resided in was empty. She was the only person
there.</p>
<p>That didn’t matter to Tang Ming’er, though. She had the Tang
family’s positive personality, and she was confident in her
abilities. She didn’t care if there was no one there. She just
wanted to kill creatures quickly.</p>
<p>After running for a short while, she saw two creatures running
across the fields. Tang Ming’er was happy about this. She sprinted
toward them with her z-steel knife.</p>
<p>But when Tang Ming’er drew close, she was given a fright. The
two creatures were a twelve-year-old boy and a beast that resembled
a cat.</p>
<p>The boy had red lips and white teeth. He was beautiful, and he
looked like a human.</p>
<p>People couldn’t enter the sanctuaries until they were sixteen,
though. If they entered before their sixteenth birthday, their
bodies would be damaged. With that in mind, he couldn’t have been a
human.</p>
<p>“Are you a human or what?” Tang Ming’er asked, raising her knife
as she drew close to the boy.</p>
<p>“I’m human. You’re a human too, right, big sister?” Littleflower
looked at Tang Ming’er with curiosity. He hadn’t seen another human
in years.</p>
<p>Tang Ming’er felt relieved to hear he was a human, but she
didn’t think that could be true. She pulled out her knife and
pointed it at Littleflower. She said, “Don’t lie to me. Humans can
only enter the sanctuaries when they are sixteen. You are so small.
How did you enter the sanctuaries before that?”</p>
<p>Littleflower was about to respond when he heard something
tearing its way out of the soil. Grass and dirt fountained up, and
a ten-meter-long centipede came out of the ground. It was going to
attack Tang Ming’er and Littleflower.</p>
<p>“Run!” Tang Ming’er’s face went pale. She picked up Littleflower
and ran toward her shelter.</p>
<p>Before she entered the sanctuaries, she had read about the
creatures that lived there. She immediately knew this was a
sacred-blood demon centipede. She had just entered the sanctuaries,
and so she couldn’t beat it.</p>
