<h2>There Are Still Creatures Like That?</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2112</h3>

<p>Crazy Cow Viscount kept attacking Littleflower, but despite all
its efforts, it could not hit him. All its scary punches ended up
flying harmless past or hitting the ground, kicking up a flurry of
sand.</p>
<p>“Don’t run! Fight Grandpa Cow,” Crazy Cow Viscount shouted as he
chased after Littleflower.</p>
<p>He had thrown countless punches, but he couldn’t even brush
Littleflower’s clothing.</p>
<p>At the same time, Littleflower was completely confused. Crazy
Cow was so ferocious and confident, but Littleflower could not wrap
his head around why the creature’s attacks were so flawed.</p>
<p>“This must be a trick…” Littleflower usually practiced with the
elites in Sacred, and even a simple attack from one of those
monsters had subtlety and depth.</p>
<p>Littleflower had learned that skills that appeared simple were
often the most frightening.</p>
<p>So, Littleflower thought that Crazy Cow’s confidence meant it
was a strong enemy. He kept thinking that the cow’s awful
techniques and misses were some sort of trick. He never once
contemplated there might be noobs in the world.</p>
<p>But as time went by, Littleflower eventually realized the
mistakes were indeed genuine. There was no ulterior motive, and he
was not going to be tricked.</p>
<p>“Fight me! Fight me! Fight me!” Crazy Cow was getting mad. He
was looking murderous, and there was no fear in his rage-filled
eyes.</p>
<p>He had punched for so long, but he had yet to even damage
Littleflower’s clothes. He felt so powerless, and that overwhelming
sense of failure drove him even crazier. He wanted to fight, not
run around trying to catch a mouse.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Crazy Cow Viscount saw Littleflower come to a stop. He
was so happy. He gathered up all his power and turned it into
speed. He raced forward faster than he ever had in his life,
preparing to punch Littleflower. He shouted, “Kid, there is nowhere
to run!”</p>
<p>Littleflower was not planning on running, though. He too lifted
a fist, aiming it at Crazy Cow.</p>
<p>“Good! Come and feel Grandpa Cow’s power.” Excitement pulsed
through Crazy Cow’s veins. His big body twisted as he threw all his
power into his punch.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Crazy Cow Viscount’s giant fist came against Littleflower’s own
little fist.</p>
<p>But Crazy Cow’s creepily ecstatic face went blank. He looked
shocked at first, and then that shock became horror as his body
reversed direction and began to soar backward. With the twinkle of
a star, he disappeared somewhere in the distance.</p>
<p>“Could it really have been that weak?” Littleflower froze. He
stared up at the sky, not believing what had just happened.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Inside another section of the Geno Being Scroll, many fights
were raging. People were getting kicked out of the match every
second, whittling down the roster to only the ten thousand that
were allowed to remain.</p>
<p>Han Sen slowly walked across a field, but there were no
creatures around. Even if he had been really eager to get into a
fight, he wouldn’t have been able to. He’d been walking for a
while, and he still hadn’t seen anyone.</p>
<p>Time passed, and many more creatures were kicked out. After ten
days, the initial fights came to an end. Han Sen spent most of that
time waiting. After defeating Dragon Thirty-Nine, he hadn’t
encountered any other creatures.</p>
<p>Han Sen was resting on a field when he felt the dimension
distort. He eventually found himself back in the Fire Lotus
system.</p>
<p>The other tier battles ended over the next few days, and when
the roster for every tier had been whittled down to ten thousand,
the painting on the scroll became dust. It started to show the
rankings again.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked over it, and he found himself in the nine
thousand bracket of the Marquise tier. He was practically near the
end, but there was the figure 2 listed by his name. Han Sen started
reading the other entries, and he saw that every other being had a
number beside their name, as well. The higher their rank, the
greater their number.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly realized what he was looking at. That was the
number of enemies they had defeated.</p>
<p>After Han Sen entered the Geno Being Scroll, he killed Black
Steel Beast and Dragon Thirty-Nine. He didn’t kill any more
Marquises, and no one else sought to provoke him. So, his score
remained a measly 2. The names up high on the rankings had
thousands of wins.</p>
<p>But those rankings were just temporary. When the ranked fights
began, that was when you fought for first place.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the first few ranks, and he saw Dragon Eight
of the Dragon occupying the number one slot. The one that was
number two was just a paw print. What race that was, Han Sen hadn’t
a clue.</p>
<p>The next few were beings of races Han Sen was unfamiliar with.
There was a Demon at number five, however, and its name was
Kahn.</p>
<p>“That guy survived and joined the Geno Being Scroll, huh?” Han
Sen moved on, unconcerned.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked further down and saw a few more creatures he did
not know. There were too many different races in the geno universe.
Han Sen hadn’t expected to recognize many names, but he did see a
few Sky in lofty places on the leaderboards.</p>
<p>When Han Sen looked into the eight thousand ranks, he saw Lone
Bamboo’s name.</p>
<p>“It looks like the rankings don’t mean much now. Many of the
truly scary sorts are probably at the back, like Lone Bamboo,” Han
Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the other ranks, but it was like looking at
nothing. He didn’t know any of them.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned to the King class tier rankings and saw Knife
Queen there. She was six thousand places away from the top. Since
the Sky Palace leader was deified, he couldn’t participate in the
Geno Being Scroll. But even if he had been able to, he wouldn’t
have joined.</p>
<p>The first place in the King class rankings was held by Dragon
One. Han Sen did not know if it was the Dragon One he encountered
in Return Ruin Sea or the Dragon One from a century ago. They were
two different people.</p>
<p>The Dragons were ranked like that every generation, so there was
always more than one Dragon One.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not interested in the low level ranks. He only
glanced at the first few lackadaisically. When he looked at the
Viscount scoring, though, he was given a shock.</p>
<p>“Littleflower?” Han Sen saw the first rank on the Viscount
leaderboard read “Sacred – Han Littleflower.”</p>
<p>“That cannot be my Littleflower, can it?” Excitement bubbled
within Han Sen. If that was really his son, then Han Sen now knew
that he was in a place called Sacred. It’d be much easier to find
him with that name.</p>
<p>For the longest time, he had been unable to find out where
Littleflower was being held. It was all because he had no clue
where to even begin looking. The universe was far too big.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted the rank fights to start soon, so he could
confirm that the Viscount leaderboard was true. He wanted to find
out if that Littleflower was indeed his son.</p>
