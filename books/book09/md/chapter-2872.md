“Weird. How has his body recovered already?” Han Sen was looking at Pluto Peacock’s wounds where Burning Lamp came out from. He was shocked by what he had seen.

Burning Lamp was in the underworld. Now, his body had completely recovered. The blue-green transparent color was gone.

According to the theory, Burning Lamp was unable to withstand the underworld god light power. He became part of the underworld. After he became part of the underworld, he was not a threat to Pluto Peacock. He was no longer unable to damage Pluto Peacock’s body.

Now, Burning Lamp had emerged safely. His body had returned to normal. It was like he had never been injured. If Burning Lamp had that power all along, he did not have to go through so much trouble and get swallowed by Pluto Peacock before fighting back. “It looks like the problem is the knife.” Han Sen looked at the knife as he spoke to himself.

God, who was near him, continued speaking. “It looks like it has something to do with the power of the knife. Otherwise, Burning Lamp would be dead.

“This knife’s power cannot be reverse-cause, can it?” Han Sen asking after thinking for a moment. “I do not know,” God said. “More accurately, it might be a consequence of cause. Pluto Peacock used underworld god light to damage Burning Lamp and later consume him. Everything that was done to Burning Lamp was the cause. Then, that knife could absorb the cause power and turn it into his own power, which could be reversed upon the enemy that created it.”

“If things are like that, then having that knife can make you invincible,” Han Sen said. “No matter how strong the enemy is, the knife will absorb its power and cast it back. No matter how strong the enemy is, you can fight back.” “That is the theory, but first, you need a body that can withstand such damage. If your body cannot sustain the damage being dealt, you will be killed before the knife can absorb all the power and unleash it. It does not matter how strong the knife is.” God laughed.

“You are right. It is no wonder Burning Lamp can reach the top 100. It all came down to the knife.” Han Sen stared at the knife with fire in his eyes. He was thinking, “No matter if the knife is my blood knife blank or not, when I destroy the Buddha Kingdom, I am taking that knife. With my body’s fitness and that knife, it might not fare well in the beginning, but I can certainly tackle true

gods.”

Pluto Peacock was heavily injured. It was so angry that it cast underworld area again, but it was too injured. The power of the underworld god area was reduced, and the wounds could not be healed by the underworld. Burning Lamp used his knife to attack the creature’s wounds. It made Pluto Peacock very angry, but the wounds were becoming worse. It had no choice but to quit the battle. Burning Lamp won the battle.

Han Sen thought about the fight that had just ended and sort of understood how the knife functioned now. “Burning Lamp really is a tricky man. That knife can attack any second. He waited until Pluto Peacock swallowed him before attacking. That is a sort of patience not everyone can have.”

The knife itself would not absorb Burning Lamp’s wounds. It required activation from Burning Lamp for the power to be unleashed. That was when the knife absorbed the wounds he had incurred or the cause power. After all the cause was absorbed, Burning Lamp’s body would return to normal again like he was never injured in the first place.

The knife that absorbed the cause power could release an attack power that was equal to what had previously been dealt.

The knife’s power did seem to have its limitations. One could not just use it whenever. It required some time to separate it. Also, Burning Lamp’s body was getting more and more wounds. The power the knife could release was able to become stronger. That was why Burning Lamp endured it all the way and enabled himself to be swallowed by Pluto Peacock. It gave back all the damage to Pluto Peacock that it was unable to recover from.

Burning Lamp then used the power of the knife. Because the power that had been absorbed was minimal, it did not deal much damage. Just like God had said, the more power the body could endure, the more power the knife was able to release. “This is a f*cking self-torturing knife. If you do not get hurt, it is not strong. The more you are hurt, the stronger it becomes. Where did Burning Lamp get this knife from?” Han Sen could not help but complain.

Regardless, it was evident that Burning Lamp had won the match. He kept his rank of 84. The ranking of 84 was not really a rank that others wanted to fight for. Even though Burning Lamp had been swallowed by his enemy, he was able to come back out alive. It made the creatures of a lower rank not dare challenge him. After this fight, no creature dared challenge him anymore. “Never mind, I will just let him be happy for a bit.” Han Sen did not want to challenge Burning Lamp either. Rank 84 was too low. Han Sen did not have much chance to win by challenging the top 10. If he challenged those in the top 20 to 30, he might have stood a chance. He would have received many rewards. Thus, Han Sen did not risk wasting time by challenging Burning Lamp. Plus, Han Sen was planning a trip to visit the Buddha Kingdom anyway. The more benefits Burning Lamp received now, the more benefits Han Sen would receive after his holiday. So, there was no need for him to disrupt Burning Lamp’s ranking now. From Han Sen’s perspective, Burning Lamp was now something like an employee of his. “So, who should I challenge?” Han Sen thought to himself. Although Han Sen really wanted to challenge Demon Alpha, he knew that even if he used all of his power, he might not be able to defeat Demon Alpha. He quickly gave up on the idea. Lou Lie was a member of Blood Legion. Blood Legion had helped Han Sen out in the universe, so he did not want to hurt them either. Regarding Very High Leader, unless Han Sen used Super God Spirit mode, he did not have what it took to fight back. He also gave up on that idea.

Han Sen again looked at the top 10. None of them were good to fight. Han Sen also made use of his law eye. Some of them had crime meters, but their crime meters were not high enough to see them dead.

Using the law eye against them would not have been an effective tactic.

Han Sen kept trying to choose. In the end, he looked at a xenogeneic ranked 25. It was a xenogeneic that looked like an elephant. Its name was Maha God Elephant.

Its power seemed to be strong, but its primary power was just a powerful holy light that could heal.

Han Sen saw an Extreme King wanting to challenge him. He used all sorts of geno arts to attack the Maha God Elephant, but the God Elephant merely stood where it was without moving. It kept spewing a holy light. Within that holy light, its body was healed faster than it was able to be hurt. In the end, the Extreme King fighter was too tired. He ended up conceding. It was such a powerful defensive and healing power. Ordinary true gods could not do anything to it, but it was perfect for Han Sen. He had the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. Its attack power was the best. There was a very high chance of it defeating the Maha God Elephant.

But Han Sen was not in a rush. There were a few more days to go before the challenges ended. Han Sen planned to just sit and watch for now.The geno god list lights were flickering. Two ranks lit up. Han Sen glanced at them. One of them was Sky Palace Leader’s Zhang Xuandao.
