<p>After leaving Planet Blade, Han Sen did not see the woman again.
He asked Black Steel about her, and he was told that Extreme King
had indeed sent someone there. But aside from Moon Wheel King and
the other Kings, no one had been granted an audience with her. Her
identity was still a bit of a mystery to them.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a bit of an interest in the entities of Extreme King
now, especially after witnessing the punching skill employed by
that woman. Their levels and bodies were of a similar capacity, but
that punch she unleashed was truly frightening. Han Sen had many
geno arts, but he believed the only one that could effectively
combat her was Break Six Skies.</p>
<p>And in regards to using his Super Spank powers, Han Sen could
only use that while he was Dollar. If he used it as Han Sen, he
might be recognized. After all, that was like a signature power of
Dollar. It wasn’t something Han Sen would use on a whim.</p>
<p>But ever since that first encounter with the Extreme King woman,
Han Sen hadn’t seen her again. It was likely she might have left
Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to Cold Palace just before the first day of the
month, planning to wait there until the next day rolled around. If
Yisha had asked him to handle this matter, he knew it had to be
something special. Due to that, he did not want to risk running
late or being careless.</p>
<p>Han Sen settled himself on the porch in front of the stone
house. The porch was clean, as if it had been frequently visited
and used. It was far cleaner than the stone house, and it looked as
if Yisha sat in the same place he was right now when she kept watch
over the construct.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat on the porch and observed the stone door, waiting
for twelve o’clock to come. He didn’t see anything inside the
house.</p>
<p>Time passed, and eventually, the clocks struck twelve. At that
moment, Han Sen felt the temperature drop.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the stone house, and he immediately noticed
that the chill air was coming out of the house itself.</p>
<p>The stone building was releasing a cold air that was actually
quite overbearing.</p>
<p>No matter how cold it became, though, no frost appeared on the
walls. The stone house looked like it always did. The only
difference was the coldness it was exuding.</p>
<p>As Han Sen observed with curiosity, the stone building’s door
began to open soundlessly back into the house. It revealed a
cave-like entrance that was completely dark.</p>
<p>When Han Sen looked closer, he realized that it really was a
cave. There was a cave inside the stone house, and the chill was
creeping out of that black space.</p>
<p>The chill now swept out in full force, gushing through the open
doorway like a tide. It froze the nearby rivers and even the
waterfall. The ice crept up the grand waterfall, turning the entire
river into a solid chunk.</p>
<p>“That’s a very strong frost air,” Han Sen thought in shock. The
Cold Palace Guardian tablet, which was attached to his waist, had
also started to glow. It protected Han Sen from the chill draft,
separating him from it.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to use the cold air to practice Jadeskin, but the
tablet was keeping the chill air from touching him. He wanted to
put the tablet away, but all of a sudden, noise sounded from the
stone cave.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked towards the stone cave. It was obscenely dark.
Even Han Sen’s vision could not pierce that impenetrable veil of
darkness.</p>
<p>But he was still able to hear something moving around in there.
Not long after, a body emerged from the dark. It was half a meter
tall.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood there stiffly, trying to guess what it was.
Weirdly, the thing looked like a toad made of green jade.</p>
<p>A series of red symbols were inscribed across its green back.
Its body was very cold, and when it appeared, the temperature fell
so fast that it was difficult to imagine. Everything around the
beast was immediately covered in ice. The mountains, the rivers,
the plants, the trees, and all the animals were frozen. It seemed
like space and time had frozen, as well. The world became so quiet
when the toad appeared that even the wind stopped.</p>
<p>Only the Cold Palace Guardian tablet on Han Sen’s waist was
shielding him from that cold power. It allowed Han Sen to move as
he wanted to.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, though. “Is it a deified creature? I didn’t
know Narrow Moon had a deified creature. Does something this
powerful actually serve Narrow Moon?”</p>
<p>As Han Sen pondered its presence, the green toad fully removed
itself from the stone house. It looked like a slippery thing as it
slid out of the doorway and turned to look at Han Sen. It noticed
the Cold Palace Guardian’s tablet, then ignored him. It ventured
over to the frozen waterfall.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he was in a lot of danger. “It is fortunate I
didn’t put the tablet away. I do not know if my Jadeskin can resist
this much cold power. And this thing only seems to recognize the
tablet. The fiend would probably kill anyone who wasn’t wearing it.
That must be why everyone needs a tablet to come here.”</p>
<p>The jade toad hopped its way beneath the waterfall, and the ice
around it began to melt.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, a small pool of water formed beside the
toad. The waterfall remained frozen, so there was no more water
coming down to fill the basin.</p>
<p>The green toad then dove into the water and quickly disappeared
from sight.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how deep that water was. He could only see
the first hundred meters, and he had no idea what lay at the
bottom.</p>
<p>After the toad sank into the water, no further sign of the
creature emerged. Han Sen was supposed to be on guard, and he did
not know when he could expect the toad to reappear.</p>
<p>“Yisha wanted me to guard this place, but why? So I could watch
a toad go for a dip?” Han Sen pondered this entire scenario, but he
couldn’t come to any satisfying conclusions.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I don’t know when the deified toad will come back
out, so I’ll make the most of this and use the cold air to try to
refine my Jadeskin.” Han Sen cast Jadeskin, and his entire body
became an icy figure. He then set the tablet down beside him.</p>
<p>As soon as the tablet left Han Sen’s body, he felt the true
power of the cold air suddenly pound into him. In no time at all,
he knew it would freeze his body and solidify his blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked by the power. His Marquise Jadeskin granted
him the ability to freeze others, so his resistance to the cold
should have been extremely high. But now, he could hardly withstand
a single ounce of the chilling power that the toad had unleashed.
It was difficult to comprehend.</p>
<p>“A very powerful deified creature.” Before Han Sen became
completely frozen, he grabbed the guardian tablet and put it back
on his belt. A cold light gleamed across his body and separated him
from the cold air.</p>
<p>Some of that cold air remained in Han Sen’s body, though. The
guardian tablet’s power was like a shield. It was unable to clear
out the cold air that was already within him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt very cold, and numbness began to creep through his
limbs and into his chest. He quickly used Jadeskin again, refining
the cold air that had invaded his body.</p>
