<p>The shadow of the God Spirit light kept slashing the scary cause
power, but it was unable to bring harm to Han Sen. Many cause
powers came before Han Sen, but they immediately vanished. They
could not cover his body.</p>
<p>“Demon Alpha, do you want this to continue?” Han Sen kept
getting the cause power attack as he spoke to Demon Alpha.</p>
<p>Demon Alpha’s eyes were consistently full of shock. She could
not believe her cause powers were unable to work on Han Sen.</p>
<p>“There is no need.” Demon Alpha looked very calm. The God Spirit
powers on her were weaker. She looked at Han Sen with a complex
look.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me who that God Spirit was now?” Han Sen whispered
to Demon Alpha.</p>
<p>Demon Alpha hesitated. She used a weird skill so that her words
were only able to be heard by Han Sen. “What if I told you that I
do not know who this God Spirit was. Would you believe me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and looked at Demon Alpha. He did not speak. He
did not believe Demon Alpha, but people like Demon Alpha must have
had a reason to say something like that.</p>
<p>Demon Alpha said, “Back in the day, Ancient Devil took eight of
us, the generals, with him to summon a God Spirit. We summoned a
dying God Spirit. Even Ancient Devil does not know who that God
Spirit was. If he did not know, how could we possibly know? Ancient
Devil and the rest of us used all sorts of methods, but we were
unable to do anything to the dying God Spirit.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. The explanation of events given to him by Demon
Alpha, Asura, was the same as the explanation given to him by
Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Demon Alpha bore a wry smile and went on to say, “You must be
curious. If we could not hurt the dying God Spirit, how was I able
to consume it? Well, that is very simple. That is because it was
not that I ate the God Spirit. It was more like he chose me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Demon Alpha with surprise as he asked, “What
is that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“It means what you just heard me tell you. Ancient Devil and the
other generals believed that I ate the God Spirit, but they did not
know he chose to combine with me above the rest.” Demon Alpha saw
Han Sen’s face, knowing what he was thinking. She shook her head
and said, “I know what you are thinking. I am still me. The God
Spirit did not overtake me. The God Spirit was very strong. If he
wanted to take over my will, I would have been unable to stop him.
But he never did. Instead, he gave his powers to me. The power was
so strong that I was only ever to use some of it. As I became
stronger, I became more and more able to use the power. Recently, I
was able to use it perfectly.”</p>
<p>“Aside from this power, do you have anything else?” Han Sen
found all of this hard to believe. Demon Alpha was stretching the
limits of his believability.</p>
<p>Even if the God Spirit was that nice, he didn’t believe a good
God Spirit was that perfect and unselfish to never plan on bringing
harm to Demon Alpha.</p>
<p>He gave his power to Demon Alpha to prolong his life. It was
obvious he just did not want to die, so he must have left behind
some final words.</p>
<p>Han Sen would not believe there was nothing more to it all.</p>
<p>Demon Alpha said, “He left me a message, but his message did not
concern anything to do with himself. It was a secret that had
something to do with Human Alpha.”</p>
<p>Demon Alpha hesitated for a moment but proceeded to say, “You
should know that Qin Xiu was Human Alpha reincarnated. I lost. I
cannot fight him before Qin Xiu controls the geno tablet. I can
tell you this secret. If you can defeat Qin Xiu, it will only be a
good thing for me too.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy. He did not expect Demon Alpha was connected
to all of this. It certainly came as a surprise to him. It made him
really curious too. He did not know what kind of secret this
was.</p>
<p>Demon Alpha was silent a moment before saying to Han Sen,
“According to my message, Human Alpha does not die. Before he
walked that step, there was a small flaw in him. If you can catch
that flaw, it might be possible for you to defeat him.”</p>
<p>Han Sen could not help but ask, “What flaw might that be?”</p>
<p>Demon Alpha’s voice was in Han Sen’s brain. “Human Alpha’s genes
come from a Reboot God Spirit and the last God Chaos Party leader.
The two of their genes did not combine perfectly. If Human Alpha
was forced to combine the geno prototype armor and a Reboot
Blood-Pulse, it will have a flaw. If you can catch the flaw, Qin
Xiu can be delivered deadly damage. But catching that flaw will be
difficult. You will need my cause power for that since this flaw
can only be felt. It cannot be spoken. Without my cause power, you
will not be able to see the flaw. So, this secret is pointless for
you to learn.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing all of this, Han Sen was more and more shocked. It
was not because of the flaws Demon Alpha mentioned. It was because
by knowing this and wanting to deal with Human Alpha, this could
not be Human Alpha reincarnated.</p>
<p>Knowing so much about Human Alpha’s secrets, the God Spirit that
combined with Demon Alpha sounded like the last God Hall
Leader.</p>
<p>“If it was that big god, how was he able to be summoned to a
low-level sanctuary by Ancient Devil?” Han Sen really did not
understand this part.</p>
<p>Demon Alpha said, “I still have a feeling the God Spirit I
combined with was just a shell or fragment of its former self. It
is not the God Spirit in its entirety.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It is just a feeling! The God Spirit is a spirit body. If he
really combined with me, I should be able to get some memory from
his soul, but I can’t.” Demon Alpha smiled. She went on to speak,
but this time, her voice was not directly in Han Sen’s brain.
Everyone was able to hear what she said next. “Our discussion ends
here. I lost. This is where we say goodbye. I hope I will meet you
again one day—alive.”</p>
<p>After that, Demon Alpha left the 33 skies.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! What was that? They did not fight. This was so
fake.”</p>
<p>“I object! This was a fake fight.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Hey! You guys should at least pretend to fight. You did
not even fight. All you did was wave your hands, and then one of
you concedes? That is so unprofessional.”</p>
<p>“Fake! This is so fake! This acting is noob level!”</p>
<p>There were so many boos after this. People thought it was not a
glorious win for Han Sen. Even the races of the geno universe that
adored Han Sen looked weird. They were so perplexed that they could
not speak.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care though. The secrets Demon Alpha told him
gave him a lot to think about, but there was no way to confirm
anything. It was like his heart had been scratched by a cat, and it
was incredibly itchy as a result.</p>
<p>When Demon Alpha quit, Han Sen progressed to the top 16. He
could not, however, leave the 33 skies. He had no choice but to
wait until the next fight.</p>
<p>He had to win that next fight. He had to keep on fighting. There
was no other choice.</p>
