<p>“A powerful skill. A very powerful skill,” Dragon Thirteen
complimented. She looked around, unable to determine where those
knife airs were hiding.</p>
<p>“That is too much of a compliment.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen continued on to say, “Don’t be so happy too
soon. Do you know why the Dragon are called the bravest?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Han Sen had never heard this before.</p>
<p>“You will find out soon enough,” Dragon Thirteen said, and then
she spun her black lance. The lance became even sharper, until it
turned into a light that fired towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Countless strands of knife silk cut into her armor. Cracks
appeared all over her armor, but no blood seeped out.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see that after the knife silk cut through the
armor, her skin still looked crystal-white. There was no evidence
of a single wound. Han Sen was shocked by this.</p>
<p>He gathered up more knife silks. They could break a Marquise
class armor, but they could not break Dragon Thirteen’s skin. She
had a very strong body.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen was like a warrior that was walking boldly over
landmines. The landmines kept exploding, but they didn’t hurt her
body. She approached, completely unstoppable.</p>
<p>Her lancemind was sharp. Dragon Thirteen came right before Han
Sen, with a speed and power that had increased even more. Han Sen
was quite exhausted by this point, and he couldn’t evade her
attack.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s forehead was pierced through, and his body exploded.
Dragon Thirteen only realized then that she had destroyed a simple
clone generated by Moon. Han Sen was already distancing
himself.</p>
<p>Her face did not change, though. Her lance became a line that
attacked Han Sen again.</p>
<p>That attack looked unstoppable, and it was born of bravery. Not
even Han Sen knew what to do against that. So, Han Sen used his
movement to dodge.</p>
<p>But Dragon Thirteen’s lance was getting faster. And due to Han
Sen being bound to the forces of the space, it was even more
difficult to dodge.</p>
<p>If they had both been Marquises, Han Sen would not have been so
afraid of her. But there was a whole tier separating them. There
was a grand gulf of strength between them, as she was undoubtedly
one of the top Marquises.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen got hit, and he was sent shooting through the sky like a
star. He thudded into a stone wall and broke it.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, concede now. If I hit you three inches higher, you’d
have been a dead man,” Dragon Thirteen said grimly, coming over to
the broken wall.</p>
<p>But no answer was received. She frowned. Her face changed. “Oh,
no! The mountain has a crevice. He accepted my hit so he could
escape through it.”</p>
<p>“What an annoying man. Even in a situation such as this, he had
an ulterior scheme.” Sharon shook his head.</p>
<p>“Why are you still talking? Go catch him, and do not let him run
off!” The Marquise white tiger roared, shattering the rocks around
them. The crevice was revealed more clearly, and the white tiger
sprinted went inside.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen and Sharon went in, too. They were going to
catch up with Han Sen, somewhere in the gully.</p>
<p>Han Sen traveled through the tunnel quickly. His chest had a
hole in it, but he was not bleeding. However, some evil power had
entered his wound, and it was permeating his entire body.</p>
<p>“Dragon power is too strong. It is not like Teeth power that
could go on forever, but it is far too concentrated. It is
difficult to push it out of my body. And I can’t stop and take the
time to get rid of it.” Han Sen, clutching his wound, continued
fleeing through the cave.</p>
<p>The cave had many alternate routes. Han Sen had to find a place
in which he could hide and get rid of the powers inflicted by the
lance.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his blood and bones were different than those of an
ordinary being. If they hadn’t been, the lance’s power would have
destroyed him.</p>
<p>He ran through the caverns for a long time. He felt Dragon
Thirteen coming, though, and this confused him.</p>
<p>With the Dongxuan Aura hiding him, she shouldn’t have been able
to find him.</p>
<p>“Is it the lance power inside me?” Han Sen thought, realizing
the problem.</p>
<p>If that power was still inside him, Dragon Thirteen would be
able to track him down. But he currently did not have the time to
get rid of it.</p>
<p>If it was just Dragon Thirteen alone, Han Sen would have been
willing to give it a shot. But, Sharon and the others were
Marquises. It’d be difficult for Han Sen to take them all.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth, and he ran to the silver Ancient God
statue. If he couldn’t shake his pursuers, he thought he might have
better luck by employing the silver glass bug.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew how to get there, and he eventually found his way
to the Ghost Face Spider statue. Then, he went behind it and down
and through another cave.</p>
<p>Not long after, Dragon Thirteen, with Sharon and the others,
arrived at the Ghost Face Spider cave. They saw the sheep-headed
Ancient God statue.</p>
<p>“There is an Ancient God statue, but it looks like someone has
already claimed it,” Sharon said, while looking at the Ancient God
statue.</p>
<p>“Han Sen ran into the Ancient God statue? The Beginning of
Ancient God should be on him. If we had known this sooner, we could
have just gone and killed him. There’d have been no need for all
this trouble.” The White Tiger Marquise wanted to try. He headed
toward the statue.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen looked at the cave behind the statue and coldly
said, “Han Sen is not inside the statue. He went behind.”</p>
<p>“Then keep up the chase. The Beginning of Ancient God is on
him,” Sharon said.</p>
<p>“It is lucky that you left the lance power on him. Otherwise,
we’d have been thoroughly fooled. And if we had taken the time to
search the statue, he’d have been long gone,” the White Tiger
Marquise said happily.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen brought them to the cave behind the statue and
continued chasing Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept running, but he was unable to find the strange
silver bug. He came to that same waterfall as before, but still, he
could not find it.</p>
<p>Before he could think of what to do next, he felt Dragon
Thirteen drawing near. He gritted his teeth and fled into the
statue. The entrance was in the statue’s belly button.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only been in there for a minute when Dragon Thirteen
reached the statue.</p>
<p>“Hey, there is another Ancient God statue! But this one looks
different. Is Han Sen here?” The White Tiger Marquise was looking
at the silver Ancient God statue.</p>
<p>“He is inside the statue,” Dragon Thirteen said confidently.</p>
<p>“How about this? Thirteen and I chase him down, while you guys
wait out here in case he runs back out?” Sharon spoke to White
Tiger Marquise and the others.</p>
<p>The White Tiger Marquise nodded. Sharon and Dragon Thirteen
entered the waterfall and chased after Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was starting to feel pain radiating throughout his body.
The lance power was like a snake, slithering inside him. If he
didn’t flush it out soon, his organs would start to break.</p>
