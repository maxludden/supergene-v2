<p>I wonder if the method to kill a god is useful with God’s Knife.
Han Sen’s heart jumped. He summoned Sky Vine Radish and threw a
punch toward God’s Knife.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>God’s Knife was not damaged, but the blood flame demon was hit
by Sky Vine Radish. The flames of its composure went
everywhere.</p>
<p>It really works! Is that thing a god too? Han Sen was
delighted.</p>
<p>Sky Vine Radish was strong. It kept punching the blood flame
demon. It made the blood flame demon shatter and shimmer
everywhere. It was unable to fight back.</p>
<p>God’s Knife was already falling back. Now, Sky Vine Radish was
attacking it. The bloody fires of the knife were becoming weaker.
In the end, the bloody flame was broken by Sky Vine Radish. God’s
Knife turned dim as if it had lost all control.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew in front of the God’s Knife, picked it up off the
ground, and discovered that God’s Knife was nothing more than an
ordinary sharp knife without its power.</p>
<p>Both of his hands held a separate side of the sharp knife. He
wanted to break the knife, but he was unable to achieve what he
wanted. The knife was still as hard as before. It just did not have
a lively presence inside it anymore.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, I didn’t hear the hunting announcement. Perhaps
that means I didn’t kill it. He put God’s Knife inside Destiny’s
Tower and kept it suppressed.</p>
<p>“Wan’er, follow me. I am going to take you to see Lone Bamboo,”
Han Sen said as he approached Wan’er.</p>
<p>“Do you know my brother?” Wan’er was happy, but then she looked
sad and shook her head. “You should leave now. I cannot come with
you.”</p>
<p>“God’s Knife has already been suppressed by me. What more do you
need to concern yourself with?” Han Sen saw in Wan’er’s face that
she was hiding something.</p>
<p>“I signed a contract with a god. I cannot leave here. If I do, I
will end up causing my big brother harm.” Wan’er shook her
head.</p>
<p>“What contract?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Wan’er shook her head and said, “I cannot tell you. If I tell
you, big brother will be in danger.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew he could not blame Wan’er for thinking that way. If
he was in her position, he would feel as if this was a trick too.
Before being 100% sure, he would never try to do something that
could put his family at risk.</p>
<p>“I will not force you to come with me, but God’s Knife has been
suppressed by me. Will the god be OK with that?” Han Sen looked at
Wan’er as he spoke.</p>
<p>Wan’er nibbled her lips but did not say anything. She was
unsure.</p>
<p>“How about this?” Han Sen went on to say, “Tell me where that
god is, and I will go out and look for it. I will see if there is a
way for me to kill it.”</p>
<p>If the god Wan’er had signed a contract with was the same as
Evil Lotus God, perhaps there was a chance for Han Sen to kill it.
If he did that, Wan’er would be free again.</p>
<p>Wan’er still shook her head and said, "You should go. A god is
not something we can deal with. He is so powerful, and he is
everywhere.</p>
<p>“But I did manage to suppress the God’s Knife. Suppressing a god
is not something impossible.” Han Sen tried to convince her.</p>
<p>“This is different. The God’s Knife is just a knife. It’s one of
God’s toys. How can it compare with the god itself? The power of a
god is not something we can feasibly comprehend.” After that,
Wan’er’s small face had a frightening expression. It was as if she
was in the recollection of something terrible.</p>
<p>“How can you know it won’t work if you haven’t given it a go? If
your big brother Lone Bamboo knew you were here, I am sure he would
want to see you again.” Han Sen hoped to use Lone Bamboo to change
her mind.</p>
<p>Wan’er looked hesitant, but then confidently shook her head.
“Thanks a lot, but please do not tell big brother about me. You
should leave now. The God’s Knife has been affected, and I am sure
the god must have felt it. When he comes, it will be too late for
you to escape.”</p>
<p>“It is already too late…” Wan’er’s last sentence was spoken a
different tone of voice. She was like a different person.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face changed. He saw Wan’er’s body start to morph with
a blurry god light. It was like her entire body was being showered
in the morning light. Her eyes became weirdly clear. She appeared
to become an emotionless machine.</p>
<p>“You have broken into my farm and destroyed my knife spirit. You
are a very interesting person.” Wan’er looked at Han Sen with
interest as she spoke. Her face was like a king in a high place,
looking down on a clown’s performance at the circus.</p>
<p>Han Sen coldly looked at Wan’er and asked, “Are you the
god?”</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly realized something, but he did not know what it
was.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am God.” Wan’er smiled and nodded. She stared at Han Sen
and asked, “What is your name? What race do you belong to?”</p>
<p>“I am Dollar. I am a human,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>Wan’er shook her head and said, “You are not a human. Humans
don’t look like you. You are a xenogeneic.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped with shock. Pretty much no creature in
the universe knew about humans, but this so-called God seemed to
know about the existence of humanity. It also knew that he was not
a human. This was a problem.</p>
<p>“How do you know I am not a human?” Han Sen quickly asked.</p>
<p>“If I think you are not a human, then you are not a human,”
Wan’er replied. “There is no why.”</p>
<p>“What is your name?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I am God,” Wan’er answered.</p>
<p>“Don’t gods have a title? Something like Empty God? Sky Empty
God and etcetera? What is your title?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You know a lot. It is no wonder you were able to destroy the
spirit of my knife.” It laughed and said, “But I do not have a
title. You can just call me God.”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen said anything more, God went on to say, “You
destroyed my knife spirit, and I am OK with that. If you want to
take away Wan’er, you can do that too. But this world is a fair
place. You are taking so much, so you should give something back in
the interest of fairness, of course. Wouldn’t you agree?”</p>
<p>“No. That was something I achieved through my own power. Why
should I give out anything?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>God was shocked, but it then laughed. “Well said. Something you
take through your own power means you shouldn’t give out anything.
I really like you. How about this? It is rare to find an
interesting xenogeneic like you. I am giving you a chance now. So,
let’s have a bet. If you can beat me, you can leave without any
harm and Wan’er can go with you.”</p>
<p>“What if I lose?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“If you lose, you are so funny that I wouldn’t want to see you
die.” God went silent. It went on to say, “You can replace Wan’er’s
job here. You can feed God’s Knife for the next century.”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair,” Han Sen said with a smile. “If I win, you do
not have to give anything. If I lose, I have to give you a hundred
years of my time. Why would I take part in such an unfair
gamble?”</p>
<p>“Because that is a bet that involves my own power,” God said
with a smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to say there was nothing he could to him if he
didn’t do anything. Before he said anything, he shockingly noticed
that within God’s stare, his hands were not listening to him. He
held his neck and squeezed. He squeezed himself so hard that he was
going to suffocate. With Han Sen’s will and power, he was unable to
control his own body.</p>
<p>Inside the Sea of Soul, the black crystal armor reduced its
presence. It pretended it did not exist. There was no reaction.</p>
