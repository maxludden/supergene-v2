    <p>
      Han Sen touched his forehead and felt nothing. It was smooth and free from
      wrinkles, like usual.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Zhou Yumei&#8217;s face did not look like she was telling him a lie.
      Han Sen pulled out a mirror from his pack—the one that was used for the
      Beetle Knight—and had a look.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face dropped. On his forehead, between his eyebrows, there
      was a single red dot. He tried to rub it away, but it was as if it had
      been branded. No matter how much he scrubbed, it wouldn&#8217;t go away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took a closer look. The red dot was on the surface of his skin,
      but it was as stubborn as if it was embedded within. Removing it anytime
      soon didn&#8217;t seem likely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quickly, Han Sen ran his Dongxuan Sutra to see if there was anything wrong
      with his body. To his relief, there were no problems and everything seemed
      to be normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hmm, then what is this exactly?&#8221; Han Sen then thought about
      the spirit that had stepped from beyond that metal door and the things it
      had said. As soon as his mind reflected upon those events, an uneasy
      feeling began to swell.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he wasn&#8217;t too worried yet. The spirit could have killed him if
      it wanted to, so it was clear he wasn&#8217;t on the chopping block yet.
      But it upset Han Sen to know that he had received a seemingly permanent
      mark upon his forehead.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I am guessing this correctly, that spirit must have come from
      the Third Shelter. The holy rhino must have been taken there. But why
      would he stop to place a mark on me?&#8221; Han Sen frowned, unable to
      figure out what had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, Han Sen wanted to be gone from the Black Desert once and for
      all. He was burning with inquisitiveness, so he wanted to return to
      civilization and get to asking about the Third Shelter. He wouldn&#8217;t
      be able to learn a single thing from his current location.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had not previously been in a hurry to learn about the Third
      Shelter since he had no immediate connection to the place, and it would be
      a while before he went there. But now things were different. A scorching
      desire had taken root in his heart; he wanted to know what the secretive
      Third Shelter looked like.
    </p>

    <p>
      For miles around him, as far as his eyes could see, there was only a
      sweltering desert. There was not a single shelter to be found. He
      couldn&#8217;t do anything from where he was right now, so all he could do
      was stick to what he had been doing so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      Half a day, later the fairy caught up with them and flew around Han Sen
      with a look of excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      He didn&#8217;t pay her much heed, however. He remained seated on the
      Golden Roarer and played with the rhino&#8217;s crystallized tear. He cast
      his Dongxuan Sutra to see if he could absorb it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Dongxuan Sutra did not work as expected, despite his simulation of
      the rhino&#8217;s energy flow. There was a different reaction. The tear in
      his hand melted into a holy water of sorts, which soaked into his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      As curious as this was, he did not receive a geno increase announcement.
      This disappointed him. But the tear was like a holy light that cleansed
      his every cell. His skin began to peel, as dirt rose to the surface and
      was thrown away.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this process began, Han Sen could peel large films of his skin away.
      It was as if he was shedding, and every time he removed some of his old,
      now-dead skin, more dirt would appear and be cleansed away. After doing
      this four times, his body was put at great ease and a comfort he never
      knew existed. Now he felt as if he had previously suffered a flu and a
      wretchedly stuffed nose to go along with it. But now, he had fully healed.
      His nose was clear, and he could breathe unlike ever before.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This really is some good stuff.&#8221; Han Sen was surprised,
      feeling as if his body had just been reborn. The tear&#8217;s
      effectiveness was incredible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was the tear that fell from the rhino&#8217;s eyes while it was
      evolving. It possessed a nirvanic power, and through this energy he had
      absorbed from the rhino&#8217;s teardrop, he felt reborn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if he took the fruit of the cactus and ate it, he thought the tear he
      had received was a far greater item.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although this Holy Tear of Nirvana did not increase Han Sen&#8217;s gene
      number, it strengthened them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quality of genes always exceeded the quantity. His existential tier
      might not have risen, but such a task was something that would take a long
      time to do. It was something Han Sen was prepared for, anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s dirt and old skin continued to peel, and his body
      performed this cycle ten times before stopping.
    </p>

    <p>
      This did not take place over the course of one day, however. But after he
      was finished, his body was heavy. Everything in his vision blurred, and
      his prior ease of breathing became a struggle. He felt as if the
      atmosphere had been consumed by smog or dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised. It felt like when he became an evolver, and he was
      staying in the First Shelter. It was that sort of feeling, but not quite
      as strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Luckily, my body hasn&#8217;t evolved enough to be excluded from
      the Second Shelter. If it did, that would be terrible. If I was excluded,
      I would have to become a surpasser before reaching the Third
      Shelter.&#8221; Han Sen sighed, and then continued to think,
      &#8220;Sometimes, I cannot just randomly eat whatever I desire. This tear
      is far beyond what I expected. It is too powerful. It exceeds what is
      normally offered by super creatures.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Although his fitness did not increase, his first gene lock was blown wide
      open. And that came as a shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he hadn&#8217;t reached a fitness of three hundred and become a
      Celestial Being, he could already unleash his true power. This made him
      exuberantly happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a shame Zhou Yumei was with him, because he fancied giving his new
      powers a spin.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good men always receive good rewards.&#8221; Han Sen could not stop
      repeating this phrase to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If others knew what he was thinking, he&#8217;d be viewed with disdain.
      The truth was, he had never done nor thought of performing a good deed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued riding through the sweltering badlands of the Black
      Desert in boredom. Seeking to occupy his mind, he decided to research the
      white rhino&#8217;s energy flow a bit more. The rhino was incredibly
      strong, so its energy flow couldn&#8217;t have been that bad. Therefore,
      Han Sen wanted to try it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then found out that the holy light did not lend itself to any act
      of aggression. The holy light could heal wounds and provide impressive
      remedial effects, but it couldn&#8217;t be used for attacks. Small wounds
      could be immediately healed by the light, but the overall, future
      effectiveness would depend on the individual&#8217;s level.
    </p>

    <p>
      He didn&#8217;t have enough fitness right now, and his energy was nowhere
      near as impressive as the rhino&#8217;s. As such, any holy light he
      simulated would not be as strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, this satisfied Han Sen. Living in this world was unpredictable, and
      things could change in a heartbeat. If there was ever a crisis, and
      medical aid was needed but could not be found, this skill would prove
      incredibly valuable.
    </p>

    <p>
      After walking for a dozen days, his eyes met with the sight of the Gobi
      Desert and a nearby mountain. This made Han Sen and Zhou Yumei incredibly
      happy, for they had now, at long last, exited the Black Desert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickened their pace in desire for a shelter. He wanted to return
      to the Alliance and find out all he could about the Third Shelter.
