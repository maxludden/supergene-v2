  Thousand Mile Reach knew Han Sen was not an ordinary person. After all, he had been able to kill Steel Scene in Ice Snow God Temple. There was no doubt that Han Sen was a god-blood noble, and his Blood-Pulse and gene race was stronger than Steel Scene.

What did that matter? The grand teacher of the Qin Kingdom was the strongest elite around. He was far greater than Steel Scene. He would not have been allowed to be the king’s teacher had that not been the case.

Thousand Mile Reach always wanted to be a king’s teacher like Jian Bu Gu. He wanted to raise the king to become a great king. He had achieved so much for the kingdom.

Thus far, Thousand Mile Reach had been stuck teaching Qin Bai. He had not achieved much out of his efforts. As for potential awards, he had earned even less.

Back in the day, Jian Bu Gu had taught King Jing Zhen. Compared to Wu Wei Dao Palace, one could say he had the name of a teacher but did not achieve much.

Thousand Mile Reach always held Jian Bu Gu as somewhat of a role model. No matter what, he wanted to teach Qin Bai to become a good person. He wanted him to develop into a good king who was at least as good as King Jing Zhen.

Thousand Mile Reach looked at Han Sen and asked, “Are you Han Sen?”

“Yeah.” Han Sen sat where he was. He did not stand up.

Thousand Mile Reach frowned. He was very noble. Even the king referred to him as a mister. Now, Han Sen remained where he was while speaking to him. He thought the man was very rude.

Thousand Mile Reach looked at the game of chess on the table. He sat opposite Han Sen and coldly asked, “Do you mind having a game with me?”

Han Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach and asked, “Do you know how to play checkers?”

The Qin Kingdom did not have games like checkers. This was actually a chessboard. Han Sen had used his strength on the stone table. He had squeezed a stone and turned it into an orb to make the chess pieces. He had convinced Qin Bai to play.

While he was in the Alliance at home, Han Sen always played the game with his Little Ling’er or Bao’er. Han Sen was very good when it came to formations, so he could play all kinds of chess games.

Even in checkers, only Bao’er was able to rival him. Not many people won against him.

Thousand Mile Reach frowned. Han Sen did not even ask for his name. He was being very rude, but Thousand Mile Reach was not in the mood to address the subject. He coldly said, “It is very simple. To the deepest parts, there are different routes to take. I saw the crown prince and you playing chess. I know the rules.”

“If you are interested, then I would like to play with you.” Han Sen ignored Qin Bai and coldly laughed. Qin Bai was in a rush. He looked into Han Sen’s eyes. Thousand Mile Reach was good at chess. He was so famous that even the king called him the King of Chess.

If Han Sen played chess against his teacher, Qin Bai was not worried he might lose. If he did lose, he might have to agree to something with Thousand Mile Reach.

The situation surprised Qin Bai. Thousand Mile Reach did not establish any conditions. He only set up the chessboard and started playing with Han Sen.

Thousand Mile Reach thought he was very good at chess. His chess skills were pretty good, but he did not plan on using chess skills to convince Han Sen.

“Please, Mister,” Thousand Mile Reach coldly said.

Han Sen did not mind. He picked up a stone orb and made his first move.

When it was Thousand Mile Reach’s turn, he used his finger to pick up a stone orb. He slowly went to the chessboard.

Dong! When the stone orb was put down, it was like there was an invisible power in the center of the orb. It suddenly spread and twisted the space around it.

Han Sen was sitting in front of the stone board. He suddenly felt the dimension become distorted. For some reason, he found himself standing atop a chessboard.

The chessboard was the one he had created on the table. Now, it was massive. The stone orb was bigger than a person. He was standing where the stone orb was.

On the opposite end of the chessboard, Thousand Mile Reach was where he had put the stone orb down. Aside from the chessboard and the two of them, the environment around was shrouded by a black mist. It was like the chessboard world resided in an abyss.

Han Sen did not move. He looked at Thousand Mile Reach as he said, “That was a good move, Mister.”

Thousand Mile Reach was like a god floating above the chessboard. He was looking down on Han Sen from up high and said, “The chess path is a sky path. Playing chess is a gamble in life. I have a Disaster class chess God Spirit Blood-Pulse. I have an ultimate chess element gene race. If you can survive the world power of this chess match, I can permit the crown prince to stay with you.”

While he spoke, Thousand Mile Reach pointed at Han Sen. A giant chess piece arose from his back. It was like an asteroid headed for Han Sen.

Han Sen’s body exploded with purple dragon air. At the same time, there was a weird purple scale on his body. It was growing. It activated the blood dragon God Spirit Blood – Pulse and blood god dragon power.

Boom!

Han Sen unleashed a punch that carried blood dragon flying into the weird scene. The roaring big, purple dragon struck the stone orb. A purple air explosion occurred. Dust was everywhere. Under the effect of powerful tremors, Han Sen lost control and stumbled back. His arms were numb. He had been truly shaken.

Thousand Mile Reach coldly said, “Destroyed class God Spirit Blood-Pulse combined with a rare exclusive god-class gene race… It is only a shame that it is juvenile. If it reaches ultimate mode, perhaps it would have lasted longer.” Han Sen thought, “Does a teacher have this much power? This universe of kingdoms has a lot of hidden elites. That was just a Disaster class God Spirit Blood-Pulse combined with a god-class gene race? If there was an Annihilation class or Reboot class God Spirit combining with an ultimate mode gene race, how strong would it be? Does the Qin Kingdom have such people in its midst?”

Han Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach ahead of him. He was a bit hesitant. He only depended on his gene race and God Spirit Blood-Pulse power. His power was far inferior to Thousand Mile Reach.

If he was forced to break the rules of the world to beat him, it would shock many scary elites in Jade Wall City. Even the God Spirits would come.

Although many God Spirits had revealed their fear of him, God Spirits’ attitudes were still mysterious. They never explained why they behaved the way they did. Han Sen did not believe the reasons were anything simple. If he shocked a high-class God Spirit, it probably would have ended up being a bad thing for him.

Plus, breaking the rules of the world always cost him too much strength. He could never really last long in such a battle. He might not have been able to fight against the attacks of all the elites in the Qin Kingdom.

“If I cannot win by force, I must rely on my intelligence.” Han Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach. He looked serious.

“You still won’t concede.” When Thousand Mile Reach said that with his godly voice, he raised his hands. Every stone orb chess piece arose from the stone board. They looked like giant bombs hovering in the air. They used all kinds of strange flighting paths to strike Han Sen.
