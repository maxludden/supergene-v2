<p>The body of the Blood God Mantis was only a tenth of the size of
the plant it was munching. It ate slowly, but when it ate a bit of
the coral, its belly did not swell. Its body did glow strangely,
however.</p>
<p>Before it finished eating the red coral, another aspect of its
body changed. The shadow of a red reaper appeared on it. Its hands
held a scythe, like a tool to harvest souls.</p>
<p>The mist on the shadow was getting stronger, and it looked as if
it was set to become solid.</p>
<p>“It’s evolving. Will it become a Marquise or a mutant?” Han Sen
asked as he looked upon the Blood God Mantis.</p>
<p>“Spirits are just substances formed of light, smoke, and air.
They aren’t really solid. When they become Marquise, they won’t
grow any more solid than they were originally. They will only gain
power. Look at the Red God Mantis. It’s not becoming a Marquise;
it’s mutating,” Yun Suyi said.</p>
<p>“It is good to be a mutant. I love mutants.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>The Blood God Mantis’ red smoke was getting heavier. The red
smoke reaper could be seen clearly now. At this point, it was hard
to distinguish from an actual creature.</p>
<p>The next second, Han Sen saw the red reaper wave its scythe
towards the red coral. It broke the rest of the red coral, and then
the red smoke on its body became a vortex. It sucked all the
scattered pieces into it.</p>
<p>When the red coral entered the whirl, the red reaper’s smoke
became thicker. That was particularly true of the scythe in its
hands. Its smoke form began to solidify, and before long, it had
turned into a crystal blade.</p>
<p>The Blood God Mantis’ body was shining. The light glowed through
the red reaper.</p>
<p>Han Sen was staring into Blood God Mantis’ body, focusing on the
blood air that swirled inside.</p>
<p>“It is going to finish mutating. Now is the best chance,” Yun
Suyi said.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush; let’s keep watching.” Han Sen wanted to see
what the Blood God Mantis’ geno art might be. He wanted to see how
strong it was.</p>
<p>After two hours, the Blood God Mantis finished the mutation
process. The red reaper became smoke, then drew back into its body.
It vanished from sight.</p>
<p>Blood God Mantis’ body did not grow large from ingesting the
coral. It was still one foot long, and its body still looked like
ruby.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, it flapped its wings and squealed. It
suddenly came for Han Sen, fast as a red shadow.</p>
<p>Perhaps it had noticed Han Sen and Yun Suyi a while ago. It
might have refrained from attacking then due to the fact that it
was undergoing the evolution process. Once it was done, it now
fancied killing them.</p>
<p>“Spell,” Han Sen said quietly. Then, Spell appeared before him
in her ladylike form. She wielded two pistols, and she fired at the
Blood God Mantis with both.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>Two bullets hit the Blood God Mantis, but they didn’t break its
shell. They only left two spell markings on it.</p>
<p>Blood God Mantis squealed with anger. Its body turned into a red
shadow, and it leaped at Spell. The arms of the Mantis swung like
scythes, and they were going to cut her.</p>
<p>Spell moved quickly, evading Blood God Mantis’ attack. She held
her hands together and summoned a rocket launcher. Then, she fired
a shot at the Blood God Mantis.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He didn’t know why Spell was using a rocket
launcher right now. The rocket launcher was stronger than the
pistols, yes, but it was too slow. With the speed of the Blood God
Mantis, the creature could easily dodge.</p>
<p>And yes, Blood God Mantis did indeed flap its wings to dodge
upwards. It got well clear of the rocket. It then resumed its
approach to Spell.</p>
<p>Spell retreated, still clutching the rocket launcher. The Blood
God Mantis continued to advance, but the rocket that had gone by
suddenly swung around like a heat-seeking missile. It hit the
mantis in the back.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There was an explosion, and Blood God Mantis’ body was sent
flying away. Its shell was covered in a number of small wounds. The
rocket must have damaged its shell when it detonated.</p>
<p>But those wounds were nothing to the mantis. They only made it
angry. It squealed, then jumped back at Spell.</p>
<p>“Damn! The round that leaves a mark can track an enemy’s
movement. It alters the course of the rocket. I wonder if the
bullets can have a similar function?” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>Swiftly, Han Sen’s question was answered. Spell turned the
rocket launcher into a pair of pistols again. Her legs were crossed
as she dodged Blood God Mantis’ attack. It was like she was
performing a beautiful and elegant dance.</p>
<p>In that elegant dance, Spell’s pistols fired continuously. It
did not look like she was aiming at the Blood God Mantis, but the
bullets drew a curve in the sky. And then, they all landed on the
mantis. The rounds did not miss a single mark across the mantis’
body.</p>
<p>“So the pistol bullets can track too, huh?” Han Sen was so
happy.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi looked at the scene strangely. Spell was just a geno
armament, yet she was capable of fighting a mutant Earl without any
directions from her master. Normal geno armaments were not capable
of something like that. In fact, most Earl geno armaments could not
fight at all. They didn’t have a will of their own. They did not
have intelligence like Spell did.</p>
<p>The pistols were a little weak. They hit the same spots on Blood
God Mantis, but they failed to heavily damage it.</p>
<p>Blood God Mantis tried to attack Spell, but it failed. After
Spell drew some distance between the two, she summoned her sniper
rifle. She wanted to get rough. But before Spell could fire the
sniper rifle, a strange red smoke suddenly appeared behind her
back. A crystal scythe was sweeping down towards her neck.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his mind to make Spell quickly dodge, but it was
too late. The crystal scythe slashed across her back. Her white
armor was cut into by an inch, and it sliced open the muscles in
her back deep enough to reveal bone.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Spell was not a living creature. She had no blood
to lose.</p>
<p>After Spell was attacked, she moved forward. The Blood God
Mantis screamed, and it jumped forward. The red reaper followed her
from behind, and they attacked her together.</p>
<p>“Now that the Blood God Mantis has mutated, it can create a
spirit that works like a fellow xenogeneic? This is similar to a
summon skill,” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi, seeing Spell in danger, quickly said, “What do we do
now?”</p>
<p>“Kill it,” Han Sen said coldly. He had already drawn Ghost Teeth
Knife from his waist.</p>
