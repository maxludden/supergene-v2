<p>Han Sen kept practicing Jadeskin and recovering after he returned home. Every two days he went to God’s Sanctuary to check on the copper-toothed beast.</p>

<p>It took the beast half a month from the time it swallowed the black crystal to become a mutant creature, but it was still the size of an ordinary copper-toothed beast, while the mutant copper-toothed beasts Han Sen had seen were twice that size. In addition to the size, the one he evolved into wasn’t much stronger either, not even close to a true mutant one.</p>

<p>Han Sen took out his alloy dagger and slashed the beast on the neck, but caused no damage at all. It was his dagger that chipped.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is somewhat different from an ordinary one.&#8221; Han Sen shapeshifted into a bloody slayer and snapped its neck by force.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Mutant Copper-Toothed Beast Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Eat Its Flesh To Gain Zero To Ten Mutant Geno Points.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sound in his mind overjoyed Han Sen. It might look different than a wild mutant copper-toothed beast, but it was fine as long as it was indeed a mutant creature.</p>

<p>Now what was troubling him was how to sell this mutant copper-toothed beast. He really needed the money, or else he could just eat it to gain mutant geno points.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too dangerous for me to sell it showing up as Dollar, now that the entire shelter is looking for him. But it would also be troublesome if I were to sell it using my own true identity.&#8221; Han Sen still decided to use Dollar’s name after some hesitation.</p>

<p>Su Xiaoqiao was depressed these days. Qin Xuan asked him to find Dollar, but he didn’t know Dollar any more than she did, so what was he supposed to do?</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Su Xiaoqiao was tripped by something and fell flat on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the motherfucker that placed a stone in front of my room? He’s dead if I find out.&#8221; Even more depressed than before, Xiaoqiao saw that there was something under the stone.</p>

<p>He took a closer look and found a note and a bundle. The note said, &#8220;Goods worth fifty thousand delivered. We are square. If you want more, come to Zephyr Valley tomorrow. Cash only.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although there was no signature, a coin was drawn at the lower left corner, making clear who it was from.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollar!&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao was thrilled but didn’t make a sound this time. Looking around and seeing no one, he took the bundle and note and closed the door.</p>

<p>Su Xiaoqiao carefully opened the bundle and saw a long strip of meat jerky the size of two or three bites.</p>

<p>Su Xiaoqiao chewed up the meat jerky and swallowed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Mutant Copper-Toothed Beast Flesh Eaten. One Mutant Geno Point Gained.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The voice in his mind surprised Xiaoqiao, &#8220;Mutant copper-toothed beast flesh! So it was hunted by Dollar? He must have more now that he asked me to bring cash to Zephyr Valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thinking of this, he got even more excited that he could bring Qin Xuan’s message to Dollar and buy mutant flesh from him at the same time.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Su Xiaoqiao set off to Zephyr Valley. He waited from early morning to noon but didn’t see Dollar coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shit, he must have fooled me!&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao was so upset that he was preparing to leave, but then heard someone say, &#8220;You brought cash?&#8221;</p>

<p>Shocked, Su Xiaoqiao turned around and saw Dollar in golden armor emerging from below the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother, did you hide there all morning?&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao said, staring at Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hiding here since last night. You know what’s going on right now, and I have to be careful,&#8221; Han Sen said casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;I admire you Dollar, but you really have nothing to worry about. I’m so grateful you would sell me mutant flesh and would never betray you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Su Xiaoqiao gave Han Sen the thumbs-up. It was incredible that he could stay underground for the whole night and the entire morning. It must have been so uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut the crap. Did you bring the money?&#8221; Han Sen pulled out another bundle from the pit where he was hiding and placed it in front of Xiaoqiao.</p>

<p>Su Xiaoqiao looked inside the bundle, which was full of the same meat jerky he had eaten yesterday. There must have been more than five pounds of it. He excitedly asked, &#8220;Dollar, did you make all this from the mutant copper-toothed beast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. An entire mutant copper-toothed beast is right here. Two million, and no bargaining,&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, two million is fine.&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao handed two stacks of ten-thousand notes to Han Sen, but doubted whether the entire beast was really there, as there should have been more meat.</p>

<p>Han Sen noticed his doubt, took the money and said, &#8220;This meat jerky is made in traditional ways, so it shrank a bit. Rest assured that the whole beast is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen made the copper-toothed beast into meat jerky so that no one would wonder why the beast was so tiny..</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I trust you!&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao paused and said, &#8220;Dollar, you should know that I work for Qin Xuan. She has a message for you: she wants to buy the sacred-blood beast soul and golden axe you gained the other day, and she could offer you a good price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what is the price?&#8221; Han Sen was interested in selling the golden axe, as it was not that portable. He hadn’t found a chance to use it, so it was still buried.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to figure this out yourselves. I’m just the messenger,&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao shrugged and said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you meet with Qin Xuan, tell her if she really wants to buy it, she can name a price and you can bring it to me,&#8221; Han Sen said lightly. It was too risky for her to meet Qin Xuan.</p>
