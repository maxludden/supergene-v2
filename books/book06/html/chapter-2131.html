<h2>The Dismantling Fight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2131</h3>

<p>The finger was like a meteor, shooting across the space before
the coin. Just as Evil Eye had done previously, Han Sen was
dismantling the coin and reassembling it as something new.</p>
<p>Evil Eye was surprised to see that Han Sen had managed to reduce
his modified version of Dollar to dust, and the shock of the scene
had frozen the spectators.</p>
<p>“No way! Dollar has that sort of power?”</p>
<p>“Really? Evil Eye does something unbelievable, and now Dollar
can match him?”</p>
<p>“This bout just got interesting again…”</p>
<p>Things were happening too quickly for the audience to keep up
with. They stared in disbelief as Han Sen dismantled the geno art
in moments, then began repurposing it to better fit his needs.</p>
<p>All of Han Sen’s fingers moved quickly, and the bits of
shattered coin slowed smoothly back together. It became a new
coin.</p>
<p>But the coin Han Sen was putting together looked different from
the one that Evil Eye had assembled. It looked like gold, and all
traces of the purple engravings that decorated the coin before were
gone. And furthermore, the number displayed atop the surface was
three instead of one.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen finished the coin and fired it at Evil Eye with a fierce
flick of his fingers. A gold light shot towards Evil Eye at an
incredible speed.</p>
<p>Evil Eye frowned and moved to grab the coin, but when he touched
the coin this time, his body was pushed back. And then, every step
he took left behind a deep, cratered footstep. The sand all around
him was sinking.</p>
<p>Evil Eye grabbed the coin, stumbling back four steps. Four steps
and he came to a stop.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! Dollar actually did it. The coin has gotten
stronger. It’s now clear that this is precisely how the two will
fight.”</p>
<p>“I have learned so much today already. Wow. Those two can play
like this?”</p>
<p>“This Geno Being Scroll fight might very well be the most famous
in all of Marquise history.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but what geno art are they practicing? I am afraid this is
something only a deified elite could do.”</p>
<p>“And it would still depend on whether or not the deified elite
had the natural talent to use this particular art. If they didn’t,
not even those sorts could play as those two are right now.”</p>
<p>“Why is the way that they fight so different from the way we
do?”</p>
<p>“This is a fight between true elites. These don’t dictate
superiority through the simple swinging of fists.”</p>
<p>Evil Eye caught the coin in his hand. His gauntlet was dented
heavily by the impact, and holding the coin was not as easy as it
had been. Evil Eye did not speak flippantly anymore, either. He
made the coin hover over his fingers and imbued it with an
abundance of purple light. Eventually, the coin broke.</p>
<p>After the coin was dismantled and rebuilt, the number upon the
surface of the coin had increased to the level of 4. Pang!</p>
<p>Evil Eye threw the coin at Han Sen, and Han Sen immediately
grabbed it when it came within range. He didn’t fall back like his
opponent had, though. He snatched the coin out of the air as if
there was nothing damaging about it at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen was using his ability to see sequence structures to
dismantle the coin, but Evil Eye was using a very different method.
Evil Eye relied on his ability to feel and control powers with
extreme precision.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to see right into Evil Eye’s nature, and he
realized that the two of them were actually completely different
from each other. Evil Eye was able to break down Dollar’s power by
dismantling the coin with amazing, albeit primal practicality. That
was also how he was able to reconstruct the coin.</p>
<p>Evil Eye had been reborn as many different races. In his times
occupying the bodies of the different races, he had frequently
become deified. The power he had learned, and what he now employed,
was quite scary. That was why he was able to use his own knowledge
to dismantle, recreate, and modify Dollar.</p>
<p>His power was entirely dependent on a deified’s knowledge,
though. Marquises should not have been able to understand things on
such a deep level. This was all due to Evil Eye’s continual cycle
of rebirth. His mind-blowing abilities all boiled down to that.</p>
<p>While that cycle of reincarnation had given Evil Eye incredible
power, Han Sen saw the downside that everyone was ignoring.</p>
<p>After all, Evil Eye could not see into the sequence structure
properly. He only used his knowledge and his feelings to rebuild
Dollar. While Evil Eye could still blindly assemble sequence
structures that were mostly functional, his creations lacked detail
and finesse.</p>
<p>If Han Sen’s technique of rebuilding geno arts was 100%
accurate, then Evil Eye was only 99.99%. While the difference might
have been small and difficult to recognize, it was definitely
there. And that meant Evil Eye was not perfect.</p>
<p>Evil Eye would soon find it impossible to beat Han Sen in this
way, but Han Sen didn’t mind engaging him in this sort of battle.
As a matter of fact, it made him happy.</p>
<p>Evil Eye was unable to beat Han Sen without a genuine ability to
read sequence structures. So, to compensate, he found himself
having to add his own power into the coin every time he rebuilt it.
He used his deified power to increase the coin’s potential.</p>
<p>That meant there was a deified elite modifying Dollar for Han
Sen. It made him even happier to go along with it.</p>
<p>The two of them kept throwing the coin back and forth. With each
throw, the number displayed by the coin increased. And every time
the figure increased, the power of each throw visibly increased as
well. Every time Evil Eye caught the coin, the ground beneath his
feet would shake.</p>
<p>Han Sen, on the other hand, could catch the coin with alarming
ease. He was not being affected by the coin at all.</p>
<p>That was why Han Sen said that Evil Eye had missed the purpose
of Dollar. Although his opponent had managed to rebuild Dollar, it
lacked a manifestation of Dollar’s true heart. Evil Eye could use
Dollar to throw attacks, yes, but he could not use the coins as
well as he might have liked.</p>
<p>Even though he had produced a coin that suppressed powers, it
wasn’t Dollar. It was not like the real Dollar that Han Sen
wielded, in which power could be stacked.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When Evil Eye caught the coin next, the number on its surface
was ten. The purple color on his armor deepened, but it looked as
if the color itself was struggling against the weight. It seemed as
if it had been suppressed by Dollar too much, and it could no
longer hold on.</p>
<p>The audience was frozen. Right now, Evil Eye was at a
disadvantage, and he was being suppressed by Dollar.</p>
<p>“No matter how many times you attempt to replicate my work, you
need to know that Dollar is still mine,” Han Sen said, staring at
his opponent with hard eyes.</p>
<p>Evil Eye looked at Han Sen, and the purple bone flowers on his
armor started to open like real flowers. A deeper, more disturbing
power began to rise from his body.</p>
<p>“Interesting.” Evil Eye suddenly smiled creepily. His hand
released the coin, and within that purple light, the coin was
reduced to dust. The gold dust drifted up from his fingers.</p>
<p>“It seems that I have underestimated you.” Evil Eye looked right
at Han Sen. The bone flowers across his armor continued to bloom.
Each one of them made Evil Eye stronger.</p>
