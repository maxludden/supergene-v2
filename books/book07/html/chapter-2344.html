<h2>The Crime of Killing</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2344</h3>

<p>“Sure, I’d go with you to steal things from Destiny’s Tower. If
I was insane,” Han Sen mumbled to himself. He had no intention of
cooperating with Fox Queen.</p>
<p>For now, his identity hadn’t yet been exposed. He could still
deny any allegations that came up, but stealing something from
Destiny’s Tower was akin to asking for death.</p>
<p>“My Prince! My Prince!” Han Sen was planning on hunting down
some Duke xenogeneics when he heard Lilly’s voice.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to kill some monsters to collect xenogeneics
genes. Can’t you just leave me alone for a bit?” Han Sen felt
depressed. That Siren servant Lilly was coming after him,
repeatedly calling out for her prince.</p>
<p>Lilly was a Siren, too, but she had been raised by Bai Yi’s
mother. She wasn’t with Lan Haixin. As a result, she was the only
servant that Bai Yi had.</p>
<p>Perhaps Lilly still remembered that Bai Yi’s mother had been
good to her, and that was why she decided to stick with Bai Yi. She
was really loyal to him, and her only goal was to serve him well.
It was rare to witness such loyalty.</p>
<p>“My Prince, it is good that you are here… the Sentence Court…
the Sentence Court’s people are here… They… They said the blood
kirin went against the rules of King’s Garden…” Lilly swam to him,
gasping as she spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and said, “Where are they?”</p>
<p>The blood kirin had killed Prince Swordstar’s guard in King’s
Garden. Han Sen knew that incident would come back to bite him. He
just didn’t expect the turnaround to have happened so quickly.</p>
<p>“They are in Ocean Hall. The princess is greeting them right
now. She wants you to return so that you can provide them with an
explanation,” Lilly said.</p>
<p>“Okay. I will go and talk to them, then.” Han Sen had to give up
on his plans for hunting right now. He followed Lilly back to
Underwater Town.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin was sitting in the palace, her face expressionless.
She didn’t look good.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been hiding in the garden, and she had dealt with
all the nobles that came visiting. If she didn’t need Han Sen to
open the Siren relic, she wouldn’t have cared about him at all.</p>
<p>Now, though, the people from the Sentence Court were visiting.
This wasn’t something she could handle alone, and so she had to let
Han Sen deal with these matters by himself.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin didn’t know how Bai Yi had earned the Kingese
protection, but she knew how easily he could cause trouble.</p>
<p>“It was so hard for me to get a half-deified guard, and it has
caused so much trouble. The killing in King’s Garden has brought
the Sentence Court knocking on our door. There is no way he will be
allowed to keep the blood kirin,” Haixin thought to herself.</p>
<p>“Who is looking for me?” Han Sen brought the blood kirin in with
him from the outside.</p>
<p>“I am Chu Nan from the Sentence Court, My Prince.” The
half-deified elite in the lobby slowly bowed to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Ah, it is Courtman Chu. Why have you come looking for me?” Han
Sen knew, but he asked anyway.</p>
<p>Chu Nan signaled to a man next to him. The servant presented Han
Sen with a document. Chu Nan himself said, “I am so sorry, My
Prince. Your blood kirin murdered Prince Swordstar’s guard in
King’s Garden. Prince Swordstar told us in the Sentence Court. We
are here to arrest him, so please forgive us.”</p>
<p>After that, the two servants came forward to arrest the blood
kirin. But Han Sen stopped them.</p>
<p>Chu Nan quietly said, “My Prince, this is an order that comes
directly from the Sentence Court. Please do not make this any more
complicated than it needs to be. If we cannot bring him back today,
then it will force the captain to visit. Then, things will be far
worse.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “I’m not making anything complicated.
The blood kirin is my guard, and I’m the one that commanded it to
kill in King’s Garden. So, I am the leader that caused this. The
crime is mine. I will go with you. There are rules, and I need to
be judged. I am a prince, so I should follow the law.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen reached out his hands. He told Chu Nan he
could lock him up so they could leave.</p>
<p>Chu Nan and the others were shocked. People had been killed in
King’s Garden before, and the princes were usually responsible, but
they always pinned the murders on their guards. But now, this was
in reverse. The prince was taking the crime for the guard. They
looked flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“In that case, My Prince, we are so sorry. We do not need to
cuff you. Please, just come with us.” Chu Nan didn’t formally
arrest Han Sen, but he didn’t plan to let him go, either.</p>
<p>The Sentence Court was allowed to lock up figures of royalty. If
Han Sen wanted to take responsibility for the crime, then Chu Nan
wouldn’t stop him.</p>
<p>There were connections between Prince Swordstar and the Sentence
Court. What happened with the blood kirin required an explanation.
It would have been great if Bai Yi really had committed the crime,
as he would have felt much better.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin watched Han Sen and the blood kirin get taken away.
She looked sick, and she said, “Is that guy crazy? He is going to
jail on behalf of some silly mount. He has lost all his pride as a
prince.”</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Chu Nan to the Sentence Court. He was locked in
the prison there, and he had to wait for the trial before being
sent to the proper penitentiary.</p>
<p>“Bai Yi is going to take the crime that he murdered in King’s
Garden. Is he crazy?” Prince Swordstar, when he heard this news,
was shocked.</p>
<p>But then, a wide smile crossed his face. He said, “That is good.
If he wants to die, then we just let him. Murdering in the King’s
Garden will have him stuck in prison for a hundred years, even if
he is a prince.”</p>
<p>The Sentence Court captain, who was trimming a fern, heard what
the prince said and laughed. “If it was an ordinary noble, they
would be served a death sentence. But he is a Prince, and it was a
guard that was killed. He will probably be in jail for a dozen
years. It is hard to tell exactly how long, though.”</p>
<p>“Ten years is still good.” Prince Swordstar rolled his eyes and
went on to say, “Right, just don’t let that blood kirin go, either.
Does he think he can save everyone? Who does he think he is?”</p>
<p>“Of course. The laws of the Extreme King are fair. We will not
wrong a good man. We will not let go of a bad man,” the Sentence
Court captain said coldly.</p>
<p>Chu Nan brought Han Sen and the blood kirin to jail. He opened
the door and said, “My Prince, I am sorry that you have to live
here.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t walk inside. He looked at Chu Nan and said,
“Mister Chu, can I ask a favor of you?”</p>
<p>“I…” Chu Nan looked conflicted.</p>
<p>“It is nothing big. Can I have him in the same prison cell as
me?” Han Sen stroked the blood kirin’s head as he spoke.</p>
<p>“That is okay…” Chu Nan looked at Han Sen strangely. Hesitantly,
he said, “My Prince… are you really planning on accepting
responsibility for this crime?”</p>
<p>“I would like to, but I’m afraid others will not allow me to,”
Han Sen said simply.</p>
<p>Chu Nan was confused. He understood Bai Yi’s situation. Although
he had done two things that shocked the entirety of the Extreme
King, that couldn’t pardon him from the crime. Since the guard had
been killed, Han Sen would end up going to prison if Prince
Swordstar did not relent.</p>
<p>Even if it was the crown prince that stood accused, he would get
a guard to admit the crime. If he confessed to the crime like Han
Sen, he would end up going to jail, as well.</p>
