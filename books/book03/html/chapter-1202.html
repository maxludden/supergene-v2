<p>When Han Sen heard what Old Xu said, he was shocked.</p>

<p>The Angel Gene fluid the Zhao family had created was not their original creation, after all. It had been based on that vial of liquid.</p>

<p>Angel Gene could never find out what the exact components of the solution were, so it was a bit of an enigma. Roughly, Angel Gene only understood ten percent of the fluid in its entirety.</p>

<p>Humans could not use the liquid itself. That much was certain. Consumption of the liquid would result in the consumer exploding, even if they were a strong surpasser.</p>

<p>When Han Sen asked where the liquid came from, Old Xu told him it came from the grave of a shura king.</p>

<p>“Shura kings can never catch a break from graverobbers, it seems. First, it was the Falsified-Sky Sutra, and now this,” Han Sen mused over the elucidations he was receiving.</p>

<p>Han Sen was happy he never used the liquid. Had he done so, he would have most assuredly died.</p>

<p>“There is no way Zero used it. She would have died if she had, wouldn’t she? Then again, she seems able to switch between human and shura. And this has been a trait of hers for a long time now,” Han Sen thought.</p>

<p>Shortly after the shura had been destroyed, others ships of the Alliance were sent out for relief efforts and investigation. When they reached the Universe, they saw it sitting beside a vast debris field.</p>

<p>After boarding, they were more than surprised to see the countless shura bodies cluttering the hallways of the ship. Furthermore, the personnel and passengers of the Universe were only mildly injured. The death toll was firmly situated on the count of zero.</p>

<p>Han Sen was brought in for questions, and he admitted the hand he had in slaying the leader and all the soldiers. But he feigned cluelessness as to why the entire armada had been destroyed.</p>

<p>When the officers and soldiers heard the description of the events that transpired, though, their admiration for Han Sen was just like old times.</p>

<p>The higher-tier officers looked at Han Sen like he was some kind of monster, but it was a fear driven by respect, and they knew he had done something magnificent.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for Han Sen, everyone on the ship would have assuredly been killed or worse.</p>

<p>To prevent from panicking the populace with the shura threat, everyone on the Universe had to be sworn to secrecy over the events that had transpired. They were even forced to sign an NDA.</p>

<p>Four days later, Han Sen resumed his journey to Lie Men Planet via a different ship. The Alliance provided Han Sen with a Medal of Honor, whereas Angel Gene gifted him a lot of money.</p>

<p>The rumors that Han Sen had been healed also spread. Stories were whispered amongst the populace, telling how he might have single-handedly wiped out a shura general and the army it commanded.</p>

<p>“How? Didn’t Luo Haitang say he could not be healed?” Zhao Seven, leader of Angel Gene, heard the news firsthand, due to him having a direct connection to the events that unfolded.</p>

<p>“I knew his story wasn’t over! Men like him go out with a bang, not a bed-ridden whimper.” Tang Zhenliu leaped for joy when he heard the news.</p>

<p>People had many different reactions upon hearing the story. If Han Sen was able to kill a third-rank shura general with ease, the recent quietness of the Alliance and the lack of wild tales from the Third God’s Sanctuary would be over. He was back in business.</p>

<p>Various officials of the Alliance spent time investigating why the fleet of shura ships had been wiped out. Their suspicions of Han Sen’s involvement did not linger, as it seemed incredibly unlikely one human was capable of doing all that.</p>

<p>Han Sen received countless messages but only replied to those from the people he knew. He did this while continuing his journey to Lie Men Planet.</p>

<p>Ji Ruozhen already knew Han Sen had been healed, but it never really concerned him much, as Han Sen wasn’t one to involve himself in politics or dealings of the army.</p>

<p>When Luo Haitang heard Han Sen had been healed, it didn’t prompt too much concern and it didn’t change anything, either. After all, he had now already selected Han Yan.</p>

<p>A few days later, Han Sen arrived at Lie Men Planet. Professor Long had already started his lectures, so Han Sen found himself joining in two days late.</p>

<p>Han Sen already had a basic knowledge regarding the time and space elements, so it wasn’t a struggle for him to catch up with what he had missed. And if there was something he didn’t understand, he just asked the others for a recap.</p>

<p>After Professor Long finished his lectures for the day, he gave Han Sen a personal call.</p>

<p>“You are quite something, do you know that? Bai Yishan and Li Xinghua, those two weekend-rivals, often talk to me about you. They just told me to give you a proper recap of what you missed, as a matter of fact. If you’re interested in learning even more, perhaps you can come visit my lab, too. You may go there whenever you please,” Professor Long said.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt touched. He didn’t expect Bai Yishan nor Li Xinghua to have known about his hold-up and to also ask Professor Long to help him with what he had missed. It was incredibly kind of them.</p>

<p>After this, Han Sen spent his days in the lectures and his evenings in the lab.</p>

<p>Professor Long was not a fighter. He was a genuine scientist; one well-versed in the workings of the universe, space, and time. His research was very different from Bai Yishan’s and Li Xinghua’s, and it was quite refreshing. Han Sen ended up learning a lot from him.</p>

<p>Han Sen was not a researcher, so he couldn’t help as much as he wanted to in the lab, but he still showed interest and tried to do what he could. Everything there was new for Han Sen, and he pictured himself as some sort of sponge, absorbing knowledge.</p>
