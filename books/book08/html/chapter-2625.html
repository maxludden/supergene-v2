<p>“How do I get these two guys out of the core area?” Han Sen
wondered as he flew behind the small crocodile god and bronze
furnace. They looked as if they could kill God himself, and take
down Buddha as well if he happened to wander by. If any other
xenogeneics got a whiff of them, the terrified creatures would run
away as fast as they could. This made Han Sen so happy.</p>
<p>The bronze furnace was getting closer to becoming deified, and
the small crocodile god was already very powerful. If he could take
them out of the core area, their powers would be very useful.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Han Sen had read through a lot of info
regarding the core area. Much of it was classified documents that
Sky Palace had compiled. Even so, Han Sen had yet to learn how to
bring a core xenogeneic out of the core area.</p>
<p>Unless he killed them and took their core genes, it would be
impossible to bring them out.</p>
<p>The small crocodile god wasn’t happy that Han Sen had been gone
for so long. After it saw him, it began to roar at Han Sen as if it
was chewing him out.</p>
<p>“Look at this,” Han Sen said. He brought out a reconciliation
item he had prepared before-hand. It was a pair of sunglasses that
was tailored for a crocodile.</p>
<p>The small crocodile was instantly fascinated by the gift of
sunglasses. It looked at them with keen curiosity, and it quickly
forgot all about telling him off.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the sunglasses on the small crocodile god.
Fortunately, it had grown up quite a bit. They weren’t too big, and
Han Sen was able to put them on the face of the small crocodile god
with ease.</p>
<p>“Cool.” Han Sen looked at the crocodile god, complete with its
sunglasses, and gave it a thumbs up.</p>
<p>The small crocodile god looked like a gangster boss now. It had
become very intimidating. But the sunglasses also hid the
creature’s tiny, beady eyes, which made the small crocodile god
much easier to approach.</p>
<p>The small crocodile god seemed to approve of the sunglasses. It
looked very cocky with its sunglasses on, and it kept its head
tilted up as if it knew how cool it was.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to use the small crocodile god’s power to kill
deified xenogeneics, but he didn’t know where to begin searching
for them. The bronze furnace led the way forward for half the day,
but they were only able to find one King class core xenogeneic.
They were unable to locate any deified xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Without any deified xenogeneics to kill, Han Sen wasn’t in the
mood to carry on. He found an opportunity when the small crocodile
god wasn’t looking to slip out of the core area. But as Han Sen
stepped through the core hall door, the small crocodile god
appeared. It jumped onto his back.</p>
<p>Han Sen reacted too late to stop it from happening, and he was
already firmly inside the core hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that the powers of the core hall would keep the
small crocodile god from entering. However, when he looked back, he
saw that the small crocodile god was still on his shoulder. They
were inside the core hall together.</p>
<p>The small crocodile god roared at Han Sen in rage. It seemed to
be saying that Han Sen was despicable, and that he was betraying
his promises by running away again. Han Sen didn’t pay any
attention to the crocodile’s objections. He lowered it from his
shoulders and spoke to himself, thinking, “No way. Core xenogeneics
shouldn’t be allowed to enter the core hall. This sort of situation
had never transpired in countless eons, but now, the small
crocodile god just jumped in easily? Was it because of the
crystallizer modifications it was subjected</p>
<p>to?”</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t sure why the small crocodile was able to enter
the core hall, but he didn’t question it. This was an excellent
development.</p>
<p>Han Sen held his breath as he looked at the small crocodile god,
hoping that he could return to the geno universe with it still in
tow. It worked. And that made Han Sen leap for joy.</p>
<p>The small crocodile was in Han Sen’s room. It looked around,
intrigued. It was curious about everything it saw.</p>
<p>“I am rich! I can bring creatures out of the core area. This
little guy is a deified xenogeneic with a nine-star potential. It
could become a true god.” Han Sen was extremely excited, but as he
thought about it some more, he became worried.</p>
<p>He had been Dollar when he met the small crocodile god. He had
just brought the small crocodile god to Sky Palace, and if
Exquisite saw it, she would realize that he was Dollar.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t let the small crocodile god stay here.” Ignoring
the small crocodile god’s objections, Han Sen tossed him back into
the core area.</p>
<p>The small crocodile god roared at him from the core area. It was
clearly upset that Han Sen had sent it back.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried comforting it a little, and he promised that he
would bring the small crocodile god out one day. When the small
crocodile god finally came into the geno universe, it would receive
many gifts. That was the only way Han Sen could get the creature to
calm down.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to bring the bronze furnace into the core hall as
well, but it immediately bounced out. So far, the small crocodile
god was the only being that could follow him out. “It seems as if
the small crocodile god can only follow me out of the core area
because of the crystallizer modification tests,” Han Sen thought to
himself. He didn’t know where the small crocodile god could be
safely kept if he was brought through to the geno universe.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t keep the creature in Sky Palace. It couldn’t
stay anywhere that connected to Han Sen. He tried to think of a
place that it could stay for a while, but he came up empty.
Allowing the small crocodile god to wander across the universe
would be a waste of a personal fighter, and Han Sen would fear for
its safety.</p>
<p>The universe was a more savage place than the core area.
Although the small crocodile god was like a ruler in the core area,
in the larger geno universe, there were still plenty of xenogeneics
that would be able to kill it.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have any good options at the moment, so he went
back to Sky Palace alone.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned on going to his old stomping grounds on Planet
Eclipse. Maybe he could contact his little uncle and Xie Qing King
to see if they had a place for the small crocodile god. But before
he could leave his little jade island, he saw Lone Bamboo coming
his way.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, your wounds should be healed by now, yes?” Lone Bamboo
asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I’m around eighty or ninety percent healed,” Han Sen
answered.“That is good enough for me. I’m going to White King City
to hunt xenogeneics. Let’s go together,” Lone Bamboo said. “White
King City? I don’t have a pass for entry.” Each of the five cities
required a specific pass. They couldn’t use one city’s pass to
enter another. Han Sen only had the pass that granted him access to
Black King City, so he couldn’t enter any of the other four
cities.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo lobbed a pass to Han Sen and said, “Now you have
one.”</p>
<p>“Fine. But you should at least tell me what goes on in White
King City,” Han Sen said, as he caught the spell and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk while we walk,” Lone Bamboo said as he started
moving in the direction of the White Jade Jing.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed, and Lone Bamboo began to explain White King
City.</p>
<p>It was different from Black King City. White King City had
xenogeneics that were King class and above. There were even deified
creatures that roamed there. But the xenogeneics that occupied that
place were unusual. They were different from the wild xenogeneics
that could be found elsewhere. After Lone Bamboo explained White
King City to him, Han Sen’s eyes brightened. “What you’re saying is
that White King City is like a giant arena? And you need to kill
the xenogeneics in an arena to earn their eggs?” Han Sen asked with
a look of disbelief.</p>
<p>“It is something like that, yes. If your power is sufficient,
you can kill a deified xenogeneic and take the creature’s eggs,”
Lone Bamboo confirmed with a nod.</p>
<p>“There is a place that good around here? You should have told me
sooner.” Han Sen was so happy.</p>
