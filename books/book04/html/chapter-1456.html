    <p>
      As the place descended into chaos, Han Sen took off running. Suddenly, a
      sword cleaved through the air, and plumes of feathers choked the sky as
      many of the flying creatures were killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snake-turtle and the crocodile stopped fighting when they saw this. No
      longer interested in the meat, they started to scuttle away in different
      directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are you going?” Han Sen heard a woman’s voice call out from the
      sky, as another swordswipe reached for the crocodile. The movement was too
      quick for Han Sen to make out the wielder of that weapon, but it cut down
      the crocodile in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crocodile used its scissors to try to block the incoming attack, but
      it wasn’t fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, a scream echoed. The sword cut through the crocodile’s head, and its
      lifeless body dropped down onto the shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures were all fighting against each other in a bid to escape now,
      even the super creatures. Even they did not want the meat anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. The crocodile was incredibly strong, and he hadn’t
      expected a sword-wielding phantom to one-hit kill it so simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought he had heard this voice before. When that person put away
      the sword, and he got a closer look, he was shocked. She was the master of
      the Demi-God Association. She was someone who probably had a connection to
      Han Jinzhi.
    </p>
    <p>“Why are you here?” The woman frowned, seeing Han Sen there.</p>
    <p>
      “I got chased by creatures, and I ended up in here. I didn’t expect to see
      you here. You must be so powerful to one-hit super creatures like that,”
      Han Sen said, looking up at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, he had exited his super king spirit before the encounter. He
      had done so to save power. Had he not done this, the woman might have
      thought he was a creature and killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman coldly responded, “There is a lot more you don’t know. Do you
      really think you’re the first super aristocrat in the Alliance?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but I know you and the other members of Blood Legion are stronger
      than I am.” Han Sen shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>“Good. Then let’s go.” When the woman said that, she turned around.</p>
    <p>
      “Go where?” Han Sen frowned. He did not want to associate or interact with
      that woman here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman said, “It is good to see you here, and there is something I need
      you to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have important matters to attend to. I’m not sure I can spare the time
      to help you,” Han Sen declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stopped, turned around, and coldly said, “You can reject me,
      sure; but you can’t reject my sword. If you try to leave, I’ll arrange for
      you and my sword to become well-acquainted.”
    </p>
    <p>“Do I have a choice?” Han Sen shrugged again.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes. Death is always a choice.” The woman spoke with surprising
      sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who would willingly choose death while they’re living?” Han Sen sighed
      and simply followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crocodile’s body disappeared after the kill, and not even its flesh
      was left behind. Still, the woman collected its Life Geno Essence and even
      received its geno core Crocodile Scissors.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen knew he wouldn’t be able to beat her, so he followed her.</p>
    <p>
      The woman seemed to ignore Han Sen on their way, but she took him for a
      long walk through the Underworld. She behaved differently than she had in
      the Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Alliance, none were able to sense her true power. Here, merely
      being in her presence told you she was frighteningly powerful. No creature
      would dare approach her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to ask her a few questions, but after firing them, he
      received no answer. She ignored him. After a few more repeated tries, he
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked in this manner for two whole days. Eventually, they left the
      Underworld via some cave on a mountainside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are we going?” Han Sen looked around, acknowledging it to be a
      place he was unfamiliar with. He could not tell where Shadow Shelter was
      from there.
    </p>
    <p>Surprisingly, the woman said, “To my shelter.”</p>
    <p>“Your shelter? Is it a human shelter?” Han Sen asked in shock.</p>
    <p>“Who told you I’m human?” the woman coldly said.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. He used his Dongxuan Aura to scan her, and while she
      was very strong, he still got the sense she was a human.
    </p>
    <p>“What are you, if you aren’t a human? A spirit?” Han Sen kidded.</p>
    <p>“Han Jinzhi didn’t tell you anything?” the woman said, frowning.</p>
    <p>
      “If I knew, I wouldn’t need to ask you.” Han Sen felt lame. He didn’t even
      know if he was actually the heir of Teacher Han.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought she would tell him something, but she groaned and said,
      “This has nothing to do with what you need to do. It doesn’t matter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman kept on walking after that, but she actually started answering
      questions for Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least tell me what I’m doing? And your name. What is it? I can’t keep
      calling you woman.” Han Sen wasn’t going to give up yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman hesitated a little, and then said, “You’ll know once we get
      there. And in regards to my name, call me whatever you wish to. It’s
      merely a title.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s not really an answer.” Han Sen’s heart sank, and after that, the
      woman went back to ignoring him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman summoned a beast. Han Sen sat on it, and it didn’t take him long
      to discover it was a super mount. It was blisteringly quick. But even at
      that speed, the mount had to run for four days straight before they
      reached the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen expected, the place was massive. It had been built on a
      floating island, draped with clouds like a heavenly scene. The floating
      island had no simple palace, though. What was there was a city, and it was
      clearly a super shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen did not see a single human there in the shelter. There were
      far more spirits than creatures residing there, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scariest thing was that the spirits and creatures there were all
      remarkably strong. They weren’t much weaker than Han Sen, which meant they
      were sacred-blood creatures and royal spirits at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they saw the woman, they all bowed. They all either greatly admired
      her or feared her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were curious about the person sitting next to her; Han Sen. They
      inquisitively guessed who he might be, and what sort of person would be
      allowed to tag along so casually.
