<p>At that moment, Han Sen’s body wrapped itself up in a white
flame. He turned into a being of light and became a transparent
force of energy.</p>
<p>Sharon squinted against the sudden light. His hands and nails
pierced through Han Sen, but he felt nothing. He couldn’t feel Han
Sen’s flesh in the slightest.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked like a god. His Blood Feather Knife blazed down
towards Sharon’s head like a beam of light. Sharon’s wings curled,
and he disappeared as if he was teleporting. Han Sen’s slash missed
his body.</p>
<p>But there was some movement in the air, and Sharon’s body
appeared again. He roared, and his hands turned into talons to
strike Han Sen.</p>
<p>The roaring Demon-Dragon was operating at maximum power, and he
attacked Han Sen with a technique that never missed.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on evading it, though. The Demon-Dragon
pierced through Han Sen’s body, but it was as if he was just a
hologram. The strike went through Han Sen without damaging him at
all.</p>
<p>“Impossible! What is this power?” Sharon was shocked. It seemed
like Sharon had hit Han Sen’s real body, but it hadn’t worked. His
strongest strike had done nothing.</p>
<p>“This is the power that will kill you.” Han Sen moved in front
of Sharon like a beam of light and slashed with his Blood Feather
Knife.</p>
<p>He did not have much time. Super god spirit mode would only run
for a short while, and if he could not kill Sharon in that window,
he’d be very dead.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Sharon’s dragon wings flapped, and again, he disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knife had been unable to hit him. It seemed like
Sharon was using a genuine teleportation ability, so there was no
hidden movement to trace. But he could be followed if Han Sen’s
Dongxuan Aura could track and predict the energy he was using.</p>
<p>“You cannot kill me,” Sharon said haughtily. “I have Demon and
Dragon blood, and I have Breakspace powers. I can teleport freely
as I choose, and your power does not belong to an Earl. You cannot
last long in such a form. Once your power has been exhausted, you
will be dead.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid you won’t have that chance.” Han Sen, looking like
a god, waved his Blood Feather Knife. Then, a white knife light was
in front of Sharon.</p>
<p>Sharon dodged Han Sen’s knifelight and appeared down another
tunnel. He looked over to Han Sen with disdain. “I told you. You
cannot kill me.”</p>
<p>But the next second, Sharon’s face fell. As soon as he
reappeared, his body had been cut by an invisible knifelight.</p>
<p>There was a katcha noise. His arm was detached from his body,
sending out a cascade of Demon and Dragon blood. Throughout the
entire cave, knifelights shone like a spiderweb. Wherever Sharon
teleported, he was hurt by the lights. They savaged him, ripping
off his limbs.</p>
<p>“You are strong, but you selected the wrong opponent,” Han Sen
said to Sharon, swooping over to slash his body.</p>
<p>Sharon, who had lost all his limbs, tried to teleport away. But
when he finished teleporting, countless knifelights tore through
his body. They sliced his body into bits, sending blood and viscera
spilling everywhere.</p>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Demon Dragon: mutant
xenogeneic gene found.”</p>
<p>Blergh! Han Sen fell to the ground. He looked like a human
again, albeit one that was coughing up blood. Sharon had been as
good as a Marquise could get. Without super god spirit, Han Sen
would have needed to be a Marquise to fight him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s super god spirit had allowed him to fight Sharon, but
his body had still been pushed to the limits. And with the injuries
he had sustained, there was no hope of him fighting again for some
time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there weren’t any other threats in the area. Any
Earl could bring an end to Han Sen right now.</p>
<p>Han Sen forced himself to stand up. He walked over to Sharon’s
shattered body and picked up a black Dragon-Demon scale. Then, he
left.</p>
<p>There should have been two more Marquises about, as they had
been following Sharon. But Han Sen did not know where they had
gone. He tried to hide his presence to avoid meeting them, since he
couldn’t risk having to fight them. Encountering them would likely
mean death.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to return to the Sanctuary, but the Ancient God
space seemed to stop him from opening a portal that he could jump
back through.</p>
<p>And of course, Han Sen’s body was too weak to teleport back.</p>
<p>He walked away from the battlefield, but he wasn’t able to get
very far. He found a hidden cave, and in it, he settled down and
focused on recovering. He ran a number of skills to try to speed up
the healing process.</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen’s body was stronger than the average
creature’s. Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra made his body
stronger than a Dragon’s.</p>
<p>If Han Sen became a Marquise, he’d be stronger than Dragon
Thirteen.</p>
<p>“I hope those two Marquises don’t find me before I can fight
them.” Han Sen knew it was useless to think about this now, though.
He initiated a countdown, then cast a geno art to heal himself.</p>
<p>The White Tiger Marquise and the other Marquise waited outside
the statue, but they saw no sign of Sharon or Dragon Thirteen.
Eventually, they found the continued absence of their companions to
be strange.</p>
<p>They knew the power of Dragon Thirteen and Sharon’s combined
might. Those two could kill a Duke, if they chose to. But they had
been inside the silver statue for the longest time, and there was
no sign of either of them. It made the pair remaining start to
worry.</p>
<p>The White Tiger Marquise used a sonic power to boom his voice
down through the cave. No response was heard. Silence was all that
followed.</p>
<p>“Has something happened to them?” Bloodbird Marquise sounded
worried.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Han Sen is an Earl. He cannot beat both
Sharon and Dragon Thirteen.” The Marquise White Tiger was worried,
but he didn’t want to believe it.</p>
<p>“Should we go and take a look?” Bloodbird Marquise asked, with
obvious hesitation.</p>
<p>“We should wait,” White Tiger Marquise said firmly.</p>
<p>If Sharon and Dragon Thirteen were safe, they would bring Han
Sen out with them. If something happened to them, then it would be
suicide for Bloodbird and White Tiger to go after them.</p>
<p>The White Tiger and Bloodbird waited outside, and the longer
they waited, the more worried they became. All they wanted to do
was escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still recovering his powers. He had been badly hurt,
and he was very exhausted. It’d take a while for him to
recover.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen heard something crawling across the rocks. His
heart jumped. He opened his eyes and saw the silver glass bug
coming towards him. It stared at Han Sen with its silver eyes.</p>
