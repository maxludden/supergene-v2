Pang!

Han Sen’s fist and the half-deified bug’s claw collided. The blade-like claws of the beast scratched Han Sen’s armor, drawing a few light marks across its surface. The armor, however, wasn’t broken.

Han Sen’s fist didn’t have enough power to knock away the bug’s claws.

The bug squealed weirdly. Its body flashed with a purple and red light, leaving afterimages as it moved. A flurry of purple and red claw lights came toward Han Sen.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

All of those claws, which could tear through space with ease, came down on Han Sen. The strikes produced a number of light marks across his Dongxuan Armor, but the light scratches vanished quickly.

Dragon One and the others kept an eye on Han Sen. If he couldn’t kite the half-deified bug, they would have to abandon the fight and escape.

But when they turned to watch, they found Han Sen fighting the half-deified creature head-to-head. Although he was suppressed, it was remarkable that the half-deified bug was unable to penetrate his armor.

“Is that guy really a first-tier King?” Dragon Eight looked troubled. Even with his indestructible gold dragon body, he couldn’t block the power of a half-deified’s strike. Han Sen, on the other hand, seemed to be handling the battle rather easily.

Han Sen was unworried, but it wasn’t because of the strength of his Dongxuan Armor.

It was true that the Dongxuan Armor was very resilient. For a first-tier King, it would have ranked as a top-class defensive armor.

But strength like that still wasn’t enough to withstand the pummeling of a half-deified creature. Move Mountain Area’s power was the real reason the bug couldn’t hurt Han Sen.

Move Mountain Area was actually quite special. It didn’t increase Han Sen’s power or weaken his enemies. Instead, it simply transferred power.

First, Move Mountain Area required a carrier, and that carrier could not be a body. While the conch had used its own shell as a carrier, Han Sen had chosen to use his Dongxuan Armor.

Under the effects of Move Mountain Area, any power that attacked the carrier would instead be absorbed by the carrier.

It was like a hydroelectric plant on a river. The power of a river could crush many things, but the Move Mountain Area could separate some of that power and use it for other things.

Unless the enemy’s power was strong enough to break the Move Mountain Area and the designated carrier outright, then additional attacks wouldn’t do any good. In fact, they would actually increase the carrier’s defensive capabilities.

But Move Mountain Area had two primary downsides. The first con was that the power absorbed by the carrier couldn’t be transformed into offensive power and turned back on foes.

The second con was something really bad. The more power the carrier absorbed, the more pressure it would endure. Although it wouldn’t crush Han Sen’s body, it would make him move very slowly.

After using Move Mountain Area, Han Sen could shrug off powerful blows. But if he wanted to run or attack, he would be too slow to do so.

Fortunately, in this situation, Han Sen had no plans to attack the half-deified bug. All he had to do was hold it in place until Dragon One killed his own bug and came over to help. So, for this purpose, Han Sen was happy to select Move Mountain Area.

Move Mountain Area had its benefits. Although the bug’s consuming area continued trying to drain power from Han Sen, it merely drained the stored power of the carrier. The enemy was recollecting its own power, and thus it didn’t have any effect on Han Sen.

The half-deified bug attacked Han Sen furiously. Han Sen tried to dodge at first, but he soon gave up the attempt. The bug’s attacks were focused on the Dongxuan Armor, and the destructive powers the beast wielded had weakened. In the end, it didn’t really affect Han Sen.

But Han Sen was very encumbered by that power. He moved so slowly that it was impossible for him to strike back at the half-deified bug.

Dragon Eight and the others were all frozen. They saw Han Sen floating in the air as if he wasn’t the least bit worried. He ignored the half-deified bug’s attacks like they were no more than a tickle. He was completely unmoving.

The bug’s creepy consuming area didn’t seem to work on him, either. His power wasn’t growing any weaker.

They could tell that Han Sen’s blue light area was doing something, but they were just as bewildered by it as Han Sen had been when he first saw it. It seemed like magic, an ability that defied rational explanation.

Upon seeing this, Dragon One was greatly relieved. He had been worried that Han Sen wouldn’t be able to keep a half-deified bug busy. Now, clearly, there was no need for concern. Dragon One focused all his power on attacking the other half-deified bug.

As he drifted, Han Sen noticed that Dragon Eight was doing badly. Han Sen sent a few lazy attacks toward the ordinary core bugs surrounding Dragon Eight, drawing their attention. In seconds, Han Sen was taking attacks from one half-deified bug and a few dozen of the King class bugs. Even so, he was still in a totally fine condition. Dragon Eight and the others stared at him with wide eyes.

“Holy shit! What kind of defense is that? It’s sick,” a Dragon King couldn’t help but exclaim.

Han Sen was bored out of his mind. He had grown stronger, but his movement speed was so low. He moved like a snail. Running was out of the question.

“I’m going to give this beast soul to Wang Yuhang. He’s the perfect person to become a punching bag. Move Mountain Area will suit him very well. He can take the brunt of the enemy’s aggression while I attack. It really is perfect,” Han Sen thought, quite pleased with the sudden idea.

Because Han Sen had drawn the attention of so many of the bugs, Dragon Eight and the others were all free. Dragon One and a half-deified bug were still engaged in combat.

Han Sen was bored, so he turned himself to watch the half-deified Dragon fight. Han Sen had always admired the combat skills of the Dragon. Dragon One’s enemy was half-deified as well, but the bug was getting destroyed. It would die soon.

Also, while Dragon One was fighting the bugs in close-quarter combat, the consuming area didn’t seem to affect him.

Katcha!

As Han Sen was deep in thought, he saw Dragon One punch through the side of the half-deified bug’s head and straight into its brain. Despite losing its brain, however, it didn’t stop fighting.

With a few more strikes, Dragon One ripped the bug’s body into pieces. It stopped moving.

After Dragon One killed a half-deified bug, he flew over to Han Sen. He was going to kill the other half-deified bug that Han Sen had kept occupied.

Dragon One engaged the bug, relieving some of the pressure on Han Sen. He put away his Move Mountain Area so that he could move freely again.

The ordinary bugs were no threat to Han Sen. He used his Dongxuan Movement to travel through the swarm of bugs. The King class bugs couldn’t do a thing to him, and Han Sen soon found a chance to take out two.

He didn’t earn a beast soul, though. Han Sen made sure that he stayed within range of the half-deified bug as he traveled. After a while, Dragon One delivered a strike that heavily damaged the half-deified bug. Han Sen gathered up a coin on his finger.

As he used Saving Money, the number on the coin started to increase. Just as the bug was about to die, Han Sen fired a coin with the number “12” on its surface.

Pang!

The badly injured bug exploded under the force of Han Sen’s Saving Money.

“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Core Demon Bug. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained King class mutant beast soul Core Demon Bug.”
