<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was like a sponge being squeezed by the young
man’s hand. Suddenly, another version of his body appeared behind
the young man.</p>
<p>A weird power movement was coming out of Han Sen’s fingertips.
It tapped the back of the young man’s head.</p>
<p>The young man coldly laughed. “If it was four holy spirits
combined in one, perhaps it would work against me a little. With
just the Kirin’s holy spirit, you cannot damage my God Spirit holy
body at all.”</p>
<p>The young man’s expression quickly changed. He noticed that Han
Sen had not used the Holy Kirin’s power. He had just been tapped on
the back of the head.</p>
<p>After that hit, Han Sen was sent flying a thousand miles.</p>
<p>The young man turned around. He coldly looked at Han Sen and
said, “I said, I am better than Qin Xiu. I am the true immortal God
Spirit holy body. Your power does nothing to me.” Han Sen’s finger
had not even hurt his scalp.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained silent. He quietly looked at the young man.</p>
<p>“Stop wasting time. After I kill you, I will reunite you with
your son in the pits of hell. I will make sure you don’t end up too
lonely there.” The young man raised a hand. He wanted to combine
the power of his holy body and the God Spirit power.</p>
<p>When he raised his arm, the young man’s eyes looked smaller. He
saw that his finger was uncontrollably shaking. It was steadily
shaking faster. It was like his finger was playing piano in the
air.</p>
<p>It was not just his hands. The young man quickly discovered that
his entire body was shaking. His muscles were twisting, and his
blood vessels were jumping. He was shaking more than a person with
Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>His body was powerfully shaking, but the young man could not
feel anything wrong. It was like the body that was shaking was not
his.</p>
<p>The young man brought his hands together, but he could not stop
from shaking. He screamed at Han Sen. “You! What did you do to
me?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I just don’t like trouble. Fighting powerful creatures
can be tiring, so that is why I prefer turning powerful creatures
into pigs. Then, I kill them as they squeal. It is easier that
way.” Han Sen looked at the young man calmly. He lifted his cause
karma knife. The holy flame on the knife was wildly shaking.</p>
<p>“What are you? How dare you talk like that directly in front of
me. Die already!” The young man flashed a blue light. He was going
to grab Han Sen.</p>
<p>Just as he moved, his bones and flesh appeared to recede. The
blue god light was fading away. The crystal god body was suddenly
smaller. He now had a common body.</p>
<p>“How is that… Impossible… My God Spirit holy body…” The young
man was in complete shock. He peered at his hands.</p>
<p>His hands were already leaving God Spirit mode. His entire God
Spirit body started to wilt soon after. His life force and presence
were shrinking. He dropped down from true god level to butterfly
class.</p>
<p>“Right now, aren’t you just a pig for me to kill?” Han Sen
raised his knife and swung it.</p>
<p>Many knife streams were in the sky. They moved with Han Sen like
a galaxy going into the young man’s body. “Argh.” The young man
forced himself to use his holy body’s time and space power, but
butterfly time and space powers were not enough to block Han Sen’s
stream of knives.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The young man’s body was hit by the knife stream. He exploded
with a blue light. A trail of blue light quickly went into the
darkness. In the darkness, the young man gnashed his teeth and
yelled, “Han Sen, I will kill you!”</p>
<p>Han Sen ran into the darkness, but he could not see that young
man’s body again. He frowned.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked back. He saw a pile of blue metal chips on the
floor. Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to take a look at the
chips. He quickly discovered that those pieces belonged to a metal
doll. It had to have been a treasure for copying one’s body for
survival.</p>
<p>“What a shame I did not kill him.” Han Sen looked at the bodies
of the demon lady and the others. He waved his hand, and their
bodies were collected in Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not like them much. If it was not for Littleflower,
he would have killed them while he was destroying the holy
palace.</p>
<p>Now that they were dead, Han Sen was not going to be sad. They
were true god class bodies. Han Sen wanted to take them back and
see Littleflower’s reaction when he saw them.</p>
<p>If Littleflower had no objections, Han Sen would happily turn
them into geno fluid. He looked at the ruins of the holy palace and
departed the big barren systems. After leaving the big barren
systems, he teleported back to Space Garden.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Super God Spirit body and Super Spank are
powerful, but I am not sure what power that was. After killing the
God Spirit, they will be destroyed and not leave anything behind.
To me, that is not beneficial. I will be unable to get God Spirit
genes or God Spirits. I also won’t be able to get God Spirit
armaments. I will be unable to make myself stronger.” He thought he
should kill low-level God Spirits first to find the god personality
armament that was suitable. Then, he could move on with saving
Golden Growler. After returning to Space Garden, Han Sen saw Nine
Thousand King. He had delivered the xenogeneic genes to Space
Garden, which was how he had avoided being killed.</p>
<p>Han Sen told him about the demon lady and the others being
killed. He also told him about the young man. When Nine Thousand
King heard all of that, he was infuriated. He gnashed his teeth and
said, “He is a traitor.” “Do you know him?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“How could I not know him? He was the master’s favorite student.
The master even gave him a name. They shared the same name even.
His name is Qin Lan. Master treated him like a son. His reputation
was higher than the 10 generals. I did not expect him to betray
everything.” Nine Thousand King looked very angry. He wanted to
skin Qin Lan alive and get rid of Sacred’s traitors.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Nine Thousand King about Qin Lan, but Nine
Thousand King did not know much. He did not know Qin Lan was a gene
clone of Qin Xiu. He did not know anything.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic genes Nine Thousand King brought surprised Han
Sen. There were many true god class and butterfly class xenogeneic
genes. There was enough there to make Little Angel true god class.
Han Sen thought, “The leftover resources can make someone else true
god class too. Who should I give them to first?” Aside from Little
Angel, who was able to combine herself with him, the others could
help him out in less obvious ways. It was hard for them to match
him.</p>
<p>“There is no rush with this matter. I’ll just leave things as
they are for now. I have to put a god personality into a god
personality armament first.” Han Sen found a chance to be Dollar
again. He took the god personality to the god palace.</p>
