    <p>
      Jia Shidao and the others looked completely horrified as the crystal cacti
      surrounded them like a forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Yu and Luo Hui also looked frightened. Luo Yu had the armor, so he
      wasn’t afraid of the thorns of the crystal cacti. However, Luo Hui didn’t
      have any armor to protect him. If those crystal cacti attacked him from
      all directions at the same time, there was no way he would survive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Yu wouldn’t be much better off. Though he had armor to protect him,
      those crystal cacti had already surrounded him like a cage. No matter how
      strong his armor was, he would still die if he couldn’t break free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as everyone was starting to panic, the crystal cacti separated and
      made a path in the direction of a mountain valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two creatures that looked identical were walking down either side of the
      path. The two creatures looked like jade, and their shapes looked like the
      legendary White Beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Li was shocked when she saw two mutant creatures coming out. She
      shouted, “Those are super creatures called White Beasts. I saw one once
      when I was following Luo Haitang. However, he said that White Beasts are
      extremely rare creatures, and it’s difficult for them to procreate. He
      thought there might have been only one White Beast in the entire Fourth
      God’s Sanctuary. He wanted to domesticate the White Beast that we saw, but
      it managed to escape. It’s extremely powerful. Now two White Beasts just
      showed up at the same time. What is this place?”
    </p>
    <p>Both Luo Yu and Luo Hui looked sick after hearing what Luo Li said.</p>
    <p>
      A terrifying cactus forest, and two super creatures that even their
      patriarch praised. They had even less chance of surviving now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two White Beasts walked down the path. They stepped aside without
      attacking Han Sen or the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the White Beasts stepped aside, the group saw another creature
      walking behind the White Beasts. That creature was a black bull with goat
      horns, and there was white mist surrounding its hoofs as if it were
      stepping on the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>“Sky Cloud Sacred Beast!” Luo Li was horrified.</p>
    <p>
      Though Luo Li didn’t say anything about the Sky Cloud Sacred Beast, the
      name itself had already made Luo Yu and Luo Hui desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao didn’t know what a Sky Cloud Sacred Beast was, but he could
      tell from Luo Yu and Luo Hui that it was even more terrifying than a White
      Beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sky Cloud Beast kept walking toward them. Though it didn’t let out its
      power, it made Luo Yu feel an indefinable sense of pressure. Sweat covered
      his palms. If it weren’t for the crystal cacti blocking their way, they
      would have run far away instead of standing there staring at the Sky Cloud
      Sacred Beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Yu and Luo Hui had both heard of Sky Cloud Sacred Beasts before. They
      were berserk super creatures, and they were some of the most powerful
      creatures in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how arrogant and proud Luo Yu and Luo Hui were, they wouldn’t be
      naïve enough to think that they could actually rival a berserk super
      creature. They were already sinking into hopelessness as the Sky Cloud
      Sacred Beast walked toward them. They didn’t see any chance that they
      would survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sky Cloud Sacred Beast walked into the encirclement. It didn’t even
      glance at Luo Yu and the others; instead, it stepped directly toward Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you Sky Sword Han Sen?” The Sky Cloud Sacred Beast stared at Han Sen
      with its eyes that looked like brass bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m Han Sen, but I won’t call myself Sky Sword. Who are you?” Han Sen was
      a little dazed. He had already prepared to have a huge battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He’d been planning to use the technique he learned in God’s Ruin and
      summon his Destiny’s Tower to smash his way out. He hadn’t expected the
      terrifying creature to call out his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Hui and Luo Yu looked between the Sky Cloud Sacred Beast and Han Sen,
      confused, as they didn’t know what was happening. Clearly, Han Sen didn’t
      know what a Sky Cloud Sacred Beast was, yet it had called Han Sen’s name,
      so apparently, it was coming for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is indeed Sky Sword, your highness. My young master wants to meet you,
      so please come to the shelter and greet him.” The Sky Cloud Sacred Beast
      nodded at the White Beast beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the White Beasts moved to lay down in front of Han Sen. It seemed
      that it wanted Han Sen to ride it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Yu and the others were all bewildered. Even if Luo Haitang came here
      by himself, he wouldn’t have had such a welcoming. After all, Luo Haitang
      was so ferocious that many creatures and spirits hated him. If the Sky
      Cloud Sacred Beast met him, there might have been a huge battle instead of
      a warm welcoming like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the Sky Cloud Sacred Beast had said it had a master. This being
      was terrifying enough to control a Sky Cloud Sacred Beast, and he had just
      invited Han Sen to his shelter with such an ostentatious presentation.
      They couldn’t even imagine what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sorry, may I ask who your young master is?” Han Sen couldn’t think of
      anyone he knew who could afford something so grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’ll know when you meet him.” Sky Cloud Sacred Beast didn’t answer the
      question directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw that the Sky Cloud Sacred Beast didn’t mean anything hostile,
      and besides, he didn’t really have a choice. Instead of asking more
      questions, he just sat down on the White Beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sky Cloud Sacred Beast turned around and began walking deep into the
      dune while the White Beast carrying Han Sen followed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Silver was lying on Han Sen’s head. He squinted his eyes and looked
      at the Sky Cloud Sacred Beast in front of him. Bao’er was riding the small
      Ice Seahorse behind Han Sen, and Little Star quickly followed as well.
    </p>
    <p>“What should we do?” Luo Hui asked anxiously.</p>
    <p>They were still encircled by the crystal cacti and couldn’t get out.</p>
    <p>
      “He’s the son of sister Lan. He’ll be merciful.” Luo Li then followed Han
      Sen, looking at him riding the White Beast with a complicated expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Yu clenched his teeth and asked Luo Hui and the others to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao didn’t have any other choice. He was nervous, but the whole
      thing also seemed a little unbelievable. He didn’t know what was
      happening, or what he was getting himself into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the guidance of the Sky Cloud Sacred Beast, everyone arrived at the
      deepest area of the dune. They saw a shelter that looked like a bronze
      mountain, and it was spectacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a spirit waiting in front of the shelter. When Luo Yu and the
      others saw the spirit, they looked more upset. Luo Haitang was well-known
      in this shelter. He was respected, but he had made lots of enemies as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>Usually, Luo Haitang’s enemies were all horrifying beings.</p>
    <p>
      Luo Yu and Luo Hui recognized the spirit when they saw him standing in
      front of the bronze mountain shelter. That spirit was a descendant of one
      of Luo Haitang’s enemies, and it had a great reputation in the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that spirit knew that they were descendants of Luo Haitang, they might
      be doomed.
