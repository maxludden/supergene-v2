    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face remained emotionless, looking at Tu Bin. He thought
      the young men around him were rather interesting, as they were all
      considered high-class in the Alliance. They might not have all belonged to
      the same factions, but as was displayed by Yi Dongmu, an
      individual&#8217;s power was respected.
    </p>

    <p>This principle kept things simple.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hero Han, do you dare challenge our Yi God?&#8221; Tu Bin was very
      confident in Yi Dongmu&#8217;s abilities, so he established the
      proposition of a battle against Yi Dongmu on his behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing was sneakily happy at the reaction her comment incited, as this
      was what she hoped would happen. Her trick had worked, and now, she could
      bear witness to Han Sen&#8217;s true power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many others were overjoyed at the prospect of what had been proposed, as
      many people would have liked to see what would occur in a battle between
      Han Sen and Yi Dongmu. Han Sen had beaten Yu Qielan in a fight and had
      made the Alliance look good, which had established Han Sen as something of
      a hero. If there was one thing that united humanity, it was a common
      enemy, and at this point in time, that enemy was more often than not the
      shura.
    </p>

    <p>
      But with the shura out of the picture for the time being, although Han Sen
      was still regarded as a hero, the desire for humans to fight amongst
      themselves was always prone to crop up. When not united, families
      re-segregated and factions re-established their borders. The people who
      did not like Han Sen, and those who opposed or did not like the Ji family,
      cared little for his recently achieved status as hero.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amidst everyone&#8217;s joy, Yi Dongmu approached. At his movement, all
      fell silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu&#8217;s personality was rather quiet, and he excelled in the
      realm of assassination skills. He was generally a cold person and being
      close with him was difficult due to his chilly disposition. Everyone who
      was present knew about him and admired him, but few personally spoke with
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, everyone watched Yi Dongmu approach Han Sen. They thought Yi
      Dongmu was ready to challenge Han Sen, and so their excitement began to
      simmer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people there all believed Yi Dongmu was the strongest, but with Han
      Sen having just beaten a royal shura, they knew he was an opponent who
      should not be underestimated. Whatever was about to occur, one thing was
      for certain: it would be a crazy fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing was supremely excited, just as the rest were. The palms of her
      hands were sweaty with anticipation. Being able to see Yi Dongmu
      personally challenge another was an extremely rare occurrence, and it had
      only happened once over the course of the past few years.
    </p>

    <p>Only the enigmatic Dollar received his request.</p>

    <p>
      Seeing Yi Dongmu approach Han Sen, everyone perked their ears and leaned a
      little closer to hear what might be spoken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing&#8217;s eyes were open wide, watching Yi Dongmu himself approach
      her. In her heart, she said to herself, &#8220;Come on, Yi God! Beat him!
      I know you can do it. Beat him badly.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      She watched as Yi Dongmu and Han Sen locked gazes, anticipating the big
      fight that was just waiting to be started. But Yi Dongmu only sat down
      next to Han Sen, and when he turned to look at him, said, &#8220;When did
      you get here?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Today,&#8221; Han Sen answered.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you have time?&#8221; Yi Dongmu asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; Han Sen nodded.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you want to come over to my place? I&#8217;ve been practicing
      something new, and it&#8217;d be great if you could come check it out for
      me.&#8221; After saying this, Yi Dongmu stood up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Qing, you hang around for a while longer. I have to take
      off.&#8221; Han Sen smiled to Ji Qing and left the place alongside Yi
      Dongmu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was aware of Ji Qing&#8217;s game and considered it childish, not
      wanting to play any part in her schemes. Things were always much quieter
      with Yi Dongmu, a person whose company he vastly preferred. He
      didn&#8217;t enjoy hanging around noisy kids, and someone like Yi Dongmu
      was mature and not into playing silly games or talking nonsense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen and Yi Dongmu walk out together, Ji Qing froze. And she
      wasn&#8217;t the only one, either. Many of the other young people who had
      gathered were all in shock, as well. Han Sen was the first person they had
      seen Yi Dongmu invite to join him someplace else.
    </p>

    <p>
      And what&#8217;s more, Yi Dongmu had asked Han Sen to personally review a
      new skill he had been practicing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu was lacking faith in a skill, and he asked Han Sen for advice.
      People were quite shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing was numbed for half the day. She had only wanted Yi Dongmu to
      gauge Han Sen&#8217;s power for her. Her mind was a vortex of confusion,
      trying to grasp how powerful Han Sen might have been if he was going to
      teach Yi Dongmu something.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wait for me, I&#8217;m coming with you,&#8221; Ji Qing said, when
      her mind returned. A thought had entered her mind. If she followed Han
      Sen, that meant she could visit Yi Dongmu&#8217;s house.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing ran really fast to catch up, no longer caring for her
      previously-established look of an elegant lady.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tu Bin, seeing Ji Qing run, went after her, too. He knew he had messed up,
      doing what he did. He was Yi Dongmu&#8217;s friend, but he had not known
      Han Sen was his friend, also. He had tried to put them at odds, to go
      against each other. For this, he was feeling much regret.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Sen, I am sorry! I did not know you were acquainted with Yi
      Dongmu,&#8221; Tu Bin pleaded with visible guilt.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s okay. For old Yi to have a friend like you is rather
      fortunate.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      The foursome boarded Yi Dongmu&#8217;s aircraft, and he flew them over to
      his private training ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu was not fond of chatting, so he didn&#8217;t say much on their
      travel. When they arrived at his training place, he and Han Sen did not
      take their time in starting the practice. They had done this many times
      before, and so a verbal exchange was hardly necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like before, when Yi Dongmu attacked, Han Sen was able to block and
      explain to him exactly what the problem was.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they went at it, Ji Qing and Tu Bin watched them, frozen, almost unable
      to believe how much Han Sen was like a coach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing felt so embarrassed over her prior ploy of trying to get Han Sen
      and Yi Dongmu to butt heads and fight each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, others thought much too highly of their relationship. Yi Dongmu
      believed Han Sen to be his mirror image. It was easy to spot the flaws of
      others, but acknowledging and correcting your own was always a trial.
      Therefore, finding someone you could consider your mirror image was very
      fortunate.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if you weren&#8217;t on the same level, you couldn&#8217;t be a mirror
      image. This was just like Bo Ya Zi Qi. People had to be on the same level
      as you to acknowledge and understand your flaws.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing and Tu Bin were not on his level yet, and so they did not
      understand this concept. They merely believed Han Sen had a simple power
      advantage, and that made him a suitable coach to teach and train Yi
      Dongmu. And that student, the revered Yi Dongmu they cherished, was
      listening like a little child. They could hardly believe this was the cold
      and cool Yi Dongmu they had practically worshiped moments before.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is my brother-in-law that strong?&#8221; Ji Qing observed Han Sen
      with a complicated expression, not daring to underestimate him as she had
      earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while of watching them work, she started to believe Han Sen really
      was brilliant. Yi Dongmu&#8217;s practice of assassination skills put much
      focus on one&#8217;s mental fortitude, and for Han Sen to challenge it
      without an issue was remarkable. It showed her how frightening a foe he
      could be.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Brother-in-law is so cool,&#8221; Ji Qing thought.</p>
