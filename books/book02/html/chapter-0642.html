<h3>Chapter 642</h3>

<p>It was a female spirit. She was clad in chiffon armor, which highlighted her pair of gorgeous legs. She had sharp ears and a pair of wings on her back, shaped like those of a butterfly. Her eyes were purple, like little amethysts. The spirit was beautiful like an elf.</p>

<p>When Wang Yuhang turned to look at the elf-like spirit, he presented a wry smile and said, &#8220;Only now do I regret the opportunity that was given, to try to tackle this place alone. Would I have beaten her, this stunning spirit might have been mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Little Uncle is interested in a little competition, how about we both go now and see who first achieves ownership of the spirit.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, the Wang family does not disregard what they have already stated. This one is all you, Little Han.&#8221; Wang Yuhang waved his hand as he talked.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not wait around. Immediately, he ran directly into the center of the spirit hall. The spirit watched Han Sen come at her, and without any hesitation, rushed to meet him.</p>

<p>The creatures had all fallen back, so it was just the spirit left, willing to fight to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Han Sen preferred not tangling with her himself, so he summoned Princess Yin and Princess Yang. He let them deal with the spirit, while he went on, racing towards the spirit statue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy smokes! Twin-beauty spirits?!&#8221; When Wang Yuhang saw the Yin Princess and Yang Princess, his eyes went wider than those of a bull, and his mouth dropped open.</p>

<p>The elf spirit wanted to go after Han Sen but found herself suitably suppressed by the Twin Spirit that had been loosed upon her. Quickly, Han Sen reached the spirit statue and snatched the spirit stone from its forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, Empty Spirit, am willing to submit and offer absolute loyalty to a new master. I will become a faithful servant from now until eternity.&#8221; The elf-like spirit gave up the fight, knelt before Han Sen, and spoke her vow.</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang froze up after witnessing it. He just stood there, watching Han Sen effortlessly place the spirit stone onto the Empty Spirit Princess&#8217;s forehead. In a blinding light birthed from the stone, the Empty Spirit Princess disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Han&#8230; nay, for I should say, Brother Han&#8230; you are incredible. How did you accomplish that? I can only surmise there may be a thing or two you can teach me. I have been attempting to earn a sexy, princess-class spirit for myself and have never been able to.&#8221; Wang Yuhang approached, placing his hand on Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder. His face was beaming with happiness, and the look of a mature elder quickly dissipated.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all down to luck,&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Luck is a fickle mistress. I pray for good fortune every day, and especially before I assault a royal shelter. I&#8217;ll even shower before that, as well. But every spirit I have encountered so far has chosen to self-destruct when given the spirit stone.&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s face looked disheartened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Uncle, I am regretfully unable to help you with that.&#8221; Han Sen gave him a face that looked like he wanted to help, but due to the circumstances, could not.</p>

<p>&#8220;For truth? Then, perhaps you can teach me of a finer way I may ensure a capture? Or perhaps, if you were willing to sell one of your spirits, I would most certainly be willing to buy.&#8221; Wang Yuhang almost had saliva drooling from the corners of his mouth as he made the suggestion. His eyes continued to drift towards Princess Yin and Princess Yang. He almost seemed obsessed with the need for one, and he continued his dialogue, saying, &#8220;You can sell me as many as you&#8217;d like; money is of no concern to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Uncle, how about this? The next time you locate a spirit you would like, call me. I will help you get the spirit stone. With my luck, there is a 90% chance I will be able to obtain it for you.&#8221; Han Sen then quickly returned Princess Yin and Princess Yang.</p>

<p>Han Sen had spent a long time trying to defeat and obtain the Twin Spirit, so he would never contemplate selling them. Furthermore, he often called upon them both to massage his shoulders and make him feel good. Plus, with the Crystal Palace being so big, the services of Yin and Yang were of great help to the Snow-Lady in keeping it operational. Han Sen felt it was undermanned as it was, so he didn&#8217;t want to sell them even if he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;That works for me. In that case, my future happiness rests firmly upon your shoulders.&#8221; Wang Yuhang licked his lips, and the way he held himself looked as if he was trying to hide his disappointment at not being able to purchase the Twin Spirit.</p>

<p>But Wang Yuhang was comforted by Han Sen&#8217;s willingness to help him with a spirit stone, the next time he located a spirit he wanted. After witnessing the Yin and Yang Princesses in action, and watching Han Sen claim fealty from the Empty Princess, Wang Yuhang regarded him as some sort of lucky goddess. Repeatedly, he grabbed his hand and wished for greater fortune, not letting go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem, Little Uncle, what year is this? Alay your superstitious beliefs for one minute.&#8221; Han Sen felt it strange to have his hand vigorously shaken and almost worshipped by such a big man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Han, you are young, yet you are a repeated recipient of good fortune. You do not know the pains of someone who must live their life as a thrall to the nasty pangs of unluckiness. I will let you know that your big brother – that would be me – is such a thrall. This ill fortune has plagued my lifetime, extending all the way back to my school days, when we separated seats in our classrooms. There were twenty-five boys and twenty-three girls in my year. Traditionally, one boy and one girl would share a desk. But the two additional boys would have to sit together, and as luck would have had it, I was one of those boys. I never sat next to a girl once during my time growing up.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Wang Yuhang recited his tragic school time story, tears welled up in his eyes. But Han Sen couldn&#8217;t say anything before he continued talking. &#8220;And when we played games, I&#8217;d always be grouped with a boy. And my desk partner was frequently absent, too, which meant I had to spend many days grouped with my teacher. You don&#8217;t know my pain, brother! You don&#8217;t know my pain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And after leaving school, growing up, I never once won the lottery. I have never won a card game. If I go to hunt small monsters, I can guarantee you I will somehow summon a stampede of vicious, hungry, big bloodthirsty monsters. When I kill creatures, I never receive their beast souls. When I get a spirit stone, services of the spirit are never offered. I previously accepted my fate for that which it was&#8230; until today. After meeting you, I know I have located my savior.&#8221; Wang Yuhang was dribbling snot and tears, as he vigorously stroked Han Sen&#8217;s hand. It was like he had been single for thirty years and was now meeting a woman that was willing to give him the time of day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; Little Uncle? I just remembered I have some&#8230; uh, business that I must attend to&#8230; away from here. How about we continue this discussion another time?&#8221; Han Sen felt awkward.</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang was a person who was super-duper unlucky. Han Sen thought he should be as far removed from him as possible, lest his own luck be poisoned by his proximity.</p>

<p>But Wang Yuhang was still tightly gripping his hand, as if he&#8217;d found a soulmate. He looked eager to relay to Han Sen his entire life story.</p>

<p>Han Sen tugged and pulled his hand back a few times, but Wang Yuhang did not budge.</p>

<p>Roar!</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a loud roar shook the ground. Han Sen felt a buzzing noise in his head, and he almost fell over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s face changed. Not only he had sensed the danger, but the silver fox, too. It hissed and growled as it looked around in alarm.</p>

<p>Han Sen quickly exited the spirit hall. Wang Yuhang was shaken from his miserable daze and followed him closely.</p>

<p>They both looked to the skies. What they saw petrified them.</p>

<p>After Han Sen collected the spirit, the creatures of the island had all left. But one remained in the darkened sky. It broke through the clouds, heading directly to Mystery Island.</p>

<p>The skies burned a fiery red and the atmosphere of terror was enough to suffocate a person. A second later, the scary shadow crash-landed in the metal shelter, shaking the entire island. Twenty meters away from them, a monster with eyes of fire stared them down.</p>
