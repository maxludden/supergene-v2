<p>“Han Sen, although I do not want to kill you, for Wan’er,
whoever stops me must die. If you have any last words, you should
say them now. For Wan’er’s sake, if it does not get in my way, I
will let you finish it.” Qin Xiu was looking at Wan’er as he
spoke.</p>
<p>“I want you to die.” The power in Han Sen’s body madly exploded.
He stopped trying to get away from Qin Xiu. He used his power to
push Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>“That is a shame,” Qin Xiu said with a sigh. He held Han Sen’s
fist. His hand suddenly used power to punch Han Sen in the chest.
It made Han Sen’s body fly away.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was like an asteroid traveling through space. It
struck a planet and then another planet. In the end, he hit a final
planet. He made no more sound. It was unknown how many systems he
had traveled.</p>
<p>After Han Sen disappeared, Wan’er’s body was glowing with a
golden light. She turned into golden-hair lady mode and woke up
from her slumber.</p>
<p>“Big Brother…” After her eyes opened, Wan’er saw Qin Xiu.
Although she was still in golden-hair mode, she was not raging. Her
voice sounded so sweet.</p>
<p>“Wan’er… Hang on a bit longer… Big brother will take you back…”
Qin Xiu stroked Wan’er’s golden hair. His eyes looked like they
were drunk.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Wan’er said with a nod. She closed her eyes and leaned
against Qin Xiu’s chest.</p>
<p>“God, today no one will be able to stop me. Give it up…” Qin Xiu
was holding Wan’er. He raised his head to peer upon the geno hall.
His body glowed with a red flame. He crushed the very light of the
geno hall and almost extinguished it entirely.</p>
<p>The geno hall, which had never fallen, was being suppressed by
that scary power. The walls cracked like dragonflies. The whole of
the geno hall was starting to crumble apart.</p>
<p>When the geno hall fell, the disasters plaguing the entire
universe were worse. It was not just affecting normal creatures
either. Even King class elites were significantly affected. The
entire world was in bad shape. It was like the universe was going
to experience a big bang.</p>
<p>God stood before the geno hall, but he was unable to withstand
the suppression of the blood power. The holy light on his body was
becoming weaker. The race lanterns of the geno hall were becoming
dimmer. It was like they would be put out any second. The spirits
were charcoal. Everything was dying. The faces of Sky Palace Leader
and all the other elites looked like dust. Although they wanted to
fight, they could not reclaim the battle. They could barely protect
themselves. In the shine of the red flame, their bodies almost fell
out of deified class.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu spoke to the still-suffering God. “God, give up! If you
are willing to abandon the geno hall, possess someone, and descend
into the universe, you might still live.” “This place is my life,”
God coldly said. “If my life is not here, then what is the point of
living?”</p>
<p>“You are right. I think so too. If your life blocks my life,
then I will have to just take your life.” Qin Xiu stepped forward.
A sky full of blood light was marching alongside him. It broke the
roof of the geno hall. Stone pillars cracked. Many race lanterns
were almost put out inside that hall. The geno hall was unstable.
It was as if it was going to break any second.</p>
<p>God’s body’s holy light was crushed. It was almost put out. Even
the bodies of the God Spirits were dim and lifeless. They kept
appearing and disappearing. It was like they were preparing to
go.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Many light pillars arose from space. It was the god palaces
splitting up. They landed on all kinds of god temples. Many god
lights arose from the god temples. They went through space and
melted into the geno hall. It made the geno hall look very bright.
God’s God Spirit body was being shined on by many God Spirits. He
looked bright again.</p>
<p>“If you guys want to die that much, then you can all die
together.” Qin Xiu was holding Wan’er. He was like a demon
descending on the geno hall. He walked there slowly.</p>
<p>Although it had the support of a sky full of God Spirits’ god
power, the geno hall was still unable to withstand the pressure
exerted by Qin Xiu. The god hall kept breaking.</p>
<p>The more the god hall kept breaking, the more disasters that
were incurred across the universe. The entire universe was in
turmoil. Countless creatures died in the disasters.</p>
<p>In the universe, the ground of an old, unimportant planet was
breaking. A volcano was erupting. It swallowed many forests.
Floodwaters rushed across the ground.</p>
<p>Amidst that chaos, there was a totally quiet mountain. All those
disasters did not affect that small mountain.</p>
<p>There was a broken house on the small mountain’s peak. Behind
the house, there was a garden with a white-cloth flag. The flag
said, “Count all the destinies.”</p>
<p>The white cloth had been dyed red. Between the black and white,
the words “Count all the destinies” stood out.</p>
<p>A man’s body was perched on the top of the flagpole. It had been
pierced through the tip of the pole. He was lying there with his
limbs spread out. He was looking into space while the pole pierced
through him. His eyes looked faithless.</p>
<p>Fresh blood left his body. It dripped onto the cloth flag and
quickly dyed it red. The person who flew out was Han Sen, who had
been punched by Qin Xiu. It was unknown if this was just a
coincidence, but he had landed near that old house. The flagpole in
the backyard had pierced through his body.</p>
<p>Han Jinzhi was standing in the back garden talking to Han Sen
while he looked at the cloth. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The
children of other people can enjoy their lives. It is such a shame
you were born to be a part of the Han family. You were born to the
Han family. If you were just a commoner, you could live safely. But
you did not become a commoner. You had to be famous. This is fate.
It was meant to be. There is a lot of suffering you must endure,
and you deserve it all. I am useless. I cannot save your life, and
I cannot change fate. All I can do is try to make changes for you.
It still depends on you whether or not you want to change your
fate. The people of the Han family cannot solely depend on the sky
or earth. It all depends on you. If you do not want to die and
still have things you wish to do, use your own power to get up.
Walk back and fight for your life. Go and fight for what is left
for you to do in this world.”</p>
<p>The blood from Han Sen’s body bled into the cloth and continued
to gush. His blood had almost run out by this point.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mind was strangely clear. It was just his body that
was not listening to him. He felt as if his mind had left his body.
It was unknown why Han Sen’s mind had become so clear. The quiet
feelings were amazing. It was hard to describe.</p>
<p>“Is this the quietness Han Yufei described?” Han Sen enjoyed
that stillness. A power was burning inside him. The white flame
burst out from all of his cells. The flag burned in the white
light. It was like a torch burning it.</p>
<p>“I knew it… I knew it… This is not the end.” Han Jinzhe’s eyes
looked bright. His whole body was shaking</p>
