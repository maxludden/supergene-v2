<p>It was a shame Han Sen did not find any other true god xenogeneics inside Nine-Defense Palace. He could not do this again.</p>

<p>After exiting Nine-Defense Palace, Han Sen noticed Bao Ying had been waiting for him outside the place.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?” Han Sen asked while looking at Bao Ying.</p>

<p>“The king wants to see you on your way out,” Bao Ying said.</p>

<p>“Bai King wants to see me? Is he going to reveal things to me?” Han Sen tried guessing the reason. He followed Bao Ying to the top floor of the Extreme King tower where Bai King was.</p>

<p>Extreme King Tower was a practice room for all the Extreme King’s kings to use. Aside from the king, no one could make use of it. Not even their closest allies, wives, or children were permitted access.</p>

<p>Yet, Bai King had been willing to meet him in that place. If that was true, something was definitely going to happen.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew that it was unlikely for him to be capable of defeating Bai King as he was, but he was confident that he had the chops to escape. He carefully entered the Extreme King Tower.</p>

<p>Bao Ying did not follow because she did not have permission to set foot inside Extreme King Tower.</p>

<p>Extreme King Tower’s furnishings were fairly simple. The inner area was made of stone. It looked like yellow jade. It gave people a warm and relaxed feeling. It was a totally different architectural style to the rest of the Extreme King’s places.</p>

<p>There were no exotic xenogeneics around. Nor were there any powerful treasures lying about. One could not even see xenogeneic materials there. The furnishing were all very simple.</p>

<p>Han Sen walked to the Extreme King Tower’s top floor, but he did not see anything special along the way.</p>

<p>“Holy Baby is here! Come in!” Bai King’s voice boomed from the top floor. The closed stone gate opened.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw Bai King sitting upon a yellow jade stone. He was wearing casual clothing. If his presence hadn’t been so special, would not have been able to tell that the person before them was the leader of the Extreme King.</p>

<p>“Sit down.” Bai King pointed at the stone chair next to him.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not mind this, so he sat down as he asked, “My King, why have you asked to see me?”</p>

<p>Bai King smiled at Han Sen. “Today, I have come looking for you because there is something I need your help with.”</p>

<p>“I am very weak, so how can I help?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“You should know that I have many sons and daughters. Although they are not all talented, they are not bad. So, there is something that has really annoyed me about this. If you were me, which son or daughter would you give the throne to?” Bai King seemed to be very troubled. He was holding his jaw.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked. “This is a big matter that concerns the whole of the Extreme King. I am just an outsider. I should be holding my tongue!”</p>

<p>Han Sen did not expect Bai King to ask him about that.</p>

<p>“You are my only student, so you are not an outsider,” Bai King casually said. “There is no need to worry. Just tell me how you feel.”</p>

<p>After thinking for a moment, Han Sen said, “I do not really know much about your sons and daughters, but I have heard the most talented one is Bai Wuchang whereas the smartest one is Bai Wanjie.”</p>

<p>When Han Sen said that, an evil thought crossed his mind. They were two biological brothers that had the same mother and same father. If Bai King was really going to choose one of them, there was every chance they would end up fighting for the throne.</p>

<p>Bai King seemed to see through what Han Sen was thinking. He squinted his eyes, looked at Han Sen, and said, “I am not allowing you to decide, so you can ask me a harder question. You just need to tell me who you would choose if you had to pick.”</p>

<p>“If it was me, I would select Bai Wanjie.” Han Sen knew being evil and manipulative with Bai King would not work. So, he just answered him straight.</p>

<p>“Why?” Bai King looked at Han Sen with interest.</p>

<p>“Bai Wanjie is already a crown prince,” Han Sen said. “If you select another crown prince, there is bound to be trouble. Plus, Bai Wanjie is very successful already.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said Bai Wuchang is more talented,” Bai King said. “Why not pick him?”</p>

<p>“It does not matter how talented someone is as a fighter. He might be strong, but that does not mean he can manage an entire nation. Compared to Bai Wanjie, I would say Bai Wanjie is a better manager.” In fact, that was how Han Sen really felt. He was not a qualified manager either, so his own affairs were messy. Fortunately, Zero, Little Angel, Huangfu Jing, Qin Xuan, and the others were helping him. Without their help, it would be hard for him to maintain order whether he was in Planet Eclipse or Space Garden. A lot of problems would easily arise without them.</p>

<p>Bai King nodded and stopped talking about it. He paused and said, “Right now, Wanjie and Wuchang and a few other sons and daughters are deified. I am planning to open the Starter King’s Land for them to practice inside, but Starter King’s Land is very dangerous. Even by leveling up to deified, venturing there does not mean they are guaranteed to return. So, I need people to protect them. When their lives are threatened, you must ensure they live.”</p>

<p>“There are countless Extreme King elites. Aren’t there many true god elites to? Just send any.” Han Sen knew Bai King wanted him to babysit them, but he did not want to go babysitting.</p>

<p>“I can find a way to protect them, but that would ensure they depend on their bodyguards,” Bai King said with a laugh. “It will hamper their practice, so it must be you.”</p>

<p>“I definitely cannot do this. With the little power I have, I can barely protect myself. How am I supposed to protect them?” Han Sen shook his head. In the time he had, he would prefer to kill a few more xenogeneics to fill up his deified gene tally.</p>

<p>“You can, and that is because you are Dollar,” Bai King said with a smile.</p>

<p>With a wry smile, Han Sen thought “Ah, you were able to tell I was Dollar.” He did not admit it, but he did not deny it. “Why are you giving such an important task to an outsider like me?” he asked. “Aren’t you worried about me protecting them but failing in some capacity? Then all your sons and daughters would end up dead.”</p>

<p>“That won’t happen,” Bai King said with certainty. “I know you wouldn’t do something like that.”</p>

<p>Han Sen did not know what to say. He did not know why Bai King was this confident and being so nice.</p>

<p>Bai King paused, smiled, and said, “Even if they all end up dead, I can make a few more babies. I am not that old yet.”</p>

<p>Han Sen was speechless. He could not refuse this task, so he accepted it. After all, he had taken so many goodies from Bai King, so it was hard to refuse the offer.</p>

<p>Aside from protecting the sons and daughters, Bai King told Han Sen that he could also practice in Starter King’s Land. This would help Han Sen level up.</p>

<p>Han Sen was confused about that, so he just nodded.</p>
