    <p>
      &#8220;Scabbard?&#8221; Han Sen was unsure what he meant. Qin Xuan was
      only seeking to learn a new sword skill; it wasn&#8217;t as if she was
      being melted down and reforged into a blade herself. What scabbard?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The most important aspect of Empirical Sword lies in the
      ruler&#8217;s heart. If there is no heart, there can be no sword. But this
      heart&#8230;&#8221; Qin Taixuan sighed and then continued to say,
      &#8220;The absolute power is dependent on the heart. If the heart sinks,
      so too does the power. She needs a person to keep her feeling as if she
      were in danger. She needs a person who gives her purpose to proceed and
      strive ever forward, not to remain where she is and be content. Only that
      can sharpen the sword, the sword that will be sheathed inside the scabbard
      you will embody.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Why me?&#8221; Han Sen asked with confusion.</p>

    <p>
      There were many elites in the Qin family, so Han Sen did not understand
      why Qin Taixuan wanted him to be the scabbard. He was an outsider, and no
      one else in the Qin family even knew about him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you do not know the heart, how can you be the scabbard?&#8221;
      Qin Taixuan said, while staring at Han Sen. He continued, &#8220;Tell me
      your name, kid. I can only suppose you are someone special.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Taixuan believed Han Sen to hail from a big family, if he indeed
      possessed such wisdom. The kid intrigued him very much and so, he wanted
      to confirm his identity before allowing him to become the scabbard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hesitated for a moment, and then said, &#8220;I am Han Sen. I am a
      subordinate of Team Qin. Now I am Captain of the Special Squad. If I can
      help Team Qin, I will do whatever I am able to.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are Han Sen?&#8221; Qin Taixuan looked at him in a strange way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Taixuan had heard Han Sen&#8217;s name before, but not through his
      achievements. It was because he was the son-in-law of Ji Ruozhen, and had
      a blood relation with the Luo family.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes. If you need me, give me a call.&#8221; Han Sen nodded, as
      there was nothing else he could say. And there was nothing else he could
      do to prove he was indeed Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Have you joined the Luo family?&#8221; Qin Taixuan wore a serious
      look.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;My surname is Han, not Luo,&#8221; Han Sen replied.</p>

    <p>
      Qin Taixuan&#8217;s expression was complex, and after a brief time of
      silence elapsed between the two, he said to Han Sen, &#8220;Qin Xuan will
      be depending on you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What should I do?&#8221; Han Sen was not sure what was needed to be
      a good scabbard.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Spend time practicing with her. Beat her, but not too
      harshly,&#8221; Qin Taixuan said this and prepared to leave.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;How can I contact you?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;My name is Qin Taixuan,&#8221; he answered.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, and in his heart, he thought to himself, &#8220;The
      demigod Qin Taixuan? It is no wonder he is so powerful. I am afraid he
      already went easy on me. If he didn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t be standing
      here with a modicum of health remaining.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Qin, there is something I must ask.&#8221; Han Sen felt
      embarrassed.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Qin Taixuan looked at Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Qin Xuan does not know who I am; could you please not tell her? If
      you told her, I can only suspect she will become mad.&#8221; Han Sen bore
      a wry smile.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221; Qin Taixuan nodded.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Old Qin.&#8221; Han Sen was now beaming with happiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen departed, Qin Taixuan looked puzzled. He thought to himself,
      &#8220;I hope he does not join the Luo family. A person like that, joining
      them? It would either be the luckiest thing or the worst thing for the
      Alliance.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Great Grandpa, what were you doing with my coach?&#8221; Qin Xuan
      finally saw him return and asked the question as quickly as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nothing. I was just testing him. I wanted to see if he was
      sufficiently qualified to teach my cute, great granddaughter. He is
      alright.&#8221; Qin Taixuan smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why would you not allow me to see?&#8221; Qin Xuan looked as if she
      didn&#8217;t entirely trust what he had to say.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Taixuan merely squinted and said, &#8220;Do you want to stand around
      here all day chatting, or do you want to come home with me so that I can
      show you the true Empirical Sword?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can learn it?&#8221; Qin Xuan looked surprised, not expecting to
      be allowed to learn it so soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Empirical Sword she had previously learnt was just a skill. The hyper
      geno art was forbidden from the family, and without Qin Taixuan&#8217;s
      permission, she wouldn&#8217;t even be allowed to look upon it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Remember this; to not fight is the most oppressive thing you can
      do. To learn this without heeding that will only harm you,&#8221; Qin
      Taixuan said, with an unreadable expression.
    </p>

    <p>â€¦&#8230;</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen practiced with Qin Xuan every day, and when he wasn&#8217;t
      practicing, he spent his time playing Hand of God. Playing Hand of God
      actually aided the training of his perception.
    </p>

    <p>
      And especially so, since he was going up against bots. Highly-advanced AI
      posed a far greater challenge to him than humans did. The primary reason
      for this was because of the AI&#8217;s reaction speeds, which far exceeded
      that of ordinary humans. The AI always knew when the next lightspot was to
      appear.
    </p>

    <p>
      With AI as your opponents, you would need brilliant abilities of
      perception. You would have to accurately predict where the lightspot was
      before the AI itself became aware, and then react before they did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen chose to compete against the hardest level of AI, one which other
      humans had great difficulty going against. In the beginning, Han
      Sen&#8217;s success rate was low, only managing to get two lightspots out
      of every hundred. And even those times were through guesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as Han Sen became more powerful, the number of lightspots he managed
      to obtain increased. After all, the AI was programmed and scripted,
      adhering to rules established by the creators. Over time, Han Sen began to
      get a feel for the AI&#8217;s rhythm, and as he did, his success rate
      grew.
    </p>

    <p>
      After two months of constant practice, Han Sen&#8217;s perception with his
      dongxuan aura only continued to improve. By that time, it had almost
      wholly caught up with Jadeskin&#8217;s eighth sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Congratulations! You have beaten Hand of God&#8217;s super
      mode.&#8221; After getting the final lightspot, the announcement played to
      congratulate Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, the whole community of Hand of God played the
      announcement.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Evolver-class player &#8216;Win A Girlfriend&#8217; is now the
      first player to complete super mode and has been granted the title
      &#8216;Hand of God.&#8217;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The announcement played three times across the entire community, and
      brought everyone to a standstill.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! Is that for real? An evolver finished super
      mode?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who is that powerful? They must be cheating; how can an evolver
      finish super mode?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He must have been single for fifty years, willing to do anything to
      win a girlfriend.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the system can make mistakes. But I&#8217;ll
      echo your sentiments and ask how an evolver could possibly pass this
      difficulty?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people believed the feat to have been impossible. A lot of the
      professional Hand of God players went to search for the identity of the
      player only known as &#8220;Win A Girlfriend.&#8221; They added him as a
      friend and invited Han Sen to play many times, to see how good he truly
      was.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen saw the first request, he accepted it. But later, the friend
      request tone was like a fire alarm. Unable to cope with the number of
      requests he was suddenly receiving, he simply decided to turn on his
      &#8220;busy&#8221; status.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only person he accepted sent him a match request. &#8220;Player
      &#8216;God&#8217;s Third Hand&#8217; has sent you a match request. Will
      you accept?&#8221;
    </p>
