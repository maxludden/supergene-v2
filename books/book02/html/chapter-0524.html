    <p>
      The members of Goddess Gang all bought some meat and beast soul set a very
      low price. However, people outside of the gang could only purchase the
      meat and beast souls at a high price. Even so, there were still many
      people competing for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resources at Goddess Shelter were so limited that if they did not
      compete for it, lots of people wanted it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen planned to sell some stuff like this every once in a while in the
      future. The money he earned would be enough for him to spend in the
      Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen was not really obsessed. He did not want to waste too
      much time on it but want to focus on his own evolution instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was much meat of the golden crab left. It would take Han Sen a few
      days to eat them all. In addition, to eat the same thing every day was not
      fun, and he wanted to change to other food once in a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen decided to take a few days off. When he finished eating the meat
      of the golden crab, he thought it was time for him to try to kill the
      berserk gargoyle in the nest.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he returned to Daphne, Annie ignored him when he went to see his
      girlfriend, not even glancing at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was happy enough that Annie did not do anything. He did not want
      to provoke her and ignored her as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, aren&#8217;t you interested in the ancient language? An
      expert in that area has come recently. If you&#8217;re interested, you
      could go see him.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Hearing Ji Yanran&#8217;s words, Han Sen was immediately excited. He
      quickly asked, &#8220;which ancient language expert? Why would we have one
      here?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran smiled and said, &#8220;Professor Xu is very talented in
      linguistics. Also, he is quite a celebrity in the Alliance. Besides
      ancient language, he has studied a lot of languages from other
      species.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If he is famous, will he ignore me if I just go see him?&#8221;
      asked Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. The management asked him to come over to
      teach us some knowledge about Crystallizers. You could go and have a look
      first. If you have the opportunity, just ask him about the ancient
      language. That should be fine,&#8221; Ji Yanran replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew what had happened. Since the last incident, Daphne did not
      have a chance to undertake a task again. New people were recruited, and
      some affairs were rearranged.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time, the management asked Professor Xu to teach them about the
      Crystallizer culture, so obviously there will be no task in a short amount
      of time. This also showed that the management was paying a lot of
      attention to Daphne.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was naturally very interested in the ancient language. He now
      could read everything in Dongxuan sutra, but it did not mean he could
      understand them. Han Sen still did not understand many parts and he did
      not want to practice the martial arts before he understood what was going
      on.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it was time for the lecture of Professor Xu, Han Sen went to attend.
      Unexpectedly, he saw the fat squad leader and other cookhouse soldiers.
      After chatting with them for a while, he then learned that the lecture was
      compulsory. Except for some higher officers and guards including Annie and
      Han Sen, everyone needed to go to the lecture on time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The language of Crystallizer was too complicated. In other words, they
      were not even words, but more like images. All sorts of complicated lines
      were put together to make an image that looked like the inner structure of
      a machine. It was indeed very difficult to learn the meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even with Han Sen&#8217;s brain which had been strengthened, he felt it
      was difficult to memorize those images. The other soldiers felt even more
      painful. When they went to the lecture, they felt like they were not
      understanding anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it was very difficult to learn, Han Sen was still paying
      attention to the lecture and tried to memorize. There seemed to be some
      kind of a connection between the nine-life cat and the Crystallizers. In
      addition, he would go to the ruins anyways in the future, so it would not
      hurt if he understood more about the Crystallizer language.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Professor Xu&#8217;s lecture, Han Sen quickly walked to the
      professor and saluted to him. &#8220;Professor Xu, I have a question
      regarding other languages that I want to ask you. I wonder if you have the
      time?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Professor Xu was a general in terms of military ranks, which was much
      higher than Han Sen&#8217;s. However, Professor Xu did not have any power.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is it about the Crystallizers? Tell me about it.&#8221; Professor
      Xu was quite easy-going.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I want to ask you something about the ancient language of the
      Alliance,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professor Xu looked Han Sen up and down in surprise and asked, &#8220;you
      have studied the ancient language?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, although the Alliance did not put less emphasis on liberal
      arts, many young people were more willing to spend time on practicing
      hyper geno arts. After all, that would bring them direct benefits. In
      addition, that would help them to survive and cultivate in the God
      century. Very few people would spend a large amount of time to read books
      and study.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professor Xu did not know whether Han Sen had really learned the ancient
      language or he was just trying to kiss the professor&#8217;s ass.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have studied a little bit. However, I have many confusions and
      there are not enough materials for me to clear them,&#8221; said Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;All right. It is about lunchtime. Let&#8217;s work together and we
      can chat in the cafeteria.&#8221; Professor Xu was not arrogant at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen was indeed interested in the ancient language, Professor Xu
      would like to answer his questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was overjoyed and followed Professor Xu to the cafeteria. After
      they had ordered, they found a quiet spot to chat and eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Professor Xu thought even if Han Sen had learned the ancient
      language, he probably only knew some superficial things. After all, Han
      Sen was too young.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after chatting with Han Sen, he found that Han Sen had worked
      hard on ancient language. Han Sen was also quite talented and
      knowledgeable, which surprised Professor Xu. Han Sen&#8217;s level was
      beyond his age.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, do you have any relatives studying the ancient
      language?&#8221; Professor Xu couldn&#8217;t help asking.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, my family used to have an alloy factory. But it was closed
      later.&#8221; Han Sen looked at Professor Xu, not understanding why the
      professor asked that.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, so when did you start to learn the ancient language?&#8221;
      Professor Xu asked again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Probably two years ago,&#8221; said Han Sen. In fact, he just
      started before he evolved, so he had learned about a year at most.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professor Xu was even more surprised. In two years, Han Sen had achieved
      so much, which was very rare. Han Sen was probably extremely talented in
      this area, otherwise he cannot have done so well.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, Han Sen did not have other special talents. The reason he was
      learning fast was that his brain had absorbed the red crystal and
      developed again. Both his memory and analysis had been greatly improved.
      As he remembered more and analyzed more, he naturally became better in
      this area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because they shared common interests, Professor Xu and Han Sen felt more
      and more happy as they chatted. And Han Sen impressed Professor Xu even
      more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professor Xu told some things to Han Sen, which Han Sen could quickly
      remember and understand. He could even discuss with Professor Xu or raise
      a deeper question, which made Professor Xu appreciate Han Sen a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the two were chatting, they forgot to eat. In the end, their food had
      gone cold, and they were the only two persons left in the cafeteria. When
      the cookhouse was about to close, they had to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before he left, Professor Xu gave Han Sen some materials on the ancient
      language and asked Han Sen to read them. He also told Han Sen to ask
      himself if Han Sen did not understand.
