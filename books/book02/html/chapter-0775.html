    <p>
      Han Sen did not move an inch. Half of his body crackled and sparked with
      looming thunder, whereas his other half chimed like a bell. When the
      invisible bladestorm was about to strike Han Sen, he threw out his fist.
    </p>

    <p>
      The combined powers of sonic and lightning channeled through his fist to
      form an orb of light in the palm of his hand. It grew into a silver sun
      and exploded out towards Luo Li with the break of deafening thunder.
    </p>

    <p>Crack!</p>

    <p>
      The invisible bladestorm was like glass, as Han Sen&#8217;s power
      shattered its cohesion and nullified its threat.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the lightning coursed through the air, a chilling noise sounded at the
      same time. The energy flow of Han Sen&#8217;s attacker was distorted,
      which disabled her from gathering the composure needed to effectively
      dodge the incoming danger.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Right before the lightning looked set to strike Luo Li, she summoned beast
      soul armor. The armor and clothes underneath were incinerated by the
      wretched power possessed by the lightning.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Luo Li&#8217;s body was sent flying backwards into the wall of the
      reception area. Her mouth heaved blood as her burnt, tattered garments
      scattered messily across the room. Only a scrap or two clung to her body,
      smoldering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing happened next. There was no counter-attack; she just sat on the
      floor, staring at Han Sen with a ghastly look wrought by her disbelief
      over what had just transpired.
    </p>

    <p>
      She never believed she could lose to Han Sen, let alone to lose so quickly
      and badly. She found it just as hard to accept that she had been beaten by
      someone who had not learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No way&#8230; no way&#8230;&#8221; Luo Li&#8217;s lips were oozing
      blood, as she sat there, muttering indiscernibly to herself, incapable of
      accepting the sudden defeat.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is that all you&#8217;ve got?&#8221; Han Sen looked down on Luo Li.
      He removed his coat and handed it to her. As he turned around to exit the
      reception area, he said, &#8220;Leave. Neither I, nor my mother, have any
      interest in being a part of the Luo family anymore.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Li heard what Han Sen said and her body shook. As this happened, her
      mind stumbled back into the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is that all you&#8217;ve got?&#8221; She had heard these words
      spoken to her many times while she was growing up. That proud and
      beautiful lady said the same thing to her every time she was defeated by
      her hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Li despised that sentence. And she held a further disgust for her
      pretty face. But now she was hearing it from someone else, and in a cruel
      twist of irony, that person was her son.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible! Impossible! He didn&#8217;t learn Falsified-Sky Sutra!
      How can he have such power?! There is no way I can lose to someone who has
      not learned Falsified-Sky Sutra. And there is no way I can lose to her
      son!&#8221; Luo Li was screaming aloud in complete hysteria, but by now,
      she was in the room alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was unsure at what time Luo Li left, but after his encounter, he
      went to contact his mother about what had occurred. He wanted to confirm
      whether or not Luo Li truly was from the Luo family.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Li really did seek you out?&#8221; When Luo Sulan heard, she
      remained absolutely calm as if this was expected. There was a distinct
      lack of surprise in her voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;She really is my aunt?&#8221; Han Sen had been suspicious of her
      claims.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes. Your great-grandfather believed I would be too lonely growing
      up on my own, so he adopted her. I haven&#8217;t seen her since I
      abandoned the Luo family.&#8221; Luo Sulan sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t learn the Falsified-Sky Sutra?&#8221; Han Sen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can learn it if you want, but by doing so, you bring upon
      yourself family business you won&#8217;t be able to escape from.&#8221;
      Luo Sulan sighed, thinking her son had been tempted by the Falsified-Sky
      Sutra after seeing it in action and witnessing what it could do.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, if it really would bring me trouble, then forget it. I was
      just idly wondering, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; Han Sen said casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan, with much surprise, asked, &#8220;You really aren&#8217;t
      tempted to try it?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not really. Auntie had learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra, and yet I
      was able to defeat her in a single punch,&#8221; Han Sen casually relayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan was even more surprised now, asking, &#8220;You really managed
      to defeat her in a single punch?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah, it was easy.&#8221; A cocky smile crept upon Han Sen&#8217;s
      face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan, with a wry smile, said, &#8220;It looks like you have developed
      further than I expected. And, I will say this; do not underestimate the
      Falsified-Sky Sutra. Although Little Li works her hardest, she isn&#8217;t
      bound to the family through blood. That separation means she cannot learn
      the Falsified-Sky Sutra in its purest, most authentic form.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How strong would the real Falsified-Sky Sutra be?&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s interest in the skill had now increased. Although he managed
      to defeat her, he actually believed Luo Li to be one of the strongest
      evolvers he had ever gone up against.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It has the power of a shura. If you ever end up going against
      someone who has learnt that skill, remember this; do not defend. Pitting
      yourself against a person who has learnt it can only lead to two outcomes.
      You either end up killing that person quickly, or you die. Be quick or be
      dead.&#8221; Luo Sulan said this, but it didn&#8217;t quite explain
      enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mother, what happened to the Luo family?&#8221; Han Sen could no
      longer hold his desire to know, so he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you do not belong to the Luo family, there is no need for you to
      know. Knowing would needlessly burden you with greater troubles. If you
      did enter the Luo family, however, you would quickly come to know.&#8221;
      This was a subject Luo Sulan had no desire to talk about.
    </p>

    <p>
      By this point in their conversation, Luo Li had already dragged herself
      out of the base. On a ship, she spoke with Luo Haitang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Li did not refrain from telling the complete truth, and she told him
      exactly what had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Luo Haitang heard this, a strange look came across his face. He
      asked, &#8220;He didn&#8217;t learn it?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Luo Li surely answered.</p>

    <p>&#8220;He unleashed powers of thunder?&#8221; Luo Haitang asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Luo Li answered.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is interesting. It is no wonder he is Little Lan&#8217;s son,
      then. He has indeed adopted Little Lan&#8217;s excellent genes; the ones
      required by our family.&#8221; Luo Haitang coldly continued his speak,
      &#8220;Tell Luo Yin to meet him in the shelter. Let the boy see the true
      form of the Falsified-Sky Sutra. He has the Luo family blood coursing
      through his veins; it will be something he will be unable to
      resist.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Luo Li said, as she lowered her head.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen entered the shelter once more and wanted to get a better grasp of
      his surroundings. He needed to learn exactly where he was and where he had
      to go next.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no! Oh, no! There is a spirit attacking the shelter!&#8221; As
      Han Sen sat in the plaza, contemplating his next move, a screaming person
      came running through. Immediately, everyone became nervous.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A spirit attacking a shelter?&#8221; When Han Sen heard them yell
      this, it surprised him a great deal. It had been a long time since he had
      last heard of a spirit attacking a shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen curiously went to the city&#8217;s wall. He wanted to see what
      manner of spirit had decided to attack the shelter. If the owner could not
      withstand the siege, then perhaps he could lend a hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen?&#8221; As Han Sen walked towards the gate, someone called
      out his name.
