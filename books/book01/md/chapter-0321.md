  Han Sen thought back on the turtle's bite, which was so fast that it was incredulous. With Han Sen's current speed, there was no way that he could dodge a bite like that. He knew it without even trying. As long as he was within the range of attack of the turtle, he would be killed for sure.

"I need to get faster and stronger." Han Sen pondered how he should achieve those two goals.

Heresy Mantra could enhance his strength and speed, but Han Sen had not completed the third phase longevity yet. Therefore, he had to find another path.

Sparticle was out of the question. He had to use a faster footwork. At least the footwork should allow him to dodge the turtle bite, otherwise stronger force meant nothing. He had to survive first. Han Sen did not go back to Steel Armor Shelter. Hiding the spinning spear and the skeleton's daggers in a remote cave, he teleported back to Blackhawk from Glory Shelter.

Gears were not beast souls and could not be brought out of God's Sanctuary. There was simply no way around it.

After returning to school, Han Sen logged in the special squad's platform online. Currently, Han Sen had more than 100 points as the head of special squad, so it should be easy for him to buy several S-Class hyper geno arts. Han Sen slowly browsed all the available S-Class hyper geno arts, wishing to find some that would be helpful to improve his strength and speed.

However, it was difficult to find a footwork faster than Sparticle. After all, Sparticle was already a top-notch footwork.

Although there were many techniques in Panorama, they were all fundamental skills and could not enhance a certain ability significantly. Panorama focused on slow, long-term improvement of one's fitness.

A significant improvement in a short amount of time should be something more like Heresy Mantra.

Han Sen viewed the available S-Class footwork and did not find a single one that could surpass Sparticle. However, Han Sen did not give up but continued to look for it. He decided that he would ask for Bai Yishan's help if he could not find one.

To Han Sen's surprise, after checking the footwork all afternoon, he found a super geno art called Overload which brought him some hope.

The theory of Overload was to make one's body work under extreme conditions that went beyond one's limits. It was to burn one's energy to tap into one's potentials. The more burden one's body could handle, the stronger one's force would be.

It was somewhat like an overlock of the processor or graphics cards in ancient computers. It was to reset some computer component so that it ran faster than the manufacturer-specified speed, from 2.0 to 3.0, or even 3.5 or higher.

However, by doing that, the burden on one's body would be heavily increased. Undertaking the Overload, the body would be inclined to collapse.

Technically speaking, Overload could increase one's abilities without limit. However, if the body could not take it, one would die from using Overload.

Fitness was the key in practicing Overload. The better the fitness, the greater the potentials. In addition, one must control the level of the Overload, otherwise one's body would be destroyed.

Han Sen did not have too much time to consider. Overload was the most effective way for him to improve at this time.

It was even more direct than Heresy Mantra. Overload could increase the speed and strength greatly in a very short amount of time. However, Heresy Mantra had no side effects, while Overload was dangerous to practice.

With Overload, Han Sen did not need to learn another footwork. When he used both Overload and Sparticle, he could probably dodge the turtle bite.

Han Sen used 30 credits at the special squad to purchase Overload, which he was happy about. He was willing to spend on anything that would help him improve himself.

The idea of becoming the first evolver with super geno points maxed out made Han Sen burn with passion.

The geno solution of Overload would be delivered to Blackhawk the next day, so Han Sen downloaded the tutorial of Overload first.

"Han Sen, what are you doing?" Shi Zhikang saw Han Sen in the dorm and patted him on the shoulder.

"Just looking at the tutorial of some hyper geno art," replied Han Sen casually.

"Could you hold on the second and do me a small favor first?" Shi Zhikang asked in a wheedling tone.

"What favor? It can't be too time-consuming," said Han Sen with a smile.

"It's not. It would be so easy for you," said Shi Zhikang with his arm over Han Sen's shoulder. "Aren't you a frequent visitor to the Gladiator platform?"

"Yes, what about it? If you want to try it, you could register an account there as well. The registration fee is not high." Han Sen did not understand what the favor was.

"I have become a member… But, you know, I'm not that great a fighter…" Shi Zhikang stuttered.

"Then you need to practice more. Didn't you register to practice?" Han Sen said.

"It might be a little late for that. That's why I want to ask you a favor." Shi Zhikang blushed and told Han Sen what happened.

"Aren't your girlfriend from the Warframe Department? When did she change her major to martial arts?" Han Sen looked Shi Zhikang up and down. This hunk was much better at romantic affairs than Han Sen. As far as Han Sen knew, Shi Zhikang had had six different girlfriends already.

At this point, Shi Zhikang's girlfriend was in Martial Arts Department and often went to Gladiator with friends. Although Shi Zhikang had great strength, he could not compare to those who were in martial arts major, which was why he wanted Han Sen to back him up.

"All right, I intended to go on Gladiator anyway," Han Sen agreed.
