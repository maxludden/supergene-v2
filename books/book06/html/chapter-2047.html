<h2>Shura Arrive</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2047</h3>

<p>After Han Sen left Planet Sea, he absorbed more of the deified
blood that was on the Blood Feather Knife. He did this every day,
and he felt his Blood-Pulse Sutra approaching its peak.</p>
<p>He kept investigating the Upside-Down Scale, too. He hadn’t used
it for anything yet. And while it was good for evolving his blood,
he’d only make use of it when he needed to.</p>
<p>The AI was relaying news to them, and he learned that humans had
made progress in their negotiations with the shura. There had been
many such reports over the past few years, but it made Han Sen
frown.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never dealt with the shura because of the things he
was told by Han Yufei. He would have liked to get rid of the shura
to reunite the worlds of the Alliance, but after talking with Han
Yufei, he stopped thinking about it.</p>
<p>Han Yufei had asked Han Sen, “Have you heard of the three
monks?”</p>
<p>Han Sen considered the question and asked, “Was that the story
about one monk collecting water to drink, a second monk merely
raising his head to drink, and a third monk that had nothing to
drink?”</p>
<p>Han Yufei nodded. “Humans might hold the most complicated minds
of all the races in existence. It is sort of like how the strong
will devour the weak. Humans are certainly the greediest
creatures.”</p>
<p>Han Sen agreed with what he said. He believed everyone was born
evil, and that the primary focus of any human was to ensure their
own survival by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Tigers ate sheep; sheep ate grass. The grass needed the
nutrients contained in the soil. You had to take to survive. The
same applied to humans, but humans took greed to another level.
They didn’t just want to survive; they wanted more. So, basically,
humans were inherently evil from birth.</p>
<p>“With the shura here, humans have had to constantly fight
another race. But when the shura are gone, humans will only end up
fighting themselves again. If humans are lucky, we will make it
despite ourselves. But if we are unlucky…” Han Yufei stopped
talking. He touched Han Sen’s shoulder. “There is nothing
absolutely right in this world. Just follow the yearnings of your
heart.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen put away his thoughts of destroying the
shura.</p>
<p>If he stayed in the Alliance, then destroying the shura would be
a good thing. But Han Sen did not have the time to deal with
matters of the Alliance, so wrecking the shura civilization would
have unintended consequences.</p>
<p>In ancient times, a few brothers fought together to create a
kingdom. But when they had everything, they started to fight for
different shares. Eventually, they all became sworn enemies.</p>
<p>So Han Sen did not destroy the shura. He did ask Zero to go to
the shura and do something, however.</p>
<p>The shura were in a poor state, but things were in balance. The
Alliance hadn’t totally defeated them yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen was interested in the graves of the shura kings, but he
had never found the time to check it out. Now, he did. Perhaps
there, he might be able to find a lead on Asura.</p>
<p>After all, the Falsified-Sky Sutra and geno fluid came from
those graves.</p>
<p>The shura kings’ graves could only be entered by a king on the
precipice of their death. However, that condition meant nothing to
Han Sen right now.</p>
<p>Han Sen took Bao’er with him, and they embarked on the beetle
and flew to the shura planet. Han Sen had researched the shura
grave, but he did not know where the site was located.</p>
<p>The graves had been robbed once before, and now the shura kept
the location of its royalty a well-guarded secret. It also seemed
as if the gravesites could be moved. They weren’t where they had
once been found.</p>
<p>The only one who knew this information was the shura queen, Jade
Shura.</p>
<p>On the planet of the shura, the shura queen was working. Jade
Ming’er worked next to her mother.</p>
<p>She was the one who was most likely to succeed the shura queen.
Jade Ming’er had learned from Jade Shura ever since she was young.
Jade Shura had high expectations for her.</p>
<p>Right now, the shura were in dire shape. Luckily, there were
still some mysterious powers supporting their race. If not, the
shura wouldn’t have been able to defend themselves against
humans.</p>
<p>“Who is this?” The shura queen jumped in surprise when she
looked into the left side of the study.</p>
<p>A man clad in armor was sitting in one of her chairs. Despite
the shura queen’s talent, not even she had noticed when he
arrived.</p>
<p>Jade Ming’er reached to press the alarm and draw a knife,
preparing to use Falsified-Sky powers on the man.</p>
<p>But the shura queen stopped her.</p>
<p>The shura queen knew that she could only see the armored man
because he wanted to be seen. There was no point in screaming for
help. If he wanted to kill them, they’d both be dead.</p>
<p>The man looked at the two with interest. The shura queen felt
fear. The fright was deep in her bones, and it was difficult to
describe. It was like he could click his fingers and kill her if he
chose to. Sweat started to bead across her skin.</p>
<p>“Who are you, and why are you here?” the shura queen asked him
calmly, forcing control into her voice.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the shura queen and Jade Ming’er. He thought
it was strange to see Jade Ming’er again.</p>
<p>Jade Ming’er looked like Zero. The two looked like twins. Zero
was shaped like a human, and Jade Ming’er was like a shura copy of
Zero.</p>
<p>The shura queen looked like Jade Ming’er, but she did not look
like Zero.</p>
<p>“Is she your daughter?” Han Sen asked, pointing at Jade
Ming’er.</p>
<p>The shura queen felt nervous in his presence. She wanted to pull
Jade Ming’er behind her, but she knew that would be pointless.
Doing that would only expose her weakness.</p>
<p>The shura queen replied levelly, “She is my daughter. You didn’t
come here just to ask that, did you?”</p>
<p>“Do you have another daughter?” Han Sen asked her.</p>
<p>“No, but I have a few sons. I only have one daughter.” Shura
queen looked placid, but she felt like she was going to have</p>
<p>a stroke.</p>
<p>The armored man was showing interest in Jade-Ming’er, and that
made her nervous.</p>
<p>“There is no secret daughter? And there is no additional one,
created by genes?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Only humans use such dirty techniques. We disdain anyone who
uses them.” Jade Ming’er looked angry.</p>
