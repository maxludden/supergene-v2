<p>If Han Sen was alone, he could simply summon the purple-winged dragon beast soul and fly up. However, he had Wang Mengmeng to protect and could not do that.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>The huge body of the rock worm fell and made a pit in the ground. Sand flying and pebbles rolling, it was more terrifying than a grenade explosion.</p>

<p>Even more frightening was that more rock worms were coming out from underground and as far as the team could see, the ground was covered by these worms which were at least hundreds in number.</p>

<p>In front of them were rock worms and behind them were the tide of fox-like creatures. They were besieged by the creatures.</p>

<p>Han Sen and Gambler looked into each other’s eyes and understood each other’s thoughts. Gambler gritted his teeth and said, &#8220;You protect her, I will clear the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gambler took back his mount and rushed toward the fox-like creatures. He was even faster than his mutant mount.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen up. Follow Gambler out and whoever falling behind will die,&#8221; said Han Sen, lifting Wang Mengmeng from the back of her white bear to sit her behind him. He cried, &#8220;Game is over. Now hold on to me and we will fight for our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wang Mengmeng fought well and had plenty of beast souls. However, in a melee like this one, an inexperienced girl like her would not be able to survive. When it came to life and death, only the veterans who had developed an acute instinct had a bigger chance at survival.</p>

<p>Wang Mengmeng hurriedly hugged Han Sen from the back. Han Sen urged his mutant three-eyed beast mount and the bull-like mount mooed as it charged the fox-like beasts.</p>

<p>Gambler was leading the way with one jambiya in each hand. The jambiyas were flashing in his hands like butterflies, slitting the throats of all creatures near him. Nothing could stop him and a bloody path was left behind him.</p>

<p>Han Sen rushed into that path and his arrows never stopped, killing all the creatures trying to gather around. However, he only had fifty Z-steel arrows, which had been used up. All he had now was the beast soul arrow, which could be taken back and used again, but that process was too slow for him. Han Sen had to knock some creatures away with his horn bow.</p>

<p>The rest of the team had also been fighting with every effort, wishing to clear out a way out from the endless creatures.</p>

<p>Behind them, the rock worms were catching up at an incredible speed. Once caught up by them, there would be no other way of survival than flying.</p>

<p>Blood was splashing and they had almost made it. Then the mutant creature that Wang Mengmeng was chasing in the first place howled, standing on a dune far from them.</p>

<p>And then they saw more creatures coming toward them from all directions. There were even some fox-like black-horned creatures that were almost exactly like the mutant creature only with white fur.</p>

<p>Seeing those white creatures, everyone’s heart sank. Su Xiaoqiao cried, &#8220;No way. That mutant creature was not a mutant creature, but a sacred-blood king of all these fox-like creatures. These white ones are mutant creatures. We have poked a hornet&#8217;s nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wang Mengmeng saw the white mutant creatures among others and was mortified. There were so many mutant creatures that it seemed the whole team would die here.</p>

<p>Gambler exclaimed in the front, &#8220;Damn, it is a sacred-blood king. There are too many mutant creatures that I can’t keep going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen said to Wang Mengmeng sitting behind him, &#8220;Hand me your lancets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wang Mengmeng paused and transferred her mutant beast soul lancets to Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen grabbed a rope and got off his mount. He then carried Wang to the ground as if she weighed nothing and put her on his back. With the rope he secured her there.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Wang Mengmeng said, horrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going out,&#8221; said Han Sen in a cold tone. In a red shadow he shapeshifted into the fairy queen and his entire body was then covered in red armor except for his head.</p>

<p>Eyes scarlet, ruby crown on his head and short black hair turning long and blonde, Han Sen grabbed the lancets and ran toward Gambler like a red lightning bolt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gambler, cover me. I will clear a way out,&#8221; yelled Han Sen next to Gambler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got it,&#8221; covered in the creatures’ and his own blood, Gambler replied.</p>

<p>Han Sen had rushed to the front. The lancets were flashing in his hands and each flash took a life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Primitive horned sand fox hunted. No beast soul gained&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Primitive horned sand fox hunted. No beast soul gained&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<br>

<hr />

<br>

<p>The voice in his mind rang non-stop. Han Sen paid no mind to it and just stared the mutant horned sand fox that were throwing themselves at him.</p>

<p>Su Xiaoqiao and others were trying to keep up desperately, but when they saw the number of the mutant horned sand foxes, they were terrified.</p>

<p>Han Sen&#8217;s eyes were red as blood. Moving like a lightning bolt, the lancets were so fast they became a blur. Ignoring the mutant horned sand foxes, he continued forward with Wang on his back.</p>

<p>Holding Han Sen’s neck tightly, Wang Mengmeng was filled with guilt and regret. If it weren’t for her, they would not be under such danger.</p>

<p>Facing so many mutant creatures, she did not know if they could make it.</p>

<p>The few mutant horned sand foxes were in their face, yet Han Sen was still calm. With the slightest movement, a lancet bit into a fox’s throat.</p>

<p>A horned white fox head flew up. Han Sen and Wang Mengmeng were showered in fox blood. Without a blink, Han Sen ran forward and charged the second mutant horned sand fox.</p>
