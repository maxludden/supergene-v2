</div> 

When Han Sen saw that it was a shapeshifting type beast soul, he was exuberantly happy. If the xenogeneic beast souls were the same as those in the sanctuaries, that meant he would become the Violent Ape he had just slain. With Violent Ape’s power and speed, his own lack of power and speed would no longer be an issue.

In his room, Han Sen tried summoning the Violent Ape beast soul. When he did, the shadow of Violent Ape consumed Han Sen, and his muscles bulged swiftly. He grew silver fur all over, as he embodied the silver ape.

Han Sen felt as if his body possessed a new strength. He was incredibly happy, and he was eager to test how strong he had now become.

But there were no geno trees around. He would have to go to the testing clinic for that, but it wasn’t as if Han Sen could randomly transform in front of everyone. This was not a sanctuary, and he didn’t think that the people of Kate had seen a shapeshifting beast soul before. They would probably think he was a xenogeneic and kill him.

“Also, I’m not sure if I can use geno armor after I transform.” Han Sen wanted to try it out and see if he could, so he summoned his Spell geno armor.

The results surprised Han Sen. After transforming, he could indeed make use of it. The armor seemed to change shape to match the user’s body. It made him even stronger.

Amidst Han Sen’s happiness, he suddenly felt a pain his head, though. He immediately felt tired.

“It looks like I am already exhausted. It seems that shapeshifting takes too much out of me, at this stage.” Han Sen turned off the beast soul and put it back. He had only transformed for a few minutes, and if he was in battle, he didn’t think he could use it for any longer than five minutes.

“Five minutes is not too shabby. With this, and the Rhino Horn Dagger, killing Barons will be a trivial task.” Han Sen thought that when his gene tally increased, his time with the beast soul would probably increase, too.

The rhino dagger was good, especially its tip. It was very sharp and able to cut through Violent Ape’s skin and flesh with ease. Without the dagger, Han Sen knew he might not have been able to kill it.

“But I don’t know why I am unable to activate super king spirit mode. If I could, I’d be even stronger,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Han Sen fingered and fiddled with the dagger, appreciating its smoothness.

It was now time for food. He went downstairs for dinner, and he found Lan Se and Qiao sitting at a table, waiting for him to join them.

“Come and drink! We should celebrate the success of our very first mission.” Qiao lifted her cup in a toast.

“Cheers.” Han Sen and Lan Se raised their cups up to join her. Celebrating with Qiao felt good.

“Let’s talk about our reward, shall we? We can sell the body of the beast to the official laboratories. It should be worth at least eight thousand. We can then pay Lan Se for the information she provided.”

“Nah, you guys killed the xenogeneic. You helped me out a lot. Now, the department no longer has to be troubled by this.” Lan Se then paused and said, “If you are willing to bring the whole body to the department, though, you can pick up a hearty bonus.”

Han Sen knew the security department did not have many Nobles. It was normal for them to contract bounty hunters. That being said, the money they’d receive would be lower.

“I have plans for the body. We don’t need the bonus. After dinner, Han Sen should cut it open to find the material within.” Qiao did not want to sell the body.

After food, they went to the warehouse that was supposed to be a garage. Violent Ape’s body had been placed there.

Han Sen pulled out the Rhino Horn Dagger to cut the thing open.

Han Sen was very used to this. He always dug into the bodies of dead creatures in the sanctuaries, so it was a smooth process. For Han Sen, this was normal, boring work. But when Qiao and Lan Se saw Han Sen’s dagger cutting the ape’s bones and skinning the hide with startling precision, they received a nasty chill.

Han Sen suddenly seemed like a heartless butcher. Life was nothing to him. He could kill anything with his sword, within the mere blink of an eye.

Seeing Han Sen’s knife going between muscles, Qiao and Lan Se felt their hearts quiver and shake.

“What kind of man is he?” Both of them thought.

Because the mutation was different in each xenogeneic, Han Sen wasn’t sure what to look for within Violent Ape’s slop. He had to search thoroughly.

Finally, Han Sen found that the ape had a muscle that was different from the rest It was spindle-shaped, the size of two fists. It was red like a ruby, and as hard as a rock.

“It’s a muscle material!” Qiao frowned after seeing the material. That was because muscle materials were the cheapest They were worth 20% less than any other part.

Muscles were common, and weapons could not be made out of them, so no one wanted to pay as much for them.

“According to our agreement, the materials should be shared equally. I now plan to sell it, though, and share the money. Is that okay?” Qiao asked.

Han Sen said, “If you are selling it, can I buy it?”

“What do you need it for?” Qiao looked at Han Sen curiously. Xenogeneic materials were rare, but she didn’t think they could process or do anything with it. They’d need special Noble powers to make anything of it.

“I would like to examine it,” Han Sen said. He couldn’t say he was going to eat it If he did, Qiao would think he was nuts. “Sure. Baron muscles are worth a hundred thousand. If you give me fifty thousand, it’s yours,” Qiao hastily told him.

“I don’t have money. Could you deduct it from my wages?” Han Sen asked.

Aside from the share of spoils, Han Sen still received a salary. It wasn’t much, but it was still quite a lot compared to most “Okay, no problem,” Qiao quickly agreed.

Qiao wished to say something more, but the phone rang. It was Hardman on the line.
