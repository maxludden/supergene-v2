	<p>1690 Laboratory</p>

	<p>Old Cat was shocked. He leaped down from the tablet and ran toward Han Sen.</p>

	<p>But the glove had pulled him away too quickly, and by the time Old Cat reached the spot Han Sen had been in, he
		was gone. There were some broken buildings and paths ahead, but Old Cat wasn’t sure which one Han Sen had taken.
	</p>

	<p>Old Cat stopped. He looked around and sniffed what he could before deciding on a trail to follow.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had been dragged deeper into the ruins by the glove. His legs were simply dragging, leaving two trenches
		in the ground for a wake. Still, nothing stopped the force that pulled him along.</p>

	<p>He was taken into a broken building, and after a few twists and turns, the glove drilled into another building’s
		entrance that was half-buried by rubble.</p>

	<p>It was dark inside there, and Han Sen couldn’t tell what was around him. He felt very nervous, though, being
		dragged in the way he was. But that nervousness did not lead to panic. He’d been through a lot, and he’d had a
		lot of experience with dire and uncertain situations.</p>

	<p>Han Sen fumbled around the dark with his free fist and hit something. The item was shattered, whatever it was,
		but the glove did not stop pulling him onwards.</p>

	<p>He broke a few more items after that, but eventually, the glove stopped.</p>

	<p>The place was dark and still. There wasn’t a sound to be heard.</p>

	<p>The glove was ahead of Han Sen, and then it jerked him forward and up so that he was standing up straight</p>

	<p>“Why did this thing stop here? Is there another glove here?” Han Sen wondered to himself. He swung his left hand
		and ignited a flame upon it to use as a torch.</p>

	<p>In front of Han Sen was a dried-up corpse that was staring right at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>“Argh!” Han Sen screamed, wanting to fall back. But the glove held him firmly, and no matter how he tried to
		resist and move away, his arm remained still.</p>

	<p>After Han Sen calmed-down from the sudden surprise, he noticed it wasn’t moving. There was no lifeforce, and it
		was very dead.</p>

	<p>The body was sitting on a chair, with its clothes all rotten and its skin dry. It was very complete, though, and
		it looked like some zombie in the dark.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked around and noticed it was a crystallizer room. There were crystallizer tools everywhere, far more
		than he had seen in the main control room. It made Han Sen feel as if he was standing in a lab.</p>

	<p>Aside from the tools, though, Han Sen spied the presence of a number of crystal containers. They were full of
		liquid, and things were soaking inside.</p>

	<p>There were animals, livestock, plants, even things Han Sen had never seen before.</p>

	<p>“Is it just as Old Cat said? Is this a greenhouse? A laboratory in their base?” Han Sen thought. But then, his
		right hand moved, and it started to drag him forward again.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was being brought towards the dead body that was slumped in a chair. The glove began feeling around the
		corpse, as if it was searching for something.</p>

	<p>“Shit! Is this thing a necrophiliac?” Han Sen felt depressed, but fortunately, nothing really messed up occurred.
	</p>

	<p>After a while, the right hand found something inside a tattered pocket. It pulled it out.</p>

	<p>Because his hand was being controlled, though, Han Sen was unable to see what it was. Then the hand returned to
		his chest, Han Sen felt like he could control it again.</p>

	<p>And Han Sen could feel himself holding something hard like a chestnut.</p>

	<p>Han Sen took a peek and was shocked. It was like a seed, and it was smaller than a ping-pong ball. It was dark
		grey, with a green sproutling on it. It had a circumference of around three centimeters.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had assumed that the glove was like the crystal shoe, in search of another glove to complete the pair. He
		hadn’t expected it to have been searching for a seed.</p>

	<p>“Does it want to grow another glove?” Han Sen wondered. The glove had done him no harm, ultimately. And the glove
		had now given back control to Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Wanting to look around now, Han Sen pocketed the seed. He could not read the text that adorned the tools of that
		place.</p>

	<p>But what concerned him the most were the items inside the crystal containers.</p>

	<p>The containers looked similar to the one Stay Up Late was found inside, but the liquid was certainly different.
	</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late had been soaking in a colorless liquid. But in that place, the colors ranged from yellow, to green,
		to even blue. Some were plain and transparent, too.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had a look. Anything could have been inside them. Some included armor and helmets.</p>

	<p>Still, everything he saw seemed broken and twisted. It gave Han Sen the impression that they were not yet
		complete.</p>

	<p>“It looks like these might be failed products,” Han Sen thought, right as his eyes grew wide and bright</p>

	<p>There was a container with transparent liquid, and inside it there was a humanoid creature that looked both male
		and female. It had white wings, and it looked like an angel.</p>

	<p>“It looks like Little Angel, but this one seems genderless.” Han Sen observed the angel-looking creature, and
		then looked down.</p>

	<p>“It has no penis. Maybe this thing is a failure, as well.” Han Sen saw the person was very smooth down below, and
		due to it not having any gender-specific parts, it could have very well have been a failure, he believed.</p>

	<p>After Han Sen looked down, he looked up. But right at that moment, the angel creature opened its eyes.</p>

	<p>The eyes opened wide, but there were only pupils there. It wasn’t like an ordinary creature. The red pupils
		consumed the whole eye, but turned to gaze right at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was shocked, and so he started walking backward slowly. The red eyes followed him wherever he moved. The
		head turned like a robot.</p>

	<p>“I can’t be this unlucky!” Han Sen felt glum. Crystallizers made weird stuff, and that thing inside the container
		didn’t look too friendly.</p>

	<p>Old Cat appeared in the lab, and after he saw the angel inside the container, he shouted at Han Sen. “Run! It’s a
		Feather!”</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not react. The angel-looking creature burst through the container, and then the creepy and beautiful
		body came forward to grab him.</p>
