<p>When the god temple revealed itself, Han Sen was a little
afraid.</p>
<p>This god temple was too familiar. It was the God of Wealth
Temple. He had used the Sky God Crown to enter it.</p>
<p>When he went to the universe of kingdoms, the Sky God Crown
could not be used. Han Sen never entered the God of Wealth Temple
again, and he had no clue where it might have been. Now, the God of
Wealth Temple was revealing itself. Han Sen thought it was weird.
He did not know if the God of Wealth Temple was occupied by a new
God Spirit or not.</p>
<p>When the God of Wealth Temple showed up, Han Sen felt the Sky
God Crown shake. It seemed to have been summoned by the god
temple.</p>
<p>The Sky God Crown, which had no prior reaction, was now
reacting. This delighted Han Sen. He stepped toward the God of
Wealth Temple.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy were shocked. They thought Han Sen was
addicted to destroying god temples and was also going to destroy
the God of Wealth Temple.</p>
<p>The god temple was surrounded by mist. Han Sen entered the
temple. The door closed behind him.</p>
<p>“It’s you.” Han Sen looked at the god altar in the center. He
saw the man who frequently called himself God there. He was sitting
atop the god altar with a cup of wine in his hands. He kept
drinking and smiling at him.</p>
<p>“Long time no see. You have been doing well recently.” God put
down the wine cup and smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I am doing OK.” Han Sen knew this wasn’t just a social
call.</p>
<p>God sighed. “You are doing well, but I am not doing well. That
is because I have to keep wiping your ass. Don’t you think this is
getting rather depressing?”</p>
<p>“But… I didn’t stir up anything.” Han Sen put out his hands and
denied it.</p>
<p>Although he was a supreme God Spirit, somehow, he was a very
chill person whenever Han Sen spent time with him. God couldn’t be
bothered arguing. He asked, “Do you think all of this is fine? You
keep breaking the rules of the world. If you were anyone else, a
sky full of God Spirits would have crushed you. Do you think you’ve
been safe from any god spirits coming for you through dumb luck? Do
you think the God Spirits are scared of you or something?”</p>
<p>“Did you help me?” Han Sen wasn’t sure what to think. He was
strong, but the rules of the world suppressed him too much. He was
able to deal with one or two Annihilation God Spirits, but his body
would have been unable to deal with any more than that.</p>
<p>In this world, the power he used was difficult to replenish.
That was why he could not fight very often.</p>
<p>God did not answer him. He asked Han Sen, “Do you know why the
God Spirits have Destroyed, Disaster, Annihilation, and Reboot
classes? Do you know why they have these four classes?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Han Sen said. He shook his head in honesty.</p>
<p>“When God Spirits descend, they unleash a lot of destructive
powers,” God said. “From creating unnatural disasters and those
that seem natural, they might want to punish you or others that
seek to break the rules of the world. Only by doing that can the
universe be kept safe and not be destroyed.” “Will the universe
really stop running because someone can destroy it?” Han Sen
recalled Night God No Moon talking about the universe being a
perpetual motion machine. He had been wondering about that ever
since.</p>
<p>“Of course, every substance has life. It can either be short or
long. The universe is the same. Even though the universe is running
normally now, it is only a matter of time before it is brought to
ruin. People like you keep trying to destroy it. Sooner or later,
it will at least accelerate its decay.”</p>
<p>God looked at Han Sen and went on to say, “If you keep doing
this, I will have to get rid of you. That way, the universe can
keep running normally.”</p>
<p>Han Sen developed a wry smile. “I did not want to do this, but I
can’t lay down and die the next time I encounter grave danger. Is
that what you expect me to do?”</p>
<p>“That is the whole reason I got you the God of Wealth Temple,”
God said with seriousness. “In the future, you can use the God of
Wealth Temple’s power. Just don’t break the laws of the universe
again. If you do it again, we cannot be friends anymore, and I will
be forced to kick you into hell.”</p>
<p>“I cannot beat the God Chaos Party members with just the God of
Wealth Temple’s power,” Han Sen said to God, hoping it might be one
avenue to retrieve answers from.</p>
<p>God did not say anything. He looked at Han Sen for a while. Han
Sen felt uncomfortable being stared at like that. God asked, “Can
you become a dog and bite a dog back if a dog bites you?”</p>
<p>“If it dared to bite me, I would not be opposed to turning into
a dog to bite it back,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>God was speechless. After a while, he said, “I do not care what
you think. You are not allowed to break the rules again, got it? I
am giving you the God of Wealth Temple. You can use the God of
Wealth Temple and gene races to fight. If you use them well enough,
even a member of the God Chaos Party will be unable to rival
you.”</p>
<p>“And let me give you a friendly reminder,” God said. “Killing
the members of the God Chaos Party will nab you some very decent
benefits. The gene race power will help you a lot.” He did not wait
for Han Sen to answer him. He turned around and vanished. He
obviously didn’t want to connect with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Remember, do not break the rules of the universe. If the
universe is getting destroyed, perhaps you can live, but your
friends and family will never survive.” God’s voice was very
unstable. It kept echoing through the halls of the God of Wealth
Temple.</p>
<p>“Hey, can I use the God of Wealth Temple to return to the geno
universe?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>He didn’t receive an answer. He did not know if God had left or
if God simply didn’t want to answer.</p>
<p>Han Sen shouted a few times, but no one answered. Eventually, he
gave up. He summoned the Sky God Crown.</p>
<p>This time, the Sky God Crown answered his summons. It appeared
on his forehead. Han Sen suddenly felt some weird connection with
the God of Wealth Temple. He turned into a real God of Wealth.</p>
<p>The weird messages in Han Sen’s head helped him understand what
he hadn’t before.</p>
<p>Of course, the messages were from the god temple.</p>
<p>The most direct message was about Blood-Pulses. Han Sen knew the
rules about them, such as how God Spirits gave them to humans. It
was quite restricted. If a random human was given any Blood-Pulse,
it would be pointless for the God Spirits. It might have even
harmed them.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen that. He had forced the Feather Fairy to give
Mister Yang a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It was very awkward for the
Feather Fairy. If he was not careful, the Feather Fairy might have
been harmed because after giving Mister Yang a Blood – Pulse.</p>
<p>Giving humans a Blood-Pulse was good for God Spirits, but the
humans who received a God Spirit Blood-Pulse needed to use their
God Spirit Blood-Pulse to develop. The stronger the human was, the
greater the benefits a God Spirit could receive. It made the God
Spirits stronger.</p>
<p>If a human with the God Spirit Blood-Pulse died, the God Spirit
was also damaged.</p>
<p>Selecting a good human to give a Blood – Pulse to was a very
serious proposition for a God Spirit. That was especially true when
it came to inherited god-blood nobles. It might have far-reaching
consequences that plagued the rest of their life.</p>
<p>To summarize, they had to pick humans with talent and potential
if they wanted to give out a God Spirit Blood-Pulse if they wanted
to earn things and not lose things.</p>
