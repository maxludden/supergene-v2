  The centipede opened its mouth to eat the little mink. It suddenly stopped, though, and it turned to look behind itself. Tap! Tap! Tap!

Han Sen’s body was jerking like a poorly-built robot as he slowly approached.

The centipede released a weird shriek. And then, the eyes on its back started shooting out more green light. Its body maneuvered into a semi-circle as it did this.

The green light landed on Han Sen like a spotlight.

But Han Sen’s body still moved. He wasn’t frozen in place this time. A second later, he was walking forward once again.

The centipede let out another strange scream. The green light burst forth from its eyes, shining powerfully across Han Sen, doing its best to hold him back.

Despite all that green light, however, Han Sen was still approaching the centipede. He didn’t get stuck in place, and his pace was gradually increasing. As he drew closer, it became apparent that the green light wasn’t actually hitting him. There was an invisible barrier around him that kept the green light three inches away from him.

That barrier, and the safety it provided, were expanding. It was like an invisible wall, blocking the green light and red mist from reaching him.

The centipede shrieked and continued firing rays of green light. They struck the barrier and immediately disappeared. It was useless now. And no matter how much green light the creature fired, nothing could change the tide.

Han Sen calmly watched the centipede as he walked forward. The barrier grew bigger and bigger, until the centipede was inside it.

The centipede felt the danger it was in, and so it twirled its body into a tighter defensive ball. The green, gem-like eyes were shining brightly.

Inside the invisible barrier, it could still use its powers, but the green light was twisted. The light would flash randomly around the inside of the barrier, but none could strike Han Sen.

Han Sen lifted Ghost Teeth Knife and cut the xenogeneic centipede in half.

“Viscount xenogeneic hunted: Evil-Eye Dragon. Xenogeneic Gene found.”

Han Sen thought that was a bit of a shame. He hadn’t gotten a beast soul that wielded that wicked power. But even so, leveling up his Dongxuan Sutra through this battle was more than enough.

Tzi! Tzi!

The seven red mist minks squealed. They were shining. Their tails disconnected from the plants, setting them free. When the seven minks matured and fell off the plants, their anchors wilted and disintegrated into dust.

The creatures looked incredibly scared. And it was clear that they wished to escape.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to muffle their senses. Under his blinding powers, the seven Red Mist Minks ran around like headless chickens, unable to discern where the exit might be.

“Weird. It looks like these guys are really low level. They look Baron at best.” Han Sen found this to be quite strange. After being born in such an important place and absorbing so much red mist, how could they only be Barons?

Han Sen raised his hand, and the seven of them flew right before Han Sen. They couldn’t escape.

Han Sen grabbed one of them to examine. They had gold hair and bodies that were the size of a fist. Their eyes were big and took up thirty percent of their faces. Their cheeks were plump balls, and their tails weren’t too different from a squirrel’s tail. They were big and fluffy things.

“It is a Baron. Weird.” Continuing to stifle the senses of the seven minks with his Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen then walked over to the centipede. He broke its body and took out the emerald eyes.

The evil xenogeneic’s evil eyes looked rather pretty. They were only the size of pigeon eggs, but they gleamed green like one of his grandmother’s emeralds.

Han Sen dug out each of the eyes and readied himself to leave. The seven minks were eating the body of the centipede.

They were too small, and after eating a little, their stomachs were rounded and full. Their claws could barely even touch the ground.

Han Sen made them fly towards him, to tuck them into his satchel.

After leaving the cave, Han Sen expanded the effect of his Dongxuan Aura. And as Han Sen walked through the mist, it couldn’t penetrate his barrier. It was ten meters wide by now, and Han Sen had no issue with stifled senses. He could see all things clearly.

With his Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen could search through the red mist with great ease. He searched the entire area, though, and was unable to find the spring.

“It looks like I will only be able to find it when the spring actually erupts,” Han Sen thought to himself, as he headed for the valley entrance. He wanted to see if there were any more annoying enemies out there.

When he was beyond the valley’s exit, he saw Xie Qing King surrounded by xenogeneics. He was fighting them like mad.

“Brother Qing, what are you doing here?” Han Sen walked straight out of the valley and asked him with shock.

The Rebate have sent many Viscounts here, saying a decision has been made. The spring is to be shared between everyone. Gu Qingcheng reviewed their documents and confirmed their legitimacy. Wang Yuhang is taking them around the mountains. I am here to inform you.” Xie Qing King spoke all of this while he was still engaged in combat.

“How did they learn there is a red mist spring here?” Han Sen frowned.

Only Xie Qing King, Yisha, and the others knew about the spring. He trusted Xie Qing King and the others. If Yisha, of all people, had told him he should be the one to absorb the spring, then she certainly wouldn’t have shared the information with anyone.

“Stop fighting. Let’s take a look at what’s going on.” Han Sen and Xie Qing King left the area. The greedy xenogeneics wouldn’t want to leave the valley, so they did not get chased. Xie Qing King gave Han Sen a document. After glancing over it, Han Sen said, “This has come from the elders, so it has to be legit.”

Han Sen knew it was the truth, though. Otherwise, without Yisha’s permission, the Viscounts would not have come. “Where are they now?” Han Sen asked.

“They are yelling at him about needing to be led to the spring. There are too many of them, and Gu Qingcheng is worried they might attack the base if their demands aren’t met. She is worried the place will be messed up, and the women and the children could be hurt. So, Wang Yuhang is taking them around and around.” Xie Qing King went on to say, “Should we let Wang Yuhang get rid of them? Take them to an area with powerful xenogeneics, to ensure they won’t return?”

“This is an order from the elders. It is a decree that has been signed by seven Kings and Yisha herself. If I don’t take them to the red mist spring, I will be in trouble. I can’t tell Yisha that I got them all killed.” Han Sen looked over the document, smiled, and said, “If they want to come, let them.”
