<h3>Chapter 2331</h3>

<p>“Master, Bai Yi has entered the Pavilion,” Cher said with a bow
to Bai Ling Shuang.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang was seated on a sofa. Her beautiful legs were
up, and she was holding a wine glass that she slowly twirled. Her
expression changed to disdain, and she said, “Now that Bai Wuchang
has used his pass, the Pavilion only has the statues of the alpha,
the second king, and King Bao. The alpha and the second king’s
statues have been there for billions of years, as no one has been
able to understand them. And as for that King Bao, he was a strange
king. Many royal children have tried to understand his statue, but
they left empty-handed. There is no way Bai Yi will be able to
understand anything about the statue.”</p>
<p>“Instead of asking for a reward that he could use more easily,
Bai Yi insisted that he be given a Pavilion Pass. He does think a
little too highly of himself,” Cher said.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang’s lips tasted the wine. Then, she set the glass
down. “In this world, the hardest thing isn’t understanding the
enemy; it’s understanding yourself. Bai Yi isn’t the only person
who struggles with that. Even with all the elites in our race, how
many of them can truly claim to understand themselves? Bai Yi is
just an ordinary man. It isn’t surprising that he asked for
something beyond his capabilities. He won’t learn his limitations
until he has tried it for himself.”</p>
<p>“You are correct, master. After all, there are not many people
in this universe who are as insightful as you,” Cher gushed.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shang looked at Cher and coldly said, “Your Fox tricks
do not work on me.”</p>
<p>“I apologize,” Cher said immediately.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang waved her hand, and she was about to respond
when a look of shock crossed her face. She went to the balcony and
looked up into the sky.</p>
<p>From another planet, a beam of light was shooting across the
universe, casting shadows across entire planets.</p>
<p>“The Pavilion… That is impossible!” Bai Ling Shuang stared at
the light in utter disbelief.</p>
<p>Every person of the Extreme King was in shock as they turned
their heads up toward the beam of light coursing through the
skies.</p>
<p>That light seemed born from powerful magic. As people looked at
it, it seemed less like a king than a god or a devil. The scary
presence was felt all over King’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of all those royals in King’s Kingdom, the light
moved. It started punching. It was the Extreme King’s most basic
skill: Extreme King Punch.</p>
<p>The Extreme King’s geno arts were all derived from the Extreme
King Punch. Even Bai Wei’s Extreme King Final Punch was an improved
version of Extreme King Punch.</p>
<p>But this basic example of Extreme King Punch was shown through a
shadow. It was hard to imagine how scary it was. Every punch seemed
to hold enough power to break the universe.</p>
<p>As the nobles watched those punches, their hearts leaped in
their chests. They were suppressed, and they found it difficult to
breathe. It felt as if every punch they saw was going to cripple
the whole universe, crushing them in the process.</p>
<p>Just watching that power coming from the punches was enough to
put everyone in a daze. Those with weak wills found blood trickling
from their noses and ears.</p>
<p>“This… our alpha… is it…?”</p>
<p>“Has someone claimed the alpha statue?”</p>
<p>“Who… who is this…?”</p>
<p>Almost everyone was wondering, especially the royal children.
Even the nearby nobles were shocked.</p>
<p>It had been billions of years, and in all that time, no one had
been able to claim it. The opening of that statue would shake the
very foundation of their society.</p>
<p>No matter which prince or princess claimed the alpha statue,
this was going to draw King Bai’s attention. If the royal child was
already known to be incredibly talented, then this might be enough
for them to usurp the place of the current crown prince.</p>
<p>After all, the crown prince wasn’t really very famous. The
current crown prince had been selected only because he was the
eldest son of the king. King Bai could boot that crown prince off
his pedestal whenever he wanted to.</p>
<p>Bai Wei watched the alpha’s shadow of Extreme King Punch. She
seemed to learn something as she stared. She followed what she saw
in the sky and started to move, punch after punch. Her punches
started off very complicated, but they became very simple. Her
final punch became the most basic Shocking Sky Punch.</p>
<p>But her body was becoming stronger. It was becoming closer with
the shadow of their alpha.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Some sort of lock inside Bai Wei appeared to have been broken.
Her original body became an astral body, but the development didn’t
end there. Following the alpha’s shadow punch, Bai Wei’s body
continued to increase. She was fast going to have a celestial
body.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just happening to Bai Wei, either. The whole of the
Extreme King—every single person that practiced Shocking Sky Punch
or something similar to it—began to gain strength because of that
shadow. Many elites broke their boundaries, and even King class and
deified sorts gained more power.</p>
<p>“So this is the power of our legendary alpha… He is so holy… Who
did this? Who is the one that claimed the alpha statue?” Everyone
was both shocked and exuberantly delighted by this turn of events,
and they discussed rabidly between themselves.</p>
<p>The most likely candidate, they presumed, was Bai Wuchang. But
he had already claimed a statue for himself. There was no way he
would be allowed to go back to the Pavilion to grab another, so it
couldn’t be him.</p>
<p>Others of royalty were powerful, too. No one could guess who it
might have been.</p>
<p>Only Bai Ling Shuang’s expression was conflicted. She knew Bai
Yi was in the Pavilion at that moment, but she was unable to fathom
how Bai Yi, of all people, could have opened the alpha statue.</p>
<p>“It cannot be Bai Yi. There is probably some other royal child
inside the Pavilion.” Bai Ling Shuang gritted her teeth as she
spoke.</p>
<p>The light that came from the Pavilion began to fade, taking the
alpha shadow with it. Many nobles and Extreme King elites looked
towards the Pavilion. They wanted to know who had claimed the alpha
statue.</p>
<p>King Bai was inside the palace, playing a game of chess. He held
one of the pieces in his hand, forgotten, as he stared toward the
Pavilion.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, my king, on having such a good son.” The
person who was playing with King Bai smiled.</p>
<p>“Teacher, which prince do you think it is?” King Bai asked
levelly, putting down a white chess piece.</p>
<p>It was the Extreme King’s National Teacher, known as Ancient
Abyss, who was playing chess with him. The teacher looked like a
forty-year-old man. He looked quite handsome with his little beard,
but it did make him look older. Despite that, he looked quite
dreamy and light.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss bowed and said, “I do not know.”</p>
<p>King Bai didn’t ask any more questions. He looked in the
direction of the Pavilion, waiting for the prince or princess that
claimed the alpha king to emerge.</p>
<p>Han Sen, in the Extreme King’s Pavilion, was shocked. He’d only
wanted a small reward for his efforts with the statue. He hadn’t
intended to draw much attention, and now he frowned worriedly.</p>
<p>If he really was Bai Yi, he’d have been overjoyed. But he was
only masquerading as Bai Yi, and now that he had caused so much of
a disturbance, everyone was sure to turn their focus on him. His
chances of being exposed were now incredibly high.</p>
<p>“What’s done is done, so there’s no point in worrying about it
now. I’ll just take the item for now.” Han Sen looked at the space
within the alpha statue. The opening had been revealed.</p>
