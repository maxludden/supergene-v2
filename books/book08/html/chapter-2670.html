<h2>Geno Hall’s Message</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2670</h3>

<p>They went back to crossing the wild dunes of the desert. As they
walked, Han Sen continued to spot strange shapes rising out of the
sand. None of the shapes seemed to be recognizable, and he had no
idea where they might have come from, either.</p>
<p>After they reached an oasis, Li Keer told Han Sen, “The
dimensional space here is more stable, so you can open the core
area door from here. You won’t be dragged into the anti-material
world.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thanked Li Keer, then tried to open his core door. This
time, the core door opened like usual. Han Sen entered the core
area again.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to go to the core area because, once he entered,
he would be far away from Li Keer and Exquisite. They would be
unable to feel his thoughts, and Han Sen could practice his secret
geno arts in privacy and safety. He wouldn’t be spied on.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t dared to practice his true geno arts in Outer
Sky. If he had, the secrets of his four sacred geno arts would have
been revealed to Li Keer and Exquisite. That would needlessly
complicate his life, he believed.</p>
<p>So for the duration of his stay in Outer Sky, Han Sen spent his
time practicing the geno arts Exquisite had given to him. Out of
the geno arts in his private roster, he only practiced The Story of
Genes. The Rebate and Sky Palace already knew about its existence,
and if they knew, so did the Very High. There was no point in
hiding it.</p>
<p>And it didn’t matter if the two Very High women saw The Story of
Genes. Aside from Han Sen, no other person could learn it.</p>
<p>Once he was in the core area, though, Han Sen could practice his
other geno arts. But that wasn’t the only reason he had come. He
wanted to practice Heart Connection. If he couldn’t use beast souls
in the upcoming silkworm battles, that might be his only attack
that could deal damage to his deified nemesis, Shale.</p>
<p>In addition, Han Sen also wanted to meet up with Gu Qingcheng
and Elysian Moon. He wanted them to do something on his behalf.
Fortunately, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon had already been
practicing in the core area, and they weren’t too far from Han
Sen’s position. Han Sen quickly contacted them and arranged a
meeting.</p>
<p>“How does it feel to be a pet of the pretty ladies in the Very
High?” Elysian Moon mocked Han Sen with a smile.</p>
<p>“It feels terrible. It’s like I’m naked 24/7. I have no privacy
at all,” Han Sen glumly admitted.</p>
<p>“You have come looking for us in a rush. Did something happen?”
Elysian Moon could tell that something must have gone wrong.</p>
<p>“I have a geno art, but I’m not sure what it does. I can’t leave
the Very High, and I can’t risk trying it myself. So, I want you to
take this geno art and find someone. Have him take a look at it and
figure out if it is useful,” Han Sen said. Then, he passed his Xuan
Yellow Sutra to Gu Qingcheng.</p>
<p>“Who should we give it to?” Gu Qingcheng asked as she accepted
the Xuan Yellow Sutra.</p>
<p>“There is a man called Mister White among the Extreme King. I
have a way to contact him, but with my current circumstances and my
soured relationship with the Extreme King, meeting him might prove
difficult. So, you guys need to be careful. After you have
contacted him, make sure you are safe. And make sure you listen to
what Mister White tells you,” Han Sen told Gu Qingcheng. He quickly
explained how the women could get in touch with Mister White.</p>
<p>Han Sen only wanted to know what might happen if he activated
the Xuan Yellow Sutra. If there were no issues that could arise
from it, he could just use it freely. He wouldn’t even need to
practice it, either. He only had to perform his Blood-Pulse Sutra
in reverse, as that was what the Xuan Yellow Sutra taught.</p>
<p>After Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon left, Han Sen found a quiet
place to practice Heart Connection in the core area. If he wanted
to heavily wound Shale, he would probably need that skill in his
repertoire.</p>
<p>There was also Break Six Skies, as well. Han Sen had some
experience with that technique. Break Six Skies was extremely
powerful, but it was an area-of-effect skill. Therefore, the power
wasn’t as concentrated as Heart Connection. But it was still one of
the strongest geno arts Han Sen possessed.</p>
<p>Things didn’t seem to have gone smoothly for the two women. Han
Sen waited four days before Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng returned
to the core area.</p>
<p>“I gave the items to Mister White. He said he would need some
time to investigate. You can expect a response in two weeks,” Gu
Qingcheng said.</p>
<p>“Two weeks?” Han Sen couldn’t help but shake his head in dismay.
There were only three days left until the silkworm bouts began. If
it took two weeks to get the results back from Mister White, he
wouldn’t be able to use the geno art in the fights.</p>
<p>But Han Sen hadn’t planned to use the Blood-Pulse Sutra in the
upcoming fights anyway, so he wasn’t too disappointed.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Gu Qingcheng about Planet Eclipse and the
situation with Sky Palace. Then, he practiced his geno arts for
another couple of days. When his time was up, he departed the core
area.</p>
<p>“Why did it take you so long to come back?” Exquisite, seeing
Han Sen, felt relieved. There was less than a day to go until the
silkworm fights began. If Han Sen hadn’t returned in time, he would
have been in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>“My friend didn’t arrive in the core area as soon as I had
hoped. I had to wait for a few days before I ran into him,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Li Keer asked.</p>
<p>“It was a waste of time. He didn’t have enough time to figure
anything out,” Han Sen said, putting on a pained expression.</p>
<p>“You really wanted a way for a ninth-tier King to beat a deified
elite?” Li Keer asked. “It wouldn’t have mattered how long you
waited. That is an impossible feat. Unless you can make use of your
treasures, it won’t be happening. And it has already been decided
that all treasures will be barred from use. It is obvious that
Shale will rank first in this competition.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought she was most likely correct. The Very High’s
decision sounded as if they wanted Shale to be number one,
though.</p>
<p>“What’s going on with that Shale? They’re pretty much handing
him the number one spot. Why?” Han Sen asked, looking at Li
Keer.</p>
<p>“Time is almost up. We need to go to the valley and join the
silkworm bout. Let’s talk while we walk,” Li Keer said, and then
she quickly departed the oasis.</p>
<p>As they traveled back across the sand, Li Keer explained the
situation to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Because Shale was born deified and possessed a ten armor talent,
he might become a true god, assuming he had enough resources and a
little luck.</p>
<p>The most important thing was that the Very High man who had
signed a contract with Shale was a very important figure, too. The
Very High seemed to be grooming him to be the very best. They
wanted him to be capable of fighting and breaking open the Geno
Hall. So, even the man’s silkworm would receive the best care
possible to boost the Very High man’s chances.</p>
<p>“The Very High want access to the Geno Hall, too? What is inside
the Geno Hall?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. One of our ancestors entered the Geno Hall and
brought back some information regarding the place, but the
information he provided us was very vague. It was like there was
someone that wanted us to come to the Geno Hall, and I think they
were asking for help,” Li Keer said.</p>
<p>“I thought that getting into the Geno Hall meant you would
become a god. Why would someone inside signal for help?” Han Sen
asked with confusion.</p>
<p>“That is what we want to find out, but we have yet to find an
answer,” Li Keer said.</p>
