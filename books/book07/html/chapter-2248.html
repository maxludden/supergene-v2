<p>Han Sen looked at the blood kirin, and his eyes shone as if he
was looking at a giant, delicious piece of cake.</p>
<p>Now he finally understood how the child of a mere Viscount had
reached King class after being born amidst the bones.</p>
<p>The creature had learned to absorb the power that resided within
flesh and bones. God only knew how many dead bodies had been thrown
into this hellish place over the years; the creature was surrounded
by mountains of food. The bones could fuel the creature’s growth,
especially since some of the bones possessed massive amounts of
power. In such a unique environment, the creature had more
potential as a newborn than most elites from the higher races.</p>
<p>There were so many resources there, and the creature didn’t have
to compete with anyone to obtain them. Becoming deified was only a
matter of time.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t focused on the creature’s body, though. The blood
kirin was a rare being whose essence was defined by blood. It was
the same sort of power that underlaid Han Sen’s Blood-Pulse
Sutra.</p>
<p>If he absorbed the blood kirin’s xenogeneic gene or ate its
flesh, the ascension of his Blood-Pulse Sutra would accelerate
dramatically.</p>
<p>He quickly realized that consuming the blood kirin would benefit
him little in the grand scheme of things. If he was able to
subjugate the blood kirin, however, he could study its bone and
blood powers and practice his Blood-Pulse Sutra in a similar
manner. Absorbing the collected strength of the White Bone Hell
himself would be far more beneficial than simply slaying and
consuming a King class xenogeneic.</p>
<p>But King class xenogeneics were very difficult to tame, and the
blood kirin was obviously quite special. Growing up in the White
Bone Hell had made it savage and ruthless. It was far stronger than
the average King class elite. Han Sen might not even be capable of
beating it. Taming it was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>Plus, it looked like a murderous fiend. Its eyes were cruel and
brutal, and Han Sen wondered if any power could make it obey. Even
if it knew it was about to be beaten, it would rather die in battle
than submit to the rule of another.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the blood kirin quietly, his brows furrowed in
thought. He waited as it finished absorbing flesh and blood, then
returned to the lotus peak where the blood river originated.</p>
<p>“Now you know that I’m not lying. The beast’s cruelty and
murderous nature frighten me, even though it isn’t as strong as me
yet. But if it ever becomes deified, it will leave White Bone Hell
and slay everyone it encounters. That includes you and me,” Fox
Queen said.</p>
<p>Han Sen no longer doubted Fox Queen’s claims. The blood kirin
looked far crueler than an ordinary xenogeneic. Even if it was
intelligent, it still wanted to kill; that was just what the beast
was.</p>
<p>“I’m just a Duke. How am I supposed to beat it? And how are you
supposed to help me?” Han Sen asked, turning back to Fox Queen.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had a couple of ideas about how he might take
the creature down, he still hoped to gain something from Fox Queen
for his trouble.</p>
<p>If Fox Queen had asked Han Sen to kill the blood kirin for her,
she must have prepared some pretty impressive bribes. Otherwise,
there was no way a rationally-minded Duke would ever contemplate
going up against a King class xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Han Sen never ignored the prospect of free goodies.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Fox Queen sauntered back over to the
hellish skeletal gate. “Let’s go back to the caves for now. You are
just a Duke, so you are not yet prepared to kill it. I have waited
many years for an opportunity like this to arise. I don’t know if
someone like you will ever pass by me again, so don’t worry. I’m
not fond of the possibility of you dying. You might be my last
chance.”</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Fox Queen back to the palace. She walked to the
mound of treasure, collected a few items, and then tossed them to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen caught the pieces of clothing and examined them. She had
tossed him a white silk robe, black leather boots, and transparent
gloves.</p>
<p>“Wear these. They are King class items. Although you won’t be
able to access their full strength, they are bound to be of some
use,” Fox Queen said lackadaisically.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t too concerned with modesty or politeness, so he
just donned the robe as quickly as he could. He pulled the gloves
onto his hands and laced up the boots on his feet.</p>
<p>When he put on the robe, he felt a channel of power supporting
his entire body. He wasn’t exerting himself, but even so, he felt
as if he could take-off in flight.</p>
<p>The leather boots made him feel as light as a feather. Wind
seemed to gather beneath his feet, and it felt as if a single step
could send him ninety-thousand miles.</p>
<p>The transparent gloves were invisible once they were on his
hands. It was like they had merged into his very skin, and his
hands thrummed with a strange power. Han Sen couldn’t figure out
what the power was or what it did, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen had just received three King class items, so he was
quite pleased with that. But he kept his face stern and cold. He
looked right at Fox Queen and said, “Fox Queen, you think a few
King class items can level the playing field between a Duke and a
King class xenogeneic like that monster?”</p>
<p>Fox Queen smiled. She squeezed Han Sen’s cheek and said, “Don’t
worry, my darling. I will not allow you to die.”</p>
<p>“Follow me.” Fox Queen walked out of the lesser palace and
headed into the bigger palace.</p>
<p>Fox Queen didn’t stop there, though. She kept walking as they
passed the second palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed without hesitation. It didn’t matter whether or
not he could kill the blood kirin right now. He just wanted the
spoils.</p>
<p>Judging from Fox Queen’s wealth, all of her gear would be top
tier.</p>
<p>As they walked, Han Sen was already envisioning the treasures
that Fox Queen might be about to offer him, but when he entered the
next side hall, there was no treasure inside. The place was empty
except for the rows of skulls that lined the stone walls.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, he realized that the skulls were
actually masks. There must have been a hundred of them, and each of
them was unique. Some of them were very frightening, and some of
them were actually smiling. Some looked utterly evil, whereas
others actually looked quite pleasant. Seeing the various
expressions side by side was a chilling sight.</p>
<p>Fox Queen was eyeing those creepy masks, and her face looked
dark and twisted. When she looked back at Han Sen, she looked all
charming again. She gave him another one of her smiles. “These
masks belong to Ghost Bone, and they were created by the man
himself. Every mask here was crafted from the skull of a
half-deified creature. After all their refinements, they looked
like this.”</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Fox Queen went on to say, “There were a
thousand of these Ghost Bone masks, and Ghost Bone used them to
practice Ghost Bone Techniques. As he practiced, the masks were
destroyed. At this point, only one hundred of them are left. These
Ghost Bone masks possess Ghost Bone’s power. If you can overwrite
them, you can receive Ghost Bone powers when you wear the mask
yourself. They will allow you to achieve the power of a
half-deified being. With these, killing that xenogeneic shouldn’t
be difficult.”</p>
