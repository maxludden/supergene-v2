If Human King succeeded, it would be fine. If Qin Xiu took over Human King’s body and combined with him, he would be able to repair the flaws in his genes. The consequences of that happening would be so frightening that even the God Spirits would be quaking in their boots.

“If Qin Xiu comes back from the brink to eat Human King, even if Bao’er successfully combines with the gene seed, the chance of her being able to beat Qin Xiu would shrink to a mere 50,” God Hall Leader said. “That means it is all down to the luck that governs the flip of a coin. But it does not matter what her fighting experience is. There is absolutely no chance her fighting experience can match Qin Xiu. Her chance of winning will be considerably lower.”

“If I knew Human King was someone like this, I would have made the effort to kill him sooner,” Moment God madly said.

Light Goddess displayed a wry smile. “Human King has been in hiding for many years. We were unable to see anything.. With the intelligence he has, it would have been hard for us to kill him even if we wanted to.”

“It is pointless to keep thinking about it now,” God Hall Leader said. “Let’s just wait for the results, shall we? No matter which one of them wins, we are going to have to ready ourselves to fight. Even if Human King wins, it will not be a good thing for us.”

The God Spirits knew what he meant. If Qin Xiu won, the ending would be glum. But no one knew what Human King ultimately wanted either. Human King winning might result in things faring even worse for everyone.

“Yes, Master.” All of the God Spirits agreed.

In the 33 skies, Qin Xiu’s and Human King’s fingers were touching each other. Qin Xiu’s body had a spirit light spilling out of him. A lot of white mist was going for Human King. There was some red in between it all though. It was like blood.

Human King’s body absorbed Qin Xiu’s soul. It had some weird changes.

Human King’s body was blue. He absorbed a red and white light. His blood turned from blue to red. His skin had a white light.

1

The members of Blood Legion had blue blood and could not refine or practice geno arts. All they could use was their blue-blood power. That was what they used to fight.

The blue-blood power came from World King God. In the geno universe, it was restricted by the rules of the universe.

Now, the blue blood was turning red. It looked like it was showing Human King’s blood going into Qin Xiu.

Not long later, the blood that turned red did not actually turn red. It became purple. It was a mysterious sort of purple color.

1

More and more power became absorbed by Human King. Human King’s power became more crystallized as time went by until he looked almost completely like a purple crystal. His black hair and black pupils started to turn purple.

That purple was similar to Asura’s sort of purple, but it was different. It made people feel more scared.

When they saw the purple light, even the many God Spirits of the geno hall became incredibly scared.

“Perhaps Human King winning will not be a good thing.” Some God Spirits were starting to worry.

The two universes were in shock. It did not matter if the spectators were in the geno universe or universe of kingdoms. None of them could believe their eyes. They could not believe Qin Xiu was falling under the control of a nameless person. It really did look as if he was losing.

“God, this is Sacred Leader. Will he really lose to a nameless soldier?” A scary creature from the geno universe spoke.

“Qin Xiu will not lose, will he?” Many human elites of the universe of kingdoms were confused. They still had hope. They could not accept the concept of Qin Xiu actually losing.

That was because this was Qin Xiu. He was the greatest existence out of all the seven kingdoms. Out of the countless years the universe of kingdoms had existed, only the Wu Wei Dao Palace could bring about someone so great. The people of the universe of kingdoms could not believe he would lose.

No matter how much Qin Xiu exploded with power, he could not get rid of Human King. His power was absorbed by Human King. Over time, his resistance became weaker and weaker.

Katcha!

The black crystal armor helmet fell. It looked as if it had lost all of its support. The black crystal armor was no longer straight and stoic looking. It looked like an empty shell.

The two lights, a red light and a white light, were looking exceedingly dim. They were floating into Human King.

Now, Human King’s body was surrounded by a purple light. He was like a demon god that had descended on the earth. His eyes seemed calm, but it looked as if he disdained everything. It looked as if he expected the whole world to bow before him. He looked at him with contempt.

Eventually, the black crystal armor no longer had any of that red or white coming out of it. Human King did not let go of the black crystal armor’s gauntlet. He pulled it, and the black crystal armor headed his way.

The whole set of armor disintegrated. Every part of it opened up by itself to wrap up Human King. Suddenly, Human King became a shape that wrapped up the black crystal armor.

But it was different to Qin Xiu. His face was no longer covered. He still had a purple mist light of long hair that led all the way outside.

“Is this person Qin Xiu or Human King?” Light Goddess felt as if she could no longer take the manic pounding of her heart anymore. She had been a God Spirit for so long that she had almost forgotten what nervous and confused feelings were supposed to feel like.

Countless spirits in the main and reverse universes were just staring at the geno tablet. They wanted to know what would happen next.

The geno tablet was displaying Qin Xiu’s and Human King’s names. Suddenly, one of the names went out. It was Qin Xiu’s name that went out. Only Human King’s name remained, and it did so while shining.

“How is that possible?” The God Chaos Party was shocked. It did not matter if it was the new members or the old members, and it did not matter if they betrayed Qin Xiu or not, they were still all shocked.

When Qin Xiu became the leader of the God Chaos Party, his incredible power was enough to tell them who was the strongest amidst their ranks.

Now, that invincible existence had lost a battle. He had lost to a person they had never heard of before.

“There is only Human King’s world,” Human King coldly said. Many of the world’s countless creatures did not understand the words he had just spoken.

Still, everyone caught the gist of them. It meant a new era was coming.

Blood Legion was delighted by the result. Many members of Blood Legion were crying their eyes out in glee. They had endured for many generations, with every generation giving their blood to Human King.

Countless generations of people had paid with their blood. On this day, there was finally a response.

Human King had just shocked the entire world. He had obtained Qin Xiu’s body and soul. From now on, he was to be considered the most invincible being in the universe, and Blood Legion was going to be regarded as the greatest organization in the universe too. They were the foundation of a new genesis. They would be a cornerstone of the entire universe.

Han Sen was in the arena. He did not watch Qin Xiu and Human King fight. He did not know the person he needed to fight had been beaten by Human King.

Boom! Boom!

Han Sen had been waiting there for a long time before the invisible barrier finally fell. That meant his new opponent had arrived.
