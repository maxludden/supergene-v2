<h2>Killing Bugs</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2124</h3>

<p>“Dollar, you can still tear up your paper and forfeit. It’d be a
crying shame if you were to be suddenly killed, don’t you think?”
Kun’s sarcastic tone echoed beneath the boughs of the forest
ceiling.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I can end this fight by simply killing you. That
works, too,” Han Sen replied calmly.</p>
<p>“Haha! That depends on whether or not you are able to find me
first. Can you?” Kun laughed once again.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to listen carefully to her voice, but try as he
might, he could not pinpoint the source.</p>
<p>Han Sen quietly used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the vicinity, but
there was no sign of Kun anywhere. It actually made him frown. His
Dongxuan Aura could scan an entire kilometer radius, but he wasn’t
picking up a trace of Kun. That had to mean Kun was a kilometer
away from him, at the very least.</p>
<p>“She’s not here, and yet she seems to be able to see
everything,” Han Sen thought to himself. He looked around at the
small bugs and said, “Your real body isn’t here, is it? You’re
probably watching me out of the eyes of these bugs. Is that
right?”</p>
<p>“So what if I am?” Kun didn’t sound happy about Han Sen’s
deduction.</p>
<p>“It looks like I’m going to have to destroy your eyes,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“Destroy my eyes?” Kun sounded as if she had heard something
amusing. She laughed and said, “Every one of these bugs is a set of
eyes for me. You can’t even see them, so how do you expect to be
able to destroy them all?”</p>
<p>The audience was in agreement with Kun. The bugs were all far
too small to be seen, and exhausting more power in killing them
would only drain Dollar’s energy even faster. That course of action
didn’t seem likely to help.</p>
<p>These bugs are really quite scary. I am afraid she might be
thousands of kilometers away. Those bugs have totally got Dollar in
their grasp.”</p>
<p>“A power that can shrink mighty things into a reduced size is
often overlooked. It really can be a difficult power to deal with,
and it makes Kun a fearsome woman. I bet Kun will become famous
after this.”</p>
<p>“I cannot believe a power like this can be as effective as what
we are seeing. Compared to the fight between Dragon Eight and
Dollar, Kun is on another level of extremity. Perhaps her body
isn’t as strong as Dragon Eight and Dollar’s, but she could render
either of them powerless.”</p>
<p>“Of course! Any Marquise participating in the geno rank fights
is powerful.”</p>
<p>The audience were all of a similar mindset right now, and they
were all thinking the same thing. They envisioned themselves as
Dollar and tried to imagine how they might make it out of the
predicament he was currently in. That being said, no one thought
that they had a sound solution.</p>
<p>Kun had vacated the immediate battleground, leaving Han Sen
under the forest canopy with the bugs.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen couldn’t see those small bugs, and he had no
clue when they might try to attack him. So, all he could do was
keep the high-temperature fires going. But doing so was a constant
drain on his power, and he knew that he couldn’t last forever like
that. And without being able to spot Kun, there was no chance of
him actually winning.</p>
<p>Even Clear Sea King and King Rosa couldn’t think of a way in
which he might turn the tables.</p>
<p>It would have been brilliant if Dollar had King powers. The
powers of a King could annihilate an entire forest, with all the
bugs being incinerated in the process. They’d no longer be a
threat.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was just a Marquise. He didn’t have the energy to
perform grand area-of-effect spells. Even if the fire could stretch
to encompass the entire forest, it wouldn’t be strong enough to
eliminate the bugs within.</p>
<p>The bugs were very small, but that did not mean they were very
weak. After all, the bugs were the creation of another Marquise.
Killing them would require the powers of a Marquise.</p>
<p>While everyone wondered how Dollar might sort out this
situation, the fires that enveloped him were suddenly extinguished.
Streams of smoke curled around him, leaving him exposed to the
insect masses without any protection.</p>
<p>“Haha! Giving up already? If you’re throwing in the towel, then
I’ll do you a favor and give you a second to tear up the paper for
a proper forfeit.” Kun’s derisive cackle echoed throughout the
entire forest.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you I was going to destroy all of your eyes?” Han
Sen asked in feigned confusion.</p>
<p>“Huh? Even facing the prospect of death, you’re stubborn enough
to spew so much crap.” Kun summoned a horde of small bugs and sent
them towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Those bugs were extremely small, and what’s more, they were
completely silent. Not even a Duke could detect them. Han Sen had
saved a lot of energy when he gave up the protection of the fire,
but it also put him in a lot of danger.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi frowned and said, “What does Dollar want to do this
time? Is he going to use his armor to block the bugs? No matter how
fine its crafting is, there will always be a seam. Those bugs will
wiggle their way in and attack through any joint or crevice.”</p>
<p>“He is not planning to block the bugs with the armor he wears,”
said a voice behind them. It belonged to Lone Bamboo. “Brother Lone
Bamboo!” The Yun sisters and Thousand Feather Crane stood up and
bowed to him.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo just gestured for them to sit, and he joined them as
they did.</p>
<p>“Brother Lone Bamboo, you said Dollar isn’t planning on using
his armor to keep the bugs away. But he cannot see the bugs, so how
will he know when they’re near him? How do you keep out something
like that?” Yun Suyi asked with much curiosity.</p>
<p>“Who said he cannot see the bugs?” Lone Bamboo asked simply.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi and the others all fell silent. Before they could
react, Dollar stood up.</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his hand and flicked his finger while he was
still airborne.</p>
<p>A number of coins appeared, scattershotting the area like rain.
When every coin fell, there was a pat noise to accompany it. It
sounded as if each and every one of them had crushed something.</p>
<p>After a minute, the observers recognized the noise. It sounded
like the exoskeletons of tiny insects being crunched. “Impossible!
How can you see…” Before Kun could finish her question, her voice
cut off.</p>
<p>Her real body was not there, and she had been speaking through
the bugs the entire time. The rain of coins had destroyed every
bug, so she could no longer speak.</p>
<p>The audience was stunned.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just because Han Sen could see and kill those bugs;
what surprised them the most was the simple fact he could use that
many coins at once. That meant Dollar doubled as an area-of-effect
attack. It was a scary thing to consider.</p>
<p>“How is he able to see those small bugs? Even ordinary Dukes
cannot see them without eyesight talent. They would most certainly
need to practice eye skills and techniques. Has he focused on
developing his eyes?” Hai’er had been watching the fight, full of
cocky confidence the entire time. Her smugness was quickly brought
to an end by this revelation.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura could trace the presence of any nearby
substance. While the bugs might have been too small to see with the
naked eye, the Dongxuan Aura made their presence obvious. They
could not escape Han Sen’s notice.</p>
