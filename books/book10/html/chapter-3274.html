<p>Han Sen had spent far too much of his power. He could no longer
feel Zhao Ning’er’s situation. He could only see her body get
wrapped up by black and red fires. It was like a demonic cocoon
that came from hell. “Han Sen, are you okay? What happened to my
sister?” Zhao Qiu Yi moved to pick up Han Sen. She was speaking
with a strange tone of voice.</p>
<p>“I am fine. As for your sister, I guess it is all down to fate.”
Han Sen did not know what was going to happen to Zhao Ning’er. This
situation was beyond his control.</p>
<p>Han Sen made the secret decision he would not modify life and
objects that were not his. It was way too dangerous for him.</p>
<p>He knew that what he said would make Zhao Qiu Yi more worried,
but Han Sen did not want to give her too much hope.</p>
<p>At best, even Han Sen thought the results were unpredictable.
Things might go awry. To have hope and then see it stripped away
was awful. It was far better to expect the worst. Han Sen was
powerless. Zhao Qiu Yi had to assist him in sitting down. In case
something else happened, he cast the Xuan Yellow Sutra on
himself.</p>
<p>Zhao Qiu Yi looked at the light cocoon. Han Sen noticed the
cocoon was becoming smaller. It was 30 feet wide at one point. Not
long later, it was 21 feet wide. Although the cocoon was smaller,
he had yet to see any sign of Zhao Ning’er’s body. When Zhao
Ning’er became a god bird, she looked bigger. If she still had her
bird body, he would have been able to see it by now. When the
cocoon was 12 feet wide, there were still no feathers. It helped
inflate Zhao Qiu Yi with more hope. Suddenly, a shadow arrived. It
came one step near the coast. It was Bury Path God, who had just
run away a moment before. “Are humans always that stupid?” Bury
Path God raised his hand. His hands were burning with a scary, gray
flame. He used his palm like a knife and threw a slash toward Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the scary presence rise. It was like he had a
powerful, twisted space. The Demon God Sword Spirit appeared in
front of Han Sen to block Bury Path God’s knife. A transparent and
gray light exploded. Everything was destroyed.</p>
<p>“Ah, so you have come here with the intent of killing me all
because you believe I am stupid,” Han Sen coldly said. “I am stupid
because I am a human, who, according to you, are stupid by default?
Well, killing me doesn’t seem so easy now, does it?”</p>
<p>UOCSIL!</p>
<p>The Demon God Sword Spirit was Qin Yuan’s Annihilation God
Spirit gene race, but Han Sen modified it with the Dongxuan Sutra
and Xuan Yellow Sutra. It was now Han Sen’s gene race. Han Sen
planned on making the Demon God Sword Spirit a sub-god in his God
of Wealth Temple, but he had yet to get his hands on a god base. So
he kept carrying it around with him.</p>
<p>After modifying it, the Demon God Sword Spirit was very strong.
It had a Break World-class sword air. Although it was not solid, it
was still stronger than most Break World creatures.</p>
<p>Creatures and items that were modified by the Xuan Yellow Sutra
and the Dongxuan Sutra would have increased powers. The more
powerful a creature or item was, the harder they were to
modify.</p>
<p>“Do you think a Demon God Sword Spirit that cannot break a Break
World solidified power can truly defeat me?” Bury Path God was cold
as ice. He waved his hand with a gray power.</p>
<p>The Demon God Sword Spirit unleashed a scary and invisible sword
air. It combined with Bury Path God’s gray power. An invisible
sword air destroyed the gray power. The sword air was disappearing.
Even the Demon God Sword Spirit’s body had a crack. There were
small cracks along the sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. After he modified the Demon God Sword Spirit,
it was phenomenally strong. Bury Path God’s wave almost broke the
sword. This power was similar to that of Zhao Ning’er.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen did not see any wounds manifest on Bury Path God.
He shot Bury Path God’s heart. Now, that place was broken, but the
skin was whole. There were no marks.</p>
<p>“Well, I have to confess. The God Chaos Party’s vice-president
really is a powerful dude,” Han Sen said to compliment him.</p>
<p>Bury Path God was not in the mood to talk to his opponent. It
was not as if he could not fight Han Sen. Bury Path God just didn’t
want to take a risk. After he was shot, he ran. In fact, it did not
hurt him much.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen had spent all his power. Bury Path God was not
going to pass up on this chance. He returned with the plan to
finish off Han Sen once and for all. In the process, he would take
Zhao Ning’er, who had turned into a Break World beast, back with
him. He would still be the winner.</p>
<p>Bury Path God stepped forward. The sky and the ground were
collapsing. Bury Path God looked cold. He swung a punch. Wherever
his punch reached, things turned into dust.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt that scary power. He knew the Demon Sword God
Spirit would be ineffective in repelling that attack. He looked
cold. Han Sen was trying to find an item that might save his life
when he suddenly heard a phoenix scream. Suddenly, a snowy white
light was blinding him.</p>
<p>The cocoon he had made was broken. A white light came pouring
out of the cocoon. A lady was emerging from it. She had white hair
that reached her toes. She looked very refreshing. She was like a
fairy. She looked extremely holy. It was as if not a speck of dirt
could mar her image.</p>
<p>Behind her were the white wings of a phoenix. She had a holy
light around her. They were like musical notes. It was like they
were there, but they were not there. It all flowed around her. When
the notes came out, the sky and the ground heeded her loudly.</p>
<p>The phoenix’s cry came from the lady. It was pure sonic power.
It made the gray power’s shockwave tilt and move away. It shattered
amidst a sonic explosion. Before the gray power reached Han Sen, it
vanished amidst the sonic force.</p>
<p>“Big Sister!” Zhao Qiu Yi screamed with shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bury Path God saw Zhao Ning’er. She looked weird. To
say she was a human did not seem quite right, but she looked
different from her prior phoenix mode.</p>
<p>“Is this the real shape of a Break World beast? Her power will
be better than mine!” Bury Path God looked at Zhao Ning’er. He
seemed very excited.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er’s jade feet were naked as she emerged. Her body was
like a phoenix, flying in the sky. She flew toward Han Sen. Her
body emitted a scary light and music.</p>
<p>As Zhao Ning’er flew to Han Sen, her body became a phoenix head
harp. She landed near Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not play the harp. When he held the phoenix head
harp, he felt a scary and mysterious power swirl around it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fingers touched the string. He gathered up power and
tried to flick it. He instantly heard a very loud sound echo
through space. “Blergh!” After the harp’s sound, Bury Path God spat
out blood. His body ripped space. He fell into the rip in space and
was gone. The space around them collapsed. Han Sen was unable to
chase after him, so he gave up the thought of doing so.</p>
