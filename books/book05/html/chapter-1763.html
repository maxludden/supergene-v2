	<p>What height must a mountain reach to be considered a tall mountain?</p>

	<p>There was no answer to this question, just like no one knew how tall Unsolid Mountain was. No creature could
		reach the peak of Unsolid Mountain. None had ever glanced at what lay at the peak.</p>

	<p>Even the highest tier xenogeneics of Unsolid could not reach the highest point. All they knew was that the master
		that lived at Unsolid Line was a real king.</p>

	<p>But two beasts resided at the peak of Unsolid Mountain. The big one looked like a rabbit, and the small one
		looked like a lion. And next to these two golden beasts, there was a woman.</p>

	<p>The woman was very beautiful and graciously elegant. The most special thing about her was the horn upon her head.
		She was like the purest of unicorns.</p>

	<p>She brushed her hand across the fur of a gold beast, wearing a difficult-to-discern smile.</p>

	<p>“How is his blood? How much Roar blood?” the green-haired beast asked, looking at the sleeping golden creature.
	</p>

	<p>“Less than five points,” the woman said calmly.</p>

	<p>“Less than five points? I thought it would be higher.” The green-haired beast frowned, and he wasn’t happy with
		the answer.</p>

	<p>•’丫es, but it could reach ten points,” the woman said</p>

	<p>“What do you mean?” The green-haired beast was shocked to hear this.</p>

	<p>The woman stroked the beast’s fur, and with a strange look, said, “I don’t know where he comes from, and how he
		managed to gain such pure blood of the Roar. But he is very talented and stronger than the usual Roar. Perhaps
		he can grow further?”</p>

	<p>“How is that possible? His body has blood that is stronger than the pure Roar?” The green-haired beast did not
		believe her.</p>

	<p>“He does not have blood that is stronger than the pure Roar, but he has been infused with other blood. It
		provides him with more opportunities, so maybe he will go further than the pure themselves.” When the woman
		spoke, her eyes trembled.</p>

	<p>“If things are really that way, that’s great.” The green-haired beast was very happy, and he asked, “Why did you
		stop me from killing the lesser life?”</p>

	<p>“You can’t kill him.” The woman shook her head. She looked weird. “They have a special connection. I don’t know
		why, but if you were to kill him, it might affect this little guy’s future. We cannot risk that.”</p>

	<p>“But a lesser life can associate with a higher-race like the Roar?” The green-haired beast demanded angrily,
		wanting to kill Han Sen.</p>

	<p>“God knows what he has been through. According to our theory, his Roar blood should be gone. It should no longer
		exist. His appearance now changes everything.” She paused for a brief while, before resuming speech. “Anyway,
		keep your fingers off that lesser one. He can die by anyone else’s hands, but not ours.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen was currently making his way towards the xenogeneic space. Xenogeneic spaces were never what they seemed;
		the space within them was twisted.</p>

	<p>It was like something that looked like a mountain from a distance. But reaching it would reveal that you were in
		fact traversing a big canyon.</p>

	<p>Holy Heaven and Unsolid Mountain were like this, but the degree of their distortion far exceeded that of a mere
		mountain. It was the entire area. But Han Sen wasn’t going to a place like that today. He was only going to a
		mountain, situated beyond a few rocky hills that were a few hundred meters tall.</p>

	<p>But when he drew closer, the hills drew together and xenogeneics appeared. He did not know where they came from.
	</p>

	<p>The Kate across would occasionally come here for a hunt, gathering together into teams. The teams weren’t like
		Wizard, though. They had very few members, but they were all Nobles.</p>

	<p>And in regards to the xenogeneics, they did not often reveal themselves for what they truly were, unless they had
		protection.</p>

	<p>Han Sen put Bao’er in the sanctuary because the geno universe was too dangerous for her. Until he knew he could
		protect himself, he knew he should not risk bringing Bao’er along.</p>

	<p>Especially after what had happened with Golden Growler. Now, he was going to be a lot more careful.</p>

	<p>Han Sen donned his Dongxuan Armor. It covered him completely, and his body was changed by the dongxuan powers.
		Not even Qiao could recognize he was Han Sen.</p>

	<p>After entering the xenogeneic space, Han Sen wanted to kill xenogeneics. But he also didn’t want the Feathers to
		know he was not just some commoner. To prevent the Feathers learning who he was, he had to hide his identity
		with the armor.</p>

	<p>Han Sen rode a dirt bike toward three rocky hills. But when Han Sen reached them, they became mountains. It was
		like there was no end to them.</p>

	<p>So, Han Sen got off the bike and left it at the foot of a mountain. If he was lucky, he could ride it back home.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen walked across one of the mountains, and soon he felt that there was something hiding in the woods nearby.
		He entered battle mode and stared at where the noise was coming from.</p>

	<p>Quickly, Han Sen heard a rush of footsteps. And not long after, something walked out. When he saw the shadow for
		who it was, it gave him a big shock.</p>

	<p>It was a fifteen-year-old girl who had no cat ears. She had no tail, either. She was most certainly not of the
		Kate.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at her for a while. She didn’t seem like a different race; she actually looked human.</p>

	<p>But her lifeforce told Han Sen that she couldn’t be a human. Aside from Han Sen, there were no human Nobles in
		this universe. And that was especially true of fifteen-year-olds.</p>

	<p>The girl did not have any geno armor, and she looked strangely like a xenogeneic. She had white leather armor and
		boots for clothing, and there was a longsword by her side. She had a ponytail and looked rather pretty.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was looking at the lady when she drew her sword out. It was purple like the moon, and with a girly voice,
		she said, “This is a robbery. Give me your eggs!”</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at her and thought that he must have heard something incorrectly. Either that, or he was
		hallucinating, due to his recent lack of sleep.</p>
