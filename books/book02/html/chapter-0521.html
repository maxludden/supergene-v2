    <p>
      The three sails rose at the same time. The mysterious and gorgeous crystal
      sailboat slowly rose from the bottom of the lake and floated in the water
      in a magical way, looking magnificent.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My girl, march toward the ocean.&#8221; Han Sen was incredibly
      excited. This crystal sailboat was much better than a submarine. It was an
      interstellar warship in the water.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Master, do you want to go above the surface?&#8221; Asked Mermaid
      Princess.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, let&#8217;s march on the bottom.&#8221; Naturally, Han Sen
      would not let the crystal sailboat to go up to look for trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, master,&#8221; replied Mermaid Princess and turned the rudder
      in her hand. The giant crystal sailboat suddenly sailed toward the ocean
      following the channel connecting the lake and the ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scenery at the bottom of the sea was indeed incredible. Han Sen saw a
      region of shellfish, which piled up like small mountains for hundreds of
      miles.
    </p>

    <p>
      All kinds of corals were colorful and glamorous. Clusters of fish were
      playing games in millions in the ocean. giant monsters that looked like
      dragons were passing by, making one&#8217;s heart tremble.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, the Crystal Palace was indestructible. Otherwise, if it were hit
      by the horrendous beast, it would be ruined before long.
    </p>

    <p>Boom boom!</p>

    <p>
      A dual-headed turtle that looked like a hill hit the Crystal Palace
      several times before it went away slowly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The number of the creatures inside the ocean was beyond Han Sen&#8217;s
      imagination. However, he did not know what the status of those creatures
      was. He could not hunt as he wished for that reason. In addition, Han Sen
      wanted to check out first what the ocean had to offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      All kinds of sea creatures that he had never seen before were swimming.
      From afar, he seemed to see a red river flowing on the bottom of the sea.
      However, when he approached it, he found it was formulated by numerous
      red-shelled prawns, each as thick as a motorcycle. They were swimming
      among the seaweeds growing on the seabed. At first glance, Han Sen could
      not see the end of them and he did not know how many there were.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s mouth was watering so he commanded the Crystal Palace to
      stop. Not turning on the function to avoid water, Han Sen opened up a
      channel that looked like a swimming pool. When one of the red shelled
      prawn passed by, Han Sen used the yin force to hit its head and killed it
      instantaneously.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Primitive Creature Fire Prawn Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Eat
        Its Meat To Gain 0 To 10 Primitive Geno Points.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen took the prawn back, shelled it to expose the meat that looked
      like jelly. He cut the meat into pieces and dipped it into some sauce.
      Suddenly, he felt the meat was so sweet and tasty.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With such treasures, will I ever worry that the resources are
      lacking?&#8221; Han Sen was overjoyed, commanding Mermaid Princess to
      control the Crystal Palace to continue forward on the bottom of the ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creatures in the ocean were much more than the land. They were beyond
      Han Sen&#8217;s imagination. Many of them Han Sen has never heard of
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans did not have the ability to hunt creatures in the ocean yet. This
      might be the first time for humans to hunt creatures in deep sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because most of the sea creatures were huge in size, Han Sen did
      not rush to hunt. He mainly came to check out the resources nearby first.
      When there were suitable creatures, he would do some hunting. If there
      were none, he was in no rush.
    </p>

    <p>
      The speed of the crystal boat was very fast inside the water. In just 5 to
      6 days, it had already sailed out of the area of the ice sea. The water
      gradually became warm and the species of the creatures had also changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw some blue balls glowing at the bottom of the sea. When he
      approached them, he saw they were giant jellyfish dancing in the water.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fish of different colors were swimming in groups. Some shellfish were
      opening up at the bottom of the sea. Han Sen saw there were several shiny
      pearls inside a scallop that was the size of a bowl. Feeling interested,
      he swam out of the Crystal Palace and tried to grab the pearls. However,
      the scallop quickly shot, trying to break Han Sen&#8217;s hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, Han Sen took his hand back fast enough and took the closed
      scallop back to the sailboat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Placing the scallop the size of a bowl on a crystal table, Han Sen hit it
      with the yin force and suddenly heard the voice.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Mutant Creature Treasure Scallop Killed. No Beast Soul Gained.
        Eat Its Meat To Gain 0 To 10 Mutant Geno Points.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen was very happy. He did not expect it to be a mutant creature.
      There was not much meat inside the scallop, so he should be able to finish
      it in one meal. This would give him at least 7 to 8 mutant geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Opening up the scallop, Han Sen took out the pearls. They were three in
      total, all around and shiny. These would be rare in the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this a gear as well?&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself. He was
      not sure whether these pearls could be counted as gears.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took back several more scallops. However, after killing them, he
      found that not all of them were mutant creatures. Most of them were just
      primitive creatures, and only the treasure scallops with silver pearls
      were mutant ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were at least tens of thousands of treasure scallops in this region.
      Han Sen took a dozen back to eat himself and commanded the Crystal Palace
      to go forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      After traveling for a few more days and eating many sea creatures, Han Sen
      had gained a dozen mutant geno points, making his mutant geno points as
      many as thirty-three.
    </p>

    <p>
      This day, he saw from afar that in the deep ocean, there was a huge city
      that looks like a gigantic beast crawling on the bottom of the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;An underwater shelter!&#8221; Han Sen glanced at it from afar and
      commanded the Crystal Palace to turn around, not daring to approach the
      shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Judging by the size of the shelter, it was at least a royal shelter. Han
      Sen was alone at this point and he was under the water as well. There was
      no way he could conquer the royal shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the royal shelter had blocked the way of the Crystal Palace, Han
      Sen could only try to sail to the side. However, the water became more and
      more shallow and it eventually reached the shore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen glanced at the shore from afar and found many humans, out of his
      expectation. There was a castle next to the shore, which should be a human
      shelter, to Han Sen&#8217;s joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The icefield was surrounded by ocean and blocked from other places by the
      royal shelter. There was no way for the icefield to contact the outside.
      However, now Han Sen could drive the Crystal Palace and come out from the
      bottom of the sea. This was a great business route. If he used it well, it
      was easy to make money.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parking the Crystal Palace at the bottom of the sea, Han Sen rode the
      silver eel to go out. He swam to the shore and planned to ask where he was
      at. However, when he approached the shore, he found it was different from
      he had imagined. The reason for there to be so many people was that they
      were trying to conquer the shelter on the shore.
    </p>

    <p>
      In front of the shelter, there were many creatures that looked like
      porcupines, covered in spikes
    </p>

    <p>
      which could be shot like arrows. The humans charged several times but
      failed to break into the rain of spikes. Many people ended up getting
      hurt.
