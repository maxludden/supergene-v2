<p>“As far as the Extreme King are concerned, I brought you here to
dig up the ruin of a god’s battleground. By doing so, I wanted you
to fade from the vision of the royal children,” Miss Mirror said
calmly. She was reclining on the bed where they had placed her.
“This is the only reason your pretense of being Prince Sixteen has
lasted this long. But now, this catastrophe with the statues has
killed all my people and left you alive. I don’t think I will be
able to buy you a lot of time. My brother will throw all his
resources into investigating you, and you have nowhere to turn. The
only thing we can do to keep you alive is to perform a sacrifice.
Enter the holy temple to become a devotee. Once you gain the
blessing of the Extreme King, your survival will be ensured.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to the holy temple? What does that mean, exactly?”
Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“The holy temple is where the Extreme King make sacrifices to
their god. Every generation must have a sacrificed King. They offer
themselves to the god and become a devotee. They serve the god
inside the holy temple forever.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Miss Mirror said, “Only someone with the blood of
the Extreme King can earn the blessing of the god. Therefore, a
crystallizer shouldn’t be capable of becoming a devotee. If you
can, though, that will prove you really are Prince Sixteen. At that
point, no one will be able to dispel your lie. Even if someone was
suspicious, not even King Bai could randomly waltz in and do
whatever he pleased. No one would be able to investigate you.”</p>
<p>“So I’d be practically sentenced to life in jail?” Han Sen
frowned.</p>
<p>“Which would you prefer: incarceration or death? Even if you
left now, where would you go? Do you really think Yisha or Kong Fei
can protect you? Let me tell you this now. This universe is big,
but if it is confirmed that you killed Prince Sixteen, there is
nowhere you can go to escape the wrath that will be set upon you.
In order to survive, you would have to be stronger than the leagues
of deifieds that belong to the Extreme King. And I will be one of
them,” Miss Mirror said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“Even if I want to go to the Extreme King’s holy temple, I don’t
have the blood of the Extreme King. How would I even gain the
approval of this god?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“It should be possible with the help of my Mirror Spirit Eye
Ring. Plus, you do have the Original Water King Body that you got
from Bai Yi. Getting the god’s approval shouldn’t be too
difficult.” Miss Mirror paused and said, “Furthermore, going to the
holy temple isn’t entirely like being sent to jail. While you may
not be able to exit the temple, you can still visit the core area.
With the resources you earn in the core area, you can definitely
become half-deified.”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror then hesitated. After a while, she went on to say,
“Also, there are benefits to becoming a devotee. Although you can
never leave the holy temple, you will have the opportunity to bathe
in the temple’s god light. Your genes will be strengthened, and you
will have an easier time becoming deified.”</p>
<p>“Is this my only chance of surviving?” Han Sen asked
quietly.</p>
<p>“Unless you want a universe-wide APB issued by the Extreme King,
yes. This is pretty much the only option. Once you become a
devotee, the other royal children won’t be hostile to you. And so,
you’ll have less trouble,” Miss Mirror said.</p>
<p>“Even if I wanted to try entering the temple, what are they
going to do?” Han Sen pointed at Bao’er and the unconscious Wan’er,
who were a little further away.</p>
<p>“The holy temple isn’t a place just anyone can go. Even the
royal children must meet certain qualifications before they can
become devotees. I can help you get qualified, but in regards to
them, they will have to stay on Planet Water Zone.” After pausing,
Miss Mirror said, “The best thing for them is to disappear.
Otherwise, they may face scrutiny and fall under investigation
themselves. Through them, things could unravel. Of course, if you
insist on them staying, I can think of a way or two to help
them.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard this, he frowned. Bao’er and Ning Yue could
go back to Planet Eclipse. They had the little red bird to protect
them, after all. But there was no way that Wan’er could leave Han
Sen. If she woke up, she’d become a blonde timebomb.</p>
<p>Wan’er’s lifeforce was super weak right now. If she went on a
rampage again, she would die. Han Sen wanted to ask her many
things, so he needed her alive until he could talk to her.</p>
<p>“Let me think about it.” Han Sen knew Miss Mirror would continue
trying to convince him, so he continued on to say, “Do you think
the statue of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes in Du God City
and that prophetic screen are connected to the missing rock we
first dug up?”</p>
<p>Han Sen had already gotten the full-scoop on the white-haired
man from Bao’er and Ning Yue. But Bao’er claimed she didn’t know
who he was.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Everything in Du God City is a mystery, and
everything we find seems to tie back to yet another myth. My
brother will probably send someone else here to continue excavation
efforts. I believe answers will one day come,” Miss Mirror
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen went silent. As a King, he was simply too weak. If he
became deified, then he’d be qualified to fully explore Du God
City. It was a very scary place, and he was just too weak to be
there in his current state.</p>
<p>“Make a decision soon. You are running out of time,” Miss Mirror
said. Then, she stopped talking.</p>
<p>She was trying to convince Han Sen—not because Han Sen had the
Mirror Spirit Ring—but because he had selected to let her live
after their fight in the cave. He had the chance to kill her, but
he showed her mercy. And on top of that, he saved her from Red
Cloud. Otherwise, she never would have done all this for Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Helping Han Sen enter the holy temple as a devotee would break
basically every law that her people had. Plus, she was the
investigator King Bai had specifically chosen to examine Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Han Sen walked over to Wan’er. He looked down at the
girl, wondering what he should do with her.</p>
<p>Going to the holy temple was clearly the safest choice, but that
meant he would be giving up on the girl’s secrets. Maybe Wan’er
would wake up before backup arrived?</p>
<p>Wan’er seemed too weak for that, though. Han Sen tried many
different tricks and powers to reinforce her lifeforce, or to get
her to wake up, but nothing seemed to work.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t dare use more than a trickle of his power. He
didn’t want to accidentally kill Wan’er. Her body was too weak, so
using any significant force on her could be deadly.</p>
<p>“Ugh, this is giving me a headache. If I don’t enter the holy
temple, I’ll have to go on the run. Then, it won’t just be the
Extreme King after me. Any race related to the Extreme King or
seeking their favor will be hunting me. Escaping on my own will be
way too hard,” Han Sen thought with a frown.</p>
<p>If Han Sen escaped, he wouldn’t just be affecting himself. It
would affect the lives of his friends on Planet Eclipse, and it
might even blowback on Yisha.</p>
<p>“If I was to leave, would you help me?” Han Sen looked at Miss
Mirror.</p>
<p>“I am an Extreme King,” Miss Mirror said icily.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and asked, “If I left now, would it affect
Yisha?”</p>
<p>“That is a question you should ask Yisha. It would be her
decision.” Miss Mirror’s eyes flicked down. She seemed to know Han
Sen’s true decision.</p>
