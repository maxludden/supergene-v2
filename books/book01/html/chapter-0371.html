<p>After returning to his dorm, Han Sen dialed Huangfu Pingqing&#8217;s number and saw her in the holographic image.</p>

<p>Huangfu Pingqing was wearing a black strap gown. The low-cut showed off her deep cleavage. The contrast of black and white made her breasts stand out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little brother, you must be calling me for some favor?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing said, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem. Sister, you are so insightful and intelligent to be able to tell this… You are definitely the best candidate to inherit Ares Martial Hall…&#8221; Han Sen said with a dry smile. He never contacted Huangfu Pingqing and felt bad that he was only calling because he needed something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just tell me what you want. You&#8217;re no good at flattering…&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing grinned, her face glowing like a blooming flower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister, then I&#8217;ll be straightforward. Can you tell me a thing or two about the VIP section of Gladiator?&#8221; asked Han Sen.</p>

<p>After Wang Di told Han Sen about the sacred-blood beast soul add-on, Han Sen became very interested, but he did not agree to Wang Di&#8217;s request immediately.</p>

<p>The Alliance was different from God&#8217;s Sanctuary. The strongest opponents Han Sen could ever face in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary were those who had just become evolvers, and they were not even that much of a threat to Han Sen. However, in the Alliance, too many people had the ability to kill Han Sen, and he did not dare to slack at all, which was why he was asking Huangfu Pingqing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You went to the VIP section?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing suddenly became mad. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell warn you against it repeatedly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me, but one of my schoolmates.&#8221; Han Sen told Huangfu Pingqing everything about Wang Di. If it was possible, Han Sen would love to help him.</p>

<p>Huangfu Pingqing heard Han Sen out with her brows knitted, pondered and said, &#8220;Consider this person dead already. Don&#8217;t get in the middle of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so? If he wins the battle, his debt would go away, right?&#8221; Han Sen continued to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think those perverts would let him win?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing curled her lips and said. &#8220;All I could tell you is that whoever goes there is a toro waiting to be slaughtered. Less than 1% could survive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m willing to spend some money, will it be possible to get him out?&#8221; Han Sen thought about it and asked. He&#8217;d rather not see Wang Di die.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think a snake is going to give up on its prey?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing said grimly. &#8220;This is not your business. We can do nothing about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if I fight on behalf of him?&#8221; Han Sen asked tentatively. He did not want to let go of the sacred-blood beast soul add-on, which was almost impossible to find on the market and would be a great help and hunting super creatures.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him very well?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing gazed at Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not really.&#8221; Han Sen told Huangfu Pingqing about Wang Di&#8217;s proposal to hire Han Sen with the beast souls.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t agree yet, right?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing asked with her brows knitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. But I really want that beast soul add-on. Is there no way around this?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing asked.</p>

<p>Huangfu Pingqing rolled her eyes at Han Sen and said, &#8220;If I were you, I would give up such a stupid idea. If you go there, it is impossible that he would survive. To be honest with you, the people Wang Di will be facing there are actually evolvers. It is the same if you go on his behalf. Do you think you stand any chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is fraud,&#8221; said Han Sen, frowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is. And what can you do about it? Those people are so powerful that neither of us could afford to mess with them. Just give up the idea,&#8221; said Huangfu Pingqing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to go, what kind of evolver with my opponent be?&#8221; Han Sen pondered and asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not serious, right? You think you can beat an evolver? Any evolver would be too strong for an unevolved person, especially in a life-and-death battle like this. Your opponent would not hold back at all, because no one would risk his own life.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing stared at Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the opponent is someone who has just evolved, maybe I could win,&#8221; He said calmly.</p>

<p>Huangfu Pingqing gazed at Han Sen for a long before she said, &#8220;I will send you a video clip. If you think you have what it takes to kill this person, then you can go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen received the video shortly. He clicked play and saw two guys fighting in a ring. One guy was as strong as a tower. He was at least 8 feet tall. The extremely muscular body made him look like Ironman himself.</p>

<p>The beast soul weapon used by his opponent only left a shallow mark on his skin. The muscular man then lifted his opponent up and easily ripped the poor guy apart like tearing apart a chicken. Blood rained like crazy.</p>

<p>Audience outside the ring were cheering excitedly, shouting and hitting the fence.</p>

<p>Then the video was followed by another one. The protagonist was still the extremely muscular man. His opponent was beheaded immediately this time.</p>

<p>All the video clips were more or less the same thing. All the opponents of this man were torn into pieces by him bare-handedly. The strongest person only lasted half an hour in front of this man before meeting his fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this person?&#8221; Han Sen turned off the video and asked Huangfu Pingqing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not important who he is. The key is that if you entered the life-and-death battle, he is very likely to be your opponent,&#8221; said Huangfu Pingqing.</p>

<p>In fact, Huangfu Pingqing was exaggerating a little bit. The perverts enjoyed watching a bloody and slow kill instead of a seckill, which would be way less fun. Therefore, when they sought an opponent for the unevolved, they would prefer to choose an evolver without all his geno points maxed out. This way, the unevolved would still have some chance to struggle. However, the man in the video that Huangfu Pingqing showed Han Sen was a top evolver, famous for his cruelty, hence popular among the perverts.</p>

<p>The man was not for every unevolved person. The reason Huangfu Pingqing said that was to dissuade Han Sen from risking his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you make sure that he will be my opponent if I enter the battle?&#8221; Han Sen asked seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Huangfu Pingqing resolutely. She did not want Han Sen to take any chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay then. I have decided that I will enter the battle on behalf of Wang Di.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s calm words made Huangfu Pingqing feel dumbstruck and speechless.</p>
