  After the Break World beast was killed, the mist on the floating islands receded and disappeared. Han Sen put away the Break World gene. He was getting ready to fly to the next floating island when he saw one of the 12 jade buildings of the White Jade Jing start to glow. A shadow emerged from the jade building.

Han Sen squinted and had a closer look. He looked through the holy light. He noticed that what emerged from the White Jade Jing was a fairy clad in blue clothes.

“White Jade Jing is up in the sky; 12 buildings and five cities. Fairies are above my head, and my hair grows.” The blue-clothed fairy recited a poem from the White Jade Jing as she kept flying all around the structure. Her body was light, and her voice echoed. It did not look as if she was from Earth. It was like a dream.

Han Sen looked at the blue-clothed fairy headed his way in her floating motion and asked, “Are you a Break World beast from White Jade Jing?”

Han Sen did not deny he judged people via their appearance. If it was an ugly monster that was swooping down, he would have already attacked. What was now flying out was a good-looking Break World creature, so he took the time to ask.

“I am not a Break World beast. I am a fairy. I am a fairy from the White Jade Jing.” The blue-clothed fairy hovered in the air. She did not descend. She just used her airy voice to talk to Han Sen.

“I have seen many gods. This is the first time I’ve ever seen a fairy.” Han Sen checked the blue-clothed fairy out.

“Your body has the holy air of the White Jade Jing. You should become a part of the White Jade Jing. Why are you killing things around the White Jade Jing?” The blue-clothed fairy looked at Han Sen as she spoke.

“I did enter the 12 floors to retrieve the jade air, but I did not get any holy air.” Han Sen did not believe the blue-clothed fairy was just a fairy.

Even if it was a fairy, it was just a creature called a fairy.

It was like God Spirits. They were just spirit body creatures. They were not like actual gods that could do anything they wanted to.

“The jade air you mention is the White Jade Jing’s holy air,” the blue-clothed fairy coldly said. “You have the benefits of the White Jade Jing, and you have not thought about paying it back. On top of that, you are going to bring it harm. You are doing it all wrong.”

“I am seeking vengeance, so what’s the big deal?” Han Sen asked with a look of disdain.

According to the blue-clothed fairy’s theory, after he drank milk, he would have to thank the cow and never eat beef again.

“I wouldn’t dare say that.” The blue-clothed fairy was angered by the things Han Sen said. She raised one of her fingers and gathered up some fairy-like light. She flicked her fingers and had the holy light shoot out at Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen did not fall back. His body glowed in a holy way. It was like he was made from jade ice. He threw a punch at the holy light.

When Han Sen punched the holy light, the holy light broke. It turned into the glitter of starlight and went everywhere.

But the holy light was still there. It generated the shape of a holy net that trapped Han Sen inside it.

Han Sen gathered up his power, wanting to break the holy net. He quickly discovered that the stronger he was, the tighter the holy net became.

A moment later, the holy net was digging into Han Sen’s flesh. The Jadeskin Break World holy body was damaged by the holy net.

“Stop wasting your breath,” the blue-clothed fairy said while pulling the silk. “This is one of the 10 Break World armaments that belonged to the White Jade Jing. It is called a trap fairy net. Its Break World rate is almost 100%. Even if Break World elites with a 90% Break World rate found themselves snared by the trap fairy net, they would find themselves unable to escape and flee. The more strength you use, the tighter it becomes.” She pulled the trap fairy net. Han Sen got closer to her. She then flew to the White Jade Jing.

Han Sen did not believe her. He continued to use his Jadeskin. He tried to break the holy silk net that bounded him.

The thing was surprisingly hardy. Plus, it was just like the blue-clothed fairy had said. The more he struggled and the more strength he exerted, the tighter the strands of silk became. The fairy silk was digging into his flesh so much that one could see his bones.

“Is the White Jade Jing really where the fairy lives?” Han Sen stopped struggling. He spoke loudly so the blue-clothed fairy could hear him.

“Not bad,” the blue-clothed fairy replied.

“What kind of fairy are you?” Han Sen asked.

“A fairy is a fairy,” the blue-clothed fairy said. “Back in time, many years before today, we were greater than every race in this world. You might say we were a collection of ancient gods. To the fairies, we just called them fairy children that had only just been born.” She sounded cold as she spoke, and she did not display any special emotions. She gave off the feeling that she was very proud and looking down on everything else in creation.

“If fairies were that great, why was the White Jade Jing taken away by the Sky?” Han Sen asked. “The fairies you hold so lofty seem to be far worse in reality.”

The blue-clothed fairy’s face changed. She seemed angry as she coldly said, “If we had not been trapped inside the White Jade Jing, little people like the Sky would not have been able to gain access to the White Jade Jing.”

“Who sealed you inside here?” Han Sen’s heart jumped.

The blue-clothed fairy’s face changed. She did not answer Han Sen. She pulled Han Sen, who was trapped inside the trap fairy net. She did not speak as she proceeded to the White Jade Jing.

There was a lot of holy air inside the White Jade Jing. The good air was everywhere. It was like a holy land.

Han Sen had been to the White Jade Jing before. Back then, it was not half as pretty as it was now. It did not matter if it was one of the 12 jade buildings or one of the five cities, but they all looked bigger and more mysterious.

Han Sen asked a few more questions, but the blue-clothed fairy continued to ignore him. She did not take Han Sen outside of the jade building she was in. She flew toward a jade city.

That jade city was black. It looked to have been composed of inky jade. The presence there was so deep that it was like hell. Han Sen recalled the black king flying out of that city, only to be murdered by him.

“The black king beast soul was unique,” Han Sen said. “It is not like the beast soul of ordinary Break World beasts. The blue-clothed fairy has not decided to kill me yet, but she is now taking me to the black city. If she is doing that, it must have something to do with the black king.”

He had a way of breaking the trap fairy net, but he did not do it yet. He wanted to see what the other fairies of the White Jade Jing were like first.

Han Sen had already seen the black jade city, but it was different from the black jade city now. The city had a holy air. Many jade statues occupied the city. There were male children and female children. There were big beasts and god birds. There were flowers, trees, grass, and woods. They were all made of inky jade. The black jade city had no life force. The jade was everywhere.

The blue-clothed fairy landed in the city. She did not look at Han Sen as she asked, “Did you know that not too long ago, the grass, flowers, birds, and beasts were all alive?”

“Why are they all jade statues now?” Han Sen thought he knew, but he pretended he did not know.

“It is because the master here died.” The blue-clothed fairy turned around and looked at Han Sen.
