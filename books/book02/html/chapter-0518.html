    <p>
      &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Annie thought Han Sen wanted her to
      suppress her strength to fight him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie did not mind that. Even if she had to lower her strength, she
      believed she could beat Han Sen completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the training room,&#8221; Han Sen said and walked
      toward the training room.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Now is not the time,&#8221; Annie did not move, but said coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What? Are you afraid?&#8221; Han Sen looked at her sarcastically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie ignored it and said, &#8220;Now I still have to work. I will see you
      at the training room in three hours.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, I will wait for you.&#8221; Han Sen appreciated this quality
      about her very much. She was indeed a good soldier, loyal to her duties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen returned to his room and caught the unicorn beetle which was going
      around everywhere. Without eating or drinking, it did not starve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tried to feed it with different things, but it was not interested
      in any food. Han Sen wondered how it kept itself alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the agreed time, when Han Sen reached the training room, he saw that
      Annie had changed from uniform to a white combat suit.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s begin,&#8221; she said coldly, seeing Han Sen coming
      in.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Han Sen stood outside and did not enter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to suppress my strength to fight you? Are
      you afraid now?&#8221; Annie said with contempt.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sister, when have I said that? I am no idiot. Even if you suppress
      your own strength. Your eyesight and reflex are not something that could
      be reduced. I am not foolish, so why would I ask for that?&#8221; Han Sen
      curled his lips.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Then what do you want?&#8221; Annie frowned.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We have both learned military boxing, right?&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What if I have?&#8221; Annie asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you have learned it, that&#8217;s easy. Let&#8217;s do it the
      civilized way. I name a move and then you can name a move. We will both
      use the techniques from voter boxing only. If that fair?&#8221; Han Sen
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The way of combat is focused on the reflex and flexibility. If we
      are talking about the moves, how can we decide who is the winner? Moving
      the lips is no fun,&#8221; said Annie frowning.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Just tell me if you dare to do it. If you do not there, you can
      leave now and stay out of my way in the future,&#8221; Han Sen said
      contemptuously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, I will see what tricks you have up your sleeves.&#8221; Annie
      did not believe that Han Sen would win using the same military boxing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lady first. You go.&#8221; Han Sen felt relaxed, as he was fully
      confident.
    </p>

    <p>
      Talking about the moves, he would definitely win. All other elements were
      ruled out and only the moves matter. It was like playing go. Although the
      pieces were the same, the method to calculate was different.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to win, the strategy was key, which was what Han Sen was good at.
      Strength, speed, and reflex were less important.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Annie was surpasser, a civilized fight like this one wiped clean
      all her advantages. On the other hand, Han Sen who was good at calculation
      had an advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Head punch!&#8221; Annie thought about it and said a move of
      attacking.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sideway punches, left of your ribs,&#8221; Han Sen answered
      quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Backward elbow, turning to the left to attack your neck.&#8221;
      Annie felt slightly uncomfortable. She had never tried to make the move
      mentally and had to think for a while before she said anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two persons exchanged thirty moves and then Annie felt something was
      wrong. She found herself trapped in a dangerous situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the moves were all the same, Annie felt it was hard for her to
      attack. When fourteen moves were exchanged, she could no longer think of a
      way to dodge Han Sen&#8217;s attacks.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;You lost,&#8221; Han Sen said contentedly.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is just talking. If it were in a real fight, you could never
      have done that,&#8221; Annie said, unwilling to accept her failure.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is okay. We can act out what we had just said. However, this
      time, neither of us shall use force. We will just act out what we had
      said,&#8221; Han Sen walked up to Annie and said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Annie did not believe that.</p>

    <p>
      However, when the two persons were sparring like Han Sen had just
      explained, Annie did not have anywhere to dodge when it came to the thirty
      ninth move. Unless he used speed and strength beyond Han Sen, she would
      lose for sure.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How about that? Are you convinced?&#8221; Han Sen glanced at Annie
      and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is the first time for me to do this. I&#8217;m not like you
      who is all talk.&#8221; Annie was not convinced. She did not believe that
      she would be inferior to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s fine. We can do it again. I will beat you until you
      are convinced,&#8221; Han Sen curled his lips and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, but we will both speak and act out this time,&#8221; Annie
      thought she lost to Han Sen because she was not good at imagination.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay,&#8221; Han Sen smiled and said. Acting out was not the
      important part. As long as no strength was involved, then Annie would not
      still be inferior to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, everyone had a specialty, and Han Sen&#8217;s was calculation.
      Annie seemed to be the type that were good at violent moves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fight began again. However, the result was no different from last
      time. This time, she lost even faster. She could no longer continue after
      the thirty fifth move.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Are you convinced?&#8221; Han Sen asked again.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Noâ€¦&#8221; Annie bit her lips, unable to accept the fact that she
      was inferior to Han Sen. There was no way she was now the match of a man
      who lived off a woman.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then let&#8217;s do it again,&#8221; Han Sen grinned and said.
      Annie was looking for trouble herself, so he had no reason not to give it
      to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie was someone stubborn. They fought for more than thirty times and she
      did not win even once. Lost, lost, and lost, she did not even make it to
      the fortieth move once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although she did not use strength and her energy was not consumed, she
      became pale and sweaty on her forehead. She did not understand why she
      would lose to Han Sen again and again using the same moves only with
      different order, not to mention in such a miserable way. Initially, she
      thought as long as she was familiar with this way of fighting, she could
      turn the situation around. All her previous losses were just because she
      was not used to it. However, the fact was cruel. Whether or not she knew
      the way of fighting well, she lost equally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie found that she was so weak in front of Han Sen just based on the
      moves in martial arts. This man who she despised seemed to be
      exceptionally good in this regard. Now Annie had understood she was no
      match to Han Sen in this respect.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Do we need to continue?&#8221; Han Sen smiled at Annie.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is no wonder that you want because you have studied these
      trivial matters. However, if it were a real fight, there is no way you
      could beat me.&#8221; Annie knew that she had lost, but she would not
      admit it.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s fight for real,&#8221; Han Sen said abruptly.</p>
