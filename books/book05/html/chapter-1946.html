<p>The Buddha could not control Heaven in its entirety. If someone traveled to the area that was not under the control of the Buddha, they had a chance of making it to the other end.</p>

<p>Luo Ji thought the area that the Buddha did not control was under the Sand Sea.</p>

<p>“Once you enter the Sand Sea, you will see some white dunes. They’re different from the ones of yellow sand. You won’t find them if you don’t look, either. Once you find them, though, head for them immediately. Then, you can enter the region that the Buddha don’t control. This is merely my theory, though. There’s a chance I am incorrect,” Luo Ji said.</p>

<p>“If it’s not correct, then you know you will die with me. It is best you tell me everything,” Han Sen said to Luo Ji as he continued running.</p>

<p>“There is no more for me to tell. That is all I know,” Luo Ji said.</p>

<p>“Really? I don’t think you’re the sort of person that goes on an adventure with nothing but a guess,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>

<p>“You can’t say that! The whole reason I am here is because the place the Buddha control might have a treasure that the deified elite left behind. That is why I came here in the first place,” Luo Ji answered.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept running, looking all around. He was pivoting his head to look for the white dunes Luo Ji had mentioned. There were many dunes around, but there wasn’t a single white one.</p>

<p>After running for a while, Han Sen’s eyed gleamed brightly. Amidst the bumpy dunes of the desert, there was a smaller dune between them. It was only two meters tall. The dune was a little white, and if you did not peer at it closely, you might not have seen a difference at all.</p>

<p>“I found your dune. So, how do I get in?” Han Sen asked Luo Ji as he ran for the dune.</p>

<p>“Some peoples have been known to accidentally run inside, usually when they were getting attacked. I don’t know exactly how to get in, but I was planning to try digging,” Luo Ji answered.</p>

<p>Han Sen stopped hesitating. He pulled out Ghost Teeth Knife and slashed a Fang attack towards it.</p>

<p>The knifelight struck the little dune and created a big hole inside it.</p>

<p>Han Sen was very pleased with the result. His Ghost Teeth Knife had created a big hole, and the knifelight was still moving forward. The attack had punched through easily, as if it was hollow down below.</p>

<p>But if you looked from above, you’d see a hole with sand at the bottom.</p>

<p>Han Sen clenched his jaw and went inside the dune. Han Sen did not feel as if he was hitting sand. It felt more like water. It seemed like he was drifting down, like he was sinking.</p>

<p>Seven Spirit, who had caught up by that point, hesitated for a moment. He still decided to jump in.</p>

<p>Eventually, Han Sen’s eyes brightened. What he saw shocked him.</p>

<p>When he went through the dune, he didn’t arrive in some cave. It was another world, complete with its own sky. It was like he was traveling through the skies.</p>

<p>It was different from the desert above, too. Here, he could see gold springs and giant gold trees. Every tree had a gold temple.</p>

<p>Light glowed everywhere. There was a Buddha mist that covered a temple, splitting the light into many colors. It looked like a Heaven of its own, but there was no pain and violence like in the Heaven above.</p>

<p>“Is this the real Heaven?” Han Sen frowned because the music was stronger there. Even he was starting to feel that pressure. His legs trembled, and it seemed as if he was about to start dancing.</p>

<p>Han Sen used his will to regain control of his body. Before he could decide where to go, he heard a noise and Seven Spirit dropped down behind him.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried to leap towards the gold forest that was visible in front of him, but he felt as if he was grounded and could no longer go airborne. So, he kept running forward.</p>

<p>Seven Spirit did not follow him. He looked at Han Sen and laughed grimly. “Han Sen, this Heaven is not a place you can freely access.”</p>

<p>“Really? Because I just did. So, what? Are you going to come and kill me?” Han Sen didn’t look back as he shouted.</p>

<p>“If you keep going, you’ll be dead without me lifting a finger,” Seven Spirit said simply.</p>

<p>Han Sen wished to say something more, but Seven Spirit went on. “It is almost time.”</p>

<p>And then a bell chimed. Han Sen’s brain felt as if it had just exploded. He almost collapsed to the ground. The tolling of the bell was far more powerful than the music.</p>

<p>Seven Spirit put his hands before him. Then, a Buddha light shone. His forehead produced a cold sweat with the difficulty of what he was casting.</p>

<p>Seven Spirit coldly looked at Han Sen, who was lying on the ground. He walked towards Han Sen with a Buddha light. He turned into his four-faced, eight-armed Buddha form and said, “Dying in the face of such music is your luck.”</p>

<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but he heard another bell chime. He did not know where it came from, but it echoed across the entire world. Han Sen was on the ground, and the chiming of the bell had him coughing up blood again.</p>

<p>“Seven Spirit, why do you want me dead?” Han Sen asked Seven Spirit, since he was having a hard time standing up_</p>

<p>“It is because you deserve death.” Seven Spirit spoke each word from all four mouths. They each had a different tone, and it was like four people telling him all at once. It looked very creepy.</p>

<p>After that, the three-meter-tall Seven Spirit came charging towards Han Sen. Eight of his arms had eight different spirit marks, and they were all coming to attack Han Sen.</p>

<p>Dragon, lion, sheep, horse, elephant, bug, and fish; all seven Buddha lights were collected and sent rushing toward Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen rolled across the golden floor to dodge the seven mark attacks. Then, he got up and ran towards the golden forest again.</p>

<p>But the heavenly music was getting louder and louder. Han Sen was starting to lose control of his body. He started dancing a little, a morbidly amusing thing to see.</p>

<p>Seven Spirit, who was behind Han Sen, could tell he was having trouble walking. Seven Spirit himself had already turned into a xenogeneic, but he was losing control.</p>

<p>Han Sen followed the music and kept running the same way, dancing as he went. Seven Spirit could not kill him, but Han Sen had been attacked by those spirits, and he had incurred an injury.</p>

<p>Seven Spirit used his lion spirit to attack Han Sen, but the arm twitched. The lion landed on the golden ground and did not touch Han Sen.</p>

<p>“Seven Spirit, you finally cannot handle this music anymore.” Han Sen suddenly laughed. He brushed off the dirt on his front and stood up. He looked very lackadaisical, as if the music hadn’t affected him at all.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” Seven Spirit’s face went slack.</p>
