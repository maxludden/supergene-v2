<p>Every punch Han Sen delivered to the Feather was extremely hard, making the being bleed profusely.</p>

<p>The Feather’s speed and strength were no worse than Han Sen’s, but its experience and skill were considerably lacking.</p>

<p>Only their stats were on the same page.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Han Sen threw a punch that the Feather managed to dodge. And right after, the Feather retaliated with one aimed for Han Sen’s stomach. This gave Han Sen a shock.</p>

<p>It wasn’t because the Feather’s punch was powerful, though; it was because it was a punch he himself had used once before.</p>

<p>“Deal with him soon! He’s too strong. He learns fast, and you will lose the advantage you currently hold very soon!” Old Cat shouted.</p>

<p>As Old Cat yelled, Han Sen dodged the punch and grabbed the Feather’s arm. He swiftly jerked his elbow to drive it into his opponent’s throat.</p>

<p>The Feather shrieked in agony. Han Sen didn’t relent, though, and he twisted his foe’s arm and pinned it against his back. With one hand to keep his arm restricted, Han Sen used his other hand to repeatedly punch his foe in the head.</p>

<p>The Feather couldn’t muster much strength due to the way its arm was twisted and locked. Without being able to block the attacks, all it could do was submit to the beating and bleed.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The Feather then flipped its body, no longer caring for its arm. The arm broke, but the Feather got free. He stared Han Sen down.</p>

<p>It was strange, though. The Feather looked as if nothing had happened, and with its head, it tried to ram Han Sen roughly.</p>

<p>Han Sen twirled in an evasion and dodged the strike. He grabbed his enemy by the throat and put him into a chokehold. With his knee, he repeatedly hit the Feather’s chest.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>The knee pounded the chest like a drum. Han Sen did that five times, until he heard the bones break and could feel the chest cave inwards.</p>

<p>The Feather coughed up blood and roared. It grabbed Han Sen by the leg and bit it The teeth pierced through his armor and went into his flesh. Han Sen’s reaction was fast, though. He squeezed his foe by the neck and he stopped. If he kept on going, the neck would snap.</p>

<p>Han Sen twisted the Feather’s neck so far around, the head was back-to-front.</p>

<p>The being smiled at Han Sen as blood poured out of its mouth. It looked scary. A second later, he grabbed Han Sen’s arm and delivered his own twist. He wanted to use the same armlock that Han Sen had.</p>

<p>“You are too naive to copy my own skills and use them against me.” Han Sen slammed his elbow into the enemy’s face. Blood splattered everywhere as the face caved in. The Feather hit the ground with an impact that formed a crater.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s body was like a meteor, then. He slammed his knee down against the Feather’s throat, breaking the neck completely.</p>

<p>The Feather’s head turned to the side, but it had lost all support for turning back. Still, the being didn’t die, and it did its best to stop Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept on attacking the Feather until its body was nothing but a mangled mess. When Han Sen took a second to admire his handiwork, he was looking at a mangled mess rather than a body. But he realized that the being still wasn’t dead. It was incredibly sturdy.</p>

<p>“Fuck! Why won’t this thing die?” Han Sen shouted.</p>

<p>Old Cat, who wasn’t too far away, said, “Feathers don’t have a weakness per se. You’ll just have to rip its body apart. There’s nothing else you can really do.”</p>

<p>“If that’s how it’s done, then I will send it to hell in pieces.” Han Sen’s fists raged with greater fury.</p>

<p>The Feather’s limbs and chest were all broken, and its skull was deformed. But still, the Feather did not die. It was very strong.</p>

<p>Pssst!</p>

<p>Han Sen ripped off a bloodied white wing. The Feather let out an animalistic shriek of pain.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw the being reel in pain after that, and he realized that the Feather hadn’t reacted that way to any other injury.</p>

<p>So, Han Sen grabbed the other wing, too.</p>

<p>Han Sen punched and punched until the bones broke and he could rip the wings off.</p>

<p>The Feather grabbed Han Sen, but Han Sen kicked him off. Then, he went back to pummeling the thing like crazy.</p>

<p>“Alu-Alu!” When he punched, Han Sen couldn’t help but copy Xie Qing King. It felt as if he’d punch harder that way.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>The power was brought down on the Feather’s neck, and after hundreds of punches, the neck finally began to give. After that, Han Sen ripped the enemy’s head off.</p>

<p>But strangely, the body without a brain still wanted a piece of Han Sen. And the head itself tried to bite into Han Sen’s throat.</p>

<p>“F*ck you!” Han Sen kicked the body away and rammed his fist into the brain. He mashed it continuously.</p>

<p>Blood and juices went everywhere as the head broke.</p>

<p>With the repeated punches, the head exploded. Juice went everywhere.</p>

<p>The Feather’s headless body approached. With burning eyes, Han Sen moved to punch it.</p>

<p>With a multitude of punches, Han Sen was able to break its body. The organs turned into pulp and it eventually stopped moving.</p>

<p>Han Sen wiped the blood off his face and slumped down on the ground, gasping. He felt as if his limbs were numb.</p>

<p>That was the first time Han Sen had beaten something for so long that he exhausted himself in the process.</p>

<p>“Old Cat, what was this thing?” Han Sen looked at Old Cat. The cat went over to the corpse and tried to take something off it</p>

<p>Even though Han Sen was tired, he still jumped up and went in front of Old Cat. He licked his lips and said, “Old Cat, this is wrong. You didn’t do anything and now you want to loot whatever is available?”</p>

<p>Old Cat smiled and said, “I am worried that you didn’t realize it was a good item. I was just going to fetch it for you.”</p>

<p>“Why? What did you see?” Han Sen asked him.</p>

<p>“I see these bones aren’t too bad. They might make a good soup.” Old Cat gave him a thumbs up.</p>

<p>But Han Sen didn’t believe this. He stepped over to the body and examined it more closely.</p>

<p>“Old Cat was digging right about here, so what was he after?” Han Sen thought to himself. He only saw organs, blood, and bones. It was pretty gross to look at.</p>

<p>It was fortunate Han Sen was not super hygienic. He rooted around in the organs and bones and searched amongst the blood for a bit. He eventually found something, and it sure didn’t feel like bone.</p>
