<p>Han Sen’s face looked ill. There was a lot of icy fire getting absorbed by the tower, and if the interior filled up, the people inside would not fare well.</p>

<p>But Han Sen’s fear of this did not materialize. The icy flames that were absorbed by the tower did not actually manifest on the interior. No fire appeared on the inside, threatening him. But on the top floor of the tower, another pedestal appeared. There was an ice flame on it, like a frosty flower rolling around.</p>

<p>“These guys are too scary. I need to find a way to escape from here.” Han Sen looked outside the tower and tried to think of a way in which he might make it away.</p>

<p>The ice flame hadn’t hurt them this time, but who knew what might happen as the fight dragged on. It would be best if they left as soon as they were able to.</p>

<p>The situation outside made Han Sen want to avoid unnecessary risks, however. When the ice flames were absorbed by the tower, the tower was headed directly for the chimenea. It looked as if it was going to crush it. ( .c om )</p>

<p>The ice flames inside the chimenea had dispersed, but Han Sen wasn’t sure if the fires were put out by the chimenea’s own volition or if they had just been stolen.</p>

<p>A creature with black armor then emerged from the chimenea. It grabbed the metal tower headed for it and lifted it up. The tower was shining amidst that deflective power, and the creature was unable to crush the little thing.</p>

<p>The headless rockman was pressing down on the top of the tower, and his scary might was forcing it down. As he did this, the black armored creature pushed up from below. Those two frightening forces were pushing and pulling with unimaginable force.</p>

<p>The shockwaves generated came from the center of the tower, and the glaciers near them all broke. Chunks of ice were sent flying everywhere, and it created a terrifying scene.</p>

<p>Han Sen and Bao’er were not having a good time. The tower had absorbed a lot of power, but it was unable to block it all.</p>

<p>The rockman’s power and the black armored foe’s power were seeping into the interior of the tower. The rockman’s power was like blood, though, and Han Sen thought it seemed rather familiar. He eventually realized it was the skill he had learned from inside this same tower.</p>

<p>“Does this headless rockman have a relationship to Human Emperor? Or is he himself Human Emperor?” Han Sen had a lot to think about.</p>

<p>The Black Armor Foe’s power was very weird. It was a power that included both ice and fire, and combined them. Han Sen could not tell where the power came from, but it was extremely strong.</p>

<p>When those powers entered the tower, no damage was dealt to the interior. The powers did, however, cause a lot of trouble for Han Sen.</p>

<p>Inside the tower, it was suddenly cold and hot at the same time. And the blood power from the rockman made their blood flow inversely. It felt as if the blood was going to gush out from their bodies.</p>

<p>Little Silver and Starsea Beast did their best to resist both of those powers, but it wasn’t going well. Their lifeforces were messed up, and there was a chance it could trigger a self-wrought combustion.</p>

<p>Han Sen summoned his God geno core and his Bloodlust Ant King to fight back that wretched combination of power. ( .c om )</p>

<p>The headless rockman and the Black Armor Foe were still engaged in combat, but neither of them seemed to be the dominant force. They were both locked against each other.</p>

<p>When Han Sen looked back outside, having the tower for shelter was far better than the surrounding region. The power outside was far too scary, and it made them realize there’d be no hope of escaping if they were to set foot outside the tower.</p>

<p>But Han Sen, feeling that power leak inside, thought to himself, “I practiced the skill of the tower, so maybe I can use my power to control the blood power that is trying to invade here. If I can control that power, I don’t have to deal with both of their powers. I’d only have to deal with the ice and fire.”</p>

<p>Han Sen cast the skill he had learned from the tower. He used the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and then his body went into a strange mode of operation.</p>

<p>Han Sen triggered the secret skill, but it didn’t allow him to immediately control the blood power just yet. He felt like the blood power would eventually come, though, like it had been searching for a host.</p>

<p>Using this skill cost a lot of energy, however. And Han Sen knew he wouldn’t be able to last long with it. But when the blood power began to seep inside of him, he felt a lot more awake. He no longer felt tired, and the headache and twitchy feelings vanished.</p>

<p>When the blood power was inside him, it was refined by the skill he was casting. It moisturized his transformed body, and the flesh and bones changed even more.</p>

<p>As more and more of that blood power was refined, Han Sen started to feel some weird connection between him and the tower.</p>

<p>He could feel the pulse of the tower, like his blood was connected to the construct. Of course, it was just a feeling more than anything. He couldn’t physically control the tower.</p>

<p>As the fight went on, Han Sen felt the treasures on the pedestals start to get corroded by the weird power. They all started to fade, even that ice-flame.</p>

<p>The treasures on the rocks were melting, and a Godlight from the pedestals began to shine and illuminate the tower. The light melted into the construct itself. It made the tower shine brighter, and the strength it possessed increased.</p>

<p>“Are you really this stubborn in your refusal to understand?” the Black Armor Foe said.</p>

<p>The headless man of stone looked sad. “If understanding is my destiny, then I will forever forsake the need to understand.”</p>

<p>“Then you will disappear.” After that cold voice spoke again, the Black Armor Foe threw a punch towards the bottom of the tower. And then, the entire tower went flying through the air.</p>

<p>The rockman’s hand that was holding the tower had been cleaved through, and his entire body went stumbling back.</p>

<p>The Black Armor Foe created another flame, and he used it to forge an Icefire Sword. With it, he slashed towards the rockman.</p>

<p>The swordflame was terrifying to witness, and the tower was now like the ceiling of the sky.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw the explosions erupting outside, and it genuinely felt like the earth was collapsing. He almost couldn’t see what was going on.</p>

<p>The treasures on the pedestals had all melted into the tower at this point, and you could hear the weaponry hit the construct. Every impact made the tower’s power even more messed up. The tower shook violently, like a magnitude ten earthquake.</p>

<p>Even Han Sen could not control his body. Silver Fox, Little Star, and Little Ice Seahorse were rolling around the interior non-stop.</p>

<p>Han Sen held Bao’er tight to his chest, not wanting her to suffer a hit. He cast the secret skill to absorb more of the tower’s blood power so his companions did not have to endure it. Then, they would only have to deal with the ice and fire.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the metal tower was firmly built. Even after all those horrible impacts, it was solid and had not been broken. Only a small amount of that power was able to seep through, and it was enough for them all to withstand.</p>
