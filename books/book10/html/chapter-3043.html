<p>“Does that mean an extremely powerful gene egg lies buried down
below?” Han Sen was very happy. He used both of his hands to hold
the black iron pillar. He wanted to put it down and see what sort
of gene egg it was suppressing.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a character that had conquered the world. He did not
really care about finding ordinary gene eggs. With such an
interesting gene egg available, he wasn’t keen to miss out.</p>
<p>Regarding whether or not it was aggressive, Han Sen did not
care.</p>
<p>Mister Yang looked at it with shock. He almost scared his own
soul away. He waved his hands and shouted, “Don’t do it, Mister! If
that gene race is born, it will be a disaster for everybody
here.”</p>
<p>Before Mister Yang could finish speaking, the iron pipe-looking
suppress pulse item was pulled out one whole foot by Han Sen. The
iron pipe looked heavy. Under Han Sen’s strength, it was
nothing.</p>
<p>Han Sen used both hands to pull out the iron pipe, one foot
after another. He did it in the blink of an eye. He easily removed
the 24-foot-long black metal pillar from the earth.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>When the metal pillar was pulled out of the ground, the entire
zone seemed to quake a little. Even Ancient God City shook. It made
the people think an earthquake had struck.</p>
<p>After the initial shake, there was no more movement. It made
people wonder and scratch their heads.</p>
<p>“Good grief! Good grief!” Mister Yang was paralyzed on the
ground. He looked at Han Sen down below. His mouth was shaped like
a duck’s beak. He was in so much shock that he forgot to run.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too lazy to show him any attention. He got close to
the metal pillar and looked down into the cave. He saw a purple
light flicker in the darkness down below. It was like an orb that
was glowing in the dark.</p>
<p>The cave was very small, so only a portion of it was visible.
One would not have guessed that it was a part of the gene egg.</p>
<p>“There really is a gene egg!” Han Sen was delighted. After he
confirmed the gene egg’s location, he was no longer worried. He
just slid his hand down.</p>
<p>There was a loud “katcha” sound. The soil was slashed open by
Han Sen. It suddenly created a big crack. Everything down below was
now clearly visible.</p>
<p>Han Sen was staring at it. He saw the soil possess a three-foot
big purple skin jade egg. Under the sunlight, it glowed with a
weird purple. The egg had many patterns across it. They all looked
like symbols.</p>
<p>“Mister Yang, how can I hatch this gene egg?” Han Sen landed
next to the gene egg. He reached out his hand and touched the
purple-looking egg’s shell. Han Sen was most surprised by the fact
that he could detect the presence of a heartbeat by merely touching
the shell of the egg.</p>
<p>Mister Yang sighed and said, “If you have a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse, you just need to touch it. That way, it will respond
to your heart. If it is willing to obey you, it will give you the
message. But you, Mister…”</p>
<p>Before Mister Yang could finish his sentence, Han Sen knew what
he was going to say.</p>
<p>“Without a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, I cannot take the gene race.”
Han Sen did not have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, therefore, he could
not communicate with it.</p>
<p>“That is correct. If there was a simpler way, no one would treat
the God Spirit Blood-Pulse necessity with such importance.” After
pausing, Mister Yang tried to convince Han Sen by saying, “Mister,
if you cannot use it, just put the suppress pulse item back.” Han
Sen was silent a moment before saying, “That is not right. I
thought you said anybody could grow a gene race.” “Of course, you
can grow a gene race, but you cannot combine with it. You can only
use it as a pet, and you cannot just have one randomly. If you meet
a gene race that is very nice and tame, you can tame it. If you
meet some evil gene race and cannot keep it, you must run away from
it. This gene egg must be the evilest of all time. If it ever
hatches…”</p>
<p>Before Mister Yang could finish speaking, there was a “katcha”
noise. The shell of the gene egg broke from its top. The cracks
webbed down quickly. It made Mister Yang so shocked that his mouth
froze.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the breaking gene egg with interest. More
cracks were showing up. Most of it broke in a short while. A fluffy
head soon appeared from the hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked a bit closer. He was surprised.</p>
<p>Inside that big, giant, purple egg, the gene race that emerged
from it was only the size of a fist. Its body was circular. It
looked like a hairy ball.</p>
<p>Its hair glowed red, and its tail was curled up. Its ears were
sharp. The eyes had just opened, and they appeared to be red. It
was obviously a cat.</p>
<p>It was not because of its size that Han Sen was shocked. It was
because the little cat looked rather strange. No matter how he
looked at it, it looked like the asshole Old Cat.</p>
<p>This little cat was much smaller than Old Cat. It looked cute.
It did not look as bad as Old Cat.</p>
<p>The two of them had many other aspects that looked familiar. For
example, ordinary cats did not usually have such big tails. Its
tail was like a fox’s tail. Its ears were sharper and longer than
the average cat. It looked like a fox.</p>
<p>Even so, that little cat had something different from an
ordinary cat. It looked similar to Old Cat though. It looked like a
cat but was not a cat and looked like a fox but was not a fox.</p>
<p>“Meow.” The little cat emerged from the egg. It rushed over to
Han Sen and meowed. It was all shaky next to Han Sen’s feet. It
used its claws to climb into Han Sen’s pants. It seemed to have
great difficulty doing so.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out his hand to pick the cat up by its neck. He
put it in front of him. He checked out that newly born gene race
little cat. Admittedly, it looked rather cute, but it looked like
Old Cat.</p>
<p>Han Sen held the little cat. It looked nice. Its circular face
looked very innocent. It put out its pink tongue and meowed at
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the little cat and thought, “This should be
impossible. Old Cat is dead. Even if he was alive, he could not
reverse his age and return to his gene egg.’ He looked at Mister
Yang and asked, “Old Yang, is this the murderous gene race you were
talking about?” Han Sen picked up the little cat and jumped out of
the hole.</p>
<p>Mister Yang was frozen as he looked at the little cat Han Sen
was holding in his hands. He did not say a word.</p>
<p>After a while, Mister Yang slowly said, “The evilness of a gene
race cannot be judged solely through their appearance. Perhaps it
is too small and has not yet developed. Anyway, to be suppressed by
a suppress pulse item, combined with the god pulse and the ancient
evil beast that appeared, it must be a generational evil
beast…”</p>
<p>“What is a god pulse weird scene and an ancient evil beast?” Han
Sen had heard Mister Yang talk about it before. Now that he had
mentioned it again, he figured he might as well ask him.</p>
<p>Mister Yang replied, “Normal people know gene races as kings,
dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons. There are six
levels. They do not know there is a higher gene race. When that
gene race is born, there will be a god pulse weird scene and an
ancient evil beast. It is a sign of the god pulse weird scene. The
legends say it is a sign of an extremely evil xenogeneic coming
into existence.”</p>
