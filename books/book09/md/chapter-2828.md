  God smiled at Han Sen as it asked, "Can we agree to a bet now?"

Han Sen could not speak. He felt as if he was going to be strangled to death, so he had to nod.

"Nice. You have made the right choice. Using your power is more interesting." God laughed.

"Should it be me who is deciding what to risk?" Han Sen rubbed his throat. He realized now that this god was a bit evil. It seemed very casual, but it was scarier than the other gods he had encountered. It gave Han Sen real pressure, and it was exerting a sense of danger the other gods had not been able to accomplish.

"Before, it really did not matter," God said. "Now, I have met a really interesting creature like you. That is why I want to play my favorite game."

"What game is that?" Han Sen's brain moved fast. His only option was to escape. He could not defeat this god. Even if he could beat this god, the god had taken over Wan'er's body. He could not risk killing Wan'er along with it.

Also, the black crystal armor had strangely hidden itself. That had never happened before. When he used to meet the kings, he had not seen the black crystal armor react like this. That just showed how scary this god truly was.

Han Sen thought gods like the kings would not deal damage to creatures in the universe. Gods like Evil Lotus God, which could hit creatures, were not his enemy. He used Sky Vine Radish and his phoenix feather to establish a tie.

This god was totally different. It was possessing Wan'er and still able to wield massive power. It was clearly a god spirit operating on a whole new level.

This god... Is it the one that met the seventh team? Han Sen wondered.

"It is so simple. We will predict the fate of each other." God's face looked so weird but only for a second.

"Predict fate? Predict whose fate?" Han Sen asked with a frown.

"It can be anybody. You can pick any creature you want," God said. It then moved its hand. God light turned into a mirror. The mirror had many shadows. There were all kinds of creatures from the universe there.

"I don't like altering the fates of others," Han Sen said. "You can come and test my fate, but how will you even predict it, and how will you win?"

"We are just making a bet," God coldly said. "We cannot bet on ourselves. You pick a creature. It can be anyone you know. It can even be your family. We will predict the choices they make when something happens. You can decide first."

"Then, I select the Very High's leader," Han Sen said. He was thinking, No matter how strong you are, you cannot affect the Very High's leader.

It was unknown if God saw what Han Sen was thinking, but it did not care and said, "Yeah, let's bet with Very High Leader."

"How do we bet?" Han Sen asked. "It is not as if we know what the Very High Leader is going to do."

God did not speak. It walked one step and came before Han Sen. It pulled Han Sen with him. Han Sen felt as if he fell into a time vortex. He felt so dizzy that he thought he was going to throw up.

Many people had carried him away via Galaxy Teleport. He had almost finished practicing Galaxy Teleport himself, but it was never this horrible.

When everything returned to normal, Han Sen found himself in Outer Sky. In front of him was the very familiar Star Tree.

The Star Tree was full of fruit. They looked like many giant planets hanging from the branches of the tree.

A young man of the Very High was sitting under the Star Tree with his legs crossed. The man's white clothing was like snow. He looked very handsome and also very cold. He looked like a guy who everybody owed money to.

This man... He looks very familiar... Han Sen thought that the young man looked very familiar.

"This is Very High Leader," God said next to him.

"You are lying. I have seen Very High Leader, and he is an old man." Before Han Sen could finish, his face changed. He suddenly knew why the young man looked so familiar. His facial structure and body looked like Very High Leader. He just looked younger, so he seemed different.

God smiled and said, "That is Very High Leader when he was young. We are here when he was only 20."

"We... We went into the past..." Han Sen's face changed. He finally understood why it was so difficult to teleport. It was not because he had not just used Galaxy Teleport. He had teleported through time.

"There is nothing amazing about it," God casually said. "If you want, I can take you to see what you looked like when you were younger."

"That is fine," Han Sen said. "The past is the past. Whatever happens in the future is always meant to be. If you already know how things pan out, what is the point of making a bet?"

"Who told you the future is already set in stone?" God looked at Han Sen with shock.

"Is it not?" Han Sen asked with a smile. "If the future could be changed, you could just go and kill the Very High's leader now. With the power you have, Very High Leader will obey you. We do not have to go to the past and find the Very High's leader."

God preferred spending its power on going back to the past than going to meet Very High Leader. Clearly, it was afraid of something, which was why Han Sen said what he did.

God laughed and said, "There are rules in this universe. Even God cannot destroy them. But within these rules, there is nothing in there about changing the future. The future is full of unpredictabilities. We come from a change in the future. Now, there is some accident affecting it. It might create another future, so we are not sure what the future is going to be."

"Are you saying that you can affect the young Very High Leader and make him do decisions that benefit you?" Han Sen knew what God was trying to say.

"You can do the same too. That is only fair." God laughed.

Han Sen looked at God seriously and asked, "Can I ask you a question?"

"It depends on what you ask me," God replied with a smile. "I might be God, but I do not know the answer to everything."

Han Sen looked at God seriously. It looked different from the other king gods.

"If you like this game of yours so much, you must have played it many times." Han Sen took a deep breath as he asked, "Did you ever lose?"

"Yes, I have lost twice." God's answer surprised Han Sen.

"I am curious as to who defeated you," Han Sen said with shock.

"One from Sacred and a human called Han Jingzhi," God coldly said. His face looked weird as he spoke.

When Han Sen heard that, his heart began to race like crazy. He almost shouted out loud, "Han Jingzhi..."
