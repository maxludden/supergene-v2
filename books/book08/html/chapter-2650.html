<p>“Why should I let you see them?” Han Sen asked, his voice
relaxed and unhurried. He casually rolled up the paper, then turned
a cold glance on Liyu Zhen as he spoke.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen looked at Han Sen with disdain, then chuckled darkly.
“You are with the Very High now.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And?” Han Sen’s face remained expressionless.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen wasn’t annoyed. Instead, he smiled and said, “I just
want you to know that if a Very High asks something of you, you
cannot say no.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah? I just said it. What are you going to do about it?”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Liyu Zhen was going to fight him, but it didn’t
seem like Liyu Zhen was going to go that far. He just continued to
stare coolly at Han Sen, and then, the third eye in his forehead
opened. His black and white pupils looked like a tai chi yin yang
symbol. That black and white symbol began to spin. It looked like
some invisible light was brewing within it.</p>
<p>His gaze now looked as if it could see through everything, and
it made Han Sen frown.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen looked into Han Sen’s yellow piece of paper. With a
disdainful look, he said, “I thought you had pulled up something
nice, but it’s just a pornographic picture. I overestimated you,
clearly.”</p>
<p>After that, Liyu Zhen went back to ignoring Han Sen. He returned
to his fishing spot and continued with the task.</p>
<p>It was a coincidence. Liyu Zhen sat there and fished for a
while. But later on, his Underworld Silk began to move. It shook a
lot, and it appeared as if something big was on the other end.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen quickly pulled the line. He tried his hardest to tug
it out, but the thing seemed heavy.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>After ten minutes of wrestling with the submerged foe, Liyu Zhen
managed to pull out an item from beneath the mist of the lake. The
object bounced right out of it and landed on the shore.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t help but look at it. He saw a big gold sword
that was similar to the one Bao’er had retrieved. It looked a lot
rougher around the edges, though. It also seemed to lack the
jewels. It was just a big gold sword that was missing its luxurious
touches.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen looked at the big sword with excitement. He spoke to
himself, saying, “Gold Slash… Is this the deified Gold Slash? The
Seventh Uncle was right. My luck has finally turned around.”</p>
<p>He picked up the big gold sword with a look of unbridled joy. He
was extremely fond of his new catch. And after goofing around with
it for a while, he decided to end his day of fishing. He put his
Underworld Silk away and started to leave with the golden sword in
his hand.</p>
<p>When he passed by Han Sen, Liyu Zhen looked at him. He acted as
if he was talking to himself, but the words of poison were
obviously meant for Han Sen to hear. “This is the luck that
separates you from I. You can only fish up that useless and dirty
pornography, while I get deified treasures.”</p>
<p>“Really? Your piece of crap sword is a deified treasure?” Han
Sen said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Such an ignorant kid you are! Gold Slash is an obscenely rare
treasure to fish up from the Underworld Lake. It is deified at the
very least. Although it is a primitive treasure, it is much better
than your dirty pictures,” Liyu Zhen said with a cold laugh.</p>
<p>“That means there are higher-level Gold Slashes to be found,
right?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course there are. One of our leaders managed to obtain a
butterfly-class Gold Slash, but that doesn’t matter to you. Carry
on fishing up your useless, dirty porn… Haha!” Liyu Zhen held his
sword proudly and laughed as he wandered off. He laughed in
mockery.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t be bothered with the man. He thought to
himself, “It looks like the sword Bao’er got was also a Gold Slash.
But it is obvious that Bao’er’s is of a higher class. Which class
it is has yet to be determined, though.”</p>
<p>After Liyu Zhen left, Han Sen felt a lot more comfortable where
he was. It felt good to have no one watching him again. He planned
to fish one more item out of the lake, then let Bao’er carry on
while he went back to practicing with his geno arts.</p>
<p>Not long later, Han Sen felt the Underworld Silk move. Something
had latched onto the line.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it would just be another yellow paper, but the
item he pulled up was black. It wasn’t the same yellow paper as
before.</p>
<p>“Has my luck taken a change for the better?” Han Sen’s heart
jumped. He quickly grabbed the black thing to take a look at
it.</p>
<p>When Han Sen picked it up, a chill ran through him. This new
item was also a sheet of paper, but it was black this time, and it
was much thicker than the yellow sheets he had previously
retrieved.</p>
<p>“Am I going to collect seven different colors of paper before I
move on? Can I summon a dragon along with it?” Han Sen complained,
turning the paper over so he could check it out.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a look, and the sight made him freeze. This new
piece of paper was indeed quite different. The thick black
parchment appeared to be the cover of a book. Furthermore, there
were three words written on the front.</p>
<p>“Xuan Yellow Sutra. This cover cannot be a cover for all of
those yellow papers, can it?” Han Sen was shocked. He flipped it
over and had a look at all the small words inside the cover.</p>
<p>“If the man is in chaos, the sky and the earth will be in chaos.
And the sky and the earth will turn yellow.” Han Sen was shocked.
This line of words was the prologue of the Xuan Yellow Sutra. This
was definitely some sort of geno art, but it didn’t seem to have
anything to do with the yellow papers he had collected.</p>
<p>“Maybe this isn’t a cover for the yellow papers. Maybe it’s
meant for another book?” Han Sen thought the entire situation was
strange.</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated. While Bao’er began fishing, he brought out
all of the yellow papers and started to piece them together. He
noticed all of the yellow pages had numbers. So, Han Sen arranged
them in order of their numbers. There were many missing pages,
however. The highest number was 254, but Han Sen only had 20 pages
in total.</p>
<p>Han Sen put them down next to the Xuan Yellow Sutra and noticed
that their size was a perfect fit. Still, he couldn’t be sure if
the cover was really meant for his yellow papers.Han Sen thought
this was a bit weird. He looked at the contents of the yellow
paper, and when he looked over them, he felt a strange
sensation.</p>
<p>He thought the pictures had merely been the doodles of some
horny guy in ancient times, so he had never inspected them closely.
But now that he was, he noticed something.</p>
<p>The people in the picture were covered in thin veins of blue and
red. The small lines were very light. If Han Sen hadn’t decided to
examine the papers closely, he wouldn’t have noticed them at all.
Few drawings were so realistic that they mapped people’s veins and
arteries.</p>
<p>But after a thorough inspection, he realized they weren’t blood
vessels. The small, blue lines should have been meridians, and the
red were likely the presence.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so shocked, and he thought to himself, “This isn’t a
porn picture. It is a geno art! But why would a geno art look like
this? It is easy to misunderstand it.”</p>
<p>Due to the fact that there were no descriptions or text, and Han
Sen was missing many more pages, he couldn’t be entirely sure it
was a geno art. But regardless, his interest in it had been
sparked.</p>
<p>Han Sen took the Underworld Silk away from Bao’er. He continued
fishing, and a little while later, he fished up another yellow
paper.</p>
