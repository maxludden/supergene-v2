“How is that possible?” Everyone stared at Han Sen, who currently looked like a god.

The Gana people used all their powers on Han Sen, but they accomplished nothing. Han Sen’s body was like that of a real deity. He could shrug off any mortal damage inflicted upon him.

Icebird Duke looked at Han Sen. She was totally frozen, and her mind had come to a complete standstill. This was partly due to shock, but it was also because she had now discovered a secret. A very scary secret.

Icebird Duke was Yisha’s best friend. She was also her most loyal follower. Yisha put her absolute trust in Icebird Duke. They shared a lot of secrets with each other, and they disclosed many private and personal matters.

Yisha had told Icebird Duke that she was once bullied by someone in Demon’s Grave. The man that had bullied her was called Dollar.

Yisha had commanded her to keep her ears to the ground and learn anything she could about the elusive Dollar. Thus far, Icebird Duke had come up with zilch. But Yisha knew what Dollar looked like, and she was able to describe his powers.

The power Han Sen currently wielded was very similar to what Yisha had described. Yisha had mentioned all this more than once, so Icebird Duke remembered it well.

“Han Sen is Dollar? This is scary!” Icebird Duke felt chilled, and she broke out in a cold sweat.

Yisha’s important, all-mighty student was, in fact, her nemesis—the one she despised the most. Just thinking about that cruel twist of fate made Icebird Duke’s mind go for a loop. And as she looked down at Han Sen, he suddenly looked like a demon.

Han Sen did not have time to act in a model manner, though. When he donned his super king spirit mode, he lifted his Ghost Teeth Knife and let the knife rage with purple light. The purple light rose tangibly across the blade.

Super king spirit let Han Sen release the powers contained within all his gear. Like the holy angel bone arrow, Ghost Teeth Knife activated its own power.

Ghost Teeth Knife’s power, combined with Han Sen’s deified knifemind, rendered Guna and Guya speechless.

There was only one explanation for Han Sen being able to use terrifying powers like that in Purgatory Heaven; he must be a deified elite. Only deified elites could use their powers in Heaven, just as he was doing.

As they thought about fighting a deified elite, the Gana suddenly felt hopeless. Their faces were drawn and drained of color. Things weren’t looking good for them.

Guya was the palest of the bunch, though. She had the stone to control Purgatory Heaven, but she was not deified herself. All she had was the blood of the goddess’ lineage. She couldn’t control Heaven well. And she knew she wouldn’t be able to compete or bring that power to heel.

Gold Jade King and the other imprisoned Nobles all stared at Han Sen. Gold Jade King could not believe Knife Queen’s student was that strong.

Han Sen pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and started swinging it towards Guna and Guya. The lights of the knife were like individual monsters, wanting to swallow the entire dimension they resided in.

Guna and Guya’s faces turned grey. The Gana wanted to help them, but the knife was way too fast. They couldn’t react in time, and it was already coming down on the two women.

It didn’t hit Guna or Guya, though. It actually flew past them, striking the fountain behind them.

Katcha!

With that surge of power, the entire palace behind them was sundered in half.

That wasn’t the end, either. After the scary Teeth power cut the palace in two, it spread. A purple mist was swallowing it, making the palace looked like some cursed ruin.

*Boom!*

When the palace was covered in this purple mist, it suddenly shattered and fell to pieces. Dust choked the air, and the entirety of the heavenly realm rattled and shook.

Everyone was in utter shock. Seeing the god-like man and the palace he had reduced to rubble, no one could find the words to speak.

Han Sen put the knife back in the sheath on his waist, and then the white light faded. He looked normal once again. He looked at Guna and Guya and coldly said, “I thought you two were smart, and I would very much like to give you another chance. I’d like you and Guna to become my secretaries. What do you think of that proposal now?”

It was almost the same sentences as before, but now, the words sounded very different than before. Guya was catatonic. She just stood where she was. Now that Han Sen had dismissed that incredible power, he looked even more mysterious. He was like a god, disguised as a mortal.

Guya pulled Guna closer, and then she knelt. “Guna and I are willing to follow you. Our lives are dedicated to your service. Please spare us and the rest of our race from certain annihilation.”

irk-k

Planet Crooked Rock had suffered one mighty disaster. All the creatures there had been killed in one day, and that included all the Kings that were there. No corpses were left behind, either.

When the rescue teams arrived, they couldn’t find anything living. But judging from what they could see, a few people conjectured about what had happened. Purgatory Heaven was not a big secret, so they guessed that the Gana had attacked. Others came after that to investigate this incident, wanting to know where Purgatory Heaven was.

Han Sen was on his way back, on his ship. And he had something on his mind that was giving him quite the headache.

Guya and Guna were obeying him now, and Han Sen had taken measures to keep their lives in his hands and ensure they wouldn’t revolt.

Purgatory Heaven consumed everything on Planet Crooked Rock. It had stopped now, but the gem Guna and Guya used to control the statue had become a little gold statue that Han Sen had brought with him.

The Nobles and Gana were still locked in that Heaven, and Han Sen wasn’t planning to let them out anytime soon. After all, they had seen Han Sen become a super king spirit. He couldn’t trust them fully, and so he couldn’t release them back into the universe.

Especially Icebird Duke. He could not let her see Yisha again.

But if Icebird Duke did not return, what would he tell Yisha about what happened?

If he said that Icebird Duke disappeared on the planet, then how would he explain the fact that he was fine? If he told her that they weren’t on Planet Crooked Rock, why would Icebird Duke be gone?

Han Sen had gotten a headache just thinking about how he could explain all this.

The ship was not at Narrow Moon just yet, and still, Yisha’s battleship had come to meet with him. Her sudden appearance gave Han Sen a shock. He knew Yisha was coming after him and Icebird Duke.
