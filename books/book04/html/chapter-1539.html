<p>Goddess smiled and summoned God Ring. It seemed as if she wasn’t playing around.</p>

<p>Little Jade Lion saw that Goddess really was going to use God Ring to fight the Lionheart Stamp, and when he did, he felt far more secure.</p>

<p>“Sister, what is Goddess doing? God Ring used to lose against Lionheart Stamp. Does that mean she is going to lose again? If that’s the case, then the lion really is going to claim the tunnel,” Yu Xuan said.</p>

<p>Yu Miao frowned and said, “Goddess must have a trick up her sleeve. That naive Little Lion is going to lose.”</p>

<p>As they both spoke, God Ring and Lionheart Stamp engaged in battle.</p>

<p>Lionheart had been left behind by a super lion on Lion Mountain. It was one of the famous super geno cores of the place. One side of its shape possessed a gold lion head, which had a number of strange symbols upon it. In the language of lions, they merged together to form the word heart.</p>

<p>Lionheart Stamp was incredibly powerful, and its stamping ability was capable of suppressing everything. A weak super creature would easily find itself crushed beneath the weight of Lionheart’s demigod body. It was quite a frightening item.</p>

<p>God Ring had been left behind by one of Goddess’ elders. It was shaped like a halo, and it even possessed a holy-like light. Creatures that came into contact with it would have their lifeforce absorbed. It was a very powerful super geno core.</p>

<p>The Lionheart Stamp was shining gold towards God Ring, while God Ring shone a holy-like light back at Lionheart Stamp. Lionheart Stamp’s gold light soon started to suppress the God Ring’s light, making it clear that it wouldn’t take long for Goddess to lose.</p>

<p>Han Sen found it interesting to observe. He was a good distance away from the super geno cores, but he could still feel the earthy rumble of the combat. Due to the amount of power colliding, it put stress on the glaciers and began to break them. Everything within a few klicks was utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>This was taking place inside God Ruin, thankfully. If this was happening outside, entire mountains would have been sundered.</p>

<p>“There’s such strength in these cores, but strangely, they’re no better than my God geno core. I don’t know if they have any others that are better, but if they don’t, I can definitely strike.” Han Sen’s eyes shone while he thought.</p>

<p>Seeing Lionheart Stamp’s gold light crush and diminish the light exuded by God Ring, it was evident its enemy wasn’t going to last very long.</p>

<p>Lionheart Stamp’s gold stamp was preparing to deal a final blow and crush the ring for good. If it was stamped, it had no hope of withstanding the force, and it would shatter.</p>

<p>Little Jade Lion was feeling very cocky now, but when Lionheart Stamp decided to drop down on God Ring, he suddenly saw the holy light increase in volume. It shone brightly to absorb its bully, and in a flash, Lionheart Stamp disappeared into the blinding light.</p>

<p>When the light dimmed again, the white halo ring had grown smaller to tighten itself around Lionheart Stamp like a constrictive band. Lionheart Stamp’s gold light had also been extinguished in the grip of the ring.</p>

<p>Goddess held out her hand, and shortly after, God Ring landed in her palm with the shrunken Lionheart Stamp inside it.</p>

<p>“How is that possible?” Little Jade Lion’s face changed, and his eyes almost fell out of their sockets. He could not believe Lionheart Stamp had been taken away from him by God Ring.</p>

<p>Lionheart Stamp had gone up against God Ring a few times in the past, and not once had God Ring won before. It had constantly ranked below Lionheart Stamp, as well. But suddenly, it had been given the necessary power to constrict and lock-up Lionheart Stamp. It was an act Little Jade Lion struggled to believe he was seeing.</p>

<p>“How is that possible? Surely that cannot be God Ring. How can God Ring possess enough power to snare Lionheart Stamp?” Yu Xuan was shocked, too. He couldn’t believe Goddess was holding the ring with Lionheart Stamp trapped inside.</p>

<p>“That is God Ring, yes, but it is the complete version.” Yu Miao spoke with a serious tone.</p>

<p>“A complete version? Did it used to be damaged?” Yu Xuan looked at Yu Miao. He knew about God Ring, but he had never heard that it was damaged.</p>

<p>But Yu Miao shook her head and said, “It wasn’t damaged, but the ring has a very special history.”</p>

<p>Yu Miao paused for a minute, and then spoke again. “Goddess and her people are creatures, but they claim to be the heirs of a god. Whether that is true, I do not know, but their race does have many berserk super creatures. The most famous was undoubtedly God Lord of Sacred. Around the same time God Lord was among us, there was another powerful being in existence. It was a berserk super creature, and it was almost as famous as God Lord. Unfortunately, it lost in a pivotal battle and failed to become Sacred’s leader.”</p>

<p>“Was he the one that had God Ring?” Yu Xuan looked shocked.</p>

<p>Yu Miao nodded. “The power of the Protoss was special, and that was because half of their blood did not belong to them. Perhaps it came from their mother, but their powers were not purely Protoss. The berserk super geno cores, even if used by the Protoss, could not exert their full power. The powers displayed were no different than an average super geno core. And as time has gone on, few people remember that this is one such geno core. They have forgotten it is an actual berserk super geno core.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say Goddess is able to use all its strength? Is she a pure Protoss? If others of her kind were unable to make use of its full power, how can she?” Yu Xuan was now looking Goddess with a disbelieving look.</p>

<p>Yu Miao shook her head. “I don’t know, but that matters little right now. The important thing to know right now is that this puts us in a bad situation. I seriously hope the lion isn’t as stubborn as his old man. Otherwise, there’ll be no chance for us to take Godlight Tunnel.”</p>

<p>Goddess took her ring and returned Lionheart Stamp to the lion. Then, she said, “Little Lion King, will you keep your promise?”</p>

<p>Little Jade Lion King took the stamp. His face had turned green, and he couldn’t bring himself to say anything about breaking the deal.</p>

<p>“Little Lion King is no stranger to defeat. We can guard Godlight Tunnel together and reap the benefits ourselves,” Yu Miao shouted out, from across the way.</p>

<p>“If I lose, I lose. This Godlight Tunnel has nothing to do with Lion Mountain anymore.” Little Jade Lion gritted his teeth, then signaled those from Lion Mountain to vacate the area around the tunnel.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Before Little Lion King could leave, someone was heard shouting from beyond the valley.</p>

<p>Everyone looked over and saw the person shouting at Little Lion King was none other than Han Sen. They were shocked, and they did not know what he wanted.</p>
