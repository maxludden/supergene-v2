<p>Night River King shouldn’t have stayed that close to Han Sen.
The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s attack wouldn’t have been so potent
if the distance between them had been greater. At such close range,
Night River King had tried to attack Han Sen without reserving any
of his strength for defense. His King class body was unable to
withstand the noise unleashed by the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.</p>
<p>The sound of the drum was like the sting of a scorpion tail,
jabbing directly into his brain. Thinking suddenly became very
difficult, and he felt as if his head was going to explode.
Gathering the willpower necessary for the smallest action became
almost impossible.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s hand kept pounding the Jade Drum in a simple
rhythm.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Every beat of the
rhythm felt like a thick needle being driven deeper into Night
River King’s skull. He clutched his head and screamed aloud. He
couldn’t control his body, and so he started to fall.</p>
<p>The booming of the drum echoed through the sky. It hit the gold
Bai Sema, but the shield blocked it. The noise couldn’t hurt Han
Yan and the others, who were still safely ensconced in the
shield.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed along with the rhythm to slash Night River
King. The powerful beats of the drum didn’t affect him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood, which possessed the power of the Blood-Pulse
Sutra, had sunk deep into the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. Although he
couldn’t totally control the Jade Drum yet, some of his blood had
merged into the Blood Scorpion. A connection was beginning to form
between the two.</p>
<p>The Blood Scorpion believed Han Sen was a part of it, so it had
decided not to hurt him.</p>
<p>Han Sen wielded his knife like a ravaging demon. He stood
directly over Night River King and slashed the Rebate’s neck over
and over. The knife let out a shrieking metal noise every time it
struck, and a light mark began to split the neck.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t Night River King’s biggest problem. Bao’er’s
drum went on and on, and as long as it continued to beat, Night
River King would be unable to fight back. He clutched his head, and
he was soon bleeding from every orifice.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept striking the same spot, making the wound a little
larger with every blow. The purple knife air was scarier than
ever.</p>
<p>If one slash didn’t work, then a hundred slashes were sure to.
If a hundred slashes didn’t work, though, then it would take a
thousand slashes. It didn’t matter how tough Night River King’s
body was; he would have a limit, and Han Sen would find it. Night
River King wouldn’t be able to withstand those cuts forever.</p>
<p>An ordinary Marquise couldn’t even cut the skin of a King, but
Han Sen’s knife air was so strong that he could destroy far more
than a normal Marquise could. Not even Dukes could compete with
him.</p>
<p>And Teeth powers also had a tearing force. As Han Sen slashed
the wound, he let that teeth power build up. The purple wound
became deeper and deeper, while the tearing force became stronger
and stronger.</p>
<p>Bai Wei was still standing inside the Bai Sema. She watched as
Han Sen began cutting into Night River King’s neck, as the blood
began to spill. The scene left her speechless.</p>
<p>Han Sen had given her many surprises, and he had proven himself
to possess both confidence and a fine sense of judgment. He had a
shield that could withstand the blow of a deified enemy, and on top
of that, he had a Jade Drum that could leave a King class elite
dazed and disoriented. All of Han Sen’s possessions made the
Extreme King queen jealous.</p>
<p>If Bai Wei wanted a King or deified weapon, she could get them
easily.</p>
<p>But having such a weapon would matter little. She was just a
Marquise, and she couldn’t utilize the full powers of a deified
weapon. It would be pointless for her to have one.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen’s tri-colored shield could be used by a
Marquise, and it could block deified attacks. It was difficult to
imagine what sort of treasure that was.</p>
<p>Bai Wei recognized the Jade Drum, too. Even though the Jade Drum
was King class, she couldn’t strike the Jade Drum in the same way
Bao’er was able to. She could never deliver such an impact against
a King class opponent.</p>
<p>Even more frightening, the person using the Jade Drum to unleash
such devastating attacks was just a child. She looked like a
five-year-old kid.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept slashing, and eventually, Night River King’s neck
was cut open. Blood spilled out freely, and even the bone was
marked by his blows.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed at it endlessly. The Teeth power was sinking in
the bone, ripping at it. Marks covered the bone now.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed again, and his Ghost Teeth Knife split the bone
open. Night River King’s head dangled.</p>
<p>Night River King had been dazed by the drum, and he couldn’t
fight back. Blood trailed from his eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved for Bao’er to stop hitting the Blood Scorpion Jade
Drum. He looked at the half-dead Night River King. “Who sent you to
kill me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t believe Night River King had the pull to come to
Planet Ice Blue and attempt to assassinate him alone. If Night
River King owned the Ancient God statuette, he wouldn’t have saved
it for that day.</p>
<p>Night River King had wanted to kill Han Sen long before they
left with the Extreme King.</p>
<p>Han Sen already knew the answer, but he still wanted to confirm
it.</p>
<p>Night River King’s neck was in the process of breaking, and the
Teeth powers were tearing ever deeper into the wound. As his
grievous wounds deepened, he lay on the ground, completely
immobile. His face was bleeding, and his eyes were starting to
close.</p>
<p>“No… don’t… kill… me…” Night River King’s eyes turned white as
he mumbled. He had blood leaking out of his mouth, so his words
were garbled.</p>
<p>“Who sent you to kill me?” Han Sen repeated his question.</p>
<p>“In… Inspector… Don’t kill me…” Night River King’s words were
clear enough to remove all doubt.</p>
<p>Upon hearing what the man said, Han Sen just slashed. He severed
Night River King’s neck that was still being devoured by his Teeth
power.</p>
<p>Night River King’s head rolled away. A King class elite had been
killed.</p>
<p>Han Sen had needed to know who was behind all of this, but no
good would come from keeping Night River King alive. His word alone
wouldn’t be strong enough to take down Edward.</p>
<p>Edward might have had more opportunity to distort the truth if
Night River King was left alive. Saving Night River King would have
been possible.</p>
<p>After killing Night River King, Han Sen looted the corpse. There
were two King class Moon Wheel Blades to take, and a bunch of other
things as well. But these weren’t beast souls that could go in his
Sea of Soul; Han Sen had to physically carry them. He was already
carrying many of his own things, so there was a limit to how much
he could take.</p>
<p>The two Moon Wheel Blades had to be extraordinarily expensive.
He should be able to swap them and some of the other items for King
class xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>After killing Night River King, Han Sen couldn’t search anymore.
So, he destroyed the camera and took Night River King’s body back
to base.</p>
<p>Han Sen blamed Night River King for destroying the camera, and
that excuse managed to save him a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King was enraged upon Han Sen’s return. It
wasn’t because Night River King had sought to kill Han Sen, though;
he was angry because Bai Wei had almost been killed.</p>
