<h2>The Power That Comes From the Plane</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2150</h3>

<p>“Han Sen, I have heard your name before, but I certainly did not
expect to see you here.” The three-headed, six-armed statue stepped
in front of the Bai Sema. The bird head in its center peered
directly at Han Sen. It looked how a demon might, when staring at a
defenseless baby in an abandoned stroller.</p>
<p>To Han Sen and the others, the strength of the metal statues was
awe-inspiring. They were completely surrounded. And of course, the
dragonfly-like xenogeneics were still flying about. There were too
many of the insects to count, which made the situation of Han Sen’s
team completely depressing.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked, looking up at the giant
three-headed, six-armed statue.</p>
<p>“My name is Klinsmann of the Destroyed,” the statue replied. As
it spoke, the other statues stopped trying to attack. They merely
stood where they were.</p>
<p>“I did not expect the Destroyed to be part of the Breakskies,”
Han Sen said coldly.</p>
<p>Klinsmann laughed and said, “You are incorrect. The Destroyed
are not a part of the Breakspies, as you suggest; we are the
royalty of the Breakskies. Those stupid giants were just slaves
with a few drops of our blood in their systems. We are the real
Breakskies.”</p>
<p>“So, this is the home of a deified Breaksky?” Han Sen asked
curiously.</p>
<p>Klinsmann laughed. “I know you are merely stalling for time, but
that is fine. The Destroyed control everything here. You cannot
hope to run.”</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Klinsmann continued on to say, “This is the
house of a deified Breaksky, and yes, it has been abandoned. The
deified elite it once belonged to has long been missing. But the
Breaksky dolls he left behind are enough for us to claim the entire
Metal World for ourselves. Those who are above the rank of Marquise
are not permitted entry, so our grip as rulers of this place is not
challenged. This place will become the primary xenogeneic space of
the Destroyed. And as for your place here…”</p>
<p>Klinsmann turned his metal bird head to stare at each of them.
“If you people are willing to concede, the Destroyed will welcome
you as members of Metal World’s society.”</p>
<p>“Klinsmann, I’m afraid I don’t quite share your optimism,” Han
Sen said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The woman’s face, the face to the right of
the bird head, turned toward him.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around and said, “I have heard that before you
came to this city, this place was already the site of a
battle.”</p>
<p>“So what? Of course there was once a fight. Otherwise, why would
it be a ruin?” the woman said.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “Metal World’s power is strong enough
that outsiders cannot break through, and only Marquises can be sent
in to do research. That means the powers from the outside are
unable to affect this place. But if that is so, why was there a
fight dangerous enough to force a deified elite to abandon this
place?”</p>
<p>Klinsmann frowned. The man’s face of the statue then spoke
instead. “Perhaps the attacker broke through the power of Metal
World and forced himself in?”</p>
<p>“The same power that prohibited five of our elites from breaking
through? If that deified elite did force his way through, do you
really think the Breakskies could have escaped a being like that?
And even if they ran, why would that elite take over Metal World
and not lay a lasting claim on the place?” Han Sen went on to
say.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” the woman asked again.</p>
<p>“If my assumptions are correct, the Breakskies didn’t abandon
this place because of enemies from beyond. Their greatest threat
must have come from the planet itself.”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?” The statue next to Klinsmann
looked annoyed.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “The power that threatened the
Breakskies, if it came from the planet, focused only on you. I
doubt that it threatened anyone other than the Breakskies. If I
were you, I wouldn’t be so cocky. I might be thinking about running
as far away as possible, actually. There is a high chance that
you’ll be killed well before us.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! If there was a power like that, it would be long
gone. If it exists, then why hasn’t it shown up? Han Sen, I admire
your intelligence. I do not want to kill you. I am throwing you one
last lifeline here. Concede, and I will stay my cruelty.” The bird
head smiled grimly.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak again. He merely focused on how he might
get out of the situation they were in. The things he was telling
Klinsmann weren’t all a bluff. If the power that wiped out of the
Breakskies truly did come from the planet, it wouldn’t be
extinguished so easily. After all the years that had passed, that
power might still exist somewhere.</p>
<p>“If you truly seek death, then I will grant your wish.”
Klinsmann commanded a dozen Breaksky statues to attack the Bai
Serna.</p>
<p>The Breaksky dolls launched a variety of terrifying powers which
converged on the demon bug Bai Sema. The blue Bai Sema trembled,
and it looked ready to buckle and break.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought things were pretty dire. Each Breaksky doll had
King class power. If Han Sen shrank the demon bug Bai Sema to
shield just himself, its strength would be concentrated enough to
withstand the force of his aggressors. Even if ten Kings attacked
him, they’d be unable to penetrate its defense. But now, Han Sen
had his demon bug Bai Sema stretched to shield one hundred Sky
Palace students, and the Demon, Buddha, and Dragon as well. The
defense was stretched thin, and thus, it was weakened. It couldn’t
protect them from a constant stream of attacks from a dozen
dolls.</p>
<p>Seeing the Bai Sema quiver, they all knew it was going to break
soon. And Han Sen also knew they’d have to run. They couldn’t stay
where they were. Even if he kicked out the Demon, Buddha, and
Dragon, the demon bug Bai Sema likely wouldn’t be enough to keep
the hundred Marquises safe, either.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, let us out! Perhaps some can survive that way,” Dragon
Eight shouted, knowing that the Bai Sema was about to break.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! We have to fight,” a Buddha Marquise said.</p>
<p>Kahn frowned. His face kept flickering through a cycle of
different emotions. He knew their situation was dire.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but just as he was about to
speak, the earth began to shake like a huge earthquake was
underway. And then, an enormous sinkhole opened in the city. The
metal surface caved in, falling into the seemingly bottomless hole.
The sound of explosions echoed up out of the hole, signaling that
something big was coming.</p>
<p>All of the Breaksky dolls stopped attacking Han Sen and turned
their attention to the bottomless pit.</p>
<p>The dragonfly xenogeneics all buzzed away. They flew straight
out of the city, jostling each other in their panic. If there was a
power that was able to force the deified Breaksky to abandon the
planet, it would probably kill anything in its path.</p>
<p>“No way! I was right?” Han Sen smiled wrily.</p>
<p>The Breaksky dolls that were commanded by Klinsmann all took a
step back. They peered at the giant hole.</p>
