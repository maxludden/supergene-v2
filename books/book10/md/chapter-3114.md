The stone orb was like a sky full of stars. Thousand Mile Reach used a mysterious way to reach Han Sen. Through the stars and chess pieces, he blocked every possible way for Han Sen to evade.

Han Sen squinted his eyes. He wanted to get up and go past the star tracks and appear before Thousand Mile Reach.

No matter how strong Thousand Mile Reach was, he was not as strong as Han Sen. If he was able to get in front of him, Han Sen could beat him up.

In this world, when faced with Han Sen, humans were like sorcerers while he was a fighter. No matter how Han Sen’s body was suppressed by the world, his strength remained. Even if it was a small skirmish, it would not have been difficult for him to beat Thousand Mile Reach.

Unfortunately, Han Sen had only just gathered up power. He moved but immediately froze. He looked at the stone orb that was flying down. He seemed to realize something.

Because he was restrained by the rules of the world, his powers of sense were weak in the universe of kingdoms. Aside from ordinary vision and hearing, his sense powers were not strong.

According to theory, when Han Sen used body power, he felt a strong suppression from the rules of the world. It was like walking up a waterfall.

This time, he gathered up power to move and did not feel such a restriction.

“The chess world is not really a space world. It is just a mental world.” Han Sen now understood it. This was a psychological hallucination. It was a world that did not truly exist. His body was still sitting near the chessboard playing chess with Thousand Mile Reach. His real body wasn’t inside this world.

“This kind of mental world power is weird. As for competing one’s mental powers with mine, even a God Spirit wouldn’t be able to fight me.” Han Sen felt a huge relief.

If there was a power in that world that Han Sen could still use, aside from his body, it was the mind he used to practice. He did not bother using it.

With the power of attacks in the mental world, putting him inside a mental world was like placing a sheep in the mouth of a tiger. If Han Sen discovered that, it would not work to defeat him.

The stone orb, which looked like starlight, fell. Han Sen stood where he was without dodging. He just calmly watched it.

Thousand Mile Reach saw Han Sen’s lips display a smile. For some reason, his heart jumped. There was some unsettling feel growing in his heart.

“No way. He has been pulled into my chess world. I am the god here. I can control everything.” Thousand Mile Reach was deep in thought.

Seeing the stone orb was going to land on him, Han Sen coldly said. “The sky and the earth are like chess. I am a chess piece, but so what? If there is no chess piece, then there can be no chess match. Without me, there is no sky and earth. I am the sky and the earth. The sky and the earth are me.”

His words sounded very crazy. Thousand Mile Reach coldly grunted and wished to say something. He suddenly saw the stone orb uncontrollably stop. It was like stars were spinning around Han Sen.

Thousand Mile Reach was shocked. He quickly used gene race powers for his chess world. He wanted to take back control of the chess world’s power. He was frightened to learn that under the chess god’s buff, the chess world’s mental power was unable to move Han Sen’s will.

“How is that possible? Is his willpower stronger than a Disaster class God Spirit?” Thousand Mile Reach looked at Han Sen with shock. He could not believe this was happening. “In the sky and on the ground, I am the best. Whoever follows me will be treated nicely. Whoever stands in my way will die.” Han Sen’s voice was like that of a god. The whole chess world kept changing. Many stone orbs turned into scary knife lights that tore up space. It was like it was destroying the sky and the ground. It was like a tide going into Thousand Mile Reach.

Just as Han Sen thought, their bodies were perched at the chessboard. They were just sitting there.

“Old Yang, what is going on? They moved one chess piece. Suddenly, Han Sen and the teacher stopped moving.” Qin Bai looked at the two of them, unaware of what was actually going on. “Crown Prince, I do not know either.” Mister Yang smiled.

Li Bing Yu was nearby. She looked at Qin Bai’s back. She struggled with indecision. “Thousand Mile Reach has a chess soul God Spirit Blood-Pulse. He is a high-class, god-blood noble. He has the ultimate mode god-class gene race called chess world teacher. His power is not something Han Sen is capable of dealing with. Han Sen has just made a big mistake. If his psychology breaks and Crown Prince Qin Bai is taken away, he is going to die. This is my final chance to assassinate Qin Bai.”

Although she thought this way, the entire Feng castle was surrounded by the king’s guards. There were also many elites there. If she assassinated Qin Bai, she had nowhere to run.

If she missed out on this opportunity, she wouldn’t get another.

“If he can break Qin Kingdom’s bloodline, then sacrificing my life would be worth it for that endeavor.” Li Bing Yu made her decision. She decided to kill Qin Bai. She felt shocked shortly after and looked away.

She saw Jian Bu Gu was holding a tea set. He was walking toward them from afar. He had a very innocent smile on his face.

Li Bing Yu immediately stopped her murder attempt. She could not do it because of Han Sen and Jian Bu Gu. Han Sen was controlled by Thousand Mile Reach, but Jian Bu Gu was still there.

Although Jian Bu Gu made the promise not to use power, he used to be the Qin Kingdom’s king teacher. He was King Jing Zhen’s teacher. Li Bing Yu did not think he would just sit and watch the only extension of the Qin Kingdom’s bloodline be murdered.

“Even if I do not fight now, I will not have another chance.” While Li Bing Yu was still hesitating, the chessboard displayed movement.

Li Bing Yu looked over there. She saw Thousand Mile Reach sitting there holding a chess piece. He suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood that dyed the chessboard red. He collapsed onto the floor.

Thousand Mile Reach laid on the floor with a pale face. His white beard was colored red due to the blood. He opened his eyes in shock and looked at Han Sen.

The people watching were shocked. They wondered why Thousand Mile Reach had become like that after only moving one chess piece.

“Teacher, you never played checkers before. It is normal for you not to know how to play it. You do not need to rush this.” Qin Bai quickly went to hold Thousand Mile Reach. He comforted him, but he was very happy. Inside, he thought, “Han Sen is very powerful. He made the teacher end up like this. With Han Sen by my side, he will never bully me again.”

Qin Bai picked up Thousand Mile Reach. He pointed at Han Sen and wished to say something, but he suddenly saw another person next to Han Sen. He was holding a tea set.

“Mister, the tea is done.” Jian Bu Gu put the tea set down in front of Han Sen.

When Thousand Mile Reach saw Jian Bu Gu’s face, he was given a shock. His eyes almost popped out of their sockets. It was like he had seen a ghost. He shook off Qin Bai’s arm, went forward, and bowed. “Teacher Jian, why are you here?”

“Mister, you have mistaken me with someone else. I am only Mister Han’s servant. I am not a teacher.” Jian Bu Gu placed a teacup in front of Thousand Mile Reach. He told him to enjoy it and left.
