	<p>Han Sen learnt more about Geno Seeds from Ji Yanran. Perusing the information she provided him, though, he noted
		that it wasn&#8217;t very substantial. He did learn that Geno Seeds were able to absorb all manners of genes,
		and which genes they absorbed would affect what grew inside them.</p>

	<p>Some could grow geno equipment, whereas others could grow creatures. Others could form spirits or beast souls.
		What they chose to grow was influenced by the energies they absorbed.</p>

	<p>Humans and spirits knew how to create Geno Seeds that they favored, and this was accomplished by injecting the
		genes of their choice into one. Doing so would enable the altered Geno Seed to create what the injector
		specifically sought.</p>

	<p>Different sanctuaries had different ways of cultivating Geno Seeds. And the stuff they produced was different
		from place to place.</p>

	<p>But humans lacked a lot of information about Geno Seeds, and as a result, Han Sen was unable to discover anything
		revealing about the nature of his gourd or the six Cog armaments.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It looks like this is a mystery that will only reveal itself once I reach the Third God&#8217;s
		Sanctuary.&#8221; After Han Sen deleted the confidential information he had received, he returned to the
		sanctuary.</p>

	<p>All of a sudden, he received orders bidding him to join a training program.</p>

	<p>Han Sen went back to ask Ji Yanran about it, and she said it was a training program of the Alliance. It was
		something related to the Crystallizer civilization. All members of the Daphne had to take part, including her.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen had no choice but to join, since he was issued the order. He wasn&#8217;t strong enough to take-on the
		entire Alliance yet, so he still had to adhere to whatever order was given to him by the council. Unfortunately
		for him, however, it threw a wrench in his plans of attacking Devil-Blood Shelter again. It would be delayed.
	</p>

	<p>The Devil-Blood King had been heavily damaged, and he was lacking his former power. Han Sen believed he could
		take out Devil-Blood Shelter and max out his super geno points in the process.</p>

	<p>Spirit Owl and Death Knell had not finished evolving yet, though, and they were two companions he thought he
		might need. As a result, he didn&#8217;t think it&#8217;d do much harm to go to the training program first.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen arrived at the training base at Moka Planet, he was surprised to see that it wasn&#8217;t only his
		team that was receiving the training.</p>

	<p>A lot of Crystallizer Ruin research members would receive this training, as well. All in all, there were more
		than ten thousand people there.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Han Sen! You are Han Sen, yes?&#8221; Immediately after arriving, Han Sen was greeted by someone who
		fanboyishly recognized him. The man hastily moved to intercept him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was quite happy about this, and he couldn&#8217;t help but think, &#8220;Haha, I really am rather
		popular.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I am Han Sen.&#8221; The person in front of him was a twenty-year-old soldier. Han Sen was pleased at
		the reception he was given, and he was about to ask the man if he wanted an autograph.</p>

	<p>But jovially, the young man quickly said, &#8220;It really is you? Sweet! Your fiance is the princess of the
		Alliance, Ji Yanran. We are very fond of her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What the hell?&#8221; Han Sen had rarely felt so awkward. He explained to them, &#8220;Well, for what I
		suspect you will ask next, the answer is yes. She will be joining the training program, too. You can see her
		later.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Whoa! Awesome!&#8221;</p>

	<p>A bunch of soldiers began to babble amongst themselves. Then, a woman soldier approached Han Sen and handed him a
		pen and paper. She politely asked, &#8220;Can I have your signature, please?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Han Sen noticed that this female soldier was attractively challenged, but still he thought, &#8220;Well, at the
		very least, women have better judgment, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221; Han Sen smiled and accepted the pen and paper, ready to scribble his signature. But just
		as he was about to bring the pen down on the paper, the female soldier said, &#8220;Can you write, Ji
		Yanran&#8217;s fiance for your name?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Han Sen almost bit his tongue off, and was tempted to grab her clothes and yell, &#8220;Are you trying to make me
		look like a fool? How shameless are you, asking me to sign this?!&#8221;</p>

	<p>The female soldier, however, looked like a very shy individual. Despite being disheartened, Han Sen complied with
		her request and proceeded to scribble down Ji Yanran&#8217;s fiance.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yay! I have obtained the signature of Ji Yanran&#8217;s fiance! Woohoo!&#8221; The soldier thanked Han Sen
		with a frightening amount of glee and hugged the paper tightly.</p>

	<p>Han Sen heard a familiar voice laughing somewhere nearby. He turned around and saw a familiar yet strange shadow.
	</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mengmeng?&#8221; Han Sen was very surprised, but still he approached her. He had not expected to see Wang
		Mengmeng there.</p>

	<p>Since he last saw her, she had grown taller. She exuded a sense of greater maturity, but her overall appearance
		was still an undeniable victim of her babyface.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Tell me, Handsome; as the fiance of a princess, do you feel pressured?&#8221; Wang Mengmeng asked, with
		her eyes wide open in curiosity.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before arriving here, I believed myself to be a figure of greater fame than she was.&#8221; Han Sen was
		feeling hopeless.</p>

	<p>Wang Mengmeng smiled and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s normal, don&#8217;t worry. The president has a beautiful
		daughter, and it is not uncommon for people to crave every tidbit of news about what the president is up to. Of
		course the media chases her, and her title as Princess is formally recognized throughout the entire Alliance.
		Even the news of your triumph against Yu Qielan referred to you as &#8216;the princess&#8217;s
		fiance.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>Han Sen wasn&#8217;t affected by this, however. He simply shrugged his shoulders and said, &#8220;I recall you
		are a member of the Royal Warframe Team, so how come you are here today? Why are you here, taking part in
		today&#8217;s special training?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Honestly? I&#8217;m not sure. Some of us received the order to come, whereas others didn&#8217;t. Perhaps
		there is an important operation regarding the Crystallizers?&#8221; Wang Mengmeng hypothesized.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s walk and talk; where is your room?&#8221; Han Sen spoke as he walked alongside Wang Mengmeng.
	</p>

	<p>In an office of the training camp, an old man watched a video stream of the ongoing scene between Han Sen and
		Wang Mengmeng.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Teacher, would you like to me to bring Han Sen here?&#8221; Wen Zhong asked the old man.</p>

	<p>The old man shook his head and said, &#8220;No, there is no need to. I do not wish to make my identity and
		presence known to him yet. I will continue to watch them in secret, in the meantime.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Um, I don&#8217;t think that is very appropriate,&#8221; Wen Zhong said, in surprise.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t inappropriate. It makes for a compelling watch, that&#8217;s all.&#8221; The old man smiled
		as he looked at Han Sen. Then he said, &#8220;I can see the real him like this.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Teacher, do you really want to accept him as a student of yours?&#8221; Wen Zhong was hesitant to ask this
		question, but he did so anyway.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe. Maybe not. First, I have to meet with him,&#8221; the old man said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I still think it is inappropriate. He hails from the Luo family, after all.&#8221; Wen Zhong wore a
		complicated expression.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then doesn&#8217;t that make for an even more compelling watch? I, Zhuo Donglai, having a student from the
		Luo family would be rather interesting, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; The old man squinted his eyes, with a
		smile that could only be defined as perfect.</p>
