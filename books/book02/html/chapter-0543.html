    <p>
      Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s beast soul was a sacred-blood class beast soul from
      the Second Shelter. After his transformation, his speed and strength
      greatly increased.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, despite these improvements, they was clearly not enough for him to
      escape his predicament. If Han Sen&#8217;s fist touched any part of his
      body, it would burst through and significantly damage his internal organs.
    </p>

    <p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Fists collided in quick succession, but Xue Yi Yang, who had already
      transformed with the aid of a beast soul, was only beaten back further.
      Blood gushed from his nose, mouth and ears.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone watching this was highly surprised. Xue Yi Yang was already using
      a beast soul and yet he was still being beaten badly. His opponent was
      truly frightening.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;How can he be so strong?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This man is terrifying! This guy is off the charts. He is using
      Nano Crystal to prevent Xue Yi Yang from fighting back; that&#8217;s
      sick!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      To everyone&#8217;s disbelief, Xue Yi Yang had already been pushed to the
      edge of the arena. His mouth was agape in rage and his face contorted to a
      look that refused to concede. But he just could not stand his ground
      against Han Sen&#8217;s fists. His body was like an ice demon, but then
      another punch hit him. He went flying off the stage.
    </p>

    <p>Crash!</p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Yang was furious and his organs had received significant damage.
      Through overwhelming anger, his body had finally reached its tipping
      point, and he passed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not take a look at his opponent, who was now being rushed to
      recovery. He left the stage and returned to where he had been sitting. The
      people in the Xue family weren&#8217;t as strong as he had expected.
      Although Xue Yi Yang had learntJadeskin, there was something not quite
      right with his variant. It definitely did not come close to usefulness of
      Han Sen&#8217;sJadeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The greatest benefit ofJadeskin was its ability to reinforce your
      body&#8217;s bones and organs. That meant your internal organs would be as
      strong as your exterior. Despite Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s use ofJadeskin, and
      subsequent reinforcement of his organs, they were still weaker than his
      exterior. That was the difference between hisJadeskin and the one Han Sen
      had learnt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know what was going on. If he had learned the wrong skill,
      that meant Xue Yi Yang&#8217;sJadeskin could end up greater than his. But,
      right now, it was clear that it wasn&#8217;t. It was most strange.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after all, it was just a duel in an exchange event. Han Sen had not
      fully exerted himself; if he had, all of Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s organs would
      have been destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Sen Sen, you are really good!&#8221; Lin Wei Wei smiled and
      patted him on the shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It was only because that guy was so weak,&#8221; Han Sen replied
      casually; but that was the truth. The Xue family was definitely not as
      strong as he had thought.
    </p>

    <p>After the exchange event ended, they went inside the airship.</p>

    <p>
      The bookwormish man looked shocked at Xue Yi Kuang and said, &#8220;You
      did not do anything to Han Sen; that&#8217;s not your style.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s jaw was sharp like a blade. His eyes were black like
      onyx, and just as cold. His long hair casually flowed down his shoulders.
      It was still tidy, and each strand was refined like ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That was an exchange event. What difference does it make if I go
      out there and beat him up? He had hurt my family - beating him up would be
      too small a punishment. Help me check which shelter he comes from,&#8221;
      Xue Yi Kuang said. His face displayed no emotion, and his manner could run
      chills down the hardiest of spines.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Second Shelter is too dangerous. Is it necessary for us to jump
      to another shelter to kill him?&#8221; the bookworm asked.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Xue Yi Kuang said quietly.</p>

    <p>
      The bookworm laughed and then started his search for Han Sen. Soon after,
      he sent his findings to Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s communicator. &#8220;Your
      luck is bad. He is in the ice field bordering the North Ice Sea. That
      place is too isolated. You would have to cross a great amount of large,
      barren landscapes to reach there. There are many spirit shelters.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s fine by me.&#8221; Xue Yi Kuang replied. Then, he
      stepped inside a teleporter.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen returned, he immediately started to learn the Dongxue Sutra.
      He was already a beginner in the practice, but that was all. It was still
      going to take him a long time to pass the first entrance and open his
      first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the exchange event, Han Sen had received many benefits. According to
      the Qi Gong that Lin Wei Wei discussed, Han Sen had to look back to
      theJadeskin skill. He realized he should have already have opened his
      first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      AlthoughJadeskin was not as effective as the Dongxue Sutra, it still had
      nine tiers, only one less than the aforementioned sutra. According to what
      Han Sen had heard, if he had learnt the first tier, then he should have
      unlocked the first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen did not feel any different or special following his opening of
      the gene lock. Aside from being able to inhale frost air and to progress
      withJadeskin more quickly, there was no sign of him being able to control
      the powers of the universe. This was unlike the tales of others who had
      opened their first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Yang&#8217;sJadeskin had not even gone past the first tier, but his
      usage had already yielded large amounts of frost air. It seemed as if Xue
      Yi Yang had managed to break through the first tier, which would allow him
      to control the power of ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had already ascended past the first tier but the results did not
      display the effects he had expected. This confused him, and it made him
      ponder whether he had learnt the wrong skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is it because I did not use the geno solution produced exclusively
      forJadeskin?&#8221; Han Sen asked himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was just one idea to pass through his mind. Although he did not have
      the power to control ice, he was still satisfied with hisJadeskin -
      particularly in the way it would reinforce his genes. Now that he had
      learnt the basics of the Dongxue Sutra, he was confident about learning it
      in its entirety.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen closed his eyes. His blood coursed through his body exactly as he
      wanted it to, and the cells in his body made happy noises. Even if it was
      for just a second, Han Sen&#8217;s body was crystal clear, like jade. A
      pleasant scent permeated the air around him. The sound of his breathing
      was divine, coming in and out of his nose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood flow in Han Sen&#8217;s body steadily accelerated. It was as if
      his entire body had become a magnet, and a sparkling light was being drawn
      into his body. He was becoming transparent, and exuded a glorious light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slowly, his breathing began to weaken. The cells of his body started
      shrinking with his air intake.
    </p>

    <p>
      If someone touched Han Sen&#8217;s nose, they would be scared. He was no
      longer breathing at all, like a dead body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although no longer breathing, Han Sen did not feel unpleasant. The cells
      in his body possessed a strange strength that made him feel as if he was
      just a baby again. Inhaling fresh air and exhaling dirty air, his body
      became more and more transparent. The fresh scent of life now grew
      stronger, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      One circle had been completed. Han Sen opened his eyes. His black eyes
      looked around, and he was overwhelmed by a blissful, magical feeling. The
      pleasant-smelling aura of his body began to leave. He felt as if he was
      ready to fly and launch straight towards the heavens.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It really is a Qi Gong for Break Through the Vacuum, and yet it is
      just a beginner skill. I already feel as if I&#8217;ve been reborn. The
      cells in my body can freely breathe by themselves. No longer do I have to
      be afraid of running out of oxygen in deep waters.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s
      heart was overwhelmed with joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this power, he could finally hunt creatures under the sea without
      fear of drowning.
