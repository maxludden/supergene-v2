<p>“Dragon Thirteen of the Dragon,” the Dragon lady said in a
friendly manner.</p>
<p>“Dragon Thirteen? Nice name, but this test is not fair,” Han Sen
said, trying to buy himself some time.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen knew what Han Sen was doing, but she didn’t call
him out on it. She simply smiled and asked, “What is unfair?”</p>
<p>“If I lose, I have to lead you guys somewhere that I might die.
And if I win, I only get to live. That is what’s not fair,” Han Sen
said with an innocent expression.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen was not mad, and so she asked him kindly, “That
is not fair? Then what would you suggest is fair?”</p>
<p>“If I win, for my remaining time in Ancient God’s space, how
about you be my bodyguard?” Han Sen suggested, raising an eyebrow
at Dragon Thirteen.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen laughed and said, “That’s a good idea! I will be
at a disadvantage, but that is okay. I agree to these terms of
yours.”</p>
<p>“Then that is the deal,” Han Sen said seriously.</p>
<p>Yes.” Dragon Thirteen brought out a black, screw-shaped lance in
her hands.</p>
<p>The moment she grabbed the lance, Han Sen felt spooked. She gave
him a strange feeling. And Han Sen could not feel her inside his
Dongxuan Aura, so he was unable to determine her true strength.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen held the screw lance, but she did not strike.
She sounded confident when she said, “I am not Infinite Buddha. If
you wish to use Empty White Teeth to return my attacks, think
again.”</p>
<p>“Then what am I supposed to do?” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Han Sen just wanted to buy himself some time so he could rest a
little bit more. He did not actually expect Dragon Thirteen to
reply.</p>
<p>“The Evilbreaker Lance of the Dragon can break any skill thrown
against it. Your returning skill might work on other races, but it
won’t work on me. If you seek victory, use your own strength. I
hope you do,” Dragon Thirteen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Breaking all skills, you say? That is a bold claim to make,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen simply shrugged. “If you do not believe me, use
your Empty White Teeth and see if you are able to return my
attack.”</p>
<p>After that, Dragon Thirteen attacked Han Sen. The lance became a
line that was sharper than a needle.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not make an attempt. Power that had been
concentrated like that was not something he could’ve returned, even
if she had not used a skill.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s rabbit shoes unleashed a burst of speed as he dodged
Dragon Thirteen’s lance. His Blood Feather Knife was aimed for her
neck.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen squinted. Han Sen was just an Earl that was
under the Ancient God space’s hampering, and yet, he could be that
quick. She was surprised.</p>
<p>She was only a little surprised, though. Dragon Thirteen spun
her lance, and the lance temporarily disappeared. When it showed up
again, the tip was going to come into contact with Han Sen’s
throat.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and jumped to the sky. He dodged Dragon
Thirteen’s lance and used his Blood Feather Knife.</p>
<p>They kept swooping and flashing between the rocks. No one could
accurately trace their movements. They fought for a whole minute,
going by each other many times. The knife and lance did not touch
each other.</p>
<p>“What is this knifeskill? Teeth Knife should not look like
this.” The White Tiger Marquise was in shock.</p>
<p>“That is not Teeth Knife. That is Sky Palace’s Under the Sky.”
Sharon’s eyes looked sharp.</p>
<p>“Under the Sky? I have never heard of that before,” the White
Tiger Marquise said doubtfully.</p>
<p>Sharon looked at Han Sen and said, “Under the Sky was created a
long time ago by a Sky Palace elder. Due to there being many flaws
with it, they forbid the students from ever learning it. It seems
to me as if that flaw has been fixed, but who might have done that,
I do not know.”</p>
<p>“What is so special about this knifeskill?” White Tiger Marquise
asked.</p>
<p>“I do not know. I only know this knifeskill is modified and
derived from the Textless Book. Due to no one using this skill
before, no one really knows how strong it might be. But, people who
haven’t learned the Textless Book should not be able to learn it.
It is surprising Han Sen has learned Under the Sky, especially as
he is an outsider.” Sharon said.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the speed of the rabbit shoes to fight Dragon
Thirteen. Han Sen did not know if Evilbreaker Lance had the power
to break skills, but he knew that he didn’t have that kind of
strength himself. If he became a Marquise, he wagered he could give
it a try.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen was not as complex as Lone Bamboo. She
maintained simple lance techniques and a simple focus on power.
There wasn’t much variety. But even so, the simplicity of the
strikes was still very violent. She could use her power to drive
them to the max.</p>
<p>If Han Sen did not have the aid of the rabbit shoes’ speed, and
Dragon Thirteen was not mellowed by the force of the Ancient God
space’s power, then Han Sen would have already been hit.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen is powerful! She is a shining example of pure
bravery. Her lance conquers everything! Those of the same level
must avoid her carefully. I am not a Marquise, and I am weaker,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Frighteningly, Dragon Thirteen was becoming bolder for some
reason. Her speed and power were increasing, too.</p>
<p>The rabbit shoes started to fail in keeping up with her
speed.</p>
<p>“Han Sen was naive to think he could fight Dragon Thirteen. She
is the bravest of the Dragons for sure. No one at the same level
can fight her. And furthermore, Dragons get stronger the longer
they fight. The longer the fight lasts, the worse-off Han Sen will
end up,” the White Tiger Marquise said.</p>
<p>Sharon frowned and did not speak. He thought something was
wrong, but he couldn’t quite tell what it was.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly retreated to gain some distance. Dragon
Thirteen, clutching her lance, tried to catch up with him.</p>
<p>But her armor started cracking as if it was being hit by
something. It kept getting cut.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen stopped. She looked around and coldly said,
“When did you leave this knife air around us?”</p>
<p>“My first strike came while I was airborne. All this time, I
have generated countless knife airs. You can’t see them, but if you
keep hitting them, you know what will eventually happen, yes?” Han
Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Combining Under the Sky’s strikes with Moon’s gentility, Han Sen
had set up lots of knives in the air. They were like a mesh of
puppet wires all around Dragon Thirteen. They hung in the air,
strands of invisible knife silk.</p>
