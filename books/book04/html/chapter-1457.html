      Han Sen followed the woman to the spirit hall of the shelter, and she sat
      down on the throne there. Han Sen looked around him and saw that there
      were no other chairs. So, he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, Han Sen saw a number of powerful spirits enter the hall.
      Every spirit that walked in had a lifeforce equivalent to that of the red
      cricket. That meant the entrants of the hall were at least king-class in
      caliber.
    </p>
    <p>But they were all clad in grey cloaks, obscuring their faces.</p>
    <p>
      When the spirits arrived, all of them bowed before the woman. And
      politely, they all bid her, “Greetings, My Master.” Then they split up and
      stood at both ends of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, both sides of the hall were skirted with a large number of
      these spirits. There were twenty-to-thirty king class spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked seeing them, as they all appeared to be of the same
      visual distinction. Han Sen’s senses told him that their bodies and energy
      were all very similar. It could have been a family of spirits, for all he
      knew, like the Dark Spirit tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe she really isn’t human? Otherwise, how does she rule and preside
      over such a large and powerful family?” Han Sen thought this entire
      scenario was strange. But still, despite repeated readings of the woman,
      she still seemed human to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twenty-to-thirty king spirits all turned to look at Han Sen, then. It
      was obvious they thought his presence there was strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Han Sen had been in similar situations in the past. The king
      spirits were all very strong, but they didn’t scare him. He continued to
      stand where he was unfazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er looked around in curiosity. If Han Sen didn’t hold her tight, she’d
      squirm free and head for the spirit statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is everyone present?” the woman asked, scanning the lines of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Master, aside from Ghost Moon, all are present.” A spirit to her left
      politely informed her.
    </p>
    <p>“Why is Ghost Moon absent?” the woman asked with a frown.</p>
    <p>
      The spirit said, “You asked us to borrow something from Outer Sky. I sent
      Ghost Moon there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman nodded and responded, “Then there is no need to wait for her. I
      have something to announce. From now on, he is our Priest of Elysium
      Shelter.”
    </p>
    <p>When the woman said this, all the spirits around looked shocked.</p>
    <p>
      “Master, we can’t do that! The priest has always been chosen from within
      our tribe. How can you allow an outsider to accept such a distinguished
      role?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Master, I see a bronze light in him. He is a creature with a bronze geno
      core. How can he be our priest?”
    </p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>
      The entire spirit hall was kicked into a frenzy as the spirits all begged
      and pleaded for their mistress to recall her decree. They all went down on
      the floor, too, to underline their sincerity. Only Han Sen remained on his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen, and he didn’t even know what the role of priest would
      mean. And while it sounded like something of power and import, he wasn’t
      planning on sticking around this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, quite obviously, whether he became a priest or not wasn’t Han Sen’s
      call to make, so he decided to remain quiet and just watch. He was going
      to see how things unfolded first.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Master, Ghost Moon is a far better candidate than this creature. She is a
      much greater choice,” the spirit to her left said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is nothing for any of you to say. My mind on this matter is
      settled. Return at once.” The woman cared little for their pleading, and
      she gestured with her hand for them to leave her be.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, the spirits turned to leave. They looked awfully upset, but
      they did not dare disrespect the mistress they had pledged allegiance to.
      Their eyes swept across Han Sen in simmering anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the king spirits had all vacated the hall, and the door was shut, Han
      Sen bore a wry smile. “I’m just a human with a bronze geno core. I don’t
      think I can do much for you. Why not just select a strong one of them to
      be your priest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman coldly said, “I have my reasons for selecting you. Just play
      your part.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m afraid of being too weak to accomplish that which you desire of me.”
      Han Sen looked bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman suddenly smiled. She actually looked quite beautiful, and it
      stilled Han Sen’s heart instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, perhaps you need some motivation. If you do perform poorly, I will
      have your head.” The woman said this with that same smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t say I could do this. But you’re forcing me to commit to all
      this, and now you’re threatening to cut my head off if I fail. It’s not
      fair.” Han Sen tried to debate with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s not fair because I am stronger than you. That’s a good enough reason
      for you to do anything I tell you,” the woman said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine!” Han Sen said no more, and he was willing to accept his role as the
      priest, given the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least tell me what this role requires of me, first. If it’s for me to
      go out and kill super creatures, then I can’t help you there,” Han Sen
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman smiled, “We don’t need you to kill super creatures. The Priest
      of Elysium Shelter only has one task, and it should be easy.” The woman
      then turned to look at Bao’er on Han Sen’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>“And what would that be?” Han Sen did not want to talk.</p>
    <p>
      “It’s to teach and take care of Elysium’s holy child,” the woman said,
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Elysium’s child? Is that your son? How old is he?” Han Sen’s mind was hit
      with a barrage of questions he wanted answers for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked straight at him. “I just told you. It’s Elysium’s child.
      The spirits you saw were all children of the Elysium family. You must
      teach their latest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I’m not a teacher, and I’ve never taught anyone anything. And I most
      certainly haven’t taught spirits.” Han Sen didn’t think this was a good
      mission to be given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits did not want him to be the priest, and they already hated him.
      Even if they did accept him in the role, it wasn’t as if Han Sen wanted
      this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Again, I’ll cut your head off if you fail to be a decent teacher.” The
      woman reinstated her threat, and it was as effective as it had been the
      first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing Han Sen could say. He couldn’t decline. He simply
      followed the woman out of the hall until he was told to enter a building
      located in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will teach him in this garden. Remember what will happen if you
      fail,” the woman said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is he? Let me see him.” There was nothing else Han Sen could do, so
      he had to roll his sleeves up and get to teaching as well as he could, as
      soon as he could.
    </p>
    <p>“The holy child is here,” the woman said, looking across the garden.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked in the same direction. His eyes opened wide in disbelief as
      he said, “He is the holy child?”
