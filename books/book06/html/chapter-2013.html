<h2>Angia’s Plan</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2013</h3>
<figure><img src="../Images/gem.gif" alt="gem" id="gem" width="120"

<p>Angia and his companions had come to Sky Palace because they had
to. The rest of the Feather race was depending on them to make
friends with the Sky.</p>
<p>They wanted to quickly integrate with the population of Sky
Palace so they could be considered natural members. When they came
there, they brought a lot of treasures to hand out. Blood Feather
Knife was one of them.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t as simple as handing out gifts to the first Sky
they met. They weren’t entirely sure how the greedy elders of Sky
Palace would react when they made their treasures available. And if
the Feathers’ goods were simply taken from them, it would do little
to grow their relationship with the Sky.</p>
<p>Angia only made the offer to the crowd because Han Sen hadn’t
come to the knife event. When he put the Blood Feather Knife on
display, he had no plan to receive it back.</p>
<p>Of the Sky students attending the knife event, one of them was
the third elder’s son. He was an Earl called Wind Nineteen. The
third elder used knives, and so his son used knives, too.</p>
<p>The third elder was in charge of interacting with the Feathers,
so the Feathers planned to give the Blood Feather Knife to him.</p>
<p>If they simply handed it to the third elder, though, it might
not make much of an impression. He was an elder, and it was fair to
say he had no lack of King class weapons already. But if Wind
Nineteen could win the knife in this knife event, it’d make
everyone look good. When he received the knife as a prize, it would
be far more memorable.</p>
<p>Angia couldn’t just give the knife to Wind Nineteen, but if Wind
Nineteen believed he used his own strength to win the knife, then
the Feathers wouldn’t curry any favor. It had taken a little while
for the Feathers to devise a plan.</p>
<p>Angia had to win a few rounds before losing to him. That way,
Wind Nineteen would know that he was receiving a gift meant for
him.</p>
<p>“Angia, are you serious?” asked a strong man with a cow’s head,
his eyes wide.</p>
<p>Angia smiled and said, “Of course. If any of you can beat me,
then you can claim the Blood Feather Knife for yourself. That
includes you, Brother Cow.”</p>
<p>“Good! Then what are we waiting for? I am the best when it comes
to knives. How about we compare our knifeskills?” the cow-head man
said, standing up.</p>
<p>“Yes, please.” Angia smiled and gestured towards the arena.</p>
<p>The cow-head man was strong, and he was one of the outsider
students. He was good with knives and fairly well- known amongst
the other students. He was also known for being quite grumpy.</p>
<p>His name was Strong Cow. He was one of the students Angia hired
to use knives against him. That way, before Angia fought Wind
Nineteen, he could show-off his own powers.</p>
<p>Angia did not mind losing and giving out a gift, but he wanted
to become very famous in the process.</p>
<p>Everyone watched Angia and Strong Cow move to the arena, and
they observed the match.</p>
<p>Strong Cow was over three meters tall, and he was holding a
giant horse knife. It was even taller than he was. It looked very
scary.</p>
<p>“I am going to begin,” Strong Cow said simply, then slashed
towards Angia.</p>
<p>The giant horse knife was associated with the element of
thunder. The knife light was like lighting. It became a cowshaped
bolt when it came for Angia.</p>
<p>The thunder-cow roared as it approached, and this was a fine
display of Strong Cow’s greatest skill. It was very strong, and the
elites of the same level would not dare try to block such an
attack.</p>
<p>Everyone now looked at Angia, curious to see how he might
react.</p>
<p>Angia’s white wings were still folded on his back. He was
obviously not planning to evade. He was holding a common, Earl
class jade knife. It was made from Xuan Jade Spirits, so it was
nothing particularly special.</p>
<p>As the thunder cow’s knifelight flashed towards Angia, the power
looked as if it could break a mountain.</p>
<p>Angia smiled. He moved his jade knife and slashed towards Strong
Cow’s thunder cow knifelight. The jade knife was shining gold. It
was like a light from heaven.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The thunder cow knifelight was cut in half by Angia’s golden
light. The gold light did not stop, and it hit the horse knife and
broke it in half.</p>
<p>Strong Cow retreated. The gold light was a mere three inches in
front of him when it disappeared.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked by the display. They could immediately tell
that Angia had held back some of his power, too. If he had wanted
to, the gold light would have cut right through the cow’s face.</p>
<p>Strong Cow was not a very talented elite, but he was still
considered one of the strongest Earls. Thunder Cow Roar was
powerful, but Angia had just beaten it without issue. Clearly,
Angia was a top rank Earl.</p>
<p>The Feather’s Judgment Knife is special. It is a very strong
geno art, and it is said that it can cut through anything. I have
never seen it before today, though.” Thousand Feather Crane
explained what they had just seen to Yun Sushang.</p>
<p>“Brother Crane, do you think you can win?” Yun Sushang
frowned.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But I’m not good with knives, and that is what
they are comparing. So, it is pointless for me to participate.”
Thousand Feather Crane shook his head.</p>
<p>Strong Cow lost. The other students hesitated to try. Angia had
fought a few bouts before today, but he had never proven himself to
be that strong before.</p>
<p>A student who was good at Yin knifeskills wanted to try. He
didn’t lose in such a dramatic fashion as Strong Cow, but everyone
could tell he had been suppressed by Angia.</p>
<p>No one was able to beat him over the next few rounds of battle.
People started to look at Angia differently.</p>
<p>Not many people in Sky Palace used knives or practiced
knifeskills. The few fighters Angia had just defeated weren’t
really the best Earls. But even so, the fact that Angia kept
winning was more than enough to prove his power.</p>
<p>No one dared challenge him, and that included Wind Nineteen.</p>
<p>Angia knew that Wind Nineteen did not think he could win, so he
didn’t do anything about it. He simply went back to the stage and
said, “Sky Palace has been home to a high race since ancient times.
The genes and geno arts here greatly surpass those of the Feathers.
I have come here in the hopes of learning, and now I have. I am so
happy.”</p>
<p>“I have heard Han Sen and Wind Nineteen are the best Earls when
it comes to knifeskills. That being said, it seems that Brother Han
is either busy or is choosing to avoid me. That is very
disappointing. Fortunately, Brother Wind is here. Do you think you
could teach me?” Angia spoke quite politely, but everyone knew he
was just taking digs at Han Sen. He was suggesting Han Sen was too
scared to fight him.</p>
<p>Angia didn’t say it directly, but Yun Suyi thought this
reflected poorly on Han Sen. She felt angry, hearing him speak that
way.</p>
<p>“Han Sen didn’t come, but I have learned knifeskills from him! I
will fight on his behalf, and I will satisfy your desire by proxy.”
Yun Suyi, dressed in her white garb, marched straight down to the
arena.</p>
