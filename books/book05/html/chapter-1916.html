	<p>Without the plants, the red mist had smothered the entire cave. Fortunately, Han Sen had his Dongxuan Aura to
		help him see things clearly.</p>

	<p>After they entered the cave, the minks returned to where they were born. Then, they started digging with their
		little paws. They wanted to burrow through the stone. The little minks had just been born, however, and they
		were only Baron class. They were still very weak, so they could only leave small scratches across the rock.</p>

	<p>Han Sen commanded them to fly back inside his pocket. Then, he pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and activated his
		Jadeskin light. Then, he got to digging the ground in their stead.</p>

	<p>All seven of the minks popped their heads out of his pocket. Their fluffy heads all lined up to watch Han Sen dig
		through the stone.</p>

	<p>Han Sen, after a little while of digging, had created a pit that was two meters deep. Suddenly, there was a dong
		noise. He wasn’t sure what the knife had hit, but it sounded like it had struck metal. And furthermore, whatever
		it was did not sound broken.</p>

	<p>Han Sen examined the bottom of the pit and saw something of a grey and white color. Han Sen dug up the stones
		around it, and he realized it was a bone. Only one inch of the bone was showing, but it was obviously much
		larger than that. What the bone might have belonged to, he wasn’t sure.</p>

	<p>So, Han Sen swung his Ghost Teeth Knife and resumed digging. When he unearthed not one but multiple bones, he was
		given a shock.</p>

	<p>It appeared to be a complete skeleton that was more than four meters long. It was that of a creature with four
		legs. It looked like the skeleton of a Red Mist Mink.</p>

	<p>It was dead, of course. And there it was, with only the bones remaining. The Ghost Teeth Knife was incapable of
		breaking the bones, and only faint marks were left on them. You could tell that its level must have been quite
		high before its passing.</p>

	<p>Han Sen examined the bones for quite a long, but he found no source of xenogeneic genes. This was surprising.</p>

	<p>“Weird. Did someone kill this xenogeneic and take its xenogeneic materials?” Han Sen thought that was incorrect,
		though. If it had been killed, why would the bones show zero signs of damage?</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not know what to do, so he allowed the seven little minks to hop out of his pocket. Han Sen thought
		their purpose here was to check out these bones, but when they entered the pit Han Sen had dug, they went into a
		specific corner and kept on digging.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was not a patient fellow, and he had no interest in waiting for them to complete the task of digging. So,
		with Ghost Teeth Knife, he took over the spot they were digging. He dug out two feet of stone before he came
		across something else.</p>

	<p>A red mist started to ascend from it.</p>

	<p>Before Han Sen could see what it was, the seven little minks jumped inside. They all ran into the red mist and
		disappeared.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked closer, and there, he noticed an orb that was around the size of a grapefruit. It looked very
		clear, as if it had been made of crystal.</p>

	<p>But the red mist there made Han Sen believe it wasn’t real. And now the minks had vanished.</p>

	<p>Han Sen dug out the orb and took a look. He was given another shock.</p>

	<p>Inside the orb, amidst the mist, there was a red palace. It looked like a suitable habitation for a god.</p>

	<p>For some reason, the seven minks had gone inside the crystal orb. They appeared before the red palace, and then
		resumed trying to scratch their way in. They were trying to dig into the palace. There were no gaps in the
		walls, though. They were too weak, and they could not push open the doors to the place.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at the nameplate of the palace. There were three words on it, but Han Sen could not read them.
		They weren’t of a language belonging to the humans or the crystallizers, and neither were they from a language
		that existed in the geno universe.</p>

	<p>“How did they get inside there?” Han Sen was playing with the crystal orb, trying to activate it. Nothing he did
		seemed to work.</p>

	<p>If this was a treasure of some kind, it might require a very special element to activate it.</p>

	<p>“If those seven little minks could enter the orb, that must mean that their power is the same as the orb’s power.
		I can cast powers with my Dongxuan Aura. Perhaps I can simulate the lifeforce of the little mink and get it to
		work,” Han Sen thought.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was wondering how to get the seven minks out first, though. It was then that he realized the mist inside
		the cave was starting to fade. The spring was on the precipice of erupting.</p>

	<p>Han Sen quit his stalling, put the crystal orb in his pocket, and ran out of the cave.</p>

	<p>The valley’s mist was starting to fade. Something was sucking it all away.</p>

	<p>Han Sen followed the subsiding flow of the red mist until he reached a place where the red mist was going into
		the ground. There was a big hole there now, and the red mist was drifting down into it.</p>

	<p>The mist around him was getting thinner and thinner, and it was then that Han Sen heard the sound of fighting. It
		must have been the Viscounts, rushing into the valley.</p>

	<p>Nothing was coming out of the spring, though, so Han Sen stood there as if he was guarding it. He waited for a
		flow to begin.</p>

	<p>Not long after, Sword Know made it deep into the valley. The red mist in the valley was almost all gone, and that
		was when he saw Han Sen. He coldly laughed, “Han Sen, it is useless, even if you did come early. You still have
		to wait for the spring!”</p>

	<p>Many Viscounts were approaching behind Sword Know. Many xenogeneics were on their way, as well. They were all
		fighting hard.</p>

	<p>Han Sen couldn’t be bothered to talk to him, so he just sat down to wait.</p>

	<p>Sword Know was next to the eye of the spring. He found a decent spot, and he got to killing the xenogeneics
		around him. Whenever the xenogeneics came within ten meters, he’d kill them quick.</p>

	<p>“Earl!” Han Sen frowned. Sword Know had not used spirit power, but his swordlight power was better than that of a
		Viscount.</p>

	<p>Han Sen reviewed the documents and read that only Viscounts could come.</p>

	<p>“Why are you here if you are an Earl!” Han Sen shouted over to Sword Know.</p>

	<p>Sword Know hummed and said, “I was a Viscount when I came. Am I not allowed to level up?”</p>

	<p>After that, Sword Know looked at the other Viscounts sent by the other Kings. Then, he coldly laughed. “I’m not
		the only one who became an Earl here.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked around. He saw a few Viscounts that were stronger than what Viscounts should have been capable of.
		He also saw Moon Wheel King’s daughter Rebecca.</p>

	<p>“You guys have really worked hard for this,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>

	<p>“Stay away from me, in case I hurt you by mistake. You know I have only just leveled up to Earl, so I can’t
		really control my newfound powers all that well,” Sword Know said threateningly.</p>
