  The battleships and scary creatures were covering the sky and the daylight. It was like the whole of Space Garden was now covered in clouds.

“Where is Han Sen?” Amidst the many scary creatures, someone walked forward. It was Itchy. He looked down on Space Garden and boomed his voice like rolling thunder. The whole of Space Garden quaked in response.

Han Yufei stood in front of everyone else and spoke up to him. “Han Sen is not here in the garden. Just tell us what you wish to say to

him.”

Itchy cold replied, “My master has commanded me to come here. We are here to reclaim the geno hall bloodline.”

Han Yufei squinted her eyes and responded, “If you want the geno hall bloodline, go knock on the geno hall’s door. Why come out here to bother us in Space Garden?” “Do you not know Han Sen’s daughter, Han Bao’er, is not actually his daughter?” Itchy asked. “She has a bloodline connected to the geno hall. My master told me that because we are the same kind, if you hand over Han Bao’er, we will not do anything to damage the prosperity of Space Garden. You will be free to remain here in Space Garden.”

“And what if we don’t?” Han Yufei looked like she was smiling, but she wasn’t smiling.

“In this world, having another Space Garden will not be much,” Itchy said. “Having less of a Space Garden does not constitute less. Even if Space Garden is deleted, another faction will only replace it. We do not truly care for the existence of Space Garden.”

Tang Zhenliu was so angry that he wished to say something, but Han Yufei spoke first. “That is Han Sen’s child. She has nothing to do with us. If you want her, go ahead and take her, but what I utterly despise is seeing someone with the audacity to threaten me. Now that you have spoken your piece, I have decided not to give it to you. I would like to see how you fare in destroying Space Garden.”

“Not bad. If you truly have what it takes to destroy Space Garden, stop talking crap!” Tang Zhenliu followed with a shout.

“You must have a death wish.” Itchy coldly grunted. He no longer wished to speak. He waved his hand and had many ships and scary creatures begin a crazy assault on Space Garden.

A battleship opened its doors to release many Break World beasts from the holds of the ship. They were like wolves that had been starved for months and were now free to go wild on the sheep pen that was Space Garden.

Many Break World beasts were in Space Garden. There were a hundred of them.

Boom!

Space Garden had a bai sema that was created from a spell. It stopped the attack of the Break World beasts, but the bai sema was then attacked by all kinds of Break World beasts. It kept flickering. It looked like it was going to break any time. Get ready to fight!” Han Yufei coldly grunted. She looked toward the base.

The Break World beasts were very shocking to witness. Space Garden had the power to fight, but Space Garden itself could not take on a fight that would be this big. If people started to fight, the place would only fall apart. Aside from the elites, the ordinary people in Space Garden would undoubtedly die.

The Space Garden’s bai sema had been established by Mister White. Only Mister White knew if it would hold.

“Send for Lin Feng. You guys focus on the fight and do not worry about anything else,” Mister White said to Han Yufei. It made Han Yufei feel much calmer. “In that case, let’s fight!” Han Yufei made a command. Tang Zhenliu, who wanted to fight so badly, broke space. He pulled out a knife and went straight for the bai sema and attacked a Break World beast.

Before his knife could reach that Break World beast, a sky full of green feathers came down like a rain of arrows. Every green feather pierced through the bodies of the Break World beasts and killed them.

A hundred Break World beasts were swiftly eliminated. A quiet man wearing green feathers for clothing was sitting in space. It was Ning Yue.

“Nine Real, he is yours!” Itchy spoke to a Break World beast.

The Break World beast was like a white tiger. It was not big, but it was bigger than an ordinary tiger. It was resting atop a ship. It heard Itchy’s command and woke up from its slumber lazily. It looked at Ning Yue and returned to sleep.

Seeing the White Tiger not listen to his commands, Itchy was annoyed. There was nothing he could do about it. He spoke to a big black bird and said, “Fish Bird, go and kill him!”

The big black bird looked cold. It flapped its wings and flew from the ship. It was like a black bolt of lightning that could split the sky and the ground. It was going right for Ning Yue.

“You guys stop chilling. We should let them know the true power of the God Chaos Party.” When Itchy made a command, many battleships opened their doors. Many Break World beasts came pouring out. There had to have been at least a thousand of them.

Ning Yue’s body glowed with a green light. All of the green feathers were like sword lights, and they were flying. They looked as if they were going to kill the Break World beasts.

Before his light feathers flew out, many inky feathers fell from the sky. They turned his green feathers into shattered pieces. They crumbled and slowly fell.

Ning Yue saw the big black fish bird and frowned. He sensed that the fish bird possessed a scary power inside it.

Seeing Ning Yue stop and not be able to take out any more Break World beasts, Han Yufei and the others emerged from the bai sema. They went out there to fight the Break World beasts.

Suddenly, the sky and the ground became incredibly dark. The shockwaves from the fighting were everywhere. Although the fights were intense, no matter how scary the powers were or how powerful the shockwaves were, the bai sema shielding Space Garden did not break.

On the top floor of the base, Lin Feng saw Mister White standing in front of the chess game. He was confused and asked, “Mister White, why did you call me here?” “Come. Play a game of chess with me,” Mister White said as he pointed at the chessboard.

Lin Feng was shocked. He did not know what Mister White was meaning. After all, why would he favor playing chess at a time like that? But Lin Feng understood Mister White. He knew he was a man who took things seriously, so there had to be a reason why he was behaving this way. He sat down across from Mister White.

There were already chess pieces laid out across the chessboard. It was set up in a check. Lin Feng had a look around the board. The black chess pieces he had were in bad shape already.

“It is your turn.” Mister White laughed after putting down a chess piece.

Lin Feng nodded and picked up a chess piece. He followed the chessboard with his eyes. It was at that moment his face changed. The chessboard felt as if it had an incredible amount of power surging through it. Where he wanted to put the chess piece down had a power rise from the space. It made his hand and the chess piece bounced away. Lin Feng almost coughed up blood.

It seemed as if Mister White expected this to happen. He slowly said, “Slow down. Use your Super God Spirit body to feel the power of the chessboard. What you need to do is use your power to adjust the strength. Borrow the east and fill up the west. Do not fight against it.”

Lin Feng understood the chessboard was connected to the bai sema that was shielding Space Garden. Mister White wanted him to hold it.
