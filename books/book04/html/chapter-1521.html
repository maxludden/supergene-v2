    <p>
      They had been too busy killing the ant king, and they hadn’t paid
      attention to what else was going on. They heard a noise, and they finally
      noticed a dome-like cave ahead of them, and an old tree inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old tree possessed a lot of fruit, but they were certainly abnormal.
      They looked like bees, and they were around the same size as a man’s fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wings of the bee fruit were continuously flapping, generating the
      typical buzzing noise bees produced. They looked weird enough to make
      anyone feel itchy, seeing so many bees swarmed around the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t know what sort of tree it was, but after using his Dongxuan
      Aura, he could tell it was immensely powerful. Fortunately, the bees were
      just fruit. They were still attached to their harboring branches, so they
      couldn’t attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Han Sen and Wang Yuhang still marveling at their current luck,
      another noise suddenly sounded. One of the bee fruits twirled around and
      tried to strike Wang Yuhang by firing its stinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stinger was too fast, and Wang Yuhang failed to dodge it in time.
      Fortunately, Han Sen was quick enough to react and smack the projectile
      down onto the ground. But even after that, Han Sen’s hand began to feel
      incredibly numb. His face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wang Yuhang felt much relief, but now all the bees on the tree had propped
      their stingers up to take aim at him. Like rain, the stingers all fired
      needles at Wang Yuhang.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh no!” Wang Yuhang shouted. He was unable to dodge a single one, and now
      that they were all firing his way, he pictured himself ending up very
      swollen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how fast Han Sen could swing his sword, he wouldn’t be able to
      take down all the toxic needles, either. He summoned his Overbearing
      Shield to cover both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many toxic stingers struck the Overbearing Shield, battering it with the
      patter of a rainstorm. They were unable to break the defense, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gold word overbearing then began to glow atop the shield, ricocheting
      the force of the stingers back at the tree they had been fired from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought firing back might allow them to damage the bee fruit or
      perhaps even kill a few, giving Han Sen a chance to discover what they
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the toxic stingers were pinged back, at about halfway in their return
      flight, it was suddenly as if they possessed minds of their own. They
      turned around in mid-air and came back for Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the toxic stingers didn’t come straight for them this time. Their
      flightpath curved to go around the shield and get Han Sen and Wang Yuhang.
      They were like small daggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Overbearing Shield was strong, but it could only protect one side. It
      could not protect against stingers that came from a variety of directions.
      This turn of events wasn’t making Han Sen happy, so he picked up Wang
      Yuhang and decided to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the toxic stingers couldn’t fly very far. When Han Sen had
      run the distance of a mile, the stingers flew back and returned to the
      tails of the bee fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are those things? They can reattach their stingers?” Han Sen looked
      back at the bee tree, seeming surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A whole tree full of bees. That’s disgusting! Let’s run,” Wang Yuhang
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop. The old tree might be decent. The toxic stingers are quite strong
      and likely super in class, but perhaps the bee fruits are super creatures.
      If we kill them, that is a lot of Life Geno Essences for us to harvest.
      And we’re sure to get a beast soul with those odds,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No way. How can one tree possess so many super creatures? Are they that
      cheap now?” Wang Yuhang struggled to believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s worth giving it a shot. What if I’m right?” Han Sen didn’t want to
      leave, but he hadn’t yet thought of a way in which he might kill the bee
      fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their toxic stingers were too small, and they had a distant operational
      range. Furthermore, the Overbearing Shield would be incapable of blocking
      them all. Han Sen didn’t want to risk getting stung, so he paced back and
      forth for a while thinking. He still couldn’t come up with a firm
      solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If those bees are all super creatures, this’ll be hard. Perhaps we should
      go back and make a plan.” Wang Yuhang seemed to be afraid of bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked around and noticed there was only one path leading to the
      tree. If Han Sen had to retreat, it’d be difficult to make use of the
      exact same path again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine, let’s go back. We’ll return when we come up with a solution.” Han
      Sen then took Wang Yuhang back to Mask Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ling Mei’er, seeing them both return safely, was very happy. She thought
      Han Sen and Wang Yuhang might have been unable to survive the wrath of the
      ant king.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen retired to his room, he had the time to inspect the
      Bloodthirsty Ant beast soul.
    </p>
    <div class="tables">
      <table class="beast">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Super Bloodthirsty Ant King</td>
          <td>(Glyph)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- Super Beast Soul Bloodthirsty Ant King: Glyph-Type -->
    </div>
    <p>
      Han Sen already knew about the ant king’s beast soul type, so he summoned
      it out. The tattoo of a red ant king appeared on his body, and when it
      did, a strange heat surged into him. With this intense warmth, it soon
      began to feel as if his blood was boiling. His strength and speed had
      definitely increased.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen, feeling this power inside him, was quite pleased.</p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen used the God geno core, his power reached that of a super
      demigod. But that was only because he used the red light from the God geno
      core and the abilities granted by the butterfly wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s strength was still stuck at the tier of a gemstone-class
      creature, but the ant king glyph increased his power and speed. Now he
      really was very close to super.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not bad. This is actually pretty nice. I suppose it was worth my time and
      effort.” Han Sen was really fond of the ant king’s beast soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ant king was strong, but it didn’t help him with a plan for killing
      the Old Bee Tree. He couldn’t just run up to the tree and kill all the
      bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’d be great if I had a super armor. If I did, I could totally block the
      stingers and kill the bees. It’s a shame that pet armor can only be used
      on a pet. Unfortunately, I don’t have any strong pets. If Meowth went up
      to the old tree, it’s unlikely it’d be able to damage the Old Tree Fruit.
      I need to find a super pet,” Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a shame Han Sen had been unable to get one of those so far. Unless
      Little Angel evolved, his super pet armor would be useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Angel, come out soon.” Han Sen missed the time he had spent with
      Little Angel in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dad, I miss Littleflower. Shouldn’t we go and visit Little Brother?”
      Bao’er asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, let’s go and find Littleflower.” Han Sen took Bao’er to a
      teleporter to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was living with the Ji family, currently. When Han Sen came out on
      the other side of the teleporter, he raised his head. Someone was coming
      his way. When Han Sen saw the person, he realized it was Ji Qing.
