      As the ground collapsed and Han Sen found himself in free fall, he let go
      of the coin
    </p>
    <p>
      to plummet by itself. Then, he flew back up to the ground that was still
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited near the drop for a long time, but the coin did not seem to find
      ground. If it
    </p>
    <p>
      had, it would have exploded with a blast Han Sen was sure to feel. Han Sen
      poked
    </p>
    <p>
      his head over the sides of the hole that had formed, and it was only then
      that a scary
    </p>
    <p>power burst out of the ground like a geyser.</p>
    <p>
      The power sent Han Sen flying, around fifty meters away from the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both sides of the hole had been brought to ruin. The power unleashed by a
      Saving
    </p>
    <p>
      Money coin, dialed to the number one hundred, was far too terrifying for
      Han Sen to
    </p>
    <p>comprehend.</p>
    <p>
      Once he got back on his feet and patted himself down, Han Sen inched his
      way back
    </p>
    <p>
      to the drop to get a clearer look at the aftermath. But before he could do
      that, he
    </p>
    <p>could feel his super king spirit release a substance inside him.</p>
    <p>
      “Aha! Did it work? Am I finally generating a new geno core?” Han Sen
      stopped to
    </p>
    <p>take a look with sudden happiness.</p>
    <p>
      It was, and just like the formation of his other geno cores, a substance
      was released
    </p>
    <p>into his Sea of Soul.</p>
    <p>
      It gathered together in a spot and began to swirl, before hardening to
      present
    </p>
    <p>
      something solid and tangible. The black crystal, as it always did,
      released some
    </p>
    <p>
      liquid that joined the swirling fluids and partook in the creation
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black crystal wasn’t very big by this point. After having created the
      other geno
    </p>
    <p>
      cores, its size had been reduced by fifty percent. And now, with the
      release of more
    </p>
    <p>liquid, it was getting even smaller.</p>
    <p>
      But this time, Han Sen’s shock and awe was taken to a whole new level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black crystal was no longer a black crystal. It didn’t seem
      crytallized anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its color had been wholly robbed, and its shape had been warped. It became
      a faint,
    </p>
    <p>
      translucent item that seemed to possess a blurry halo in its interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the black coloration of the crystal, the light inside was free to
      shine out. It
    </p>
    <p>began to beam brighter than the sun.</p>
    <p>
      It was so bright, Han Sen was unable to see what might have truly resided
      within that
    </p>
    <p>light, but whatever it was, he could feel the power it possessed.</p>
    <p>
      Before Han Sen could investigate it any further, though, the geno creation
      process
    </p>
    <p>
      was complete. His super king spirit geno core had taken the form of a
      coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coin had the number one fixed on its front, and on the back was an
      image of
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen in his super king spirit form.</p>
    <p>Self Geno Core: Bronze Dollar</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not have time to check out the geno core in great detail,
      though. The
    </p>
    <p>
      volume of the halo’s brightness went up a few more notches, completely
      blinding
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the light was not harmful. And after a short period of
      believing himself to
    </p>
    <p>be blind, his vision began to return.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took another look at where the black crystal had been, and what he
      saw
    </p>
    <p>gave him another surprise.</p>
    <p>
      The black crystal was completely gone; it had been replaced by a black
      crystal armor
    </p>
    <p>
      set. It was a heavy armor, but it had been forged with a sleekness in
      mind. It would
    </p>
    <p>be tight-fitting and rather feminine, in many respects.</p>
    <p>
      There was also a weapon alongside the armor set. Placed firmly in the
      gauntlets,
    </p>
    <p>
      there was a black crystal greatsword. And on the back of the armor were
      black
    </p>
    <p>crystal wings.</p>
    <p>
      The black crystal armor was motionless; it was just there. He couldn’t see
      if there
    </p>
    <p>
      was a creature in it or not, but Han Sen could tell the energy it
      contained exceeded
    </p>
    <p>that of Night Empress.</p>
    <p>
      After trying to give it a scan, however, Han Sen noticed its energy
      reduce.
    </p>
    <p>After a bit more time elapsed, all its power had depleted.</p>
    <p>
      In Shadow Shelter, the Nine-Life Cat suddenly opened both of its eyes with
      a look of
    </p>
    <p>
      confusion. It arose from its slumber and took off running towards the
      valley Han Sen
    </p>
    <p>was in.</p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat saw Han Sen there, and with a brisk teleportation, it
      appeared where
    </p>
    <p>
      the ground had caved in. It called over to Han Sen, saying, “Weird. I just
      felt it.
    </p>
    <p>Where is it? Has it gone?”</p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat sniffed around the ruined pasture in search of something,
      but could
    </p>
    <p>find nothing.</p>
    <p>
      “Why are you here, kitty?” Han Sen opened his eyes near the drop and saw
      the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat did not respond to his question and merely went on to ask,
      “Did you
    </p>
    <p>see something?”</p>
    <p>“What? What did I see?” Han Sen asked, obviously confused.</p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat ignored Han Sen and began talking to itself, pondering
      something
    </p>
    <p>intently. “Am I mistaken? This thing shouldn’t be here.”</p>
    <p>
      “What thing? What are you mistaken about? Hello? Are you going to talk to
      me?”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen walked up to the Nine-Life Cat while asking.</p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat shook his tail, saying, “It’s none of your business! You
      still only have a
    </p>
    <p>
      bronze geno core. When are you going to become a god? You should really
      think
    </p>
    <p>about hurrying up.”</p>
    <p>
      “Does it matter to you whether or not I become a god? What interest do you
      have in
    </p>
    <p>my affairs?” Han Sen said.</p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat looked at Han Sen with a fairly serious look. He told him,
      “If you don’t
    </p>
    <p>become a god, how am I supposed to get back…?”</p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat then realized he had just said something he shouldn’t have.
    </p>
    <p>This prompted Han Sen to ask, “Back? Back where?”</p>
    <p>
      “It’s nothing.” Then, Nine-Life Cat started walking away, as if nothing
      had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you from the Fifth Sanctuary? Am I supposed to be your transport
      there?” Han
    </p>
    <p>Sen asked after it.</p>
    <p>
      Nine-Life Cat did not turn around. It continued to walk away, and as it
      went, it
    </p>
    <p>answered, “Getting to the Fifth Sanctuary isn’t easy.”</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to ask more questions, but all of a sudden, Nine-Life Cat
    </p>
    <p>disappeared.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head and disregarded the cat. Then, he returned his
      attention to
    </p>
    <p>
      the Sea of Soul. The armor set was still there, but it was dead and devoid
      of a
    </p>
    <p>lifeforce.</p>
    <p>
      He could not bring it out of the Sea of Soul for some strange reason, and
      all he could
    </p>
    <p>
      do was view it with mild curiosity. The armor set, for what it was worth,
      gave him the
    </p>
    <p>
      same feelings he received whenever he inspected the black crystal, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to go back now, but before he took off, he saw something
      flicker in
    </p>
    <p>the hole. It seemed as if something was down there.</p>
    <p>
      It was dark down in that pit, though. And the light appeared to be very
      deep within
    </p>
    <p>the hole, which made it hard for him to see what it might be.</p>
