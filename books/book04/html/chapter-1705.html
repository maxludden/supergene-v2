      When Han Sen first saw the Nine-Life Cat symbol on Zero, he thought it was
      just a sign associating her with Blood Legion in some way. Now that Han
      Sen was thinking about it, he realized the symbol was just like the tattoo
      on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zero could enter the sanctuaries without issue, unlike others who were
      subject to limitations and restrictions. She never had to go through a
      formal ascension process, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Han Sen was thinking that if Zero had a Nine-Life Cat symbol like his,
      the mystery was practically resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat had said that having Nine-Life Cat blood meant you could come and
      go in any sanctuary as you pleased. It was a fine explanation for why Zero
      was able to enter any of the sanctuaries, without ascending the proper
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Zero teleported to Han Sen whenever or wherever he ended up. That was
      something else that went against the pre- established system of the
      sanctuaries. That was similar to what had happened to Han Sen when he
      ended up next to Old Cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Zero’s tattoo was the same as his, that meant they shared a weird
      connection of some kind. They might have been one- and-the-same, and that
      was why Zero would always spawn next to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought this was very possible. He’d only ever had one brief look
      at her Nine-Life Cat tattoo, though, so he couldn’t quite remember the
      details. He didn’t know if it was exactly the same one that was on his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Zero, who was currently treating his wounds, he thought to himself,
      “She’s a grown woman. I can’t ask her to take her clothes off so I can
      inspect her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought about this conundrum for a while, but he couldn’t come up
      with an excuse that would permit him to get a look at her tattoos.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Zero, you haven’t bought any new clothes in a long time. How about we go
      and get you some later?” Han Sen looked at Zero’s clothes. He only had to
      make her wear something that revealed her back, and he would see the
      tattoo.
    </p>
    <p>“No, I have enough,” Zero said calmly.</p>
    <p>
      “But I need to. You are a beautiful girl and you need to dress up pretty.
      If you don’t, people will find out I’ve been cheap on you. I will handle
      this for you, okay?” Han Sen said that all at once, not giving her another
      chance to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zero did not say anything, either. Once she had dealt with Han Sen’s
      wounds, she left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was on the sofa browsing Skynet. He bought a few different
      garments for Zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought a number of different clothes to hide the ones he truly wanted
      her to wear<sub>the</sub> ones that would display her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, he wasn’t dumb enough to buy a lot of different clothing that
      all showed her back. That would be too obvious, and it’d be like he was
      making a statement. By buying a bunch of different styles, she’d be none
      the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, the clothes were delivered by a drone. Han Sen called Zero
      over and convinced her to try them on, one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Zero wore the clothes that revealed her back, Han Sen was
      delivered quite the surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zero’s appearance hadn’t changed much, but she had grown up a lot. She was
      a woman now. She looked very beautiful in the dress he got her, and Han
      Sen couldn’t stop admiring her looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zero walked around, with Han Sen staring keenly at her back. He also took
      a photo, for future investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he saw her back, he really could see that the Nine-Life Cat
      tattoo was the same as the one he had. It wasn’t just the shape that was a
      carbon copy, either; he could sense it was the same via its color and
      feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was right! If Zero’s back tattoo is the same as the Nine-Life Cat
      pendant, it explains everything. But why would Zero have it and the
      pendant? Blood Legion had two of those relics? Where did Zero come from?
      Is she a human or a shura? Or is she something else entirely?” After Han
      Sen discovered this, his mind found more questions than answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen believed Zero might be a human that had used a geno fluid at the
      shura grave. It was certainly a possibility, but the tattoo posed other
      problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen became a god, he had absorbed the Nine-Life Cat. When had
      Zero combined with the necklace? And how had she done it so soon when she
      wasn’t strong?
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear, what do you want for dinner tonight? Because you are injured, I
      will cook.” Ji Yanran pushed the door open and walked right in. She was
      shocked by the scene she was witnessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was lounging on the sofa, staring at a loosely clothed Zero. The
      dress she wore left her whole back on display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to give her an answer, but he immediately noticed a
      dangerous look take over her face. He quickly told her, “Zero bought a
      number of different pieces of clothing, and she wished to ask me which
      looked the best!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Zero, you bought these clothes?” Ji Yanran nibbled her lips and asked
      Zero directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen bought them. Told me to wear them.” Zero wasn’t a liar and her EQ
      was low. She wasn’t really sure what was going on, so she simply answered
      with honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran squinted her eyes and looked down at Han Sen with a look that
      was more frightening than hell’s most rotten demon. She slowly approached
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me explain! It isn’t what you think. This is all a misunderstanding!”
      Han Sen wished to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran walked in front of Han Sen and then smiled a smile that was
      creepier than the officer’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You love to watch girls change their clothes? I will show you how it’s
      done right when we go home.” The smile remained fixed on Ji Yanran’s face,
      and it gave Han Sen a horrible chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go to the mall and buy the most expensive garment. Then, you can
      dress yourself up in it and show me!” Han Sen quickly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shut up and get in here!” Ji Yanran grabbed Han Sen by the ear and pulled
      him into the next room. Many screams were heard after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      A while later, Han Sen managed to explain everything clearly. He
      desperately wanted to escape the wrath of her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner was done, Han Sen saw Stay Up Late up in the observation
      tower. He walked over and started to chat with him. “This matter concerns
      our lives. Is there something you need to tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late was more injured than Han Sen was. He was reclining on a sofa
      with a hot cup of tea. He stared up at the sky as he replied. “That was
      the Third Division Special Forces officer. He trained all its members,
      myself included.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late sounded okay, just a little cold. Still, it was a soothing
      voice to listen to. But what he said next shocked Han Sen.
