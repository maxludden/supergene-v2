<p>Night Wind obeyed the command and deployed his substance chains
to clear the rubble behind the screen. The three of them hauled
their junkie Duke along with them, moving around the screen and
proceeding forward.</p>
<p>Blood came from every orifice of the Duke’s body. He wasn’t dead
yet, but his prospects weren’t looking good. That was especially
true of his eyes; they had turned entirely red, and even the whites
of his eyes had been consumed by the new color.</p>
<p>Night Wind focused his attention on clearing the road ahead.
After he cleared the path for some distance in front of them, he
suddenly stopped. He looked at Miss Mirror and said, “Miss Mirror,
should we change the direction of our travel?”</p>
<p>“Why?” Miss Mirror asked Night Wind.</p>
<p>Han Sen was curious about this, too. He had no clue why Night
Wind had made this suggestion.</p>
<p>Night Wind sighed and said, “The third picture predicts that we
will reach a tree. But comparing the height of the figures to the
height of the tree in the picture, it suggests that the tree is
very large. It would be a hundred meters tall, at least. Moving a
tree like that out of our path could be difficult.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood Night Wind’s rationale now. The fourth
picture seemed to indicate that they’d encounter a tree, and that
tree couldn’t be moved. If they changed course ahead of time to
avoid the tree, though, the prediction would be incorrect. If they
avoided the tree successfully, that would suggest that it really
had been someone messing with them.</p>
<p>“Let’s switch directions, then.” Miss Mirror nodded.</p>
<p>With Miss Mirror’s approval, Night Wind changed direction and
resumed digging.</p>
<p>If someone was trying to trick them, it would be easy for that
person to guess their course since they were digging in the
direction that the power was drawing them. The source of that power
was their destination, after all. The mysterious trickster might
have seen them, known where they would go, and then carved the
pictures accordingly.</p>
<p>If someone was rattled by those pictures, they would probably
find some sense of security in following the road they had already
intended to travel. And if they encountered that tree, they would
be terrified. The trickster’s plans would come together rather
neatly in that case.</p>
<p>Night Wind made this suggestion to keep that from happening. If
the trickster tried to move the tree to intercept them, he was
bound to leave behind some evidence of what he had done. The
trickster’s plan would fail.</p>
<p>Night Wind moved quickly, digging at a very fast pace. After ten
minutes, they had followed Night Wind down a trench that was a few
hundred meters long.</p>
<p>But Night Wind suddenly came to a standstill. The rigidity in
his back made it obvious that he had frozen midstep, not just
stopped for a breather. He stood there, staring ahead as if he had
seen a ghost. He didn’t even lower his raised arms.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Han Sen followed Night Wind’s gaze. He saw that
Night Wind had cleared half of the rocks, and a small object was
now peeking out of the rubble.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw what it was, his face paled as well. A twig was
rising from the rocks, and several green leaves had sprouted from
it. It looked like it belonged to a willow tree.</p>
<p>“How?” Han Sen asked uncomfortably. He peered more closely at
the twigs and leaves, and they looked like the ones in the
picture.</p>
<p>Night Wind silently used his dark substance chains to remove all
the nearby rocks. More twigs appeared as the rubble was tossed
away. A few minutes later, a mass of twigs and branches was
showing—the whole tree had been unearthed.</p>
<p>It was exactly the same as it appeared in the picture. It was a
hundred meters tall, and it looked like a willow tree. The flexible
branches hung low, and the tree was covered with countless green
leaves.</p>
<p>The three of them stared glumly up at the tree. They had changed
course in a way that should have been unpredictable, but they had
found the tree anyway. It was way too weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen inspected the roots of the tree. It was nestled in a
flowerbed made of stone, and rich soil covered its roots.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look as if someone moved it here,” Miss Mirror said
while looking at the flower bed.</p>
<p>“Maybe there are many trees like this. If that is the case, then
we were bound to encounter at least one of them. This plaza is
probably walled with trees. We would have found one no matter where
we chose to dig,” Han Sen said after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>“Right,” Night Wind replied seriously, and he moved his
substance chains to dig elsewhere. He wanted to see if another tree
could be found in a different direction.</p>
<p>“Stop digging! There will not be another one of these trees.”
Miss Mirror waved her hands to stop him.</p>
<p>Night Wind wasn’t going to question Miss Mirror, but he did look
at her with confusion. He was waiting for her to explain that
declaration.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror looked at the tree and said, “I think this is a
requiem tree.”</p>
<p>“A requiem tree!” When Night Wind heard that, he paled slightly.
He looked at the tree with an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Miss Mirror and Night Wind with confusion. He
had never heard of a “requiem tree” before.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror knew what Han Sen was wondering, and before he had a
chance to ask, she explained, “When I visited the Ancient God, I
saw a requiem tree once. The Ancient God say that these requiem
trees are where their people go for their final slumber. The
legends say that the Ancient God need to be buried next to them so
that their souls can find eternal rest.”</p>
<p>“If you’ve seen a tree like this amongst the Ancient God, and
now there is another one here, it doesn’t sound like these things
are terribly rare. Why would you say that there won’t be another
one of these trees around here somewhere?” Han Sen asked, his brow
furrowed. He was obviously missing something.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how many requiem trees there are in the universe,
but the one I saw before was only two feet tall,” Miss Mirror said.
“The master of that requiem tree said they only grow to a height of
about three feet, anyway. Then, they stop growing. If an Ancient
God dies and is buried beneath the requiem tree, it will absorb the
Ancient God’s body. The tree will then grow one more foot, no more
and no less. Do the math. If this tree has grown so high, how many
Ancient God bodies were here? Do you think there will be multiple
trees that have reached this height?”</p>
<p>“This is really a requiem tree?” Han Sen stared up at the tree,
suddenly seeing its prodigious height in a whole new light.</p>
<p>Ancient Water God’s body had moisturized a few systems, bringing
life to many planets and even making primitive races level up.</p>
<p>If Miss Mirror was speaking the truth, then that requiem tree
must have absorbed a few hundred Ancient God bodies, at the least.
It must have taken in an unbelievable amount of energy. It was hard
to imagine how strong the tree must be. But Han Sen couldn’t feel
the appalling lifeforce that should have been radiating from the
tree. To him, it was little more than an ordinary plant.</p>
<p>“It is easy to determine whether or not it is a genuine requiem
tree. If it is a requiem tree, the tree will have a requiem tree
hole that holds Ancient God powers.” Miss Mirror walked around the
tree, and it wasn’t long before she came to a stop. She stared at
one specific location on the trunk.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Night Wind walked over to Miss Mirror. They followed
Miss Mirror’s gaze and found her looking at a tree hole that was
the size of a man’s fist. The interior of the hole was jet black,
and Han Sen’s eyesight wasn’t good enough to pierce the gloom and
see if anything was inside.</p>
<p>“That is it! This is a requiem tree hole. I can’t tell if a
requiem tree egg is there, though,” Miss Mirror murmured to herself
as she looked at the tree hole.</p>
