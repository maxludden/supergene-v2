<p>Li Keer and Han Sen reached the valley right before the silkworm
fights were going to begin. When Exquisite saw them both heading
toward her, she sighed in relief.</p>
<p>She expected Han Sen to lose at least one of his fights, but if
he didn’t participate in the contest at all, the Very High would
hate him even more.</p>
<p>The time of rest was over. When the eleven silkworms entered the
valley, Exquisite didn’t ask anything of Han Sen. She allowed him
to proceed into the basin of combat.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen set foot in the valley, the entire valley was
sealed by a huge barrier. The bai sema would keep the destructive
power of the combatants contained within the valley, but it
wouldn’t stop teleportation or the bodies of the contestants. If
the silkworms teleported outside the seal, they would immediately
lose the fight.</p>
<p>When the silkworm fights began, few Very High had come to watch
the fights. Only the masters of the twelve silkworms actually
showed up in person.</p>
<p>The Very High that practiced the Very High Sense had zero
interest in such a contest, and the other members of their society
had other means of spectating. There was no need for them to go all
the way to the valley.</p>
<p>Only the masters of the silkworms had to watch the fights unfold
up-close. They needed that proximity to gain the battle experience
and knowledge of those they were watching.</p>
<p>“It finally begins. Now, if the other eleven silkworms meet Han
Sen, they will do their best to fight him.” As Li Xue Cheng watched
the stream of the fight preparations, he cackled wildly.</p>
<p>“Of course. We made Han Sen, who is only a ninth-tier King, into
a powerful contender who is only second to Shale. The half-deified
silkworms won’t be happy about this. Even if we were nice people,
this still would have put them in a competitive mood, right?” Liyu
Zhen squinted his eyes.</p>
<p>“Han Sen might drop out before he even gets to Shale,” Li Xue
Cheng agreed and nodded.</p>
<p>After Han Sen entered the valley, he wasn’t in a rush to bump
into another silkworm. He flew around a nearby mountain that rolled
up and down. The valley was as big as a planet, but for
half-deifieds or deifieds, that sort of area wasn’t too big. It
wouldn’t be difficult for the silkworms to locate each other.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen felt an impressive surge of power up ahead.
Someone was already fighting.</p>
<p>“This power… Is that Yu Shanxin?” As soon as Han Sen felt that
power, he noticed how familiar it felt. And so, he quickly headed
toward where that fight was taking place.</p>
<p>The area of combat wasn’t too far away from him, and so Han Sen
quickly reached the outskirts of their battlefield. There, he found
Yu Shanxin and a half-deified of the Extreme King standing on a
mountain. They were watching each other. They were both utterly
still. The only movement Han Sen could see came from their powers,
which were spilling out and shaking the mountains all around
them.</p>
<p>Han Sen recognized Yu Shanxin’s opponent. According to the
information he had received, the Extreme King fellow was called
Gru. Although he wasn’t of the same bloodline as King Bai, his king
body was very strong, certainly no weaker than any of the royal
children’s. He had a nine armor talent, and he was a very
experienced fighter. He was quite a skilled swordsman, as well.</p>
<p>At the moment, Gru was really quiet. And he was holding a steel
greatsword. His body was fizzing with a powerful swordmind, and
before his weapon even moved, his swordmind came for Yu Shanxin. It
rushed forward so fast that it pushed aside the clouds in its
path.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. Gru’s swordmind was no weaker than his own. The
man had reached deified class with it, for sure. He might have only
been half-deified, but his swordmind was remarkably developed. Gru
was definitely a very powerful half-deified. It was no wonder the
Very High had selected him as a silkworm.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin’s presence was harder to anticipate. Sometimes it
raged like fire, and other times it was soft like water. It made it
very difficult for those watching to determine what sort of power
he had.</p>
<p>“It is fortunate I’m getting to watch this fight. It means I can
observe Yu Shanxin and see what Extreme Evil Path can do.” Han Sen
maintained a careful distance from the battlefield so he could
observe without getting caught up in the fight.</p>
<p>“Yu Shanxin, I have heard you being called the strongest
non-deified in the universe. I, Gru, am going to see what is so
special about your Extreme Evil Path.” Gru looked at Yu Shanxin
coldly as he spoke.</p>
<p>Gru didn’t like Yu Shanxin for one simple reason; the Extreme
King were supposed to be one of the top three races of the
universe, but they didn’t have any half-deifieds that were as
strong as Yu Shanxin from Sky Palace. Now, the silkworm bouts had
given him a chance to fight Yu Shanxin. In truth, he wanted to take
this opportunity to kill Yu Shanxin.</p>
<p>“People who say such things are too kind. I assure you that
those comments are not true. Compared to the illustrious Extreme
King, I’m nothing noteworthy.” Yu Shanxin smiled coldly.</p>
<p>“Huh. Let’s fight and see.” Gru didn’t plan on letting Yu
Shanxin go that easily. His swordmind rose as he gripped his steel
greatsword, and a swordlight spread across the sky as it headed for
Yu Shanxin.</p>
<p>The silkworm fights didn’t permit the use of treasures, so the
steel greatsword must have been Gru’s gene weapon. As the sword
moved through the air, even Han Sen was surprised by its power. The
Extreme King’s sword skills and swordmind were no worse than his
own.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t think a strike like this would be enough to
defeat Yu Shanxin. He stared at Yu Shanxin, wanting to see how he
might deal with such an attack.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin’s body remained motionless. When the swordlight came
down, Yu Shanxin reached out both hands as if he wanted to catch
the swordlight.</p>
<p>The swordlight stopped when it encountered Yu Shanxin’s hands,
but the power of the strike was too great. While Yu Shanxin’s hands
had succeeded in stopping the attack, the raw force of the blow
still knocked his body back.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin was pushed back through the barrier of the valley. He
lost the silkworm fight.</p>
<p>The silkworm bout had few rules, but there was one rule that all
the contestants knew: whoever left the valley first would be put in
last place. Yu Shanxin had been the first to get knocked out of the
valley, and so he was going to be number twelve.</p>
<p>Han Sen was befuddled. “What the hell is wrong with Yu Shanxin?
Gru is very strong, but there is no way Yu Shanxin is that much
weaker than him. How did he get blown away by that attack? He must
have done that deliberately. I cannot believe this. Even if he
couldn’t have reached first place, there were many rewards that he
could have earned by reaching the top five. Why would he just throw
everything away and give up?”</p>
<p>Gru didn’t believe Yu Shanxin was that weak, either. The man had
been launched beyond the seal by a single attack.</p>
<p>But Yu Shanxin was already out of the valley, and Gru could no
longer chase after him. So, the Extreme King turned his head to
look at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“If Yu Shanxin was too much of a chicken to fight me properly,
then you can fight me. You’re also from Sky Palace, after all; it
will be good to test the mettle of your people.” Gru looked at Han
Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t expected the situation to change so quickly.
Before he even realized what had happened, he had become Gru’s
opponent.</p>
<p>But Han Sen made no effort to run away. He could still fall back
as long as he didn’t leave the valley, but Han Sen remained within
range of Gru. He drew Spell’s two pistols.</p>
