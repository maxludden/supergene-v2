	<p>&#8220;Can I go with you to the Real Old System?&#8221; Han Sen asked. &#8220;I want to help out the Extreme King
		too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If you want to go, you need to ask Second Uncle,&#8221; Bao Ying said. &#8220;He is in charge this
		time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;OK. Take me to see Second Uncle.&#8221; Han Sen did not know if he would actually be allowed to leave the
		Extreme King, but he wanted to use this opportunity to test the boundaries and length of Bai King&#8217;s leash
		on him. In addition to that, he wanted to know who was pretending to be him. He had killed an Extreme King
		deified.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had wanted to do that a long time ago, but he had never received the chance.</p>

	<p>Bao Ying did not deny Han Sen&#8217;s request. She took Han Sen to see Second Uncle.</p>

	<p>Second Uncle did not decline Han Sen&#8217;s request to join them. He just said he needed Bai King&#8217;s
		blessing to make the decision and ensure he was allowed to go with them. So, he had Han Sen wait for the news.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not think Bai King would let him leave. Surprisingly, not long after, Second Uncle returned with Bao
		Ying to notify Han Sen that he should go and get himself ready. They were all going to the Real Old System that
		night.</p>

	<p>Han Sen really did not understand what Bai King was thinking. Bai King is willing to let me leave the Extreme
		King! What if I leave and never come back? He would lose everything.</p>

	<p>If Bai King was willing to let him out, Han Sen did not mind being given the chance to go and see someplace new.
		That same night, he followed Bao Ying to the gathering where the others had assembled.</p>

	<p>Out of the people who were going, Second Uncle was the strongest. Han Sen only knew that Second Uncle&#8217;s
		power was almighty. He wagered that he might have been a butterfly elite, but that was just a rumor.</p>

	<p>Han Sen&#8217;s power had yet to recover, so he could not make an accurate judgment.</p>

	<p>There was also Bao Ying, Bao Qin, Meng Lie, and another four outsider deifieds among them. This time, the Extreme
		King was sending out a task force comprised of eight deified elites. It looked like they meant business, and
		they really wanted to take Han Sen.</p>

	<p>The deified would never have thought that the Han Sen they were venturing out to kill was already secretly among
		them.</p>

	<p>On the way, Second Uncle and the others made no effort to watch Han Sen or keep him on a leash. Han Sen was
		certain that if he decided to leave, escaping would not be difficult.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought, This asshole Holy Pirate is not trustable. He said he would steal me back, but I haven&#8217;t
		seen him make one move to help me. Fortunately, I did not depend on his rescue.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the others traveled to the Real Old System. Once they were there, they realized the place was in a
		proper mess. The xenogeneic space&#8217;s door had been blown open. Inside, there were signs of a battle. Many
		of the planets were affected. That fight had to have been a nasty one.</p>

	<p>The entirety of the Real Old System was destroyed. Many of the outsiders who reached that place were coming for
		Han Sen, but none of them were able to find him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen, Second Uncle, and the others were a bit late to the party. Many of the places there were destroyed.
		Fortunately, there were still members of the Extreme King around. They were stationed there to protect the more
		important places.</p>

	<p>Second Uncle and the others were there now, but the biggest problem they faced was not how to defeat Han Sen. It
		was how they were going to find Han Sen.</p>

	<p>The Extreme King team Second Uncle had brought were good with that task. They had their own tracking methods. Han
		Sen and the group that he had come to the battleground with were shocked when they saw what remained.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Under the Sky Knife skills? How is that possible?&#8221; Han Sen looked at all the knife marks across the
		planet and felt strange. Without a shadow of a doubt, he was able to tell they were Under the Sky Knife strikes.
	</p>

	<p>And, they were not Under the Sky Knife skills from Sky Palace. They were the Under the Sky Knife skills Han Sen
		had personally modified.</p>

	<p>It is no wonder everyone believes it was the real Han Sen. If I was not Han Sen, I would believe it too. Who is
		this impersonator that can replicate my Under the Sky Knife? Han Sen was shocked.</p>

	<p>Second Uncle and the others learned that it was Under the Sky Knife as well. They knew for sure it was a
		trademark of the real Han Sen, so they didn&#8217;t believe it was a fake Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen&#8217;s Under the Sky Knife was very unique in the universe. Even Sky Palace, which had the original
		Under the Sky Knife, was unable to copy the Under the Sky Knife Han Sen used.</p>

	<p>Second Uncle looked at a deified elite and asked, &#8220;Ger, have you found anything?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Ger had Shadow Eye powers. Although he was unable to see into the future or past, he could piece together what
		might have happened through the atmosphere. He had the ability to rebuild and replicate the image of what had
		transpired. It was sort of similar to what the Purple-Eye Butterfly could do.</p>

	<p>Ger&#8217;s eyes kept flashing and cycling through different images. He quickly started moving his body in a
		certain direction.</p>

	<p>Second Uncle and the others followed. Everyone was following him, which led to them leaving the Real Old System.
	</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are we leaving already?&#8221; Bao Qin asked with a frown. &#8220;That means our pursuit and capture of
		the fiend will be much harder.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How dare he kill my Extreme King and destroy my xenogeneic space,&#8221; Second Uncle coldly said.
		&#8220;Even if I must chase him to the ends of the universe, I will kill him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe he did not go far,&#8221; Ger suddenly said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Meng Lie asked.</p>

	<p>Meng Lie had been frozen by the medusa shield on his last encounter with Han Sen. It had cost the Extreme King a
		lot to restore his health. He had been resting in King&#8217;s Kingdom for most of the time since. This was the
		first time he had ventured outbound.</p>

	<p>Ger said, &#8220;Han Sen left very slowly. It isn&#8217;t as if he left in a rush. From the video I see inside
		me, unless he made use of Galaxy Teleportation, I do not think he went very far from here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think he learned Galaxy Teleportation from the Extreme King, but Galaxy Teleportation cannot be learned
		in any short period of time,&#8221; Second Uncle quietly said. &#8220;He could not perform a big act of Galaxy
		Teleportation.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It does not matter what we say now. Let us just continue the pursuit.&#8221; Meng Lie&#8217;s eyes
		flashed. Last time, he had been trapped by Han Sen in space. That had made him very upset. This time, he joined
		without an invitation to fight Han Sen and exact his revenge.</p>

	<p>Ger agreed. He continued leading the way forward for everyone. The entire group traveled through space, leaving
		Old Real System behind them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hang on.&#8221; Second Uncle&#8217;s face changed. He stopped Ger, who was ahead of them leading the
		group.</p>

	<p>Everyone looked at Second Uncle, who looked at Ger and asked, &#8220;Ger, are you sure Han Sen fled this
		way?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Although it was only for just a second, I assumed this was the way he went,&#8221; Ger said after thinking
		for a moment.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is weird,&#8221; Second Uncle quietly said. &#8220;If I am noticing it correctly, that place leads to
		the big barren systems.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Second Brother, did you remember it wrong? This place is so far away from the big barren systems.&#8221;
		Meng Lie looked at Second Uncle with confusion as he spoke.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is correct. When you go forward, you reach the systems of chaos. There are many bug holes and zones
		of twisted space that many battleships can often fall into by mistake. Going into one can have you end up in the
		big barren systems. If we keep going, we might end up entering the zone of the systems of chaos that is known as
		the Lost Land.&#8221; Second Uncle&#8217;s words were spoken with the utmost seriousness.</p>

	<p>Meng Lie looked at Ger and asked, &#8220;Ger, are you sure Han Sen went this way?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Ger used his power to look and reconfirm it. He nodded and said, &#8220;Right now, it seems to be the way. He
		went that way, but I do not know if he entered the Lost Land. We need to go there first.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;OK. We will go to Lost Land and make plans.&#8221; Second Uncle momentarily thought about it before asking
		Ger to keep leading the way.</p>
