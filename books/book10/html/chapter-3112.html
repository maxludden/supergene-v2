<p>King Jing Zhen’s office desk was stacked with letters from the
officers. Even if he did not open them, he was aware that the
content included more bad-mouthing of the prince and requests to
take a deeper look into the case involving Steel Scene’s death. He
knew the content would be very intense.</p>
<p>It was like if he did not kill Han Sen, he would be a bad king.
It was like they were saying if Han Sen was not dead, he would
become a tyrannical villain governing the government.</p>
<p>“My King, Mister Crown Prince is not coming to the palace,” a
eunuch reported.</p>
<p>King Jing Zhen looked surprised. He knew what his son’s
personality was like. No matter how headstrong he was, he still
listened to his father. Qin Bai always listened to his
commands.</p>
<p>This time, Qin Bai had rejected his summons. This was something
that had never happened before.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince said…” The eunuch behaved quite
awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Just tell it to me straight,” King Jing Zhen said.</p>
<p>The eunuch said, “The crown prince said if he cannot maintain
his friend’s innocence, there is no point in him being a crown
prince. He said he would prefer not to be one.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” King Jing Zhen shouted. In his heart, he had a
growing interest in the enigmatic Han Sen.</p>
<p>He understood Qin Bai. He was just a kid who was never able to
think for himself. His heart did not have any boundaries. Since
there were no boundaries, it meant he didn’t have a bottom line. He
sometimes acted stubbornly. If it involved something that made him
feel as if he was dealing with something much bigger than himself,
he knew when to retreat.</p>
<p>This time, Qin Bai had disobeyed him over Han Sen and said some
very bold words. That was something extraordinarily rare. He did
not usually act that way.</p>
<p>King Jing Zhen thought for a moment and said, “Go and find Grand
Teacher Thousand Mile Reach. Have him come here and bring back my
son.”</p>
<p>sand Mile Pohore scared of c. Speaking of</p>
<p>Grand Teacher Thousand Mile Reach had taught Qin Bai since he
was a child. Speaking of fear, Qin Bai was more scared of Grand
Teacher Thousand Mile Reach than Jing Zhen. This small matter
didn’t actually require Thousand Mile Reach. King Jing Zhen just
wanted to see how far Qin Bai was willing to go. That was why he
was going to ask Thousand Mile Reach to visit Qin Bai.</p>
<p>The case regarding Steel Scene was too big. Even King Jing Zhen
was not able to sweep it under the rug. So, he was not going to
allow Qin Bai to have his way.</p>
<p>Before the eunuch walked out, he asked this with hesitation,
“Mister, what if Thousand Mile Reach teacher cannot bring back the
crown prince?”</p>
<p>“If that happens, we will summon Han Sen here,” King Jing Zhen
said with a smile.</p>
<p>He actually hoped that would happen. Having standards was a sign
of someone growing up. That meant, in his heart, he had already
established his own rules. Even if the rules were wrong, it still
meant his son was growing up.</p>
<p>Jing Zhen knew Qin Bai did not know what boundaries and rules
were. At least, in front of Thousand Mile Reach, what Qin Bai stood
for might not be so stubbornly upheld.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach was a very serious grand teacher who was
very noble.</p>
<p>King Jing Zhen requested him to be a teacher for Qin Bai, but
Qin Bai was naughty and a bit of a simpleton. Not even the best
teacher had the skills to make him a better person.</p>
<p>Qin Bai was always hit by Thousand Mile Reach. It had happened
since he was a child. God knew how many times Thousand Mile Reach
had smacked him. One time Qin Bai made a big mistake. Thousand Mile
Reach struck him 30 times with a ruler. Qin Bai’s hands were so
swollen that he could not even eat.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was playing chess, Qin Bai and saw Thousand Mile
Reach come in. He was so shocked that he jumped.</p>
<p>“Grand Teacher… Why are you here?” Qin Bai quickly stood up. His
body was a bit stiff as he bowed before Thousand Mile Reach. His
face twitched. He lowered his head, not daring to look at Thousand
Mile Reach. He was like a schoolchild who had done something
wrong.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach looked at Han Sen. His personality was very
serious. After hearing about it, he didn’t like what Han Sen had
done.</p>
<p>He saw Han Sen just sitting there as if he did not care about
anything. He thought even less of him.</p>
<p>Although Thousand Mile Reach did not like Han Sen, he did not
say anything to him about it. He was not one of the king’s guards,
and he was not there to observe. He did not capture anyone. He was
only there for Qin Bai.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, you have skipped your homework for two
days. To be successful, you must work harder. Do not just spend
your time playing around. To be successful, you must put in the
effort. You will not be successful if you keep on messing around.
You will one day become the king of the Qin Kingdom. That is not
something you should throw away, and you should not be this
ridiculous. Why don’t you just come back with me?” Thousand Mile
Reach grabbed Qin Bai’s hand, ready to depart the Feng family’s
castle.</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked stiff. He looked at Han Sen as if he was asking
for help. He did not want to leave, but he was scared of Thousand
Mile Reach. He could not fight back.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled at Qin Bai. He did not try to stop his
departure.</p>
<p>It would have been great if Qin Bai could stay, but if he was
taken, that was fine by him.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen asked for Qin Bai’s help, he did not put
everything on Qin Bai. He was a spoiled and stupid child. Han Sen
had other things planned. It didn’t matter to him if Qin Bai was
taken.</p>
<p>Qin Bai was pulled away by Thousand Mile Reach. He kept looking
back at Han Sen. He wanted Han Sen to say something, but Han Sen
did not say anything. He only smiled at him.</p>
<p>For some reason, Qin Bai saw Han Sen smile and felt
uncomfortable. He did not know where the courage came from, but he
stood there and refused to leave.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach Pulled Qin Bai very slightly. Qin Bai
stopped. Thousand Mile Reach also stopped. He looked at Qin Bai and
asked, “Mister Crown Prince, what is it?”</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach looked and Qin Bai, who had lowered his
head. His face looked green and then white. He gnashed his teeth
and said, “Teacher, I promised Han Sen I would stay with him. You
always taught me that men need to keep their promises and only bad
people break them. What a king says is very important. I do not
want to be the bad guy who never keeps his promises.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s words were not spoken with confidence. He lowered his
head and did not even look at Thousand Mile Reach, but his teacher
looked surprised. Qin Bai had always been afraid of him. Now, he
had mustered the courage to say that to him. This was something
that had never happened before.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach saw Qin Bai was scared, but he did not want
to leave. He looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>He could not force Qin Bai to leave. If he needed to use force,
the king would not have asked him there.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach nodded and let go of Qin Bai. He walked over
to Han Sen, who was still at the chess table. He knew that Qin Bai
alone would not have mustered such courage. Whoever gave him the
courage had to have been the other young man. If he was able to
persuade Han Sen, Qin Bai’s courage would vanish. Then, he could be
taken away.</p>
