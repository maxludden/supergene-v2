<h2>Gene Race in the Mountain</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3051</h3>

<p>Ou Yang Qiu Shan looked at the mountain. Suddenly, his body
burst with a green light. His shadow was like a weird snake that
departed his body.</p>
<p>In the next second, Han Sen and the others noticed Ou Yang Qiu
Shan’s eyes were like those of a snake. They were green and white.
There were no pupils or white visible. His body had green snake
scales, and his back had strange scale wings. His entire body
looked like a monster. He had combined with a gene race.</p>
<p>Before anyone else could react, Ou Yang Qiu Shan reached out his
hand and waved at the mountain that had sounded with a roaring of a
beast. An invisible wind blade went into the woods. The tree
branches, which were a few hundred feet away, were cut down. Then,
a very bad scream was heard. After that, everything returned to
normal.</p>
<p>“It is done,” Ou Yang Qiu Shan coldly said.</p>
<p>After seeing this, Peaceful frowned. Mister Yang shockingly
looked at Ou Yang Qiu Shan and asked, “Is Mister Qui Shan’s gene
race the legendary wind-winged snake?”</p>
<p>Ou Yang Qiu Shan had a cocky expression. He looked at Mister
Yang with respect and said, “It is no wonder you are a Mister. Your
knowledge is very wide. It is the Ou Yang family’s wind-winged
snake.”</p>
<p>One of the people there did not know what the wind-winged snake
was. He looked at Mister Yang and asked, “Mister Yang, what level
is the wind-winged snake gene race? Is it powerful? What is it like
compared to the king class storm tiger?”</p>
<p>Ou Yang Qiu Shan heard this and looked disdained, but he was not
planning to explain.</p>
<p>Mister Yang said, “The king class storm tiger is powerful, but
it is different from the wind-winged snake. In legends, while the
last generation of the Ou Yang family was looking for land pulses
on Big God Mountain, they suddenly saw a storm boil from afar.
Across the mountain, their daytime travel turned to one of night.
Then, an evil green wind, which was like an evil dragon tornado,
wrecked the valley. It broke down trees that would require many
people to tear down. It pulled their roots out of the ground and
tossed them into the sky. It was very strange. The scary and evil
wind did not leave half an inch out of that valley. The master of
Ou Yang thought there was something weird in that valley, so he
waited outside the valley for half a month. He waited until the
evil wind ceased and then carefully entered the valley. There was a
very weird land pulse there. He dug up a wind-winged snake egg from
that land pulse.”</p>
<p>“Did the wind-winged snake egg make that weird scene?” the man
asked. “It must have been a very powerful gene race. Did Mister Qiu
Shan bring this gene race to help us? I feel much safer after
learning that. I do not have to worry about meeting powerful gene
races.”</p>
<p>The other people nodded and agreed. They all complimented Ou
Yang Qiu Shan. It made Ou Yang Qiu Shan’s face look even more
wretchedly cocky.</p>
<p>Han Sen, who was next to them, saw it all clearly. The few guys
were not smiling truthfully.</p>
<p>The people who dared go to Ancient Big God Mountain were not
weak. They were there to bully Ou Yang Qiu Shan. They wanted to
kill him.</p>
<p>Now that he had been complimented by them when they met a
powerful gene race, Ou Yang Qiu Shan would be dying to show off. He
would probably rush in front of people and make their danger point
lower.</p>
<p>“OK, let’s go see what gene race that was.” Peaceful called the
men to go and get the gene race Ou Yang Qiu Shan had killed.</p>
<p>The God Spirit Blood-Pulse mark on the forehead of a man
flashed. Suddenly, a gold ape-like gene race was summoned out of
thin air. After it combined with the owner, he looked like an ape.
He climbed into the mountains, which somehow looked very flat. He
quickly raced into the mountains.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Everybody was waiting for him to bring the gene race
body back. After disappearing into the mountains, who would have
expected the man to suddenly let out a big scream?</p>
<p>The leader, Zhao Jue Ye, looked into the mountain and screamed,
“Old Nine, what is going on?”</p>
<p>Although the true leader was Peaceful, she had only brought one
guard. Aside from Han Sen, Mister Yang, Ou Yang Qiu Shan, and Ghost
Kill, they were all people belonging to Zhao Jue Ye.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know anything about Zhao Jue Ye. Peaceful had
made no effort to introduce him.</p>
<p>Zhao Jue Ye looked like a very nice old man. He appeared to be
in his 50s or 60s, yet he seemed very young. He looked a bit holy,
and the way he talked was funny. On the way, he had been talking
pleasantly with Han Sen and the others. He was like a very nice old
man.</p>
<p>Han Sen sensed that the men he was with were all weirdly polite
to him because they were likely obeying Zhao Jue Ye.</p>
<p>Zhao Jue Ye shouted a few times, but no one answered him from
the mountains. Everyone’s expressions changed.</p>
<p>Ou Yang Qiu Shan’s face looked the worst. He was the one who had
said the threat in the mountain had been eliminated, but now
someone had just screamed. His words were why Zhao Jue Ye had one
of his people collect the body.</p>
<p>Now, something had happened to Old Nine. Thus, everyone looked
at Ou Yang Qiu Shan, whose face looked grim.</p>
<p>“I will go and check it out,” Ou Yang Qiu Shan said. He flapped
his scaled wings and flew into the sky. He flew toward the
mountain.</p>
<p>“Let’s go take a look.” Peaceful seemed worried that something
might happen to Ou Yang Qiu Shan. She summoned her gene race,
combined with it, and went off into the mountains.</p>
<p>Everyone summoned their gene race. They combined and went to the
mountain’s wall. They were headed for the forest.</p>
<p>“Mister Yang, I am so sorry.” Han Sen was holding a metal
pillar. He used his other hand to grab Mister Yang. They jumped
outside of the mountain.</p>
<p>A few of them jumped into the mountain. He put down Mister Yang
and heard some screams come from the mountain. Han Sen quickly
followed the other people into the mountain. He was surprised by
what he. Everyone else was shocked as well.</p>
<p>Leaves were falling everywhere. On an old tree, which was 9-foot
tall, there was a monkey’s skin that was stretched. The gold hair
was dyed blood red. There was still blood dripping.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a look. It was not the skin of an ape. It was Old
Nine, who had just combined with an ape. Now, all that remained of
Old Nine was his skin. It was unknown where his flesh and bones
went. There was only that bloody skin left, and it was pinned to a
tree with branches.</p>
<p>“Whoa!” Ou Yang Qiu Shan was unable to keep his shock in. He
threw up everywhere. He almost coughed up his guts.</p>
<p>No matter how talented he was, he had never seen such a grisly
sight. The blood on the skin dripped across the tree. It made
everyone’s scalp feel numb. Chills were running down their
spines.</p>
<p>“Cry… Cry…” Not far away, from deeper into the mountains, a baby
cried. It was either the sound of a baby crying or a cat crying.
Regardless, the sound was ringing in everyone’s ears. It made
people feel a chill.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked toward where the sound had come from. Since his
seventh sense was suppressed too much in this world, and there were
lots of trees and vines around him, he was unable to see what was
there.</p>
