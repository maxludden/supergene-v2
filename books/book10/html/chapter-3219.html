<h2>Dust Sky</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3219</h3>

<p>One sky. One world. Han Sen went through nine skies without
seeing anyone from the God Chaos Party. “They’ve even cleared out
nine entire skies. It looks like God Chaos Party has been really
busy these past few years.” Han Sen kept on rushing. He used this
chance to see how many skies God Chaos Party had actually opened.
It was not because of God Hall Leader giving him benefits. Han Sen
just wanted to know how much progress God Chaos Party had made with
this endeavor of theirs.</p>
<p>If the God Chaos Party had really opened 33 skies, then he could
use the final part of the path to access the geno universe. He
would not have to use the God of Wealth Temple to enter the geno
universe for a few meager days.</p>
<p>If the geno universe was broken through by this enemy, it might
not bode well for the geno universe.</p>
<p>The geno universe and universe of kingdoms should have been
equal, but they were still two separate worlds. The thing about the
geno universe was that it did not have many Break World elites. Han
Sen had never seen any such people before.</p>
<p>Even if their power was as good as a Break World elite, they did
not have the capacity to break the world.</p>
<p>It was like the Sky Palace Leader’s existence. No matter the
talent or power or level of someone, they were not weaker than the
elites of the universe of kingdoms. Yet, they still could not break
the world.</p>
<p>Why the geno universe’s break world elites found breaking the
world so hard was something Han Sen had thought about in the past.
He thought the universe of kingdoms had so many Break World elites
because the God Chaos Party fought the God Spirits. In the end, it
made the last God Hall Leader reboot the universe of kingdoms. It
made the universe of kingdoms have many flaws in its fabric. With
all those flaws, it made breaking the world far easier.</p>
<p>The geno universe was not the main battleground. It was just
affected a little as a result. The rules of that universe were not
as bad as the rules of the other universe that had been destroyed.
So, it was hard to break the world in the geno universe.</p>
<p>When Han Sen reached the tenth sky, he saw humans again. The
tenth sky had many planets around. It was like a mini-universe of
kingdoms.</p>
<p>Humans were living there peacefully. Han Sen noticed many of the
humans on many of the different planets were still in a primal age.
Some planets were in an interstellar era though. There were lots of
giant battleships traveling through space.</p>
<p>“This cannot be an illusion again, can it?” Han Sen frowned.
With his Dongxuan Sutra’s sensing power, he felt as if the humans
were real and living things. He did not detect them to be illusions
like Shadow God had constructed.</p>
<p>The humans there were very strange. Even though they did not
have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse or gene race power, their power was
very weak. It was like they were normal humans who did not practice
inside the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s expression quickly changed. He felt his own power
weaken incredibly fast. His Dongxuan Sutra’s aura radius could
reach a few systems away, but it was suddenly shrunk to a level
that did not even allow him to scan a single planet.</p>
<p>It was not just his Dongxuan Sutra that had been affected this
way. Every power in his body was like that too. The scariest thing
about it was how it looked like Wan’er was affected as well. Her
power had been weakened. He could determine that from her god
flames, which had started to weaken.</p>
<p>“Why are things like that here? Whose power is it?” Han Sen
looked terrible. He turned around and wanted to leave the tenth
sky. Even Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit mode was affected. This
power was too scary.</p>
<p>When Han Sen established a direction to get through the tenth
sky, he saw a very powerful and overbearing king-like man standing
at the exit of the tenth sky. Han Sen looked at him.</p>
<p>“This is not a power anyone can have,” the man coldly said.
“This is the ruling power of Dust Sky. No creature can use its
powers here, not even God Spirits. If they come here, they will
become ordinary creatures that have no powers.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen felt as if his body’s power had been
reduced. At the rate his power was leaving his body, he was going
to be reduced to an ordinary man who could not even wrestle a
chicken within half an hour.</p>
<p>“I am God Chaos Party’s leader, Bury Path God,” the man coldly
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen could have guessed that a bit already. Upon hearing the
man say it, he was not surprised. He just kept dodging Wan’er’s
attack while looking at Bury Path God.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not see any power moving through the man. He
looked something like a commoner, but Han Sen did not actually
believe he was a commoner.</p>
<p>Although this place was Dust Sky, the power there could reduce
any creature into a commoner. At the same time, it was a nest for
the God Chaos Party. This was God Chaos Party’s leader. Han Sen did
not believe he had what it took to fight Dust Sky’s power.</p>
<p>If he was unable to block the power of Dust Sky, Han Sen didn’t
think he would have shown up there.</p>
<p>“I must get out of this place before my power is totally ground
away by the powers of Dust Sky.” Han Sen’s body flashed. His eyes
looked bright. His body suddenly went to Bury Path God. At the same
time, he wielded his Inch Grey Sword and unleashed the biggest
attack he could at Bury Path God.</p>
<p>Because of Han Sen’s plan, Wan’er’s gold light slashed toward
Bury Path God too.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Even though my and Wan’er’s power has been
reduced a lot if I only need him to expose his flaws and enable my
escape from Dust Sky, it should be fine. After all, Wan’er’s
reverse Super God Spirit mode has been weakened but is still very
strong.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not dare underestimate this temporary leader.
Although he was only filling in for the real leader, he was still
an elite who had challenged the entire God Spirit system.</p>
<p>Seeing Wan’er and Han Sen attack at the same time, Bury Path God
did not look as if he was going to dodge. He was like an unmoving
mountain. The moment the Inch Grey Sword and gold light were going
to hit him, his hand finally moved.</p>
<p>Two of his fingers held onto Han Sen’s Inch Grey Sword. The
other hand held Wan’er’s hand, which was slashing down.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly felt as if his Inch Grey Sword had been grabbed
by a pincer. He tried his best, but he could not make the Inch Grey
Sword budge an inch.</p>
<p>“If this was another place, even the leader would not have an
easy time fighting you,” Bury Path God said as his hands employed
some sort of power that blasted Han Sen and Wan’er backward. “But
this is Dust Sky. Your power has been turned into dust. You cannot
fight me, who is the temporary leader. You should just go and talk
to our leader.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the situation he was in was very bad. His power had
devolved to about 20% or even less. If he did not find a way to
escape that realm soon, he might find himself captured by the God
Chaos Party. If that were to happen, it wouldn’t be a happy ending.
Han Sen’s eyes kept flickering. Black and white power kept spinning
weirdly. The Dongxuan Sutra was running like crazy. Dust Sky’s most
basic structure appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>He was not someone who loved to waste time and wallow in regret.
Besides, now was not the time for regret. He had to find a way to
destroy the Dust Sky power before all of his power was depleted. If
he did not do that, he and Wan’er would have disaster fall upon
them.</p>
<p>Because of that hit earlier, Wan’er stopped going after Han Sen.
Her body flashed with gold light. She went to fight Bury Path God,
who had struck her.</p>
