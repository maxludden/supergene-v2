<p>He did not find anything weird on him, so Han Sen chose to
ignore it. He was trying to remember The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>In the past, Han Sen relied solely on his own power until he
remembered everything that man had said. It was like he had copied
and pasted the words into his mind. He did not really research the
meaning behind his words though.</p>
<p>Now that he did start thinking about it, he realized The Story
of Genes the Dao student mentioned had a lot of mistakes in it. A
lot of what he said was about the research, involved predictions,
and so on.</p>
<p>Han Sen read it all at once and realized the student did not
actually study The Story of Genes. If he had studied it, the
mistakes would not have existed. Han Sen believed it was just a
research paper and not really a bunch of statements that came
through via someone practicing the skill.</p>
<p>“Did that Dao member really mean it was research by calling it
research? Did he not actually practice The Story of Genes?” Han Sen
looked weird.</p>
<p>After thinking about it some more, Han Sen understood something
important.</p>
<p>“The Story of Genes is too taxing on the human body. No matter
how strong that Dao student was, he was just a human from the
original times. The evolution level of his genes was not going to
reach the requirements necessary to actually practice and find
success with The Story of Genes. Therefore, all he was able to do
was research it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to think, “Someone in the Dao party must have
practiced with The Story of Genes. After all, the black crystal
armor is a sacred item that belonged to Dao. Someone must have used
the black crystal armor to create The Story of Genes.”</p>
<p>Although that reverse The Story of Genes had a lot of mistakes
in it, it still helped Han Sen a little. Going down a muddy road
was better than no road.</p>
<p>“What a shame. I am already a pure body spirit. Aside from
spirits powers, no powers can work on my body. I also cannot
practice The Story of Genes anymore. Otherwise, I could try to put
what I’ve just learned to the test.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was disappointed. He was hoping to find a way to sort
out his spirit body. So far, he had yet to find a glimmer of
hope.</p>
<p>He did not want to waste any time. He decided on flying to the
33 skies. If he was unable to sort out his spirit body, he might as
well investigate and find out precisely what Qin Xiu was up to.</p>
<p>It was unknown if it was because of the spirit body, but Han Sen
could no longer rip space. He only needed to think about where he
wanted to go and would appear there. With this neat method of
travel, he thought about Soldier Knife Sky and appeared there.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed that he no longer had to go to the God Chaos
Party by breaking a tunnel in space. His spirit body was able to go
through the 33 skies barrier. He was not stopped.</p>
<p>“I wonder if the sky powers will affect my spirit body?” Han
Sen’s heart jumped. His spirit body floated on through, going
through layer after layer of the skies. He eventually reached Dust
Sky.</p>
<p>In Dust Sky, any power was weakened. Even a God Spirit would
become a common creature in such a place.</p>
<p>Back in the day, Han Sen had fought there and been put at a dire
disadvantage. Now, with his spirit body appearing there, he was not
affected. It was like the powers of Dust Sky no longer existed.</p>
<p>“That means I can use this spirit body to go through the 33
skies and reach the geno universe…” Han Sen was pretty excited
about this concept. After thinking about it some more, he felt
depressed.</p>
<p>“Even if I do go through the 33 skies and reach the old
universe, so what? No one will be able to see me. It does not
matter if I return or not.” Han Sen felt very troubled.</p>
<p>“I should just go and take a look at what Qin Xiu is doing
first.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. It took him to the next sky.</p>
<p>Fortunately for him, Han Sen had already asked big sky demon for
the old tower’s location there. In just a few more thoughts, he was
already brought before the 17th sky’s old tower.</p>
<p>That sky was where Qin Xiu lived. Big sky demon had said that
aside from Qin Xiu, no member of the God Chaos Party was allowed to
visit there.</p>
<p>“My spirit body is pretty nifty when it comes to traveling.
There is nothing in this world that stops me from getting to where
I need and want to go.” Han Sen spoke in a self-deprecating manner
to mock himself.</p>
<p>The old tower was sealed tight. Han Sen came before it and went
right through the front door. What he saw next surprised him. The
first floor of the old tower was very empty. There were four walls
and some metal boxes that looked like sarcophaguses for mummies.
Han Sen calculated there were 11 metal boxes.</p>
<p>He did not see Qin Xiu, but he was curious about the metal
boxes. He flew over to the metal boxes. His spirit body was not
inhibited, so he was able to fly right into them.</p>
<p>After going into the metal boxes, Han Sen was surprised by what
he saw. A pair of red eyes were staring at him like a ghost.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a closer look. He noticed that the eyes were not
staring at him. They were just looking straight ahead.</p>
<p>There was a creature inside, but he had no idea what it was
supposed to be. Its body had many layers of a white substance. It
was more like snakeskin. It was unknown what the creature might
have looked like on the inside. Its eyes had two holes. The eyes
were red. It was like the creature was enduring unimaginable pain
and suffering.</p>
<p>Han Sen figured it was likely one of Qin Xiu’s life soul test
subjects. He was not interested in trying to find out what
precisely that white stuff was either.</p>
<p>After flying out of the metal box, Han Sen entered a few more
metal boxes to see what was inside of them. Every metal box had a
test subject that was molting or peeling in a horrid fashion.</p>
<p>He teleported to the second floor of the old tower. Everything
there was precisely the same. There were many more of those metal
boxes.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew up layer by layer. The image of each chamber was
similar. Some layers had many metal boxes, whereas other floors
only had a few metal boxes.</p>
<p>He went all the way up to the 10th floor. He saw a crystal stand
and Wan’er, who was blonde, wearing a white robe. She was fast
asleep on a crystal bed. She looked very sweet as she slept.</p>
<p>“Weird. This place is already the old tower’s top. Why is Qin
Xiu not here? I thought Qin Xiu spent all of his time practicing in
the old tower.” Han Sen looked around some more, but he could find
no hide nor hair of Qin Xiu. He thought something had to be
wrong.</p>
<p>“If Qin Xiu is not in the tower, where is he?” Han Sen thought
with a frown. He could not think of a reason as to why this could
be.</p>
<p>“I wonder if I can touch Wan’er?” Han Sen reached his hand out
to see if he could touch Wan’er’s hair, but his hand went through
her scalp. He could not feel a thing.</p>
<p>Han Sen was disappointed. Wan’er had a reverse Super God Spirit
mode, yet their bodies could not interact. His spirit body was very
weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept going back and forth around the old tower. The
place was not as mysterious as he thought it might be. On top of
that, Qin Xiu was not even there.</p>
<p>“Although Wan’er has been revived, she did not seem to remember
all the time we spent together. There is an 80% to 90% chance that
this revived Wan’er only remembers what happened in the Qin
Kingdom. What a shame that is.” Han Sen looked at Wan’er and
sighed.</p>
<p>If the Wan’er with a nice will still existed, perhaps she might
have been able to affect Qin Xiu. She might have been able to
convince Qin Xiu to not be so overbearing.</p>
<p>“It is such a shame that I have no way to bring your will back,”
Han Sen thought. If he had the power needed, he would make the nice
Wan’er wake up. That would be the real Wan’er.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking, he realized his hand was flickering
with a purple light.</p>
