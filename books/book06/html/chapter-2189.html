<h2>Bad News</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2189</h3>

<p>The little toads gathered around him, and they seemed to think
he was one of them. The thought made Han Sen’s heart sink, though,
and he found himself thinking, “I’m not some dirty toad!”</p>
<p>After that day, Han Sen continued coming back to absorb cold and
moon powers twice every month. He didn’t need the Cold Palace
guardian tablet anymore, and the big toad allowed him to follow the
toad family to the waterfall. He was able to absorb the moon powers
right next to the deified toad.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Jadeskin grew stronger far faster. Han Sen initially
thought it might need another year to reach Duke rank, but it was
on the precipice of that change already. He believed that if he
continued this steady absorption of cold and moon powers, he’d make
it to Duke in three months.</p>
<p>When Jadeskin did become Duke, though, he’d have to track down a
source of high-quality resources for himself. He couldn’t rely
solely on Planet Eclipse.</p>
<p>It was a good place for early practice, but he couldn’t develop
fully if he remained stuck there.</p>
<p>On that fifteenth of the month, when Han Sen was done guarding
the door, he planned to leave Planet Blade and return to Planet
Eclipse. But when he reached Yisha’s palace, two Rebate butlers
approached, alongside Snowbird Duke.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, Moon Wheel King is looking for you. Please follow us
to Full Moon Hall,” said a butler, his face expressionless.</p>
<p>“Why is Moon Wheel King looking for me?” Han Sen asked with a
frown.</p>
<p>Full Moon Palace was a place to hold discussions. Only the Kings
of Narrow Moon were allowed to debate there. It was very rare for
Moon Wheel King to summon a Marquise for an audience in Full Moon
Hall.</p>
<p>“You will know when you get there, won’t you?” another butler
said coldly.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Snowbird Duke. She was behaving strangely,
holding herself a little more rigidly than usual. He did not say
anything, but he just nodded to her.</p>
<p>“Moon Wheel King and the other Kings are waiting for you. Let’s
go,” the butler told him, apparently in a rush.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed them to Full Moon Hall. On the ship there, Han
Sen got to thinking, “Something bad must have happened to Yisha.
Otherwise, there’s no way I’d be called to the Full Moon Office. If
something has happened to her, then my days here will be over.
Things might be coming to an end.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that the only other person of rank in Narrow Moon
who liked him was Black-Moon King.</p>
<p>The other Kings were not very keen on him, despite being Yisha’s
student. After all, Han Sen was not one of the Rebate. And he had
consumed many of their resources. He was just fortunate that the
Rebate didn’t flat-out hate him.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had been able to practice really quickly, perhaps the
Kings would have viewed him differently. However, leveling up took
Han Sen an excruciatingly long time. They did not think Han Sen
would ever reach King, let alone become deified. This was one of
the primary reasons they didn’t think too highly of him.</p>
<p>To them, his guardianship was just another example of his
deficiency. If the post had been given to another talented
Marquise, that person would definitely have become a Duke after so
much time. No change had been observed with Han Sen, though. No
change for him meant no gain for them.</p>
<p>Han Sen was backed by Yisha, but if she was gone, then the
Rebate wouldn’t waste more resources on an outsider like him.</p>
<p>“The Rebate is too small of a faction. It is a higher race that
used to be a slave race. They aren’t selfless, either. Only Yisha
was willing to help me. What a shame this is!” Han Sen vented
silently. He knew what was going to happen on this trip.</p>
<p>When Han Sen reached the Full Moon Office, everyone was sitting
around a large table within.</p>
<p>Almost all of the Narrow Moon Kings were present. Moon Wheel
King was in the middle. Black-Moon King, Shadow King, Flower King,
Night River King, and the other Kings sat next to him. The table
resembled a half-moon, and as Han Sen walked in, they all turned
their attention to him.</p>
<p>“Greetings to all the Kings.” After Han Sen bowed to each of
them, he stood where he was without displaying any emotions.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King sighed and told Han Sen, “Yesterday, the Extreme
King delivered some news to us. Your teacher, on her venture into
the chaos system, was killed. Not even her bones remain. We are
going to build a mausoleum in her honor. You were her only student,
and so there are many things we must now do together.”</p>
<p>“I will do whatever I am able to. May I ask how my master was
killed?” Han Sen bowed, feeling very strange about this.</p>
<p>In truth, Yisha was Han Sen’s enemy. He had only become her
student as a pretense, and Yisha seemed to have accepted him as a
student for reasons of her own, not because she was being
altruistic.</p>
<p>But in all the time they had spent together, Yisha had treated
him nicely. She had provided him with many opportunities. Without
those opportunities, He might have spent ten years wandering
around, and he wouldn’t have achieved half of what he had right
now.</p>
<p>So, his feelings towards Yisha were very conflicted. Hearing she
had died, an odd pang rolled through him. He didn’t really know
what he was feeling.</p>
<p>“According to the Extreme King ambassador, she joined the siege
against a deified xenogeneic. She was swallowed by it, and so
nothing of her remains,” Moon Wheel King said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King’s sigh was not fake. It wouldn’t be easy for the
Rebate to raise a half-deified warrior. And Yisha had been their
best hope of gaining a fully deified Rebate.</p>
<p>Losing Yisha was a big blow to their race.</p>
<p>If Yisha had not gone to the Extreme King, though, she wouldn’t
have been able to become deified by herself. If she remained in
Narrow Moon, she’d have been half-deified forever.</p>
<p>For someone like Yisha, stopping there would have been worse
than death.</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed silent after hearing about her death. Being
killed by a deified xenogeneic, without so much as a bone being
left behind, was something of a clean way to go out. That was very
much like her own style.</p>
<p>When Moon Wheel King lapsed into silence, Night River spoke.
“After sorting out Knife Queen’s mausoleum, there will still be
some things I will need you to do. You are her only student, so
there are some legacy matters and items you will have to take over.
I will confirm them, and later give them to you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that this was the primary point. He didn’t know how
much of a legacy the Rebate would be willing to leave him with.</p>
<p>Han Sen was afraid he wouldn’t have a say in these matters.
Night River King surely didn’t want to give him anything, and it
was definitely going to be a one-sided decision.</p>
<p>Han Sen had expected this, though, so he didn’t say anything. He
listened to what he was told, and then he left Full Moon Office. He
went to sort out her funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>“The Extreme King have sent the reward she was owed for the
fight. It should be given to Han Sen…” Black-Moon King said, but
before he could finish, Night River King interrupted him.</p>
<p>“Han Sen isn’t one of the Rebate, have you forgotten? He isn’t
qualified to accept it. We have discussed this already. Say no
more,” Night River King said firmly.</p>
