<h2>Hunting King Class Xenogeneics</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2359</h3>

<p>As far as Han Sen knew, Bai Yi cleared Planet Water Zone a long
time ago. Even Lan Haixin hadn’t bothered sending out hunting
parties. But now, Han Sen had met two King class xenogeneics in a
row. Both were in the same vicinity, too. This posed a big
problem.</p>
<p>Pulling out his Thunder God Spike, Han Sen went towards the King
class electric eel.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t really care what change Planet Water Zone was
experiencing right now. He was just going to kill any King class
creatures he found. Getting King class genes was good for him.</p>
<p>He used his Original Water King Body, then unleashed his dragon
area as well. Han Sen moved like a water dragon as he rushed toward
the big electric eel. The Thunder God Spike flickered with scary
silver lightning, and the sound of thunder rumbled along its
path.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s King areas entangled the giant electric eel. The water
restricted the eel’s body, and the creature swam extremely slowly,
as if it was moving through mud.</p>
<p>While Han Sen rejoiced at the success of his attack, the
electric eel suddenly loosed a crackling discharge of lightning.
The lightning created a scary thunder area and merged with Han
Sen’s own area. The electricity shot through the water and into Han
Sen. His hair instantly poofed straight out and began vibrating
with the force of the current.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s electrified body bounced away. He came to a stop after
arcing through the water for a long time. His tongue felt numb.</p>
<p>“A king area focused purely on attack is too scary. And that
electricity has a strong paralytic effect. This is at least a
sixth-tier area. This electric eel will be hard to deal with.” Han
Sen held still in an attempt to hide himself, but the electric eel
was already rushing toward him. Its thunder area came with it, and
streams of electric chains shot out of its mouth.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his water skills to dodge the thunder area and the
lightning chains. Fortunately, he still had the benefits of his
water areas. He moved much faster in the water than the electric
eel did. If not for his speed advantage, he would have already
taken more hits. That would have been extremely painful—even if his
body could withstand it.</p>
<p>After dodging out of the eel’s immediate attack range, Han Sen
summoned Spell’s dual pistols and started firing. It wasn’t the sea
conch, so Han Sen didn’t have to worry too much about its blocking
abilities.</p>
<p>When the bullets entered the thunder area, the eel reacted
immediately. It spewed more of that lightning to destroy the
incoming bullets.</p>
<p>But one or two of the bullets still managed to strike the eel’s
scales. Familiar symbols began to shine across the impacted scales,
showing the results of Han Sen’s Turtle skill.</p>
<p>The Turtle skill took effect, and after a few more shots landed,
the electric eel was much slower. However, the lightning on its
body was still incredibly strong, and the creature’s thunder area
covered the surrounding region, so Han Sen couldn’t get close to
the creature.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Spell became a sniper rifle, and Han Sen fired a bullet toward
the electric eel. The bullet shattered the eel’s scales and tore
into its side. Purple Teeth power spread across the wound.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s techniques weren’t King class yet, and his Original
Water King Body only had a first-tier area. Taking down a King
class xenogeneic with a sixth-tier area would be incredibly
difficult.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Turtle skill worked well against the eel. Because
of that, the foe was unable to catch up to Han Sen. He led it to
the seabed, firing continually at the creature. Teeth power
continued to shred its wounds. As it lost more and more blood, the
electric eel’s area grew weaker.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic King hunted: Electric Dragon. Xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the giant electric eel’s body sink while the
announcement played in his head.</p>
<p>“It is a shame I didn’t receive its beast soul. An electric
beast soul would have been very powerful.” Han Sen swam over to the
electric eel’s body and dug out its xenogeneic gene.</p>
<p>He summoned his Shadow Queen Bee and let it eat the big electric
eel’s body.</p>
<p>Shadow Queen Bee hadn’t matured yet, and Han Sen was already a
Duke. The Queen Bee wouldn’t be useful to him at this point, but
since he had the meat available, he might as well let her eat it.
Otherwise, it would all be wasted.</p>
<p>Shadow Queen Bee crawled over the body and ate with difficulty.
Han Sen swallowed the entire electrified bone that was the
xenogeneic gene. He also used his Consume talent to refine it with
haste.</p>
<p>A numb feeling swept over Han Sen’s body. It was like his cells
were electrified, and they began to vibrate with energy.</p>
<p>“Duke gene… Duke gene…”</p>
<p>When Han Sen finished refining the electric bone, his Duke gene
tally had reached eighty-four. He was close to having a
hundred.</p>
<p>“If I kill two more King class xenogeneics, I’ll have maxed it
out. And then, I can open The Story of Genes’ first gene lock.” As
Han Sen was calculating, he heard a boom in the distance.</p>
<p>Something tore its way out of the little hole under the
mountain, dramatically widening the opening. The blood kirin
emerged from the swirls of debris and returned to its ordinary
size.</p>
<p>Blood dripped from the blood kirin’s mouth, and grievous
injuries marred its scales. It was in very bad condition.</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>The blood kirin made it back to Han Sen, then fell onto its
stomach on the seafloor. It struggled to get up.</p>
<p>Wounds covered its legs, and one leg had been twisted
ninety-degrees. Black blood oozed around the wound.</p>
<p>The black blood drifted into the water around the blood kirin’s
body, then turned into some sort of small black bugs. They latched
on to the blood kirin and started nibbling on its wounds and
scales.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was a cruel and violent beast, but now it was
actually squealing.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. The blood kirin was a half-deified
xenogeneic that was nearly peerless, and judging from the way it
had been injured, it had encountered something other than the sea
conch.</p>
<p>The blood kirin’s blood continued to become bugs, and Han Sen
couldn’t determine what sort of power had been used against his
companion.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still holding the Thunder God Spike, and he poked it
into the blood kirin’s wound. The black bugs began to shriek as Han
Sen electrified them, and after a minute, they all fell off the
wound.</p>
<p>Those bugs vanished, but the blood gushing from the blood
kirin’s wounds was turning into more black bugs. If that continued,
the blood kirin’s veins were going to run dry.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the little bugs, and he realized they were
actually small sea conches.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to see what was going on
with the blood kirin. Many small, black sea conches were squirming
around inside the blood kirin. There were too many to count, and
the sight of them made Han Sen feel sick. At the rate that the
blood kirin’s body was being devoured, it wouldn’t be long until
only its bones remained.</p>
<p>Han Sen wondered how he might save the blood kirin, but then
something else came crawling out of the hole that the blood kirin
had expanded. The newcomer’s body swelled back to normal size. It
was that same, King class sea conch.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could react, another sea conch emerged from the
hole. This one was beautiful and full of color. Its shell was like
a crystal, and its colors shifted and glowed like a rainbow.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw that beautiful sea conch, the color drained out
of his face.</p>
