<h2>Leveling Up While Fighting</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2680</h3>

<p>The two of them continued fighting, but they were unable to deal
damage to each other.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept altering his knife skills. Shale’s punching skill
didn’t change in the face of Han Sen’s rapidly mutating attacks.
The two of them fought as hard and fast as they could, but neither
of them could gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>It had been a very long time since Han Sen had a fight like
this. In his recent fights, he had either lost to his enemies or
crushed them almost immediately. He hadn’t put so much energy and
effort into a fight since his contest with Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>A fight like this drained a lot of energy from his body. It also
forced him to use his mind constantly. If he made a mistake, his
enemy would take advantage of the window and beat him. He couldn’t
afford to make a single misstep.</p>
<p>As the Very High watched the pair conduct their battle,
conflicted looks appeared across their faces. Both of the fighters
were King class, but their minds were deified. The fight was so
nuanced that the onlookers didn’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>This was no ordinary battle. This fight took effort and
brainpower. Many of the attacks and counters seemed simple, until
the audience took a second to consider why the two fighters had
chosen those moves. Every single action in this fight was done with
an ulterior motive.</p>
<p>It looked like a simple fist and knife fight, but people would
be thinking about it for a long time afterward.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng’s bodies were quivering. It was hard
to tell who was going to win and who would lose. It looked as if
winning or losing would only come from a hair-thin lead.</p>
<p>“Big Brother, having Shale as your silkworm is very fortuitous
for you.” Bixi looked at his big brother Li Chun Qiu with grand
admiration.</p>
<p>“Yu Shanxin isn’t bad, either,” Li Chun Qiu said distantly.
Since Shale was his silkworm, he wasn’t really paying much
attention to their conversation. He felt as if he was fighting Han
Sen himself, right then and there. But there were many fighting
minds and techniques he had to learn that he had never previously
encountered. It felt so strange.</p>
<p>Experiencing the battle from Shale’s perspective was unique. He
felt like he was fighting himself, but at the same time, he could
step back and examine Shale’s choices with a critical eye. He could
tell which decisions Shale made were better than his opponent and
vice versa. He only absorbed the good battle experiences, while
figuring out and filing away the bad ones.</p>
<p>Right now, Shale was only half-deified. In the future, Shale
would travel through the deified ranks of primitive, transmutation,
larva, butterfly, and maybe even true god. Li Chun Qiu could slowly
absorb everything that Shale experienced.</p>
<p>At that point, Li Chun Qiu would only be half-deified. But he
would have the experience of a true god. Li Chun Qiu could slowly
study everything that Shale had learned through his evolution.
Although he would only be half-deified himself, his mind would be
on a different level.</p>
<p>Bixi looked bitter as he said, “This Yu Shanxin hides a great
deal from me. He is so strong and tough. He is a difficult nut to
crack. Even now, I have yet to learn a single thing from his
mind.”</p>
<p>“Those silkworms might be the most challenging, but they’re also
the most rewarding. Conquering them will yield better results in
the long run,” Li Chun Qiu said.</p>
<p>“You are right, but… Well, never mind. I bet Exquisite and Li
Keer have the same problem…” Bixi said.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer did have trouble, but Han Sen let them in
when he fought. Like Li Chun Qiu, they gained a lot of battle
experience from Han Sen. Each decision he made taught them a
lot.</p>
<p>But while Han Sen was a ninth-tier King, he had a scary power
and a scarier mind. It made them so happy. Even if Han Sen lost
this fight, just getting to experience this battle would be more
than worth it to them.</p>
<p>One thing caught them off guard, though. Despite the intensity
of the fight, they could sense that Han Sen was deliberately hiding
the true range of his powers.</p>
<p>“Is Han Sen not using all of his strength?” The possibility
stunned them. He was already fighting at an unbelievable level, and
yet he didn’t seem to have tapped into the full potential of his
power. That was a scary thought.</p>
<p>Li Keer had always thought Dollar was stronger than Han Sen, but
she now found herself looking at the man with a complicated
expression.</p>
<p>Although he was fighting an elite like Shale, Han Sen could
still hide some of his power. This was no longer just an
intimidating display of ability; it was out-and-out
frightening.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen tried his best to close off his mind and avoid
thinking about the Dongxuan Sutra and his super god spirit body, Li
Keer and Exquisite were still able to pick up that he was
suppressing something. They would come to know that Han Sen was
hiding his true power, but that couldn’t be avoided.</p>
<p>In truth, Han Sen’s ability to suppress his thoughts at all in
this situation indicated that the power of his mind was
terrifyingly profound. In a fight like that, most people would need
to constantly think about which geno arts and powers they were good
at.</p>
<p>“This guy is too scary…” Li Keer said while she watched Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“He is rather frightening, isn’t he? I don’t think he will ever
fail to surprise us. Every time we think we have seen it all, he
goes the extra mile and does more,” Exquisite said with a nervous
smile.</p>
<p>When she fought Han Sen, she thought that she had forced him to
cast many of his skills. But it now looked like Han Sen had only
used a fraction of his talent when he was fighting her. He was now
bringing out more tools, but even more were still being kept
hidden.</p>
<p>“We must dig into this man and unearth all of his secrets,” Li
Keer said. Her eyes were brimming with excitement.</p>
<p>Li Keer had better potential than Exquisite, but she didn’t
focus on the Very High Sense. Her Very High Forget Love wasn’t as
developed as Exquisite’s, so she was prone to becoming more
emotional.</p>
<p>Exquisite only coldly said, “There is no rush. We have four
years. He will reveal his secrets to us in time. It doesn’t matter
that he has managed to hide it all for now.”Open Sky Elder looked a
bit gloomy, and he said, “The smallest move could determine how
this plays out. Either one of them could win at this point. Han Sen
is strong, but he is just a ninth-tier King. He is ranked lower
than Shale. If they were in the same class, Han Sen would have a
seventy percent chance of winning.”</p>
<p>Qiyu Elder shook his head and said, “No, it doesn’t work like
that. Shale is half-deified, but his will is deified. Han Sen is
just a ninth-tier King, and yet, he is holding his own against a
powerful half-deified. That means his talent and potential are
scarier than Shale’s.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean the eleven armor talent test was legit?” Open
Sky Elder wondered with a frown.</p>
<p>“It is hard to say. If he isn’t doing this well because of his
talent, then it is hard to imagine what Han Sen has that is letting
him fight Shale.” Qiyu Elder looked at Han Sen, his face
conflicted.</p>
<p>“A ten armor talent is very rare. A real eleven armor talent
would make a man the greatest of his generation. Do you think Han
Sen is this kind of great man?” Open Sky Elder asked, looking a
little worried.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure about that, but it is plain to see that his talent
is stunning. Li Keer and Exquisite got lucky when they signed a
contract with him,” Qiyu Elder said.</p>
<p>“What is going on… Something is wrong with Shale!” Open Sky
Elder wanted to say something, but he was in too much shock. Then,
his face went white. He looked at Shale in the video and screamed,
“He… He’s going to level up!”</p>
