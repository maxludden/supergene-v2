    <p>
      Jia Shidao was extremely confident in the white-knuckle power his fists
      could deliver, so he didn’t summon a geno core. The Iron-Fist Martial Hall
      was made famous by his Iron-Fist Slash, a brutal move when coupled with
      his fitness level.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had even managed to max out his ordinary, primitive, and mutant geno
      points, placing his fitness level at over fifteen thousand. Eight thousand
      of those levels were from mutant geno points alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed his Iron-Fist could beat and destroy anything, even silver
      geno cores. He was impressed that Han Sen could create a bronze geno core,
      but he did not think he had any that were greater than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Jia Shidao was comfortable in the prospect of using only his fists. He
      did not think he needed to summon his own geno core. But he thought
      something was amiss the moment Han Sen lashed a whip-like item towards
      him. The item was frighteningly quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anticipation of seeing what geno core a new combatant would wield was
      always exciting, as they came in all shapes and forms. The creativity of
      some ranged from almighty to hilarious. But this was Han Sen, and the
      anticipation to see what he had created was through the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao’s fists began turning black, and they drove themselves into the
      incoming beam of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Iron-Fist Slash move had destroyed many bronze and silver geno cores
      in the past, with just one fell swoop. He was supremely confident the same
      result would befall Han Sen’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when his fist connected with the light, the tense muscles in his face
      quickly unfastened themselves. A metallic clang rang out, as he felt his
      fist barrel into a material that was as tough as it was soft. It was of a
      chewy texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not break the Gold Dragon Lock, and he immediately felt himself
      be ensnared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Interesting! His geno core is a rope; that’ll certainly keep him
      tied-up.” Zhu Donglai laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green thought it to be as fascinating as it was humorous, and he laughed
      and said, “Jia Shidao has clearly underestimated him, then. I bet Han
      Sen’s geno core has a softening, cushion-like power.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji did not say anything, and merely continued watching. Han Sen
      had already told him what his self-geno cores were, so he knew that what
      he was making use of now was not any of those.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Old Man Ji was still very curious to learn the class of the geno core
      Han Sen had used. Old Man Ji settled on the belief it was a silver geno
      core, and a very good one at that. While it seemed to display a power more
      commonly expected in a gold geno core, he didn’t think Han Sen could get
      his hands on one of those.
    </p>
    <p>
      They thought Jia Shidao had made a slip, and that he had not imbued all
      his power into the strike he wished to perform. They thought he had let
      his cockiness get the better of him, and as a result, allowed Han Sen to
      get the better of him as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was able to break silver geno cores with ease, and he himself had a
      gold self-geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from this self-geno core, he had many bronze and silver ones, so
      this initial capturing did not spell doom for his combat against Han Sen.
      Escaping the snare, he and the others believed, would be quite easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji hoped Han Sen would soon put the core away, though, as it would
      be a great shame to see such a brilliant geno core be broken. But Han Sen
      wasn’t going to do that. Han Sen had to rely on this geno core to gain the
      upper-hand, unbeknownst to the others. He couldn’t risk using his other
      geno cores, as they’d end up broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although self-geno cores could be broken and then later regenerated, doing
      so would put great strain on the body. It would also take a long time;
      time Han Sen couldn’t really afford right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t going to let this happen, and thinking this was a great
      chance to stress test his Gold Dragon Lock, he was keen to learn whether
      or not Jia Shidao could break free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confident in the lock, though, and he knew Jia Shidao’s fitness
      didn’t rival a top-dog mutant creature. There was every chance he couldn’t
      escape its snatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao tried to maintain his cool, but he had to let a frown show. He
      used all the strength he could, but no matter what he tried, he could not
      get himself free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone looked on in great surprise. They could see his muscles rise,
      webbed by stressed-out veins. It looked as if his muscles were going to
      break through the fabric of his clothing any second now, redefining what
      it meant to be ripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rope just tightened even more, and it did not show any sign of
      breaking. And eventually, it began to shred the clothing, exposing the
      man’s bulging body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things quickly took a concerning turn. The rope did not relent in its
      tightening, and it eventually began to wear into the skin, drawing blood.
      Jia Shidao’s face changed. His power was like a volcano, but the
      measly-looking rope had bested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao tried gunning his muscles a multitude of times in the hopes he
      could break free, but nothing came loose. He could not earn himself any
      slack, and blood began to dye the rope and drip to the hall’s floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very awkward looking scene, truth be told. And as they watched,
      Green and the others’ faces began to distort.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were shocked that Jia Shidao could not escape what was essentially a
      rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked to be in an awful condition, made worse by how confident he had
      been when he walked out there. He wanted to prove to Han Sen that the
      young man had missed out not co-operating with him. He looked like an
      utter fool now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao had no clue what to do himself, so he decided to summon his
      gold geno core. He knew his bronze and silver ones couldn’t help, and if
      he summoned them, only for them to break, the embarrassment would only
      increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gold geno core he had summoned was a pair of giant scissors laden
      with fish teeth. They looked to have been forged of blacksteel, and they
      were frighteningly sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji was surprised, seeing him summon his geno core Scissor Slash.
      He was glad to see Han Sen had come so far and he was this powerful, and
      he was more than impressed to see he had put Jia Shidao in a situation
      where he had no choice but to summon his most powerful geno core.
