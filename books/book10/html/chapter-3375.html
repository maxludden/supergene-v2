<p>“Dad!” Bao’er saw Han Sen and immediately ran up to him.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, let’s go.” Han Sen picked up Bao’er and readied himself
to leave Burning Red Sky. Before they could leave, many space
tunnels opened in Burning Red Sky. They looked similar to black
holes. Many scary creatures were coming through the black
holes.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, we meet again.” A weird voice sounded. Han Sen saw
Shoot Shadow of the God Chaos Party emerge from a black hole. The
people accompanying him a few of God Chaos Party’s elders. One of
them was Rocky Dee, with whom Han Sen was already quite
familiar.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored Shoot Shadow’s presence. He grabbed Bao’er and
used his identity as the Burning Red Sky’s leader to leave Burning
Red Sky. He soon heard a scary beast make a roaring noise. The
whole of Burning Red Sky started to shake and shiver. Space seemed
all wrong. Han Sen was unable to leave Burning Red Sky. A Break
World beast that looked like a real dragon entered the place from a
warp in space. Wherever it went, space was twisted. Its giant body
appeared in Burning Red Sky. Its presence affected the entire space
of Burning Red Sky, trapping it and everything else in there.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you should just die. You have been able to prompt the
whole God Chaos Party to send out this many elites, so be proud.
Your death will be a noble one.” Shoot Shadow looked at Han Sen
with an expression of pride smearing his face.</p>
<p>“I might not be the one that ends up dead,” Han Sen said while
putting Bao’er down.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t you, are you suggesting it will be me?” Shoot
Shadow laughed as if it was a funny joke.</p>
<p>“Yes, it will be you.” Shoot Shadow had only just finished
speaking when he heard a cold sound come from behind.</p>
<p>Shoot Shadow obviously wanted to turn around and see who it was,
but a paper knife came swinging down. His vision started to roll as
his head flew into the sky. His dead face had an expression of
disbelief.</p>
<p>The other God Chaos Party elders looked shocked. They saw Rocky
Dee murder Shoot Shadow.</p>
<p>“Mister, allow me to handle this. Han Sen, you take the master
ahead and leave first.” Rocky Dee put his right hand against his
chest as he bowed before Han Sen. He then turned around and faced
all the creatures with his paper knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Rocky Dee was not bowing to him. It was the black
crystal armor he had on. He was bowing to the leader of the God
Chaos Party.</p>
<p>He knew Rocky Dee would probably end up dead, but Han Sen was in
a weakened condition. Even if he fought alongside Rocky Dee, he
would probably end up dying with him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He picked up Bao’er and used the
last of his power to break space and leave.</p>
<p>The scary Break World beast that looked like a real dragon
roared. It was trying to consume Han Sen.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, many Break World beasts rushed there
too.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s eyes looked cold. His hands opened. Paper appeared
like snowflakes. His 10 fingers became pairs of scissors. They
crossed each other. The paper looked like a blizzard as he made
loads many silhouettes.</p>
<p>The silhouettes turned into many scary creatures that could
battle with the Break World beasts. They blocked most of the
advancing Break World beasts.</p>
<p>A God Chaos Party elder coldly questioned Rocky Dee. “Rocky Dee,
how dare you become an enemy of the leader! Do you even know what
you are doing?”</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s lips were crooked at a very disdainful angle. In his
eyes, there was only one leader for the God Chaos Party—Chaos.</p>
<p>After that, Rocky Dee swung his paper knife and went straight to
the Break World beasts that were rushing in like a mad tide.</p>
<p>“If you want to die, I cannot help you.” The God Chaos Party
elder looked cold as he waved his hands. Many more Break World
beasts came charging at Rocky Dee.</p>
<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He did not look at the fight that was
behind him. Even though he did not look back, he could imagine what
it looked like.</p>
<p>“Out of the way!” Han Sen gathered the last of his strength to
throw a punch at the real dragon-looking Break World beast. With
the skills of his Super Spank, a powerful power broke the Break
World beast’s massive body. His punch punctured the fiend and
created a big and bloody hole in its chest.</p>
<p>Han Sen used that impact crater to cut through the Break World
beast’s body and escape the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Sky King was helping Qin Xiu, who was a son of the 33 skies. The
33 skies were no longer a safe place for Han Sen to be in. He would
only be able to survive if he got out of the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen was able to get out of Burning Red Sky, a body
suddenly blocked his way.</p>
<p>“I am one of the four kings of the God Chaos Party, Itchy! I
will be taking your life.” The shadow came before him. Time felt as
if it stopped before that man.</p>
<p>Han Sen shockingly noticed his body seemed to be moving despite
nothing around him changing. It was like all of space was frozen
around him.</p>
<p>The voice of Chaos started to speak in Han Sen’s mind. “That is
a time element Break World creature. Its Break World rate is almost
100%. Only by using a geno prototype armor can you make a Break
World creature like that.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt glum. His power was almost all drained. He did not
have the juice needed to deal with a top-class Break World
beast.</p>
<p>“Time is like my needle,” Itchy coldly said. “Thousands of years
of time reside in my fingers. Your time in existence will be erased
by my hands. You will vanish from the river of time.”</p>
<p>He waved his fingers.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if time around him was freezing. It was as if he
had fallen into a place where time did not advance, and everything
remained still.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen felt space become lively again. Things started
to move.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Han Sen was shocked. He suddenly heard a
voice.</p>
<p>“Do you want to play with time? You are very far from being able
to! Before me, no one else can control time!” A long shadow
appeared out of the river of time.</p>
<p>It seemed very slow, but it was very fast. The shadow walked
past Han Sen. Wherever she went, the frozen time returned to its
ordinary flow. It was like a river of ice was being melted.</p>
<p>“Moment God!” Han Sen looked at the proud shadow. He was
shocked.</p>
<p>This Moment God was not the one in the God of Wealth Temple.
This was the Moment God that was one of the 12 Annihilation-class
God Spirits. Han Sen would have never guessed that Moment God would
show up now, seemingly with a desire to aid him.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at? Do you want me to throw you into an
endless time loop?” Moment God did not look back or look at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Han Sen did not know why Moment God had shown up to
help him, but now was not the time to talk. He picked Bao’er up and
left.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Itchy looked dim. He wanted to stop Han Sen. When he
moved, Moment God stopped him.</p>
<p>“Do not die yet,” Moment God said. “I am the one that is
supposed to kill you.”</p>
