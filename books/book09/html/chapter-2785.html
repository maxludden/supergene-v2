<h2>Killing Sky Radish</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2785</h3>

<p>The white phoenix fires ravaged the wound. This injury was so
small that it clearly mattered little to Sky Vine Radish and his
god body, but to Han Sen, it was a very important step on the path
to taking down Sky Vine Radish completely. If he was unable to harm
the god body at all, how could he even think about killing a
god?</p>
<p>Han Sen had now focused his awareness on the phoenix flame that
the phoenix had given him. He had originally wanted to get rid of
it, but he hadn’t expected that the phoenix flame used in
conjunction with the phoenix feather would unleash such devastating
power. It was able to slice open a god’s body.</p>
<p>But right now, Han Sen didn’t have the time to sit idly by and
think through all the ramifications of what he had just done. He
continued to swing his phoenix feather with the ferocity of a
furious stormcloud. Sword lights flew everywhere, slashing here and
there across Sky Vine Radish’s god body. As Han Sen cut Sky Vine
Radish again and again, the flow of blood increased.</p>
<p>“Stop or I will bury you!” Sky Vine Radish bellowed angrily.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored the warning. He kept slashing Sky Vine Radish’s
god body without relenting. He let the god blood splatter him.</p>
<p>“This is blasphemy against god! Your sons and your grandsons and
the rest of your filthy race will be cursed now and forever! Great
disaster will fall upon you!”</p>
<p>Sky Vine Radish released an enraged roar into the sky, but over
time, it slowly turned into a scream. And still, he couldn’t move.
Han Sen continued to slash the god body like a madman.</p>
<p>Although each slash only cut a little bit into the god’s flesh,
after Han Sen slashed his enemy 1000 times, then 10000 times, he
was able to open Sky Vine Radish’s flesh to the bone. God blood
poured out.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>As Sky Vine Radish’s voice kept up an unending stream of curses
and profanity, Han Sen lost count of how many times he had slashed
the god. But before long, he was able to lop the god’s head
off.</p>
<p>That big jade head fell to the ground, creating a big crater in
the earth when it landed. The jade skull’s face was turned up
toward the sky. The eyes that had been closed were now finally
open. They glared at Han Sen right before the head shouted, “Gods
can never die! Today, you have destroyed my god body, but I will
ensure that your sons and your grandsons pay me back millions and
billions of times more. All the women in your race will become
whores, and all the men will become slaves.”</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen thrust his feather sword into the god’s eye, blinding
it. God blood sprayed up like a freshwater spring, splattering all
over Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen had nothing to be afraid of. Han Sen knew that his
family was meant to fight these gods. He would not be intimidated
by the empty threat of some ominous curse.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen how Sky Vine Radish treated the Flower Gods, so
he knew that the gods never treated the people of the universe as
equals. Gods thought of the people in this universe as little more
than livestock. They would kill and eat the people that Han Sen
knew for nutrition.</p>
<p>“If gods can eat people, then why can’t people eat gods? Today,
I, Han Sen, will be the first person to dine on the flesh of a
god.” Han Sen licked the god blood around his lips. It felt as hot
as boiling water.</p>
<p>“Deified Gene +1… God Body Evolution +1…”</p>
<p>“Just one drop of blood can raise my tally by one whole deified
gene… No wonder you are considered a god.” Han Sen looked at his
fallen enemy with disdain. He didn’t stop moving his sword. He kept
slashing the corpse over and over. Every slash parted flesh and
broke bones.</p>
<p>There was a reason that these gods were creatures of legend.
Even with a heavily damaged body, it was still so strong. Its
strength was difficult to comprehend. Han Sen had decapitated the
creature and perforated its heart, but he still couldn’t kill
it.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you can still live if I wholly dismember your
god body.” Han Sen continued to hack his way through the creature’s
flesh. He made sure to consume the blood that sprayed him.</p>
<p>It was like he was swallowing lava into his belly. Han Sen felt
as if his entire body was on fire. It was so hot, he wanted to take
off his skin just to cool down a little.</p>
<p>“Deified Gene +1… Deified Gene +1…”</p>
<p>The announcements kept adding up. A single drop of god blood
granted a deified gene. The body of a god could bring an
unimaginable bounty of wealth to someone like Han Sen.</p>
<p>“God evolution 100%… can evolve…”</p>
<p>Finally, Han Sen heard the announcement that he had been waiting
for. But he didn’t have the time to evolve right now. He was
determined to kill Sky Vine Radish and do it soon. He couldn’t give
the monster any chance to reassemble itself and regain its fighting
strength.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen had been cutting his way through Sky Vine Radish’s giant
skeleton, but his blade had come up against a bone that it couldn’t
cut through. The other bones had snapped with relative ease, but he
couldn’t even leave a mark on this one.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, and he leaned closer to the bone to get a
better look. Han Sen didn’t understand much about how these god
bodies worked, but it was clear that this bone didn’t resemble any
of the structures in a human body.</p>
<p>The bone snaked its way around the heart and lungs like a
crooked vine. It was green, and it was only two meters long. A bone
like that, in a giant god body like Sky Vine Radish’s, was truly
tiny. Interestingly, the bone was shaped differently than the rest
of the god’s skeleton, as well.</p>
<p>Although most of the bones looked like they were made of a green
stone, this one was rather transparent. Inside that bone, it looked
like there were strange symbols floating. The bone seemed like
something out of a dream, some mysterious item that could exist
only in Han Sen’s imagination.</p>
<p>“Let’s make a deal. If you stop this, I can help you conquer the
universe…” Sky Vine Radish’s voice quivered with something that
resembled fear.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen acted as if he hadn’t heard Sky Vine Radish. He slashed
at the bone that connected the giant’s heart and lungs, and it was
sliced open.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Sky Vine Radish screamed like his heart was being ripped
out and his lungs torn open. He hadn’t even moaned when his head
was cut off, but now, he was squealing like a pig.</p>
<p>“That must have been your weak spot.” Han Sen grinned in
delight. He swung his phoenix feather at the strange bone even
faster. Every slash struck the tether between the bones, the flesh,
and the organs. He cut that tether slowly.</p>
<p>Sky Vine Radish kept screaming and cursing Han Sen, but Han Sen
remained undeterred. Han Sen might obey God, but not this sort of
god.</p>
<p>“You will die!” Sky Vine Radish suddenly screamed when he saw
that Han Sen was on the verge of slicing through the strange bone.
His god body flashed with a green light. His flesh began to glow
like superheated steel.</p>
<p>“Oh, no!” Han Sen suddenly understood what Sky Vine Radish was
doing. The god knew that he didn’t stand a chance against Han Sen,
so he was going to self-destruct.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t stop the god from self-destructing, so he
pushed himself to strike even faster with his sword. He wanted to
dig out the bone before the monster blew itself up.</p>
<p>But Sky Vine Radish’s body detonated far too quickly, and Han
Sen didn’t have enough time to cut the strange bone free. A scary
power suddenly exploded from Sky Vine Radish’s god body. It was
like a nuclear bomb going off.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At the top of the Space Garden, a green light shot into the sky
like a volcanic eruption. Once it entered the sky, it spread out
and began to shower the area. The light rain rained down across the
flower fields, and the xenogeneic plants that touched the light
rain started to grow at an accelerated rate. The whole of the Space
Garden changed. It was like the sky and the earth had been
flipped.</p>
<p>Han Sen exited his super god spirit mode, and then, he heard the
announcement play in his head.</p>
<p>“Killed God Spirit. Obtained God Spirit. Found God Spirit
Gene.”</p>
