<p>“Be my guest.” Han Sen did not move. He looked at the purple
copper sword. He wanted to see what it was going to do.</p>
<p>If it did not work, Han Sen would not just sit where he was. He
would flee. Regarding winning or losing this bet, he did not care.
He was not going to do anything even if he lost.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword did not care. It turned around. The
sword handle struck the giant hammerhead.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>When the iron hammer was hit, a shaking noise like thunder
sounded. The shaking power grew scarier. It was like a tumultuous
sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen could use the ice-jade shield to block the powerful
shaking a bit. But within that shaking, there was some sort of
power that could shake one’s soul. It ignored the defensive
properties of the ice-jade shield and invaded it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode was very strong. His soul body
was solid. The hammer’s soul-shaking was unable to do anything to
him, but the girl was not faring half as well. She coughed up some
blood, clutched her head, and started to cry.</p>
<p>“That hammer can attack a person’s soul.” Upon seeing the girl
in pain, Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword saw that Han Sen was doing fine, which
was disappointing. However, it was only a little disappointed. It
had not thought that the soul power could totally break Han Sen
anyway.</p>
<p>The girl’s painful face lined up with the expectations the
purple copper sword had already established. More than anything, it
had drawn Han Sen there to deal with the little girl.</p>
<p>Members of the soldiers and holy soldiers had a soul connection.
If the members died, the holy soldiers died too. Killing the little
girl was easier than defeating Han Sen. That was why the purple
copper sword concocted this wretched idea. It let the iron hammer’s
soul-shaking power beat the little girl. It did not matter how
strong Han Sen was. Ordinary power would not be able to shake the
soul away.</p>
<p>Even if it expected Han Sen not to get the girl outside of the
power, and he did it, it would be even easier for it to kill the
girl.</p>
<p>As the girl bled from her seven holes, the purple copper sword
struck the hammer harder. It kept hitting it while saying, “Your
body is so strong! Such powerful power does not harm you, but that
little girl does not seem to be faring too well.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for asking about her, but I am sure she is fine.” Han
Sen suddenly used his Super God Spirit mode. The jian turned into a
white color that looked like nothingness. He released a white fire
that was burning with the ice-jade shield. He blocked the
soul-shaking power and kept it outside.</p>
<p>“Are you Han Sen?” When it saw the Super God Spirit mode, the
purple copper sword immediately recognized his identity as Han Sen.
It shocked the purple copper sword.</p>
<p>“What if I am?” Han Sen was not surprised. Many people knew
him.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword was silent. The reason Asura, the
elusive Demon alpha, changed her personality and the way she spoke
was because she did not want others to know who she was. She did
not expect to meet Han Sen there.</p>
<p>Asura’s power made her very good with the Shura Sutra’s cause
powers. It was the Luo family’s Falsified-Sky Sutra. That power
could eliminate anything that touched a cause item, but it did not
work on pure spirit bodies.</p>
<p>When a spirit died, the spirit in the body would start to
reincarnate and restart its life. The karma of the last life was
reduced to zero. The soul itself did not have any cause or karma to
deal with. It was very hard to have it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode possessed spirit power. Better
yet, it was even greater than that of a spirit. Not even Asura
wanted to fight someone with Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>When this happened, Asura felt troubled. Her Shura powers could
slay God Spirits. Against Han Sen, there was no confidence in doing
the same.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the purple copper sword would do something, but
the purple copper sword ceased hitting the hammer. It did not make
any further acoustics. A while later, it said, “If I give you the
chance to become the leader of Soldier Weapon Sky, can you promise
me one thing?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised by this turnabout. He did not know what
the purple copper sword wanted of him, but he still went ahead to
ask, “Promise you what?”</p>
<p>The purple copper sword did not speak. A while later, it said,
“Never mind. Even if you did not promise me, you would have to do
it anyway.”</p>
<p>After that, it did not care if Han Sen understood or not. Its
sword had some spirit light. That spirit light went to the little
girl. The purple copper sword flew away.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not understand this. He did not understand what the
purple copper sword meant, but he had realized what had just
happened. The purple copper sword was gone.</p>
<p>The spirit light entered the girl’s body. The girl underwent
some weird changes. Her entire body became riddled with spells.</p>
<p>In that giant Soldier Weapon Sky, countless weapons moaned
together. It was like they were welcoming a leader. Even the scary
hammer joined in.</p>
<p>At the same time, the geno tablet started to glow. A line of new
words appeared.</p>
<p>First Sky Leader: Soldier Holy Spirit</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a sky full of weapon air go to the girl. It
surrounded her and went into her body. Her flesh turned into
armor.</p>
<p>As one had a closer look at the armor, one could see it was made
by many mini weapons. The girl’s presence was stronger.</p>
<p>When the girl’s body evolved, Han Sen had some power feedback.
That power had all kinds of weapon will. It made Han Sen suddenly
feel as if he had learned all kinds of weapons’ most primitive will
and skills.</p>
<p>“Is there this kind of benefit?” Han Sen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>To Han Sen, this knowledge was not all that useful. He already
knew how to use many different types of weapons. He had just been
given a little bit more knowledge on top of what he already knew.
He just knew about more weapon types.</p>
<p>There was a benefit. Han Sen’s body was cleansed by all sorts of
weapon air. It did not help boost his Break World rate, but it made
his body stronger.</p>
<p>In the 33 skies, a light shone on the girl. She had finished
evolving and was sucked inside the light.</p>
<p>Han Sen was the holy weapon. He should have been teleported too,
but his relationship with the little girl was special.</p>
<p>The girl could not blend his mark into her soul, but he was able
to blend her soul mark completely.</p>
<p>Thus, the geno tablet did not believe Han Sen was the girl’s
holy soldier.</p>
