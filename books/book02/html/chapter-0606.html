<p>Queen felt as angry as she did awkward, having no idea what Han Sen was doing. But when she looked down at the afflicted area, she noticed the wound was starting to fade away as the silver fox licked her. She stared at the creature in bewilderment.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the silver fox, but his eyes subconsciously moved to look elsewhere. He noticed Queen was breathing quite rapidly and her chest was beating hard. The jiggling almost caused Han Sen to lose all composure.</p>

<p>Queen was surprised to see the silver fox possess this ability. For a brief moment, she forgot all about Han Sen being near her. When she heard wretched panting to her side, she looked over, shocked, to see Han Sen unabashedly staring at her breasts.</p>

<p>Her face turned red and she moved her hands to cover her exposed chest. But with the silver fox on top of her, and the size of the breasts themselves, she couldn&#8217;t hold them. All she could do was yell, &#8220;Are you still looking?!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221; Han Sen used his hands to shield his eyes.</p>

<p>Queen almost fainted in embarrassment. Although Han Sen put his hands in front of his eyes, he made sure to keep taking peeks through the quick shuffling of his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn around!&#8221; Queen said angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, fine.&#8221; Han Sen reluctantly turned around, feeling envious of the silver fox. While he was forced to look away, the silver fox was being allowed to freely enjoy the delight every man desired.</p>

<p>After that, the silver fox jumped back to Han Sen. But he didn&#8217;t hear Queen say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I turn around yet?&#8221; he eventually asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a beast soul armor.&#8221; Her voice was cold once more â€“ a sign she had mostly returned to normal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Han Sen turned around to look at Queen and froze.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, turning the ocean into a beautiful vat of molten, glittering gold. Queen, in all her elegant beauty, was sitting before the scene naked, with her arms wrapped around her busty chest. Her round shoulders, sexy bones, slim waist and bendy legs; in the light of the setting sun, she could have been mistaken for a mermaid queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still looking.&#8221; Queen hissed these two words between clenched teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eyes were built to watch things of beauty; I cannot ignore their desires.&#8221; Han Sen slumped his shoulders while he spoke.</p>

<p>He pulled back his gaze, brought out his blood-scale armor, and gave it to Queen.</p>

<p>She donned it immediately, and the armor concealed her voluptuous chest. Although you could make out slender curves, the overall sight was less arousing. Still, she had a beautiful face. It was the face of an elegant goddess, one who no man could touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You looked better earlier. Now you look too cold,&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think saving me grants you a free pass. I still want to kill you, and if you say another word about my body, I&#8217;ll cut you down right this second.&#8221; Queen directed a furious gaze towards Han Sen. If eyes could kill, he would have been diced into pieces already.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine. I will stop.&#8221; Han Sen closed his eyes but started to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t think about it, either,&#8221; Queen added. The smile Han Sen was giving her was unbearably smug, making her believe he was memorizing something he had no right to.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I cannot do that. This mind is my own, but I cannot fully control which fond neurological pastures it desires to revel in.&#8221; Han Sen opened his eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>Queen gritted her teeth and said nothing more. She did look mad, though.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you look better when you&#8217;re mad; you look quite feminine,&#8221; Han Sen told her.</p>

<p>Queen thought she must have done something truly awful in her past life to have become acquainted with Han Sen in this one. Han Sen tore the clothes from her body when they last met, and he had pretty much done so again. It seemed as if all her most embarrassing moments kept occurring with Han Sen.</p>

<p>Eventually, Queen calmed her mood and became cool again. She resolved to try not to be so short-tempered, lest something even more embarrassing happen.</p>

<p>After all, Han Sen had saved her. And she&#8217;d feel terrible if she did something bad to him.</p>

<p>But whenever she opened her eyes and saw Han Sen, she got incredibly angry and her temper rose again. So, she turned around and decide to gaze at the sea instead of Han Sen. She asked, &#8220;Where are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. My primary concern was shaking the White Tiger, so I took a number of twists and turns. I don&#8217;t even know which direction the island is in, anymore.&#8221; Han Sen blinked.</p>

<p>Queen furrowed her eyebrows and said, &#8220;Leave your silver fox here. We&#8217;ll come back, but for now, we need to go get some food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need. I can handle it.&#8221; Han Sen placed the silver fox on the back of the whale and then jumped into the water solo. A while later he returned, carrying a fish that was two feet long.</p>

<p>He skinned and deboned it. Then, he cut the meat into thin slices and picked one up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8230;&#8221; Queen thought Han Sen was giving it to her. Before she could reject him, however, she noticed Han Sen was instead feeding it to the silver fox. She quickly closed her mouth and blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you want some? I can give you some.&#8221; Han Sen heard her half-sentence, so he picked up another slice and brought it to her. &#8220;Come on, open your mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Queen felt as if she was going to explode, as more and more blood pumped to her face. She clenched her jaw hard and didn&#8217;t say anything. She then moved to sit behind Han Sen. Without looking at him, she grabbed a slice of fish by herself.</p>

<p>Han Sen slouched his shoulders and placed the fish he was holding into his mouth. He held the silver fox and sat in front of Queen. He and the fox happily shared their portion, dividing it evenly between them. When it came to the last slice, he picked it up and started to put it in his mouth. But before he could take it all, the silver fox jumped onto his arm and bit the other half of the fish.</p>

<p>Neither of them wished to let go, which annoyed Queen. In her heart, she asked herself, &#8220;What sort of person in their right mind, would fight for food with their pet?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Queen felt like something was wrong. The lips of the silver fox and Han Sen were connected, but the silver fox had just licked her most beautiful trophies earlier.</p>

<p>Queen&#8217;s cold face suddenly turned all red. She turned around and went to the head of the whale and looked out at the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I do to upset her this time?&#8221; Han Sen was surprised because he was just playing with the silver fox. He had no idea why she was so mad again.</p>

<p>By now, they had both acknowledged that they were lost. The whale had been swimming for half a day, with no sign of land.</p>
