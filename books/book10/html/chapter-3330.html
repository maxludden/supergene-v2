<p>“That’s a very powerful body…” Han Sen was very happy.</p>
<p>It was not as if Han Sen had found a way to analyze the sheep’s
body. It was just that because the body was so perfect, the Break
World rate was probably 95%.</p>
<p>No matter how high the Break World rate was, it did not concern
Han Sen. Even if he could see how amazing the body of something
was, he could not get anything good out of it.</p>
<p>The sheep’s statue possessed pure jade power. From the structure
of its body and jade power, Han Sen was able to get a lot of
information out of it.</p>
<p>“If I take a look at the sheep jade’s power structure, it must
improve my Jadeskin,” Han Sen thought. He secretly ran his Jadeskin
power.</p>
<p>In the past, he had absorbed the white jade building’s jade air
to practice his Jadeskin. Those two powers were not the same, but
there was a certain jade element.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not completely copy the sheep jade’s elemental
structure power. He used a special spot.</p>
<p>The body and power of a Break World creature were combined as
one. To research its body meant to research its power. The Dongxuan
Sutra could not analyze it in time. He could only analyze one
segment of its amazingness. At the same time, he used the
Blood-Pulse Sutra to invade the sheep jade’s beautiful body and
understand more about it.</p>
<p>Originally, this would be a trying task for Han Sen. Now, this
was benefitting him. Han Sen did not want to give up. He revived
the sheep but peeping into its power was Han Sen’s true
purpose.</p>
<p>The sheep’s body was nearly perfect. Han Sen’s progress was so
slow. Even if things were like that, he had a lot to gain.</p>
<p>“This body’s Break World rate is higher than I thought. It is so
close to a hundred. There is just a 1% to 20% difference. This one
jade fairy leader is quite scary. If White King and the others have
a similar level, this sort of power is something I cannot even
comprehend. It can certainly compete with the God Chaos Party. Who
was this fairy person who was able to create such scary creatures?
What sort of power did it have that it could seal away White Jade
Jing?” Han Sen’s mind was riddled with questions.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Jadeskin was holy and pure. The purity was no worse
than the sheep, but the sheep’s body had a special structure. The
structure of the sheep’s jade body’s mass, strength, and other
features were similar to Han Sen’s jade body. Yet, it was tougher
than Jadeskin.</p>
<p>Considering this amazing structure’s existence, if the two of
them were to do the same attack, the sheep jade body’s attack would
be stronger than his.</p>
<p>Han Sen was amazed by this discovery. He kept analyzing the
sheep’s jade body. He wanted to break the secrets inside of it. If
Jadeskin could use this structure, the Break World rate would
increase. He perhaps had a chance to surpass a 30% Break World
rate. That would mean his Break World power was solid. It might
even lead to him achieving a higher Break World rate.</p>
<p>After all, this was a nearly perfect Break World body. It was
very similar to Jadeskin. It was also very rare.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept analyzing it again and again, but he was unable to
find the answers he sought. He could not break the structure of the
sheep’s body. He could not learn the secrets hidden within its
structures.</p>
<p>Blood-Pulse Sutra kept sinking in, but its effects on it were
not very good. After two hours, the Blood-Pulse Sutra had only
managed to leave behind a red dot that was smaller than a hole left
by a needle. That was what was left on the body of the jade sheep
statue. One would have needed a pair of binoculars to see it
clearly.</p>
<p>That little red dot still made Han Sen go crazy. With the
combination of the Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra, it still
enabled his Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power to sink in.</p>
<p>Even if it was only a tiny amount, it was enough for Han Sen to
learn some secrets about the jade body of the sheep statue. The
sheep statue’s jade body structure was not solid. It was empty on
the inside.</p>
<p>“A hollow structure?” Han Sen was happy. He did not care how
much power this was costing him. He let power go inside him. The
hollow structure could increase strength, but that was no longer
necessary. The jade sheep’s body secrets were not just there.</p>
<p>Han Sen was quickly able to learn that the sheep’s jade body was
not hollow. It resisted the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power. Han Sen
tried his best to sink it in.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen not making any huge progress, Bottle Fairy
frowned and asked, “Mister White King, can you see him?”</p>
<p>White King coldly said, “It is good if it works. If it doesn’t,
after his power is spent, it will be easy to capture him. Even if
he cannot recover the white sheep fairy, he can help the jade fairy
get a body and a will. It will be helpful for the White Jade
Jing.</p>
<p>“Mister, you are so smart.” Bottle Fairy understood what White
King was thinking. It did not matter if Han Sen could recover the
white sheep fairy or not. Either way, it would only be good for
them. Nothing bad would come from Han Sen helping them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Han Sen knew White King would not have been as nice
as he was watching. He never planned on spending all of his power.
He was going to save enough power to be able to escape from White
Jade Jing.</p>
<p>The jade sheep’s secrets made Han Sen change his mind about
things. Even if his power was spent, he still wanted to peek at its
secrets. If he missed out on this chance, he did not know if he
would ever have another.</p>
<p>An almost perfect Break World body creature was just sitting
there, letting him research it. Such an opportunity was extremely
rare.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen could kill a high-class Break World creature, it
would be pointless. The power of a dead Break World beast would be
gone. It would have not been worth doing any research.</p>
<p>At Han Sen’s level, even just a thought would require that a
high price be paid. So, Han Sen did not want to risk researching
the body.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Dongxuan Sutra had combined. A little
amount of power sank in. It sank in so slowly, but every little bit
was a reward. It shocked Han Sen every time.</p>
<p>“It was not just the structure that was hollow.” Han Sen noticed
the jade sheep’s body was not just hollow. There were many changes
in the hollow structure.</p>
<p>There was a hexagon structure that was like a beehive. There
were also triangular structures. Many hollow structures were
combining. Because the sheep’s jade body was like it was dead and
not moving, it was hard to find out what those structures did.</p>
