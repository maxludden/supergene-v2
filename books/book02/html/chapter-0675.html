<p>&#8220;You really killed a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary?&#8221; Ji Yanran asked, with her mouth wide-open in shock as she looked at Han Sen. Even though Han Sen had explained the details of what transpired, she found it difficult to believe. So, she had to ask the question again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I killed it, didn&#8217;t I? That means I killed it. Is it really that difficult for you to believe?&#8221; Han Sen sat on Ji Yanran&#8217;s office chair, holding her as she sat on his lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you die if you don&#8217;t bluff me?&#8221; Ji Yanran jested, as she looked at Han Sen&#8217;s boisterous and cocky face. She couldn&#8217;t help but squeeze his waist in response.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did the family say?&#8221; Han Sen smiled and asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dad told me to ask if you really did kill a super creature. He asked if you received the beast soul and Life Geno essence, and whether or not you&#8217;d be willing to sell them,&#8221; Ji Yanran explained to Han Sen, without dilly-dallying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I killed it, yes. But I didn&#8217;t receive the beast soul. I did get the Life Geno essence, however. If you need it, I will give it to you.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>Han Sen understood Ji Yanran, so that was why he said that.</p>

<p>Ji Yanran loved what he had just said, and replied, &#8220;That was my dad&#8217;s idea. If you need it, you should keep it for yourself. You earned it. So, don&#8217;t worry; there is no pressure for you to give it up. And if you do end up selling it, please consider selling it to the Ji family first. After all, I am your girlfriend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me some more time to research this stubborn thing first. If I am still unable to consume it, I&#8217;ll allow my wife to handle it,&#8221; Han Sen said, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is your wife?&#8221; Ji Yanran rolled her eyes, but she was super pleased on the inside.</p>

<p>Han Sen was in a rush, trying to find a way he could consume the Life Geno essence. If he still couldn&#8217;t find a way, he wouldn&#8217;t mind giving one away for the Ji family to research. After all, the Ji family was powerful and far-reaching. There was a high chance they might find the solution, and it&#8217;d make Ji Yanran happy.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew that Ji Yanran had never complained about his status during their time together, but he knew that she had received a lot of pressure from her family regarding her choice to be with him.</p>

<p>The Life Geno essence could earn Ji Yanran a lot of relief from her family.</p>

<p>Of course, giving her the Life Geno essence was the worst-case scenario. Han Sen wanted to eat it, first and foremost. And if he was able to eat it, he wouldn&#8217;t have to sell it to the Ji family.</p>

<p>Han Sen had a few theories of his own regarding the nature of the Life Geno essences. He could not, however, prove them.</p>

<p>If people could not eat the essence from the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, that meant the Life Geno essences were the same between both shelters. For absorption, they&#8217;d need a special method.</p>

<p>But Han Sen had eaten the Life Geno essence without trouble in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Now that he thought back to his time there, the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary was different than the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary in a number of ways.</p>

<p>The first Life Geno essence he ate was not obtained through hunting. It was because the Golden Growler spat the Life Geno essence to the baby Golden Growler, and Han Sen had stolen it.</p>

<p>Ever since then, Han Sen had been able to absorb super geno points by slaying super creatures. It was only now that Han Sen realized that might have been the reason.</p>

<p>Aside from that, Han Sen could not remember any other differences between now and the time he was in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Everything he had in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, he had now but even better. The only difference was his inability to consume the Life Geno essences.</p>

<p>Han Sen could only theorize that the reason he could absorb Life Geno essences in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary was the Golden Growler.</p>

<p>But thinking of things this way, Han Sen could only hope that his predictions weren&#8217;t true. There was no way he&#8217;d be able to find another super creature willing to spit out another Life Geno essence for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be a way to absorb a Life Geno essence, but whatever it is, I just haven&#8217;t found it yet,&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

<p>After returning to his room, Han Sen replied to a few messages his friends had sent him. He told them about his success in slaying a super creature.</p>

<p>Humans were getting better and better in this world. It was only a matter of time before someone else succeeded in the task of killing a super creature, especially in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. It was likely more and more would be killed there. Han Sen did not think there was a point in keeping it a secret anymore.</p>

<p>But Han Sen knew that killing a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary was a deed that no one aside from him would be able to accomplish for a long time to come.</p>

<p>The super creatures in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary were frighteningly powerful. No one could kill a super creature unless it was severely injured beforehand, without first having fully maxed out their super geno points in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>If others wanted to kill a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, they would have to wait until someone had maxed out their super geno points in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Since the people in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary couldn&#8217;t consume Life Geno essences, no one would be able to max out their super geno points before coming to the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. No progress could be made with the current state of things.</p>

<p>Right now, Han Sen was the anomaly. He was the only one who could make progress. Only he could hunt super creatures in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary and exclusively obtain the resources such beasts would provide.</p>

<p>But Han Sen was worried that if the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary&#8217;s super creatures were so difficult to kill, then the creatures of the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary and Fourth God&#8217;s Sanctuary would be unfathomably cruel.</p>

<p>The Alliance forbade any news from the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary and Fourth God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Very seldom would news about them be released, and most of those articles were useless and devoid of any concrete information.</p>

<p>Han Sen could enter the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary with maxed out super geno points, but after that, would his ability to slay super creatures solo remain? He wasn&#8217;t so sure.</p>

<p>Without maxed out super geno points as a base statistic going into the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, humans were weak there. If they did not max out super geno points in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, Han Sen was uncertain whether humans would stand a chance in the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Just existing in the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary as a faceless minority, without the talents to excel or make any progress, would be ridiculously hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use thinking about it now. I cannot even absorb the Life Geno essence.&#8221; Han Sen openly mocked himself.</p>

<p>He was talking to everyone he knew, telling them each about his conundrum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy smokes, as you say. You really killed a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary?!&#8221; After Teng Zhenliu heard it from the horse&#8217;s mouth, he couldn&#8217;t help but yell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong.&#8221; Yi Dongmu replied with only a single word.</p>

<p>&#8220;God! You are the strongest person in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, without a doubt!&#8221; Zhu Ting exaggerated.</p>

<br>

<hr />

<br>

<p>Everyone&#8217;s reaction was different, but most were driven by simple shock. Zhu Ting told Han Sen that people from the Chen family had come looking for him. They told Zhu Ting to continue being friendly with Han Sen, to see whether or not he himself might one day be on Han Sen&#8217;s team like Wang Yuhang and Li Xing Lun.</p>

<p>The Chen family also told Zhu Ting that they wouldn&#8217;t be pursuing the matters concerning Chen Ran. They hoped if Han Sen was one day willing to sell the Life Geno essences he collected, he would consider selling one to the Chen family.</p>

<p>Zhu Ting was really worried, given his precarious situation. He didn&#8217;t expect things to turn out this way, and the amicable turn of events made him quite excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;He really killed a super creature?&#8221; After Lei Hengwu heard the news, he was shocked. It pained him to believe Han Sen and Wang Yuhang managed to do it, and that really annoyed him.</p>
