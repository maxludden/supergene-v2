    <p>
      Proposing was not something that came easy to Han Sen. Killing a super
      creature was easier for him, because he at least had some experience with
      that, as opposed to marital duties and responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Proposal.&#8221; Han Sen searched the word on the Skynet, and the
      term generated billions of results.
    </p>

    <p>
      All these different methods of doing so made him go cross-eyed. There were
      so many different ways, all great and romantic in their own way; but the
      sheer amount made it impossible for him to decide.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a time, anyway. Soon, he found one that suited him just fine. He
      ordered a ring, and while he waited for it to be delivered, he got around
      to formulating his plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next day, Han Sen visited Ji Yanran&#8217;s office. &#8220;Baby, would
      you like to have dinner with me tonight? It&#8217;s my treat; I&#8217;ll
      cook,&#8221; he asked, while blinking his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure!&#8221; Ji Yanran answered, while she worked. She didn&#8217;t
      know her true desire had been sold out by Annie, so she didn&#8217;t
      suspect anything too strange.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used to have dinner with her frequently. Having dinner in the
      base&#8217;s cafeteria was hardly private and romantic, so they often went
      to their own rooms. As such, they had dinner in their rooms together a
      lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come sooner; I will be waiting for you,&#8221; Han Sen said, having
      heard her reply. He then went back to his room and put his plan in motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s plan was simple. He was going to bake a few cakes and put
      the ring in one of them. When Ji Yanran found the ring in the cake, he
      could propose to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a simple but charming method. He was still in the base, after all,
      and he didn&#8217;t want to cause a big fuss or scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      He prepared the kitchen table in the evening, and just as he was putting
      in his final touches, she arrived. As usual, she waited on the couch until
      Han Sen finished making dinner.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have baked a few cakes; you should try them.&#8221; Han Sen
      brought forward a few cakes that had already been made. To enhance their
      appearance, Han Sen had shaped them with unique molds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cakes were shapes like animals, flowers, and hearts. He brought the
      cakes in front of Ji Yanran, with the ring hidden in the heart one.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the tray he presented her, Han Sen had nudged the heart cake closest to
      her. He thought it would be easier for her to reach.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is so cute! I never thought you could make something like
      this,&#8221; Ji Yanran said to him with an upbeat tone, as she picked up
      the rabbit-shaped cake with a happy face.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There are many things I can do and make that you are not yet aware
      of. You will know of these in the future, I am sure.&#8221; Han Sen
      didn&#8217;t mind her incorrect choice. He knew she enjoyed her desserts,
      and because of their relatively small size, he knew Ji Yanran would end up
      eating a few more.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221; Ji Yanran licked her fingers after
      eating the cake, showing that she really enjoyed it. Then, she reached her
      hand out and selected another cake.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This turtle looks so cute, as well!&#8221; Ji Yanran picked her
      second cake, and it wasn&#8217;t the heart again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; Han Sen agreed, as the joy and anticipation in
      his heart fell back a notch.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you standing around watching me for? Shouldn&#8217;t you
      be in the kitchen, finishing off dinner?&#8221; Ji Yanran gave Han Sen a
      strange look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for you to review each of my cakes.&#8221; Han
      Sen softly smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They are sweet and soft; you should make a few more in the
      future,&#8221; Ji Yanran said, after having a bite.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;And?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s it. Now go make dinner. Once we&#8217;re done, I still
      need to go back to work,&#8221; Ji Yanran said, with a tone that suggested
      a bit of hurry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not want to spoil the hidden ring, since he wanted it to be a
      surprise. Quietly, he returned to the kitchen with disappointment in his
      heart. To himself, he said, &#8220;I really am inexperienced. Why would I
      create so many cakes for her? I should have only made two!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      It was too late for him to regret it right now, however. Standing in the
      kitchen, he activated his gene lock to watch Ji Yanran. If she discovered
      the ring, he could run over there at once and pop the question.
    </p>

    <p>
      After eating the second cake, Ji Yanran reached for another one. As was
      stated previously, she really did love desserts—even if they didn&#8217;t
      follow dinner. The cakes only took two bites to finish, too. And it was
      easy for people to eat a few at a time, especially her.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this time, Ji Yanran did not pick one of her own choice. She had
      started reading a book, and she let her hand reach out for one.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Heart&#8230; heart&#8230; heart&#8230; get the heart&#8230;
      no!&#8221; Han Sen prayed harder than he ever had, as sweat dripped from
      his forehead in anticipation. He tried willing her to go for the heart,
      but she ended up selecting the flower.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Ji Yanran finished that cake, her hungry hands slithered around the
      tray for more. He clenched his fist, foregoing a desire to pray. This
      time, he wanted to truly bend the will of her mind to his own.
    </p>

    <p>But Ji Yanran did not choose the heart again.</p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen punched the sink as his heart started to tear in two. He thought,
      &#8220;The odds are all wrong. How can she not have chosen it yet?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you doing in there?&#8221; Ji Yanran asked, after hearing
      a noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nothing. Continue to eat, my love!&#8221; After covering his slip
      of the fist, he was doubtful that things were going to turn out the way he
      envisioned. There were eight cakes in total, and if she didn&#8217;t
      choose the right one soon, she&#8217;d be full before she could try them
      all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to slap himself silly. He questioned the decision that led
      to him making eight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I need to learn from my mistakes and do better next time.&#8221;
      Han Sen changed his mind, opting to not do a proposal next time. If this
      happened again, things could only get worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was so nervous in the kitchen, watching Ji Yanran finishing her
      current cake. He had yet to come up with a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      After she gobbled it up, Han Sen suddenly thought of a way. He quickly ran
      out and picked up the heart cake in front of her.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen had no other choice. This was what he had to do.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t! I&#8217;m so full! If I eat any more, I won&#8217;t
      be able to fit in my dinner!&#8221; Ji Yanran pleaded, as she rubbed her
      tummy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt doomed hearing this. His entire body froze stiff in front of
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Please. Eat another one.&#8221; Han Sen brought the heart cake in
      front of her mouth and told her, with a pitiable look.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran, seeing Han Sen&#8217;s face, would have felt bad rejecting it.
      She accepted the heart cake and had a tiny nibble.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Eat it! Eat it!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was calling to the
      high-heavens. He stared at her lips like he had a fever. The moment her
      teeth discovered the ring, he would drop down on his knees and propose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran really had eaten too much, though. And all she had was a
      rabbit-like nibble. She gnawed at the cake slowly, and it looked like it
      would take a while for her to reach the ring.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen was growing impatient, and so he gulped his saliva.</p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran noticed Han Sen&#8217;s intense stare at her lips, and even the
      little swallows she made. Her face went red, thinking he was hungry
      himself. Not for food, but for sex. It had been a long time since they
      last did it, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had been busily working in recent times, and not spent much time with
      Han Sen. Suddenly, Ji Yanran grabbed Han Sen by the neck and started
      kissing him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen, unsure what was going on. Seeing that the ring was
      close to being discovered, and having the situation suddenly turn to this
      was confusing.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Ji Yanran was on fire. Her hands wriggled their way into his pants and
      grabbed his rex spike.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mmm&#8230;&#8221; It had been so long since Han Sen touched a
      woman. He wanted to push Ji Yanran away so she could finish the proposal,
      but he couldn&#8217;t bring himself to do it.
    </p>

    <p>Quickly, they both rolled onto the couch together.</p>

    <p>
      It was like a hurricane, or a strong tide. When things calmed down, Han
      Sen was holding Ji Yanran&#8217;s body as they lay together on the couch.
      Ji Yanran was lying down atop Han Sen&#8217;s naked body, with sweat
      running down her body. She was like a lazy cat, not wanting to move.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s mind finally returned to the heart cake. He grabbed it and
      took the ring out of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran saw Han Sen take the ring out of the cake and looked at him in
      disbelief, with wide-open eyes. She wasn&#8217;t sure what expression she
      was supposed to have, but all she could display was a mixture of
      overwhelming joy and utter speechless shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      His plan had been ruined, so Han Sen just took the ring and placed it on
      her finger. Loudly, he proclaimed, &#8220;Ji Yanran, marry me! I want to
      have sex with you for the rest of my life.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Pang! Ouch!</p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran was so mad, she kicked Han Sen off the couch. The fall almost
      broke his buttocks.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;You go to hell!&#8221;</p>
