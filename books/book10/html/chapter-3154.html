	<p>Qin Bai looked frightened. He kept stuttering, unsure of what to say.</p>

	<p>Han Sen said, “Mister Crown Prince has been practicing sword skills here.”</p>

	<p>“I am addressing the crown prince. Since when were you permitted to talk to me?” Jia Shi Zhen looked into Han
		Sen’s eyes with flickering rage.</p>

	<p>The way Han Sen spoke was like he was lying without blinking. It enabled Jia Shi Zhen to confirm that he was a
		dog without any boundaries.</p>

	<p>The match of chess was only halfway done. There was no time to put it away. Thus, to still tell her Qin Bai was
		practicing sword skills was ridiculous. No one would have believed his words, let alone Jia Shi Zhen.</p>

	<p>“Teacher, I really was practicing sword skills.” Jia Shi Zhen did not believe him, so Qin Bai felt as if he was
		been wronged. He had suffered so much there, but Jia Shi Zhen believed he had done nothing but play around. He
		felt awfully wronged.</p>

	<p>Seeing Qin Bai lie without blinking, Jia Shi Zhen’s frown tightened.</p>

	<p>In the past, Qin Bai had always been naughty, but that was fine because he never lied and always admitted to what
		he had done.</p>

	<p>Now, Qin Bai’s behavior had obviously worsened. It was likely affected by Han Sen, who was a dog.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen was not a dumb fool who had no brain. She did not want to immediately expose Qin Bai. She coldly
		asked, “How did you practice? Did you run into trouble?” Qin Bai wasn’t too sure. He looked at Han Sen. He had
		been tortured for two days, yet he had not held a sword once. He had not combined with the nine-wave fish
		either. That did not really fill him with courage.</p>

	<p>Han Sen nodded at him. To learn a sword skill, the most important thing was understanding. Skills and other
		things were not really important. Bai Qin had been tortured for two days by Bao’er’s simulation of the Wavy
		Sword Mind. No matter how dumb he was, he should have at least learned something. Qin Bai was not actually dumb.
		He was just very playful.</p>

	<p>Qin Bai still looked frightened and desperate for help. Han Sen coughed and said, “The crown prince has only been
		practicing sword skills for the past two days. He has not practiced combining with the nine-wave fish. Why don’t
		you test the crown prince’s sword skills first?”</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen did not stop Han Sen this time. She coldly laughed. “This is ridiculous! If there was no combining
		with the nine-wave fish, he could not feel the water element power and wave power. Without those two feelings,
		the Wavy Sword Skill cannot work. What in the world has he been practicing?”</p>

	<p>The skills of the universe of kingdoms had to be used when combined with a gene race. Otherwise, a skill was just
		an empty shell. Jia Shi Zhen was not inclined to hear Han Sen’s nonsense.</p>

	<p>She did not object. She told Qin Bai, “If you have practiced a sword skill, then show me how you practiced it.”
	</p>

	<p>Qin Bai’s heart did not really have any power in it. He looked at Han Sen, but Han Sen just gave him a sword. He
		winked at Qin Bai to make sure he could perform the Wavy Sword Skill.</p>

	<p>Qin Bai gnashed his teeth. He accepted the sword and walked into the field. He was going to perform Wavy Sword
		Skill.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen did not say a word. She watched Qin Bai’s performance. She was not going to be surprised if Qin Bai
		performed it terribly. She wanted to use this as an opportunity to keep him away from bad people and encourage
		staying in the company of good people.</p>

	<p>That was especially true of evil influencers like this dog, Han Sen. It was best for everyone involved if they
		stopped staying in contact with each other.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen had even composed a speech and thought deeply about how it could prove educational for Qin Bai.</p>

	<p>Qin Bai was not hopeless when it came to sword skills. After all, he had followed a few teachers for many years.
		He was not very good, but he could use ordinary sword skills.</p>

	<p>The Wavy Sword Skill was something he had not practiced much, but he knew what it looked like.</p>

	<p>He was now performing it. The skill was not done smoothly, so everyone could tell that he had not spent time
		practicing it.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen looked as if she had expected this result. She was not surprised. She coldly looked at Han Sen. She
		saw that he was behaving very chill. It was as if Qin Bai’s terrible performance had nothing to do with him. She
		thought the guy had to be incredibly shameless.</p>

	<p>If the crown prince was not allowed to play freely, he could have been spending the time practicing. On top of
		all this, it did not appear that Han Sen felt guilty.</p>

	<p>“People with an attitude like that must stop having contact with the crown prince,” Jia Shi Zhen thought.</p>

	<p>Seeing Qin Bai looking clumsily performing the Wavy Sword Skill, Jia Shi Zhen could not bear to watch him much
		longer. If she did not want Qin Bai to be embarrassed, she would have already stopped him.</p>

	<p>The formation of the sword skill Qin Bai performed a little later started to surprise Jia Shi Zhen.</p>

	<p>When he first started, Qin Bai was too nervous. He had no idea what he was practicing and was freaking out. After
		trying it out a few times, it was unknown why, but he had started to think about the sword mind performed by
		Bao’er. It was the one that shocked the sky.</p>

	<p>It was like reading 300 poems from the Teng Era. Even if one did not write them down, one could still remember
		them. Qin Bai could not completely understand the will of the sword mind, but he had been hurt by it. Now, he
		was performing it. It was kind of close. The more he did it, the smoother it went.</p>

	<p>Plus, Qin Bai was the sort of person to treat a dead horse as a living horse. He just kept performing.</p>

	<p>In the beginning, Jia Shi Zhen did not see the real thing. As Qin Bai started to perform more, that changed.
		Although his sword skills did not look experienced, within the sword skills, there were elements of the sword
		mind of Wavy Sword Skill.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen could not believe it. Things like sword wills were very rare in the universe of kingdoms because it
		drew on power from the outside. Not many people were able to practice like that, so ordinary gene casters went
		for powers that combined. They did not pay attention to the mind very much. Only some powerful elites would turn
		their focus to the mind when they reached the zenith of their body’s capabilities.</p>

	<p>At Bai Qin’s age, he was not interested in studying. Even if he was, there was no way he could learn the mind.
	</p>

	<p>Now, Qin Bai’s sword skill featured the mind. Jia Shi Zhen was shocked. She was unable to believe what she was
		witnessing.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen had to double-check it more than a few times. She eventually realized that she was correct. There
		was a sword mind at work in Qin Bai’s sword skill. The wavy mind had to be correct.</p>

	<p>Qin Bai kept displaying the sword skill and showing it to Jia Shi Zhen. He was that Jia Shi Zhen looked
		surprised. He felt really happy about it.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen had trained him for a few years, but he had never seen Jia Shi Zhen look like this. She used to be
		very mean to him. She was always harsh and treated him like wood that could not be carved.</p>

	<p>This was the first time Jia Shi Zhen had looked at him this way. His confidence was given a major boost. He felt
		as if he had just eaten a life fruit. He felt as his body was surging with energy.</p>

	<p>Qin Bai was scared of Jia Shi Zhen. He was nervous, but the nervousness seemed to suddenly vanish. His sword
		skills seemed smoother. The Wavy Sword Skill’s mind was becoming more prominent.</p>

	<p>Jia Shi Zhen was becoming more shocked. She could not figure out how Qin Bai’s sword skills had developed a sword
		mind.</p>
