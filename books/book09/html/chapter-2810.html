<p>“Can I go with you to the Real Old System?” Han Sen asked. “I
want to help out the Extreme King too.”</p>
<p>“If you want to go, you need to ask Second Uncle,” Bao Ying
said. “He is in charge this time.”</p>
<p>“OK. Take me to see Second Uncle.” Han Sen did not know if he
would actually be allowed to leave the Extreme King, but he wanted
to use this opportunity to test the boundaries and length of Bai
King’s leash on him. In addition to that, he wanted to know who was
pretending to be him. He had killed an Extreme King deified.</p>
<p>Han Sen had wanted to do that a long time ago, but he had never
received the chance.</p>
<p>Bao Ying did not deny Han Sen’s request. She took Han Sen to see
Second Uncle.</p>
<p>Second Uncle did not decline Han Sen’s request to join them. He
just said he needed Bai King’s blessing to make the decision and
ensure he was allowed to go with them. So, he had Han Sen wait for
the news.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not think Bai King would let him leave.
Surprisingly, not long after, Second Uncle returned with Bao Ying
to notify Han Sen that he should go and get himself ready. They
were all going to the Real Old System that night.</p>
<p>Han Sen really did not understand what Bai King was thinking.
Bai King is willing to let me leave the Extreme King! What if I
leave and never come back? He would lose everything.</p>
<p>If Bai King was willing to let him out, Han Sen did not mind
being given the chance to go and see someplace new. That same
night, he followed Bao Ying to the gathering where the others had
assembled.</p>
<p>Out of the people who were going, Second Uncle was the
strongest. Han Sen only knew that Second Uncle’s power was
almighty. He wagered that he might have been a butterfly elite, but
that was just a rumor.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power had yet to recover, so he could not make an
accurate judgment.</p>
<p>There was also Bao Ying, Bao Qin, Meng Lie, and another four
outsider deifieds among them. This time, the Extreme King was
sending out a task force comprised of eight deified elites. It
looked like they meant business, and they really wanted to take Han
Sen.</p>
<p>The deified would never have thought that the Han Sen they were
venturing out to kill was already secretly among them.</p>
<p>On the way, Second Uncle and the others made no effort to watch
Han Sen or keep him on a leash. Han Sen was certain that if he
decided to leave, escaping would not be difficult.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, This asshole Holy Pirate is not trustable. He
said he would steal me back, but I haven’t seen him make one move
to help me. Fortunately, I did not depend on his rescue.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others traveled to the Real Old System. Once
they were there, they realized the place was in a proper mess. The
xenogeneic space’s door had been blown open. Inside, there were
signs of a battle. Many of the planets were affected. That fight
had to have been a nasty one.</p>
<p>The entirety of the Real Old System was destroyed. Many of the
outsiders who reached that place were coming for Han Sen, but none
of them were able to find him.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Second Uncle, and the others were a bit late to the
party. Many of the places there were destroyed. Fortunately, there
were still members of the Extreme King around. They were stationed
there to protect the more important places.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others were there now, but the biggest
problem they faced was not how to defeat Han Sen. It was how they
were going to find Han Sen.</p>
<p>The Extreme King team Second Uncle had brought were good with
that task. They had their own tracking methods. Han Sen and the
group that he had come to the battleground with were shocked when
they saw what remained.</p>
<p>“Under the Sky Knife skills? How is that possible?” Han Sen
looked at all the knife marks across the planet and felt strange.
Without a shadow of a doubt, he was able to tell they were Under
the Sky Knife strikes.</p>
<p>And, they were not Under the Sky Knife skills from Sky Palace.
They were the Under the Sky Knife skills Han Sen had personally
modified.</p>
<p>It is no wonder everyone believes it was the real Han Sen. If I
was not Han Sen, I would believe it too. Who is this impersonator
that can replicate my Under the Sky Knife? Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others learned that it was Under the Sky
Knife as well. They knew for sure it was a trademark of the real
Han Sen, so they didn’t believe it was a fake Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Under the Sky Knife was very unique in the universe.
Even Sky Palace, which had the original Under the Sky Knife, was
unable to copy the Under the Sky Knife Han Sen used.</p>
<p>Second Uncle looked at a deified elite and asked, “Ger, have you
found anything?”</p>
<p>Ger had Shadow Eye powers. Although he was unable to see into
the future or past, he could piece together what might have
happened through the atmosphere. He had the ability to rebuild and
replicate the image of what had transpired. It was sort of similar
to what the Purple-Eye Butterfly could do.</p>
<p>Ger’s eyes kept flashing and cycling through different images.
He quickly started moving his body in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others followed. Everyone was following
him, which led to them leaving the Real Old System.</p>
<p>“Are we leaving already?” Bao Qin asked with a frown. “That
means our pursuit and capture of the fiend will be much
harder.”</p>
<p>“How dare he kill my Extreme King and destroy my xenogeneic
space,” Second Uncle coldly said. “Even if I must chase him to the
ends of the universe, I will kill him.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he did not go far,” Ger suddenly said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Meng Lie asked.</p>
<p>Meng Lie had been frozen by the medusa shield on his last
encounter with Han Sen. It had cost the Extreme King a lot to
restore his health. He had been resting in King’s Kingdom for most
of the time since. This was the first time he had ventured
outbound.</p>
<p>Ger said, “Han Sen left very slowly. It isn’t as if he left in a
rush. From the video I see inside me, unless he made use of Galaxy
Teleportation, I do not think he went very far from here.”</p>
<p>“I think he learned Galaxy Teleportation from the Extreme King,
but Galaxy Teleportation cannot be learned in any short period of
time,” Second Uncle quietly said. “He could not perform a big act
of Galaxy Teleportation.”</p>
<p>“It does not matter what we say now. Let us just continue the
pursuit.” Meng Lie’s eyes flashed. Last time, he had been trapped
by Han Sen in space. That had made him very upset. This time, he
joined without an invitation to fight Han Sen and exact his
revenge.</p>
<p>Ger agreed. He continued leading the way forward for everyone.
The entire group traveled through space, leaving Old Real System
behind them.</p>
<p>“Hang on.” Second Uncle’s face changed. He stopped Ger, who was
ahead of them leading the group.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Second Uncle, who looked at Ger and asked,
“Ger, are you sure Han Sen fled this way?”</p>
<p>“Although it was only for just a second, I assumed this was the
way he went,” Ger said after thinking for a moment.</p>
<p>“That is weird,” Second Uncle quietly said. “If I am noticing it
correctly, that place leads to the big barren systems.”</p>
<p>“Second Brother, did you remember it wrong? This place is so far
away from the big barren systems.” Meng Lie looked at Second Uncle
with confusion as he spoke.</p>
<p>“That is correct. When you go forward, you reach the systems of
chaos. There are many bug holes and zones of twisted space that
many battleships can often fall into by mistake. Going into one can
have you end up in the big barren systems. If we keep going, we
might end up entering the zone of the systems of chaos that is
known as the Lost Land.” Second Uncle’s words were spoken with the
utmost seriousness.</p>
<p>Meng Lie looked at Ger and asked, “Ger, are you sure Han Sen
went this way?”</p>
<p>Ger used his power to look and reconfirm it. He nodded and said,
“Right now, it seems to be the way. He went that way, but I do not
know if he entered the Lost Land. We need to go there first.”</p>
<p>“OK. We will go to Lost Land and make plans.” Second Uncle
momentarily thought about it before asking Ger to keep leading the
way.</p>
