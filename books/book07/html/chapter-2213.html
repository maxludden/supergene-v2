<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic Duke Galactic Shrimp killed.”</p>

<p>An announcement played inside Han Sen’s head, but he earned no beast soul. And after the mutant Galactic Shrimp exploded, no gene remained for the taking. That made Han Sen quite depressed.</p>

<p>“Thank you, brother!” the flaming Duke shouted at Han Sen. He then raced back towards the other knights to continue their battle against the hordes of Galactic Shrimp.</p>

<p>As Han Sen hovered in surprise, he realized what had happened. Han Sen had wanted to steal the kill, which was why he had swooped down in front of the Duke. The Ice Blue Knight misunderstood, however, and he thought Han Sen knew the Galactic Shrimp would explode. That was why the knight had thanked him for his courageous action, when Han Sen was really just attempting to kill-steal.</p>

<p>“That was just a misunderstanding.” Han Sen bore a wry smile, but no one there knew of the existence of beast souls. And as a result, no one could have guessed his motivation.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t plan on explaining it, though. He didn’t have the time to do so, even if he had wanted to. Endless hordes of Galactic Shrimp were still charging, and Han Sen was in the middle of that awful fight,</p>

<p>As Han Sen began attacking, he heard a shout from that same fiery Ice Blue Knight. “Brother, send a rocket at these ones!”</p>

<p>Han Sen saw many Duke Galactic Shrimp moving to attack the knights’ tight formation. The formation was already struggling, as many of the knights were injured.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew what the Duke meant by the call, though. Han Sen flapped his wings and cast a Break Space Flash to get closer to them, and then he fired a rocket at the Duke Galactic Shrimp.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>A mushroom cloud exploded in the midst of the seafood swarm. It wasn’t powerful enough to break the hard shells of the shrimp, but the Turtle spell did an excellent job of slowing them down to a crawl. The Ice Blue Knights felt a major sense of relief.</p>

<p>The shells of the shrimp were frustratingly hard, though. Han Sen had a difficult time dealing with the Duke Galactic Shrimp. Still, being able to cooperate with the Ice Blue Knights was a fine thing.</p>

<p>Han Sen continued firing rockets into the assaulting forces. The rockets soared into the most dangerous droves of shrimp, and they took a great deal of pressure off the knights in battle.</p>

<p>Crime was surprised by what he was witnessing, as well. Han Sen was just a Marquise, but he was proving very beneficial to their forces. It not only surprised Crime, but it made a lasting impression on him as well.</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect him to prove so useful,” Crime said.</p>

<p>Mister White smiled. “He and Lone Bamboo in Sky Palace are knife and sword masters. Although he is a Marquise, his abilities put him on the same pedestal as a Duke.”</p>

<p>Crime didn’t know Han Sen, but he had heard about Lone Bamboo. The fight between Dollar, Lone Bamboo, and Evil Eye was quite famous, and many of the Extreme Kings had watched it. Crime was one of them.</p>

<p>Crime was surprised. “He is on the same level as Lone Bamboo?”</p>

<p>Mister White laughed. “You’ve seen his performance. You tell me. Don’t you think he could rival the likes of Lone Bamboo?”</p>

<p>“He is very strong.” Crime nodded in agreement. He wasn’t very fond of Han Sen’s personality, though, and he would still give the edge to Lone Bamboo in a fight between the two.</p>

<p>Crime preferred someone who could engage their enemies in face-to-face combat. He couldn’t appreciate someone like Han Sen, who kept changing positions to unleash sneaky attacks.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t care how people viewed him, though. He moved as he saw fit, and as he went, he kept firing those rockets that were imbued with the Turtle spell.</p>

<p>Han Sen also tried to fire rockets with icy powers, but the Galactic Shrimp had a strong cold-resistance, so those rockets didn’t work out. He gave up on those for the time being.</p>

<p>The Ice Blue Knights were still fighting, and as they did, Han Sen fired his rockets. He was having a fun time.</p>

<p>As he was enjoying himself, he noticed that Night River King’s situation had changed. The Rebate had managed to cut off the Galactic Lobster’s pincers. Many of his black water wheels were slicing up the lobster’s form. It wouldn’t be long before the creature was wholly dismembered.</p>

<p>Han Sen was far away from the Galactic Lobster at this point. He wouldn’t get there in time.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly, he turned Spell into a sniper rifle and took aim at the Galactic Lobster’s spine. Then, he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>That bullet wasn’t imbued with the effects of Turtle, and neither did it carry any ice powers. It was being fired with a firm dose of Break Six Skies power. The bullet traveled right past the hordes of Galactic Shrimp to reach the Galactic Lobster.</p>

<p>Night River King was on the precipice of killing the Galactic Lobster, but then, there was a flash. The flash punched deep into the shell he had worked hard to destroy, going right through the Galactic Lobster’s head.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>The lobster looked like little more than rotten meat by this point, and it suddenly exploded. The spine broke, and the brain came splattering out.</p>

<p>Night River King was left in shock. He followed the light back along its path to its origin, and there he saw Han Sen with a sniper rifle. He was instantly furious, thinking that Han Sen was provoking him.</p>

<p>But in the middle of a battle like that, Night River King couldn’t do anything to exact revenge on Han Sen. He went towards the Galactic Lobster’s body, cut it open, and dug out the King xenogeneic gene.</p>

<p>“Xenogeneic King Galactic Lobster killed. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Galactic Lobster beast soul.”</p>

<p>The announcement, when it echoed inside Han Sen’s head, almost left him groaning in pleasure. He had managed to snag a King class beast soul. Han Sen couldn’t kill King class xenogeneics himself, especially in the midst of a dangerous battle like the one he was currently engaged in.</p>

<p>“I am the Sniper Elite that can take aim and fire a bullet into the soul.” Han Sen was feeling rather cocky about this.</p>

<p>The fight went on, and many more Galactic Shrimp were killed. Many knights were killed, too. Under the siege of the Galactic Shrimp, Ice Blue Knight King and the remaining Ice Blue Knights were eventually able to clear a path for the ships to get past and escape.</p>

<p>Han Sen had killed countless Galactic Shrimp, and the exhausting performance had cost him a lot of energy. By the time he was done, he was feeling very numb and very tired.</p>

<p>The ship that once looked like a planet was totally wrecked. There were fires everywhere, and smoke trailed off in its wake.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the blue lights all around went dim. The Galactic Shrimp began to withdraw, and the Ice Blue Knights could once more see the black, empty canvas of space.</p>

<p>Strangely, it looked as if the Galactic Shrimp had been stopped by something. They didn’t follow. They all gathered up where Han Sen had been, like a mountain. Only a few went by, but they soon flew back to that mass.</p>

<p>“We are out of their territory now!” someone shouted, and all the knights cheered.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the Ice Blue Knights were injured, and the ship was practically destroyed. This situation wasn’t good. They were in sad shape, and they had only just entered the systems of chaos. They had a while still to go before they reached the base of the Ice Blue Knights.</p>
