    <p>
      Han Sen looked at what was going on for a while and then stopped, turning
      to run directly into the butterfly swarm. He collected all the Core Lights
      from the fallen butterflies and killed a number more on his way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were good stuff, and Han Sen needed them to fast-track his four self
      geno cores to gold class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butterfly king squealed, abandoning Meowth to return its focus to Han
      Sen, but Meowth was too slow to catch up with it and snare its attention
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen called back Meowth with a de-summon, then re-summoned it, throwing
      it right back at the butterfly king that was drawing near. An explosion
      sounded right after, as Meowth was blown away by the butterfly king’s
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butterfly king re-locked onto Han Sen, wanting to attack him. With the
      Meowth trick, he was able to keep himself alive, but constantly summoning
      the pet prevented him from being able to collect all the Core Lights he
      wished to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butterfly king realized its inability to strike Han Sen now, and
      cleverly, it changed targets. It went straight for Elysian Moon, who was
      the weakest of the trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon would have been stronger than Zhuo Donglai on any other day,
      but her body had yet to fully recover from the injuries she had sustained.
      She was able to dodge the butterfly king’s first attack, but not the
      second.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen threw Meowth forward again, letting it hit the butterfly king to
      absorb the explosive damage. The shockwave was still enough to blow
      Elysian Moon ten meters away, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You guys go on ahead; I’ll deal with him,” Han Sen said to Zhuo Donglai
      and Elysian Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhuo Donglai and Elysian Moon, who was just getting up, knew they were
      useless being there. They realized they were more of a burden than an aid
      for Han Sen, and so they ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We’ll wait for you near the Geno Core Tablet. When you come after us,
      remember not to get too close!” Elysian Moon shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t worry; I’ll be there later,” Han Sen answered. He picked up Meowth
      and lobbed him at the butterfly king that was going after Elysian Moon
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the butterfly king was blocked this time, Elysian Moon and Zhuo
      Donglai were able to disappear from sight. A few butterflies followed
      after them, but they were ordinary ones and of little concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they were gone, the butterfly king released all its wrath on Han Sen
      and Han Sen alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Meowth was able to keep going as Han Sen’s meatshield. He
      wasn’t afraid or put-down by being used in the way he was. As Han Sen
      proceeded in this manner, he used his umbrella to strike down any of the
      smaller butterflies that were around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t have the time to collect the Core Lights in the Cruel
      Bottle, though. The gold Core Light was being directly absorbed by the
      umbrella instead, greatly increasing its strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen found something rather funny about it all. While the butterfly
      king was still strong, its flames seemed to have quelled a bit after the
      repeated attacks on Meowth. Although the difference was small, it was
      definitely not a mistake. The butterfly king had gotten weaker.
    </p>
    <p>After the lengthy encounter, Han Sen could feel it losing strength.</p>
    <p>
      “Maybe I will have a chance to kill the butterfly king.” Han Sen was
      rather excited about this prospect, and so he continued using Meowth as a
      distraction for the butterfly king as he went around killing the normal
      butterflies and collecting their Core Lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn’t take long for the Bulwark Umbrella to absorb one hundred Core
      Lights, and when it hit that figure, it began to break through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because self geno cores were connected to his body, and the umbrella had
      absorbed so many Core Lights, he could feel his Dongxuan Sutra becoming
      stronger. That too was going to level up soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew if his Dongxuan Sutra leveled up, his umbrella would become
      gold. But Han Sen didn’t want that, and so he suppressed his Dongxuan
      Sutra to avoid it leveling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bulwark Umbrella had only just leveled up to silver, and he had yet to
      reinforce it nine times. It would be a waste to proceed without doing
      that, and so that was why he stopped the Dongxuan Sutra from leveling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      After getting a hundred gold Core Lights, it seemed useless to get any
      more, as it wouldn’t make the umbrella stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen summoned his Crystal Core, and let it absorb the gold Core
      Lights directly. As it absorbed them, Han Sen felt his Jadeskin grow and
      mature. It would level up soon, as well: a process which Han Sen also
      suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because there were too many Firetail Butterflies, there were still a lot
      of Core Lights yet to get absorbed. But Han Sen didn’t dare to use Dollar
      or Real Blood to get them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were only bronze geno cores right now, and if they absorbed gold Core
      Lights, Han Sen thought they might level up too quickly, and he’d be
      unable to put a lid on their development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the butterfly king squealed once more. The smaller butterflies
      all started to fly away, joined shortly after by the king itself. The
      entire horde fled into the bamboo forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t willing to let it run off, though. It was a super Geno
      Battle Soul, after all, and he wouldn’t allow the chance of killing it to
      slip away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not caring for the little butterflies that were also all around, Han Sen
      went straight for the king. The butterfly king had been fighting Meowth
      for a while, and it was visibly weaker now. Han Sen used his phoenix
      techniques to catch up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meowth had become a living cannonball, and as Han Sen chased after the
      butterfly king, he would frequently lob the armored kitty at it. If the
      butterfly king dodged, it’d slow down a little and allow Han Sen the
      chance to catch up. If it didn’t dodge, it’d just be hit by Meowth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process incited the butterfly king’s rage. The giant butterfly turned
      back around and tried to kill Han Sen once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t going to fight it head-on, though. Instead, he used Meowth
      to strip away its power again, bit-by-bit. After an entire day of this,
      the butterfly king’s power had been almost completely drained. Han Sen
      delivered a single firm hit and blew it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Firetail Butterfly King’s body blew up, however, it didn’t
      reveal a Core Light that was ripe for the taking. Instead, a red light
      gathered itself into a ruby-like crystal that was solid.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen picked it up and heard an announcement.</p>
    <p>“Firetail Butterfly Geno Core obtained.”</p>
    <p>
      “It’s a geno core and not a Core Light?” Han Sen was shocked, as this was
      unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen observed the geno core’s information and was swiftly confused.
    </p>
    <p>Firetail Butterfly: Super Geno Core (Missing)</p>
    <p>
      “What does missing mean?” Han Sen frowned. Geno cores were either
      destroyed or damaged; he had never seen or heard about missing ones
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangest thing about this was that Han Sen could not use the Firetail
      Butterfly geno core, either. He had no idea why.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn’t have time to investigate it right now, though. He returned to
      the plan and went looking for Elysian Moon and Zhuo Donglai.
    </p>
    <p>
      After half a day of travel, he was unable to find them. Han Sen thought he
      might have strayed too far off the track while he was fighting the
      Butterfly King. Perhaps he was going in the same direction, just via a
      different path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no idea where the Firetail Butterflies had all gone, either. He had
      seen no more after the last fight. Three days later, Han Sen heard a noise
      coming from someplace deep within the bamboo forest. It sounded like
      music.
