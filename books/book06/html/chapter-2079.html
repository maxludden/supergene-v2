<h3>Chapter 2079</h3>

<p>“Oh no! Run!” Han Sen screamed. He called for Little Angel,
Zero, and Han Meng’er to fly away from the plaza and the metal
monsters that had been unleashed.</p>
<p>Han Sen swept his Dongxuan Aura over them. Their presence felt
murderous, like creatures that only sought destruction. They were
very negative beings.</p>
<p>The weakest presence he could detect amongst the metal monsters
was Earl class. But many of them were so powerful, it shocked even
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Meng’er and the others weren’t slow. They might have only
been Earls, but their speed rivaled a Marquise. They were still
slower than Han Sen, of course.</p>
<p>“What are these creatures, that dare to drop fecal matter all
over my Narrow Moon!” Night River King seethed, as he swung the
sleeves of his garment. An odd black power rolled out of his
sleeves and headed towards the monsters. The blue metal monsters
looked as if they were about to drown in it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A blue light flashed from that group of metal monsters, and a
glowing monster emerged. It punched Night River King’s Galactic
Water, and its blue fist shattered Night River’s attack
completely.</p>
<p>“King class?” Night River King looked glum.</p>
<p>At that moment, a few more monsters appeared. They also had blue
light around their heads, and they were all King class.</p>
<p>The Dukes and the other nobles of Narrow Moon felt their faces
grow pale. Moon Wheel King was still excavating, so he was far away
from Narrow Moon. The other kings had business to attend to, so
they weren’t in Narrow Moon either.</p>
<p>Right now, only Night River King, Black Moon King, Shadow King,
and Yisha were close enough to help.</p>
<p>When the fight began, Shadow King and Yisha were quick to
arrive. Yisha swept her knife towards a roaring King class blue
metal monster.</p>
<p>The blue metal monster squealed, and it swung its blue fist at
Yisha’s incoming Teeth power.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>The blue fist light was shattered by the Teeth power. Knife air
hit the blue metal monster, sending it flying away into space. A
deep cleft was torn in the creature’s chest, but no blood was
drawn.</p>
<p>It was shocking that a creature could take Yisha’s strike and
not immediately die. She frowned and lifted her weapon to attack
again. But before she could, a blue light flashed from within the
metal group. One of the monsters appeared before her, completely
glowing with that blue light. It had its fist raised to give her a
big blue punch.</p>
<p>Yisha grunted and used Tusk. Her skill was purer than Han Sen’s
Teeth Knife. After that slash, the purple knife air was like a
demon biting into the blue fist.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The two powers collided with an explosion. The space of the
region itself cracked, and things started to get sucked towards the
fissure.</p>
<p>“Half-deified?” everyone thought in shock. The blue light
monster was fighting Yisha perfectly well, with no sign of
losing.</p>
<p>Before they could think of anything else, more blue metal
monsters poured out of the cube. This was turning into a dire
fight. The metal monsters flew up into space, seeking out other
planets. They were branching out to assault all of Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>One metal monster had targeted Han Sen. Han Meng’er summoned an
arrow and fired at it. The arrow went straight into the blue metal
monster’s eye and exploded.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The arrow blew the blue metal monster’s brain in half, but the
creature was still swinging its fist.</p>
<p>Zero and Little Angel carried a Bone Dagger and a feathery sword
respectively. They moved to intercept the blue metal monster’s
fist. They effectively blocked it, then chopped its arms off to
avoid a repeat.</p>
<p>“My friends are scary! They are only Earl class, and even so,
they can fight Marquise monsters.” Han Sen grinned, pleased with
his crew.</p>
<p>But the monster was still intent on coming, despite its broken
brain and severed arms. The blue light still swirled around its
legs.</p>
<p>Han Sen swung his Ghost Teeth Knife like mad, cutting the foe in
half. The monster still writhed around on the ground for some time
before it gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Blue Gold Demon Bug: xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
<p>The announcement played in Han Sen’s brain. At the same time,
Han Sen saw a blue crystal appear in the creature’s head. It was
around the size of an egg.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the blue crystal, but there were many Blue Gold
Demon Bugs coming. The battle was far and wide.</p>
<p>If an enemy tried to assault Narrow Moon in the traditional
fashion, they could use their defenses to repel such an invasion.
Even King class and half-deified sorts couldn’t break in from the
outside.</p>
<p>But the Blue Gold Demon Bug had come out from inside Narrow
Moon. The low level nobles could not fight the Blue Gold Demon
Bugs, and Yisha and the others were busy fighting their own
combatants. The attack was swiftly throwing the entire system of
Narrow Moon into chaos.</p>
<p>“How could this happen?” Sad Night stared around himself as if
he was watching the apocalypse. He could not believe what was
transpiring.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few minutes, many of the Rebate were
killed. Explosions rattled the place. Cries and screams erupted
from every which way.</p>
<p>Vikto! That *sshole Vikto!” Sad Night gritted his teeth. He
wanted to find Vikto, who had given him the tape, but Vikto was
nowhere to be seen. When he looked back over his shoulder, he saw a
Blue Gold Demon Bug coming for him.</p>
<p>“What do we do now?” Zero asked as they retreated.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Planet Eclipse and try to fortify the base. There
are many of these bugs, but they cannot destroy the entirety of
Narrow Moon. We just need to protect our base and wait for Moon
Wheel King to return.” Han Sen whistled, and Little Star came to
him in an instant.</p>
<p>A few people hopped onto Little Star’s back, and it used Starsea
Travel to deliver Han Sen back to Planet Eclipse.</p>
<p>Some Blue Gold Demon Bugs tried to give chase, but Little Star’s
body zipped right through them. Little Star had the ability to
phase through any form of matter.</p>
<p>There were many Blue Gold Demon Bugs, but luckily, they weren’t
as threatening after they spread out across Narrow Moon. And none
had yet come to Planet Eclipse. When Han Sen reached the base, he
called for everyone to gather arms and prepare for battle. He also
activated the base’s defense systems.</p>
<p>Little Silver and the others followed Han Sen, readying
themselves for combat.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>A Blue Gold Demon Bug broke through the atmosphere, reaching
Planet Eclipse. It did not go for the base, though. It headed for a
specific mountain that was known to be populated by
xenogeneics.</p>
