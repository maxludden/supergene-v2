	<p>The female Feather used her golden feather pendant to protect herself. She kept trying to attack Han Sen,
		unleashing swordlights continuously, her attacks forming a net over Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Both Mr. Tiger and the female Feather were Baron class, but her skills far exceeded those of Mister Tiger. It
		seemed like the geno universe had better skills, but ordinary people just didn’t get to see them.</p>

	<p>But these kinds of skills were nothing to Han Sen. When Han Sen used phoenix techniques, he had greater mobility
		than birds.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was fighting the female Feather in the air. The Feather, who should have excelled at aerial combat, was
		actually performing worse than he was.</p>

	<p>The Rhino Horn Dagger kept striking the female Feather, but it wasn’t enough to break the defenses created by the
		golden necklace. Han Sen didn’t know what they were, but the light they shone was incredibly hard. It was like a
		shield that could not be sundered.</p>

	<p>The female Feather tried to strike even harder, but she couldn’t land a hit on Han Sen. She wanted to fall back a
		greater distance so she could fire arrows, but Han Sen kept the distance between the two null.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked as cold as ice in his determination to break the defense of the feather necklace. His body was
		boiling like lava, and he was unleashing so much power. His body was monstrous, and his speed constantly
		accelerated as he swung his dagger fiercely.</p>

	<p>“If one strike doesn’t work, then ten strikes will. If ten strikes don’t work, then a hundred strikes will!” Han
		Sen’s blood was boiling, and he swung his dagger even faster.</p>

	<p>In the beginning, there was a cold light coming from his dagger. In the end, the light became a beam of
		luminescence. The lights were like chains, striking the feather necklace. The sound of impacts became an
		unbroken roar.</p>

	<p>The female Feather was spooked. She flapped her wings, wanting to fly away from Han Sen. But Han Sen flew better
		than she did. She couldn’t escape, and she looked glum.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>As Han Sen kept attacking, the feather necklace started to develop small cracks. The golden shield started to
		weaken.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s eyes went cold. The vessels in his arms were incredibly strong, and the dagger was driven against the
		golden shield again.</p>

	<p>The necklace crumbled with a loud shattering noise, and the gold shield broke like reinforced glass. The golden
		light turned to dust, and the pendant fell.</p>

	<p>The female Feather was in shock. The dagger in Han Sen’s hand was like lightning now, and it flashed right
		through her neck.</p>

	<p>The female Feather flapped her wings. She moved with the desire to evade the strike, but the attack connected as
		intended. It cut halfway through her neck.</p>

	<p>Mister Tiger froze. Han Sen was just a normal creature with geno armor. And yet, he had just managed to take down
		two Feather Barons. The sight blew his mind, and now he looked at Han Sen as if he was seeing a monster.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was still holding his dagger as he looked into the eyes of the Feather. The neck that had been cut open
		suddenly healed, as if no damage had ever been inflicted.</p>

	<p>“Feather xenogeneic?” Han Sen frowned. Feathers evolved quickly. They were a superior race that was born Noble,
		but they could still evolve in two different ways.</p>

	<p>They would either gain a geno armament, or they would become xenogeneic. The female Feather was like the Feather
		that Han Sen had managed to kill in the sanctuary. It was a xenogeneic Feather, and only they could possess
		xenogeneic genes.</p>

	<p>Still, seeing the female xenogeneic Feather, Han Sen did realize something. Not all the xenogeneics were driven
		by a simple urge to kill.</p>

	<p>The female Feather’s eyes glowed red. Her white wings turned gold, as bones extended and sprouted from her wings.
		She turned from being an angel, into a gold winged witch. She screamed and flew towards Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Perhaps it was because of the xenogeneic power, but her strength and speed increased. Han Sen didn’t dodge,
		though. His blood was pumping with rage, and he raised the dagger and aligned it with the female Feather’s head.
		The female Feather’s hand grabbed the dagger as she descended, though, and it couldn’t even cut through her
		palm.</p>

	<p>The female Feather grabbed Han Sen by his other arm. Her golden nails pierced through his geno armor. She
		stretched her gold bone wings to wrap around Han Sen.</p>

	<p>The golden bones protruded sharply from the wings, and if they closed around him completely, it’d be like a mouth
		of fangs closing on him. He’d be skewered.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s hands were grabbed by the female Feather, and it seemed too late for him to dodge. His whole body was
		indeed wrapped up by the wings.</p>

	<p>“Oh, no!” Mister Tiger knew this was bad.</p>

	<p>But the next second, he heard a katcha noise sound. It was followed by a scream.</p>

	<p>The female Feather fell backwards, screaming. Her face had been cut in half, with her golden wings entirely
		broken.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was in the air, with geno armor that was full of holes. But there was no blood seeping from the gaps. His
		white skin through the holes, and there did not seem to be any wounds.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body flew like a phoenix, going right towards the female Feather.</p>

	<p>After the female Feather used a xenogeneic gene, her eyes turned red with the desire to kill. It looked as if she
		had lost her own will and rationality.</p>

	<p>The head that had been cut open was already recovering, and her broken bones were regenerating swiftly. The
		creature screamed as it came back for Han Sen.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen wasn’t going to give her any chance this time. Han Sen used his dagger to cut her body repeatedly.
		The vessels under the geno armor were boiling, unleashing an unbelievable amount of power.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>Han Sen reached out a hand and grabbed the female Feather by her head. He chopped off her gold wings, one by one.
	</p>

	<p>The Feather tried to bite into Han Sen’s arms, but Han Sen just moved them even more violently. With his dagger,
		Han Sen lopped her head clean off.</p>

	<p>The body, minus its head, still came for Han Sen, though. And the bodiless head opened its mouth, still trying to
		bite into his arm.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s blood was surging like a volcano. It carried enough power for him to dismember the female completely,
		and finally kill her.</p>

	<p>“Xenogeneic Baron hunted; xenogeneic gene found. Gold Feather Witch xenogeneic beast soul obtained.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen heard the announcement play.</p>
