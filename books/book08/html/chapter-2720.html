<p>Her eyes brightened with interest.</p>
<p>Empty God’s lips curled up at the corners. He looked cocky as he
said, “Do you want it? Just say you want it and it is yours.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Bao’er looked surprised. She gazed at Empty God with
disbelief.</p>
<p>“Of course. As long as you say what you want, a cute little girl
like you can have anything you’ve ever dreamed of,” Empty God said
chivalrously, his voice smooth and coaxing.</p>
<p>“You’re a great guy!” Bao’er said with excitement.</p>
<p>Empty God laughed. He held the gem in front of Bao’er and
smiled. “Just say you want it, and this gem will then belong to
you.”</p>
<p>Bao’er looked longingly at the gem, and her hands slowly reached
out for the gem.</p>
<p>Empty God hid a snide smile as he thought to himself, “Female
creatures are all alike. They are just like those ugly dragons. No
matter how old they are, they love all things shiny.”</p>
<p>But Bao’er suddenly pulled her hand back. With a look of
disappointment, she said, “I actually don’t want it.”</p>
<p>“What? Why do you suddenly not want it?” Empty God asked in
surprise. He had been caught off guard when the girl changed her
mind.</p>
<p>“Mom says that I can’t take gifts from strangers.” Bao’er’s face
looked very serious when she said this, but her eyes were still
locked on the gem. It looked as if she was struggling to keep
herself from reaching out and taking it.</p>
<p>“I see,” Empty God said with a smile. “You can’t accept things
from strangers, of course. But I’m not a stranger. I’m a good
friend of your father. You can take something from me because of
that, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“You are a good friend of my father?” Bao’er asked, her eyebrows
rising.</p>
<p>“Yes. We are very, very good friends.” When Empty God said that,
the words he spoke were stressed. Each word was pronounced heavier
than the last.</p>
<p>“If you are Dad’s good friend, then we really aren’t strangers!”
Bao’er said happily.</p>
<p>“Of course we aren’t!” Empty God said with a shake of his
head.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Uncle. In that case, I’m going to take the gem.”
Bao’er reached out her hand to grab the gem in Empty God’s
hands.</p>
<p>As she reached toward it, Empty God wasn’t sure if he should let
it go or continue holding onto it. Bao’er hadn’t declared her wish
yet. If she took it now, Empty God wouldn’t receive anything in
return.</p>
<p>Empty God didn’t respond, and Bao’er stared at him with
confusion. She said, “Uncle, do you not want to give me the gem? If
that is so, then that is fine. Mom told me not to steal other
people’s items, anyway.”</p>
<p>Bao’er’s words might have been gracious, but her face was filled
with disdain. She thought Empty God was very cheap by not giving
her the gem.</p>
<p>“Ahem, ahem. You still haven’t told me whether or not you want
it,” Empty God said. He was looking a bit uncomfortable now.</p>
<p>“Uncle, this gem is obviously important to you. You should keep
it for yourself.” With those words, Bao’er lowered her hand and
turned around to leave.</p>
<p>Although she didn’t say anything more, she had a look of scorn
as she turned away. It made Empty God feel more depressed than he
had in a long time.</p>
<p>He was Empty God, but he was despised by a child.</p>
<p>“Don’t go, Bao’er! Your uncle was planning on giving you this
gem as a gift. I wasn’t in my right mind. You should take it from
me now.” Empty God didn’t really care about the gem, and giving it
to Bao’er might allow him to gain her trust. He wasn’t going to let
her run off so easily.</p>
<p>“You are really going to give it to me? Aren’t you going to miss
it?” Bao’er looked wonderingly up at Empty God.</p>
<p>“To me, this gem is just a measly rock. It is worthless compared
to the other things in my possession.” Empty God placed the gem in
Bao’er’s hands.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Uncle. You are a good guy.” Bao’er held the gem and
smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you like it.” Empty God smiled, but on the inside, he
was thinking, “I was worried you wouldn’t take it. Now that you’ve
fallen into the habit of taking things that I offer, this should be
easy.”</p>
<p>Bao’er really liked the gem. She focused her attention on it
carefully as she played with it.</p>
<p>Empty God reached into his pocket and brought out another gem
that was even bigger and prettier than the first. He said, “Bao’er,
do you not think this gem is even prettier? Would you like it?”</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at the gem in Empty God’s hand. It was as large as
a man’s fist. She blinked at the sight of it and said, “It is way
too big. I’d feel rather snobby if I had it. I like this one
more.”</p>
<p>After that, Bao’er went back to playing with the gem in her
hands, completely ignoring Empty God.</p>
<p>Empty God felt depressed. He had assumed that offering a bigger
and prettier gem would get Bao’er to put blind faith in him.
Instead, however, the gem had led to his abandonment.</p>
<p>“It looks like using gems to attract Bao’er will no longer
work.” Empty God rolled his eyes and came up with something
new.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, look at this.” Empty God stepped over to Bao’er and
pulled out something to show her.</p>
<p>Bao’er was sitting atop the Star Fruit, but she raised her head
to take a look. Empty God was holding an old bronze mirror. The
mirror was only ten centimeters long, and it looked very
delicate.</p>
<p>The front was smooth and glossy. On the back of the mirror,
lines spread from the center of the mirror to its edges, like a
sundial or a compass. Strange symbols were etched in each space
between the lines.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Bao’er asked Empty God with curiosity. The man
was holding the mysterious mirror out so that she could see it.</p>
<p>“This is the Star Gauge Mirror. It is a true god-class treasure.
This device will allow you to see the past and the future,” Empty
God said, lavishing praises on the old mirror he was now
presenting. Although he was embellishing what it was capable of,
the mirror really was quite special. Empty God had wanted the
mirror badly, and it had taken him a lot of time and effort to get
his hands on it.</p>
<p>Empty God and King Jun called themselves God, but they couldn’t
make something out of nothing. Everything that they could use or
control already existed in the universe in some form. They couldn’t
just magically conjure up any item they wanted.</p>
<p>That Star Gauge Mirror was a precious treasure that had come
from a true god elite who had lived a billion years ago. Empty God
had struggled to lure that true god elite for hundreds of years
before the elite fell into his trap. The elite made a wish, and
Empty God stole the elite’s lifespan. He also gained control of the
Star Gauge Mirror.</p>
<p>Empty God was very proud of what he had accomplished. There had
been another God that was also trying to trick the true god, but he
had failed. Empty God had claimed the victory and the treasure. So,
even though the mirror might have been useless, he still carried it
around with him. Now, it presented a perfect opportunity to trick
Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Is the mirror really that powerful?” Bao’er asked in
disbelief.</p>
<p>“Of course, it is. Just watch it,” Empty God said. His hands
pressed against the Star Gauge Mirror, manipulating the symbols on
the back.</p>
<p>A flickering light appeared on the surface of the old mirror.
After a while, the light resolved into a slightly unsteady image,
like a show playing on an old TV.</p>
<p>The Star Tree stood in the center of the image. There were a
bunch of Star Beetles swarming over the tree like an ocean wave.
Han Sen was fighting those Star Beetles.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, Bao’er realized that it was an image of
Han Sen participating in the test at the Star Tree.</p>
