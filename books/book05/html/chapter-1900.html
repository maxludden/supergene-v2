<p>“Qing Li, what are you talking about?” Du Lishe asked from her
seat next to Qing Li.</p>
<p>“I think Han Sen wrote better than No Flower did,” Qing Li
answered.</p>
<p>When other members of Moon Garden heard this, they thought she
meant something about his handwriting being prettier. One of the
members scoffed, “Qing Li, No Flower’s Touching Flower Finger is
something that ascends mere prettiness. There’s a meaning inside it
that is far more important. The shape of the characters is
secondary.”</p>
<p>Qing Li answered this by saying, “I was referring to the
meaning. I think the meaning of the Buddha’s text was lacking
compared to Han Sen’s.”</p>
<p>They all heard what she said, but no one believed her. That was,
aside from Black Steel. Black Steel was the only one there who knew
Han Sen possessed such a frightening knifemind.</p>
<p>Rebecca looked at Qing Li and said, “Qing Li, when did you see
Han Sen write? And what did his words mean?”</p>
<p>“It was a few days ago. The words he wrote meant Teeth Knife’s
Knife Mind,” Qing Li said.</p>
<p>Rebecca shook her head. “I don’t think so. How long has he been
practicing Teeth Knife? He is just a Baron. He cannot generate any
sort of significant knifemind. Even if he was able to, it couldn’t
be half as good as No Flower’s Touching Flower Finger. That is
something only one of the King class can generate. And Han Sen is
no Buddha, either. How can you believe a Baron has a knifemind like
that?”</p>
<p>“Your thought process is right, but I’m telling you; Han Sen’s
writing abilities are better than No Flower’s.” Qing Li was weak.
She could only feel it instinctually, but she was still sure it was
true.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Gu Qincheng were observing No Flower’s writing, at
the time. Gu Qingcheng was shocked, and she said, “That monk is not
bad.”</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng actually meant exactly what she said; rather than
being amazing, No Flower’s talent was simply not bad.</p>
<p>The creatures in the sanctuary were far weaker than those in the
geno universe, but that was just a factor of base strength. When it
came to the actual workings of combat, and the finesse of it all,
those that had made it through the sanctuary were far superior to
those in the geno universe.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng’s sword skills were the best to be found in the
sanctuary. Her swordmind was among the greatest there, too. Despite
that, her raw power was weak in comparison to others found in the
geno universe. That being said, her knowledge of sword skills and
swordminds exceeded what a King class in the geno universe would
know.</p>
<p>Most beings from the sanctuary were this way, too. There were a
few exceptions to that rule, like Wang Yuhang, though. He didn’t
really have all that much knowledge when it came to fighting, but
even so, he was better than most Viscounts and Earls.</p>
<p>“Not bad? You sure sound cocky. If No Flower is only not bad,
then do you care to enlighten us as to what can be defined as
good?” said the cow-headed man next to them.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng did not want to talk to a cow, so she ignored
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw No Flower and was shocked.</p>
<p>When he had looked at Unlimited Sutra, he felt the Buddha’s geno
art was quite strange. Since he had seen the raw text, he could
understand why this was so weird.</p>
<p>Buddha King and No Flower’s powers were not the same, but Han
Sen felt they were similar. It reminded him of a scary guy.</p>
<p>Han Sen poked his head into his Sea of Soul. There was a tower
in there, and it still had the word destiny scrawled across it. He
put his will inside Destiny’s Tower, and there, Han Sen saw Armored
Man and Ancient Devil. They were still both incarcerated there.</p>
<p>Since Ancient Devil had been locked up, Armored Man had been
fixated on the concept of skinning him alive. But with them both
locked up, he couldn’t lay a finger on Ancient Devil. So, all he
had done was shout at the spirit, all day, every day.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil had been locked up for a long time, but he didn’t
pay too much attention to his cellmate. He meditated all day like a
monk, not caring for the constant shouting in his ears.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Han Sen had frequently watched Ancient Devil,
but that man meditated like he had been frozen. He never moved an
inch, and so Han Sen lost interest.</p>
<p>Now that he could see No Flower’s performance, he knew why it
felt so strange to him. It was because the Buddha gave Han Sen the
same feeling he got when he observed Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>“Does Ancient Devil have Buddha genes?” Han Sen guessed.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil seemed to sense something, as well. He opened his
eyes and looked right at Han Sen. After being imprisoned for so
many years, his eyes were still sparkling with clarity. They hadn’t
gotten dusty.</p>
<p>If you stared at him for a while, you’d feel as if his eyes were
bottomless wells. Looking him in the eyes was like peering into an
abyss.</p>
<p>“What would you like to know?” Ancient Devil suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, and thought to himself, “This guy has been
locked in Destiny’s Tower, and he could sense I was watching him.
What a scary man!”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on avoiding the question. He used his will
to echo answers throughout the chambers of the tower. He said,
“Ancient Devil, do you know about the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ancient Devil answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt even weirder now, and that was because Ancient
Devil had just leveled up to the Alliance when he was trapped
inside the tower. There was no way he had ventured to the geno
universe before then and learned about the Buddha that way.</p>
<p>“What do you know about the Buddha?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil smiled and said, “I once summoned a god. And the
god said he was a Buddha.”</p>
<p>This shocked Han Sen. If Ancient Devil had summoned a Buddha,
that also meant that Asura had been the one to kill a Buddha.</p>
<p>But Buddhas were in the geno universe, and it couldn’t have been
possible for it to be summoned to the sanctuaries. It made no
sense. The Buddha could most certainly not enter a sanctuary.
Especially since it was summoned to a sanctuary below the Alliance
level.</p>
<p>“I am talking about the race, not the religion,” Han Sen said,
hoping he’d get a confirmation.</p>
<p>“Bald with nine moles? Like scars? This is what you mean?”
Ancient Devil said simply.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen knew that Ancient Devil did indeed know of the
existence of the Buddhas. Whether they were real or fake, Ancient
Devil knew about them.</p>
<p>“How did you summon that god to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary?” Han
Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You want to know? Give me back my freedom and I’ll tell you
everything.” Ancient Devil seemed his usual self. He didn’t exhibit
any personality changes.</p>
<p>“You don’t have what it takes to bargain with me,” Han Sen
coldly said.</p>
<p>“There is no need for this discussion to continue, if my freedom
is not up for debate.” Ancient Devil closed his eyes and returned
to that frozen state.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt pretty bad. He had used death threats and torture
techniques in the past, but using them on Ancient Devil was
pointless. Even when the spirit was tortured, he would simply
continue meditating.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil must have had the strongest will there was. Not
even Kings of the geno universe could compare to him.</p>
