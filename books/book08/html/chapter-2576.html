<h2>Escaping the Fortress</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2576</h3>

<p>Han Sen still wanted to conduct trades and collect more geno
arts, but after one fruit meal, Li Keer was no longer
interested.</p>
<p>Han Sen still didn’t have time to learn Dragon Blood
Evilbreaker, and he repeatedly ransacked his brain for ideas on how
to escape the fortress. Although he was trying to plan a jailbreak,
he had become quite close to the small Crocodile God. Now, the
little Crocodile God was dependent on Han Sen for survival. It had
become totally addicted to Han Sen’s wine.</p>
<p>Li Keer stared at Han Sen. She looked at Han Sen and the little
Crocodile God, who were currently lying on sunbathing chairs. While
they soaked in the rays, Li Keer had to pour them their wine.</p>
<p>They had all been captured, and yet, she was being forced to
serve Han Sen. That made her very angry.</p>
<p>“Goon!” Li Keer stared angrily at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Hey, little Crocodile God, do you want to go and see the
outside world? The outside world is better than this place. There
are many pretty girls and a whole lot more wine. You might be able
to find a pretty lady Crocodile God with nice, smooth skin. With
your strength, small Crocodile God, the ladies would be crying to
get you. You will become so famous in the outside world,” Han Sen
coaxed, trying to convince the little Crocodile God to leave the
fortress.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra wasn’t as good at reading other
creatures as the Very High Sense, but after he had been there for a
while, he was still able to understand the behavior of the little
Crocodile God. In that way, they could actually hold
conversations.</p>
<p>Under Han Sen’s influence, the little Crocodile God was slowly
becoming curious about the outside world. If the little creature
had been alone, Han Sen would already have taken him off-world.</p>
<p>But the creature was too small, and the big Crocodile God
wouldn’t let it leave. So, there was nothing Han Sen could do.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen had noticed a window of opportunity. The big
Crocodile God had to exit the fortress every few days, perhaps to
find food. During that time, the little Crocodile God was tasked
with watching over the prisoners. If they made a single move to
escape or cause trouble, the little Crocodile God could call on the
big Crocodile God to hurry back.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer had tried to escape many times, but they
were always brought back.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t try to run. He just encouraged the small
Crocodile God to leave. If he was successful in convincing it,
escape would be trivial.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God, constantly hearing Han Sen describe the
outside world, became enthralled by the idea. But it didn’t know
how far away the world that Han Sen described truly was. He was
talking about outside of the core area. He was talking about the
geno universe. It was somewhere core area creatures couldn’t get
to.</p>
<p>Of course, the small Crocodile God didn’t understand the nature
of the core area that he’d been born into. But now, he couldn’t
suppress his giddiness to leave. He was ready to get out of
there.</p>
<p>It had tried to run off before, but it hadn’t gotten too far.
This time, Han Sen was able to convince it to go all the way. And
it excitedly rumbled at Han Sen to come along with it in a daring
escape.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer were frozen, almost unable to believe Han
Sen had been able to manipulate the creature like that.</p>
<p>“Lying to a child. How cheap!” Li Keer didn’t think it was
fair.</p>
<p>“Small Crocodile God, bring those two along. Otherwise, there
will be no one to serve you. Then, no one will be able to tell how
powerful you are.” Han Sen pointed at Li Keer and Exquisite.</p>
<p>That hadn’t taken much effort. He thought he was doing them a
favor.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God made some grunting noises, then flew
into the burning sea.</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite were happy. Li Keer had just been decrying
Han Sen for tricking a child, but now she was very grateful.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God’s power wasn’t as great as the power of
the big Crocodile God. Han Sen and the other two had to stick close
to the small Crocodile God. They needed the protection of its
gravity substance chains to avoid being melted by the scary burning
sea.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long before the small Crocodile, Han Sen, and the
others were out of the cave. Han Sen and the small Crocodile God
scoped out the vicinity with care. They didn’t see the big
Crocodile God nearby, and that made them feel relieved.</p>
<p>“Go! The pearly gates of this beautiful new world are opening
for you. You will get wine, lady crocodiles, and the love and
adoration of many different races.” Han Sen saw the small Crocodile
God looking a little nervous. It was glancing back into the cave
and seemed hesitant, so he tried to influence it a bit more.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God rumbled happily. It jumped onto Han
Sen’s hand and swung its claws around. It looked very excited.</p>
<p>“He is just a child, and yet, he is so easy to trick.” Pleased
with himself, Han Sen flew up and escaped the planet.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer were quick to follow. With haste, the
three of them and the small Crocodile God left that planet of
frightening gravity.</p>
<p>They hadn’t been away from the planet for very long when the
bronze furnace joined them, whistling quietly and belching smoke.
It had waited there patiently for Han Sen, which surprised him a
lot. He thought it might have run off.</p>
<p>The bronze furnace was making a lot of noise as it came toward
them. The small Crocodile God thought it was hostile at first. In
response, the little creature swung one of its gravity substance
chains and tied up the bronze furnace. The bronze furnace was
stunned. It started to cry, believing it was going to be crushed by
an immense force of gravity.</p>
<p>“Stop, he’s one of us! He’s one of our people,” Han Sen hastily
explained to the small Crocodile God.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God let go of the bronze furnace. Due to the
fact that the small Crocodile God was still lying on Han Sen’s
head, the bronze furnace couldn’t leave and neither could it stay.
It didn’t know what it was supposed to do.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We should leave this area now.” Han Sen didn’t know
where the big Crocodile God had wandered off to. Since he didn’t
know how far away it was, they needed to keep going as far as they
could to avoid having any nasty encounters with the beast.</p>
<p>Their flight was surprisingly smooth, and the big Crocodile God
didn’t show up. They brought the small Crocodile God with them as
they teleported a few systems away. Exquisite and Li Keer used
Galaxy Teleportation. They lost track of how many systems they
traveled through, but they were fortunate enough to not encounter
the big Crocodile God for the length of their journey.</p>
<p>“We are free!” Li Keer couldn’t believe their escape had come
about so easily.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God had a lot of potential, but for the time
being, it was only a primitive deified. It couldn’t trap them as
easily as the big Crocodile God could. Li Keer and Exquisite could
teleport away whenever they wanted to.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God looked at Han Sen and made an
inquisitive noise. Its eyes scanned the area around, indicating
what it meant to say was, “Where is the wine? Where are the
people?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be hasty. We have just made it out. We still have a long
way to go.” Han Sen needed to calm the small Crocodile God. And as
he was thinking of a way to get rid of it, his heart jumped.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer also froze. They could feel something
awful coming toward them. The blood drained from their faces.</p>
<p>“Is the big Crocodile God coming?” As Han Sen suppressed the
tension in his stomach, he figured out which direction the
frightening power was coming from. A scary xenogeneic was headed
their way.</p>
<p>“What kind of xenogeneic is that?” Han Sen stared at the
creature. It wasn’t the Crocodile God. It was a big snake that
looked something like a dragon.</p>
<p>The snake was one hundred meters long, and its head was like
that of a cobra. But on its wing-like neck, there were two rows of
eyes. Each row had three bright green eyes.</p>
<p>“The deified Six-Core Snake God?” Exquisite and Li Keer
screamed. Judging from the way they were freaking out, that deified
xenogeneic had to be something special.</p>
