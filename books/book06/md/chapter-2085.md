Many Sky had gathered around a circle of elders and King class elites.

“Sixth elder, do not try to steal the new student this time. You took Fang Weinan’s last time. I get first pick of any good prospective students! I want this little girl,” the fourth elder said, seeing the sixth elder approach.

“It all depends on who is the most suitable to be her teacher. In Sky Palace, I am certainly the most talented. If this genius falls to another, it would be a grand waste. So, I do not mind working extra hard. I won’t be wasting another genius,” the sixth-seat elder coughed.

You are shameless.” The fourth elder sounded angry.

“Stop arguing! The leader is here. Let us see what he has to say about who gets care of the child,” another elder suggested.

“Leader! Tell us who should accept the child. When we last had our meeting, you said it clearly…” the fourth elder was quick to complain to the elder.

Sky Palace leader coughed and said, “I don’t know much about her yet. Why don’t I look after her, see where her true talents lie, and then come to a decision?”

The elders were shocked. They thought the leader was being obscene; he obviously wanted to take Bao’er, as well.

“Leader, this is not appropriate. You said Lone Bamboo was to be your only student, and you wouldn’t take any more.” The fourth-seat elder gritted his teeth.

The other elders followed. “Yeah! You have your only student. How can you take on more students? You will be breaking your own laws. Have you no care for the rule of law!”

They knew that if the Sky Palace leader took the girl, none of them would have a chance. So, they had to nip this plan in the bud.

“I cannot take a student, but my student does not have a student.” The Sky Palace leader smiled.

“Your student is only a Marquise. He cannot take a shit!” The fourth elder swore furiously.

The other elders were thinking that the leader was far too greedy. He wanted to use Lone Bamboo to take her for himself by proxy. He would still become her teacher, as she would be his grandstudent.

The discussion quickly became a heated argument, but no one there relented.

The holy gourd was a deified plant, and people had to be really talented to earn its approval. Since Bao’er could make ten thousand gourds move, she’d be great in whatever she practiced. If she wasn’t lazy, there was a high chance of her becoming the second Lone Bamboo. She could very well exceed him.

“Interesting.” Yu Shanxin was standing atop a jade city’s tower. As he stared at Bao’er, near the gourds, he squinted. Dream Beast stood up, too; he looked at Bao’er with profound shock.

Han Sen held Bao’er as he continued to walk forward. His hands were shaking. It felt as if the event had become too much. All the gourds had given Bao’er some holy gourd airs.

Han Sen did not know what to do, now that this had shocked the entirety of Sky Palace. He tried to think of how he could explain it to others. Fortunately, Bao’er’s genes were the same as Han Sen’s. Simply telling them she was his daughter seemed like a safe enough answer.

But Bao’er was so famous now, he didn’t think he’d ever be able to live his life with a low profile.

“Damn! What the hell is wrong with the gourd? Did that plant lose its mind!”

“Fuck! Han Sen’s geno arts are already strong, but his child is too? This is ridiculous!”

“I wonder if Han Sen still wants his woman. I’d like to make a daughter like that with him. I would even pay for it, as long as he gets me pregnant.”

“You can keep dreaming. His daughter is so talented that her mother must be the same. Maybe you’ll end up with a gourd if you make a baby with him.”

“It’s scary. All the gourds gave out air. What element does she have?”

“She must be a mythical being, with ties to all elements. She can practice whatever she wants to.”

“I don’t understand. Crystallizers are ordinary, so how can one of them bear a daughter such as that?”

Mountain. River. Galaxy. Sun. Moon. All elements were showing up, landing on Bao’er’s forehead. They made her body’s holy air stronger.

The holy gourd air wouldn’t make you strong, but it could strengthen your talents. After having holy gourd sword air, your sword talents would increase.

Thousand Feather Crane had received one, so his sword talent was greater than most of Sky Palace’s students. Now that the gourd air kept going after Bao’er, Bao’er had no clue what was going on. The others did, though, and they knew how scary this entire thing was.

There were too many holy gourd airs, and Han Sen had to stop on the vine. He had to wait for each holy gourd air to land.

He worried about whether or not Bao’er could handle so many gourd airs, but she seemed to be fine. She was even smiling, which relieved Han Sen greatly.

All those airs kept going into Bao’er’s body. And when they did, the gourds started to shine.

Han Sen had to stand on the gourd vine for four hours, waiting for all the gourd airs to be dispensed into Bao’er’s body. She was surrounded by a holy aura now, and she looked almost like a fairy.

Han Sen thought if Bao’er was to fart right now, it’d be a holy air.

“Why is it that when I walked, those gourds didn’t give me a single gourd air?” Han Sen felt depressed about this factor, but he was still very excited.

After all the gourds had given out their holy air, they all returned to looking normal. Han Sen held Bao’er and readied himself to leave and get off the Sky Road. But just as he did, Bao’er tugged Han Sen’s clothing and jumped down. She patted the gourd vine, and with her childish voice, said, “Gourd, have you seen my father here? We should share good stuff. Please give my father a gift, too.”

Sky Palace leader and the elders thought that was funny. She was lucky to receive as much as she had, but now she was asking for more to be given to Han Sen.

Although it was impossible, the thoughtfulness of the girl was admirable.

But the next second, everyone’s eyes opened wide. The gourds had stopped shining, but they brightened up again after hearing her.
