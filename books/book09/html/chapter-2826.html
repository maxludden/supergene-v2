<p>“Who are you? How do you know my name?” Wan’er looked at Han Sen
with shock. Han Sen’s face looked very different from how it
usually did. She was not able to recognize him.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen answered, God’s Knife had already released scary
blood flames. It escaped from Wan’er’s hands and flew toward Han
Sen through the air. The blood flames had already generated a blood
demon shadow. It was holding God’s Knife by its handle. It
approached Han Sen slashing and thrashing.</p>
<p>It is a super space slash that features time and space. It can
slash what exists in the past, making it a knife that no one can
block. Can I block it? Can I predict its trail a second before in
time? Han Sen was unsure, but he knew he had to try.</p>
<p>The medusa shield was instantly in Han Sen’s hand. It was
positioned before Han Sen as he moved his body. His other hand
wielded the Cold Light Sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen was planning on using Spell’s guns, but Spell was
already a part of him. She was not able to be used as a gun for Han
Sen to make use of. Plus, Cold Light Sword’s power was better than
Spell. So, Han Sen was just going to use his Cold Light Sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen carefully calculated his moving track, the sword light
from Cold Light Sword, and the medusa shield’s location of defense.
The reason was to force God’s Knife slashing where he needed him to
be.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not been able to make a prediction a second ago, but
he could use powerful formation powers to force God’s Knife to fall
into the chess game-like trap he was orchestrating. That made it
unable to calculate his location one second later.</p>
<p>Using a man’s intelligence to fight a knife that could travel
through time and space, Han Sen could not do it on a whim. But this
was the best chance he had to fight God’s Knife.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>God’s Knife landed on Han Sen’s back. It cut open his skin. The
blood came out like crystal, and the severed muscles looked like
jade.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, That’s a very powerful God’s Knife. My
xenogeneic mode is only larva class, but the body strength should
be almost like butterfly class. Yet, it can still cut open my body.
The power of God’s Knife has increased. I am afraid it might have
reached true god class.</p>
<p>The attack was within what Han Sen had predicted, so he kept on
moving. He adjusted the position and angle of his medusa shield and
Cold Light Sword.</p>
<p>“It will kill you, too. Run!” Wan’er did not recognize Han Sen.
She was just being nice enough to warn him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care. Wan’er was the crux of all Lone Bamboo’s
sorrows. If he was able to save Wan’er, then Lone Bamboo would no
longer be in such pain. If there was a chance to do that, Han Sen
was going to try.</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was slashed again, but it was not in a critical
place.</p>
<p>It looks like my judgment and calculations are still a little
sloppy. It needs to be improved while I’m here in the actual
combat. Han Sen was not shocked. Rather, he was happy. Although he
had been hit, it was not in a critical place. That meant his method
was working.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept fighting God’s Knife, but he incurred more and more
wounds. If one looked closer, one could see his wounds were getting
smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>God’s Knife kept slashing against medusa’s shield. It was unable
to strike his body. Han Sen was so happy that he almost groaned in
pleasure.</p>
<p>He blocked the God’s Knife attack a second before he did. The
super space slash’s power was like a glitchy exploit, but he still
broke it.</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>While Han Sen was excited, he was hit again. It hurt so badly
that it made him focus. He knew now was not the time to get
excited. He still couldn’t block all of the super space slashes
with perfect precision.</p>
<p>Compared to his first experience, Han Sen was becoming smoother
as he used formation. Slowly, he was able to block more God’s Knife
attacks with the medusa shield. It was harder for the enemy to use
super space slash and harm his body.</p>
<p>Wan’er started reminding Han Sen about the need to run, but she
slowly noticed Han Sen was actually able to weather this fight
against God’s Knife. She had a look of awe on her face.</p>
<p>She had never seen any creature able to fight against God’s
Knife the way he was. Seeing God’s Knife, the creatures in God’s
Farm were scared. They were paralyzed with fear and never dared try
to rebel against God’s Knife.</p>
<p>The stranger in front of them all was actually able to challenge
it, and he was able to keep going at it. He kept blocking the
attacks of God’s Knife. It was unbelievable to witness.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s entire body was buzzing with an incredible amount of
excitement. It was like facing a problem that could not be solved
and fighting for a countless amount of days in poor conditions but
still seeing it through. The ability to finish and relish in the
joy was like his whole heart was leveling up.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought God’s Knife was so powerful and super space
slash was scary. Yet, when he blocked his first strike, his mind
chilled. He was more relaxed as the fight went on, which made it
easier.</p>
<p>Before, God’s Knife created intense pressure. Now, that pressure
was gone. Han Sen was able to control super space slash easier as
time went by.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he could control the universe and all of its
rules. It was like he could do whatever he wanted to.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen put away the medusa shield and used his Cold
Light Sword to fight God’s Knife. That was all he used. He was not
defending anymore. He was going to try and go forward to
strike.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong</p>
<p>The knife and sword went against each other in the air. The
shockwaves created a lot of cracks in space. Han Sen was depending
purely on his sword to tie with the God’s Knife, which was a second
ahead. It was all about attacking now. It was not like before when
Han Sen had to block or evade.</p>
<p>So, what if you can strike a second before I can? I can block
your attacks too. Han Sen was feeling completely relaxed. He was so
chill. One could not describe how chill he was. The Cold Light
Sword was waving casually to keep fighting God’s Knife.</p>
<p>Wan’er opened her small mouth as she looked at Han Sen battling
God’s Knife in disbelief. She had never seen God’s Knife suppressed
like that. It felt like God’s Knife strength was being
minimized.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The sword light was seen in the air as God’s Knife was hit
backward. The position of the knife was a bit messed up.</p>
<p>God’s Knife really is suppressed! Now, Wan’er believed that
God’s Knife had been suppressed by that wild stranger.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Wan’er saw God’s Knife turn around and fly
into the sky, but Han Sen’s sword light hit it down and prevented
it from escaping.</p>
<p>God’s knife… It is trying to flee… Wan’er could not believe what
she was seeing. God’s Knife was trying to flee. She never thought
this could happen, but it was actually happening directly in front
of her.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed and slashed. He slashed God’s Knife and got it
to fall back. What made Han Sen frown was the fact that he did not
know what God’s Knife was made of. He had slashed God’s Knife many
times, but the strength of the perfect Cold Light Sword did not
leave any damage on it.</p>
<p>Although I have already broken super space slash, I cannot
destroy the body that controls the God’s Knife. That is not
winning. Han Sen frowned, thinking about how to destroy the God’s
Knife.</p>
