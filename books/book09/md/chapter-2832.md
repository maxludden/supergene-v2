  "Do you know why you are not able to practice it, but I can practice it?" Han Sen looked at the Very High Leader.

The Very High Leader looked at Han Sen and asked, "Why?" That was what he was wondering too.

"It is because you are not qualified enough," Han Sen casually said.

"I am not qualified enough?" When the Very High Leader heard those five words, he froze.

Ever since he was young, it did not matter if it was a family member or a senior in the family, they kept on complimenting how great he was. No one had ever dared to say he was not qualified enough. He never heard those five words said to him before.

"That is correct," Han Sen said with certainty. "It is because you are not qualified enough. That is why you cannot learn it, and I can just learn it on a whim."

Han Sen did not want to see the Very High Leader thinking he had failed his practice because he was in love, which would result in him possibly killing the woman.

Ordinary people might not do that, but Han Sen was not sure about the people of the Very High. So, he had to change the tracks for the train of thought running in the Very High Leader's head. He could not let him think that his failure was due to the butterfly lady.

Han Sen needed to make him know that he had failed due to his own abilities. If he believed that, he would have no reason to kill the butterfly lady. That meant God's trick would fail.

The Very High Leader coldly said, "Although I do not think I am some genius of the best generation, I do not permit anyone to call me bad."

"In that case, it depends on who you are competing with," Han Sen said. "If you are only competing with the dumb*sses next-door, it does not matter how good people say you are. That would just mean you are the best out of a horde of pigs."

"How do I compare to you then?" The Very High Leader raised his eyebrows.

"There are only two words to describe this: absolutely terrible." Han Sen was going to attack the Very High Leader. He wanted to make him believe that it really was all his fault.

The Very High Leader was still too young. His Very High Sense wasn't working very well at his age. Han Sen provoked him and made him want to win. The Very High Leader did not care for what Han Sen said. He looked at Han Sen and said, "You have only learned one geno art faster than me. Have you not spoken too soon?"

"It is not just a geno art. It looks like it is a geno art that you can never learn, but for me it is easy. It is a matter of talent. A geno art that might take you a year to practice would only take me a second." Han Sen looked at the Very High Leader with disdain.

"Mister, I think you are bluffing a bit too much." The Very High Leader thought Han Sen was ridiculous. He did not believe him.

"If you do not believe me, select a geno art that you think is hard to learn. You only need to show me once. There is no need to teach me. I will show you the difference between a true genius and a commoner." Han Sen spoke all of his words with powerful confidence.

The Very High Leader was completely enraged by what Han Sen told him. His face turned cold as he said, "Sure. I am keen to see just how much of a genius you are."

God watched these two people with interest but did not stop Han Sen or the others from arguing.

The Very High Leader thought for a while. He finally put out five of his fingers. A blurry rainbow-colored ball of light was in his hand. He looked at Han Sen and said, "This is a geno art called Seven Light. It is a beginner geno art. Do I need to teach you that?"

"No." Han Sen looked at the blurry ball of light and cast his Dongxuan Sutra. Countless universal cogwheels spun around in Han Sen's eyeballs.

"It really is just a beginner geno art," Han Sen said with a look of disdain. "It is a bit too easy. Why don't you swap it for one with greater difficulty?"

"You should learn this one first," the Very High Leader coldly said. "It won't be too late to learn the other ones later."

Although it was just a beginner geno art, Seven Light geno art was a difficult one to train with. Sometimes, even butterfly or true god class elites could not make use of it.

The Seven Light geno art was difficult because it required seven different powers that combined into one. Ordinary creatures did not have seven element powers to command. Even a true god elite who did not have many different elemental powers could not make use of Seven Light.

In the universe at large, it was rare to see a creature with more than one element at its command. Three elements were as rare as a phoenix feather or a Kirin scale. Seven element people were so rare that no one had heard about them.

The Very High had a special skill to practice Seven Light, but they did not actually carry seven elements.

"Go and change it." Han Sen randomly waved his hand, which presented a blurry rainbow-colored ball of light. It was the same as the Very High Leader's Seven Light.

The Very High Leader was shocked. He stared at Han Sen. He wanted to know if his Seven Light was a true one. Some xenogeneics that were good at playing tricks were able to perform illusions that looked fairly authentic.

Han Sen could tell what the Very High Leader was thinking. Han Sen waved his hand and cast Seven Light on the Very High Leader. The Very High Leader cast the Seven Light from his hand too.

Boom!

Two Seven Lights hit each other in the air and exploded. The rainbow halo exploded like a sun. It was so bright that no one could see momentarily. It took a while for things to go back to normal.

"It really is Seven Light." The Very High Leader looked conflicted.

He remembered that when he was small, it took him a whole week to practice Seven Light. He broke the record for the Very High, and his father even complimented him. That was a rare thing.

Now, Han Sen had only seen it once. He did not have to read a book, study, or toil over learning it. He could not believe it.

Maybe he had already learned Seven Light before. That was what the Very High Leader wanted to believe. He said to Han Sen, "If you think Seven Light is too easy, then allow me to present something even harder."

"That was what I was trying to tell you earlier." Han Sen smiled at him.

It did not really matter what geno art the Very High Leader presented to Han Sen. As long as one was displayed, Han Sen could analyze and simulate it with his Dongxuan Sutra.

The Very High Leader was primitive class, but Han Sen was larva class. Simulating his skills was far easier. Although it was not 100 percent accurate, reaching 80 or 90 percent was expected each time.

The Very High Leader thought, "These two people are very weird. I do not know where these xenogeneics came from, but it looks like they know a lot about the Very High. If I use a Very High geno art, he might have learned it before."

Suddenly, the Very High Leader's eyes turned bright. He looked at the butterfly lady and said, "Butterfly Lady, please show him your butterfly shadow. Let him see."

Butterfly Shadow was a geno art that only the butterfly lady knew. There were no similar geno arts in the Very High, so he did not believe Han Sen could learn it.

The butterfly lady listened to the Very High Leader. She immediately cast Butterfly Shadow and emitted a sky full of butterflies. They were like countless petals.

"Should I tell you that the butterfly lady's Butterfly Shadow... You..." Before the Very High Leader finished his sentence, Han Sen waved his hand. He also emitted a sky full of butterflies, just like the butterfly lady's Butterfly Shadow.

"How is that possible?" screamed the butterfly lady and the Very High Leader at the same time. It was hard to believe.
