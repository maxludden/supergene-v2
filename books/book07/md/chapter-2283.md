It was a big bronze bell that had covered Han Sen, Yisha, and the blood kirin. Yisha’s purple substance chain became a knife air. She waved her hand to strike the surface of the bell, but it only made a loud, tolling noise. The bell showed no sign of damage.

“What is this bell? Why was it in the white whale’s belly? Can xenogeneics make use of xenogeneic treasures?” Han Sen was shocked.

Dong!

The bronze bell landed on something, and then it stopped moving. Yisha continued to strike the bell with her knife air, but the bronze bell suddenly lifted away from them. It flew to the side, freeing them.

Yisha immediately surrounded Han Sen and the blood kirin with her power to protect them.

Based on the direction that the bell had moved after it covered them, they should have been standing inside the white whale, probably in its stomach. A deified xenogeneic’s digestion system wasn’t something an ordinary creature could hope to withstand. Even King class elites would dissolve quickly inside such a stomach.

But when Han Sen and Yisha looked around, they froze.

This was not a stomach. It was a control room of high-end technology. The tech around them equaled any that might be found in a classy battleship’s control room.

The most unbelievable thing was that everything in the control room was transparent. They could see outside of the room, and the feelings that the sight elicited were difficult to explain.

Although it looked like a whale from the exterior, it was actually governed by machinery. Every piece of the whale’s interior was made of crystal of various colors.

Humming generators, pounding pistons, and spinning every movement could be seen from where they were.

“What is this thing?” This time, Han Sen was really shocked.

The white whale had looked like a deified creature from the outside, but it was actually a technological marvel. It was hard to believe that such an amazing machine actually existed.

Yisha looked around in shock. Their eyes soon turned to a platform of that primary control room.

A man had been sitting in a chair behind the control platform. It was little more than a skeleton at this point, with a few white bones still wrapped in the clothes he had been wearing.

The man’s clothes looked like a high-tech product, not some treasure armor. Judging from the style of the silver and black clothing, it was possible to determine that the skeleton had been a man.

After bringing Han Sen and the others into the room, the bronze bell had drastically reduced its size. It was now about the size of a man’s fist, and it rested there in the main control room.

“Does this sort of technology exist anywhere else in the geno universe?” Han Sen looked at Yisha. He had no idea what race might have constructed this marvel of technology.

Yisha shook her head. “There are many technological wonders that have the destructive powers of a deified being, but not many can actually be used in combat. They take far too long to aim and fire, so they can’t be used in actual deified fights. They are mostly useful for attacking planets, since planets cannot be moved. The Meka’s bio armor is also technological in nature. They have very powerful weapons, but again, they are different from what we’re seeing here.”

Clearly, Yisha was just as clueless as Han Sen.

“This has to be another one of the Sacred Leader’s creations. Sacred achieved a lot when it came to technology,” Han Sen pondered aloud as he looked around.

Since the white whale’s master appeared to be quite dead, how could the white whale continue to move without someone at the controls? And what had prompted the behemoth to swallow them?

Yisha walked toward the skeleton. She waved her hand, and one of her purple substance chains dissolved into a purple mist. The mist flowed over the skeleton and began to poke around it. She was looking for some lead or clue they could follow.

But before Yisha’s purple air touched the skeleton, the bronze bell rose from its resting platform and covered up Yisha’s purple air at once.

“Huh. This old bronze bell defends its master automatically. Is it a piece of technology, as well?” Han Sen looked at the old bronze bell in shock.

Suddenly, Han Sen and Yisha heard a boy’s voice. “You are a technological product. Your entire family is a technological product.”

“Who is that?” Han Sen and Yisha were shocked. They looked around them, but neither of them could sense any presences.

There was just that sole skeleton sitting on the primary control deck. It made Han Sen and Yisha feel very uncomfortable.

“No way! Have we encountered a ghost?” Han Sen muttered as he stared at the skeleton. He used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the skeleton multiple times, but there was no lifeforce. It couldn’t have been any more dead, so there was no way that the voice was coming from it. Han Sen could only think that they must be talking to a ghost.

“You are a ghost. Your entire family is a ghost.” The little boy’s voice was heard again, and it sounded pretty mad.

This time, Han Sen and Yisha located the source of the voice. It came from the little bronze bell.

The bronze bell shook. Strange symbols glowed across it, and it opened shiny green eyes.

Below its eyes was a gap. It looked like a mouth that kept opening and closing.

Han Sen stared at the bronze bell that was shouting at him. The body of the bell seemed to be vibrating with rage.

“What is this thing?” Han Sen didn’t know how to react. He hadn’t displayed any signs of a lifeforce, so he thought it must be a xenogeneic treasure. But now that it was talking, it certainly seemed to possess all the traits and characteristics of a living creature.

“You are a thing. Your entire family is a thing.” The bronze bell was becoming even angrier. It was jumping up and down as it shouted.

“Are you an AI? If you are, it seems like you are a very cheap one. You can only say the same thing over and over,” Han Sen said, looking at the bronze bell with curiosity.

The bronze bell started to yell, “You are a…”

It trailed off halfway through its shout. If it continued, people really would believe it was an AI.

So, after its half shout, the bronze bell stopped and settled down a little. With a very cocky look, it said, “You stupid low life creature. Listen up! Your master’s name is Big King Bell, but you guys can call me either Master or Big King.”

After that, Big King Bell thought of something. It looked at Han Sen and said, “Your master is not some sort of AI.”
