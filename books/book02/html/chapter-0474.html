    <p>
      Simulating crystals were an impressive creation, which many human scholars
      called a miracle.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was impossible for a human to become a rock, let alone a gun. However,
      simulating crystals were beyond their limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      As crystals, simulating crystals could mimic the characteristics of
      different matters, which was miraculous and amazing.
    </p>

    <p>
      When turning into mechanics, the simulating crystals were like machines.
      However, when turning into creatures, they had the features of creatures.
      In addition, simulating crystals' abilities were similar to the simulated
      items.
    </p>

    <p>
      As miraculous as it was, the simulating crystal had a fatal flaw, which
      was that the stronger its target was, the stronger it would be. That meant
      if the target was not strong enough, the crystals would be weak.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, because of the material itself, the simulating crystals would
      not be too weak. If it was simulating an ant, because of the toughness of
      the crystal, it was still a thousand times stronger than an ordinary ant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, the simulating crystals became Han Sen and Ji Yanran. In fact,
      they acquired the data of their bodies by scanning them. Data could be
      imitated, but there were certain things that simulating crystals could not
      imitate, such as the martial arts they practiced and their understanding
      of those martial arts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, when Han Sen saw a large number of simulating crystals turning
      into Ji Yanran and him, he was not too appalled but became more relaxed.
      If the simulating crystals became warframes or weapons, even if they could
      dodge the attack, the crystals around them would expand under the impact
      of explosion and bury Ji Yanran and him alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, simulating crystals turned to Ji Yanran and Han Sen, and
      Han Sen knew absolutely everything about his own body. Ji Yanran was a
      weak evolver. That was why Han Sen thought it was the best consequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran, on the other hand, was scared and became pale. Just out of a
      trap, they were trapped in a bigger crisis. It would not work if they blew
      up the tunnel again. If they blew up another tunnel, they might be trapped
      here for good without any possibilities to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Protect yourself.&#8221; Han Sen pulled Ji Yanran behind his back
      and rushed out.
    </p>

    <p>Shortly, Ji Yanran stared her eyes wide, and her jaw dropped.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen threw himself at the group of red crystal humans and beheaded one
      of them with bare hands. He threw the crystal head on the face of the next
      red crystal human and smashed its chest with his knee.
    </p>

    <p>
      The entire process was so smooth and unexpected that it was wonderful to
      watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      As many as the simulating crystals were, all of them were broken up by Han
      Sen. The red crystal humans did not have any power to fight back, as if
      they were dogs in front of Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran did not believe that the rest crystal humans were too weak.
      After all, the simulating crystals imitated Han Sen and herself. Those
      looking like her notwithstanding, the ones that looked like Han Sen should
      theoretically have the same physical abilities as him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only explanation for such a huge gap in strength was that Han Sen used
      his own force very effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having the same force, different people would have different applications.
      It was the same as playing chess. Although all the players had the same
      number of pieces, an advanced player would play very differently from a
      beginner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without a doubt, the percentage of force Han Sen could tap into made him a
      super master, which was why the red crystal humans looked like him but
      could not fight back at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Ji Yanran&#8217;s background, she had seen a lot of talents,
      including quite a few surpassers. And demigods were nothing rare in her
      eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in terms of the effectiveness of using the force, Han Sen was
      definitely among the top five in evolvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, those evolvers were all celebrities and progenies in the
      Alliance, with great background and reputation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran had only seen one person with a humble background who could
      achieve this level, which was Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran was completely impressed by Han Sen&#8217;s moves and became
      very proud of both Han Sen and her choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      With her family and status, it was easy for her to choose any talented
      young man, but she chose Han Sen and did not second-guess herself even
      during the period of time when Han Sen was missing. Although her choice
      was mostly out of sentimental reasons, she was very happy with Han
      Sen&#8217;s performance. There was no lady in the world who did not wish
      her man was the best, and Ji Yanran was no exception.
    </p>

    <p>Boom boom boom!</p>

    <p>
      Broken red crystals fell all over the floor, turned into red liquid and
      evaporated. Han Sen made a solid punch each time and blew up hundreds of
      red crystal humans.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      He used Seven Kill to turn his leg into axes, kicking the head of a red
      crystal man into its guts, blowing up its entire body. Pieces of crystal
      fell on the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen.&#8221; Ji Yanran blushed out of excitement and hugged her
      man, not knowing what to say. She felt as long as she was around Han Sen,
      she had nothing to fear and nothing to worry about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought Ji Yanran was worried about him, patted her on her bouncy
      butts and smiled. &#8220;Just a few red crystal men. It&#8217;s going to
      take way more than that to hurt your husband. No worries.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran hugged him tight without speaking or letting go, burying her
      head in his chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ahem, this is not the right time. Even if you&#8217;re in the mood,
      we must find somewhere safe first.&#8221; Seeing how charming and tempting
      Ji Yanran was, Han Sen was burning up with passion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m in no mood.&#8221; Ji Yanran blushed and hit Han Sen with
      her small fist, rolling her eyes at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice to be young? You have the mood to flirt in such
      a place.&#8221; A voice sounded with the worst timing, surprising Han Sen
      and Ji Yanran. They quickly turned to look.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crystal door on the side of the hall was pushed open. Li Mingtang
      entered from outside, looking at the couple with a grin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked behind him and did not see Wang Hou. Li Mingtang was
      injured in multiple places and did not seem to be in good shape.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, you surprise me. I have only seen three people at your age
      who could use their own strength so effectively.&#8221; Li Mingtang looked
      at Han Sen with approval and continued to say, &#8220;However, this is in
      a Crystallizer royalty ruin. So, from now on, you have to follow my
      lead.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;And why is that?&#8221; Han Sen stared at Li Mingtang coldly and
      said.
