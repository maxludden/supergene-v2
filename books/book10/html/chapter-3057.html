<h2>Ancient Version of the Story of Genes</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3057</h3>

<p>This The Story of Genes was different from The Story of Genes
with which Han Sen had practiced. The language of this The Story of
Genes was far clearer. There were not many details. At the same
time, it was quite deep. It was just like Han Sen reading the
Dongxuan Sutra in the past. One needed more profound knowledge of
old languages to understand it on a greater level.</p>
<p>If he had not already practiced with The Story of Genes, he
probably would not have understood what the text on the wall
meant.</p>
<p>To speak clearly, The Story of Genes here was a version written
in an ancient text. In the past, Han Sen had practiced with a
version written in modern text.</p>
<p>Although the descriptions were different, the content was
similar and did not have many differences.</p>
<p>“Weird. Wasn’t The Story of Genes created by Qin Xiu and Han
Yufei? Wasn’t it composed by those two together? Why is there an
older version?” Han Sen thought this was very strange.</p>
<p>“Do you understand what is written up there?” Ghost Kill
asked.</p>
<p>“I can guess that it is some kind of weird skill,” Han Sen
replied.</p>
<p>Ghost Kill shook her head. “Most of this text is written in the
common language of the universe, but the grammar is very old. It
can probably be traced back to the Original Star Era.”</p>
<p>“What is the Original Star Era?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Ghost Kill looked at Han Sen strangely. “You don’t know about
the Original Star Era?”</p>
<p>“I am not interested in history,” Han Sen flippantly said.</p>
<p>Ghost Kill did not say anything. She tried to explain. “The
Blood-Pulses of the seven kingdoms of the universe all came from
the same planet. That planet was called the Original Star. Thus,
that is why the era was dubbed the Original Star Era. Original Star
was destroyed a long time ago. I do not know how many billions of
years ago it was.”</p>
<p>Looking at the text on the wall, Ghost Kill went on to say, “I
have seen some information about the Original Star Era. The text
used here is similar to the text of that era.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was silent a moment before asking, “Are you saying this
is a leftover from that era?”</p>
<p>Ghost Kill shook her head. “It shouldn’t be. The Original Star
Era did not even have space travel. If so, how could things from
that era come to another planet and be here on Ancient Big God
Mountain? Maybe the text is from the Original Star Era, but someone
copied it down here.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know who the master of this place is. Why did he make a
stone temple in this place?” Ghost Kill looked at the dead
body.</p>
<p>The two of them investigated the stone palace. There was nothing
important to find. There were only the body and the stone stove
they hadn’t searched yet.</p>
<p>“If you are interested, why don’t you examine it?” Han Sen asked
with a laugh.</p>
<p>He wanted to know who the master of the stone palace was. He
wanted to know far more than Ghost Kill did, but he made sure to
not show it.</p>
<p>“I would like to.” Ghost Kill did not delay. She bent over and
went to check the body.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a purple light flashed. It was like a demon attacking
Ghost Kill’s back. That purple shadow was too fast. Neither Han Sen
nor Ghost Kill was able to react.</p>
<p>Ghost Kill did not even have the time to turn around. Although
Han Sen reacted, his body was limited by that world. The faster he
moved, the more pressure he felt. There was not enough time to
rescue her.</p>
<p>Han Sen still saw it clearly. The purple shadow was the
purple-haired monkey. The purple light of its body was spreading.
It was like a purple light shadow. It went behind Ghost Kill to tie
her up as it did to Ou Yang Qiu Shan. It latched onto Ghost Kill’s
back ready to dig into her head with its mouth.</p>
<p>That chomp made Ghost Kill’s body turn into black smoke. The
purple monkey did not bite anything, and the black smoke moved
away. Then, it turned back into Ghost Kill’s body.</p>
<p>The purple-haired monkey made the noise of a baby crying. It
turned into a purple shadow and ran at Ghost Kill again. The two of
them fought. It was hard to tell who was going to win and who was
going to lose.</p>
<p>Han Sen realized that Ghost Kill’s power was greater than what
Ou Yang Qiu Shan had possessed. She exceeded him in battle
experience and ability. She was far above Ou Yang Qiu Shan. The
purple-haired monkey had a weird and incredible power, but it was
unable to hurt her.</p>
<p>Ghost Kill could not do anything to harm the purple-haired
monkey either. The two of them fought across the stone palace. They
both seemed worried about something. Even the purple-haired monkey
controlled its power to avoid damaging anything in the stone
hall.</p>
<p>Seeing Ghost Kill not being too pressured, Han Sen walked over
to the body. He put his hand on the armor and began to rummage
around in the high hopes of finding something.</p>
<p>The purple-haired monkey saw Han Sen touch the dead body, and it
screamed weirdly. It ignored Ghost Kill, bared its fangs, and
launched itself at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept rummaging through the armor of the dead body while
his other hand kept swinging the metal pillar. Who would have known
that the purple-haired monkey would be wrapped around the metal
pillar headed for Han Sen like a snake?</p>
<p>Han Sen found something, but he did not have the time to take a
look at what it was. He pocketed it and quickly fell back.</p>
<p>In this world, it was like Han Sen was always walking through
waist-high water. The resistances against him were too much. No
matter how fast he went, he could never go faster. Although he was
already running fast, he still ended up being scratched by the
purple-haired monkey.</p>
<p>The clothes he wore were torn open, but the purple light of the
sharp claws did not dig into his skin. Only a few red marks were
drawn across his skin.</p>
<p>Ghost Kill was shocked. Her eyes flashed twice. She flew over
and detached the purple-haired monkey.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not fast, so it was hard for him to participate in
this battle. He retreated a little. He looked at the item he had
collected from the body’s pocket.</p>
<p>It was a leather notebook. The whole notebook was wrought in
leather, but the pages were not made of paper.</p>
<p>Han Sen flipped it open and saw the text was of the common
language of the universe, but the grammar was very old like The
Story of Genes on the wall.</p>
<p>Han Sen read a few lines and found it very difficult to
understand. He was only able to read the simple parts of the
book.</p>
<p>“This person is an important officer from the Qin Kingdom who
took a request from King Qin to find a skill that could enable
immortality.” Han Sen only understood one part of it. It was what
he thought it was. That guy was a subordinate of Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>Most of the text was too difficult for Han Sen to understand. It
said something like what he had found something in Ancient Big God
Mountain. Regarding the details, he had to understand it all to
understand.</p>
<p>With the situation being what it was, Han Sen did not have the
time or space to study it. He put the notebook back in his pocket
and observed the current battle. He was ready to get rid of that
purple-haired monkey with Ghost Kill.</p>
<p>It seemed to realize the crisis it faced, so the purple-haired
monkey weirdly squealed. Its purple hair went straight like a
raging fire. A scary purple fire suddenly wrapped up its body.
Inside the purple flames, its body became transparent crystal like
a ghost. At the same time, a weird presence came out of its
body.</p>
<p>Ghost Kill lost her voice as she screamed, “It really is a blood
ghost spirit…”</p>
