    <p>
      Inside the waiting area, Han Sen looked relaxed. Dong Lin had calculated
      their strategy very well, and their pangolin was indeed a very strong
      creature. Their only mistake was picking the wrong opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they had discussed business formally, Han Sen would not have opposed
      the idea of putting on a show in their favor, to boost the sales and
      renown of their new pet pill product. With money to line his own pocket in
      return, they&#8217;d have both benefitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Dong Lin was playing dirty, and they sought to manipulate Han Sen. In
      response, Han Sen was going to play dirty and cruel, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen summoned the little angel, he did not immediately send her
      to the stadium to fight. Instead, he summoned a beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>A green shadow appeared in front of Han Sen: a phantom beast soul.</p>

    <p>
      This phantom-looking beast soul entered the little angel&#8217;s body and
      possessed her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel&#8217;s body did not change very much, save that her eyes
      now flickered with a green flame.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had obtained this beast soul after defeating the Steel-Knight
      King, and it was a humanoid pet possessive beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like any other super pet armor, only pets could make use of it. This
      one was restricted to armoring humanoid pets only.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen first got it, he fed it a black crystal. Over time, it
      slowly evolved into a berserk super beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the Qi family was unlucky, or perhaps the white deer&#8217;s luck
      had already provided a boon to Han Sen, but the beast soul had only just
      finished evolving the night before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that it had possessed the little angel, and she had received the buffs
      from the Steel-Knight King, her power increased by a large amount.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Qi Xiuwen, you chose not to talk this out. And now, you must suffer
      the consequences.&#8221; Han Sen spoke aloud to himself, and then he told
      the little angel to enter the stadium.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pangolin was already there waiting. With Han Sen&#8217;s short delay,
      people began to talk.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Did Han Sen give up?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No way, that means everything will end up in the Qi family&#8217;s
      favor.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t give up, and gets destroyed by the pangolin,
      won&#8217;t things end up even worse?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I hope he doesn&#8217;t quit. If that pill works as advertised,
      then fighting super creatures should be considerably easier.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…&#8230;</p>

    <p>
      As people discussed amongst themselves, a beautiful angel emerged.
      Immediately., everyone&#8217;s attention was ensnared and their excitement
      erupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What will Han Sen do? Look at the pangolin; I don&#8217;t think the
      little angel can finish it off quick. Fighting as he has been would play
      right into the Qi family&#8217;s hands,&#8221; Son of Heaven said. He was
      speaking to Ning Yue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Qi family won&#8217;t achieve what they&#8217;ve planned with
      this charade,&#8221; Ning Yue coldly responded.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why not? I viewed the analysis of the pangolin, and it is projected
      to withstand a few strikes.&#8221; Son of Heaven was quite confused.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ning Yue smiled and said, &#8220;That intel is fair, I&#8217;ll give you
      that. But you should look into people&#8217;s hearts. There are many
      things in this world we are yet to understand, and merely reading data
      would have you believe everything is absolute and fixed. I can assure you
      they are not. If you can read a person&#8217;s heart, even if you
      don&#8217;t know anything else, you can foresee the true results.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I lack the patience you do, I am afraid.&#8221; Son of Heaven gave
      a wry smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s fine. We are still young, and it is fortunate for us to
      be born in such a good era. Many opportunities lie before us, and it is
      simply our task to grab a hold of them and see where they lead.&#8221;
      Ning Yue coughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221; Son of Heaven worried deeply for Ning Yue,
      despite being afraid of her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s fine, I am used to it. Keep an eye on the field, the
      match should begin soon. We wouldn&#8217;t want to miss it.&#8221; Ning
      Yue shook her head and looked at the little angel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen, upon seeing the little angel arrive, became ecstatic. Even if
      the little angel had not shown, they were fixed to walk away a wealthier
      family. The only negative to a no-show would be a lack of oomph to
      underscore their latest work.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the countdown, the little angel wasted no time and swung her sword
      towards the pangolin. As she did this, Qi Xiuwen clenched his fists tight.
      In his heart, he shouted, &#8220;Slash! The era defined by the Qi family
      is coming!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Half a million people were watching this in person, and countless more
      streamed the fight live. All of them stared at the little angel,
      anticipating the crazy fight to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next second, the little angel&#8217;s transparent greatsword
      cleaved across the pangolin&#8217;s back. The shell was like black metal,
      and it looked extremely sturdy. And it truly was; sacred-blood creatures
      couldn&#8217;t even scratch it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But under the sheer force that drove the little angel&#8217;s greatsword,
      it was like tofu. Her sword sundered the shell like a hot knife through
      butter. And it did not stop there. The sword went on to slice the entire
      creature in two. In less than a second, the pangolin was hewn in half.
      Blood painted the arena as the body immediately decomposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s smile froze as his mind was left barren of even a single
      composed thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Far away, in Dong Lin, a middle-aged man witnessed this. The hand that
      held his teacup suddenly began to tremble. The cup fell to the ground,
      spilling its contents everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The middle-aged man lost it completely. As he stared at the screen he
      screamed, &#8220;Impossible! Impossible!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Many bigwigs of the Alliance were shocked, and actually looked
      disappointed. They felt strange.
    </p>

    <p>
      More than anything, they were disappointed in the latest product created
      by the Qi family. It was touted as the must-have item for facing off
      against super creatures, yet it had just been destroyed by a super pet in
      an instant. The pet pills did not seem to be as useful as they had
      believed them to be, and their hopes of slaying super creatures were
      brought to an abrupt end.
    </p>

    <p>
      The funny thing was, the Qi family had done something very dumb. They had
      given out many grand prizes, and the sacred-blood pet they raised
      themselves was killed. Their advertisements and promotions backfired.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone knew pet pills could make pet beast souls stronger, but
      regardless of how strong they were, they could not escape the shackles of
      being a sacred-blood pet. They could still get one-hit killed by a super
      creature, so their purchase and subsequent usage was pointless.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a temporary silence, the applause came in slow like the first
      droplets of rain before a storm. Then, cheering and hooraying erupted from
      every corner of the stadium.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Super pets are overpowered! They really are much stronger than
      sacred-blood pets.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is no wonder it is titled a super pet. They are so cool. They
      one-hit kill everything.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was hoping to see the pangolin last longer than that; I can only
      suppose my hopes were misplaced!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haha! They had it coming. Them old Qi&#8217;s sure think
      they&#8217;re powerful, but all they ended up doing was inciting the wrath
      and ire of Han Sen. He didn&#8217;t kill a single pet earlier, but here,
      he made sure to make his feelings known.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s face had been robbed of all color, and he gave out the
      prizes, embarrassed. For the life of him, he could not figure out how he
      had lost, and he was so ashamed he almost fainted.
    </p>

    <p>
      He knew he had screwed up, thinking the pet pills would be enough to make
      the Qi family famous. All he had done was send them straight to hell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure, the pet pills could aid the family&#8217;s development, but after
      this, that development would be far slower.
