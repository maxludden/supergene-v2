      “Correct, that’s the Sacred egg. However, its shell is too solid. We’ve
      tried everything we could think of, but nothing could break the eggshell.
      We then resorted to using the water from the black pond to erode the shell
      of the Sacred egg. You came here at the right time. After another forty or
      fifty hours, the eggshell will be completely eroded, after which we can
      enjoy this Sacred egg,” said the Destroyer Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rolling Dragon just stared at Han Sen coldly, like a sculpture made of
      iron. Han Sen wasn’t sure if it was because it couldn’t understand the
      human language, or because it didn’t want to talk to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw that neither the Destroyer Wolf nor the Rolling Dragon
      intended to attack him, which surprised him a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought the Destroyer Wolf just wanted to make sure nobody was
      around before it attacked him, yet the Destroyer Wolf didn’t seem to have
      any intention of striking him. It seemed that it had made up its mind to
      share the Sacred egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was still cautious as he wasn’t sure what the Destroyer Wolf
      wanted. He kept his distance from the Destroyer Wolf and the Rolling
      Dragon, and he also kept an eye on the Sacred egg, waiting for it to be
      completely eroded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was called a Sacred egg, there wasn’t any special about its
      appearance. It looked like an ordinary egg at an extra size. It was hard
      to imagine that a great being like the Destroyer Wolf couldn’t break the
      eggshell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water was flowing, and the Sacred egg was floating on it. Han Sen
      looked at it carefully, and he found that there were many tiny black
      engravings on the shell. It seemed that the water from the black pond was
      sipping in.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How should I call you, friend?” The Destroyer Wolf didn’t want to get
      close to Han Sen either. Instead, it watched Han Sen from a distance,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>“Han Sen,” answered Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      “You’re so powerful, so you must come from somewhere famous. What haven’t
      I heard of you before?” asked the Destroyer Wolf again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nowhere famous. I was just lucky enough to obtain some powerful geno
      cores and beast souls,” said Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Han Sen spoke, the less the Destroyer Wolf dared to look down
      upon him. It kept talking with Han Sen, but it didn’t show any sign of
      attacking him. It seemed that it was actually waiting for the eggshell to
      break so that it could share it with Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that eggshell really so solid that even you can’t break it?” Han Sen
      asked again, as he still found it unbelievable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the rules in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, even the descendant of a
      berserk super creature was only at bronze level when it was just born.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf laid down beside the black pond and smiled. “If I were
      really able to break it, I wouldn’t have run around carrying it and being
      hunted by so many powerful creatures.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf paused and laughed. “The master of Sacred spent so much
      effort gaining the confidence of the Destroyer Empress and convincing her
      to birth his child. He’s spent lots of time and effort on that egg, so it
      should be special.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took a look at that Sacred egg, yet he still couldn’t see anything
      special about it. Even more confusing, Han Sen still couldn’t find any
      trace of the creature he had previously been looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that creature was just some food that the Destroyer Wolf and the
      Rolling Dragon brought here and ate, Han Sen should still be able to find
      its scent. Just like the bones left in the cave, all three of them were
      leaving molecules behind. However, Han Sen didn’t see any remaining
      molecules of that creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was afraid that the molecules in the cave were too chaotic for him
      to check carefully. He rechecked them several times, but he still couldn’t
      find any trace of the creature that he had noticed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe that creature didn’t get into the lake? Then where is it?” Han Sen
      was frowning as he thought, but he couldn’t figure anything out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf sometimes talked with Han Sen, and it was gentle and
      looked harmless.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, the Rolling Dragon didn’t say a word. It just lay beside
      the black pond, staring at the floating Sacred egg as if that egg was the
      only thing it could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn’t show any intention of attacking Han Sen, which confused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er sometimes looked at the Sacred egg as if it were some kind of new
      toy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed, and more and more black fissures appeared on the eggshell.
      Just as the Destroyer Wolf said, the eggshell seemed to be almost
      completely eroded.
    </p>
    <p>Kacha!</p>
    <p>
      After more than fifty hours of waiting, Han Sen, Destroyer Wolf, and the
      Rolling Dragon heard a blast that sounded like an eggshell cracking after
      being boiled.
    </p>
    <p>A black crack appeared on the white eggshell.</p>
    <p>
      “It’s done!” The Destroyer Wolf was exhilarated, and the Rolling Dragon
      was even more so. Its tail was carrying the trident, and it immediately
      threw the trident toward the egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The egg was already covered with small cracks, and Han Sen thought that
      the trident of the Rolling Dragon would pierce through the egg completely.
      However, when the tip of the trident hit one of the cracks, there were
      only some sparks on the egg, and the egg was perfectly safe. The crack
      wasn’t enlarged at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was terrified. The Destroyer Wolf had told him how sturdy the
      Sacred egg was, but he hadn’t believed it until now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had experienced the trident’s power, and it was definitely at the
      top-tier level in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. Despite that, it couldn’t
      injure the shell at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf licked its lips, and it stopped the Rolling Dragon from
      striking again. It gazed at the sacred egg and said, “Guess I need to wait
      longer. We’ve waited for a long time, so there’s no need to rush it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rolling Dragon retreated back to the original spot and laid down. Han
      Sen stared at the Sacred egg, but something still seemed strange to him.
      There wasn’t anything living in the Sacred egg. After the eggshell
      cracked, Han Sen finally managed to detect some energy coming from the
      egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it wasn’t a lifeforce coming from the egg, but a force that
      resembled death.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why does this power feel like death? Does this Sacred egg have the power
      of a dead spirit? That shouldn’t be right. I’ve seen the power of Goddess,
      and her power feels nothing like this. If they’re both descendants of
      Sacred’s master, they shouldn’t be so different,” Han Sen thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen was thinking, he frowned and turned his attention to a corner
      of the cave. There were some familiar molecules floating there: the same
      molecules he saw on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Strange! I’ve checked the cave several times already, yet I couldn’t find
      any of the molecules of that creature. Why have some showed up here now?”
      Han Sen frowned worriedly.
