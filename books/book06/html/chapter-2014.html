<p>Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang were shocked, and they
were too late to stop what was in motion.</p>
<p>Angia was a top Earl. Even they didn’t think they could beat
him. Yun Suyi had only just become an Earl, so it was highly
unlikely she’d win.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was Sky Palace. Even if she lost, her life
wouldn’t be in danger.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang still felt sick, though. She knew Yun Suyi could not
stand ill words being said about Han Sen, and that was why she was
stepping forward.</p>
<p>Angia watched the elegantly dressed lady walk towards him. He
looked surprised. He smiled and said, “Sister Yun must have only
just become an Earl. If I remember correctly, the Yun family
specializes in swords. I would feel terrible if I defeated
you.”</p>
<p>“The Yun family’s swordskills are strong, so it would not be all
that impressive if I used swordskills to win. I have, however,
learned a few knifeskills from Han Sen. I wager that will be
enough,” Yun Suyi said coldly. Then she drew Ice Knife.</p>
<p>Angia frowned. He knew Yun Suyi was Yun Changkong’s daughter,
and it would be bad for him to offend her. But the Feathers had
prepared the Blood Feather Knife for the third elder, so he
couldn’t hand it over to Yun Suyi instead. Yun Suyi had just become
an Earl, too. If he lost to her, it would actually damage his own
reputation. People would think he had deliberately thrown a match
just to please a woman. It’d look terrible.</p>
<p>Angia raced to think of a way out, but Yun Suyi had already
drawn her knife. He couldn’t tell her he wasn’t going to fight. So,
after a moment of thought, Angia concocted a new scheme.</p>
<p>“If Sister Yun is this interested, then I will agree to the
contest. Please…” Angia pulled out a jade knife as he smiled to
her.</p>
<p>He planned to only block her attacks in order to make her feel
her inferiority. If she refused to quit, he would concede. That
way, people would simply think he was a gentleman who wouldn’t
fight a woman.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi bowed with her Ice Knife, and then she slashed. She
used the knifeskill Under the Sky.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi could not withstand Angia’s mocking of Han Sen, but she
knew that she hadn’t mastered Under the Sky yet.</p>
<p>After all, not many people would use Under the Sky to fight. All
her experience with it had come from Han Sen himself. Han Sen told
her she had finished learning it, though, and all she had to do was
keep practicing with it. She had no idea how powerfully she might
be able to use it in a real contest.</p>
<p>And when Yun Suyi attacked, Angia’s face changed. His plan
vanished in a puff of smoke as he saw a woman that looked like a
ravenous wolf coming for him. He immediately became tense.</p>
<p>It was just one slash, but Angia could feel wisps of a most
dangerous presence rising from that skill.</p>
<p>Angia was careful, and so he responded seriously. He started to
cast Judgment Knife to retaliate, and he looked more serious now
than he had when beating down Strong Cow.</p>
<p>After Yun Suyi slashed once, she was on the move. Before the
knife air completed its attack, she slashed another two times.</p>
<p>Angia lifted his knife and retreated. He used his knifeskills to
fight back.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang were frozen. They had
seen Under the Sky before, as the Yun family had created and
developed it. But they knew not many people made use of it, due to
how fatal its flaws could be. If an opponent caught wind of the
technique’s flaw during a fight, it could lead to an opening and
the subsequent death of the user.</p>
<p>But Yun Suyi’s Under the Sky seemed very different to Thousand
Feather Crane and Yun Sushang. They could not tell what had
changed, but it was obvious that the biggest problems of the skill
had vanished under Yun Suyi’s casting.</p>
<p>How strong was Under the Sky? This question had an answer in Yun
Suyi.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Yun Suyi was nervous and her movements were
unnatural. She soon noticed that, after using the skill, Angia was
following her lead. It was just like how she practiced, and now she
felt safe.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi remembered Han Sen told her that unless the opponent
was much stronger than her, as long as she pulled off the first
strike, none could beat her. The first strike was not random; it
would home in on the opponent’s weakness. That was how Under the
Sky began.</p>
<p>Once the opponent blocked the first strike, Under the Sky would
keep on coming. It was like a target-lock on the opposing fighter
that would trap them in the skill.</p>
<p>Unless the opponent’s mind could see through destiny, they could
not escape the trap that was Under the Sky. They would end up like
a puppet, locked into following Under the Sky until they were
completely trapped.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi usually fought Han Sen, and she knew Han Sen’s
knifemind was only one step away from being deified.</p>
<p>The pressure Han Sen put upon Yun Suyi was nothing like fighting
Angia. She was used to Han Sen’s strength, and dealing with Angia
was easy, by comparison. The pressure was nowhere near on the same
level.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the other students looked upon Yun
Suyi in shock as she kept swinging her Ice Knife. Her attacks
seemed almost carefree. And in front of her was Angia, who now
looked awfully grim. His forehead was dripping with sweat as he
tried to escape her onslaught.</p>
<p>Angia was like a puppet now. He couldn’t cast any knifeskills
anymore. Every time he tried to, Yun Suyi interrupted him halfway
through with a perfectly placed attack. So, he would end up falling
back again.</p>
<p>Angia prepared to use a skill that would injure them both, but
then, he noticed he couldn’t even do that. Yun Suyi was striking
before he could cast a single thing. He began to feel like there
was some invisible wire tangling him up, and it was getting tighter
and tighter. So much so that he couldn’t use his talents. He wanted
to start coughing up blood.</p>
<p>If Angia had been someone like Lone Bamboo, who could put his
knife away before destiny, then he might have been able to escape
Under the Sky. But he wasn’t that strong.</p>
<p>The entire arena was frozen. No one expected Yun Suyi to be this
strong. Even Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang were frozen in
disbelief.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? Her Under the Sky has no flaw!” Thousand
Feather Crane mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>It was very shocking to see a fixed version of Under the Sky
being used perfectly. This was something that was going to shock
everyone from the elders to the leader himself.</p>
