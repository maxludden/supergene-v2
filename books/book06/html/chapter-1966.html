<p>Open air extended as far as Han Sen could see both above and
below Sky Palace. The islands floated together in the midst of a
seemingly endless sea of sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat on Thousand Feather Crane’s bird and admired the
view. After one hour of travel, the snow-white bird descended on
one island in particular. The island was situated between the
clouds, so their vision was a little hindered. What could be seen
clearly, however, were the twelve jade towers rising amidst the
clouds.</p>
<p>The snow-white bird landed on the island, and Thousand Feather
Crane and Han Sen dismounted. He noticed the whole island was
composed of jade, but it didn’t look manmade.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane headed towards the White Jade Building.
When Han Sen looked over there, he saw it glisten. He had barely
been able to see the twelve White Jade Buildings from the air. When
he was standing on the island, all he could see was one of them in
front of him. The other eleven were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Each White Jade Building consisted of seven floors. From where
he was standing, he could see that the crystal constructs were
protected by light. Just like the island, the jade did not look
man-made. It was as if it had been born like that.</p>
<p>“Thousand Feather, who created the White Jade Building?” Han Sen
asked as he walked.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane answered, “White Jade Jing has twelve
buildings and five cities. It existed long before the xenogeneic
space was first discovered. They grew here naturally, instead of
being built by people like you and me.”</p>
<p>“This is amazing.” Han Sen was interested in White Jade
Jing.</p>
<p>They both came before the building. There were no guards around.
Thousand Feather Crane pushed the door open and walked inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen was disappointed, and he said, “I thought that White
Jade Jing is a place not many are allowed access to. Why are there
no guards? Anyone could walk right in.”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane coldly said, “Didn’t you see the two jade
beasts outside the door? You can come in because you have a tablet.
If you didn’t have it, you’d have already been eaten alive by now.
If you don’t have the tablet, you cannot access this place.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Now Han Sen remembered the pair of three-meter-tall
jade beasts. They looked like kirin, with one standing at each side
of the building. He thought they were dead, but they were actually
alive.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane did not say anything more, and just kept
on walking.</p>
<p>Han Sen was checking out the building, but there was nothing to
see on the inside. There were just a few steps leading up to the
second floor.</p>
<p>Han Sen, seeing Thousand Feather Crane ascend the flight of
stairs, followed.</p>
<p>The second floor was the same as the last; it was empty. There
was only another staircase that led up to the third floor. Han Sen
thought this was strange, and so he asked, “Why is there nothing
inside this building? What are the benefits to practicing
here?”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane approached the next flight of stairs and
said, “It is not time for White Jade Jing to open yet. That is why
there is nothing here. White Jade Tower has seven floors. The
higher you go, there more Jade Air you can receive. You are a
Viscount, so practicing on the third floor should be good. If you
can take the Jade Air here, you can go up higher.”</p>
<p>After that, Thousand Feather Crane went up to the third floor.
Han Sen followed.</p>
<p>On the third floor, there was finally something to see. A few
young Sky people were sitting. No one spoke and no one talked.</p>
<p>The few young ones, when seeing Thousand Feather Crane, stood up
and said, “Greetings, Uncle Crane.”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane nodded and proceeded up to the fourth
floor.</p>
<p>The young ones looked at Han Sen curiously, as if he was a
stranger. They did not know if he was the student of Knife Queen
that had just entered.</p>
<p>One of them did know Han Sen, however. It was Lady Su with the
middle-aged man in gray clothing. Her full name was Yun Suyi. Lady
Su was what her family called her.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi’s eyes smiled like a moon. She sat in the corner,
looked at Han Sen, and thought, “How dare he come here? He must be
the first person who had to be carried into Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>The other Skys were interested in Han Sen, as not many outsiders
were allowed to enter White Jade Jing. And they hadn’t heard of any
that had received permission after being carried in.</p>
<p>A young man walked in front of Han Sen and said, “My name is Yun
Fei; I am a student of one of the nine seats. Which are you
from?”</p>
<p>“I am not a student of Sky Palace. My teacher is Knife Queen,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“You are Han Sen? The one who got dragged here?” Yun Fei shouted
in shock.</p>
<p>The other people stared at Han Sen as if he was an animal from
the zoo.</p>
<p>Yes, I am that same Han Sen.” Han Sen shrugged. He didn’t really
care what they thought of him.</p>
<p>“Bro, you are awesome. Ever since the Sky claimed this place,
you are the first person to get carried in. How did you do that?”
Yun Fei laughed as he patted Han Sen on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“That was an accident, I’m afraid. There is no need to be
jealous.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Yun Fei and the other Sky could see Han Sen had a mild temper
and was willing to joke around, so they chatted for a while.</p>
<p>Only the elites of the Sky were permitted access to White Jade
Jing. There was no conflict amongst them, so they chatted happily
with each other.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi merely watched, however. She did not participate.
Seeing Han Sen talk with them, she thought to herself, “He seems
nice, but his will is weak. Why would Knife Queen be willing to
accept a student such as this? He is not even one of the
Rebate.”</p>
<p>After talking for a while, Yun Fei suddenly said, “Time’s up.
Talk later.”</p>
<p>After that, everyone found themselves a place to sit down.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew White Jade Jing was going to open, so he found a
place to sit down as well.</p>
<p>The jade tower had no dust. The floor that was made from jade
was smooth and cool. Han Sen felt a cool air enter his body as he
sat.</p>
<p>As the cold air curled around Han Sen, the jade stone in the
center of the floor began to emit white smoke. That white smoke
expanded through the room, glittering as it went. It filled every
inch of the air. Everyone cast their powers to absorb the smoke
from the jade, creating small vortexes around them.</p>
<p>Han Sen had asked them about White Jade Tower while they were
chatting, so he knew that he was supposed to use his geno art to
absorb the Jade Air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen felt a chill energy penetrate his body.</p>
