    <p>
      While Queen was looking away, Han Sen summoned the Deadeye Peacock beast
      soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      A peacock-like bird appeared in front of Han Sen, flapping its wings. It
      was roughly two feet long.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking closer, he realized that it wasn&#8217;t a living creature, but a
      blue-colored metal crossbow. It was shaped to resemble a peacock, with its
      wings composing the bow of the weapon. With the body as its stock, the
      mouth of the peacock was where the tips of the bolts were lodged, and the
      top of the head itself was the sightline with which its user would aim. It
      was a beautiful piece of equipment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elastic string of the crossbow was unusual, however. It was like a
      beam of translucent hardlight, fixed between the ends of the wings. Han
      Sen could command for bolts to be nocked and drawn with his mind, and he
      only had to pull on the lock to loose them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked inside its accompanying quiver and saw that there was
      enough space for eight bolts to be stored. This was a fine amount,
      particularly for a weapon that could be used as efficiently as a pistol.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he used beast soul bolts, he&#8217;d have an infinite supply of ammo,
      too – provided the bolts weren&#8217;t broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen examined the peacock crossbow with an open jaw. It was a
      remarkable weapon to have in his possession, but without the appropriate
      bolts, it was little more than a sturdy stick to beat stuff over the head
      with.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is great, but you could at least provide me with some bolts.
      You didn&#8217;t even give me a single one. Now I have to go find some
      myself?&#8221; Han Sen didn&#8217;t know whether he should be happy or sad
      right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The peacock crossbow looked incredibly powerful, but his visual perception
      was all that he could use to get to know it. He had no way of giving it a
      proper test run.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ll formulate a few steel
      bolts for it and think about getting beast soul bolts further down the
      line.&#8221; Han Sen tucked the crossbow away, realizing that its usage
      wouldn&#8217;t be as simple as he had hoped. However, even without the
      high-end bolts that would be best to use, it should still be pretty
      powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      A crossbow was vastly different to a traditional bow. The strength of the
      latter weapon stems from the human that makes use of it. Crossbows were
      automatic, and the power and efficiency derived from the weapons came from
      the bolts that were used and the craftsmanship of the weapons themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      They continued to sail for another ten days before Han Sen caught sight of
      land. It wasn&#8217;t just any parcel of land, either. It was a human
      shelter, one that operated on the coast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, upon arriving, made sure to teleport back to the Alliance. He had
      been gone for some time, following his misadventure with the White Tiger.
      He was afraid Ji Yanran had become gravely concerned over his welfare and
      whereabouts, so he made sure to check-in on her. He wanted to comfort her
      and make some bolts for his new crossbow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran really did worry over him. When she saw him return, she was
      delightfully surprised and she did her best to shelve how upset she was.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen comforted her for a while and her mood genuinely brightened.</p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran had been upset not because he had been gone for so long, but
      because she did not know whether or not he was okay.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen lay on his bed that night, he decided to log into the virtual
      community. He visited the army to take a look at the weaponry on offer
      there, and finally decided to purchase Z-class bolts.
    </p>

    <p>
      All sorts of weaponry and equipment could be purchased in the army, for
      the right amount of money. Only weaponry that dealt raw, physical damage
      could be bought, however. Weapons that inflicted elemental damage were not
      available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen browsed around for a while before he stumbled across the Z-class
      bolts he had resolved to buy. Different crossbows could only employ
      certain types and sizes of bolts, and these were the ones Han Sen thought
      he would need.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the peacock crossbow was a beast soul crossbow, and that meant it had
      fantastic compatibility. Provided the bolts weren&#8217;t too long, he
      could make use of them. So Han Sen selected a few different types of bolts
      and bought them.
    </p>

    <p>
      After buying the bolts, Han Sen went off to browse the news and see if
      anything important had occurred in the Alliance during his absence. Many
      things had transpired, such as a half-god killing a bunch of creatures, a
      victory for the Alliance in a war that was taking place in another system,
      and how the Shura people managed to reclaim a planet that was taken from
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, despite all of the things that had been going on, none of these
      events were of personal concern to Han Sen. After a while of browsing
      there, he went onto the Skynet platform to research as much information
      about crossbows and their bolts as he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a good while of searching for bolts exclusively, he noticed there
      was an extreme shortage of the bolts available in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, which led him to believe the crossbow was an unpopular weapon
      type.
    </p>

    <p>
      More popular swords and knives had billions of beast soul variants to
      purchase, but the total number of bolts available for purchase was in the
      low tens of millions.
    </p>

    <p>
      He enabled the filters to browse for sacred-blood beast soul bolts and was
      surprised to see only a mere dozen for sale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the locations where these bolts were on sale and saw the
      names of shelters that he had never heard of before or were in remote,
      inaccessible places. It seemed that it might be impossible for him to
      trade for the bolts he sought.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I cannot buy the bolts I need, I&#8217;ll just have to hunt down
      the creatures myself.&#8221; Han Sen scoured the Icefield, Golden Beach,
      and Whitestone Beach for information, hoping to find out where
      sacred-blood beast soul bolts could drop.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a good while of searching, he came across a creature that was known
      to drop sacred-blood beast soul bolts near Whitestone Beach.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a creature known as Sky Falcon. They were mostly ordinary, but
      there were mutants amongst them. The Sky Falcon king was the sacred-blood
      variant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people had hunted the ordinary Sky Falcons for traditional bolts that
      were quite powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      After learning what he could about the Sky Falcons, he knew he&#8217;d
      like them. And if a sacred-blood falcon became a berserk sacred-blood
      class beast soul, it&#8217;d be a fearsome thing to behold. With his new
      crossbow in hand, perhaps he could use such a bolt to shred or pierce the
      shells, scales, or skin of super creatures that were extra thick and
      previously impervious.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Sky Falcons lived on the peaks of the Sky Pillar mountain. There
      were many other creatures there, which would make it a difficult trek to
      the top.
    </p>

    <p>
      The person who provided him this information had only learnt what he knew
      from a Sky Falcon that had fallen down the mountainside. He hadn&#8217;t
      climbed up the mountain himself, so it was sketchy information at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With the silver fox here, I shouldn&#8217;t have much difficulty
      reaching the peak – provided there are no super creatures up there,&#8221;
      Han Sen mused to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen really wanted these Sky Falcons now, and even if they did not drop
      a sacred-blood beast soul, with their small bodies, Han Sen could increase
      his sacred geno point tally by a good deal in a short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen conducted more research about Sky Pillar mountain, so he could be
      as prepared as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      After looking for a while, Han Sen furrowed his eyebrows. People had
      recently reported sighting a freakish monster there, riding a red cloud
      around the Sky Pillar mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Judging from the reports, all signs pointed to it being another super
      creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ring! Ring! As he was finishing up his browser session, his communicator
      rang.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was Zhu Ting calling. He had asked for his number a while back, but
      this was the first time he had called him. Han Sen wondered what he wanted
      at this time.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Boss, this is not good!&#8221; Zhu Ting said, hastily.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s not good?&#8221; Han Sen frowned.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mystery Island. There is a Mystery Island on the Icefield. Where
      are you? Come back! If you don&#8217;t, others will seek to claim the
      benefits!&#8221; Zhu Ting&#8217;s face looked panicky.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen for a bit, knowing why Zhu Ting was in such a rush.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Mystery Island here was different than the one in the First
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary. The Mystery Island must have had a royal-class
      spirit shelter situated on it. If it did, the likelihood of something good
      being there was extremely high.
