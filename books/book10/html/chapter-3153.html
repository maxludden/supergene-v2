<h2>Jia Shi Zhen</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3153</h3>

<p>Hearing that Qin Bai had been playing checkers for two days in
the Feng family castle, without his ass leaving the chair once to
touch the sword, Jia Shi Zhen was extremely worried.</p>
<p>Other kingdoms had many inheritors. There was always a choice in
who succeeded the throne. The Qin Kingdom only had one crown
prince. He was sure to be the next one wearing the crown. If Qin
Bai continued his ridiculous behavior, the Qin Kingdom’s lofty
position would likely fall.</p>
<p>“A bad officer is able to destroy a kingdom.” Jia Shi Zhen kept
thinking about that phrase. The officers always spoke those nine
words.</p>
<p>After she returned to the Qin Kingdom, those nine words were
what Jia Shi Zhen heard the most. Every time she heard them, it
seemed to be connected to Han Sen-another two words she frequently
heard.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Jia Shi Zhen had the attitude to not totally
trust those words. She did not believe them. After this experience,
she was starting to believe that Han Sen was a bad influence. He
was a very bad influence.</p>
<p>“I want to see this reckless nobody and what he is doing to
trick Mister Crown Prince.” Jia Shi Zhen decided to go to Feng
Castle. She wanted to meet the very famous bad influencer.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to Feng Castle and saw Bao’er playing games
with Qin Bai. Bao’er seemed happy, but Qin Bai did not look to be
faring as well.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin was watching their engagement with interest. In
fact, during the past two days, she and Bao’er had been playing
games with Qin Bai. She had just learned checkers, so she was
really interested in it. She thought Qin Bai was like her, which
was why she gave up her rest time to play checkers with them.</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>Only God knew that Qin Bai now hated playing chess. For as long
as he lived, he never wanted to play another game of chess. He
believed he would throw up the next time he heard someone even
mention the checkers.</p>
<p>Upon seeing a shadow in the garden, Qin Bai looked at Han Sen as
if he was asking for help. That look was worse than that of a sheep
going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Han Sen pretended as if he did not know anything. He walked up
to Qin Bai and asked, “Crown Prince, are you having fun with
Bao’er?”</p>
<p>Qin Bai felt relieved to gain his freedom. He fell out of the
chair.</p>
<p>Han Sen immediately picked him up and shockingly asked, “Crown
Prince, are you okay?” Qin Bai felt as if he was so angry that he
could explode. He was going to yell at Han Sen. When he saw Bao’er,
he felt more fear than anger. He madly whispered to Han Sen, “Han
Sen, I treat you like a friend. I treat you nicely. How could you
do this to me?”</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, what are you talking about? Why would I
want to harm you?” Han Sen looked at Qin Bai and spoke with a tone
of shock.</p>
<p>“You didn’t bring me harm, but why is she treating me like
this?” Qin Bai looked at Bao’er and sounded weaker.</p>
<p>He was scared of quite a few people, including Jia Shi Zhen, but
even she didn’t make him this scared. Jia Shi Zhen was now viewed
as being much nicer when compared to Bao’er. The girl’s pretty face
now looked demonic in his eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen seemed to understand. “I thought you wanted to practice
with the sword. Bao’er is here teaching you the ways of the sword.
Is she not? How has she harmed you?”</p>
<p>“She…” Qin Bai suddenly did not know what to say.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not wait for him to formulate a proper response
before asking, “Have you been playing chess games with Bao’er?” “We
have been playing games of chess for two days and two nights.” Qin
Bai loudly chomped his own teeth.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not wait for him to speak. He looked at Qin Bai with
shock and said, “Crown Prince, you really are a man with a mind
like steel. It is no wonder you are the Qin Kingdom’s crown prince.
You will be the greatest leader. You’ll be a leader that can
conquer the world. A normal person’s will is weak. To play a game
of chess against Bao’er, they would break. Yet you have been
playing against Bao’er for two days and two nights. You are strong.
You are very strong. I have never admired anyone before, but I have
to admire you, Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai was frozen. He was just a child who loved goofing
around. He did not think that sounded right. Seeing Han Sen’s
shocked face, Qin Bai at least thought it was rather surprising</p>
<p>“Cough. Cough. It was nothing. It was just a few rounds of
chess. To a crown prince, it is not much of a feat.” Based on the
way he was now speaking, Qin Bai seemed to enjoy the praise.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, did I not tell you to allow him to rest? Why do you
keep playing chess games with the crown prince? You are so rude.”
Han Sen looked cold as he told off Bao’er.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked innocent as she said, “I planned on that, but the
crown prince wanted to play 300 rounds with me. He is the crown
prince. Why would I disobey his wishes? How could you take this out
on me?”</p>
<p>Bao’er’s face looked as if she had been wronged. Even Crown
Prince Qin Bai felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, he had said something like that to
Bao’er. He really wanted to slap his mouth. If he had known this
would happen, he would not have said something so brash.</p>
<p>“I will punish you this time so you will not be so ignorant. You
could run into trouble someday.” Han Sen looked glum. It was as if
he was ready to really teach Bao’er a lesson, but he gave her a
subtle wink.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s hand had yet to touch her when Bao’er started crying.
She was crying as she said, “Crown Prince made me do this. Why
don’t you punish him instead of me?” “It is fine. It is fine. It
was me that did not clarify things. Please, do not punish Bao’er.”
Qin Bai felt really guilty as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Go and thank the crown prince. Don’t do it again after that. Do
you hear me?” Han Sen let Bao’er go.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, Crown Prince. Next time, when you play a game of
chess against me, I will let you rest after 10 rounds.” Bao’er made
a promise.</p>
<p>When Qin Bai heard that, his legs felt soft. He was shocked. He
fell to the ground and shook his head. “No more games. No more
games. I will never play chess again.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it was funny. He wanted to say something, but
someone suddenly made a declaration from outside the garden.
“Mister Han, Teacher Jia wants to see you.”</p>
<p>After the person said that, a woman with a cold-looking face
walked in. Qin Bai saw the woman. His body started to tremble. He
immediately bowed to her and said, “Qin Bai greets Teacher
Jia.”</p>
<p>“You are welcome, Crown Prince.” When Jia Shi Zhen spoke, she
did not look at Qin Bai. She looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>He was different from the figure she had often heard about.
There were no legends about his remarkable sharp mouth and monkey
throat. He looked like a handsome man. His face was very sharp. It
was hard to tell his age. Judging from his looks, he looked like he
was in his twenties.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen was not someone who determined a person’s character
via their appearance. Her thoughts of Han Sen did not change
because of the way he looked.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, what are you doing here?” Jia Shi Zhen did
not speak to Han Sen. To her, Han Sen was just a rankless, albeit
loved, officer. Talking to him made her mouth feel dirty.</p>
