    <p>
      Han Sen hadn&#8217;t been in the sea long before he saw Queen approaching.
      Like an arrow, she bolted into the sea. The blood on her body brought a
      misty haze of red flowers to the water, and it looked beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      He then saw a flash of white light descend across the tumultuous waves of
      the sea, and it violently scraped and clawed its way across the sea
      surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the tiger brought its paws down on the water, the seas parted in
      half, creating a trench of a few dozen meters. It looked as if the tiger
      wasn&#8217;t yet willing to quit its pursuit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purple light in Queen&#8217;s body was shining and she now clutched a
      lance in each hand. They were both dyed purple. She quickly turned around
      to block an incoming attack.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      Both lances were destroyed, which prompted Queen to say &#8220;hum.&#8221;
      Bleeding from her chest, she was knocked further into the sea.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Queen was driven into the seabed, forming a deep hole in the shape of her
      body. This hit put her in a critical status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the White Tiger would not swim, it continued to swing its paws.
      The violent gusts of wind drove the sea mad, producing waves that were
      thirty feet high; many coursed through the waters to slice at the seabed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen resisted succumbing to the pain that engulfed her. She dodged the
      White Tiger&#8217;s attacks as she tried swimming deeper and deeper into
      the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Crap. This White Tiger is too much.&#8221; Han Sen was planning to
      meet up with Queen under the sea, but he hadn&#8217;t counted on the White
      Tiger being as feral as it was. Going down there now would be useless, so
      he simply stayed where he was, hoping Queen could continue dodging the
      creature&#8217;s assault.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the hit Queen had received was terrible, and it affected her
      performance a great deal. It was already hard enough for a person to
      manoeuvre in the sea, and now Han Sen could see she was about to miss her
      next dodge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gritting his teeth, Han Seen took the plunge and went under towards Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen was still struggling. She noticed a shadow coming right for her, and
      after squinting for greater clarity, saw that it was Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pulled Queen deeper into the sea. He was incredibly dexterous in
      the sea, so he was far more mobile than Queen underwater.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hold me.&#8221; Han Sen put Queen on his back and told her to grab
      his waist. Then, with full speed, he sped off into darker waters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The White Tiger was not keen to give up, so it continued casting its
      murderous gusts down into the sea. But Han Sen was like one of the merfolk
      as he swam across the seabed with great speed, effortlessly dodging each
      of the tiger&#8217;s attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen was grabbing Han Sen tight, and she felt touched. She had never
      expected Han Sen to come and save her like he had.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even in the sea, Han Sen was using the formation taught to him by the
      Dongxuan Sutra. He kept manoeuvring and switching position to dodge the
      tiger as he went, as pure speed wouldn&#8217;t have cut it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But still, the White Tiger was not willing to let them go. It wasn&#8217;t
      until they were at a depth of eighty meters that the tiger gave up its
      attacks. At that depth, even the ferocious bullets of wind could not
      damage them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the White Tiger was still in pursuit, for wherever Han Sen swam, the
      tiger hovered above. It was not going to give up its prey so easily, and
      it most certainly wasn&#8217;t going to allow them to swim up to the
      surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Crap! Is it a dog?&#8221; Han Sen had already swum three hundred
      meters deep without being able to shake its chase. He cursed it in his
      heart and continued swimming deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      After swimming for half an hour, Han Sen was around five hundred meters
      deep. But it was still to no avail. From above the brackish waters, the
      tiger continued to watch them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was preparing to swim even deeper, but then he noticed something
      was wrong with Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned around to take a look at her, and her face was not looking good.
      It wasn&#8217;t because of the injuries she had sustained, however; it was
      because she was suffocating.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. After he learned Dongxuan Sutra, he was able to
      breathe underwater. Even the silver fox had this ability. Alas, Queen did
      not.
    </p>

    <p>
      If she hadn&#8217;t been injured, she could have remained under the sea
      for several hours, but she had taken a blow to the chest. Her lungs were
      damaged, which made it difficult for her to remain underwater as she was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen gestured to Han Sen, telling him that she wanted to return to the
      surface. She did not want to go up merely for air, but also to allow Han
      Sen a chance of escaping their current predicament.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pulled her close and shook his head. He looked into her eyes,
      touched her face, and sealed her lips with his own.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a pleasant taste to her kiss. Her eyes opened wide at the sight
      of Han Sen, whose face was directly in front of hers.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she quickly understood what he was trying to do. She didn&#8217;t
      attempt to push him back, as she initially desired, and instead swallowed
      the pleasant taste he was providing her with. She was no longer
      suffocating and she felt rejuvenated.
    </p>

    <p>
      When her body was relieved, she pushed Han Sen away and grabbed his waist
      once again. Then they swam deeper. When Queen could no longer hold her
      breath, Han Sen gladly breathed more air into her lungs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After doing this a few times, Han Sen had swum several thousand meters
      below the sea. Eventually, the White Tiger gave up its chase and returned
      to the island.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was still worried, though. To ensure absolutely safety, he swam
      for another dozen miles and then returned to the surface. When they were
      back below the sky, the tiger was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, Queen summoned her whale. She quickly climbed onto it and fell down;
      her face looked poorly. The wound in her chest was deep and it
      hadn&#8217;t had the chance to heal, due to being in the water for so
      long. She had also suffered much blood loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly searched himself and Queen, but realized the package they
      had brought with them was gone. They had no curatives or medical items.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll be able to hold on. Cough!
      Cough!&#8221; Queen managed to maintain her composure, and if
      weren&#8217;t for the gaping wound, it would be difficult to tell she had
      been severely injured.
    </p>

    <p>
      But having damaged her lung, even speaking caused her to spit out some
      blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Just hold on!&#8221; Han Sen used his hands to tear off some of her
      battlesuit, clearing the area around her wound. The beast soul armor had
      already been destroyed by the White Tiger, and the battlesuit beneath was
      damaged. Han Sen ripped it easily, exposing her chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      A pair of massive, snow white breasts presented themselves to Han Sen. But
      they were damaged, a nasty gash cutting across them. Han Sen wasn&#8217;t
      sure whether or not to be aroused by the sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen&#8217;s eyes revealed her awkwardness over the situation, but she
      did not move. All she did was blush.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under their current circumstances, Han Sen wasn&#8217;t in the mood to
      admire her body, so he lifted the silver fox and placed it on her chest.
      He then told it, &#8220;Silver Fox, please help!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox looked at Han Sen and then turned to look at Queen. It then
      started licking her snow-white skin.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the silver fox had licked her for a brief while, her body began to
      tremble. The wound that had already started to show signs of infection
      sealed shut. With the bleeding stopped, the area looked better and better
      each second.
