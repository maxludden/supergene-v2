<h3>Chapter 1721</h3>

<p>After half a day, the ship was still moving sluggishly along. It
was slowly descending now, though, and Han Sen made sure to look
out the window. The ship was in the process of landing close to a
mountain.</p>
<p>As they got closer, Han Sen saw that they were landing in a
valley. When Han Sen looked down, however, a strange sight met his
eyes.</p>
<p>The valley was shaped like a large hoofprint, and the mountain
near it had been cut at an angle of ninety degrees.</p>
<p>“Cow Foot Valley. There’s a xenogeneic here?” Long looked out
and frowned.</p>
<p>“Long, you know this place?” Han Sen looked at Long. Suo Tu and
Kun did so as well.</p>
<p>Long said, “I used to live in a city near Cow Foot Valley, and I
frequently visited here. The legends say a Noble once rode a green
cow here, but a xenogeneic tried to provoke the Noble. The Noble
ignored the creature, and the green cow stepped on it. The
xenogeneic and the mountain were crushed beneath its hoof, thus
giving the valley its shape. The Noble continued on his way, atop
the green cow, leaving behind a purple mist in his wake. It
remained there for three days.”</p>
<p>“Some villagers believe that the presence of that Noble still
resides there and that the xenogeneics will never dare to go close
again. Many people moved close to the valley, gathering into a town
that was aptly called Cow Foot Town. It looks like the Noble isn’t
able to protect them anymore, though, considering that a xenogeneic
has now come.”</p>
<p>Everyone sighed after hearing the story. Han Sen thought the
story seemed odd, though. The Noble mentioned sounded very familiar
to him. It sounded like someone from the Alliance.</p>
<p>The ship came to rest in the valley, and all the soldiers
disembarked the airship and lined up in front of it.</p>
<p>Weapons like guns wouldn’t work on xenogeneics, so they were
going to rely on melee weaponry. Aside from their geno armors, they
were each given a shield and a metal sword. They had a flaregun on
their waists, but they weren’t intended to be weapons. They were
for giving a signal whenever the xenogeneic was found.</p>
<p>Han Sen finally saw the Black Gold hunting group’s Noble now,
too. He walked toward the captain. He was a middle-aged Kate man,
and his ears and tail were yellow and white.</p>
<p>The captain referred to him as Mister Tiger. The captain and
Mister Tiger directed the team towards a nearby town.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen reached the entrance, he saw a few corpses
scattered around a field. They were the deceased residents of the
town. They were all Kate, and they were all in gristly pieces. Many
had their heads wholly cut off. It was a very bloody and gruesome
sight.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined their wounds and determined they had been
killed by something’s claws.</p>
<p>“Nine-Life Cat said he was not welcome in the geno universe. Is
he a xenogeneic, maybe?” Han Sen wondered to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t think Old Cat did this, though. He didn’t seem
bored enough to attack random villagers, and the claws seemed
different from those he possessed.</p>
<p>“Follow and maintain formation!” the captain shouted, ushering
them all on.</p>
<p>Xenogeneics powerful hunters and formidable assassins. Unless
you had an advantage, finding them was impossible.</p>
<p>After entering the town, the entire group had goosebumps. Blood,
viscera, and severed limbs were everywhere. The town was an ugly
depiction of hell.</p>
<p>Even young toddlers had been torn apart</p>
<p>“Damn!” Long shouted angrily.</p>
<p>Suo Tu did not say anything, but gripped his sword tight with
contempt.</p>
<p>Han Sen could now understand the helplessness that commoners
might feel when pitted against a xenogeneic. Not even geno armor
could defend against their claws. Only the Noble’s could, most
likely. That was common knowledge.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger brought them through the town, but they were unable
to locate their culprit. He spoke to the captain, and the captain
ordered the group to split up into smaller groups, so they could
search in a variety of directions.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger thought the xenogeneic had to still be hiding in
the valley. If that was the case, then they’d have to kill it.</p>
<p>Now was the time when soldiers like Han Sen came into play. Back
Gold Group would use its grunts to smoke out the xenogeneic, so
Mister Tiger could be the one to kill it. The soldiers were
expendable.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s team was searching to the south-west. They maintained
formation, holding their shields to the side. They approached their
designated locale slowly.</p>
<p>None of the soldiers would risk their life for the others. The
shields they used were tough, but they’d only survive a few strikes
before breaking, at the most</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out his Northern King Glove and put it in his
pocket. His Spell geno armor was not as powerful as the glove. The
glove was a geno weapon. It was a Noble’s item.</p>
<p>Han Sen figured it was probably low level, but he couldn’t use
its full power regardless.</p>
<p>The soldiers continued to walk past scenes of horrific violence,
but they couldn’t be distracted by the cruelty. Otherwise, they’d
end up just like the townspeople.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very focused, and although his Dongxuan Aura could
not go very far, he felt he was all-around better than the other
soldiers.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>They moved forward slowly, but suddenly, there was a gunshot
from the north. The wind carried the noise of gunshots and the
sound of people shouting.</p>
<p>“Found it! Everyone head for the north-west sector.” The
communicator sounded with a voice.</p>
<p>The captain acknowledged, then instructed the group to turn.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden, Han Sen paused. He detected a shadow
bolting through an alley, headed right for Suo Tu.</p>
<p>Suo Tu was facing the captain, so he was unaware of the shadow
coming right for him.</p>
<p>“Careful!” Han Sen shouted. He ran in front of Suo Tu, but it
was too late to pull the man away. Instead, Han Sen sent a kick
into Suo Tu’s back before leaping away himself.</p>
<p>The black shadow went right past Han Sen and Suo Tu, almost
touching them. When everyone heard it, their faces changed as they
screamed, “Xenogeneic!”</p>
