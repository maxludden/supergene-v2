  The altar was broken, but it no longer had any cracks. It had recovered and looked like new. There was still no Godlight or God Spirit spawning on the altar.

“Thank you so much, Little Brother. This is your reward. I trust we will meet again.” Tai Yi threw something to Han Sen as he walked to the altar.

Han Sen watched the altar shine with a bright light. The light was spreading everywhere. Wherever the Godlight touched, the broken metal buildings appeared to rewind. All the broken pieces rose up and flew backward. The palace was repairing itself.

Suddenly, the entire temple had a bunch of metal pieces flying everywhere. All of the buildings, statues, and tools were recovering as if they were rewinding.

Due to the power of the altar, the entire temple started to tear space. It was heading into space.

Han Sen did not dare follow the temple into space. He exited the temple and watched it recover from outside.

When the temple was 70% to 80% recovered, Han Sen was able to see that the structure of the temple was in the image of a large, metal bird. The big metal bird coldly looked across the universe. It gave people the feeling it would shake its wings and fly for nine nights.

The metal giant bird kind of looked like the sun gold bird Han Sen had killed before, but it was a little bit different.

The temple was becoming more and more complete, and it was going into space. It suddenly disappeared. Han Sen realized that he had not asked Tai Yi any of the questions he wanted to ask.

He lowered his head and looked into his hands. The thing Tai Yi had thrown him was like an egg. It was the size of an egg too. It looked rather heavy and had a metallic sheen to it.

“What the hell? He gave me an egg. Am I supposed to cook it?” Han Sen felt depressed. He did not know the egg’s purpose.

Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to look. He did not see a lifeforce in the egg. It looked like a small art piece that was built from metal.

“I have no idea what the hell Tai Yi is up to. He is so mysterious. He can open the temple, so there is a 90% chance he is the God Spirit of this temple. After looking at his face, he did not seem to look like a God Spirit. This is so weird.” Han Sen did not understand, so he stopped trying to think about it. He put the metal egg away looked around. He still did not understand which direction to head, so he randomly used Galaxy Teleportation. He hoped he would be lucky enough to find a place with people in it. At least, they might be able to confirm his location.

Because he was unable to locate his position, Galaxy Teleportation was dangerous. If Han Sen randomly teleported into a place, he might end up in the giant mouth of some random beast. He might have even ended up inside a hot pot. The worst thing would have been him teleporting into a knife, which would stick in him and cause injuries.

Fortunately, Han Sen’s body was strong. Although it would likely not hurt him, Han Sen was still going to be careful. After teleporting, Han Sen realized that his body was in water. The water was very clean but also very shallow. He saw some jade stairs. He was able to tell that he was in a spring or swimming pool.

Han Sen stood up. His chest was above the water. He looked around. He was in a big fountain in the center of a plaza.

Han Sen was standing in the fountain. A group of boys and girls looked at him with shock. He looked very strange. “Feather?” Han Sen noticed the wings on the backs of the boys and girls. It was a clear indicator that they belonged to the Feather.

After Kong Fei made the Feather a lower race, Han Sen cared little for their existence. He had not expected Galaxy Teleportation to take him to a territory that belonged to the Feather. “This place cannot be Holy Heaven, can it?” Han Sen looked around. He noticed he was not in a xenogeneic space. He was just on a normal planet.

Because Han Sen did not care, he did not even know if Holy Heaven belonged to the Feather. After all, they had become a lower race. If the Feather wanted to keep Holy Heaven, which was a large xenogeneic space, it would be difficult.

Han Sen emerged from the fountain and smiled at a young Feather woman. “Excuse me. What is this place?”.

“This is Songfeather Planet,” the Feather girl replied with shock. “Who are you? Why are you in the fountain?”

Han Sen had never heard of Songfeather Planet before, but there was evidence of advanced technology there. Han Sen got out his phone and connected to the internet. He quickly located his position. He learned that he was on a small planet that was not too far from the big barren systems. Han Sen was in the big barren systems.

“The last sheep head of the Four Sheep Cube was pointing at the big barren systems.” Han Sen felt weird. It seemed to be a different big barren system. It should have been further.

“I thought it was someone so brave daring to enter my Songfeather Planet.” Han Sen suddenly heard someone laughing from far away. He looked in that direction and was instantly happy. He said, “Brother Fei.”

The man smiled evilly. He approached Han Sen. It was Kong Fei, who Han Sen had not seen for a very long time. He did not expect to see him on the border of a planet.

“Time is weird,” Kong Fei said with a sigh. “When I first met you, you were so weak that you could not even talk. I was afraid I could kill you so easily. Now, you are a deified elite.”

“Brother Fei, why are you here?” Han Sen was very curious. Kong Fei had the biggest grudge with the Feather. Everyone knew that. Yet, this place had many Feathers, and Kong Fei was still living there. That was surprising.

“Come. We do not have xenogeneics in the universe, but we have drinks.” Kong Fei did not answer. He led the way forward. Many Feathers greeted and smiled at him. They always referred to him as Brother Fei.

Han Sen quickly noticed the Feather there were all young, and many of them weren’t pure Feathers.

There were many tall trees. There were houses nestled atop the trees. Kong Fei lived inside one such treehouse. He casually sat on the wooden floor and tossed Han Sen a drink. He held the bottle and had a swig. “The Feather became a lower race, and they could not keep Holy Heaven. These are the orphans I collected after the battle.”

Han Sen did not know how to answer him. Kong Fei fought for the rights of himself and his family. He had only managed to knock the Feather down from their perch as one of the higher races. He did not kill them all. That was very kind of him. Yet, he still hadn’t been able to avoid innocent lives being taken. It was hard to say who was in the wrong or right. He could only say that in that big era one could not control fate. It was all in the era’s waves.
