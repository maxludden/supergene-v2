    <p>
      Brother Blind&#8217;s namesake was not derived from any blight of
      blindness. In fact, his vision far exceeded the capabilities of most.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was called Brother Blind, however, because of how much he sought money.
      As long as there was money on offer, he&#8217;d take whatever job or task
      he could. He would commit any sordid deed, even murder, due to his
      blindness in the presence of money.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Brother Blind was powerful, make no mistake. And he could easily kill
      sacred-blood creatures. Even in the royal shelter, no one would dare
      offend him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Kuang wouldn&#8217;t underestimate someone who could present a
      sacred-blood beast soul, so he extended an invitation for Brother Blind to
      come here.
    </p>

    <p>
      As this was occurring, Liu Kuang went to observe Han Sen and Lin Beifeng.
      He couldn&#8217;t discern much about Han Sen and hadn&#8217;t the clue
      what his reputation was. If Han Sen did hail from a big family, he figured
      he&#8217;d have been able to easily recognize the man. Lacking smarts and
      cultural attention, he did not even realize that he was looking at the
      son-in-law of the president.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s appearance was just as Liu Jie described. He looked to be
      twenty years old at the most, and could best be described as another
      typical &#8220;pretty boy.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t look as if he&#8217;d
      endured a single hardship. Seeing the kid now, he thought Liu Jie had
      indeed made a fair and correct judgement of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Kuang was a patient person, however. He was in no rush to strike, and
      he was happy to wait for Brother Blind&#8217;s arrival.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Kuang, they have now left the shelter. When is our time to
      strike?&#8221; After keeping tabs on them for half a day, Liu Jie hastened
      to report their exit from the shelter to Liu Kuang.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Patience. There is no need to rush. Brother Blind is en route. They
      must be heading to a royal shelter, so we&#8217;ll take a detour, meet up
      with Brother Blind, and set a roadblock for them.&#8221; After saying
      this, Liu Kuang assembled a group and left the shelter to enact their
      plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      They walked through a woodland for ten whole miles, before meeting up with
      Brother Blind. They hid along the veiling thickets that skirted the sides
      of the road that led to the royal shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not long after, two people came into sight. They rode on two beasts, and
      just as expected, they were indeed Han Sen and Lin Beifeng.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Blind, that&#8217;s them!&#8221; Liu Jie put away his
      binoculars and spoke, while pointing towards their sought-after prey.
    </p>

    <p>
      Brother Blind did not need to use binoculars, and as he watched the two
      people from afar, a queer look came upon him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;These are the people you have tasked me to deal with?&#8221;
      Brother Blind asked Brother Kuang and Liu Jie, to confirm.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, that is them,&#8221; Liu Jie said.</p>

    <p>Slash!</p>

    <p>
      A soft sword, very much like a ribbon, was drawn by Brother Blind&#8217;s
      hands. Blood coated the sword as Liu Jie&#8217;s head was suddenly flung
      from his shoulders and into the sky. The eyes of the severed head were
      open wide, in a sudden fright and confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Blind, what was that for?&#8221; Liu Kuang and the rest
      were all aghast at the sudden turn of events. In response, they all drew
      their weapons and faced Brother Blind warily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Brother Blind coldly laughed and said, &#8220;I may pursue coin blindly,
      but even I won&#8217;t throw my life away for it. If you have sought to
      task me with a suicide run, then I have no choice but to kill you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Kuang&#8217;s face changed. With shock, he asked, &#8220;Are you
      saying that guy is quite something?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s presence had unknowingly unblinded Brother Blind. For this
      to suddenly happen, a bad feeling crept over Liu Kuang&#8217;s mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He is not just &#8216;something.&#8217; That guy is everything!
      Even your boss could end up working as a grunt below him. And you want to
      finger him for assassination? I admire your boldness and courage.&#8221;
      Brother Blind cackled creepily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Kuang was taken aback. He did not expect a young man such as that to
      possess such a frightening background. He gritted his teeth and said,
      &#8220;Brother Blind, this was our mistake. We almost got you killed. Keep
      the money we were to offer you, but this was Liu Jie&#8217;s fault. How
      about we let sleeping dogs lie and move past this? There is no need to
      upset our relationship.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If that was anybody else, I would take you up on your offer. But
      that person is someone I would give my life to defend. Wanting to kill him
      is worse than wanting to kill me. I cannot spare your lives.&#8221; After
      Brother Blind said that, he moved his soft sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      What hurt the most was not the blade, but the sensations it imparted.
      Brother Blind&#8217;s swordskills were soft and gentle. Every time the
      blade moved, a separate scream would emanate from the woods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not long after, half of Liu Kuang&#8217;s men were dead. They rest were
      trembling in fear, feeling deep regret over what they had proposed to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Kuang was terrified, most of all. He tried to run away but could not.
      He ran five hundred meters before the soft sword pierced through his
      heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could almost sympathize with Liu Kuang, with the look of anguish that
      came upon his face. He wasn&#8217;t given a chance to say anything more
      before being mercilessly slain. He coughed up blood from his agape mouth,
      then he fell down to the earth with his eyes wide open.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of the group were spared. Each person there was either beheaded or
      staked through the heart. One hit, one kill, for each of them. It was a
      cruel and brutal sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Lin Beifeng heard some noises coming from the woods as they
      passed by. Looking to scope it out, Han Sen stumbled across a clearing
      that was strewn with bodies. In their midst, Brother Blind stood wiping
      his sword clean.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s Liu Kuang and Liu Jie! Liu Kuang is Liu Jie&#8217;s boss
      in the royal shelter; how could they&#8230;&#8221; Lin Beifeng was shocked
      upon seeing the corpses all about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly understood what Liu Kuang had sought to do, but what he
      did not know was the identity of the lone man before them. And why he had
      killed them all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you for the help, friend. What is your name?&#8221; Han Sen
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t consider this aid. I was just sparing you the
      trouble.&#8221; Brother Blind let out his signature cackle. It was creepy.
      &#8220;Call me Blind.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do we know each other?&#8221; But Han Sen couldn&#8217;t help but
      frown and ponder the reason for his name. He clearly wasn&#8217;t blind,
      so why did he wish to be called that?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, of course. We do indeed.&#8221; Brother Blind nodded but did
      not explain any further.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was a little puzzled by this curious encounter, so he asked
      another question. &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It does not matter where I come from. What does matter, is
      something important you ought to know,&#8221; Brother Blind said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What?&#8221; Han Sen frowned, thinking this &#8220;Blind&#8221; was
      quite the strange fellow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do not join the Luo family.&#8221; Brother Blind said these words
      slowly, with a grave tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this a warning or a friendly reminder?&#8221; Han Sen asked the
      Blindman.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How you discern my words is up to you.&#8221; Blindman did not
      explain. Instead, he pulled out a bag and tossed it over to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen caught it, and it felt like there was a book or something inside,
      but he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure. The bag was composed of highly-advanced
      cloth.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Practice this when you find the time; it should help.&#8221; After
      that, Blindman turned around and left. He moved quickly, and within a
      second, he disappeared from sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen just stood there, watching the Blindman disappear into the woods.
      He wasn&#8217;t quite sure what he had just been witness to.
