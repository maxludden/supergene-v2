    <p>
      It took them half a day&#8217;s travel, all in all, to reach the foot of
      Thunder Mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every inch closer that they traveled, the dread that the treacherous
      mountain instilled increased. Lightning continued to flash in the skies,
      striking the peak a number of times. Each flash sent a number of broken
      rocks plummeting to the earth below.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Weird. Why are there no creatures around? This is strange.&#8221;
      Lui Gui frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is strange. The last time we came here, there were many other
      creatures. But this time, we haven&#8217;t seen a single one.&#8221; Zhao
      Xuebin was confused, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen jovially thought to himself, &#8220;Duh, that&#8217;s because of
      the silver fox. With this cute little blighter by my side, creatures
      pestering my travel are a thing of the past!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s better without them, isn&#8217;t it? We can freely slay
      the Thunderbull.&#8221; When Han Sen said this, he immediately began
      riding Golden Growler up the mountainside.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In that case, we are depending on you,&#8221; Zhao Xuebin politely
      said to Han Sen. After Han Sen took off, Zhao Xuebin turned around and
      said to his men, &#8220;Be careful; the Thunderbull may appear at any
      second. Maintain vigilance.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes.&#8221; They all answered in unison. Slowly but surely, they
      ascended the mountain in Han Sen&#8217;s dusty wake.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Lightning continued to strike, and not once was there a lull in its
      rhythmic impacts. The thunder repeatedly struck the rocks of the mountain,
      emitting wild showers of sparks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was ahead, but it wasn&#8217;t long before he slowed down. The
      environment was fairly bad and unsuitable for haste. If this was the
      Thunderbull&#8217;s home turf, he knew he&#8217;d have to be more careful,
      as he&#8217;d be at a disadvantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox maintained its excitement by standing on Golden
      Growler&#8217;s head, staring at the peak in the distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      It took them an hour of travel to reach the midway point of the mountain,
      but still, they had yet to come across the Thunderbull they were hunting.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Manager Zhao, perhaps that bull is gone,&#8221; Han Sen suggested
      to Zhao Xuebin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin wore a look of confusion, and he said, &#8220;Whenever we used
      to come here, it would quickly approach our intrusion at the foot of the
      mountain. Even if it was on the peak, it should have descended upon us
      long ago. Today&#8217;s absence of the beast is strange, indeed.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did the Thunderbull really leave this place?&#8221; Lui Gui asked,
      with concern.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s keep going; don&#8217;t drop your guard, though, just
      in case.&#8221; Zhao Xuebin frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had been meaning to slay this Thunderbull for quite some time. They
      had failed a number of times and lost many people in their previous
      attempts. The bull could cast fierce attacks, including AOE strikes; this
      was why they had to approach Han Sen and request his aid. They were at
      their wits end.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the bull had truly gone, then it would be a great loss for them. The
      contract stated that if the bull had vacated the area, then Han Sen was
      eligible to keep half of the proposed vials of Angel Gene Fluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      With great worry, they continued their ascent to the peak. All the while,
      the thunder became worse and worse. Suddenly a bolt of lightning struck a
      rock that was only a few meters away from Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the rock seemed indestructible, and it had not been harmed by the
      lightning. It was still perfectly smooth, and not a single blemish had
      been brought to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they went higher, the frequency of the lightning increased. After
      another hour&#8217;s travel, one bolt struck a man called Feng Lin. He was
      struck while on his mount, and he was almost killed outright. Heavily
      injured, the hair of his head had mostly been burnt away. He was shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the strike wasn&#8217;t too strong, and the man managed to
      stand up after it occurred, much to the surprise of everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone took extra care after that, summoning shields and protective
      armaments for defense against any more renegade bolts of lightning that
      sought to strike them.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was fortunate they did this, as well, due to the increased frequency of
      thunder and lightning. As they ascended, everyone suffered at least one
      lightning strike. Others were unfortunate enough to receive more than one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only Han Sen and his companions did not get shocked, despite how large of
      a target the Golden Growler was. Strangely, the lightning ignored them for
      the duration of their travel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen acknowledged this was the work of the silver fox. Little Silver,
      the thunder master, could bend the will of lightning to avoid itself and
      its companions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hugged the silver fox and quietly said, &#8220;Little Silver,
      could you draw more of the lightning over to them?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox looked at Han Sen and tilted its head, signifying its
      understanding of Han Sen&#8217;s request. Then, a glint of evil birthed in
      its eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox jumped back away from Han Sen&#8217;s chest, returning to
      Golden Growler&#8217;s head. It looked at the thunder streaking across the
      sky.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      A lightning bolt struck perfectly atop Lui Gui&#8217;s head. It shattered
      his armor and knocked him from his ride. He convulsed on the muddy ground,
      twitching in agony.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone stopped to check on his wellbeing. Fortunately for them, they had
      all unlocked their genes locks and were able to withstand such hits.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Manager Zhao, the frequency of lightning increases as we ascend. It
      is likely we will all be injured before we reach the top, and if the bull
      does reside there, our ability to fight will be gone,&#8221; Lui Gui said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin looked at the lightning in the sky, but he knew that if they
      turned back now, they&#8217;d be handing over the Angel Gene Fluid to Han
      Sen for free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then again, they could end up injured or even worse, if they maintained
      their current course, just as Lui Gui said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin gave his conundrum some thought but settled on saying,
      &quot;We are not far from the peak. If we get there and do not find the
      bull, we will return immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he said that, everyone mounted their rides again and continued up
      the treacherous slopes of the mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following this, more and more lightning continued to strike, accurately
      hitting each of the Angel Gene members and injuring them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked ahead to the peak. He could not see anything there yet, but
      he began to sense a powerful lifeforce stemming from there. He knew
      something had to be up there, he was just unsure whether or not it was the
      Thunderbull he had pledged to kill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of what it was, however, Han Sen did not think the others could
      make it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox&#8217;s eyes flashed with silver, in a connection with the
      lightning that streamed across the skies. Every time a new bolt appeared,
      his eyes flashed silver and a scream would erupt from behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is strange; why has the lightning not harmed you once?&#8221;
      They were starting to suspect something was wrong, and after Lui Gui was
      struck again, he couldn&#8217;t hold himself from confronting Han Sen.
