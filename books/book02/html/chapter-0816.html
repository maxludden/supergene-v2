    <p>
      &#8220;I am me; I that swallowed the seed of the Holy Empty. I was reborn.
      My genes advanced and took me to the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary but
      now&#8230; I do not know if I am truly myself.&#8221; The female voice
      sounded heavy and solemn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart leapt at the words, and he asked, &#8220;Are you the
      same as these super creatures?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was referring to the black-flame phoenix and the rest that were
      under the influence of the parasitic force.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fruit moved, and then the female voice spoke again. &#8220;After
      thousands of years, the Empty Vine bears fruit. They are reborn and their
      genes have improved. But who knows if they are still themselves right
      now?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought to himself, &#8220;The emotions of this Empty Fruit
      don&#8217;t seem too stable. If I play my cards right, maybe I can
      escape.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking this, he told the Empty Fruit, &#8220;If you feel this way, why
      do you force others to swallow the Holy Seeds?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman responded, &#8220;If I am born, I can open the gate to the Third
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary. And then, I will leave the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary and the Empty Vine will die. If I do not leave behind seeds,
      there would not be any Holy Vines.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am me, and I am also the Holy Vine. Even though I exist here, it
      is difficult for me to control my natural function of producing
      offspring.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know what to say. Right now, she wasn&#8217;t completely
      herself. She was once a super creature but now, half of her body was
      composed of the Empty Vine&#8217;s genes.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a super creature that was created through the union of animals and
      plants. It was difficult to imagine it being in the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What were you before?&#8221; Han Sen couldn&#8217;t help but ask,
      as a super creature such as this was sure to have some history.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was an Empty Spirit Witch. I am still an Empty Spirit
      Witch.&#8221; The voice spoke with assuredness, and it went on to say,
      &#8220;I have already answered your questions. Can you give him over to me
      now?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have to be honest with you, I really don&#8217;t know what it is
      that you want. If you told it to me straight, I could have given it to you
      much earlier,&#8221; Han Sen tested.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I want your Plant of a Holy Spirit. There is nothing else you can
      provide, that I see value in,&#8221; the Empty Spirit Witch said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Plant of a Holy Spirit?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart jumped and he
      presented her his gourd. Then he asked, &#8220;Is this it? Is this what
      you want?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Empty Spirit Witch confirmed. And then, the vine moved
      to take the gourd from Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hang on.&#8221; Han Sen pulled back his hand and then said,
      &#8220;At least tell me why you want it.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The Empty Spirit Witch seemed upset by the question that was posed and
      said, &#8220;For some reason, it did not grow as it should have. I am
      going to help it grow again, this time to its fullest.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen froze, not expecting her to feel this way about it. When he first
      received the gourd, the gourd and the vines it clung to were dry and had
      almost died. What she said sort of made sense, and it didn&#8217;t seem as
      if she was lying.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you saying the gourd is like you? There is a super creature
      inside?&#8221; Han Sen recalled the giant, vine-wreathed bones that lay
      near the gourd. If the gourd created a giant creature similar to that,
      things would surely prove interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      She denied Han Sen&#8217;s thinking and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s different.
      It is a pure Plant of a Holy Spirit. It is special and it cannot be
      compared with me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Where is it from?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      He wasn&#8217;t willing to give up the gourd, as it was something he
      played with almost every day. He had grown quite attached to enigma. And
      if it was truly a Holy Spirit that was still growing, it wasn&#8217;t
      something he&#8217;d be quite willing to just hand over.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had always been a greedy person, and unless death was certain, he
      wouldn&#8217;t hand over his treasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I can sense its holy presence. I cannot
      tell where it is from,&#8221; the Empty Spirit Witch said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If it is not the same as you, then why do you want it?&#8221; Han
      Sen asked, looking at Empty Witch Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      She seemed to be annoyed by the barrage of questions and no longer
      answered him. Instead, she said, &#8220;That is none of your business;
      just give it to me!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, the vine came again at Han Sen&#8217;s hand. In response, he
      took two steps back and evaded it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This infuriated the Empty Spirit Witch, and now her vines came out of the
      ground like dragons. They netted the sky once more, attempting to deny Han
      Sen any chance of escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you would enter the Third God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary once you are born? How can you help this grow? It is not
      something you can do in a single day!&#8221; Han Sen shouted, and readied
      himself to summon the little angel.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he couldn&#8217;t talk his way out of this, then fighting his way out
      was the only option. He wasn&#8217;t willing to hand over the gourd.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen was willing to put up a fight and beat her, then there&#8217;d
      be no stopping him. Furthermore, if he did destroy the super creature,
      he&#8217;d be defeating one that was on the precipice of entering the
      Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was afraid of the four other super creatures that were nearby.
      The Holy Seeds were growing inside them, and although they were rooted
      down on the peak, there was no telling whether or not they could join the
      fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even so, Han Sen steeled himself for battle. But when the Empty Spirit
      Witch heard what he said, she quelled her aggression and said, &#8220;What
      you say makes sense. I will be born soon, and it will be difficult for me
      to stay here. I can&#8217;t take care of it.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly replied by saying, &#8220;Then how about you let me take
      care of it? I have already been taking good care of it; in fact, I treat
      this gourd as well as I would my own son. I keep it fed, and it has even
      had the opportunity to drink up countless gallons of super creature
      blood.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen painted himself in the most positive light possible, as if he
      wanted to adopt a poor child into a wealthy family.
    </p>

    <p>
      She seemed touched by his words, and then, the baby inside the fruit
      opened its eyes. Emerald eyes peered right at him. She looked at Han Sen
      and the silver fox that rested on his shoulder, and then looked at the
      fairy inside his pocket. After a while of examining his person, she said,
      &#8220;Okay. You will take care of him. But he will be born with an
      incomplete gene. It will be difficult for this thing to be born,
      regardless of how much super creature blood it drinks. Wait here. When I
      am born, I will provide it with Empty Spirit blood. By doing that, I will
      repair its flaws.&#8221;
