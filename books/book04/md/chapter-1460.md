  Han Sen looked around. Rainflower Planet had Rainflower Trees all across it. There were countless places to watch the blossoming of the trees, from the plains to the mountains. There was no particular need for them to relinquish their position.

Han Sen checked the man out and coldly told him, “There are many other places here to sit. Demigod Qiuming doesn’t have to sit here, does he?”

Wang Gukai maintained his composed demeanor and replied, “You misunderstand me. Demigod Qiuming likes the quiet. So, it was our hope we could provide him a pleasant environment to view the flowers in tranquil solace.”

Han Sen looked around and noticed many other workers around them, probably asking all the other visitors to vacate the area.

Some visitors were obliging and moving, while others stood up to argue. Most people were inclined to move, however, out of respect for the man being a demigod.

Wang Gukai carried on, hoping to convince Han Sen. “I hope you can understand. We are willing to pay you any price you name.”

“Forget it. Let’s go. I don’t want to stay here if that’s the case,” Ji Yanran said.

Han Sen nodded. They were out there to relax, and there was no need for them to have an argument. What was most important to them, on that day, was keeping their spirits high.

There were many other places to view the flowers, so there was no need to fight with the dogs, as Han Sen thought of them. It’d only damage his image.

Han Sen and Ji Yanran were about ready to move, but before they packed their things, they suddenly heard some arguing. Han Sen and Ji Yanran looked over and saw a young couple arguing with one of the workers, just like Wang Gukai.

The wife was sitting on the ground crying, while the husband was standing, yelling at the worker with red eyes. “What’s wrong with you people?! I told you my wife is pregnant and can’t move much. How can you ask us to move in this condition?”

The worker coldly responded, “Kid, do you want to be an enemy of demigod Qiuming?”

“So, what? Can they do as they please? We’re not moving, not for any price. Get lost!” The young man had gotten really riled up.

The worker was getting annoyed by the reluctance, so he spoke to a machine. Then, many of the other workers came over to that spot, pulling the family away from their spot.

Han Sen frowned, seeing this. Ji Yanran ran up to that kerfuffle and shouted, “What’s wrong with you people? Is this how you treat a pregnant woman?”

Wang Gukai stopped Ji Yanran going any closer and frowned. He said, “This is none of your business. If I were you, I’d step away and simply leave. Especially when you’re stepping on the toes of a demigod.”

“So? Demigods are still average citizens. They can’t subvert the system.” Ji Yanran pushed him out of her way and continued forward to the hassled couple.

“What’s wrong? Demigod Qiuming will be here soon. You lot are still arguing?” A middle-aged man approached them on a flying chair. He was frowning a lot.

“Boss, there’s an incident. There’s a couple refusing to sell their spot,” Wang Gukai said.

“Give them whatever they want, just get them gone.” The middle-aged man looked annoyed.

“The young couple said they don’t want money,” Wang Gukai said.

The young husband said, “Your money can’t do anything. I don’t want your stinky money!”

When the middle-aged man heard this, he smirked. “We respect you enough to offer you money for moving. The whole of Rainflower Planet belongs to me, Zhou Changlong; I can throw you out without giving you a dime.”

Ji Yanran was upset seeing their mistreatment. “Even if the planet does belong to you, you’ve charged the visitors here. You can’t kick them out.”

“My place, my rules. You can sue me if you don’t like it, but not right now. You need to get a move on,” Zhou Changlong coldly told her.

“And what if I don’t go?” Ji Yanran responded, equally cold.

“If you are unwilling to move, then I’ll simply force you out.” Zhou Changlong waved his hand. Then, some workers approached Ji Yanran, while more came for the young couple.

Han Sen wanted to laugh, unsure who this Zhou Changlong clown was. The fact that the man didn’t know who Ji Yanran was told Han Sen one thing: this guy wasn’t as big as he was making himself out to be.

The real big players would know who Ji Yanran was.

If he didn’t know she was the president of President Ji, they should at least know she was the wife of Han Sen.

Han Sen wasn’t going to let his wife get bullied, however. So, he grabbed one of the worker’s arms and immediately dislocated the man’s shoulder.

One step, one person. After a dozen steps, a dozen workers were writhing on the ground in agony.

“Do you have any idea who you are assaulting?” Zhou Changlong did not seem surprised, and he laughed.

“Your people?” Han Sen smiled.

Zhou Changlong pointed at the workers and said, “Young people are very reckless. If I were you, I’d run. If demigod Qiuming was here and saw his brother-in-law getting threatened like this, not even the likes of President Ji could save you.”

“So, you are demigod Qiuming’s uncle?” Han Sen thought about what he said and knew what he was implying.

Han Sen wasn’t stupid. Others wouldn’t say something like this. He realized Zhou Changlong was talking about himself.

“Not bad.” Zhou Changlong coldly continued. “You still want to go through with this?”

Han Sen laughed. “Did you say even President Ji couldn’t quell Qiuming’s wrath?”

“Yeah, have you got something to say about that?” Zhou Changlong said, with a face of twisted pride.

“No problem. Qiuming does seem powerful, but my wife is, too. If she’s angry, even President Ji would be afraid.” Han Sen laughed.

“What nonsense are you trying to sell me?” Zhou Changlong looked at Han Sen with disdain. Han Sen and Ji Yanran were very young themselves, and he believed them to be surpassers at best.

“It’s true.” A voice rung out from afar, as an old man came down from the hills.

“Brother-in-law!” Zhou Changlong greeted the old man with a smile.
