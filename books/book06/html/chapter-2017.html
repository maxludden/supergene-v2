<p>“Okay, you can go.” The leader of Sky Palace waved his hand,
indicating Han Sen could leave.</p>
<p>Cough cough. “Mister Leader, you are so powerful. With a flick
of your fingers, you can inhibit all my movements. That is
impressive.” Han Sen’s feet did not move.</p>
<p>It felt as if his body was carrying a mountain. He could barely
stand.</p>
<p>Sky Palace leader squinted his eyes, looked at Han Sen, and
said, “This is my reward for you. If you do not leave, I will
reward you more.”</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around and departed, swearing to God he would
never come and see that man again.</p>
<p>“Fuck! What is this reward? I did a great service to these
people. It’d be fine if they didn’t want to reward me, but making
me feed horses? I don’t want to feed your f*cking horses.” After
Han Sen left Sky Palace, he repeatedly swore in his heart.</p>
<p>Walking out of Sky Palace made Han Sen all sweaty. He did not
know what geno art was being used on him, but it felt like he was
bearing a great weight on his back. He could withstand it, but he
was not able to run. All he could do was walk.</p>
<p>“What is it? What did the leader give you?” Thousand Feather
Crane asked, coming forward eagerly.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about it. When my master was in Sky Palace, did
she offend the leader in some way?” Han Sen thought that it must be
Yisha’s fault that he was being treated so poorly.</p>
<p>“Why do you ask that? The leader loved her the most. He took her
as a student, so everyone knows that,” Thousand Feather Crane
said.</p>
<p>That is strange. If my master was that loved, then why did he
not reward me? He used a weird geno art to suppress my body, and
he’s now making me feed his horses.” Han Sen frowned, and then went
on to say, “Is he really mad that he could not take me on as a
student, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Thousand Feather Crane asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen told him his story. Thousand Feather Crane heard it all,
and when the story was finished, his mouth had fallen wide open. He
looked at Han Sen as if he had just seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that this is a little much?” Han Sen also
thought to himself, “I only complained in my mind, so why is he
going this far?”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane gave Han Sen a strange look. “You are
lucky. The geno art you were put under is Sky Heart Lock. It is a
part of the Textless Book. King classes can barely make use of it,
and they often end up damaged. If they did not have the right
blood, they wouldn’t even try to use it. It is difficult to find
someone that knows about Textless Book and sacrifices. The leader
has used it twice on you, and not even Lone Bamboo was subjected to
that.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt his eyebrows rise. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Sky Heart Lock is no secret here. It locks down your
body, and you have to use your own power to break free. Do it, and
your fitness and air can increase. You know how important the
basics are. You can do this to become stronger, and it won’t affect
your leveling up progress. Many people would actually enjoy that.
You’ve received it twice, and here you are complaining. It makes me
want to hit you.” Thousand Feather Crane looked jealous.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at him strangely and said, “What about feeding
the horses? That can’t be good.”</p>
<p>“If I am correct, the horse you’ll be feeding is the Dream
Beast. I cannot tell you if that is good or bad, though,” Thousand
Feather Crane said, after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>While they were talking, a butler-like man approached. He bowed
to Han Sen and said, “Brother Han, the leader has requested that I
take you to Dream Island. You will have to work for Dream Beast for
three months. Can you go now or must you pack?”</p>
<p>“Brother, can I go tomorrow?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Sure, I’ll pick you up tomorrow.” The man smiled.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot.” Han Sen turned back to Thousand Feather Crane
and said, “Old Crane, find me a way to get back to Jade Island.
With my weight, the legless crane cannot carry me.”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane laughed and said, “Don’t worry, the lock
is only clamping down on your body. It hasn’t increased your
weight. Your mount won_t suffer because of it.__</p>
<p>Han Sen had no choice but to believe him. He climbed atop the
crane with his heavy body. The crane felt nothing, and it took off
into flight as it usually did.</p>
<p>The bird had eaten many pieces of high class xenogeneic meat. It
was really strong, and it was flying a little faster than it had in
the beginning.</p>
<p>Its speed had only increased a little, though. Its wings were
still injured, and so it couldn’t fly entirely straight. It
couldn’t go too fast.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was back at little Jade Island, he used all kinds
of powers to try to remove the lock that had been placed upon him.
Aside from using super god spirit mode, he tried everything at his
disposal and failed to unlock it.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no choice now but to pack. The next day, the butler
took him to Dream Island.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know much about Dream Beast. He knew it was a
deified xenogeneic, though, and Lone Bamboo had endured the
nightmares given to him by this creature.</p>
<p>“Is that old man going to make the Dream Beast give me ten
thousand nightmares? I don’t want to experience those things. My
life is a happy story. There is no need for tragedy,” Han Sen
thought with fright.</p>
<p>It took Lone Bamboo ten years to wake up. Even if Han Sen was
stronger, it’d still take a few years. And by then, Ling’er
wouldn’t even know who her father was. That would be sad.</p>
<p>“No, no! I cannot have a nightmare. I need to talk to that old
man again.” Han Sen turned around, wanting to leave.</p>
<p>But then, all of a sudden, a gravelly, monstrous voice said from
behind him, “Who said you could leave?”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body froze stiff. He slowly turned back around, and at
the center of a mirror-like lake, a white unicorn-like creature was
emerging.</p>
<p>It might have been the greatest xenogeneic Han Sen had ever
seen, but when he looked into its eyes, Han Sen felt chills roll
through him. Looking at the creature did not make him feel
good.</p>
<p>The dreamy blue eyes, however, were smiling. Even so, they gave
him goosebumps.</p>
<p>“Ahaha. Mister Dream… The leader sent me here to check on
whether or not you need anything. If there is something you
require, I will report it to the leader and bring it here,” Han Sen
said quickly. He thought he should get out now.</p>
<p>“I see. There is something I need. Come here.” The Dream Beast
stepped onto the grass, smiling at Han Sen.</p>
