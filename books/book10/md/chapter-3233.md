“Please tell me, Mister Han,” Qin Jing Zhen seriously said. “I have already told you that if it does not hurt the Qin Kingdom, I would do anything for this.”

Han Sen thought for a moment and said, “There are legends in the Qin Kingdom that claim there is a gene race called the dark big evil dragon king. It has the coldest power and most Yin. If you can give me that gene race, there is a 100% guarantee that I will be able to extend your life for at least three years. If you are lucky, you will have another five years to live.”

When Qin Jing Zhen heard about the dark big evil dragon king, his face changed. Before Qin Jing Zhen could speak, a cold voice sounded from the screen behind him. “The dark big evil dragon king is the Qin Kingdom’s country-suppressing God Spirit gene race. For what purpose do you want that item?”

While they were talking, the voice of an overbearing, white-haired old man was heard. He appeared by walking out of a screen. He had a grand lifeforce. It was very scary. The sense of suppression he exuded was like that of a mountain.

The white-haired, old man’s power was shocking. His eyes were like those of a knife as he peered at Han Sen. He was far more overbearing than Qin Jing Zhen.

Han Sen, however, did not react. He did not look at the old man with white hair. It was like he did not exist.

Even a Reboot God Spirit and Qin Xiu, those types of elites, could not make Han Sen quiver and obey. He was just a Qin Kingdom elite. “Please, do not be mad,” Qin Jing Zhen politely said to the old man with white hair. “Mister Han saved my life, and he saved my son’s life. He is not someone evil.”

“My King, you can never tell the true face of a person,” the old man with white hair coldly said. “There are many things you should exercise caution with. The wounds on your body are something an Annihilation God Spirit is unable to do anything about, and this man is just an average mister. He says he has skills that are as grand as a sky. Can he be better than the Annihilation God Spirits that safeguard the Qin family?” He did not really care for Qin Jing Zhen’s feelings.

After that, Han Sen was surprised. He looked at the old man with white hair. He did not know who he was or how he was permitted to talk to Qin Jing Zhen in such a way.

According to theory, the Qin Kingdom should have had Qin Jing Zhen as the highest figure of authority. Even if the power of some elites was greater than Qin Jing Zhen, they would still have to care for Qin Jing Zhen’s feelings when they addressed him.

Qin Jing Zhen quietly said, “There must be valid reasons for Mister Han requiring the dark big evil dragon king. Let’s just allow Mister Han to explain himself.”

“It does not matter what reasons he has, but the dark big evil dragon king cannot be used by outsiders,” the old man with white hair confidently said. It was like his words were a decree of the highest order.

Qin Jing Zhen’s face looked cold, but he still tried to keep his cool and not flip a lid. “I would not give the dark big evil dragon king to outsiders on a whim. You think way too much. If there is nothing constructive you would like to tell me, I suggest you just go back. I still have many things I wish to tell Mister Han.”

The old man with white hair stared at Han Sen and said, “Whatever you say does not matter. I will not permit the dark big evil dragon king to be given to anyone. It can only be a treasure of the Qin family and no other!”

After that, the old man with white hair turned around and left. He did not bow to Qin Jing Zhen. The words he said were meant for Qin Jing Zhen.

“My King, do you mind telling me who that person was?” Han Sen was upset by what that man said.

The dark big evil dragon king was very famous in the Qin Kingdom. It was the coldest gene race with the most Yin. Han Sen had only heard about it, but he thought he could use it with Jadeskin. If he did that, he would not have to go to the Chu Kingdom to get another super god pulse. The dark big evil dragon king was a rare gene race. It was also a God Spirit gene race. It was better than an Annihilation God Spirit. If he used it to practice Cold Sutra, it would surely save him a lot of bother.

Qin Jing Zhen wanted to live, so he would consider handing it over no matter how grand a gene race was. It was not as important as the fact of being able to live.

Now, there was that old man who had upset Han Sen. It made Han Sen’s plan get ruined. He had failed.

“He is the Qin family’s elder. I do not know how long he has lived, but he is the base of the Qin family.” Qin Jing Zhen only said that. He did not say anything else. He clearly did not want to talk about the old man any further. Qin Jing Zhen looked at him and said, “Mister Han, you want the dark big evil dragon king. Does this really have something to do with healing me?”

Han Sen was not going to lie. He shook his head. “It is actually not related to it. If I am forced to heal your wounds, it will cost me a lot of energy. No offense, but you are neither my friend nor my family. There is no reason for me to hurt myself to save you. If it was not for the crown prince being my friend, even if you gave me your rare gene race, I might not care about you.”

“You are a very honest man.” When Qin Jing Zhen heard that, he felt more relaxed.

If Han Sen really wanted nothing, then that would be really weird. It would have been pretty hard to understand.

“Mister Han, do you really need the dark big evil dragon king? That is our kingdom-suppressing God Spirit gene race. Even I cannot use it casually. If you only need the gene race, I have a gene race that is no inferior to the dark big evil dragon king.” Qin Jing Zhen did not keep talking, but what he wanted to say was obvious.

Han Sen said, “The dark big evil dragon king is not really what I require. I need a pure gene race that has the Yin and the cold, or the Yin and the soft power. I wonder if you have a gene race like that.”

Qin Jing Zhen looked troubled. He receded into deep thought. His eyes eventually went bright. “I do not have a gene race like that, but I know where you might be able to find one. That gene race is not owned by anyone either. The gene race’s power and skills are just like the dark big evil dragon king. Truth be told, it might even be better. With Mister Han’s skills, it might be possible to claim it.” “What kind of gene race is it?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

It was a strong gene race, and it was not owned by anyone. Han Sen was able to claim it. That just sounded strange.

Qin Jing Zhen was a cool man. Even in the middle of a life-or death-crisis, he was still able to smile and say, “That gene race is called Mirror Moon.”

“Does that mean mirror flower water moon?” Han Sen thought about the name. It sounded soft. It was like a water-element gene race. Qin Jin Zhen shook his head and said, “Mirror Moon isn’t about the mirror flower water moon. This gene race has nothing to do with water. I cannot tell you what kind of gene race it is, but its power should be related to Yin and coldness.”

“The heart is like a mirror. It is like it reflects the moon. Without a doubt, and understanding destiny, the two words came from a great man who once belonged to the great, forgotten man. That is where the name Mirror Moon came from.” Qin Jing Zhen’s face looked weird. “Which great man was that?” Han Sen thought. “It could not be Qin Xiu.”

“Night God No Moon.” When Qin Xiu said the name, he looked even weirder. “Perhaps you have never heard of that name before, but she is a great person in the history of the Qin Kingdom.
