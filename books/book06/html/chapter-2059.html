<p>“You can really only remain a Stone Cow for another two days?”
Xius asked, looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“Then this is pretty bad. I said I wanted a Seawing Beast for a
mount, and so Dragon Fifteen invited me to an island where they
live. I cannot leave before I do this. Otherwise, he might grow
suspicious,” Xius said.</p>
<p>“How long will this take?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“From my estimates, I’d say three days,” Xius said.</p>
<p>“Fine. Three days. If we’re not out in three days, we die
together. My life is cheap, so it’d be an honor for me to die
beside a beautiful Gana princess.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Xius looked at Han Sen, but she was speechless. The limit of
only being able to shapeshift for another two days was a lie. She
couldn’t be certain what was fact or fiction with him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not ask anything more about why Xius was
investigating him. He wanted to wait until they were free and clear
before resuming that particular discussion.</p>
<p>Xius was not dumb, though. She knew that Han Sen knew, so she
never felt secure near him. If Han Sen did not have the Gana’s
kiss, Xius would not have wanted to send him out.</p>
<p>Seawing Beasts rested atop the cliffs upon an island. There were
many caves in those cliffsides, and they lived in such pockets.
Seawing Beasts looked like blue leopards, with two blue wings. The
adults could grow to be twenty meters long.</p>
<p>Although they were only a Marquise class xenogeneic, they flew
extraordinarily quickly, and they performed well on land and water,
too. They were one of the top Marquise mounts one could obtain.</p>
<p>Right now, it was Seawing Beast breeding season. Dragon Fifteen
wished to get Xius one of their eggs. The adults of that species
were too wild and could not be tamed.</p>
<p>The battleship might have disturbed the creatures if it got too
close, so they made sure to stop one hundred miles away. Dragon
Fifteen walked to the island where the Seawing Beasts lived.</p>
<p>Xius sat atop the Stone Cow that was Han Sen, looking very
elegant.</p>
<p>“She must be doing this on purpose,” Han Sen thought grumpily.
She was there to collect a new mount for herself. She could have
totally left Han Sen back on the ship, but nope. She decided to
ride him there.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to endure it, though. And he took comfort in knowing
he could get her back when he made it out.</p>
<p>“Xius, they are Marquise class. Seawing Beasts are much better
than this stupid Stone Cow.” Dragon Fifteen saw one of the Seawing
Beasts fly by, and he smiled.</p>
<p>“They are very nice Marquise mounts, but they are difficult to
tame. Unlike this Stone Cow.” Xius smiled.</p>
<p>“Brother, you do not understand. The Stone Cow is dumb, and
that’s why it is so cute. I would like one, too. But I haven’t been
able to find another.” Dragon Nineteen still really wanted one for
herself. She had gone in search of one, but sadly, found
nothing.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen looked at Han Sen and said, “It’s just a Stone
Cow. If you like it that much, Nineteen, just ask Xius to give it
to you. Xius is always so nice, so I am sure she wouldn’t
disappoint you.”</p>
<p>After that, Dragon Fifteen looked at Xius seriously and said,
“Xius, I only have one sister, and my sister really likes that dumb
creature. I will trade you a Firebeast for it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt terrible. That Dragon Fifteen was way too smart.
Just hearing Dragon Nineteen, he grew a suspicion.</p>
<p>“If Nineteen likes it that much, she can just take it. There is
no need to sully our relationship with trading.” Xius knew what
Fifteen was attempting, so she maintained her cool and smiled.</p>
<p>“Really Xius?” Dragon Nineteen asked giddily.</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s just a Marquise mount, and it was tamed in your
Return Ruin Sea. It is fine by me,” Xius smiled.</p>
<p>“Thank you, sister. But you will have to accept Fifteen’s
Firebeast. Otherwise, I’ll feel poorly about this.” Dragon Nineteen
smiled.</p>
<p>This woman just cleared herself of distrust.” Han Sen felt sad,
but he knew that there was no other choice. If Xius hadn’t made the
trade, Dragon Fifteen would have grown suspicious.</p>
<p>But now that they had made the trade, Han Sen couldn’t use Xius
to leave.</p>
<p>“I will have to make it up as I go along. If Dragon Nineteen
sends Xius away, I might have an opportunity to rush out,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>“Little Cow, you’re mine.” Dragon Nineteen held Han Sen’s head
and rubbed his cheeks. She really adored the thing.</p>
<p>“If I knew this was to happen, I wouldn’t have acted all cute,”
Han Sen thought in depression.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen, seeing this, lost his suspicion. He accompanied
Xius to the cliffs and had Long Ying obtain some Seawing Eggs from
a cave for her. He gave Xius and Dragon Nineteen two eggs each.</p>
<p>After they returned to the battleship, Dragon Nineteen pulled
Han Sen into her room.</p>
<p>Dragon Nineteen really loved the Stone Cow. She rolled around
with him and even slept with him. He was like a giant toy for her.
Due to Dragon Nineteen taking Han Sen everywhere, however, he could
not rest. If things proceeded this way, he’d only last four
days.</p>
<p>Three days went by, but there was still no movement from Xius.
Han Sen almost wanted to expose himself, but then he heard Dragon
Nineteen mention that Xius was leaving.</p>
<p>Dragon Nineteen was going to send Xius off with her. This made
Han Sen very happy, but the bad thing was that Dragon Fifteen and
Long Ying were leaving at the same time.</p>
<p>“I only have one shot at this, and I’m leaving Return Ruin Sea
no matter what! I will kill whoever is in my way,” Han Sen thought
angrily.</p>
<p>The battleship was headed for Return Ruin Sea’s exit. It took
half a day for it to reach there, and luckily, Han Sen was still in
his Stone Cow form.</p>
<p>People thought Han Sen had already made it out of Return Ruin
Sea, but there were still many Duke class guards standing around.
Han Sen could see at least ten Dukes. That was far too many for him
to handle.</p>
<p>Those Dukes were not pure Dragons, but they couldn’t have been
that weak if they were selected to stand there as security.
Fortunately, there were no King class sorts in the vicinity. If
there was, he really couldn’t risk this.</p>
<p>What made Han Sen most depressed was that Dragon Fifteen was not
walking Xius out. They stopped at the exit, and seeing Xius walk
out of Return Ruin Sea, Han Sen had no choice but to force his way
after her.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Stone Cow stomped the ground, sending out a wave of
petrification.</p>
