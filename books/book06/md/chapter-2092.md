  In the base, Han Sen was led to two puddles of black water. It was the same manner of death that the others had died. When Han Sen scanned the area, he could only detect traces of the Taurus and Kahn. There were also some Night Ghost substances, but there was nothing beyond that.

After checking all the cameras, they could not locate the murderer. Those two Taurus officers had died in their rooms.

From the security feeds, no one else had been seen entering the rooms. And the locked doors showed no signs of forced entry, until they were broken down when rescuers had entered to search for the missing Taurus. There were no other creatures around. Nothing else had shown up.

Just as with the other victims, there were no clues to be found.

Han Sen was not a detective, and he planned on letting Lone Bamboo be the one to handle this matter. Before Han Sen took his leave, he turned back to Kahn.

“Marquise Kahn, may I ask why you are here?”

Kahn’s expression did not change, and he calmly said, “Because the Night Ghosts ordered something quite expensive. Because of that, I delivered the goods myself. I didn’t expect things like this would transpire after my arrival.”

“May I know what these expensive goods are?” Han Sen asked.

“I am sorry, but we are committed to the privacy of our customers. If you would like to know what the items are, you will have to speak with Sleepless Duke,” Kahn said.

Han Sen nodded, and he readied himself to leave. After walking two steps, he stepped back. “Have those products been delivered?”

“Yes,” Kahn affirmed.

“Thanks.” Han Sen then left the Taurus base.

“Are you famous?” Li Duo asked Han Sen as they walked back.

Kahn knew who Han Sen was, and he had been quite polite to him. It surprised her. The only other person who received such deference from Kahn was Sleepless Duke herself, from what Li Duo could recall.

But when Li Duo thought about the way Kahn had treated Han Sen, it was more like Kahn was simply wary of him.

“Not really. It’s just because I killed a Demon that they focus on me. They kind of hate me.” Han Sen laughed.

“I see.” Li Duo was surprised.

Han Sen looked at Li Duo and randomly said, “It looks like you’re close with Kahn.”

Li Duo blushed. “Not very close. He and my mother conduct trade negotiations in Night Ring 12th Street, and he has beaten a few of our strongest warriors in an event. It’s how I recognize him.”

“What did your mother buy that required a Marquise Demon to deliver it?” Han Sen asked.

“I don’t know.” Li Duo shook her head.

Han Sen asked a few other questions, then returned to the Duke manor with Bao’er to look for Lone Bamboo. When Han Sen tracked down Lone Bamboo’s room, he found the man taking a nap.

“What did you find?” Han Sen asked.

“There is a problem with Sleepless Duke,” Lone Bamboo said with certainty, opening his eyes.

“What problem?” Han Sen quickly asked.

“I do not know, but I can tell she is hiding something. With my power, I can’t uncover whatever she is refusing to reveal,” Lone Bamboo said coldly.

Han Sen told Lone Bamboo what he had found, and Lone Bamboo sighed. “As far as I can tell, Night Ghosts need sustenance to survive. But they only eat fresh food. They don’t eat anything that has been dead for more than a day. The Taurus bring them living stock. Because of the Sky Palace ruling, the living creatures need to be killed before reaching Night Ring 12th Street. Nothing alive can go there.”

“Why does that matter?” Han Sen said.

“Night Ghost is a disturbing race that dines on flesh, but as for why they must eat goods that are alive… It’s not as simple as filling their stomachs. They don’t just eat meat. They consume something we don’t quite understand. The best comparison we can make is that they eat the souls of their prey.”

“Souls?” Han Sen was surprised. So far, no one had proved souls actually existed.

“It’s just a description. When Night Ghosts eat, they can absorb a mysterious substance. It boosts their levels, and especially the strength of their wills. There was a Night Ghost Duke that had a will that was stronger than a King class,” Lone Bamboo sad.

Han Sen was surprised, and he said, “Even better than a King class? Was it deified or half-deified?”

“It should have been a half-deified.” Lone Bamboo continued to say, “But evolving that way is like cheating. Their minds grow confused, and their own souls might merge with the consumed creature’s. They go crazy and become filled with bloodlust. They can even kill their own families. So, Sky Palace forbids them from eating creatures that are alive.”

You think Kahn gave something alive to Sleepless Duke?” Han Sen now understood his line of thinking.

Lone Bamboo nodded and said, “It’s just a guess. Sky Palace keeps a keen eye on things here, though. They check all creatures that are ferried to Night Ring 12th Street. Things have run smoothly for years, but maybe the guard slipped up, and now someone is taking advantage of things. Like you said, Kahn’s presence seems suspicious. What item delivery might require the supervision of a Demon?”

“This is all possible, but why would the Demon agree to this? Do you think this is all connected to the murders on Planet Night Ghost?” Han Sen asked quietly.

“I’m not sure, but we will have to ask her,” Lone Bamboo said coldly.

“Will she admit to this?” Even if she was involved, Han Sen didn’t think it was likely that she’d just volunteer that information.

“She has no choice,” Lone Bamboo replied calmly.

Han Sen slumped his shoulders. He wasn’t good at this sort of thing, so he was just going to follow Lone Bamboo’s lead.

Lone Bamboo wanted to find her right away, but the people of Duke manor told him she was out. It took another two hours before they had the chance to see her again.
