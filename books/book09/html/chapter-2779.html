	<p>Han Sen had noticed the same thing. Violet was the only Flower God they had seen this entire time. The only other
		people around them were members of other races. Since being in the Space Garden, they had yet to see a single
		other Flower God.</p>

	<p>This was the home of the Flower Gods. Even if something had happened, they still should have been encountering
		other members of Violet’s race.</p>

	<p>Everyone had warning sirens blaring in their heads. They followed Violet carefully as they flew through the Space
		Garden, but they didn’t see anything dangerous around.</p>

	<p>And there was no sign of a battle, either. It looked as if nothing concerning had actually happened.</p>

	<p>But when they reached the highest flower field, what they saw froze them in place.</p>

	<p>They saw many men and women with their bodies buried in the field. Only half their heads were sticking up above
		the soil. Each of them had a flower on their heads. Some of them were peonies, and some looked like
		chrysanthemums. Each flower was unique, and they all looked like they were opening in bloom.</p>

	<p>Clearly, the people who looked like carrots in the flower fields were the missing Flower Gods.</p>

	<p>“Violet, what is this?” Bai Wanjie asked Violet.</p>

	<p>The Flower Gods buried in the ground were still alive, but they were as still as half-buried vegetables.</p>

	<p>Ever so slowly, their lifeforces seemed to be waning.</p>

	<p>“I’m not going to lie to you, Mr. Crown Prince. The whole of the Flower Gods, myself excluded, are here,” Violet
		said as he pointed at the half-buried heads in the field.</p>

	<p>Bai Wanjie didn’t ask how the Flower Gods had ended up in such a strange situation. Instead, he asked Violet,
		“Before you left the Space Garden, were they already buried this way?”</p>

	<p>“You are very smart, Mr. Crown Prince.” Violet nodded and admitted this to be the case.</p>

	<p>“So, when you said that the Flower Gods wanted to become a higher place, it was all a lie? A trick that you used
		to lure us here?” Bai Wanjie asked, staring at Violet.</p>

	<p>“Yes.” Violet nodded again. He clearly didn’t intend to hide anything.</p>

	<p>Violet and Bai Wanjie just stared at each other. They didn’t look away. Violet went on to say, “Although I lied
		about the cause, I truly intend to offer you the prize that I promised. If any of you can save my people, we are
		willing to sign a contract that will offer up half of the Space Garden.”</p>

	<p>“Is that true?” Everyone’s eyes brightened.</p>

	<p>“You guys have seen what has happened to the Flower Gods. Do you think we have the gall, let alone the power, to
		break our promise?” Violet drawled. He wasn’t in a hurry.</p>

	<p>“What happened to your people? Can you explain it to us now?” Bai Wanjie looked at the heads protruding from the
		flower fields.</p>

	<p>The fields were indescribable. Flower Gods were planted in the soil as far as the eye could see. There were
		millions of them. And with the small flowers rising from each head, they looked so pretty.</p>

	<p>It didn’t matter how pretty they were, though. They were half-buried in the soil, which made the whole scene
		rather disturbing.</p>

	<p>Violet was no longer trying to withhold information. For the first time since they had met him, Violet explained
		what happened completely.</p>

	<p>The Flower Gods were good at gardening, and they had discovered the Space Garden long ago. It was a suitable
		place for many xenogeneic plants to grow. They thought they had lucked out, but they soon found out that there
		was something wrong with the xenogeneic space.</p>

	<p>The leader of the Flower Gods buried himself in the flower fields, just like Han Sen and the others were seeing
		now.</p>

	<p>The Flower Gods didn’t know why their leader did that, but they eventually figured out what was going on. They
		needed to appease the garden itself. Every once in a while, they would bring sacrifices to the garden. That way,
		the garden would no longer mess with their minds. As long as they kept the garden satisfied, it wouldn’t force
		any of the Flower Gods to bury themselves.</p>

	<p>But as time went by, the Space Garden seemed to become hungrier. It required more xenogeneics to support itself.
		Two months ago, the sacrifice that they buried in the flower fields was useless. The Flower God leader and many
		elites suddenly dug holes in the field and buried themselves there.</p>

	<p>Aside from Violet, every Flower God was now buried there.</p>

	<p>“Why didn’t you guys bury yourselves as they did?” asked a small race deified as he looked on Violet with
		suspicion. Clearly, he didn’t believe the tale that Violet was spinning.</p>

	<p>“I don’t know. Only I was okay. I don’t feel any danger. And I don’t know why this happened. That is why I am
		begging you all to save my people. We will never turn back on our word,” Violet said with a look of seriousness.
	</p>

	<p>“Have you tried digging them out?” a King class elite asked.</p>

	<p>That question was kind of pointless. The Flower Gods had been buried there for a while. Violet must have tried
		everything already. Violet would only have contacted outside deifieds if he had no other choice. He had
		exhausted all of his options.</p>

	<p>“I can’t dig them up. The soil might seem normal, but it is incredibly durable. You cannot dig through this land,
		and you might even hurt the people in the soil,” Violet answered.</p>

	<p>One of the elites tried to grab a handful of the soil. The eyes of everyone watching widened. The Kings, and even
		the deifieds, couldn’t summon enough power to rip out a chunk of that turf.</p>

	<p>“What kind of soil is this? Why is it so resilient?” a King class elite asked in shock.</p>

	<p>“I don’t know. When they dug the holes to bury themselves, it didn’t seem that difficult. But when I tried
		digging them out, I couldn’t dislodge even a tiny piece of the ground…” Violet explained the situation to them
		once.</p>

	<p>The elites tried many tests, but each attempt to crack this puzzle failed. They were unable to free the denizens
		of the flower fields.</p>

	<p>Many of the elites focused on the task with feverish intensity. They thought of all kinds of methods, trying to
		get the half-buried Flower Gods out. But their efforts accomplished nothing. All of their attempts were
		fruitless.</p>

	<p>One deified elite even grabbed a Flower God by the head. The Flower God’s neck almost broke, and he still didn’t
		move an inch.</p>

	<p>The elites were there to save people, not kill them. So, the deified elite stopped trying to yank the head out.
	</p>

	<p>“San Mu, what do you think is going on here?” Xie Qing King turned and asked Han Sen. He didn’t know what to make
		of the half-buried Flower Gods.</p>

	<p>“It’s a bit creepy, to say the least.” Han Sen squinted slightly as he spoke. He was checking out those
		half-buried Flower Gods, but he seemed to notice something.</p>

	<p>“Weird. It’s almost like the entire Space Garden is giving off a lifeforce… What if the Space Garden itself is a
		giant creature?” When Han Sen came up with an answer, it was something that not even he could believe.</p>
