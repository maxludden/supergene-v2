<h3>Chapter 3204</h3>

<p>“Killed Annihilation God Spirit gene race Weapon God. Got God
Spirit. Found Annihilation god base.”</p>
<p>The announcement sounded in Han Sen’s brain. It made him happy.
Along with an Annihilation god base, he received Weapon God’s God
Spirit.</p>
<p>He collected the Annihilation god base and had a look inside his
Sea of Soul. He saw Weapon God inside his Sea of Soul as a God
Spirit.</p>
<p>“In that case, this should mean I have two Weapon Gods,” Han Sen
said with glee.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, why are you here? Furthermore, you destroyed Weapon
God Temple. You killed one of the eight Sky Kings Weapon God. Do
you not want to live? Even if you do not want to live, do not bring
harm to Master Bao’er.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard a familiar voice. He noticed a paper man running
his way. He was around the size of a hand. He went right up to Han
Sen, stomping as he shouted.</p>
<p>“There are many God Spirit gene races in the Chaos God Party, so
does it matter if I eliminate one or two?” Han Sen laughed. No
universe laws were hampering him there. Ergo, he was not afraid of
anyone.</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, he could not use all of his powers
in battle. He also could not fight for long. Things were different
there.</p>
<p>The paper man was obviously Rocky Dee. Hearing Han Sen say what
he did, he felt even more annoyed. “You killed an average member,
so that was no big deal. This was one of the eight Sky Kings. That
was Weapon God! He was in charge of guarding Soldier Knife Sky, an
important core member. If he died, our leader will be extremely
shocked. I highly advise you to get Bao’er out of Soldier Knife Sky
right this minute!”</p>
<p>“Fine. I will let you handle things in my stead.” Han Sen wasn’t
after another fight with the God Chaos Party.</p>
<p>Even God Hall Leader could not get rid of God Chaos Party. This
was obviously grave trouble. The reason he had agreed with God Hall
Leader to come and check it out was that he wanted a god base.</p>
<p>Now, he had just managed to get his hands on another
Annihilation god base. He did not have to go any further. He did
not want to become the anti-scapegoat of the God Spirits.</p>
<p>He used Galaxy Teleportation to reach Jian Bu Gu and the others.
The power in his body then exploded. He took them to the exit of
Soldier Knife Sky. After that, he looked at Soldier Knife Sky and
exited the area.</p>
<p>Back in the universe of kingdoms, Han Sen felt as if he had been
chained and bound. He felt incredibly uncomfortable. It felt like
it cost him a lot of strength to do just the smallest of tasks.</p>
<p>“It really does feel better to not have any burdens,” Han Sen
said with a dismal sigh.</p>
<p>He sent Qin Bai and the others away. Han Sen went to his room
and put on his Sky King Crown. He returned to his God of Wealth
Temple.</p>
<p>He put the god base down in one of the sub halls. As this
happened, the sub hall exhibited some changes that flipped the sky
and the ground. There was a god altar, a god table, and a god
stove.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt weird about it because there was a distinct absence
of Weapon God.</p>
<p>“Does that mean that after I take the God Spirit, the god base
becomes empty?” Han Sen thought. After he mulled it over some more,
that was the only explanation he could come up with.</p>
<p>“If this is an empty god base, does that mean I can allow Moment
God to use this god base?”. Han Sen tried summoning Moment God’s
God Spirit and put her into the god base.</p>
<p>Of course, Moment God’s God Spirit was able to enter the god
base. It enabled the whole sub hall to become bathed in god light.
The gold altar had Moment God’s god statue.</p>
<p>“It really works.” Han Sen was very happy.</p>
<p>After Moment God’s God Spirit received her god body, she walked
down the god altar. She kneeled in front of Han Sen and said,
“Moment is greeting Mister God of Wealth.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a lot of power enter his Sky God Crown. The power
of the Sky God Crown increased a lot. It must have gone up at least
20%. Clearly, Moment God’s God Spirit had become stronger. She was
stronger than Decapitation Queen in the God of Wealth temple.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! I wonder which Moment God is the real one. Is it
mine or the one that resides inside the geno hall?” Han Sen was
secretly overjoyed. After Moment God established her things, Han
Sen had a look at his god power. He, Bao’er, and Feng Yin Yin
achieved a high rank in the god fights. They received a lot of god
base power for the God of Wealth temple. They should have been able
to make a god base.</p>
<p>After going to another empty sub hall, Han Sen was able to make
a new god base. Han Sen’s heart jumped. The sub hall he went into
had undergone some big changes. The god altar was floating in the
air, and god table went up with it. The god stove started to
form.</p>
<p>“Destroyed-class god base has been completed.” After everything
was done, the god temple had a weird god sound.</p>
<p>“Is it only Destroyed class? Can’t I make a higher-level god
base?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“God base power is not enough. A higher-level god base is not
able to be made,” the voice of the god temple sounded again in
reply to his question.</p>
<p>Han Sen was crushed by this disappointment. After working so
hard for so long, he could only produce a Destroyed-class god base.
It was no wonder the God Spirits leveled up so slowly, despite
being able to practice for billions of years. He did not know how
much god base power he required to make a god base become
Annihilation class.</p>
<p>“It looks like destroying god temples to get my god bases will
be faster,” Han Sen thought. He was planned to go after the God
Chaos Party again.</p>
<p>In the Moment God temple, Moment God frowned. When the Moment
God statue appeared in Han Sen’s God of Wealth Temple, her heart
madly jumped.</p>
<p>“What happened? How can something bring so much unrest to my god
heart?” Moment God said to herself. She could not detect where the
core of this unrest came from.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the God Chaos Party, Rocky Dee kneeled
inside a hall. He lowered his head and did not speak.</p>
<p>“Rocky Dee, you are a minister. How are you keeping up with
things? The Decapitation Queen Temple has been destroyed for quite
a while now, and you have not been able to capture the murderer who
destroyed the god temple. Now, someone shit all over territory that
belongs to the God Chaos Party. What did he do? Well, he destroyed
Weapon God Temple in Soldier Knife Sky. The minister is useless.
You might as well just quit.” A strong man was sitting on a high
throne, but he did not speak. He just calmly looked at Rocky Dee,
who was kneeling in front of him. The one who was speaking was
Eight Arm Evil God.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee did not raise his head as he coldly said, “Regarding
Decapitation Queen, it was me being useless. But I am only in
charge of foreign affairs. I only deal with things outside.
Whatever happened in Soldier Knife Sky had nothing to do with
me.”</p>
<p>“If it was not you, the foreign affair minister being useless,
how could there be no news about enemies invading Soldier Knife
Sky? If this was not your fault, then whose fault was it?” Eight
Arm Evil God coldly grunted.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee did not continue explaining. It was like he disdained
what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>Eight Arm Evil God wished to say something more, but the strong
man upon the throne started to speak. “All right, Rocky Dee is one
of God Chaos Party’s founding members. He has never done anything
bad. He knows what he is doing. There is no need to keep going on
about it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.” Eight Arm Evil God hastily bowed and backed
off.</p>
<p>The strong man looked at Rocky Dee while he coldly asked, “Rocky
Dee, why is the murderer who destroyed Weapon God Temple still at
large? Why has he not been killed yet?” His words were not cruel,
but they still made people feel pressure.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee raised his head to answer. “Mister Leader, the person
who destroyed Decapitation God Temple is a member of God of Wealth
Temple. I would like to find out more about this God of Wealth
Temple, so that is why I have not acted on the culprit yet.”</p>
<p>The strong man nodded. “I see, but you do not need to pursue
this any further. Kill that person. How long will you need?”</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s heart jumped. He had to say, “Please give me three
more days, Mister Leader.”</p>
