    <p>
      Qin Wenzhao was a young man who was polite and knew his place, so Han Sen
      had no problem with becoming his guardian.
    </p>

    <p>
      What surprised Han Sen the most, though, was how talented Qin Wenzhao
      looked. Now that super creatures had been found, Han Sen wondered why the
      Qin family allowed him to become an evolver so soon. He could have waited
      another few years to see if he could collect super geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, Han Sen&#8217;s schedule had been quite liberating. He
      couldn&#8217;t find appropriate super creatures to slay, so most of his
      time was spent on practicing the Dongxuan Sutra or in researching the Life
      Geno essence.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there had been no progress on either front. For the latter activity,
      being unable to achieve results on the Life Geno essence himself, Han Sen
      decided to lend it to the Ji family. For the entire time, it had been in
      his hands, he&#8217;d had countless eyes watching him like hawks, willing
      to bend over backward to secure the Life Geno essence for themselves.
      Giving it away to the Ji family would prompt others to stop pestering him,
      and Han Sen could go about doing his stuff freely.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would be best if they could find out how to absorb the Life Geno
      essence. If they figured it out, Han Sen could focus on hunting super
      creatures. Of course, if they did not find out how, then there was no
      loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing as he had absolutely nothing to do, Han Sen prepared to take Qin
      Wenzhao and Su Xiaoqiao out on an adventure and let them take in the glory
      of the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in truth, Han Sen had a destination in mind: the Peach Forest. He had
      yet to achieve a breakthrough with his Dongxuan Sutra, and he had no way
      of gauging how long it might take if he had to stick with it all by
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he managed to eat one of the mystic peaches from the giant tree,
      perhaps he could achieve the breakthrough he had been looking for and
      unlock the gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      He brought Qin Wenzhao and Su Xiaoqiao with him, and everything went
      swimmingly. Along their journey towards the Peach Forest, they managed to
      kill a good number of creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they reached the eaves of the Peach Forest, Han Sen did not dare
      bring them inside. He took a quick look himself, though, and noticed that
      all the flowers had wilted. Beneath the green leaves, however, he could
      spot green fruit that was as small as beans. It seemed it would be a while
      longer before they were ripe enough for collection and consumption.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen only peered at them from the outskirts of the forest, and
      following that, made preparations to depart with the two disciples. After
      all, the Peach Forest was a dangerous place, and there was no telling how
      many super creatures might have continued to reside beneath its darkened
      boughs. Even if Han Sen was on his own, he wouldn&#8217;t have dared
      enter.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they got ready to leave, they heard a monster roar from within the
      forest. It came from very far away, so the noise was faint. But Han Sen,
      panning the surroundings with his ears like radar dishes, felt his face
      drop.
    </p>

    <p>
      The noise sounded like it came from the black bear that he encountered at
      the giant tree. The roar was a mixture of sadness and anger, and he
      couldn&#8217;t imagine what might have spurred its cry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen greatly desired to find out what had happened, he wanted
      to take Qin Wenzhao and Su Xiaoqiao to the nearest shelter first. When he
      took them there, he bid that they should wait for him. Then he returned to
      the forest borders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Standing outside the Peach Forest, Han Sen could still faintly hear the
      cries of the black bear. The continued noise eased his worry that the
      creature might be dead, and taking great care, he stepped into the forest
      and treaded lightly as he followed the sound of the cries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because he hadn&#8217;t brought the silver fox with him, he made sure to
      take the utmost care along the way. It was far more difficult for him to
      make progress beneath the boughs this time, as he encountered many
      creatures along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were snakes everywhere. Han Sen summoned his golden armor and
      gargoyle glyph to avoid the bevies of snakes and continued his venture to
      where the cries of the black bear originated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen saw a pink little snake slithering. Had he never visited
      this forest before, he would have continued on his way.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the pink snake looked a little inconspicuous. It was only one foot
      long, and it was very thin. With its pink body, it looked practically
      harmless. It gave the impression that it was the sort of creature you
      could simply squish underfoot.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen remembered this snake. This pink little snake was under the
      giant tree, practicing with all the other creatures. It was a scary snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen suddenly stopped moving and put away all the powers in his body.
      He only wanted to take a look at what was happening with the black bear
      and did not want conflict with the pink snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the pink snake looked as if it had not even noticed Han Sen&#8217;s
      presence. It just carried on slithering in another direction. It was going
      so slowly, as if it was taking a stroll through the park. After a while,
      it managed to reach a peach tree, where it decided to climb up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if something was wrong, so he opened his gene lock and
      planned to run off. But that was when he noticed a group of snakes
      surrounding him. There were red, green, black, white, and patterned
      snakes. They were all around the ground and all along the trees like
      vines; he couldn&#8217;t tell how many were there.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The king of these creatures is so evil.&#8221; Han Sen was shocked
      at what had happened, so he summoned his wings and tried to fly away. But
      then he saw a snake with wings leap out of the trees. Even the pink little
      snake had transparent blood wings. It flew above Han Sen and circled
      there, prohibiting any chance of an airborne escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly summoned his Flaming Rex Spike, the two-meter long weapon.
      He threw it at a group of snakes, which instantly incinerated them into
      charcoal. The strike formed a gap in the ring of snakes around him, and he
      dashed through it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It didn&#8217;t take Han Sen long to realize that the pink snake was very
      similar to the wolf king and pegasi king. Its powers rested in the
      abundance of its subordinates and its ability to command them. The snakes
      established a formation, and although they had trouble in their attempts
      to harm Han Sen, they forced Han Sen to go deeper into the forest.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What does this pink snake want?&#8221; Han Sen was shocked.</p>

    <p>
      But then he noticed that the pink snake might not want to kill him. It
      just continued to push him deeper and deeper into the Peach Forest. Who
      knew what it wanted, but that was what it did. It was almost obvious how
      much the pink snake wanted to drive him deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not want to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures.
      He wanted to escape, but not a single window of opportunity had become
      available.
    </p>

    <p>
      The forest was full of snake-like creatures. Sometimes, they flew out from
      the crowns of peach trees like locusts, a plague, everywhere. On and on,
      they banished Han Sen into the deeper recesses of the Peach Forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The snakes were chasing Han Sen towards the black bear. Han Sen had been
      pushed one hundred miles, and the roars of the bear were clearer and more
      distinct. The cries were louder than he had imagined, and the bear was
      extremely angry now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth, thinking he might as well speed up and fly
      towards the bear. The crowd of snakes did not attack, but they picked up
      their pace to follow him. For some reason, they really wanted Han Sen to
      go there.
