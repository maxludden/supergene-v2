      It would take a long time for the Jade-Gold Tree to mature, so there was
      no rush right now. Han Sen examined the pills he had won, and taking one
      of each, he lined them up before the silver fox and his other pets to see
      if they were interested.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the fairy saw the medicine, one in particular caught her eye. But
      just as she was about to grab it, the silver fox gobbled it up.
    </p>

    <p>The little fairy had no choice but to select another pill to swallow.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised to see it was the latest pet pill the silver fox and
      the fairy decided to go after first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pulled out another pet pill to gauge how much they desired it. All
      too quickly, the silver fox and fairy wrestled with each other for it. Han
      Sen had received one hundred pet pills, so he decided to give one to each
      of his pets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spirits weren&#8217;t keen on pet pills, and the same applied to the
      little angel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Big Black and Small Black really loved the pills, too. But unfortunately,
      one hundred was not enough and they ate them all. There was no effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like the pills are more desirable then I thought. Ethics
      aside, the Dong Lin company is fairly amazing. I wonder what materials
      compose the pills, since they seem to work for both genuine pets and the
      creatures that adhere to my command here in the shelter.&#8221; Han Sen
      knew he had destroyed any enthusiasm that had been built for the pet
      pills, but it was going to be sold no matter what. However, due to their
      blundered promotional campaign, the price of the pills was sure to be
      lower to start off with. It would eventually rise in the future, when more
      and more people became aware of how effective the medicine was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like I need to stock up on some pet pills while the going
      is good.&#8221; Han Sen then thought about how he might buy a large number
      of pet pills for the lowest price possible. It was worth getting them to
      feed his pets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen prepared to visit the Alliance, trying to figure out where he
      could buy a large number of them.
    </p>

    <p>But when Han Sen arrived, he arrived to shocking news.</p>

    <p>
      Angel Gene had killed a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary
      and obtained a Life Geno Essence.
    </p>

    <p>
      They also began selling their high-tier Angel Gene Fluid. For evolvers who
      had a fitness level of over one hundred, they could use it to obtain a
      temporary boost of strength that lasted two hours. The drawback of
      subsequent weakness was also made known, but there was no permanent
      damage. And after appropriate rest, users would be right as rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the technology of the Alliance, all users would have to do was rest
      in their recovery baths for a few days.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the user had already unlocked their first gene lock, their fitness
      would be boosted to a level that almost rivalled a celestial being. They
      would become incredibly powerful and the effects would last far longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Angel Gene used this fluid to slay a super creature, and after they did,
      they used the Life Geno Essence as a promotional item to advocate the
      effectiveness of their product.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, Angel Gene was number one when it came to the needs of
      evolvers. Their juice could also work for surpassers, although it
      wasn&#8217;t as effective.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Angel Gene Fluid announcement rocked the entire Alliance, and it had
      most certainly ushered in a new era for humanity. The sales were off to a
      flying start, and it quickly made Angel Gene a household name within the
      Alliance. The Zhao family were depicted as gods, and everyone could not
      stop talking about their Angel Gene Fluid. This entire event had a grand
      effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      The product, however, was difficult to mass produce. As a result, it was
      extremely expensive. Angel Gene did have a range of products suited for
      those who lacked the required money, suitable for the average evolver.
      That being said, its effectiveness was far worse.
    </p>

    <p>The low tier Angel Gene Fluid was their main product, though.</p>

    <p>
      Angel Gene also announced the primary ingredients that composed the juice,
      and one of them was raw shura blood. It was impossible for technology to
      recreate the properties of such blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this also meant humanity could not make peace with the shura. For
      continued production of the fluid, the war would have to go on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people opposed the Angel Gene Fluid, but they were too few. And their
      voices were drowned out by the rest, who clamored for power above all
      else. The Angel Gene Fluid bandwagon did not seem likely to stop, and the
      repercussions of its existence were surely going to be felt across the
      universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wished he could murder everyone in the Zhao family, but he did
      admire the power Zhao Seventh possessed. Angel Gene Fluid really was a
      breakthrough product.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the Ji family had obtained the Angel Gene Fluid off Han Sen a
      while ago, they had not focused on the geno business enough. As a result,
      they were unable to discover the ingredients.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen could not blame them. The Qi family operated in the same
      realm, and when they were given the Angel Gene Fluid, they couldn&#8217;t
      make heads or tails of its ingredients, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Qi family had suffered the most damage, however. After the pet pills,
      they believed they would become even more famous, but their advertising
      ploy went awry. As if that wasn&#8217;t damaging enough, the Zhao family
      had now announced their humanity-changing Angel Gene Fluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Angel Gene Fluid could immediately increase your power, so who would want
      to spend more money and time on raising pets that weren&#8217;t very
      useful, anyway?
    </p>

    <p>
      They had mass-produced a vast amount of pet pills, prepared to sell them
      all. But now, they had a horde of them sitting on store shelves, unable to
      be moved. Their business chain broke, depleting their cash reserves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not too concerned about Angel Gene Fluid, though. After all,
      the high-tier variant required shura blood, and that was a precious
      commodity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides, when humans used a high-tier angel fluid, their bodies would not
      be pure. And they could not solo a super creature. Even with many people
      making use of the juice, it&#8217;d still be difficult to slay a super
      creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      But still, it was indeed an all-round boost to the development of
      humanity&#8217;s ascension and the speed of their evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      What Han Sen was most interested in right now, however, was the Qi
      family&#8217;s pet pills. The Zhao family&#8217;s Angel Gene Fluid still
      had a number of issues with it. It wouldn&#8217;t be effective enough
      until they managed to sort out the side effects and make it last longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plus, they needed the blood of royal shuras. Unless they found a way to
      artificially create a compound that provided the same benefits, it would
      not be effective in the long-term.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pet pills were different, though. Although their effects were not
      immediate, their slow-boil of improvement was more likely to benefit
      humanity in the long-term.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen learnt of the Qi family&#8217;s troubles, he planned to buy
      out their unmovable surplus. They needed the money, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was only a matter of time before humans discovered how effective and
      useful the pills actually were. And once they did, the price was sure to
      skyrocket.
