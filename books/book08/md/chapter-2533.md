  All the royal knights were lined up, surrounding a giant eyeball that looked like a blue gem. It was as big as a moon. Although the knights were all Kings who had powerful areas, most of the knights weren’t using their powers.

They had been split up into teams, and every team had a leader. Under the leader’s command, the Kings released their powers and areas one by one. The process was smooth, and there were no errors or faults. The knights worked together like a well-oiled machine, and the fight was precise, tidy, and unhindered.

Han Sen had allowed Bubble to take on his appearance and play chess. Meanwhile, he snuck into the battleground. He hid between the asteroids so he could watch the crazy fight unfold.

Han Sen had to compliment them. There were many elites in the Extreme King. For every one hundred Kings, there were twenty to thirty half-deifieds. They had all kinds of powers, which could be used in any way they deemed suitable.

The half-deifieds that could use Galaxy Teleportation were the types that Dia Robber and Dragon One had spent so much time looking for. The royal knights had two soldiers with those powers.

The powers of the various knights were utilized very well. They trapped the giant blue gem eyeball within their circle, and no matter how many times the blue gem eyeball released its blue light, it couldn’t break out of its cage. It was unable to hurt the members of the royal knights.

The power that bound the creature was completely silent, and Bai Wan Jie hovered to the side as he watched the fight. He didn’t even participate in the actual battle. But Han Sen had noticed that the leader of the knights seemed to have a heart. The man used his heart to command the knights, and that was why their performance had been so flawless.

“So strong. The Extreme King’s geniuses are too strong compared to the geniuses of other races. Any of their Kings that awaken their king bodies have a great chance of becoming deified. Compared to the other high races that must practice for so long, having a king body is like using a cheat code.” Han Sen sighed. He was very hopeful about humans.

Every human that came from the Sanctuary had a super god body. If their development was spurred and humans eventually developed an army, it would be stronger than any army of the Extreme King.

However, in this fight, even the powerful Extreme King knights surrounding the Sea Sky Eye were unable to hurt it.

The Sea Sky Eye kept dancing and releasing blue lights. Although it couldn’t escape the circle of knights, its enemies were still unable to hurt it.

Han Sen continued to watch the battle proceed for a while longer. The reason the Extreme King knights couldn’t injure the Sky Eye was simple; the Sky Eye had a special eye skill.

No matter how complicated the attacks of the Extreme King knights were or how perfectly they cooperated, the Sky Eye was impervious to all their attacks. It wouldn’t allow any powers to land on it.

“If this continues, the royal knights are going to lose,” Han Sen thought.

After all, the Sea Sky Eye casually brushed off every attack of the royal knights. The knights had much more difficulty resisting the eye’s attacks, by comparison. Using group Galaxy Teleportation was particularly exhausting for the Extreme King soldiers. Casting that geno cost a lot of energy, and after a few uses, the caster would grow tired.

“Bai Wan Jie must have another trick up his sleeve, right?” Han Sen was still hiding, not yet planning on doing anything. He just watched the scary fight play out.

The powers being used in the fight were flashing across space, causing the darkness itself to shake. Normal people would see it all like a rainbow light in space, with a few shockwaves causing the light to ripple and jump. They wouldn’t see anything in detail.

Han Sen was so far away, but he had his Purple-Eye Butterfly and Spell sniper rifle. His view of the battle was crystal clear, which allowed him to keep up with every attack and parry. As he watched, he was learning a lot.

“I didn’t know that ice element skills could be used that way… And that must be a metal area…” While Han Sen watched with interest, the Sea Sky Eye suddenly became brighter. The moon-like Sea Sky Eye lit up. It was now like a sun that was releasing blue light.

A blue glow spread along its substance chains, breaking the areas of the knights effortlessly. They were completely helpless to stop it. The blue light was everywhere, and there was nothing they could do to evade it. From the looks of it, one hundred royal knights were about to be killed on the spot.

Bai Wan Jie, who was watching the fight, finally moved. He was holding a staff that looked as if it had been made of platinum. A crystal ball was mounted on the top of the staff, and when Bai Wan Jie raised his staff, the crystal ball began to shine. It released some transparent substance chains, which shielded the royal knights with a screen of crystal.

When the Sea Sky Eye’s blue light struck that layer of crystal, the light disappeared. It was actually unable to break through that layer of crystal.

“What is that staff? How does it possess so much power?” Han Sen was shocked. Bai Wan Jie was just half-deified. Even if he was wielding a deified weapon, he shouldn’t have been able to trigger a deified substance chain.

But now, Bai Wan Jie was using his staff to protect all the royal knights from the attacks of the Sea Sky Eye. Han Sen didn’t know what to make of the sight.

“Attack!” Bai Wan Jie raised his staff. The transparent substance chain kept buffing the knights, and the knights surged forward like a legion of the undead. Suddenly, none of them were afraid of the Sea Sky Eye’s power anymore, so they stopped defending themselves and focused all their strength on attacking.

The Sea Sky Eye was strangely enraged. The blue light it wielded was so strong that it looked like an angry blue star. Han Sen could barely look in the creature’s direction. But even so, the Sea Sky Eye couldn’t break the defense of the transparent substance chain.

The powers of the knights finally landed on the creature, but they weren’t very effective. They could barely damage the Sea Sky Eye.

Han Sen used his sniper rifle to aim at Bai Wan Jie. The man’s body was releasing a white light. The staff sucked in the light he was producing, then pumped out transparent substance chains in return.

“Weird. Bai Wan Jie is fueling the staff with his own power, but he’s obviously producing way more power than a half-deified should be capable of. At the rate that the staff’s draining his strength, even Dragon One would only last for a few seconds. But Bai Wan Jie is maintaining that output, and he has yet to look exhausted. That isn’t normal,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Bai Wan Jie did look pale, but he wasn’t about to collapse.

Bzzt!

As Han Sen watched Bai Wan Jie, something happened to the Sea Sky Eye.
