<h2>One Person, One Race</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1779</h3>

<p>The angel figure that the gold flame had created gathered up a
power that was indestructible. It looked as if it would only take
one hit to destroy an entire galaxy. It could destroy the
future.</p>
<p>Many powerful races were thinking that the Feathers were
practically almighty.</p>
<p>If the race wasn’t strong, then the lantern wouldn’t unleash a
power that was as brilliant as that. It represented the strength of
that race. If it was strong, it’d go bright. It was weak, it’d go
dim.</p>
<p>Creating a sword that could destroy the universe proved how
strong the Feathers were.</p>
<p>Kong Fei faced the lantern, but his own face didn’t change. He
looked at the word Feather on the lantern, and reached out with his
arm to strike it.</p>
<p>His arm was glowing. It was very bright He didn’t fall back,
despite facing a race composed of a billion beings. His confidence
was unwavering.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood ran fast when he witnessed all this. He wished
he could fight with that man in the air, and let the blood
flow.</p>
<p>But Han Sen knew his place, and he knew his power wasn’t high
enough to fight alongside him. Any Noble there would be killed in
one hit.</p>
<p>Han Sen held back his passion, and he watched as Kong Fei stood
alone. He intently stared as Kong Fei faced an angel of the race
that hounded him.</p>
<p>The next second, the angel sword lit up the planets in the sky.
Everyone lost their vision, and all that could be seen was the
color gold. The gold light lasted a few seconds, and when it faded,
everyone could see what remained in the sky again.</p>
<p>The gold angel was a kilometer tall, and she stood right in
front of the door to the geno hall. Her back was still connected
with the lantern.</p>
<p>Kong Fei flew in front of her, with his right arm covered in
blood. It had been severely cut, and you could even see the bone
beyond the ravaged flesh.</p>
<p>“Did we lose?” Stay Up Late’s eyes were full of shock, and he
said those three words.</p>
<p>But in the next second, the angel’s body shattered into nothing
more than fragments of gold light. They all scattered and fell into
the galaxy.</p>
<p>The word Feather on the lantern cracked and disintegrated as its
light was extinguished. Darkness took its place.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>All the Feathers around coughed up blood, like a rain shower.
Their bodies looked as if they had all been electrified. It looked
like they had lost a big chunk of their energy.</p>
<p>Countless Feathers started to fall. Kings had their ranks
reduced to being just Dukes, as Dukes became Marquis, Marquis
became Earls, and so on. This applied to every Feather.</p>
<p>The youngest of the Feathers could not be any lower. Their base
was damaged, though, and their talents were reduced.</p>
<p>They were injured, and if they wished to evolve again, it would
take forever.</p>
<p>“Kong Fei, just kill me!” King-Sky King shouted, with blood
seeping out of him. Snuffing out the light was worse than killing
him, he thought.</p>
<p>The lantern of the Feathers made them a higher race. They had
held that loft for a billion years. Now that they had become a
lesser race, this was a thousand times worse than simply killing
them outright.</p>
<p>Kong Fei smiled and said, “Three thousand ghost Feathers
suffered for three thousand years. Cry for three thousand. Hate for
three thousand years. That is a pain that is worse than death. They
had hope because they still had me. But you guys are all different.
You have no hope. And you will fade without it”</p>
<p>After that, Kong Fei’s blood landed atop the lantern. A white
fire appeared, lighting up the place.</p>
<p>“Kong Fei, you are a Feather, too! We are sorry for what has
happened. But you just murdered a bunch of Feathers, and even
Kings! This loss is far graver than the three thousand. This should
end. I beg you to place the word Feather on the lantern again. You
can be my King, and I will adhere to your every command.” Holy
Column King kept on pausing to spit out blood. He shouted at Kong
Fei, but there wasn’t an ounce of intimidation left. He was a mere
beggar now.</p>
<p>“If you can write down Feather, we will do whatever it is you
want.” A few Feather Kings, King-Sky King included, begged before
Kong Fei.</p>
<p>Kong Fei’s blood was not pure, but he did have Feather blood.
Writing down Feather would make then a higher race once again.</p>
<p>“The moment I ripped off my wings was the moment I discarded my
belonging to the Feathers.” Kong Fei sounded normal, but his aura
of hatred was scary.</p>
<p>“One race, my race, will one day be called No. It will start
with me, and it will end with me. No other race will be granted the
title of belonging to No.” Kong Fei’s voice was so loud.</p>
<p>Even the stars trembled in response to his frightening vow. The
geno lantern, with its white fire, soon displayed the word No.
Blergh!</p>
<p>King-Sky King continued to cough up blood.</p>
<p>Kong Fei’s word cut all chance of possibly sharing the lantern.
The Feathers could not be regarded as a higher race anymore.
Rain!</p>
<p>A heavy rain!</p>
<p>All the planets started to rain, and the lightning danced among
them like dragons.</p>
<p>It looked like they were crying for a higher race having fallen,
but celebrating the birth of a new higher race.</p>
<p>Han Sen was standing in the rain, looking up at the geno hall.
The moment when the No lantern flew into the temple’s hall, Han
Sen’s heartfelt strange. It looked to him as if there were eyes on
the inside, staring down at him. The geno hall was watching the
entire world.</p>
<p>The black armor that had no movement suddenly brimmed with a
phantom strength. It made Han Sen feel as if he was frozen. All he
could do was stand in the rain.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Han Sen was in shock.</p>
<p>When the lantern entered the hall, the geno hall’s doors shut.
When it vanished to wherever it had come from, Han Sen felt a weird
power enter his Sea of Soul. It went straight into his black
armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body returned to being normal again. His black armor
had no movement, and it was as if it was dead.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked to where the geno hall had disappeared, and his
face looked confused.</p>
<p>When the geno hall doors shut, that feeling slowly started to
disappear. And the black crystal armor’s power only seemed to cover
him during the time when it was open. This could not have been a
coincidence.</p>
<p>“What is the black crystal armor? Is it like this because of me?
What was that feeling of being watched? Is something living inside
the geno hall?” Han Sen now had an endless list of questions, none
of which he could currently figure out.</p>
<p>The spirit hall left, and weird things no longer occurred on
other planets. You could only see an empty sky returning now. The
broken Feathers, and Kong Fei himself, were gone from sight.</p>
<p>Han Sen was standing in the rain thinking. Then, a naked man
suddenly approached him. It was Kong Fei, who had become a No, all
alone.</p>
