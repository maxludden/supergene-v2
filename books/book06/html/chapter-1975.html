<h2>Xuanyuan Dragon</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1975</h3>

<p>The creature’s scales were as black as ink. Its head had no
horns, but the ears were fixed with black wings. Its belly had
talons, like those of an eagle. It was coming his way, and black
smoke billowed around it. It looked very creepy.</p>
<p>The Xuanyuan Dragon was too fast, and there were still the Ghost
Claw Beasts to fend off. Even if the Ghost Claw Beasts hadn’t been
there, Han Sen’s group still wouldn’t have been able to outrun the
dragon.</p>
<p>In a second, the Xuanyuan Dragon was a mere twenty meters away
from them. It opened its maw and fired a plume of black smoke in
their direction. The smoke blackened the passage as it came toward
them.</p>
<p>“The Xuanyuan Dragon’s breath is toxic. Do not breathe it in!”
Thousand Feather Crane shouted, and then a cloud exploded from his
body. The eye on his forehead opened up and shone. The shining
light made him stronger.</p>
<p>“The sky and the clouds are invincible! The sword can kill the
sky!” Thousand Feather Crane shouted. A white sword air surrounded
his ancient sword, and he swung it forward.</p>
<p>The white sword air sliced open the black toxic smoke. The sword
air continued on until it struck the dragon’s head. Then, it was
gone.</p>
<p>“You guys leave now.” Thousand Feather Crane clutched his sword
tight and ran for the dragon. His body was emitting clouds, and he
flew forward like a fairy.</p>
<p>“Take Suyi.” Yun Sushang pushed Yun Suyi to First Day, then the
eye on her forehead opened. A new sword air surrounded her ancient
sword as well, and she went to fight beside Thousand Feather
Crane.</p>
<p>They lifted their swords and attacked together, breaking the
Xuanyuan Dragon’s breath. They stopped the advance of the Xuanyuan
Dragon and fought it hard. The dragon could not do anything.</p>
<p>“So this is the power of the Sky! When their third eyes are
opened, they are far stronger.” Han Sen watched in awe.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang’s power could go up
against a Marquise creature, and it seemed likely that they could
actually kill one.</p>
<p>But the Xuanyuan Dragon was no ordinary Marquise. Its scales
were incredibly strong, and its power was just as impressive.
Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang broke through the breath,
but they could not break the scales.</p>
<p>The snow white sword air swung down across the black scales, but
it could only leave behind a white scratch mark.</p>
<p>Han Sen let Spell fire a few bullets at the Xuanyuan Dragon, but
when the bullets hit the target, they shattered into dust.</p>
<p>“So strong!” Han Sen shouted in his heart.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, please take Suyi and leave this place,” First Day
said, as he proceeded to cast Truth Spell. The spells landed on the
ground of the area, then surged forward to land on Yun Sushang and
Thousand Feather Crane. It helped buff their power and speed.</p>
<p>Some of his spells hit the Xuanyuan Dragon, but those appeared
to be futile.</p>
<p>Three elites were now in battle against the Xuanyuan Dragon, but
that only seemed to make it angrier. A black light grew in the
center of its black. The black light became dragon wings, and they
gave it speed.</p>
<p>The Xuanyuan Dragon flapped its wings, and its ten-meter-long
body performed a loop in the air.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Yun Sushang could not dodge it. The dragon bit down on her
sword, and then, the sword broke.</p>
<p>At the same time, the tail of the dragon was swinging towards
First Day. First Day’s body was glowing with white light. Truth
Spell gave him a bubble shield, but the tail obliterated it with a
single strike. It sent his body flying against the cavern walls
like a meteor. He screamed as it body slammed into the wall and
cracked it, then he coughed up blood.</p>
<p>“Oh no! It is a mutant xenogeneic. It has reinforced scales and
a faster flying speed.” Thousand Feather Crane moved like a cloud.
He picked up Yun Sushang, waved a sword air, and broke the black
smoke the dragon was exhaling.</p>
<p>“Spell, protect her!” Han Sen told Spell, then pulled out Ghost
Teeth Knife. The rabbit shoes appeared on his feet, and he gripped
his knife with the Red Mink Gloves.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved like a shadow, moving right behind the Xuanyuan
Dragon. Using Tusk, he swung at the back of the Xuanyuan Dragon’s
neck.</p>
<p>His attack only produced a dong noise. Not even the Ghost Teeth
Knife’s Teeth power could break through the Xuanyuan Dragon’s
scales. It could only leave a scratch mark on the scales. And
although his knife possessed Teeth power and emitted a dangerous
purple smoke, it still seemed useless.</p>
<p>That hard?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>“Don’t fight it. Run! It is a mutant xenogeneic, and its body
far exceeds its actual level.” Thousand Feather Crane slashed to
draw the Xuanyuan Dragon’s attention while he shouted.</p>
<p>But the Xuanyuan Dragon was too fast. It flapped its wings and
became a black horse directly in front of Thousand Feather Crane.
Thousand Feather Crane’s sword air collided with the horse, and the
sword air shattered. Still, he could not hurt it.</p>
<p>Seeing that the black horse was about to grab Thousand Feather
Crane, he shouted. He held Yun Sushang tighter and took off in
flight. He moved so fast that it looked like he teleported away
from the attack.</p>
<p>But Thousand Feather Crane’s face turned pale. His hands
trembled as he gave Yun Sushang to Yun Suyi. “Sushang and Suyi, you
guys leave with First Day. Han Sen and I have got this.”</p>
<p>Roar! The Xuanyuan Dragon’s attack had missed. It turned around
and went after First Day, who had just stood up from the
rubble.</p>
<p>First Day gritted his teeth. His legs shone, like he was
stepping on a lotus. And he cast a spell, which left a glowing
symbol behind with every step he took. Every symbol caused him to
accelerate.</p>
<p>But he still could not dodge the Xuanyuan Dragon’s attacks, and
the talons were in front of him.</p>
<p>First Day held out his palm, and a True Light came out of it to
counter the talon. The gold light and the black light collided
against each other. First Day was sent flying, though, all the way
back into the stone. The True Light was broken.</p>
<p>The dragon was cruel, and it went for First Day once again.
Thousand Feather Crane’s Sky eye shone. He was bleeding, but he
summoned a cloud air. The sword air became a white dragon, and it
roared. It went for Xuanyuan Dragon.</p>
<p>A black dragon and a white dragon surged toward each other. Then
the Xuanyuan Dragon flapped its wings to become a black horse and
avoid the engagement. It was going for Yun Sushang and Yun
Suyi.</p>
<p>“Careful, sister!” Thousand Feather Crane’s face went grey. This
strike had cost all his power, and there was nothing he could do to
save them.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang knew that they weren’t fast enough to dodge the
attack. She summoned an ancient sword and her Sky eye shone. She
slashed a sword air up at the dragon.</p>
<p>Han Sen was currently sprinting, and the rabbit shoes gave him
the speed of a dragon. He went behind the dragon and slashed it on
the side.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Two noises sounded at the same time. Yun Sushang heaved blood as
she was sent careening away. Han Sen slashed the dragon’s stomach
again. He left a mark, but he didn’t see flesh.</p>
