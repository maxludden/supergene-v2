<h2>Gold Fire Peacock</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2222</h3>

<p>Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and flew behind the lava
peacock. He slashed as quickly as he could, but the lava peacock
was still able to avoid each strike.</p>
<p>“I do not believe I cannot kill you!” Han Sen dodged the lava
peacock’s squirting of lava and thrust his Ghost Teeth Knife
forward, firing a knife silk at the lava peacock, but the peacock
managed to dodge the knife silk net easily, and it did not even
come into contact with its body.</p>
<p>Han Sen put his Ghost Teeth Knife away and drew his Spell
pistols instead. He fired at the peacock like mad, but the gold
peacock was able to dodge each bullet, leaving a trail of gold dust
in its wake. No matter how Han Sen tried to attack the peacock, he
couldn’t hit it.</p>
<p>While the lava peacock fought Han Sen, Han Meng’er pulled the
string of her bow and fired an arrow.</p>
<p>The peacock dodged Han Sen’s pistol attacks, but as it did so,
it put itself into a more difficult position. Han Meng’er’s arrow
was on a collision course with the peacock as a result, but all of
a sudden, the peacock flapped its wings. It made a strange
curvature in the fabric of space as if to twist the dimension. By
doing so, it managed to evade Han Meng’er’s arrow.</p>
<p>“So strong!” Han Sen was surprised, but Han Meng’er just
frowned.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing teleported her body behind the lava peacock and
readied herself to throw a punch into its back, but the peacock
waved its feathers and dodged her attack, too.</p>
<p>Ji Qing was clutching her Duke class Galactic Shrimp sword. She
swung a few swordlights at the peacock, but it was able to dodge
them, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were all fighting the lava peacock
together, but none of them were able to brush or ruffle a single
hair of the creature. The peacock was like a flame that kept
changing in the dance of its ripples. It kept flying around in a
twisted way through the distortion of space. The lava lashed about
all over the place, prompting Han Sen to fall back a touch.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen and Huangfu Jing battered their Jade Drum, and it sent
two strong sonic shockwaves out. It hit the lava peacock, but it
just made the lava hotter. The shockwave only managed to knock back
some of the lava splashes. After all, it was only a Duke class Jade
Drum. Its sonic powers would not be enough to damage the mutant
Duke beast.</p>
<p>“Let me do it!” Han Yan shouted. She was holding a Marquise
Galactic Shrimp Sword. Her body gleamed with a white light, and her
hair became long. She looked as if there were a god looking
directly after her.</p>
<p>Han Yan slashed at the lava peacock, unleashing an invisible
swordlight. At the same time as this, the peacock’s body was hit.
It made it spill more lava.</p>
<p>The Falsified-Sky Sutra worked to deliver an absolute hit as it
ought to have. Han Sen and the others could not follow and keep up
with the insane speed of the lava peacock, and while Han Yan
couldn’t either, she didn’t have to. When the swordlight was
unleashed, it would assuredly strike the peacock.</p>
<p>Han Yan kept swinging her sword, making many invisible
swordlights come raging at the lava peacock for surefire hits. The
lava it carried kept squirting around.</p>
<p>But while she was indeed delivering hits, her strikes were not
very effective. After all, Han Yan was only an Earl. Even though
she had a super god body and her Falsified-Sky Sutra equipped,
going up against a Duke, it would still never be enough.</p>
<p>“Zero!” Han Sen, upon seeing the Falsified-Sky Sutra prove
effective, thought about Zero. She was a Marquise, and she
possessed the same power.</p>
<p>Zero heard Han Sen’s command and used her purple eyes and drew
out the Bone Knife. That lava peacock wished to melt the Bone Knife
by firing a stream of lava at it, but then the Bone Knife
disappeared. When it reappeared, it was pierced into the peacock’s
chest.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>The peacock coughed up a bucket of blood that looked like lava.
This time, their foe had been injured. Zero’s body then took off
flying into the sky in a nifty retrieval of her Bone Knife. She
flew down past the peacock that wished to now leap into the lava
and heal, and sliced open the creature’s chest. A burning flame
with gold blood began to spill out from the lesion. It made the
peacock freeze in its spot in the air.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept firing at the heavily injured lava peacock. Every
single bullet struck its body, and the powers of Break Six Skies
were unloaded. It resulted in the peacock being blown to bits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Xenogeneic Duke hunted. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained beast
soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He did not expect to kill the as quickly as
that. It was not a mutant xenogeneic, and while it was revealed to
be just an ordinary Duke, it was certainly fast.</p>
<p>Han Sen, hearing that he had obtained a beast soul, was very
happy. He quickly had a look at what sort of beast soul it was.</p>
<div class="tables">
<table class="beast">

<!-- Duke class beast soul : Flying-type. --></div>
<p>Han Sen’s heart stopped. A gold lava-looking set of peacock
wings appeared behind Han Sen. A slight touch could make Han Sen
travel so far and so fast. Whenever he sped up, he could unleash a
stream of fire that could twist the fabric of space in its
vicinity.</p>
<p>“A flying beast soul is good, but I already have my dragon
wings. I do not need this beast soul.” Han Sen let out a sigh, and
then he gave the beast soul to Han Yan. Because she was only an
Earl, her safety could be more easily assured with the beast
soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept looking for more creatures to hunt, and although he
had managed to collect a few fire element bird beast souls, none
were of the weapon type he so much desired.</p>
<p>“Are fire weapon beast souls that difficult to procure?” Han Sen
felt depressed. Lava Valley had many fire bird xenogeneics. He knew
what kind of beast soul they would offer, but none were his desired
weapon.</p>
<p>It was almost time for him to go back, so Han Sen decided to
retreat. He returned to the base, hoping to go further next time
and see what he could get then.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, it is good that you have returned! Your team will be
the recipient of a new addition.” After returning to base, Han Sen
was called over by Ice Blue Knight King.</p>
<p>“Did we not have an agreement saying you can’t take anyone
away?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“Of course I remember. We are not taking your people away. You
didn’t say we could not add members to your team, though. I have
good faith in you, and so I have found your team a powerful ally
that will benefit you and the others.” Ice Blue Knight King smiled
while he spoke.</p>
<p>“Can I reject the addition?” Han Sen had a wry smile.</p>
<p>“No, this is an order.” Ice Blue Knight King spoke with absolute
certainty.</p>
<p>While Han Sen wished to say something more, a woman arrived. She
walked in front of Ice Blue Knight King, bowed, and said, “Mister
Knight, greetings from Bai Wei.”</p>
<p>Han Sen, upon seeing the woman, was given a shock. That was the
Extreme King woman he had encountered in Narrow Moon. Han Sen had
stolen the Destroyed Bible from her.</p>
