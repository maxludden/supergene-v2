	<p>The fat squad leader became slightly pale. There had been many great soldiers who had tried the device and
		failed, so Wang Hou was clearly bringing the cookhouse up to set them up. However, there was no way the fat
		squad leader could argue with that.</p>

	<p>After hearing Wang Hou’s words, Chen Shoushan looked at the fat squad leader and said with a smile, &#8220;That
		is right. Luo, you are having a lot of fun just now, so it’s time for you to move around. I think you have a
		great team, so you will definitely do well.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, captain.&#8221; The fat squad leader stood up and saluted, cursing Wang Hou inwardly.</p>

	<p>Although everyone in the cookhouse was an evolver with high ranks, they were not the best fighters, because
		that’s not what they did.</p>

	<p>They were only there to see other people train but did not expect to be set up by Wang Hou.</p>

	<p>Although the fat squad leader wanted to go himself, the rule regulated that no team leads shall participate. In
		addition, with his round figure, he would probably lose even worse if he were to participate.</p>

	<p>The fat squad leader looked to his team members and received pleading looks, meaning they were not confident at
		all.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Fatty, isn’t there a new recruit in your cookhouse? Let him make an appearance. It doesn’t matter what the
		result is. We just want to meet him.&#8221; As the fat squad leader was hesitating whom to pick, Wang Hou spoke
		again.</p>

	<p>After that day, Wang Hou looked through Han Sen’s profile. He did not see anything special about Han Sen. The
		greatest strength about the sky was probably the fact that he graduated with the rank of major.</p>

	<p>However, that rank was nothing special on Daphne. Many soldiers had that rank and they were all more experienced
		than this new recruit, since a new recruit was unlikely to be assigned to this post.</p>

	<p>A mission like this required veterans. For Han Sen, who had just graduated from the military school, it was
		abnormal for him to be assigned to this place.</p>

	<p>Wang Hou looked into Han Sen’s background a bit further and found he graduated from the same school as Ji Yanran.
		The two must have known each other.</p>

	<p>Naturally, Han Sen was counted as Ji Yanran’s fervent by Wang Hou. He wondered how strong a fighter Han Sen was.
		Wang Hou had always thought he should take every chance to know his enemy better.</p>

	<p>The fat squad leader frowned and wanted to say something. However, Han Sen said calmly, &#8220;It’s okay. I can
		try. I want to anyway.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221; The fat squad leader did not stop Han Sen. After all, this was not a real drill. Since no one
		had succeeded, it was simply normal for Han Sen to fail as well. And worst case he would get shocked, which was
		nothing to a soldier.</p>

	<p>Han Sen got up, shot a glance at Wang Hou, and entered the training field.</p>

	<p>Although Daphne only had one warframe department, it was an advanced department comprised of fifteen warframe
		soldiers, who were all carefully selected veterans.</p>

	<p>Basically, except for the cookhouse, every other department was elite units. For example, the warship crew had a
		lot of groups such as the repair group and others.</p>

	<p>Han Sen entered the training field, and the gravity trainer was turned up. He suddenly felt a lot more burden.
	</p>

	<p>Everyone’s eyes were suddenly on Han Sen. Although they all knew this new recruit would fail, it was fun to
		predict when he would fail.</p>

	<p>In addition to Wang Hou, some other people were also observing Han Sen with scrutiny.</p>

	<p>Ji Yanran did not manage to hide the fact that she was the one who got Han Sen on the warship from Chen Shoushan.
		The fact that Chen Shoushan was helping Wang Hou get Han Sen up the stage was because he was also wondering what
		Han Sen could do to make Ji Yanran spend so much effort.</p>

	<p>Han Sen took a deep breath and walked to the first metal wall.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had asked Ji Yanran about Wang Hou in private, because as sensitive as he was, he could feel the
		hostility Wang Hou held against himself.</p>

	<p>That was abnormal. Han Sen was merely a new recruit and had not offended Wang Hou ever. He had not even met Wang
		Hou before. Han Sen did not feel that the hostility simply came from the bump.</p>

	<p>What Ji Yanran told Han Sen corroborated Han Sen’s assumption.</p>

	<p>Wang Hou was connected to the expert panel. Although he was the head of the warframe department, he was elected
		because of the suggestion of the expert panel. Wang Hou himself had selected all the soldiers in his department.
		It was fair to say that the warframe department worked for the expert panel.</p>

	<p>There were many scholars and experts pissed at Ji Yanran, which was a known fact. After all, Ji Yanran had just
		become an evolver. Although she came from a prominent family, that did not help the fieldwork, which was why the
		expert panel did not like her very much.</p>

	<p>In addition, the old Captain whom Ji Yanran had replaced was very close to the expert panel, so that had also
		added to the prejudice the expert panel held against Ji Yanran.</p>

	<p>Because of Ji Yanran’s family, no one dared to say anything. However, if Ji Yanran herself made some serious
		mistakes, it would be natural for her to be removed from Daphne.</p>

	<p>Initially, Han Sen did not want any drama, and only want to finish his tasks while improving himself. However,
		since he was here because of Ji Yanran, many people would know that. If he acted poorly, Ji Yanran would be
		humiliated.</p>

	<p>It was not an option for his girlfriend to be humiliated. Not just that, he needed to make her proud. Otherwise,
		he would not call himself her boyfriend.</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew very well what Wang Hou was trying to do, but he did not care.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You want to watch, I’ll let you watch.&#8221; Han Sen made the first step on the metal wall, dashing on
		the white zone which was only 1 foot wide.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was very fast, unlike the previous soldiers who were trying to control their speed so that they had more
		time to observe and decide how to go ahead. Han Sen did the opposite thing. He was fast from the beginning,
		going forward on the randomly laid metal walls.</p>

	<p>A newbie is just a newbie. Going like this, he would fall in seconds. Many people were thinking in their head.
	</p>

	<p>Watching Han Sen going as fast as this, Wang Hou could not help but feel surprised, wondering if Han Sen was a
		true idiot or trying to fall as fast as possible.</p>

	<p>Even Chen Shoushan frowned slightly. If this was all he could do, it would be a waste of Ji Yanran’s energy. Chen
		Shoushan was quite disappointed.</p>
