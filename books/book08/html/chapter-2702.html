<h3>Chapter 2702</h3>

<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen followed the waves of the sea. He
flew in the direction they were coming from. He didn’t dare to
teleport, though. He merely reduced his presence as much as he
could and flew slowly.</p>
<p>Because teleportation caused ripples in the fabric of space,
elites were likely to pick up on such a technique if he used it.
That could allow the people he was tailing to notice his presence,
which he was trying very hard to avoid advertising. It was better
for Han Sen to fly in as slowly and quietly as he could. He
wouldn’t draw as much attention that way.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Explosions sounded one after another. The strong shockwaves they
emitted let Han Sen confirm that it really was the power of Break
Six Skies. He had practiced Break Six Skies before, but he had
never used it to create anything as powerful as the shockwaves that
were now rolling by him. Whoever was using Break Six Skies right
now was far stronger than he was, that was for sure.</p>
<p>“Are those giants really Breakskies? What are they doing here?”
Han Sen was growing more and more suspicious of this whole
situation. He wanted to teleport forward to get there with greater
haste and see what they were doing.</p>
<p>The hyper scary Break Six Skies shockwaves might have suggested
an obscenely dangerous battle was going on, but Han Sen couldn’t
feel any other powers or geno arts being used. If the giants were
fighting some other group, Han Sen should have been able to detect
some evidence of foreign powers.</p>
<p>“Are the giants killing each other, maybe?” Although Han Sen
wanted to find out the truth, he still remained patient and flew
forward slowly. He was careful not to rush.</p>
<p>The sea sloshed and danced like mad with the energy that was
being released. Han Sen flew between the wild waves, figuring they
were a perfect opportunity to hide and remain out of sight.</p>
<p>This sea was unimaginably weird. Han Sen had flown for dozens of
miles, yet he hadn’t seen a single piece of seaweed or ocean
creature. This sea was like distilled water, manmade, and without a
single speck of bacteria.</p>
<p>The palaces that floated on the surface were now far behind Han
Sen. He had passed 300 of them as he flew forward, but that seemed
to be all that there were.</p>
<p>“If each palace contained a giant, then that means there are 300
giants here. That is so many defied elites! That’s almost as
glorious as the legends I’ve heard of Sacred. What kind of people
could have trapped these guys?” Han Sen was growing increasingly
worried about this strange situation he had stumbled into.</p>
<p>Eventually, Han Sen saw a big mountain appear over the horizon.
That mountain quickly swelled to block his vision as he flew toward
it. It looked massive.</p>
<p>The giants, who were possibly Breakskies, had gathered at the
foothills of the mountain. They were all swinging their fists to
wallop the mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been waiting for this moment. The shockwaves of
their blows rushed over him, and he confirmed the nature of the
power. It really was Break Six Skies.</p>
<p>But what surprised Han Sen was that they weren’t fighting. They
were using Break Six Skies to excavate the rocks of the
mountain.</p>
<p>Three hundred giants, all in tight manacles, were like prisoners
condemned to a mining camp. They punched the mountain, breaking
away pieces of rock with a slow, steady rhythm.</p>
<p>The mountain looked grey, and Han Sen had no idea what sort of
stone it was. Even though the giants were unleashing an insane
amount of power as they worked, they only created a hole the size
of one of their fists with each strike.</p>
<p>The 300 giants swung their fists with the implacability of
machines, but the mountain was simply too massive. When the giants’
progress was measured against the immensity of their task, it was
obvious that they were barely making any headway.</p>
<p>“What are these guys doing? It isn’t as if they’re collecting
the stones. Their punches are pretty much destroying the rocks, so
they can’t be after the stone itself.” Han Sen eyed the mountain
curiously.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued flying, checking out the nearby area. Aside
from that huge mountain and 300 giants, Han Sen didn’t see anything
else of note. There was just water in every direction.</p>
<p>Han Sen inched closer to the mountain, but he did not dare get
too close. He was worried there might be creatures lurking about
that he couldn’t detect.</p>
<p>He spent a while watching the giants, but even after a
considerable amount of time, he couldn’t understand what the giants
were doing.</p>
<p>“Are these guys the heirs of Yu Gong? Are all of his children
here, moving this mountain? Or does the mountain possess some kind
of treasure?” Han Sen wondered with interest.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the mountain more closely. God knew how long
the 300 giants had been working there. They had only removed a
small part of the mountain’s foothills. If they were trying to make
a tunnel, it would take years.</p>
<p>“The way they’re striking seems like they’re trying to move the
mountain, not dig into the side of it,” Han Sen thought with a
frown. He decided that he should fly around the mountain. Perhaps
he could find some piece of text carved into the mountain, or
really anything that might shed light on this baffling
situation.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t flown very far around the mountain when his eyes
widened. He came to an abrupt stop.</p>
<p>A giant metal pillar had been pushed into the side of the
mountain. It looked something like the Sky God Pillar,
actually.</p>
<p>Even more strangely, the metal pillar had been rammed through
the chest of a giant. It was pinning him to the mountain.</p>
<p>That giant looked stronger than the other 300 Breakskies that
Han Sen had seen so far. Its armor was crusted with dull, dried
blood. Its blood-matted white hair looked like a waterfall, but it
also obscured the giant’s face. What did he look like? Han Sen had
no idea.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t sense a lifeforce within this massive creature,
but he could definitely sense a presence. It was hard to describe.
When Han Sen looked at the giant, he felt numb. Goosebumps flared
across his skin.</p>
<p>The giant was a dead man pinned to a mountain, but Han Sen felt
as if his presence could break the sun and the moon. It was like
the sky and the ground would be forced to obey this monster.</p>
<p>“How can a dead man have this much power? How strong had he once
been, then?” Han Sen’s shock quickly gave way to confusion. “Are
these giants trying to move the mountain so they can bring this
body down? That is so stupid. Wouldn’t it be easier to dig around
the lance itself? If they follow their current path, they’ll have
to dig through almost the entire mountain in order to bring the
body down.”</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t understand what the giants were thinking, and
so he continued soaring around the mountain to see if he could find
anything else.</p>
<p>He ended up disappointed. He flew around the mountain, but aside
from the pillar and the giant corpse pinned to the mountain, there
was nothing else to find.“The giants have to be after that body,
but the way they’re digging into the rocks makes no sense. There
must be a reason why they cannot bring the body down right away,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen spent a long time watching them from afar. The giants
kept using their fists to shatter stone. They did it would
reprieve.</p>
<p>Han Sen made a calculation. At their current speed, it would
take more than ten thousand years for them to bring the whole
mountain down.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>The bells in the sky rang again. Han Sen raised his head. The
three needles were pointing north again. That meant it was 12
o’clock.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the bell, the giants striking the mountain stopped
their work. They all turned and headed back the way they had
come.</p>
<p>When the giants were gone, Han Sen saw something
unbelievable.</p>
