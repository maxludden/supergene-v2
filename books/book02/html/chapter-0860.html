    <p>
      Han Sen learnt more about Geno Seeds from Ji Yanran. Perusing the
      information she provided him, though, he noted that it wasn&#8217;t very
      substantial. He did learn that Geno Seeds were able to absorb all manners
      of genes, and which genes they absorbed would affect what grew inside
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some could grow geno equipment, whereas others could grow creatures.
      Others could form spirits or beast souls. What they chose to grow was
      influenced by the energies they absorbed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans and spirits knew how to create Geno Seeds that they favored, and
      this was accomplished by injecting the genes of their choice into one.
      Doing so would enable the altered Geno Seed to create what the injector
      specifically sought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Different sanctuaries had different ways of cultivating Geno Seeds. And
      the stuff they produced was different from place to place.
    </p>

    <p>
      But humans lacked a lot of information about Geno Seeds, and as a result,
      Han Sen was unable to discover anything revealing about the nature of his
      gourd or the six Cog armaments.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like this is a mystery that will only reveal itself once I
      reach the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary.&#8221; After Han Sen deleted the
      confidential information he had received, he returned to the sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, he received orders bidding him to join a training
      program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen went back to ask Ji Yanran about it, and she said it was a
      training program of the Alliance. It was something related to the
      Crystallizer civilization. All members of the Daphne had to take part,
      including her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had no choice but to join, since he was issued the order. He
      wasn&#8217;t strong enough to take-on the entire Alliance yet, so he still
      had to adhere to whatever order was given to him by the council.
      Unfortunately for him, however, it threw a wrench in his plans of
      attacking Devil-Blood Shelter again. It would be delayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King had been heavily damaged, and he was lacking his
      former power. Han Sen believed he could take out Devil-Blood Shelter and
      max out his super geno points in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spirit Owl and Death Knell had not finished evolving yet, though, and they
      were two companions he thought he might need. As a result, he didn&#8217;t
      think it&#8217;d do much harm to go to the training program first.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen arrived at the training base at Moka Planet, he was surprised
      to see that it wasn&#8217;t only his team that was receiving the training.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of Crystallizer Ruin research members would receive this training,
      as well. All in all, there were more than ten thousand people there.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen! You are Han Sen, yes?&#8221; Immediately after arriving,
      Han Sen was greeted by someone who fanboyishly recognized him. The man
      hastily moved to intercept him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was quite happy about this, and he couldn&#8217;t help but think,
      &#8220;Haha, I really am rather popular.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I am Han Sen.&#8221; The person in front of him was a
      twenty-year-old soldier. Han Sen was pleased at the reception he was
      given, and he was about to ask the man if he wanted an autograph.
    </p>

    <p>
      But jovially, the young man quickly said, &#8220;It really is you? Sweet!
      Your fiance is the princess of the Alliance, Ji Yanran. We are very fond
      of her.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What the hell?&#8221; Han Sen had rarely felt so awkward. He
      explained to them, &#8220;Well, for what I suspect you will ask next, the
      answer is yes. She will be joining the training program, too. You can see
      her later.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Whoa! Awesome!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      A bunch of soldiers began to babble amongst themselves. Then, a woman
      soldier approached Han Sen and handed him a pen and paper. She politely
      asked, &#8220;Can I have your signature, please?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen noticed that this female soldier was attractively challenged, but
      still he thought, &#8220;Well, at the very least, women have better
      judgment, I suppose.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course.&#8221; Han Sen smiled and accepted the pen and paper,
      ready to scribble his signature. But just as he was about to bring the pen
      down on the paper, the female soldier said, &#8220;Can you write, Ji
      Yanran&#8217;s fiance for your name?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen almost bit his tongue off, and was tempted to grab her clothes and
      yell, &#8220;Are you trying to make me look like a fool? How shameless are
      you, asking me to sign this?!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The female soldier, however, looked like a very shy individual. Despite
      being disheartened, Han Sen complied with her request and proceeded to
      scribble down Ji Yanran&#8217;s fiance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yay! I have obtained the signature of Ji Yanran&#8217;s fiance!
      Woohoo!&#8221; The soldier thanked Han Sen with a frightening amount of
      glee and hugged the paper tightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen heard a familiar voice laughing somewhere nearby. He turned around
      and saw a familiar yet strange shadow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mengmeng?&#8221; Han Sen was very surprised, but still he
      approached her. He had not expected to see Wang Mengmeng there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since he last saw her, she had grown taller. She exuded a sense of greater
      maturity, but her overall appearance was still an undeniable victim of her
      babyface.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Tell me, Handsome; as the fiance of a princess, do you feel
      pressured?&#8221; Wang Mengmeng asked, with her eyes wide open in
      curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Before arriving here, I believed myself to be a figure of greater
      fame than she was.&#8221; Han Sen was feeling hopeless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Mengmeng smiled and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s normal, don&#8217;t
      worry. The president has a beautiful daughter, and it is not uncommon for
      people to crave every tidbit of news about what the president is up to. Of
      course the media chases her, and her title as Princess is formally
      recognized throughout the entire Alliance. Even the news of your triumph
      against Yu Qielan referred to you as &#8216;the princess&#8217;s
      fiance.&#8217;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wasn&#8217;t affected by this, however. He simply shrugged his
      shoulders and said, &#8220;I recall you are a member of the Royal Warframe
      Team, so how come you are here today? Why are you here, taking part in
      today&#8217;s special training?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Honestly? I&#8217;m not sure. Some of us received the order to
      come, whereas others didn&#8217;t. Perhaps there is an important operation
      regarding the Crystallizers?&#8221; Wang Mengmeng hypothesized.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s walk and talk; where is your room?&#8221; Han Sen spoke
      as he walked alongside Wang Mengmeng.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an office of the training camp, an old man watched a video stream of
      the ongoing scene between Han Sen and Wang Mengmeng.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Teacher, would you like to me to bring Han Sen here?&#8221; Wen
      Zhong asked the old man.
    </p>

    <p>
      The old man shook his head and said, &#8220;No, there is no need to. I do
      not wish to make my identity and presence known to him yet. I will
      continue to watch them in secret, in the meantime.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Um, I don&#8217;t think that is very appropriate,&#8221; Wen Zhong
      said, in surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It isn&#8217;t inappropriate. It makes for a compelling watch,
      that&#8217;s all.&#8221; The old man smiled as he looked at Han Sen. Then
      he said, &#8220;I can see the real him like this.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Teacher, do you really want to accept him as a student of
      yours?&#8221; Wen Zhong was hesitant to ask this question, but he did so
      anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe. Maybe not. First, I have to meet with him,&#8221; the old
      man said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I still think it is inappropriate. He hails from the Luo family,
      after all.&#8221; Wen Zhong wore a complicated expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then doesn&#8217;t that make for an even more compelling watch? I,
      Zhuo Donglai, having a student from the Luo family would be rather
      interesting, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; The old man squinted his eyes,
      with a smile that could only be defined as perfect.
