<p>The Red Reaper’s scythe slashed across the Stone Cow’s neck, but
all it dealt was a minor scratch. It couldn’t even be considered an
injury.</p>
<p>After all, there was a level difference between the two. Han Sen
couldn’t blame the Red Reaper for not being strong enough.</p>
<p>But after the attack, the Stone Cow was only enraged. It turned
around and looked at the Red Reaper. It reared with its legs and
stamped down on the ground to create another shockwave.</p>
<p>The Red Reaper was petrified in mid-air. It dropped down to the
ground and cracked, like an ordinary statue.</p>
<p>“Damn! This guy’s petrification is effective. It even took down
the Red Reaper, which is practically smoke. Fortunately, it isn’t
really a creature, and it’s only something shaped by a geno art,”
Han Sen thought, shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body brimmed with energy, and from it, he generated
another Red Reaper. Again, it moved to attack the Stone Cow. Han
Sen wanted to buy some time.</p>
<p>He tried The Story of Genes, the Dongxuan Sutra, Jadeskin, and
the Blood-Pulse Sutra, but none of them could free him from the
petrification.</p>
<p>“Should I use super god spirit mode?” Han Sen frowned. But then,
he suddenly remembered he had the Petrify skill. It was a little
different than the Stone Cow’s petrification, in that he could only
use it on himself. But perhaps it would work here.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast Petrify and petrified his own body. He deepened the
power of the effect, petrifying himself far beyond what the Stone
Cow had managed.</p>
<p>When Han Sen removed his petrification, the Stone Cow’s
petrification disappeared as well.</p>
<p>“I did not expect Petrify to be this useful.” Han Sen
grinned.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Stone Cow had just shattered the Red Reaper. It
angrily turned back toward Han Sen, stomping the ground again to
produce more shockwaves.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out his knife and slashed towards the Stone Cow.
The knife and sword powers synergized into one and came out of
Ghost Teeth Knife’s blade, headed right for the Stone Cow.</p>
<p>The knife and sword power struck the cow’s head. There was a
boom, and the Stone Cow reeled backwards with a deep gash across
its body. The knife and sword power had broken the creature’s
horns.</p>
<p>The Stone Cow shook its head and got up. It wasn’t impaired by
the attack. It roared and ran straight back at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen removed his petrification and slashed towards the Stone
Cow again. The attack wasn’t very effective, though.</p>
<p>It could only move the Stone Cow back a little, and it left him
petrified again.</p>
<p>The Stone Cow’s circular shockwave was an area-of-effect attack.
It did not matter what direction Han Sen attacked from; he was
petrified each time.</p>
<p>As the Stone Cow came for him again, Han Sen decided not to
slash it this time. He used Turtle. And when Han Sen was petrified
the next time, he cast it onto the beast’s head.</p>
<p>A turtle symbol glowed atop the cow’s head. Han Sen thought to
himself, “It does not matter how strong you are, Turtle turns
everyone into a slowpoke.”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen struck again, the Stone Cow stopped and created
more shockwaves.</p>
<p>But this was stronger than the Stone Cow’s previous attacks. Han
Sen removed the petrification, but he also noticed he had slowed
down. He lowered his head and realized that the turtle symbol was
now on him.</p>
<p>“Shit! The Stone Cow can reverse a geno art?” Han Sen was
shocked. The Stone Cow kept stomping and stamping.</p>
<p>Each step sent out another shockwave.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept getting petrified, and each time it happened,
another turtle image appeared on his body.</p>
<p>“F*ck this! This Stone Cow is too creepy.” Han Sen got rid of
the petrification and Turtle effects. Then, he slashed towards the
Stone Cow and ran.</p>
<p>Until he figured out what the thing could do, he would only be
able to kill it with super god spirit.</p>
<p>The Stone Cow was directly behind Han Sen, mooing. It was
extremely annoying, and Han Sen thought, “Wait until I become a
Marquise, and I’ll be back to one-hit kill you. You won’t have
nearly as much fun when you’re not bullying an Earl.”</p>
<p>Han Sen grew more and more frustrated as he ran. The Stone Cow’s
shockwaves kept petrifying him. The Stone Cow would probably have
already killed an average Marquise, especially since they wouldn’t
be able to run away.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen had Petrify and the rabbit shoes.</p>
<p>Han Sen escaped the Stone Cow’s pursuit. He wiped the cold sweat
from his brow and said, “That cannot be a Marquise mutant
xenogeneic!”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to leave just yet. He allowed Spell to
engage her sniper mode, and with it, he used her sniper scope to
watch the Stone Cow.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s nose wrinkled in disgust. The Stone Cow was eating the
other Stone Cow’s meat. It swallowed the xenogeneic gene heart
before Han Sen could take it.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the Stone Cow was angry because its relative had
been murdered. But that thing seemed willing to eat the remains of
its own people. It just wanted to eat the prey that someone else
had gone to the work of killing.</p>
<p>“F*ck you! Let’s see who can last longer.” Han Sen began to
think of ways he might get rid of the Stone Cow.</p>
<p>Its body was hard, so it must have been of the top tier of the
Marquises. It would take multiple attacks at close range to hurt
the Stone Cow.</p>
<p>However, because of the petrifying shockwaves, Han Sen could not
get close. While Han Sen could remove the petrification, it took
time. While he was petrified, Han Sen could not move. It was a
difficult problem.</p>
<p>The scariest thing was how the Stone Cow could flip the turtle
skill back onto him. That was just over-powered.</p>
<p>“No. It is not just reflecting the effect back to me, since the
turtle spell remains active on the Stone Cow. The turtle symbol
only disappeared when the power faded. While under Turtle’s
effects, the Stone Cow did move slower and its shockwave was less
effective. This is not just a reversal of my own attacks,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to prove his theory correct, so he used his
sniper rifle to take aim at the Stone Cow. Then he pulled the
trigger.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled ammo from the Turtle spell. The bullet went
flying towards the Stone Cow.</p>
<p>The thing was still munching on the dead cow’s body when the
bullet smacked into its butt. The image of a turtle appeared on its
bum.</p>
<p>Moo! The Stone Cow spun around angrily, already stomping the
ground to send out shockwaves.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was not petrified, and he did not have the Turtle
skill reversed upon him. The turtle mark was still planted on the
cow’s bum.</p>
<p>“Success,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
