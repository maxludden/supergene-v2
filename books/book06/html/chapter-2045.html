	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body exploded as the blades sliced through it. Another Han Sen rushed Dragon Fifteen from the side.</p>

	<p>Dragon Fifteen flapped his wings, creating a moon-shaped swirl of water. He ran at Han Sen with his cold dragon
		claws raised to strike Han Sen’s heart. Dragon Fifteen hadn’t planned on immediately securing the scale; his
		primary objective was to kill Han Sen.</p>

	<p>The Evilbreaker powers raced toward Han Sen. Even with Han Sen’s speed, avoiding those claws would be difficult.
		Pang!</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body was cut to ribbons, but it was just another Moon clone.</p>

	<p>Dragon Fifteen turned to the Dragon God’s body. Han Sen floated near the corpse as he stuffed the scale into his
		pocket.</p>

	<p>Dragon Fifteen came at Han Sen furiously, but Han Sen swam away with the grace of a fish. He was swimming at a
		pace much greater than Dragon Fifteen was capable of.</p>

	<p>Han Sen put some distance between Dragon Fifteen and himself, but just as he started to relax, a lance came at
		him through the water. It was Long Ying.</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew now that he had been tricked. Long Ying had not left, and her departure was only to lure him out.
	</p>

	<p>“Nice plan.” Han Sen did not have time to think. The lance light covered a radius of a hundred meters beneath
		that sea, keeping him from escaping. There was nothing Han Sen could do, so he pulled out his Blood Feather
		Knife and used his knife and sword powers. He blocked the lance that was coming for him.</p>

	<p>Long Ying wanted to prevent Han Sen’s escape, so she cast many more lance lights. Each of the lance powers was
		weakened, however.</p>

	<p>But every time Han Sen used his knife to deflect the lance light, the impact bounced him away. His chest felt
		like it was getting struck by lightning, and the pain was fierce.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wasn’t bleeding yet, though. He tried to use those impacts to toss him further away from Long Ying. But
		Dragon Fifteen was already behind him, and when his Evilbreaker claws came for Han Sen, they tried to snare him
		like an ugly net.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s vision suddenly flashed into a view of sequence structures composed of molecules. He kept swinging his
		Blood Feather Knife, striking back against the claw light. He managed to break it, and then it turned into
		nothing. Not stopping, Han Sen continued his flight into the deeper reaches of the sea.</p>

	<p>Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying paused for a moment, stunned that an Earl had been able to break Dragon Fifteen’s
		claw light. Dragon Fifteen had recognized the Blood Feather Knife, and his face darkened.</p>

	<p>“That is Han Sen! Do not let him flee.”</p>

	<p>“I won’t let him escape again.” Long Ying looked cold. She became a dragon xenogeneic, and she flapped her dragon
		wings in pursuit of Han Sen.</p>

	<p>As Han Sen fled, he continuously swung his knife to weave knife silks into the water.</p>

	<p>Long Ying kept coming, though, cutting through the knife silks as she moved. The knife silks were unable to do
		anything to her Duke xenogeneic body.</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>Long Ying attacked Han Sen again. That lance power was stronger than the previous attack. Han Sen’s Blood Feather
		Knife almost couldn’t withstand it, and his body rocketed down into the sea bed. He sank into the crater the
		impact had formed, and the sand and rocks rose to cover his shape.</p>

	<p>“Escaping won’t be that easy.” Long Ying spun her lance into a blur, forming a vortex in the water. All the sand
		and rocks were sucked away from Han Sen’s hiding place, clearing the water.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had planned to escape under the cover of the sand, but now he was visible, and the vortex slowed down his
		movements. He couldn’t escape quickly.</p>

	<p>Dragon Fifteen caught up. Her claw lights flashed at Han Sen like a meteor shower.</p>

	<p>Han Sen decided to stop fighting the current and allow the water to jerk him towards Dragon Fifteen. He used his
		Blood Feather Knife alongside Super Spank.</p>

	<p>Dragon Fifteen did not wish to fight Han Sen, though. He started to fall back, swinging his claws as he went. The
		Blood Feather Knife broke every claw into dust, but it took too much time. Long Ying was again in front of Han
		Sen, with an attack prepped.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used his knife with Super Spank powers, and he almost broke the lance’s sequence structure. But the lance
		knocked Han Sen away, all the same. Something in his chest tore and blood spilled out of his mouth and nose.</p>

	<p>Long Ying and Dragon Fifteen did not let Han Sen rest. They kept up a continuous string of attacks.</p>

	<p>If Dragon Fifteen had been there alone, Han Sen could have fought him off. Long Ying was not a strong Duke, but
		her level was still equal to a xenogeneic Sharon. Han Sen didn’t have much of a chance.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used his Moon clones to absorb a few attacks, but things were taking a turn for the worse. A lance was
		eventually able to break his armor and thrust into his shoulder.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s movements slowed as he sustained more and more injuries. Dragon Fifteen’s claws were able to land on
		Han Sen, digging in a few bloody trenches into his back.</p>

	<p>Long Ying’s lance flashed furiously. It struck whenever Han Sen was distracted by Dragon Fifteen’s attacks.</p>

	<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and suppressed the pain from his wounds. He lifted the Blood Feather Knife to repel
		Long Ying’s lance.</p>

	<p>Duke powers were scary. After that hit, Han Sen was knocked to the bottom of the sea again. Blood came oozing out
		of him.</p>

	<p>The sand and debris rose, and Long Ying used her lance to clear the area again. Han Sen’s body had formed a deep
		hole. But when Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying cleared the hole all the way to the bottom, they were shocked. Han
		Sen was not there.</p>

	<p>They searched for Han Sen, but he was gone. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.</p>

	<p>Dragon Fifteen looked like fury incarnate. Han Sen had just vanished and taken the half-deified Upside-Down Scale
		with him.</p>

	<p>“Send word. Find Han Sen, even if you have to drain the Return Ruin Sea. Bring him to me, dead or alive.” Dragon
		Fifteen looked cold.</p>

	<p>Long Ying was depressed. She couldn’t figure out how Han Sen had escaped.</p>

	<p>Long Ying did not need to leave the water to contact others of their race. She got on her phone and spread the
		news. Help came to move Dragon God’s body, and she ordered other Dragons and xenogeneics to search for Han Sen
		throughout the Return Ruin Sea.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body appeared in a house in the Alliance, but he started coughing up blood as soon as he arrived.</p>

	<p>The powers of an Earl were weak. Unless he used super god spirit, he’d be unable to match a Duke. So, he came
		back to the Alliance.</p>

	<p>“It is lucky I brought the scale back with me. Otherwise, it would have been a grand loss.” Han Sen licked his
		lips as he stroked the blue Upside-Down Scale.</p>
