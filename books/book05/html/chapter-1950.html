<p>“Han Sen! I’ve brought harm down on you. I cannot believe the
Buddha had an ulterior motive for inviting me there.” Back on the
ship, Yisha placed the ant down on the table and sighed.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to speak, but he could not. He had become an ant,
and he could no longer use any geno arts. He really was like a
normal ant.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not frightened by his new state, though. He started
skittering across the table, writing something out by the way he
was moving. “The few items I had were stolen by Burning Lamp. He
took my deified Knife Blank.”</p>
<p>When Yisha saw Han Sen writing this out, she looked overjoyed.
She said, “You still have a will of your own?”</p>
<p>“I am aware, yes. What’s wrong?” Han Sen wrote.</p>
<p>“Burning Lamp’s geno art can change the genes of a being. He can
turn a member of the higher races into a primal creature. Even
their brains are reduced to the level of an animal. He didn’t kill
you because turning into an ant is a worse fate. It would make you
feel hopeless. There is no way he’d go easy on you, though, so it
is strange to see that you still possess your own will. Are you
sure you are okay?”</p>
<p>Han Sen considered his body. Aside from being an ant, and being
unable to use geno arts with a human body, he had not been
affected.</p>
<p>Han Sen explained the situation to her and asked, “How do we
break the spell of this geno art, so I can have my proper body
back?”</p>
<p>Yisha’s expression looked sickened, and she said, “You can’t.
You really are an ant now. Unless there is a deified elite with the
same talent, you are stuck like this.”</p>
<p>There must be another deified elite with his geno art around.
What about Kong Fei?” Han Sen asked. He didn’t want to be stuck as
an ant.</p>
<p>Yisha gave a wry smile, and she said, “Every deified elite has a
skill of their own. Kong Fei is strong, yes, but he is not talented
with loop geno arts. He cannot help you get your body back.”</p>
<p>After a while, Yisha spoke again. She said, “From what I know,
there is a deified elite that can do this, but I don’t know where
he is. Even if I wanted to ask him, I wouldn’t know where to find
him.”</p>
<p>Han Sen gave a wry smile, but he wasn’t going to give up. He
said, “Don’t worry, my Queen. If this is just a geno art, then
there is surely a way it can be broken. I will be fine, sooner or
later.”</p>
<p>Yisha shook her head and said, “If I become deified, I will
destroy that Buddha Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“Yes, destroy it!” Han Sen was so angry.</p>
<p>It was the Buddha that commanded Seven Spirit to kill Han Sen,
and they almost succeeded. But now they had been bold enough to do
this. The Buddha were clearly impossible to reason with.</p>
<p>“I need power. That’s my focus now, and I need that power if I
am to level the Buddha Kingdom,” Han Sen thought. He was furious
over what had happened.</p>
<p>The news about Han Sen being turned into an ant by Burning Lamp
had traveled to every corner of the universe. Many of them felt
sorry for what had occurred, whereas others mocked him. Most people
were just curious, though. They didn’t care what he did next.</p>
<p>Han Sen obviously had no future now that he had been turned into
an ant. He had a body that belonged to one of the most primal
creatures, so his intelligence would be extremely low. It was
unlikely he could practice anything. He wouldn’t even be able to
generate a geno armor.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had been able to kill Seven Spirit. It was a shame
that someone of such strength had met such an ignoble end.</p>
<p>Han Sen rested on board the ship. Little Invisible and Ghost
Teeth Knife were next to him. Yisha had retrieved them for him.</p>
<p>Han Sen had felt something was wrong just before Burning Lamp
struck him. He had tossed Little Invisible and Ghost Teeth Knife to
Yisha, but the moment he threw them, Burning Lamp had snatched him
off the ground. He couldn’t give his other items to her, and so
Burning Lamp had taken them all.</p>
<p>He hadn’t minded losing most of his things, but the half-deified
Knife Blank was a wonderful item. He felt very bitter over that
being lost.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to use his powers while he was an ant. The
Dongxuan Sutra, the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and Jadeskin had become
completely useless for him. They were geno arts purposed for the
human body. They did not work while he was an ant.</p>
<p>But when he ran The Story of Genes, it ran as smoothly as
always. Because it functioned without a hitch, there was nothing to
impede his continued study of the geno art. He could even make use
of Spell.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt very relieved when he discovered this. If he was
able to use some of his power, then he could be fixed. There was
hope.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to try using his super god spirit mode to escape
the ant form, but Yisha was on the ship, and she would surely
notice if he used it. Even if he successfully turned back into a
human, it would be a poor situation.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained patient, and he followed Yisha back to Narrow
Moon. Yisha did not take him back to Planet Eclipse. He was put in
the palace on Planet Blade.</p>
<p>Han Sen requested to go back to Planet Eclipse, but he wasn’t
permitted. So, he performed his The Story of Genes in front of
Yisha and summoned Spell.</p>
<p>Yisha saw it, and she was shocked. “It looks like you haven’t
turned into a primitive creature at all. Maybe it is because of
this The Story of Genes. This strange geno art is special. It can
even disrupt deified powers. If you make it up to King-class, I
cannot begin to imagine what it might do.”</p>
<p>“My Queen, do you see? I have turned into an ant, but I still
have the powers of a Viscount. You should send me to Planet
Eclipse, because I have stuff to do there.” Han Sen was now using
Spell to communicate with Yisha.</p>
<p>“Okay, and I will focus on finding you a way to get your body
back.” Yisha seemed to have a thought, and she began searching
through her records. She returned with a geno art. “You’ve turned
into an ant, so you cannot make use of most geno arts. This skill,
called Consume, is a geno art that belonged to a Consuming Ant.
They are an old higher race, so perhaps it can help you in the time
being.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know why Yisha had given him the skill of
Consume to learn. But it did suggest that she feared for Han Sen’s
possible recovery. If he practiced as an ant, there might be hope.
It wouldn’t be over.</p>
<p>Han Sen let Spell accept Consume, and then he went to Planet
Eclipse. He wanted to find out if super god spirit could turn him
back into a human.</p>
<p>Super god spirit gave him a certain amount of immunity to
certain types of attacks, so it should have worked.</p>
