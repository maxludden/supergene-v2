<h2>Rabbit Teeth</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1809</h3>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke’s body morphed into something large and twisted.
The messed-up skin of his body started to clothe itself in grey
fur.</p>
<p>__Argh!”</p>
<p>The scream became a roar. His eyes turned red. His body was like
an elephant covered with thick grey fur.</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke had looked like a human once, but now he had
become a big grey rabbit. The rabbit’s teeth were as sharp as
scythes. It was frightening.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Rocks Fall Duke is now a xenogeneic,” Hawk Wing screamed
as he tried to escape.</p>
<p>But the path they had come along was barred with silk, and there
wasn’t the smallest of crevice or seam.</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke lost his mind when he became the giant grey
rabbit. The red eyes turned to look upon his former party, and then
the creature pounced towards them with a spring from his back feet.
He was much faster as a xenogeneic than he had been before.</p>
<p>Not even the Chaos were as fast and strong as that creature.</p>
<p>Han Sen fell back, but there wasn’t really anywhere to go.</p>
<p>“Is that the liquid you want? That stuff down there? That’s the
Xenogeneic geno fluid?” Han Sen asked Yisha, who was staying next
to him.</p>
<p>Since Rocks Fall Duke had become a xenogeneic, it sounded like
what she wanted.</p>
<p>Yisha shook her head, though. She quietly said, “No. Don’t you
see that Rocks Fall Duke has lost his mind? The geno fluid I want
is one that can allow me to become a xenogeneic while keeping
control of my mind. It isn’t like this at all. I think the real
juice is in the big sphere.”</p>
<p>The big rabbit, Rocks Fall Duke, was coming for them. It was
going towards Hawk Wing first.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing was so slow compared to the rabbit. He pulled out a
rod and tried to whack the bunny.</p>
<p>The Chaos had taken away all their weaponry, so they were unsure
where he had hidden that weapon to avoid detection. Katcha!</p>
<p>The rabbit’s teeth closed on Hawk Wing’s rod. The rabbit gnawed
on it as if it was a carrot. It was bitten in half!</p>
<p>“Fuck! The teeth are so strong. My rod is made of the same wood
the Chaos use for their weapons. I can’t believe this thing broke
my rod. Think of something, please!” Hawk Wing fell backward.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic rabbit’s body was so big, but it was incredibly
agile at the same time. It jumped towards Vic next Vic merely
grunted, and he brought out his dagger again. He ran forward and
swiped right past the rabbit</p>
<p>The rabbit’s body was cut, and blood seeped out onto the
floor.</p>
<p>Vic’s dagger and Sky-Demon power were a strong combination, but
in Demon Grave, that too was suppressed. Even though his dagger was
sharp, and he couldn’t miss, he could only pierce the monster’s
skin. He couldn’t damage any internal organs.</p>
<p>The rabbit was too big, and its hide was very thick. Vic could
not plunge his dagger in very far.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic rabbit was angered by the fact it had been hurt a
little, though. And it stared at Vic, launching itself towards him
with a push of its back feet</p>
<p>Vic wouldn’t miss, but he was not invincible. The xenogeneic
rabbit’s power and speed were frighteningly strong, and Vic did not
dare let himself get bitten. It’d only take a single bite for his
entire body to be cut in half.</p>
<p>“What are you guys waiting for? If you don’t help me, you will
still end up eaten by the thing.” Vic kept dodging the rabbit’s
attacks as he shouted at Han Sen and Yisha.</p>
<p>In less than a minute, Vic’s body was covered in many wounds.
His speed and power were suffering, as a result. He could not fight
the rabbit, and he was only managing to stay alive through crafty
evasion.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Yisha looked at each other. Han Sen nodded and drew
his scabbard. Yisha had no weapon, and yet she still approached
with her bare hands.</p>
<p>When the rabbit jumped at Vic, Yisha used her hands like a sword
and swung at the creature’s back. A purple mist was emitted, and
the back was delivered a foot-long swipe mark. Blood welled out of
the torn flesh.</p>
<p>Yisha’s Teeth power was far stronger than Rocks Fall Duke’s. It
was better than Han Sen’s, as well.</p>
<p>The Teeth power Han Sen had learned was taken from the
knifemind, and so he was just a beginner. While Han Sen’s knifemind
was growing stronger than Yisha’s, his skills still weren’t up to
par.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his scabbard like a sword, and while the xenogeneic
rabbit was hurt and roaring in pain, he thrust it into the
monster’s eye. Red and white stuff started to ooze out of the
gouged eye, causing it even more pain.</p>
<p>The rabbit squealed and swung its claws as it tried to grab Han
Sen. But Han Sen had already leaped away like a bird, his jump
carrying him along a graceful arc.</p>
<p>Vic used this chance to slash the rabbit’s throat. Blood
cascaded from the wound.</p>
<p>Yisha then slashed at the rabbit’s head, which generated a wound
so deep that you could see the bone beyond the bloody flesh.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing was helping, too. His power was good, but he no longer
had a weapon. He didn’t have skills like Teeth power, either. He
punched the rabbit, which did pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>With their repeated attacks, Vic managed to get in multiple
solid hits. And seeing that the rabbit’s head was about to be
lopped off, Han Sen swung his scabbard and broke through the
monster’s neck. The creature died.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Duke hunted; xenogeneic gene found. Xenogeneic beast
soul obtained: Teeth Rabbit.”</p>
<p>Han Sen, upon hearing the announcement, was given a shock.
Xenogeneic Rocks Fall Duke was strong, but it felt like battling a
mere Viscount. He still got registered for the rank, though, and he
had managed to nab a nifty new beast soul. It was all quite
surprising.</p>
<p>Han Sen was ready to take the rabbit’s teeth. Quite obviously,
that had to be the xenogeneic material.</p>
<p>“Back off!” Vic held his dagger up and prohibited Han Sen’s
approach.</p>
<p>“Mister Vic, do not forget that without our help, you would be
dead. These materials belong to us,” Han Sen immediately told
Vic.</p>
