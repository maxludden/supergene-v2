    <p>
      Annie returned to her room. She reclaimed the videotape she had watched
      earlier and sent it via a special communicator.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, in the same office, a middle-aged man opened the
      videotape. After watching it, he closed his eyes and reclined in his seat.
      It seemed as if he was resting, but then he opened his eyes and looked at
      the video once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;One mind controlling two things; is this really the heir of Han
      Jing? Is Han Jing&#8217;s prediction going to turn out correct?&#8221; The
      middle-aged man furrowed his eyebrows as he spoke to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The communicator on his table rang again. He looked at the number and
      smiled. He picked up the call and saw the image of a beautiful woman fill
      the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yanran, where did you find the time to talk with your old man
      today? Shouldn&#8217;t you be spending your free time with your
      boyfriend?&#8221; the middle-aged man joked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran blushed and said, &#8220;Dad, what are you talking about? You
      know I always care about you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know my daughter cares about me, worry not. But recently, you
      have been spending less and less time communicating with me. If you do
      have the time, try and talk to your mother once in a while, as well. I
      know she can be mean, but she loves you and misses you dearly,&#8221; the
      middle-aged man said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know, father. I was just talking to Mom, and yes, she kept
      complaining about me,&#8221; Ji Yanran said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Right, wait until Han Sen has finished serving in the army before
      introducing him to your mother. You two aren&#8217;t young anymore, and if
      there aren&#8217;t any issues prohibiting it, you both should get married
      sometime. I am still waiting for my grandkids.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dad, you really want me to get married that much?&#8221; Ji
      Yanran&#8217;s face was red, but she was happy to know how accepting her
      father was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you saying that kid named Han isn&#8217;t good enough for you?
      Fine, I&#8217;ll get Annie to throw him into the Black-Plague Star and get
      him chained up in some mine somewhere. He can dig there for the rest of
      his days while you go and find someone you like,&#8221; the old man
      jested, with a cold face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Daughters always knew what their fathers thought, and Ji Yanran knew
      exactly what this middle-aged man was thinking, too. She laughed and said,
      &#8220;Fine, quit your kidding about. When he&#8217;s done serving the
      army, I&#8217;ll bring him around so he can meet you and mother. If you
      aren&#8217;t satisfied, I&#8217;ll throw him into the Black-Plague Star
      myself!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You seem quite confident. It looks like my daughter really has been
      attracted by someone. To think that the daughter I have had for 20 years
      will be taken away…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dad, can we quit pretending? Let&#8217;s talk like normal!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After the call ended, the middle-aged man&#8217;s smile soon faded away.
      He carefully perused the information Annie had sent him, along with the
      videotape. His fingers tapped the table as he read, and he didn&#8217;t
      say a word until he was done.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Jing Zhi, you cause much unrest even in death.&#8221; After a
      break of silence, the old man sighed. He closed the information tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      Battling Annie must have cost Han Sen a lot of willpower. After their
      encounter, Han Sen retired for the day and did not continue training his
      Dual sword skill. He returned to his bedroom and laid down on his bed,
      reading news on Skynet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many media stations in the Alliance were covering the coming election for
      a new leader. This was a massive event for the Alliance. Nominees from
      every system were selling themselves, scrambling for every vote they could
      claim.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the list of nominees, Han Sen spotted a strange name that evoked a
      sense of familiarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If Ji Ruo Zhen became leader…&#8221; Han Sen read it once and then
      sighed. A puzzled expression spread across his face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, he decided to read about other topics, including one that pertained
      to shelters. Apparently, some genius kid managed to evolve before he was
      20 years old. A surpasser killed a certain sacred-blood creature. Some
      demigod used a punch to break a shura battleship, etcetera, etcetera…
      These news topics, however, were enough to bore someone to tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I don&#8217;t become a demigod, it&#8217;ll be far more
      difficult for me to ascend and become better than everyone else.&#8221;
      Han Sen&#8217;s eyes were shining, confident in his ability to one day
      become a demigod. But first, he&#8217;d have to become flawless with all
      the basics. If he didn&#8217;t, he could very well die.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, no human had been able to enter the Fifth Sanctuary. And that was
      why nobody knew what it looked like on the inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not want to rule the world, he just wanted to be free. He
      didn&#8217;t want to be governed by the whims of others, restricted and
      restrained from doing what he wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      The death of Han Sen&#8217;s father was a mystery, as well. If he did not
      have the power he sought, he might never uncover the truth about his
      death.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen was lost deep in thought, the communicator rang. It was Yang
      Manli. Han Sen knew Yang Manli would not seek him out if it wasn&#8217;t
      something important, and as he answered the call, her entire body filled
      the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am afraid you have a problem.&#8221; Yang Manli wore a grave
      expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;And what problem would that be?&#8221; Han Sen casually asked.
      Problems followed him wherever he went, so what was one more to the
      equation?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The special security group has given us a mission. It is to protect
      a person who has just levelled up and reached the Second Shelter,&#8221;
      Yang Manli promptly explained.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Is he from our Goddess Shelter?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, he&#8217;s from the ice fields. He&#8217;s over in Starwheel
      Shelter, right now,&#8221; Yang Manli said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this person special in any capacity?&#8221; Han Sen didn&#8217;t
      think Yang Manli would refer to this person as a problem if he were any
      ordinary person.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the son, Dong Sen,&#8221; Yang Manli said, heavily.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was quite shocked, and so he said, &#8220;That is quite the
      coincidence!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is. That is why I said you are in trouble. That man
      wouldn&#8217;t idly sit back and watch you claim the Blackgod Shelter, and
      your men are the ones who are listening to Dong Li. With his son there,
      it&#8217;ll be difficult to maintain our hold on the Blackgod
      Shelter,&#8221; Yang Manli said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they have made us become his guardian. That
      Dong Li got me good, and it&#8217;s not like I can reject this
      responsibility,&#8221; Han Sen said and smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can smile at a time like this?&#8221; Yang Manli rolled her
      eyes. If she were in Han Sen&#8217;s position, she doubted she could eat.
      But there Han Sen was, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, Han Sen smiled. Then he said, &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I smile
      and laugh? No matter how much he has planned, control of the shelter
      resides firmly on the feeble shoulders of his son. He might not have what
      it takes. And besides, there is protocol to follow. There is no way Dong
      Li will be able to kick us out.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe you are right, but if those people don&#8217;t listen to you
      and follow the son&#8217;s command instead, what will you do?&#8221; Yang
      Manli thought Han Sen was being too naive.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s fine by me. But for as long as I am around, the
      Blackgod Shelter will be too. If I am gone, then the shelter will be
      destroyed. It&#8217;s as simple as that,&#8221; Han Sen said, with a
      streak of cold in his tone. Still, he did sound calm.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Yang Manli heard what he said, she felt a frightful chill race down
      her spine. Beneath Han Sen&#8217;s calm voice, Yang Manli could feel the
      slither of something sinister. It was something she had never felt from
      Han Sen before today.
    </p>

    <p>Yang Manli took a deep breath. &#8220;He wants to see you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sort it out tomorrow; it&#8217;s too late right now.&#8221; Han Sen
      was exhausted and could not muster the motivation to travel to the shelter
      again today. He talked with Yang Manli for a while longer and then hung
      up.
