  “Hunted Annihilation God Spirit gene race Hate Ghost.”

It was just a simple announcement that played in which nothing got left behind. Even Hate Ghost’s dust was absorbed by the tai chi substance. The kill was so clean that not a single speck of him remained.

An orb fell down. It was the size of a dragon ball. It did not have any dust on it. It looked like a pearl.

“The Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power is so scary.” Han Sen reached his hands out to grab the orb. His face displayed a mixture of expressions.

He had to admit he was shocked. He had only changed the rules around Hate Ghost to let the universal cogwheels spin at a much faster pace. That was what produced that terrifying effect. It just killed an Annihilation God Spirit gene race. It was very scary.

Fortunately, Han Sen’s Break World power had just been formed. Its effectiveness was not particularly long. It could only go on for two seconds. The tai chi substance that had been modified went back to what it was before.

It was already quite impressive. Han Sen had only made a few simple changes to alter the size of the cogwheels. He had not manipulated the running speed of the entire sequence of substance chains, yet he had managed to do something that terrifying. That was just a simple change. If he did a complicated change, he had no clue what might happen.

Han Sen was now entering uncharted waters with the Dongxuan Sutra. There was nothing more to learn with it. He was now on his own for every step he took. Regarding what the effect of changing the universal cogwheels could mean, Han Sen would have to find out all of that by himself.

Han Sen thought, “How does one reach the end of the Break World path? Which path did Qin Xiu traverse? The black crystal armor’s power is very mysterious. Even The Story of Genes was created through the help of the black crystal armor. If Qin Xiu is able to control the black crystal armor, there is no way for me to accurately gauge his strength.”

“Dad, this orb looks pretty. Can I have it?” Bao’er looked at Han Sen, who was holding the Avoid Dust Orb in his hand.

Han Sen held the Avoid Dust Orb. He felt Dust Sky’s tai chi substance avoid it. He now knew what that orb did.

His Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World attempt had succeeded. Dust Sky’s rules had no bearing on him now. Therefore, holding onto the orb was pointless for him to do.

“Of course, you can. If you want it, and as long as it does not bring harm to anyone, I will give it to you.” Han Sen gave the Avoid Dust Orb to Bao’er and patted her on the head.

Without the help of Bao’er’s little gourd, there was a 90% he would have faced a disastrous event.

Bao’er collected the Avoid Dust Orb and merrily placed it inside the little gourd. She put it next to her ear and gave it a shake. She then put the gourd away.

“This is not a place we should stay in for much longer. We should think about leaving.” Han Sen picked up Bao’er and teleported away. He knew he was not Qin Xiu’s enemy, but it was pointless to stay. Besides, Han Sen wanted to go back to the geno universe. He had to tell the people in Space Garden that they needed to be prepared.

Qin Xiu had the God Chaos Party on his side. The 33 skies were going to be broken soon. The two universes would not be separated forever.

“Let me go see God Hall Leader first. I should inform him that Qin Xiu has been reborn.” Han Sen left the 33 skies. He wore the Sky God Crown and entered the God of Wealth Temple. He used the God of Wealth Temple to enter the geno hall.

“I see. It is no wonder I was unable to find Qin Xiu’s spirit. I did not expect him to do something like this, though.” God Hall Leader fell into a deep phase of contemplation when he heard the sequence of events from Han Sen.

“What is that black crystal armor?” Han Sen had always been very curious about that.

The power of the black crystal armor was amazing. It made all kinds of creatures evolve. That power alone was enough to shock the whole universe. On top of that, the black crystal armor must have had another power Han Sen was not yet aware of.

Although Han Sen had owned the black crystal armor for a long time, he had not really controlled or paid much attention to it. In fact, he did not really know much about it at all.

“If I have guessed things correctly, it is the gene origin,” God Hall Leader said.

“What is a gene origin?” Han Sen had heard about this before, but he never really understood what it meant.

God Hall Leader sighed and said, “It is something that is very hard to explain. You can treat it as the beginning of a gene.”

“Do these things really exist?” Han Sen did not dare believe it.

Every creature was born in a different environment. The structure of everything’s genes was different. If all the creatures had the same origin, which was what was being suggested, Han Sen found it impossible to believe.

God Hall Leader laughed and said, “Let’s not mention the fact that you don’t believe it, but there was a time when I didn’t believe it either. I heard what you said, so it really does sound like the legendary gene origin. If it is not the beginning of all things, then how could it make those creatures evolve?”

“What you are saying makes sense, but it is still hard to believe something like that.” Han Sen did not dare believe it.

“Now is not the time to say something like that,” God Hall Leader said. “If I have guessed things correctly, Qin Xiu has not yet come to fully control the gene origin. We have got to kill him before he takes full control of the gene origin or find a way to get the gene origin back.”

“That is something you’ll need to consider. I am just a small human, so I do not have what it takes to mop up these messes.” After Han Sen said that, he turned around to leave.

He had a grudge against Qin Xiu, but he did not want to be a toy soldier for the God Spirits.

God Hall Leader did not plan on stopping Han Sen. He watched him leave. He then said to himself, “Although I am God, I cannot predict the universe, and I cannot see the future. Qin Xiu has calculated so much, but he will never figure out there was an accident. The future depends on that accident. If the accident wants to turn the tide, the tide will turn.”

Han Sen returned to the God of Wealth Temple. He used the Sky God Crown to get another ability. All God Spirits had that ability, but they had a time limit.

The Sky God Crown was spinning. Han Sen’s entire body was wrapped up by god light as he traveled through space. When Han Sen’s vision returned, the things around him already had changes that flipped the sky and the earth.

“This is… Extreme King… I am back…” Han Sen’s body felt very light. He was no longer restricted by the universe he was in. He looked around and felt genuinely good. Although using the Sky God Crown to enter the geno universe had a short time limit, it did not much matter. He was back, and that was what mattered the most.

Han Sen could not wait to use Galaxy Teleportation to enter Space Garden first.

Galaxy Teleportation was able to stop other people but not Han Sen. He teleported into Space Garden, but it was almost an unrecognizable place. He could not believe how it looked.

Space Garden was far scarier than it was before. God-class plant Xenogeneics and scary plants were everywhere.

“I have only been gone two years,” Han Sen said with shock. “Why have there been so many big changes?”
