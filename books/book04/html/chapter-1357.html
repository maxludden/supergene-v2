    <p>
      Without hesitation or concern for himself, Han Sen reached for Bao’er to
      place her behind him. But before he could, the doll’s eyes flashed red.
      Then, strangely, it looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen examined Bao’er, and much to his relief, he saw she had not been
      turned into wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This came as quite the surprise. Judging from the doll’s behavior and
      facial expression, it would seem as if it had cast its power, but it
      simply had not worked on the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doll’s eyes flashed with that same red, menacing light again. It also
      spoke, and it said, “You have all been added to the Naughty List. Start
      cleaning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The doll’s eyes flashed like a bright, oscillating light, as they turned
      to look at Han Sen. He had summoned his crystal egg, but before he could
      muster the strength for a throw, he began turning into wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady, who had leapt up from her seat to fight with her cleaver
      in-hand, was starting to turn into a deadwood puppet now, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen found himself unable to move, and the doll and its powers were far
      stronger than he had expected them to be. Dragon Lady’s silver core could
      not resist the encroaching woodening, and neither could Han Sen’s
      Jadeskin. The butler was effortlessly turning them all into dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe this isn’t a bronze shelter, after all. Maybe it’s a silver one,”
      Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doll had turned its attention back to Bao’er by this point, and its
      eyes repeatedly flashed.
    </p>
    <p>Fortunately, and curiously, the powers had no effect on Bao’er.</p>
    <p>
      “Start cleaning.” As if it was programmed to, the butler repeated this
      command every few seconds. It was a rather sinister thing to hear, over
      and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er looked incredibly angry at the butler. She didn’t like the way her
      master or her friends were being treated, and so she pulled out her gourd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler despised disobedience, and the fact that he couldn’t turn her
      into wood prompted him to move forward to try to grab her. But before he
      could, Han Sen’s wooden body suddenly started to glow white.
    </p>
    <p>
      This came as another surprise for the butler. The wooded skin began to
      evaporate, returning Han Sen to normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have been added to the Naughty List. Start dying!” Han Sen shouted,
      as he glowed with a luminosity that made direct eye-contact impossible. A
      few seconds later, a punch was unleashed towards the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doll was shocked, acknowledging the power that was suddenly headed its
      way. The fiend flashed its eyes a number of times to repel it, but nothing
      worked. The bright light wielded by Han Sen laid the smackdown.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The doll’s body was immediately destroyed, as a flurry of wood chips
      peppered the air and rained across the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Silver Geno Core destroyed: Butler Doll. Silver Geno Core obtained:
      Butler Doll.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the storm of wood bits, one suddenly rose and shot over to Han Sen.
      Then, it entered his Sea of Soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen exited super king spirit mode, and when he went to check the item
      he had received, he saw an odd doll sitting in his Sea of Soul. It was
      around the same size as a human’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>Butler Doll: Wood Element Silver Geno Core</p>
    <p>
      When the doll was destroyed, Dragon Lady and Cheap Sheep were freed from
      their wooden bindings. Their bodies had returned to normal, but their
      mental composure hadn’t. That was because they had both been stunned by
      what they had just witnessed Han Sen perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes had been stuck in place while they were dolls, so they did not
      see the super king spirit mode clearly. But they had seen a bright white
      light utterly annihilate the pompous butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      A set of staircases in the lobby suddenly opened, one that led to a
      hallway that ended at an ominous-looking door. They figured that had to
      lead to the spirit hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boss Bub! You are so powerful and handsome. You must be a god amongst the
      demigods, and oh, I cannot express how deeply my admiration for you has
      penetrated my soul,” the sheep waxed lyrical.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen broke the butler, Cheap Sheep well and truly acknowledged
      who the real deal was, in their party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen ignored what he said and simply took Bao’er along with him to the
      door. Beyond it, as suspected, was the spirit hall and residing statue.
      Strangely, the statue’s forehead was empty. There was no spirit nor
      creature residing in this place, after all. But the statue was made of
      silver, indicating it was indeed a silver shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this surprised Han Sen’s companions even more, for they now knew he
      had been able to destroy a silver geno core with as little as a single
      punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen asked the chef, “Do you want to place your spirit stone there?”
    </p>
    <p>She shook her head and said, “This is not what I seek.”</p>
    <p>
      When spirits put their stone inside a statue, it was nearly impossible for
      them to become unbound from the place they had put it. They had to live in
      a shelter of their choosing, lest their stone get destroyed or claimed. As
      such, a shelter had to be selected carefully, and they had to ensure it
      met their every demand and satisfied each of their needs.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen summoned Moment Queen and instead made the shelter hers.</p>
    <p>
      He could still use the teleporter, but he’d be unable to enable the
      defense systems of the shelter, control the security, and unlock doors
      without a spirit occupying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moment Queen made sure to look at Han Sen with disdain before she put her
      stone inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed Han Sen, though. For better or for worse, she was stuck with
      him, and for whatever reason he wanted her around, he was stuck with her.
      And if they ever did want to move, Han Sen could always take out the
      spirit stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the chef’s allegiance was of a similar guarantee, she could have done
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite surprised to witness Han Sen summon a spirit, though.
      Although Moment Queen was still very weak, Dragon Lady could tell she was
      something special.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Moment Queen occupying the shelter, Han Sen was immeasurably happy.
      It was a well-hidden place that was sure to have no intruders, but better
      than that, the treasures of the shelter should have remained untouched
      without a prior occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treasure possessed by the shelter must have included a silver geno
      core, so Han Sen eagerly went to take a look and see what he could get his
      mitts on.
