    <p>
      Han Sen was in the midst of preparing for his journey. His road up to the
      Black Desert would most likely be free from trouble, but the difficulties
      would begin after he entered that land. He would have to cross that
      perilous region before he reached another human shelter where he could
      restock his provisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the Ares Martial Hall&#8217;s predictions, should nothing too
      awry present itself, it would take Han Sen a month to cross the Black
      Desert. If troubles did arise, no one knew whether or not he would emerge
      from that place ever again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing advised Han Sen not to go, saying that his mother was in
      a big human shelter and that there was no danger there. Even if Han Sen
      wanted to give her something, he could have sent it via delivery. He
      didn&#8217;t have to go in person.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen knew that what he wanted to give his mother was not something
      he could easily trade; that was why he wanted to go there and visit her
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry; I have a super pet. I will be fine.&#8221; Han
      Sen smiled at Huangfu Pingqing while talking with her on the communicator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing merely sighed in response and said, &#8220;Do not
      underestimate that place. Our people have only traveled there once. A team
      comprised of one hundred people were sent in, yet only two made it out
      half-alive. Those who made it out weren&#8217;t even sure how they did
      so.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Their account detailed an encounter with a black dragon in the
      Black Desert. But another monster swallowed the black dragon up, and it
      looked like a phoenix. They spoke of mountains that moved, pits in the
      sands that consumed creatures, and worse. That place is far too dangerous
      for anyone to venture alone.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How can dragons and phoenix exist in this world? This is not
      mythology; they are merely creatures. These beasts you speak of are most
      likely super creatures, at worst. And it&#8217;s not like I haven&#8217;t
      killed a super creature before.&#8221; Han Sen smiled again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know my attempts at swaying your resolve to go there are futile,
      but still, I would like you to think about it and perhaps
      reconsider,&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Senior, when I make it to the other side, await my report.
      I&#8217;ll make sure to contact you and let you know of my success in
      making it through.&#8221; Again, Han Sen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, if you&#8217;re that determined, how about you transport some
      beast souls on my behalf?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing asked, with a wry smile.
    </p>

    <p>…&#8230;</p>

    <p>
      After his preparations were complete, Han Sen brought along the silver fox
      and left the Goddess Shelter. He traveled in the direction of the
      Devil&#8217;s Mountain, and once over, he planned to veer away and head
      towards the Black Desert.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after arriving at the trail leading up and over the Devil&#8217;s
      Mountain, he frowned. Immediately, he did not feel safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have walked this trail many times; there shouldn&#8217;t be a
      threat. And I&#8217;m not Wang Yuhang, so I can&#8217;t be unlucky enough
      to have misfortune befall me.&#8221; Despite Han Sen thinking this, he
      opened up his Dongxuan Sutra to scan the surrounding environment for life
      forces. He wanted to see if there were any powerful creatures in the
      vicinity.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next second, Han Sen&#8217;s face changed. He sensed the presence
      of many powerful creatures, all about. He could sense the force of these
      creatures, but he could not tell what they were.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, just sensing such life forces was enough to make Han Sen almost
      panic. The energies he sensed were greater than sacred-blood creatures,
      but not quite in the realm of super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was more than surprised, because he had never sensed something
      like this before. Each of the energy life forces were different, but when
      he looked deeper, the forces seemed comparable to his own strength. The
      fitness of whatever awaited him had to be at least two hundred.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was a strange number; sacred-blood creatures don&#8217;t reach
      such levels, and super creatures were never so low. Even the silver fox
      had a stronger energy reading.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were more than twenty of these life forces, as well. Things were
      taking a strange turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Han Sen continued to scan his vicinity, and he
      noticed that the presences were approaching him quickly. Then, he saw some
      people appear before him from a nearby forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen saw these people emerge, he could not help but shout,
      &#8220;Shura! How is this possible?!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw that each person had a horn protruding from their head: the
      sign of a male Shura.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Shura were unable to exist in this place, as they could not use beast
      souls. But as clear as day, Han Sen could see them clad in beast soul
      armor, wielding beast soul weaponry.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this? What&#8217;s going on? Why are there Shura here, in
      the shelter? Did the Shura figure out how to survive here in this
      world?&#8221; Han Sen was shocked. If what he was seeing was true, then
      humanity was assuredly doomed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quickly, however, Han Sen realized something was wrong. Although they had
      horns, similar to the Shura, their colors were off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The horns of a Shura could be black, white, gold and purple—there were no
      red horns—which was what he was seeing now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet, the horns of those he was observing now were clearly not decorations,
      or some strange accessory or apparatus; they protruded from the bones of
      their skulls just like the ones belonging to the Shura did.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they were humans, they must have consumed super geno points. Otherwise,
      their energy would not be as strong as it was. They were much stronger
      than humans.
    </p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>
      One of the blood-horned Shura&#8217;s let loose an arrow from a beast soul
      bow. The arrow flew directly towards Han Sen with frightening power. It
      cracked the air in two and approach him quickly.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The adiraid appeared in front of Han Sen and broke the beast soul arrow.
      But this did not appease or make Han Sen any happier; if anything, it made
      him look glummer than ever. The power of the arrow was almost as strong as
      what Han Sen himself could achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are you people?!&#8221; Han Sen called out, eager to know
      whether or not they were Shura.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We are the ones who have come to kill you,&#8221; the man who fired
      an arrow coldly responded. He gestured with his hand, and he and his
      twenty-two blood-horned compatriots charged towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other side of the peak, Zhao Lian was holding up a pair of
      binoculars. He was watching every little move with keen interest, and he
      recorded the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;First stage: Angel Gene Fluid versus a super pet. Let&#8217;s see
      what happens.&#8221; Zhao Lian looked excited, and he was eager to find
      out what was going to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Zhao Lian knew that these evolvers, despite having a fitness level of
      over one hundred and having consumed the Angel Gene Fluid, would still not
      have what it took to take down a super creature. Their primary target was
      Han Sen, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      But no matter how strong the super pet was, there was only one of it. It
      would not be able to protect Han Sen when he was surrounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is a shame, though. It is a shame that I must sacrifice Zhao
      Long and all his people on the account of cutting down that Han Sen. We
      should have loosed these warriors against a super creature.&#8221; Zhao
      Lian felt sorry because the beast soul would disappear into The Empty upon
      Han Sen&#8217;s death, and Zhao Long would not be able to test his mettle
      against the super pet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people who had consumed the Angel Gene Fluid were dead men walking,
      too. They could serve no purpose in the future.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The adiraid swung her sword as Zhao Long and his people approached with
      firm haste. In a formation, they looked set to deal with the attack. The
      adiraid was a really powerful, oppressive force, but killing them in a
      short amount of time would be difficult.
    </p>

    <p>Eight of the people with blood-horns surrounded Han Sen.</p>
