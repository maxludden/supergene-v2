<h2>Moon God Festival</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1859</h3>

<p>Han Sen held an orb that was around the same size as a man’s
fist. It shone like a miniature sun. If you looked at it closely,
you could see there was something gold swimming inside it.</p>
<div class="tables">
<table class="beast">

<!-- Deified Beast Soul: Sun Raven (Gem Type) --></div>
<p>As he fiddled with the orb, he considered it.</p>
<p>Han Sen had obtained a few gem type beast souls in the past. Not
many of them existed, as they were quite rare. But they could be
used to bring other beast souls up to the same level as the gem
beast soul.</p>
<p>This was a deified gem type beast soul, and that meant all Han
Sen would have to do was find another beast soul of a compatible
element. If he did, he could bring it up to a deified class.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a few different beast souls, but nothing like a
firebird beast soul. That meant he could not use the deified gem
type beast soul at this point in time. Han Sen returned it to his
Sea of Soul, and then he looked at the ledger for the base.</p>
<p>The base’s shortage of manpower kept them from producing much,
but something very nice did happen soon after the crisis was
averted. A young woman with ordinary geno armor had a second
evolution. She became a Baron.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng guessed it might have had something to do with the
gold raven mark. Perhaps the energy that melted into their bodies
was what prompted the second evolution.</p>
<p>The geno armament she received was a fire type.</p>
<p>“If the gold raven mark can make people evolve, does that mean
all these women and kids could end up becoming xenogeneics or
Nobles?” As Han Sen mulled that thought over, he realized he was
quite happy about it.</p>
<p>Any Nobles he developed could become Han Sen’s loyal army, and
he could be more confident about using them.</p>
<p>Of course, it still depended on when they could all become
Nobles.</p>
<p>Only Black Steel and Captain Wood knew of the events that
occurred in the Raven palace. It had been many days since then, and
yet word had not gotten out. The news had been suppressed by all
survivors, it seemed.</p>
<p>It did not matter much, anyway, even if word was to get out.</p>
<p>There were fewer Nobles in the base right now, at least, and
that made things easier for him to manage. This also provided Han
Sen with more time to practice and hunt xenogeneics. Even so, he
was still unable to level up and become a Viscount.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, how are your skills coming along?” When Yisha finished
practicing, she finally called up Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Things are going swimmingly,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>Yisha, upon hearing Han Sen say that, smiled. Icebird was behind
her, but she hadn’t said a word.</p>
<p>Because Yisha had told her to review Han Sen’s current
situation, she knew he had lost many Barons and Viscounts. He
always hunted alone, and he didn’t focus on his practice.</p>
<p>“Good. The is coming. All the elites and their heirs will be
going. You should think about joining us. There’ll be a test,”
Yisha said coldly.</p>
<p>“?” Han Sen looked at Yisha with a modicum of confusion.</p>
<p>Yisha signaled for Icebird to step forward and explain. “The
happens every forty-nine years. Only the Rebate who are born within
those forty-nine years are able to join. Because there are many
outsiders within the Rebate society, especially over the past few
centuries, they are also allowed to join. That is, if they are able
to qualify.”</p>
<p>Icebird explained it to Han Sen, so he’d know a bit more about
it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t random that it happened every forty-nine years. Every
forty-nine years, on the main eleven planets, a moon altar would
appear. Creatures that were born within those forty-nine years
could enter the altar to Moon Palace.</p>
<p>The Moon Palace was in the center of Narrow-Moon, but it was
different from the Gold Raven Hall. There was no sun. There were
just the planets and Moon God Palace. It was usually cold, and
hidden in the dark. Not even deified elites could sneak in.</p>
<p>During this time, the planet would appear, and the Moon God
Palace would open up. Anyone who could make it past the altar and
reach the palace would be blessed by the Moon God. This was a big
thing for the Rebate, and the event would even be livestreamed. The
first person to be blessed would receive a big reward from the
Rebate.</p>
<p>No one knew what the reward would be, though; it was something
that was decided by the elder, and the elder hadn’t announced what
the reward was going to be yet.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was more interested in the blessing than the
physical reward. The Moon God might have been present, but there
were no statues or creatures around the palace. The creatures that
entered Moon God Palace looked awfully cold. The blessing was to be
bathed in moonlight, it was said, and no actual god showed
itself.</p>
<p>There was no advantage to going to Moon God Palace early. Once
the palace opened, you could be blessed at any point until the
palace closed again. The amount of blessing you’d receive was
random, and didn’t depend on timing either.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the last person to go would receive the most
blessings. Sometimes the earlier arrivals would receive the
greatest blessing. There didn’t appear to be a reliable rule for
how the blessings were distributed.</p>
<p>After many blessings, it was deduced that the strength of the
blessing depended on the person.</p>
<p>Normally, the actual Rebate received the strongest blessings.
Outsiders rarely ever had a chance to join in, and there was a
fairly obvious bias.</p>
<p>Yisha let Han Sen go, but Han Sen didn’t think he’d receive much
of a blessing. She just wanted him to witness the new elites that
showed up every forty-nine years. In the festival, showing off your
power was far more important than earning first place. Aside from
receiving a bonus from the elders, you’d receive nothing
special.</p>
<p>Most Rebate and xenogeneics just wanted to use the festival to
gain fame. Han Sen was Queen’s only student, and he would
definitely be challenged. That was why she mentioned there would be
a test for him.</p>
<p>Forty-nine years was not a short amount of time, and there were
a few Viscounts that had joined. An Earl had taken part, as well.
Ordinarily, they wouldn’t kill anyone. But even so, Han Sen was a
Baron, and it was difficult to say if he’d pull through.</p>
<p>After they ended the call, Icebird said, “What if too many
people realize that you are letting him join? You taking him as a
student has soured many of the younger ones. I am afraid they will
try to teach him a lesson.”</p>
<p>“It is good for the young ones to suffer failure.” Yisha
smiled.</p>
