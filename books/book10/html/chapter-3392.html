<h3>Chapter 3392</h3>

<p>Han Sen stepped into the area. His eyes looked surprised. His
body did react. His stone-looking body felt power from the outside.
Time was like a wave of water outside of him. Han Sen felt the flow
and float of the river of time on his skin.</p>
<p>Although his body was not moved by the reversal of time, it
still shocked Han Sen. He looked at the crazy, spinning needle and
thought, “Is the reversal of this spinning time too fast? Is that
why my body has actually prompted some sort of reaction? Is it just
this clock itself that is weird?”</p>
<p>Discovering the answer to that questions was not going to be
difficult for Han Sen. He stepped toward the spinning needle.</p>
<p>As he moved, something surprised Han Sen. It thrilled him with
sheer delight. When he walked to the needle, the speed of the
needle increased. It was going faster than it was before.</p>
<p>“Something is wrong. Something is wrong with this stone clock.
The needle’s speed on an ordinary stone clock is connected to Time
Sky. The speed cannot be changed through ordinary means. If the
speed was changed, the whole of the Time Sky would be affected. The
stone clocks would be changed too unless my luck really did come.”
Han Sen’s eyes looked as if they were on fire as he stared at the
needle. He stopped all hesitation and went to the needle.</p>
<p>The closer Han Sen got to the needle, the faster the stone clock
spun. The impact of the river of time was stronger. The reverse
time power almost turned something he could actually see.</p>
<p>When Han Sen went to the needle, it was like he was a boat
sailing out across a stormy sea. It was like he was trying to drive
it up a waterfall. Every step he took, his body felt an absurd
amount of pressure fall on him.</p>
<p>Since his Super God Spirit mode had evolved, this was the first
time Han Sen’s body had been able to feel pressure of some
kind.</p>
<p>“This body does not deny the ability to feel power. It is just
because all opposing powers thus far have been too weak for me to
feel.” Han Sen stepped forward. The time power was able to give him
quite a bit of pressure, but that was all that it was. The power
was not enough to move Han Sen’s body. Most importantly, it didn’t
come anywhere near the realm that would see his body devolve.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked in front of the needle. He reached his hand out
to grab the stone needle that was madly spinning. The moment his
hand stopped the needle, the needle had a surge of power that made
it spin even crazier. It made Han Sen’s body spin half a cycle with
it. Ultimately, the needle’s movement was brought to a standstill
by Han Sen. It shook, but it could no longer spin.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>The stone needle was not like any other needle. Han Sen did not
stop it. Instead, it exploded with power. Han Sen’s power was
uncontrollably pushed away. His feet touched the stone ground,
creating a deep trench in it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body used power. His hands pushed the stone edge of
the uncompliant needle. The stone needle’s force was made
still.</p>
<p>The needle continued to quiver as if it was still trying to
fight back. When Han Sen held the needle and tried to suppress it,
no matter how much the needle tried to move, he could not do
anything.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen heard a cracking noise. The stone needle
cracked. It made a butterfly-like crack. It spun so fast that it
seemed to be too powerful. It was like the needle was going to
break.</p>
<p>Quickly, the 90-foot-long stone needle had developed cracks
along its entire structure. The needle continued to apply more
power until it shattered to bits.</p>
<p>Amidst the cracked stone was a crystal light. It was like sword
light slashing toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out for the crystal light and stopped it. His
body was pushed back the crystal light. His legs formed two deep
trenches in the ground. He was unable to stop its force, so he drew
a circle in the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen was now able to see that this was not a sword light. It
was a needle made of crystal. It looked rather pretty, and its
crystal shape was shining. It looked like an extraordinary lance
built from the finest, most gracious materials. Either that, or it
looked like a weird, crystal-like sword that was very big.</p>
<p>The crystal needle had been in the stone needle all that time.
It only revealed itself when the stone shell around it broke.</p>
<p>“That must be correct. This must be the sky clock.” Han Sen was
very happy. His body kept using power, and the crystal needle’s
power kept fighting against him. The crystal needle’s spinning
speed finally started to slow and cease.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>More cracking sounds were coming from beneath Han Sen’s feet.
Many giant cracks were spreading across the face of the stone
clock. A crystal light was atop that clock.</p>
<p>On the stone clock that was cracking and flaking away, Han Sen
immediately saw the presence of what appeared to be a crystal
clock. Because the needle power kept fighting Han Sen, the powerful
power cracked the stone clock shell on the outside to reveal its
true self.</p>
<p>Quickly, the stone clock was cracked. It revealed the presence
of a big, crystal clock. Han Sen was standing atop the crystal
clock, holding the needle. The needle kept shaking, but it could
not move.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, Han Sen had triggered a big fight. Now, most
of the creatures in the realm had been drawn there. He suspected
his discovery of the sky clock would have started a big fight and
brought creatures his way. By keeping them occupied elsewhere, it
meant he was free for now.</p>
<p>“How do I claim the sky clock?” Han Sen held the needle as he
fought against the sky clock. Although he could keep it under
control, the sky clock had no intention of submitting and obeying
him. It still tried to fight and go against Han Sen’s will for it
to submit and adhere.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking about how he might gain control of
the sky clock, he felt as if someone had just arrived. He turned
around and saw Ancient Devil approaching. His heart jumped.</p>
<p>“Why did Ancient Devil not show up any other time? Why is he
only showing up now? Has this guy been following me the entire
time?” Han Sen’s mind flashed with many different ideas about
Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil walked close to the sky clock and smiled at the
big, crystal clock as he said, “Your luck really isn’t all that
bad. It looks like you have managed to find the sky clock.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at Ancient Devil and asked, “Ancient Devil, have
you been following me?”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil laughed. “You used to follow me! I thought it
would be OK if we switched for once. That being said, I did not
expect you would end up lucky enough to find the sky clock in a
relatively short amount of time. You surpassed my
expectations.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I found it, and that which belongs to me cannot be stolen
by others,” Han Sen said with a squint of his eyes.</p>
<p>“You have not managed to conquer it yet, so it is not yours.”
Ancient Devil’s face did not change. He walked over to the sky
clock.</p>
