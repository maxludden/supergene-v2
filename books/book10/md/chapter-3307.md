  The four-taloned, evil bird’s face twisted grotesquely. Afterward, its body instantly exploded. It turned into a bloody mist that went everywhere.

Moment God did not stop. Time all around her crawled to a standstill. She stepped out from the other side of the system. Another Break World creature was destroying things there.

The Break World beast was killed by Moment God in the same manner, prompting legions of people to pray to Moment God. Weird power flowed through them all from the air. The powers eventually drifted in the direction of Moment God Temple. It made Moment God Temple brighter. Moment God’s body grew brighter and brighter.

It was not just Moment God Temple that lit up. Many god temples in the geno hall glowed with a shocking sky god light. All the god powers from all the god temples exploded.

Blergh!

Lin Feng’s mouth spewed blood. Even so, his body was not reeling back. He blocked the four-winged white tiger’s claw light.

The gold light that protected his body was perforated. His chest was torn through, leaving three bloody scrapes behind. The marks were so deep that his organs were visible.

Behind Lin Feng, Little Angel’s body was on the ground. Blood was everywhere as she stood back up. The tip of the white crystal greatsword she held in one of her hands had been cut off.

The star tyrannosaurus rex madly approached. Lin Feng was unable to fight it. Little Angel was wounded, but she rose her broken sword and tried slashing the scary star tyrannosaurus rex

“Roar!” A mad roar shook the ground. The shadow of a gold beast flew to the scene. It struck the star tyrannosaurus rex and its light.

Boom!

The ground quaked. The ultimate light and gold light shadow fell back. The gold light shadow was Golden Growler.

It fought against the star tyrannosaurus rex. Golden Growler’s forehead was already bleeding gold blood, but its body’s gold light shone. It madly roared. A big gold door came out from its mouth.

The star tyrannosaurus rex seemed to realize that it had encountered a worthy adversary. It stared at Golden Growler and the gold door he was vomiting. It was roaring at the golden door, wanting to test it out.

The sound hit the golden door, but the golden door did nothing. It slowly opened via its own volition. It had a line of gold light.

On the other side, Gu Qingcheng and Huangfu Jing stopped following the white tiger. Huangfu Jing used her time and space powers to teleport. The four-winged white tiger was strong, but it was unable to hurt her.

Gu Qingcheng’s sword was like a shocking flood. An overbearing sword air was blown into the sky, but it only managed to stop a few of the four-winged white tiger’s attacks.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The ground was shaking. The forests were shaking. A steel tree at the end of the forest, which was as tall as a tower, was coming. It was a plant Break World beast. It was headed for the human city in Space Garden.

“Let me handle this.” Huangfu Jing’s eyes looked like they were on fire.

“Sure.” Gu Qingcheng followed the sword movements. A sword light broke space and went to the scary steel tree.

The people and spirits that could go there were elites who had endured countless life-and-death moments. Even though the situation was dire, no one was actually losing all of their hope that these trials could be overcome. No one prayed for the aid of a God Spirit, and no God Spirit went to Space Garden. Only the elites of Space Garden held strong to battle the Break World beasts with their own volition.

In the Tianxia System, Wang Yuhang rode his bike and broke space. He was going to Outer Sky to see what happened to Littleflower.

Suddenly, a black hole formed in the sky. A life soul, which looked like a sky demon spirit and was wearing a crown, appeared and headed straight for Wang Yuhang.

“What is this?” Wang Yuhang saw the life soul and threw a punch at it.

His power was unable to touch the life soul. The life soul was like a ghost that went through his fist. It went into his body.

Wang Yuhang’s head massively ached. He was thrust into agony. He clutched his head and screamed as his body blazed with transparent fire.

There were lots of fights going on in Outer Sky as well. The fights were worse than the fights in Space Garden. Outer Sky had many more strong elites than Space Garden did, so many life souls went there. One out of four life souls went to that realm.

The base was broken. The Very High were fighting. Littleflower entered his king spirit body. He used his holy body power to trap a few Break World beasts, but he could not spend time doing anything else.

“Help!” Ning Yue kept running while screaming. He had tears running out of the corners of his eyes.

A Break World beast with nine heads was chasing Ning Yue and Sheep.

As he was running, Sheep screamed, “Boss! Do not chase me! I am so skinny and chewy! I do not taste good! You should go and chase that person who does not look like a man or a woman! He tastes the best!”

With Sheep’s power, he would not have made it to the geno universe. Sheep had been holding the legs of the Han family for a long time. By remaining faithful, he had procured many benefits. He made it out of the sanctuaries and remained close with the Han family in the Alliance. He had only just arrived in the geno universe.

Only a few days later after arriving, he was witnessing this most recent disaster. It made Sheep so depressed that he wanted to start coughing up blood.

Ning Yue heard Sheep’s declaration for favoring the Break World beast eating him instead. It made him shocked and scared. He cried and yelled, “If you want to eat, eat Sheep! He tastes the best! He is very fat and soft!”

“You horrible person,” Sheep angrily said. “How do you know I am fat and soft? I bet you always wanted to eat me!”

“Shut the hell up!” the nine-headed beast shouted with annoyance. He punched the ground. The explosive power broke the ground. The ground collapsed. Sheep and Ning Yue feel deep into the hole that formed.

“I really hate guys like this who are annoying people that cry and moan constantly.” It seemed that the nine-headed monster was very manly. He lifted a fist and threw a punch at the deep hole.

His fist was bigger than a room. The fist’s shadow covered both Sheep and Ning Yue.

“Boss… Help me… Actually, I am a son of yours who you lost many years ago.” Sheep was so scared, he climbed up and tried to obey his villain.

“No, I do not have a pussy son like you.” The giant fist of the nine-headed monster continued its damning descend downward.

Boom!

The rocks around them fell as the ground was punctured. The impact left a deep hole. Sheep was holding his legs. As he laid on the floor with his eyes closed, he screamed, “I am going to die… I am going to die…”

Soon after, he noticed that the nine-headed monster’s giant fist did not actually land on him. It was still two inches away, but it had not come down.

Not far away from him, Ning Yue was kneeling on the floor. He was holding the ground. One hand was holding a little green sword. The little sword and Ning Yue were glowing with a green flame. It blocked the nine-headed beast’s fist.

Ning Yue lowered his head and coldly asked, “Who did you call a pussy?”
