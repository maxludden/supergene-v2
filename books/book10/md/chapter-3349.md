  In front of an intelligent elite like Ancient Devil, Han Sen was not planning to lie, even if he did not know how to lie.

Plus, saying something honest would have made Ancient Devil suspicious.

If Ancient Devil was there for something, and if Han Sen was there, Ancient Devil might not believe he was there by accident. Ancient Devil would definitely be suspicious.

“I am here by accident too.” Ancient Devil looked to be devoid of emotion when he said that.

Han Sen did not see anything strange in Ancient Devil’s face. He knew it would be hard to glean any information from him, so he asked, “Last time, regarding the geno tablet, do you not think you owe me an explanation?”

Ancient Devil laughed. “What explanation? I did not lie to you about a single thing. Everything I told you was the absolute truth. Therefore, what can you possibly expect me to explain to you?”

“It looks like you think you are in Dust Sky. My power is restricted, so I cannot do anything to you.” Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil as he spoke.

Ancient Devil did not hide anything. He nodded and said, “There is a way. Dust Sky has restricted my power and Break World rate is not very high. But in Dust Sky, you cannot beat me easily.”

“Oh, really?” Han Sen did not believe Ancient Devil. He looked at Ancient Devil.

Ancient Devil waved his hands. “Do not even think about trying to fight me. Now, we are all in Dust Sky together. If I am found by Bury Path God, you and I are both going down. After all, the enemy of my enemy is a friend. Why should we kill each other?”

“That depends on whether or not you are willing to be my friend,” Han Sen said. He took a step toward Ancient Devil.

His body was not as powerful as usual, but his will and mind were still there. With Under the Sky will and his power, every step he took was like a chess game. It made Ancient Devil feel a lot of pressure.

Ancient Devil’s face changed. He still understood Han Sen. He knew if that guy wanted to do something, he would go through the fire and flames to get it. He would not be tricked by mere language play. Unless he was able to bring out something solid, he would probably have to end up fighting Han Sen.

Seeing Han Sen come before him, Ancient Devil made a very deep smile and asked, “Do you want to know Bury Path God’s secret? It is a secret that pertains to Dust Sky as well.”

This was what Han Sen wanted to hear. It made Han Sen stop breathing and walking.

“Tell me.” Han Sen stood still. He coldly looked at Ancient Devil. His power had not been reduced. He still looked at Ancient Devil.

Ancient Devil paused and said, “It is actually like Sky King. Bury Path God bred the creatures in the 33 skies. When Bury Path God was born, Sky King was already the first spirit in the 33 skies. He was born in Dust Sky.”

“Keep going.” Han Sen was interested in this. He thought, “Of course. Ancient Devil did not come here by accident.”

Ancient Devil made it sound nice. He went on to say, “Sky King is the son of the 33 skies, but he is not the biggest spirit in the 33 skies. The real spirit of the 33 skies is Dust Sky’s Bury Path God. Of the 33 skies, Dust Sky is very unique.”

“What kind of situation are we talking about here?” Han Sen asked.

“According to Mister Leader’s plan with the 33 skies, Dust Sky is a grave for the 33 skies,” Ancient Devil said. “It is for burying the spirits that are unable to be reincarnated.”

“What does that mean?” Han Sen asked. “What do you mean by them not being able to be reincarnated? I thought every spirit could reincarnate after their death.”

“Yes, according to the theory,” Ancient Devil replied. “Some spirits are so strong that when their bodies perish, their souls do not die completely. Struggles will have left their marks on it. If such a spirit entered the cycle of reincarnation, they would be a glitch in the rules of the world. For a leader, it does not matter if it is the geno hall or the God Chaos Party, no one wants that to happen. So, we need a place to sort out these weird spirits. Ergo, that’s what we have here. We have Dust Sky.”

“And then?” Han Sen let Ancient Devil keep talking.

Ancient Devil became a bit more serious as he said, “When Mister Leader built the 33 skies, it led to Dust Sky having a spirit, which was Bury Path God. He became the vice president of the God Chaos Party. There was then Sky King, Dragon King, Asura, and others in the 33 skies.”

Han Sen did not say a word. More than anything, he looked annoyed. Ancient Devil had said a lot so far, but he hadn’t actually gotten to the main point.

When Ancient Devil saw Han Sen’s face, he looked uncaring. He went on to say, “If I have guessed things correctly when the universe rebooted, Mister Leader buried himself here.”

“Are you saying the body of God Chaos Party’s true leader is buried in this place?” Han Sen was shocked. He could not find the gall to believe Ancient Devil’s bold claim.

Ancient Devil nodded. “That is merely what I have guessed. I haven’t thought of it for long, but Bury Path God became the leader of Dust Sky. I do not want him to find me. So, I am searching quietly.”

“Please don’t tell me you have no solid leads.” After making the effort to get there, Han Sen did not believe Ancient Devil would go home with nothing.

“Well, funnily enough, I do have some leads. There is a place not too far from here that looks like the area I am looking for, but I have been unable to confirm anything just yet.” Ancient Devil spoke quietly.

“Is the place around here?” Han Sen asked.

If the leader of the God Chaos Party was there, that would be the real treasure. No one knew what the old leader might have been carrying.

“On that planet, but I do not know where,” Ancient Devil said.

“How do you know it is on that planet?” Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil with a look of zero trust.

“When Bury Path God became the leader, he always occupied that place,” Ancient Devil seriously said. “From what I was able to observe, this planet is nothing special.”

Han Sen understood what he meant. That planet was very normal, yet Bury Path God always went there. That had to prove there was something not entirely normal about the place.

“If you are interested, we can co-operate and find the old leader’s corpse,” Ancient Devil said. “Otherwise, you and I might be here for a very long time waiting for Bury Path God to return from the geno tablet. If that happens, we will only end up dead anyway.”

“Fine. I will work with you again.” Han Sen nodded. On the inside, he thought, “If this place is the resting place of the God Chaos Party’s old leader, that means big sky demon might be around. She seems to know more than Ancient Devil. Perhaps he can contact her.”
