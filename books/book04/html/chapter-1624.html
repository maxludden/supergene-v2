<p>Originally, humans weren’t very interested in the Divinity’s Bout in the Fourth Sanctuary. At most, they would watch a Divinity’s Bout to see the most powerful creatures and spirits.</p>

<p>However, when Dollar appeared on the list of competitors, lots of human demigods were interested.</p>

<p>“Dollar is joining now! I’ll have to watch that fight.”</p>

<p>“Dollar!” Son of Heaven’s eyes were gleaming, but he was very upset.</p>

<p>“I heard that Dollar is able to kill terrifying beings like the Destroyer Wolf. Perhaps he will even be able to top the list.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will be that easy. Dollar is definitely powerful, but he still can’t compare with the beings who’ve lived in the Fourth Sanctuary for countless millennia. The gap between their experience levels is too large.”</p>

<p>“What’s to worry about? Dollar is Dollar. I believe he can pull off a miracle.”</p>

<p>When Han Sen got back to the Alliance, Tang Zhenliu dragged him into a holographic meeting room.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw that Tang Zhenliu, Wang Yuhang, Huang Fujing, Lin Feng, and Jing Jiwu were all there.</p>

<p>“Han Sen, do you think this Dollar who’s joining the match is the Dollar who killed Destroyer Wolf?” Tang Zhenliu asked after Han Sen entered the meeting room.</p>

<p>“I’d say so. I haven’t heard of anyone else using that name.” Han Sen shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“If it’s really that Dollar, do you think he can actually beat Six Paths?” asked Tang Zhenliu again.</p>

<p>“How should I know?” Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he can win. I’ve seen Six Paths fighting before, and he’s really powerful. In the Divinity’s Bout a hundred years ago, Six Paths almost took first place, but he lost to the then-champion for half a strike. That spirit is too powerful. I don’t think Dollar can win,” said Wang Yuhang.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. That Six Paths is certainly powerful, but Dollar is also exceptional. Besides, we humans actually evolve much more quickly than creatures and spirits. If Dollar has enough resources, and if he reaches super level, it’s likely that he can defeat Six Paths,” Jing Jiwu said, disagreeing with Wang Yuhang.</p>

<p>Han Sen had thought that they had something important to tell him, but they just wanted to gossip about the upcoming fight. It seemed that the impending fight between him and Six Paths had attracted a lot of attention.</p>

<p>“Old Han, who do you think will win?” After talking about it for a while, Tang Zhenliu turned around and asked Han Sen.</p>

<p>Of course, I think Dollar will win. After all, he’s a human like us, so I want him to win,” said Han Sen.</p>

<p>When it was meal time, Han Sen left the holographic room. Han Yan and his mother were both there, and Ji Yanran’s parents were also there.</p>

<p>The dinner conversation turned to Divinity’s Bout, and they couldn’t help bringing up the fight between Dollar and Six Paths.</p>

<p>“Dollar is definitely the most powerful person within the human race. If he can actually defeat Six Paths, it’ll be a good thing for all humans. It’ll be a huge motivation for everyone,” said Ji Ruozhen.</p>

<p>“Dollar is indeed impressive, but I think my brother is stronger than him. Are you going to join Divinity’s Bout, brother? Why didn’t I see your name?” Han Yan asked, looking at Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen shook his head and said, “My self geno core hasn’t reached super level yet, and I have something important to do right now. I didn’t sign up for Divinity’s Bout.”</p>

<p>Ji Ruozhen nodded his head and said, “You’re right. You should be careful when it comes to Divinity’s Bout. You’re indeed powerful now, but relying on external power too much is not a good thing. You should improve your power as much as possible first…”</p>

<p>The humans hadn’t even cared about Divinity’s Bout originally, but their interest had been piqued by Dollar’s entrance. Lots of media were going to be reporting the fight between Dollar and Six Paths.</p>

<p>This had never happened, even after the news of the Third and the Fourth Sanctuaries were revealed.</p>

<p>Dollar was too famous in the Alliance. Normal people were not that interested in Divinity’s Bout in the Fourth Shelter, but they were still very interested in news about Dollar.</p>

<p>Han Sen entered the martial hall to observe the fights on the second day after he went back to the Sanctuary. There were still two days before the fight between him and Six Paths. Han Sen arrived before the Divinity’s Bout because he wanted to observe the power of the other competitors.</p>

<p>Just as Han Sen expected, he saw many powerful beings joining the Divinity’s Bout on the first day. There were too many powerful beings in the Fourth Sanctuary, and they obviously stood out among the sacred-blood creatures and king spirits.</p>

<p>However, the battle that attracted Han Sen the most was the fight of Xu Mi’s mother, Fire Empress.</p>

<p>When Han Sen saw Fire Empress, he took a look at her competitor, and noticed that the name listed was Jade Shura.</p>

<p>Han Sen originally thought that it was just a coincidence, but when Fire Empress’s adversary walked on the stage, Han Sen was surprised.</p>

<p>The contestant was wearing a jade mask, and it was as smooth as an eggshell. The surface was unbroken, without a mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>

<p>Though he couldn’t see the person’s face, the lifeforce coming from her and her pair of purple horns meant that she was definitely a royal shura.</p>

<p>“Can the shura also join the Divinity’s Bout?” Han Sen was very surprised.</p>

<p>What was more surprising was that he wasn’t sure whether this Jade Shura was actually the Jade Shura. Only the Empress of the Shura could use the name “Jade Shura,” so if she really was the Empress, it would be very interesting.</p>

<p>Han Sen followed the fight very closely. Fire Empress had never met a shura before, so she treated Jade Shura as an ordinary creature. She waved her hands, and a wave of fire that looked like a dragon tried to swallow Jade Shura.</p>

<p>Jade Shura saw the fire dragon, but she didn’t seem impressed by it She let the fire dragon swallow her, but after the fire dragon withered away, Jade Shura was still standing there, unharmed.</p>

<p>Fire Empress was kind of intimidated and infuriated. She lifted her arms, and a fire gem floated into her hands.</p>

<p>The fire gem was like a sun burning everything around it. It flew toward Jade Shura. That fire was so terrifying that even people who were watching from their own martial halls leaned away from it.</p>

<p>Jade Shura finally started to move. She raised her jade hand to her chest, and she waved her hand toward that fire gem like a knife. The invisible power slashed forward like a blade, and in the next second, the fire gem was falling apart in two pieces.</p>

<p>Everyone was stunned into silence, and many people couldn’t help standing up.</p>

<p>“Falsified Sky power!” Someone couldn’t help screaming.</p>
