“We have to give it a shot, no matter what. We cannot willingly let ourselves die here!” Wang Yuhang said, then jumped into the godlight area.

When his legs and his head touched the godlight, it was like he had struck a plank of raw steel. He bounced off with a pang, and it was fortunate he was wearing Han Sen’s Marquise armor. Had he not, that would have hurt.

“Damn! Is that light or a wall of steel?” Wang Yuhang looked at the golden light.

“Why else do you think the Kings tried to run?” Guya looked at him with disdain.

Han Sen touched the golden light, and it was like stone. It was so smooth, he couldn’t even find a seam or crevice. So, Han Sen tried to use his Ghost Teeth Knife to slice golden light. Sparks flew from the blade, but he could not break through the light.

“It’s so hard!” Han Sen was shocked. They could not penetrate the wall, so it spoke volumes about the Kings who had been able to move through the light. But even so, despite their massive strength, they were unable to get close to the statue.

Wang Yuhang and Han Sen were both unable to enter the godlight, but the six Kings soon noticed them, even as they tried hitting the statue.

They looked around them and were shocked. They did not expect another big bunch of people to still be alive. On top of that, Han Sen’s group only had average power.

Aside from Icebird Duke, the others were all decidedly weak.

When they saw Guna and Guya, however, they were even more shocked. And adding to that, they then looked happy.

The giant King, still clad in armor, walked before Han Sen. He grabbed Guya and Guna in his hands and took them over to the statue.

There was a long pause. Han Sen saw this happen, but he did not move, and the giant had already taken them and brought them before the statue.

“What does he want to do?” Wang Yuhang asked.

Icebird Duke coldly said, “They cannot break the godlight. They want to use Guna and Guya’s blood to hopefully achieve a connection with Purgatory Heaven. It might enable them to reach the tear.”

Han Sen could not say anything. After they were taken, their protective light went with them. The arms started to rise like mad. But Han Sen’s people could not enter the godlight, so he kept on swinging his Knife Blank to cut down the arms.

“Buddha King, you are the best at this. I will let you handle it. Our survival solely depends on you,” the Giant said, right before handing over Guna and Guya to the monk-like King.

“Who will go to hell if I don’t?” The King recited the line of an ancient buddha, and then he raised his hand and became a buddha himself. In a shroud of white light, he came before Guya and Guna.

“The geno universe has monks, huh?” Han Sen was shocked, as he had thought that monks were a human thing.

They are not monks, they are the Buddha! They are one of the higher races,” Icebird Duke said.

“Buddha?” Han Sen and Wang Yuhang came from the Alliance. Their faces looked strange.

The buddha’s head was as smooth as a lightbulb, without a single hair, as if he had been born bald. The dots across his head were nine naturally-born moles. Guna and Guya’s faces turned pale. It looked as if they wanted to struggle and get free. But beneath the Buddha Light of the Buddha King, they could not even flicker their eyelids.

Buddha King moved his finger, and then a Buddha Light landed between her eyebrows. Blood began to seep out of her brow.

It was more than a mere dribble, as well. Suddenly, it became a long streak of blood that floated away from her head. Its target became clear, as it began to drift towards the statue.

The blood began to suffuse into the golden light. Gold Jade King and the others started to gather up power, ready to strike the blood.

As the Kings prepared a frightening attack, the blood-tainted light started to crack. Blood began to fill the cracks like a blooming flower.

The Kings were happy with this result, and the giant shouted, “Buddha King! Take the essence of the other Gana, so we can escape with greater haste! The longer we are here, the more danger we are in.”

“Amitabha!” Buddha King said again. His face did not look very kind. He pointed at Guya’s forehead, and then more blood came flowing out. That too started to drift towards the statue.

With Guya and Guna’s blood, the godlight seemed to have weakened. The six Kings kept attacking without reprieve. Then the godlight began to shatter.

The smashed light could not coalesce again because of the blood that was spreading through the rupture.

Gold Jade King and the others were all made supremely happy, as they were able to destroy the godlight with their crazed attacks. Now, they wanted to create a path through the godlight and head towards the rupture.

“These scumbag *ssholes!” Wang Yuhang was so mad, he punched the godlight. But he was too weak, and he could not even break the outer layer. All he did was make his fist numb.

Han Sen didn’t like what had happened, either, but at the end of the day, it was just natural selection. He couldn’t have helped Guna and Guya, even if he wanted to. And they weren’t in a much better position themselves.

Their powers would not be enough to breach the godlight. Even if Gold Jade King cleaved a path all the way through, they had no choice of entering.

Han Sen could jump into the sanctuary for safety, alongside Wang Yuhang, but Dragon Lady and Han Meng’er did not have anywhere to hide. If they were left alone, they’d surely die.

Guna and Guya had been frozen stiff by the Buddha King. The essence of their blood continued to leak from their foreheads. The blood was leaking slowly, but they had already lost a large volume. Especially Guya.

The two of them looked so angry, hopeless, and sad. They looked at each other, but understood that neither of them could do a thing.

They could not even die holding each other. They stood where they were as their blood was stolen, bit by bit.

Gold Jade King and the other Kings were waiting for them to finish bleeding out. The godlight was cracked, and a blood path opened. They were only one meter away from the statue.

Roar!

A giant dragon-like Purgatory Beast was bom. It came rushing towards Han Sen like mad.

It was a high tier Purgatory Beasts. Seeing it, everyone’s faces paled.
