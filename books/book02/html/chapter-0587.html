    <p>
      Zhu Ting was not afraid of being poisoned, it was just that Han Sen was
      toxic enough himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Zhu, don&#8217;t you worry! Your Deadly Perfume is the
      best; there is no need for you to fear those little mushrooms. Even if
      they are poisonous, there is no way they can poison you, the poison king,
      yes?&#8221; Han Sen did his best to comfort him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose&#8230;&#8221; Zhu Ting said cockily, but then he changed
      his face and said, &#8220;But this is different! I know I am good, but
      good or bad, ten thousand is not enough.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No problem. I am willing to raise the monetary offering for this
      kind service of yours to a whopping twenty thousand,&#8221; Han Sen said
      with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting was angry, and he pleaded, &#8220;Han Sen, you do not treat
      professionals with the respect they deserve! Twenty thousand? To lay
      bricks would give me more. You&#8230; make&#8230; me&#8230; um&#8230;
      something is wrong.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is it? Is it the poison? Don&#8217;t worry, I have medicine
      prepared! Quickly, shove this down your throat and I&#8217;ll get you on
      your way to the detox center so they can rinse out your bowels.&#8221; Han
      Sen quickly grabbed the medicine Professor Sun told him about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when he looked back, Zhu Ting&#8217;s face and eyes had gone ruby red.
      He was gasping for air like an enraged bull and sweating profusely as he
      looked at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Zhu, don&#8217;t look at me like that! I thought your
      Deadly Perfume rendered you immune to fatal poisons. Who
      knew&#8230;&#8221; Before Han Sen could finish his sentence, Zhu Ting
      started to tear the clothes from his body. Much to his surprise, a
      muscular body was revealed beneath. Zhu Ting had an eight-pack!
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Geez, what are you doing?!&#8221; Han Sen reached out his hands to
      ward off Zhu Ting from coming any closer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting&#8217;s eyes were red with lust, and as he advanced on Han Sen,
      he tried to get on top of him to rip his clothes off. Zhu Ting tried to
      kiss him with the ferocity of a horny bear.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I want&#8230; I want&#8230;&#8221; Zhu Ting moaned and groaned in
      between his mumbling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! Those mushrooms can&#8217;t be aphrodisiacs, can
      they?&#8221; Han Sen pushed Zhu Ting away from him and dashed out of the
      room. He closed the door on his lusty aggressor and locked it tight.
    </p>

    <p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>

    <p>Zhu Ting hammered the stone door like a madman.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Zhu, hold on! I&#8217;m going to get you a woman.&#8221;
      Han Sen was glad that the shelter&#8217;s doors were made of stone. Due to
      the strength needed to break down such a door, there was no way Zhu Ting
      would be able to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t take it anymore!&#8221; Zhu Ting screamed from behind
      his stone ward.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hold on! Use your hand first, while I go search for a woman in the
      meantime.&#8221; Han Sen double-checked that the door was locked firm, and
      then ran off.
    </p>

    <p>
      After walking around Blackgod Shelter for some time, Han Sen came across
      an impoverished woman who was willing to sell her body to make ends meet.
      On a horse, she returned with Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Zhu, I have brought a woman to take care of all your
      needs!&#8221; As Han Sen opened the door, he saw Zhu Ting sprawled out
      across the floor with a few shreds of cloth over his body. Crumpled balls
      of tissue lay scattered around the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, are you even a human being? I cannot believe you fed me
      horny pills!&#8221; Zhu Ting was furious, and he ran towards Han Sen,
      trying to grab him by the neck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen dodged the incoming assault and tried to reason with him, saying,
      &#8220;Brother Zhu, see? I have brought you a woman. But who would have
      guessed you&#8217;d finish up that quickly, eh?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Quick, my ass! You were out there for two hours, and here I was,
      all alone and almost bleeding. And besides, what kind of woman did you
      even bring me? This fat tramp looks to weigh two hundred kilograms! Is it
      a mutant creature?&#8221; Zhu Ting yelled angrily at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A woman with a little booty is good; you&#8217;ll never
      understand.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen waited around for a little while so Zhu Ting could calm down. Then
      he asked, &#8220;Brother Zhu, aside from this can you tell me of any other
      effects the red mushroom had upon you?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Before he replied, Zhu Ting reached out his hand and said, &#8220;Give me
      my money.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#8221; Han Sen reached into his pockets and
      presented Zhu Ting with a few thousand-dollar bills. Regretting what he
      had subjected Zhu Ting to, he said, &#8220;I know I was only supposed to
      give you twenty thousand but take thirty. Consider it my way of
      apologizing and trying to make up for what I just put you through. And
      payment for that woman will come out of own pocket; there is no need for
      you to cover the fee.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting thought what he was saying was fine, up until he mentioned the
      woman. Then his face became bleak. All of a sudden, he threw the money
      back at Han Sen. &#8220;No one wants your pity money. If you want to give
      me something, give me your medicine. Give me more of your red
      medicine!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why? What do you want it for?&#8221; Han Sen opened his eyes wide
      and looked at Zhu Ting.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is none of your business. You owe me, don&#8217;t you?
      Consider this retribution!&#8221; Zhu Ting said, with a scolding
      temperament.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pulled out the last remaining bite of mushroom. He presented it to
      Zhu Ting, but when he tried to grab it, Han Sen pulled his hand back. He
      smiled at Zhu Ting and said, &#8220;I already gave you a slice. This is
      the only one I have left. If you want it, you&#8217;re going to have to
      tell me what it does.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Aside from making me horny, you mean?&#8221; Zhu Ting said, before
      reaching out his hand again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen avoided his grab again and said, &#8220;Tell me clearly.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting then told Han Sen that the mushroom worked not only to heighten
      your desire for sexual activity, but to considerably strengthen your
      kidneys as well. The effects were powerful that even now, his kidneys were
      really warm. It was as if he had two hot water bottles inside him. He was
      brimming with so much energy that, even after playing with himself for so
      long, he was yet to feel tired.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This stuff really is the good stuff.&#8221; After Han Sen heard
      what the red mushroom did, he was quite happy. Something like this would
      most definitely benefit his progress with Jade-Sun Force.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning it by himself without any supplements would take a long time,
      after all. The red mushroom had incredible effects, and if he was to
      consume an entire mushroom, Han Sen wondered if he might be able to finish
      his study of Jade-Sun Force.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the most blatant side effect of the mushroom was quite tempting for
      Han Sen. If he got Ji Yanran to eat it, he pondered, what might happen?
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, he wasn&#8217;t able to bring the red mushroom out of the shelter,
      and Ji Yanran was nowhere near the Icefield.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, Han Sen did not give the last bit of red mushroom to Zhu Ting.
      The sexual effects of the thing were too scary. It was so powerful that
      not even Deadly Perfume could withstand it. Han Sen was worried Zhu Ting
      might use the red mushroom for an ill purpose, so he refused to hand it
      over.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting left angrily. He collected the thirty thousand and cursed Han Sen
      numerous times before leaving.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then returned to his room and locked his door. He looked at the
      last piece of mushroom in his hand. He looked and looked until at last, he
      put it in his mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      He chewed it a bit, and soon the pleasant feel of it in his teeth became a
      warmth in his belly. His kidney was already quite warm, and now, it was
      even warmer. It was as if he had two little stoves inside him, generating
      an endless supply of energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, Han Sen felt the entirety of his body heat up. What was
      below the belt could hold up the sky. He was starting to feel horny, and
      he was overwhelmed with the desire to rip his clothes off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth and held off on that feeling, casting Jade-Sun
      Force as he did. He wanted to use Jade-Sun Force to absorb the power of
      the red mushroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he did this, someone knocked on the door. From behind it, a
      woman&#8217;s voice called out to him.
