<p>The giant xenogeneic’s skeleton looked like the bones of
dinosaurs. There were wings on its back, but only the bones of its
former appearance remained.</p>
<p>On the ground below the xenogeneic’s bones, everything appeared
petrified. The surface was very rough. There were many carvings on
the bones. There were symbols and lines. There were weird crystals
on the symbols and lines.</p>
<p>“This is the true space demon dragon,” Bai Kanglang said while
staring at the bones.</p>
<p>“This must be the skeleton of a true god class true space demon
dragon,” Bai Wanjie said. “The legends say the true space demon
dragon had teleportation powers. Mister Alpha used the true space
demon dragon’s bones to complete a space teleporter. It was very
expensive.”</p>
<p>All the princes and princesses complimented the Extreme King
Alpha’s method, but Han Sen did not think that place had been made
by the Extreme King Alpha.</p>
<p>As they walked out of the true space demon dragon’s skeleton,
they saw an island. There was a blue sea around it, but the
seawater was extremely dark. It was like ink. There were no
waves.</p>
<p>On the left side of the sea, Han Sen saw a wooden bridge. The
wooden bridge was straight. It was a path to get across the sea.
Although the sea had many clouds around, they could still see the
other end of the wooden bridge. It was another island.</p>
<p>Because the sea’s clouds were so thick, the light grey mist
severely hampered their vision. They could only see a blurry shadow
lurking on the island.</p>
<p>Most of the prince and princesses tried to use geno arts to look
at the island. They immediately discovered that no matter if they
used their vision or senses, they both became greatly worse in the
grey mist. If they tried any further, the entire effectiveness
would be gone.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar said, “It looks like the island is our
destination. Let’s go to the island first.” He instantly started
flying toward the island.</p>
<p>He had flown about 6 to 9 feet when a sudden scream sounded.
Prince Swordstar was sucked down to the ground. It was like a
magnet had claimed him.</p>
<p>Because he wasn’t prepared, Prince Swordstar did not react. He
fell to the ground and felt a lot of pain. It seemed as if he had
fallen poorly.</p>
<p>“Air-restricted area,” Bai Wanjie said with a frown.</p>
<p>Just that height was enough to make Prince Swordstar fall like
that, meaning it was obvious that it was an air-restricted
area.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder why there is a wooden bridge,” Bai Lingshang
said, looking at the wooden bridge.</p>
<p>Seeing what happened to Prince Swordstar, no one dared to
recklessly do anything else. They watched for a while and decided
that the bridge was the only way to proceed. The prince and
princesses stepped across the bridge and walked to the island ahead
of them.</p>
<p>“What is this sea? The water is dark like ink. I cannot see what
lurks beneath the waves. There is no wind. There aren’t any waves
either. There is not a single movement.” Prince Swordstar kept
watching the sea as he walked. He seemed to be annoyed.</p>
<p>This annoying feeling stemmed from nervousness. When Han Sen
looked at the black sea, he felt the same way. He could not blame
Prince Swordstar for feeling the way he did.</p>
<p>The other prince and princesses felt the same way as well. They
just did not behave like Prince Swordstar did and show it on their
sleeves.</p>
<p>“The Extreme King would not actually put their princes and
princesses in danger, right?” Han Sen looked at all the prestigious
princes and princesses, but his gaze lingered on Bai Wei.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked more mature than she did before. She appeared
beautiful and young, but the atmosphere around her did not go well
with her age.</p>
<p>“It looks like Bai Wei has grown up a lot.” Han Sen sighed. He
looked away to prevent staring at her too much. Otherwise, she
might have noticed something.</p>
<p>The bridge was 30 to 40 miles long. The entire journey made them
nervous, but nothing eventful or dangerous transpired. From far
away, they could see the island looked like a volcanic island. It
was very low around the very high center. It looked like a
volcano.</p>
<p>There was a red, metallic palace on top of the volcano.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the palace. The title of the palace was
written in the generic written language of the universe, “Red
Temple.” It was just those two words.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the palace. He was shocked. The word “temple”
was not very common in the universe. The temples Han Sen knew about
were the ones occupied by God Spirits.</p>
<p>This metal palace was named Red Temple. Han Sen thought it was
quite strange.</p>
<p>“This should not be the god temple with the God Spirit inside.
Otherwise, there would not be the word temple.” Han Sen thought
about it, which made him more curious. He wondered what might be
inside the Red Temple.</p>
<p>Seeing all of the princes and princesses leaving the wooden
bridge, Bai Wanjie suddenly stopped everybody. “Wait a second.”</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at Bai Wanjie. They did not know what he
meant.</p>
<p>“What has the crown prince learned?” Prince Qing Xia asked.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie pointed at the wooden bridge. He pointed at a wooden
said. It said, “Thousands of armies on the wooden bridge. Red
Temple only keeps the undead.”</p>
<p>Earlier, everyone was lured in by the Red Temple by its peak.
They had not observed the bridge. Now, Bai Wanjie pulled their
attention to the sign.</p>
<p>Bai Lingshang did not understand what it meant, so he looked at
Bai Wanjie and asked, “Crown Prince, do you know what it
means?”</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie shook his head. “I do not know.”</p>
<p>Prince Qing Xia said, “Thousands of armies crossing the bridge
is not difficult to understand. It means out of many, many people
that cross, only one goes through. This has a similar meaning to
the thousand dry bones that are now famous. If it says only one of
us can go across this bridge, it makes little sense. It also says
that the Red Temple is home to the undead. That cannot be
understood. The undead means us or the people in the Red Temple.
Nobody knows.”</p>
<p>“Since we are already here, there is no point in turning back,”
Bai Kanglang said. “Let’s go to the Red Temple first.” He walked
forward and stepped off the bridge.</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Kanglang be so brave, Han Sen smiled. He could guess
what Bai Kanglang meant.</p>
<p>Thousands of armies crossing the bridge one at a time likely
meant something. Perhaps the first that crossed would be the
recipient of something good, which is why Bai Kanglang said that.
It was not that he was born brave. Plus, the more he walked, the
more careful he was.</p>
<p>The princes and princesses saw Bai Kanglang exit the bridge
without danger. They quickly decided to follow.</p>
<p>Seeing all the prince and princesses safely arrive, Bai Kanglang
looked a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>They walked up the Red Temple’s stone stairs. They noted how the
entire structure of the temple was built from metal. From afar, it
looked like a bead of fire.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Everyone was checking out the Red Temple when they heard a loud
noise. The Red Temple’s door opened by itself.</p>
