  Han Sen looked at Barr with surprise. Han Meng’er’s power was undoubtedly the best out of all Marquises. She was just as powerful as Han Sen when he used Break Six Skies.

But even after being subjected to that massive amount of power, Barr was able to heal at an alarming speed. And on top of that, the lifeforce inside his body became stronger. That had to be something more than a simple healing ability. It was obvious that Barr had a powerful body, and that must have been how he was able to survive Dragon One’s pursuit as a Duke.

The guy’s eyes looked menacing, as if killing was his only desire. What Barr saw now wasn’t just prey. Han Sen knew the man before him loved nothing more than the pleasure of taking a life.

“A born killing machine,” Han Sen thought.

Barr’s ugly face looked very excited. It was a rather twisted sight. He licked his lips while he stared at Han Meng’er. Slowly, he started to approach her. The blood air of the bone knife spread out like a tide and then rose up like black fire. It was wholly demonic. The scary presence of it began to spread and suffuse his body.

Han Meng’er was going to raise her bow once again, but Han Sen stopped her with a hand. He smiled and said, “Let me do it. His body is weird, and I think we’ll need something more than simple damage output to deal with him.”

Han Meng’er’s strongest ability was the destructive arrow, but it had now been rendered useless against Barr. Han Sen didn’t want her to take any more risks.

When Han Meng’er relaxed her fingers, the bow disappeared. Then, she moved to position herself behind Han Sen.

When Barr saw Han Sen step between Han Meng’er and himself, his face darkened. The bone knife in his hand lurched toward Han Sen, the knife’s red power spreading like the abyss.

“Get lost!” he screamed.

Barr’s original target was supposed to be Han Sen, but he had now decided that Han Meng’er would be his prey. He wasn’t interested in Han Sen anymore, and all he wanted to do now was slay Han Meng’er. He looked as if he had spent the last three days and nights hungry, deprived of food. And now, he had stumbled across a feast that was being taken away from him.

There was no hitman more stubborn than Barr.

Han Sen looked calm as he pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and slashed in his opponent’s direction.

Dong!

When the knives came against each other, the black blood and the purple air shattered. The blades hit each other with enough force to tear the fabric of space. And indeed, space really did break, cracks spreading from the impact like a spider web. The dark red and purple colors were lost in the chaos.

“Die!” Barr’s ugly faces looked more and more excited. The fire in his eyes was almost becoming something real. He looked at Han Sen and quickly waved his bone knife again. The dark beast’s shadow appeared behind the oncoming strike.

Barr’s knife skills were very rough. There was no finesse or technique to his movements. There was nothing amazing about his skills, and he was a very different fighter than someone like Lone Bamboo.

His knife skills were very rough, wild, violent, and flawed. He didn’t care about the more granular details. His efforts were focused into brute force.

Now, Han Sen knew why Barr was not born as a bona fide Destroyed. It was like he was only there to destroy things. It was as if he didn’t have any care for himself, and all he wished to do was wreck whatever got in his way.

While knife skills like his were riddled with flaws, Barr did not care. He did not even try to fix them. He just wanted to kill whatever opponent he encountered.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

The ugly face kept screaming, and it looked more and more creepy as time progressed. The bone knife was swinging wildly with the aim of consuming Han Sen’s body.

Katcha!

Han Sen’s Ghost Teeth Knife slashed across Barr’s chest. A deep red cut appeared, and blood and purple air began to leak from the seam.

But Barr did not care. The wound did not slow down his assault. If anything, it made him look more excited than ever.

Although the wound could not heal because it had been infused with Teeth power, the attack wasn’t strong enough to spread and tear up his body. The purple gash just remained where it was.

Han Sen went on to deal another ten of those attacks. They did not work well, and it seemed like Barr was getting as strong as the devil. And all he wanted was to see Han Sen dead.

Dong!

Ghost Teeth Knife and the bone knife struck each other again. This time, though, Han Sen felt a powerful force come against him. He was sent flying fifty meters back through the air.

In a few minutes, Barr’s power had doubled. And furthermore, it was continuing to grow. The wounds weren’t making him weaker. They were actually making him stronger.

“Han Sen is strong. He cannot be any weaker than Lone Bamboo. Ordinary Dukes definitely couldn’t beat him. It is just a shame that he has picked on the wrong enemy. Barr is a genuine killing machine. During a fight, he continues getting stronger until he can destroy his enemy. Even a King like Dragon One was unable to kill him.” A Destroyed Duke looked at Han Sen and smiled confidently.

Qing Li observed Han Sen’s situation, and she acknowledged that it wasn’t going very well. She felt nervous and wondered out loud, “What is Barr’s body actually like? Why can Teeth power not spread across him?”

Han Sen was also beginning to understand just how powerful Barr was. He knew that if he was to deal with an enemy such as that, straight-up violence wouldn’t be enough to take him down. Even Teeth powers couldn’t rip up Barr’s body, and that spoke volumes about the man’s talents. The more he fought, the stronger he was going to get.

Seeing Barr holding his bone knife in front of him like some demon, Han Sen thought of something. Then, he made a move. He dodged Barr’s bone knife and put his Ghost Teeth Knife away. A pair of pistols then appeared in his hands.

Pang! Pang!

Two bullets thudded into Barr’s chest, but at this point, the muscles had become too strong to penetrate. The bullets shattered the moment they came against the steel-like bands of Barr’s chest.

But those two bullets each left behind an image of a turtle. Barr tumbled to the ground, leaving a deep crater. Now, he was many times slower.

“His body is strong, but he is not good at resisting debilitative effects. Turtle worked on him perfectly,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Seeing Barr’s reduced speed, Qing Li was very happy. She exclaimed, “It works! That must be the trick called Turtle, which Han Sen himself created. It is so strong that it has actually managed to suppress Barr.”

“If he thinks a sealing power is enough to defeat Barr, then he is very wrong.” One of the Duke Destroyed snorted in disdain.

“This is good! I am so excited. So much food for me.” Barr’s ugly faces devolved further and further into insanity. The cold face in the middle was suddenly starting to move. The eyes turned black and began to shine. Then Barr’s body began to turn black. He was turning into dark steel. He was like a demon statue that had been forged from some ancient metal.

The Turtle spell, which had previously slowed him down, suddenly lost all effect. Barr’s body was freed, and he flew up high. He slashed towards Han Sen with the power of a devil.
