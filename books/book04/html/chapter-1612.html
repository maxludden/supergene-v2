      After the meeting, Tina went up to Qing Ya with a request. “Uncle Qing Ya,
      can you take me with you? I want to see that human die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Last time you snuck out and lost the geno armor. That upset the leader,
      so you should stay home. I don’t think he’d want you going out this time.”
      Qing Ya gave her a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Uncle Qing Ya, it’s because Han Sen stole it from me that I want to watch
      him die. Kill him and take the armor back. Oh, please take me with you.”
      Tina swung Qing Ya’s arms as she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t think so. You can ask Sha Linjia, though. If he says it’s okay,
      then I will bring you along,” Qing Ya said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina lifted her lips and said, “Sha Linjia is nothing. He is only a shura.
      I don’t need his permission. Uncle Qing Ya, please take me. I want to go!
      That Han Sen is going to die, and Father is practicing. If something bad
      happens, you can protect me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina begged for a while, until Qing Ya had no choice but to agree and say,
      “Fine, I will take you. But you have to listen to everything I tell you.
      If you don’t, I won’t be taking you anywhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Uncle Qing Ya, you are the best! I will listen to everything you tell
      me.” Tina was very happy.
    </p>
    <p>“Go and pack up. Wait for Sha Linjia’s command,” Qing Ya told her.</p>
    <p>
      Tina was not happy about that, though. Again, she lifted her lips. She
      said, “That Sha Linjia is nothing. He is much worse than you. I don’t know
      why Father trusts him so much and lets him do what he wants.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he can earn the leader’s trust as he has, then that means only one
      thing: he is good. Just go and ready up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was packing in his house. He decided to fly the beetle to Planet
      Tariq. Even if the leader wasn’t there, he was happy to take out a few
      lackeys and goons in a good raid. He wanted to let them know that Han Sen
      was not someone you could bully. He wanted to send a message and end their
      attempts to push him around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen flew the beetle for two days, but he was still in hyperspace. He
      received a message from an unknown number. “There is danger. Leave Shadow
      Shelter now. Blind Man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked to hear this. Blind Man had sent him a concerning
      alert, and on top of that, he had used an unsafe method of sending it. If
      Blind Man did not have the time to visit Han Sen personally, then that
      meant it had to be an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does the New Community wish to attack Shadow Shelter? That should be
      impossible! Shadow Shelter is not big, but that’s where I am. With Gu
      Qingcheng and Little Pony there, too, not even a super shelter should be
      able to conquer us. What makes them think they have what it takes to do
      that? Gah, true or false, I suppose it is best to return and make sure.”
      After a moment of extra thought, Han Sen made his decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadow Shelter was three hundred miles away. There were a dozen shura
      fighters situated in a canyon. When the shura were able to enter the
      sanctuary, many would go there for the simple adventure. But the shelter’s
      genes and beast souls were useless for the shura, meaning not many took
      the time to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that there were a dozen there, humans who spotted them would be given
      a massive fright. They were, after all, all fourth rank fighters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shura fighters were accompanied by horrible creatures. It was obvious
      that they were super creatures, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sha Linjia looked at the super creatures and shura gathered and was
      pleased. He said, “Good. We have to go, and we have to end Han Sen this
      time, once and for all.”
    </p>
    <p>“Qing Ya, stay next to me,” Sha Linjia said, looking at Qing Ya.</p>
    <p>Qing Ya simply nodded and didn’t say a word.</p>
    <p>
      Sha Linjia patted the beast he rode upon, and then it released a mist that
      camouflaged the enclave on their way towards Shadow Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep was with Green Cow and the others in Shadow Shelter like
      usual. As he walked, he saw Gu Qingcheng venture towards the gate of the
      shelter. With a forced smile, Cheap Sheep approached and said, “If you
      need anything, I can go grab it for you. There’s no need for you to leave
      on an errand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Kick everyone out of here,” Gu Qingcheng said coldly, eyes peering out
      beyond the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” Cheap Sheep and Green Cow froze, unsure of what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All the creatures, you two included, need to leave. You need to get out
      if you want to live, and go as far as you can. Don’t make me tell you this
      again,” Gu Qingcheng said, then went beyond the gate of the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow froze in place. They did not know what they
      should do. They didn’t dare ask her again, and they’d feel terrible if
      they simply left without telling Han Sen. Cheap Sheep couldn’t act on this
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just do what she said,” said a soft voice. Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were
      frozen until that voice greeted them. It was Little Silver approaching,
      and the voice came from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t just Little Silver, either. Starsea Beast, Ice Seahorse, and the
      lazy Red Pony appeared, coming out from the garden, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every important member of the shelter came forward, which told Cheap Sheep
      and Green Cow something important was about to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s going on? Should we inform the boss?” They knew Little Silver was
      Han Sen’s favorite pet. Her words wouldn’t be wrong, but they asked, just
      to make sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s okay. Just go before it is too late.” Little Silver then ran outside
      the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow realized things were bad. They followed Little
      Silver’s advice and got on with evacuating all the other creatures from
      the premises. They had no clue what was going on, and it led to much
      discussion. Many refused to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep then ran out of the gate to speak with Little Silver and Gu
      Qingcheng. He said, “This is a little difficult, as I cannot convince them
      all to leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It doesn’t matter now, anyway. It is too late,” Gu Qingcheng said,
      looking forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a mist approaching in the distance, and scary creatures soon
      emerged from it. Atop the backs of the creatures were humanoid-like
      creatures, all with horns upon their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow, when they saw that horde, almost wet
      themselves. The life-forces of the creatures were incredibly frightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they knew why Gu Qingcheng had suggested everyone should leave. The
      shelter was in big trouble.
