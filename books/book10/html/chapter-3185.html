<p>My name is Han Jinzhi, a five-year-old child in Elephant
Kindergarten, year three. I should be at the stage of a flower with
a colorful life. To me, all I see is darkness.</p>
<p>I am from a family of liars. My father was a liar. My
grandfather was a liar. My grandad’s grandad was a liar. I don’t
know which grandad it started with, but we are a family of
scammers.</p>
<p>The scammers are an organization. The people in this
organization disguise themselves as fortune-tellers. All they do is
lie to people. Although the organization’s members can tell
fortunes, none of them believe in fate. The so-called fate is just
a tool for scammers to lie with.</p>
<p>The scammers do not believe in fate and reincarnation. They do
not believe in karma. They do not talk about relationships. They
are good at watching people and calculating their decision.</p>
<p>If people become a target of the scammers, it means nothing but
bad luck for them. They would end up losing money easily. If their
luck was very bad, the family would probably be broken, and people
would die.</p>
<p>I come from a family with that kind of background, but I believe
in fate. More accurately, I can see fate.</p>
<p>Yes, to use words that modern people use, you might say that I
have superpowers. My powers enable me to see things.</p>
<p>My powers enable me to see more than the fate of a person. Every
substance in this world can be seen through by me, and I can
analyze the fate of all.</p>
<p>For example, I can see the results of the next lottery. I will
be able to tell what the lottery numbers are. If I wanted to, I
could see which horse will win in the next horse race.</p>
<p>I can even tell what job people will end up doing, who they will
end up marrying, and where they’ll die. If I choose to, I can see
everyone’s ending.</p>
<p>Although my powers cannot enable me to see one’s progress,
seeing the end, which is all I can do, is enough.</p>
<p>I am like a cheater who can see all the answers to an exam. It
does not matter how I get somewhere. As long as I can see the
answers, it does not matter. I cannot be wrong.</p>
<p>Some people think this is great. It is like living the life of a
cheater. It certainly makes people jealous and crazy, but I would
rather not have any power. The power to see the fates of all has
led me down a dark life. Although I am only five years old, I carry
the weight of an old man on his death bed. I am not interested in
anything.</p>
<p>In kindergarten, I have a very good friend. He loves to play
football. His dream is to become a football-playing superstar. He
also wants me to practice playing football with him so I can become
his best partner. He wants to win the World Cup and become a
superstar.</p>
<p>I thought this was a great idea. After thinking about it, my
superpower started. I saw my little friend’s future.</p>
<p>In the future, I can see he is not a football player. He is a
fat, middle-aged salesman who gets drunk every day. Not even
mentioning football, after running 150 feet, he would probably end
up collapsing due to exhaustion.</p>
<p>It was at that moment I lost all interest in football. No matter
how hard I try to play with him, I knew he would not end up being a
football player. It would just be a waste of time. The fates I see
are never wrong, and they can never be changed.</p>
<p>In Elephant Kindergarten, I have a very beautiful classmate. I
like her a lot. I would like to be her best friend. I might even
like to be more than that.</p>
<p>When I think about her, my superpowers kick in. It enables me to
see into her future. She will be married to a 40-year-old bald guy.
She will wear a wedding dress and go down the aisle of a church
with that man.</p>
<p>At that moment, my life was ruined.</p>
<p>I lost interest in everything because no matter what I did, I
saw the end of all futures.</p>
<p>I go to watch football, but I know the result. I go and watch a
movie, but I know what the ending will entail. If I go to watch
pretty women swim, but I see the pretty women become old before
they die. This world is cruel to me. Darkness is all around me.
It’s all there is.</p>
<p>I have tried to change fate, such as me hating onions. I saw
that my mother was going to make onions and fried eggs in the
morning, so I threw all the onions away at home and bought all the
onions in the supermarkets and markets of three shopping
districts.</p>
<p>Don’t ask me why a five-year-old kid can do this. Money has
never been a concern for me.</p>
<p>The next morning, I saw that the eggs for breakfast still
contained onions. It broke my little heart.</p>
<p>“Baby, you should eat more onions. Recently, Grandad from the
countryside has grown a lot of onions. It was a great harvest this
year. We have lots and lots of them.” Mom was happy as she was
telling me this.</p>
<p>So, we ate onions for a month. I started to think it was a
punishment from God for me trying to change fate.</p>
<p>No one can understand my pain. In this world, there are no
unknowns to me. There is nothing fresh for me. I have lost the
thing in my life I most cherished. What was that? It was a hope for
the future.</p>
<p>On my way home from school, I watched the sunset above the
river. It made me feel extremely sad.</p>
<p>I asked myself why a five-year-old kindergartener would end up
walking home alone. It was no big deal because my mother, father,
grandfather, grandmother, uncles, and aunties are all scammers.
They are the masters of it. They have always been busy. They never
had the time to pick me up from school.</p>
<p>Of course, my mother tried to take me to school. On our way
there, she scammed two wallets and a car from someone. By the time
we reached school, she tried to scam my kindergarten teacher. I
forced her out of the school and begged them to never take me there
again.</p>
<p>“Sigh. What is the point of my life?” Sitting near a river, my
heart just felt sad.</p>
<p>Going home was meaningless to me. There would be no one at home.
I heard that everyone will be taking part in an operation to scam a
rich man. It has been half a month since I saw them.</p>
<p>“Little Brother, why are you here? Did you lose your family?” A
soft voice sounded in my head.</p>
<p>From the tip of my nose, I detected a very young presence. I
raised my head to take a look. I realized it was a big sister
wearing white sports clothing. Her hair was up in a ponytail.</p>
<p>I was shocked. I had never seen such a beautiful woman there
before. She was obviously out for a jog. She must have been living
in the area.</p>
<p>The big sister noticed I did not respond. She crouched to my
level, took my hand, and asked me, “Little Brother, what is your
name?”</p>
<p>“My name is Han Jinzhi.” I could not help but answer. Usually, I
did not talk to people, but I was a kindergartener who judged
people by their appearance. This girl was mega pretty and cute. I
was more than obliged to answer her.</p>
<p>“Your name is pretty funny,” the big sister said with a soft
smile. “It does not sound like a name someone this young should
have.”</p>
<p>“My name was given to me by my grandfather,” I replied. “He said
our family cannot be made to obey ghosts and gods, nor do we need
to have manners. We don’t need to be kind or care about ethics and
moralities, but we must be respectful. Otherwise, we are not human.
That is why they gave me the name Han Jinzhi. It was so I could
have a bit of humanity.”</p>
<p>Actually, I never understood what my grandfather meant. When
they started to lie, they never seemed to care about the well-being
of others. When they got home, they never talked about lying.</p>
<p>“Your grandfather is funny,” the big sister said with a smile.
Maybe she thought I was joking.</p>
<p>I did not dare look at her. I was afraid I might accidentally
see her future and end up watching her die or have sex with an old
man. That would only make me sad.</p>
<p>“Little Zhi Zhi, would you like to come and drink a milk tea
with me?” the big sister asked.</p>
<p>Although I did not like milk tea, I was a kindergartener who
judged people via their appearance. Therefore, I nodded in
acceptance. I grabbed her hand and followed her to a milk tea
shop.</p>
<p>I was not afraid of her being a human trafficker. When I was
free, I helped two human traffickers who once tried to sell me.
When I left, they thanked me.</p>
<p>The big sister was cute and nice. Drinking milk tea with her
made me very happy. It made my sorrows fall out of mind for a time,
which led me to eventually look at her. It was at this time my
damned abilities of clairvoyance kicked in.</p>
<p>The scene that broke my heart played in my head. The beautiful
and cute big sister got out of a red sports car. Then, a group of
people dressed in black gunned her down. Her blood spilled out like
flowers. Without a doubt, she was going to die.</p>
<p>My mood dropped into another realm of darkness. I only saw the
future without knowing how or when it would happen. I also did not
know where it would happen. Whatever the case might have been, I
could not stop it from happening.</p>
<p>I hated myself for having powers like that, and I hated myself
for being even more useless. I did not want things to end that
way.</p>
<p>The big sister could see I was looking upset. With genuine
worry, she asked me what was wrong. “Little Zhi Zhi, what is
wrong?”</p>
<p>“Big Sister, can you not drive a red sports car for a while?” I
tried again to change her fate.</p>
<p>“Why?” the big sister asked with a weird look.</p>
<p>“I can see the future. If you drive a red sports car, your life
will be cut short.” I knew this would be very hard for her to
believe, but I really wanted to convince her. I did not want to
watch her die.</p>
<p>The big sister looked surprised. She used her soft hands to
touch my head. She smiled and said, “Little Zhi Zhi, you are
concerned for my well-being. I thank you very much for that, but I
am not going to die.”</p>
<p>“I knew you would not believe me, but the future cannot be
changed.” I was very disappointed. I felt an ache in my heart. I
hated myself for being so useless.</p>
<p>The big sister grabbed my hand and looked serious. She said, “I
believe you, Little Zhi Zhi. You just need to remember that the end
is not the end. If you really have a superpower that enables you to
see the future, if you see people down the line who require
assistance, you should not give up the pursuit to course correct
and help them. It does not matter what happens in the end. Just try
your best to do your job. Is that OK?”</p>
<p>My mood was terrible. All I did was nod. I didn’t even listen to
her properly. I left the big sister in a sour mood, but I kept
thinking that I could not let this go.</p>
<p>She was a kind and cute big sister. I could not sit idly by and
let her die.</p>
<p>“Even if God wants her dead, I must do what I can to save her.”
My heart suddenly mustered the courage needed to fight.</p>
<p>Although I did not know her name or know where she lived, it was
not a big problem for people who were born into a family of
scammers.</p>
<p>Scammers were very good at gathering information and predicting
things. I thought about the future scenes. The location where the
big sister got killed was at a large crossroads. There were no
signs. Judging from the plants near the road, there was only one
place in the city it could have been. The telltale sign was the
Allen Grass. When it happened, it had to be in this city.</p>
<p>“The width of the main road was 120 feet. There are only three
main roads with a width like that.” I kept analyzing the images I
had. I studied a map to try and find my target.</p>
<p>“Judging from the moon’s location, the time should be around 10
a.m. It is tonight…” I looked at the time. It was five minutes away
from the time of the hit.</p>
<p>“No…” I hated myself for not trying to save the big sister
sooner. If I had been able to do things sooner, I might have been
able to keep her safe.</p>
<p>Before we parted ways, I should have gotten her phone number.
That could have helped this situation be avoided.</p>
<p>I madly ran out of the room. I stole the bike my Mom rode to buy
food each day and went as fast as I could to the location I had
determined the event would be taking place.</p>
<p>The traffic rules and lights could all go to hell. I had to save
Big Sister.</p>
<p>I road as fast as I was able to, but the bike felt as if it was
no quicker than a snail. I watched time go by. I was in a huge
rush.</p>
<p>Finally, I arrived at the street I saw in my future vision. I
saw Big Sister’s red sports car. She got out of the car. She was
very pretty that night. She was wearing a red jacket and stockings.
Her heels looked very attractive.</p>
<p>At the same time, I saw men in black holding machineguns.</p>
<p>“Big… Sis… ter… hurry… run…” I was too late to save big sister.
I road as fast as I could to the men in black and shouted.</p>
<p>Ta-ta-ta-ta! Pang!</p>
<p>The sound of the guns and a collision made their noises louder.
I steered my bike to hit the men in black. The men in black fired
their guns, but they did not hit the big sister.</p>
<p>“This is great!” I did not think about what the result might
have been. I just felt happy about saving the big sister. I had
never felt this happy before.</p>
<p>“Cut! Cut! Cut! Who is this kid?”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Director. That is my friend.”</p>
<p>After falling onto the ground, I saw a middle-aged man with a
megaphone. He was shouting madly. People were using all kinds of
tools around. The big sister apologized to the middle-aged man. I
had an emotion overwhelm me that had never happened before. I was
frozen.</p>
<p>The big sister came in front of me. She held me in her arms and
asked with worry, “Little Zhi Zhi, thank you for saving me. Are you
OK?”</p>
<p>“I am fine. I am just glad you are OK.” I was finally starting
to realize what had happened. I was not annoyed by my mistake. I
actually thought it was rather wonderful.</p>
<p>After I told my five-year-old story, I lit up a cigarette and
breathed deeply. I exhaled the smoke. With a righteous look, I
said, “Ever since that time, I understood that the end was not the
end. If I found people who needed help, I would help. I would ask
for their phone numbers. Although the chances are one in a million,
I have decided to save whoever I can. It was the promise I made to
that big sister.”</p>
<p>The pretty girl sitting next to me looked at me. She looked
scary. She was like a volcano about to erupt. She madly shouted,
“Han Jinzhi, is that why when I went to the bathroom you decided to
ask that pretty woman for her phone number?”</p>
<p>Slap!</p>
<p>What happened next was a slap. There was then the scene of a
pretty woman madly leaving.</p>
<p>“Fine. I admit it. The story is real, but I only wanted to hit
on the hot woman. I couldn’t help it because I am Han Jinzhi. I am
a guy who judges people by their appearances.” Seeing the pretty
woman leave, I picked up a cigarette and took another hefty puff. I
let the smoke flow out. In my eyes, I looked into the future of the
beautiful woman.</p>
<p>There was a fire where Han Sen was. Fire was everywhere in the
bar. Wires sparked. Lots of lights fell from the roof. A big,
circular light hit the beautiful girl’s head while she was
running.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>The fire alarm started ringing.</p>
<p>“Can I change the future?” Seeing everyone running in fear with
the fire spreading, I calmly sat in front of the bar. I picked up a
drink and looked at the light in the center of the bar.</p>
<p>The scammers are an organization, the people of which are
scammers that disguise themselves as fortune-tellers. All they do
is lie to people. Although the organization’s members can tell
fortunes, none of them believe in fate. The so-called fate is just
a tool for scammers to lie with.</p>
<p>The scammers do not believe in fate and reincarnation. They do
not believe in karma. They do not talk about relationships. They
are good at watching people and calculating their decision.</p>
<p>If people become a target of the scammers, it was nothing but
bad luck for them. They would end up losing money easily. If the
luck was worse, the family would probably break and people would
die.</p>
<p>I came from a family with that kind of background, but I believe
in fate. More accurately, I can see fate.</p>
<p>Yes, to use words that modern people use, you might say I have
superpowers. My powers enable me to see things.</p>
<p>My powers enable me to see more than the fate of a person. Every
substance in this world can be seen through by me, and I can
analyze the fate of all.</p>
<p>Such as, I can see what the results of the next lottery will be.
I will be able to tell what the lottery numbers are. And if I want
to, I can see which horse will win in the next horse race.</p>
<p>I can even tell what job people will end doing and who they will
end up marrying, where they’ll die. If I want, I can see the ends
of everyone.</p>
<p>Although my powers cannot enable me to see one’s progress,
seeing the end – which is all I can do – is enough.</p>
<p>I am like a cheater that can see all the answers to an exam. It
does not matter how I get somewhere, but as long as I can see the
answers, it does not matter. I cannot be wrong.</p>
<p>Some people think this is great. It is like living the life of a
cheater. It certainly makes people jealous and crazy, but I would
rather not have any power. The power to see the fates of all has
led me down a dark life. Although I am only five years old, I carry
the weight of an old man on his death bed. I am not interested in
anything.</p>
<p>In kindergarten, I have a very good friend. He loves to play
football quite a lot, and his dream is to become a football-playing
superstar. He also wants me to practice playing football with him,
so I can become his best partner. He wants to win the world cup and
become a superstar.</p>
<p>I thought this was great, but after thinking about it, my
superpower had only just started. I saw my little friend’s
future.</p>
<p>But in the future, I can see he is not a football player. He is
a fat, middle-aged salesman that gets drunk every day. Let’s not
even mention football, but after running fifty meters, he would
probably end up collapsing due to exhaustion.</p>
<p>It was at that moment I lost all interest in football. That was
because, no matter how hard I try to play with him, he will not end
up being a football player. It would just be a waste of time. The
fates I see are never wrong and they can never be changed.</p>
<p>In our Elephant Kindergarten, there is a very beautiful
classmate of mine. I like her a lot. I would like to be her best
friend. I might even like to be more than that.</p>
<p>But when I think about her, my superpowers kick in. It enables
me to see into her future, and in the future, she will be married
to a forty-year-old bald guy. She will wear a wedding dress and go
down the aisle of a church with that man.</p>
<p>At that moment, my life was ruined.</p>
<p>I lost interest in everything because no matter what I do, I see
the end of all futures.</p>
<p>I go to watch football, I know the result. I go and watch a
movie, I know what the ending will entail. If I go to watch pretty
women swim, I will see the pretty women become so old before they
die. This world is so cruel to me. Darkness is all around me. It’s
all there is.</p>
<p>I have tried to change fate, like me hating onions. I see in the
future that my mother will make onions and fried eggs in the

ultra-cute. I was more than obliged to answer her.</p>
<p>“Your name is pretty funny. It does not look like a name someone

<p>“This is a name that was given to me by my grandfather. He said

with big sister?” the big sister asked.</p>

location… it is tonight…” I look at the time. It was five minutes
away from the time of the hit.</p>
<p>“No…” I hate myself for not trying to save the big sister
sooner. If I had been able to do things sooner, I might have been
able to keep her safe.</p>
<p>Or before we parted ways, I got her phone number, this could
have definitely been avoided.</p>
<p>I ran out of the room like mad. I stole the bike my mum rode to
buy food each day and I went as fast as I could to the location I
had determined the event to be.</p>
<p>The traffic rules. The lights. They could all go to hell. I had
to save Big Sister.</p>
<p>I drive as fast as I was able to, but the bike felt as if it was
no quicker than a snail. I watched the time go by and I was in a
huge rush.</p>
<p>Finally, I came to the street I saw in my future vision. I saw
Big Sister’s red supercar. She got out of the car, so pretty that
night. She was wearing a red jacket and stockings. Her heel also
looked very attractive.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I saw the men in black hold their
machineguns.</p>
<p>“Big… Sis… ter… hurry… run…” It was too late to save big sister.
I drove as fast as I could to the men in black and shouted.</p>
<p>Ta-ta-ta-ta! Pang!</p>
<p>The sound of the guns and the sound of a collision made their
noises together. I and my bike hit the men in black. The men in
black fired their guns a bit, but they did not hit Big Sister.</p>
<p>“This is great!” I did not think about what the result of this
might have been, but I felt so happy about saving Big Sister. I had
never felt this happy before.</p>
<p>“Cut! Cut! Cut! Who is this kid?”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, director. But that is my friend.”</p>
<p>After falling onto the floor, he saw a middle-aged man on a
megaphone. He was shouting madly. People were using all kinds of
tools around. Big Sister apologized to the middle-aged man. I had
an emotion overwhelm me that had never happened before. I was
frozen.</p>
<p>“Little Zhi Zhi, thank you for saving me. Are you okay?” Big
Sister came in front of me. She held me in her arms and asked with
worry.</p>
<p>“I am fine. I am just glad you are okay.” I was finally starting
to realize what had been happening. I was not annoyed by my
mistake. I actually thought this was rather wonderful.</p>
<p>After I told my five-year-old story, I lit up a cigarette and
breathed deeply. I exhaled the smoke and with a righteous look
said, “Ever since that time, I understood that the end was not the
end. If I found people that needed help, I would help. I would ask
for their phone numbers. Although the chances are one in a million,
I have decided to save whoever I can. It was the promise I made to
that big sister.”</p>
<p>The pretty girl that sat next to me looked at me. She looked so
scary. She was like a volcanic eruption. She madly shouted at me,
“Han Jinzhi, is that why when I went to the bathroom you decided to
ask that pretty woman for her phone number?”</p>
<p>Slap!</p>
<p>What happened next was a slap. And then there was the scene of a
pretty woman leaving madly.</p>
<p>“Fine. I admit it. The story is real, but I only wanted to hit
on the hot woman. I couldn’t help it because I am Han Jinzhi. I am
a guy who judges people by their appearances.” Seeing the pretty
woman leave, I pick up a cigarette and take another hefty puff. I
let the smoke flow out, and in my eyes, I looked into the future of
the beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Where Han Sen was now, there was a fire. In the bar, a fire was
everywhere. Wires sparked. Lots of lights fell from the roof. A
big, circular light hit the beautiful girl’s head while she was
running.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>The fire alarm rang.</p>
<p>“Can I change the future?” Seeing everyone running in fear with
the fire spreading, I calmly sat in front of the bar. I picked up a
glass with a drink and looked at the light that was in the center
of the bar.</p>
