  “It’s you!” Tian Jing noticed it was Han Sen who had arrived, so she frowned.

“What a coincidence that we meet again, and out here of all places,” Han Sen said with a smile. “Fate has definitely made us cross

paths.”

“What are you doing here?” Tian Jing looked at Han Sen coldly. She placed Bao’er behind her back.

Han Sen shook his head. “Do not worry, I am only passing through. I did not expect to see you guys here.”

Tian Jing did not believe what Han Sen said. She coldly looked at him and said, “Leave now or I will be cruel to you.”

“I have been walking so far. After reaching here, I am so tired that I cannot move. You just walk around for my daughter’s sake. Let me rest here before I move on.” Han Sen sat next to the campfire.

Tian Jing wanted to say something, but Bao’er tugged at her sleeve and said, “Big Sister, let Dad rest here for a little.”

Tian Jing looked at Han Sen and said, “Fine. For Bao’er’s sake, I will let you stay.” “Thank you.” Han Sen sat down next to the campfire. He looked around and said, “What a coincidence. I did not expect to see you guys here.”

Tian Jing looked cold as she asked, “What are you doing here?” Han Sen was an evil land pulse master to her, so she would not dare be nice to him.

“I am looking for a land pulse,” Han Sen said with a greedy look. “I have heard there is a super land pulse around.”

Han Sen was planning on following Tian Jing and the others to locate the land pulse, but then he met that person in the jade carriage. That encounter led him to think something was amiss.

From what he had observed, the jade carriage was obviously following Tian Jing and the others. It was doing the same thing as Han Sen. To be able to find where Tian Jing and the others were, the employed method would have had to be the same as how Han Sen tracked them. There was a mole next to Tian Jing.

Aside from Bao’er, there was only Zhen Xia. There was no need to guess which of them was a traitor.

So, Han Sen decided to catch up to them in a hurry. He was not worried about Tian Jing and Zhen Xia, the two of them, but the person in the jade carriage was different. If he was late, the people in the jade carriage would nab the gene egg for themselves first.

Tian Jing looked at Han Sen but did not say anything. She thought Han Sen must have followed them on purpose. If Han Sen was following them on purpose, why would he expose himself so soon without them having discovered a land pulse?”

The ice fields were very big. If Han Sen had not been following them, to suggest it was a chance encounter was an incredibly slim one. It was extremely hard to believe.

“Lady, I heard that you are a student of Xuan Mi Zong,” Han Sen said as he continued warm up by the fire. “I wonder what Xuan Mi Zong’s relation to the Chu Kingdom is.”

“The six kingdom nobles and the king really respect Wu Wei Dao Palace,” Tian Jing said. “The Chu Kingdom does too.”

“In that case, might there be a student of the Chu Kingdom in Xuan Mi Zong?” Han Sen asked.

“Of course, there are. Wu Wei Dao Palace is comprised of people from six kingdoms.” Tian Jing displayed a frown and asked, “What are you trying to say?” In fact, Han Sen was very eager to talk about this. His meaning was obvious, but Tian Jing did not think of things that way. She did not understand what he meant.

Han Sen had to spell it out. “If Xuan Mi Zong has students of the Chu Kingdom, and this is a place that belongs to the Chu Kingdom, you should find a student that belongs to the Chu Kingdom. Having someone to guide is better than running around aimlessly. Oh, I just remembered! There was a guy with you. Is that guy someone from the Chu Kingdom?”

“He is not from the Chu Kingdom.” No matter how stupid Tian Jing was, she knew what Han Sen was implying. She was stupid and never suspected Zhen Xia.

As for Han Sen, who was an unknown and evil land pulse master, she would sooner trust someone like Zhen Xia than him. Anyone would have preferred to trust the people around them than the strangers that cropped up like Han Sen.

“Who are you?” Tian Jing asked Han Sen. She was getting suspicious about his identity.

“I am just a man in search of land pulses.” Han Sen could see that Tian Jing understood what he meant. He stopped talking. He went to sleep near the campfire.

Tian Jing wanted to say something, but she heard footsteps sound from outside the cave. This time, it was Zhen Xia coming back.

Zhen Xia was holding a little beast. It was unknown what kind of gene race it was. He wanted to say something to Tian Jing, but he saw Han Sen sleeping next to the campfire. He frowned and asked, “Why is he here?”

Tian Jing looked at Han Sen and hesitated. She said, “He found us here by chance. We can let him rest here for a spell.” Zhen Xia looked at Han Sen with a bit of worry. He walked up to Tian Jing and said, “This person is unknown to us. Meeting us here again is a bit too much of a coincidence, don’t you think?”

“I agree. This person is strange.” Tian Jing nodded. “But that is fine. If he has any evil schemes to execute, he will not be able to do a thing before our combined might.”

“Right.” Zhen Xia thought. He put the washed little beast atop the fire to cook. He kept looking at Han Sen.

Tian Jing was thinking too. “If that guy really does have some conspiracy, he would not expose himself this soon. He showed up now and said what he did. Did he do that to split up me and Zhen Xia? Is he really warning me that there is something amiss with Zhen Xia?”

“Sister, the meat is good. This piece is nice. You should try it first.” Zhen Xia gave Tian Jing a slab of cooked meat.

“Sister, is the meat cooked well? I am hungry.” Bao’er rubbed her eyes. She was attracted by the presence of the meat. She woke up from her sleep.

“It is done. You should eat this first.” Tian Jing gave the piece of meat she took to Bao’er.

Bao’er was fine with it. She accepted the meat and started to scoff it down. She was hungry. “Slow down. Do not choke. There is still more to come.” Tian Jing stroked Bao’er’s head as she spoke.

“Is there meat? Can I have a little? It has been so long since I ate anything.” Han Sen got up and looked at the meat as he spoke.

“If you want food, then go out and hunt it yourself,” Tian Jing coldly said. “We have no food prepared for others.”

“Lady, you are my daughter’s teacher. For Bao’er’s sake, give me something to eat. This is a cold place. All the gene races are in hiding. Where am I going to find prey this big?” Han Sen looked bitter as he spoke.

Upon hearing Han Sen’s words, Tian Jing felt her heart jump. She thought, “He is right. On this cold day, not even gene races would emerge from their caves. Where did Brother Zhen find this prey?”

Seeing Zhen Xia look totally normal, Tian Jing thought she was letting her imagination run away with her. After all, finding a beast nest was still possible.

“Let him eat something,” Tian Jing said to Zhen Xia after thinking for a moment.

Zhen Xia nodded. He cut off a leg and gave it to Han Sen, saying, “For Bao’er’s sake. Consider yourself lucky.”

Zhen Xia’s face did not change, but he did look a bit murderous.
