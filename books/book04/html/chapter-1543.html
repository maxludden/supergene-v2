    <p>
      The tunnel had the same width as an air raid shelter. It was wide enough
      for a car to pass through, but that was about it. Every one mile, a beam
      of sunlight would bathe a portion of the tunnel from above. It made the
      place seem longer than it actually was, and it felt extremely weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each checkpoint of light, the pressure permeating the atmosphere of
      the tunnel increased. The gemstone class creatures that were the heirs of
      super creatures could only make it through fourteen of those checkpoints.
      They were unable to go any further than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking down the tunnel from a distance, the pools of light looked like
      the illumination of street lamps, all the way down. There were nineteen of
      them in total.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until now, no one had been able to figure out what lay at the end of
      the Godlight Tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the creatures that leveled up to super while inside the tunnel were
      unable to reach the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lion King followed along and said with a smile, “We met each other
      on the field of battle. Let’s encounter one-another again sometime. I am
      Little Jade Lion King of Lion Mountain. What is your name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen. I’m human,” Han Sen answered. He still wasn’t fond of Little
      Jade Lion King, but it wasn’t as if he hated the lion’s guts. He wasn’t
      entirely against having a conversation with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen and Little Lion King spoke, Yu Miao stared at them coldly. She
      despised Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they were having their discussion, someone else entered Godlight
      Tunnel. Han Sen thought it was just some creature or spirit, but it was in
      fact Six Paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao’s heart jumped when she saw Six Paths. Six Paths Emperor wouldn’t
      hand over a geno core, and if Han Sen had any form of conflict with the
      spirit, she believed Six Paths would kill him with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao, who was going to continue following, stopped where she was for a
      spell. She waited for Six Paths to catch up and see if a conflict between
      the two would break out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sister, Six Paths Emperor is here. I’m not sure Han Sen knows who he is.
      If he doesn’t, given Six Paths’ personality, a fight is sure to break
      out.” Yu Xuan told Yu Miao giddily, in hushed excitement. He was thinking
      along the same lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths soon approached Han Sen, and crushing the expectations set by Yu
      Miao and Yu Xuan, Six Paths spoke to the human like an old friend. He
      asked, “Why are you here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m in God’s Ruin. How could I not spare the time to visit the Godlight
      Tunnel?” Han Sen smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths nodded and said, “Good timing, then. Now we can compete and see
      which of us can walk the farthest in this Godlight Tunnel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao and Yu Xuan wore strange expressions. They hadn’t expected Han Sen
      to be personally acquainted with Six Paths Emperor. And again, knowing Six
      Paths personality to be what it was, it was perplexing to see him address
      Han Sen as if he was addressing an equal. They were flat-out shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion King, seeing Han Sen talk to Six Paths Emperor like his
      buddy, had an even greater admiration for the human. He thought to
      himself, “It’s no wonder he is so strong. To kill Goddess as he pleases,
      he must indeed be quite the character. Before Six Paths Emperor
      self-destructed, he was more famous than my father. If Han Sen can talk to
      him like a friend, then Han Sen really must be strong.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths wasn’t an avid talker, though, and after a few brief verbal
      exchanges, he went ahead and focused on getting deeper into the Godlight
      Tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen, Queen, Tang Zhenliu, and Little Lion King followed.</p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was in Han Sen’s arms, and Starsea Beast was following behind Han
      Sen. Little Silver was on the big creature’s head, staring at the light up
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light sources above were like small suns, and they managed to light up
      the tunnel rather well. The first curtain of light fell on Han Sen,
      draping him with what felt like water. The light was tangible.
    </p>
    <p>But the feeling was not heavy, and it did not feel burdening.</p>
    <p>
      Everyone walked through the first curtain of light with ease. But after
      passing through the light, the gravity felt much heavier. Still, it did
      not slow them down or affect their passage too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continued walking until they reached the fifth curtain of light.
      There, Tang Zhenliu could not take the pressure of what came next. His
      entire body was wet with sweat, and it felt as if he was carrying the
      whole weight of a mountain. It took a lot of effort just to make one step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, he only had a bronze geno core. His fitness and geno core level
      were still very weak, so it was fairly impressive he had managed to make
      it that far.
    </p>
    <p>“Can you still go on?” Han Sen asked Tang Zhenliu.</p>
    <p>
      “It’s okay. I can keep going. I must make it to the sixth, at least.” Tang
      Zhenliu gritted his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t say anything. He just walked by Tang Zhenliu’s side. The
      pressure there was of no bother to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu could see everyone else walking forward freely, and he even
      saw Little Silver lying on Starsea Beast’s head in a relaxed posture as if
      there wasn’t a single ounce of additional atmospheric pressure. He sighed
      and thought to himself, “Han Sen’s companions are so scary. How long will
      it take me to catch up to his level?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu did not want to give up, and onwards he continued. He
      eventually ended up far behind the others, as his pace was extremely slow.
      His muscles tightened, as if they were going to tear through his clothes
      at any given moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t make it obvious that he was deliberately watching the man
      struggle as he was, but he did keep an eye on how he was doing. If it was
      becoming too much, and Tang Zhenliu could no longer stay upright against
      the gravity, Han Sen would take him out of the tunnel before he collapsed
      and died there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprisingly, as hard it was for him, he managed to hold on strong. And
      when he almost reached the sixth light, his very bones began to creak. His
      entire skeleton sounded as if it was going to break.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      When Tang Zhenliu stepped into the wash of the sixth light, his entire
      body glowed with the color silver. It looked as if his geno core had
      managed to reach silver class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao and Little Lion King looked at him. Although it was not a rare
      thing to level up in the Godlight Tunnel, simply being able to meant he
      was talented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu was tired, so he sat down and stopped moving forward. His
      geno core leveled up, but his body didn’t. His body could not take any
      more pressure, either. He couldn’t walk an inch further.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t walk. You guys go ahead and I’ll wait here.” Tang Zhenliu spoke
      in between deep gasps.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen nodded as he went on alongside Queen.</p>
    <p>
      When they reached the ninth curtain of light, it was Queen’s turn to have
      difficulty. And when she reached the tenth curtain of light, Queen’s body
      began to slow and her geno core leveled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Godlight Tunnel gives the opportunity to level up a geno core, but the
      other creatures and spirits don’t show any changes. Tang Zhenliu and Queen
      both leveled up. Is this just coincidental, or is there a reason for
      this?” Han Sen wondered.
