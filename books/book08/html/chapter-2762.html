<h2>Dead Yesterday, Alive Today</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2762</h3>

<p>Ancient Devil gave Han Sen a predatory grin. “Haven’t you heard
about dying and then being reborn? If you don’t die, how are you
supposed to dodge Super Space Slash?”</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard of rebirth before, but he didn’t know what it
had to do with Super Space Slash. He wanted to find a way to
counter Super Space Slash because he wanted to live. What was the
point of killing himself?</p>
<p>Ancient Devil pointed at Han Sen and said, “Before, we all swore
to die like it was yesterday. And after, swore to live like today.
Today, you are still alive. Then, what is the difference if you
were to die yesterday?”</p>
<p>As he listened to Ancient Devil, Han Sen felt like he was lost
in an impenetrable fog. He had no idea what Ancient Devil was
talking about, but he knew that continuing to ask wouldn’t improve
the situation. Unless he agreed to let Ancient Devil go, of course.
Otherwise, Ancient Devil would continue to avoid reaching the crux
of the matter and explaining what was required to break Super Space
Slash. Although in truth, the hints that Han Sen had received thus
far weren’t all that bad.</p>
<p>After leaving Destiny’s Tower, Han Sen thought about what
Ancient Devil had said to him. He still couldn’t understand what
the man was saying.</p>
<p>“Suicide… and dying yesterday… Being alive today… What is
Ancient Devil trying to tell me?” Han Sen spent a long time
thinking the matter over, but he couldn’t quite figure it out. It
felt like the concept was just beyond reach.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an invisible shockwave rolled through the air. Two
shadows emerged from a quickly-gathering mist, and they landed on
the plaza of the palace.</p>
<p>“Exquisite and Li Keer are finally here!” Han Sen exulted, once
he looked closer to confirm that it was them. Ever since he had
been locked up in this bottle world, he hadn’t seen hide nor hair
of Li Keer or Exquisite.</p>
<p>As both of them walked before him now, Han Sen didn’t say
anything. He knew Exquisite and Li Keer were only youngsters among
the Very High. They wouldn’t be allowed to make any important
decisions. Even if they wanted to free Han Sen, they didn’t have
the authority.</p>
<p>“The scales across your body are gone!” Li Keer gasped, looking
Han Sen over.</p>
<p>“Yes. I don’t know why, but the scales just vanished. Can you
ask the leader if I can leave now?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer looked at each other. It was as if they
wanted to tell him something, but they were hesitant to actually
say it. In the end, Exquisite ended up saying, “The leader still
wants you to stay in the bottle.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean he’s going to keep me bottled up in here
forever?” Han Sen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Li Keer assured him. “We will try our best to
show everyone that you aren’t a threat. We will try to get your
freedom back as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“My body no longer possesses the scales. Doesn’t that help erase
any suspicions they have about me?” Han Sen pointed out, but his
voice didn’t sound particularly hopeful.</p>
<p>Exquisite sighed. “If the scales had been removed by my people,
of course, they wouldn’t remain suspect. But now it seems that the
scales have simply disappeared by themselves. I’m afraid the leader
and the elders won’t believe that the scales just vanished of their
own accord and went away for good.”</p>
<p>“That means I’m still to be trapped here?” Han Sen’s mind had
become placid once again. He didn’t expect the Very High to let him
go. He would have to escape using his own power.</p>
<p>Li Keer tried to provide comfort by saying, “We will try to help
you in any way we can. You just need to hold out a little longer,
okay?”</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t a rookie who had only just started adventuring.
He knew these were just words of comfort that wouldn’t lead to any
real changes in his situation.</p>
<p>“If I can’t leave this place, can you bring me some books so
that I’m not completely bored?” Han Sen asked flatly.</p>
<p>“What kind of books would you like to read? In a situation like
this, I don’t think our people will let you read any kind of geno
art,” Li Keer said, as straight as an arrow. She was often like
that, telling Han Sen what he needed to know.</p>
<p>“No geno arts. I just want some books about philosophy and
theology. Something about life and death would be best.” Han Sen
was hoping that these books might give him inspiration, perhaps
revealing what Ancient Devil meant when he spoke of suicide.</p>
<p>“Let me find a way. We will try and get these books for you,” Li
Keer answered.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re our silkworm. This is what we should be doing…” Li Keer
trailed off halfway and fell silent. Han Sen’s situation now was
different. He wasn’t really their silkworm anymore.</p>
<p>But Han Sen seemed to be doing better than they had expected.
The way he casually spoke with them, he didn’t sound as if he was
going to be locked up forever.</p>
<p>Before they left, Exquisite told Han Sen, “I will tell the
leader that the scales have disappeared. They will most likely send
someone to examine your condition. But I don’t think there is a
high chance of you leaving. So, do not put too much hope in getting
out soon.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” Han Sen said with a nod. He knew Exquisite had
no authority in this matter, so the final say-so wasn’t her
decision to make.</p>
<p>Not long after they left, a Very High true god elite appeared
before Han Sen. He checked Han Sen out and asked Han Sen some
questions. Han Sen had already composed his answers a long time
ago, so when he was asked what had happened, he had a story ready
to go. The explanation wasn’t entirely perfect because Han Sen kept
trying to avoid talking about certain things. The Very High elder
couldn’t tell what was going on.</p>
<p>After the Very High elder left, no one came to see him for a few
days. Han Sen spent the entire time practicing the Sit and Forget
Sutra. Time passed rather easily.</p>
<p>“It has been a while since I saw Yanran and Ling’er. I wonder if
Ling’er has grown up yet. And I wonder what is going on with
Littleflower. Mom and Dad said they wanted to spend some time
traveling. I wonder if they have come back yet…” Sometimes, Han Sen
would get distracted as he thought about how much he missed his
family.</p>
<p>“The Sit and Forget Sutra is completely different from Under the
Sky. One of them is about entering the world, and the other is
about exiting the world. Combining them will be hard. And I have
never practiced Very High Sense before, so I have to use Under the
Sky as a base. If I start from the beginning with my practice, I
don’t know how long it will take for me to learn the Sit and Forget
Sutra.” Han Sen had no way of accurately predicting when he would
elevate the new skill to a usable level.</p>
<p>The Sit and Forget Sutra and Under the Sky were similar in
structure, but according to the theory, they operated on different
wavelengths. They were practically polar opposites. Even though he
had managed to obtain the alpha’s experience and mind, he couldn’t
combine the two techniques.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was stewing in his own frustration, a shadow
appeared through the mist surrounding the palace. It was an old
Very High man Han Sen wasn’t familiar with.</p>
<p>The old man didn’t speak. He only tossed something at Han Sen,
then turned around and left.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised an eyebrow, having no clue what the old man had
just done. He picked up the item and looked it over. It was a mini
laptop, about the size of a person’s hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned on the computer. He couldn’t connect to the
internet, but there were many ebooks inside it.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen understood. This was probably Li Keer and
Exquisite’s delivery.</p>
<p>Han Sen browsed quickly through the titles, and he realized that
ebooks really were the only things that the computer contained.
Most of the books were about philosophy and theology. There wasn’t
anything about geno arts, at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t really expected to find a geno art, anyway. He
flicked through the books. With how much his brain had evolved, it
was an easy task for him to memorize the exact contents of a book
with a million words. He could recall the content perfectly,
without forgetting a single word. Understanding it, however, was
something else entirely.</p>
<p>“Flush Real Sutra.” Han Sen jerked when he saw the title of one
of the books.</p>
