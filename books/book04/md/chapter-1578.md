  “Correct, that’s the Sacred egg. However, its shell is too solid. We’ve tried everything we could think of, but nothing could break the eggshell. We then resorted to using the water from the black pond to erode the shell of the Sacred egg. You came here at the right time. After another forty or fifty hours, the eggshell will be completely eroded, after which we can enjoy this Sacred egg,” said the Destroyer Wolf.

The Rolling Dragon just stared at Han Sen coldly, like a sculpture made of iron. Han Sen wasn’t sure if it was because it couldn’t understand the human language, or because it didn’t want to talk to him.

Han Sen saw that neither the Destroyer Wolf nor the Rolling Dragon intended to attack him, which surprised him a little bit.

Han Sen thought the Destroyer Wolf just wanted to make sure nobody was around before it attacked him, yet the Destroyer Wolf didn’t seem to have any intention of striking him. It seemed that it had made up its mind to share the Sacred egg.

Han Sen was still cautious as he wasn’t sure what the Destroyer Wolf wanted. He kept his distance from the Destroyer Wolf and the Rolling Dragon, and he also kept an eye on the Sacred egg, waiting for it to be completely eroded.

Though it was called a Sacred egg, there wasn’t any special about its appearance. It looked like an ordinary egg at an extra size. It was hard to imagine that a great being like the Destroyer Wolf couldn’t break the eggshell.

The water was flowing, and the Sacred egg was floating on it. Han Sen looked at it carefully, and he found that there were many tiny black engravings on the shell. It seemed that the water from the black pond was sipping in.



“How should I call you, friend?” The Destroyer Wolf didn’t want to get close to Han Sen either. Instead, it watched Han Sen from a distance, smiling.

“Han Sen,” answered Han Sen.

“You’re so powerful, so you must come from somewhere famous. What haven’t I heard of you before?” asked the Destroyer Wolf again.

“Nowhere famous. I was just lucky enough to obtain some powerful geno cores and beast souls,” said Han Sen.

The more Han Sen spoke, the less the Destroyer Wolf dared to look down upon him. It kept talking with Han Sen, but it didn’t show any sign of attacking him. It seemed that it was actually waiting for the eggshell to break so that it could share it with Han Sen.

“Is that eggshell really so solid that even you can’t break it?” Han Sen asked again, as he still found it unbelievable.

Based on the rules in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, even the descendant of a berserk super creature was only at bronze level when it was just born.

The Destroyer Wolf laid down beside the black pond and smiled. “If I were really able to break it, I wouldn’t have run around carrying it and being hunted by so many powerful creatures.”

The Destroyer Wolf paused and laughed. “The master of Sacred spent so much effort gaining the confidence of the Destroyer Empress and convincing her to birth his child. He’s spent lots of time and effort on that egg, so it should be special.”

Han Sen took a look at that Sacred egg, yet he still couldn’t see anything special about it. Even more confusing, Han Sen still couldn’t find any trace of the creature he had previously been looking for.

If that creature was just some food that the Destroyer Wolf and the Rolling Dragon brought here and ate, Han Sen should still be able to find its scent. Just like the bones left in the cave, all three of them were leaving molecules behind. However, Han Sen didn’t see any remaining molecules of that creature.

Han Sen was afraid that the molecules in the cave were too chaotic for him to check carefully. He rechecked them several times, but he still couldn’t find any trace of the creature that he had noticed before.

“Maybe that creature didn’t get into the lake? Then where is it?” Han Sen was frowning as he thought, but he couldn’t figure anything out.

The Destroyer Wolf sometimes talked with Han Sen, and it was gentle and looked harmless.

On the contrary, the Rolling Dragon didn’t say a word. It just lay beside the black pond, staring at the floating Sacred egg as if that egg was the only thing it could see.

They didn’t show any intention of attacking Han Sen, which confused him.

Bao’er sometimes looked at the Sacred egg as if it were some kind of new toy.

Time passed, and more and more black fissures appeared on the eggshell. Just as the Destroyer Wolf said, the eggshell seemed to be almost completely eroded.

Kacha!

After more than fifty hours of waiting, Han Sen, Destroyer Wolf, and the Rolling Dragon heard a blast that sounded like an eggshell cracking after being boiled.

A black crack appeared on the white eggshell.

“It’s done!” The Destroyer Wolf was exhilarated, and the Rolling Dragon was even more so. Its tail was carrying the trident, and it immediately threw the trident toward the egg.

The egg was already covered with small cracks, and Han Sen thought that the trident of the Rolling Dragon would pierce through the egg completely. However, when the tip of the trident hit one of the cracks, there were only some sparks on the egg, and the egg was perfectly safe. The crack wasn’t enlarged at all.

Han Sen was terrified. The Destroyer Wolf had told him how sturdy the Sacred egg was, but he hadn’t believed it until now.

He had experienced the trident’s power, and it was definitely at the top-tier level in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. Despite that, it couldn’t injure the shell at all.

The Destroyer Wolf licked its lips, and it stopped the Rolling Dragon from striking again. It gazed at the sacred egg and said, “Guess I need to wait longer. We’ve waited for a long time, so there’s no need to rush it.”

The Rolling Dragon retreated back to the original spot and laid down. Han Sen stared at the Sacred egg, but something still seemed strange to him. There wasn’t anything living in the Sacred egg. After the eggshell cracked, Han Sen finally managed to detect some energy coming from the egg.

However, it wasn’t a lifeforce coming from the egg, but a force that resembled death.

“Why does this power feel like death? Does this Sacred egg have the power of a dead spirit? That shouldn’t be right. I’ve seen the power of Goddess, and her power feels nothing like this. If they’re both descendants of Sacred’s master, they shouldn’t be so different,” Han Sen thought.

As Han Sen was thinking, he frowned and turned his attention to a corner of the cave. There were some familiar molecules floating there: the same molecules he saw on the shore.

“Strange! I’ve checked the cave several times already, yet I couldn’t find any of the molecules of that creature. Why have some showed up here now?” Han Sen frowned worriedly.
