Han Sen finally understood why he could not even hurt the baby golden growler. They were not even on the same level. Although the golden growler was just born, it obviously had the characteristics of a super creature already.

"The black crystal that I got from that black beetle, could it also be the life essence of some super creature?"

Han Sen thought about it and defeated his own theory.

The black crystal didn't melt like the life essence of the golden growler, otherwise it was so small that it would be gone by now. The black crystal did not change a bit.

Han Sen did not have too much time to think. Holding the life essence, whenever he felt he could eat again, he would suck on the golden crystal until he was stuffed.

Hearing the voice sounding in his mind again and again, Han Sen felt that must be the happiest thing in life. Han Sen thought that his trip was totally worth it at this point.

It took Han Sen more than a week to finish the entire block of life essence, and he got 10 super geno points, which surprised Han Sen.

Originally, Han Sen thought that he must eat the entire super creature as well to get all 10 geno points, which did not seem to be the case. Maybe for super creatures, the geno points were concentrated in the life essence it carried.

In fact, Han Sen went back to the basin, trying to eat some of the golden growler's meat. However, he soon discovered that since he could not even hurt the baby golden growler, he had no way to consume the body of the giant lion.

Although he felt disheartened, Han Sen did not have any good methods. He had to comfort himself that maybe the meat of the golden growler would do nothing.

"I wonder how humans were able to kill the first sacred-blood creature." Han Sen was pondering, but had no conclusions. In God's Sanctuary, there was no Skynet for him to consult.

He hesitated and flew away from the island. Since he could not kill the baby golden growler, he should not stay there anymore. As the golden growler grew faster and faster, he might end up getting killed by it.

Luckily, Han Sen had sacred-blood wings. Otherwise, he would not even be able to cross the ocean.

With his experience following the golden growler, Han Sen learned how big and complicated the God's Sanctuary was. Now he was taking extra care wherever he went.

Han Sen thought that his trip over the ocean might be highly risky. After all, he could no longer tell the directions on the ocean and there were plenty of marine beasts. Although those beasts could not reach him in the sky, the sacred-blood birds might endanger him.

Maybe it was luck. Han Sen flew for two days without running into any danger, and also killed a mutant fish, whose meat contributed two more mutant geno points. At this point, Han Sen had 86 mutant Geno points.

More fortunately, Han Sen even saw an island and a large modern ship next to it.

Although there were no visible electronic equipment, Han Sen could still tell from the material of the ship that it was a high-tech product. It even had the inscription "Moon Goddess" on it.

However, the ship seemed to be gravely damaged and weathered. It must have been here for a long time.

That did not matter to Han Sen. Since there was a ship on the island, there must be people too. Maybe there was even a shelter on the island, which would be fantastic. That way, Han Sen could use the teleport system to go back to school.

He had been in God's Sanctuary for several months and never sent any message back. He must have already missed the semiannual assessment. He was not that worried about the assessment, but he knew that Ji Yanran must have been worried sick.

When Han Sen came close, he no longer felt good about it. The island was neither big nor small. Han Sen could see the entire island from the sky, but he did not notice any buildings.

Landing on the island, Han Sen took back on his beast souls and was ready to find somewhere to have a rest. Suddenly, he saw a person walking out from the jungle.

Seeing Han Sen, that person paused, waved to Han Sen and ran over.

The existence of human beings made Han Sen felt better about the place. He believed this meant the place was not too far away from a civilized location.

Although humans could teleport the parts of ships and piece them together in God's Sanctuary, no ship had modern energy system since no technologies could be used here, which was why all the ships could only sail in a small range. In addition, the ocean was a more dangerous place than the land in God's Sanctuary, so no one dared to go too far with a ship.

Normally speaking, ships were used to go to the surrounding areas and hunt weak marine creatures.

Han Sen regarded the person, who was a 20-year-old young woman wearing a blue beast soul armor. She looked at Han Sen excitedly.

"Are you from Green Island?" The young woman asked with a trembling voice.

"I'm sorry. I don't know where Green Island is." Han Sen shook his head and wanted to ask the woman where he was.

At this time, a few more persons ran from the jungle nearby. They were all about the same age as the woman.

They were equally excited when seeing Han Sen. Everyone was asking Han Sen all kinds of questions. But the most frequent one was the woman's questionâ€”"Are you from Green Island?"

"I am sorry. I am not from Green Island. I came from Steel Armor Shelter, suffered a ship wreck and ended up here. May I ask where I am?"

Hearing Han Sen's reply, these people suddenly became extremely disappointed.
