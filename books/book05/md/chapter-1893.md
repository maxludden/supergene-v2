  Dragon Lady followed Han Sen into the base. Wang Yuhang and Xie Qing King then took up positions on opposite sides of the gate. They were like two soldiers, just smiling at the intruders.

“Brother King, what is your least favorite meal?” Wang Yuhang, standing at the side of the gate, suddenly decided to ask.

“Hmm, I am not sure. I like pretty much everything I am able to eat. I even like all desserts, such as stinky tofu,” Xie Qing King said.

“Brother King, you really do like to eat everything! But you know what? I know of something that you would not like to eat,” Wang Yuhang said with sincerity.

“What?” Xie Qing King rose to the question.

“A closed gate. Would you like to eat that?” Wang Yuhang asked, laughing to himself.

“I don’t want to eat that. I don’t think anyone would like to.” Xie Qing King smiled.

“Maybe. Maybe not. Some people might love to eat that. And they certainly enjoy it. They can’t get enough of it!” Wang Yuhang smiled, and he looked right at Sad Night.

“What a rude slave.” Sad Night was angered by the jest. He drew his sword and sent a scary swordlight soaring towards Wang Yuhang’s neck.

He could not kill Han Sen, but he did not care about disposing of his slaves.

Dong!

A silver shadow blocked Sad Night’s swordlight. It was a leopard, composed of silver light, from the looks of it.

Sad Night was not quite sure what it was, but he wasn’t afraid. He swung his sword like lightning to do battle with the leopard.

Sad Night’s sword skills were wonderful. It was to be expected; after all, he was the son of a King. His fighting techniques were top-dog.

After a dozen strikes, the silver leopard was slain. The creature vanished into thin air.

“If you keep talking crap, you’ll end up just like that!” Sad Night said, staring right at Wang Yuhang.

“If you like to kill so much, would you like to do a few more?” Xie Qing King moved his fingers to scribble out a few more of those silver leopards. They quickly surrounded Sad Night.

It hadn’t been difficult for Sad Night to take out the silver leopard, but there were so many of them now. They were all Viscounts, and they worked together smoothly to establish a proper formation. It’d be hard, that was for sure.

Speechless and No Flower were shocked by this. The ability to draw beasts was very rare.

Sad Night killed one silver leopard, then found that Xie Qing King had already drawn another to replace it. He kept spawning more and more, as soon as each one died. The numbers didn’t reduce, and the fight looked as if it could go on forever. The leopards were able to get a few hits in every now and again, too. Although none of the wounds were grievous, it sullied his image.

“Come and help!” Seeing Black Cliff and the others merely waiting and watching, Sad Night suddenly felt fear. He couldn’t keep fighting these leopards by himself.

Just as the Rebate looked ready to strike, Xie Qing King closed the book and the leopards disappeared. He coldly said, “Just as I thought; a run-of-the-mill King’s child. Just a bully.”

“You!” Sad Night was so angry, but knew he could not compete. When he was flying solo, he hadn’t been able to take out the leopards. If he was unable to take out the leopards, he’d be unable to take on Xie Qing King.

The Rebate were curious about all this, though. They wondered where Han Sen might have found such a man. In a solo fight, Sad Night would not be able to beat him.

The drawing abilities were rare, too. They had never seen it before.

“You are a bully, too! If you have the guts to do it, fight him mano-a-mano! I guarantee you cannot fight Sad Night solo,” one of the Rebate Barons shouted to Xie Qing King, referring to the fact that there were so many shadow leopards.

“You sure you want to engage me in a solo fight?” Xie Qing King looked at Sad Night with a smile. He didn’t even spare the Baron a glance.

“So what, yeah? But do you dare to come at me?” Sad Night knew it sounded ridiculous as soon as he said it. He was not too happy about this situation.

“Are you sure? Don’t go crying to daddy when you get beaten up.” Xie Qing King smiled at him.

“I’m afraid you won’t even be able to cry,” Sad Night said coldly.

“Then come on! It’s been a long time since I last had the chance to throw my weight around. The creatures here are so strong, so it’s hard to find someone weak enough to enjoy bullying. Now the opportunity to do just that has come.” Xie Qing King put his book away, and then the silver book became a set of armor to plate him. Then, he stretched his limbs.

Sad Night knew Xie Qing King was mocking him. He looked murderous, and his sword was like the wind as it came to take a bite out of Xie Qing King.

He had a terrible thirst for bloodshed right now. He might not have been able to kill Han Sen, but he could most certainly kill a family member. Even though it would cause him trouble, this was something Night King River could sort out.

As the swordlight flashed toward him, Xie Qing King was still stretching his wrists and rolling his neck.

Pang!

Just as the swordlight was going to strike his nose, Xie Qing King threw a punch. The silver light broke the swordlight.

Xie Qing King’s strong body began to gleam with silver light. He was like a demon, and he began throwing punches towards Sad Night.

“Alu-Alu-Alu!”

A raging bevy of fists was coming at Sad Night like a furious storm. Sad Night knew he wouldn’t be able to fight back, so he blocked it with a sword. He was like a boat in the middle of the rain.

The fists kept striking the sword, shaking it.

A katcha noise sounded. The sword shattered to pieces under the pressure of Xie Qing King’s repeated attacks. The punches eventually landed on Sad Night.

“Argh!” Sad Night was sent soaring through the air with a body that had been totally twisted by the punches. His armor had shattered, even. His gear had been completely destroyed.

Everyone was shocked, and no one had expected that would be the end result. The son of a King had been beaten by a guardsman. He couldn’t resist the flurry of attacks, and he was broken and sent flying.

They found out that Xie Qing King was actually scarier when he put the book away.

A few of the Rebate were shocked. They wished to save Sad Night, and only Black Cliff did not move.

“It looks like you guys love to fight in groups.” Xie Qing King was wearing an evil smile. His silver armor returned to the shape of a book. So, he drew something inside and brought a new shadow to life.

But this time, it wasn’t a leopard that came out. It was Xie Qing King himself.

“Alu-Alu-Alu!” The shadows of Xie Qing King all began punching the Rebate.
