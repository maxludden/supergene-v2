<p>“Old Vulture, what happened outside? Why has the darkness around
the holy palace lessened considerably?” In the darkest corner of
the palace, a beast, which looked completely red had an eye that
resembled a purgatory abyss, looked at the dark sky.</p>
<p>On the roof, a giant beast, which had no eyes, asked, “Is your
eye going funny? How can Sacred be bright?”</p>
<p>A weird, pitch-black bird stared at the darkness and said,
“Things really do look brighter.” It turned and spoke to a pretty
woman. “You old horny woman, do you see what is out there?”</p>
<p>“It is fine for you to call me a horny woman, but I will rip
your head off if you call me old again.” After the pretty woman
said that, she peered into the faraway darkness.</p>
<p>“Weird, things do appear brighter. What is going on?” Auntie Mei
was surprised.</p>
<p>“It can’t be my eye going funny. The darkness around the holy
hall is much weaker. Something must have happened in Sacred. It
must be something huge.” The angry red beast started to move. It
seemed as if he wanted to go outside to take a look at what might
be going on.</p>
<p>“Something big? So, what if it is big? Those God Spirits
wouldn’t come here. What other creature could make changes to
Sacred?” Auntie Mei had a look of disdain. She sighed and said,
“Little Master has been gone for so long. Why has he yet to come
back? Do you think something might have happened to him?”</p>
<p>“You horny woman, don’t you worry,” the eyeless big beast said.
“With Little Master’s power, no creature in the sanctuaries could
do battle with even his littlest finger. They won’t be able to do
anything to hurt him. Plus, Old Cat is following Little Master.
Although that Old Cat is a bit lame and doesn’t do much, he is one
of the four holy beasts. He used to watch over the sanctuaries. He
won’t let anyone or anything bring harm to the Little Master.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, who knows if Old Cat is reliable?” Auntie Mei coldly
asked.</p>
<p>“That is not right. Why is it going so bright over there? I
think I can see a light.” The red beast with an eye was staring
into the darkness.</p>
<p>Old Vulture stared off into the distance too. Inside the
darkness, there was a twinkle of light that was expanding. Although
it was still unable to light up the holy palace and eradicate its
dark, they could see the light.</p>
<p>Auntie Mei looked toward the light and was shocked. “What
happened? That light can shine the darkness around the holy palace.
What happened outside?”</p>
<p>Old Vulture had the best vision among them. While he was
watching, he suddenly screamed. “The Holy Kirin… It is the Holy
Kirin… That is the Holy Kirin’s spirit releasing power.”</p>
<p>“How is that possible? The Holy Kirin’s spirit… Isn’t that
inside the fate monument? Little Master did not go to the fate
monument yet, so how could the Holy Kirin’s spirit appear?” The
red, angry beast let out a strange scream.</p>
<p>“Impossible… Aside from Little Master, no one else should be
able to activate the Holy Kirin’s spirit.” Auntie Mei’s expression
changed.</p>
<p>“Why are we still sitting here talking crap? Let’s just get out
of here. The Little Master’s Holy Kirin spirit cannot be stolen by
someone else.” The red, murderous beast weirdly screamed and flew
into the darkness.</p>
<p>His body touched the darkness, which made some same sounds
mechanical and cogwheel-breaking sounds. The red flames of his body
struck the darkness. Every step he took was like breaking the
world.</p>
<p>“Goddamn barren power…” The red murderous beast kept swearing as
he went. No matter how much he swore, he could only travel through
the dark.</p>
<p>Old Vulture flapped his wings and soared into the dark. It
looked like a sky full of dark clouds. After going into the dark,
there were some thunderous noises. There were lots of sparks around
him as he battled with the dark.</p>
<p>Auntie Mei and the eyeless big beast rushed into the darkness
too. They traveled slowly through the dark. They were in a rush,
but they could not get out of the darkness to reach the shadow of
the Holy Kirin.</p>
<p>Deep Abyss Grandmaster and Sky Palace’s first seat looked at the
Holy Kirin, which was a transparent light. It did not have a
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen also stared at the Holy Kirin. The more he looked at it,
the more afraid he became.</p>
<p>The Holy Kirin was not a xenogeneic right now. The presence of
its body was more like…</p>
<p>“Beast soul!” Han Sen almost screamed. The Holy Kirin looked
like a beast soul and not a xenogeneic.</p>
<p>As the Holy Kirin body’s light grew brighter, the fate
monument’s light became weaker. It was like the power in the fate
monument was going into the Holy Kirin. It made its body more
solid. Although it was not solid yet, it did appear to become more
tangible and alive.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Isn’t the Holy Kirin dead? Its horn became a
statue, and its meat was cooked. How can the beast’s soul still
exist? If the beast soul is a spirit, can the body be gone but the
spirit remain?” Han Sen had many questions flooding his mind.</p>
<p>Wala!</p>
<p>The fate monument lost all of its light. It shattered like a
rotten hunk of wood. It turned into a sky full of dust. The Holy
Kirin was looking very alive, but its body still looked like a
beast soul. It did not become fully solid.</p>
<p>The light on the Holy Kirin started to become dim. The light,
which had been so bright, turned dark. Only the two long, bright
lanterns continued to glow with their limited range of light.</p>
<p>“One of the four holy beasts, the Holy Kirin, is not dead!” An
Extreme King deified elite was utterly flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“No, the Holy Kirin’s situation does not seem to mean it is
alive.” The Deep Abyss Grandmaster stared at the Holy Kirin and
frowned.</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat stared at the Holy Kirin too. He pulled
his hands into his sleeves and flicked. He looked like he wanted to
attack, but he didn’t. He seemed to be afraid.</p>
<p>The Holy Kirin’s eyes looked at Han Sen. It four legs were
moving toward Han Sen. The holy light was on his body. The scene
was exceptionally strange to witness.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “What does it seek to do? Is it because I
activated the fate monument? Does it now want to fight me? Does it
want its Kirin horn back?”</p>
<p>While Han Sen was guessing, the Holy Kirin came before him. It
did not look as if it was doing anything.</p>
<p>The Holy Kirin stopped very close to Han Sen. It was so close
that it made Han Sen wish to retreat, but the Holy Kirin suddenly
and quietly moaned to Han Sen. It lowered its head and placed its
head in front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen looked at the Holy Kirin, which
was lowering its head. He had no idea what the Holy Kirin
wanted.</p>
<p>The Holy Kirin saw that Han Sen was not doing anything, so it
moaned again. It then put its head closer to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen finally understood something. He reached out his hand
and touched the Holy Kirin’s head.</p>
