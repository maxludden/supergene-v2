<p>“We need to find a way to exit this Heaven. We might have
escaped for now, but there’s still a chance we might be found by
Seven Spirit,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“If you do not know how to get out of here, then you should know
that I don’t, either,” Hai’er said. She thought for a moment.
“Can’t you turn invisible? If we stay invisible, then Seven
Spirit’s clones won’t be able to find us, will they?”</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “There are limitations to remaining
invisible, as I cannot keep it up for long.”</p>
<p>Little Invisible could make Han Sen invisible, but Han Sen was
carrying another person. It would be too much for him to handle.
The creature was still just a baby. And after the amount of time
they had spent invisible earlier, all its energy had been
drained.</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do, then?” Hai’er was standing atop a dune.
She scanned the desert, afraid their nemesis would return.</p>
<p>“Don’t stand there,” Han Sen told her, motioning her down from
the top of the dune. Then, he said, “I thought you were of the
Pirate. You might just be Viscount, but you should be able to stay
alive, right?”</p>
<p>“Normally, of course. Even if there was a Duke on our heels, I
could stay alive. But this is Seven Spirit, so I can’t be entirely
sure.” Hai’er gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>“If it was just one clone, do you think you could make it out?”
Han Sen asked, after some thought.</p>
<p>“If there was just one, then I guess I could. But my method can
only protect me.” Hai’er looked glum, saying that.</p>
<p>“That is enough. I will go to Seven Spirit’s true self. His
clones will be coming for me, but that will allow you to go back
the way you came and leave. If Seven Spirit does not recall his
clones, though, then you’ll be on your own,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked at Han Sen and said, “Why are you helping me?”</p>
<p>Hai’er hailed from the Pirate. She found it hard to believe a
stranger would help her formulate a plan of escape at his own
expense.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “No matter what reason he has for
trying to kill me, he waited until only the two of us remained.
That means he doesn’t want others to know what he wants to do. If
you make it out, perhaps he’ll give up on the idea of killing me.
And if he doesn’t give up, at least you can spread the news of what
actually happened. You could inform Knife Queen. If you can’t, I’ll
die for nothing. Vengeance won’t be sought.”</p>
<p>Han Sen paused, then went on to say, “Seven Spirit is coming
after me. I cannot escape, and this is the only gambit we have
available.”</p>
<p>Hai’er looked at Han Sen for a while, and then spoke. “If I can
make it out, I will inform Knife Queen.”</p>
<p>“It’s a deal, then. You walk east, and I’ll go west.” Han Sen
looked at the time, and then continued. “He should be on his way
back by now. Go on, and good luck.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stood up and ran to the west. Although Hai’er was
worried, she knew if she went along with Han Sen, she might very
well die. So, she went east.</p>
<p>Hai’er did not dare run too quickly, though. She was afraid Han
Sen might use her as bait, so just in case, she went slowly.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was going west, Seven Spirit should bump into him
first whenever he turned back. When that occurred, she would have
her chance to escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not that graceful, though. He walked west, looking
around as he went.</p>
<p>Because he had been in that place for a while, and the music
affected people a lot, it was fortunate Han Sen’s will was as
strong as it was. It didn’t affect him as it did the others.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen stopped walking. He looked around and
buried himself inside one of the dunes. Once inside the sand, he
cast Petrify to turn himself into stone. Not even a deified elite
could find him there.</p>
<p>Now, all Han Sen had to do was wait. He was going to wait until
Seven Spirit came past. And when the hound did, he’d emerge.</p>
<p>If Seven Spirit was walking slow, then Hai’er should encounter a
clone. If she did, she’d surely attract Seven Spirit in that
direction. But Han Sen wasn’t certain she’d entice the attention of
Seven Spirit himself. If Seven Spirit found out that Hai’er was
alone, he’d still want to search for Han Sen, more than
anything.</p>
<p>Han Sen reviewed every possible way this situation could unfold,
and he formulated a method for dealing with each circumstance.
Suddenly, though, he felt as if a being had just walked past. He
was buried under the sand, though, and he couldn’t use Dongxuan
Aura to be certain. He couldn’t be sure that it was Seven
Spirit.</p>
<p>The creature was slowly heading east. He had walked past where
Han Sen was hiding, headed on an eastbound trajectory. Han Sen
assumed it had to be Seven Spirit, since who else would walk
backwards when they were this late in the game? Han Sen waited
until the presence went by, hoping to head the opposite direction
after Seven Spirit passed.</p>
<p>But Seven Spirit only walked east for a bit before turning back.
He was searching for something.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do you want to die down where you are? Or do you want
to go out fighting?” Seven Spirit Buddha asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and thought, “Weird. How does he know I’m
here?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was a little worried, but he didn’t move from his
position within the sand dune. If the felon knew where Han Sen was,
it was likely that he’d already have attacked. He wouldn’t bother
talking.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit waited a bit for a response to come, but none came.
He didn’t actually know where Han Sen was. But it seemed as if he
knew Han Sen was somewhere nearby, as he didn’t leave the
approximate region.</p>
<p>“He must have a way to sense my general presence, but he can’t
find me. This is a tough spot to be in,” Han Sen was thinking.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit stopped. He mumbled something, and then the sand
was kicked into turmoil again. The wind whipped into a raging
tornado. Wherever it went, the sand flew everywhere. It dug up a
thousand meters of desert.</p>
<p>“Marquises are stubborn. It must be costing a lot of power for
him to keep searching that way,” Han Sen thought. It also made him
feel disappointment.</p>
<p>Even if he had turned into stone, Seven Spirit would find him if
he dug too deeply into the sand.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not in a rush to move, however. He waited for the
tornado to come. He wasn’t going to move until he was found, in the
hope that Seven Spirit would exhaust most of his energy.</p>
