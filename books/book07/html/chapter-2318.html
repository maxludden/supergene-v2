	<p>Han Sen knew that he had shot himself in the foot. That King guard was aligned with the element of water, but
		that didn’t imply affiliation with cold and yin force powers.</p>

	<p>The fire element was known to restrict the water element, but under the right conditions, they could actually
		make each other more dangerous.</p>

	<p>Like a steam machine: with the aid of fire, water could be turned into high-pressure steam. Then it could apply a
		force of pressure. The guard attacking Han Sen obviously had that skill and power. The lava sea’s temperature
		increased the power of the water AoE, making Han Sen’s situation all the direr.</p>

	<p>The water around Han Sen heated up and turned into high-pressure steam, restricting Han Sen’s body all the more.
		And the heat was growing unbearable. It was like he had been thrown into a super high-pressure cauldron.</p>

	<p>If Han Sen hadn’t been running his powerful Jadeskin geno art, he would have been easily cooked by the King’s
		area-of-effect.</p>

	<p>“These Kings are getting harder and harder to deal with,” Han Sen whined in his heart, but he remained focused on
		the fight, using whatever powers he had at his disposal.</p>

	<p>The fire crow beast soul from the systems of chaos made a fire halo AoE that would give Han Sen fire powers. It
		also increased his resistance to the fire element.</p>

	<p>It was exactly the effect that Han Sen wanted, but regrettably, the beast soul was only Marquise class. The
		effect wasn’t very pronounced, but it made him feel a little bit better.</p>

	<p>He summoned the Metal Doll beast soul next. Although he didn’t know what it was for, he was too desperate to
		worry about it. If it might help, it was being spawned.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had given the Demon Bug King Bai Semas to Han Yan and the others, in case they got into trouble. The
		bird’s nest had been absorbed by the little red bird. Right now, Han Sen had no better defensive alternatives.
	</p>

	<p>The Metal Doll was deployed, and a black halo that resembled teeth marks appeared around Han Sen’s feet. When the
		wheel-like halo spun, Han Sen’s body was covered in black metal.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt as if his power had been given a boost, and his power element was now indestructible. There was a
		certain sharpness to all of his movements. When he swung his weapon, the steam binding him became much easier to
		tear through.</p>

	<p>“Does the Metal Doll halo increase the power and sharpness of the user?” Han Sen didn’t have the time to think it
		through. He gritted his teeth and dove deep into the lava sea.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had no way to return to the surface. He planned to head for the island that resided below the lava and
		see if he could find the group of rock dragons and that blue metal wolf. If he could manipulate them into
		entering the fight, he might have a chance of fighting back.</p>

	<p>Han Sen waved his Thunder God Spike to leave a wake of lightning behind him, but the lightning was useless inside
		that area-of-effect. The King class guard used his power to destroy the attack. It achieved naught.</p>

	<p>Pang! A blow landed on Han Sen’s body. Although the damage wasn’t critical, streams of water were now flowing
		into his body and thumping in his vessels.</p>

	<p>Han Sen cast Spell’s Eternity solidifying power. His blood solidified around the water in his body, prohibiting
		that power from spreading through his body.</p>

	<p>Han Sen incurred a few similar wounds, but they didn’t strike any vital places. The King class guard was shocked.
		Although he hadn’t yet landed a killing blow on Han Sen, he had been making use of a toxic geno art. Anyone who
		was struck by it would be lucky if they were only paralyzed. The poison could be deadly to King class opponents,
		yet a mere Duke was repelling it.</p>

	<p>And Han Sen was still able to fight him. He didn’t look to be affected by the toxins, and that confused the
		guard.</p>

	<p>Han Sen frowned. He was so close to the island now, but he didn’t see any rock dragons.</p>

	<p>As he was thinking, a sense of lightness passed over Han Sen’s body. He dropped out of the lava, entering that
		familiar space below. The King class guard entered right behind him. He saw the lava sky above and the island
		down below. He was shocked at the sight, and he murmured, “What? The center of Planet King Kong has a place like
		this?”</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked over the lake. He couldn’t see the blue metal wolf that was taking a bath anymore, either. And not
		a single rock dragon circled overhead. He felt sick, and he thought to himself, “Why am I so unlucky? None of
		them are here.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen teleported again, drawing closer to the lake. He waved his Thunder God Spike to deflect the King class
		guard’s attack and used his Dongxuan Aura to scan around like mad.</p>

	<p>Suddenly, Han Sen noticed something blue below the surface of the lake. A relieved smile spread over his face.
	</p>

	<p>The blue metal wolf was merely sleeping underwater.</p>

	<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen let himself get hit by one of the guard’s strikes. The blow sent him shooting down
		into the water like an arrow, and he swam straight to the blue metal wolf.</p>

	<p>The King guard followed. Because Planet King Kong had no deified xenogeneics, he didn’t think he had anything to
		be afraid of.</p>

	<p>But when he entered the water, he woke up the sleeping blue metal wolf.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen entered the water, he was careful to hide his presence. He slipped lightly under the surface, like a
		gracefully diving acrobat. Han Sen even tried to suppress the splash to avoid creating a startling movement.</p>

	<p>But the King class guard didn’t care. He brought his AoE with him, blanketing half of the lake. The attack also
		fell over the blue metal wolf.</p>

	<p>The sleeping wolf woke up in a fury. It stood up, its metallic fur standing on end. Then it howled.</p>

	<p>The lake exploded like a freshwater spring as the howl blasted away the water. Han Sen curled up in fetal
		position, holding his weapon in front to protect himself. Even so, the shockwave was strong enough to blast him
		away with the rest of the lake water.</p>

	<p>Luckily, he was still wearing his Galactic Lobster Armor. It was a King class set of armor. If he hadn’t been
		wearing it, the power unleashed by the blue metal wolf would have shattered every bone in his body.</p>

	<p>“What amazing power! What is the level of this blue metal wolf?” Han Sen wondered.</p>

	<p>On the other side, the King guard now looked horrified. He was frozen in the air, unmoving. The blue metal wolf
		was now standing in the dry lakebed, and its blue wolf eyes were peering right at him. The guard felt like he
		was being watched by the Grim Reaper himself, and his nerves were as tight as bowstrings. His body was
		shivering, and the only thing he wanted was to escape.</p>

	<p>But he didn’t dare try. He was sure that, if he turned around, the blue metal wolf would leap after him. The
		beast would chew him up and crunch his bones.</p>

	<p>The lake water rained down softly. The man and the wolf looked at each other, and the King class guard’s forehead
		was covered in sweat.</p>
