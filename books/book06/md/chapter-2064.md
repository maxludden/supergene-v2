  “How is that possible?” Xius was shocked.

She had heard of Dragon Nine before, as his Blood Dragon Light was famous. The concentrated powers Dragon Nine wielded were likely the greatest out of all the Dragons in existence. When Dragon One was a Marquise, not even he was as mighty as Dragon Nine.

This was because Dragon Nine had a Blood Dragon Body. Even other Dragons of a higher rank could not accomplish what he had.

Han Sen could concentrate his powers now, the same as Dragon Nine did. He had learned it over the course of their short fight. It was unbelievable.

Xius wasn’t the only one thinking this. The realization made Dragon One frown. Dragon Seven and Dragon Fifteen were simply dazed, and Dragon Nineteen stared in confusion.

Pang!

The Tusk and the Blood Dragon Light came against each other. The purple mist and the Blood Light broke at the same time.

Dragon Nine looked ill. He roared. His Dragon Lance was thrust forward at Han Sen, with a red light across it taking the shape of a dragon. It was far scarier than the last Blood Dragon Light.

Han Sen did not take a moment’s pause as he pushed back with his Blood Feather Knife. He used Tooth for a Tooth to fight.

The demonic Tusk and the Blood Dragon fought each other in the skies. Purples and reds collided together repeatedly, summoning all sorts of explosions. The xenogeneics that were spectating too close to the battle started to spill blood— they were affected by the shockwaves of that fight. Some of the weaker ones simply exploded, sending showers of blood everywhere.

The mist started to disappear. The giant Blood Dragon Light shattered, but Han Sen’s knife air had not. The purplelooking Tusk was free to assault Dragon Nine, and so it went.

Dragon Nine managed to use his lance to break the Tusk into pieces, but doing so weakened his will. His concentration skills had lost to Han Sen.

Dragon Nine had not really lost the fight yet, but Han Sen had stolen his concentration talent. If it was pure concentration power that mattered, Han Sen was still weaker. Dragon Nine’s power was strong, whereas Han Sen’s power was soft.

When two similar powers came against each other, Dragon Nine’s power was the one to break. When Han Sen’s power was mostly shattered, there were still shards that were solid. That was the benefit of having soft powers.

Things broke when you put too much force on them. The reason why Han Sen had an advantage was because he was a little bit soft.

Now, they were both back to square one. The modified Teeth powers had the same damage output as Dragon Nine’s Dragon Light. Dragon Nine could no longer use his Dragon Light to block Han Sen’s knife power. He couldn’t just keep on attacking.

Teeth power was unleashed from Han Sen’s hand, and it repeatedly came against Dragon Nine’s lance. Two overbearing powers were in the thick of battle, and the shockwaves kept pushing the audience back. If they were touched by a knife air or a lancelight, they’d die in a heartbeat.

Han Sen’s knifeskills were getting stronger, but there was no improvement on Dragon Nine’s side. He had lost his edge of suppression. Dragon Nine was not as good as Han Sen when it came to raw technical skill.

“Impossible! Impossible!” Dragon Nine could not accept what was happening. He had endured a lot to get to where he was with Blood Dragon Light, and yet Han Sen had copied him and become better than him. Seeing it made the Dragons sick.

Dragon Nine spat some Dragon Blood across the Dragon Lance. The Dragon Lance glowed with a Dragon Light. He was using all the power he had to summon an even scarier Blood Dragon Light now, in the hope of ending the fight.

When he raised his lance, before he sent out the Blood Dragon Light, he stopped in the air with his hands trembling.

He could not move.

Invisible knife silks were knotted around his arms, legs, and body. His arms were being restrained by the silks, prohibiting him from moving forward.

Roar! Dragon Nine was angry, and the Blood Dragon protection glowed more brightly. He wanted to break the silks and strike with his lance.

Blood was started to spew everywhere, but the silk was not broken. The strands dug through his armor, sawed through the scales, and cut deep into his flesh. He was bleeding from every part of his body now.

“Brother Nine!” Dragon Fifteen and Dragon Nineteen screamed. They were utterly horrified.

Han Sen drew his knife back, and the silks tightened. He was strangling Dragon Nine, and amidst the pain, he forced him to drop his Blood Dragon Lance.

His grip on the Dragon Lance loosened, and it fell to the ground. The Dragon Light exploded, tearing out a crater which it then fell into.

The knife silks Han Sen had now were different than they had been. After he concentrated his Teeth powers, he learned more about the honeycomb structure concentration. He concentrated the knife silks that were both strong and soft.

Knife silks were not as sharp as Dragon Nine’s Dragon Light, but their toughness was the same. Dragon Nine could not use Dragon Light to break the knife silks.

Roar!

Dragon Nine screamed again. Dragon Light began to erupt like a volcano.

The knife silks broke in the Dragon Light, but they were quickly replaced by fresh strings. They kept him bound, prohibiting all movement.

Katcha!

Han Sen moved the Blood Feather Knife and tightened the silk some more. Dragon Nine’s body looked as if it was tied up by an invisible wire. His form was twisted, and his neck and waist were constricted. His Dragon scales broke, and he bled profusely. The claret spread across the ground.

Countless Dragon xenogeneics and Nobles were left speechless. They could not believe Dragon Nine was losing to his own greatest power.

This was Dragon Nine. Dragon Nine was different from the average Dragon. He was the pride of the Dragon. He had potential. He had talent. He made the Dragon proud.

Now, Han Sen was hanging Dragon Nine like a common thief. No matter how much he roared, his scales and flesh were getting peeled and cut. The Dragon blood was flowing like a river now, and he was going to die soon.

“Enough!” Dragon One waved his hand. An invisible power broke off all the knife silks and carried the injured Dragon Nine back to the carriage.

Dragon Seven caught Dragon Nine, and she quickly started to heal him.

Han Sen knew this was going to happen. Dragon One wouldn’t sit idly by while Dragon Nine was killed.

“You are strong.” Dragon One stepped out of the carriage, and he hovered in the air above the ground. He did not unleash any powers, but it still felt as if he was more supreme than everyone else.

Han Sen clutched his Blood Feather Knife, but he looked up calmly. He did not think he would be let go after killing Dragon Thirteen and engaging in the fights he just had.

“So, you should die,” Dragon One proclaimed. And then, a scary power burst out of him.

Han Sen felt like the whole sky was taken by a giant dragon, and that dragon was looking at him. If the creature opened its mouth, Han Sen would disappear into its maw entirely.

“Dragon One, why are you bullying a young man?” A clear voice came down from the sky. The feeling that he was being watched by a terrifying dragon suddenly vanished
