  Of course, after Second Uncle said that, Evil Lotus flashed by their heads and landed on a mechanical ruin that was not far away.

The xenogeneic was chasing Evil Lotus God. When it saw Second Uncle and the others, it spat out some scary and pink beams of light.

The xenogeneic looked extremely weird. Its body was semi-transparent and pink. It did not look like crystal. It looked more like semi-transparent metal.

Its pink upper body was like a giant pink piranha, and its lower body was wriggling with tentacles like an octopus. It looked very strange.

Seeing the piranha spew out pink beams of light from its flower, Second Uncle activated his time power. It made the pink beam of light slower. Now, everyone had a chance to evade the attack.

Seeing the pink beam of light land on the ground, it cut a deep trench through the hard soil. It was a clean, laser-like cut.

Everybody was shocked. They knew how hard the soil there was, yet the pink light beam had effortlessly cut a 9- to 12-foot-deep trench right through it. Such power was certainly on par with Second Uncle, who was a butterfly.

Second Uncle opened his time area. He made the time around the xenogeneic slow down. He shouted at Meng Lie and the others, "We need to hurry over there!"

The xenogeneic's speed was made a bit slower. Everyone wanted to get there, but they saw the xenogeneic's nine semi-transparent metal tentacles waving. There was a circular thing similar to a sucker on each tentacle. They were lined up across the tentacles.

In the next moment, they saw the suckers on the tentacles generate pink beams of light. Suddenly, lots of pink beams of light were fired out. It was like an entire net of lasers was going to come down and throttle Han Sen and the others.

In the wide radius of those pink beams, even if they were slowed down, they could not be avoided.

"Follow me and break the beams of light!" Second Uncle shouted. The substance chains on his body gathered on a deified treasure longsword. It was wielded to go across the beams of light.

Meng Lie, Bao Qin, Bao Ying, Londo, and the others all used their powers to fight alongside Second Uncle to break the net composed of beams of light.

Boom!

There was a scary explosion of power. The net of light beams was broken, but Second Uncle looked as if he had been hit in the process. The ground near his feet cracked.

Meng Lie and the others were all coughing up blood. Their bodies sunk into the sand.

The net formed from beams of light had been cracked. Unfortunately, they did not have the spare power necessary to run forward. Before they could crawl out of the soil, the xenogeneic was waving its tentacles. Many pink beams of light were coming at them again.

Second Uncle shouted, which shocked the sky. A sword broke through the sky. It was going for the xenogeneic.

Out of all of them, only Second Uncle could deal with that xenogeneic. It was a shame that Second Uncle was only good with time power and not destructive power.

Although he was able to use his time powers to control the xenogeneic and enable the xenogeneic to not attack him, when his longsword struck the xenogeneic's body, it only made a few light marks. It was unable to damage it properly.

Everyone knew that if Second Uncle continued to fight and used all of his power, he could not use his time powers to keep on suppressing the xenogeneic. Once that happened, they were to surely lose.

"You are all lowlife creatures. How dare you try and play tricks in front of me the God! You must have a death wish. You guys were supposed to work for me, a God. I would have let you live, but if you guys want to die, it is not on me." Evil Lotus God looked at Second Uncle with disdain as he spoke.

"Fourth Brother, you guys run!" Second Uncle shouted. "Split up while you do so to see how many of us can escape!"

"Second Brother, let me help you!" Meng Lie was born a very grumpy person. He knew he had only become larva class, and his nine-headed, evil snake weapon had been broken. Even though he could not deal with the xenogeneic, he was not going to just leave. His king body exploded. He was going to fight hard.

"Old Four, we cannot die here together! Someone needs to go back and report to the king! Whoever goes against the Extreme King like this cannot go unanswered! We will have to avenge today's events!" Second Uncle was fighting the xenogeneic while he was shouting.

"It should be you leaving, Second Brother. You have the highest chance of surviving and making it back." Meng Lie said that as he was already rushing out. He was using his xenogeneic spear. It was like an evil dragon going toward the enemy xenogeneic. "Second Brother, I've got this. You go. Go back and tell the king. You must avenge my death."

"You've got this? What have you got this with?" Second Uncle went next to Meng Lie. The time area landed on him at the same time. It made the xenogeneic coming for Meng Lie slow down.

Second Uncle grabbed Meng Lie and threw him to Bao Ying. He said, "You guys take Old Four with you. Remember, before you go back to the Extreme King, you must carry the pottery powder."

"Second Brother..." Meng Lie was struggling and trying to move. He discovered that his body was locked. He shouted, "Second Brother, if you don't come with us, how do the few of us leave the big barren systems? We will die if we stay, and we will die if we leave! Why don't we fight them together?"

Second Uncle wished to say something, but Evil Lotus laughed and said, "You guys do not need to fight. You are all going to die. This place has more than one xenogeneic."

Hearing Evil Lotus say that, Second Uncle's face changed.

Evil Lotus God suddenly screamed at the sky. That scream was like a rumbling thunder that extended beyond hundreds of miles. It made the sounds echo and roll.

"Not long later, the xenogeneics from a few thousand miles will be drawn here. Although they are not as strong as this Cold Light Charm, it is enough to kill you guys." Evil Lotus God coldly laughed.

Second Uncle looked terrible. He forced a smile and said, "Evil Lotus God, you and I have no grudge. Why must you kill us all?"

"It is too late to say that now," Evil Lotus said emotionlessly. "Whoever follows me lives, and whoever goes against me dies. You guys dared to go against me, a God, so you are all going to die."

Everyone's face looked panicked. Although they did not see any xenogeneics, they heard some scary beast noises roaring. They were coming for them. Clearly, many scary xenogeneics were approaching.

Second Uncle laughed and said, "Fourth Brother, it looks like today the brothers need to kill."

After speaking, Second Uncle unbound the restrictions he had placed on Meng Lie. He knew they were going to die there.

"Second Brother, it is just you and me. We will kill them until we fall." Meng Lie raised his spear and jumped.

"Uncles, let me help you guys as well." Han Sen knew this was a life-and-death moment. He stopped hesitating and summoned his Sky Star Wolf beast soul. He was also holding his Ying Head Ghost beast soul, which was a skull. He confidently went forward.

Second Uncle did not think Han Sen could help, but he knew they were going to die in this fight sooner or later. So, he did not stop Han Sen.
