<p>Xius and the Dragon lady did not lower their voices, so Han Sen could hear everything they said clearly.</p>

<p>“Trying to take me as a mount? How dare you! Even if I was willing to, wouldn’t you need legs?” Han Sen wondered how he might get out of this particular predicament.</p>

<p>The Dragon lady looked as if she was Marquise class. The rest of the crew looked to be no less than Dukes. With a battleship at their disposal, making an escape did not seem like a viable option.</p>

<p>The main problem, however, was that if Han Sen exposed himself, the entire Return Ruin Sea would be going after him. The exit would be heavily guarded from that point on, and running would become impossible.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t expose myself,” Han Sen kept thinking, as he tried to finish off the rocky shark.</p>

<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Rock Shark: xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Rock Shark beast soul.”</p>

<p>Han Sen ripped apart the Rock Shark’s body and bit into a bone that was the xenogeneic gene. He acted like nothing had happened and started to casually swim off.</p>

<p>Xius wasn’t going to let Han Sen get away, though. She moved her snake tail and blocked Han Sen’s passage with a holy light.</p>

<p>Han Sen moo’d at Xius to show that he was a cow. Xius smiled, then waved her hand. A holy light halo then flew towards him.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried to chomp on the light with his teeth. He wanted to see if he could break it without exposing himself. The ring hit his head and then grew larger. It slipped over Han Sen’s head and tightened around his neck.</p>

<p>The halo tightened around the Stone Cow’s neck, feeling as if it was going to choke him.</p>

<p>Han Sen shook his head and tried to get rid of it, but that light was so tough. Even with the Stone Cow’s powerful body, he could not break it. It must have been a special geno art belonging to the Gana.</p>

<p>As Han Sen wondered whether or not he should use his own powers to break it, he heard a strange noise come from Xius.</p>

<p>Han Sen had never heard this before. It was not a specific language, but he knew what it meant. It was a comforting tone, compelling him to obey her. It also had an undercurrent of threat.</p>

<p>It was complicated, but somehow, Han Sen was able to hear and understand it.</p>

<p>“The geno arts of the Gana are creepy. It is a shame that Purgatory Heaven is in Planet Eclipse. Otherwise, I could ask the Guna sisters,” Han Sen thought. “Since I cannot run now, let’s pretend that I have been captured. With Xius’ status, perhaps she can take me out of Return Ruin Sea. Maybe then I can expose myself.”</p>

<p>Xius kept making those sounds, and the halo continued to tighten. He felt as if his neck would snap.</p>

<p>Han Sen could get rid of the halo, but instead, he just widened his cow eyes and looked tamed. He moo’d to Xius and did not look angry. He tried to seem as harmless as possible.</p>

<p>“Will you follow me?” Xius asked, seeing the Stone Cow behave that way.</p>

<p>Moo! Han Sen pretended his best to be gentle. He walked up next to her and rubbed against her body.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept rubbing against her, recalling the behavior of Little Silver and Little Star. He thought about them for tips on how a creature should behave if it wanted to be cute.</p>

<p>Xius was happy with Han Sen’s performance. She stroked the cow’s head and smiled. “Follow me from now on, and you will benefit greatly.”</p>

<p>Moo! The Stone Cow moo’d again, showing that it understood.</p>

<p>“Sister Xius is so powerful. I have learned a lot today,” Dragon Nineteen complimented.</p>

<p>“It was just luck. This Stone Cow’s intelligence isn’t too bad, and its personality is very gentle. That’s why this process was so smooth,” Xius said.</p>

<p>The halo around Han Sen’s neck loosened. It was not gone, but it was still hanging around him.</p>

<p>“This geno art is quite interesting. I would like to learn it. It’d be far easier to catch xenogeneics with it,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

<p>Xius brought Han Sen back aboard the battleship with her. Han Sen pretended to follow her, and he did his best to behave nicely.</p>

<p>Han Sen was very good at acting cute because many of his pets were. All he had to do was copy some of their actions, and it made Xius and the others so happy. They were all very fond of him.</p>

<p>“Sister Xius, this Stone Cow is too cute. If you don’t want it, you can give it to me. I will trade it for a Duke golem mount,” Dragon Nineteen said, holding the cow’s neck and stroking it.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt as if his head was resting on something very soft. His eyes looked very innocent.</p>

<p>“Who are you kidding? It is just a Stone Cow, and it came from your Return Ruin Sea. I’ll just grab another for you later. I don’t know if I’ll have the chance to come back around these parts again, though.” Xius smiled.</p>

<p>Dragon Nineteen, hearing her say this, did not push the subject. She stroked the Stone Cow’s head again.</p>

<p>Sister Nineteen, are there any other places we have not been to?” Xius changed the subject.</p>

<p>“I have searched thousands of miles, and I think Han Sen really did escape Return Ruin Sea. If he hadn’t, I would have found him by now,” Dragon Nineteen said.</p>

<p>Since they were talking about him, Han Sen sat right next to Xius. He leaned against her, making sure he caught all they were saying.</p>

<p>Xius frowned and said, “How did he get out of Return Ruin Sea?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he has space powers or a treasure of some kind. Otherwise, how could he have come here in the first place?” Dragon Nineteen shrugged. “Han Sen is strong. He killed Sharon and Sister Thirteen, and he managed to escape from Brother Fifteen and Long Ying. I am afraid only our big brother might be able to take him down.”</p>

<p>Xius frowned. “I have been investigating Han Sen a good deal. He fought Lone Bamboo in Sky Palace to a stalemate. He is a genius. Not many of the same level are capable of beating him.”</p>

<p>“Ha. He is just lucky he hasn’t encountered my big brother yet,” Dragon Nineteen scoffed angrily.</p>

<p>“Dragon One is the best of the Dragon. He is the leader of the Dragon, so of course he is very strong,” Xius said.</p>

<p>“But Han Sen is gone. If my brother had been here to fight him, he’d have been killed.” Speaking of Dragon One, Dragon Nineteen looked very enthused. She seemed to really admire him.</p>

<p>Xius and Dragon Nineteen did not plan on leaving Return Ruin Sea just yet. They continued searching for a while with their battleship.</p>

<p>Xius thought Han Sen was still around someplace. If it was Dragon Nineteen in command, they’d have left a long time ago.</p>
