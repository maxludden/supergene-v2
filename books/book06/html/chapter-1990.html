<p>Outside the exam arena, Yun Suyi was chasing after Lone Bamboo.
He left as soon as Han Sen started fighting.</p>
<p>“Brother Lone Bamboo, please wait!” Yun Suyi shouted as she
chased after Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo stopped, looked at Yun Suyi, and said, “Sister Suyi,
what do you need?”</p>
<p>“Brother Lone Bamboo, who were you watching earlier?” Yun Suyi
knew all about Lone Bamboo. There was no reason to beat around the
bush.</p>
<p>“Why would this matter concern you?” Lone Bamboo frowned.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi quickly said, “Han Sen is my friend. Were you watching
his fight?”</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo nodded. He had no reason to hide the fact. “It is
because of him that I joined the exam. I do not want to be number
one. I only wish to fight him.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi had guessed that he had come here for Han Sen, but she
didn’t expect this answer. It shocked her.</p>
<p>“Why…” Yun Suyi looked confused.</p>
<p>Han Sen was smart, but Lone Bamboo was even stronger. After
seeing Han Sen’s power, she still believed Lone Bamboo was
superior. This thought was inside the heads of everyone in Sky
Palace. Han Sen could not change everyone’s expectations simply by
performing well.</p>
<p>“It is because he activated the twelve buildings and five cities
in White Jade Jing,” Lone Bamboo said, before he turned around.</p>
<p>“What?” Yun Suyi was shocked. In the history of Sky Palace,
fewer than one hundred people had experienced what Lone Bamboo just
claimed. And out of all the Earls in the exam, Lone Bamboo had been
the only one to see all the buildings and cities.</p>
<p>Even Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang had only been able
to spy the twelve buildings. They hadn’t seen a single one of the
five cities.</p>
<p>After Han Sen beat Cool Jade, there were no more fights left for
Han Sen that day. He would have to wait until the next day. He
didn’t leave, though. He stayed to watch the fights.</p>
<p>There was a difference between the geno arts of the geno
universe and the geno arts of the sanctuaries. Somehow, there
seemed to be a thread connecting them. Sky Palace’s geno arts were
very high tier. After watching the fights, Han Sen found himself
learning a lot. He compared what he saw to what he had learned in
the past.</p>
<p>Han Sen left the place when all the exams were over for the
day.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Han Sen did not encounter any strong
enemies. Spell was so powerful that her pistols could beat
everything she was put against. In no time at all, five Earl
students were brought down.</p>
<p>It was a shame that not many of his enemies had much in the way
of fame. As a result of this, his continued success drew little in
the way of attention. But when people did pay attention to his
fights, they were greatly interested in what sort of geno armament
Spell was.</p>
<p>Aside from the first match that Lone Bamboo spectated, he did
not return. Perhaps it was because Han Sen’s opponents were so
inferior, he wouldn’t see much of anything regardless. Whatever the
reason was, he did not come back.</p>
<p>And Lone Bamboo’s fights were fan meet-and-greets.</p>
<p>No one in Sky Palace had the courage to fight Lone Bamboo. There
was only one that had the courage to fight him, but when Lone
Bamboo pulled out his sword, he could only move a step before the
Earl student conceded.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched that match, and he was shocked. Lone Bamboo was
stronger than he thought.</p>
<p>“After all, he is the one that survived the nightmare,” Han Sen
thought to himself.</p>
<p>If he wanted the position of first, to receive Under the Sky,
he’d have to beat Lone Bamboo. There was no getting around
that.</p>
<p>The next day would be the day when Han Sen was to fight Lone
Bamboo. When he returned to Jade Island that evening, he went
straight to studying Jadeskin. He didn’t worry about the fight the
next day.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s level would not be affected by emotions. Win or lose,
as long as he tried his hardest, that was enough. Worrying over the
results was a waste of energy.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, are you here?” Yu Jing had arrived at Han Sen’s
island.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen came out the door and saw Yu Jing riding
his Jade Night Crane. It circled the sky above.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen come out, Yu Jing came down and landed with the
bird. He walked before Han Sen with a look of great worry and said,
“Brother Han, what are you going to do to prepare for
tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“What should I be preparing?” Han Sen looked at him with
confusion.</p>
<p>Yu Jing looked depressed hearing that, and he gave a wry smile.
“You are going to fight Uncle Lone Bamboo. You know how strong he
is! You should be getting prepared.”</p>
<p>“How so?” Han Sen asked, laughing.</p>
<p>“Such as taking some pills that can temporarily boost your
power. Or perhaps even a treasure. The exams allow you to take
drugs, and if you don’t have any, I have some very effective pills
you might benefit from,” Yu Jing said, bringing out a few bottles.
He placed them in front of Han Sen and said, “I can sell them to
you for a cheap price.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have money.” Han Sen held his hands out to the sides,
showing his empty palms.</p>
<p>“I can take an IOU,” Yu Jing said quickly.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be in debt,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Yu Jing was angered by this, and he asked, “Do you want to win
or not?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>Yu Jing gritted his teeth and pulled out a bottle. He said,
“This bottle belongs to the grandmaster elder in the sixth seat. It
contains the fenghou pills he created. After you use them, they can
make you as strong as a Marquise for a short time. The effects last
one hour, and for the purpose of fighting Lone Bamboo, I can let
you borrow them all.”</p>
<p>“Borrow? How? If I eat it, it’ll be gone,” Han Sen asked Yu
Jing.</p>
<p>“You use them before the fight. If you win, you reimburse me for
the pills,” Yu Jing said.</p>
<p>“What if I lose?” Han Sen smiled at Yu Jing.</p>
<p>“Then that is okay. You can pay me back slowly.” Yu Jing’s jaw
was starting to ache.</p>
<p>“I want them, but never mind. I can’t pay you back if I lose.”
Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“You…” Yu Jing was so angry. Yu Jing had never done anything
that put him at a disadvantage before. He had received those pills
from the grandmaster, and he treated them like a treasure. He
wouldn’t use them willy-nilly. He kept them in a box, and no matter
how much money he was offered, he wouldn’t sell them.</p>
<p>Now he wanted to give them to Han Sen, and Han Sen was
declining. It made him furious.</p>
<p>If Han Sen lost the next day, he’d also go bankrupt. Thinking of
that, Yu Jing had to suppress his anger. He squeezed the bottle
into Han Sen’s hand and said, “Fine. You don’t have to pay me back.
These are a gift. Use all your strength to fight, and try your best
to win tomorrow.”</p>
<p>When Yu Jing spoke, he felt as if his heart was bleeding. His
eyes were all red when he put the pills into Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>He knew that even if Han Sen did use the fenghou pills, there
was a fine chance he wouldn’t win. But any chance was better than
no chance. Yu Jing had to try everything he could to hold onto his
money.</p>
<p>“If you really want to help, get me some Earl xenogeneic genes.
I’ll pay you back for those,” Han Sen said, after a moment of
thought.</p>
<p>“Sure. Which element do you need, and how many?” Yu Jing said
quickly. If they’d give Han Sen a higher chance of winning, he’d do
it. If he was going to go bankrupt anyway, he might as well risk
it.</p>
<p>It does not matter. The more the merrier, but they do have to be
Earl.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
