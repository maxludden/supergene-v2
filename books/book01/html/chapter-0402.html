	<p>The sword skills called Que Yi focused on sacrificing oneself to complete other people&#8217;s attack. The
		thirteen evolvers were from different shelters and did not have much time to practice their collaboration.
		However, with Ning Yue present, they were connected into one killing machine. Even Han Sen could not find any
		cracks.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue looked extremely calm. All his moves looked effortless but followed some incredible rules. Although his
		attacks were not aggressive, he managed to turn the moves of the other thirteen evolvers into a part of himself,
		forcing Han Sen into the vines.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue did not want to kill Han Sen in the first place. He only wanted to see for himself the fights between
		Han Sen and those incredibly strong creatures. Either Han Sen killed the creature or got killed, his doubts
		would be answered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Young master, do we really need to fight this out?&#8221; Han Sen asked while retreating, as he understood
		Ning Yue&#8217;s intentions.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If I am alone, I would be glad to be your friend and never hurt you. However, …&#8221; Ning Yue said and
		never stopped his sword, forcing Han Sen to touch the vines.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What a shame. I did not want to kill, but…&#8221; Han Sen sighed and said. He was speaking his mind.</p>

	<p>Before figuring out the relationship between the Nings and the Hans, Han Sen did not want to kill. However, he
		was left with no choice. Same as Ning Yue, Han Sen was the kind of person that would leave no mercy when he
		decided to kill.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Kill? You? You think you are good with that sharp dagger? That doesn&#8217;t do anything. You are merely a
		beast trapped in a cage. Your life and death depends on our wish,&#8221; exclaimed Liu Lin fiercely.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Is that right?&#8221; Han Sen curled his lips. Watching the weapons coming at himself, he did not go
		further back, but pointed at Liu Lin.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Retreat.&#8221; Ning Yue suddenly had a bad feeling. Although there was no way that Han Sen could block so
		many weapons, for some reason, Ning Yue felt danger.</p>

	<p>As the weapons were about to reach Han Sen&#8217;s body, it was too late for Han Sen to run away and for the
		evolvers to take back their weapons. Despite Ning Yue&#8217;s command, his men could no longer stop themselves.
	</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>A giant monster in jade armor that looked like the cross between a scorpion and a bee suddenly appeared next to
		Han Sen, knocking away all the weapons about to hit Han Sen.</p>

	<p>The weapons used by the sacred-blood evolvers were top-notch in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, but none of them
		could hurt that monster. Instead, the evolvers were knocked back.</p>

	<p><em>Crack!</em></p>

	<p>A pair of claws that looked like the sickles of the death crossed above Liu Lin&#8217;s shoulders, sending his
		head into the air. Liu Lin&#8217;s eyes were stared wide even after death, filled with terror.</p>

	<p>The fierce super Golden rock worm king killed his way into the group. Its four wings buzzing, the worm king
		danced with its eight claws moving up and down.</p>

	<p>It was a true slaughter. Wearing super pet armor, the super golden rock worm king did not even look like
		something that belonged to First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Even the sacred-blood evolvers could not hurt it.
		Instead, anywhere the worm king went, limbs would fall, and blood would jet out. In front of absolute strength,
		even the Que Yi sword skills were completely useless.</p>

	<p>At this point, the super golden rock worm king was even stronger than the turtle. After all, its speed and
		strength were the same as the turtle. And what the turtle was best at, defense, was not as strong as the pet
		armor.</p>

	<p>Paired with its flying ability and sharp claws, it was as easy as slaughtering a dog for the golden rock worm
		king to kill the sacred-blood evolvers.</p>

	<p>There was no chance for the evolvers to retreat as well. The path connecting the valley and outside was so narrow
		that only one man could pass at a time. In addition, their speed was far worse than the golden rock worm king.
		As the group of people reached the path, a better half of them had already been killed by the super golden rock
		worm king. Only three men made it to the past.</p>

	<p>As tough as Ning Yue, he felt shocked when seeing the sacred-blood evolver&#8217;s that Starry Group took a lot
		of time and effort to cultivate slaughtered like this. What shook him even more was the existence of the super
		golden rock worm king.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Could it be something beyond a sacred-blood pet?&#8221; Ning Yue regarded the worm king which was too huge
		to enter the narrow path with complex emotions as he walked out of the path.</p>

	<p>Han Sen quickly took the pet back and entered the path himself with the cursed wolf dagger. There was no way he
		could let Ning Yue run away like this.</p>

	<p>Using Heresy Mantra and Overload, Han Sen&#8217;s speed was much better than the three survivors. It only took
		him a moment to catch up with them.</p>

	<p>The two sacred-blood evolvers falling behind Ning Yue tried to defend themselves, but there was no space for them
		to dodge in the narrow path. In addition, their weapons were slashed in half by the cursed wolf dagger.</p>

	<p>Hearing two screams and seeing the blood, Ning Yue knew that he was all alone, and Han Sen was in his face
		immediately.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue knew there was no way he could get out of here alive. After all his calculation, he did not expect Han
		Sen to have such a frightening pet. Ning Yue sighed and gave up, standing still and waiting for death to come.
	</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ning Yue, what&#8217;s so special in this valley?&#8221; Han Sen asked, with his dagger on Ning
		Yue&#8217;s neck.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Just kill me. Don&#8217;t ask.&#8221; Ning Yue did not move a muscle, not even opening his eyes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is not that easy to die either,&#8221; Han Sen said calmly. Suddenly, a beast soul was summoned and
		rushed to Ning Yue.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue&#8217;s expression suddenly changed after he heard what Han Sen said. He quickly opened his eyes and saw
		an ugly dark purple beast soul that looked like an alligator in his face.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The beast soul did not pause and entered Ning Yue&#8217;s body. The giant creature sent itself into Han
		Sen&#8217;s chest with ease.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue felt his whole body was stabbed and impaled, like someone was slicing his muscle. However, that feeling
		only lasted for a second. Shortly, the ugly beast soul came out of Ning Yue&#8217;s body and curled up next to
		Han Sen, its spooky eyes fixed on Ning Yue.</p>
