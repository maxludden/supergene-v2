<p>“D*mn it! This isn’t the way.” Han Sen felt terrible. His power
was no match for the monster’s, and the skills he had were losing
their effectiveness.</p>
<p>“I have to try this out!” As Han Sen teleported away, he used
the moment’s reprieve to pull out a piece of gear. It was a
peculiar bottle. The handle was the tail of two sirens. It was the
holy item Siren Bottle from the sirens in the Extreme King.</p>
<p>Han Sen tapped on the left side of the Siren Bottle, but before
he could take the next step, the Red Blood Demon was in front of
him. Its sharp claws were like knives, and Han Sen was unable to
avoid them. He immediately summoned the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze
to block the Red Blood Demon’s scary attacks.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen couldn’t use the power of the shield to attack,
it still had amazing defenses. The Red Blood Demon’s claws came
down on the shield but failed to deal any damage to it. The scary
power blasted Han Sen and the shield away, though.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body slammed into the back wall of the hall. His
entire body felt as if it had been shattered. It was almost too
painful for him to stand back up.</p>
<p>Han Sen got control of his pain and teleported away. The next
moment, the Red Blood Demon was right where Han Sen had just been.
The red substance chains lashed out against the wall and made the
spells flash.</p>
<p>The Siren Bottle that had fallen to the floor was glowing
weirdly. It displayed the face of the Siren Virgin.</p>
<p>“Siren Virgin, I’m in trouble. Help me get rid of this guy!” Han
Sen quickly shouted at the Siren Virgin when she appeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen had just said that when the Red Blood Demon’s talons
flashed toward him again. Han Sen flapped his Apollo Wings and,
through careful judgment, decided to veer left. He managed to evade
the attack. But the Red Blood Demon’s body flashed again. Those
claws were right in front of Han Sen once more.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried his best to dodge, but a substance chain still
connected with his shoulder. The blow opened him deeply enough to
expose pale white bones inside his flesh.</p>
<p>“The Red Blood Demon?” the Siren Virgin said in shock when she
saw the Red Blood Demon.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you know this creep. This is just a
doppelganger, though. It is only primitive class. Do you know how
to deal with it?” Han Sen immediately asked as he teleported
again.</p>
<p>With a wry smile, the Siren Virgin said, “If my true body was
still here, perhaps I could fight it. But right now, I still don’t
have a body. There is no way for me to help you. Although it is
just a doppelganger, the Red Blood Demon is a doppelganger that
carries the battle experience of its true self. It isn’t like an
ordinary primitive deified. So, I wish you luck.”</p>
<p>After that, the body of the Siren Virgin shrank. She returned to
the Siren Bottle.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have any time to be angry. The Red Blood Demon
was already on him again. He had nowhere to dodge, so he had to use
the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze to block the strike again.</p>
<p>Although the shield protected Han Sen’s body from the creature’s
claws, it did nothing to soften the impact of the strike. It made
Han Sen’s body feel like it had been struck by a big hammer.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unable to fight the fiend, and he knew he couldn’t
escape. He was at a dead end.</p>
<p>“I can’t keep going on like this. If this keeps up, my body
isn’t going to last. Even if I find a chance to strike back, I
won’t have any strength left to do so. I guess I will just have to
try this.” Han Sen gritted his teeth. The Blood-Pulse Sutra inside
his body began to surge like mad, but this time, it was different.
The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s path ran in complete reverse.</p>
<p>This geno art was no longer the Blood-Pulse Sutra. It was the
Xuan Yellow Sutra Han Sen had fished out of the Underworld Lake. It
was a different geno art entirely from the Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>
<p>Han Sen was desperate. He had to try every option he had before
it was too late. If Mister White’s theory of the Xuan Yellow Sutra
was correct, perhaps the Xuan Yellow Sutra was the last thing that
could save Han Sen’s life.</p>
<p>If someone else had attempted to practice the Xuan Yellow Sutra,
it would have been extremely hard. But to cast it, Han Sen only had
to reverse the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He hadn’t even needed to practice
with it.</p>
<p>But this was Han Sen’s first time casting the Xuan Yellow Sutra.
He didn’t know what would happen after he used it.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power was gunning in reverse through Han
Sen’s body. It made him feel like his entire body was covered in
static. It made him feel as if his body wasn’t coursing with blood,
but with electricity instead. The tingling pain almost made Han
Sen—a man with a strong will—scream aloud.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra usually released a red aura. In reverse,
though, that color darkened to a red that was nearly black. It was
like old, dried-up blood.</p>
<p>The Red Blood Demon was unbothered by this change. Its eyes
still looked murderous, and it swung its claws at Han Sen
again.</p>
<p>It would be too hard for Han Sen to dodge. His body was in so
much pain that it felt like he was going to be torn apart. There
was no way he could dodge the next strike.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth to endure the pain and raised his
shield to protect his body. At the same time, he punched toward the
Red Blood Demon.</p>
<p>The Red Blood Demon ignored Han Sen’s fist as the claws came
down upon the surface of the shield.</p>
<p>Han Sen clutched the shield desperately. He moaned in pain. The
reversed Blood-Pulse Sutra released its power, and it felt as if
his body was being torn apart. The pain he felt was too difficult
to describe.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Red Blood Demon’s blow came down on the shield. Han Sen’s
body flew away with the shield, but the Xuan Yellow Sutra he cast
also hit the Red Blood Demon.</p>
<p>Han Sen hit the seal again, and he once more coughed up blood.
But he noticed that his wounds weren’t as grievous as they had
been.</p>
<p>Then, to his shock, Han Sen realized that the Blood-Pulse Sutra
had become half-deified. It had finally completed a key step in its
ascension, combining the nine tiers to revert back to one.</p>
<p>He quickly looked at the Red Blood Demon. He wanted to know if
the Xuan Yellow Sutra had worked or not.</p>
<p>The results were disappointing. The Red Blood Demon didn’t look
as if it had been injured. It looked the same as it always had. Its
presence was oh-so scary. Before Han Sen could really get a good
look at it, the Red Blood Demon was already committed to another
attack.</p>
<p>“Oh no, this is the end of the line for the great Han Sen… The
Xuan Yellow Sutra didn’t work…” Han Sen thought sadly. If the Xuan
Yellow Sutra didn’t work, he would have to use the Shield of the
Medusa’s Gaze again.</p>
<p>But with his body already injured, using the shield would
probably end up sucking him dry again. This time he could die, and
it was way too big of a risk.</p>
<p>So, despite the dire nature of his situation, Han Sen hesitated
to use the power of the shield. But as he hesitated, something
unbelievable happened.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel the Red Blood Demon’s power and speed
lessen.</p>
