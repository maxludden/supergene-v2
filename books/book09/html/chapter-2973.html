<p>When God’s Retribution saw Han Sen, he checked him out with a
look of surprise. It made Han Sen’s heart skip. He asked, “What are
you looking at?”</p>
<p>“You got hit by Moment God, who is an Annihilation God Spirit,
yet you are fine,” God’s Retribution said with a smile. “It seems
Godfather Han lives up to his title.”</p>
<p>“What Han Godfather? Stop laughing at me. I have only just
recovered from that wound.” Han Sen paused and looked at God’s
Retribution before saying, “You are a very busy person. You won’t
go to the Free Treasure Palace, so what are you looking at me for
exactly?”</p>
<p>“I want to come here and chill with you. Unfortunately, time is
against me. After I left the sanctuaries, all I have done is
practice, practice, and practice. I do not even have the time to
close my eyes. I have barely become primitive class, yet you are
already true god. You are making people jealous and envious.”</p>
<p>God’s Retribution sighed and went on to say, “This time, I have
come here on behalf of the legion’s orders. We need you to come and
see Blood Legion. The legion’s leader says he wants to see
you.”</p>
<p>“Which leader of Blood Legion are you talking about?” Han Sen
frowned. He remembered Blood Legion’s leader was Mister Lee, who
was trapped inside a coffin in the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>“It is not the one you are thinking of. The leader is the
creator of Blood Legion. He is the first leader. You can call him
Human King.” God’s Retribution’s answer made Han Sen’s body
shiver.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to ask for some details, but God’s Retribution
said he did not know much. He said if he had any questions, he
could go and ask the legion leader directly.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it and decided to go to Blood Legion. He
had many questions about Blood Legion that he wanted answers
to.</p>
<p>Back when Han Jinzhi was taken away by Blood Legion, Han Sen did
not know what he did or what the legend was. He also did not know
why Lou Lie was a real human of Blood Legion. He also had a few
questions about the Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>
<p>It was also possible that Blood Legion’s leader, who was called
Human King, could give him the answers he sought.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen allowed Nine-Thousand King to return to the big
barren system alone while he went ahead to see Blood Legion
alongside God’s Retribution.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not trust Blood Legion because Blood Legion’s people
had blue blood. They were different from humans. Blood Legion had
been in the universe for many years. Despite that, they had never
lifted a finger to help humanity.</p>
<p>Those two points alone were enough to make Han Sen feel unsafe
around Blood Legion. Even though Blood Legion’s leader was called
Human King, he was still worried.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen thought of that, he still had to go.</p>
<p>God’s Retribution took Han Sen to a weird ship. Inside the ship,
Han Sen’s Dongxuan Area could not be used. That made Han Sen
frown.</p>
<p>God’s Retribution seemed to know Han Sen worried a lot. He said,
“All these years in Blood Legion, we have been chased by a
particular God Spirit. So, we have to be prepared. The design of
this ship is not against you. It is because we do not want to be
tracked by the God Spirit.”</p>
<p>“Why would a God Spirit want to kill the people of Blood
Legion?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It is all we are humans,” God’s Retribution said. It was an
honest answer, but it was an answer that made Han Sen more
suspicious.</p>
<p>“I am a human too. There are also many humans in Space Garden.
Why has the God Spirit not come to trouble us?” Han Sen took this
seriously.</p>
<p>God’s Retribution was silent a moment before saying, “I am not
sure about why that is. Someone asked me the same question, but I
was never sure of what to tell them. So, I just have to guess that
it has something to do with the blue blood.”</p>
<p>“Blue blood,” Han Sen said to himself.</p>
<p>All of the key questions led back to the beginning. Blood
Legion’s members had blue blood, and the blue blood came from the
human genes.</p>
<p>This blue-blood gene power was only activated after several
generations practiced Blood-Pulse Sutra. Han Sen was the first
generation of humans to study the Blood-Pulse Sutra, so he did not
have the blue blood.</p>
<p>Even Littleflower and Little Ling’er, who were the second
generation, did not have blue blood.</p>
<p>So, blue blood did not come about even in the second generation.
It took many generations of humans practicing Blood-Pulse Sutra for
their blood to start becoming blue.</p>
<p>Han Sen practiced the Blood-Pulse Sutra, but he could never
sense the Blood-Pulse Sutra giving any sort of blue-blood power. It
just made his genes and genetic qualities better.</p>
<p>Before that, Han Sen had many guesses. According to the theories
he came up with, the human body should have had a hidden blue gene.
The chance of it being activated with the genes of a human was more
than slim. It was so small that it could not affect the bodies of
humans. That was why one needed Blood-Pulse Sutra for several
generations. It was to fulfill and pump that blue-blood gene. That
way, the blue-blood gene was able to become the main part of a
human’s genes.</p>
<p>If Han Sen guessed all of this correctly, the blue-blood genes
did not come from the crystallizers because the crystallizers did
not have blue-blood men. They were just like humans with red
blood.</p>
<p>There was more evidence to support the fact that crystallizers
did not have blue-blood genes. God’s Retribution and his fellows
were not like ordinary human beings and could not absorb the genes
of creatures.</p>
<p>The members who had blue blood would have to evolve by
themselves. They were not able to combine their genes with the
genes of any other creature. It worked like that in the
sanctuaries, so it had to be the same in the big universe as
well.</p>
<p>God’s Retribution said he was now equal to a primitive deified.
He did not say he was exactly though.</p>
<p>No matter if a blue-blood man was in the sanctuaries or the big
universe, they were a very unique sort of people. They kind of
existed outside the rules, but they had big connections to ordinary
humans. That was something that flummoxed Han Sen.</p>
<p>The crystallizers were different. They were standard universal
creatures. They were the same as humans in the sanctuaries. They
followed the rules of the big universe to grow up. That was
different from the blue-blood men, so there was no way the
blue-blood genes came from the crystallizers.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Stay Up Late said that humans were the results
of crystallizers using their genes to combine with the genes of
other creatures. The blue-blood genes had to come from that
creature, but what was that creature?”</p>
<p>One thing Han Sen knew for sure was that the progress of the
Blood-Pulse Sutra was progress for making blue-blood genes take
over the genes of humans.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. He
also did not know what sort of creature that was.</p>
<p>The reason Han Sen knew Blood-Pulse Sutra was very strong was
that it could make the next generation, and the generation after
that, stronger. He did not let his family practice the Blood-Pulse
Sutra, not even Littleflower and Ling’er.</p>
<p>The ship left slip space and flew into a barren system. There
were many stars, and there was a giant red dwarf.</p>
