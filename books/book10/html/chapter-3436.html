<p>“That is very good. Yes, just like that. Let me see the true
potential of your body.” Crape Myrtle watched the changes
manifesting across Han Sen’s body. His eyes flickered with a weird
light. One could only hear his voice come through as mumbles.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s muscles were tightening, and so was his skin. He
wanted to escape the pinning restrictions of the 28 lights with his
strength.</p>
<p>“You were right in saying that my body is unable to feel the
rules and order. It is like a stone that is so hard it is also
useless.” Han Sen kept saying things like this while struggling
because he had exhausted so much strength. The places the light
pinned him were not producing grooves in his body. It was like
invisible pins were going to pierce through his skin at any given
moment.</p>
<p>“What does that have to do with anything?” Han Sen asked while
he continued to struggle. “Even if you cannot feel the rules and
order, my body still exists. Earlier, you said everything is
complete and separate from everything else. One ant. One lion. One
stone. Each thing is a complete, small universe unto itself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but so what? Just spit it out, man! What on earth are you
trying to say?” Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen with great
interest.</p>
<p>“Even so, my body will still have a universe of its own on the
inside,” Han Sen said. “Because this universe is in chaos mode, we
cannot understand it. At least, I myself cannot understand it.” His
right arm, which had been exerting force moved a little. Blood
started to seep from the limb.</p>
<p>He was using too much strength. The skin of the arm that had
been pinned by the light had been torn. Blood came out from it.</p>
<p>“Do you mean that your body is like the chaos mode from before
the universe exploded?” Crape Myrtle asked after taking more than a
moment to think about it.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is precisely what I mean. You are correct.” When Han
Sen spoke, the skin broke where the 28 lights had him pinned. He
was bleeding.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care about the wounds he had incurred. He still
used strength and tried to escape the light, but this movement only
made his wounds bigger. Blood came out like drops of water.</p>
<p>“You are a very daring person to think this way. You treat your
body like the universe before it exploded. This makes it seem like
you might have infinite possibilities.” Crape Myrtle slightly
pursed his lips, smiled, and said, “But there is one thing you have
wrong. I said every creature can use their body as a little
universe, but this little universe, compared to the real universe,
is very small and very simple. It is more like a prototype. The
body still needs to keep evolving to make the beginning of this
universe more complete. Do that, and it can be strong like the
universe. If, in accordance with what you said is true, your body
is a chaotic universe before it exploded, it means you are the
lowest-tier creature of the pyramid. You are more behind than any
other creature.”</p>
<p>“You are right if that is how you want to view it. My body’s
evolution is worse than any other creature in the universe…” Han
Sen only spoke half of what he meant to when his right hand
clenched into a fist. The light that pinned his hand went through
his flesh and bones. It left a bloody hole inside him.</p>
<p>“So, what? No one understands my body more than I do. Although
it is very slow, I know I can feel it. It is not powerless. I can
even say it is incredibly strong. I just don’t have the ability to
break its binding and unleash its power. If I can take that step, I
believe this body will become the strongest in the universe.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen spoke, more blood oozed out as the light was ripped
away. It went through his flesh and bones.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body leaned forward. The light was still where it was.
It went through his body and skull. His eyebrows and his brain had
bloody holes in them.</p>
<p>His body was absolutely drenched in blood from top-to-bottom.
Just the mere sight of him was revolting. All the people who were
paying attention to the battle felt their skin crawl and itch, but
it was a visual that was worth enduring. Han Sen managed to get rid
of the restrictions that were nailing him down. He managed to shed
the 28, cruel lights that had been doing their best to keep him
immobile.</p>
<p>The muscles in Han Sen’s body were extremely tense at this
point. He looked like a burning fire that was raging brightly. He
looked at Crape Myrtle and approached him. With each step, the
blood holes in his body healed. Suddenly, he was back to normal.
Not even a scar remained to indicate where he had been damaged.</p>
<p>If his clothes were not stained in blood, no one would have
believed what experience he had just been through.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle frowned. When Han Sen walked closer step by step,
he thought, “Is his body really that tough? Not even the universe
power that I enlightened can make his body breakthrough.”</p>
<p>Han Sen said, “Crape Myrtle, I really appreciate the assistance.
As a reward, please take my punch.” At the same time, he lifted his
fist and threw a punch into Crape Myrtle’s belly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was now certain that Crape Myrtle was Mister God from
the geno hall. Aside from him, no one understood the universe that
much.</p>
<p>At this level, even Qin Xiu and Tai Yi were not as good as God
Hall Leader.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Crape Myrtle wasn’t really there to fight him.
Crape Myrtle had many chances to kick him out of the battleground,
but he always seemed to elect to staying there and chatting</p>
<p>Even the universe theory was something Crape Myrtle very
obviously wanted to explain to Han Sen. He clearly wanted Han Sen
to understand his current body type.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle had also told Han Sen his universe theory might not
be correct. Han Sen still needed to determine what was up with his
body through his own understanding.</p>
<p>“Your body is still in a chaos mode. A guy such as you cannot
get hurt now…” Crape Myrtle was not planning on dodging. His body
was composed of bright spirit lights. It gave people the impression
that he looked extremely unreal.</p>
<p>In fact, in that universe, not many powers were able to hurt
Crape Myrtle. It was more like there weren’t any.</p>
<p>Unless he walked the last step, even a guy like Qin Xiu would be
unable to harm Crape Myrtle.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle was only half a step away from achieving the
Universe class. That was one reason. The most important one was the
fact he was the leader of the geno hall, and the geno hall was like
a machine that controlled the universe. Crape Myrtle himself was
the greatest master in the universe.</p>
<p>In the universe, unless you had a Universe-class power, one
could not hurt him.</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s fist struck Crape Myrtle’s belly, Crape Myrtle
stopped talking. His eyes opened wide. The size of his pupils
shrank.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s fist at its center, one could see the wave go
across Crape Myrtle’s body. It was like Crape Myrtle’s body was a
giant blob of jelly.</p>
