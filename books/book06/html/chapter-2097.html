<p>Sleepless Duke bellowed to the sky in rage.</p>

<p>Many other Night Ghosts screamed, too. They gave up attacking the blue shield, and instead, they used their claws to cut their own bodies. Blood flowed down like rain.</p>

<p>Sleepless Duke swung her Blood Demon Spear in slow arcs. The red-pattern on it started to glow, and the rain of blood was drawn towards the spear. When droplets of blood began to land on the spear, they soaked into it, dyeing the weapon a deeper red.</p>

<p>It looked like the blood was pooling on the spear’s metal surface, but no matter how much blood dripped onto it, not a single smidgen was lost. The red light of the spear became brighter, and the spear’s tip shone crimson.</p>

<p>That bloody light looked as if it could destroy space. It left shadows in the air.</p>

<p>Sleepless Duke roared. She flapped her wings, lifted the Blood Demon Spear, and flew toward the sphere like a waterfall. From the ground, she looked like a red comet flying across the sky. The atmosphere was tinged with the scent of blood, and then, she struck the blue shield. The red light exploded against it, but the blue shield did not break.</p>

<p>“There is not enough power in the spear yet! If you attack too soon, you’ll waste the power of the blood you have already amassed. Do you see the Blood Demon Orb on its end? Only when it begins to shine will the max amount of power have been stored inside the spear. Strike when it is bright! Han Sen and the others will all be destroyed in one fell strike,” Kahn said, blinking.</p>

<p>There was nothing else Sleepless Duke could do. Looking murderous, she called to the Night Ghosts again. The Night Ghosts heard her scream, and they began tearing into their own bodies again, trying to draw enough blood to power up the Blood Demon Spear.</p>

<p>The Blood Demon Spear was getting brighter. Blood rained down on the weapon like a storm, and the spear grew stronger and stronger. But the Night Ghosts were running out of strength. Many had lost so much blood that they fell limply to the ground.</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t the orb lit up yet?” Sleepless Duke shouted at Kahn.</p>

<p>“This is a King class weapon. It isn’t that easy to activate. At least half of these Night Ghosts need to die to trigger its power,” Kahn said.</p>

<p>“I cannot let them die!” Sleepless Duke roared.</p>

<p>“There is no way back. We have to kill Han Sen now. If they escape this planet, they will contact Sky Palace. And then, we will all be killed. None of the Night Ghosts will be spared,” Kahn said calmly.</p>

<p>Sleepless Duke gripped the Blood Demon Spear tightly. She looked as if she was in pain. She looked around at the falling blood, at the Night Ghosts who had already collapsed.</p>

<p>Those Night Ghosts had eaten many living creatures, and as a result, their will was messed up. But they still followed Sleepless Duke’s orders. They were all willing to bleed and bleed. None of them chickened out or took the time to heal themselves.</p>

<p>“I am going to kill you all. It is because of you that the Night Ghosts have become like this…” Sleepless Duke held the spear as it glowed brighter and brighter. She ran in front of the blue shield, snarling through her bared teeth, and roared at Han Sen. Her pretty face was twisted.</p>

<p>“Sleepless Duke, you had it coming!” Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s words filled her with white-hot fury. She looked murderous, and her eyes gleamed red. She began hurrying the Night Ghosts to sacrifice even more blood.</p>

<p>“Quick! Hurry!” Sleepless Duke watched the Blood Demon Orb, hoping it would light up soon. Otherwise, all the Night Ghosts would be dead.</p>

<p>“Han Sen! Can your shield block that? That spear’s power looks like it is King class,” the man said to Han Sen. He was still in the process of wrapping up his wounds.</p>

<p>The blue shield was obviously very tough, but it looked like thin glass. The man found himself doubting its ability to withstand a King class attack.</p>

<p>“It should be fine,” Han Sen said. In truth, he wasn’t sure.</p>

<p>The Demon Bug King’s Bai Sema was a Mutant King beast soul. That meant it was half-deified. It was a higher level than a King class strike, so it should have been able to take whatever strike was being prepped for him.</p>

<p>But that was all just theory. Han Sen had never tested how much power the Demon Bug King’s Bai Sema could take. He didn’t know.</p>

<p>“What does should mean?” The man’s eyes opened wide as he looked at Han Sen.</p>

<p>“That means probably.” Han Sen laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh my God.” The man held his forehead. He looked depressed as he said, “I always have the worst luck. Never bet on luck.”</p>

<p>“Our only option here is to throw the dice, though. Do you have a better idea?” Han Sen laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh no! It looks like Old Xi is going to die here.” The man started to cry.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” Han Sen asked, looking at the man.</p>

<p>“My name is Xi Menxiaong. You’re asking me this now? At a time like this? Think about how we might dodge that scary power and avoid death!” Xi Menxiaong said.</p>

<p>The blood was a downpour, and the spear was like a dragon.</p>

<p>It seemed like the whole of Planet Night Ghost was flooded with a layer of blood. Its smell was everywhere, and even the sky was choked with red clouds.</p>

<p>Half of the Night Ghosts were dead. It was too high of a price to pay for King class power.</p>

<p>Sleepless Duke was full of hatred as she stared at Han Sen. If that horrible stare had been solid, it would have peeled Han Sen’s flesh from his bones.</p>

<p>The place was in ruin, and many of the Night Ghosts were dying of blood loss. The ones in the sky were all trembling. It looked as if they could all keel over and perish.</p>

<p>Sleepless Duke’s eyes were filled with blood tears, but she had no choice but to continue.</p>

<p>The sky turned red like hell itself.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>The Blood Demon Orb was shining now. The red light lit up the entire Blood Demon Spear. Sleepless Duke looked as if she was holding a red laser.</p>

<p>“Go to hell!” Sleepless Duke spun the spear toward the blue sphere. The shocking red light was coming at Han Sen. It looked as if it could obliterate a galaxy.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried to dodge, but the red light was too scary. It looked as if it had locked on, too. The red light was like a volcano that had just erupted. There was nowhere that Han Sen and the others could go to get away from that red light, and even the air was torn apart by its passage.</p>
