<h2>Evil Eye</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2116</h3>

<p>Han Sen didn’t get to see Littleflower fight, so he went to
watch others fight instead.</p>
<p>Of the Marquises, he managed to watch Dragon Eight and Lone
Bamboo fight. Han Sen wanted to see Evil Eye fight, but he soon
learned that all of Evil Eye’s opponents gave up whenever they were
pitted against him. No one wished to battle someone that
frightening.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he wouldn’t get to see Evil Eye fighting that
day, but much to his surprise, he did. That day, a creature was
brave or foolish enough to stay and fight.</p>
<p>That creature had three heads and six arms. It looked like a
demon wearing silver armor. Its two lower hands gripped rods, while
its other four arms wielded a knife, a sword, an ax, and a stick
individually. Each of the beast’s heads was unique. The middle head
was that of a bird, while the other two bore demonic faces. The
left looked female, whereas the right two looked male. The three
heads looked as if they could talk to each other, as well.</p>
<p>The weapons in the creature’s six hands were shining brilliantly
against Evil Eye.</p>
<p>The lights were strange, and each sheen was of a different
color. It looked like it wielded a variety of different powers. The
rod was wood. The knife was gold. The sword was water. The ax was
fire. The stick was earth. All five weapons were unleashing light
together. It looked as if they worked together in a formation, and
when the five powers gathered up, the attack power was given a
boost.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that when the five powers combined, they’d be as
strong as his body.</p>
<p>“There are many hidden elites scattered throughout this
universe. One elite can combine all these powers? Judging from all
of these skills and abilities, there is no doubt he is one of the
greatest Marquises out there. That power he has combined is almost
as great as my power,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the three-headed, six-armed creature’s slip of
paper. It said, “Destroyed – Rage Man.” Han Sen realized Destroyed
was one of the top five races in the geno hall. That was why this
being was so strong.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Rage Man’s opponent. He was wearing a purple
and white set of armor. The purple bone flowers on the armor were
raised from its surface. Han Sen couldn’t see his face, but his
body was shaped like a human’s. After being reborn this time, no
one knew what race Evil Eye belonged to.</p>
<p>When Rage Man attacked, Evil Eye didn’t fight, but he traveled
through the bushes around him like the wind. Rage Man made full use
of his power, but he still could not touch Evil Eye.</p>
<p>“Evil Eye, are you merely going to keep dodging?” Rage Man
suddenly stopped. His six eyes stared at Evil Eye with a smile.</p>
<p>Evil Eye stood where he was, and when he replied, his voice was
toneless. “You are the first creature that has dared to fight me.
For that, I will spare your life.”</p>
<p>“The others might be scared of you, but I am not. You can say
something like this when I let you survive.” Rage Man looked very
angry, and his weapons rattled in his hands.</p>
<p>Around Evil Eye, many lights formed. Five different colors
blended together to become one singular albeit giant light. The
light trapped Evil Eye in its beam. Power burst out of Rage Man as
he tried to squeeze and condense the light around his opponent. He
was trying to kill Evil Eye.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. Rage Man’s light skill was similar to Han
Sen’s knife silks.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knife silks could be cast whenever, but Rage Man
needed five elements to create his prison. That meant his skill had
a restriction, compared to Han Sen’s knife silks that could be used
whenever.</p>
<p>Seeing Rage Man able to use power like that, Han Sen knew he was
a special person.</p>
<p>“Where are you going to hide now?” Rage Man shouted. The five
lights tightened around his enemy, and it looked likely to mince
Evil Eye’s body into tiny bits.</p>
<p>Evil Eye was still in the light. He lifted his right hand to
press against the light. The people watching expected an amazing
fight to unfold. But when Evil Eye’s hand touched the light, the
light shattered. The formation of light became a mess of simple
beams. It was like a vortex existed on Evil Eye’s hand, pulling
them in casually.</p>
<p>Evil Eye collected all those lights in his hand, until a
baseball-sized orb of light gathered on his palm. The light looked
scarier than it had earlier, like some sort of bomb.</p>
<p>“This… impossible…” Rage Man stuttered. His hardest attack with
five elemental powers had been unable to do a speck of damage to
Evil Eye. Evil Eye broke it and confiscated the power for
himself.</p>
<p>Evil Eye threw the colorful orb of light at Rage Man. It looked
like a basic, casual lob, but the light orb warped space as it
stormed toward Rage Man. It didn’t even leave Rage Man an opening
to dodge.</p>
<p>Rage Man roared. He used his five weapons to gather up another
orb of light and fired this newly-created orb back at the light orb
that was currently on its way to him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Rage Man had done his absolute best to gather up all his power
and strike the other light orb with the new one. The two airborne
orbs of light exploded as they collided.</p>
<p>Argh!</p>
<p>The results weren’t good for Rage Man, as each of his weapons
was immediately destroyed in the chaotic power unleashed against
him. Furthermore, his armor shattered, and every single item he was
currently carrying was destroyed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>However, the strangest thing about all of this was that Rage Man
was not injured. Even after he screamed for what he thought would
be the last time, he turned out to be fine.</p>
<p>That scary power had only broken his armor and weapons. Every
item he possessed was destroyed, but he himself was not injured. He
didn’t even have a single singed hair.</p>
<p>Rage Man screamed because he thought he was going to die. He was
not injured, and so he just stood where he was. With his mouth
agape, his face turned green. He looked embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I told you I wasn’t going to kill you,” Evil Eye said.</p>
<p>Rage Man’s three faces turned green and red. He ripped apart his
paper and left the Geno Being Scroll.</p>
<p>“Evil Eye really is Evil Eye! The elite from Destroyed was like
a baby before him. They weren’t on the same level.”</p>
<p>“He used Rage Man’s power to defeat him, and somehow managed to
do it without hurting him. Evil Eye controls his power like a
god.”</p>
<p>“He is supposed to be deified. I don’t know how many times he
has been.”</p>
<p>“It looks like there are no others likely to become number one
in the Marquise rankings. Rage Man is just as good as Dragon Eight
and Lone Bamboo, but if even he was that useless against Evil Eye,
no other Marquise stands a chance of beating him.”</p>
<p>“It looks like the occupant for number one is settled.”</p>
<p>“Evil Eye, what a scary man.”</p>
<p>The people that watched the fight were in shock. They greatly
admired Evil Eye. He was too good for the others to even be jealous
of his talents.</p>
