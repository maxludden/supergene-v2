<p>Dou Tian Yu’s Jade Demon Punch was so evil and overbearing
because a God Spirit Blood-Pulse was an exclusive gene race. The
power it was able to cast was more normal than an ordinary
god-class gene race.</p>
<p>No matter how overbearing and cruel he was, he was blocked by
the red punches. He could not get close to the room.</p>
<p>Everybody was shocked. Dou Tian Yu and the other god-blood
nobles used all their powers to attack, but they were still blocked
outside the door. They were unable to imagine how powerful Han Sen
was.</p>
<p>“Interesting,” Mister God One said. He was standing far away,
watching Dou Tian Yu and the red fists fighting. He was
intrigued.</p>
<p>Si Tu Ya was shocked. The stronger Han Sen was, the higher the
chance to erase the gene race power that was claiming Feng Fei
Fei’s life. To her, this was terrible news.</p>
<p>In the room, Han Sen’s purple dragon air and red power were
combined into one. He waved one fist to block Dou Tian Yu outside
the door. Another hand was inside the skin of Feng Fei Fei’s chest.
He was pulling out the copper wires from her chest.</p>
<p>All of those copper wires were being pulled out, one by one. The
lotus shadow beneath the skin was becoming dim. Feng Fei Fei’s red
eyes grew dimmer. A bit of clarity returned to her mind.</p>
<p>“What is he doing?” Feng Fei Fei started to wake up. Her body
was surrounded by purple and red lights. Han Sen was like a demon
god. She was extremely shocked.</p>
<p>When she realized what was happening, she was even more
shocked.</p>
<p>“A god-blood noble… He is a god-blood noble…” Feng Fei Fei
witnessed Han Sen reaching out a fist full of light. It kept Dou
Tian Yu at bay outside the door. He did not even look at the door.
His eyes were observing her chest the entire time.</p>
<p>“Chest.” When Feng Fei Fei thought of that, she blushed. She saw
the bronze wires in front of her chest and knew he was trying to
save her life.</p>
<p>She felt shy and even more amazed. Han Sen used one hand to keep
an elite like Dou Tian Yu at bay and outside the door. On top of
that, he still had the power to fix the scary and weird power that
was trying to claim her life. Despite all that, he was doing
totally fine. He probably had even more power. That was scary and
hard to imagine.</p>
<p>“Who is he? How did he become Little Yin’s friend?” Feng Fei Fei
felt very conflicted. Her pretty eyes looked weird.</p>
<p>Outside the door, Dou Tian Yu summoned a God Spirit combination.
He put his God Spirit Blood-Pulse to operate at max capacity. It
made his entire body look like a reborn God Spirit. He glowed with
powerful god light. Every punch seemed as if it carried a power
that could destroy the sky and earth.</p>
<p>Even so, he was unable to enter the room. It shocked everyone.
All they could do was stand back and watch.</p>
<p>“What is Han Sen? Who is he? How is he able to fight a god-blood
noble? Is he a god-blood noble too?”</p>
<p>“No way. I never heard of a god-blood noble named Han
before.”</p>
<p>“If he is not a god-blood noble, how else is he able to
challenge Dou Tian Yu, who has combined with a God Spirit?”</p>
<p>“Whatever happened today has been way too weird. Han Sen is too
mysterious.”</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei’s voice came from the room. “Little Mister, please
stop. Han Sen is helping me with the wound. He means no harm.
Please, everyone, wait outside. Wait until I am mostly healed, and
I will thank everyone again.”</p>
<p>After hearing her voice, Feng Yin Yin was very happy. “Auntie,
are you better?”.</p>
<p>“Little Yin, do not worry. Han Sen is healing me. I should be
fine soon.” Feng Fei Fei’s voice came out from the room again.</p>
<p>After she said that, everyone was even more shocked. Han Sen was
fighting the Dou Tian Yu and healing Feng Fei Fei at the same time.
That was unbelievable.</p>
<p>After hearing all of that, Dou Tian Yu frowned. His eyes burned
with a god light, but he did not strike again.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, you are very good. Today is not a good day to
fight. Let’s fight another day.” Dou Tian Yu looked at the door,
turned around, and departed.</p>
<p>This fight made Han Sen’s name become famous across Jade Wall
City. It was not too far-reaching, but it did have many superior
people feel slightly worried.</p>
<p>Of course, that was because not many people witnessed all of
this with their own two eyes. Whoever heard about this thought the
rumors had been blown out of proportion and most of it had been
made up. Even with a blood ghost spirit, he could not have healed
Feng Fei Fei and keep the god-blood noble Dou Tian Yu at bay.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had also given away a mutant eight sound bug egg. He
had a Holy Wen White Deer and a blood ghost spirit. People were
very curious about the identity of that individual, and they made
sure to peruse the stock in his store. They wanted to see what
other gene races Han Sen’s shop sold.</p>
<p>The results disappointed them. Han Sen’s shop had mutant eight
sound bugs for sale, but the prices were too high. They were not
worth the money they were priced at. Aside from that, there were
just some viscount- and earl-class gene races. They were rare, but
they were not really good stuff. Some strange people bought some
rare gene eggs from the shop.</p>
<p>In Gong Shu Manor, Gong Shu Zhi was frozen. He saw the si ming
demon race, which looked like Feng Fei Fei, releasing black smoke.
Suddenly, it no longer resembled Feng Fei Fei. It looked like a
faceless bronze statue. Gong Shu Zhi’s body shook. He coughed out
blood. “Impossible… That is impossible… Who destroyed the si ming
demon race power?” Gong Shu Zhi’s eyes were full of shock.</p>
<p>“Master, are you OK?” The old servant picked up Gong Shu
Zhi.</p>
<p>“I am fine. Go and get Si Tu Ya. Ask her what happened.” Gong
Shu Zhi pushed the servant away. He gave the order in a fit of
rage.</p>
<p>After he said that, Si Tu Ya, who had messy hair and a lot of
blood on her face, rushed in. She asked, “Mister, is your si ming
demon race broken?”</p>
<p>“What did that b*tch Feng Fei Fei do?” Gong Shu Zhi madly
asked.</p>
<p>Si Tu Ya’s face looked like soil. She knew Gong Shu Zhi’s si
ming demon race was broken. She told him about Han Sen being able
to fight Dou Tian Yu while healing Feng Fei Fei at the same
time.</p>
<p>She did not stay and watch Feng Fei Fei come out. In a panic,
she ran straight to Gong Shu Zhi.</p>
<p>Gong Shu Zhi’s expression changed. “Does Han Sen have such
power?”</p>
<p>“Mister, what do we do now?” Si Tu Ya quickly asked. “Feng Fei
Fei will not let this go.”</p>
<p>Gong Shu Zhi’s face kept contorting. A while later, he said, “Do
not worry. I have a way for them to be killed and not be brought
back.”</p>
<p>“What way is that?” Si Tu Ya asked.</p>
<p>“Mister Mu always wanted my si ming demon race and a few other
gene races. I did not want to make the trade, but I have to do it
this time.” Gong Shu Zhi had a look of murder in his eyes as he
said, “My son is dead. It is pointless for me to hold onto these
gene races. If Mister Mu can help us, those two assholes will
die.”</p>
<p>“This Mister Mu you speak of, is he the mister that guards Ice
Snow God Temple?” Si Tu Ya was shocked and happy.</p>
<p>Gong Shu Zhi said gnashed his teeth and said, “Yes. Regardless
if he can beat Dou Tian Yu, against Mister Mu, he will die.”</p>
