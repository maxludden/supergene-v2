<h2>Blue Blood Appears</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3000</h3>

<p>While everyone was watching, a man and a woman approached Han
Sen, who was still repeating his actions with the light scissors.
He was unable to get out of it. He had no other choice.</p>
<p>“Who are these two guys?” Although Han Sen was stuck in a loop,
his mind was not caught in the cycle. He was still lucid and aware.
He felt weird as he watched the man and a woman walk in front of
him.</p>
<p>Because the red umbrella’s light fell, he was not able to see
who the man and women beneath the umbrella were.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to know the answer, and every other creature in
the universe wanted to know the answer too.</p>
<p>In Space Garden, Wang Yuhang spoke with worry. He said, “These
two guys can bypass the restrictions of Moment’s End power. Are Han
Sen and the others going to be OK?”</p>
<p>“If those two are going there, they must be enemies,” Wangfu
Jing said with a frown. “Han Sen and the others will undoubtedly be
in danger.”</p>
<p>“Go save him!” Xie Qing King stood up. His eyes were on fire as
he spoke.</p>
<p>“Don’t do it,” Moment Queen said as she coldly leaned against
the doorframe. “It is pointless for you to go. You will just fall
into the time loop created by Moment’s End. You cannot help.”</p>
<p>“So, what?” Xie Qing King asked. “Are we not going to even try?
Are we just going to sit here and watch them all die?”</p>
<p>“Brother Xie, do not be in such a rush,” Zero said. “Moment
Queen is right. If we go now, it is useless. It will only lead to
the death of more of us.”</p>
<p>“This won’t work, and that won’t work,” Wang Yuhang said with a
look of annoyance. “We can only watch San Mu die.”</p>
<p>Moment Queen coldly said, “There is no need to be in a rush. Han
Sen and the others won’t die easily. In Moment’s End, time will
remain in a fixed loop. Even if the man and woman seek to kill
them, after killing them, the time loop will only result in them
being revived. To kill them permanently, they must break Moment’s
End. If Moment’s End breaks, Han Sen and Dollar can fight back. If
they cannot fight, they can at least run.” “How could I forget all
that?” Wang Yuhang was very happy. They all were and felt a major
relief.</p>
<p>“If they cannot kill Han Sen, what is the point of them going
there?” Qin Xuan quietly asked.</p>
<p>No one was able to answer that question. They could only look
into Moment God Temple and see the man and the woman’s
movements.</p>
<p>The red-clothed woman stood behind the man while holding an
umbrella. The man was standing in front of Han Sen, and he was
inspecting him thoroughly. He watched him keep repeating the
movement of releasing the power of the light scissors. After a
while, the man reached out his hand. It landed on Han Sen’s
head.</p>
<p>The hand was wrapped in a red mist. One was able to vaguely see
the semblance of a face. The man’s 10 fingers were very long. They
appeared powerful. It gave people a strange feeling</p>
<p>“What does he want to do?” Sky Palace Leader frowned and looked
at the man’s hands. He could not guess what that man wanted to
do.</p>
<p>“He is not going to one-palm slap Han Sen to death, is he? What
if he does slap him to death? In the middle of Moment’s End, Han
Sen can keep reviving.” Sky Palace’s first seat was confused.</p>
<p>In fact, in the universe, every scary elite was watching this
scene with a look of profound confusion.</p>
<p>Only in a house perched upon an old mountain, where an old man
was holding a bottle gourd of wine, was there a difference. He
watched the man’s hand. As he did, his eyes flashed as he
exclaimed, “Finally, he is making the first step!”</p>
<p>When the old fortune-teller spoke to himself, the man’s other
hand flashed with a cold light. He cut the hand that was on top of
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Every elite was shocked. They watched his injured hand with
bated breath. They were unsure what the man planned to do.</p>
<p>Beautiful blue blood oozed out of the wound. It was crystal-like
and glowing. It was as weird as it was beautiful to see.</p>
<p>When he saw the blood, Han Sen was shocked. He thought, “What is
going on? This blue blood and Blood Legion blue blood has the same
power, but this is much more powerful than the blue blood I saw
before. Who is he? Human King? What is he doing here? Why is he
doing this?”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mind was riddled with questions, but no one was able
to answer him. Besides, he could not ask because he was still stuck
in a time loop. Aside from repeating his actions, he was unable to
do anything.</p>
<p>“Holy blood.” When Sky Palace Leader and Sky Palace’s first seat
saw the blue blood, their expressions changed.</p>
<p>Just like them, the expressions of many old antiques across the
entire universe were changed. They all looked as if they had seen a
ghost.</p>
<p>One drop of crystal-looking blue blood was allowed to drip onto
Han Sen’s head. Where the blood dripped, his black hair and white
scalp turned blue.</p>
<p>The man’s hand was resting on Han Sen’s head. He allowed the
wound on his hand to drip blood, one drop after one drop, onto Han
Sen’s head.</p>
<p>Moment’s End was able to make this keep repeating. After
repeating, Han Sen’s head, which was dyed blue, was still blue. It
did not get wiped out by the time cycle.</p>
<p>More blue blood being released. It flowed through Han Sen’s hair
and down his face. His entire head, face, and neck had turned blue.
The blood was now seeping into his clothes. It was like it was
going to dye his entire body blue.</p>
<p>“This guy. What does he want? I am not a blue fairy. Why dye my
body blue?” Han Sen had countless thoughts, but he could not figure
out what the man wanted from him.</p>
<p>All the elites of every race were frozen as they watched this
happen. No one was able to understand why this man had suddenly
appeared. No one knew what he wanted.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>From the highest floor of the god palace in the geno hall, noise
that was like thunder sounded. The geno hall’s door slowly
opened.</p>
<p>The geno hall’s door completely opened. The light inside was
bright. It was too bright to see what was in there. One was only
able to see a body was there. It was standing inside. Because the
light was so bright, it was impossible to see what the body looked
like. Whoever it was, they had the presence of a god or demon. The
suppressing pressure unleashed by that presence was felt everywhere
in the universe. It was difficult for anyone to breathe. It felt as
if everyone had to kowtow before it.</p>
<p>“Are you really going to do it?” The body standing at the door
was looking at the man on Moment God Temple’s plaza.</p>
<p>“You can try and stop me,” the man coldly said. His hand was
still atop Han Sen’s head, allowing his blue blood to keep dripping
all over Han Sen.</p>
<p>“How dare you.” The God Spirits were mad. All the god temples
burst open with god light. Countless scary god powers flew out. It
was like many God Spirits were going to kill the man beneath the
red umbrella.</p>
<p>“If I did not dare, how did I kill a sky full of God Spirits?”
The man’s voice was calm like undisturbed water. When he spoke, the
many God Spirits were furious. All the god lights of every god
temple exploded like a volcanic eruption. The sky full of God
Spirits were breaking out of their temples.</p>
<p>The creatures of the universe felt a massive chill as they
watched all of this unfold. Even though the suppressive feelings of
the God Spirits weren’t coming after them, it made them feel
shocked and have a desire to flee.</p>
<p>The man behaved as if he did not even see the fires wielded by
the God Spirits. He still stood where he was. He let his blue blood
keep dribbling onto Han Sen.</p>
