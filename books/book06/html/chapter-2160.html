<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Yuya and the others were fighting hard when they heard an explosion echo from afar. There was a light blooming among all those xenogeneics.</p>

<p>The swarm of xenogeneics all started to churn, as if they were super nervous.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>There was another explosion, and its sound made the Marquises’ ears hurt. A mushroom cloud rose visibly over the landscape this time. The shockwave spread, and swathes of the dragonflies were blown into nothing but bits.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Many more mushroom clouds exploded amidst the army of xenogeneics that had descended upon them. Great numbers of the dragonflies were destroyed, and the ensuing vacuum sucked living dragonflies back into the wreckage.</p>

<p>A red shadow emerged from the dust and haze. It looked like a man holding a rocket launcher, and again and again, rockets leaped out of the cylindrical launcher. Everything in sight was being blown to pieces.</p>

<p>Rockets exploded continually, creating mushroom clouds. The metal ground and the dragonflies were being sundered in equal measure, as bodies and metallic chunks were strewn across the region in a mind-blowing display of carnage.</p>

<p>Over the wreckage and corpses drifted fire, smoke, and dust. The red shadow was like a crazy killer. It moved forward steadily as it fired rockets, reducing the whole place to ruin and rubble.</p>

<p>On the shoulders of that crazy red shadow was what looked like a six-year-old girl. She seemed curious, and she kept looking around. Her calm expression was a ridiculously stark contrast to the insanity of the explosions destroying everything around them.</p>

<p>“Han Sen!” Yuya and the Sky Palace students, upon seeing the shape of the body more clearly, began to cheer.</p>

<p>They thought Han Sen had been murdered by the white Metal Beast, which had appeared to single him out. But instead of being killed, he showed up when they needed help the most.</p>

<p>Seeing that Han Sen’s rockets could blow up both Marquise and Duke xenogeneics, it was obvious that his power had increased in the time they had spent apart. It appeared to them as if he must have reached Marquise class. Otherwise, there was no way he could have brought harm to those beings.</p>

<p>Han Sen had intended to rejoin the Sky Palace team when the storm ceased, as he wanted to remain in the cave and drink as much of that metal xenogeneic fluid as he could. But the Sky Palace students were in danger, and so he decided he had no choice but to leave the metal city.</p>

<p>“This guy. Did he just become a Marquise?” When Dragon Nine saw the strength of those rockets, he froze up stiff. He could not believe a Marquise could possess such power.</p>

<p>Dragon Eight was shocked, as well. He wouldn’t even dare to try to withstand one of those rockets, even with his gold dragon body active. It was really difficult to believe that a Marquise possessed such power. And on top of all that, the attacks were long-range and area of effect. They weren’t single-target attacks only.</p>

<p>Seeing the Dukes that Han Sen was knocking out of the sky, Kahn’s face looked ashen. “What frightening power. And it’s coming from the body of someone that is only a Marquise? If he had become a Marquise sooner, perhaps he could have fought against Dollar and Lone Bamboo.”</p>

<p>“What is his geno art? What makes him so powerful and scary? Across the whole universe, I am afraid that Mister Han has to have the most impressive geno art by a wide margin. Not even Dollar or Lone Bamboo would be able to fight him,” a Buddha Marquise whispered in awe.</p>

<p>Everyone listening actually agreed with what the Buddha Marquise had said. That power was something they had never expected to see from a Marquise. Even if Dragon Eight used his Evilbreaker Dragon powers to summon his maximum strength, it wouldn’t compare to the power of each of those rockets.</p>

<p>The scariest thing about this, though, was the attack being an area of effect. The power was so strong, it was difficult to believe it all came from a Marquise.</p>

<p>Under Han Sen’s attacks, the fearless xenogeneics started to shake and shiver. Han Sen was like a walking cannon, merrily killing each and every xenogeneic he could see. Even Dukes were being blown up with ease, all by the might of those explosions.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>The whole ground trembled. The xenogeneics were squealing. The explosions were sounding from everywhere across the land.</p>

<p>If there was ever a matter a rocket could not solve, he’d just use another.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Han Sen held his rocket launcher like a minigun. He kept firing at the swarm, and the shockwaves and clouds melted the xenogeneics in the throttling haze.</p>

<p>“Marquise Xenogeneic Hunted…”</p>

<p>The killing announcements kept overlapping. It was all mixed up, and Han Sen couldn’t properly discern what was being said.</p>

<p>This wasn’t just the power he had gained when Spell became a Marquise. This was Han Sen’s power combined with the Break Six Skies art he had just learned.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s power was scary, there was no doubt. He was definitely the best out of all the Marquises now. And the impacts he could deliver via Break Six Skies could enable him to kill everything that was coming at him. He felt as if he could destroy a galactic warship.</p>

<p>When Spell became a Marquise, Han Sen had nothing to do. So, he spent the remainder of his free time researching Break Six Skies. His Dongxuan Sutra and deified spectacles made Break Six Skies incredibly simple for him to learn.</p>

<p>Han Sen used a couple of tricks of his own, too. Not even he could handle the full extent of Break Six Skies at close range, so he infused their powers with Spell’s projectiles. Firing them from a distance would not hurt him.</p>

<p>So, this was the perfect marriage. The rockets and the bullets had the power of Break Six Skies. Although Han Sen had only learned the first tier, his rocket launcher was already very strong.</p>

<p>Not even a Duke could withstand it. The rocket’s power suppressed the whole xenogeneic army.</p>

<p>Dragon Eight and Yuya moved to help Han Sen, but they soon stopped. They just stood back and admired Han Sen’s handiwork.</p>

<p>Ruins, bodies, and smoke were all that was left in his wake. The whole xenogeneic host had been blown to pieces by Han Sen. He gave an evil chuckle.</p>

<p>Everything around Han Sen was exploding. Everyone was thinking, “This guy has destroyed more than those fucking Destroyed did. It’s like he is one of the Destroyed!”</p>

<p>The xenogeneics were running now. The whole place was like a graveyard in the middle of hell itself.</p>

<p>Han Sen held his rocket launcher casually, the little girl still perched upon his shoulder. He approached the Marquises from the ruins. Dragon Eight and the others felt a large chill strike them. They couldn’t help but stumble backward.</p>

<p>Yuya, are you okay?” Han Sen asked, looking over the fighters assembled before him.</p>

<p>“No… Yes. I mean, we are okay.” Yuya was too shocked to answer him appropriately. His brain had lagged for a moment, but it slowly started to function again, now that he had been asked a question.</p>

<p>“Teacher Han, your geno art is too cool!” White Real blurted out without any self-consciousness.</p>

<p>“That was awesome!”</p>

<p>“This skill is invincible!”</p>

<p>“He blew up Dukes! This is crazy.”</p>

<p>“If Teacher Han is a Marquise, Dollar won’t be considered the number one Marquise anymore. That’s for sure.”</p>

<p>All the students spoke about this happily. They all referred to Han Sen with the teacher title, as all the explosions had been incredibly impressive. They admired him too much to speak as if they were on the same level.</p>
