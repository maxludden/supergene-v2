  "Sacred-blood beast soul aura… Sacred-blood beast soul add-on… Sacred-blood shapeshifting beast soul… Sacred-blood beast soul weapon… Sacred-blood wings…" Zhong Zhenhong could not help reading the beast soul list out loud. His voice became more grim every time he finished reading one. Even his hand holding the document was shaking.

He knew very well what these beast souls meant. Although humans had developed in God’s Sanctuary for almost 2 decades and there were more and more who could kill a sacred-blood creature, it did not mean it was an easy thing to hunt sacred-blood creatures. More than 90% of humans could never hunt a sacred-blood creature, let alone gain a sacred-blood blood beast soul.

However, the beast souls listed in this document were almost all the most outstanding sacred-blood beast souls. Especially the sacred-blood beast soul aura, which was the blessing of any team.

Other beast souls were also highly coveted. Although all Zhong Zhenhong saw were names on the list, they were enough to make him feel shocked.

So many top-notch sacred-blood beast souls all belonged to the same person. He could not imagine who this person must be. Even if he was the descendent of some impressive figure, it was still very hard to collect all these beast souls.

If these sacred-blood beast souls were used on a special squad, Zhong Zhenhong could imagine how awesome the special squad would become. It would be much easier for them to hunt sacred-blood creatures in the future.

In Zhong Zhenhong’s eyes, these top-notch sacred-blood beast souls could be used to make an elite team.

If Zhong Zhenhong were to learn that all he had seen was only a part of the beast souls Han Sen owned, while the rest were sold to Lin Beifeng and Su Xiaoqiao, his chin might even fall to the floor.

Zhong Zhenhong quickly turned the document to the last page, because he could not wait to see who it was to own all these sacred-blood beast souls. He could not believe that someone like this was in the special squad, and he could not put a finger on someone immediately.

Normally speaking, those who worked for the special squad would not be the descendent of a celebrity. People with prominent backgrounds would more likely be those who enjoyed the protection from the special squad and never needed to protect anyone else. Therefore, Zhong Zhenhong could not imagine who would have such impressive collection in the special squad.

"Han Sen!" Seeing this name, Zhong Zhenhong couldn’t help feeling dazed.

"Director, do you want to speak to him? He is still waiting for a reply," seeing that Zhong Zhenhong had finished reading, Jiang Sheng followed up.

"Of course. These beast souls are crucial to us, and we must have them. What are his requests?" Zhong Zhenhong said seriously.

"He is asking for a quota for his sister to be protected starting from the moment she entered God’s Sanctuary. In addition, he had asked us to send sacred-blood beast souls of four specific types to his sister as soon as possible after she entered God’s Sanctuary…" Jiang Sheng explained Han Sen’s request in details.

After hearing that, Zhong Zhenhong pondered and then said, "With Han Sen’s background, I am surprised that he is able to earn such a fortune. Contact him and agree to what he asked. Prepare a contract and sign it as soon as possible."

Because of Qin Xuan, Zhong Zhenhong had paid attention to Han Sen before. However, previously he was still doubtful about Han Sen’s ability, especially when Han Sen disappeared in God’s Sanctuary for a long while, which made Zhong Zhenhong quite disappointed in him.

However, after seeing the beast souls of Han Sen, Zhong Zhenhong found that he had given Han Sen too little credit. The man discovered by Lady Qin was indeed extraordinary.

"It seems that Han Sen is indeed a rare talent. I wonder where he would end up after entering Second God’s Sanctuary. I hope that he could return to the special squad as soon as possible, because it would be such a waste for a talent like this to be wandering around." Zhong Zhenhong made a note in his comlink and wrote down Han Sen’s name, which meant he would pay special attention to Han Sen.

Han Sen did not sell most of his beast souls but used them to purchase an insurance for his sister, helping her grow fast. In Han Sen’s eyes, there was nothing in the world more important than the safety of his family, so the beast souls were quite well spent.

In addition, the four types of beast souls he requested for his sister would be immensely helpful when she was about to kill a super creature, so it was a good deal after all.

However, Han Sen did not know where he would be assigned in Second God’s Sanctuary, so it was impossible for him to trade his beast souls for some beast souls of Second God’s Sanctuary. He had to arrange for that after she evolved.

But Han Sen had no use of mediocre beast souls. Although he traded away most of his sacred-blood beast souls, he still had all the super beast souls and the sacred-blood beast souls that were indispensable to him.

Currently, Han Sen had seven super beast souls in total. They were: water reaper, cursed wolf, bloody slayer, golden growler, golden rock worm king, holy angel, and desert bird.

The sacred-blood beast souls would not be that useful in Second God’s Sanctuary, so Han Sen traded most of them away, only keeping beetle knight, fairy queen, and Meowth.

Initially, Han Sen also wanted to keep purple-feathered dragon and color shifter. However, after looking through the information about Second God’s Sanctuary, Han Sen found that there were a lot of flying creatures in Second God’s Sanctuary, many of which had much higher speed than the wings he had currently. Therefore, the sacred-blood wings were not that valuable anymore. In addition, he had two super pets which could both fly. He could totally do without the beast soul wings.

Color shifter was not that useful in Second God’s Sanctuary either. If he was to hide himself, changing the color alone was no longer enough in Second God’s Sanctuary, where there were many creatures that had very strong sense of smell and perception. They could probably sense his body temperature. In the end, Han Sen gave up the color shifter as well.

Keeping Meowth was simply for sentimental reasons. He had really considered Meowth as his own pet. The doppelgänger that the beetle knight could turn into would still be very useful in Second God’s Sanctuary, so he decided to keep it as well.

As for the fairy queen, it was not easy to find a humanoid shapeshifting beast soul like that, not even in Second God’s Sanctuary. In addition, it was Han Sen’s reward of the contest, so he kept it as well.

At this point, Han Sen was still faced with one difficult problem. Without solving that problem, he could not evolve with a peaceful mind.

The problem was not Zero of course. Although Zero was also a problem, Han Sen believed he should be able to get rid of her after he evolved to Second God’s Sanctuary, which was why he was not that worried about it.

The thing worried Han Sen the most was the black crystal. It could even feed and help creatures evolve. If he could continue to use such a treasure in Second God’s Sanctuary, it would be very helpful to his cultivation.

If he was able to farm a super creature in Second God’s Sanctuary, or even just a few of sacred-blood creatures, he would become strong much faster. If he was able to get some beast souls out of it, it would be even better.

The only issue was that Han Sen was not able to take back crystal out of God’s Sanctuary.

It was part of the rules of God’s Sanctuary. Except for beast souls, nothing in God’s Sanctuary could be brought out. Han Sen had tried for a lot of times, and unfortunately, the same rule applied to the black crystal.
