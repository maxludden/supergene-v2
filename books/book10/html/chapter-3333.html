<p>Han Sen ignored the purple copper sword. He used the Dongxuan
Aura, wanting to find the native creatures the purple copper sword
mentioned.</p>
<p>With his power, controlling a native and having them pick up his
sword would not be difficult.</p>
<p>When the Dongxuan Aura was cast, Han Sen knew things were as
simple as he thought they would be. The weapon forest around had a
powerful presence. Every weapon had its own presence.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Aura was weakened by all those presences. He had
only been able to cast his presence out at a radius of around 10
miles. He could not send it out any further than that, and that was
just his observation power. If he wanted to use his power to
control the native creatures, he would have to be even closer to
them wherever they were.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the purple copper sword could feel Han Sen’s
Dongxuan Aura. He said, “Do not waste your energy. Let’s not say
your power can even stretch beyond the weapon forest, but even if
you could go past it, you cannot control the natives. The natives
are protected by Soldier Weapon Sky. If you touch them, they will
be restricted by the rules that govern Soldier Weapon Sky.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, he frowned. “Can I really not use power
to control the natives? If that cannot be done, how can they pick
us up?”</p>
<p>The purple copper sword wanted to say something, but only a
sudden sigh was heard. Soon after, the sword body started to
shake.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt it sooner than the purple copper sword did. It
surprised Han Sen. About 500 miles away, there was seven- or
eight-year-old wearing armor. She was traveling through the weapon
forest.</p>
<p>“Is that a native of the 33 skies? Why is a human girl here?”
Han Sen felt weird.</p>
<p>Before the 33 skies returned to origin, he had never seen a
human shadow in the 33 skies. Now, he was seeing a little human
girl. That gave him a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>If a human could survive there, it meant he should have been
able to regain his human form. Unfortunately, he was still stuck as
a jian.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword tried its best to shake his sword body.
He released a very small humming sound. He was trying to lure the
little girl over. Han Sen’s heart jumped. He immediately used the
Dongxuan Aura on the little girl. He was trying to draw the little
girl closer.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The moment the Dongxuan Aura touched the little girl, Han Sen
felt as if his body was given an electric shock. The Dongxuan Aura
suddenly broke. His body was shaking like a loon. If he had a
mouth, he would be screaming in pain.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword was very happy. “Ha! Ha! I told you a
long time ago. This is the consequence of not listening to your
elders. Now you understand its power.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was not annoyed. He coldly asked, “So, you did the same
thing, too? Otherwise, how would you know what it is like?”</p>
<p>The purple copper sword grunted and did not speak. He kept using
the sword to make a humming sound to draw the attention of the
little girl.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew what the purple copper sword was trying to do, but
he did not learn how to shake his body. He decided to just sit and
watch.</p>
<p>“Why are you frozen there?” the purple copper sword asked Han
Sen as he kept shaking his sword self. “Should you not be trying to
make more noise, generate attention, and garner her interest in
coming over here?”</p>
<p>“Is it not enough that you draw her over here?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword heard that and got mad. “Make more
noise! There will be a higher chance of attracting her this way. If
you are not going to make an effort, do not try to fight me
later.”</p>
<p>“Why would I try and fight you?” Han Sen asked with a smile. “If
you decide to come my way, I can tell you that it will not be my
fault.”</p>
<p>“You mother… You won’t put any effort in, yet you are still
planning on reaping all the benefits,” the purple copper sword
said. “How can there be something so good in this world? Not even I
would do something like that.” He stopped shaking his sword
self.</p>
<p>“Whatever.” Han Sen looked as if he did not care.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword coldly grunted and stopped talking. The
little girl seemed to have heard the sound of the purple copper
sword earlier. She was walking in their direction.</p>
<p>When the purple copper sword stopped, the little girl lost her
direction and started walking far away. She was walking further and
further away.</p>
<p>“I can tell you that there are not many natives around,” the
purple copper sword said with worry. “You might not see another for
at least half a month. If you miss out on this chance, who knows
how much longer you might have to wait. You need to think about
it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak. He only used the Dongxuan Aura to look at
the little girl.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen not talk, the purple copper sword said, “Work
with me and attract the little girl. That way, we all have rewards
to reap. If you are only here for freebies, I am not going to do
anything that might benefit you.”</p>
<p>“I will still say the same thing,” Han Sen replied. “It is all
up to you.”</p>
<p>The purple copper sword was very angry. He was shaking. Upon
seeing the little girl walk further and further away, Han Sen was
continuing to not do anything. The purple copper sword gnashed his
teeth and said, “I will lure her here. Do not dare try and fight me
for her.”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen said anything, he tried his best to shake his
sword body. He made some moaning sword-like sounds. He was afraid
the girl would walk too far away and no longer hear the moaning
call.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the girl had not walked too far away. After hearing
the sound of the moaning sword, she listened to it for a while. She
decided to follow the acoustic’s direction.</p>
<p>Not long later, the little girl came before Han Sen and the
purple copper sword. Her big eyes drifted around. She was trying to
find out where the sword moaning sound had come from.</p>
<p>“You just sit and wait,” the purple copper sword said as he kept
shaking his sword body. “When I have recovered my power, I will be
able to help you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored him. He started shaking his body too. He also
generated some moaning sounds.</p>
<p>Hearing the moaning sounds, the little girl turned to look at
Han Sen. She looked shocked. It seemed as if she had no idea which
way to go first.</p>
<p>“You… obscene…” The purple copper sword was exhibiting an aura
of anger. The sword moaning became louder.</p>
<p>“You are not bad,” Han Sen said. “If I have guessed things
correctly, the natives cannot just randomly take a weapon. You are
in so much of a rush, so I assume the natives can only take one
weapon at a time.”</p>
<p>“What is this nonsense you are talking about?” The purple copper
sword paused and said, “I don’t know anything about that.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw his reaction to that, he knew he was
correct.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t that way, then it does not matter which one of us
is pulled out first. If I get pulled out, I will come back and help
you.” Han Sen kept shaking his jian body to make a loud noise.</p>
<p>“I attracted her first. You should let me be pulled out first.”
The purple copper sword tried its best. The cries of the sword
became louder.</p>
<p>“That all depends on which of us she likes more. If she does not
like you, you cannot force her.” Han Sen tried harder.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very strong. The purple copper sword had already
enticed the little girl and wasted so much effort to do so, yet the
black jian’s voice was able to shroud and cover up the purple
copper sword.</p>
<p>The little girl was attracted by the loud jian noise. She
started walking over to Han Sen. The purple copper sword roared and
yelled, “I am going to fight you!”</p>
<p>A sword moan exploded again to cover Han Sen’s jian. Han Sen was
not weak either. He increased the volume of his moaning jian.</p>
<p>“Argh!” The two of them fought. It resulted in the girl
screaming. She held her ears, looking as if she was in pain. She
turned around and left.</p>
<p>“No… Don’t go…” Han Sen and the purple copper sword screamed at
the same time, but the girl could not hear them.</p>
