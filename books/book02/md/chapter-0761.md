  There was no use turning back now, and Han Sen opted to push on and find out what was going on. The super creatures they had encountered all seemed to ignore them, as if something greater attracted them. If he came to a place where they all had gathered together, he resolved to go around them and simply continue on his way.

Han Sen, with Zhou Yumei in tow, continued walking in the same direction. The fairy was still inside the scallop shell, refusing to come out. Whether or not she could by now was still up in the air, as her entire body was rotting. In a few more days, she'd most likely be melted into a bloody goop entirely.

But unless it wanted to exit the shell, there was nothing Han Sen could do. The shell was unbreakable, and if the fairy wanted to come out, he assumed it would have to be of her own volition.

The weather was surprisingly volatile in the desert. It often became windy, spurring the sands high into the sky and obscuring their vision. During the extremely windy periods, the sands rose like monsters seeking to consume them wholly.

Han Sen told Golden Roarer to maximize its size, and it looked like a little hill marching through the fierce sandstorms. Han Sen and the rest of his companions would then burrow into the Golden Roarer's fur to remain comfy and unaffected.

"It's a shame that Golden Roarer is only a super creature from the First Shelter. If it could evolve, it would most likely be greater than any other Second Shelter super creature." Han Sen sighed.

The sandstorms left almost as quickly as they came. After half a day, they all stopped. But it was the lasting effects that were the most troublesome. Following the sandstorms, the landscape morphed. The rhino's footprints disappeared and the dunes changed their positions.

Pat!

Han Sen heard a clapping noise, and he turned around to see Zhou Yumei slapping her cheeks. He laughed and said, "Why are you hitting yourself?"

"There is a mosquito." Zhou Yumei continued to wave her hands around, all to no avail.

Han Sen took a look and saw a small mosquito flying around her. It was pretty quick and surprisingly agile. No matter how much she tried to hit it, the mosquito perfectly evaded every attack.

Pat!

Han Sen clapped his hands and killed the mosquito in one hit.

> "Mutant Creature Bloodlust Mosquito Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Eat The Flesh Of The Mutant Creature Bloodlust Mosquito To Gain Zero To Ten Geno Points Randomly."

Han Sen was incredibly surprised, having not suspected the small mosquito to be a mutant creature.

Buzz!

A few more mosquitos showed up, which Han Sen promptly killed. After that, even more showed up. They flew around madly, producing an infuriating sound.

Pat! Pat! Pat!

Han Sen attacks were quick as lightning, and he was killing mosquitos left, right, and center. There were ordinary class creatures this time, as well as many mutant class variants.

After killing all of them, Han Sen noticed Zhou Yumei looked frozen. She was staring at something ahead of them with an agape jaw. Her face was distorted into one of fright, as if she had seen something most wretched.

"What's wrong with you?" Han Sen frowned.

"Mo-mo-mosquito..." Zhou Yumei raised her finger, pointing ahead of them. With a trembling voice, she called out what made her look so scared.

"What? They're just mosquitos. There is no need to be afraid, I can clap-kill them all." Han Sen then turned to look in the direction she pointed towards and noticed a giant crack in the desert sands. From it, swarms of the mosquitos emerged like a geyser. In their countless numbers, they turned to face them. And like the very sandstorms they had weathered before, they inked the skies and blotted out the sun. It was if the clouds of mosquitoes had turned the day into night.

"What are you waiting for? Run!" Han Sen shouted. He grabbed Zhou Yumei and carried her underneath his armpit, while running.

The Bloodlust Mosquitos conquered the skies like a sandstorm, and they even struck fear into the silver fox and Little Orange. Together, those two scrambled to get away.

If it was just a small number of mosquitos, even at mutant class, there was nothing to be afraid of. But a countless horde such as that would be too much. Han Sen had the appropriate super armor to block the attacks, but Zhou Yumei would be killed in an instant.

Furthermore, he'd feel bad wearing super armor in front of her. So, like she did, he wore sacred-blood class armor instead.

If there were large numbers of sacred-blood class mosquitos, he was afraid they'd be enough to kill the silver fox and Little Orange, as well.

It wasn't long before the mosquitos caught up and descended upon them, however. The silver lightning crackled across the silver fox's fur, and he emitted a number of bolts to zap those that sought to overwhelm him.

Han Sen used his Flaming Rex Spike to incinerate the mosquitos around them.

Little Orange's body was jumping up and down to kill many, but a fair number of the mosquitos had already latched onto it. Without reprieve, the hungry insects drank deep of its blood.

Han Sen was well and truly shocked. He didn't expect the mosquitos to be able to drink the blood of a super creature, and that meant Little Orange and the silver fox were in as much danger as they were.

Although only female mosquitoes could drink blood, their numbers were still scary enough to place them all in serious danger.

Pat!

Han Sen slapped a mosquito that was drinking Little Orange's blood.

> "Sacred-Blood Bloodlust Mosquito Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Eat The Flesh Of The Sacred-Blood Creature Bloodlust Mosquito To Gain Zero To Ten Geno Points Randomly."

"There really are sacred-blood class variants amongst them." Han Sen's face changed, and he commanded the little angel to clear a path for them. Then, he sped up to attempt an escape. But the mosquitos were like a sandstorm, and more and more were coming to engulf them.

The silver fox was doing better than all of them, however. The electricity on his body worked like a shield, and it prevented the mosquitos from landing on him.

But for the others, they were slowly being swarmed by the fiends. Numerous mosquitoes were starting to land on them, especially Zhou Yumei. Although she was plated in armor, the sections of skin that were still showing were ripe for a biting. Her blood kept on being sucked.

The mosquitos weren't deadly on their own, and even if they sucked until their bellies were full, it wasn't much blood to lose. But with this number of them bearing down, things were dire. Within seconds, Zhou Yumei's body was host to a large number of lumps.

Sucking her blood was fine, but the lumps were driving her insane. They were itchy, and each of her ten fingers went into overdrive, scratching as fiercely as she could. She was doing it so much, blood was being drawn to the surface. And as people say, the more you scratch, the itchier it gets. It wasn't long before her skin was all frayed, and yet she couldn't resist scratching.

Han Sen tried his best to fight off the mosquitos, but his efforts seemed to be in vain. There were too many of them for him to handle. Even Little Orange's body had been swarmed, and many mosquitos were helping themselves to a buffet of blood on its backside.

The bodies of the super creatures were far better than Zhou Yumei's, that much was plain to see. The itch didn't seem to affect them at all, so the effects of the bloodsucking didn't seem so concerning.

The silver fox continued to fire electricity, but it was clearly a drain on his energy reserves. Han Sen wasn't sure how much longer it could last.

Han Sen felt really bad in his heart. He couldn't find a way to give Zhou Yumei the immediate aid and respite she needed right now.

If this was to continue, Zhou Yumei seemed likely to die out here.

While Han Sen contemplated his next move, he suddenly saw a white fog approaching. When the mosquitos came into contact with it, they fell to the ground like hard rain.
