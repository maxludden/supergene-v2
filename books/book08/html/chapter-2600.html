<p>Gu Qingcheng’s face was breathtakingly pretty. Even those who
were close with her, like Han Sen, would find themselves staring at
her ethereal beauty now and again. The Very High man had only
looked at her for a moment or two before turning away. He had an
impressive amount of self-control.</p>
<p>Exquisite looked at her as well. But her vision paused on Han
Sen for longer. After all, he was seated in a place of honor. That
meeting had no deifieds. All the attendees were young elites, but
if someone was sitting in the first seat, it had to mean that they
were someone of prestige and importance to the Sky Palace.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Han Sen wasn’t looking good. He looked dry
and thin, like a refugee that had spent too long without food. He
was only skin and bones.</p>
<p>“How might I refer to you?” Exquisite asked, looking at Han Sen.
She had seen Han Sen’s videos, but that was before he incurred his
most recent injuries. He looked completely different right now, so
she didn’t recognize him.</p>
<p>“I am Han Sen,” Han Sen answered truthfully.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Han Sen’s name, that Very High man couldn’t help
but turn to look at him. He clearly knew about Han Sen and what he
had accomplished.</p>
<p>“You are the one who owns the Charming God’s Jian and the Shield
of the Medusa’s Gaze? It is no wonder you look so special,”
Exquisite said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>By “special,” she was referring to his physical appearance. She
wasn’t really complimenting him.</p>
<p>From what she could see, Han Sen had simply lucked out by
collecting two true god treasures. He was lucky and nothing more;
that was her general conclusion. She believed the true merit of his
power was nothing substantial.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face looked sour. He didn’t respond. He knew that
Exquisite wasn’t actually complimenting him. “If no one has any
questions, I will start first. Let’s talk about Phenomenon,” the
man said calmly.</p>
<p>After the man said this, the expressions on the faces of the
students of the Sky Palace looked somewhat strained. Phenomenon was
a secret Sky Palace geno art, although it wasn’t as special as the
Textless Book.</p>
<p>When the man said he wanted to talk about Phenomenon, it was his
way of saying, “The way you practice geno arts is bad. Allow me to
show you how it is done.”</p>
<p>The way the man spoke made many of the Sky Palace students
upset. But they were seated before one of the Very High, and so, no
one did anything.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace students stared at the man, waiting to hear what
he was going to tell them.</p>
<p>Han Sen could tell the man had selected this geno art on
purpose. He wanted to use this opportunity to build up his image
before the young people of the Sky Palace. That was why he spoke in
such a condescending way.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to listen to him, too. That Very High man was
called Bixi, and Han Sen was keen to hear what input he could
provide on Phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Phenomenon refers to the universe’s phenomena. Phenomenon is
the reason for life existing. But people are stupid, and they
cannot see through things without phenomena. People require clear
signs to clarify the unknowable.”</p>
<p>The Sky students who heard this weren’t impressed. It was an
ordinary speech that didn’t mean much to them. If they were
required to speak, they would have said the same thing</p>
<p>It seemed as if the man knew what everyone was thinking, and so
he coldly went on to say, “I am one of those people, too. I cannot
get rid of this foolishness. I cannot see through things without
phenomena. So, there is a saying, and it goes like this— ‘only if
you go into phenomena and feel the phenomena, and experience what
is inside, do you have the chance to understand. That is the
so-called Taoism.”</p>
<p>“When I practiced Phenomenon, the teacher talked about this the
first day. Mr. Bixi doesn’t need to explain this, so just get to
the point,” a Sky Palace student said hurriedly. Bixi didn’t speak,
and his face was unreadable.</p>
<p>Since he first met her, Han Sen thought Exquisite merely
pretended to be detached. But now, seeing Bixi, he noticed this
emotionless expression was the only one they were capable of. This
wasn’t a pretense.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows Taoism, but in regards to how they know it,
everyone has a different saying. There is no correct answer,” Bixi
said.</p>
<p>“Taoism is natural. Everyone has their own way of learning it.
An answer isn’t required,” a student of Sky Palace said.</p>
<p>“I just said that a moment ago,” Bixi replied. “Phenomenon
refers to the phenomena of the universe. If there are phenomena,
there are rules. If there are no rules, there would be no reasons.
Then, you would not need to learn it.”</p>
<p>The Sky Palace student fell quiet. He continued listening in
silence.</p>
<p>Bixi set something down on a table in front of him. Everyone
looked at it. It was a square and transparent box that looked to
have been made of crystal. It was a dozen centimeters wide.</p>
<p>Within the box, they could see a crystalline ladybug. It sort of
looked like a beetle. It was fairly cute.</p>
<p>Bixi opened the crystal box, and the ladybug climbed out of it
slowly. Then he said, “Every living creature has a path to follow,
but understanding the reason for each path isn’t easy. This is a
beetle xenogeneic called God Spirit Touch. It is a very rare
xenogeneic. Through this, we can understand some of the rules and
reasons here.”</p>
<p>After that, Bixi reached out his finger. He sliced his finger
and pushed out a drop of his own blood onto the ladybug.</p>
<p>The ladybug opened its mouth and drank that droplet of blood.
And then, it stopped and remained still. It no longer
moved.Everyone was shocked. They didn’t know what Bixi was
doing.</p>
<p>As they watched in confused silence, the ladybug that had sucked
up Bixi’s blood began to show some weird changes.</p>
<p>The ladybug was changing its skin. As it did so, its face
contorted. It pulled its new body forward, leaving a perfect shell
behind.</p>
<p>And the process wasn’t over, either. After changing a layer of
its shell, the ladybug started twisting its body again. It quickly
left a second, smaller shell behind.</p>
<p>The fist-sized ladybug kept changing its skin. Every time it
shed a skin, its body became smaller, and the shells it left behind
were like perfect crystal beetle art. Each discarded shell was
smaller than the last.</p>
<p>As everyone watched, that beetle swapped its skin nine times.
Its body was eventually reduced to the size of a small coin. After
that, it stopped moving. It just laid down where it was, looking
very tired.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Bixi, waiting for his explanation. They had
seen bugs change their skin before, but they didn’t know what it
had to do with what Bixi had been telling them.</p>
<p>“The God Spirit Touch is born very sensitive to blood, and it
can tell you the quality of your birth genes. The stronger the gene
blood, the more effect it will have on the beetle. Ordinarily, the
genes of low-tier creatures can enable a beetle to swap its skin
once or twice. If someone has high-class genes, the beetle can swap
its skin eight to ten times. With my Very High experience, I can
tell you that if someone can make the God Spirit Touch shed its
shell ten times, that means the person conducting the test has
genes that are strong enough to see them one day become a true
god,” Bixi said factually.</p>
