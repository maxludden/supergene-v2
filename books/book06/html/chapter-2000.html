<h2>The Battle Ends</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2000</h3>

<p>The students watched the fight with gaping mouths. Han Sen’s
power didn’t seem as strong as Lone Bamboo’s, but it felt as if the
contestants were somehow even. The situation almost seemed
self-contradictory.</p>
<p>The King class observers noticed Han Sen’s energy, and when they
saw it, they were shocked. They felt the same thing that the
students felt, but they could understand a bit more.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t as powerful as Lone Bamboo, who was a Marquise.
But it seemed that his energy wasn’t being suppressed. He was
getting stronger.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Lone Bamboo’s knifemind was continuing to
grow, Han Sen wasn’t being crushed under the weight.</p>
<p>Both of them were emanating a terrifying intensity, and it was
visible in their eyes. The students that watched the fight were not
seeing Han Sen and Lone Bamboo anymore. It was just an evil demon
fighting a jade-white shadow. When both of them collided, it was
like day and night. Neither of them gained the upper hand, and
neither of them was put down.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Two powers were being pushed to their max. They crossed a
threshold, and Dream Beast was unable to hold back the force they
were letting off. The power spilled out, and many of the students
of Sky Palace felt as if their heads were going to explode.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo roared. He lifted Ghost Teeth Knife above his head
with both hands. He summoned that scary power to strike Han Sen
down.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong and the other elders grimaced. They knew this next
strike would commit a tragedy. There was no way back now.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace sighed. He stood up from his chair and
readied himself to get involved.</p>
<p>Han Sen pointed the jade sword at Lone Bamboo. He was like a
mountain. He did not look scared, and neither did it look as if he
wanted to take a single step back.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo looked frightening. His body and knife combined into
one. His murderous fire erupted like that of a volcano, spewing
into the sky.</p>
<p>Just when everyone thought Lone Bamboo was going to slash, Ghost
Teeth Knife remained in the air and unmoving. Lone Bamboo looked at
Han Sen, or rather, the sword he wielded. When he did, a complex
expression overtook his face.</p>
<p>On a green grassy field, a little girl that was nine years old
was holding a jade sword. She had ponytails. She was practicing
swordskills, and she was obviously a beginner. She accidentally hit
herself on the head and dropped onto the ground. She threw the
sword away and wiped the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>“Wan’er, why are you crying?” a young man asked, smiling. He
crouched down next to her and took her head in a gentle hand.</p>
<p>“Big Brother, I am not practicing with a sword anymore. That
stupid sword just bullied me!” Wan’er said, wiping her tears.</p>
<p>“How could your sword bully you? He is your most loyal, little
guy. If you treat him well, he will be nice to you in return,” the
young man said, as he picked up the jade sword.</p>
<p>Wan’er lifted her lips and said, “I am nice to it. I wipe it
clean and even make it smell good, but even so, it just won’t
listen to me. It’s annoying!”</p>
<p>The young man laughed. He held the jade sword, and as he stood
upon the grass, he began to swing it. That jade sword was light in
his hand, as spry as a dragon in a dance.</p>
<p>“Wan’er, to treat it nice is to understand it. Wiping it clean
is not enough.” The young man stopped practicing, and he handed it
back to the girl and rubbed her on the head.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I hate it. It won’t listen to me. It only listens
to you.” Wan’er sounded mad, but even so, she looked happy.</p>
<p>In a garden, a young man lay down beside a pond and repeatedly
threw up. He was going to puke his guts out.</p>
<p>“Brother, how can you drink like that?” A lady with a big
ponytail walked out of the house. She ran up to the young man and
tried to help him up.</p>
<p>“Ignore me. It is fine,” the man mumbled.</p>
<p>“Brother, to fail is nothing. I know you are the best, and I
know you have what it takes to win. You have to stay strong,” the
lady spoke with sincerity, as she lifted the young man upright.</p>
<p>The young man fell back to the ground and passed out. He was too
heavy to lift without any help.</p>
<p>The lady tried to pull him up, but she was unable to. She ran to
the house and collected a blanket. With it, she covered him. Then,
she sat down near him and prayed to the stars. “If there is a God
up there, I hope you can help my brother and show him the way. I
will do anything for that.”</p>
<p>Under the moon, the man lay on the ground with tears in his
eyes.</p>
<p>“Wan’er.” Lone Bamboo looked at the jade sword and moved his
lips. He did not make a noise, but his eyes said he was thinking of
many things.</p>
<p>“I can’t fall… I can’t fall… If I am going to die… Even with
just a dirty soul left… I have to keep going…” Lone Bamboo’s teeth
shook, but his eyes looked adamant.</p>
<p>The knife’s fire was like a demon in the sky. It was just
fading, rather than being destroyed.</p>
<p>“Lone Bamboo seems to have woken up a little.” The woman next to
the Sky Palace leader sounded surprised.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong and the elders looked happy, but it was only for a
second.</p>
<p>The demon’s roots were deep, and not even a King class could
suppress it completely. It was remarkable that Lone Bamboo had
managed to get his mind back in this condition, but there was no
way he could suppress the desire of the demon.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched Lone Bamboo, surprised. Lone Bamboo controlled
the demon at the very last second. He did not give in to it.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo’s body quivered. He had experienced pain that could
not be described. That scary depression and knifemind were fading
inside him.</p>
<p>Everyone looked so happy. Lone Bamboo pushed the demon back into
his body. Now, he was scarier than a ghost. The Nobles were all
delighted. They had no clue how he had done that.</p>
<p>Han Sen put away his own powers. He lowered the jade sword and
looked at Lone Bamboo. The power was no longer encompassing the
arena.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo threw Ghost Teeth Knife over to Han Sen. He said
simply, “I am a Marquise. I should not fight. You win this
round.”</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up Ghost Teeth Knife and handed over the jade
sword.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo accepted the jade sword, wiped it clean, and
resheathed it in his scabbard. That sword was his most precious
possession.</p>
<p>Seeing Lone Bamboo leave, Han Sen spoke to himself. “His body
contains a demon, but his heart possesses an angel. Strange
man.”</p>
<p>No one expected the scary spectacle to end this way, but it
didn’t affect the overall excitement.</p>
<p>A long time after that fight came to an end, people continued to
talk about it. Those who watched that fight didn’t forget the
appearance of the fighters. They would never forget.</p>
