<p>Human King grabbed Ji Yanran’s hands. Black and grey light was released. It was like many mysterious spells created a chain that ensnared Ji Yanran’s body.</p>

<p>Han Ling’er jumped up off the ground. She wanted to attack Human King again. Before she could do anything, Human King said, “Right now, her life is connected to mine. If I am hurt, she will suffer too. If you are not afraid of her dying alongside me, then I dare you to try and harm her.” “You… obscene…” Han Ling’er was so mad and angry, but she did not actually do anything.</p>

<p>“Kid, this is an adult world. It is dirtier than you think.” Human King’s face did not change. He tightened the grasp of his fingers. It made the trapping spell he had put on Ji Yanran hold her with greater force. Ji Yanran looked as if she was suffocating.</p>

<p>“Let go of my mother!” Han Ling’er was furious, but she did not dare rush forward. She was so small. Her mind was still not mature enough to fight Human King. Although she had a powerful power, she could not fight someone like Human King.</p>

<p>Human King ignored her. He turned to Littleflower and said, “I will count to three. Take back your holy spirit. Otherwise, I will erase her from existence. Soul and body, it will all be gone.” “One… Two… Three…” Human King did not stop. He counted to three. His hands were going to close completely.</p>

<p>“Hang on!” Han Littleflower screamed, but Human King did not stop. Han Littleflower was so shocked that he put away his Holy Spirit Protect and madly shouted, “Human King, if you dare to hurt her, I will kill you!”</p>

<p>Human King’s body finally stopped. He coldly said, “Young Man, talking crap will only make you look like a useless human being. Do not say anything that is out of your power to control.”</p>

<p>When the Holy Spirit Protect was taken away by Littleflower, Han Ling’er’s form, which looked like an angel, receded. She returned to looking like a child again. Her power was reduced. Now, there was no hope of her fighting back against Human King. With the combined powers of the brother and sister, they had managed to suppress Human King. When their powers split up, neither of them could fight against him. Han Littleflower was still able to fight against Human King a little, but his Holy Spirit Protect needed to be used on someone to maximize the power. Using it alone was not very strong. It would not pose a big threat to Human King. Seeing Han Ling’er return to her original self, Human King wanted to kill her. The universe power generated once more and struck Han Ling’er fiercely. He wanted to kill Han Ling’er to erase the threat she posed.</p>

<p>His head was very clear. Killing Han Littleflower would prove difficult, and Han Littleflower had the Holy Spirit Protect, which was something that required other people to make it powerful. Holy Spirit Protect’s power was undeniably strong. If the person being protected was not strong, the Holy Spirit Protect would not be strong either.</p>

<p>Han Ling’er’s and Han Littleflower’s Holy Spirit Protect was the scariest. Only one of them had to be removed.</p>

<p>Now, he had greatly offended Han Sen’s family. It did not matter if he killed a daughter of the Han family. Compared to the leader of the universe, killing an heir was practically nothing</p>

<p>Human King practiced with the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He had absorbed the Blood-Pulse of Blood Legion members from every single generation. That was how he was able to purify his blood. It was unknown how many members had been sacrificed to make him the man he was now. He was not like some soft man who was incapable of making a decision.</p>

<p>“Ling’er.” Littleflower saw Human King’s murderous visage and swapped space to block Ling’er from the power. He exploded his holy spirit power to throw a punch at Human King’s incoming universe power.</p>

<p>Seeing two powers about to collide, Human King lifted Ji Yanran in front. This time, Human King was not going to make the same mistake. He put Ji Yanran in front, but he did not let Littleflower’s power be allowed to touch Ji Yanran. His power was going to blow up Ji Yanran’s body.</p>

<p>“If you want her to live, be honest with me,” Human King coldly said.</p>

<p>Littleflower had to put his power away. Otherwise, his punch would end up blowing up Ji Yanran’s body before he could even reach Human King. Littleflower withdrew his power. Human King’s universe power struck Littleflower and made him fly away.</p>

<p>Although there was the Holy Spirit Protect power going with him, which meant Littleflower would not be killed, when Littleflower left, Ling’er was exposed. Human King did not hesitate. He used that opportunity to generate a finger. He pointed at Han Ling’er’s forehead with the desire to break her spirit body.</p>

<p>“Ling’er.” Ji Yanran and Han Littleflower felt bad. They wanted to use their bodies to block the strike that was about to fall on Han Ling’er.</p>

<p>Ji Yanran could not move. Han Littleflower wanted to teleport back, but it was too late. Huangfu Jing and Tang Zhenliu were very angry witnessing this, but they were not even as fast as Han Littleflower. They would be unable to carry out a rescue.</p>

<p>While everyone was in shock seeing Han Ling’er’s body about to be punched by Human King’s universe powers, there was suddenly a flash. A small body appeared in front of Han Ling’er. It came with gold light. Human King’s universe power went against that brilliant gold light. It was like wine pouring into a bottle. It simply vanished. “Bao’er… Sister Bao’er…” When everyone saw this shadow arrive, they were all just as happy as they were shocked. Han Ling’er and Han Littleflower were very happy. They all called her Big Sister.</p>

<p>Bao’er was clutching a little gold gourd. She stared at Human King. She used her gourd to take away Human King’s universe power.</p>

<p>Far away in the forest, Chaos stood atop the pinnacle of a tall tree. She looked down at Bao’er and seemed conflicted.</p>

<p>Bao’er had not succeeded in combining with the super god gene seed yet, so it was very risky of her to try and battle Human King now. She did not want this to happen.</p>

<p>But Bao’er went there by her own volition, and she had been powerless to try and stop her.</p>

<p>With Human King showing up in Space Garden, of all places, she was a bit confused. She had spent all her time in the sanctuaries, so she had not learned about Qin Xiu being consumed by Human King. “How dare you hurt my mother!” Bao’er looked at Human King and spoke very slowly.</p>

<p>Human King grabbed Ji Yanran and coldly said, “It is good that you are here. The whole family has been fighting me, so now I will have the chance to erase you all.”</p>

<p>“You should be the one who dies.” Bao’er rarely got mad, but now, she was blisteringly furious. She lifted the gourd and aimed at Human King.</p>

<p>Human King grabbed Ji Yanran and coldly said, “If you want her to die, then do it.”</p>

<p>Bao’er behaved as if she did not hear anything. She held the gold gourd with its bottom facing the sky. The gourd faced Human King. She patted the gourd. It made the little gold gourd shine with gold. A beam of gold came out of it, firing toward Human King like a laser.</p>

<p>“Sister Bao’er, don’t do it…” Littleflower and Ling’er were in shock.</p>

<p>Human King had already learned his lesson from Han Littleflower. He was not going to allow Littlelflower’s power to touch Ji Yanran. He put his hand back and pulled Ji Yanran away. The spell that had bound Ji Yanran became tighter. It was digging into her skin and looked ready to break her body.</p>
