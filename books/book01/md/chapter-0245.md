In darkness, Han Sen shapeshifted into the color shifter and moved in the direction of the lake. The sacred-blood creatures were on the other side of the lake, but Han Sen was still taking extra care when moving.

Until he slowly entered the lake, the sacred-blood creatures were still unaware of his presence. He let out a sigh of relief.

It had been a long while since a sacred-blood creature could force him to launch a sneak attack. This time, he had no other option than waiting in the lake and hitting the creatures when they came into the water.

With or without injuries, the creatures would always soak in the lake several times a day. Han Sen was not sure what the ritual was for.

Han Sen sensed nothing special about the weather. The sacred-blood creatures could heal rapidly in the lake, while Han Sen did not feel anything but wet.

In fact, when Han Sen was puzzled about the lake before, he had turned into the color shifter to sample some of the lake water and drank some, which did nothing.

When Han Sen was in the water, he hid himself behind some lush aquatic plants and turned into himself, since he could not last very long when shapeshifting.

Han Sen had decided to shapeshift into the color shifter again when he noticed the sacred-blood creatures stepping into the water.

After a couple of hours, Han Sen saw the sacred-blood creatures moving over to the lake and quickly shapeshifted.

Han Sen was wearing the phantom ant armor and holding the three-blade harpoon. Under the effect of the color shifter, Han Sen's body and belongings were all integrated into the water. No one could sense his presence.

Han Sen's assassination skills did not go to waste. As he was controlling his breath, neither creature noticed him there.

The unicorn horse carried the sacred-blood knight and walked towards the center of the lake, where Han Sen thought they would be.

Without moving a hair, Han Sen relaxed his entire body and waited for the creatures to come.

Not realizing the danger nearby, the creatures came to their usual spot.

When they were about to reach the spot, the unicorn horse suddenly neighed with terror and kicked about.

A long wound almost split open its belly. Blood and inner organs fell into the water, coloring it red.

The knight immediately fell off its mount into the water.

Han Sen was excited. His target was the unicorn horse to begin with, and without the mount, it would be much easier to kill the knight.

Struggling in the water, the unicorn horse was too injured to fight. The sacred-blood knight stabbed Han Sen with its spear furiously.

Moving sideways, Han Sen dodged this blow and shortened their distance, his three-blade harpoon slashing at the creature. The creature lifted its spear and blocked the harpoon.

All of a sudden, Han Sen threw a punch at the creature's chest with his left arm.

The creature was indeed strong and managed to block Han Sen's fist with its spear swiftly. Without being affected by the spinning force, Han Sen's fist avoided the spear and still hit the creature in the chest.

The yin force suddenly penetrated its armor and hurt its inner organs. Without moving its body, the sacred-blood creature suddenly spitted blood and swept the spear violently toward Han Sen.

Han Sen remained still and suddenly became one with the water, confusing the sacred-blood creature temporarily.

Jumping out of the water, Han Sen threw another punch at the creature, who learned from the previous experience and spun the spear in the other direction.

Unfortunately, Han Sen was using the yang force this time. With the clockwise spinning, Han Sen's fist was drawn toward the creature's chest even faster.

*Boom!*

The sacred-blood creature fell in the water with a splash.

Han Sen did not stop and threw himself at the creature.

Previously when the knight had its mount, Han Sen couldn't approach it. However, they were now both in the water and the unicorn horse was dying. There was no suspense in how this was going to end.

The water was suddenly red and Han Sen heard the voice.

> "Sacred-Blood Creature Beetle Knight Killed. Beast Soul Of Beetle Knight Gained. Meat Inedible."

> "Sacred-Blood Creature Magic Horn Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Eat Its Meat To Gain 0 To 10 Sacred Geno Points Randomly."

As the beetle Knight died, its mount died as well. "Hooray!" Han Sen stood up from the water and almost jumped up.

He was so lucky to gain a beast soul and some sacred-blood meat at the same time. The body of the beetle Knight quickly dissolved in the air and Han Sen dragged it spear and the body of the magic horn to the bank.

The body of the magic horn was the size of a camel. Han Sen did not waste any time and started a barbecue.

Han Sen also dried some meat to preserve, in case it went bad. He hadn't seen Lu Weinan in more than a month. It seemed that Lu Weinan had given up on the two sacred-blood creatures. Han Sen wondered what Lu Weinan would think if he ever learned that they were killed by Han Sen after all.

Soon after, Han Sen searched the entire lake but saw nothing special.

Then Han Sen had some time to look at his newly gained beast soul of sacred-blood beetle knight.
