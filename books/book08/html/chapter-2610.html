<h2>Cheating</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2610</h3>

<p>Han Sen’s knife skills kept changing, and thus far, he had used
seventy different attacks. Not a single one managed to hit
Exquisite. Her floating water knife was able to block every single
strike.</p>
<p>To an ordinary person, Exquisite would seem like some unknown
god. No matter how many times Han Sen attacked, Exquisite
controlled her water knife with perfect finesse. She blocked every
attack like a prophet.</p>
<p>But in Han Sen’s eyes, Exquisite wasn’t some omniscient being.
Her reactions made sense.</p>
<p>That was because Exquisite had merged with the universe. Han
Sen’s movements would trigger the spinning of universal cogwheels,
and whenever this happened, the disturbance in the universe would
alert Exquisite and prompt her to react.</p>
<p>So, when Han Sen attacked, Exquisite was able to respond
instantaneously. It was like Han Sen was attacking a mirror. It
didn’t matter how he used his knife; when the water knife touched
the mirror, the reflection of the water knife would react and
nothing would happen.</p>
<p>“Ha!” Han Sen stopped moving. He sat still. His water knife
suddenly pushed forward, and a water silk appeared next to
Exquisite. Almost a hundred water silks manifested like a horde of
blades around Exquisite’s body.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace skill called Under the Sky made every slash Han
Sen had performed thus far into a water silk. They all appeared at
once, and Han Sen was on the verge of breaking the enemy’s
defense.</p>
<p>A water knife couldn’t block that many knife silks unless
Exquisite used her body to fight back. She either had to do that or
move her body to evade them.</p>
<p>Of course, the water knife in front of Exquisite moved. But it
exploded under the force of all those incoming water silks. The
water silks were like a net of knives coming down on Exquisite.</p>
<p>Exquisite, however, didn’t move. She was like a jade goddess,
still seated atop the stairs. Her jade feet were still comfortably
dangling in the water. Holy, but cold.</p>
<p>The knife net was only a few inches away from her by this point,
and then, it suddenly came to a standstill. Each silk froze in
front of Exquisite, and there they remained unmoving.</p>
<p>Exquisite reached out her finger to pull the knife net. And
then, the knife net came undone like a water stream. They all
folded in on each other, gathering in her hands. They merged to
become a giant water knife.</p>
<p>That water knife still contained Han Sen’s power, but it was no
longer under his control. Exquisite held onto it gently, cradling
it like it was a delicate toy.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes were electric. He stared at Exquisite’s water
knife. Han Sen used his Dongxuan Area to watch Exquisite’s
movement.</p>
<p>“She can play like this?” Han Sen thought happily.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see that Exquisite was able to mess with the
cogwheels of the universe. His Dongxuan Area was more useful at
this than her ability, though. Han Sen felt as if he learned
something.</p>
<p>“It is pointless to continue this futile effort. Let us end this
exercise here,” Exquisite said coldly. Her hands looked like they
were touching a flower as she flicked the handle of the water
knife. Then, the water knife flew toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to generate another water knife to continue
fighting, but he noticed that all the water in the pond was moving
toward that big water knife that was headed for him. The water
knife flew extremely slowly, but the closer it got, the more power
it contained.</p>
<p>Han Sen was forced to generate another water knife. But when he
struck the giant water knife, he was unable to break it. Han Sen’s
water knife blended in with the giant water knife to become a part
of that giant water knife.</p>
<p>“No wonder the Very High are the number one race in the
universe. She is good. Not many deifieds can manipulate the laws
and rules of the universe to please their desires. And Exquisite is
merely a ninth-tier King.” Han Sen sighed. Han Sen had only
complimented her slightly, though. He wasn’t planning on giving up.
He watched as the water knife gathered all the water in the pond to
itself. It was like a giant blade that had risen to cut the sky.
Han Sen’s eyes flashed, and suddenly, he swung his hand like a
blade. He used his body to fight back the knife.</p>
<p>Exquisite had her yin and yang tai chi eye, but she was still
surprised to see this. That giant water knife’s power was combined
with Han Sen’s seventy strikes of Under the Sky, in addition to her
own powers. It had been buffed by the universe itself, too.</p>
<p>That strike was starting to form substance chains. It wasn’t
like a real deified’s attack, but it was better than what most
half-deifieds could achieve.</p>
<p>And Han Sen clearly intended to use his flesh to take the blow
instead. Exquisite believed that was too dangerous to do.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t hesitate. His hand-blade struck the water
knife, and the scary water knife suddenly fell under Han Sen’s
control. It now followed Han Sen’s attacking stance, returning
toward Exquisite.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The scary water power was now in front of Exquisite. An
invisible wall rose to block it, then exploded and fell back to the
pond. The explosion shook Exquisite, sending her stumbling
backward.</p>
<p>“You cheated!” Exquisite said, standing up. She looked at Han
Sen’s hand. In between his fingers was a crystal orb. It was
Ancient Water God’s Ancient God Origin.</p>
<p>Ancient Water God’s Ancient God Origin was a water-element
relic. If Han Sen held that item, not even water deifieds could
harm him. And Exquisite was just a ninth-tier King.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t cheating. I was just making reasonable use of my
resources. If that is considered cheating, is it not cheating for
you to use your third eye and receive the boons and benefits of the
universe?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“That is my power. What you used was another person’s power,”
Exquisite said.</p>
<p>“With my power, I don’t think I would lose, either. But I’m
heavily injured, so it wasn’t as if you were challenging me at my
full strength. Even if you won, I wouldn’t concede,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>When Exquisite heard that, she fell silent. She closed her tai
chi eye and looked more like a person again.</p>
<p>Although Exquisite’s face was still rather expressionless, she
looked far more like a human being than she had previously. With
her third eye open, she was like a lifeless machine.“Sure. I will
wait until you heal so we can fight again, then,” Exquisite said
while looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Then you are going to have to wait a long time. My wounds will
take at least a year to fix. Maybe two or three years.” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>Exquisite frowned. She knew that Han Sen was injured and his
body was heavily damaged. She knew he wasn’t lying. She was being
too hard on him.</p>
<p>“Lady Exquisite, I have heard the Very High have a spring that
brings good fortune. It can reverse one’s luck and allow others to
be reborn. Is that true?” Han Sen squinted his eyes as he looked at
her.</p>
<p>“Yes. Do you want to use that spring to repair your body?”
Exquisite knew what Han Sen was thinking.</p>
<p>“If you want to fight me again soon, I am afraid that is the
only way,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to come to the Very High, how can you use the
spring to fix your body?” Exquisite frowned.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I wouldn’t go to the Very High. However, until you
beat me, can I keep my body free from your intrusion?” Han Sen
finally spoke his true purpose.</p>
