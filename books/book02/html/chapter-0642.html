    <p>
      It was a female spirit. She was clad in chiffon armor, which highlighted
      her pair of gorgeous legs. She had sharp ears and a pair of wings on her
      back, shaped like those of a butterfly. Her eyes were purple, like little
      amethysts. The spirit was beautiful like an elf.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Wang Yuhang turned to look at the elf-like spirit, he presented a wry
      smile and said, &#8220;Only now do I regret the opportunity that was
      given, to try to tackle this place alone. Would I have beaten her, this
      stunning spirit might have been mine.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If Little Uncle is interested in a little competition, how about we
      both go now and see who first achieves ownership of the spirit.&#8221; Han
      Sen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nay, the Wang family does not disregard what they have already
      stated. This one is all you, Little Han.&#8221; Wang Yuhang waved his hand
      as he talked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not wait around. Immediately, he ran directly into the center
      of the spirit hall. The spirit watched Han Sen come at her, and without
      any hesitation, rushed to meet him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creatures had all fallen back, so it was just the spirit left, willing
      to fight to the bitter end.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen preferred not tangling with her himself, so he summoned Princess
      Yin and Princess Yang. He let them deal with the spirit, while he went on,
      racing towards the spirit statue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! Twin-beauty spirits?!&#8221; When Wang Yuhang saw the
      Yin Princess and Yang Princess, his eyes went wider than those of a bull,
      and his mouth dropped open.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elf spirit wanted to go after Han Sen but found herself suitably
      suppressed by the Twin Spirit that had been loosed upon her. Quickly, Han
      Sen reached the spirit statue and snatched the spirit stone from its
      forehead.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I, Empty Spirit, am willing to submit and offer absolute loyalty to
      a new master. I will become a faithful servant from now until
      eternity.&#8221; The elf-like spirit gave up the fight, knelt before Han
      Sen, and spoke her vow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang froze up after witnessing it. He just stood there, watching
      Han Sen effortlessly place the spirit stone onto the Empty Spirit
      Princess&#8217;s forehead. In a blinding light birthed from the stone, the
      Empty Spirit Princess disappeared from sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Han&#8230; nay, for I should say, Brother Han&#8230; you are
      incredible. How did you accomplish that? I can only surmise there may be a
      thing or two you can teach me. I have been attempting to earn a sexy,
      princess-class spirit for myself and have never been able to.&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang approached, placing his hand on Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder. His face
      was beaming with happiness, and the look of a mature elder quickly
      dissipated.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all down to luck,&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Luck is a fickle mistress. I pray for good fortune every day, and
      especially before I assault a royal shelter. I&#8217;ll even shower before
      that, as well. But every spirit I have encountered so far has chosen to
      self-destruct when given the spirit stone.&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s face
      looked disheartened.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, I am regretfully unable to help you with that.&#8221;
      Han Sen gave him a face that looked like he wanted to help, but due to the
      circumstances, could not.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;For truth? Then, perhaps you can teach me of a finer way I may
      ensure a capture? Or perhaps, if you were willing to sell one of your
      spirits, I would most certainly be willing to buy.&#8221; Wang Yuhang
      almost had saliva drooling from the corners of his mouth as he made the
      suggestion. His eyes continued to drift towards Princess Yin and Princess
      Yang. He almost seemed obsessed with the need for one, and he continued
      his dialogue, saying, &#8220;You can sell me as many as you&#8217;d like;
      money is of no concern to me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, how about this? The next time you locate a spirit you
      would like, call me. I will help you get the spirit stone. With my luck,
      there is a 90% chance I will be able to obtain it for you.&#8221; Han Sen
      then quickly returned Princess Yin and Princess Yang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had spent a long time trying to defeat and obtain the Twin Spirit,
      so he would never contemplate selling them. Furthermore, he often called
      upon them both to massage his shoulders and make him feel good. Plus, with
      the Crystal Palace being so big, the services of Yin and Yang were of
      great help to the Snow-Lady in keeping it operational. Han Sen felt it was
      undermanned as it was, so he didn&#8217;t want to sell them even if he
      could.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That works for me. In that case, my future happiness rests firmly
      upon your shoulders.&#8221; Wang Yuhang licked his lips, and the way he
      held himself looked as if he was trying to hide his disappointment at not
      being able to purchase the Twin Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Wang Yuhang was comforted by Han Sen&#8217;s willingness to help him
      with a spirit stone, the next time he located a spirit he wanted. After
      witnessing the Yin and Yang Princesses in action, and watching Han Sen
      claim fealty from the Empty Princess, Wang Yuhang regarded him as some
      sort of lucky goddess. Repeatedly, he grabbed his hand and wished for
      greater fortune, not letting go.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ahem, Little Uncle, what year is this? Alay your superstitious
      beliefs for one minute.&#8221; Han Sen felt it strange to have his hand
      vigorously shaken and almost worshipped by such a big man.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Han, you are young, yet you are a repeated recipient of good
      fortune. You do not know the pains of someone who must live their life as
      a thrall to the nasty pangs of unluckiness. I will let you know that your
      big brother – that would be me – is such a thrall. This ill fortune has
      plagued my lifetime, extending all the way back to my school days, when we
      separated seats in our classrooms. There were twenty-five boys and
      twenty-three girls in my year. Traditionally, one boy and one girl would
      share a desk. But the two additional boys would have to sit together, and
      as luck would have had it, I was one of those boys. I never sat next to a
      girl once during my time growing up.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After Wang Yuhang recited his tragic school time story, tears welled up in
      his eyes. But Han Sen couldn&#8217;t say anything before he continued
      talking. &#8220;And when we played games, I&#8217;d always be grouped with
      a boy. And my desk partner was frequently absent, too, which meant I had
      to spend many days grouped with my teacher. You don&#8217;t know my pain,
      brother! You don&#8217;t know my pain!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;And after leaving school, growing up, I never once won the lottery.
      I have never won a card game. If I go to hunt small monsters, I can
      guarantee you I will somehow summon a stampede of vicious, hungry, big
      bloodthirsty monsters. When I kill creatures, I never receive their beast
      souls. When I get a spirit stone, services of the spirit are never
      offered. I previously accepted my fate for that which it was&#8230; until
      today. After meeting you, I know I have located my savior.&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang was dribbling snot and tears, as he vigorously stroked Han
      Sen&#8217;s hand. It was like he had been single for thirty years and was
      now meeting a woman that was willing to give him the time of day.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Uh&#8230; Little Uncle? I just remembered I have some&#8230; uh,
      business that I must attend to&#8230; away from here. How about we
      continue this discussion another time?&#8221; Han Sen felt awkward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was a person who was super-duper unlucky. Han Sen thought he
      should be as far removed from him as possible, lest his own luck be
      poisoned by his proximity.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Wang Yuhang was still tightly gripping his hand, as if he&#8217;d
      found a soulmate. He looked eager to relay to Han Sen his entire life
      story.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tugged and pulled his hand back a few times, but Wang Yuhang did
      not budge.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, a loud roar shook the ground. Han Sen felt a buzzing
      noise in his head, and he almost fell over.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s face changed. Not only he had sensed
      the danger, but the silver fox, too. It hissed and growled as it looked
      around in alarm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly exited the spirit hall. Wang Yuhang was shaken from his
      miserable daze and followed him closely.
    </p>

    <p>They both looked to the skies. What they saw petrified them.</p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen collected the spirit, the creatures of the island had all
      left. But one remained in the darkened sky. It broke through the clouds,
      heading directly to Mystery Island.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skies burned a fiery red and the atmosphere of terror was enough to
      suffocate a person. A second later, the scary shadow crash-landed in the
      metal shelter, shaking the entire island. Twenty meters away from them, a
      monster with eyes of fire stared them down.
