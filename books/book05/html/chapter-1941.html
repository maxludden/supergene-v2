<p>Han Sen carried Hai’er as he ran, but it wasn’t because he had
any sympathy for her. He wanted a witness. If he had one, it might
prove useful further down the line.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his rabbit shoes to run, but he still looked
gloomy. Seven Spirit Buddha was keeping up with him, and the gap
between them was slowly closing.</p>
<p>Although there was still some distance between them, Han Sen was
fleeing over the flat, unobstructed sands. There was no place to
hide, and it would only be a matter of time before Seven Spirit
Buddha caught up with him.</p>
<p>“He’s just a Marquise?” Han Sen looked back. Seven Spirit Buddha
was one kilometer behind them.</p>
<p>Hai’er was shocked, and she said, “Seven Spirit Buddha is a
Marquise, but he is a genius amongst the Buddha. And Burning Lamp
Alpha taught him personally. I fear not even a Duke could rival
him. You need to run, because he is coming.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to run faster, but he was still just a Viscount.
He was already moving as fast as the shoes would allow. “Seven
Spirit Buddha! Why are you chasing me?” Han Sen shouted as he
ran.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit Buddha said grimly, “Amitabha!”</p>
<p>He didn’t say anything more. He merely focused on his pursuit of
Han Sen, and he slowly reeled in the distance between them.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked grim, and she said, “It looks like he really wants
to kill you. This is bad, man. If we don’t reach our destination,
we’re going to die.”</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly slapped Hai’er’s body, sending a surge of
energy into her. She found herself unable to move. She couldn’t
squirm, and neither could she speak.</p>
<p>“Stop talking. I can lose him,” Han Sen said to Hai’er as he
hopped up a sand dune.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t jump up there to remain on high ground. He
slid down its other side, and he used the height of the dune to
obscure Seven Spirit Buddha’s vision.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen was out of sight, he patted Little Invisible.
Then, a strange colorful power wrapped him up. Han Sen was able to
blend into the desert itself. No eyesight could detect them.</p>
<p>After crossing another thousand meters, Seven Spirit Buddha
reached the dune. Then, he started looking around.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, I know you are here. Come and fight me, student of
Knife Queen. At least die with dignity,” Seven Spirit Buddha
rumbled.</p>
<p>Nothing responded to him, though. Seven Spirit Buddha did not
move from his position as he looked over the desert. He moved his
lips, and a sound came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>A whirlwind kicked up, quickly swirling into a choking
sandstorm. It had a diameter of a thousand meters, and its
thickness painted it like a yellow fog. Seven Spirit Buddha was
convinced Han Sen was there, and he wished to use the sandstorm to
reveal him. But when the sandstorm quelled, he was unable to see
anything. It was still and quiet, and he could not see Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Is he good with the element of earth?” Seven Spirit Buddha
spoke to himself. He looked around and ventured in a specific
direction. Then, he disappeared.</p>
<p>In the sky, Hai’er saw Seven Spirit Buddha vanish. She wanted
Han Sen to free her, but she had no voice to speak with. She was
yelling in her mind, “*sshole! Let me go! You are deliberately
touching me.”</p>
<p>She could only think these things, since she still couldn’t
control her mouth.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the air, and he didn’t go back down. Neither did
he free Hai’er. He slowly flew higher and higher. He drifted up so
gradually, it felt as if he wasn’t moving at all.</p>
<p>“Wimp! Seven Spirit Buddha is gone. Why are you still being so
careful? Let me go!” Hai’er was yelling in her heart.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s forehead dripped with sweat. He was just a Viscount,
and flying slowly cost more energy than flying fast. And on top of
that, he was holding Hai’er. That cost him even more energy. After
ten minutes, he traveled one kilometer.</p>
<p>Hai’er was going to go crazy, being unable to move or speak. If
she could, she’d have been yelling at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Hai’er saw the same dune that Seven Spirit Buddha had
been standing atop. Seven Spirit Buddha had appeared there once
again.</p>
<p>He was wearing a white robe, standing atop the dune. It was as
if he hadn’t moved at all.</p>
<p>Hai’er was shocked, and she thought to herself, “I saw him walk
away. Why is he still here? Can he teleport?”</p>
<p>Amidst Hai’er’s shock, Seven Spirit Buddha mumbled something to
himself. A light then came out of his body, glowing strangely from
his chest. It looked like another seven spirits emerged from him
and walked their own separate ways.</p>
<p>Not long after, another seven spirits emerged from each of the
seven spirits. They all went off in different directions, but the
real Seven Spirit Buddha was still atop the original dune. After a
while, he traveled west.</p>
<p>“Buddha Clone? He is powerful.” Hai’er understood that the seven
spirits she was seeing were actually just clones.</p>
<p>But producing clones like that was something only a King class
Buddha could do. Seven Spirit Buddha was just a Marquise. His
ability to produce seven clones to search for them was
terrifying.</p>
<p>Hai’er was so happy right now that Han Sen had not freed her. If
she had made a noise, Seven Spirit Buddha would immediately have
known where they were.</p>
<p>“This guy is pretty good. He’s just a Viscount, but he has that
speed? I don’t know what treasure he collected to make him so
fast,” Hai’er thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen landed, and then he removed their camouflage. He also
freed her.</p>
<p>Hai’er was being quite suspicious. She carefully looked around
and said, “Is he really gone?”</p>
<p>“He is for now, but I am sure he will be back.” Han Sen moved to
rest on the sand.</p>
<p>Then what are we waiting for? Let’s run!” Hai’er said.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move from his spot, though, and he calmly said,
“His clones went off in eight different directions. Wherever we go,
he will see us.”</p>
<p>“Then what do we do?” Hai’er was not strong enough to deal with
someone like Seven Spirit Buddha. Somehow, she had found herself
depending on Han Sen.</p>
