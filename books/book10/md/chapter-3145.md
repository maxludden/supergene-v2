  When the god temple revealed itself, Han Sen was a little afraid.

This god temple was too familiar. It was the God of Wealth Temple. He had used the Sky God Crown to enter it.

When he went to the universe of kingdoms, the Sky God Crown could not be used. Han Sen never entered the God of Wealth Temple again, and he had no clue where it might have been. Now, the God of Wealth Temple was revealing itself. Han Sen thought it was weird. He did not know if the God of Wealth Temple was occupied by a new God Spirit or not.

When the God of Wealth Temple showed up, Han Sen felt the Sky God Crown shake. It seemed to have been summoned by the god temple.

The Sky God Crown, which had no prior reaction, was now reacting. This delighted Han Sen. He stepped toward the God of Wealth Temple.

Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy were shocked. They thought Han Sen was addicted to destroying god temples and was also going to destroy the God of Wealth Temple.

The god temple was surrounded by mist. Han Sen entered the temple. The door closed behind him.

“It’s you.” Han Sen looked at the god altar in the center. He saw the man who frequently called himself God there. He was sitting atop the god altar with a cup of wine in his hands. He kept drinking and smiling at him.

“Long time no see. You have been doing well recently.” God put down the wine cup and smiled at Han Sen.

“I am doing OK.” Han Sen knew this wasn’t just a social call.

God sighed. “You are doing well, but I am not doing well. That is because I have to keep wiping your ass. Don’t you think this is getting rather depressing?”

“But… I didn’t stir up anything.” Han Sen put out his hands and denied it.

Although he was a supreme God Spirit, somehow, he was a very chill person whenever Han Sen spent time with him. God couldn’t be bothered arguing. He asked, “Do you think all of this is fine? You keep breaking the rules of the world. If you were anyone else, a sky full of God Spirits would have crushed you. Do you think you’ve been safe from any god spirits coming for you through dumb luck? Do you think the God Spirits are scared of you or something?”

“Did you help me?” Han Sen wasn’t sure what to think. He was strong, but the rules of the world suppressed him too much. He was able to deal with one or two Annihilation God Spirits, but his body would have been unable to deal with any more than that.

In this world, the power he used was difficult to replenish. That was why he could not fight very often.

God did not answer him. He asked Han Sen, “Do you know why the God Spirits have Destroyed, Disaster, Annihilation, and Reboot classes? Do you know why they have these four classes?”

“I don’t know,” Han Sen said. He shook his head in honesty.

“When God Spirits descend, they unleash a lot of destructive powers,” God said. “From creating unnatural disasters and those that seem natural, they might want to punish you or others that seek to break the rules of the world. Only by doing that can the universe be kept safe and not be destroyed.” “Will the universe really stop running because someone can destroy it?” Han Sen recalled Night God No Moon talking about the universe being a perpetual motion machine. He had been wondering about that ever since.

“Of course, every substance has life. It can either be short or long. The universe is the same. Even though the universe is running normally now, it is only a matter of time before it is brought to ruin. People like you keep trying to destroy it. Sooner or later, it will at least accelerate its decay.”

God looked at Han Sen and went on to say, “If you keep doing this, I will have to get rid of you. That way, the universe can keep running normally.”

Han Sen developed a wry smile. “I did not want to do this, but I can’t lay down and die the next time I encounter grave danger. Is that what you expect me to do?”

“That is the whole reason I got you the God of Wealth Temple,” God said with seriousness. “In the future, you can use the God of Wealth Temple’s power. Just don’t break the laws of the universe again. If you do it again, we cannot be friends anymore, and I will be forced to kick you into hell.”

“I cannot beat the God Chaos Party members with just the God of Wealth Temple’s power,” Han Sen said to God, hoping it might be one avenue to retrieve answers from.

God did not say anything. He looked at Han Sen for a while. Han Sen felt uncomfortable being stared at like that. God asked, “Can you become a dog and bite a dog back if a dog bites you?”

“If it dared to bite me, I would not be opposed to turning into a dog to bite it back,” Han Sen answered.

God was speechless. After a while, he said, “I do not care what you think. You are not allowed to break the rules again, got it? I am giving you the God of Wealth Temple. You can use the God of Wealth Temple and gene races to fight. If you use them well enough, even a member of the God Chaos Party will be unable to rival you.”

“And let me give you a friendly reminder,” God said. “Killing the members of the God Chaos Party will nab you some very decent benefits. The gene race power will help you a lot.” He did not wait for Han Sen to answer him. He turned around and vanished. He obviously didn’t want to connect with Han Sen.

“Remember, do not break the rules of the universe. If the universe is getting destroyed, perhaps you can live, but your friends and family will never survive.” God’s voice was very unstable. It kept echoing through the halls of the God of Wealth Temple.

“Hey, can I use the God of Wealth Temple to return to the geno universe?” Han Sen asked.

He didn’t receive an answer. He did not know if God had left or if God simply didn’t want to answer.

Han Sen shouted a few times, but no one answered. Eventually, he gave up. He summoned the Sky God Crown.

This time, the Sky God Crown answered his summons. It appeared on his forehead. Han Sen suddenly felt some weird connection with the God of Wealth Temple. He turned into a real God of Wealth.

The weird messages in Han Sen’s head helped him understand what he hadn’t before.

Of course, the messages were from the god temple.

The most direct message was about Blood-Pulses. Han Sen knew the rules about them, such as how God Spirits gave them to humans. It was quite restricted. If a random human was given any Blood-Pulse, it would be pointless for the God Spirits. It might have even harmed them.

Han Sen had seen that. He had forced the Feather Fairy to give Mister Yang a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It was very awkward for the Feather Fairy. If he was not careful, the Feather Fairy might have been harmed because after giving Mister Yang a Blood – Pulse.

Giving humans a Blood-Pulse was good for God Spirits, but the humans who received a God Spirit Blood-Pulse needed to use their God Spirit Blood-Pulse to develop. The stronger the human was, the greater the benefits a God Spirit could receive. It made the God Spirits stronger.

If a human with the God Spirit Blood-Pulse died, the God Spirit was also damaged.

Selecting a good human to give a Blood – Pulse to was a very serious proposition for a God Spirit. That was especially true when it came to inherited god-blood nobles. It might have far-reaching consequences that plagued the rest of their life.

To summarize, they had to pick humans with talent and potential if they wanted to give out a God Spirit Blood-Pulse if they wanted to earn things and not lose things.
