<p>Han Sen could not tell which race this statue depicted. Its head was a sheep’s, and its body was human-like. It also had wings. It looked like some prehistoric sheep god.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there weren’t any of such sheep around. Otherwise, he was going to call them grandfather.</p>

<p>“Why does this place have a statue? Do xenogeneics build statues?” Han Sen asked with confusion.</p>

<p>Thousand Feather Crane had told Han Sen some things about the Ancient God space, but the young Sky hadn’t actually been here. He couldn’t have known what the xenogeneics were truly like.</p>

<p>Hai’er said, “It is not a statue. It is a home for Ancient God xenogeneics.”</p>

<p>“A home?” Han Sen was surprised, and so he looked at the statue again.</p>

<p>Yes. Otherwise, why would they be called an Ancient God xenogeneic? It is because these xenogeneics live in ancient statues. You came here and didn’t know anything about this? Knife Queen didn’t inform you?” Hai’er asked, looking confused.</p>

<p>Han Sen dropped his shoulders. He didn’t know why the leader of Sky Palace would do this, either. Sending him here without giving him an ounce of information was weird. He couldn’t discern what the man wanted.</p>

<p>Hai’er wanted to say something more, but a ding-dong noise sounded through the giant cave. She quickly shut up and went to hide in a crevice.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked towards the sound. The echo was reverberating around the room, but Han Sen’s power could still tell him where it was coming from. It was coming from the nostrils of the statue.</p>

<p>Not long after, a three-meter-wide spider slid out of the nostril.</p>

<p>The spider was black with a few red patterns flaring across it. Its body looked metallic, and the pattern on its back looked like a humanoid face.</p>

<p>“This is Ancient God’s Ghost Face Spider. It is an Earl xenogeneic. Do not strike yet, as they always work in groups. There must be far more of them inside the statue. A Marquise one might even reside within. We should discuss our plan of action before we end up getting ourselves surrounded,” Hai’er said.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the Ghost Face Spider with a thoughtful expression. He had fought these spiders in the dream he was put under. In fact, he had fought quite a lot of them. He knew a lot about the spider and the power it possessed.</p>

<p>“The dream had to be training for this. Why didn’t he just tell me? Why did he try to scare me like that?” Han Sen wondered.</p>

<p>But Han Sen knew that if the Sky Palace leader had given him files on all the xenogeneics, he’d only have given it a brief look. He wouldn’t have researched the foes properly.</p>

<p>The dream, however, made Han Sen remember the creatures clearly. He knew everything about them, to a degree that would never lessen. The effectiveness of the two teaching methods was not even remotely comparable.</p>

<p>Han Sen summoned Spell as a gun in his hands. Then, he climbed into a gap and raised the gun. He took aim at the Ghost Spider emerging from the nostril.</p>

<p>“What are you doing? You are not going to shoot the Ghost Face Spider from that distance, are you? The Ghost Face Spider is very strong for an Earl!” Hai’er gasped.</p>

<p>Hai’er knew that Han Sen would have no problem killing a Ghost Face Spider, but the range between them and the creature was over three kilometers. The Earl power would be weakened over a long distance, and the rest of the power wouldn’t be enough to kill a Ghost Face Spider.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>A gunshot rang out, and a bullet tore through the distance. It hit the spider’s back. The part of the face pattern that comprised its left eye was its weakspot. Han Sen had killed too many of them in the dream he suffered, so he knew them all too well.</p>

<p>Blood began to ooze from the gunshot wound in the creature’s back. Then, it flipped and fell. It met the ground with a loud noise.</p>

<p>“Xenogeneic Earl killed. Ghost Face Spider: xenogeneic gene found.”</p>

<p>The announcement sounded in Han Sen’s head.</p>

<p>Hai’er was in shock. Han Sen’s power was far stronger than the average Earl to one-hit-kill the spider over such a long distance.</p>

<p>After that shot, though, many more spiders began to emerge from the statue’s nostrils and ears. There was a great host of them.</p>

<p>But their vision and senses were rather limited, so they couldn’t figure out where Han Sen was.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Another gunshot rang out, and a bullet broke through another spider’s back. He still took aim at the left eye’s location.</p>

<p>A hail of gunfire followed, as each spider was shot off of the statue. The spiders weren’t very intelligent, and they only seemed to rely on basic instinct. They couldn’t find Han Sen, at all.</p>

<p>Han Sen killed the spiders one at a time, taking down dozens in the space of a few seconds. Hai’er looked at Han Sen with shock, as her mind drifted out to space.</p>

<p>Hai’er felt a chill in her heart. That gun-looking geno armament of his had amazing range. She’d never know if Han Sen decided to use it to assassinate her. She was confident she could evade the attack if she was prepared. But she couldn’t be on alert every hour of the day and night. Han Sen’s power really was that scary.</p>

<p>And he was only an Earl. If he became a King or a deified being, he could probably kill a person by firing through the crust or core of a planet. The enemy would never even know how they died.</p>

<p>Ghost Face Spiders kept climbing all around, and they kept firing out spider webs. They had no idea where Han Sen was, and they blindly fired their silk everywhere. It was obviously not effective on Han Sen. And the spiders continued to get picked off, as if they were mere target practice for him.</p>

<p>After killing a hundred of the Earl Ghost Face Spiders, Han Sen finally heard the announcement to inform him that he had acquired a beast soul.</p>

<p>Han Sen killed a few more, and then a weird scream sounded. It came from the mouth of the statue. A spider that was twice as big emerged.</p>

<p>“That is the Marquise Ghost Face Spider!” Hai’er screamed.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not say a word. He stopped firing. He waited until the giant Ghost Face Spider revealed its back to them. And when it did, he pulled the trigger. Pang!</p>

<p>A bullet struck the Ghost Face Spider’s back, and it broke the pattern’s left eye. The Marquise class Ghost Face Spider fell down.</p>

<p>Hai’er looked at Han Sen in disbelief. He had one-hit killed a Marquise class Ghost Face Spider. She did not know what Han Sen’s strength was anymore.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t been that long, so how has he gotten this strong?” Hai’er thought back to meeting Han Sen in the heaven. He was a different person, and he was so much stronger now.</p>

<p>Hai’er thought she had leveled up quickly, but it was clear to her that Han Sen had been much faster.</p>
