<p>“Did you not hear me? Give me your eggs!” When the girl saw that Han Sen wasn’t responding, she waved her purple sword menacingly.</p>

<p>“You can steal other things. As long as it’s not something inside me, I can give it to you. But those things represent me as a man. I cannot give them to you. I am sorry,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>

<p>“Stop talking rubbish. I want your eggs. What does this have to do with being a man?” The lady looked at Han Sen with confidence.</p>

<p>“May I ask you, do you know what the eggs are?” Han Sen looked at her strangely.</p>

<p>“Of course I know!” The lady was not very intimidating, and she went on to say, “The two gold balls. Give them to me, or I will harm you! My sword does not have a conscience.”</p>

<p>Han Sen spread his hands and said, “I don’t have any gold eggs. You must be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Really?” The girl looked at Han Sen.</p>

<p>“I really don’t have them.” Han Sen nodded.</p>

<p>“You should have told me sooner! I have wasted so much time.” The lady returned her sword and started to depart.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at her with interest He hadn’t expected her to just leave. He was not sure where she was from, for her to end up in such a dangerous locale.</p>

<p>But that was none of Han Sen’s business, and since she was already out there, she must have had her own way of survival.</p>

<p>Han Sen was not sure if the girl was naive or if she was merely pretending to be. Whatever the case might have been, he thought it would be best for him to stay out of it.</p>

<p>Han Sen turned around and readied himself to leave, but after walking a few steps, he heard the girl say, “This is a robbery! Give me your eggs!”</p>

<p>Roar!</p>

<p>Han Sen heard an angry roaring. He turned around and saw a strange bull with broken joints. It jumped towards the girl, its hoofs aligned with her head.</p>

<p>Han Sen was frozen. He saw two gold eggs beneath the bull, swinging as its body moved.</p>

<p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

<p>The lady swung her purple sword toward the bull. A metal noise rang out.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s expression looked very weird. The girl was strong, and strength aside, her skills were very good compared to what he had seen in this universe.</p>

<p>Xina was a Viscount elite, but her combat skills were much worse than what he was seeing now.</p>

<p>That weird bull was very strong, but it wasn’t very agile. The lady, however, was.</p>

<p>The lady’s strength was only a little worse than the bull’s, but they fought for a while. It was difficult to discern which of them would win.</p>

<p>Moo! Moo! The weird cow started to moo angrily.</p>

<p>“You know how strong I am now? Give me your eggs and I will spare your life,” the lady said.</p>

<p>Moo! Moo! the bull thundered, as his legs began to shine with gold. It was headed right for the lady.</p>

<p>The lady’s movement was fast, and her purple sword swung in a crescent moon. She moved it well, and it broke the bull’s attack.</p>

<p>“The geno universe has many elites! If her sword skills are this proficient, her parents must be very powerful,” Han Sen thought</p>

<p>While Han Sen was watching, he saw the forest sway with all sorts of strange mooing sounds. There were more bulls headed the lady’s way, all with golden eggs swinging.</p>

<p>The lady’s sword skills were strong, but she was too weak to fight them all. She couldn’t be much better than the average Baron. It was okay to one-on-one the bull, but she’d have no chance of survival if she was surrounded by them on all sides.</p>

<p>“What are you standing there for? Come and help!” The lady fell back, shouting at Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen was thinking, “She wanted to steal my eggs and now she wants my help? She is obscene!”</p>

<p>“I can help, but my services aren’t free. How about you give me the sword in your hand for a reward, and I’ll kill them all?” Han Sen offered.</p>

<p>The sword in the lady’s hand was made from xenogeneic materials. It looked to be much better than the Rhino Horn Dagger. And Han Sen could not keep relying on the Archangel Bone Arrow. He needed a weapon, and he needed it now.</p>

<p>The lady was fast, so she threw the sword to Han Sen as she ran, saying, “Fine, it’s yours! Come and help.”</p>

<p>Han Sen caught the sword as four bulls came charging towards him. Han Sen, moving like a snake, headed towards them.</p>

<p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

<p>There were four metallic noises, and four pairs of gold eggs fell to the earth. The bulls were all bleeding, and they died right there.</p>

<p>“Xenogeneic Baron hunted; xenogeneic gene found: Gold Sun Bull.”</p>

<p>Han Sen heard the announcement play four times. Then, swinging his new sword, he picked up the four pairs of eggs and put them in his satchel.</p>

<p>“Hey, those eggs are mine!” the girl said, running over to Han Sen.</p>

<p>“I’m the one who killed the things. It’s dangerous here, so you should just leave. You won’t be this lucky if you encounter trouble again.” After that, Han Sen proceeded through the woods.</p>

<p>The girl wasn’t going to simply leave, though. She chased Han Sen and said, “You are a liar! I gave you the Purple-Moon Sword. You should give me those eggs, or at least half the tally! Or maybe even just one pair.”</p>

<p>Han Sen got annoyed, so he threw a pair of gold eggs at her.</p>

<p>Upon receiving them, the girl looked incredibly happy. Han Sen thought she would leave after that, but after a while, she was back near him.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I give you what you wanted? Why are you still following me?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>

<p>“That was a mission of mine. Now I need to get a silver goat horn. You are pretty good, so why don’t we go and kill silver goats together?” The girl blinked.</p>

<p>“What do you need them for?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>The girl seemed strange on multiple levels, and these were only Baron materials. They were cheaper than the components of her sword, so the fact that she wanted them so badly was weird.</p>

<p>“I need these two items to become an adult. If I can’t get them, I will have to wait another year. And that also means I cannot go out for a year! Can you please help me?” The girl looked at Han Sen helplessly.</p>
