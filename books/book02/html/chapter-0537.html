    <p>
      Ji Yanran patiently explained what it was all about, but Han Sen quickly
      understood what she really meant. In his heart, he felt shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The information he could gather on the Skynet regarding surpassers was
      rather limited. The population of the entire Alliance exceeded several
      billion, but the amount of registered surpassers was below one million.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ordinary people were aware that the Third Shelter was dangerous, and the
      surpassers there were extremely powerful. They possessed powers that
      regular humans could not. As for what the Third Shelter looked like, there
      was no way to know. Therefore, ordinary people had no idea what to think
      about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      People only knew that powerful creatures were said to reside there in the
      Third Shelter, but that was about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As for the information the Alliance was willing to put out detailing the
      Third Shelter, it was miniscule. The data they did provide said that the
      fitness of the ordinary creatures there were at the very least above 300.
    </p>

    <p>
      This knowledge was frightening enough. A human evolver with excellent
      genes only averages around 30. Those with excellent genes from the Second
      Shelter are said to have a fitness level of around 130&#8211;150.
    </p>

    <p>
      To reach a fitness level of 150 was a rare and highly prestigious thing
      for a person to achieve. Only the strongest could enter the evolution pool
      and evolve into a surpasser, and they would have to reach a fitness level
      of 300 to do it. And that level belonged to the weakest creatures of the
      Third shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was extremely rare to witness someone reach such heights, so how could
      they hope to survive in the Third Shelter, which must be populated with
      the most insane of creatures?
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the strongest human was weaker than the least creature of the Third
      Shelter, so how could they grow up in such a place?
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran&#8217;s answer rested in the hyper geno art. It was common for
      humans to call reaching level 300 fitness the &#8220;Skystep&#8221;. If
      you can attain that level, you become the equivalent of a Celestial Being.
      To become a Celestial Being requires you going beyond the mortal
      capabilities of humans and being able to communicate with those in the
      sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      The so-called communicators of the sky had been saturated in and absorbed
      the powers of the universe; they would no longer have to consume food for
      nutrients or sustenance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any human who reached this height was capable of controlling certain
      powers of the universe. This included Anni, which allowed for the command
      of thunder and electricity. Others would be able to control water, fire,
      and even time and space itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      To hold onto these powers required hyper geno arts - yet not any ordinary
      variants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran spoke a word that Han Sen was quite familiar with - &#8220;Qi
      Gong&#8221;. Only the hyper geno arts that had been modified by Qi Gong
      could be used to maintain control of the powers of the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to what Ji Yanran told Han Sen, some high-level Qi Gong hyper
      geno arts did not require Celestial Being modifications for use. Even when
      humans are children, they are able to use Qi Gong to observe the power of
      the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      But before a person reaches the level of a Celestial Being, the powers
      that could be absorbed was weak and few. Therefore, they were not very
      effective. But after years of training, the efficiency of one&#8217;s
      absorption could rise greatly. If, after that, you choose to become a
      Celestial Being, you would be much stronger than the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certain people were gifted, however, and it was possible for them to not
      even have to become a Celestial Being before they could control the powers
      of the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ji family is the clan that owned Qi Gong. There were however three
      other families that had were gifted in the same way. Each family inherited
      Qi Gong from the same lineage and heritage; all that was different was the
      family name.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ji, Lin, Wang, Xue.&#8221; Ji Yanran spoke these four surnames to
      Han Sen, and it made his heart leap in his chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Killing of Xue Long Yan had given him theJadeskin skill. Once he had
      gained it, he had kept an eye on anyone possessing the surname Xue, but he
      was never able to glean much information regarding big individuals that
      belonged to that family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, all of a sudden, he heard the surname Xue spoken aloud to him, and
      his face changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If possible, it would be best if you could raise your fitness to
      150 so that you can become a surpasser. The higher the better,&#8221; Ji
      Yanran told Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why? To become a surpasser, I would need to raise my fitness level
      to 300 and reach the &#8216;Skystep&#8217;,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;To be 300 is the level of a Celestial Being, but there&#8217;s are
      differences between the talents they possess. If your base is better, then
      your talents can be higher. But no matter what, you cannot change it once
      you have become a surpasser. Therefore, it&#8217;s best if you try raise
      your fitness level as high as you can - you can always become a surpasser
      later on. Your genes should be perfect,&#8221; Ji Yanran reminded Han Sen
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran was going to join the exchange event due it being the Qi Gong
      exchange for the Ji, Lin, Wang, and Xue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran also told Han Sen that at the exchange event, he was sure to
      meet someone familiar.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Han Sen asked, curiously.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wang Meng Meng from the Wang family; I have heard she&#8217;s quite
      fond of you.&#8221; Ji Yanran giggled while saying this to Han Sen, and
      she looked at him with devious eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Meng Meng only treats me like a big brother, and I treat her like a
      little sister in return. You know that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Han Sen
      felt a little surprised, because he knew that Wang Meng Meng was not an
      ordinary person. He had not expected her to be a future inheritor of the
      Qi Gong, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen really wanted to ask who the Xue family were, and also ask whether
      they possessed a special skill calledJadeskin, but he kept his question
      back, for now.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I should go - could I truly go to an event such
      as this?&#8221; Han Sen was trying to test Ji Yanran&#8217;s resolve to
      bring him.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Xue Long Yan had really come from the Xue family, then he would be in
      great trouble if they discovered that Han Sen was in possession of
      theJadeskin skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran peered directly into Han Sen&#8217;s eyes. With an intimidating
      voice, she told him, &#8220;You have to.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After she spoke, her face reddened and she quietly said, &#8220;Although
      you can purchase modified versions of Qi Gong hyper geno arts from the
      Saint Hall, they are mostly low-level Qi Gongs. You and I should go to the
      exchange event to learn as much as we can. When we marry in the future,
      you can learn the Qi Gong directly from my family.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking of marriage made Ji Yanran&#8217;s face turn beetroot red and she
      went silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will go then.&#8221; Han Sen knew that he would have to get
      through the Xue family eventually. He couldn&#8217;t delay the inevitable
      forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people who went to the exchange event were ordinary people, and their
      views and opinion could not, at least, be as bitter as those possessed by
      the older generations of their families. And at least Han Sen would be
      able to meet the Xue family and finally learn whether Xue Long Yan had
      indeed belonged to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      With regards to the Ji family&#8217;s Qi Gong, however, Han Sen
      wasn&#8217;t particularly interested. He only wanted to finish his
      translation of the Dongxuan Sutra. No matter how strong the Qi Gong of the
      Ji family was, he had never seen a family member manage to break through
      the vacuum with their bare hands. The Dongxuan Sutra had to be the
      strongest Qi Gong to have ever existed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran brought Han Sen to take part in the exchange event, but Anni
      followed as well, though once they reached the venue, she had no choice
      but to wait outside.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason why Han Sen could accompany Ji Yanran there was because when Ji
      Yanran first introduced him, he was already her fiancée.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lin Feng.&#8221; Han Sen had not yet seen Wang Meng Meng at the
      event, but he saw that familiar shadow.
