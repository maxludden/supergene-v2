    <p>
      Little Lion King wanted to throw in the towel, but seeing Little Silver
      and Starsea Beast carry on, he was reluctant to. He strove to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t believe his creatures are actually better than me.” Jade Little
      Lion King made up his mind—he was going to march forward even further.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was halfway to the next curtain of light, Little Lion King’s body
      suddenly glowed. His geno core leveled up again, giving him a super geno
      core.
    </p>
    <p>Roar! “I am the strongest!” Jade Little Lion excitedly shouted.</p>
    <p>
      “This guy’s pretty talented. He has managed to level up three times, so it
      is no wonder that he’s the heir of a strong creature.” Han Sen was
      jealous. His self geno cores had still shown no sign of changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Jade Little Lion became super, he felt the atmospheric pressure
      become lighter. And then, reaching the fifteenth light wasn’t so much of a
      struggle. The strength of his body had improved, after all. He ran up to
      Han Sen and said to him, “Han Sen, are you interested in competing with
      me? To see which of us can walk furthest?”
    </p>
    <p>“Where’s the good in that?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “If you win, I will take you as my boss and I will listen to whatever you
      say, no matter the command.” Little Lion King rolled his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen Han Sen’s power, but he knew it was derived from the beast
      souls or geno cores he had collected. Little Lion King could tell Han
      Sen’s fitness was only a little bit better than a gemstone creature, and
      he wasn’t super class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the Godlight Tunnel, the extra powers Han Sen relied on would be
      useless. You had to use your own body’s power to fight back the pressure
      and light. And that was why the lion was now confident.
    </p>
    <p>“Okay, then.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
    <p>
      “Don’t rush it, though. If you lose, I’ll be your boss instead. I’ll make
      you do everything for me,” Little Lion King said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>“Okay.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao hadn’t spoken a word thus far. Little Lion King had become super,
      and she felt uncertain and restless. She believed Little Lion King might
      have actually been stronger than her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans were different from creatures and spirits. If Han Sen’s self geno
      core leveled up, his fitness would still remain what it was. Like the two
      humans, once Han Sen reached the end of his tether, leveling up would
      still force him to stop where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao hadn’t decided to fight Han Sen after becoming super because she
      was still afraid of his geno cores and beast souls. It wasn’t his actual
      power she was afraid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths didn’t say anything, either. He just continued walking, and he
      didn’t care about anything the others were discussing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao’s surprise did not only come from Han Sen alone, though. Bao’er,
      Little Silver, and Starsea Beast had managed to breach the sixteenth
      curtain of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      They only had gemstone geno cores, and they weren’t super yet. It was
      extremely shocking because she had never heard of a gemstone creature
      making it this far before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s that creature? And what was its parent, to give it such horrible
      strength? Are they super creatures? But then again, if they were, they
      wouldn’t have been allowed to enter God’s Ruin.” Yu Miao was in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lion King and Yu Miao were both feeling the same way. They were
      both in shock. White Lion King said a powerful creature’s heir could go
      past the sixteenth light with a gemstone body, but the likelihood of such
      a creature living was a one-in-a-billion rarity. They wondered how Han Sen
      had amassed so many.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Yu Miao and the Lion King remained dazed in their shock, Starsea
      Beast began to glow. It was a beautiful thing to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is Little Star leveling up?” Han Sen was very happy about this. This was
      the first super creature he had cultivated in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao was already certain that Little Star was a gemstone class
      creature, but this confirmation only heightened her shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gemstone class creature had actually reached the sixteenth section of
      the Godlight Tunnel. That meant he was the best of the best when it came
      to creatures. If nothing bad happened, it would undoubtedly become a
      berserk super creature one day and go on to really becoming the greatest
      to exist in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Six Paths was surprised by this. He saw what had occurred, and after
      a long stare, he said, “A legend speaks of a Starsea Dragon King existing
      in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. The starsea power it wielded was
      unbeatable. It reached the end of the seas and leveled up. I wonder if he
      is its heir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head and said, “No. He is just the heir of a
      sacred-blood creature. It’s just something about his genes that must have
      changed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn’t know if Little Star was the heir of Starsea Dragon King, but
      even if the creature was and he knew that, he wouldn’t admit it. If that
      name was indeed connected to Little Star, all the enemies of Starsea
      Dragon King would come looking for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Little Star was indeed the heir, it helped to explain why he was so
      powerful. In the legends, it said Starsea Dragon King went on to become a
      god. That implied Little Star was a child of a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone continued walking, and when they neared the seventeenth light,
      Little Silver looked incredibly tired. His body was shaking as he tried to
      beat the weight of the pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought it was strange that he himself could now feel the pressure
      of the light, but it wasn’t as bad as he thought it might be. The burden
      wasn’t exceptionally tough for him to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Strange. My fitness is just a little bit better than that of a gemstone
      creature, just like Yu Miao. But why can’t I feel much of the Godlight
      pressure?” Han Sen felt very weird. He didn’t feel much of that pressure
      at all, and he had almost reached the seventeenth curtain of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were approaching the seventeenth curtain of light, Little Silver
      stood up off of Starsea Beast’s back. The fox’s fur was all standing on
      end, and its bones creaked and moaned. He was clearly fighting some sort
      of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought the little fox wasn’t going to make it, but Starsea Beast
      helped and nudged it on into the curtain of light. Little Silver was
      barely hanging on by a thread, and unfortunately, its geno core did not
      evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway through the seventeenth section, Little Silver could endure it no
      more. He had to jump off Starsea Beast’s back and stop where he was.
    </p>
    <p>It looked as if he had gone as far as he could.</p>
    <p>
      “Little Silver shouldn’t be any weaker than Starsea Beast. Why did his
      geno core not level up?” Han Sen wondered.
