      “Is there a creature here that not even the Destroyer Wolf and the Rolling
      Dragon know of? Perhaps they know about it, but they’re letting the
      creature hide here for some reason?” Han Sen frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was very confident about his Dongxuan Aura. He was certain that
      the molecules belonged to the creature he had been looking for before.
      Also, these molecules were very recent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one possibility: the mutant creature was in the cave, but
      it was somehow concealing its presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen speculated that when the eggshell of the Sacred egg cracked and
      the Rolling Dragon struck, the creature thought it was time to make a move
      and accidentally left some molecules in its excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Won’t the water from the black pond just pour into the eggshell and
      pollute the egg yolk inside?” Han Sen said randomly. He watched the
      Destroyer Wolf casually, but his Dongxuan Aura was intensely focused on
      the corner with the molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, nothing strange seemed to be happening. Everything was peaceful,
      and no more random molecules were slipping out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That makes sense. Let’s get the egg out now. There are so many cracks in
      the egg at this point, so there’s a chance that we can just suck the yolk
      out directly,” said the Destroyer Wolf to the Rolling Dragon beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen found it strange that Destroyer Wolf was asking for Rolling
      Dragon’s help. Part of the egg was above the black water, so if the
      Destroyer Wolf was afraid of the water of the black pond, he could
      retrieve the egg without exposing himself to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally, people wouldn’t just entrust a valuable like this to others;
      instead, they would do it by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rolling Dragon heard what the Destroyer Wolf said. It spun its tail,
      using its trident like a spoon to lift the Sacred egg out of the pond. It
      dredged up the Sacred egg and put it on the ground beside the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, black fissures covered the egg like a cobweb, and lots of
      the black fissures had sunk deeply into the egg.
    </p>
    <p>The Destroyer Wolf walked to the egg and looked down at the cracks.</p>
    <p>
      “The crack is still not large enough, and we can’t even see what’s inside.
      There isn’t anything slipping out, so it needs to be eroded further,” said
      the Destroyer Wolf. Then, it grabbed the Sacred egg with its paws and
      stood up like a human being. It then lifted the Sacred egg to throw it in
      the black pond again.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, just as it turned around, the Rolling Dragon whipped its tail,
      and the trident pierced through the body of the Destroyer Wolf, punching a
      hole in the wolf’s chest. Blood burst out, dyeing the white fur red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf dropped the egg, and bizarre ripples began to twist the
      space around the wolf’s body. They disappeared for a second, and when they
      showed up again, Destroyer Wolf was right behind the Rolling Dragon. The
      wolf teeth tore downwards, biting toward the neck of the Rolling Dragon.
    </p>
    <p>Ao!</p>
    <p>
      However, before the Destroyer Wolf could bite the neck of the Rolling
      Dragon, a transparent arrow shot through the wolf’s head. The arrow went
      into the back of its head, through its brain, and out between its
      eyebrows. Blood dripped from the tip of the arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Destroyer Wolf fell on the ground without even having the chance to
      struggle. It laid on the ground, completely lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was completely bewildered. He couldn’t believe that the mighty
      Destroyer Wolf had been killed so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then looked to the corner of the cave and saw a creature standing
      there. Its upper body was that of a human being, while its lower body
      looked like a snake. It stood there, sneering with its apathetic face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature was holding a bow, and the color of the bow resembled the
      color of the horns on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good job, black dragon.” The half-human-shaped creature moved to the side
      of the Rolling Dragon and patted its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horrifying Rolling Dragon suddenly became meek and submissive, and
      apparently, it enjoyed the praise of the half-human-shaped creature.
    </p>
    <p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked, alarmed.</p>
    <p>
      It was apparent now that the half-human-shaped being and the Rolling
      Dragon were on the same team. The Destroyer Wolf originally wanted to
      borrow the black pond, which was why it agreed to share the Sacred egg
      with the Rolling Dragon. Little did it expect that the Rolling Dragon had
      another partner, who wanted to kill the Destroyer Wolf and keep the Sacred
      egg all to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rolling Dragon King, the king of the Rolling Dragon Lake.” The
      half-human-shaped creature looked at Han Sen scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was dazed. Now he knew that the legendary creature in the Rolling
      Dragon Lake was this strange creature in front of him, not the black
      dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolling Dragon King walked to the side of the black pond. He picked up the
      Sacred egg and held it in his palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Kill him,” Rolling Dragon King said mildly, looking at the Sacred egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black dragon roared suddenly, then dashed toward Han Sen with the
      trident in its tail. Its claws and dragon teeth and trident were all
      terrifying weapons. Han Sen resisted the waves of attacks with his golden
      engraving shield.
    </p>
    <p>However, Han Sen kept stepping back under that aggressive force.</p>
    <p>
      The red light on Han Sen’s body surged as a pair of butterfly wings opened
      on Han Sen’s back, and at the same time, he entered Bloodthirsty Mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s power surged. He fought the black dragon for a long time, but it
      was a stalemate. Neither could defeat the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rolling Dragon King apparently didn’t intend to help the black dragon
      fight Han Sen. He pulled his arrow out of the Destroyer Wolf and wiped the
      blood on the wolf’s fur. Then, he stabbed the arrow down towards the
      cracked egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrow pierced the egg twice, but it couldn’t penetrate the crack of
      the Sacred egg. The Rolling Dragon King frowned, then his body gave off a
      bizarre black light. The black light infused the arrow, and he stabbed the
      arrow back toward the egg again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kacha! The arrow finally pierced the egg. The tip and part of the shaft
      both went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rolling Dragon King was exhilarated. He grabbed the arrow and tried to
      pull it back out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the next second, the Rolling Dragon King became horrified. He
      wasn’t able to pull the arrow out of the egg. Instead, his entire body was
      trembling as if he was being electrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black light was being pulled rapidly from his body, along the arrow, and
      down into the egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rolling Dragon King, did you really think I didn’t know you were the real
      master of Rolling Dragon Lake?” The Destroyer Wolf that was presumed to be
      dead gradually crawled up from the ground, which was inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The holes in its chest and head were healing so fast that the wounds were
      visibly shrinking. It glared at Rolling Dragon King with its wolf eyes,
      and it had a bizarre smile on its face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You…” The Rolling Dragon King was terrified as he realized that he had
      been tricked by the Destroyer Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was too late for him to regret now. His body was being pulled
      inescapably toward the Sacred egg. His power kept flooding into the egg,
      making him weaker and weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black dragon roared. It ditched Han Sen and rushed toward the Rolling
      Dragon King. It stabbed the Sacred egg with the trident on its tail,
      trying to separate the Sacred egg from the Rolling Dragon King.
