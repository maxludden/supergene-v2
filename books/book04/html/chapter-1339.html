    <p>Blergh!</p>
    <p>Han Sen fell out onto the grass, coughing blood.</p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was as cool as ever, and when she came out, she did so with a
      graceful drop on top of Han Sen’s head, pushing his face into the bloodied
      soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was immediately starting to regret bringing Bao’er, the silver
      fox, Little Angel, Golden Growler, and Moment Queen with him. He couldn’t
      imagine what the pain was like for them, to brace and stay composed on
      their ascension through the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fires Han Sen had to endure were of a greater intensity than what
      Xiang Yin and the Xuan Men successor had dealt with. The lecherous flames
      they suffered were far weaker, and despite Han Sen once fearing the steps
      those two had trodden, he now thought they had gotten off easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that aside, Han Sen had brought five people with him. This only
      boosted the intensity. He had felt as if the fires had been deliberately
      testing him in their wicked glow, like wretched demons taunting him to
      fail under the pressure of those he had selected to bring along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for Han Sen, he was able to employ the powers of super king
      spirit mode, Jadeskin, and the Dongxuan Sutra to pull through. He’d have
      most certainly failed had he tried to mount the steps without those
      abilities to boost his resistances.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way up, he started by trying his best to keep everyone calm,
      composed, and alive in the ascent. But there was little he could do when
      the true strength of the fire kicked in. It soon became clear to him that
      the only one he could truly protect and guide up was Bao’er, and the
      others would have to succeed by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was able to keep Bao’er shielded from most of the fire, but the
      flames had properly incinerated the silver fox. By the time he was
      through, he had become an egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Angel and Golden Growler were in a similar position; now evolving.
      Han Sen was unable to protect Moment Queen at all on the way up, and while
      she had managed to become a demigod, the fires had taken a toll on her.
      She was grievously injured, and it seemed as if there’d be little she
      could do for a long time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s fortunate I did not decide to bring anyone else. If I had, the fires
      would have surely killed me,” Han Sen said to himself, feeling glad he had
      made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took a look around, after that. He was in a field, one that was as
      plain as could be. A single wide expanse with no notable geography or
      landmarks to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked himself up and exerted much strength to do so. He was incredibly
      heavy, and it didn’t feel natural. The very air seemed to tingle and hum
      with energy, and the atmosphere around almost felt tangible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the gravity felt remarkably higher there. It was lucky his body was
      as strong as it was, and so it didn’t inhibit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, his clothes had been entirely scorched away by the fires.
      He was nude in the field, and although it was a touch awkward, he was at
      least relieved there was no one else around to see him that way.

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know what the Ultimate tag meant, but he was pleased that
      his lifespan had another one hundred added on top, bringing the number up
      to five hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen already knew there would be no more evolution requirements before
      coming to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary; even in the Alliance, there were no
      further evolution pools. It didn’t seem to matter much where you went
      after this, even if your geno points were at the max.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen caught sight of some odd shrubbery nearby. The bushes had thick
      leaves, and not wanting to remain naked, he brought Bao’er over to help
      him make some clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After crafting some makeshift clothing, he suddenly heard the chittering
      of an insect. It was a grasshopper, and it was making a squealing sound
      down in the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen gave it a scan and noticed its lifeforce to be obscenely weak. It
      didn’t look like a demigod in the least. And although it initially gave
      the impression it was just a common insect, it kept on squealing, as if to
      taunt Han Sen. He decided he was going kill it with Ghost Slash, and nab
      himself a few early geno points.
    </p>
    <p>But before he could attack, he felt a pain come onto his right eye.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen moved his hands to cup the afflicted eye, but then, another sharp
      pain began to pierce his left one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen swiftly started to look around and scan the surrounding vicinity
      for something else that might have been attacking him, but he could not
      see anything. The absence of danger he could visualize was strange, but
      his gut was most assuredly telling him something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grasshopper then scrambled away, disappearing someplace in the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could no longer feel its presence, but eyes still felt as if they
      were in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen used Dongxuan Aura to search. But strangely, he could not make
      out anything.
    </p>
    <p>Argh!</p>
    <p>
      An agonizing pain suddenly pierced Han Sen’s throat, but shortly after, it
      spread to his stomach. A cold sweat began to roll down his face, which was
      now twisting under the agony he was suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen decided to use Jadeskin, which gave him that crystallized luster.
      Following its use, even all his organs were turned to shimmering crystal.
      Han Sen could still feel the stabbing, but at least Jadeskin was enough to
      deny him the full experience of that pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then sought to examine himself with the ten gene locks of the
      Dongxuan Sutra open. After examining himself, Han Sen was able to notice
      the presence of something small and unnatural residing in his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a grey silkworm, of sorts. If he did not have Dongxuan Aura, he
      would have assuredly not been able to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the silkworm was very much like a needle, and it was
      undoubtedly the source of the pain Han Sen was experiencing. After more
      examination, Han Sen discovered it was not a creature, though. Instead, it
      was the grasshopper’s Demi-God Geno Core.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this bug, Han Sen was able to detect and learn the sequential
      structure of the grasshopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grasshopper came out of hiding once more, and it peered at Han Sen
      through the blades of grass. Not wanting to risk a single thing, Han Sen
      knew he’d have to kill it the first opportunity he had. He immediately
      cast Ghost Slash towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grasshopper was cut in half, when it was, the bug inside Han Sen’s
      stomach died with it.
