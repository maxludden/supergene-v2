    <p>
      The coins landed on the gold mask, but the phantom did not relent at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his fist, Han Sen moved forward to punch the gold mask, and when his
      fist was about to meet with it, his hand went right through it. It was
      like an ethereal object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next second, the gold mask planted itself neatly on Han Sen’s face.
      And the moment that occurred, Han Sen felt a weird power surge through his
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Slave; adhere to my commands and I will grant thee power!” the gold mask
      roared with a booming voice, with a speech that tried to invade Han Sen’s
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s brain had been fortified by the crystallizers, however. He tried
      to grab the gold mask on his face, and he noticed his fingers were now
      able to touch it. It had become a physical object.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen ripped it off of his face and held it in his hands.</p>
    <p>
      The gold mask squirmed and struggled. It was an incredibly weak thing
      after becoming solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Han Sen was going to destroy it with a punch, the gold mask
      pleaded, “Don’t hit me! Don’t hit me! I’ll swear allegiance to you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not expect the thing to be able to talk out loud like that.
      But it was audible all the same, even if the mask’s facial features did
      not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is your geno core level? What does it do?” Han Sen wanted to grill
      it for information before he agreed to its plight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am the gold geno core Gold Mask. I can attach myself to the face of
      anyone and then control them. Please don’t destroy me!” Gold Mask spoke
      with a creepy, unsettling voice.
    </p>
    <p>“That sounds useless,” Han Sen said.</p>
    <p>
      “It’s useful!” Gold Mask remarked, in shock. It quickly went on to say,
      “Master, you are just too strong. That is why I might appear useless right
      now. I can easily control normal creatures, even of sacred-blood strength.
      And what’s more, I can evolve to become a gemstone geno core and even a
      super geno core!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you kidding me? I’ve never heard of a geno core that was capable of
      evolving,” Han Sen coldly rebutted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I’m not kidding! I really can evolve. Take me with you, and you’ll
      see it first-hand. If I am unable to do this, you have my full permission
      to destroy me.” Gold Mask was scrambling to spit his words out.
    </p>
    <p>“Okay.” Han Sen didn’t really want the mask, even still.</p>
    <p>
      Gold Mask hastily gave Han Sen his mark, and then went straight into his
      Sea of Soul. Han Sen checked out the information it came with, and it did
      indeed say that it was able to evolve.
    </p>
    <p>Gold Mask: Spirit-Type Geno Core (Evolvable)</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was more than surprised. Geno cores required living things to
      evolve, and he had no clue a geno core could evolve by itself. Han Sen had
      only seen Little Angel and Golden Growler evolve by themselves, but they
      were beast souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gold Mask would save Han Sen a lot of trouble, though. He didn’t
      require a spirit to control the shelter, as the Gold Mask could do it for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>“Is that it?” Ling Mei’er couldn’t believe it was already over.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, this is your shelter now.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
    <p>
      It was Ling Mei’er’s shelter, technically, but Han Sen was its true master
      and controller.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I finally have a shelter to call my own!” Ling Mei’er happily swung the
      gate open to invite Snake King and the rest of her creatures inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen found his chance now to sneak back to the Alliance and retrieve
      Bao’er, so she could check out the Holy Vine.
    </p>
    <p>But when he returned home, Han Sen was in for a surprise.</p>
    <p>
      Luo Lan had gone to visit Han Yan in the military school a few days ago,
      while Mister and Missus Ji had gone away to resolve a few matters of their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a problem with Ji Yanran’s business, so only Bao’er had been
      left behind to look after Littleflower while the rest were absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er may have looked small, but she was capable of taking care of
      Littleflower for quite some time. There were a bunch of AI droids in the
      house, as well, which helped. They were all well-behaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was staring at Littleflower while suckling a milk bottle.
      Littleflower was doing the same, but with a smile. Bao’er placed a gentle
      hand on his jaw and suddenly got up, ran to Ji Yanran’s room, and
      unearthed a few makeup products.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t move, Littleflower. Let me make you prettier.” Bao’er grabbed a
      tube of lipstick and some eyeliner with an evil smile creeping across her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Littleflower was smiling happily at Bao’er with an unchanging expression,
      as Bao’er drew across his face, occasionally pausing in admiration of the
      work she had done upon her human canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she had fun doing this, she stopped. She sensed someone had entered the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s house was in an old town. It wasn’t a very fancy or expensive
      neighborhood, and neither did the house have much in the way of valuables.
      Every generation of the family had lived there, though, and because Luo
      Lan did not want to move away from there, that was where they all stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man opened the door and entered the house stealthily, closing the door
      as discreetly as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought the Alliance’s first super aristocrat would have a fancier
      house than this. I am a master thief; this place is far too easy for the
      likes of me to break into.” A man was speaking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked around and then pulled out a gadget. He pressed a bunch of
      buttons and all the alarm systems were disabled. Not even the robots
      functioned after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This really is too easy. I thought this would be challenging. A super
      aristocrat, the president’s son-in-law, has chosen to live in this dump
      with hardly any security? Pah!” The man walked straight into the next
      room.
    </p>
    <p>When he walked in there, he saw Bao’er and Littleflower.</p>
    <p>
      “It must be the smaller one; but why would that guy pay so much money for
      him?” The man knew no one was home, and his target was Littleflower.
