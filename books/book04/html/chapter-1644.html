      The Armored Man stared at Destiny Tower, and the flame of the body erupted
      like a volcano, and the aura he exuded became unimaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Armored Man is trying to kill Dollar directly. His power is so
      horrible when he gathers it like this. It seems that he’s gathering more
      power than he used to defeat Gu Qingcheng.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact that the Armored Man has gathered such terrifying power only
      shows that Dollar is stronger than Gu Qingcheng, so the Armored Man has to
      be serious.”
    </p>
    <p>“Dollar! Cheers! Beat him!”</p>
    <p>
      “That kind of power can kill with a single strike. If Dollar insists on
      fighting, then there will be no chance to concede.”
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The Armored Man slammed into Han Sen, and the flames were as bright as the
      sun. The entire battlefield was covered by intense ice, and the spectators
      could not see anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt the incredible power of the approaching attack, but he didn’t
      panic. He moved his hand and lifted Destiny’s Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blaze that was so strong, yet frighteningly, it disappeared completely
      in a flash. The sudden transition left the spectators temporarily blind.
      After they recovered their vision and saw the situation on the
      battlefield, they were all stunned and their mouths gaped open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flames on the battlefield had disappeared completely. Both the flames
      and the Armored Man had disappeared. Only a huge octagonal metal tower was
      standing on the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>“No way… The Armored Man was suppressed by a metal tower?”</p>
    <p>
      “It’s not that simple. With the power of the armor, even if the tower is a
      super geno core that uses sealing power, I think it will be broken by a
      punch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t even imagine what kind of geno core could suppress such a strong
      force.”
    </p>
    <p>“Let’s wait to see if the metal tower will be broken.”</p>
    <p>
      Everyone felt that a tower could not trap the Armored Man, so they were
      waiting for the metal tower to be broken. No one believed that the Armored
      Man would be so easily suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Han Sen did feel the pressure in the Destiny’s Tower, and a
      horrible force was confronting the power of the geno core, as if the tower
      would be broken at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Destiny’s Tower was not Han Sen’s self geno core. According to the theory,
      Han Sen’s power should not affect Destiny’s Tower. However, after running
      the Blood Legion technique, Han Sen felt that the tower was reacting
      strangely. The strength of the geno core was affected by Han Sen’s blood
      and flesh and the Blood Legion techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s own power surged and rushed into Destiny’s Tower, increasing the
      tower’s strength more and more. However, the Armored Man’s power was still
      slowly expanding inside the tower, and Han Sen still couldn’t suppress it
      with all his force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Han Sen had a tough choice. He had to suppress the Armored Man in the
      tower. If he let go now, Destiny’s Tower would be destroyed, and Han Sen
      would also be injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was still running the Blood Legion techniques, transforming his
      own power into the same fatal power as Destiny’s Tower. The strength of
      the Armored Man continued to grow, and it was definitely stronger than Han
      Sen’s own power. Han Sen couldn’t help but frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen hesitated to deal with it, the Real Blood geno core
      automatically flew out of Han Sen’s Sea of Soul. This time it was not
      flying toward another geno core or anything else, but it integrated into
      Han Sen’s body instead. Real Blood gradually merged into Han Sen’s blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the power of Han Sen’s blood and nerves increased sharply.
      Destiny’s Tower filled with light, suppressing the power inside the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was ecstatic. He hadn’t even known that Real Blood had such an
      ability, but it made perfect sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Real Blood geno core had been condensed by the blood vessels, and its
      compatibility with the Blood Legion techniques was undoubtedly the
      highest. It was also reasonable that it could enhance the Blood Legion
      techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen’s blood flowed, it was assimilated into Real Blood. At the same
      time, Han Sen’s blood, nerves, and Blood Legion techniques became stronger
      and stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infinite power passed through Destiny’s Tower to suppress the power
      inside the tower. The two forces collided fiercely in the tower, and Han
      Sen finally gained an advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Real Blood geno core also began to evolve in Han Sen’s blood. After it
      merged with Han Sen, the blood flow in his body helped the geno core
      breakthrough its bottleneck and achieve super level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was waiting for the moment when the metal tower got broken, but
      time passed by, and nothing happened to the tower. No cracks appeared on
      its surface.
    </p>
    <p>“What? Can the Armored Man not break the tower?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know, it looks like the tower is very solid.”</p>
    <p>
      “What is that geno core? How can it suppress the Armored Man? Even if it
      is a super geno core, isn’t it impossible to suppress the Armored Man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures watching the battle gradually began to discuss, and no one
      believed that a mighty existence like the Armored Man could be suppressed
      by a tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That tower, it seems…” The master of Sacred shelter looked at the tower,
      but his eyes were filled with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Could that be Destiny’s Tower?” Many ancient beings, like Sacred’s
      master, began to speculate.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dollar is too good! He just suppressed the armored like… That was f*cking
      amazing!” Tang Zhenliu could not help but scream excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng was slightly amazed. Although she didn’t think that Dollar
      would lose easily, she hadn’t expected anything like this to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn’t even do a thing, and the tower just suppressed the Armored Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Armored Man roared angrily in Destiny’s Tower, and the ice flames
      exploded like a volcano, trying to break the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the blood light emitted from the metal tower formed a bloody
      ring. It slowly began to contract outside the Armored Man, pressing the
      ice flame down a little.
    </p>
    <p>No matter how the Armored Man roared, the blood ring kept shrinking.</p>
    <p>Peng!</p>
    <p>
      The flames were shattered under the blood ring, and the blood ring made
      physical contact with the Armored Man, still shrinking. Surprisingly, the
      body of the Armored Man became smaller as the blood ring shrank, and
      finally disappeared with the blood ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, on the seventh floor of Destiny’s Tower, a stone
      platform appeared. The figure of the Armored Man appeared on the stone
      platform, but now he couldn’t move, just like a prisoner locked on a stone
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen finally felt that the resistance in the tower was completely gone.
      When he reached out, Destiny’s tower gradually shrank and flew back into
      his palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battlefield and all the Martial Halls were dead silent. Before this
      battle, they had debated many possibilities, but no one had thought that
      this would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The powerful Armored Man had been suppressed so easily, and everyone was
      staring at Han Sen, who stood on the battlefield and did not say a word
      for a long time.
