      Inside the cafe, Stay Up Late was wearing his uniform as he researched
      coffee. He suddenly frowned. He put down his tools and took off his apron
      and placed them on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stay Up Late, where are you going?” The manager looked at him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m going to the bathroom, I’ll be right back.” Stay Up Late smiled at
      the manager, and then walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked out the back door, and as soon as he stepped out, he ran
      straight back towards Han Manor. There, he saw the black tiger doing
      combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black tiger was about to strike Luo Lan, and Stay Up Late sighed to
      himself. He said, “This woman doesn’t even have geno armor, and yet she’s
      that cocky? Humans are so weak. But I promised Han Sen I’d keep his family
      safe. I’ll have to kill that guy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Stay Up Late was about to get closer, he stopped. He looked
      towards Luo Lan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the black tiger going to land a finishing strike on her, Ji Yanran
      and Zero looked on in shock. A hand had stopped the descent of that paw.
      The claws were held fast and unable to move.
    </p>
    <p>A strong human body was in front of her now, blocking the tiger.</p>
    <p>
      It was a man. He looked young, but he should have been middle-aged. The
      man’s face looked like ice, but there was a fire burning in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Lan only saw his back, but the moment she saw it, she looked so happy.
      She was too excited to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Touch… my… woman… and… die!” The man sounded very cold. His power was
      like that of a volcano, and he blasted the black tiger away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next second, the man disappeared and teleported in front of the
      descending black tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black tiger was surprised. He was squaring off against another human,
      but he had been sent flying while still wearing his geno armor. He was
      shocked by the power the man wielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He used the power of his geno armor and attempted to grab the man, but all
      of a sudden, he could not move.
    </p>
    <p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The man’s fists were like a rainstorm as they pelted into the black tiger.
      The constant sound of impacts chimed with the nonstop strikes at the
      armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raging fists kept on whacking the armor, and while the armor did not
      break, his power still penetrated the defense and shook the black tiger
      within. The black tiger’s organs became twisted, and he continuously
      choked up blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black tiger’s eyes turned red, and he looked extremely angry. His
      opponent was just a human, and what’s more, the man wasn’t even wearing
      geno armor. And that power he wielded could render the safety of the
      tiger’s armor inert. It was quite scary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scarier thing was that he couldn’t move. He kept on submitting to the
      pummeling.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      The black tiger realized that the crazy punching was beginning to crack
      the geno armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you?” the black tiger wanted to scream. He looked terrified, but
      he couldn’t make a noise.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The black tiger’s geno armor helmet was broken. The fist then came through
      the shards of helmet that remained, crushing the black tiger’s face. His
      face, after taking that punch, was a mess. The eyeballs fell from their
      sockets. The mouth was twisted, and teeth fell out as the creature puked
      more blood.
    </p>
    <p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The black tiger was like an airborne punching bag now. The fists kept on
      punching it as the entire body twisted more and more. Blood spilled like
      rain, and the bones kept breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran ran over to Zero and Luo Lan and helped get them up. She wanted
      to take them away, but she was frozen by the sight of that wretched fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late looked at the man in the air and was shocked. He said, “He
      isn’t wearing geno armor, and yet he is so strong. I didn’t expect a human
      could be as strong as this. If he had a geno armor, he might be
      qualified.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Interesting. What is the relationship between that man and Han Sen? And
      the woman must be Luo Lan. Does that mean he is Han Sen’s father? Or Luo
      Lan’s partner?” Stay Up Late continued looking at the man with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible! Impossible! A human that has no geno armor cannot do this.
      How is this possible?!” The black tiger was incredibly frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Yufei’s eyes looked murderous. He stretched his arm and delivered
      another punch to the black tiger’s chest. The cracking geno armor t
      finally shattered. It fell to pieces like shards of broken glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the armor’s protection, Han Yufei’s fist went right through the
      black tiger’s chest It cleaved its way through the bones, right into the
      creature’s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next second, as the black tiger looked on hopelessly, Han Yufei put
      another fist into the creature’s chest Then, he ripped the entire body in
      half with nothing but his bare hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood and organs fell to the ground with what was left of the battered
      body. Craters formed where they landed, and the man remained airborne,
      floating where he had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Yufei gave Luo Lan a gesture, and then, Luo Lan gestured back with
      excitement Han Yufei nodded, shook his head, and then disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mom, who is that?” Ji Yanran looked at Luo Lan and thought to herself,
      “Has she found a new boyfriend? She raised Han Sen and Han Yan alone, she
      should have a life of her own now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That was Han Sen’s father. That was your father-in-law.” Luo Lan looked
      at the vanished shadow and seemed disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I… I thought he…” Ji Yanran looked at her in disbelief. She spoke half of
      what she was going to, but thought something was amiss and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He had his reasons. Don’t say it out loud,” Luo Lan quietly responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they spoke, someone jumped in front of Ji Yanran. The person reached
      for Littleflower and gave an evil laugh. The person said, “Officers are
      predictable. He knew the black tiger would not get the job done, and he
      knew there was something wrong in the Han family. Han Yufei is not dead,
      and he is on the god level. He killed the black tiger with his geno armor,
      so he must be the heir of Han Jinzhi. I am going to take the credit”
