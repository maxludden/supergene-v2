<p>Saying Han Sen had become some sort of good officer was
something no one in Jade Wall City believed.</p>
<p>However, they all agreed that Han Sen’s sword skills were
strong. It made everyone’s faces change. No matter how much they
disliked Han Sen, they had to confess that his sword skills were
very strong, and he was likely the No. 1 swordsmen in the
universe.</p>
<p>In the palace, Han Sen sat near Qin Jing Zhen. He put his hand
on Qin Jing Zhen’s forehead and frowned.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s condition has become a more dire following the
hassle he had just been through. If he did not have a few
miraculous sacrifice items, he would have died already.</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s eyes shimmered with tears as he asked, “Han Sen, how
are the wounds on my father? Do you suspect he will die?”</p>
<p>Qin Bai was naive. If this were anyone else, they would not have
asked a question like that in front of Qin Jing Zhen. He just did
not know what to avoid</p>
<p>“Do not worry,” Han Sen said. “With me here, he will not die. At
least, not right now he won’t.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked happy. “I knew it! Whatever happens, I will just
go and look for you. You can save Father.”</p>
<p>After that, Qin Bai ran next to Qin Jing Zhen with a face that
was still scrawled with tears. He happily grabbed his hand and
said, “Father, this is great. Han Sen can save you. You can
live!”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen smiled. He stroked Qin Bai’s head and said, “This
is great. My son, please go and rest up. Teacher Han still needs to
heal me. You should not be here to disturb him.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked at Han Sen, who nodded at him. “With me here, you
can go rest.”</p>
<p>“In that case, my father’s life is in your hands, Han Sen.” Qin
Bai had been following Qin Jing Zhen in praying for the Qin family
elites in their old buildings. It was unknown how far he had run.
After being busy for so long, he was now very tired. Now that Han
Sen was back, he felt solid. He also felt extremely tired.</p>
<p>After watching Qin Bai leave, Qin Jing Zhen asked Han Sen,
“Teacher Han, how are my wounds? Tell me honestly. I need to set up
a time and date for my funeral.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen made Han Sen a teacher, so Han Sen now had that
title.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed and said, “If your wounds hadn’t got any worse,
with my powers, you could have lived for five years. If you handled
things well, maybe another two years beyond that. Now, your wounds
have triggered depression. Things have gone very bad. Even if I do
my best, you can only live for another three years.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen did not feel sad. He laughed and said, “Of course,
three years is not enough. Even if you gave me 300 years, I would
be unable to accomplish all that I wish to. Three years is still
enough for me to do many things. I will still have time to do
things for my son and ensure he has a nice kingdom to handle when
the time comes.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Qin Jing Zhen grabbed Han Sen by the hand. He
looked at Han Sen with eyes that looked like they were on fire.
“Teacher Han, are you willing to take care of my son for me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what Qin Jing Zhen meant, but he could not
promise anything willy-nilly. He sighed and said, “My King, your
wounds can actually change. Perhaps in the future, there will be a
chance for you to look after the crown prince yourself.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen shook his head. “I know my body. I can live for
three more years, but you have already helped change my fate. In
this world, who else can I ask to help me? Who else can possibly
increase the time of my life more than what you can give me?”</p>
<p>“Maybe there is,” Han Sen said. “Perhaps the person that injured
you in the first place can.” Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes looked bright but
immediately dimmed. With a wry smile, he asked, “If she hurt me,
why would she heal me? You do not have to give me idle words of
comfort, Teacher. Right now, the only thing I do not want to let go
of is my son. I am afraid that after I die, he will become naughty.
He is not king material, but he is my only son. I am afraid he will
bring harm to the Qin Kingdom —not only to civilians but also his
own life. If things were like that, he should not be king. What do
you think?”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “Everyone in the Qin Kingdom thinks I
am an evil officer. People like me. Why would I care for the
civilians? It does not matter if the crown prince is a good king or
a tyrant. To an evil officer, there can be no difference. I only
need to know that he is the Qin Bai I know. That will be
enough.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen laughed and said, “Good, good, good. After hearing
what you’ve said, I do feel safer.”</p>
<p>While they were laughing, Qin Jing Zhen coughed. Some blood came
out.</p>
<p>“My King, please do not resist my power,” Han Sen said. “I need
to suppress the wounds on your body. This process cannot be
disturbed.”</p>
<p>“You guys leave the room. No matter what happens, even if I die,
you will have to listen to whatever Teacher Han tells you,” Qin
Jing Zhen said that to the officers and then kicked them all
out.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Qin Jing Zhen was just being nice. He had placed a
lot of trust in him. It was like he was forfeiting his life into
his hands.</p>
<p>“My King, whatever you see, you should not tell people.” After
saying that, Han Sen broke the rules of the universe. He used his
Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly had white hair and white eyes. He placed his
hand on Qin Jing Zhen’s forehead.</p>
<p>“You… You… You are a God Spirit… Mister…” When he saw Han Sen’s
face, Qin Jing Zhen was well and truly shocked.</p>
<p>Humans were human. Even if they used some kind of power or
combined with a God Spirit, they would never look like a God
Spirit.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen had a pure God Spirit body. It was different from
how a human appeared. That was why Qin Jing Zhen thought Han Sen
was a God Spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and did not say anything about it. He put his
power into Qin Jing Zhen’s body. He used his Super God Spirit power
to suppress Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit power that was inside
the king’s body.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen held his tongue not to say a word, but his heart
felt like a boat lost on a stormy sea. “Han Sen is a God Spirit.
What kind of level is this God Spirit though? Even an Annihilation
God Spirit could not fix my wounds, but he can. Is its level a
level above Annihilation God Spirit?”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s heart felt like a rolling boulder.</p>
<p>His trust in Han Sen was just a show for Han Sen and the others.
In fact, he never actually trusted anybody. That was a simple way
to be a king Plus, Han Sen was very strong. He was afraid Han Sen
would one day do something to the Qin Kingdom or Qin Bai. That was
only because he was powerless to stop it. Thus, he was treating Han
Sen so kindly.</p>
<p>He now knew Han Sen was a God Spirit. The stone in his heart
fell. He was no longer worried Han Sen would do something to Qin
Bai or the Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>God Spirits wanted different things from humans. Being a leader
was a very attractive concept for humans. To a God Spirit, even the
lowest level God Spirit, they would not want to be a king of a
kingdom. That was especially true for someone as powerful as Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“God bless my son. In the future, with Teacher Han at his side…
No… With Mister God Spirit looking after my son, even if it cannot
last forever, he will at the least be blessed all of his life. My
son is a lucky guy.”</p>
