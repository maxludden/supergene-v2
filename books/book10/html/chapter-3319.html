<p>The Story of Genes brought a Break World power that completely
destroyed the gene messages.</p>
<p>The geno tablet that originally suppressed his body relinquished
its control. Han Sen was let free. The Dongxuan Armor generated a
black set of armor, but it was burning with a white flame. Black
and white, the two colors, made a strong contrast.</p>
<p>“Huh? How can the genes of your body produce such grand
changes?” The emotionless geno tablet made some unexpected
confusing sounds. It was as if it was unable to understand.</p>
<p>Han Sen was no longer in the mood to talk nonsense with it.
After his body was freed, he wanted to use his Galaxy Teleportation
to get out of the geno tablet.</p>
<p>No matter which direction he went or how far he went, all he
could see was an endless sea of stars. It was like that place was
incredibly big.</p>
<p>The geno tablet’s sounds were in Han Sen’s head again. “Weird.
The genes of your body have the shadow of a super gene, but it is
just a replica of the real thing. The geno arts you practice are
still on a testing level. They have great flaws, yet they can make
the genes of your body evolve to this level. How could this have
happened?”</p>
<p>Along with the geno tablet’s voice, numerous tentacles were
emerging in the sea of stars. They came racing toward Han Sen. His
xenogeneic body’s speed was not enough to avoid the tentacles. His
body was quickly snared.</p>
<p>The power, which looked like electricity, came crackling out of
the appendages. They made Han Sen feel as if his body was quaking.
He immediately released The Story of Genes’ Break World power.
Under the explosion of white flames, it made Han Sen’s body
suddenly feel as if he had an unlimited amount of power.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s Break World power was buffed by The Story of Genes.
It made it clearer. It made Han Sen’s genes more stable. The
electricity from the tentacles could no longer get into his
body.</p>
<p>“Good.” Han Sen was very happy. He cast the Dongxuan Sutra’s
Break World power. The structure of the tentacles, which he could
not analyze before, were now able to be seen via his eyes.</p>
<p>“Super Spank!” Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power exploded. It
made the tentacles capturing Han Sen shatter.</p>
<p>The Story of Genes’ Break World power was not special by itself,
but it greatly improved the three geno arts in Han Sen’s body. It
was like his body had become extra strong because of it.</p>
<p>That was especially true of his xenogeneic mode. It worked on
his body but on the three geno arts more.</p>
<p>The geno tablet’s voice sounded again. “You are truly a very
weird creature. Your soul genes are not strong, but the fact you
can evolve to this level is truly remarkable.”</p>
<p>This time, the weird, giant planet, appeared. It was impossible
to tell where it came from, but it was now directly in front of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>The giant planet twisted in its spot as a countless number of
transparent tentacles came wriggling out to snare Han Sen. He was
able to break each and every one of the tentacles. Even so, it only
led to the development of more coming his way. They lecherously
wished to snatch up his body. When they grabbed a hold of him, they
yanked him into the planet.</p>
<p>Light flickered across the tentacles. It was like there was a
substance going into Han Sen’s body, but the Jadeskin-looking body
shut them out.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried his best to destroy the tentacles, but the
tentacles were simply endless.</p>
<p>“Very interesting genes. Although you are not the life I wanted,
such an interesting life and genes could make you suitable for
becoming a part of my body.” When Han Sen heard that, his body
froze. Something was latching onto his back, but he didn’t know
what it was.</p>
<p>Some weird bones were coming out of his back to lock up Han Sen.
From afar, Han Sen looked as if he had been snared by a
skeleton.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Han Sen’s body was locked up by a skeleton. He could not
move freely. It felt as if the skeleton was sticking needles into
his body.</p>
<p>“The Super God Spirit mode!” Han Sen used his Super God Spirit
mode. He wanted to use his spirit body to shake off the skeleton
that had him in its grip.</p>
<p>Nothing he tried seemed to work. His spirit body was firmly
snared by the skeleton, and he was unable to escape it. The bones
inside his body were like syringes stripping him of his power.</p>
<p>“Interesting genes. I cannot believe that you are an ordinary
soul gene and have been able to evolve a gene to this level.” A
voice came from the skeleton. It sounded exactly like the voice Han
Sen had been listening to earlier.</p>
<p>“Who on earth are you?” Han Sen used his Super Spank power. He
could not free himself from the clutch of the skeleton.</p>
<p>“I told you that I am the geno tablet,” the geno tablet said as
its voice returned.</p>
<p>“In that case, why are you here waiting for the leader of the
God Chaos Party?” Han Sen held himself strong against the pain that
was pulling the marrow from his bones. He gnashed his teeth.</p>
<p>Han Sen was curious, but he was not that curious in a
life-and-death moment.</p>
<p>The reason he asked that was purely because he wished to make an
important decision.</p>
<p>“He is the real master here,” the geno tablet replied. “It is my
job to wait for him to come back and command. There is no why.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was depressed. People could come there to be a boss, but
he was there to have his genes stolen by the geno tablet. That was
a bad sort of treatment.</p>
<p>The geno tablet’s reply gave Han Sen an answer to a private
decision.</p>
<p>“I hope big sky demon did not lie to me.” Han Sen gnashed his
teeth. He gathered up power in his finger and used it like a knife.
He went into the sea of stars.</p>
<p>The endless sea of stars was the geno tablet. Carving into the
sea of stars was basically carving into the geno tablet. Han Sen
could not get rid of the geno tablet, so he had to risk the
24-spell password that big sky demon had given him.</p>
<p>If God Chaos Party Leader was the master of the geno tablet, and
if the 24-spell password was real, it would work on the geno
tablet.</p>
<p>Knife light appeared on Han Sen’s middle finger. He used Super
Spank to slash the sea of stars. He left many knife marks across
the sea of stars.</p>
<p>the knife marks were messed up. They did not make the
password.</p>
<p>“Stop wasting your breath,” the geno tablet’s voice sounded in
Han Sen’s ear. “I am connected to the universe, and I am a part of
it. It should be an honor for you to become a part of my body.”</p>
<p>“I do not want any honor. All I want is to kill you.” Han Sen
gnashed his teeth. His body tremored. The pain of having his power
being taken away was not something ordinary people could
endure.</p>
<p>“Death is pointless for me, and your power is useless at trying
to destroy the geno tablet,” the geno tablet explained. “Unless the
universe itself is destroyed, the geno tablet will recover.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah? Well, how about this?” Han Sen asked. His middle
finger arose. A scary knife light landed across the sea of stars.
He slashed a big knife mark across the sea of stars.</p>
<p>After that slash, all the messed-up knife marks Han Sen had
unleashed came back. Earlier, it might have looked like he was
doodling. Now, it had all come together to compose a spell. Han Sen
added the last slash on every password. It lit up.</p>
