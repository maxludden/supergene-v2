    <p>
      After what felt like a century to Han Sen, he heard a giant rumbling
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s entire body bounced up, hitting the top of the tower, and then
      fell back to the floor. After that, things went back to normal. The metal
      tower stopped shaking, the energies suffusing the tower vanished, and
      everything was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it finished? Who won?” Han Sen climbed up from the floor, shook his
      head, and looked around. “Little Silver, Little Star, are you both okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Silver, Little Star, and that little Ice Seahorse all climbed up
      from the ground, shaking their heads and bodies, looking dizzy.
      Fortunately, none of them were injured. Though their forces were a bit
      weaker, nothing appeared to be seriously wrong with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was relieved seeing them all okay. He then ran to the tower window
      and looked outside, and he was shocked by what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tower was now submerged in water, as if it were in an aquarium. Many
      sea creatures were visible through the window, swimming around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen reached out his hands, and what he touched was indeed water. He
      looked up, and there was something that looked like blurry clouds above
      them. There were many strange cracks in the surface of the blurry clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took a serious look, and then he realized what had happened. The
      metal tower had cracked the ice and sunk into the ocean, and now they were
      at the bottom of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a few marine creatures were visible, but he couldn’t see the rockman
      or the Black Armor Foe anywhere he looked. The marine creatures only had
      mutant lifeforces at best, so they were not a threat to Han Sen. Han Sen
      decided to venture out of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen swam toward the cracks in the ice, and after he reached the
      surface, he found himself surrounded by icebergs and unable to see the
      mountains anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are we not in God’s Ruin anymore?” Han Sen looked around, but he couldn’t
      feel that strange power around him anymore, which meant he was no longer
      in God’s Ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Headless Rockman and the Black Armor Foe had been fighting for such a
      long time that their access to God’s Ruin had closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked around, but he couldn’t see the Headless Rockman or the
      Black Armor Foe, and neither could he sense the power ripples around him,
      so he dived back towards the metal tower in the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Silver looked much better, and the others had also regained
      consciousness. Little Silver was healing the Little Ice Seahorse’s
      injuries using his lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Little Star, it had already reached super level, so it had a much
      stronger body and wasn’t injured very badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen ran down to the first floor, but he couldn’t find that headless
      stone figure. As for the metal tower, its first floor was completely
      empty. Aside from the technique inscribed on the walls, nothing was left.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just as I expected; the Headless Rockman was the headless stone figure in
      the tower,” Han Sen thought. “Where did he go, I wonder? Can I control the
      metal now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite having been used to fight that horrifying Black Armor Foe for so
      long, the metal tower was so sturdy that it wasn’t damaged. It was
      definitely a top-tier item.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the fight, Han Sen had sensed that he was somehow connected to the
      metal tower, so he wondered if it would be possible for him to claim the
      metal tower for his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he couldn’t sense the connection between him and the metal tower
      anymore. Han Sen hesitated, and then he used his techniques again, letting
      his body enter that strange state.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so, he immediately felt the bizarre connection between him and
      the metal tower. It was stronger than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had tried to control the metal tower while the Headless Rockman
      and the Black Armor Foe were fighting, but he hadn’t been successful. Now
      that the Headless Rockman was gone, however, there was a chance that he
      might succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was just giving a shot. He might be able to bring the metal tower
      under his control if things went well, and even if he couldn’t do it, he
      would lose nothing by trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen moved his thoughts, and the metal tower immediately started to
      shake, making rumbling noises as if it were falling down. Han Sen quickly
      got out of the metal tower with Little Silver and the others, then turned
      to look back at the metal tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tower shook and began to shrink quickly, and after only a short while,
      it reduced to the size of a man’s palm. The power inside Han Sen’s body
      was flowing, and the tower shot into his Sea of Soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, there was a familiar voice echoing beside Han Sen’s
      ears, which exhilarated him, “Emperor Geno Core Godly Tower gained.”
    </p>
    <p>“Emperor Geno core. It’s indeed a top-tier item.”</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t know the exact differences between emperor geno cores and
      super geno cores, but he knew that emperors should correspond to berserk
      super creatures, so emperor cores would be more powerful than super cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to summon the Godly Tower to check its power, Han Sen
      felt a strong headache and his body began to twitch. He had to deactivate
      the skill and return his body to its normal state first.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after deactivating the skill and trying to summon the Godly
      Tower, he found that he couldn’t connect to it anymore. The tower was
      slumbering in his Sea of Soul like a dead object.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can I only utilize the Godly Tower while I’m transformed?” Han Sen was a
      little bummed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he could only summon the Godly Tower while he had that weird skill
      running, then he would only be able to use it for a short period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took Bao’er and the others to swim out of the ocean and return to
      the icebergs. He wanted to figure out where they were, but they were
      surrounded by icebergs and ocean, and he couldn’t see a single ice
      mountain. Apparently, they were already far from God’s Ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Han Sen had no idea where they were, he needed to pick a direction
      to travel. He picked south.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Star was carrying all of them, which allowed them to move quickly
      and with little effort, and with Little Silver present, most creatures
      wouldn’t dare to get close to them. After only a few days, they had
      stepped out of the ice zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything around them looked strange, and Han Sen had no idea where they
      were. Han Sen had to ask Little Star to keep heading south, and after only
      ten miles, he heard people fighting somewhere in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Humans?” Han Sen smiled as he listened to the noises. That yelling could
      only come from humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took Little Silver and walked forward. If they were really humans,
      he could at least ask them where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      After climbing through some mountains, he saw several humans encircling a
      mutant creature. Amazingly, he knew one of the humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the group wasn’t doing well. Although the humans were working
      together to fight the mutant creature, it was still crushing them. They
      could barely maintain their formation.
