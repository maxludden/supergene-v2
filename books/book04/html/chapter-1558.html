    <p>
      “Why are we doing this in the near future instead of now?” asked Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao answered, “I’ve talked about this with the Luo’s, but I haven’t
      reached an agreement with them yet. It might take a little time, but you
      can relax. After I’ve reached a deal with the Luo’s, I’ll definitely count
      you in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen immediately knew what Jia Shidao meant. Jia Shidao himself wasn’t
      able to kill those super creatures, so he wanted to cooperate with the
      Luo’s, but he was afraid that the Luo’s would betray him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Han Sen had come, he wanted to use Han Sen to balance the Luo’s.
      That would be to Jia Shidao’s benefit, or at least, it might keep him from
      being exploited by either party.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible that Jia Shidao had arranged for Han Sen and Luo Yu to run
      into each other. He might have wanted to see first-hand whether the
      relationship between Han Sen and the Luo’s was really that bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Though Jia Shidao has a good plan, the Luo’s are too tyrannical to give
      him this chance. He might need to make a choice between us after all.” Han
      Sen didn’t say it out loud. Instead, he agreed that he would stay in
      Godslayer Shelter for a couple of days to wait for Jia Shidao’s news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen made good use of the time, absorbing the rest of his life geno
      essences. Now, his super gene count had already reached 26 points, and his
      body was greatly improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then went back to the Alliance and told his family that he was
      okay.
    </p>
    <p>
      After only a couple of days, Jia Shidao went to Han Sen again, and he
      smiled and said, “Brother Han, I’m really worried. Luo Yu heard that
      you’re joining, and now there’s no way that he will go along with it, no
      matter what I say. This place belongs to the Luo’s, so I don’t know what
      to do…”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t very concerned about what Jia Shidao had said. Apparently,
      Jia Shidao had chosen to side with the Luo’s over him.
    </p>
    <p>“Then I’ll just wish you all good luck,” Han Sen said, then left.</p>
    <p>
      “Old Jia, are you really cooperating with the Luo’s?” A demigod following
      Jia Shidao asked him after Han Sen left.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I just didn’t expect the relationship between the Luo’s and Han Sen to be
      this bad. If Han Sen joins, Luo Yu and the others will quit completely. If
      I have to choose between them, I think the Luo’s are more reliable, so
      that’s the only decision I can make,” said Jia Shidao.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why didn’t you choose Han Sen? He is incredibly powerful. And he’s only
      one person, so we wouldn’t have to share as much of the profits,” said the
      demigod, confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao shook his head and said, “We know that Han Sen is powerful, but
      we don’t know exactly how powerful. We all know the strength of the Luo’s,
      though. Besides, Han Sen hasn’t practiced the Falsified-Sky Sutra. We’re
      already depending on the Luo’s for our survival, so it’s better if we side
      with them.”
    </p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen left Jia Shidao’s house, he intended to leave Godslayer
      Shelter. He had just been trying his luck; now that the deal had fallen
      through, he found no reason to stay here any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, before Han Sen could reach the gate of the shelter, he saw Luo Li
      standing near him.
    </p>
    <p>“The Godslayer wants to see you,” said Luo Li, directly.</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t want to see him.” Han Sen wasn’t very fond of Luo Haitang, so he
      rejected Luo Li directly. He walked around her, leaving Godslayer Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>“He wants to talk about Han Yan.” What Luo Li said stopped Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      “There’s nothing to talk about. Don’t think you can drag Little Yan down
      just because she’s practiced the Falsified-Sky Sutra. Her last name is
      Han, not Luo,” said Han Sen, dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s useless for you to say anything to me. You can just talk about it to
      the Godslayer, or are you scared?” said Luo Li.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, I’ll go to him and talk.” Han Sen knew that Luo Li was provoking
      him, but what she said did make sense. Also, he was powerful enough to
      talk with Luo Haitang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wouldn’t involve Han Yan in that endless vicious cycle, no matter
      what. That was an abyss, and if she was trapped in it, she’d never get
      out. Han Sen would rather die than let something like that happen to his
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>“Please.” Luo Li made a gesture and started to lead the way.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen followed Luo Li all the way to a room in the shelter. Han Sen
      thought that the place where Luo Haitang lived would be exquisite, if not
      luxurious, yet he was shocked when he saw the residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang’s home was very frugal. It was so simple that it only had a
      bed, a desk, and a chair. Other than that, the entire room was bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang had come to see Han Sen once, when an accident in the
      sanctuary had left Han Sen gravely injured. Now, Luo Haitang looked
      exactly the same as he had then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang was sitting behind the desk, looking at Han Sen. The legendary
      Godslayer Luo, who had roamed the sanctuaries as he pleased, looked like
      an ordinary middle-aged man. He wasn’t aggressive at all. He looked at Han
      Sen peacefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t even think about exploiting Little Yan. She’s a Han, not a Luo. You
      have no right to make her fight for your family,” Han Sen said
      straightforwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang wasn’t upset. He waved his hand, then Luo Li left the room,
      closing the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen opened his mouth to say something, but Luo Haitang spoke first.
      “I’m dying.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked for a moment. He looked carefully at Luo Haitang, but
      he found that Luo Haitang was still quite lively, and there was no sign of
      him withering away. The power inside him was still terrific. He didn’t
      look like someone who was going to die at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you really think you can trick Little Yan into fighting for you? Your
      life is the business of your family, and it has nothing to do with mine,”
      Han Sen said apathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang sighed. “If there was actually someone useful in my family, I
      wouldn’t have gone to you two, and I wouldn’t have used the methods that I
      did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang paused for a short while and went on to say, “As long as I’m
      alive, I won’t let you juniors carry such a fate. But I am truly dying,
      and I only have five years left to live. The next battle against the Jade
      Shura will happen in six years, but I won’t make it that long. I can only
      ask Han Yan to take over the fight; that’s the only chance we have of
      surviving.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Again, that’s your concern, which has nothing to do with us. Let me
      repeat myself: there’s no way that Little Yan will help you Luo’s fight,”
      said Han Sen, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang shook his head. “She’s practiced the real Falsified-Sky Sutra.
      Even if she’s not going, the Jade Shura will look for her.”
