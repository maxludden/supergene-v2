      “Are you sure I can revive the holy child?” Gu Qingcheng always sounded
      like she was certain Han Sen could get the job done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng smiled. “If an Elysium spirit became a priest, the holy child
      would ignore them. You are human, and that’s different. Furthermore, you
      perform well. If she wanted to make a move, she was bound to wake up
      sooner rather than later.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng looked at the woman on the painting and said, “Am I right?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone did not reply, and the green-clothed woman pretended not to hear
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you still need to hurry. There is only a month left to go,” Gu
      Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen asked, “Then what marks her as revived?”</p>
    <p>
      “You need to get her to leave the painting,” Gu Qingcheng replied to Han
      Sen swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng left after that. Han Sen looked back at the woman in the
      painting, and he noted how strange the relationship between the two must
      have been. What Gu Qingcheng said had been intoned for the woman in the
      painting to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hey, beautiful! What’s the relationship between you and Gu Qingcheng?”
      Han Sen asked the painted lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is none of your business, wimp.” The green-clothed woman seemed
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Humans only live once. I have to be careful!” Han Sen did not think
      fearing death was a bad thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is nothing else you can do now, anyway. You’ll have to go to the
      Geno Battleground. It’ll be fun, seeing how you end up dying.” The woman’s
      words were chilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen heard her, though, he was happy. That meant she really might
      exit the painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen chatted a little more with her, but overall, she sounded upset.
      Eventually, she retreated into silence and stopped talking completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, the Dongxuan Sutra had its breakthrough. Han Sen’s body
      evolved, and so did the Bulwark Umbrella. The umbrella was now a silver
      geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jadeskin was getting close to the breakthrough point as well. It wouldn’t
      be much longer until that followed suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that day, the green-clothed woman continued to ignore Han Sen
      completely. It made him worry quite a bit, as the deadline for the deal
      with Ghost Moon was getting near.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the green-clothed woman did not exit the painting in three months, and
      Ghost Moon was then made priest, Gu Qingcheng had said she would behead
      Han Sen. Whether or not she’d actually do it remained to be seen, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter what Han Sen said to her, the lady ignored him. He tried to
      discuss serious matters, tell jokes, and even read her stories. It was all
      to no avail, and he might as well have been talking to any old stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three months were over. In that time, Crystal Core also managed to
      reach silver. Only Real Blood and Dollar were still bronze geno cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the deadline hit, the green-clothed woman was continuing to
      ignore Han Sen. While Han Sen’s mind raced for an idea of what he might do
      next, Gu Qingcheng appeared in the garden with a few spirits in tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ghost Moon was there, and she bowed to Gu Qingcheng. “Master, three months
      have elapsed. The human failed to revive her. Please, allow me to replace
      him as priest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That was the deal. You will indeed replace him as priest.” Gu Qingcheng
      nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you, Master.” Ghost Moon and the spirits all looked delighted, and
      they all bowed before Gu Qingcheng.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I also said I would remove his head if he failed within the three months
      he was given. Now that you have become the priest, I will give this task
      to you. You may be the one to execute him,” Gu Qingcheng coldly told Ghost
      Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ghost Moon did not hesitate. She pulled out her scimitar and immediately
      approached Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had been thinking about how he might escape, and if there truly
      was no way to get out of the shelter, then he’d have to just run to the
      Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fitness was good, but his geno cores were still lacking. At least he
      was able to practice and work on his geno cores in the Alliance. When he
      got the geno cores to gemstone class, he could teleport back and perhaps
      escape Elysium Shelter under those conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a plan in mind, he moved in front of a tower. When Ghost Moon came
      close, he was going to run inside and leap into the teleporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hang on!” Before Han Sen made his move, the green-clothed lady suddenly
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone turned to look toward the stone in shock. Gu Qingcheng smiled, as
      if she knew this would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painting suddenly looked like a swirling vortex, as if a spinning tear
      in the dimension had manifested upon it. The green-clothed woman, with her
      umbrella, began walking out of the painting.
    </p>
    <p>Not long after, she emerged into the garden like a real human.</p>
    <p>
      She looked exactly like Gu Qingcheng. They went to stand next to each
      other, and they were so identical, no one could tell them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the spirits, Ghost Moon included, suddenly knelt before the
      green-clothed lady and said, “The holy child!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep him as the priest and let him join the Geno Battleground,” the
      green-clothed lady said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces of all the Elysium spirits changed, but no one dared to
      challenge or second-guess her command. After the green-clothed lady said
      this, she exited the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen quickly followed after her. He ignored the angry stares of all the
      Elysium spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you for saving me,” Han Sen quietly told her. The Elysium spirits
      had stopped following after they reached the geno core storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green-clothed woman coldly rolled her eyes and responded, “I am not so
      nice that I would save a wimp. I’m dragging you to die elsewhere, that’s
      all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The green-clothed lady walked into the geno core storage teleporter. She
      used her umbrella to enter, as if it were a key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought to himself, “The geno core storage has tiers. With my
      power, there should be nothing to fear. No one should be able to kill me
      where I’m going. Perhaps I’ll just level up quick, and that’s that. Plus,
      our tiers might be different and we won’t be compatible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked around the geno core storage. He had come here a lot, but
      it didn’t seem as if anything had changed. He was unable to tell if this
      place had indeed been modified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used his Bulwark Umbrella as the key to enter the geno core
      storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a flash, and when his vision returned, Han Sen was shocked by
      what he saw. The moon had turned red, and the mountain river and trees
      were red, too. It was all so very weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no Rockman, and neither was there a geno core tablet. There was
      only a teleporter, and the woman was standing near it, watching him.
