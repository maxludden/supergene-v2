<p>Steel Scene was murdered inside Ice Snow God Temple. Gong Shu
Zhi, Si Tu Ya, and Lu San Zhi were murdered inside Ice Snow City’s
Steel Manor. The news was heard all over Jade Wall City.</p>
<p>The king’s guard’s main general was a character who lived in
Jade Wall City and enjoyed quite a high reputation. He was in
charge of the safety of Jade Wall City, yet he was murdered inside
his own house. It had been over a century since something that
terrible had happened in Jade Wall City.</p>
<p>Assassins from other kingdoms killing officers in the Qin
Kingdom was not rare. For Han Sen to kill a god-blood noble like
Steel Scene so obviously inside his god temple was something the
likes of which had never happened before.</p>
<p>The ripple effects of this event were likely very bad.</p>
<p>Many high-class nobles knew about it. They knew about what had
happened. They thought Feng Fei Fei and Han Sen were going to wind
up injured, yet Han Sen had turned up fine. He had actually gone to
Steel Manor and slew Steel Scene. When they heard the news, they
were so shocked that they were rendered speechless.</p>
<p>This thing affected too many things. Liu Xian Xian and the
others quickly reported the events and summoned the elites of the
king’s guard. They raced to Feng Fei Fei’s castle.</p>
<p>le</p>
<p>The king’s guards had 14 branches. Steel Scene was the leader of
the entire king’s guards, but that did not mean he was the
strongest in the king’s guards. The real power of the king’s guards
resided in Zhao Long from Dragon Guard and Liu Xian Xian from the
Phoenix Feather.</p>
<p>Those two were the true might of the king’s guards. That was
especially true of Zhao Long. He was considered the best among the
king’s guards.</p>
<p>Even though they were more powerful than Steel Scene, they still
had to be below Steel Scene on the corporate ladder because their
backgrounds were fairly average. They had no choice but to be
subordinated.</p>
<p>The Dragon Guard and Wind Feather Guard were in charge of the
two areas closest to the palace. The power of those two regiments
was greater than the rest of the 14 teams.</p>
<p>Now, Steel Scene had been murdered. The 14 teams were on the
move. Zhao Long and Liu Xian Xian were leading the army to Feng Fei
Fei’s castle.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they did not have much hope. It was unlikely
for someone to commit such a big crime and return to an obvious
place.</p>
<p>When they reached Feng Fei Fei’s castle, they were shocked to
learn Han Sen was inside Feng Fei Fei’s castle. He acted as if
nothing had happened. He was just relaxing and playing chess with
Crown Prince Qin Bai.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, your method of playing chess is very interesting. We
must play again.” Zhao Long and Liu Xian Xian came before Han Sen.
Crown Prince Qin Bai was happily speaking to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince.” Zhao Long and Liu Xian Xian and all the
other soldiers bowed before Qin Bai. Zhao Long said, “Han Sen
invaded the Steel Manor. He murdered the main general of the king’s
guard, Steel Scene, and the leader of the Thunder Lion Riders, Liu
San Zhi, as well as Gong Shu Zhi and Si Tu Ya. I am going to arrest
him and have him judged.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked at Han Sen with shock. He then looked at Zhao
Long. “Really? When did that happen?”</p>
<p>Zhao Long answered, “Half an hour ago.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai shook his head. “You guys must have made a mistake. Han
Sen has been playing chess with me all day. He did not leave for
one minute. How could he have murdered someone?”</p>
<p>The expressions of Zhao Long and the other people with him
changed. If that had been spoken by someone else, they would not
have cared about it. They would have even arrested the person who
had said such a thing.</p>
<p>But this was the crown prince of the Qin Kingdom. It was Qin Bai
who had said it, and he was the only child of the Qin Kingdom. They
were unable to do anything.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, are you sure you were with him all day?
Did he not leave your sight at all?” Zhao Long asked with a
frown.</p>
<p>“Of course. He has been playing chess with me,” Qin Bai said in
a hurried voice. “He did not leave my sight. I think someone might
have wanted to disguise himself as Han Sen to commit the act. You
should go and take a deeper look. Do not allow the real assassin to
remain lurking out there. Otherwise, Steel Scene will have died for
nothing.” He obviously wanted all those people to hurry up and
leave.</p>
<p>Zhao Long did not believe the words of the famous and spoiled
crown prince, but his identity was too noble. He had to bite his
tongue and just say, “Mister Crown Prince, thousands of guards and
their family members witnessed Han Sen murder people. If this was
really a setup, he has to come and help us with the investigation.
If it is a setup, we can prove his innocence.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai pointed at Zhao Long and the others while he shouted,
“Asshole! Are all you people in the king’s guard rubbish? Are you
all idiots? The king’s guard is in charge of the kingdom’s safety.
He was the general of the king’s guard, yet he was murdered at
home. You guys cannot even protect yourselves. Is there any point
in keeping the rest of you employed? The Qin Kingdom’s safety
depends on you trash people protecting us all. I am afraid if
someone invaded the palace and cut off my head and my father’s
head, you guys would have no clue what happened.” “My apologies.”
Zhao Long and the others kneeled to make their apology. The main
general of the king’s guard had been murdered. That was a
humiliation the king’s guard had never had to endure.</p>
<p>“Get lost!” Qin Bai madly shouted. “I told you I was with Han
Sen the entire time. He cannot be the murderer. Hurry up and find
the real murderer, you useless people!”</p>
<p>Zhao Long and the others looked worried. They knew they could
not take Han Sen away. Qin Bai’s identity was special. If he was
Han Sen’s alibi, it did not matter if it was true or false. This
boy could not be held up to scrutiny. Zhao Long and Liu Xian Xian
looked at each other. They bowed and made their exit from the Feng
family’s castle.</p>
<p>If this was another kingdom, it might have been entirely
suppressed. Since he was the only heir of the king and the future
king of the Qin Kingdom, there was 80% to 90% that this incident
was going to be suppressed.</p>
<p>The Qin Kingdom was different. Qin Bai’s identity was a noble
one, but the Qin Kingdom respected its laws. Even Crown Prince Qin
Bai was not able to do whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>It might have seemed like Zhao Long and the others left, but
they did not really leave. They kept some of the king’s guards
there to protect the castle. They surrounded the entire castle and
reported what happened. They waited for a response from their
supervisors.</p>
<p>Before they decided anything, they were not going to allow Han
Sen to leave their sights.</p>
<p>The news quickly spread across the kingdom. Many of the
government officials thought Qin Bai was a terrible and spoiled
crown prince. They believed he was going to be a bad king.</p>
<p>If this had happened in another kingdom, the situation would
have been different. No matter how many mistakes a royal made, it
was not something the officers could talk about. Insulting them was
not tolerated.</p>
<p>The Qin Kingdom was very unique. Although everyone knew the Qin
Kingdom’s laws were very twisted and unfair, Qin Kingdom’s officers
were the people who took the law seriously and dared to speak up.
Even if the king did something against the law, the government
officers yelled at him for being a bad king. The king and the older
officials would only listen and gnash their teeth. They still had
to compliment the bravery of the officers. Otherwise, it would have
gone against what everyone wanted. They did not want tyranny and
bad kings.</p>
<p>The Qin Kingdom’s officers were proud of that. Because the
current king was so forgiving and kind, this criticism of the
royals was very popular. The Qin Kingdom was obsessed with order,
and it was crazy about its law system. This twisted law system
created the Qin Kingdom but also restricted it.</p>
<p>Steel Scene being murdered was a hot topic. Qin Bai had angered
many officers. The officers who thought they were very righteous
even delivered suicide notes that stated if the king did not kill
Han Sen, they would kill themselves in court.Of course, it meant
what it meant, but it was not written down like quite that.</p>
