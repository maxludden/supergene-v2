<p>Night Wind’s face was tight and worried, and he had also brought
a video back with him.</p>
<p>When that video was played, Han Sen understood Night Wind’s
expression.</p>
<p>The beginning of the video showed a stone path, which must have
been the road that had been dug up.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know how they chose where to start digging, but
it clearly wasn’t a random decision. They had somehow figured out
exactly where to start digging.</p>
<p>The Hell had controlled large-scale dig sites. When Miss Mirror
and her people arrived, they quickly reduced the scale of the
operations. Now excavation was being conducted in three locations,
and the one in the middle had to have been where they began.</p>
<p>As the video went on, it revealed many complicated stone paths
that branched off until the stone road opened up to reveal a large
room. There, Han Sen found himself looking at the statue Miss
Mirror had mentioned.</p>
<p>It was ten meters tall. It wasn’t very big when compared to some
of the statues Han Sen had seen before, but it was pitch-black, and
it had the same texture as the rocks around it.</p>
<p>The statue featured a man sitting with his legs crossed. His
arms were crossed, as well, making an X shape. The eyes of the man
were just as Miss Mirror had described. There were two pupils in
each, and they were red.</p>
<p>Behind the statue were many arms and hands. They formed together
to create the large shape of a torch. Every hand also featured a
red eye with two pupils.</p>
<p>Looking at the statue was disconcerting. It was like there was
an endless tide of weird eyes were staring out of the screen. Han
Sen was only looking at them through the video, but even so, he got
goosebumps. A chill passed over Miss Mirror and Night Wind as
well.</p>
<p>The video didn’t hang around the statue for long. It moved
forward, revealing something that was even more surprising.</p>
<p>Beyond the statue, the stone path vanished into a cave. It was a
rough hole that looked like it had been dug by bare hand or
claws.</p>
<p>The walls of the stone tunnel were smeared here and there with
blood. Claws and talons were carved into the surface of the tunnel.
As the video progressed, more and more blood was revealed.</p>
<p>The blood slowly took over every surface, turning the black cave
red. The sight made Han Sen’s stomach crawl.</p>
<p>“That cave couldn’t have been dug by hand, right?” Han Sen
couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Although the Extreme King didn’t give much respect to the
workers, they only hired people who were at least Marquises. Those
people were considered strong within their own races. Their weapons
might not have been legendary treasures, but they should have been
decent. Even if they didn’t bring their own tools, the Extreme King
would have provided them with xenogeneic treasures. They wouldn’t
have had to use their hands to dig that tunnel.</p>
<p>But based on the marks and scratches left behind, the tunnel was
obviously the work of claws and hands. It hadn’t been dug out with
tools.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror and Night Wind looked at the video with perplexed
stares. They didn’t answer Han Sen’s question.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew it was true even without their confirmation,
though. He looked at the video for a bit longer, and he soon saw a
dead Marquise with the head of a cow. Instead of hands, there was
only a twisted mass of gore at the end of the man’s arms. Bits of
bone protruded through the scraped flesh.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, Han Sen couldn’t stop his imagination from
replaying what had happened. The cow-headed man had dug frantically
with his hands, injuring its fingers on the hard stone. And yet, it
didn’t stop. It kept on digging and digging with frenzied energy.
Eventually, the man’s hands had been ground to nubs. He had bled
out and died.</p>
<p>The video didn’t stop there, and the gristly sight replayed
itself over and over. Han Sen saw more and more dead bodies
scattered throughout the cave.</p>
<p>They were all in the same position. They leaned forward,
pressing their destroyed hands against the walls. Some had shredded
their palms, whereas others were missing entire arms.</p>
<p>Despite having died, they still maintained their digging
positions. Their faces looked very passionate as if they were
excited about what they were doing, but amidst that passion, there
was also the presence of fear. It was a terror that lay deep in
their bones.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t explain all the emotions he saw etched across
those dead faces, but his stomach clenched and a cold sweat beaded
across his back.</p>
<p>The eyes of the dead workers were all open, exposing their dual
red pupils.</p>
<p>The stone path was no longer really a path. It was like a long
grave dug out with blood. So many Dukes and Marquises had died up
and down that stone path. And the further the path went, the worse
the sights were.</p>
<p>At the end of the video was a stone door. Just as Night Wind
said, the double door looked like the entrance to a city. Both
sides of the door were crimson, like they’d been made of solidified
blood. There were also many semi-circular marks across the
door—scrapes left behind by fingernails.</p>
<p>The door was ten meters high, and because they had dug right up
to the surface of the door, only rock surrounded the doorframe. It
was impossible to see what was beyond those doors.</p>
<p>But what lay before the door gave Han Sen chills.</p>
<p>Many of the workers were stretched out before the door like
people trying to escape from the demons of hell. Their dead arms
were extended painfully in front of them, trying to reach some
non-existent salvation. Their nails were broken and their bones
were chipped. The blood on their hands had dyed the door, but none
of them had been able to open the door.</p>
<p>The workers had lasted so long, but they had all died before
this door. Blood pooled around the bodies before the evil door. The
door stood solid and unmoving, like the entrance to hell
itself.</p>
<p>Night Wind’s face looked terrible. “They are all dead. No one is
left alive, and they had all gone insane by the end. They just kept
digging and digging. Those rocks are hard, and they are incredibly
difficult to dig, even with tools. When they used their fingers to
dig, they began bleeding quite quickly. But when the blood touched
the stone, it was almost as if the stone softened. They could dig
it up, but it still hurt them. They kept digging until they bled
out.”</p>
<p>Night Wind’s voice trembled, even though he was a deified that
had witnessed many life and death scenarios. What he had seen would
give even him nightmares.</p>
<p>“This place is cursed.” Han Sen felt sick. He had the urge to
just grab Bao’er and flee.</p>
<p>Although they had the red bird with them, there was something
that was simply wrong about this place. Even Miss Mirror, who was a
strong deified, had been affected. There was every chance the red
bird might not escape whatever power was doing these horrible
things.</p>
<p>“Run! We must run! We cannot stay in this horrible place any
longer,” Han Sen decided. He was going to leave this place, no
matter what. He would leave, even if Miss Mirror sought to stop
him.</p>
<p>“Your eyes!” Miss Mirror suddenly whispered in dread, looking at
Han Sen’s eyes. Fear filled her face.</p>
<p>“What happened to my eyes?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He knew this
was bad.</p>
<p>With no hesitation, Han Sen waved his hand to cast a water
mirror so he could look at himself.</p>
<p>At that moment, Han Sen felt like fear had sunk deep into his
bones. His black eyes had turned red, and furthermore, a fissure
was running down the center of each pupil. The circular pupils
became gourd-shaped, and they were slowly splitting in half.</p>
