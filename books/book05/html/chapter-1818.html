<p>“Thank you, My Queen.” Han Sen’s eyes felt wet She had been
really helpful, and even given a precious gift to her enemy.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that if she found out he was Dollar, she’d be so
angry that she’d most likely stroke out and die.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen look so grateful, she misunderstood. Her attitude
softened, and she went on to say, “If you heed what I say and take
me for your proper teacher, you will become a Duke in three years.
With some luck, there is a chance you might one day become a
King.”</p>
<p>But as for Han Sen’s current condition, Queen didn’t say much.
And the only reason she said three years was due to the instability
of Han Sen’s body. Otherwise, it would not have taken that
long.</p>
<p>“Anyway, drink this geno fluid that once belonged to a Magnet
Fruit. And then, practice your geno arts. Focus on evolving for a
second time first. It does not matter whether you become a Noble or
a xenogeneic; I will take care of you. You will not become a
mindless monster.”</p>
<p>Yisha sounded confident</p>
<p>“Yes, My Queen.” Han Sen did not say anything more. He just
opened the bottle and drank its contents.</p>
<p>He was familiar with the smell, and he had many Magnet Fruits at
home. He was planning to eat one and see if he could evolve. He
didn’t expect Yisha would go to such lengths and provide him with
the juice. So, he spared no time in necking it down.</p>
<p>When Yisha saw Han Sen do it so quickly, she smiled even
more.</p>
<p>Han Sen chugged the geno fluid that contained Magnet Fruit, and
then, he felt a weird power soar into his limbs, rejuvenating his
cells. Han Sen cast The Story of Genes, and then his Spell armor
appeared. The geno fluid had become a raw power that was absorbed
by the armor.</p>
<p>Yisha sat where she was and waited for the result of Han Sen’s
evolution. If Han Sen became a xenogeneic, and his will was lost to
the lust for killing, she could recover his will and sense.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen’s energy started to roll downhill. But
still, she hadn’t seen Han Sen evolve a second time.</p>
<p>“How can that happen? Did I bring him the wrong ingredient?
Maybe that wasn’t the geno fluid.” Yisha frowned and sniffed the
bottle, and then she went on to think, “This is the Magnet Fruit!
Why did he not evolve a second time?”</p>
<p>Yisha saw Han Sen’s energy had weakened and become normal
again.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed about it, too. This was his second time
trying to evolve using The Story of Genes, and he had failed this
time, as well.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, My Queen. I have failed.” Han Sen opened his eyes
and looked at her apologetically.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You failed only once.” Yisha called for a guard to
bring her another bottle. Then, she continued by saying, “Try
again. After the first failure, this is sure to succeed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Queen. I will succeed.” Han Sen accepted the second
bottle and spared no time in drinking it all.</p>
<p>Yisha looked fairly unconcerned, but on the inside, it was a
different story. She felt awful. Magnet Fruit was not something you
could buy at a streetside market. They were very expensive, and
they were items coveted by many.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just commoners, either. Even many of the high
races, who were unlucky enough to have babies that weren’t born
Nobles, wanted it.</p>
<p>So, treasures like Magnet Fruit could be very expensive to
obtain. And there were times when they were completely unavailable
for purchase. Even someone like Yisha did not have many to her
name, and she would have much preferred to save them.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, one bottle of such geno fluid was all that would be
needed for success. Failure was abnormally rare.</p>
<p>Han Sen downed the second one, and that weird power manifested
once more. The power surge was stronger than what he experienced
the last time.</p>
<p>“Such powerful energy! This is far greater than a Baron. He must
certainly succeed this time.” Yisha started to feel relieved. After
a while, Han Sen’s geno armor showed no sign of responding. It
didn’t look as if it was going to melt at all.</p>
<p>After a while. Han Sen’s energy started to dip. And that meant
another failure.</p>
<p>“My Queen, I am so sorry.” Han Sen felt embarrassed. He didn’t
know why his Spell armor kept on failing.</p>
<p>Yisha’s eyes were twitching. And as she looked at Han Sen, she
asked, “What geno arts have you practiced? Let me see.”</p>
<p>The fact that he had drunk two geno fluids without success led
Yisha to believe there was a serious problem with him.</p>
<p>Han Sen made no effort to hide anything, and he just told her,
“I did not write my geno arts down, but I can show it to you.”</p>
<p>Yisha nodded, and Han Sen read it out slowly. He himself
believed there was a problem somewhere, as failure was not
something he often experienced. Han Sen could not tell what the
problem was, though. Yisha, being a semi-deified being, might be
the one to help him through the slump.</p>
<p>Han Sen only read out a little when Yisha’s face looked glum.
She asked coldly, “Who taught you this?”</p>
<p>“No one. I bought it out in the markets. It seemed fairly
powerful, so I decided to study it” Han Sen was shocked by the
sudden question. She looked as if she knew something about it.</p>
<p>In disbelief, Yisha said, “You just practiced this random skill
on a whim? And you created a geno armor with it? I am not sure if
you are lucky or unlucky, truth be told.”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem with this geno art?” Han Sen was
shocked.</p>
<p>Yisha said slowly, “It isn’t just a problem. But don’t you think
this skill requires… well, too much… skill? If you had a body like
this, you’d already be a god. You wouldn’t have to practice.
Whoever wrote this was conducting a prank with the intent of
harming others. And mistakenly, you generated your geno armor with
it. It is impossible to evolve a second time.”</p>
<p>What do I do, then?” Han Sen wondered if this really was a
problem associated with The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>When he studied The Story of Genes, he had acknowledged the
problem. He already knew the requirements were absurdly high and
demanding. No one could even start off with the basic requirements,
and he had to use the black crystal armor to help him get his foot
in the door with its practice.</p>
