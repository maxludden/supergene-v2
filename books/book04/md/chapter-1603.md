  Han Sen rushed forward like an arrow, and he was incredibly fast. In the blink of an eye, he was already far from Lin Feng and the others.

It felt like Han Sen’s leg didn’t belong to him. His leg was rushing crazily forward, pulling the rest of his body along behind. No matter how hard Han Sen tried to control himself, he wasn’t able to stop it He wasn’t even able to change his direction or speed.

It seemed that the crystal heel had a mind of its own, and it was dashing forward across the sand.

“D*mn it!” It looks like Han Sen is being controlled by the shoe. When Lin Feng realized what was happening, he immediately started to chase Han Sen.

Little Star and the others also ran forward. However, Han Sen was running too fast, so Lin Feng and the others couldn’t catch up with him, and only Little Star was managing to follow him.

Little Star turned its body and ran back to Dragon Chef and the others. It let everyone step onto its back, and then it accelerated toward Han Sen again.

“What’s happening to you, Han Sen?” Lin Feng yelled. He wanted to see if Han Sen still had his own consciousness.

“I can’t control my leg anymore. It’s the crystal shoe doing”, said Han Sen.

Lin Feng felt relieved after hearing Han Sen’s answer. It was good that he still had his consciousness; otherwise, it would be much more trouble.

“D*mn it!” Jing Jiwu suddenly screamed, and his face suddenly paled.

“What’s happening? Do you know where that crystal shoe came from?” asked Xu Mi.

“I don’t know where that crystal shoe came from, but if he keeps running forward, he’ll enter the Flowing Sand Dune”, Jing Jiwu said, pointing in front of them.

Lin Feng was terrified after hearing that name. “We have to stop Han Sen right now. We can’t let him run into Flowing Sand Dune!”

“What’s in Flowing Sand Dune?” asked Xu Mi. He knew that normal flowing sand wouldn’t harm Han Sen at all. There must be someone or something in Flowing Sand Dune that had terrified Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu.

The Black Horn Dragon, one of the most terrifying beings in Wind Song Desert. Any creature that enters the Flowing Sand Dune without its permission will be killed, and there are no exceptions. We suspect that it’s a berserk super creature.

“Then what are you waiting for? Please stop me now.” Han Sen was very anxious. He wasn’t invincible yet, so it was too early for him to fight a berserk super creature. However, he didn’t have any way to control his leg.

“I have an idea”, Xu Mi said. He took his sword out and slashed forward.

A trace of sword light flashed above Han Sen’s head, then slashed a gully into the desert in front of him. Because of Xu Mi’s power, the end of the gully turned into a vertical sandstone wall.

Han Sen immediately understood what Xu Mi was trying to do. He opened his mouth to say something, and then he screamed as he ran face-first into the sandstone wall.

Peng!

After only a short while, Han Sen emerged from the sandstone, still running. His face was kind of injured, and there was sand all over his body.

“You idiot! Do you even have a brain? I almost got killed!”

Xu Mi looked apologetic. “I’m sorry, teacher. I thought that I could stop you.”

If you’ve never tried something before, don’t practice it on me. Han Sen was very bummed.

Lin Feng thought about it and said, “I can’t think of any way to stop you, but I can use my power to hit your body and change your direction. That way, you can at least get around Flowing Sand Dune.”

“Okay, okay. Just do it now. Quick!” yelled Han Sen.

“Prepare yourself. I’m going to hit your left shoulder from behind to turn you right. The right part of the desert is safer, and there aren’t many powerful creatures.” Golden light started to gleam around Lin Feng’s body. He punched Han Sen, using his power very ingeniously. He hit Han Sen’s left shoulder, and Han Sen’s body turned right a little bit.

“I’ve succeeded!” Everyone was relieved for a second.

However, Han Sen spun one hundred and eighty degrees. He originally had his back to Lin Feng and the others, and now he was facing them. Han Sen started to rush backwards, but he was still rushing in the direction of Flowing Sand Dune. He hadn’t slowed down at all; instead, he was getting faster and faster.

“You didn’t control your power well, Lin Feng. You turned me too much”, said Han Sen, upset.

Lin Feng looked solemn. “It’s not that I used too much power; it’s that this method is not working. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have turned all the way around.”

“Let’s try again”, Han Sen said, clenching his teeth.

Lin Feng hit Han Sen again, but after Han Sen turned around again, he was still rushing toward Flowing Sand Dune.

Lin Feng and the others tried lots of methods, yet no matter what they tried, they couldn’t stop Han Sen. They couldn’t even divert him. It seemed that there was a giant magnet drawing Han Sen forward in a single direction.

As time went by, Han Sen ran faster and faster. As he drew close to Flowing Sand Dune, he was already far ahead of Little Star and the others.

It might be better this way. When the force in the lake tried to pull me down, I got rid of it using super king spirit mode. I should be able to do the same thing here. Han Sen quickly became a super king spirit

A white light filled Han Sen’s dark eyes, and his black hair became white as well, growing longer and longer. It fluttered in the wind and sand as Han Sen ran. But after Han Sen entered super king spirit mode, the power propelling him forward didn’t vanish. This time around, super king spirit mode didn’t work.

Han Sen was shocked and furious. It worked before!

“D*mn it!” The butterfly wings on his back were trembling, and his bloodthirsty ant king was also running at full power. He tried everything in his power to stop his body from moving forward.

However, nothing worked. Han Sen was still running faster and faster, and after a short while, Han Sen plunged into Flowing Sand Dune.

“D*mn it!” Considering how fast he was running, Han Sen should be in Flowing Sand Dune by now. Lin Feng was very worried. They were still chasing after him, but they couldn’t even see him now.

“Please, bless him! Perhaps the Black Horn Dragon has some business to do away from home”, said Jing Jiwu. They couldn’t chase Han Sen, and even if they caught up with him, they couldn’t stop him from moving forward. They could only pray to God for help.
