<p>“Failure?” Han Sen looked at his scabbard.</p>

<p>For once, Yisha didn’t hold back on her explanation. “Didn’t I tell you that the crystallizers invented a geno weapon that was of a deified caliber? Their technology rarely succeeded on their first try, and they’d go through many failures and testing phases. This scabbard is one of those failures. After the crystallizers were destroyed, an elite claimed it and brought it to Demon Grave. He left it here after that fight”</p>

<p>“The elite you mention cannot be the Rebate elder, could it?” Han Sen asked Yisha.</p>

<p>Yisha nodded and said, “Yeah, it was our elder. Our elder always used that scabbard, and he never left it behind.”</p>

<p>Yisha looked at Han Sen and said, “I have told you what you wished to know. I hope you will uphold your end of the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry! Humans are a reliable race.” Han Sen blinked, and then asked, “You want to take this xenogeneic creation tool? It is fairly big, and I’m not sure it’s something you can walk away with.”</p>

<p>“The dimensions of this place have been twisted too much. If it wasn’t for those monsters bringing us here, we wouldn’t have been able to find it But you’re right, we cannot take it away, either. All I want is the xenogeneic gene fluid inside here.</p>

<p>If you want, I can give you some. I wouldn’t be able to take it all, anyway.” Yisha was treating Han Sen like an equal.</p>

<p>Yisha hadn’t initially expected him to possess a swordmind and talent like what he had showcased. The power was exceptional, considering that he was only a Baron.</p>

<p>As Yisha said, when the zapping lights reached a certain volume, the pressure leveled out and stopped increasing. Han Sen had enough of a fitness level to push through it and avoid getting trapped there.</p>

<p>In fact, the monsters had selected those five purely in the belief that they could be modified. It would not be a surprise to the monsters that they were able to get through the tunnel of light.</p>

<p>But Han Sen did not think Yisha only wanted this geno fluid. He believed she was after something else as well.</p>

<p>“Inside the xenogeneic creation tool, what else could she possibly get?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke and the other two were gone. Han Sen and Yisha walked for an hour, and eventually, they left the tunnel and found themselves in a circular space.</p>

<p>That place was half-filled with a milk-like liquid. It was bubbling, but Han Sen did not feel any heat coming off of it.</p>

<p>“There isn’t an exit?” Han Sen looked around, and he could not see any way out.</p>

<p>“The exit is down there. We need to go through this liquid to proceed. This is a part of the creation tool,” Yisha said, right before jumping into the milk-like liquid and disappearing.</p>

<p>Han Sen went quiet and jumped down after her. When his body touched the liquid, it felt like his armor was descending into a sponge. It was like his whole body was inside a hot spring.</p>

<p>His geno armament and body, and all of his cells, were conning alive.</p>

<p>As this happened, Han Sen felt some movement. When he touched it, he noticed it was the soft ball the little monster had given him.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew that the monster had meant for no harm to fall upon him. The monster had treated him specially, and that was probably because Han Sen possessed crystallizer blood to some degree. Those monsters were created to guard the xenogeneic creation tool, and they were probably designed to gravitate toward crystallizers.</p>

<p>The soft ball was similar to Han Sen’s body, and it was absorbing some of the substance. It did so faster than Han Sen, however.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. “This liquid can be absorbed! Maybe I can absorb more.”</p>

<p>Han Sen’s body kept sinking. He ran his Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra, but they did not work. They could not absorb the juice, not like the soft orb was able to.</p>

<p><em>Splash!</em></p>

<p>Han Sen felt empty, and he fell from the liquid.</p>

<p>Han Sen took a deep breath and allowed himself to float like a leaf. Han Sen looked around and noticed he was on a semicircular platform. Yisha, Vic, Rocks Fall Duke, and Hawk Wing were there.</p>

<p>“Good movement,” Vic commented, as he watched Han Sen descend like a leaf.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked around and noticed he was in a massive place now. The semi-circular platform connected to a bridge. There was a large, crysta卜looking sphere across the bridge. It was glowing.</p>

<p>Beneath the bridge, you could see a lake of milk.</p>

<p>For some reason, there were geysers firing the liquid. They would blow up pillars of the stuff, spraying it everywhere. Some pillars of the juice came close to the bridge, spraying the walkway before descending.</p>

<p>“Everyone is here, so let’s get on with the plan,” Vic said.</p>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke grunted, and he said, “Mister Vic, do you think we are stupid? You want us to stay in front, to be the first in danger. Why do we even need you? You guys agree, right?”</p>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke stepped toward Han Sen and Yisha. He had no faith in Vic, so he wanted Han Sen to lead them now, instead of Vic.</p>

<p>“Rocks Fall Duke, it looks like you’re the first to cross the bridge.” Vic looked at him, with his hand clutching a dagger. He slowly approached the Rebate.</p>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke’s face changed, and he yelled at Han Sen, Hawk Wing, and Yisha. “If we fight him, he cannot beat our combined might. If we don’t do anything, we will be little more than bait he can throw about. None of us will make it out of here alive!”</p>

<p>“Who wants to see if my dagger is sharp?” Vic laughed coldly as he drew close to Rocks Fall Duke.</p>

<p>Hawk Wing looked hesitant Han Sen and Yisha didn’t look like they wanted to help, either.</p>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke was afraid of Vic’s dagger, and the Sky-Demon powers he could wield. He went ahead to say many things that might convince the others to align with him, but he was still forced onto the bridge by Vic.</p>

<p>When he was on the bridge, Rocks Fall Duke simply gritted his teeth and ran forward.</p>

<p>As he ran, a pillar of liquid rose toward him. The milk exploded in the air, turning into white rain.</p>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke was lashed with the stuff, but it was like he was a sponge. The liquid was absorbed by his body.</p>

<p>Rocks Fall Duke leaned back and roared. He fell down into a crouch on the bridge, as his muscles began to expand. His armor ruptured and broke.</p>
