“My poor Bao’er. She does not even get to see her birth mother.” Han Sen sighed. He remained waiting in hiding, watching what was going on outside the hole.

Han Sen did not know what items the God Chaos Party Leader had left behind. He did not know what any of them were for. Judging from the faces of Bury Path God and Ancient Devil, he knew they had to be something special.

Aside from the free items they took away, there were at least a hundred items left to take in the hidden hall. For as long as just a few of them were worth something, they were enough to attract people to commit crimes for them.

When a sword was drawn and a bowstring pulled, Ancient Devil looked outside the hall.

“Ancient Devil, where are you going?” big sky demon asked.

Ancient Devil said, “Mister Leader gave me what I deserved. She did not say she would give anything else to me, so they are not mine to take.” He ignored their reaction. He left the hall and did not touch anything more.

Bury Path God and big sky demon looked as if they were deep in thought. They did not know if Ancient Devil wanted to leave now and wait until they were injured before swooping in to mop up the goodies or what. They weren’t sure if he had learned something the others hadn’t either. They couldn’t be sure if he knew they weren’t supposed to touch the items there or what.

Big sky demon looked at the items in the hall. She suddenly laughed and said, “Ancient Devil is right. Mister Leader is like my mother. She gave me all she could. If she did not give the items to me, I should not take them. You can keep the items if you want to.”

After that, big sky demon turned around and left the hall. Now, only Bury Path God remained in the hall.

The situation seemed to be much improved, but Han Sen was still secretly complimenting them. He thought Ancient Devil and big sky demon were people who were tough to deal with.

They were afraid the God Chaos Leader had done something to the other items, so they did not dare take them. That was why they decided to leave. They deliberately left those things behind for Bury Path God, so he could test their safety before them.

Even if Bury Path God took the items and nothing more happened, he would not be able to use all of the items anyway.

Bury Path God seemed to know what Ancient Devil and big sky demon were thinking, so he coldly grunted. “You guys might be scared, but I am not scared. Whatever I get, no other can take.”

Without hesitating, Bury Path God took the legacy items. He spoke proudly, but he was still being extremely careful. He pulled out a sword and carefully poked a wine barrel. He was really soft and gentle.

The wine cask was picked up slowly. It came before Bury Path God. Nothing else really happened. Bury Path God felt grand relief.

Bury Path God then picked up the rest of the items. His sleeves were like bottomless chasms in which anything could fit, all without a modicum of trouble.

Bury Path God was being extremely careful when picking up all these items. It had been half an hour by now. It was around then that he finished collecting all the items and stuffing them into his sleeves.

“Mister, putting the items in there is pointless. Why don’t you let me use them all, so I can work harder for Little Master?” Bury Path God bowed to the jade statue. He then took all of the items and left the hall with them.

When Bury Path God left the hall, the copper door closed. Han Sen wondered if he should leave, but he gave up on that idea. He planned to leave via the rat hole.

Before the door closed shut, Han Sen heard Bury Path God coldly shout, “Big sky demon, I knew you would do this!” Immediately after, there was some scary striking sound.

Han Sen shook his head. If this was in the past, he would have liked to take the treasure too. Now, he had the gene seed. There was no point in needlessly exposing himself.

God Chaos Party Leader said that item mattered to Bao’er’s life. Without a gene seed, Bao’er might not survive. Han Sen only wanted to bring the gene seed back to Bao’er safely and hoped nothing went wrong.

Pang!

The copper door completely closed. Han Sen was readying himself to leave when he suddenly saw the jade statue possess a mysterious halo. The jade statue, which had closed its eyes, suddenly opened them again.

“Since you are here, why do you not come and meet me?” the jade statue asked with a smile. Its eyes that looked like crystals were peering at the rat hole.

Han Sen was shocked. “This one is strong! It is just a remnant of her soul, yet she made big sky demon and the other two be all messed up. She had them believe the soul remnant was gone, but it is actually still here. It is just a remnant of a soul, yet she was able to find me. She is much better than big sky demon and the other two people.”

“Cough! Ancient Devil was here. I did not want to reveal myself and disturb the others.” Han Sen coughed and walked out of the rat hole. He bowed before the jade statue.

The jade statue looked at Han Sen with interest. A while later, she said, “You are good.”

“What?” Han Sen was shocked. The jade statue’s words did not really make sense. He did not know how to respond to her.

“You are the one that raised my daughter, Han Sen. You are Mister Han, yes?” The jade statue did not respond to Han Sen. She merely smiled at him.

“I am Han Sen, but I am not really a mister.” Before the greatest person in the universe, Han Sen did not want to sound cocky.

“You did a good deed for my daughter, so, of course, you are considered a mister. I should be thanking you a great deal.” After pausing a moment, the jade statue said, “If you have a wish to make, you can tell it to me, and I can fulfill it.”

Before Han Sen could speak, the jade statue blinked. “But I am just a soul. If it is something too hard, I may not be able to satisfy you.”

Han Sen’s head developed a lot of black lines. He did not think this God Chaos Party Leader was this sort of person.

“I treat Bao’er like a real daughter,” Han Sen said. “I do not need a wish, but there are a few problems I want to quiz you about.”

“You may speak,” the jade statue nodded.

“Why do you say Bao’er won’t live without a gene seed? And why must that person fight Bao’er?” Han Sen asked her the questions he cared about the most.

In fact, Han Sen really hated this. The so-called destiny was just an elder’s wish forced down on their inheritors. As Bao’er’s mother, the God Chaos Party should not have shouldered Bao’er with so much.

The jade statue looked at Han Sen with surprise and sighed. “Bao’er was raised by you. It is her pleasure. It was my luck too.”

After pausing, the jade statue sighed and said, “I do not want Bao’er to fight him. If he knows Bao’er is my daughter, he will look for a way to kill her. As a mother, I want my child to live a happy life. Why would I want her to fight other people?”
