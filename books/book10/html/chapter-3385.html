<p>When Han Sen heard him, his eyes went bright. He asked, “What is
the difference with you now after your Super God Spirit body
finished evolving.”</p>
<p>“My Super God Spirit body became an ultimate Super God Spirit
body. It is just stronger,” Ning Yue casually said.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a complex look almost immediately after hearing
that. Ning Yue’s Super God Spirit body had evolved to an ultimate
version of the Super God Spirit body compared to Han Sen, whose
Super God Spirit body was reduced to nothing. It was
frustrating.</p>
<p>“The Super God Spirit body is dependent on one’s karma,” Han Sen
depressingly stated.</p>
<p>Ning Yue looked at Han Sen, who was standing still, and asked,
“Are you going or are you not going?”</p>
<p>“I am going.” Han Sen’s mind returned to the present. He then
followed Ning Yue. They broke space and raced to the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Because the 33 skies only had two empty layers of sky left, the
skies that already had a leader were difficult to breach. Usually,
they would have teleported to the skies that did not have an
owner.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Ning Yue did not get close to the barrier of the 33
skies. There were lots of Break World beasts on the search for Han
Sen. They immediately roared and came for him.</p>
<p>“Let me take care of this,” Ning Yue coldly said. He plucked a
feather from his feathery clothing. He waved it at the Break World
beasts.</p>
<p>A beautiful, green halo was emitted. The bodies of the Break
World beasts that touched the green halo became a green light that
dissolved.</p>
<p>Within the blink of an eye, a dozen Break World beasts were
turned into nothingness.</p>
<p>The last Break World gene was floating in the air.</p>
<p>The scene seemed frozen. The Break World beasts behind them were
in shock. They all retreated. None of them dared to go for Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Ning Yue went to 33 skies, which looked like a big
tombstone. The Break World beasts surrounding the 33 skies formed a
path for them.</p>
<p>“Very good.” Han Sen’s gave a thumbs up. Ning Yue’s power was so
scary, his Super God Spirit body was wildly different.</p>
<p>Han Sen started wondering what the ultimate Super God Spirit
body of Qin Xuan and the others might be like. He couldn’t
comprehend how scary their combined powers would be. The God Chaos
Party and all other parties would be immediately destroyed.</p>
<p>Ning Yue used his feathers to swing. The barriers of the 33
skies were cut open. He walked in and disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to follow Ning Yue to enter, but the gap in the
barrier was gone the moment Ning Yue entered.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt bad about this. He used his own body to go to the
invisible wall, but his body could not use any power because he did
not currently have an enemy. Han Sen did not have any power, so he
did not know if he could break through the invisible wall.</p>
<p>When Han Sen hit the invisible wall, it was like he hit nothing.
He just went straight through. It was like no bai sema existed in
the first place.</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body fell. When Han Sen landed, the impact of his fall
created a massive circular crater in the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen checked out the crater. He discovered that the place he
was in now was incredibly weird. In the sky, there were lots of
giant rocky objects that were like a watch.</p>
<p>The watches were the sizes of stones. There were some big ones,
and there were others that were small. The small ones were about
the size of a baseball field. Some of the bigger ones were about
the size of a planet. Hands were depicting the hours and
minutes.</p>
<p>Obviously, they were not real watches. They did not move as a
clock did. The hands were stiff in their places and did not
move.</p>
<p>Han Sen had landed on a stone watch that was kind of like an
island.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew he had entered the 29th sky. There were only two
skies left with no owners. The 29th sky was called Time Sky. From
what he was seeing, he knew he was correct about his current
location.</p>
<p>Although he knew Time Sky’s name, Han Sen did not know why there
was still no leader. According to theory, many people should have
been able to enter the 29th sky, yet no leader had yet to
emerge.</p>
<p>Han Sen came out from the hole. He walked to the edge of the
watch and looked around. He did not notice Ning Yue around him. He
did not even know if he too had been deposited in Time Sky.</p>
<p>“Han Sen.” While Han Sen was looking around, he heard someone
call his name. That voice was very familiar.</p>
<p>He looked in the direction where the voice had come from. Above
him, he saw a stone watch that was the size of a football stadium.
A man was standing on the edge of that watch. He was looking at him
from above.</p>
<p>“Ancient Devil, what are you doing here? Did you not already
take a sky for yourself and become its leader?” Han Sen had a
shocked expression as he looked at Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did not speak. He jumped down and landed close to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but Ancient Devil performed a
gesture to stop Han Sen and said, “There is no time. The next time
wheel is going to start. You need to listen up. The time around
here can affect the speed time goes by. When the time wheel starts
to spin, time will go fast-forward differently. It might even
reverse. You will be affected if you are in a certain time
area.”</p>
<p>Han Sen immediately sensed how serious this was. He frowned and
asked, “How fast does the time go by?”</p>
<p>“When it slows, it can be slow,” Ancient Devil said. “When it is
fast, it can be very fast. One moment could take one thousand
years. For a human and their lifespan, you might die on a watch in
one second. Either that, or you will devolve and become a
sperm.”</p>
<p>“Is there any way not to be affected by this?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“There is no way. Every time the time wheel starts to spin, the
speeds are different from the last time. It all depends on your
luck. Hopefully, you will go to a time area where time is slowed
down.” Ancient Devil paused and said, “Or, you can find a sky watch
in Time Sky. If you manage to control it, you will become the
leader of Time Sky.”</p>
<p>“How do I find that?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“If people knew where to find it, many Break World creatures
would not be trapped here.” Ancient Devil pointed to somewhere far
away. There was a big dragon that looked like a diamond carving. It
was traveling through the rock watches.</p>
<p>“That is one of Qin Xiu’s Break World beasts,” Ancient Devil
quietly said. “Its Break World rate is at least 95%. The last time
the time wheel spun, it was hurt by time. It lost the scales on its
body, and its Break World rate went down to 60%.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not understand and asked, “Why did God Hall Leader
not send Moment God, a time God Spirit, here?”</p>
<p>This was a time area sky. Whether it was Moment God or God Chaos
Party’s Itchy, either of them should have been able to control such
a place with ease.</p>
