<p>Old Cat’s body was excreting a lifeforce. It was like it was
being pulled away with a magnet. It was going toward Han Sen’s
body. Quickly, it went into the reverse Blood-Pulse Sutra. It
became a part of the Xuan Yellow Sutra. It made Han Sen’s body more
powerful.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this?” Han Sen looked at the lifeforce, which
was almost completely out of the animal. He noticed Old Cat’s body
was looking to be in very poor shape. His face started to look
weird.</p>
<p>Old Cat’s face was incredibly calm. He said, “I died because of
the holy spirit tests. Qin Xiu used his gene blood to revive me.
Through that, I became his puppet. All these years, I have been
fighting the blue blood, but I have never been able to shed control
of the blue blood. Although I discovered the reverse blue blood
skill, I was still never able to completely control it. Then, I
understood I had died a long time ago. My soul was broken. Qin Xiu
was fixing my soul. He put his soul in me. No matter what, I was
never able to escape his control.”</p>
<p>“But I invented a blue blood reversal skill. It can restrict his
blue blood. I was going to give it to Ling’er because only Ling’er
could have the perfect body required. That way, she could beat Qin
Xiu.” After saying all this, Old Cat started to look strange. “To
be honest, you and Human King are the same. You captured my
attention a long time ago. In the end, I did not choose you because
I did not think you guys were perfect enough. You all had flaws and
could not be the one who could defeat Qin Xiu.”</p>
<p>The fire in Old Cat’s blood was going dim. His lifeforce was
going to be gone very soon.</p>
<p>Old Cat’s face looked very dim. “I am so sorry, Littleflower. He
treated me like family, but I pushed him to hell. Dying will not be
enough to redeem my sins, but I will still give my life to you. Use
my life. Beat Qin Xiu and save Littleflower. I know it will be
difficult, but I have faith you will be able to do this.”</p>
<p>After that, Old Cat raised his hand and looked at Qin Xiu and
Littleflower. His expression looked complicated. He looked guilty,
and he looked as if he was longing for something. He also looked
determined.</p>
<p>“Littleflower will believe you have what it takes too,” Old Cat
said. The blood light started to shine. It was like the last effort
of a waning sun. The blood flames from his body all went into Han
Sen.</p>
<p>The blood fire was like it was rewinding. It went dim after
becoming so bright. It turned to ash. When the wind blew, it was
gone.</p>
<p>Han Sen was conflicted. He did not know what he was feeling. He
hated Old Cat, who had fractured his family and made Littleflower
become Qin Xiu’s new host.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen could not really harbor any more animosity toward
him. Although Old Cat did not say it, Han Sen knew what he
meant.</p>
<p>Old Cat was going to wait until Ling’er grew up and allow
Ling’er to get his blood for beating the imperfect Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>If they waited, Littleflower would have had no chance of being
saved. Thus, Old Cat gave up his own life. He ultimately selected
Han Sen, the one he did not have much hope in.</p>
<p>It was not because Han Sen’s power touched him. It was because
Old Cat did not want to see Littleflower be defeated. He changed
his plans. He used his life. He used his hope. He used his hatred
and love for Han Sen, the one he did not want to pick.</p>
<p>“Even without your life, I can still save Littleflower. Why
don’t you just rest in peace?” Han Sen looked at the sky. The
Nine-Life Cat light was glowing on his back. His body had red blood
boiling and roaring. An incredible power gathered inside him.</p>
<p>The Nine-Life Cat tattoo was lively. The light broke away and
became dots of light that entered Han Sen’s body. The blood tattoo
dimmed. It melted into the stream of the Xuan Yellow Sutra.</p>
<p>The god palaces were falling. Many god temples were breaking.
The whole universe was in chaos. All the races were suffering a
disaster. No one in the universe could find a clear patch of
soil.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The god temples that had yet to fall away from the god palaces
were glowing. It looked like an erupting volcano. It was like God
Spirits were coming out from the god temples. At this time, God
said, “All the God Spirits should maintain their position. They
cannot leave. The god palaces can break, but the base of the
universe cannot.”</p>
<p>“I am willing to live and die with you!” Among the many crying
sounds, a godly voice called out from various god temples. It
shocked the sky, which was full of everything falling apart. God
smiled, but then his body suddenly turned soft. The shadow of a
man’s holy body appeared. He was holding a passed out Wan’er.</p>
<p>“The responsibility is in front of me. Other things do not
matter.” While God was talking, his holy light glowed. His light
shone on the entirety of the god palaces, which were cracking. All
of the god temples were separated from the geno hall. They were
scattering into the universe. The god palaces only had the geno
hall left.</p>
<p>“In the past, my boy was out there, and you could defeat me,”
Qin Xiu said with a sigh. “Now, my body is in here, so you cannot
do a thing. You are very sad. Are these the rules you seek to
protect?”</p>
<p>God laughed. He pushed his hand. Wan’er was wrapped up by holy
light. She flew away from the geno hall, heading toward Sky
Palace.</p>
<p>After all this, God looked at Qin Xiu and said, “Not bad. This
is the rule I will keep. I will keep protecting it.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I must break your rules.” Qin Xiu looked serious. He
stood in front of God. The two of them were three feet away from
each other. They stared at each other. A scary power kept colliding
between them.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The whole of the geno hall shook like mad. It moved the spot
they were at, which started to fall.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whole universe’s base had space cracks and
turbulence. Disasters were happening everywhere like it was the end
of the world.</p>
<p>“The geno hall is going to fall,” Human King said with
excitement.</p>
<p>Most creatures around the universe were crying. Many creatures
were affected by on-going disasters. They wanted to survive amidst
the carnage, but most were consumed by it.</p>
<p>Mountains were breaking. Rivers were flooding. The sun and the
moon were reversed. It was like the world was going to break.</p>
<p>“Damn it… The geno hall has such a profound connection with the
universe. We cannot allow him to break the geno hall!” Sky Palace
Leader broke space. He wanted to go to the geno hall, but he had
just gone before when he tried throwing a punch at Qin Xiu. The
geno hall glowed with a god light. A strange power blasted Sky
Palace Leader away.</p>
<p>The geno hall’s power was protecting it from someone who wanted
to see it destroyed.</p>
<p>Many elites had the same idea as Sky Palace Leader, but they
were stopped. Their entry to the geno hall was forbidden. No one
was able to go in. They were stopped by the geno hall’s power.
Their attacks affected the geno hall, which made it fall
faster.</p>
<p>When all of those scary elites were at a loss with what to do, a
flame that looked like blood burst out. It was not repelled by the
geno hall’s bai sema. It went straight into the geno hall’s
proximity. It landed on the geno hall plaza.</p>
