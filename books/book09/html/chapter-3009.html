<p>“Don’t be so worried,” Ancient Origin God coldly said. “I just
wanted a drop of his blood. It is not like I was going to put him
inside the baby god wok to cook. Why are you being so nervous?”</p>
<p>Han Sen and Dragon Lady felt relieved, but Han Sen was still
curious. He looked at Ancient Origin God and asked, “Why do you my
blood?”</p>
<p>“If you take the ancient spirit seed, we will require a
replacement,” Ancient Origin God said. “Your blood can be that
replacement.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and did not say anything in response. The entire
universe knew Human King had poured blue blood all over him. The
blood in his body was blue. Now, Ancient Origin God wanted a drop
of his blood. He did not think it was as simple as Ancient Origin
God was making it out to be.</p>
<p>One drop of blood was not a major loss for Han Sen either. To be
able to get the ancient spirit seed in return for a drop of blood
was an acceptable exchange.</p>
<p>“OK, I will make the trade,” Han Sen said as he looked at
Ancient Origin God. “But there is something I would like you to
help me with.”</p>
<p>“I know what you are going to ask about,” Ancient Origin God
said. “Give the ancient spirit seed to Dragon Lady, then you may
follow me.” After speaking, he walked out of the garden.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave the ancient spirit seed to Dragon Lady and said,
“Wait here.”</p>
<p>“I am coming with you,” Dragon Lady said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Do not worry,” Han Sen said with a laugh. “Moment God was
unable to do anything to me, so he cannot do anything.”</p>
<p>Dragon Lady looked at Ancient Origin God as he departed and said
to Han Sen, “He is the king of the Ancient Gods. He is not any
weaker than Moment God, so do not be reckless.”</p>
<p>Han Sen replied, “I understand. Just wait for me here.” He
passed the ancient spirit seed into Dragon Lady’s arms. The ancient
spirit seed was nice and grabbed Dragon Lady’s neck.</p>
<p>After he left the underground garden, Han Sen saw Ancient Origin
God ahead. He quickly caught up with him.</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God kept walking and said, “We Ancient Gods were
once the leaders of this world. We ate the livers of dragons and
dined on the guts of phoenixes. Everything was our food until
Sacred Leader and Sacred appeared. Our people suppressed the sky.
We were invincible.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know why Ancient Origin God was suddenly talking
about all of that. He had heard about it before since the Ancient
Gods had a bright history. But that was a long ago and few recalled
their past glories.</p>
<p>It was not just the Ancient God’s era either. Even the Sacred
era was only remembered by a few old antiques. Most creatures of
the universe did not even know the word “Sacred.” All they knew
about were the Very High, Ancient Gods, and Extreme King.</p>
<p>Ancient Gods were not as famous as the Ancient Gods of yore, who
were able to conquer the universe.</p>
<p>ver</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God went on to say, “But when Sacred appeared and
the God Spirits descended to fight, the Ancient Gods fell. We were
not the leaders of the universe anymore. Do you know why the
Ancient Gods were made like so?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was quiet a moment before saying, “Ancient Gods breed by
the generations. If the Ancient God Origin is not destroyed, the
Ancient Gods can carry on. Their powers are not damaged. According
to the theory, you guys can be the best. I also think it is weird
how Ancient Gods ended up like so.”</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God said, “Yes. From back then until now, 3,000
Ancient Gods, not one more and not one less. Even if an Ancient
God’s Ancient God Origin was destroyed, they can be reborn as a new
Ancient God in God Land. In theory, the Ancient Gods can be in the
best condition.” He seemed pretty excited as he spoke. Even the
rainbow lights on him looked weird.</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God went on to say, “But that is just a theory.
In fact, after Sacred appeared, Ancient God’s Ancient Gods have
been less.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying Sacred killed Ancient Gods?” Han Sen asked with
a frown. “That is not right. Even if they killed Ancient Gods and
destroyed their Ancient God Origins, your God Land can create more
Ancient Gods. They should not be reduced like that.”</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God coldly said, “That is why we feel so weird.
Our Ancient Gods are missing. We cannot see them, and we cannot
find their dead bodies. In God Land, no Ancient God can respawn.
They just vanish from the universe. There were 3,000 Ancient Gods,
but now there are only 300 Ancient Gods. Even our God King is gone.
He disappeared after the Sacred era.”</p>
<p>“Did that really happen?” Han Sen quietly asked. “If so, it
leaves only one possibility. Someone imprisoned these Ancient
Gods.”</p>
<p>“That is what we thought too,” Ancient Origin God said with a
sigh. “We have scoured the entire universe. No matter whether it
was Sacred or Outer Sky, our people’s searches were in vain. We
were never able to find anyone. Although we guessed Sacred did
something, there has been no evidence to support it. Now, Sacred is
destroyed, so it is so difficult to get to the truth.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Something so evil… There is an 80% to 90%
chance it was done by Qin Xiu. Aside from him, who else would have
had the means to make the famous Ancient Gods be reduced to
this?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say that out. He looked at Ancient Origin God
and asked, “So, are you not Old God King’s heir?”</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God nodded. “After our God King died, our people
were forced to pick a new God King. That was my past life. I had no
relation to Old God King.”</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed his jaw as he said to himself, “So, are you
saying Dragon Lady…”. “Yes. In her body, there is an Old God King
Origin Gene. It exists within her. For some reason, her body has
mixed with the genes of another creature. It made her blood very
impure.”</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God confirmed Han Sen’s guess and added,
“Although things are like that, her God King Gene is still
complete. It just needs to be activated. I am going to use the
Ancient God special food recipe to make Dragon Lady eat many
xenogeneic gene essences so she can activate her God King gene. She
will then take the seat of the true God King.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned after hearing that. The king of the Ancient Gods
sounded powerful. Now that he thought about it, the world was in
chaos. Demons were dancing everywhere. God Spirits were everywhere.
Allowing Dragon Lady to assume responsibilities for an entire race
was likely not a good thing. Han Sen stared at Ancient Origin God
and asked, “Have you asked for Dragon Lady’s opinion about all this
yet?” Ancient Origin God smiled. “Don’t worry, we Ancient Gods no
longer have the ambition to rule the universe. We just want to
survive. We just want to find out where the missing Ancient Gods
went. If Dragon Lady does not want to become God King, we will not
force her. If she can continue the God King blood, that would be
enough. It does not matter if she becomes a God King or not. She
just needs to continue on with our blood, and we need the geno holy
fluid.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at Ancient Origin God and suddenly asked, “Why do
you need my blood?”</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God returned Han Sen’s gaze. He coldly said,
“Because your blue blood belongs to Sacred Leader. That is the gene
power of Sacred. The Ancient Gods used to rule the universe and eat
every race. We absorbed the gene essence of every race to reinforce
our bodies, but we never had the gene essence of Sacred. With
Sacred Leader’s powerful genes, if Dragon Lady can get the help of
that gene essence, she will improve even more.”</p>
