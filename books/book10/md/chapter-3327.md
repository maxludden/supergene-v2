  “Black King.” Han Sen suddenly thought of the blue-clothed fairy mentioning someone.

The blue-clothed fairy coldly said, “If you know, that means you know you will not be dying for no reason. This is all because of what you did. It made the thousand jade fairies of the Black King City unable to be free.”

Han Sen wished to say something, but he saw a light shadow in Black King City. It was a white jade statue that looked like a king’s king. It looked similar to how the black king appeared. Han Sen could guess that it was the master of White Jade City.

Of course, the blue-clothed fairy went to the white jade statue and bowed. “Mister White King, we have captured the person that slew Black King. What do we do with him?”

“Black King is dead. Black King City has no master. It is a dead city. Bury him there with Black King and Black King City.” White King sounded cold. He did not seem to have the capacity for rendering human emotion.

The blue-clothed fairy nodded. “OK. It is a shame Mister Black King had only just been unsealed. He did not recover, yet he was killed by him.”

White King coldly said, “Black King had it coming, but it is a shame that Black King City is now afflicted with many jade fairies. They will have to sleep for another 10 million years for another jade king to be born so they are freed.”

As Han Sen heard them talking, he decided to ask, “If I can revive the jade fairies of Black King City, can we put our grudge to rest?”

After saying that, the blue-clothed fairy and White King looked at him. The blue-clothed fairy turned to him and asked, “What nonsense are you going on about? The jade fairies of Black King City are only something a Mister Black King can awaken. Even a sky full of God Spirits would be useless. Now, you’re saying a measly guy such as yourself can do what they can’t.”

Han Sen ignored the blue-clothed fairy. He looked at White King as he said, “I was just asking that if I was able to wake them up, then our grudge could be over.”

White King looked at Han Sen and said, “If you can revive the jade fairies of Black King City, you and the grudge with the White Jade Jing can be wiped from the slate. I will not go after you for murdering Black King.”

“Mister White King, do not listen to his nonsense,” the blue-clothed fairy said. “He will just want to trick us and have us release him from the trap fairy net. This person is very good at Galaxy Teleportation. If you release him, it will be very difficult to take him back.”

White King did not speak. He just looked at Han Sen.

Han Sen said, “There is no need for you to release me. Just tell me how Black King used to wake up the jade fairies. Maybe I will be able to wake them up.”

Seeing the blue-clothed fairy want to protest, Han Sen did not provide her with a chance to speak. He went ahead to ask, “There is no loss in giving this a try, is there?”

“Just let him give it a go,” White King said.

White King was done speaking. The blue-clothed fairy did not believe Han Sen could make Black King City’s jade fairies wake up, but she did not say anything about it.

“Please, tell me how Black King used to wake up the jade fairies.” Han Sen pointed at the black jade statue-looking life forms.

“If you do not even know that, how are you able to say you know how to wake them up?” the blue-clothed fairly coldly asked.

Han Sen did not move. He did not fight with the blue-clothed fairy. He looked at White King. He was the one who could do this.

White King still looked very cold. He slowly said, “White Jade Jing is up in the sky; 12 buildings, five cities. Fairies are above my head, and my hair grows. These lines come from the fairies. The White Jade Jing created a fairy jade. It did not have life. There were not 12 buildings or five cities until the fairies came here and turned the fairy jade into 12 buildings and five cities. They touched the jade to become fairies. That is how we have life and can walk across the ground.”

“A fairy, huh? Who were those fairies?” Han Sen was shocked. To touch a jade and become a fairy sounded like too much of an exaggeration. As for turning a jade stone into a life, that power was too scary.

Even the Geno God Hall Leader could not create life.

“The fairies were just fairies,” White King coldly said. He then added, “The fairies touched the jade to become fairies. In the 12 buildings and five cities, there was a jade fairy that became the ruler of the 12 buildings and five cities. Black King controlled Black King City. Only his fairy king aura can let Black King City’s jade fairies have life again.”

“If Black King was not killed, could Black King’s Break World rate enable the jade fairies of Black King City to have a will again?” Han Sen asked. “Is it only when Black King recovers that he can make the jade fairies of Black King City have a will again?”

“Same.” White King answered very simply.

When Han Sen heard him, he was a bit depressed. He had the Black King beast soul, so his power should have been similar to Black King. By using the Black King beast soul, he might have been able to wake up the jade fairies in Black King City.

But Han Sen had already given the Black King beast soul to Ji Yanran. He did not have it. If he went back for it, he was afraid the blue-clothed fairy and White King would not believe him.

The blue-clothed fairy stared at Han Sen and coldly asked, “How? How are you able to make Black King City’s jade fairies wake up?”

Han Sen held his head as he said, “You can give me a chance.”

Han Sen looked at a black jade. “Please, wait for a second and let me try.”

After Han Sen said that, he used his Blood-Pulse Sutra power and hit it into the little body of a black jade beast.

The Blood-Pulse Sutra could activate one’s Blood-Pulse power. It could evolve life. Before, Han Sen used the Blood-Pulse Sutra to help king-class creatures level up to god class. Now, his Blood-Pulse Sutra power had broken the world, so it was more powerful. Thus, Han Sen wanted to give it a go. He thought it might work.

If it didn’t work, he did not mind fighting White King and the others.

If possible, he did not want to become an enemy of the White Jade Jing. According to White King, the 12 buildings and five cities should have 17 jade fairies.

It meant that aside from Black King, there were Break World elites that were like the blue-clothed fairy. There were 16, and Han Sen could not fight them all.

Han Sen thought the fairy White King mentioned was interesting. It was able to create life. He had never heard of anyone like that before.

The Blood-Pulse Sutra power was pumped into the black jade little beast’s body. Han Sen, the blue-clothed fairy, and White King, the three people, stared at the black jade little beast.

In the beginning, the black jade little beast did not react. Han Sen’s attitude was like he was treating a living horse. He increased the amount of Blood-Pulse Sutra power he was using. After 10 minutes, there was still no movement from the black jade little beast. The blue-clothed fairy was already starting to feel annoyed. She wished to say something. Suddenly, the body of the black jade little beast had a red pulse that was rather like a vein.

The blue-clothed fairy stopped herself from saying what she was going to. She stared at the black jade little beast. She watched its blood vessels grow.

Han Sen remained calm, but his heart was quite excited. The Blood-Pulse Sutra worked on the black jade little beast, but he did not know what kind of level it would reach.
