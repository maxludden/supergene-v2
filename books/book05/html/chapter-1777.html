<h3>Chapter 1777</h3>

<p>“Long ago, three thousand prisoners were forced to mine ore
across Mosi Mountain. They were unable to leave until death claimed
them.” Kong Fei did not answer Duke Brilliant. All he did was say
something that made no sense, given the current context.</p>
<p>But after Duke Brilliant heard what he was told, his face paled
and he shouted, “Who are you!”</p>
<p>Kong Fei still did not answer. He kept going, saying, “Those
three thousand prisoners were slaves, kept here forever. They would
each die in the same bindings they were birthed into. After their
deaths, the feathers between their wings were plucked. There were
three thousand of them, and they provided the basis of this
garment.”</p>
<p>“Impossible… We already killed all the traitors a long time ago.
Who are you?” Duke Brilliant’s eyes cut like blades. He looked as
if he was ready to tear Kong Fei apart and slice-up all his
organs.</p>
<p>But Kong Fei just smiled and took off his feather clothing. His
upper body was naked, but two strange scars were visible on his
back. They looked as if they could have been the slots where wings
might have once existed, but they had been ripped off.</p>
<p>Duke Brilliant saw the scars on Kong Fei’s back, and when he
did, his face changed. His eyes flared with the fire of murder, and
he yelled, “I cannot believe there are traitors that yet remain! It
is lucky you were able to live this long. How dare you appear here,
having killed Feathers. You must die!”</p>
<p>After that, Duke Brilliant waited for no further reply. His body
shone with the color gold, as his wings spread out like suns of
their own. Their light shone across the area, and everything the
light touched was turned into gold.</p>
<p>The rivers became solid and the rocks became clumps of pure
gold. The entire vicinity became its own world of gold. Duke
Brilliant was most certainly the god of this world.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Stay Up Late were in shock. They knew that
everything happening was very bad, and such scary powers would be
difficult to fend off. And if they themselves were turned into
gold, they’d be killed immediately.</p>
<p>But before the gold light doused them, the white feathers Kong
Fei had given them started glowing with a bright white light. The
light was like a bubble that shielded their bodies from harm. The
gold light was unable to penetrate the holy light.</p>
<p>Kong Fei stood on the ground and put on his feather clothes
again. He ignored the gold light, and with much disdain, told their
enemy, “Of the three thousand, only I am left. But the three
thousand Feathers are still here, and I will seek vengeance for
each of them.”</p>
<p>“A traitor speaks of justice?” Duke Brilliant grunted. His wings
flapped like gold suns, firing shockwaves through the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Each time the wings flapped, Duke Brilliant became stronger. His
body wasn’t so big, but it did seem as if it was becoming larger.
He was taking on the appearance of a statue, as he stood there upon
the mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Kong Fei were like ants before him. It was quite
scary.</p>
<p>In the homes of the powerful Feather families, there were seven
Kings and a number of Dukes watching the video relay of a satellite
imaging system. They were watching what was happening on Mosi
Mountain.</p>
<p>When they saw the scars on Kong Fei’s back, they were all
shocked.</p>
<p>King-Sky King, the ruler, frowned and said, “There were three
thousand Feathers stuck in the mines of Mosi Mountain for their
entire lifetime. They were all turned into dust, or so it was
believed. How could one of them have survived?”</p>
<p>“My King, they did become dust. We could not have been
incorrect, and the king in those days confirmed this. There were no
survivors. Unless…” Song King stopped speaking there, and did not
continue.</p>
<p>“Unless what?” King-Sky King asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Unless one of them had a baby inside the gold mine without us
knowing. That child might not have been counted amongst the three
thousand. But if it were in places such as the Eclipse Gold Mine,
they could not have lived there. How could the prisoners have bred
successfully? And if they did, the baby could not escape the eye of
the watcher. It could not have survived and lived. It just makes no
sense.” Song King shook his head.</p>
<p>“This person appearing now is pointless. Just go ahead and kill
him, and get this done.” Holy Column King did not move his eyebrows
as he spoke, he just said things lackadaisically.</p>
<p>All the other kings agreed, and they proceeded to watch the
video.</p>
<p>Duke Brilliant was like a Buddha as he tried repeatedly to
strike Kong Fei with his palm. The golden palms covered the entire
sky, like a golden palace was falling. The shadows they cast were
abyssal, shrouding the landscape in darkness.</p>
<p>Kong Fei’s eyes did not move. He just pulled out a white feather
and drew across the sky.</p>
<p>A small white light rose into the air. It cut the giant hand. A
lesion appeared across it and grew bigger until it was revealed
that the hand had been sliced in half. Gold blood started to
cascade.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>The scream was incredibly loud, but the hand did not stop
descending. A small white line traced up the hand, down the arm,
and across the body that the arm connected to. Duke Brilliant’s
gold body was cut open, splitting in two.</p>
<p>The earth was shaking as the blood rained from the sky with the
force of a river. Mountains and rivers were further dyed with the
gold blood. Only the white feathers looked new and undrenched,
without a speck of blood on them.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Stay Up Late were surprised. For him to have killed
a Duke so easily, Kong Fei had to have been a King. The many Kings
and Nobles were in shock. Song King himself looked dim and said, “I
cannot believe that hybrid managed to become a King.”</p>
<p>“Leader, please grant me permission to fight the hybrid.” One
King stepped forward, looking murderous.</p>
<p>“Killing a hybrid like this will require thunder. I will fight
alongside you.” Holy Column King stood up, asking King-Sky King for
permission to depart</p>
<p>Before he replied, Kong Fei waved his white feather again. Mosi
Mountain, which was a thousand meters high, was sundered in two by
the same feather.</p>
<p>Below the thousand-meter-high mountain were thousands of
nameless graves. If the mountain had not been broken, no one would
ever have known. And yet, so many lives were buried there.</p>
<p>Kong Fei walked in front of the nameless graves, and just when
Han Sen thought he was going to pray for them, Kong Fei grabbed his
clothes and shook them.</p>
<p>The clothes exploded in the air. The feathers scattered all
across the graves.</p>
<p>The feathers flew onto the graves and exploded. They revealed
the bones that lay hidden beneath.</p>
<p>The bones were rotten, and many had been reduced to nothing but
dust. Two feathers landed on each grave.</p>
<p>“Three thousand years of hope-sapped waiting. Three thousand
years of sadness and injustice. Three thousand years of
humiliation. I am going to win it all back. You guys will not need
to wait for me any longer. You don’t need to stay in this world any
longer.”</p>
