  “There might be a way, but who are we going to send in there?” an Elder asked.

The God Chaos Party elites were attacking Space Garden. It seemed as if sounding the retreat would not be the right course of action.

“This is the sky reward,” Bird Elder said. “We cannot give it to someone else. I do not think there are any Break World elites left in Space Garden. If there were, they would not allow the Break World beasts to attack the bai sema. So, the bai sema beast should be able to do this itself. But the reward will go to the bai sema beast. Perhaps we will not receive any of the benefits. We must go there by ourselves, so we can get a reward from Mister Leader.”

“This…” When people heard what Bird Elder was going to go, they felt rather hesitant. They were all elders of the God Chaos Party and very strong

But they had lived for far too long. Normally, creatures that lived for such a long period of time cherished their lives. They would let themselves live a billion years and cherish their life greatly. So, they were God Chaos Party elders, but they were not the main members.

When Human King asserted control of the God Chaos Party, he did not have much in the way of manpower. That was why they were used. Otherwise, no one would have wanted them to attack Space Garden.

Of course, there was another reason. Many core members of the God Chaos Party had betrayed the organization. Bury Path God had been absorbed by Qin Xiu’s hands, and Rocky Dee was missing. There were not many people to use.

“If you guys do not want to come along, I will go alone. But you will not be able to quarrel over who the reward belongs to.” Bird Elder coldly laughed.

“Fine. I will go with you,” an elder moaned. He gnashed his teeth and decided to shoulder the risk with him.

Five more elders quickly agreed to join. They summoned the bai sema beast. The five of them hid themselves inside the bai sema beast. The bai sema snuck into Space Garden while the chaos was happening. Mister White was still playing chess with Lin Feng. His heart jumped. Something must have happened. His fingers were holding a chess piece. His other hand was holding several other chess pieces. He threw them down on the table. He looked at a few of the chess pieces and frowned. “Is it good or bad? If it is bad, it will be unable to be dodged. It is hard to predict if this is good or bad.” “Mister White, is something wrong?” Lin Feng asked.

“Nothing. Let’s just keep playing chess and defend this place,” Mister White said. He looked at Ji Yanran, the mother and daughter.

Ji Yanran was holding Ling’er. She was watching the fight going on up there. She was not very good when it came to combat, so she did not chip in.

Little Gold Gold laid down next to Ji Yanran. Ever since something happened in Space Garden, he had not left. It was like it had decided to perpetually sleep where it was.

Suddenly, the sleeping Little Gold Gold opened its eyes. It raised its head. It looked in a certain direction outside of the base.

Ji Yanran noticed Little Gold Gold’s odd behavior, so she asked, “Little Gold Gold, what is going on?”

Little Gold Gold did not answer her. He stood up and continued looking in a certain direction.

On the other side, Little Silver, Little Cat, the little red bird, and the other pets of the Han family were all resting. They all stood up and went to stand next to Ji Yanran, the mother and the daughter.

“Bird Elder is so smart,” said a God Chaos Party elder said who was sitting on the bai sema beast’s back. He was laughing like a madman. “The Space Garden elites are all out. I cannot feel the presence of any Break World elites right now. We are going to get a big reward for doing this.”

Space Garden’s Break World elites, the ones who were able to combat the threat, were already out. Now, all that remained were the students. Not even the strongest student had managed to break the world yet. They saw a beast that looked like a big dragon come, and it gave them all a shock. Their reactions were not slow. They used their powers to repel and slow the beast, but their powers were not sufficient to touch the body of the beast.

An elder was sitting atop the back of the bai sema beast. He was going to attack. He was going to kill the Space Garden student, but Bird Elder stopped him.

“Ignore them,” Bird Elder said. “Focus on the matter at hand. Killing these guys will be easy We can come back and mop the floor with them later.” He then commanded the big beast to go to the yard Ji Yanran was in.

He had learned where Ji Yanran lived a long time ago. He had formed this idea a long time ago.

“No! They are going to the yard where the leader is.” Many of the students of Space Garden were all in shock. They really wanted to stop the big beast now.

But their power was too small before the might of the bai sema beast. They would not even be able to touch the body of the bai sema beast. The bai sema beast was able to go through everything and head for Han Sen and Ji Yanran’s house.

Boom! Boom!

The whole of the house was broken down by the bai sema beast’s body. The house was shattered. Ji Yanran ran out of the house while clutching Ling’er.

“Are they Han Sen’s wife and daughter?” An elder caught sight of Ji Yanran and Ling’er. When he did, his eyes turned bright.

“Yes, that is them!” Bird Elder was very excited by the sight too. If he captured them, Han Bao’er was sure to emerge. “Bai Sema Beast, I command you to swallow them!” The elder that controlled the bai sema beast gave out an order. He wanted the bai sema beast to swallow Ji Yanran, the mother and the daughter. After that, they would hastily depart Space Garden.

The bai sema beast had only just opened its mouth when a gold light came from everywhere. A giant, gold, big beast appeared from space. It was far bigger than the bai sema beast. It swallowed the bai sema beast.

Bird Elder and the other elders were in shock. They all evaded the strike. The bai sema beast was far too slow to move out of the way, so it ended up getting bitten and chewed up by the big gold beast. It swallowed all of its skin and bones.

“What is going on? Since when did Space Garden harbor such a powerful creature?” An elder was in shock as he looked at Bird Elder.

Bird Elder looked at Golden Growler angrily and said, “Han Sen’s wife and daughter have a powerful creature looking over them. Stop talking crap! The bai sema beast is gone. We cannot get out now! We have no choice but to take down Han Sen’s wife and daughter. The five of us must work together. If we do, we can make that big gold beast fall. Just kill it!”

Bird Elder seemed to expect this would happen, otherwise, he would not have wanted to bring other elders to reap his rewards. The other elders knew it was too late for them to bail, so they gnashed their teeth to fight alongside Bird Elder.

Although their guts were small, and they were afraid to die, their power was still with them. The power they wielded was very scary. Five scary powers went for Golden Growler.

Golden Growler came before Ji Yanran and emitted a gold light. It fired a stream of gold light to strike the five incoming powers,

Boom!

Golden Growler’s body was blasted backward a little. He almost hit Ji Yanran and Ling’er, the mother and the daughter, but his body suddenly stopped.

Bird Elder and the others were both shocked and happy. Individually in the God Chaos Party, there five powers would have been rated from between medium and high. When used together, their five powers were enough to beat back the gold big beast. The gold big beast’s power was very scary.

They were happy their five powers could suppress the big gold beast, so that made them feel much safer.
