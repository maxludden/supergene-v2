    <p>
      &#8220;You win.&#8221; Blackgod&#8217;s face was deep like water as he
      coldly spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Had he had any choice, Blackgod wouldn&#8217;t have admitted defeat like
      that. But now he was frightened; he had been pushed to his limit and he
      had reached his breaking point. If he continued fighting, he knew it
      wouldn&#8217;t be long before he was killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Han Sen&#8217;s heart, he felt disappointed. His blocking skill was the
      last he would have wanted to cast. It was easy to break the Tornado Knife,
      but had he wanted to slay Blackgod, he would have had to rely on it. It
      was impossible to kill him with one swipe, so Blackgod had been given the
      opportunity to concede.
    </p>

    <p>
      He watched Blackgod call for him and his men to depart, his face draped
      with sullenness. Li Xing Lun then returned the Snow-Lady and Inferno Bull
      to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, you have very impressive skills. I can&#8217;t believe
      your skills denied Blackgod the time to perform any actions,&#8221; Li
      Xing Lun complimented him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My skills are ordinary - perhaps it was just Blackgod who is
      weak!&#8221; Han Sen laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod was still in earshot and felt his face turn scarlet when he heard
      what they said. But he did not turn to speak, and continued to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the fight, all the people across the ice field knew the name
      &#8220;Han Sen&#8221;. His fight against Blackgod quickly became renowned,
      a widely-spread tale that quickly established itself as the latest hot
      topic of discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not have the time to hear what others were saying, for as soon
      as he received the Snow-Lady he returned to the Crystal Palace. He drove
      the Crystal Palace to the Goddess Shelter, so he could inspect the
      situation there. At the same time, he gathered a batch of meat from
      deep-sea creatures to sell.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the way, Han Sen tried to get the Snow-Lady to possess his body. But
      all he felt was his body going cold and his face turning pale. His hair
      turned white and the structure of his body became significantly more
      feminine, compared to his previous masculine appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tested his speed, and noticed it had increased greatly. Although
      the beast soul only elevated his speed, the degree to which it had
      increased was truly significant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chill in his body allowed Han Sen to cast hisJadeskin skill with far
      greater ease. If it was an ordinary person taking advantage of the
      Snow-Lady, however, he feared their entire being would be frozen.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, with regards to the Snow-Lady beast soul, Han Sen was
      wholeheartedly satisfied with the results. He fed a black crystal to the
      Snow-Lady and evolved her into a Berserk variant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having returned to the Goddess Shelter, Han Sen delivered the flesh to
      Yang Man Li. He had been planning on venturing forward now to the
      Alliance, but Yang Man Li told him that Zero had not been eating enough
      recently – and she hadn&#8217;t eaten at all in the past few days.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why are you not eating? Is the food here not to your liking?&#8221;
      When Han Sen caught sight of Zero, she was sitting by a window of the
      tower. She watched the falling snow outside, seemingly lost in a blissful
      reverie.
    </p>

    <p>Zero shook her head and said, &#8220;I am not hungry.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are not God; how can you not be hungry? Come, tell me what you
      would like to eat and I shall make it for you.&#8221; Han Sen gently
      cuffed her head as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Can you take me with you, the next time you leave?&#8221; Zero
      turned gazing at Han Sen when she spoke, showing her wide eyes.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Um&#8230; sure&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hesitated for a moment. Zero&#8217;s identity was rather mystical,
      and he did not want her to know much about who he was. But thinking of
      her, without any family, he was probably the only person she had a true
      connection with. He felt sorry for her, and so did not wish to reject her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero&#8217;s face finally took on a smile. Although it was merely a
      raising of the lips, it would melt the heart of anyone who saw it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come. Let us eat first. Tell me what you would like, and I shall
      make it. I&#8217;m not bluffing when I tell you that my cooking skills
      cannot be below those of a three-rank restaurant&#8217;s chef.&#8221; Han
      Sen tugged at her to eat something.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was bluffing: in truth, his cooking abilities were quite poor. The
      extent of his abilities spread to cooking stews and grilling meat. If the
      food he wanted to eat could not be prepared and served through either of
      those methods, then he would simply eat it raw.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Zero, he grilled the freshest red-shell shrimp he had. She delicately
      supported her head with her tiny hands as she sat at the table. Han Sen
      diced the shrimp and after he grilled a portion, he delivered it directly
      to her mouth. Zero would open her mouth and quickly consume the entire
      spoonful of shrimp. Her eyes were shut tight in delight, as her face
      beamed with joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched her, and all of a sudden felt sorry. The clothes Zero was
      garbed in was the outfit he had bought her a long time ago. He then
      recalled it was the very same outfit he had bought her on their first
      meeting. It seemed as if he didn&#8217;t care much for her life anymore.
      He worried that she might have only have two sets of clothing, and that
      their color had long since faded, through the countless washes since.
    </p>

    <p>
      After they had eaten, Han Sen decided to buy a few new outfits for Zero
      from the shops that populated the Goddess Shelter. He gave her time to
      return home and change into her new clothes. When she came back to reveal
      herself, she looked far prettier and youthful than she had earlier in the
      day.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is what a young girl should look like,&#8221; Han Sen told
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not isolating Zero as much as he was previously because he
      really thought that she had no one else she could depend on. But that
      wasn&#8217;t the only reason, either. He knew how much stronger his own
      body had become, which gave him less reason to avoid her.
    </p>

    <p>
      He brought Zero into the Crystal Palace, and they searched for a lonely
      deep-sea mutant creature together. They also tried to figure out the Dual
      sword skill. While Han Sen was content to freely travel in the nearby
      area, he did not dare to enter the shelter that resided on the seabed
      there. The creatures in those waters mostly travelled in groups, and their
      numbers were multitudinous. If he wanted to hunt a high-rank creature, he
      would have to find one that lived alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero quietly sat in a corner, with her hands firmly planted upon her jaw
      as she watched Han Sen practice the dual-blade sword skill. She had no
      interest in talking with the Snow-Charmers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boat had been sailing for a few days when Han Sen saw a jellyfish that
      lit up like a giant lantern, coursing through the water with great energy;
      it looked beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It seems as if there are many jellyfish in the sea, but most of
      them are in a group. It&#8217;s rare to find one that is content to remain
      alone. Let us see if we can hunt it.&#8221; Han Sen thought about what to
      do, and then summoned Golden Armor and a glyph. He then left the Crystal
      Palace and swam towards the jellyfish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though there were no other creatures around him, Han Sen was wearing armor
      and a glyph for protection. Even if the jellyfish was of the Sacred Blood
      class, Han Sen had the power to protect himself. It would not be difficult
      for him to escape and return to the Crystal Palace if he needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was different being in the sea. Due to the flow of water, when Han Sen
      was swimming, it was possible for his presence to be detected by other
      creatures fairly quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the jellyfish that looked like a giant lantern seemed now to be moving
      quite slowly, remaining where it was, then rising up and down in the
      water. It seemed as if it did not notice Han Sen closing in on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That jellyfish looks so stupid, there is no way it could be a
      high-class creature.&#8221; Han Sen approached the jellyfish but did not
      summon the ghost-pawed claws. He simply got close and punched the
      semi-circular body of the jellyfish.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ghost-Pawed Claws were poisonous. Although Han Sen was not afraid of
      poison, the taste of the afflicted creature would be tainted by the
      substance. He therefore opted to use Yin Force to punch the jellyfish to
      death. It would taste better when they barbecued it later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen punched the translucent, wobbling jellyfish and his fist and arm
      tore right through the body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, all of a sudden, Han Sen&#8217;s face contorted. He felt as if his
      fist had punched through a mound of mud. He lost all strength, and the Yin
      Force no longer worked.
    </p>

    <p>
      He wanted to bring his fist back, which was still lodged in the body of
      the jellyfish, but he realized that the creature was holding on from the
      inside and not letting him go. No matter what direction he pulled, the
      jellyfish followed and remained stuck to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The jellyfish&#8217;s tentacles then encircled Han Sen and tied him up. He
      felt electricity surge from the jellyfish, making his body convulse and
      cramp. Unable to control himself, his mouth opened to gulp in the
      seawater.
