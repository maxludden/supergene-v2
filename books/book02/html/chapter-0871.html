    <h3>Chapter 871</h3>

    <p>
      Liu Fang and Wang Jiangang were consumed with terror, and so they quickly
      took off running into the forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stood firm, coldly looking at the hand. He may have encountered
      ghostly-looking creatures before, but he did not believe that genuine
      spirits-of-the-deceased ghosts actually existed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The figure&#8217;s hand burned hot with a lifeforce. If it was a ghost,
      how could there be a lifeforce?
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>
      The pale hand swung to the lid of the coffin and sent it flying away. A
      humanoid body then stood up from inside the coffin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The person was slender like a skeleton, and was two meters tall; an
      average human height.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the person was so gaunt, they were little more than skin and bones.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skin was discolored, with a greenish hue. He was pale, and it was
      difficult to determine whether or not blood pumped inside his body. The
      eyes of the person were pitch black, and the hair was grey and long; long
      enough to brush the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      After emerging from his grave, the person used his black eyes to look all
      around. As they scanned his environment, they fell upon Han Sen, and they
      did not move away from him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, but he was not afraid. He had encountered far more
      terrifying foes in the past, than the one he was seeing now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason for his surprise, however, was the tattoo that glazed the
      figure&#8217;s entire back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The person&#8217;s skin was rough but thin, like the bark of a dying tree.
      Its tattoo, though, was as red and lively as an actual flame. It looked
      fresh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cat-like symbol adorned its entire back. The image of the cat seemed
      to suggest it was sleepy, with half-open eyes. The tattoo seemed so real.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had come to be very familiar with this tattoo, as it was the
      symbol of the Nine-Life Cat. He had seen the image adorning cards that
      belonged to the Blood Legion. Zero had a tattoo of the same image, and Han
      Sen also owned a necklace depicting the same thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Might Zero have some relation to this person?&#8221; Han Sen asked
      himself, as he looked upon the figure with apprehension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The figure continued to look back at Han Sen, his pitch-black eyes masking
      any emotion he might have sought to express. Their eyes met for three long
      seconds before the person suddenly bore a smile. The teeth that were
      presented were clean and tidy, but still, the way in which they were shown
      would creep any onlooker out.
    </p>

    <p>
      A chill ran down Han Sen&#8217;s back, alongside a sudden outbreak of
      goosebumps.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The man stepped forward and onto the blood-stained soil. Then, strange
      things began to occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood from the deceased started to look alive. The blood flowed
      towards the person&#8217;s feet, soaking into his veins and coursing
      through his skin up to his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could see the blood enter his blood vessels. The veins were like
      narrow snakes, wreathing their way through his thin skin. It was a creepy
      and unnerving sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      He continued stepping forward, and wherever his feet went, so did the
      blood. The veins were lumpy, but slowly, the body started to look
      healthier. Before long, the figure started to look like a real, living
      person again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Han Sen asked, as the man coldly approached
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are a human? Haha. Who is irrelevant, but I am not a human;
      understand that.&#8221; The man presented another weird smile, which only
      added to the creepiness.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;If you are not a human, what are you?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What am I? Haha! You are asking me what I am? Haha!&#8221; The
      man&#8217;s laugh was a maniacal cackle. After a time of absorbing more
      blood, he looked healthier. Even the color returned to his hair, going
      from grey to a deep, rich, and shiny black color.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from his strange black eyes, the person could be mistaken for any
      average human. Han Sen thought of him as your typical pretty boy right
      now, albeit one with a sinister streak.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Did I say something funny?&#8221; Han Sen coldly said.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;As a Blood Legion faithful, are you telling me you do not recognize
      Son of Fate? Since when has Blood Legion fallen so far?&#8221; The man
      stopped smiling now, and asked Han Sen with a stare of weighty gravitas.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are from Blood Legion?&#8221; Han Sen was shocked. If he was
      from Blood Legion, did that mean Zero was from Blood Legion, as well?
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought about it some more and came to the conclusion she must
      have had some sort of connection to Blood Legion. If she didn&#8217;t,
      there&#8217;d be no reason for her to have that tattoo. And this person
      appeared right after she entered the tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are a devout member of the Blood Legion, are you not? And you
      say you don&#8217;t know me? You are ignorant, but that is okay. I will
      accept you as a sacrifice.&#8221; After he said that, he reached out his
      hand and tried to grab Han Sen&#8217;s neck.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sharp nails almost scraped Han Sen&#8217;s skin, but he was quick to
      dodge with the spring of a lunging snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strange man looked surprised and said, &#8220;Heavenly Go? As a Blood
      Legion member, how did you come to learn such a thing?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Stop saying that; I&#8217;m not a member of Blood Legion! I
      don&#8217;t have anything to do with you or them. So, tell me, if you are
      from Blood Legion, why were you in the coffin?&#8221; Han Sen frowned,
      wanting to extract as much information as he could before things turned
      too sour.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haha! You think you can hide your faith from me by simply not
      admitting your belief in our cause? You smell like the Blood Legion, boy.
      And that is one fragrance you can never be free of. You are of the Blood
      Legion, and only through the price of your own blood can you leave it. Do
      something meaningful with your pathetic self and give me your
      blood!&#8221; Son of Fate moved. He was fast, and he ran directly in front
      of Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and did not delay in engaging the
      creepy man. The nails collided with the Flaming Rex Spike, ringing out a
      sound of struck metal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The powerful force of their collision made Han Sen fall back with his
      Flaming Rex Spike. Son of Fate was no weaker than a super creature, it
      would seem.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Son of Fate looked surprised. He spoke to himself, saying, &#8220;How
      long was I asleep for? Are humans able to rival super creatures? Can they
      obtain super geno points and their beast souls? Hmm, it is better that
      way. Your blood is sure to taste even better, boy!&#8221; Son of Fate
      displayed a wild, ravenous smile. The blood red tongue licked his lip with
      an evil greed.
