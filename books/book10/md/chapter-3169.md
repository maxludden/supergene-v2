Han Sen was disappointed. Yan Bei Fei’s knife mind was not bad, but there was still a distance between it and the universe of kingdom’s truly top-class elites.

Yan Bei Fei suddenly stopped unleashing his knife skills. He stopped attacking Han Sen and held a knife up to the sky.

Yan Bei Fei looked at Han Sen and asked, “Do you use a knife?”

Han Sen did not use a skill. Yan Bei Fei was a swordsman, so his keen senses noticed something.

Han Sen looked like he was complimenting him. Although Yan Bei Fei’s skills were not something supreme, the potential was still there inside him. He would have plenty of time to improve in the future.

“Not bad,” Han Sen said with a nod. “You seem to know a thing or two.”

“Regarding knife skills, I am not as good as you. I lost this fight.” Yan Bei Fei said that, but he still went on to say, “But this is a fight I must win. Therefore, I apologize.”

After that, Yan Bei Fei’s body was ablaze with a space-ripping power. The wings of a blackbird arose behind him.

“Who is Dollar? How was he able to force Yan Bei Fei to use the noble Yan family’s rare gene race, rip space nine-rob Yan.” The nobles of the Yan Kingdom saw Yan Bei Fei’s body look weird. It gave them all a shock.

The rip space nine-rob Yan was a gene race of the Yan Kingdom’s royal ancestors. It had been living for a few dozen generations, but it had yet to reach ultimate mode. It still only had an adult body.

It was incredibly hard for rare gene races to evolve. Even with a lot of resources, success was not always guaranteed. That was the case with this rip space nine-rob Yan. Throughout its entire life, it had to endure nine robberies to reach ultimate mode. The Yan Kingdom did not have many generations. It had only experienced eight sky robberies. As such, it had failed to reach ultimate mode.

Even so, since competitors in the god fights could not combine with a God Spirit in the god fights, it was the biggest amount of power he could muster.

Every kingdom had God Spirit gene races. In an event like the god fights, no one dared to use one. It would have also exposed the potential trump cards of a kingdom and likely result in other kingdoms trying to take advantage of them.

Therefore, of the gene races that could take part, the strongest potential gene race was a rare gene race with an ultimate body. The rip space nine-rob Yan was almost that strong.

If it were a normal fight, Yan Bei Fei would have rather lost than use the rip space nine-rob Yan. This time, he needed to help Yan Dan. No matter what it took, he was not going to lose. The moment he finished combining with the rip space nine-rob Yan, Yan Bei Fei’s entire body was like a god in the sky. Every move he made was able to tear through space. It carried a powerful space power. Han Sen looked at Yan Bei Fei and coldly said, “That is nothing. A gene race is an extension of one’s power. Bring out your best power!” “As you wish. I will try my best this time.” Yan Bei Fei slowly put the Flying Yan knife back into its scabbard. He touched the handle again.

Time appeared to freeze. Space was frozen too. When Yan Bei Fei drew the knife, space looked like it had been ripped by his strike. He carried an incredible speed and power as he slashed toward Han Sen.

The knife, which ripped through space, was like a teleportation strike. Ordinary humans were unable to dodge something like that. It was a shame that Han Sen was not a normal human. He was excellent when it came to teleporting, and he had fought against elites that could infinitely teleport. A power like that was something people believe resulted in a one-hit kill. To him, it was not going to be as effective as the Yan Return.

Han Sen sighed. He raised his right hand and used his palm like a knife. He moved his body. He was going to go against Yan Bei Fei’s rip space knife air.

Like a fleeting shadow, Han Sen and Yan Bei Fei suddenly had their backs facing each other. Ordinary people had not been able to see what happened.

Yan Bei Fei slowly turned around. He asked Han Sen, “What was that knife skill?”

“It was just a random wave. It was not a knife skill.” After Han Sen said that, he did not look back at Yan Bei Fei. He merely walked to the exit.

Blergh!

Yan Bei Fei’s chest gushed blood. Several knife marks appeared across his shoulders and all the way down to his belly. They dyed his armor red. His body fell out of the space battleground.

The nobles and young people of the Yan Kingdom watching the fight went silent. No one believed that after using the ultimate gene race rip space nine-rob Yan, the very famous Flying Yan Swordsman of the Yan Kingdom was killed with one hit.

“Very good, but not really a knife skill. I am afraid this person’s knife skills are too rare.” Zhuo Dong Lai looked at Han Sen with a strange sort of stare. He looked as if he was ready to fight.

He was supposed to just watch Yan Bei Fei. He did not expect to witness this turn of events.

“Go and dig me up some information on this. Find out where the God of Wealth Temple lies.” Yan Dan looked calm as he made his commands. In his eyes, the zest for murder blazed.

Yan Bei Fei was not born from the same mother, but their relationship was like that of real brothers. He was going to avenge Yan Bei Fei’s death no matter what it took.

“Dan, I could not help you this time.” Yan Bei Fei was shaky as he walked out of the screen of light. He was covered in blood, but he was not dead.

“Brother Two, you are not dead!” Yan Dan was as much shocked as he was happy. He quickly ran forward to hold Yan Bei Fei. “That person kept me alive,” Yan Bei Fei said. “That guy is certainly mysterious. My knife skills were like child’s play in front of him. You will have to be careful when you encounter him.” He then passed out in Yan Dan’s arms.

Yan Dan shouted, “Hurry! Get a doctor to heal Brother Two!”

Because it was just the beginning, no one thought Yan Bei Fei would lose. Not many people believed the fight would be that exciting. Aside from the nobles of the Yan Kingdom who focused on Yan Bei Fei, very few people watched that fight.

People quickly noticed that Yan Bei Fei had been kicked out in the first round. It shocked everyone. When they looked at Yan Bei Fei’s opponent, their faces were frozen. The names Dollar and God of Wealth were too strange for them to comprehend.

In the Yan Kingdom, those two names had become famous. No one knew the names before, but now everyone did.

That was especially true about Dollar. When the Yan Kingdom’s nobles and civilians talked about what happened, their teeth felt itchy.

Killing people was just having heads strewn across the floor. Yan Bei Fei lost. When Han Sen said that it was just a random wave and not a knife skill, it humiliated the people of the Yan Kingdom. They thought Han Sen had deliberately humiliated Yan Bei Fei.

They did not know that Han Sen really did randomly wave. He did not employ any knife skill. Han Sen was merely being honest.

In this world, what hurt people the most was the truth. So the people of the Yan Kingdom hated Han Sen to the bone. They wanted his next opponent to teach him a lesson. They wanted him to get stepped on and humiliated.

No matter what, the people of the Yan Kingdom remembered Dollar and God of Wealth. It was like sharp knives had been used to carve those names in their hearts. They could not forget this, even if they wanted to. It was a bloody humiliation.
