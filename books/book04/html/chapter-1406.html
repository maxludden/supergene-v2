      It didn’t take long for the humanoid tree to absorb the mound of dust. Its
      previously dull and unremarkable lifeforce then began to resemble the
      person Han Sen had just slain: Hezhi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not sure if it was exhaustion playing tricks on his eyes, but
      he could then swear he was seeing the tree shrink to take on the form of
      Hezhi himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it did, but fortunately, it did not replicate the mindset of the
      person Han Sen had just killed. It looked like Hezhi now, but it just
      stood in place without motion, where it had absorbed his remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took a step back, just in case. The last thing he wanted to do was
      trigger or invoke the ire of something he did not have to.
    </p>
    <p>
      After stepping back a bit, Han Sen decided now might be a good time to
      return to the forest of statues in that plaza. The wolves that hounded him
      to the garden had dispersed, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provided they stayed gone, Han Sen should have no issue returning there.
      He might even be able to get back to his teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Han Sen began his return trek, he suddenly saw the brain-carrots
      leaping off their harboring trees to stand upright on the ground before
      him. It looked like the entire garden did not want Han Sen to return, for
      all the trees and plants began to close in around him. The way back was
      closed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen decided to walk forward in the way he originally had been. He
      spoke aloud to the garden, saying, “Okay, I’ll play it your way. I’ll see
      where you wish to lead me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen walked the path through the garden he had originally been on,
      the rest of the botanical residents returned to their initial positions,
      too, as if nothing had changed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking for a while, however, the garden began to take an
      unexpectedly pleasant turn. In fact, it started to look pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flowers soon looked like butterflies, and the trees were sculpted like
      beautiful carvings and wooden furniture. It was like something you’d see
      in a fairytale. It looked almost unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen soon came to a lake. Its surface was still, glassy, and blue like
      a clear summer’s sky. At the center of the lake was a stone tablet. In
      front of it stood a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This person wasn’t someone Han Sen was familiar with, and as he walked
      closer to get a better look, he saw that the man was clad in sparklingly
      white, clean clothing. He wasn’t the sort of person you’d expect to see in
      such a sordid shelter.
    </p>
    <p>“My child; you are finally here,” the man in white clothing said.</p>
    <p>“Are you talking to me?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Of course, my child.” The man seemed to be speaking to Han Sen, but his
      attention seemed affixed to the stone tablet he was in front of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought it weird, that the man continuously referred to him as my
      child.
    </p>
    <p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked, with a frown.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew this was not someone whose voice he had heard before, and
      neither was it a person he had seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I could ask you the same, but only my children are capable of coming
      here. So, that is what I can best assume you to be.” The man in white
      clothing spoke in a very relaxed manner. He spoke as if he had awoken from
      a restful slumber, and was at peace and tranquility.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak plainly. It has been a long day, and I’m not in the mood for
      games.” Han Sen spoke with a stern voice, primarily because he could not
      stand being called my child any more than he could stand being called
      boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am a shadow, and I have waited for your arrival for quite some time,”
      the man in white clothing said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My arrival? Me? You know who I am?” Han Sen thought the man was very
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it wasn’t for the mist skating gracefully across the lake, Han Sen
      would have been able to scan the man and get a clear reading of who or
      what he might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but it does not matter. You are here; therefore, you are my child,”
      the man in white clothing said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was getting annoyed. The man was speaking quite a bit, but he
      wasn’t actually saying much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his crystal egg with the desire to throw it at the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He’d had enough of being called his child, so he cared little for who the
      man believed him to be. He wanted to shut him up so he could continue with
      the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Han Sen could lob it, though, the man suddenly said one more thing
      which stayed his arm. He said, “This is the only thing I can give you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The man walked into the tablet as if he was a ghost, passing through a
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone tablet had once been empty, but was now scrawled with a few
      additional words.
    </p>
    <p>“God has returned…”</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was quite surprised to see the words of Life Door now appear on
      the tablet. He peered at the tablet a little closer then, and before his
      eyes, the entirety of Life Door began to show up on the stone.
    </p>
    <p>The words appeared one by one.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was delighted, though, and he quickly tried to remember everything
      that was written down.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading it all, he felt as if his Blood-Pulse Sutra was starting to
      run by itself and generate a brand new geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen always believed he was going to create a geno core with it, but
      there was something prohibiting him from completing the process. There was
      always a snag he was getting caught on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, just seeing Life Door written before him on such a pristine lake,
      it had freed up whatever was hindering his progress. The Blood-Pulse Sutra
      got to work producing a new geno core with no trouble now.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This place really is connected to Blood Legion. That man must believe I
      am a part of Blood Legion,” Han Sen thought to himself, as he read the
      text and did his best to memorize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the text was all revealed, his Blood-Pulse Sutra began to fire on all
      cylinders. The process of producing a brand new geno core was well
      underway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black crystal was also triggered, prompting more of that black fluid
      to taint the mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time Han Sen had the ability to watch the geno core
      produce. Before, he had always been under fire and unable to, and he found
      it remarkable how much the substance created looked like a supernova.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was rather shocked when he laid eyes on the finished geno core.
