<p>“You guys took the item. Shouldn’t you be leaving now? Stop
bothering the resting place of Undying Bird.” The old woman did not
look happy. She waved her hand.</p>
<p>“You take it,” Bai Wei said to Han Sen as she let go of the
item.</p>
<p>“How could I do this?” Han Sen looked very guilty, but on the
inside, he was as happy as a flower on the verge of blooming. “This
is something that is as good as a deified thing. I may not know
what it does, but it has to be something good.”</p>
<p>Bai Wei rolled her eyes. I am only asking you to hold onto it
temporarily. Don’t think too deeply about it.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders. Without saying anything, he just
moved to grab the Undying Bird Nest. The Undying Bird Nest was like
a deified item, but without its approval, not even a deified elite
could make use of it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised he had earned the will and approval of
Undying Bird. Now that he had been approved to be able to make use
of the Undying Bird Nest, it was useless for others. Even Bai Wei
would not be able to take it.</p>
<p>“You can’t put the blame on me for stealing it. You are the one
that did not finish the Way of Life and Death,” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>The old woman did not seem very happy about the fact they had
taken the Undying Bird Nest, and now she wished them gone.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the bird nest, and as he was, he left
Extreme Dead. He went back the way he came, and as he did, he soon
came before the coast.</p>
<p>There were many lava bugs spread out across the lava sea. They
were like little burning lava fairies. Their heat was hotter than
the lava, and they were only resting. If they unleashed their heat
all together, even a Duke’s armor would be melted.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to fly, but he realized he was still unable to.
They would have to tread across the lava sea.</p>
<p>Bai Wei suddenly smiled at Han Sen, which sure gave him a
surprise. Seeing a cocky person give someone a smile elicited a
different feeling to the witness of an average smile.</p>
<p>Bai Wei pulled out a leaf. She put godlight into it and then
threw the leaf into the lava sea.</p>
<p>The leaf expanded in the air. It looked like a small ship in the
lava sea when it came down. It was green like jade. The leaf
floated atop the lava sea. The lava bugs, however, started to avoid
it in the lava. They did not dare draw close to the leaf.</p>
<p>Bai Wei stepped on the leaf, turned around, and looked at Han
Sen. “If you guys are willing to be my knights, I am willing to
take you away from here safely.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, but no thanks.” Han Sen smiled. The woman was drunk on
her own pride. She did not bother to find out who Han Sen was
exactly, and the only threat before them were a few lava bugs. They
weren’t going to stop him.</p>
<p>Bai Wei saw Han Sen and his friends huddle together, then Han
Meng’er summoned a blue shield. It shielded them all just as they
moved to walk across the sea of lava.</p>
<p>Bai Wei frowned and advised Han Sen, “When the lava bugs are
shocked, they will explode. The heat they create can melt a Duke
class defensive item. Even King class armor can break with the
heat. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the tip,” Han Sen replied, but he did not stop
walking across the sea.</p>
<p>They were walking across the lava sea with the Demon Bug King
Bai Sema for protection when suddenly many of the lava bugs
approached. Their bodies were like burning steel, and they launched
themselves against the surface of the Bai Sema. They exploded with
a searing heat. The heat was able to melt any kind of steel, but
the Bai Sema did not melt at all.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked quite surprised seeing this. Her facial
expression was a complicated one. Bai Wei was operating her leafy
vessel. She watched the others cross the lava sea. She was
surprised by the level of defense the Demon Bug King Bai Sema had.
She couldn’t help but stare at it.</p>
<p>“How many tricks does this guy have up his sleeve?” Bai Wei
looked at him weirdly.</p>
<p>They walked one mile from the shore of the island, and when
crossing the threshold, their abilities to cast air powers
returned. Han Sen and his companions started to fly up and away
from the sea of lava.</p>
<p>The lava crocodiles that attacked did nothing to the Demon Bug
King Bai Sema, either. Bai Wei had to put the leaf away and use her
own powers to fight her way out of the lava sea’s region.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed at her, but he did make an offer for others to
join him inside the shield; she just didn’t reply to him. She left
by her own means.</p>
<p>“This woman is way too full of pride.” Han Sen shook his head.
He continued to investigate the Undying Bird Nest as he did so.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine it, and he
could see how the Undying Bird Nest was full of mysterious cause
substance chains. There were a lot of them, and there weren’t any
gaps. It was scarier than the core substance chains on the
stairs.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried, but he failed to activate the nest’s power. He
researched it for a while, but he could not figure out what its
purpose was.</p>
<p>“I will have to try some more when I get home. This bird nest’s
power cannot be any less than Purgatory Heaven,” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>When they left the underground cave, Han Sen and his companions
returned to go for the Lava Valley again.</p>
<p>“Break the camera. Pretend nothing happened today. If you guys
dare speak a word about this, you’ll know what will happen, don’t
you?” Bai Wei looked at Bao’er, who was intently filming her with
the camera.</p>
<p>“This is bad. We just destroyed a camera the other day. Now
we’re going to destroy another one?” Han Sen looked terrible.</p>
<p>“I will talk to Ice Blue Knight King. Just do it!” Bai Wei
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was delighted, but his face still looked very bad. He
said, “Alright, but there is still a while to go before we head
back to base with this mission. How about we destroy it right
before we return?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want anyone to see any of that either, but if
Bai Wei was willing to take responsibility, destroying it would be
good.</p>
<p>Bai Wei stopped talking. She kept walking ahead through the
valley. She was there because of the deal, but she was being
punished. She could not go back to the Extreme King just yet.</p>
<p>Bai Wei’s punishment was because of Han Sen. Bai Wei lost the
Destroyed Bible she had been tasked to recover all because of
Dollar. That was why she was being punished by King Bai, but the
punishment was for Bai Wei to retrieve the Undying Bird’s item. No
one probably expected Bai Wei to not dare ascend the steps. Han Sen
was the one who had earned the approval of the Undying Bird
instead.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others continued their search through Lava
Valley. After three days, someone else was in Lava Valley who had
been following them.</p>
<p>Night River King looked cold. Although he had been forced to go,
his mind to kill Han Sen wasn’t.</p>
