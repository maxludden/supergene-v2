<p>Rain slid down the roof. It landed on a stone board and created
some bubbles.</p>
<p>Looking outside, there was an old house at the peak of a
mountain. There were also lots of other mountains. The rain created
a layer of mist that draped the mountains.</p>
<p>Crunch!</p>
<p>The rain was very heavy. The door of the old house opened.
Because the house was so old, the door made sharp noises. Even the
sound of the heavy rain was not able to keep it down.</p>
<p>The big door of the old house was pushed open. The first thing
that appeared was an elegant pair of red high heels. Next, there
was a white, smooth, jade leg, and a red qipao.</p>
<p>A woman was wearing a red qipao. She was holding a red umbrella.
She walked into the house with her body wagging seductively. Her
hair was like a cloud.</p>
<p>“Fortune-teller, how long are you going to hide?” The
red-clothed woman with the red umbrella walked into the center of
the old yard. She looked at what was in the house and spoke her
words like a ghost.</p>
<p>Her voice was soft, but the rain still could not hide it.</p>
<p>The room had a door with flower carvings on it. It was pushed
open. An old man stepped out with a flag. His other hand clutched a
wine gourd. He was sitting on a broken square table. After taking a
sip of alcohol, he looked at the red-clothed woman, who was
outside, and said, “If I were able to hide for one hour, I would
hide for one hour. If I could hide for one more second, I would
hide for one more second. I would rather survive for as long as
possible than be dead. If I can live a bit longer, I will live a
bit longer.”</p>
<p>The rain was too much. The umbrella was very low, so one was not
able to see what the red-clothed woman looked like. Yet her
ridiculously curvy body and long black hair, which looked like a
waterfall, were very eye-catching. One may not have been able to
see her face, but one could recognize her.</p>
<p>“I am afraid you would prefer death compared to living,” the
woman chillingly said as she stood in the rain.</p>
<p>The old man laughed and said, “That means you are here to
collect my life.”</p>
<p>“It depends on whether you are accurate or not,” the red-clothed
woman said. “That will determine if I take your life.”</p>
<p>The old man picked up his gourd and had another sip of alcohol.
He squinted his eyes as he asked, “So was I accurate or not?”</p>
<p>“You were accurate but also not accurate,” the red-clothed woman
replied.</p>
<p>“I really don’t understand what you are saying.” The old man
laughed as he asked, “Which is accurate, and which is not
accurate?”</p>
<p>The red-clothed woman was silent a moment before saying, “The
prediction you did for my master was very accurate. The god palaces
appeared again, but the other half is not accurate. The god palaces
did not break through. They still suppress a full sky.”</p>
<p>The fortune-telling old man laughed. “Master is in too much of a
rush. It is not time yet.”</p>
<p>“There is only a month left,” the red-clothed woman said. “Even
an Annihilation god temple has yet to be broken. I do not see how
the geno hall will be broken in a month.”</p>
<p>“When the time comes, you will understand.” The fortune-telling
old man looked dull. He looked at the red-clothed woman and said,
“But I suggested it first. Your master needs to do as the old man
says. If there is no mistake, the prediction will come true.”</p>
<p>“I am here for that,” the red-clothed woman said. “My master
does not understand why he must do that. What does it have to do
with breaking the god palaces? That person has the ability, but he
has never reached that level. With his power, he cannot break the
god palace.”</p>
<p>“Predicting someone’s fate is not easy. The old man traded his
whole life to get this result. About the progress, I, the old man,
cannot predict it all. If you do not believe the old man, you do
not have to do it.” The fortune-telling old man spoke as if he did
not care.</p>
<p>“I hope you are right. Otherwise, you should know that if you
make the master mad, even that guy in the geno hall will not save
you. From now on, you stay here. Until that day comes, you can
predict your life. You can’t blame others.” The red-clothed woman
turned around and left after speaking. In the rain, she walked
until the rain covered all vision of her body.</p>
<p>The old man squinted his eyes and looked at the sky full of
rain. He said to himself, “If I did not want to, do you guys think
you can really find me and trap me here? You really underestimate
me, Han Jinzhi.” While he was speaking, the old man was holding the
wine gourd and the cloth, which had the word “destiny” written
down. He walked out of the living room and headed for the yard
behind the old house.</p>
<p>The raindrops dripped off the old man, wetting his clothes and
hair. Only the cloth that told one’s fortune did not touch any
water. It was like it was immune to the rain.</p>
<p>The old man walked to the farthest part of the yard, which was
the highest point of the mountain. He waved his hand and walked a
few circles in the yard. After a while, he calculated something. He
paused for a bit before placing the cloth into the gap of the stone
board. He walked back a few steps and looked at the cloth. He fixed
the angle and position. With a look of satisfaction, he said, “The
end is not the end of fate. I, Han Jinzhi, cannot change fate, but
I will not let that moment be the end.”</p>
<p>After that, the old man walked back into the living room. He
laid on the broken bed and yawned. He quickly fell asleep. Han Sen
and Bai King spoke for a while. Han Sen then left the asteroid
field. Bai King wanted to kill Moment God. It did not seem like a
mere coincidence. He knew the relationship between Han Sen and
Golden Growler, so he must have known Han Sen was planning to save
Golden Growler.</p>
<p>Bai King had also mentioned he had a way to break the time god
powers that had claimed Golden Growler, which would allow Golden
Growler to be set free. He could then use Golden Growler’s power to
fight Moment God.</p>
<p>After everything came together, Bai King planned to kill Moment
God. Bai King did have a request. After Moment God was killed, he
wanted to be the one to take the god personality armament.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have a problem with that. He lacked the
confidence for killing Moment God by himself. If it worked, he was
fine with giving Bai King the god personality armament. In Bai
King’s plan, he needed to have Dollar do it. He also needed to
cooperate with Han Sen. That very much troubled Han Sen.</p>
<p>Bai King only knew Dollar was the Holy Baby. He did not know
Dollar was Han Sen too.</p>
<p>He saw Han Sen go to save Golden Growler, and he agreed with Han
Sen’s power too. He asked Dollar to contact Han Sen so that he
could chip in and help them out.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Bai King knew his secret, which is why he asked
him. After Bai King’s explanation, he knew he had no clue.</p>
<p>Bai King only knew Dollar was the Holy Baby and that the Holy
Baby came from Space Garden. Thus, he guessed that Dollar was a
good friend of Han Sen and wanted him to contact Han Sen.</p>
<p>Bai King never imagined a crystallizer and a xenogeneic would
have been the same person. “Where am I going to find a Han Sen for
him?” Han Sen had a wry smile. Although Space Garden had many
elites, none of them had developed fully. He could not find anyone
who was able to disguise himself as Han Sen or Dollar.</p>
