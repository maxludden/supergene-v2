<h2>Leveling Up to True God</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2957</h3>

<p>Han Sen was afraid that if he leveled up and did not go into
xenogeneic mode, he would only have a battle body. That would have
been a waste.</p>
<p>Now, there was no reason for him to be so cautious. Han Sen was
not in his xenogeneic body. He only used Jadeskin to push himself
this far, but he wanted to take Jadeskin to true god class
first.</p>
<p>As soon as he started evolving, his four battle bodies started
to change. He did not just level up one battle body out of his
xenogeneic mode.</p>
<p>“Now, I know that if I am not in xenogeneic mode, I can still
level up.” Han Sen was happy. He thought leveling up one battle
body was a waste. He also did not want to expose his xenogeneic
mode, which was why he chose his Jadeskin. Now, four battle bodies
were leveling up together. That was very good.</p>
<p>The cells of his composition quickly changed. The functions of
his body greatly increased. The substance chains of his genes were
modified. Han Sen’s entire body was like it had been reborn.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen’s whole body was wrapped up by Spell Armor, and
the blue robe was dressing the Spell Armor, one only saw his head,
face, hands, and Spell Armor.</p>
<p>Even so, one was able to witness shocking changes. The white
Spell Armor’s spell flickered. The spells behaved like they were
melting. They were melting into the armor. The armor turned bright.
It looked like a crystal. It was as if it had burned into
transparent metal.</p>
<p>Seeing the black smoke cover the universe and space, it was like
a demon landing atop the world. Han Sen clenched his fists and
faced the black smoke, which covered the sky and covered the
ground. He immediately punched.</p>
<p>The demon lady frowned. Old Vulture’s black smoke was not just
something powerful. It was not quite so straightforward. It had a
power that could ravage one’s soul. Even if the body was not hurt,
touching the black smoke still resulted in death.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not use treasure. He used his fist to fight Old
Vulture’s black smoke. The demon lady believed he must have had a
death wish.</p>
<p>“Keep him alive!” the demon lady shouted at Old Vulture. She was
afraid that Old Vulture was too excited and would kill Han Sen. If
that happened, the holy spirit would be gone.</p>
<p>Old Vulture did not hear her. Earlier, it had been very sad. Now
that it was able to fight with all of its power, its murderous mind
was fully triggered. It could not think straight anymore. It was
too late for the demon lady’s reminder.</p>
<p>The demon lady saw Old Vulture looking murderous and knew the
situation was bad. Along with the holy spirit being destroyed
alongside Han Sen, Littleflower learning the truth would be very
bad.</p>
<p>In the universe, there were not many phoenixes or Kirins around.
There were xenogeneics similar to them. Like the demon lady, Old
Vulture, eyeless best, their four powers were not much weaker than
any of the holy beasts.</p>
<p>There were only four holy beasts there, and they had their
reasons to be.</p>
<p>The four holy beasts were called the four holy beasts because
they were the ultimate weapons Sacred Leader made to kill God.
Sacred Leader used them to fight against God’s holy spirit
armament.</p>
<p>Out of those four holy beasts, the only one that had the holy
spirit armament was the Holy Kirin. The others, like the phoenix,
ghost cast, and Nine-Life Cat, did not become holy spirits when
Sacred was destroyed.</p>
<p>Now, the ghost car and phoenix were gone. It was unknown whether
or not they had lived or died. Nine-Life Cat guarded the
sanctuaries, so the only holy spirit armament remaining was on the
Holy Kirin. If it was destroyed, it would be very bad for Sacred’s
plan of rising from the ashes. They were missing this required
powerful weapon.</p>
<p>The demon lady had many ideas flashing through her mind. She did
not say anything. The black smoke and Han Sen’s fist collided.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the demon lady and eyeless big beast opened
their eyes wide. Han Sen’s fist blew up the black smoke. It was
like the black smoke was no greater than ordinary smoke. It was
destroyed and unable to do anything.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist punched the black smoke. The black smoke created
a giant vacuum zone. Han Sen went through it and teleported in
front of Old Vulture.</p>
<p>“Very good timing.” Old Vulture was not shocked. It was
happy.</p>
<p>It was the most invincible in the universe. It was a true god
class xenogeneic fish bird. Aside from Sacred Leader, in that
universe, it had never felt obliged to bow before anyone else. It
would not retreat from combat against Han Sen.</p>
<p>A bird sound shook the whole universe. Old Vulture flapped its
wings. Its sharp claws had a rip space power. It was headed for Han
Sen’s fist.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The fist and talons collided. The Old Vulture’s talons could
shred anything in the universe, but they were broken by Han Sen’s
punch. The punching power did not relent there. It proceeded to
strike Old Vulture in the chest.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Old Vulture’s body was like a cannonball that fired away. It hit
a planet. The impact broke the planet. It kept falling back and
broke another planet. Then, there another one. It made the stars
explode in space.</p>
<p>“How… How… How is that possible?” The eyeless beast was shocked
and screamed. Fortunately, he had no eyes. If he had, his eyes
would have popped out.</p>
<p>The eyeless big beast knew full-well how strong Old Vulture was.
He was no worse than the phoenix or the ghost car. He was as good
as a true god could be.</p>
<p>Even though Han Sen had become true god class, he had only just
become true god class. The pure power fight was not balanced. Now,
he had released one punch and suppressed Old Vulture. On top of
that, he had shattered Old Vulture’s talons. How scary was that
power?</p>
<p>The demon lady could not believe this either. One punch broke
the fish bird’s talons. In that universe, that kind of god power
was probably only something Sacred Leader could showcase.</p>
<p>“I thought you wanted to fight! Now, let us fight!” Han Sen’s
body flashed. He teleported above the eyeless big beast, waving his
fist and punching toward it.</p>
<p>The eyeless big beast roared. Its body clenched together, which
made its back sprout bones that were serrated. They spun quickly
like a chainsaw. They were headed for Han Sen’s fist.</p>
<p>Katcha-cha!</p>
<p>The chainsaw-like bones were broken into many pieces. The shell
on the eyeless big beast’s back was punched away by Han Sen. It
created a giant blood hole. The blood water was like a volcanic
eruption. Its body flew away.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? So strong…” The demon lady could not
believe her own eyes. With that kind of fitness or power, she was
only afraid a holy body becoming true god class could do that. Han
Sen was a creature that had not practiced a holy body, yet his body
had reached this level. It was hard to believe.</p>
<p>“I thought you wanted the holy spirit?” Han Sen’s voice was in
the demon lady’s ear. He was right in front of her. His scary fist
was in front of the demon lady.</p>
<p>“Beautiful Woman Charming Demon Heart Body!” The demon lady’s
body suddenly changed. All her clothes ripped to reveal the
splendor of her body.</p>
<p>It was perfect. It could steal a soul. Auntie Mei’s entire body
released some presence that no creature could resist. Even the sky,
gods, and buddhas would have fallen for her. They would have killed
themselves nine times for her.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen still punched her beautiful chest. His fist went right
through it. Flesh, red blood, and snow-white skin contrasted to
create a weird, scary, and beautiful scene.</p>
