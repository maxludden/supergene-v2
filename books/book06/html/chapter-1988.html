<p>Yun Suyi saw Han Sen stand up, then teleport behind the Blood
God Mantis. The purple knifelight slashed, and the Blood God
Mantis’ triangle head looked as if it had been chomped on by a
demon. The knifelight cut through it, and the body fell from the
sky.</p>
<p>The blood reaper instantly shattered and disappeared into thin
air.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Earl mutant hunted. Blood God Mantis: xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t get its beast soul?” Han Sen’s thoughts were painted
with greed.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi looked at Han Sen strangely. He had one-hit-killed an
Earl mutant xenogeneic. That was a far stronger feat than Thousand
Feather Crane could accomplish.</p>
<p>But seeing Han Sen’s strength, Yun Suyi felt even worse. She
thought to herself, “Why is he taken?”</p>
<p>Han Sen dug the mutant gene out of the Blood God Mantis. It was
a piece of its shell. There were still some wisps of smoke rising
from the bloody piece of crystal. You could tell that it was the
face of the red reaper.</p>
<p>“Earl genes insufficient. Cannot refine mutant gene.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked when hearing this. It was an Earl mutant
gene. He had been able to refine the ant queen’s gene when his
total tally was a few points less. Now, he had two more genes than
before, and yet he couldn’t refine the Blood God Mantis’ gene. He
pondered how the requirements for Earl genes were determined.</p>
<p>Han Sen put away Blood God Mantis’ mutant gene and passed the
body to his legless crane. Bringing Yun Suyi along with him, Han
Sen proceeded to hunt xenogeneics on Old Night Island. He was only
planning on going back when White Jade Jing opened again. After
that, the exam was set to start.</p>
<p>Inside Buddha Kingdom, Clear Sea King bowed before Burning Lamp
Alpha. “Alpha, Han Sen broke the ant’s body curse. He is now
practicing in Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>Burning Lamp Alpha said casually, “Knife Queen must have asked
the leader of Sky Palace to break my looping skill.” “We’re going
to let him get off scot-free?” Clear Sea King asked, looking
crushed.</p>
<p>“The Buddha cannot engage in acts that disrupt Sky Palace, for
the time being. If he is in Sky Palace, we will have to ignore
him.” Burning Lamp Alpha looked like he knew this was going to
happen, as he didn’t show too much concern.</p>
<p>But…” Clear Sea King wished to say something more, but he was
interrupted by Burning Lamp Alpha.</p>
<p>“First Day is practicing in Sky Palace. How is he doing?”
Burning Lamp Alpha asked.</p>
<p>“He will be a Marquise soon,” Clear Sea King answered.</p>
<p>“Good. First Day isn’t as talented as Seven Spirit or
Speechless, but he can match them in strength. Through his practice
in Sky Palace, and a roster of talents that marry the best of two
races, he might have a higher chance of becoming deified than Seven
Spirit did. We cannot allow this opportunity to escape our grasp,”
Burning Lamp said.</p>
<p>“Now that Han Sen is in Sky Palace, will he…” Clear Sea King was
worried.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp said coldly, “Sky Palace has taken in Han Sen. They
have also taken in First Day. There is no need to worry for First
Day’s safety. Don’t do anything until Han Sen leaves Sky Palace.
And don’t contact First Day. Wait until he is done in Sky Palace,
too.”</p>
<p>Not long after, the day came again when White Jade Jing would
open. Han Sen and Yun Suyi returned from Old Night Island. In that
time, Han Sen had managed to hunt eleven Earl xenogeneics. But
since Yun Suyi was with him, he hadn’t wanted to eat the xenogeneic
genes in front of her. So, he brought everything back.</p>
<p>When the Jade Air in White Jade Jing came to an end, Han Sen
brought the xenogeneic genes back to Jade Island.</p>
<p>“Yun Suyi, follow me home,” Yun Sushang called to her
sister.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi glanced at Yun Sushang, looking all moody, and said,
“Don’t worry, sis. I’m going home.”</p>
<p>Yun Sushang was shocked. She noticed there was something amiss
with Yu Suyi’s attitude. With worry, she asked, “What’s going on?
Has Han Sen been mistreating you?”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi shook her head and sighed. They were not real sisters,
but their relationship was just as close as two blood relatives.
They talked about everything, so she told Yun Sushang the things
she had learned about Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I see. This is good, though. You are of the Sky, and you are a
daughter of an elder. You cannot be with an outsider. By ending it
now, you’re only saving yourself from greater suffering in the
future.” Yun Sushang felt relief when she heard what was troubling
Yun Suyi. So, she comforted her and said, “Han Sen is smart, but he
is not the only one out there for you. There are other geniuses
like him, amongst the Sky. I will find you someone, and you can
decide.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi wasn’t in the mood for jokes, and she was feeling very
sad. She forced a smile and went home.</p>
<p>Because the next day was the exam, and Han Sen was in a rush, he
didn’t have the time to eat slowly. After he cooked all his stuff
in one pot, he used Consume to digest every xenogeneic material as
fast as he could.</p>
<p>His body felt hot, cold, and sore, all at the same time. He felt
as if he had been electrified, and some power flowed through his
body. It made him feel stronger.</p>
<p>The gene increase announcement played in his head, over and
over. He had an extra eleven Earl genes, now. Counting the two from
before, he now had forty in total.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen picked up the Blood God Mantis’ mutant gene,
the announcement still declared he did not have a sufficient number
of Earl genes.</p>
<p>“Blood God Mantis1 gene has a much higher requirement than the
ant queen gene, but now I don’t have any more time to hunt
xenogeneics.” Han Sen put away the Blood God Mantis’ mutant gene.
He sat on his jade bed to practice Jadeskin.</p>
<p>Although it was not as fast as practicing in the White Jade
Building, having a little was better than nothing.</p>
<p>The next morning, when Han Sen was about to set off toward the
exam location, Yu Jing came to him. He rode over on a Jade Night
Crane.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, there is something I seek to discuss with you.” Yu
Jing spoke quickly, upon his arrival on the island. “What is it?”
Han Sen looked at Yu Jing.</p>
<p>Yu Jing lowered his voice and said, “The first opponent you face
today, he hopes he can proceed through the exam. So, he paid a high
price, hoping you might let him go on.”</p>
<p>Yu Jing didn’t say it directly, but he meant that the opponent
had paid money for Han Sen to throw the fight.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I can’t help him,” Han Sen said simply.</p>
<p>Yu Jing quickly said, “Brother Han, you do know that your sixth
enemy is Lone Bamboo, yes? It is difficult to determine whether or
not you’ll win. It would be better to take this benefit now, while
you can.”</p>
<p>When Yu Jing said that it was difficult to determine who would
win, he really meant that Han Sen would most likely lose. And if
Han Sen lost, all Yu Jing’s money would be lost. Right now, he was
only concerned with losing as little as possible.</p>
<p>“My purpose is to get to first place. I don’t care about
anything else.” After Han Sen said that, he mounted the legless
crane. He flew straight towards Sky Path Island, where the exams
would be held.</p>
<p>Yu Jing was shocked. He was frozen in place for a while.</p>
<p>After a while, he snapped out of his daze. He spoke to himself
miserably, saying, “I hope you can reach first place, too. But how
are you going to beat Lone Bamboo?”</p>
