<h2>Soothing the Knife River</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1830</h3>

<p>“Why have they still not returned?” someone asked from the
entrance to the tunnel.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King had arrived before the space tunnel, and he was
waiting for his son.</p>
<p>When Black-Moon King was young, he himself had entered the space
tunnel. He knew how difficult the hardships were on the other side.
Right now, those beyond ought to have been on the twelfth round of
rain. Since Black Steel hadn’t come out yet, there were only two
possibilities.</p>
<p>The first option was that Black Steel was incredibly lucky, and
he had found an incredible opportunity. The second option was that
he was dead.</p>
<p>In the past, Barons had only managed to reach the eleventh
stage; that was the height of their power. No one had ever
successfully made it through the twelfth.</p>
<p>There was once a son of a king who was so ambitious, he stole a
Duke’s armor and took it to Knife Grave. He wanted to see how many
rounds the knife rain would ultimately last.</p>
<p>But on the twelfth round, the young man came stumbling out with
the Duke’s armor mostly in tatters.</p>
<p>When he was questioned, the Baron told his father that on the
twelfth round, the knives came down like an endless stream. Even
his Duke armor quickly broke down under the strain.</p>
<p>The Baron had managed to escape right before the Duke armor was
entirely broken. If he hadn’t gotten out in time, he would have
been killed.</p>
<p>That was why Barons never attempted to take Duke armors with
them. That young man’s tale told everyone just how scary and
powerful the knife rains could become.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King had already been waiting much longer than he had
expected, but Black Steel was still inside. That was his only son,
and he was incredibly worried. He stared at the black hole-like
vortex. He was surrounded by many other Nobles, eager to see the
final result.</p>
<p>His hands clenched into a pair of fists, as his own nails dug
into his skin. He was never this nervous, not even when he was
fighting someone.</p>
<p>Yisha was not in front of the tunnel, but she still frowned and
stared toward the entrance.</p>
<p>On the Knife Grave planet, the knife river came down like a
tsunami from the sky. It felt as if it was going to cut the entire
planet in half.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Black Steel’s faces changed. They felt awful. They
did not have Duke armor, and neither did they have an escape
route.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the knife river was practically above their heads.</p>
<p>Black Steel lobbed his horse knife and took Han Sen’s Duke
knife. Holding two knives, he jumped at the mass of the river and
yelled, “Run!”</p>
<p>The knives came at the river like a whirlwind, tearing apart the
skies. Black Steel managed to cut the knife river in half.</p>
<p>It was only for a second, though, and the knife river swiftly
managed to bridge and refill the divide.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>With the impact he brought against the knife river, Black
Steel’s Earl weapon was broken against the tide. His hand bled, as
a result His other hand, that was clutching the Duke knife, now had
a few crevices running across it</p>
<p>The impact with the knife river was too strong. The Duke knife
was pushed to the side. The knives rushed by Black Steel like
water.</p>
<p>Black Steel looked at the knife river and his eyes moved. He
realized he would die this time, and there was no way out for him.
Seeing endless knives line up together, so close to his body, it
would only take a second for them to chop and dice him into
pieces.</p>
<p>But the knives suddenly stopped, and they froze where they were
in the air. They hung there, motionless, blanketing the sky. The
knives were almost into his flesh and his eyes, but the spectacle
had all suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Sha! Sha!</p>
<p>Suddenly, it was like time began running backwards. The knives
reversed course. They moved 100 meters away before coming to a
stop.</p>
<p>The weapons started to spin, and so too did the ones on the
ground,</p>
<p>Countless weapons were spinning like tornados. They were
everywhere, and Black Steel couldn’t even have guessed how many
there were.</p>
<p>As the weapons spun, they also began to tremble. It seemed
almost like they were afraid of something.</p>
<p>Black Steel slowly turned around and looked at Han Sen. Han
Sen’s clothes were waving as he cast his knifemind. He looked like
a beast that was on the verge of ripping the galaxy apart</p>
<p>“How is that possible?” Black Steel looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen possessed a knifemind that was greater than that of
Black Steel’s father, Black-Moon King. Even Knife Queen was likely
inferior to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen now had Black Steel’s horse knife. He had planned to use
his knifemind and Centaur shield so they could think about what
they might do to escape the space tunnel.</p>
<p>The effects of using the knifemind were more surprising than
anticipated, however. It looked as if the knives felt his
knifemind, and they sought to back-off. Han Sen no longer needed to
summon his shield anymore.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knifemind came from the scabbard. The scabbard’s
knifemind originated with the Rebate; their only deified elite. Han
Sen’s power was far worse, of course. But even so, his knifemind
was deified in caliber. Although it wasn’t as good as the real
thing, it was still good.</p>
<p>The knives weren’t creatures, but when they felt the knifemind,
they were shocked. That was why they were shaking, and unable to
leave.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a knife fell from the sky and hit the ground. It
almost landed on Han Sen’s head.</p>
<p>Han Sen fell back and dodged it.</p>
<p>He looked down and saw the knife that was now protruding from a
rock. The scabbard and the handle were all rusted, and there was no
handguard at all. It looked like a steel rod that was just a little
bit curved.</p>
<p>“Weird. All these knives are scared of the knifemind. So, why
did this one decide to come down?” Han Sen thought to himself. He
knelt by the knife, grabbed it by the handle, and tried to pull it
from the rock.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to remove it from the rock and see what might
have been special about it, but it didn’t budge. He tried yanking
it a few times, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>“Little Black, why can I not pull this out?” Han Sen asked over
his shoulder, just as the knife jerked out of the ground. He tossed
it to Black Steel for inspection.</p>
<p>Han Sen put away his knifemind. The weapons then seemed to lose
all support, and they all fell to the ground. Within the proximity
of a hundred meters, weapons were everywhere.</p>
<p>Black Steel looked at Han Sen strangely, then he looked at the
knife in his hands. Then he threw it back to Han Sen, saying, “This
is not a long knife with a scabbard. It is a knife’s child or a
knife stick. It isn’t a knife yet. It’s half finished.”</p>
