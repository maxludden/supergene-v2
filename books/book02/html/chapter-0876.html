    <p>
      &#8220;Perhaps it is because I am not a wretched man who has committed
      several atrocities?&#8221; Han Sen coldly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8230;&#8221; Lui Gui was quickly infuriated by the response he
      was given. He pointed his finger towards Han Sen and barked, &#8220;You
      must have done something!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fine, I admit it. I made the lightning keep striking you. You
      weren&#8217;t just unlucky, okay? It was me. Are you satisfied?&#8221; Han
      Sen shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lui Gui didn&#8217;t know what to say. The thunder came from the sky, and
      Han Sen clearly didn&#8217;t produce the lightning. Therefore, he
      didn&#8217;t believe it was Han Sen and couldn&#8217;t outright blame the
      man for doing what he had truthfully admitted to doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Han, you have misunderstood his meaning! We are wondering if
      you have a way of preventing the lightning from striking you. Perhaps if
      you share your method, we could avoid being struck as well. We might
      finish this adventure a little faster, too,&#8221; Zhao Xuebin said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am a giver, not a receiver. So, believe me when I say I would be
      willing to share a method, if I had one. I truthfully haven&#8217;t a clue
      why the lightning hasn&#8217;t struck me or my lovelies,&#8221; Han Sen
      responded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin frowned, thinking it highly unlikely for Han Sen to try to
      trick them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if Han Sen really was simply lucky, that amount of luck seemed
      impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You must have a beast soul to protect you from the lightning, is
      that it?!&#8221; Lui Gui re-joined the conversation with a raised finger
      and voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wow, how rude. With such a disrespectful tone, I do not believe
      there is anything I can do for you,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, if you don&#8217;t have such a beast soul, how about you slow
      down and dismount, so we can all walk together?&#8221; Lui Gui firmly
      believed he had discovered the truth, and so he shouted out the
      suggestion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin looked at Han Sen, wondering what his response would be. Han
      Sen said, &#8220;Um, okay. Sure. That&#8217;s fine by me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone put away their mounts and surrounded Han Sen like penguins. If
      Han Sen did have a beast soul to protect him from the thunder, they
      believed they ought to have been close enough for its protection to extend
      to them, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two steps later, lightning struck Lui Gui&#8217;s head again. He fell on
      the ground like a sack of rocks. From the strength of the bolt that hit
      him, it seemed far more severe than the earlier strikes.
    </p>

    <p>The silver fox, in Zero&#8217;s arms, bore a sinister grin.</p>

    <p>
      Everyone looked at Han Sen with a queer expression, and just as Lui Gui
      was pulling himself back up, another person was struck by a thunderbolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they continued their ascent of the mountain, the thunder became worse.
      They were still three miles from the peak, and the lightning was already
      injuring the elites and making them too weary to go on.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I do not believe this bullshit!&#8221; Lui Gui kept on walking,
      unable to believe that the thunder could not hit Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the lightning kept striking the team, and most of them were injured.
      Han Sen and Zero hadn&#8217;t suffered a single singed hair, by
      comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen had protection, Zero should have been susceptible to the
      lightning strikes, too. But she hadn&#8217;t been dealt any harm, and the
      lightning never touched her. The lightning only ever struck the Angel Gene
      members; it was very odd.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It must be you! Aaargh!&#8221; Lui Gui was incredibly mad, and just
      as he turned to bark at Han Sen and start pointing more fingers, a bolt of
      lightning struck his head. His helmet was blown off and his face turned
      black. He dropped to the ground again, but this time, he did not move. He
      had passed out, and he almost looked as if he was going to die.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I told you. If you are unlucky, it is likely karma. If you do bad
      things, bad things will happen to you. In this case, you&#8217;ll be
      struck by lightning.&#8221; Han Sen coldly spoke down to Lui Gui, who was
      on the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Han, can you please tell us why the thunder only attacks us?
      Don&#8217;t tell me you are simply lucky; luck of that breadth does not
      exist.&#8221; Zhao Xuebin was starting to lose his patience now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other people angrily stared at Han Sen, muttering mean words beneath
      their breath.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What? You guys seriously want to fight me? If you do, come get
      some,&#8221; Han Sen coldly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin&#8217;s people were all shocked. Although they all had Angel
      Gene Fluid, they had all been severely injured by the repeated lightning
      strikes. Fighting Han Sen, who had a super pet, would be difficult to say
      the least.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin did not want to use the liquid until the last second, so his
      face suddenly changed. With a forced smile he said, &#8220;Mister Han, you
      have misunderstood us once again. I was merely stating it has been an
      unlikely string of coincidences that have left you uncharred by the
      lightning strikes. But we are partners for the time being, and partners
      must exercise completely honesty with each other.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fine. Do you really want to know why the thunder won&#8217;t touch
      me?&#8221; Han Sen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, please tell us!&#8221; Zhao Xuebin politely exclaimed.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not answer verbally. He looked up and saw another thunderbolt,
      and as it descended, he threw his fist up high. Lightning came out from
      his fist and impacted the incoming bolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      The explosion that came as a result knocked everyone down onto the ground.
      They all looked pale, and many of them started heaving blood. They all
      looked upon Han Sen with shock, as if he was some god.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They dare believe they can strike me?&#8221; Han Sen said, and then
      ignored them, continuing his ascent of the mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people looked on in disbelief. They quickly scrambled to their feet
      and followed Han Sen up to the peak as if they were his disciples. No
      longer did anyone think about using Angel Gene Fluid to combat him.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a punch to sunder fires born on the wind was incredible, and they had
      clearly underestimated Han Sen&#8217;s power. No matter how much Angel
      Gene Fluid they injected into themselves, they did not believe they had
      what it took to take down Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The area that surrounded them was still getting battered by lightning, and
      fighting a person who commanded such lightning would be a fool&#8217;s
      errand. They knew they wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How can Sonic-Thunder Punch be that powerful? It&#8217;s stronger
      than what most surpassers can do,&#8221; Feng Lin stated, shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen defeating Yu Qieland was not simply down to luck. His
      Sonic-Thunder Punch really is that scary,&#8221; Zhao Xuebin said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What do we do? Do we just keep going?&#8221; Feng Lin had lost his
      nerve and was prepared to escape, and he was not alone in that thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      They knew they weren&#8217;t half as strong as Han Sen, so they did not
      dare continue forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin sighed and said, &#8220;Fine. We&#8217;ll wait here. If the
      Thunderbull is on the peak, Han Sen won&#8217;t be able to hide his
      killing of it, anyway. He can most likely do it solo.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      When everyone heard they would not have to reach the top to fight a super
      creature, they were washed with relief. They carried the dying Lui Gui
      away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the silver fox&#8217;s protection, Han Sen and Zero had almost
      reached the top without trouble. Then, he saw something.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a super creature, and it isn&#8217;t alone.&#8221; Han
      Sen, seeing the peak ahead, looked surprised.
