<h3>Chapter 2563</h3>

<p>Two demon crocodiles appeared at the same time. Han Sen
teleported over to the one that was farther from him. He gave the
closer one to Exquisite, as he didn’t want to steal the kill from
her.</p>
<p>Gravity was strong there. Even teleportation happened slowly
beneath that level of pressure. When Han Sen teleported near the
demon crocodile, Exquisite had already killed the creature.</p>
<p>Exquisite looked at Han Sen and then teleported again. She
appeared in front of Han Sen, cutting the other demon crocodile in
half as well.</p>
<p>These crocodiles were just second or third-tier Kings, but they
lived in an environment with strong gravity. Their bodies were
incredibly dense and hard. It was scary to see Exquisite kill one
in a mere second.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was no longer focused on Exquisite’s skills. If they
had been engaging in a simple competition before, things had now
gone beyond that. This was straight-up thievery.</p>
<p>“Lady Exquisite, do you have to be in such a rush?” Han Sen
said, looking at her.</p>
<p>“If I can earn more by putting in more work, why wouldn’t I do
my best?” Exquisite asked coolly. There was no emotion in her
voice. She spoke as if this was something that she did every
day.</p>
<p>“You are right. People should do all they can.” Han Sen looked
at Exquisite and nodded.</p>
<p>Li Keer hastily tried to repair the atmosphere of the group, and
so she said, “Please do not mind her behavior, Dollar. Third Sister
is always like this. She doesn’t hate you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “Lady Exquisite is right. Trying your
best is the right thing to do. I need to learn from her.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere was awkward, to say the least. Li Keer didn’t
know what to say now. The three of them continued to travel
forward. The planet was very large. They had to slog forward under
the weight of its gravity. After flying for an hour, they spotted
another demon crocodile.</p>
<p>As soon as the creature came into view, Han Sen and Exquisite
were gone. Exquisite wanted to make sure that she didn’t let Han
Sen kill a single demon crocodile. She was going to get every
one.</p>
<p>Li Keer felt glum. She didn’t want to test Han Sen this way, but
if this was how Exquisite wanted to do things, she had no choice
but to accept it. After all, she was low-ranking in the Very High.
She had no authority over Third Sister Exquisite.</p>
<p>“If this keeps going, Dollar will get angry,” Li Keer thought to
herself. She didn’t know what she could do to make their
relationship better.</p>
<p>While she was thinking, Li Keer saw the demon crocodile’s skull
crumble. In a split second, its metallic head was reduced to
sand.</p>
<p>Li Keer was surprised. The creature hadn’t died by Exquisite’s
space cutting skill; that was the geno art called Big
Destroyed.</p>
<p>Exquisite knew many geno arts, but not even she knew Big
Destroyed. The geno art couldn’t be learned unless someone had the
body of a Destroyed. Although there were some members of the Very
High that had been fortunate enough to study Big Destroyed, the
numbers of such people were few. And they had a great deal of
difficulty becoming proficient with the skill. Exquisite had never
bothered with it.</p>
<p>Li Keer took a closer look. It wasn’t Exquisite that had broken
the crocodile’s head. It was Han Sen. She was surprised, and she
murmured to herself, “He really did learn Big Destroyed.”</p>
<p>When Li Keer had seen Han Sen receive Big Destroyed in trade,
she had thought Han Sen was being an idiot. She believed it would
be impossible for him to learn it. However, in such a short amount
of time, Han Sen had become proficient with the skill. And on top
of that, he could use it in battle now. It was scarcely
believable.</p>
<p>“Is this guy that talented?” Li Keer looked at Han Sen with
shock.</p>
<p>Before, Han Sen had easily learned God’s Wander. When he did, Li
Keer was very surprised. Now, he was showing off Big Destroyed.</p>
<p>The most unbelievable thing about it all was that Han Sen had
managed to kill the demon crocodile before Exquisite could. Li Keer
couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Li Keer didn’t think there was any way that Dollar’s
teleportation ability could be superior to Exquisite’s. Dollar had
only just learned God’s Wander, after all.</p>
<p>“How can he be faster than Third Sister?” Li Keer looked at
Exquisite. Exquisite was staring at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Exquisite’s face was expressionless, but she was shocked on the
inside. She was thinking as hard as she could, trying to figure out
how Han Sen was faster than her. It should have been
impossible.</p>
<p>“Lady Exquisite, I’m sorry.” Han Sen laughed and dug out the
demon crocodile’s xenogeneic gene.</p>
<p>“You got it with your power. There is no need to apologize,”
Exquisite responded in a level tone. Then, she resumed her
flight.</p>
<p>Exquisite thought she must have underestimated Dollar. Because
of that, she must not have tried her best. “This is good. It is
great that I can force him to reveal his true power.”</p>
<p>But Exquisite formulated a plan to keep Han Sen from securing
any other kills after this.</p>
<p>“Dollar, you really managed to learn Big Destroyed?” Li Keer
flew over to Han Sen and tried to chat with him.</p>
<p>“I got lucky. I’ve only just learned it,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Are all humans so talented? Why have I never heard of this race
before?” Li Keer and Han Sen started to chat.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Li Keer were talking, but Han Sen kept his eyes
peeled for crocodiles. Li Keer was a little distracting, and
Exquisite wasn’t talking. All of her focus was placed on her
surroundings. She was going to make sure she killed any creatures
that appeared before Dollar could get to them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a demon crocodile appeared in front of Exquisite.
Exquisite used God’s Wander to teleport over to it. But when she
appeared in front of that demon crocodile, the crocodile’s head had
already been crushed. Han Sen was standing right next to her,
chuckling.</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite were both frozen. When this happened the
first time, they could convince themselves that it had been a fluke
or a mistake. This time, however, they couldn’t deny that Exquisite
had simply lost.</p>
<p>This time, Exquisite had tried her best to reach the demon
crocodile first, but she had lost to Dollar again. And on top of
that, he’d been in the middle of a conversation with Li Keer.</p>
<p>Exquisite let her eyes linger on Han Sen for some time. Then,
she looked back at Li Keer and asked, “Is he using God’s
Wander?”</p>
<p>Exquisite could tell that Han Sen was using God’s Wander, but
there was no way Han Sen’s God’s Wander was better than hers. Her
experience with God’s Wander should have been far greater than Han
Sen’s. She shouldn’t have lost to him.</p>
<p>“That must be God’s Wander, right?” Li Keer wasn’t sure anymore,
either. She knew that if Dollar was using God’s Wander, he couldn’t
be any faster than Exquisite. But somehow, he was.</p>
<p>“Next time, take a closer look and observe. See if he is truly
using God’s Wander,” Exquisite instructed.</p>
<p>The three of them kept on traveling. When they saw another demon
crocodile, Exquisite focused her mind beyond what she thought was
possible. But even so, she was still slower than Han Sen.</p>
<p>This time, Li Keer and Exquisite were able to confirm that Han
Sen was indeed using God’s Wander. But he should have been no
better than a beginner with God’s Wander. He should have been far
slower than Exquisite.</p>
<p>But this beginner level of God’s Wander was faster than
Exquisite’s advanced techniques. Exquisite couldn’t believe this
truth, but as they continued to move forward, she was no longer
able to collect any more spoils from the demon crocodiles. The next
seven demon crocodiles were stolen by Han Sen.</p>
