	<p>“Let’s see how many attacks you can block,” Sleepless Duke shouted. The other Night Ghosts began to cackle,
		gathering up a force of ghost air.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had raised a single shield against an entire army. Sleepless Duke thought he must have a death wish.</p>

	<p>When the three defenders had been actively fighting, the Dukes and Marquises were unable to gather up power.
		There was too much danger that their attacks would hit other Night Ghosts, so they intentionally weakened their
		attacks.</p>

	<p>But now, the three of them had made themselves into an incredibly tempting target. The Night Ghosts gathered up
		all the power they had, then focused on a single part of the shield. Not even strong creatures could withstand
		the strength of what was coming.</p>

	<p>Sleepless Duke had a plan. She needed to take Han Sen and Lone Bamboo as hostages. If she did that, she’d have an
		even easier time getting through Sky Palace’s defenses.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were important to Sky Palace. They wouldn’t be sacrificed easily.</p>

	<p>The roiling mass of ghost air covered the sky now, and it was trying to consume the blue light. It was like the
		world was about to be consumed.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>When the ghost air landed, the entire base was annihilated. The construct was practically vaporized.</p>

	<p>A thousand Dukes and ten thousand Marquises were attacking simultaneously. The area was brought to ruin, and the
		power continued down into the ground, creating a substantial crater.</p>

	<p>Under a scary power such as that, even a Duke would have been blown to bits.</p>

	<p>When the dust settled, Sleepless Duke and the Night Ghosts could only stare. Kahn’s eyes were full of surprise.
	</p>

	<p>A blue translucent shield sat on the ground, appearing unblemished. Han Sen and the other two stood inside,
		uninjured by the attack. It was hard to believe that such a frightening amount of power could descend upon that
		simple shield and leave it undamaged.</p>

	<p>“Is that all the power the Night Ghosts have?” Han Sen asked casually.</p>

	<p>“Let’s see how well you can block this,” Sleepless Duke screamed. The Night Ghosts gathered up another enormous
		mass of ghost air. They became angry ghosts that descended on the blue shield.</p>

	<p>Countless ghost airs slammed repeatedly into the blue shield. Even the nearby mountains were shattered by these
		attacks.</p>

	<p>But the blue shield did not even shudder or shake. Even the ghost airs that could destroy mountains were reduced
		to a firework-sparkle against it.</p>

	<p>Sleepless Duke kept on screaming. Thousands of Night Ghosts kept attacking from all angles, but still, they could
		not undo the blue shield.</p>

	<p>Han Sen floated in the shield, while Lone Bamboo had sat down for a bit of rest. The man was in the middle of
		healing himself.</p>

	<p>Sleepless Duke’s face was white with fury, and she was unable to fathom what sort of treasure Han Sen had brought
		with him. It could block each and every attack that was thrown at it.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s treasure wouldn’t actually cost him his power, either. If it did, he would have reacted in some way
		when the Night Ghosts attacked him.</p>

	<p>You guys can continue.” Han Sen looked entirely unconcerned. It was as if nothing was going on. Han Sen stood up
		and stretched, and then he began walking up into the air. It looked as if he was going to walk off the planet,
		right into space.</p>

	<p>The blue shield around Han Sen was like a godlight. It continued to encase Han Sen, unwavering in the slightest.
	</p>

	<p>“Kill him!” Sleepless Duke’s scream became a roar.</p>

	<p>Countless Night Ghosts tried to attack Han Sen, and ghost airs hit the blue shield continuously. Some Night
		Ghosts used knives, and some used claws or even hammers to attack.</p>

	<p>But even so, the attacks were still useless. They couldn’t prevent Han Sen from walking off into space. The
		attacks against the blue shield were like nothing at all. They couldn’t even make the shielding orb shake.</p>

	<p>Sleepless Duke had bared her teeth in a grimace as she tried her hardest to attack the blue shield. Her fingers
		started to bleed, but even so, she was still unable to bring it down.</p>

	<p>She felt scared. Powerless. And most of all, she felt hopeless. She knew what would happen if Han Sen and Lone
		Bamboo were able to escape; it would be a disaster for the Night Ghosts. But they couldn’t do anything against
		the blue shield. They were hopeless.</p>

	<p>“Sleepless Duke! There is one more thing we can do.” Kahn’s voice rang through Sleepless Duke’s ears.</p>

	<p>“Tell me! How can I kill them?” Sleepless Duke turned to him frantically, looking like she was clutching a
		lifeline.</p>

	<p>Kahn waved his hand, and a spear with a red-pattern appeared in his palm.</p>

	<p>Kahn threw it to Sleepless Duke and said, “This is a treasure of a King-class Demon. It is called a Blood Demon
		Spear. With its power, it should be able to break Han Sen’s shield.</p>

	<p>Sleepless Duke frowned. “We don’t have a King class elite to wield it. If I use it, I cannot make use of all of
		its power.”</p>

	<p>Kahn smiled. “That is what is so amazing about this spear. It does not require its wielder to be King-class. It
		can use its max power regardless. If this wasn’t the case, I wouldn’t have told you it could break that shield.
	</p>

	<p>“Really?” Sleepless Duke lifted the Blood Demon Spear and felt a savage grin pull at her mouth.</p>

	<p>But when Sleepless Duke put her power into the spear, the throw wasn’t that strong. It was far from the
		effectiveness of a King, and from what she could tell, it was only a little better than Duke level.</p>

	<p>“Kahn, are you lying to me?” Sleepless Duke looked at Kahn angrily.</p>

	<p>Kahn shook his head. “Sleepless Duke, you are the leader of the Night Ghosts. How can you be so naive? There is
		no power without effort. The Blood Demon Spear might not require you to be a King to use it, but it has its own
		terms to adhere to.”</p>

	<p>“What are these conditions?” Sleepless Duke asked quickly.</p>

	<p>“Sacrifice blood to the spear. The higher quality the blood and the more you offer, the stronger it becomes. If
		the^^ enough blood, it is not too difficult to muster a King class attack,” Kahn said.</p>

	<p>“Blood? From where?” Sleepless Duke suddenly froze. She knew exactly what he meant. The only blood she could
		sacrifice was from the Night Ghosts.</p>

	<p>“No! No way!” Sleepless Duke gnashed her teeth.</p>

	<p>“Do you have a choice right now? And besides, you only have to sacrifice a few of your people to kill them. Do
		that, and you can save the majority of your people from Sky Palace’s wrath. Otherwise, if Han Sen escapes this
		planet, death is all that awaits the Night Ghosts. You know how Sky Palace treats traitors,” Kahn said grimly.
	</p>

	<p>Sleepless Duke clutched the Blood Demon Spear. Looking at the blue shield moving further and further away, her
		face kept cycling through emotions.</p>
