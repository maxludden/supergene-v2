    <p>
      Han Sen put a drop of his blood on the Western King Sword. The blood
      didn’t spread and blend into the metal, however, and it just remained a
      droplet upon the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t believe this isn’t working!” Han Sen cut his wrist and bled some
      more of his Real Blood over the sword, and went at it until it was
      entirely painted red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after rubbing it in, it didn’t work. Han Sen put the Western King
      Sword aside, hoping the Real Blood would do something in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was a will there was a way, and Han Sen wasn’t keen on giving up
      just yet. That was one of the four crystal king armors, and he didn’t
      think there’d be a fifth in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Stay Up Late, whether someone was qualified was determined by
      the geno armor they generated. But the difference between the average geno
      armor and the special geno armors was something Stay Up Late couldn’t
      accurately define. Fitness was not an accurate measurement, and it wasn’t
      that you simply reached a certain fitness and were then able to generate a
      special armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eastern King, of the four kings, had a fitness that was not all that
      excellent during his earlier years. He was like an average crystallizer,
      and yet, he went on to generate one of those special geno armors.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the crystallizer observer’s task was to watch their creatures grow and
      learn how they might go on to generate the special geno armors. But before
      they could find another special one like those, the race was destroyed and
      brought to ruin. Even the crystallizers did not know if a qualified one
      currently existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen went to practice The Story of Genes. He progressed quickly, and it
      was like he was learning new skills every single day. And through that,
      his fitness was rising. Even so, it would still take a long time for him
      to recover the demigod strength he had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the sanctuary again, Han Sen appeared right where he should have
      been. Xie Qing King was still there, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Nine-Life Cat had told him his blood would not restrict him
      from entering any sanctuary, he didn’t really know how to get to any of
      the others, as of yet. For the time being, he was stuck in the Fourth
      God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was worried about the officer appearing, though, so he wouldn’t
      stay there for long. He had a chat with Xie Qing King, and the spirit
      asked Han Sen to take his latest issue of the comic. He wanted it
      uploaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s life had been quiet for a while now. After the last fight, the
      officer and God’s Organization seemed to have been dealt with. He didn’t
      hear anything about their movements anymore, and there was no news
      regarding potential operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was a legend in the Alliance, but it was fortunate he was not one
      to revel in the limelight and fame of such stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      And truth be told, he could control the entire Alliance by force, if he so
      wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though he didn’t do this just yet, Han Sen’s power was still sending
      ripples across the Alliance. The Ji family grew more quickly and steadily.
      They were no longer given any trouble. Some said it was because of their
      strong ties with others, but those associations paled in comparison to the
      influence of Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next election, Ji Ruozhen was planning on running for the
      presidency again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the other families that had ties with Han Sen also benefitted.
      Even if Han Sen didn’t want to play any role or part in the politics of
      the government, his mere existence was influencing things. It didn’t mean
      much to him, though. Controlling the whole Alliance through bureaucracy
      wasn’t even remotely interesting to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civilizations like the crystallizers were destroyed easily. Humans would
      fall even swifter if similar forces came against them. The officer was an
      enemy, yes, but what he said was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed, and Littleflower was three years old. Han Sen wished to send
      him to a kindergarten, but he was afraid that God’s Organization might
      come and bring Littleflower harm if he was out there without Han Sen’s
      supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a lengthy discussion with the family, they decided on having
      Littleflower study at a kindergarten on Roca. Han Sen could protect him
      there, and Littleflower would be able to socialize with ordinary folk of
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen decided to buy half of the planet, too. Littleflower’s
      kindergarten was located on the side that he did not own, though.
      Traveling would take some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late volunteered to take Littleflower to school every day and
      bring him home. He worked harder than Ji Yanran and Han Sen, that was for
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frequently said Littleflower was special, and there was a chance he
      could be qualified. His potential was even greater than Han Sen’s. So, he
      spent a lot of his time observing Littleflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      That made Han Sen feel safer. If the officer was planning on taking
      Littleflower, and Han Sen was late to the rescue, Stay Up Late could
      definitely keep the child protected for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After soaking the Western King Sword in blood for a whole year, a reaction
      was finally achieved. It wasn’t falling under Real Blood’s control, but
      the sword’s own will was finally returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even with the will coming back, it wasn’t quite like the glove and the
      shoes. It was easy to trigger the Western King Sword’s power, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen decided to give it to Stay Up Late. Han Sen would need someone to
      fight if the officer showed up again, and Han Sen himself wasn’t around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Littleflower was a popular kid in school. There, though, aside from the
      principal, no one knew he was Han Sen’s son. And even so, the kids and
      teachers all grew fond of him. He was the cutest kid in the kindergarten.
      Kids loved playing with him, and teachers liked treating him better than
      the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even so, Littleflower was still very quiet. No one knew he was Han
      Sen’s son, and so other than being well-liked, he didn’t draw much
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen entered the sanctuary again, and there, he found the Nine-Life
      Cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why are you here?” Han Sen frowned. He didn’t believe that their
      unexpected meeting was coincidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat laughed and said, “I found something interesting in the ruin, but
      I can’t get it out by myself! Let’s partner up again, if you’re
      interested.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I might help you, but only if you answer a few of my questions. No
      answer, no thank you,” Han Sen said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have Nine-Life Cat’s blood! Come on, we’re like family. You can ask
      me anything, and I’ll give you a proper answer.” Old Cat spoke as if they
      were brothers.
    </p>
    <p>“What is this thing on my back?” Han Sen asked Old Cat.</p>
