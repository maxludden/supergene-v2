<h2>Frozen Power</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2172</h3>

<p>The deified toad’s freezing powers were unusual. Even Han Sen,
with his Jadeskin, was still being frozen by the ice inside him.
Try as he might, he could not remove the frosting from his
skin.</p>
<p>Without Jadeskin’s cold elemental abilities and great resistance
to ice, any ordinary Marquise would have been frozen stiff long
before this.</p>
<p>Even so, Han Sen felt as if he was going to lose consciousness.
He kept casting Jadeskin as powerfully as possible in a bid to
refine the cold air that was afflicting his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast Jadeskin again and again, doing his best to refine
the cold air invading his flesh. His bones and muscles became
transparent, looking very much like jade.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was refining the toad’s cold power, he realized
just how scary the deified toad really was. This was more than the
simple cold elements Han Sen was used to dealing with. There was an
inclusion of space and time in the mix. This power could actually
freeze places in time. Although this was Han Sen’s first time
seeing something like, he immediately knew how frightening the
beast was.</p>
<p>Han Sen spent the next ten hours trying to eliminate the deified
toad’s cold air, but he was unable to completely remove it. Normal
Dukes would have died merely attempting to hold off such potent
power.</p>
<p>After twenty hours, though, Han Sen was finally able to fully
remove the cold air. And over the course of that time, he learned a
whole lot more about what he had been dealing with.</p>
<p>“The final realm of ice powers isn’t how cold they can be. I
used to use Jadeskin to summon the ice jade skeleton. Now that I
think about it, that is the true path of Jadeskin… Its practice in
the sanctuaries is just a smidgen of what it is capable of in the
geno universe. It is like, by making preparations ahead of time,
things become easier to accomplish in the future. It is easier to
complete the path, and it will be easier to go further… I don’t
know who built the sanctuaries, to enable this amazing effect…”
There was still too much mystery surrounding the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Like creatures in the sanctuary could max out their super genes
and gain a super god body. Han Sen’s super god body was titled
super king spirit. Everyone’s super body was different, but each
one of them was quite spectacular.</p>
<p>Any creature that left the sanctuaries with maxed out super
genes would have talents that could equal a higher race in the geno
universe. Or even better, in some aspects.</p>
<p>“Even though there are no humans, the creatures and spirits that
leave sanctuary are sure to be similar to the higher races I’ve
seen populating the geno hall. It’s scary to think about.” Whoever
created the sanctuaries must have been quite terrifying.</p>
<p>That deified toad had not yet re-emerged from the water. So, Han
Sen used his deified spectacles to have a look at the cold powers
and see what he could analyze.</p>
<p>It was quite difficult to analyze the powers of a deified being.
The analysis didn’t go quickly, but it was progressing. When Han
Sen finally got a proper look at them, he understood the ice powers
a lot better.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth hour of the first day, ripples and waves
began to appear on the surface of the pool. The deified toad came
out of the water and headed for the banks of the river. Han Sen
watched the deified toad, and when it entered the stone cave, Han
Sen turned his attention to the pool itself.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his right purple eye to examine the pool. There,
Han Sen saw some jade tadpoles swimming around the basin. They were
around the size of a fist, and they swam around the water like
emeralds.</p>
<p>“The heirs of a deified creature?” Han Sen was quite shocked by
what he was seeing. There had to be thirty or forty of the
tadpoles, far more than Han Sen would have expected. If they all
grew up, then they’d probably all become deified creatures. It was
a prospect that was rather scary to think about.</p>
<p>But the geno universe was different from the sanctuaries. The
heirs of a deified creature here would have better blood, but if
they wanted to be deified themselves, they’d still need to level up
slowly. Becoming deified was not a birthright, as it still required
a lot of effort and luck.</p>
<p>The deified toad crawled into the stone house, and when it did,
the door closed behind it. Meanwhile, the green tadpoles were still
flitting madly around the pool. They could not see the deified toad
anymore, but even so, they seemed to swim around happily.</p>
<p>The frozen river and the waterfall began to melt, and shortly
after, they returned to running as they used to.</p>
<p>Han Sen finally realized that the task of the guardian was not
to safeguard the toad, but to protect the toad’s tadpoles. They
needed to remain undisturbed while they were floating around in the
water.</p>
<p>Seeing those tadpoles swimming up the waterfall, Han Sen used
his Donxuan Aura to watch and observe. He was not going to allow
any strong creature to appear and eat them.</p>
<p>Han Sen was overthinking things, though. The Rebate had already
slain all the powerful creatures that had once existed in the area.
No other creature would appear and threaten those tadpoles.</p>
<p>Standing guard there, all alone, was just to ensure the safety
of the place. In addition to that, there were benefits to
claim.</p>
<p>After a short time of playing on the surface, the tadpoles sank
further down into the pool until they could no longer be
monitored.</p>
<p>“Is that cold power the benefit that the guardian may take? That
doesn’t make sense, though. Ordinary Marquises most certainly
couldn’t absorb it. And it isn’t as if all Nobles practice with
cold powers, either. The true reward cannot be as little as that.
There must be something else that I haven’t yet found.” Han Sen
examined the area for a while longer, but he could not discover any
further benefits to claim. He eventually left Cold Palace, still
suspicious about what he was supposed to claim.</p>
<p>Half a month later, Han Sen returned to Cold Palace. The deified
toad appeared through the doorway again. This time, when it entered
the pool, a group of tadpoles came up to the surface. They traveled
up the frozen waterfall to reach the top.</p>
<p>The tadpoles wriggled their tails to swim up, and they reached
the top alongside the deified toad. They surrounded it, and
together, the group observed the countless moons that populated the
skies of Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen saw the deified toad open its mouth. A bunch
of full-moons came out of its mouth and drifted up into the skies
to be with the others.</p>
<p>The moons seemed to have symbols that changed. Everything was
shining under the strong glow of the moonlight, and eventually,
they stopped their drift.</p>
<p>The birds in the sky stopped moving, too, but they did not fall.
It was like they had been frozen in the air.</p>
<p>Han Sen had the guardian tablet to protect him. He was not
frozen, and he just watched as the moon changed its symbol. Then,
the energy inside his body began to shift.</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s energy started to show movement, a beam of
moonlight pierced through the shroud of light that protected him.
It went straight into his body like spring water, rinsing all of
his cells gently.</p>
