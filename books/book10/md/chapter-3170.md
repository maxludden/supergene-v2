  When Han Sen won, Feng Yin Yin and Bao’er had already achieved victories of their own and returned. They had easily crushed their opponents.

Feng Yin Yin was delighted, but Bao’er was upset. “I couldn’t go in and play. It was so lame.”

“What is the point of fighting and killing? Why not just have a pet and take your fish for a walk? Isn’t that interesting?” Han Sen laughed.

“The opponents are too weak,” Bao’er said as she lifted her small lips. “This is pointless.”

“From now on, there will be a lot of elites,” Han Sen said to comfort her.

They left the God of Wealth Temple and returned to the Feng family residence. Jian Bu Gu already had lunch prepared for them.

“Mister Jian, this meat pie is very nice.” Han Sen and Bao’er, the two of them, each held a meat pie. They kept scarfing the food down, dishing out compliments.

Bao’er had only mentioned once that she wanted to eat a meat pie, but Jian Bu Gu had immediately gone to learn a few recipes and tirelessly practiced them. On this day, he finally finished a meat pie that tasted very good. No one who tried it could stop eating.

It was unknown what kind of meat Jian Bu Gu used, but he had cut it very thin. It was likely thinner than a cicada wing. There was no point in describing the taste. The texture of it was soft. It melted in one’s mouth. There was also pastry on the outside that was delightfully crispy. After taking a bite, the juice came out with the meat and combined with the pastry. Eating it was like going to heaven.

“Mister, your compliments are too lofty,” Jian Bu Gu answered with a smile. “It was just something small that I learned. I used to hobo everywhere. I never had the money to afford a hotel and eat food, so I learned to do things myself. Ergo, I learned how to cook pretty well.”

“Old Jian, with your skills, you would blow up the entire universe if you opened up a restaurant.” Bao’er had oil all over her face. She kept talking as she chewed.

“I am glad you like it, Miss Bao’er.” Jian Bu Gu smiled at Bao’er as he spoke.

In a god temple, Rocky Dee was watching the roster of the god fights. He paid attention to Dollar’s name.

“Dollar is probably Han Sen. He has the God of Wealth Blood-Pulse. When did this God of Wealth appear? When Han Sen broke my underworld silhouette power, was that done through the power of the God of Wealth?” Rocky Dee liked talking to himself.

A dragon maid politely said, “Mister Minister, Han Sen has defenses. It will be harder for us to kill him now. Why don’t we wait a little bit?”

Rocky Dee laughed. “There is no need for us to wait. These god fights are the perfect chance.”

The dragon maid was surprised to hear that. She was confused, so she said, “The god fights are fights between main god members. We should not get ourselves involved in such a thing.”

Rocky Dee smiled. He looked at the roster and saw Yan Dan. “Of course, we cannot join the god fights, but we can find someone to talk to. I am sure this fellow will not reject our offer.”

“Mister Minister, do you want to lure Dan Yan to the dark side?” the dragon maid thought. She thought that was wrong. She said, “Yan Dan is an inheritor Blood-Pulse of Empty God. It will be hard to lure him to the dark side.”

“No, no, no. We will just give him a tincture of aid,” Rocky Dee said with a smile. “There is no need to push him into the dark side. That would be a bit too much.”

Han Sen and the others did not have a powerful opponent up next. They all proceeded to the next round with ease. Even Feng Yin Yin had it easy.

During the fourth round, Feng Yin Yin met a famous person from the Qin Kingdom.

It was Zhong Miao Yin, who was one of the other three big singers of the Qin Kingdom like Feng Fei Fei. She was very famous in the Qin Kingdom. She was above Feng Fei Fei in status.

Zhong Miao Yin was not more famous because she was better than Feng Fei Fei. They were both special in their own way.

Feng Fei Fei was elegant, whereas Zhong Miao Yin was cute. Their genres of music diverged and did not overlap. Zhong Miao Yin’s fame was greater than Feng Fei Fei was because Zhong Miao Yin was the child of the singer king Zhong Li Qing. She was born noble, so her identity was higher than an ordinary singer that rose to stardom.

Zhong Miao Yin had a lot of fans all over the seven kingdoms. For this fight, many people across the kingdoms made sure to pay attention to the battle.

Zhong Miao Yin’s voice was very pure, and she had a lovely presence when she was young. She combined with a high-class gene race. A holy god light sound surrounded her. She looked like a fairy that had descended onto the earth.

“Miss Miao Yin must win…”

Seeing Zhong Miao Yin on the battleground, lots of fans were screaming hard enough to break their throats even though she could not hear them.

At the same time, a golden peacock flew into the space battleground. It was the gold wing peacock king Han Sen had given to Feng Yin Yin.

“How dare she! She is fighting with our Miao Yin Goddess, and she does not even show up. She only sent a gene race to fight. This is insane.”

“Her name is Lucky too! I bet this fighter’s power is as bad as her name since she doesn’t dare to fight Miao Yin Goddess directly.”

“I think so too. I have never heard of the God of Wealth before. It must be a low-class God Spirit. It won’t be like our Miao Yin Goddess. She has a sonic Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse.”

Regarding Feng Yin Yin only sending out a gene race to fight, Zhong Miao Yin fans were very angry. They kept complaining. Feng Yin Yin thought it was fine. She did not want to win. Winning or losing did not matter to her. She did not care about losing to Zhong Miao Yin.

When Zhong Miao Yin saw the gold wing peacock king flying, she was not in the mood to fight a gene race. To do so made her look low. Instead, she summoned a gene race to battle the gold wing peacock king.

It was a god-class sonic god bird. Zhong Miao Yin had raised it to possess an ultimate body. It was very powerful. It was a top-class gene race with sonic elements.

The sonic god bird flew to the gold wing peacock king. It also made a bird-like sound. Many shockwaves erupted. Everything that encountered the shockwaves was turned to dust.

The sonic god bird’s gene skill was Shaking Sonic. It was a powerful area-of-effect skill.

The gold wing peacock king ignored Shaking Sonic. Its eyes turned gold as it flapped its wings. It suddenly turned into a bolt of gold light. It was like it was cutting the sky like a screen. It broke the sonic powers and went across the sonic god bird.

Suddenly, there was a sad sound. God blood was everywhere. The sonic god bird was cut in half by the gold wing peacock king. It died right where it stood.

Before the frozen fans could react, the gold wing peacock king’s eyes shone with an evil light. It opened its mouth and sucked the sonic god bird’s body up. The sonic god bird’s body and blood were pulled into its belly. “Holy shit! What is going on?” Han Sen was surprised when he watched this scene.

When normal gene races were tamed, without the master’s permission, they would not consume another gene race. Even if they wanted to eat, they would require the approval of the master.

Now, the gold wing peacock king was openly eating the sonic god bird aggressively. Feng Yin Yin did not command it to do that either. He knew that because Feng Yin Yin’s face was full of surprise.

“Is there something wrong about this gold wing peacock king?” Han Sen wondered.

The gold wing peacock king was a mutant god-class gene race, but its origins were weird. It came from a mysterious stone stove. Han Sen always wondered why the mysterious stone stove possessed a gene egg.
