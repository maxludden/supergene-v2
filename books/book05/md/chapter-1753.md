  The car drove to the western side of the city and came to a stop.

They parked the heavy car on the road. The vehicle started to shake, as if some phantom power was pulling it forward.

Third Master and Han Sen got out of the car, and then Mister Tiger told them, “This is as far as we can go. If we keep going, the few tons of steel in the car will be sucked into the pit.”

“Let’s go. We need to see the black hole before nightfalls.” Third Master opened his arms in a welcoming gesture and started to lead Han Sen towards the hole.

Aside from Han Sen and Mister Tiger, there were another two Kates accompanying Third Master. Judging from the lifeforces they possessed, they had to be Nobles. They were Barons, but they were definitely stronger than Mister Tiger.

Han Sen did not mind their presence. Han Sen thought that Third Master was probably the strongest of the lot, actually. He was most certainly stronger than the two Nobles that were accompanying them.

Han Sen saw many shadows hidden in the bushes on their way. Many creatures were occupying the area.

This was the first time Han Sen had come to see the bottomless hole, and the mine they ventured into had collapsed a lot. There was a big circle in the earth, with a radius of a thousand meters.

They all skirted the hole, and when Han Sen looked down, he noticed it grew narrower and darker the deeper it went It looked as if it led into an abyss, and none could fathom what lay in the furthest reaches of the pit.

Third Master looked down into the hole, frowned, obviously thinking about something.

“Third Master,” said a voice behind them. It was Xina’s, and she had brought a man with her; one that possessed the head of a wolf. He looked at Han Sen for a second.

“Miss Xina, I did not expect to see you here. Are you interested in this hole, as well?” Third Master squinted his eyes as he looked at her.

Xina looked back expressionlessly, saying, “I am. And I didn’t expect to see you here, either. Have you discovered anything?”

Third Master shook his head. “We have sent people out to investigate, but we lost contact with them. Those that ventured here at night did not come back, and we are unsure why that is.”

Xina emotionlessly said, “That is a shame.”

After that, she ignored Third Master and began walking around the hole. Lone Wolf followed her closely as they investigated the curious enigma.

Han Sen could guess the sort of relationship Third Master and Xina possessed. Third Master was a pure Kate, so he should have been lower in the social hierarchy than Xina.

Hearing their conversation, though, it seemed that Third Master genuinely respected her. She also respected Third Master, and she didn’t treat him as rudely as she did other Kate people.

“Dad, something is down there.” As Han Sen was thinking, Bao’er suddenly spoke to him from up on his shoulder.

Bao’er leaned out to look down into the hole and blinked.

After that, Third Master was shocked. Even Xina and Lone Wolf were surprised.

They all looked down, and all they could see was pitch-black nothingness.

Han Sen patted Bao’er on the head and smiled at her. He told her, “There are monsters down there. Don’t look, lest they come up and eat you.”

Third Master thought Bao’er was just a child, and he didn’t think a child could see any further than they were able to. Thus, he didn’t pay much mind to what she said.

After Han Sen covered up her outburst, he put his mind to thinking about what exactly she had seen down there.

He knew Bao’er was not a normal child. She wouldn’t be mistaken over something like this. He needed to stay away from everyone, find a safe place where they could be alone, and ask Bao’er what she had seen.

Third Master wasn’t quite keen on leaving yet. They all stayed there until dusk before packing it in and leaving.

They didn’t go back into the city, though. They got to the car, and it was then that Third Master smiled at Han Sen and said, “We saw the hole, now let’s stay here and wait until we can hear the alleged crying sounds.”

Han Sen shrugged his shoulders and gave Bao’er a snack.

It was nighttime now, and it was very quiet. Not even the chirping of insects could be heard.

There was a wind blowing, and the rustling of the tree leaves sounded like gentle applause.

When night had fully settled in, a crying noise emanated from the hole. It really did sound like a woman wailing, but when you listened really carefully, it began to sound like something else entirely. It was very strange.

Third Master and Han Sen stepped out of the car. They looked towards the hole and saw a purple mist coming out of the mountain. It looked as if there was a glowing orb beneath it. It was all so very blurry, though, and it didn’t look real.

As the crying sounds continued, the purple mist rose. When it rose high enough, it disappeared.

Han Sen looked at the purple mist. The purple mist looked as if it was drawing the shape of a lotus. Wafts of mist even drifted down like petals falling.

“This is weird. I don’t know what’s under there, but whatever it is, it isn’t normal,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Third Master looked at the mist, but he didn’t dare draw nearer to investigate the hole. When it was almost dawn, the crying and the mist disappeared. It was then that he delivered everyone back to Gran City.

“My Lady, it looks like the legends are all true. The item is here. Before the old man comes, we can grab the item.” In the forest close to the hole, Lone Wolf spoke to Xina excitedly.

“The item is here, but we don’t know too much regarding the situation surrounding it. Perhaps something scary is now guarding it. Maybe you and I won’t be enough to handle this.” Xina frowned.

Lone Wolf said quietly, “Why don’t we let these guys find out for us? They are useless, and they won’t be able to retrieve the item, even if they find it.”

“Good. But we need to hurry. We need to get it before the old man arrives,” Xina said.

“I will spread the word. These greedy people will not squander an opportunity such as this.” Lone Wolf laughed.
