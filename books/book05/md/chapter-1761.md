  Han Sen had managed to put away some savings, and so he decided to buy a house for himself in the south.

It was in a slum, and there were many hobos and creatures living there. This was what Han Sen needed. A place where it wasn’t strange to have other creatures appear.

Golden Growler was kept in a warehouse-like room as he generated his geno armor. His body was full of some gold, mystic substance. It was becoming a gold set of armor that covered his entire body. Even his nails were wrapped up by this armor, leaving nothing exposed.

Han Sen looked at the geno armor that had generated successfully for Golden Growler, and wondered how the creature would even walk.

This was the beginning. Han Sen had lived on Planet Kate for a while now, and he was weH-versed in the differences between a Noble and a non-Noble. Although there was just one evolution separating the two, the differences were staggering.

Roar!

Golden Growler chuffed quietly. The geno armor on his body started to melt and twist, delighting Han Sen.

The geno armor melted and became liquid, but that meant Golden Growler was turning into a xenogeneic.

Han Sen felt nervous now. Xenogeneics were strong, and their bodies were strong, but there were side effects to note. If Golden Growler could not hold back the urge to kill, it would become a killing machine. That would be worse than not evolving at all.

His golden geno armor became liquid, and it melted into Golden Growler’s skin, fur, bones, and nails. It shocked Han Sen.

The xenogeneics he had seen only evolved in one part of their body. Even for Han Sen, it had only been his blood. But the entirety of Golden Growler was changing, not just one aspect of him. Han Sen did not know if this was normal because he didn’t know much about the evolving process of xenogeneics.

Golden Growler seemed to suffer some sort of pain, as his claws gripped the ground, churning up the soil.

His golden hair became metallic. His nails were turning into metal, too.

Han Sen couldn’t see what was inside Golden Growler, though, so he couldn’t tell what might have been going on below the surface. Perhaps his organs were also becoming metal?

Han Sen knew how painful it was to become a xenogeneic, though. Golden Growler would have to suffer through all this on his own.

Much time passed, and Golden Growler became more and more golden. He eventually looked like a golden statue. It made Han Sen wonder what would happen when he finished evolving. Could he live like an ordinary animal could? Or would he just become a metallic thing that could not even budge?

Golden Growler raised his head in a silent roar. His body was shining gold. There was a golden light coming from him, like an ancient beast. It was roaring in the sky along with him.

The gold light only appeared for a moment, though, and it soon faded. If Han Sen did not have good eyes, he would have thought they were playing tricks on him.

This was the first time Han Sen had watched another creature become a xenogeneic. He didn’t know if any of this was normal, and he didn’t know if this was what he looked like when he was evolving.

After the silent roar, Golden Growler’s body was normal again. Although he still had a golden glow, the flesh was meaty again. Still, it was a little different.

While Golden Growler’s evolution finished up, a few systems away, there was a beast in space. Its eyes were wide open, staring at Planet Kate.

After a while, it spoke to itself. “Is this possible? Are there any more Roars living in this galaxy? The blood is quite pure. Is that really a Roar?”

After asking himself this repeatedly, the galactic beast looked very sure of his thoughts, and he seemed very happy.

The beast’s body was in space, and the storm in the galaxy did nothing to it. It swung its tail, and its body flashed forward. It was headed for Kate.

Han Sen saw the xenogeneic Golden Growler no longer moving, and he thought something might have happened. But Golden Growler suddenly jumped and surprised Han Sen.

Han Sen saw Golden Growler’s eyes were glowing gold, and there wasn’t a single glint of murder in them. It made Han Sen feel a lot safer.

Golden Growler jumped on Han Sen and licked his face. He looked so happy, he swung his tail.

Han Sen patted Golden Growler on the head, looking delighted. He was thinking of bringing Little Angel and the others over, too, so he wouldn’t be so lonely. If they could all evolve twice, he and his posse would be extremely powerful. It would be very helpful for Han Sen in the geno universe.

He brought Golden Growler back with him to Wizard. Although his presence would be difficult to explain, Han Sen would prefer to have Golden Growler near him.

Golden Growler was down near Han Sen’s feet, checking out Planet Kate’s streets. Compared to the Alliance, this planet was… for lack of a better word: vintage. But it wasn’t barren, in any way. Many different civilizations and technological advancements were all meshed together.

As they walked, though, Han Sen’s face changed. He looked around but did not see anything. Still, something made him feel very worried and very nervous. His heart that had stopped beating—because of the solid blood—suddenly started to move again.

He was disturbed. Very disturbed.

It had been so long since Han Sen last felt like this, and his face turned red as he looked around. And he was thinking to himself, “Have the Feathers noticed I killed Xina? Have the higher-class Feathers come to exact revenge?”

Before he could think, Han Sen used all his power to take Golden Growler with him back to the sanctuary.

Han Sen could not sense where the danger was coming from, but he knew he couldn’t fight back. So, he chose to run.

But it was too late. There was a roar on the street, blasting shockwaves. It destroyed the entire block. After that, Han Sen felt as if he had been robbed of all power. He could no longer even stand. He was all soft, lying on the ground.

A green beast appeared on the street Its head was like a lion’s, but with the body of a rabbit. It had green fur, with the ears of an elf.

The beast approached, and as it came, the dimensions distorted around it. It did not care for Han Sen, and its eyes were locked on Golden Growler. And it looked excited.
