  > "Berserk Super Creature Fallen Slaughter Killed. Beast Soul Gained. Geno Core Destroyed. Flesh Cannot Be Eaten. Collect the Life Geno Essence to Gain One to Ten Super Geno Points Randomly."

By the time the announcement came to an end, Han Sen had already grabbed Fallen Slaughter’s Life Geno Essence. Without slowing down, he kept running forward.

“Why are there so many stupid people?” Qing Ya sighed. In his hands, he held a box. It was the one he had given to Fallen Slaughter. Then, he disappeared from atop the peak.

Although Han Sen had managed to get a berserk super beast soul and a Life Geno Essence, he was still in danger. The scary creatures were still in hot pursuit, and because of Fallen Slaughter’s sudden appearance, their ire and rage had only been increased.

Luckily, Han Sen was staying ahead of them with the crystal shoe. He wasn’t wasting his own strength, so he wasn’t going to get winded by simply running. Without the shoe, outrunning his pursuers would have been impossible.

Since there was nothing else to do while he ran, Han Sen decided to take a look inside his Sea of Soul. He wanted to see the specifics of his berserk super beast soul.

Fallen Slaughter was like a demon inside his Sea of Soul, one with a body wholly wrought of metal. When he glanced over the beast soul’s information, Han Sen came away delighted.

It was a shapeshifting beast soul with a humanoid shape. It meant Han Sen could alter his body into something that would allow him to go toe-to-toe with berserk super creatures. He could really show the breadth of his strength with that.

With that beast soul, Han Sen had gotten much stronger, and he wagered he could now fight any rival in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

Even so, Han Sen did not dare to stop right now. What happened to Fallen Slaughter was a warning to Han Sen, and it showed him how frightening the horde behind him really was. Even if he used his new gear and exerted all his might, he couldn’t take them on.

There were reasons why no faction was able to construct anything in Wind Song Desert or occupy the area. It was strange, given how the individual creatures there were all stronger than what you would come across in any other shelter.

Han Sen was unable to take off the crystal shoe, but he thought he could try cutting his leg off when he found someplace safe. Someplace safe meaning, not anywhere in Wind Song Desert.

There were too many creatures chasing him now. If he stopped for a moment, he’d be killed.

By the time Han Sen calmed down, though, he realized he was now out of the desert The environment was a lot more familiar, and he realized it was actually a place that he knew.

But when he saw what he was running toward, his face changed. He was on a collision course with Outer Sky Shelter. If the crystal shoe kept him going that way, he would practically be feeding himself to Yu Miao.

“Oh no! Even though I have Fallen Slaughter’s beast soul, it would still be very hard. Outer Sky Shelter is home to many elites. It doesn’t matter how strong I am, I’ll probably end up dead.” Thinking of all the creatures in Outer Sky, Han Sen started to think, “Speaking of incredible power, I have a lot of creatures behind me.”

Han Sen thought of what happened to Fallen Slaughter again, and at that moment, another thought crossed his mind.

“This might be the opportunity I’ve been looking for. If I transform into Fallen Slaughter before I get to Outer Sky Shelter, Outer Sky will most likely just see the many wretched creatures behind me. They will think I am purposely bringing them to attack the shelter. They’ll end up being forced to fight the creatures from Wind Song Desert, providing me an opportunity to escape”, Han Sen thought.

But he didn’t transform just yet. Transforming into Fallen Slaughter would cost a lot of energy. He would only be able to use it for a limited time, so he couldn’t waste a single moment of it.

The crystal shoe was still driving him forward without reprieve, and Outer Sky Shelter lay directly in front of him. When Han Sen got close to it, he immediately summoned Fallen Slaughter beast soul.

Ridiculous strength surged through Han Sen’s body, and his mass expanded. He became a four-meter-tall, black metal demon. On his back were demonic metal wings. He looked very scary.

The crystal shoe on his foot looked a little strange, but compared to his Fallen Slaughter body, it was of little distinguishing importance.

Outer Sky Shelter was just like its usual self that day. It stood stoic, with an air of mysticism. Countless creatures and spirits were there, all resting at the shelter.

Suddenly, they all turned to look in one direction beyond its walls. There was a tremor-like shockwave coming for them. Then, they felt an immeasurable lifeforce rush toward them like the tide.

The watchers on the shelter’s towers and ramparts saw a black body approaching quickly. Behind him was an army of hellborn devils, all racing forward in madness and rage.

“Attack! Many creatures have come to attack the shelter!” A watcher cried out the warning, right before ringing the alarm bell.

The bells were positioned all across Outer Sky Shelter, and the occupants inside were all hastily frightened. They knew what that siren meant.

Shelters like Outer Sky were not something many would dare to challenge. And those who did decide to fight had to be very powerful themselves. Whenever a siege was underway, a horrific battle would soon follow.

Many creatures and spirits were swiftly summoned to defensive positions.

“Who is attacking our shelter?”

“I don’t know. It seems like a bunch of horrible creatures.”

“Is it Sacred?”

“I don’t think so. None of them look familiar.”

All the people began to talk about it. Yu Miao was in the line of defense, and when she looked over the horde, her face went white. She said, “Endless Abyss Master, Fallen Slaughter! And creatures from the Wind Song Desert! Why are they here attacking Outer Sky Shelter in unison?”

Yu Miao wasn’t the only person in the shelter who was confused. Outer Sky was miles away from the Wind Song Desert, so why would such creatures randomly decide to cooperate against them?

They didn’t have much time to ponder this conundrum, however, since Han Sen had already reached the perimeter of the shelter. He bellowed, “To all the scum that populates Outer Sky Shelter… Die!”

After that, Han Sen threw a punch towards a spirit from the Yu family that was standing atop a tower.
