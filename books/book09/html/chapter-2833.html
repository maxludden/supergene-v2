<p>Fortunately, this is just a 20-year-old Very High Leader. If it
was the Very High Leader of the present, it would not be so easy to
trick him. Han Sen felt a modicum of relief, which led him to
sigh.</p>
<p>Very High Leader stared at Han Sen and asked, “Can you really
learn geno arts from just a glance?”</p>
<p>“Not quite,” Han Sen casually said. “Some of the more difficult
geno arts require me to spend some time researching. Simple geno
arts like those I can learn on a whim.”</p>
<p>“Simple?” Very High Leader could not determine what that
meant.</p>
<p>Very High Leader had a strange expression as he asked, “For you,
Mister, what is a geno art that is hard?”</p>
<p>“Like your race’s Very High Sense,” Han Sen said. “That is a
very difficult geno art.”</p>
<p>Very High Leader felt more comfortable hearing that. At least
the Very High had one geno art that commanded the man’s
respect.</p>
<p>Then, Han Sen added another sentence. “If there is a way, I can
practice it in ten days to half a month.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen said that, Very High Leader could not help but
feel angry. He coldly asked, “Do you really think you can learn
Very High Sense in ten days or half a month?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. Anyway, it would not take me any longer than a
month.” Han Sen looked at him with much disdain.</p>
<p>“Fine. Fine. Fine. Let’s do Very High Sense. I have a Very High
Sense geno art here. I will give you the instructions. If you can
practice it within a month, you can do anything to me.” Very High
Leader was angry.</p>
<p>“Sure. That sounds like a good deal.” Han Sen agreed to the bet,
which made him more than pleased.</p>
<p>For Han Sen, Very High Sense was something he could only
simulate 30% to 40%. A high-class geno art like that was really
difficult to simulate. Learning Very High Sense within a month was
impossible.</p>
<p>That sort of bet was one that Han Sen was going to lose, but he
did not mind winning or losing that bet. With this bet, and the few
hours that remained, Very High Leader would not kill the butterfly
lady. That meant Han Sen would win his bet with God. That was the
result he ultimately wanted.</p>
<p>Very High Leader was furious. He brought out a geno art.</p>
<p>It was a geno art that came with Very High Sense. It required
Very High Sense as a base for it. Otherwise, one was unable to
learn it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not able to learn it with ease, but he did not plan
on learning it. He only needed Very High Leader to not kill the
butterfly lady for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>God observed this very interesting turn of events but was not
going to stop it. When Han Sen and the Very High Leader struck this
bet, God smiled and said, “Your skill at turning the tables is
something quite magical. If this was the first time I had seen
this, you might have won. It is a shame that someone already tried
making use of the same trick before you. I am not going to lose to
this same trick a second time.”</p>
<p>“Who did this last time? Was it Han Jinghzi?” Han Sen asked with
curiosity.</p>
<p>“It was not Han Jingzhi. It was that guy from Sacred. He was
just like you. I thought I was already going to win because I
pushed him into a losing position, but he knew how to turn the
tables the same way you did. He went along with what happened. By
doing so, he reversed the entire thing.” It looked like God was
trying to remember what happened. A small smile formed on its mouth
as it said, “But you are too unlucky. You were not the first person
to use this sort of trick before me. Therefore, I suspect you are
going to lose.”</p>
<p>“We have not even had a result yet. How do you think I will end
up losing?” After saying that, Han Sen felt a chill.</p>
<p>“You are right. It is not the end yet. Perhaps you will lose,
too.” God nodded with seriousness. It sounded as if it was
apologizing for what it said.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t speak. He pretended to study the geno art that
Very High Leader gave him. He wanted to know what kind of trick God
could perform to promote a turnabout.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if Very High Leader would kill the butterfly
lady, but over the next few hours, he probably had no intention of
killing her.</p>
<p>God did not do anything special to incite or lure Very High
Leader. God merely started reading Very High Sense.</p>
<p>Very High Leader heard it for a while. Eventually, his face
changed to one of rage. He asked, “Where did you steal Very High
Sense off my race?”</p>
<p>“You are going to kill me, anyway. Does it matter where I stole
it from? I do have a few questions, and I am hoping you can help
me.” Before Very High Leader could respond, God went on to say,
“Very High Sense features a sentence that reads ‘forget myself and
I will become everyone.’ What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“This is a secret of my race,” Very High Leader coldly said.
“How could I tell you that?”</p>
<p>God did not mind and kept talking. “From what I can understand,
regarding forgetting myself, it is not really about forgetting
yourself. It is like a give and take sort of thing. When facing
benefits, we use our benefits to help others. We use our hearts to
treat others nicely. That way, they will all treat you like family.
That is why there is a saying like, ‘forget myself and I will
become everyone.’”</p>
<p>“No. If the other side only comes close because of benefits,
even if they treat you like family, it does not really count for
you…” Very High Leader tried to object.</p>
<p>“I see. Then, how about whatever possibility is true? How do you
explain that?” God did not talk about the butterfly lady. He spoke
about Very High Sense with Very High Leader.</p>
<p>God was just going to teach, but the question he had was that
same as Very High Leader. He could not help but object to God. As
they were both talking, Very High Leader had many inspirations.
There were many things he did not understand, but he was now able
to understand it all. His mind had improved.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt terrible. He thought he had found a decent plan to
stall Very High Leader from doing anything brash, but Very High
Leader was becoming inspired by God. His Very High Sense had become
stronger, and he understood the world far more. He had become
smarter. Or, he had become less and less human. He only followed
the rules to do things now, so it was hard to make sure he would
not kill the butterfly lady.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not understand what Very High Forget Love meant, but
everyone knew the Very High did not possess the capacity for love.
They could abandon their bodies to combine with the universe. What
else could they give up?</p>
<p>While he was talking to God, Very High Leader looked more and
more serious. His eyes looked very calm. Han Sen was worried.</p>
<p>What can I do? Han Sen was suddenly unable to find a way to
overcome this. Everything God said followed some sort of rule. It
made Han Sen feel as if he was in a lot of trouble. It was like
rowing a boat upstream. Nothing was going well.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood that it was because God could control the
rules of the world and the hearts of the people. Fighting it
face-to-face was impossible. God could not be beaten.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the butterfly lady. He was thinking of
something. So, I need to use my sword and fight tooth and nail to
save this situation.</p>
