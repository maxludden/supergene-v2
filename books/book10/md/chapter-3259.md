  “Thank you for leading the way,” Han Sen said with a hearty laugh. “I have already received the ice jade evil lady. I wonder if Miss Tian also managed to retrieve the lost items of her party.”

He could tell Tian Jing was trying to hide something from him and hoping to do something with the ice jade evil lady before him.

He could not blame Tian Jing for that. He had just stolen Tian Jing’s opportunity. It was normal for Tian Jing to want it back. They did things through power, and Tian Jing had not done anything wrong. If Tian Jing did not want to kill him, that meant there was danger. So, Han Sen did not plan on doing anything to her.

“I did not find them yet. If you are not in any rush to leave this place, can you help me look for them together?” Tian Jing’s face returned to normal. She tidied up her hair and smiled.

Han Sen smiled and replied, “Maybe that isn’t such a good idea. I am afraid your precious items will start flying toward me as well.” He put his hands together and left.

Tian Jing felt bad. She was no longer able to remain calm. She was mad as she watched Han Sen leave, but there was nothing she could say or do about it.

“My party has been preparing for the claiming of the ice jade evil lady for such a long time. No one could have expected the ice jade evil lady to fly into a man’s hands. Fate is really funny… Han Sen… I will remember you…” Tian Jing gnashed her teeth. She weirdly looked at Han Sen leaving.

The way back was an easy route. Han Sen quickly returned to the surface of the ice fields. He used Galaxy Teleportation to return to the Feng family’s castle.

Han Sen could not wait to summon the ice jade evil lady from his Sea of Soul. Han Sen was shocked that the ice jade evil lady refused his will. She was unable to be summoned.

Han Sen was surprised. This had never happened before. It did not matter what beast soul it was or whatever gene race it was that had been claimed. Once that happened and were placed in the Sea of Soul, they could be controlled by his mind to do whatever he wished them to. This is the first time he had been refused.

Han Sen tried it a few different times, but the results were always the same. He was unable to summon the ice jade evil lady.

“Stop trying,” the ice jade evil lady said. “You and my soul contract put us on equal footing. I am different from how you command other gene races. They might be slaves, but without my permission, you are not allowed to summon me. Even if you summon me, I can choose whether or not to fight for you. I can choose not to combine with you.”

“In that case, why would you want to form a contract with me?” Han Sen was not surprised. If the ice jade evil lady was willing to speak, he believed he would learn something very soon.

“Your body has an opposite power to mine, and I will need your power to accomplish something,” the ice jade evil lady said.

“That means you are not just a newborn gene race,” Han Sen said. “You might say I am, but you can also say I am not.” The ice jade evil lady’s response was weird.

Han Sen was silent for a bit before making a guess. “Do you have memories about yourself before you were reincarnated?”.

“Pretty much, but I did not pass through the geno hall to reincarnate.” The ice jade evil lady wasn’t planning on hiding anything.

“Can you reincarnate without going to the geno hall and remain in the same universe?” Han Sen looked at the ice jade evil lady in shock. This was the first time he had heard about something like this.

“I have my own way,” the ice jade evil lady coldly said. “You do not need to ask me about that. Right now, my body is too weak. It has been difficult for me to restore my former shape and strength. I have no clue how long it will take before I can break the world again. I cannot wait that long.”

“In that case, we should talk about striking a deal. What can you do for me?” Han Sen asked his question as directly as possible.

“I can lend you my power and fight for you like any ordinary gene race,” the ice jade evil lady said. “In exchange, when I need you, you need to do something for me and provide me power.”

“I think I should be told what sort of powers you will want me to lend.” Han Sen looked at her with interest.

“When I had almost finished my evolution process, I was backstabbed by a human and failed,” the ice jade evil lady said. “I had to reincarnate. I want that human’s soul to be gone and forever banished from this world.”

“Who is this human you are talking about?” Han Sen asked with growing interest.

“I do not know,” the ice jade evil lady said. “I know him via his appearance, but I do not know his name. I will be able to point him out if you see him. If he can stop me from evolving, he cannot be some random nobody of the human race. He should not be difficult to find.”

“Good. We should keep going with the questions. What type was your final evolution?” Han Sen looked at the ice jade evil lady. He checked out her face.

“Reboot,” the ice jade evil lady said with a look of pride.

“Can gene races really evolve that far?” Han Sen was shocked. Up until now, he had never heard of anyone approaching Reboot class in terms of evolution.

Including all humans and every creature, it seemed as if Han Sen knew only one Reboot-class being.

Even a guy like Qin Xiu would not have challenged the wrath of a Reboot God Spirit. Now that he completely controlled the black crystal armor, it was hard to say what he might do. With a cold face, the ice jade evil lady said, “Yes. I only needed one more step to succeed. It was all because of that horrible human.” She looked as if she harbored a lot of hatred within her.

“The human you are talking about, did he look like this?” Han Sen’s fingertip had a point of light on it. With it, he drew Qin Xiu’s face in the air.

“You will have to summon me out,” the ice jade evil lady said.

“Can’t you see it?” Han Sen was shocked.

“If this is all about fair trade, you cannot control me, and I cannot control you. In your Sea of Soul, I cannot see or feel anything out there. Without your summoning, I cannot leave your Sea of Soul.” The ice jade evil lady did not hide anything from Han Sen. Besides, these things could not be hidden. After a while, the truth was bound to come out.

“This trade is fair.” Han Sen noticed the ice jade evil lady mention the Sea of Soul directly, which surprised him. Aside from those in the Alliance, very few beings knew what it was.

Han Sen did not say anything. He summoned the ice jade evil lady. This time, she was easy to summon. The ice jade evil lady came before Han Sen. She looked at Han Sen’s drawing.

“That’s not him.” After seeing Qin Xiu, the ice jade evil lady shook her head and asked, “Who is that human? From the way you have drawn him, he does not look simple.”

This surprised Han Sen. Usually, things like this always connected to Qin Xiu. This time, it was not related to him.

“It is good that is not the case. He is a difficult guy to deal with. If he was the human who hurt you, vengeance would not come easy.” Han Sen did not want to talk too much about him. He looked at the ice jade evil lady and said, “If you want to co-operate with me, let’s see what happens when we combine. Let’s see if our powers can rip the world.”

After that, Han Sen summoned the ice jade evil lady. The ice jade evil lady did not refuse his summons. She floated over to Han Sen and combined with his body.
