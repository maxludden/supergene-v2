    <p>
      Since the teleporter he’d come out of was entirely random, there were too
      many possibilities. He could come out of a public teleporter, or even a
      private one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen donned his Death Armor Swordsman appearance before stepping
      inside, in case someone saw him come through and questioned how he had
      been able to do that. This was something not even he could explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elites knew he had ascended and gone back to the Alliance, but there
      was no knowing if they knew Han Sen was able to travel to and from the
      sanctuaries. It wouldn’t be just God’s Organization poking about these
      matters, if it became publicly known; the Alliance government would
      undoubtedly want answers, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not afraid, but he just didn’t think it’d be worth all the
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear God, please let me spawn close to home. It would be best if I end up
      straight on Planet Roca.” As Han Sen prayed, the teleporter’s lights
      started to blur, sending him to his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dimensions around looked odd, and when Han Sen’s vision returned, he
      was standing in a teleporter belonging to the Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen opened the chamber and took a look around. He was not standing
      outside a public teleporter, and he soon realized he was standing inside
      the music hall of someone’s home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The architecture was fairly old-fashioned, but with the decorations and
      space available, you could tell it was a music hall belonging to a very
      rich family. Romantic music was playing, and it made Han Sen calm down
      somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this place belonged to rich people, he wouldn’t be on a planet that was
      too far away. At the very least, it meant he could get home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to use Dongxuan Aura to learn more about his
      environment, someone entered the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful woman with curly, wet hair. She had a white towel
      wrapped tight around her body, revealing her gorgeous long legs. Her skin
      was snow-white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were closed as she came in, with a glass of wine in one hand. She
      danced to the music frivolously, believing no one to be watching. She
      sipped her wine, immersing herself in the rhythm of the music. She looked
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was in her private home, and she never thought someone else
      might be there. She felt entirely secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mood was bright, as she kept her eyes closed while sipping wine and
      spinning to the rhythms of the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened unexpectedly. After a few mesmerizing spins, the towel dropped
      from her body. And what’s more, she was only half a meter away from Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at her, and although he was delighted to allow his eyes to
      feast on such a wonderful body, he couldn’t help but feel a little awkward
      about it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to that, he knew who this woman was. He was quite close with her.
      It was Huangfu Pingqing from the Huangfu family. She was his senior, and
      he never expected their next encounter would play out like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the towel had fallen, she opened her eyes in order to pick it back
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes and saw Han Sen. They looked at each and froze for
      three seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huangfu Qingping screamed. The next second, she summoned a beast soul
      armor and tried to kick Han Sen in the balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was now very happy he had used his shapeshifting beast soul. She
      could not tell who he was in his current state. Things would have been
      very bad if she could recognize him, and so he swiftly dodged, broke the
      window, jumped out, and ran off.
    </p>
    <p>When he flew into the sky, he soared through the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>
      “*sshole! I won’t let you go,” Huangfu Qingping nibbled her lips as she
      started to pursue. Fortunately, Han Sen was too fast for her, and she
      couldn’t keep up for very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Defense System: Intruder Detected. Attack Confirmation?” The Al standing
      next to her spoke.
    </p>
    <p>“Attack,” Huangfu Qingping said immediately.</p>
    <p>
      “Attack,” the computer repeated. Then, the weapon systems took aim at Han
      Sen who was flying away.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>A net of lights all came screaming through the air toward Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      That was the Huangfu family’s planet, and its defensive systems were
      strong. They could easily protect the planet from attacks instigated by
      entire battleship fleets. It was very powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t dare use Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go. Queen was from the
      Huangfu family, and although Huangfu Qingping never practiced it herself,
      she would be able to recognize it when she saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was too much, and Han Sen had great difficulty dodging. So,
      instead, Han Sen used the glove on his hand to block the strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were loads of explosions in the air, and the radar systems were
      disrupted because of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen get hit by all those explosions, Huangfu Qingping believed
      him to have been killed. Demigods would most certainly be shot down under
      the intensity of such blasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the radar system returned to normal, though, the satellites revealed
      images of Han Sen now up in space, entirely unharmed. He disappeared
      quickly from the satellite’s viewing spectrum, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huangfu Qingping was shocked, and when she went to confirm via the space
      telescope, she confirmed that he really was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That was Qingping Senior. Her skin and body are still as good as ever;
      it’s only her grumpy mood that needs work.” After Han Sen escaped, he
      privately complimented her as he reviewed what had happened and what he
      had been able to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen summoned the unicorn beetle, then brought up its map. He wouldn’t
      say he was either close to Planet Roca or too far from there, but with the
      unicorn beetle’s speed, he’d arrive home in a day’s travel.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen flew the beetle towards Planet Roca, where his family was.</p>
    <p>
      Huangfu Qingping was madly looking over the video that had been recorded,
      trying to learn who that person might have been. There were no cameras in
      the music hall, but the external cameras didn’t pick up anything about him
      conning in. They only saw him escape and get to space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huangfu Qingping swore to find who that *sshole was. She searched
      tirelessly for the culprit, despite knowing that he had used a
      shapeshifting beast soul which hid everything about the person behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did find something special, though. His right hand was strange. He may
      have had armor on, but his right hand was wearing a glove. It looked very
      weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn’t know if it was a beast soul or not, but she could definitely
      start an investigation from her knowledge of the shapeshifting beast soul
      and glove the intruder wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must be a powerful demigod to block those attacks. That certainly
      narrows down the list of possible candidates,” Huangfu Qingping thought
      angrily. “Don’t let me find out who you are. Otherwise, you’re done for.
