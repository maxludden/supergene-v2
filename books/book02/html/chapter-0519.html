    <p>
      &#8220;You really dare to fight me?&#8221; Annie was dazed. She did not
      believe that Han Sen dared to fight her. In terms of real fighting
      abilities, Han Sen was quite weak compared to her.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, but hands only.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen explained himself. What he was talking about was to play red hand.
      If she were to fight him, Han Sen might not even be able to survive two or
      three strikes from Annie.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay.&#8221; After hearing Han Sen&#8217;s explanation, Annie
      agreed without hesitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact that she was not able to use her strength just now made her feel
      quite sullen. Although there were many limitations in terms of playing red
      hands, she could use her own speed and strength to punish Han Sen slightly
      in order to avenge herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie did not believe that she would still lose to Han Sen when she could
      use her own strength and speed. That could never happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You made the first move just now. So, it is my turn this time,
      right?&#8221; Han Sen asked Annie.
    </p>

    <p>
      She did not say anything but put her right hand above Han Sen&#8217;s
      right hand. She did not believe that Han Sen could beat her with his
      speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did you know why you lost just now?&#8221; Han Sen asked her
      suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why&#8230; Slap!&#8221; Annie was still preoccupied with the fact
      that she had lost to Han Sen. When Han Sen mentioned it, she was
      distracted immediately. When she was about to ask why, Han Sen&#8217;s
      hand had already hit hers.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are shameless…&#8221; Annie gritted teeth, wanting to kill Han
      Sen immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The game is all about tricks. If they are not allowed, you should
      say that earlier. Tell me, are tricks allowed?&#8221; Han Sen asked,
      smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;As you… Slap!&#8221; When Annie just said two words, she was hit on
      her hand again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie was so pissed that she almost vomited blood. Staring at Han Sen with
      her eyes wide, she almost looked like a tigress that was about to swallow
      Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen played red hands with Annie from the very beginning, it would be
      hard for him to hit her even with his sneak attack skills, considering her
      reflex and speed as a surpasser.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because Han Sen had already broken the peace of her mind earlier,
      she could no longer treated the game normally, which was why he was able
      to affect her state of mind and hit her unexpectedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Annie&#8217;s mind had become a mess. She was watching out
      for Han Sen at any moment. However, the more she did that, the easier it
      was for her to be hit.
    </p>

    <p>Slap slap slap!</p>

    <p>
      Any stared her eyes wide, watching Han Sen as if she had seen a ghost. She
      was both sullen and angry. There was no way she could understand why she
      would not be able to dodge Han Sen strikes based on her speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      She hated Han Sen&#8217;s shamelessness and wickedness even more, which
      distracted her each time so much that she could not focus on dodging his
      strikes.
    </p>

    <p>As the stone was tossed into a well, there was bound to be ripple.</p>

    <p>
      The amazing fact about human mind was that sometimes you knew what the
      right thing to do was, but you could not control your own temper and
      thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie knew that she should calm down and stay away from Han Sen&#8217;s
      provocation. However, she was so upset at this point that Han Sen smiles
      made her feel incredibly angry. There was no way she could calm down.
    </p>

    <p>Slap slap slap!</p>

    <p>
      Annie was hit again and again. She could not tolerate Han Sen&#8217;s
      words.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, electricity boomed on Annie&#8217;s body, turning her
      into a burning lightbulb. She hit the table with her palm and turned the
      table into ashes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Annie, appalled. He was terrified. The strength of a
      surpasser was so scary that it was beyond imagination. If it were him that
      Annie attacked, Han Sen would probably become ashes as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, it was in the Alliance, so there was no way Annie would lay a
      finger on him no matter how mad she was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Watching Annie was so mad that she was shivering and sparkling, Han Sen
      said with a smile, &#8220;You want to hit me because you lost?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Staring Han Sen for a long while, lights disappeared on Annie&#8217;s
      body. Without saying anything, she turned around and left. She was afraid
      that she might not be able to resist the urge to kill Han Sen if she said
      one more word to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Asshole…Bastard… Shameless…&#8221; Annie did not go back to her
      room but went to the virtual camp directly. She vented her madness in the
      virtual camp like crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the alloy table that had turned into ashes, Han Sen could not help
      spitting his tongue. He decided not to provoke that woman killer. If she
      disregarded anything and hit him, Han Sen could not survive a strike from
      her at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Surpasser is so scary. They are not human anymore.&#8221; Although
      Han Sen said that, he looked forward to becoming a surpasser even more.
    </p>

    <p>
      After eating the entire snake fish king, Han Sen had gained nine sacred
      geno points, and currently, he had twenty-one sacred geno points already.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen was trying to find Yi Dongmu to hunt sacred-blood creatures
      together, he failed to find him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without other sacred-blood creatures to hunt, Han Sen thought of the crab
      again. Although the shell of the golden crab was hard, Han Sen had
      practiced the yin force and could penetrate its shell. Maybe he could kill
      it after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key was his strength. If he did not have enough strength, that was
      fine as well. Han Sen decided to dive into the Crystal Palace first, hunt
      some primitive fish creatures at the bottom of the lake, and fill up his
      primitive geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hunting fish creatures at the bottom of the lake was much easier than
      fishing. Han Sen returned to the bottom of the frozen lake again. With the
      silver eel this time, it was easy for him to come to the Crystal Palace.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden crab climbed out after hearing the noise. When it saw it was
      Han Sen, it quickly went back to the cabin, disregarding what Han Sen was
      doing outside. It never went out again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not provoke the crab but looked at the fish creatures that
      were swimming at the bottom of the lake. He thought to himself,
      &#8220;when I have the Crystal Palace to myself, I will never worry about
      creature resources because I can go to the deep ocean to hunt.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the Crystal Palace was indestructible, Han Sen was not afraid to
      encounter scary creatures at the bottom of the sea. He could always hide
      in the cabin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important thing at this moment was to control this Crystal
      Palace. Otherwise, he could go nowhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Standing on the deck, Han Sen felt like he was in an aquarium. Above his
      head, all kinds of fish creatures were swimming around. However, because
      there was no glass, Han Sen could reach into the water to touch them.
    </p>

    <p>
      After waiting for a while, when seeing a golden anchovy swimming nearby,
      Han Sen reached out immediately and grabbed it into the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden anchovy suddenly fell on the floor. Without water, it had lost
      almost all its abilities to fight. All he could do was to jump and try to
      go back to the water.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen would never give him the opportunity and trampled it to
      death.
    </p>

        Anchovy Gained. Eat Its Meat To Gain 0 To 10 Primitive Geno Points
