<h2>Killing Feather</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1749</h3>

<p>The female Feather used her golden feather pendant to protect
herself. She kept trying to attack Han Sen, unleashing swordlights
continuously, her attacks forming a net over Han Sen.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Tiger and the female Feather were Baron class, but her
skills far exceeded those of Mister Tiger. It seemed like the geno
universe had better skills, but ordinary people just didn’t get to
see them.</p>
<p>But these kinds of skills were nothing to Han Sen. When Han Sen
used phoenix techniques, he had greater mobility than birds.</p>
<p>Han Sen was fighting the female Feather in the air. The Feather,
who should have excelled at aerial combat, was actually performing
worse than he was.</p>
<p>The Rhino Horn Dagger kept striking the female Feather, but it
wasn’t enough to break the defenses created by the golden necklace.
Han Sen didn’t know what they were, but the light they shone was
incredibly hard. It was like a shield that could not be
sundered.</p>
<p>The female Feather tried to strike even harder, but she couldn’t
land a hit on Han Sen. She wanted to fall back a greater distance
so she could fire arrows, but Han Sen kept the distance between the
two null.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked as cold as ice in his determination to break the
defense of the feather necklace. His body was boiling like lava,
and he was unleashing so much power. His body was monstrous, and
his speed constantly accelerated as he swung his dagger
fiercely.</p>
<p>“If one strike doesn’t work, then ten strikes will. If ten
strikes don’t work, then a hundred strikes will!” Han Sen’s blood
was boiling, and he swung his dagger even faster.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was a cold light coming from his dagger.
In the end, the light became a beam of luminescence. The lights
were like chains, striking the feather necklace. The sound of
impacts became an unbroken roar.</p>
<p>The female Feather was spooked. She flapped her wings, wanting
to fly away from Han Sen. But Han Sen flew better than she did. She
couldn’t escape, and she looked glum.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>As Han Sen kept attacking, the feather necklace started to
develop small cracks. The golden shield started to weaken.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes went cold. The vessels in his arms were
incredibly strong, and the dagger was driven against the golden
shield again.</p>
<p>The necklace crumbled with a loud shattering noise, and the gold
shield broke like reinforced glass. The golden light turned to
dust, and the pendant fell.</p>
<p>The female Feather was in shock. The dagger in Han Sen’s hand
was like lightning now, and it flashed right through her neck.</p>
<p>The female Feather flapped her wings. She moved with the desire
to evade the strike, but the attack connected as intended. It cut
halfway through her neck.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger froze. Han Sen was just a normal creature with geno
armor. And yet, he had just managed to take down two Feather
Barons. The sight blew his mind, and now he looked at Han Sen as if
he was seeing a monster.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still holding his dagger as he looked into the eyes
of the Feather. The neck that had been cut open suddenly healed, as
if no damage had ever been inflicted.</p>
<p>“Feather xenogeneic?” Han Sen frowned. Feathers evolved quickly.
They were a superior race that was born Noble, but they could still
evolve in two different ways.</p>
<p>They would either gain a geno armament, or they would become
xenogeneic. The female Feather was like the Feather that Han Sen
had managed to kill in the sanctuary. It was a xenogeneic Feather,
and only they could possess xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>Still, seeing the female xenogeneic Feather, Han Sen did realize
something. Not all the xenogeneics were driven by a simple urge to
kill.</p>
<p>The female Feather’s eyes glowed red. Her white wings turned
gold, as bones extended and sprouted from her wings. She turned
from being an angel, into a gold winged witch. She screamed and
flew towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the xenogeneic power, but her strength
and speed increased. Han Sen didn’t dodge, though. His blood was
pumping with rage, and he raised the dagger and aligned it with the
female Feather’s head. The female Feather’s hand grabbed the dagger
as she descended, though, and it couldn’t even cut through her
palm.</p>
<p>The female Feather grabbed Han Sen by his other arm. Her golden
nails pierced through his geno armor. She stretched her gold bone
wings to wrap around Han Sen.</p>
<p>The golden bones protruded sharply from the wings, and if they
closed around him completely, it’d be like a mouth of fangs closing
on him. He’d be skewered.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s hands were grabbed by the female Feather, and it
seemed too late for him to dodge. His whole body was indeed wrapped
up by the wings.</p>
<p>“Oh, no!” Mister Tiger knew this was bad.</p>
<p>But the next second, he heard a katcha noise sound. It was
followed by a scream.</p>
<p>The female Feather fell backwards, screaming. Her face had been
cut in half, with her golden wings entirely broken.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the air, with geno armor that was full of holes.
But there was no blood seeping from the gaps. His white skin
through the holes, and there did not seem to be any wounds.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body flew like a phoenix, going right towards the
female Feather.</p>
<p>After the female Feather used a xenogeneic gene, her eyes turned
red with the desire to kill. It looked as if she had lost her own
will and rationality.</p>
<p>The head that had been cut open was already recovering, and her
broken bones were regenerating swiftly. The creature screamed as it
came back for Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wasn’t going to give her any chance this time. Han
Sen used his dagger to cut her body repeatedly. The vessels under
the geno armor were boiling, unleashing an unbelievable amount of
power.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out a hand and grabbed the female Feather by her
head. He chopped off her gold wings, one by one.</p>
<p>The Feather tried to bite into Han Sen’s arms, but Han Sen just
moved them even more violently. With his dagger, Han Sen lopped her
head clean off.</p>
<p>The body, minus its head, still came for Han Sen, though. And
the bodiless head opened its mouth, still trying to bite into his
arm.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood was surging like a volcano. It carried enough
power for him to dismember the female completely, and finally kill
her.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Baron hunted; xenogeneic gene found. Gold Feather
Witch xenogeneic beast soul obtained.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the announcement play.</p>
