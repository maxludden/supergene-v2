<p>Han Sen started to pull back to say something, but he saw Fox
Queen’s tail begin to wave back and forth. Afterimages of the tail
became substance chains, and it suddenly looked as if there were
nine tails swinging in the air. The tails swept up and around Fox
Queen and Han Sen, trapping them inside it like a cage.</p>
<p>Fox Queen’s eyes flashed silver, and strange silver symbols
flared to life across her snow-white skin. They looked like
tattoos, not on her skin but inside it.</p>
<p>At the same time, power that gushed like spring water rushed
between Fox Queen’s lips and straight into Han Sen’s mouth.</p>
<p>A cool air surged through Han Sen’s body. His cells felt as if
they had been thoroughly cleansed by a mountain spring.</p>
<p>Once that cool power blended into Han Sen’s cells, his body
underwent some peculiar changes. A perfume that he could barely
smell wafted from his body, its fragrance tickling the tip of his
nose.</p>
<p>“I have given you the secret Fox technique. Your body now
possesses the Nine Spin Fox power. If you follow my will and use
the Nine Spin Fox Perfume skill, you can temporarily wield the
powers of a Fox.” Fox Queen’s lips remained locked with Han Sen’s,
but her voice sounded in Han Sen’s head.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded slightly. Following Fox Queen’s will, he let the
power course through him.</p>
<p>Fox Queen sent more and more of that power into Han Sen’s body.
Han Sen got the power running, and it began to build. The perfume
grew stronger and stronger. It felt as if Han Sen was swimming in a
sea of flowers.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the perfume in Han Sen’s body became lighter
until it disappeared, and he could no longer smell it at all. A
minute later, the perfume was coming back.</p>
<p>The scent kept cycling between strong and light, and it did this
nine times. Fox Queen’s power inside Han Sen had become very
strong, and it combined with Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>A very light silver symbol appeared on Han Sen’s skin. It looked
similar to the symbols on Fox Queen, but it wasn’t as lustrous as
those. Han Sen’s symbol was quite dull, by comparison.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the silver flower symbol appear on Han Sen, Fox
Queen felt incredibly happy.</p>
<p>She had thought that Han Sen didn’t have any Fox blood, so she
only expected him to absorb around twenty percent of the power she
poured into the Nine Spin Fox Perfume.</p>
<p>But for some reason, Han Sen had been able to absorb every ounce
of the Nine Spin Fox Perfume energy she had sent to him. Because of
this, the Fox marking had appeared on his skin. Fox Queen was
surprised, to say the least.</p>
<p>“Weird. Does his body contain some sort of Fox blood or
something? How is he capable of supporting a Fox symbol?” Fox Queen
was confused.</p>
<p>But after a second or so, Fox Queen made a decision. She had
originally planned to stop the skill here, but instead, she kept it
running.</p>
<p>The silver markings on Fox Queen’s skin continued to expand. The
symbols slowly connected with each other, forming a nine-tailed
silver fox upon her back.</p>
<p>That symbol was so strange. It was like a living fox lying
across Fox Queen’s pale skin. It had small silver eyes, and they
peered right at Han Sen.</p>
<p>The more power Fox Queen gave Han Sen, the brighter his silver
pattern became. The silver symbols flashed continually, and just
like Fox Queen’s, they started to connect. They soon started to
resemble a nine-tailed fox that shone like burnished silver.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if all the energy inside him was rushing crazily
around his body. He felt like a wild horse without its reins.
Things were slipping out of his control.</p>
<p>“Fox Queen, stop! I cannot take it anymore.” Han Sen spoke to
Fox Queen through his will.</p>
<p>Fox Queen ignored him. Her arms were wrapped around Han Sen’s
neck, and her legs tightened around his waist. They were still
kissing as silver substance chains thrust deep into Han Sen’s
body.</p>
<p>“Fox Queen! What are you doing?” Han Sen demanded with his will.
His face hardened as he began to struggle against her, but Fox
Queen’s power was able to keep his suppressed.</p>
<p>Fox Queen finally responded. She smiled. She didn’t move her
lips, but her voice played inside Han Sen’s ears all the same. “I
never thought this body of yours possessed such extraordinary
talent. You can generate the Fox markings. I have used all my Nine
Spin Fox Perfume to help you, so that your body can naturally
become a Nine Spin Fox Body. It will be great for you, and it will
allow you to control the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror far more
easily.”</p>
<p>“Fox Queen, do you really think I am three years old?” Han Sen
growled through his will.</p>
<p>Fox Queen’s smile widened. “My good brother, why don’t you just
do as you are told? I will not treat you poorly.”</p>
<p>As Fox Queen’s words echoed through Han Sen’s head, a silver
substance chain drifted into Han Sen’s mouth. Han Sen’s Nine Spin
Fox power was becoming stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>The power was almost out of Han Sen’s control. It followed Fox
Queen’s will, running amok inside his body. The nine-tailed silver
fox symbol on Han Sen’s skin brightened, and it looked as if it was
going to come alive.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen was certain that Fox Queen wasn’t trying to give him
a technique; she was attempting to gain control of his body.</p>
<p>Fox Queen wouldn’t admit to that, of course. She ignored Han
Sen’s attempts to reason with her as she continued pouring her
power inside him.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen believed, Fox Queen was trying to refine Han
Sen’s body into a Nine Spin Fox clone. If she did that, she would
be able to control Han Sen completely. There would be no need for
the precariousness of cooperation. She could save herself the
trouble by controlling him directly.</p>
<p>This idea had come to her suddenly. She hadn’t expected Han
Sen’s body to be capable of generating a fox symbol. What she said,
in the beginning, wasn’t all a lie.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood Fox Queen, and he had never really trusted
her anyway. It didn’t matter if she was telling the truth or not,
though; he had a plan of his own.</p>
<p>If Fox Queen had just been honest and given Han Sen a new
ability as she promised, he would have been disappointed. If she
had done that, she wouldn’t have given Han Sen enough power to
fulfill his plan.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to use Fox Queen’s power to push his
self-universe cogwheel. That way, he could reach King class.</p>
<p>This was a big risk. But compared to attempting to subjugate
someone else’s power in the midst of a fight, this was far
easier.</p>
<p>Power that had been summoned for combat would be far more
destructive. Guiding it into his body without destroying himself
wouldn’t be easy. Controlling it with enough precision to move the
self-universe cogwheel would be even harder.</p>
<p>But now, Fox Queen was sending her power directly into Han Sen’s
body, and the power wasn’t intended to harm him. That saved him so
much trouble. Han Sen knew this was the best chance he would get to
borrow deified power.</p>
<p>When Han Sen felt that the necessary amount of energy had built
up within him, he didn’t hesitate. He engaged his Dongxuan Sutra.
He wanted to use that power to push his self-universe cogwheel.</p>
<p>Fox Queen felt something suddenly shift within Han Sen’s body.
She realized what Han Sen was trying to do, and she chuckled deep
in her throat.</p>
<p>“How ridiculous! Your weak powers cannot divert powers like
mine.”</p>
