<p>Burning Lamp had suffered thousands of years of pain, but he
refused to die. He wanted to remain long enough to see a new
deified amongst the Buddha. Seven Spirit was his greatest hope of
achieving this. But now that hope had been stolen from him, and it
was difficult to fathom just how angry Burning Lamp really was.</p>
<p>The Buddha commoners were in shock. It had been years since
Burning Lamp had been seen in person outside the palace, but now he
stood in the city beside the western door. Many Kings were
following him, also. The citizens of the city wondered what had
happened.</p>
<p>Han Sen had traveled through Heaven until he came to the shore
of a seemingly endless sea. A ship had been waiting beside the
waters; a ship made of golden leaves. He embarked and used it to
reach the other side.</p>
<p>On the other side, Han Sen found Speechless and others. There
were ten of them. A few of them were the people that had seen
following Speechless.</p>
<p>The music in Heaven had no effect on Han Sen. He had reached the
other end, and when he did, a Buddha light landed on him. It
energized Han Sen’s cells and reinforced his body.</p>
<p>That reinforcement was not enough for Han Sen to level up, but
he knew his body had gotten a lot stronger. It was quite effective,
whatever it was.</p>
<p>Speechless, seeing Han Sen reach the other end, was
flabbergasted. The others with her were surprised, too. They didn’t
expect anyone who wasn’t in their group to survive the trip.</p>
<p>Speechless Lady saw Han Sen approach, as if to speak with her,
but just before he did, a door appeared. The group traveled through
the door, and they ended up outside the western door in Buddha
City.</p>
<p>After they exited, they all took a step back in shock. Burning
Lamp Alpha and the other kings were all there. Speechless
immediately bowed before him, as did the others. They were all
shaking and trembling in fear.</p>
<p>“You may be excused,” Clear Sea King told the others. Burning
Lamp Alpha didn’t say anything, though. All he did was look at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>The others sighed in relief. They staggered away. The feeling of
pressure hadn’t been directed at them, but they still felt an
overwhelming sense of danger, and that was enough to scare
them.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned when he saw this. He knew the Buddha wouldn’t be
very forgiving, but he didn’t expect Burning Lamp Alpha himself to
appear.</p>
<p>Clear Sea King, seeing Han Sen, asked coldly, “Han Sen, why did
you kill Seven Spirit?”</p>
<p>After hearing that, everyone looked at each other in shock.
Everyone knew of Seven Spirit and his incredible talent.</p>
<p>“Why are you saying that? When did I kill him?” Han Sen
responded without an ounce of fear.</p>
<p>“You’re denying it?” the Buddha shouted. They were very
angry.</p>
<p>There was such a frightening pressure being thrown about, and
the people nearby were having difficulty keeping their breathing
steady. But Han Sen, the one under the force of those questions,
was wholly calm. He said, “You say I killed Seven Spirit? Okay, and
where’s the evidence of that?”</p>
<p>“We will have evidence. You cannot deny this wrongdoing.” Clear
Sea King didn’t want to let Han Sen talk. He flapped his sleeves,
and they became large pieces of cloth that tried to cover Han
Sen.</p>
<p>In the comer of a pavilion, Yisha’s eyes looked cold. The white
chess piece in her hand snapped in half. She stood up, her back as
straight as a knife.</p>
<p>The old man across from her was shocked. He placed a black chess
piece down on the board. The pavilion was in a strange dimension,
separate from reality and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“Buddha Mark, our friendship ends here,” Yisha said, her voice
cold. She slashed through the air and broke through the dimensional
fabric. Then she leaped into the sky.</p>
<p>In front of the western door, Clear Sea King’s sleeve was going
to wrap around Han Sen. But just as it was about to snare him, a
purple knifelight ripped through the sleeve.</p>
<p>Yisha appeared directly in front of Han Sen, her posture as
straight and regal as a queen’s. She looked emotionlessly at the
Buddhas before her, and when she spoke, there was no fear in her
voice.</p>
<p>“Burning Lamp, you are deified! But if you do not give me an
explanation for this transgression today, I will see to the
destruction of the Buddha Kingdom myself. I will destroy everything
here without remorse.” Yisha spoke slowly, staring directly at
Burning Lamp Alpha.</p>
<p>“How dare you, Knife Queen! Just because the Buddha have a fond
relationship with the Rebate, it does not mean you can be
disrespectful towards Alpha.” The Buddha Kings all started to
yell.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp raised his head and said coldly, “Your student
killed my student. Isn’t that enough for you to know?” “Evidence,”
Yisha responded simply.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp looked at Yisha, and he moved his hand. It was not
clear how he moved it, and it did not seem to be aimed at anyone in
particular. But somehow, Han Sen had been grabbed from behind
her.</p>
<p>Yisha looked cold, and she slashed towards Burning Lamp
Alpha.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp Alpha did not look at Yisha, yet he moved his palm
perfectly in time with her attack. Yisha’s strike tore through the
air, but it was like it needed to travel countless miles before it
could hope to reach that hand. It was close, and yet so far.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp’s other hand, which had grabbed hold of Han Sen,
was shining. It covered Han Sen’s body, and then all of a sudden,
Han Sen was turned into an ant.</p>
<p>After Han Sen was transformed into an ant, Burning Lamp Alpha
threw him back to Yisha. He coldly said, “For all our sakes, I will
allow him to live. But you better watch it.”</p>
<p>After that, the Kings walked away with their light.</p>
<p>As Yisha held Han Sen’s ant body carefully, she kept clutching
her knife. She didn’t try another attack, though, because she knew
it would be pointless.</p>
<p>“I’ll be useless until I become deified. Being half-deified is
just a joke.” Yisha gritted her teeth, gripped the ant more firmly,
and flew away.</p>
<p>The other races had seen what Burning Lamp did, and they were
shocked. Even a half-deified elite like Yisha could not do anything
to oppose him. She could not protect her student from being turned
into an ant, either. It was scary to think about.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been shocked, too. His power had been too weak for
him to even consider fighting back. And then Burning Lamp had
simply turned him into an ant. He really did feel like he had been
turned into an ant, too; it didn’t appear to be some sort of
illusion.</p>
