    <p>
      The strength of the silver beetles was only their number and sharp mouths.
      In fact, their strength was not too impressive.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, wearing the golden armor and gargoyle glyph, Han Sen could
      completely block out the silver beetles. In addition, he was covered all
      over, so there was no gap where the silver beetles could approach him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the silver beetles chased humans away, the creatures were also
      chased away. Taking advantage of the mess, he could enter the royal spirit
      and maybe there was a chance for him to get the spirit stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his armor and glyph, sneaking into the shelter in the
      mess.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just when he approached the battlefield, waves of silver beetles had come
      to him, drowning Han Sen with their little bodies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt the crackling outside his armor as the silver beetle was
      trying to bite his armor. However, because of the double berserk
      sacred-blood beast souls, even their sharp mouths could not hurt the armor
      at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt reassured and marched toward the royal spirit in the sea of
      beetles. Under the cover of the silver beetles, no one was able to notice
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside the royal spirit, Han Sen jumped over the wall and entered the
      royal spirit that looked like a cosmopolitan.
    </p>

    <p>
      The majority of the creatures had been scared away by the silver beetles.
      There were obviously less creatures in the royal shelter, but their number
      was still astonishing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the silver-haired spirit girl walking toward the center of the
      shelter from afar, Han Sen gritted his teeth and chased in her direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were no silver beetles inside the shelter, but a lot of creatures
      rushed to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not linger but spread his nightmare wings, dodging the
      majority of the creatures and went toward the spirit girl.
    </p>

    <p>
      The weird birds and black winged beasts in the sky came toward Han Sen.
      Han Sen flapped his wings and dodged the block of the beasts and birds
      like a butterfly, thanks to the speed of the berserk sacred-blood wings.
      He quickly reached where the spirit girl was standing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit girl had already come to a large ancient architecture. Feeling
      the turmoil in the sky, she looked back standing on the stairs. Seeing Han
      Sen who was in the sky, her silver pupils contracted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even he was covered in armor, the silver-haired girl still recognized Han
      Sen who had once killed her. She was not depending on her eyesight, but
      her scent that she left on Han Sen&#8217;s body when he killed her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her face turned cold. The silver-haired girl waved her staff and the birds
      and beasts rushed to Han Sen. A dual-headed silver bird and a black bull
      with wings also rushed to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not mind ordinary birds and beasts, because they were much
      slower and weaker than Han Sen. Han Sen could kill them as he wanted.
      However, the silver bird and flying bull were obviously both sacred-blood
      creatures. They blocked Han Sen&#8217;s way among other creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      After doing that, the silver-haired spirit girl did not mind Han Sen
      anymore and continued to go inside the mysterious architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the spirit girl went inside the architecture, two identical black
      snakes were climbing on the columns at the gate, flicking out their
      tongues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had seen one of the black snake before. As time when the spirits
      were attacking the Starwheel Shelter, she brought that black snake, which
      was also a sacred-blood creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How come there are so many sacred-blood creatures in this royal
      shelter?&#8221; Han Sen frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not all the royal shelters had a large number of sacred-blood creatures.
      The number of sacred-blood creatures in a royal shelter depended on the
      size of the shelter, the number of sacred-blood creatures nearby, and the
      spirit&#8217;s ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      In terms of both size and number of sacred-blood creatures, this royal
      shelter was exceptional, which showed how strong the silver-haired girl
      was.
    </p>

    <p>
      To go back or forward was an impending decision that Han Sen must make.
      There were so many creatures here that Han Sen could not be trapped. Once
      he was trapped, he could never escape again.
    </p>

    <p>In just one second, Han Sen had decided.</p>

    <p>
      He had already entered the shelter, so it was the perfect opportunity, and
      he had no reason to go out.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the three forces could not take down this royal shelter when they
      united, since most sacred-blood creatures were not even inside the shelter
      at this point, he would never have an opportunity to try again if he
      missed this opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      With his eyes cold, Han Sen was calculating all the moves and trajectories
      of the creatures he was seeing. In his mind there was a holographic image
      and a route that would take him inside the ancient architecture.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Flapping his wings, Han Sen made a dive, avoiding the silver bird and
      flying bull.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because he went slower, many creatures on the floor started to
      jump at him, throwing themselves at Han Sen who was flying low.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remaining calm, Han Sen landed on an architecture. When he flew, he
      avoided the snaps of the creatures on the land and flew up again.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the sky, the dual-headed silver bird and other creatures rushed over
      again. Han Sen landed again, changing his position continuously and
      dodging the attacks from different creatures, going toward the ancient and
      mysterious architecture like crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no way to block him. Han Sen moved quickly among the
      architectures, flying up from time to time. He perfectly used the space
      between the architectures and the creatures themselves, going to the
      ancient architecture at last. The creatures were always a bit too late,
      not formulating any threat to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      That included the two sacred-blood creatures, because they never stopped
      Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because he was using the terrain and the creatures, Han Sen did
      not go straight but made a huge circle in order to arrive at the ancient
      architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two black snakes had come down from the giant columns, blocking the
      closed stone gate. They opened their mouths and issued screams at Han Sen,
      bearing there frightening fans, looking rather scary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not pause and went up the stairs, rushing at the two black
      snakes. Behind him were all kinds of fierce creatures, looking like ghosts
      from hell. They followed Han Sen and tried to take him down.
