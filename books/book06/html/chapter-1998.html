<p>Han Sen slashed at Lone Bamboo, but Lone Bamboo did not dodge.
He reached out his hand and grabbed Ghost Teeth Knife’s blade.
Blood poured from his hand, but he wasn’t planning on letting
go.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled back, but he couldn’t pull Ghost Teeth Knife out
of Lone Bamboo’s grasp. Having opened his Sky eye, Lone Bamboo was
now far stronger.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could react again, Lone Bamboo’s Sky eye fired a
red light. It was coming toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to block the red light with his left hand, but
Lone Bamboo was also swinging a jade sword at him.</p>
<p>There was nothing he could do, so Han Sen had to react quickly.
He let his knife go and evade the red light and the jade sword.
When he swept past Lone Bamboo, Han Sen punched his opponent’s
wrist, knocking the jade sword out of his hand. He moved to grab
it.</p>
<p>The knife and the sword had lost their respective masters. Yun
Changkong and the elders said, “Oh, no!”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Yun Suyi asked, suddenly looking nervous.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong frowned and said, “Lone Bamboo is affected by a
demon. He will want to destroy everything. And Han Sen’s Ghost
Teeth Knife is an evil knife that wishes to destroy everything,
too. Han Sen’s Teeth Knife knifemind was triggered. It has a very
destructive element. While it is held by Lone Bamboo, it makes the
demon even angrier. And…”</p>
<p>“And what?” Yun Suyi quickly asked.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong had a wry smile. “And Lone Bamboo’s jade sword is
not a holy weapon. It is just a practice sword made from a Xuan
Jade Spirit. Aside from being sturdy, it is practically useless.
Han Sen has exchanged his King class weapon that aligned with his
Teeth Knife knifeskills for a simple practice sword. And on top of
that, Lone Bamboo has his eye open. I don’t think Han Sen can keep
up much longer.”</p>
<p>“How… Lone Bamboo’s jade sword… How can it be a practice sword?”
Yun Suyi and the others looked at it in shock. “Hmph.” Yun
Changkong sighed and did not explain.</p>
<p>After Lone Bamboo gripped Ghost Teeth Knife, the evil presence
rose up, stoking the murderous power within him. He looked like a
demon that wished destruction on all the world.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>He slashed towards Han Sen. The knifelight looked like a demon,
coming to consume Han Sen. It looked like Teeth Knife, minus its
Teeth power. It did have Ghost Teeth Knife powers, though, and the
depression powers as well. It was more powerful now than it had
been when Han Sen was using it.</p>
<p>“Palace Leader, are you not going to intervene? Han Sen is not
going to be able to withstand that strike. They will both be
destroyed,” said a woman, frowning at Sky Palace leader.</p>
<p>The leader squinted his eyes and said, “There is no rush.”</p>
<p>The lady felt saddened by this, and she said, “Lone Bamboo is
your student, and Han Sen is one of Yisha’s people. If anything
happens, you can be the one to inform Yisha herself. You can do
anything you wish, since you aren’t afraid of her.”</p>
<p>In the arena, Han Sen was wielding the jade sword. His swordmind
exploded. He attacked the scary knifemind. The sword skills were
those Lone Bamboo had just used.</p>
<p>The weapons had swapped owners, and the skills had been swapped
now, too. The fight continued, with no winner seeming likely to
emerge.</p>
<p>“Shit! Brother Lone Bamboo can use knives? And Han Sen can use
swords, as well? This is strange! He can’t be like Lone Bamboo,
having experienced lifetimes of nightmares, right?”</p>
<p>“He’s the only one who can fight Lone Bamboo like this.”</p>
<p>Even King class sorts like Yun Changkong were surprised. They
hadn’t expected that Han Sen would be able to use the practice
sword effectively against Lone Bamboo. His swordskills were very
scary, and they appeared even stronger than when he used
knifeskills. Unfortunately, his powers were a little suppressed by
Lone Bamboo. He was still at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo, with his Sky eye open and an activated Ghost Teeth
Knife, made Han Sen’s Earl body look meager.</p>
<p>Han Sen was being careful. He knew he could not use super king
spirit here, and he could not use his own swordskills. That was why
he had to use Lone Bamboo’s swordskills to fight.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned the ant queen’s mark, then he summoned the
rabbit shoes and red mink glove. Now, Han Sen’s situation was not
as dire.</p>
<p>Han Sen stabilized the fight, then turned his mind back to the
battle.</p>
<p>The battle was so breath-taking that the students were
forgetting to breathe. Everyone just stared at Han Sen and Lone
Bamboo. They did not want to miss a single moment.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo’s body was becoming stronger. Ghost Teeth Knife was
triggered by his depression, and his full powers were showing.</p>
<p>Every slash was fueled with enough power to break space.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t wielding as much power, but his swordskills were
flawless. When he moved, the jade sword was like a lotus flower. He
was not at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>But Lone Bamboo’s depression was getting stronger, and it was
rising quickly. The presence surrounding him was becoming scarier.
Han Sen had to fight back Lone Bamboo and the depression at the
same time. He was feeling the pressure.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lone Bamboo fell back across the arena floor. He kept
his distance, and he just stared at Han Sen. His three eyes were
red, and they looked like those of a demon.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Lone Bamboo, but he did not feel happy. He
felt heavier.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo was holding Ghost Teeth Knife. His presence seemed
like it was on fire. He suddenly generated a real fire and blew it
up into the sky.</p>
<p>“Leveled up?” Yun Changkong and the others were shocked.</p>
<p>Many students in Sky Palace understood what was going on, as
well. Lone Bamboo, amidst all that was happening, was becoming a
Marquise.</p>
<p>The Sky eye was red, like a bloodied sea. When Lone Bamboo
changed, the Sky eye’s red sea began to deepen. A horrifying power
was swelling out of that eye, and it made Lone Bamboo’s body
stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife was becoming stronger, too. The knife was
wreathed in fire, like a demon roaring.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo leveled up to the rank of Marquise and broke the
equilibrium of the battlefield. An endless surge of power went into
Ghost Teeth Knife, making it stronger. The knife’s flames were like
a demon’s, and it covered the entire arena.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he could fight Lone Bamboo with his presence and
mind, but now he was under such suppression that he couldn’t even
release his powers.</p>
<p>The whole place was quiet. Only the flickering knife made a
sound, roaring like a bonfire.</p>
