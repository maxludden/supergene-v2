    <p>
      When Han Sen learned Ghost Eye was not from Outer Sky Shelter or Sacred
      Shelter, he was quite disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless, he had to accept the fight to meet his quota. After accepting,
      he went forward to meet his opponent-to-be on the designated battleground.
      There, Han Sen saw a panther with three eyes. Its coat of fur was dark and
      menacing, like the blackest coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther didn’t wait around long, and it ran forward. But it wasn’t
      doing so in hostility. As it ran, it immediately began to plead, “I’m not
      here to fight! Wait, hold up! I’m here to discuss an arrangement we might
      make. I’m not here to fight!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought he’d been given the opportunity to slay another super
      creature baby, but hearing this, he was a little taken aback. This was not
      what he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An arrangement? What arrangement?” Han Sen asked, checking the black
      panther out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are already in first place, and with your geno core having been
      reinforced nine times already, remaining in that lofty position is
      pointless. If you throw the match and put me in first place… I’ll be
      indebted and give you whatever you desire.” The panther spoke everything
      he could as swiftly as he was able to, in fear of being immediately
      killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther knew he wouldn’t have been able to take down Han Sen, so he
      was cleverly hoping to buy the first place off him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Define indebted. What are you willing to offer exactly?” Han Sen was
      willing to consider such a bargain, but only if the price was right. If
      the offer was worthless he’d simply kill the panther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although no deal had been struck, the panther was exuberantly happy just
      hearing he was willing to consider a deal. He feared he might have been
      killed without even being heard out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cost is of no concern, and we can pay you whatever sum you are willing to
      accept. Purgatory Shelter is a rather fancy place, I’ll have you know.
      Name your price and we won’t disappoint,” the panther said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What does Purgatory Shelter have to offer?” Han Sen was still willing to
      hear him out, but he pictured the panther as some rich tycoon’s kid who
      could buy his way up the ladder with daddy’s credit card.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All sorts! You can get a kilo of Ghost Eye Grass, Hellfire… You know,
      good stuff!” The panther proceeded to list a number of items, all with
      peculiar-sounding names Han Sen had never heard of before.
    </p>
    <p>“What about fruit that can provide super geno points?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “No, but we do have a Super Ghost Tree. Its fruit might bear super
      creature babies. Eating those are better than eating fruits,” the panther
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A fancy shelter doesn’t have any fruit? Is that what you’re telling me?”
      Han Sen didn’t believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther squirmed a little and said, “We did have fruit trees, but they
      were recently harvested and eaten.”
    </p>
    <p>“Then what about super geno cores?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      The panther receded into worried thought for a moment. “Don’t you need to
      kill an emperor or super creature for something like that? I have much
      respect for you, sir, but even if Purgatory Shelter had one, it would not
      be offered up in a trade such as this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther smiled queerly and uncomfortably. He knew he had to keep the
      offers coming, so he said, “But we do have gemstone geno cores available
      for trade.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew he wouldn’t be given a super geno core, but on the slim
      chance he might get one, he thought it was worth asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gemstone geno core? Let’s see… let’s see… useless.” Han Sen exaggerated
      his disappointment in the offer, and then went on to ask, “But for the
      simple sake of asking, what do they do? Do these gemstone geno cores have
      extra special properties or powers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, truthfully, wouldn’t mind a gemstone geno core. Remaining in
      first place wasn’t much of a concern for him, and swapping it out for a
      few goodies was a worthwhile thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther responded to his query and answered, “Oh, the powers of these
      gemstone geno cores are unbelievably good! You’ll be hard-pressed to find
      better elsewhere. I promise you, if you accept one of these, you won’t be
      disappointed!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther summoned a geno core for Han Sen to see. He couldn’t display
      the powers it possessed due to the rules of the realm. But even though its
      powers had been silenced, Han Sen could get a good look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it didn’t tell him much. All in all, it looked rather unspectacular.
      Han Sen could see it was a blue jewel of sorts, and had no clue what it
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther was ready to explain what it was, however. “It is a
      dark-element geno core called Ghost Armor. It has a very high defense stat
      against elemental damage. You’d have to use it to see what the armor
      actually looks like.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could imagine the usefulness such armor might provide. It was a
      situational armor, for sure, though. Armor that was particularly effective
      against elemental damage had almost zero properties for defending against
      raw physical damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Style was another concern for Han Sen, so it was unfortunate he was not
      able to see what it might look like on him while he was in the Geno Core
      Storage.
    </p>
    <p>“What was that tree you mentioned earlier?” Han Sen went on to ask.</p>
    <p>
      The panther summoned the seed of such a tree and said, “I can’t move the
      tree, but I can give you the seed of one. You should take it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very nice. Pantherboy, I think you are a good man.” Han Sen accepted the
      seed and was immediately able to sense the lifeforce within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you. And what’s more, you should get a feel for this.” The panther
      then proceeded to hand over the Ghost Armor geno core. Han Sen accepted
      it, and it was as described. It was a gemstone dark geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can give you first place for now. But once you’ve reinforced, you’re
      going to have to challenge me and hand it back over,” Han Sen stated.
    </p>
    <p>“That is no problem,” the panther agreed.</p>
    <p>
      “Congratulations; you have obtained the first rank in the bronze geno core
      Geno Core Storage,” Han Sen squinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have my thanks, good sir!” The panther was clearly struggling to
      contain his excitement and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you ever have the hankering to strike more business deals, look me
      up.” Han Sen waved and immediately left the Geno Core Storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s rank then dropped down to second. In first place was Ghost Eye.
      Han Sen looked at his crystal egg, just to double check, and he noticed
      how he still had the nine reinforcements. Nothing had been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the shelter, Han Sen donned his new armor and started casting
      dark-element abilities. A blue shroud enveloped Han Sen’s skin, which then
      projected outwards like a holographic armor set around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The armor was true to its name. It was not a solid-looking armor set, and
      Han Sen looked more like a transparent phantom.
