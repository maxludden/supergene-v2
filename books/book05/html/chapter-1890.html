<p>Han Sen thought about it, though, and he decided that the bike was probably quite suitable for someone like Wang Yuhang. If the man could use it to escape things chasing him, then it would be useful enough. Perhaps when the armament evolved some more, it would develop other abilities.</p>

<p>Yisha learned nothing from her trip to Planet Crooked Rock. All the factions were now in search of Purgatory Heaven, but no one had turned up any leads yet.</p>

<p>Han Sen was going to take Wang Yuhang to explore the Red Mist Valley, but Yisha gave Han Sen a call and told him they needed to talk about something important.</p>

<p>Han Sen went to meet with her, all the while thinking over any trace of evidence he might have left suggesting what had really gone down on Planet Crooked Rock. He didn’t think he had, though.</p>

<p>When they met, she said, “Buddha Ambassador will be visiting Narrow Moon, and there will be a meeting. If you have nothing important that requires your immediate attendance, I suggest you attend,” Yisha said.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt some relief, hearing what she wanted. She didn’t want to talk about Planet Crooked Rock and the missing Icebird Duke. Knowing this, he felt much more at ease.</p>

<p>“Queen, why would the Buddha visit Narrow Moon? What is all this going to be about?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>Yisha said, “The Rebate are quite friendly with the Buddha. We are close allies. The meeting is a formality to sustain our friendship and exchange geno arts. The people who can join the get-together are usually the best of the best.” Yisha paused for a moment, before going on to say, “The Rebate usually send in members of the Moon Garden. You may not be one of them, but you can still observe the proceedings. The geno arts of the Buddhas are fairly unique, and it might be quite useful for you to learn them. Even if you cannot try them out, you can watch them, at least.”</p>

<p>Yes, my queen; I will take a look.” Han Sen did not know what the point of going there actually was, but if Yisha was telling him he should go, he thought there had to be more to it.</p>

<p>But Yisha didn’t explain any further, so he didn’t ask.</p>

<p>Yisha spoke about the Buddha, though. And it jogged Han Sen’s memory about something.</p>

<p>After Buddha King was killed by Guya, Han Sen had found two items. One was a Buddha necklace, and the other was a scroll.</p>

<p>The scroll was scrawled in the text of the Buddha. After its translation, Han Sen learned that it was about a geno art called Unlimited Sutra.</p>

<p>Han Sen checked it out. The main part of the text pertained to evolving, which was practically useless where Han Sen was concerned. He wasn’t interested in a technique that could generate a geno armor.</p>

<p>What did interest him, though, were the additions of smaller techniques around the main body of text. It was interesting, and it helped Han Sen understand more about the Buddha.</p>

<p>The Buddha necklace was a high-class treasure, but Han Sen could not use it. Maybe the user required a certain blood lineage or a special power of some sort.</p>

<p>Yisha was allowing Han Sen to participate in the event, and Han Sen thought it might give him a look into Unlimited Sutra. That would only further his knowledge about the Buddha.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>After Han Sen left, Yisha picked up a book and got to reading it. She was in a foul mood. Icebird Duke was still missing, someplace on Planet Crooked Rock. And Yisha had no clue whether she was alive or dead.</p>

<p>The spots for properly taking part in the event were only available to members of the Moon Garden. But now, the ten Kings of Narrow Moon—aside from two Kings that did not have any students of their own—could allow their students and children to attend.</p>

<p>It was only Yisha’s student that wasn’t allowed a spot in the proceedings. Hers was relegated to spectating. It made her feel quite poorly.</p>

<p>Yisha still allowed Han Sen to go there, though, because she wanted Han Sen to learn more.</p>

<p>There was something else that made her eager for him to go, too. Han Sen was not a member, so if he was challenged by one of the Buddha students, the challenge couldn’t happen.</p>

<p>Han Sen went back to the base and got back to reading Unlimited Sutra. Then, he gave Wang Yuhang a call. He also called the others and told them all to rendezvous at Red Mist Valley.</p>

<p>The mist in Red Mist Valley was thick. It could be clearly seen from as far as ten miles away. The mist resembled fiery clouds.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was Planet Eclipse. The magnetic storms and vortexes in the sky were scary. No one could see such things from the sky, and so many of the planet’s secrets had yet to be discovered.</p>

<p>“Little Uncle, all of this hinges on you,” Han Sen told Wang Yuhang as he pointed down into the valley.</p>

<p>Wang Yuhuang was wearing the Marquise armor, and he confidently gave Han Sen a don’t worry gesture. “I will handle this. I’m good at this sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang summoned his bike and rode it towards the valley.</p>

<p>He didn’t speed straight in. At first, he skirted the entrance before spinning around. He shouted out towards the valley, “Everyone hanging out in this mist, listen! Grampa Wang is here! If you guys don’t come out of here, I’ll destroy you!”</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang shouted, and then a sudden chorus of screams erupted from within the mist. And then, many fiery shadows started to emerge, coming straight for him.</p>

<p>“Mama mia!” Wang Yuhang put his foot down on the pedal and escaped with his bike. The bike’s speed was very good for a Baron armament, but compared to the fiery shadows, it was actually quite slow. He had only made it a few meters before the shadows had caught up with him.</p>

<p>There was a pang and Wang Yuhang crashed his bike. He was sent flying a dozen meters before he hit the ground. He rolled quite a bit before coming to a total stop.</p>

<p>Luckily, Wang Yuhang was wearing the Marquise armor. If he hadn’t, he’d have been a dead man by now.</p>

<p>But even though he had the armor, he still felt very dizzy. He picked himself up off the ground, and soon enough, a fiery shadow was before him again. It knocked him away once more.</p>

<p>Han Sen, Gu Qingcheng, and Xie Qing King finally noticed that the fiery shadow was a beast shrouded in red mist. It looked a mink, with three eyes.</p>

<p>The red mist looked as if it was actually under the red beast’s control. Every time the creature attacked, though, it left marks across Wang Yuhang’s armor.</p>

<p>“Quick! I’m going to die!” Wang Yuhang screamed as the creature happily tossed him around. The beast could not break the Marquise armor, but the force with which it shook him was still enough to have him spewing blood.</p>

<p>Han Sen put on his rabbit shoes. Without hesitation, he leaped towards the little monster and swung his Ghost Teeth Knife, which was swirling with purple light.</p>

<p>There was no one else around, so he did not have to hide anything. He used his Jadeskin’s godlight—which was Viscount class—with the Ghost Teeth Knife’s knifemind, and struck the beast. It cut through the shadow and left behind a cleft on the creature’s skin.</p>
