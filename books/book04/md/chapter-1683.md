  1683 Testing the Gun

“Tell my Dad not to worry when you go back. I will deal with it.” After that, Han Sen moved closer to Blind Man and said quietly, “There is something I need you to tell my Dad, too. Tell him not to generate geno armor, and if possible, come and meet me. There is something important I wish to tell him.”

“Okay, I will tell him. I will return and prepare. As expected, we will be cutting all ties with God’s Organization.” Blind Man turned around and left.

Han Sen did not stop the man from departing. He knew Blind Man had come here quickly, and he would be found if he stayed long. There was no point in him staying, and it was more important for him to go and see Han Yufei.

After Blind Man left, Han Sen got back to practicing The Story of Genes. That was because The Story of Genes was the fastest to learn, and it would help him buff up his white crystal armor.

Normal geno armor elites in the Alliance were using other people’s geno armors, and thus, they could not use the full extent of their power.

Tina, Snake Witch, and Black Tiger were unable to make full use of the geno armor’s power because it did not belong to them. It couldn’t assimilate with them completely. At most, they were only able to use half of what was achievable with the armorsets.

Stay Up Late was the only being that had a self geno armor that Han Sen knew about, and the white geno armor Han Sen had would not be sufficient for beating him.

But even so, Han Sen would be considerably better than other geno armor elites.

His fitness was worse than before, and he had yet to mature again. He was currently weaker than the average demigod.

But it was different when he was wearing a geno armor. The Story of Genes might have come from the crystallizers, but it made Han Sen a better fit for the white armor.

The more he practiced The Story of Genes, the better-fitting it became.

So far, Han Sen had a 60% match with the armorset. And that meant he could use 60% of its power. Other people could only use 50%, so he had an advantage.

Han Sen wouldn’t be able to improve The Story of Genes much in such a short time, but he kept on practicing anyway. Every little bit helped.

While Han Sen was practicing, Little Angel was doing something with her hands.

If you looked closely, you could see Little Angel was actually handling a small SMG.

Someone had left it behind in the buildings when the fight against the Black Tiger was underway, and Little Angel had shown enough interest to pick it up and keep it.

She found out what it was through Skynet, and she eagerly wished to play with it. She turned off the safety and took aim at a building sign. She wanted to shoot it.

Pang!

A bullet struck the sign, knocking the sign off the building. The noise immediately scared Han Sen and Littleflower.

“Where did you get that from?” Han Sen asked. He had originally thought that enemies were attacking, but he was relieved to find that it was just Little Angel discharging the weapon.

Ji Yanran had bought the land around them for miles and miles, so there was no one else there. She wouldn’t be hurting anyone by accident

“I found it and picked it up,” Little Angel answered, right before she pulled the trigger again. A bullet was fired, then exploded when it landed.

“There is no one around, and we bought this place. We should not waste it,” Han Sen said, eyeing the buildings that were in rubble around him.

Little Angel then aimed the weapon at Han Sen. It made him quickly get out of the way, but then he remembered that with his fitness, he did not have to be so afraid.

Little Angel spun the gun around and offered it to Han Sen. “Shoot me.”

“Why?” Han Sen asked, not accepting the gun.

“To see how powerful it is,” Little Angel said calmly.

“There is no need for you to use your body to find that out.” Han Sen wasn’t really sure what to say or do.

“Should I use yours instead?” Little Angel asked with seriousness.

Han Sen didn’t think they needed to use anyone’s body for the test. But he had never blocked a bullet before, and he realized that he was quite curious.

“Sure! Give it a go.” Han Sen put Littleflower down on the table. He floated in the air, waiting for Little Angel to try to shoot him with the SMG.

To survive being shot by an SMG, you’d need a fitness level of above five thousand. His fitness was weaker now than it had been for most of his time in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, but he had at least 10k. He could definitely block the bullet.

For safety, Han Sen gathered power in his hands. He wanted to get shot in his hand first.

Little Angel was wearing her white battlesuit, and after swiftly aiming the gun, she fired his way. A circular bullet came flying toward Han Sen. He raised his hand and an explosion erupted. Then, the light was gone.

Han Sen’s hand was a little red, but he didn’t feel any pain. At the most, it felt like his hand had just been slapped, and that was that.

Little Angel fired at Han Sen a few times, taking aim at different regions of his body. Han Sen knew she wanted to find out the power of the weapon she was using, so he didn’t block now. He just let the bullets pelt him.

The bullets weren’t enough to break his body, though, and more than anything, it felt as if they were just tickling him. Little Angel was disappointed by the power, so she just threw the weapon away. While Skynet may have said it was good, it was little more than a toy gun for someone like her.

Han Sen drifted toward the ground, thinking about Little Angel’s interest in the gun. But suddenly, something about his body felt very wrong. His back was on fire.

Han Sen’s face changed. He looked at his back and saw his Nine-Life Cat tattoo was burning. A red light shone from his back, unhindered by the clothes he wore.

“What is that?” Han Sen frowned.

Boom!

The next second, the light became stronger until his clothes were nothing but tatters. The tattoo on his back now resembled a swirling black vortex. But before he could react, the suction pulled him right inside.
