  “I can’t believe this. Dragon One was killed like that… The Dragon… It is game over…” The woman’s voice sounded extremely weird. Although no one could see Demon Alpha’s body in space, her vision was still scouring that portion of the empty. It was like a body that looked like a Demon and a ghost was in front of the woman.

Sky Palace Leader sighed and said, “Success is brave, but there is also bravery in failure. I hope the Dragons will be able to overcome this loss. I hope they do not sink in the river of time.”

“The Dragons used all their power to produce this latest Dragon leader, but he was easily cut up like that in space. The Dragons are in danger…” The woman shook her head with a wry smile. “Who is this Demon Alpha anyway? She has such a scary power. With the resources the Demons have, there is no way they could have made someone like that.”

“This era is messed up.” Sky Palace Leader did not answer her. He looked into space, which was far away.

“Interesting… Very interesting… Although I could not see 100 Dragons coming out together, it was still amazing.” God held his hands and laughed. He looked satisfied.

“Do you know this Demon Alpha? How could she possess such scary powers?” Han Sen asked.

God shook his head. “Did I not tell you that God does not know everything? I am just like you. I only know what I see. I have never seen Demon Alpha before, so I do not know anything about her. There is one thing I know for sure.”

“What is that?” Han Sen asked.

“In her hands, that little dry bone knife was a god personality armament,” God said with certainty.

When Han Sen heard that, his expression changed. He thought, “If Demon Alpha really is Asura, then Ancient Devil and the Asura really did summon a dying god. Was that a God Spirit? With their power back then, how were they able to kill the God Spirit? Even though the God Spirit was heavily injured, it would have still been impossible. Their powers were on vastly different scales. There could have been no chance. Even God hides, so why would it let them kill him? They still did not have the power to kill a God Spirit… Does it mean that after Asura went to the universe, he killed the God Spirit and got the god personality armament?”

Han Sen could not guess the truth either, but he was really bothered by Demon Alpha looking just like Zero. “It looks like I need to find a chance to talk to Ancient Devil and Yasha again about what Asura really was.”

“What God Spirit’s god personality armament is that?” Han Sen asked.

“There are too many gods, and I do not remember all of them,” God said after touching his nose.

“Are there really that many gods?” Han Sen asked with confusion.

“There are not many real gods,” God said. After saying that, he did not say any more.

Demon Alpha’s fight shocked the whole universe. The Demons were famous among the higher races. Now, they had become the most famous in the whole universe. Everyone knew the Demons would rank up soon. It only depended on if Demon Alpha was daring enough to trigger the lantern fight.

With Demon Alpha’s power, the Demons could enter the top 10 races without any trouble.

The factions with a similar power to Demon Alpha were feeling as if they were facing a crisis. They thought Demon Alpha might destroy their race at any moment, or she might take their territory and xenogeneic space and pillage and plunder them for the Demons.

Some races saw the potential of an alliance. Many had already sent messengers to try and befriend the Demons.

All this did not really have a connection to Han Sen. After he became butterfly class, there were not enough resources to support his ascension to true god. He watched other fights alongside God.

Aside from the battle between Demon Alpha and Dragon One, there weren’t any more interesting battles. All the elites just fought to a point where a winner could be determined. Few dared to lose their lives in combat there.

What happened to Dragon One made every elite a whole lot more cautious. They would not underestimate any opponent they encountered.

Golden Growler was still winning like an invincible foe. The scary power he wielded had been agreed by most as the greatest. Most believed it was highly likely that Golden Growler would win the tournament. They thought he was even greater than Demon Alpha.

Sky Palace Leader and the Very High Leader did not need to be described. They just talked their enemies out of the way. One could not really tell how strong they were.

Han Sen cared about a guy called Lou Lie, who used his body to become a butterfly class xenogeneic. Most importantly, Han Sen found there was something familiar about him.

“Is he a member of Blood Legion?” Han Sen wondered.

“This Lou Lie is interesting,” God said with a smile.

“Why is he interesting?” Han Sen asked.

“He is better than you think,” God casually replied. “He is a real human.”

“Is he human? In that case, what are you going to do?” Han Sen forced his question to sound nonchalant, but he really wanted to know what God would do if he found out about another human.

“I do not plan on doing anything yet. I will keep watching the matches and wait for interesting spirits to fight each other.” God’s answer surprised him.

Han Sen thought humans were taboo for the universe. God found out Lou Lie was a human, so he wagered he would do something.

“Do not look at me like that. I am a God and not a crazy dog. Do you think I will bite whatever I see?” God laughed.

Han Sen looked at God and said, “I thought you treated humans differently.”

“I would treat them differently, but the geno god list plays by my rules. It would be lame of me to break my own rules.” After that, God looked like he was smiling, but he wasn’t smiling at Han Sen. “What about you? You treat humans differently too. Why do you disguise yourself as one?”

“I told you already that I am human. There is no pretending,” Han Sen said with a simple shrug of his shoulders.

The two of them were in-sync, so they stopped talking about it. They continued to watch the geno god list fights.

There were many scary elites in the universe. Han Sen thought the geno god list would be dominated by the three high races, but things really did not turn out that way. Many deified elites were from the three high races, but most of the deified elites were not from the three high races. There were many races Han Sen had never heard of before.

“It looks like the universe has many scary creatures hiding in it. I must be careful.” Han Sen had a look at his next opponent. It was a butterfly class Deep Abyss Knight. It was quite powerful. It crushed other xenogeneics of the same level to reach this round.

Han Sen thought, “Although he is powerful, I do not think he can challenge me.”

“The next few fights will be really boring. Would you like to play some chess?” God stretched as he spoke to Han Sen.

“Sure.” Han Sen did not decline. He wanted to play chess with God.

Although he always lost, his chess skills were improving because of these losses.

The game of chess was like a game of fighting. The more he improved in chess, the newer the areas and ideas Han Sen could learn for proper combat. That made him keep on wanting to play.

With Han Sen’s personality, if he did not win a round, he would not give up.

After dozens of heart-breaking rounds of chess, Han Sen’s next fight finally rolled around.

Han Sen stood up and said. “Keep the game going. We will continue when I return.” Their match was only halfway through. It looked as if he was going to win, so he wanted to quickly finish Deep Abyss Knight before continuing with God.

“OK. Good luck to you,” God said with a smile.

Han Sen accepted the geno god list invitation and went to the space battleground.
