Bai King had taken an outsider xenogeneic for a student. That news quickly spread across the universe. Upon hearing the news, the elites were shocked.

Most ordinary people thought Bai King must have gone crazy. Only scary people were able to understand what Bai King was going to do.

But that xenogeneic did not have any history or renown. It was only known that he was called Holy Baby. It was a child that looked around 5 to 6 years old. Aside from that, no one knew much about him. No one knew its specific race. No one knew where it came from.

Many elites were invited by Bai King to come and join the teacher ceremony. The people who went were keen to learn as much as they could about the Holy Baby xenogeneic. They were unable to determine his level or body, which shocked them even more.

Han Sen thought Bai King only wanted to take him as a student to trap him with the Extreme King and take his Space Garden.

After the teacher and student bond was made official, Bai King made no further mention of the Space Garden. He also did not stop Han Sen from going anywhere he desired. Even if he wanted to leave the realm of the Extreme King, Bai King was not going to stop him.

While not far away from the Extreme King's door, Han Sen was thinking about whether or not he should leave. He saw Mister White flying. "Mister White."

"The Extreme King is not a bad place," Mister White said. "Maybe you should stay for a while."

"Did you know I want to leave?" Han Sen did not know if Mister White knew who he was.

Mister White smiled. "If I did not know, why would I have sent you to the Law Hall?"

"So, did you know who I was a long time ago?" Han Sen was frozen. He suddenly realized Mister White had deliberately sent him to the Law Hall.

"How did you know that I would combine with the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye?" Han Sen asked with confusion.

"I did not know," Mister White said as he shook his head. "I was merely making a calculation. Although the wheels of fate forever change, it was an uncertain future I was able to predict. But there are always rules to help you avoid harm. As far as I was able to tell, going there would give you more lifeforce and provide a better result. I thought it was worth spurring you on to try it."

"Mister, you are a very daring person. What if I had been unable to combine with the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye?" Han Sen wanted to both laugh and cry at the same time.

Mister White smiled and said, "In this world, there is nothing absolute. If I did not have an absolute solution, then choosing the one with the likeliest outcome is usually what you should opt for. If you ever get unlucky and something bad falls upon you, it was meant to be. It was a part of life's design."

Han Sen knew what Mister White said made sense, but it was still kind of scary. "It is fortunate your predictions were not too bad. So, was making me stay in the Extreme King part of your prediction?"

"That was not something that needed to be predicted," Mister White said. "Bai King has accepted you, an outsider xenogeneic, as a student. That is quite the privilege. Now, in this universe, many scary existences have their eyes on you. They want to know why Bai King wanted to accept you as a student. No one will dare to do anything to you in the Extreme King. That much is certain. If you leave the Extreme King, I believe many people will want to kidnap you and take you for their own vile research."

"Bai King is so manipulative. He wants to tie me up like a figurehead for the ship that is the Extreme King." Han Sen finally understood.

"You underestimate Bai King," Mister White said. "If those were the only sorts of tricks he could do, he wouldn't be the man in charge of the Extreme King. The Extreme King wouldn't be what it is today, as sound as a pound, if that was all he could do. He must have a greater plan. For now, you and I are unable to see it."

"So, according to what you are telling me, I should willingly trap myself here," Han Sen said with a frown.

"Just sit and see what comes next." Mister White did not have a better idea either.

Han Sen had been thinking about things for a while. He now believed Mister White was likely correct. If Bai King had no plans of doing anything foul to him, staying with the Extreme King was likely a good idea.

"May I ask, how did your body become like this?" Mister White asked about the crux of Han Sen's troubles.

Han Sen wanted to ask Mister White about it too. He explained what happened when he became transmutation class.

After Mister White listened to his tale and though for a while, he said, "If you can practice four geno arts to deified class, that is already something quite incredible. If I have guessed things correctly, your leveling up is fine. It is normal here."

"If it is normal, how can I not make use of my power?" Han Sen asked.

"Do you know why the deified class is divided into primitive, transmutation, larvae, butterfly, and true god?" Mister White asked with a smile.

"I do not know," Han Sen said with a shake of his head.

"Actually, the whole process is about a true god being born," Mister White said. "The son of a true god will be born when they become a butterfly. Before that, they are something like a prototype. The body has not developed yet, so they cannot use their powers.

"In this universe, it is quite rare for one to become a true god. It mostly depends on the practice afterward, but this progress simulates the process of becoming a true god. That is why there are five classes. If I have guessed things correctly, when you became deified and your four genes became one, it had to mean your body would take on a different shape and appearance. It took on a status similar to a born true god. So, when you became a transmutation class, it meant your fetus was still growing. Maybe when you reach larvae or butterfly class and your god body has developed some more, perhaps then you can use your powers."

Mister White paused and said, "That is not a bad thing. The primitive genes we humans have come from crystallizers. The core of our bodies is not great. You can experience a second development by making your primitive genes like a born true god, which is very good for you."

"I hope so," Han Sen replied. After hearing Mister White speak, he felt better.

Mister White and Han Sen exchanged some more information. Han Sen decided to stay with the Extreme King for now.

I do not want to be a student for anything. Didn't Bai King say he will give me anything? Let me go ask him for some deified xenogeneic genes. Perhaps if I have enough, I can become a larvae class. Hopefully, I can become a butterfly. After Han Sen thought this through, he walked back to the palace.

The palace was a serious place. Even the king's daughters and sons were not allowed to enter without prior permission, but Bai King was giving Han Sen special treatment. He was able to enter the palace whenever he chose.

With this special treatment, it made Bai King's wives and children upset. Of course, no one said anything about it.

Other people were becoming more curious about Han Sen. They wanted to know what was special about him and why Bai King would spoil him like that. After all, this had never happened before.

When Han Sen went to Bai King's study, Bai Wanjie was there.

"Holy Baby, you are here. Sit down," Bai King nicely said.

Even Bai Wanjie, who was a crown prince, had to stand. Han Sen, however, was told to take a seat.

Han Sen opened his lion mouth. "My King, did you say I can have anything I want? Now, I need deified xenogeneic genes. I need 300 or 400."

He did not think Bai King would give him that many. He was asking for a ridiculous amount, but it would at least mean he would receive as many as possible.

"Sure." Surprisingly, Bai King agreed straight away. He turned to Bai Wanjie and said, "Wanjie, take Holy Baby to Nine-Defense Palace. That place will belong to him now."

When Bai Wanjie heard that, his face changed. Although his face changed back quickly, Han Sen could still see that Bai Wanjie was very upset.
