  “Two thousand King xenogeneic genes? Why don’t you just go rob someone?” Ji Yang Sheng was thinking. Ordinary King class people wouldn’t have that many saved up.

Even a half-deified wouldn’t have that many King xenogeneic genes in storage.

Apparently, Barr wasn’t a man who had stocked up an unbelievable number of xenogeneic genes, either. So, his face looked pretty gloomy.

With his personality being what it was, he wouldn’t have much in the way of wealth. Although he could kill xenogeneics, he wouldn’t be stockpiling their genes.

Even if he wanted to borrow them, he probably couldn’t. He had no friends, after all. His only real friend was Dia Robber, but it was unlikely that Dia Robber had that many to part with either.

“Sure. Wait until I collect the xenogeneic genes. When I have what you have asked for, I will seek you out again,” Barr said. Then, he opened the core area hall and departed.

Han Sen wasn’t too concerned about this. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes was a big number. If most Kings couldn’t pull that many out of storage, it was doubly doubtful that Barr would be able to.

But Han Sen had set this price to create a standard for the people who were watching him. If others heard the price and offered two thousand genes, then he wouldn’t mind exerting a little effort to bless them in exchange.

If he had two thousand King xenogeneic genes, with the extra few that he received via hunting, he would have enough to raise three of his different areas to the ninth tier.

“He is crazy. Two thousand King genes. Can his blessing really bring people up to the rank of deified?” a Demon mocked, upon hearing this news.

Other people who had heard Han Sen’s conversation with Barr thought the same thing. None of them could believe that Han Sen could simply make another person deified. They thought something special must have happened to Lando at the same time, or maybe some sort of special treasure was used. Perhaps he made use of some unknown force in that part of the universe. It couldn’t have been Han Sen’s power alone that gave Lando the final push.

Of course, they accepted the fact that Han Sen’s power had some sort of effect. But they didn’t think it was the sole reason that Lando had become deified.

“Two thousand King class xenogeneic genes? That’s some easy money. I’d bless someone for a thousand,” a half-deified Feather grumbled to himself, dripping with disdain.

When the Fourth Uncle of the Extreme King Meng Lie heard this, he frowned. The Sixth Uncle spoke up, saying, “This Han Sen is too greedy. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes? Not even deified people like you and I can get that many.”

“If he can really make someone deified, two thousand King class genes is nothing,” Meng Lie replied.

“How is that possible? If this works, then why must we go to all the trouble of practicing? Why don’t we all just go queue and await his blessing?” Uncle Sixth asked with a look of scorn.

No one believed Barr would deliver Han Sen two thousand King xenogeneic genes for a blessing. Not even Han Sen himself believed something like that would happen.

A few Demons flew some distance away from Han Sen and shouted, “Han Sen, two thousand King class xenogeneic genes is too expensive. Can we haggle? We can pay one thousand King xenogeneic genes for you to bless Mr. Ji.”

“No, but if you want to free him, you need to pay me five hundred King class xenogeneic genes,” Han Sen said while pointing at Ji Yang Sheng.

Ji Yang Sheng was happy to hear this. He wanted the other Demons to pay the xenogeneic gene ransom so he would never have to pull a rickshaw ever again.

“What about the blessing?” the negotiating Demon asked with confusion.

“Five hundred to be freed. Two thousand for a blessing. No discounts,” Han Sen said simply.

“That… That’s too expensive! We cannot bring you that many xenogeneic genes…” the Demon said with hesitation.

“When I said two thousand, I was giving you a fifty percent discount. In the future, it won’t be this cheap,” Han Sen warned.

The Demon King, when he heard Han Sen, understood that the price wouldn’t go lower.

“I don’t need a blessing. Just let me leave!” Ji Yang Sheng quickly said. He didn’t think Han Sen’s blessing was going to make him deified, anyway. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes was practically daylight robbery.

The negotiating Demons spoke for a while more, and they eventually forked over five hundred King class xenogeneic genes for Ji Yang Sheng’s freedom.

“You don’t want me to bless you? Two thousand is a small sum. If you miss this chance now, it won’t be any cheaper for you later on.” Han Sen smiled at Ji Yang Sheng.

“No one is going to pay you two thousand King class xenogeneic genes for your blessings,” Ji Yang Sheng spat. Then he turned around to leave. He didn’t want to see Han Sen ever again.

Han Sen leered at the pile of King class xenogeneic genes that the Demons had just given him. He thought this was a fine business venture. If he couldn’t get any more King class xenogeneic genes for blessings, he could always bargain with the Extreme King using Bai Wuchang. If he sold the prince back to the Extreme King, it would be for a fine ransom.

But he thought the Extreme King wouldn’t be as fast to pay up as the Demon. The Extreme King were one of the top three races in the geno universe. They had to maintain their reputation, so there was a chance they wouldn’t be willing to pay a ransom for the safety of their people.

There was no one pulling the rickshaw anymore, so Han Sen returned it to Destiny’s Tower. Its origin was in the Alliance. He flew forward with Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.

Gu Qingcheng could fly atop her sword, while Elysian Moon used her umbrella to float. It looked very beautiful. Han Sen had to fly on his own. He had weapons, but he thought it wouldn’t look as cool if he flew atop a rocket launcher or a sniper rifle. So, he gave up on that idea and flew on his own.

After flying for half a day without seeing a single core xenogeneic, he suddenly saw something flying crazily through space after him. He had a closer look and noticed it was Barr.

“Han Sen, I have prepared two thousand King class xenogeneic genes for you. When can you start blessing me?” Barr shouted, getting to the point immediately.

“You really want me to bless you?” Han Sen looked at Barr with shock.

“If I didn’t, why would I come looking for you? When can you begin?” Barr looked impatient.

“Pay me first, and then I will bless you. When the two thousand King xenogeneic genes have arrived, I will begin the process.” Han Sen paused and then went on to say, “But the blessing is just a blessing. I can’t guarantee that you will become deified. It all depends on the potential of your genes.”

“That’s fine, as long as there is a chance. You wait here, and I will go get the xenogeneic genes,” Barr said, and then he left the core area. When he returned, he was lugging a mountain of King class xenogeneic genes behind him.

Many King class people were watching Han Sen. They froze when they saw that mountain of King class xenogeneic genes. The news of Barr delivering two thousand King class xenogeneic genes to Han Sen in exchange for a blessing spread across the entire universe.

“Is Barr crazy? Two thousand King class xenogeneic genes for Han Sen’s blessing? Isn’t that a big waste?”

“No way Barr had that many King class xenogeneic genes. This must have been given to him by the boss of the Destroyed.”

“The Destroyed really want a deified, don’t they? They are willing to pay so many King class xenogeneic genes for this ridiculous ceremony?”

Many King class people came close to watch. They wanted to see how Barr’s blessing turned out. Many people had their filming equipment at the ready. They streamed the images back to their people.
