“I haven’t seen it yet, so I can’t be sure,” said Gu Qingcheng calmly.

“Was there something like the Iron Chimenea in ancient times?” Han Sen found it hard to believe.

Humans had been around for tens of thousands of years, and there was a time when humans didn’t keep historical records. But even so, the history of humans was not as long as that of the shura race, not to mention the ancient races like the Crystallizers.

If humans had possessed something so powerful in ancient times, they would’ve risen in the universe a long time ago. They wouldn’t have taken so long to gain power, and the shura wouldn’t have maintained dominance for so many years.

“At that point in history, humans controlled some strange items. Actually, you have one yourself, but it isn’t as powerful as it used to be.” Gu Qingcheng looked at Han Sen with a smile.

“You mean Taia Sword?” Han Sen thought about it, and that sword was the only thing he had with a rich history, which came from the era of Gu Qingcheng.

Gu Qingcheng nodded and said, “Taia Sword was mighty before it was broken. When I left, Taia Sword was still one of the top ten sacred swords, but out of nowhere, it got broken. Lots of things were lost or destroyed around that time, and I don’t know what happened after that. There’s one thing I can be sure of: if the Iron Chimenea is as you described, it’s probably an alchemy pot.”

“Is it used for making medicines?” asked Han Sen.

Gu Qingcheng paused for a while and said, “In that era, many Taoists wanted to become angels, and making medicines was one of the ways to achieve that. It was very popular among the Taoists, and the most famous alchemy pot was the long- living pot that belonged to the Taoist Xu Fu.”

“Xu Fu? I’ve heard that name somewhere before. An emperor in ancient times once went to find medicines that could help him live forever. Was that him?” Han Sen asked after a moment of thought. He had heard that story when he was in kindergarten.

Gu Qingcheng shook her head. “He wasn’t an emperor. Xu Fu was a very famous Taoist, and he was great at making medications. He was using the Chimenea to reshape his own body.”

“Reshape his own body? He wanted to turn himself into a medication?” Han Sen was very surprised.

“Of course not. He was using the Chimenea to train his body, and he absorbed the forces from the medication. He then condensed the medications and tried to become an angel. Unfortunately, modern science has proven that there isn’t anything like heaven, and the so-called Taoist technique back then was proven to be just a rumor. Only a few seemed to actually break the space and ascend. Perhaps nobody actually succeeded, and even if one succeeded, nobody knew where they went, but it wouldn’t be heaven.” Gu Qingcheng shrugged her shoulders.

Han Sen’s interest was piqued. If Dongxuan Zi broke through space and entered the sanctuary, then what about the other Taoists who broke through space? Did they reach the sanctuaries as well?

However, that didn’t seem quite right. Jade Little Lion King once said that his father had seen that Iron Chimenea when it was still young, and based on the age of the Little Lion King’s father, that Iron Chimenea had been around much longer than humans had. If that ancient creature saw the Chimenea when it was young, there was no way that the device once belonged to humans.

“I think it’s just a coincidence that they look alike. The Iron Chimenea has been in God’s Ruin for so long, and it’s definitely older than human history. It’s not likely that it’s some pot that belonged to Xu Fu,” said Han Sen to Gu Qingcheng.

“We need to see it first,” said Gu Qingcheng stubbornly.

Seeing Gu Qingcheng insist on fighting the armored man, Han Sen stopped trying to persuade her to concede. He had already warned her and told her everything he knew, so it wouldn’t be his fault that something bad happened to her.

The Divinity’s Bout continued. Han Sen and the armored man didn’t run into any obstacles. All the creatures and spirits conceded, so they passed round after round of battles without fighting.

After half a month, the battle between Gu Qingcheng and the armored man came.

Gu Qingcheng also had great performance in her previous battles, so many creatures and spirits were attracted to her fight with the armored man. Lots of creatures were speculating on whether Gu Qingcheng had the courage to fight him.

The truth was, Gu Qingcheng was a very stubborn person. Even though Han Sen warned her several times, Gu Qingcheng still insisted on fighting the armored man. When she showed up on the battlefield, lots of people cheered.

They were cheering for Gu Qingcheng’s courage, but at the same time, they would finally see the armored man strike again.

Nobody paid any attention to the armored man until his fight against the master of Outer Sky. And after that fight, no creatures dared to fight the armored man, so most of the crowd had never seen the armored man strike before, and they didn’t know exactly how powerful he was.

Gu Qingcheng was the first person since Outer Sky who had been willing to fight him, and this was the perfect time to see whether the armored man was indeed as invincible as the rumors said.

Han Sen didn’t have a battle that day, so he left Shadow Shelter and went to watch the battle with Wang Yuhang and his friends.

Han Sen knew that Gu Qingcheng was powerful, but that armored man was also terrific. Han Sen wasn’t sure whether Gu Qingcheng could win or not, so he could only wish Gu Qingcheng good luck.

“Old Han, will sister Gu be okay?” Wang Yuhang was a bit worried. He had watched the armored man kill Outer Sky’s leader with one strike, so he knew how terrifying the armored man was. He was very worried.

“If she thinks she can do it, I don’t think she’ll have a problem. With her power, even if she can’t defeat the armored man, she can still survive long enough to resign the fight. Nobody in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary can stop her.” Han Sen could only hope for the best.

“Fleeing? It’ll be the armored man who’ll flee.” Elysian Moon sneered and walked toward him. She then sat down on the stone steps.

“Let’s hope so,” said Han Sen.

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow also came to cheer for Gu Qingcheng. Unfortunately, Gu Qingcheng couldn’t hear anything in the battlefield of Divinity’s Bout.

The battle had begun. Gu Qingcheng walked into the battlefield, and almost at the same time, a door of light showed up in opposition to Gu Qingcheng, and the armored man walked out.

Everyone was staring at the armored man, and they were all greatly anticipating his performance. All the creatures were still thrilled by how the armored man killed the master of Outer Sky with one strike, and many people wished to see the same thing happen again.

Gu Qingcheng stared at the armored man thoughtfully. It seemed that she might’ve figured out something.

The armored man didn’t say anything. He raised his fist, and fire started to burn across his body. But the burning fire wasn’t hot at all; instead, it was cold as ice.
