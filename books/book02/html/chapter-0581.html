    <p>
      Yi Dongmu didn&#8217;t think much. There was only one heartfelt desire
      right now - defeat Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu clutched his daggers upside down like fangs, and his eyes were
      fixed calmly upon Han Sen. He seemed to be wholly relaxed, as if his
      breathing had achieved a constant, uninterruptible rhythm.
    </p>

    <p>
      He slowly walked closer to Han Sen, quite unlike the expected killer out
      for his enemy&#8217;s blood. He walked casually, as if he were just taking
      a stroll in the park.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Long, what are your thoughts concerning this fight?&#8221;
      Fang Mingquan, the commentator, had with him a very famous evolver as a
      guest on the broadcast.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Mister Long was known to any person who frequented the official
      evolver&#8217;s platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was over 100 years old and had made countless instructional videos to
      help out fresh evolvers, teaching them how to perform skills and hunt
      creatures. Those videos were a great help to normal people, and they
      reduced the risks evolvers would take when ascending to the Second
      Shelter. His videos were invaluable to the development of people&#8217;s
      talents and abilities; this made him a person of much renown, respect, and
      admiration among evolvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan was able to invite Mister Long as a guest on the broadcast,
      and it drew in a lot more viewers. People would tune in so they could see
      what was about to unfold with greater clarity, through Mister Long&#8217;s
      live analyses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mister Long looked upon the two people pitted against each other in the
      arena and said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t studied Yi Dongmu much; but Dollar,
      I have researched extensively and analyzed his battle tapes.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Long, if you have done serious research on Dollar, could you
      share some of your conclusions? We are all curious as to what we can
      expect out of Dollar tonight. We are all extra keen to know whether or not
      Dollar is using the legendary Heavenly Go, as well. Could you provide us
      your input?&#8221; Fang Mingquan asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is tricky. I have spent a lot of time analyzing this move of
      his, and what he uses isn&#8217;t 100% authentic Heavenly Go. It is not
      even a high-end replication of the skill, either; in fact, it is a
      low-quality knock-off,&#8221; Mister Long replied, with absolute
      certainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen heard what Mister Long had just said, he would have admired his
      perception. Han Sen really did just copy the skill loosely, and very
      little of it was of his own invention.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;So, Mister Long, you are fairly sure that Dollar is not using the
      true Heavenly Go. Do you have evidence to back up your claim?&#8221; Fang
      Mingquan noticed from the stream chat that there were many Dollar fans
      dismissing Mister Long&#8217;s statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mister Long was able to see the comments as well, but he calmly said,
      &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a very fortuitous life, but when I was younger,
      I was lucky enough to hunt with Fu Qingmei, and I witnessed the entirety
      of the skill Heavenly Go. It was right before my eyes.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After he said that, no one said anything more about his claim. If Mister
      Long was able to witness Fu Qingmei perform Heavenly Go, then his analysis
      could not be incorrect. Everyone knew Fu Qingmei&#8217;s Heavenly Go,
      since the skill gained its popularity from her.
    </p>

    <p>At this time, Yi Dongmu made a move towards Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      Mister Long, who was watching Yi Dongmu&#8217;s casual demeanor as he
      strolled, expressed absolute surprise. In his reaction, he blurted out,
      &#8220;Huh?!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Long, what is going on?&#8221; Although Fang Mingquan was a
      professional commentator, he didn&#8217;t know much about fighting skills;
      it was because of this that he did not notice anything special.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mister Long said with admiration in his voice, &#8220;If I am not
      mistaken, Yi Dongmu is using Sacrifice. This skill is reliant on your
      mental fortitude, not your physical power. If you could not focus your
      mind, it would not matter if you were a surpasser - you could not perform
      the moves efficiently.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That sounds like an incredible fighting skill. How would you gauge
      his performance, Mister Long?&#8221; Fang Mingquan asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fighting skills aren&#8217;t mathematics. Everything is relative on
      the field of battle, and that is especially true of this skill, which
      depends entirely on the situation in which it is cast. I cannot use
      numbers to calculate his performance of it; all I can say is that Yi
      Dongmu has indeed mastered &#8216;Sacrifice.&#8217; A great future must
      lay ahead for this young man.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan then asked, &#8220;My knowledge of fighting skills is
      limited, so I&#8217;m not entirely sure what Sacrifice is. Could you
      provide me and the audience an explanation of why Sacrifice is so
      spectacular?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;To use Sacrifice, you must throw away all the other thoughts that
      might occupy your mind. You need to be without fear, without worry,
      without sorrow and without happiness. Your mind must devote itself to one,
      singular purpose; if you do this, then you can achieve mastery of
      Sacrifice, and it will aid you. But doing this is more difficult than it
      sounds. Reaching the state absolute single mindedness is something not
      even the ancient heroes of yore could frequently attain. And what&#8217;s
      more, Yi Dongmu is still so young. His ability to channel Sacrifice
      through his pure, dust-free mind is something extremely rare.&#8221;
      Mister Long was in true admiration of Yi Dongmu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan noticed Mister Long was not speaking in specifics and was
      failing to explain what the skill Sacrifice actually did. So, he had to
      ask, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what type of skill Sacrifice is.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The most straightforward explanation I gave give is that Sacrifice
      is a movement. But it&#8217;s not just any movement; it&#8217;s one that
      combines the sky with the earth. Every step he takes will accelerate his
      momentum and increase the power he can achieve. The more steps he takes,
      the more power and momentum he can use. If he reaches one hundred steps,
      then his power and momentum will max out. If that were to occur, I
      don&#8217;t think there is anyone out there who could stop such an
      attack.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is it really that powerful? If Yi Dongmu takes one hundred steps,
      then Dollar will lose?&#8221; When Fang Mingquan heard this, he was
      shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The audience watching the stream started to discuss the skill amongst
      themselves, too.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Is that true? That sounds way too magical.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;According to what Mister Long says, if Yi Dongmu took ten thousand
      steps, then he could beat the world!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;There must be a reason why Mister Long is saying this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I think what Mister Long says makes sense. Look at Yi
      Dongmu&#8217;s momentum; it&#8217;s getting stronger and stronger. Even
      right now, my heart trembles.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Is Sacrifice really that powerful?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no. Dollar doesn&#8217;t know Yi Dongmu is using Sacrifice. He
      should strike now, before he gathers too much momentum.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      Mister Long shook his head and said, &#8220;It is easier for someone to
      make up his mind to die for a noble purpose than to actually go through
      the execution of such sacrifice. Sacrifice still needs its user to
      maintain his focus for the entire duration of the cast. The longer he
      walks, the greater the chance his faith and focus might change. If his
      resolve quivers by only just a bit, his momentum will decrease.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is very much like war; first, there is much momentum, but when
      the horrors of battle rear their ugly faces&#8230; it&#8217;s gone before
      you know it. Humans are sensitive beings, and even scholars and geniuses
      cannot maintain their faith forever. The highest Sacrifice I have seen was
      one hundred steps. Even if he kept on walking after this, his momentum
      would still decrease.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I wonder how many steps Yi Dongmu will be able to take, with his
      usage of Sacrifice.&#8221; Fang Mingquan was watching Yi Dongmu intently.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Mister Long&#8217;s explanation, viewers of the stream started
      counting Yi Dongmu&#8217;s steps.
