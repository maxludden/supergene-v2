<h3>Chapter 1786</h3>

<p>In a town in the north, the Taurus Viscount—whose name was Angry
Steel—was looking at the image in front of him. He was watching the
Seven Mirrors airship.</p>
<p>Next to Angry Steel, there was a man. He had purple eyes and
hair, horns, and white clothes. He, too, was watching the
videostream.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had seen that white-clothed man, he’d have been very
shocked. And that was because the man looked like a shura from the
Alliance.</p>
<p>Angry Steel looked glum. He was standing next to a master of the
Demon bloodline, and Angry Steel had been wanting to show off the
Angry Steel Army’s power. He wanted to impress the Demon, and
perhaps be considered for placement as one of the higher races.</p>
<p>But before he could show the man anything, this unfortunate
event had transpired.</p>
<p>Killing the Kate people was not the mistake. The biggest mistake
was for so many warriors, Baron-leader included, to be ruthlessly
murdered by another Baron. It all happened so swiftly; it was
embarrassing.</p>
<p>“Mister Viscount, Taurus warriors do seem to be a little
special, as you have been keen to express. Many of them surrounded
a Baron, and all of them were haplessly murdered. They don’t look
strong, I’ll tell you that much.” Next to the Demon master, there
was a woman with two horns. But her horns were golden, and they
were different from the master’s horns.</p>
<p>Angry Steel Viscount lowered his head to the master and said, “I
am sorry, Mister Ji. It was me merely being useless.”</p>
<p>Mister Ji shook his head and said, “That person is a Baron, but
he is good. This isn’t entirely your fault Order your ten captains
to go there and keep him busy.”</p>
<p>Angry Steel Viscount quickly said, “My best captain, Greatsword
Viscount, is already there. He can kill the person with ease.”</p>
<p>Mister Ji looked at the video but did not speak. The lady Demon
sneered and said, “Why are you talking so much crap? Are you really
that stupid? We need ten of your captains to go, not just this
single one!”</p>
<p>Angry Steel Viscount felt a little enraged by her chastisement,
but he refrained from showing it He nodded and said, “Yes, I will
order all ten captains to go at once.”</p>
<p>Angry Steel Viscount thought Greatsword Viscount was enough to
deal with the mystic Baron, but he still gave the order to send
everyone out there.</p>
<p>Greatsword Viscount was already there, and he was running at Han
Sen. Angry Steel Viscount thought to himself, “If Mister Ji says I
have to do this, then I have to do this. I definitely don’t want to
upset him. But Greatsword Viscount can definitely kill that person.
He doesn’t need anyone else. It’ll just be for show.”</p>
<p>Angry Steel Viscount watched the video feed confidently as
Greatsword Viscount rushed straight at Han Sen. Its powerful body
had considerable momentum, and it was very shocking to witness. It
was like the very planet was shaking.</p>
<p>And in regards to his performance, Angry Steel Viscount was
satisfied. Greatsword Viscount was not the strongest leader amongst
Angry Steel Army, but he was most certainly the most intimidating
one. Otherwise, Angry Steel wouldn’t have selected him to become
the top-ranked captain.</p>
<p>Greatsword Viscount jumped a distance of a few dozen meters. A
large flame enwreathed the greatsword he wielded. His strength and
speed were perfect, and the sight of it was beautiful.</p>
<p>“This is it. Kill that Baron! Let Mister Ji know that Angry
Steel Army is strong,” Angry Steel Viscount thought to himself.
Mister Ji was looking at Greatsword Viscount, when he suddenly
smiled.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma looked pale. He was worried for Han Sen and the Kate
that had not yet boarded the ship.</p>
<p>The door was too narrow. There was a limit to how many people
could get on board, all at the same time. Only half of the group
had successfully made it inside the ship. The other half were still
out in the open.</p>
<p>There were mostly old people, women, and children outside now.
Only a few young men were valiant enough to help them get in.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was killed, the army would return to finish them all
off, and the deaths would be many.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma looked on strangely. Why Han Sen was fighting
Greatsword Viscount was a mystery to him, and if he had decided to
just evade the foe, he’d surely survive longer. He could have even
run off.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was heading towards Greatsword Viscount directly,
with no thought of escaping.</p>
<p>When the onlookers saw the greatsword swinging down, they knew
the blow would be something not even a steel airship could
withstand.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move. His left hand held onto the Gold Feather
Bow as his right hand clutched the horn arrows. He pulled the
string back as far as it could go, and he took aim at Greatsword
Viscount.</p>
<p>The bow was a weapon that exceeded expectations at range, but
Greatsword Viscount was within melee distance of Han Sen. The
burning steel greatsword was going to come against the bow, and Han
Sen had yet to fire.</p>
<p>“Die!” Greatsword Viscount roared, as the muscles in his body
tightened. He unleashed a scary power that looked like it would
crush Han Sen and the ship.</p>
<p>As this occurred, Han Sen unleashed the arrow. The whoosh of its
travel sounded as the arrow rushed forward like a toxic cobra
strike.</p>
<p>It seemed too late to fire now, though. Greatsword Viscount’s
greatsword was going to come into contact with the horn arrow, then
probably carry on through to hit Han Sen.</p>
<p>Greatsword Viscount wore a horrible smile, and he kept roaring.
He gripped the sword tightly as he pushed more of his rage into the
weapon. He was three inches away from the arrow.</p>
<p>But the horn arrow disappeared right before Greatsword Viscount
Nothing collided with the steel greatsword. Han Sen turned and went
right past him like a butterfly. He ended up at the foe’s side.</p>
<p>Greatsword Viscount wished to strike again, but it was then that
the creature noticed the vanishing arrow had re-appeared. Before he
could react, the horn arrow raced through his mouth as he was
shouting.</p>
<p>The arrow was spinning incredibly quickly. It came up through
his throat, bulldozing its way into his brain. It came out again,
spraying brain matter and juice all about</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on going past Greatsword Viscount, not even
concerned enough to look at the beast. He reclaimed the arrow and
moved forward. Greatsword Viscount’s team was still in the
area.</p>
<p>Greatsword Viscount’s body fell backward, creating a
dozen-meter-long trail. The corpse twitched, as brain juice leaked
and poured out everywhere. He was going to die.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no reaction, like this was an every-day activity for
him. But Lao Zhuoma and Mike were in shock, and even Angry Steel
Viscount was floored. None of them could believe their eyes.</p>
<p>For a Viscount Taurus to go out like that was crazy, especially
when its enemy was simply a Baron.</p>
<p>The team of Taurus warriors had been fighting in a bloodthirsty
rage, but after watching Greatsword Viscount be murdered, they were
in massive shock. They no longer looked intimidating. In fact, they
looked rather scared.</p>
