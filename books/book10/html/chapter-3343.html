<p>Han Sen tried it a few times, but it seemed certain that it
would not work. He was unable to touch the girl.</p>
<p>The girl reached out her hand to try and hold onto Han Sen, but
that did not work either. She was unable to touch him, and her body
was trapped and suspended by that light. She was unable to exit
it.</p>
<p>Seeing that the little girl was about to leave Soldier Weapon
Sky, Han Sen was both shocked and afraid. He was really angry about
this, but he knew he needed to calm down first. The girl was going
to leave Soldier Weapon Sky soon. There was no time for him to
panic. He was not going to let emotional turmoil cloud his vision
and have him squander the chance to fix this.</p>
<p>Han Sen calmed down. He suddenly found a weird movement start to
occur inside the girl. That movement was from the girl’s soul. To
be more accurate, it was Han Sen’s soul.</p>
<p>The soul mark had been unable to be refined by the girl. It was
in the girl’s soul. It kept a connection with Han Sen’s soul.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen’s emotions were changing, the soul changed a lot
too.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the soul and the girl start to leave Soldier Weapon
Sky, so he did not hesitate. He was determined. He immediately used
his Super God Spirit mode to activate his spirit body and go to the
girl.</p>
<p>The moment the girl left the Soldier Weapon Sky, the soul Han
Sen became went into the soul mark he had and vanished with the
girl.</p>
<p>The two universes continued having elites trying to breach the
33 skies. They all wanted to assert control over the 33 skies. More
and more leaders were starting to appear.</p>
<p>There were far fewer Break World elites in the geno universe
than there were in the universe of kingdoms. Regarding the growth,
the geno universe was not too bad.</p>
<p>Since the life soul chaos, the 33 skies had returned to their
origin. It was through this that the geno universe was able to
vastly improve. Many Break World elites appeared. Although their
Break World rates were not high, their potential was strong. They
improved quickly.</p>
<p>There were geno universe elites, and they had a scary name in
the 33 skies. Compared to the universe of kingdoms’ elites, they
were not too shabby.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader Yu Shanxin, Lone Bamboo, Human King, Holy
Gourd Vine, Very High Leader, and other elites of the universe were
in the 33 skies fighting other elites too. They all wanted to be a
supreme leader.</p>
<p>There were now 16 established leaders in 16 skies. Aside from
Human King, who wasn’t too famous in the geno universe, no one else
was able to assert a sky for themselves.</p>
<p>“Where is Dollar? Why did Dollar not come to claim a sky?”</p>
<p>“If Mister Dollar was here, he could conquer all 33 skies.”</p>
<p>The geno universe hoped they would have an elite who could
become a leader of all the skies, and many put their faith in the
return of Dollar. But Dollar was someone who had sunk into the sea.
There was no sign of him to be found.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang looked at Littleflower and complained.
“Littleflower, what is your Dad doing? He has been gone for so
long, yet he hasn’t taken a sky.”</p>
<p>Space Garden had many elites wondering about that as well. They
pondered why Han Sen had not taken one of the skies. With Han Sen’s
power, he should have been able to claim a sky.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang could no longer help it. He stood up and declared,
“No. I cannot wait any longer. I am going to the 33 skies to have a
look. Let’s go and see what San Mu is up to.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu grabbed Wang Yuhang and asked, “Go? How are you
going to go there? You have not even broken the world. Ordinary
Break World beasts cannot get inside the 33 skies, so what makes
you think you will be able to?”</p>
<p>Going to the 33 skies was dangerous. Many Break World beasts had
already died trying to gain access, failing at its outskirts.</p>
<p>“I have already broken the world,” Littleflower said. “You
should just let me go.”</p>
<p>Han Yan stopped him and said, “Littleflower, you cannot go. What
happened to your brother? Auntie is already worried. If you went
and died there, your mother would be very sad.”</p>
<p>Littleflower looked troubled. Recently, Ji Yanran had expressed
a lot of worry about Han Sen. She kept having nightmares. If he
vanished again, Ji Yanran was going to be worried even more.</p>
<p>“I am close to breaking the world. Wait a few more days, and I
will go when I have broken the world. Let us see what San Mu is
doing in the 33 skies.” Xie Qing King was looking very confident,
and that bled into his speech.</p>
<p>“It will be better to just wait for me,” Yi Dong Mu said. “I
will probably break the world sooner than you.”</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to go to the 33 skies. They kept talking, but
none of them managed to break the world. They did not have what it
took to go to the 33 skies.</p>
<p>“If there are no other ways, why don’t we instead ask for Mister
White to go?” Han Yan asked after briefly thinking.</p>
<p>“Stop talking!” Wang Yuhang shouted. “When I said I will go, I
will go!”</p>
<p>“I said that if you have not broken the world, you cannot even
enter the 33 skies,” Tang Zhenliu said. “Stop trying to goof
around, Little Uncle.”</p>
<p>“I am not messing around,” Wang Yuhang said. “I have managed to
break the world.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Wang Yuhang. He was the sort to fool around
constantly. He did not practice or kill anything, so there was no
way he had managed to break the world yet.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, this is no joke. There is no exit out of the 33
skies.” Tang Zhenliu did not believe Wang Yuhang, which was why he
said that.</p>
<p>It was not just him who didn’t believe Wang Yuhang. No one else
believed him either.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang sighed and said, “Since there is no one else here,
and everyone here is from the sanctuaries, I will not lie. I have
been possessed by a life soul.”</p>
<p>“How is that possible? This is bad… This is bad…” Tang Zhenliu
thought Wang Yuhang was joking. He laughed and moved to pat Wang
Yuhang on the shoulder.</p>
<p>His hands did not touch Wang Yuhang’s shoulders. They were in
the air. As he smiled and spoke, his speech was cut short.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang’s body changed. There was some weird light on him.
His head was given a transparent crown. His entire body looked
weird. His eyes were given an evil, cold light. His whole form
looked a bit evil. He looked like an evil god. It was not like the
happy Wang Yuhang he always was.</p>
<p>“How is this possible?” Everyone looked at Wang Yuhang with
worry. They did not mind Wang Yuhang becoming a Break World beast,
but the will of a Break World beast was obsessed with killing a lot
very quickly. They were afraid Wang Yuhang would lose control of
himself.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang shook his head. “Do not worry. I am fine. My will
has not been taken by the life soul yet. My body has not completely
changed. I am not a complete Break World beast. I am half-man and
half-beast.”</p>
<p>He mocked himself and said, “It is fine. I am not planning to
get married. I can be half-beast. It has saved me some time and
spared me from needing to practice. I will not have to work hard.
If you guys cannot go to the 33 skies, I will go on your behalf.
You guys wait here, and I will go and take a look.”</p>
<p>After that, Wang Yuhang flew out of the base.</p>
