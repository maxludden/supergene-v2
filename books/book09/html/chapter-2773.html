<p>After the phoenix lifted Han Sen into the air, it rocketed
forward with blinding speed. This was nothing like the slow,
ponderous way the bird had moved when it first approached Two Ape
Mountain.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could say anything, he saw that they were heading
toward one of the suns in the sky. The orb glowed with power and
heat as they shot recklessly toward it.</p>
<p>They were still some distance from the sun, but Han Sen thought
that the incredible heat was about to melt his deified body. He
didn’t know what would happen if he entered that glowing orb, and
his heart rose into his throat at the thought.</p>
<p>The phoenix flapped its wings, and they shot past the sun,
flying deeper into the xenogeneic space. The phoenix accelerated,
leaving behind the glowing suns that hung threateningly in the sky.
Han Sen looked ahead and saw, in the distant sky, a giant sycamore
tree that was growing upside-down.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen many strange trees in his life before, but he
had never seen a tree growing upside-down.</p>
<p>The top of the giant sycamore tree was on the ground, but its
roots were growing into the sky. The roots were like a dragon’s
beard, all tangled up like a large bird nest.</p>
<p>“People say phoenixes live in sycamore trees. Perhaps this
phoenix doesn’t live atop the sycamore tree, but rather, in its
roots.” Han Sen looked at the upside-down growing tree with a
strange expression.</p>
<p>The god phoenix soared up to the roots and landed deftly among
them. The creature opened its beak, letting Han Sen fall into a
knot of roots that looked something like a nest.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly discovered that the place wasn’t “like” a bird’s
nest. It really was a bird’s nest.</p>
<p>In that bird’s nest that was composed of the roots of the tree,
Han Sen saw a giant egg that was around ten meters tall. The egg
was burning with the same white fire as the phoenix.</p>
<p>“Why have you brought me here? You don’t think I look like a
phoenix, do you? You’re not going to raise me as a child, are you?”
Han Sen spoke to the phoenix that was now settling down in the
nest.</p>
<p>“Of course I know you aren’t a phoenix. Phoenixes don’t give
birth to ugly children like you. And this, this is my child,” the
phoenix said proudly.</p>
<p>“Then why did you bring me here?” Han Sen let out a long sigh.
If he was raised by a phoenix, he would become a phoenix man.</p>
<p>“Your body has traces of a presence that belongs to a member of
my race. And I must say, it is a nice one. I’m sure you must have
been spending a lot of time with a youngster of my race,” the
phoenix said while looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“A young phoenix?” Han Sen was shocked. Then he thought of
something. With a weird look on his face, he said, “She can’t be
talking about the little red bird, can she? The little red bird is
a hybrid, though. It isn’t actually a phoenix.”</p>
<p>Now Han Sen understood why the phoenix was treating him
differently. It was because of the little red bird.</p>
<p>“We did spend time together for quite a while. And our
relationship is solid. We are kind of like brothers,” Han Sen said
seriously.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t going to tell the phoenix that the little red
bird was a hybrid. If the phoenix was racist to the hybrid kind,
then his special treatment would vanish.</p>
<p>Thinking about how cold and cruel the phoenix appeared when it
started eating people, Han Sen shuddered. He sincerely hoped the
phoenix wouldn’t have a change of heart and became callous enough
to dine on him.</p>
<p>“I thought I was the only phoenix remaining in this universe. I
didn’t suspect there was another one of my kind out there in the
universe.” The phoenix looked very happy, but then it said, “If you
can, I hope you will be able to help me. Bring that baby phoenix
here.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that might be rather difficult. I have been
separated from the phoenix for quite a while, and I’m not sure
where it is right now… But don’t worry. If you want to see it, I
will do my best to find him and bring him to you. If you guys are
seeking a reunion, I will do my best to make it happen. A reunion
with your family will be a beautiful thing.” Han Sen could see that
the phoenix’s expression was growing a little rigid, so he quickly
tried to make his voice sound more positive and certain.</p>
<p>The phoenix looked very happy again. “Don’t just try your best.
You must bring him here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I will make sure to complete this request,” Han
Sen agreed. He wanted to trick the phoenix and leave that
xenogeneic space as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if the phoenix could accept a hybrid. He
wouldn’t risk his safety or the little red bird’s by actually
bringing it there.</p>
<p>The phoenix seemed very happy. It extended one of its wings, and
Han Sen saw a feather that looked very fiery and white fall through
the air. The feather seemed to have a life of its own, and it flew
before Han Sen.</p>
<p>“This phoenix feather is for you. It is my gift for you. If you
complete my request, I will reward you with more,” the phoenix said
seriously.</p>
<p>“You are so kind. I’m more than flattered to receive this,” Han
Sen said. Then, he grabbed the fire-wreathed feather in his hand.
It was a true god class treasure. Even a mere feather from the
phoenix would be wildly powerful.</p>
<p>The feather was pure white, almost transparent. The whole thing
looked as if it was made of fire, but it wasn’t like a fire that
Han Sen couldn’t touch. It was actually solid.</p>
<p>This fire feather was a small piece of an actual phoenix, but it
was still only one meter long. When he held it in his hands,
though, it looked like a flaming sword. Han Sen grinned widely. He
could use the feather as a weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen was lacking a decent weapon right now. This fire feather
was perfect for him. The longer he held it, the more he liked
it.</p>
<p>“A fire element fire feather. This should be quite powerful,”
Han Sen thought to himself. He wasn’t going to try out the sword
there in the phoenix’s nest, though.</p>
<p>After he had examined the gift, Han Sen changed the subject.
“Why are you looking for a baby phoenix? I think that the baby bird
is substantially weaker than you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was speaking the truth. This phoenix had pure ancestry,
and it was a born-deified xenogeneic. The little red bird was just
a hybrid, and it had been very weak when it was born. Compared to a
true god xenogeneic, it was 180,000 miles behind.</p>
<p>The phoenix sighed and said, “Breeding is difficult for our
race. There aren’t many of us left, if there are any at all. Up
until now, I haven’t been able to find another of my kind. I can’t
believe there is a baby bird alive somewhere. For me and my race,
this is great news. Once my child is born, they can become a
couple. That way, they should be able to breed.”</p>
<p>Han Sen froze when he heard that. The phoenix wanted to use the
little red bird as a breeding machine. It planned for the little
red bird to make babies and repopulate the phoenixes.</p>
<p>“Hang on, I don’t even know if the little red bird is male or
female,” Han Sen thought. “If they are the same sex, how will they
make babies?” Han Sen didn’t say that aloud, however. He only
agreed to the request, promising that he would bring the little red
bird there.</p>
<p>“If there is nothing else, I will go and search for the little
red bird and bring it here.” Han Sen just wanted to get out of
there now.</p>
<p>“There is no rush. Before you leave, there is something very
important you must do,” the phoenix said. Then, it spat some fire
at Han Sen.</p>
