    <p>
      The leather text Han Sen was reading said that the initiation of
      Blood-Pulse practice required a Blood-Pulse relic. If you obtained one,
      only then could you truly begin to learn the skill. Attempting to learn it
      before getting one of these relics would be a waste of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen searched for more and more information concerning the Blood-Legion
      and found a few topics pertaining to Blood-Legion relics. Unfortunately,
      no one else knew what they were, either. The only information that was
      available stated that the Blood-Legion relics were gifts given to humans
      by Blood-Gods. They were typically handed down through the generations by
      ardent family followers of the Blood-Legion. Outsiders were never privy to
      them, and not even low-level members of the cult could see them. They were
      reserved for high-ranking members of the Blood-Legion only.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen would have loved to give his future child a leg-up, he
      had no idea where he might find a relic of his own. And being entirely
      truthful with himself, he was unsure whether or not this requirement that
      was stated on the leather parchment was true. He didn&#8217;t think it was
      very credible.
    </p>

    <p>
      After showering, Han Sen fancied having some food. Before departing,
      however, he heard a knock on his door. It was Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My Captain, how have you found the time to visit me in my little
      cottage?&#8221; Han Sen jested, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran looked strange on this day, though. And it didn&#8217;t seem as
      if she was in the mood to play along with Han Sen&#8217;s jokes. She eyed
      him weirdly, and it was as if she wanted to tell him something, but for
      some reason, a phantom force held her tongue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yanran, what has happened?&#8221; Han Sen rarely saw Ji Yanran in
      such a condition, and this worried him. He immediately held her hand and
      drew her in close.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What happened, baby? Don&#8217;t scare me like this.&#8221; Han Sen
      was panicking, having never seen Ji Yanran&#8217;s face like so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran clenched her jaw. In response to Han Sen&#8217;s pleading, she
      turned around, and said with a voice as quiet and strained as a mosquito,
      &#8220;My grandfather wants to see you&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      If was as if her voice hit a mute button, as her sentence trailed off. Her
      cheeks were red, as if they had been set ablaze.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Your grandfather? What does he want to see me for?&#8221; Han Sen
      was surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nothing. But if you don&#8217;t want to go, that&#8217;s fine. And
      if so, I will return.&#8221; After Ji Yanran said that, she ran off in
      haste and did not look back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched her go in a daze, and he didn&#8217;t even have the time
      to think about what just happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is going on? Her grandpa wants to meet me? Her grandpa is one
      of the few demigods. Why would he want to meet me? Is it because of the
      Life Geno essence or my little angel?&#8221; Han Sen mulled over these
      questions while he gave chase to Ji Yanran. But she was too quick, and
      after turning a corridor, she was too far ahead to catch up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I feel so sorry for Ji Yanran, being with an asshole like
      you.&#8221; Annie was standing outside a door, coldly looking at Han Sen
      as she spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; Han Sen frowned and returned
      Annie&#8217;s gaze.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What do you mean, &#8216;what does that mean&#8217;? You are a man.
      She is a good lady. She has been with you all this time and you have yet
      to propose. How is she supposed to explain this to her family?&#8221;
      Annie coldly explained.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face turned red. He opened his mouth to speak, but no
      words departed his lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Or are you waiting for the lady to ask first?&#8221; Annie coldly
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Her grandfather wants to talk with me about a proposal?&#8221; Han
      Sen asked, shocked, as he had no experience in these sorts of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Discuss a proposal with him? He&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221; Annie
      looked at Han Sen as if she was observing an idiot.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sister Annie, you know I have no experience with these matters. Why
      don&#8217;t you offer me some guidance? If you do, I promise to repay your
      kindness!&#8221; Han Sen quickly pleaded with Annie, due to his complete
      lack of knowledge of the subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie&#8217;s face looked calmer, but she still coldly said, &#8220;If you
      continue being with Ji Yanran like this, with no indication of proper
      commitment, it won&#8217;t just be the traditional old men who can&#8217;t
      bear you. I won&#8217;t be able to stand you. If you really want to be
      with Yanran, at least get engaged. Then, that would be a sign for her
      family. Have you ever stopped for one minute to think about how much
      pressure she has been put under, for being with you? Especially a family
      like hers.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It is my negligence,&#8221; Han Sen quickly responded.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Ji really loves his children, and he&#8217;s a very traditional
      old man. If you see him, you best suggest this matter of a proposal. If
      you instead talk more bullshit, he will kill you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie paused for a moment, but then went on to say, &#8220;But before
      that, you owe Ji Yanran a proposal. If you don&#8217;t have one in the
      cards now, then there is no reason for you to go visit her family.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>After that, Annie turned around, left, and ignored Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart felt as if it was sweating. He was so free and
      relaxed, being with Ji Yanran before. He had never thought about the
      future much, or considered how things would eventually turn out.
    </p>

    <p>
      He used to think about these things, but he had assumed it was too early.
      He wished to complete his service first. The one thing he hadn&#8217;t
      paid mind to was the pressure she might have been receiving from her
      family.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;This was my own fault,&#8221; Han Sen blamed himself.</p>

    <p>
      He really did want to live and be with Ji Yanran. There were many pretty
      girls, but being with someone you could be yourself with and feel
      comfortable alongside—even if it was only a silence, that was free of
      awkwardness—few girls offered this type of companionship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes, all it would take was a look or a slight movement to know what
      each other wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen liked Ji Yanran a lot, and he knew she loved him in return. There
      was nothing bad in that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was positive in his desire to marry her. Even if the Ji family did
      not approve, he&#8217;d still find a way to marry her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hm, such a good woman like that—I should put my label on her first
      and not allow her to be stolen.&#8221; Han Sen touched his jaw and thought
      about the best way to propose.
    </p>

    <p>
      And this proposal wouldn&#8217;t just be about the two of them;
      they&#8217;d both need their parents to agree. Han Sen had to ask Luo
      Sulan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know how to go about this proposal, so he called his
      mother. He told her about getting engaged to Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used to talk about her with his mom, so it wasn&#8217;t much of a
      surprise that he was bringing this up now.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Luo Sulan heard what Han Sen had to say, she was quiet for a moment.
      When she broke the silence, she said, &#8220;Are you sure this is the
      woman you want?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I want to marry this woman,&#8221; Han Sen said with
      assurance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then set a time and date to meet with her parents, so that you may
      settle this whole thing now,&#8221; Luo Sulan said, with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thanks, Mom.&#8221; Han Sen was very glad. Although Luo Sulan and
      Ji Yanran had never met, she was quick to agree. She was a very
      understanding woman.
