  Wang Yuhang’s situation was not going to last. His Super God Spirit body did not do direct damage. All it did was affect the mood of an opponent. He was unable to kill an opponent.

The worst thing about it was that in his battleground, there was only him and one other creature. That made his Super God Spirit body’s usefulness rather low and next to useless.

The worst thing about it was that his opponent was a metallic creature, which was very cold. It was rather like a robot, and his Super Hormone did not work on the metal creature.

His bike was very loud. Wang Yuhang was riding his bike fast along a road. The robot-looking metallic creature fired laser beams out of its metal eye sockets. The force of those lasers was so grand that they annihilated the fabric of space.. Wang Yuhang kept dodging, left to right. When the laser touched his bike, the steel instantly melted away.

There were already a few cuts on the bike by now. The hull of the bike was cut through by this point, exposing the machinery inside. Some parts of the bike were even starting to spark.

“Damn it!” Wang Yuhang lowered his head and dodged a laser that was aiming for his head. He felt coldness come down on his head. He touched it, which resulted in his hair being lasered away. He started to get angry.

Before he said anything properly, more of the lasers were coming for him. They tore through the fabric of space.

“Fuck! I do not believe this. You are a creature. You have emotions. If there are emotions, they should be affected by my Super Hormone.” Wang Yuhang was very angry. He had the urge to fight. His Super God Spirit body started gunning at its max.

The heavy bike lit up with a purple light. The engine started running with purple energy. The whole bike looked like a purple crystal.

The exhaust let out a purple mist instead of smoke. Wherever the heavy bike went, a purple mist followed it like a wave and dyed all of space a beautiful purple color. It was like smog when there was too much heavy metal in the air.

The giant metal lifeforce was inside that mist. It was like a metallic monster in the mist. It looked like it was there, but it was not actually there. Its eyes flickered, continuously firing out scary lights and lasers.

The purple mist did not seem to affect the creature. After meeting the light, it vaporized.

“It does not matter how you struggle! Just die already! When you become an enemy of the God Chaos Party, your fate is already sealed. How can you not understand that?” The metal lifeforce spoke with a cold voice. What it said meant it was a member of the God Chaos Party and one of Qin Xiu’s men.

“You are such a complete idiot!” Wang Yuhang scolded it. He pushed down harder on the accelerator pedal, putting more power into the bike. The bike’s engine went faster and faster. The purple mist became darker and darker. The bike went faster and faster.

Even so, it was still unable to block the pursuit of the metal lifeform. In a light that crossed each other, Wang Yuhang carelessly let the back of his bike get hit. Half of the back tire and body were cut off. The rest of the bike and Wang Yuhang fell away.

“Oh, no! Look at what’s going on all the way up there. It would appear that Little Uncle is in danger.” Lin Feng and the others were in shock.

“It is about time for you to die. Therefore, I will send you into the fiery pits of hell!” The metal creature’s eyes started to fire more lasers. The lasers were like suns, and their luminosity went to strike Wang Yuhang, who had taken a tumble.

Wang Yuhang was going to be in the light. His body was veiled by a beautiful purple light. His head had the crown of a queen. He had butterfly wings. His long hair that had been cut off started to grow again. It was a pretty purple. It kept having weird purple light movement like mad.

Now, Wang Yuhang’s whole body was becoming extremely pretty. Yes, only the word pretty could be used to describe him. When Han Sen combined with the Ice Jade Evil Lady, he was still a little Yang.

Wang Yuhang no longer had any Yang air about him. He was like a seductive queen whose whole body was irresistible.

The butterfly wings on his back moved. Wang Yuhang’s body stumbled back like a shadow. It dodged the lasers that were like one-hit kill weapons. The seductive body pranced through the air with the whole body unleashing a purple aura.

Wang Yuhang looked at the meal lifeform and asked, “You… Are you willing to sacrifice everything for me?”

The creatures of the two universes thought Wang Yuhang was mad. Although Wang Yuhang looked very attractive right now, where even all the males were super tempted, it was a strong creature that was a leader. Why would that being give up winning for him?

The metal creature coldly said, “You are going to die, and you still have the gall to joke around. I confess that this joke is not funny, thus, you can go die.”

After that, the metal lifeform’s eyes looked really bright. Their glare suggested it wanted to fire more lasers out.

The metal lifeform’s eyes, which had just turned bright, did not release any such lights.

“What… What is happening?” The metal lifeform shockingly noticed that it was no longer able to control its own body. It could not attack Wang Yuhang. It was like its body was betraying its mind.

The metal lifeform was even more shocked about the fact that its body was slowly approaching Wang Yuhang.

The metal lifeform wished to reclaim control of its metal body, but its body conflicted with its mind. It made it so weird. It tried its best to leave Wang Yuhang, but it could not help itself. It was more than compelled to remain with Wang Yuhang. It was like it had completely come under a spell that it could not resist.

“What is going on? What have you done?” The metal lifeform felt as if its body was no longer controllable. It walked over to Wang Yuhang.

A sky full of countless creatures from both worlds was now in shock. The metal lifeform kneeled before Wang Yuhang.

Its eyes no longer looked cold like before. It was still glowing, but it was not murderous, and it was now utterly powerless.

“It looks like you are ready to sacrifice everything before me. What are you waiting for?” Wang Yuhang was like a queen. He looked at the metal creature with disdain. It was like he was looking at a worthless slave.

Everyone else looked on in disbelief. The metal lifeform’s hands were quivering in fear. It grabbed its head and twisted its own metallic skull. It went “katcha” as it was torn away from the neck.

Boom! Boom!

The metal lifeform, clutching its own head, fell to the ground. It died like that.

The creatures of the two universes watching the fight were all petrified. They were no longer able to say a word.

Wang Yuhang’s name was taken forward to the top 16. Wang Yuhang’s face and presence returned to normal. He descended on the crumpled corpse of the metallic lifeform. He did not look happy or proud.

If he had been able to choose, he would have preferred never using that power again. It made him feel as if he was no longer a person but a monster.
