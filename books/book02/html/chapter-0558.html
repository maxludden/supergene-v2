    <p>
      The ice cave wasn&#8217;t too deep. After walking a few miles, he had
      reached the end. Once he got there, the narrow cave opened into a wide
      cavern. Han Sen hadn&#8217;t faced any danger or come across a single
      creature on his way there.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the icy hall, Han Sen noticed the presence of an egg that was about
      half the height of a fully-grown human. Its silver hue made it look
      metallic, and its glossy exterior was adorned with a variety of finely
      engraved patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt happy at making this discovery. He ran towards the egg and
      said, &#8220;Haha! The gods must love me! I can&#8217;t believe I have
      found such an egg - it must belong to the snake king.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew that it was difficult for creatures to bear children. Golden
      Roarers exhausted all they could to produce offspring, and they imparted
      their young with their geno essence. Doing so always led to the willing
      deaths of their mothers.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the cavern and ice cave were entirely clear, and there was no sign of
      the snake king. To Han Sen, this was a golden opportunity, and he did not
      hesitate to reach out his hand to touch the metallic, silver egg.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Argh!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s fingertips recoiled at receiving an
      electric shock. The hair on his fingers now stood on end. The charge that
      had shot into his body made him take two steps back, and he almost fell
      over.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My god, what is this egg? Why is it electric?&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s eyes were wide open, staring at the egg in puzzled confusion.
      He then saw how the egg shell&#8217;s patterns were highlighted, but from
      its previously bright appearance, was now turning dim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen eyed the egg with suspicion. He had eaten numerous eggs in the
      past, but never seen an egg quite like this.
    </p>

    <p>
      While he was thinking, a noise came from outside. Han Sen was startled,
      thinking that the snake king had returned. He pricked up his ears to
      listen, but all he could hear were the sounds of human footsteps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen frowned, looking out towards the cave entrance. The guys he had
      brought with him had not dared come this way, so whoever it was, they
      weren&#8217;t associated with Han Sen or his snake king excursion that
      day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking a look, Han Sen saw a person with blue armor, black hair and white
      wings enter the cave. As he had suspected, it wasn&#8217;t one of the
      evolvers that he had left behind. But, to his comfort, it was someone he
      knew.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yi Dong Mu&#8230;&#8221; Han Sen watched him curiously, and then
      called out his name. He had never expected to see him here, but judging
      from his apparel, he had just flown in. It was fortunate that this place
      had no ice snakes, for flying in like that would have given him a rude
      welcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Although you were here first, according to the rules, whoever
      claims it first owns it.&#8221; Yi Dong Mu saw where the silver egg was
      and, in a flash, used all his energy to dash towards it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, don&#8217;t!&#8221; Han Sen reached out and attempted to grab
      Yi Dong Mu. Seeing Han Sen, Yi Dong Mu used his strength to go even
      faster. When he reached his prize, he hugged the egg with open arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Aaaaaaaargh!&#8221; Yi Dong Mu cried out as letting out a final
      death cry. Brutally electrified, all his hair spiked upwards. He fell to
      the floor hard, his hands outstretched as if he was still hugging the egg.
      He seemed to have been paralyzed by the electric shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen smiled as he walked to catch up with Yi Dong Mu. He shook his head
      and said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to stop you from getting the egg. I
      was just trying to grab you and prevent this from happening. I was trying
      to be nice!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Yi Dong Mu stared at Han Sen disapprovingly, not believing him.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched Yi Dong Mu struggle to sit up and wanted to laugh.
      Earlier, he had in fact mislead Yi Dong Mu, because he wanted to find out
      if there still was electricity coming out of the egg after he had touched
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen received his answer. But it was now evident that this egg was no
      ordinary egg - it clearly was a powerful one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Poor Yi Dong Mu was taking a long time to recover from the shock, but he
      could hardly blame Han Sen. It was his own fault for rushing towards it,
      after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I had never heard of the silver-eye ice snake king possessing
      electric skills; I thought it could only inflict frostbite. How can this
      egg have such strong electricity?&#8221; Han Sen walked around the egg a
      few times, observing it. The pattern on the egg seemed to have been
      highlighted again after it shocked Yi Dong Mu, but the light was once
      again beginning to fade.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Yi, I believe we are going to have to crack this egg open.
      Otherwise, we will be unable to eat it. I am weak compared to you, so
      maybe you should go ahead and do it?&#8221; Han Sen turned to look at Yi
      Dong Mu again, watching as he struggled to move his limbs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dong Mu gave Han Sen a disdainful look, as if to say, &#8220;Do you
      think I am a fool?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not dare to try to smash the egg, as the electricity given by
      a small touch was painful enough. If he went to smash it, and the
      electricity inside was unleashed, what if it turned him into charcoal?
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Yi Dong Mu still unable to move, he didn&#8217;t dare go first. He
      started to think how he might get it open.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he returned to the Alliance, he could get himself a strong pair of
      insulated gloves. But he was a long way from there, and the electricity in
      the egg seemed unstable. Perhaps the gloves wouldn&#8217;t provide much
      help, anyway, and since he didn&#8217;t own a pair himself, he would have
      to go to the hassle of buying one.
    </p>

    <p>
      But who would have guessed there would be an egg, emitting such crazy
      amounts of electricity in such a place? Han Sen hadn&#8217;t prepared for
      this scenario, so his options were limited.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he did decide to return, Han Sen didn&#8217;t want to leave the egg
      behind, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Yi, if we have come all this way, there&#8217;s no way we
      can return empty-handed. Are you sure you wouldn&#8217;t mind trying
      again?&#8221; Han Sen wanted to convince Yi Dong Mu to give the egg
      another try.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nope, but I&#8217;ll watch you give it a go.&#8221; Yi Dong Mu
      didn&#8217;t move, and continued to sit there. His face was pale,
      suggesting the electricity had injured him significantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you aren&#8217;t willing to give it a shot, then of course I
      won&#8217;t. But if neither of us are willing to touch it, then being here
      is a waste of time. And for that, I cannot remain. I will leave
      now.&#8221; Han Sen then began walking away.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Yi Dong Mu continued to sit where he was. He didn&#8217;t even try to
      stop Han Sen from exiting.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I really am leaving now.&#8221; Han Sen slowly walked a few more
      steps, making sure Yi Dong Mu could hear him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dong Mu simply scowled at Han Sen and muttered, &#8220;Whatever.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen walked another two steps forward, but then walked back. With a
      smile, he said, &#8220;You must be quite lonely. I shouldn&#8217;t abandon
      you like this; perhaps I should just stay and keep you company.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dong Mu rolled his eyes; he wasn&#8217;t a big fan of Han Sen, that was
      for sure.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen really wanted to get Yi Dong Mu to give it another go. And he
      was afraid that if he left, and Yi Dong Mu managed to crack it open on his
      own, he would take all the egg yolk. That would mean a wasted trip for Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      While both of them were talking, a cracking noise could be heard coming
      from the egg. They both jumped and looked at it.
    </p>

    <p>
      They saw the half-human tall egg had a few cracks on it. Somehow, it was
      beginning to open by itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Yi Dong Mu both jumped up and anxiously watched the egg open.
      If the egg was cracking because they had touched it earlier, then it was
      okay, but if this was a natural occurrence, then they would be in trouble.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      Another cracking noise sounded, and a splintered ravine of cracks now ran
      the length of the egg.
