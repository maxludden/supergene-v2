<p>That massive power, brought down with Yisha’s knife, tore its body in half. The part with the head fell down to roll through the streets of the city.</p>

<p>Han Sen and the others were busy killing the smaller xenogeneics. When Han Sen saw half of its body coming toward him, his first thought wasn’t to get an easy kill; it was to dodge the thing.</p>

<p>The Blue Gold Demon Bug’s lifeforce was scary. Being cut in half wouldn’t kill the creature immediately. And a half- deified elite could kill most weaker beings just by moving its finger.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the other half of the body did not come that way. Yisha teleported over and slashed the head of the beast.</p>

<p>The body was already injured. The head had a few wounds in it, exposing some of its brain. There was no muscle or blood, though. On the inside, the creature was composed of metal machinery and gears.</p>

<p>The Blue Gold Demon Bugs were strange, and this was reflected in their lifeforce. They were beings of metal.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>More breaking sounds were heard. The Blue Gold Demon Bug’s head was chopped in two, opening like a cut watermelon now. Han Sen could see the blue crystal xenogeneic gene that had almost fallen out.</p>

<p>No matter how strong that bug was, that strike ought to have killed it.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw half of its head roll his way. There was still a distance between him and it, but he teleported closer. He went to that half of the head and used his knife to dig out the blue crystal core.</p>

<p>He did not dare to take the xenogeneic gene, but he wanted to test his luck. He wanted to see if he could get an easy kill register by doing so. There was a chance he’d get a beast soul or something.</p>

<p>That half of the head still trembled a little, but after Han Sen removed the core, the body stilled.</p>

<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted. Blue Gold Demon Bug King: xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Blue Gold Demon Bug King beast soul.”</p>

<p>A voice played in Han Sen’s head, and upon hearing it, Han Sen almost thought he could hear a choir of angels singing. It felt like he was going to transcend to a higher plane of existence.</p>

<p>Han Sen just wanted to give it a shot; the chances of actually gaining a beast soul had been virtually nonexistent. Luckily, no one around him knew what had just happened. Han Sen himself was struggling to believe it.</p>

<p>“Good people always have good karma. It is lucky that I have been such a good boy for so long. It hurt to let them kill so many Marquises and Dukes, but now it is all worth it.” Han Sen was ecstatic.</p>

<p>After the Blue Gold Demon Bug King died, the rest of the bugs became frenzied. There was no order or cohesion to their formation, which made the work of killing them a lot easier.</p>

<p>Han Sen quickly lifted the blue crystal core and lobbed it at Yisha. He also shouted, “Queen, you should take this before it gets lost in the fight!”</p>

<p>After that, Han Sen continued killing the Blue Gold Demon Bugs.</p>

<p>Trying to steal the Blue Gold Demon Bug’s xenogeneic gene would be foolish. For now, Han Sen was satisfied with obtaining that King-class beast soul.</p>

<p>Yisha caught the blue crystal core and put it away. She then returned to space to help Black-Moon King and the others kill the other King-class Blue Gold Demon Bugs.</p>

<p>The situation had taken a turn for the better, and the Blue Gold Demon Bugs were no longer much of a threat. Han Sen led Overbearing Teeth Duke in a rush against their foes, killing many bugs and xenogeneics as they went.</p>

<p>When the situation improved further, Han Sen found a chance to take down some Duke Blue Gold Demon Bugs and xenogeneics by himself. He didn’t gain any additional beast souls by doing this, however.</p>

<p>With Yisha’s help, the King-class Blue Gold Demon Bugs were all destroyed. When Yisha rejoined Black-Moon King, the horde of bugs knew that their time of death was nigh.</p>

<p>Many nobles had been killed in Narrow Moon that day, but fortunately, Han Sen had been there to lead a highly-trained team in pulling many of the bugs and xenogeneics away to lessen casualties.</p>

<p>Even so, that bug disaster was the worst crisis Narrow Moon had endured in many centuries.</p>

<p>The bugs that flew to other planets were eventually killed, too. Han Sen found a few Marquise and Duke xenogeneics to claim for himself, and when all was said and done, he had earned quite a bit.</p>

<p>The biggest reward was the mutant King-class beast soul, of course. If the bug’s head hadn’t rolled right in front of him, Han Sen had no idea how long he might have had to wait to benefit from a King xenogeneic. The fact that this one was mutant was just the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>After that fight, Han Sen’s reputation grew even larger. He had led the Dukes to fight the monsters, and his performance that day was given grand compliments by many Narrow Moon nobles.</p>

<p>Sad Night was the one who opened the blue metal cube, so he had unleashed the invasion of the Blue Gold Demon Bugs. He hadn’t been killed, but he had been arrested. He was pending an investigation into his actions. In the end, Han Sen heard nothing about what happened to him.</p>

<p>Han Sen, on the other hand, received a reward from the Full Moon Council. He was the recipient of many geno fluids, which he could use to practice. He was also bestowed many titles and many more benefits.</p>

<p>Han Sen had permission to join Moon Garden, but he wasn’t going to be a student this time. Now he was offered the opportunity of being a teacher.</p>

<p>Yisha wouldn’t let Han Sen join Moon Garden just to become a student. Han Sen had the Teacher title in Sky Palace, and it would be an insult to Sky Palace if he was only a student in Moon Garden.</p>

<p>Aside from all that, though, he received many more rewards. Planet Eclipse was exempt from paying taxes for an additional fifty years, which saved Han Sen a lot of money.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s performance wasn’t the only reason he was so generously rewarded; Yisha played a big part in fighting for what he was given. Without an important figure like her backing him, Han Sen wouldn’t have received half as many rewards.</p>

<p>After all was said and done, though, Yisha called on Han Sen to visit her in the palace.</p>

<p>You did well, but The Story of Genes isn’t Marquise yet. How did you earn so much power?” Yisha randomly asked, while holding Bao’er.</p>

<p>Han Sen had wondered if she might ask this, so he had a lie already prepared. He said, “I practiced Consume. I discovered that Consume can steal the powers of xenogeneics, like these dragon wings. I took them out of Sharon’s xenogeneic gene. And as a result, these dragon wings have the Break Space Flash power.”</p>

<p>Because no one aside from the Consuming Ants could practice Consume, Yisha wouldn’t be able to tell if he was lying.</p>
