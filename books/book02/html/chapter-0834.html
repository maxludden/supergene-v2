    <p>
      Back in the Alliance, Han Sen made plans to go on Skynet and see if anyone
      had encountered any super creatures that would be viable for him to fight.
      With this information, he could return to the sanctuary and slay them. If
      he kept doing this, he believed he&#8217;d max out his super geno points
      in no time.
    </p>

    <p>
      But before he concluded his research, he received a message from Huangfu
      Pingqing, who he hadn&#8217;t seen in a long time. She wanted Han
      Sen&#8217;s advice picking a beast soul in the virtual community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen still had time, and he would be free that night, anyway. So, he
      told her to wait for him in the virtual community. He then logged into
      Skynet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beast souls could not be traded in the Alliance, but they could be used. A
      seller could take pictures of them and sell them in the virtual community.
      If the buyer and seller were in the same shelter, or were at least in
      close proximity, they could take a look at the beast souls in the Alliance
      before contacting each other to establish the trade.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Junior, you are a big hero now. It has been difficult
      getting in touch with you.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing joked to Han Sen as she
      greeted him in the virtual community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen laughed and replied, &#8220;Yeah! If you need to see me again
      after today, you&#8217;re going to have to start booking tickets.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What? Are you the latest, greatest exhibit in the zoo?&#8221;
      Huangfu Pingqing rolled her eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hey, I am a rarer sort than any animal you might find in a
      zoo.&#8221; Han Sen laughed, then asked, &#8220;So, what beast soul are
      you looking to buy today?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have nothing particular in mind. I am just coming to see if there
      are any decent sacred-blood beast souls worth investing in.&#8221; Huangfu
      Pingqing grabbed Han Sen&#8217;s arm and continued forward to the trading
      zone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure.&#8221; Han Sen gave her a thumbs up, appreciating the way
      Huangfu Pingqing made it sound as if she was going to the supermarket for
      groceries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing sighed in response, though. She said, &#8220;I am not
      buying it for myself, I am buying it for my team. I am in charge of
      purchasing the beast souls, not using them.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I can experience what it feels like to spend a whole lot of
      money, without it actually costing me a penny, that&#8217;s great. This is
      the best job ever! You can hire me for this task whenever you
      fancy,&#8221; Han Sen joyously told her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;re not hiring, sorry. I just needed an assistant to
      accompany me.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing smiled and then tugged Han Sen along
      to the trading shop.
    </p>

    <p>
      There, details of a variety of beast souls were on display. Huangfu
      Pingqing searched for sacred-blood beast souls and clicked for more
      information. She was given an unfathomably large slew of data and
      accompanying images.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing was in an enormous human shelter, and many people were
      selling beast souls near her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She clicked on many different beast souls, and each time she did, she
      asked Han Sen for his opinion. Overall, the information he provided was
      lacking, and Huangfu Pingqing seemed to be doing well-enough not to need
      him around.
    </p>

    <p>
      After browsing the trading zone, she suddenly asked Han Sen, &#8220;Are
      you interested in a pet fight?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Is that why you asked me out?&#8221; Han Sen smiled and asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Junior, men need to feign dumbness to make women
      happy,&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing said it in the manner of a jest, but it was
      a truthful admission for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am way past the age in which I need to please women.&#8221; Han
      Sen slumped his shoulders.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In that case, you are terribly incorrect. Men should strive to
      please women their entire lives,&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing rebutted.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Um, let&#8217;s go back to the pet match.&#8221; Han Sen did
      actually believe he needed to improve upon his lacking desire to please
      women.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, in the past few years, humans have been showing a greater
      interest in having pet beast souls. This is especially true in the First
      and Second God&#8217;s Sanctuaries. When humanity began taking control of
      these two sanctuaries, the flesh of creatures was abundant. Over time,
      there were far more free resources available to feed pet beast souls.
      That&#8217;s how things have gotten to where they are now.&#8221; Huangfu
      Pingqing stopped, smiled and then continued, &#8220;The primary reason
      they have gotten so popular of late, however, is you. Your angel pet has
      made many factions turn their focus and attention to the raising of pets.
      That being said, the strongest type of pets they have been able to achieve
      are berserk sacred-blood types. And even those are very rare, even for the
      big factions.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then what is up with the pet matches?&#8221; Han Sen did not want
      to discuss his little angel.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Dong Lin company focuses on pet beast souls the most, and in
      the past few years, people have been buying incredible numbers of pet
      beast souls. With the increase in demand, their worth has tripled.
      It&#8217;s showing no sign of slowing down, either. The prices are still
      rising, and it is the Dong Lin company that is to blame.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked at Hen and continued, &#8220;Recently, they have been having
      pets fight in the Alliance. Very good prizes are offered to those who are
      in first place, and the exclusive Dong Lin medicine that is not available
      for sale is a frequent item up for grabs. And&#8230; well, I need that
      medicine.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You want me to win that medicine for you?&#8221; Han Sen looked at
      Huangfu Pingqing and asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With your angel pet, I don&#8217;t think anything can rightly stop
      you from winning.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing smiled at Han Sen. She blinked
      and fluttered her eyelids to attract him, and then continued by saying,
      &#8220;Of course, I couldn&#8217;t ask this of you for free. Whatever you
      desire, I can satisfy you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen smiled wryly and said, &#8220;Senior, I would really like to help,
      but why would Dong Lin even allow me to join? They would be giving the
      prize out for free. Surely they are not that dumb.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are wrong. Dong Lin themselves want you to join, and that is
      partly why I came looking for you.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing responded with
      immediacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, thinking something was amiss. There was most
      certainly something he had not been told. The people at Dong Lin were not
      dumb, so why would they allow Han Sen to accept a big prize so easily?
      They would be handing out free stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This must be a conspiracy.&#8221; Han Sen was firm in the belief
      this was not normal, and something was going on behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is a match that takes place in the Alliance. No matter how
      brave the Qi family is, they wouldn&#8217;t attack you in public. Are you
      afraid of them?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing pulled out a pamphlet of
      information and continued by saying, &#8220;Take a look at what you can
      receive by winning.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took a look at the list, and there were impressive rewards on
      offer for the top ten that took part. You&#8217;d get even more if you
      were in the top five. The person in first place would receive a ridiculous
      number of goodies. There was plenty of that special medicine that was not
      available for sale, including a type that had a limited run and was
      special even to members of Dong Lin. Having prizes as things that could
      not be bought with money was quite fantastic.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you do win first place, I genuinely hope you can sell me those
      beast pills. Name your price,&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hmm, I&#8217;ll need to sleep on it. I&#8217;ll give you my answer
      sometime in the next couple of days.&#8221; Han Sen saw the first place
      prizes and was shocked, thinking they were far too good.
    </p>

    <p>
      If that medicine was available for general sale, many would buy it for
      exorbitant prices. Han Sen had even wanted some of that medicine before,
      as well, but the opportunity to get it had never come around.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, it could not be bought with money. And you would need the right
      timing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is wrong with that guy in Dong Lin? It is so obvious he seeks
      to offer this stuff to me for free.&#8221; After Huangfu Pingqing left,
      Han Sen started thinking about what was truly going on with this proposed
      pet fight.
