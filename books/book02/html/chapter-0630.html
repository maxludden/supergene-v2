    <p>
      The raven continued to watch them, as if it lacked the motivation to move.
      The red-cloud donkey now drifted over to Han Sen&#8217;s side, which had
      more people, and neighed at them every now and again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the red-cloud donkey come closer, Xu Dong Jin felt at ease. If it
      was the raven that chose to come after them, the danger would be far
      worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a chance of surviving the pursuit of the murder-donkey, but not
      the raven. If it was the raven that chose to be upon them, there would be
      no hope of survival.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although they felt great remorse for the selfless deed Chen Ran had
      proposed, they each wanted to live. And it was because of this they were
      thankful in their hearts and gratefully relieved, as well.
    </p>

    <p>When the timer reached zero, Chen Ran shouted &#8220;Run!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Chen Ran bolted out from beneath the bones as fast as the morning light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Chen Ran run, Xu Dong Jin&#8217;s vigor was re-instilled. He and
      his people left their end of the skeleton, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Queen was about to leave with them, but Han Sen pulled her back. She
      turned to him with a bewildered look, not understanding why he did not
      want to run.
    </p>

    <p>
      But quickly, the Queen realized what was happening. The raven had taken
      flight, but its target was not Chen Ran. It had flown towards the skull.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xu Dong Jin and his people had already made their departure, but the
      donkey was already on their heels. It prevented their return to the safety
      of the skeleton. With no way of turning back, they had no choice but to
      continue on their way down the mountain as they had planned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Queen turned back to look at Chen Ran and noticed he had already run a
      distance of two hundred meters.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like the raven follows the larger crowd.&#8221; The Queen
      frowned at the thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bollocks!&#8221; Han Sen coldly said. &#8220;Chen Ran, that old
      bastard; he played us! The tail may have looked to be a more dangerous
      exit at first, but look closely. Would the skeleton of a creature this
      large only have a tail that was a few meters in length? It is broken off.
      The rest of the tailbone most likely resides below the soil, and
      that&#8217;s why Chen Ran was happy to head in that direction. We may not
      have noticed it, but the creatures are most likely able to sense it.
      That&#8217;s why they have favored chasing us.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The Queen was mortified, &#8220;He led his own people to a
      slaughter?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, the Queen was beginning to understand the situation, as much as she
      would have liked not to. Chen Ran was willing to sacrifice his own
      followers for just a bit more time in his attempt to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That asshole.&#8221; The Queen couldn&#8217;t help but swear. It
      would have been okay if Chen Ran tricked them alone, but it was a wretched
      thing to betray the people you have sworn to lead and nurture. He was
      insane; a man willing to do whatever it took to survive.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, though. The way he did this has given us a
      chance to survive.&#8221; Han Sen said coldly, watching Chen Ran run off
      without stopping.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Queen acknowledged what he meant. Standing inside the ribcage, they
      had nowhere to go. When they heard screams from afar, it told them Xu Dong
      Jin and his people were meeting a grisly end.
    </p>

    <p>
      After ten minutes, the screaming stopped. They must have all been killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the raven and the red-cloud donkey were finished with them, they
      returned. They coldly watched Han Sen and the Queen, who continued hiding
      between the bones of the ribcage. Believing that they were not willing to
      make an exit any time soon, the duo of bloodthirsty creatures took off in
      Chen Ran&#8217;s direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will count to a hundred. When I say &#8216;one hundred,&#8217; we
      run out together from the skull. This will be our only chance of
      escape.&#8221; Han Sen started counting up. He unlocked his gene lock to
      keep track of where the raven and the donkey were.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact they had gone off after the treacherous Chen Ran brought a
      modicum of gladness to their hearts. Once the monsters had gone far
      enough, Han Sen was prepared to make one last run for escape alongside the
      Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he counted to one hundred, he was no longer able to see where the
      raven and donkey were. Acknowledging they had to be a great distance away
      by now, Han Sen knew it was time.
    </p>

    <p>
      They both darted out from beneath the bones like arrows. A little while
      later, Han Sen&#8217;s heart felt as if it was going to leap out of his
      chest. Tugging on the Queen&#8217;s hand, he yelled at her to go back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Queen looked around and did not espy any nearby danger, but she had
      come to trust Han Sen&#8217;s judgment a lot. Without hesitation, she
      returned to the skull with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen retreated, he looked around himself to confirm whether or not
      there was any danger but could not see anything. Still, he trusted his
      instincts and his instincts were telling him to turn back. There was a
      danger of some immediacy in the area, and it was something that could kill
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Running as fast as he could back to the bones, the feeling of danger began
      to choke him. It was getting stronger and stronger. With his gene lock at
      max capacity, the sense of impending doom was unbearable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next moment, a bright light flashed by Han Sen&#8217;s neck. He
      didn&#8217;t hear anything, but he jumped forward. That was when he saw
      the looming black shadow that had crept over him. Blood gushed like a
      bouquet of flowers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if his back was burning. He suspected a bone in his back
      had been broken. But the wound was the least of his concerns right now, as
      he rolled and climbed towards the bones of the ribcage once more. It was a
      life or death gambit, and what had seemed like a short distance to
      traverse, now went on and on instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The raven was furious at its inability to finish off Han Sen. It flapped
      its wings and disappeared once more. When it reappeared again, the
      wingblades of Han Sen&#8217;s nemesis sliced against the back of Han
      Sen&#8217;s neck.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen&#8217;s heart let out a cry, &#8220;It&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      The raven was too powerful, and its speed denied him the ability to dodge.
    </p>

    <p>
      But at that precise moment, when it appeared Han Sen was about to lose his
      head, the dried-vines that strangled the bones came to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were each like toxic snakes, lashing out at the raven that had drawn
      too near to the ribcage. They trapped the beast, and though it pecked and
      swung its wings as hard as it could, the raven could not cut its way free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt a chill. The raven had wanted to kill Han Sen so much, and
      now its body was being dragged into the ribcage he had previously sought
      shelter in. The gourd vines were choking the life out of it as it
      struggled to get free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen froze. He had never expected the seemingly lifeless vines to have
      so much power, power enough to restrain a super creature such as that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now Han Sen understood. The creatures weren&#8217;t afraid of the bones â€“
      they were afraid of the vines that were wrapped around them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having managed to remove the gourd from the vines earlier, Han Sen hoped
      the seemingly-sentient vines did not think poorly of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Han Sen&#8217;s chest pocket, the gourd began to pulsate once more.
      This time, it was stronger than ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bringing out the gourd to hold in his hands, he really did feel like it
      was a heartbeat. Han Sen now knew for sure that this was no trick of his
      mind. The weak pulse was like the heartbeat of a baby. It may have been
      faint, but it was life all the same.
