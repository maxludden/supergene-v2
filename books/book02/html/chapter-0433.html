    <p>
      After traveling through half of the Alliance in spaceship, Han Sen arrived
      at Galaxy Dongyin. When he saw Daphne at a space harbor, Han Sen was
      dazed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Han Sen believed that since even a soldier of its cookhouse was
      a major, Daphne should at least be an advanced warship, if not the best in
      the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the Daphne he saw was more like a small as courtship. Although it
      looks advanced, it did not look like the main ship shows you call the loop
      on all lump the shabby, shabby no matter what.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, Han Sen had never heard that a warship would be docked at a
      civil harbor. In conclusion, Daphne was a weird spaceship.
    </p>

    <p>However, Han Sen did not have any choice but to report to Daphne.</p>

    <p>
      The interior space of Daphne was indeed luxurious, equipped with lots of
      device that Han Sen did not recognize. Only by the warframes assigned to
      the soldiers on board, Han Sen knew the place was unusual.
    </p>

    <p>
      All ordinary soldiers were equipped with military super biological
      warframes made by the renowned Digang. The military line was much better
      than the civil line. These were friends were on the same level as silver
      killer, and the performance of SKTS not even be compared with them. And
      these warframes were already the worst on board.
    </p>

    <p>
      The procedures for the report was very complicated. Han Sen went through a
      lot of tests before he get his clearance. It seemed the security level of
      displaced was indeed very high.
    </p>

    <p>After almost a day, Han Sen eventually went to the cookhouse.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;New soldier Han Sen is here to report to the cookhouse.&#8221; Han
      Sen saluted to the squad leader of the cookhouse.
    </p>

    <p>
      The squad leader was around thirty years old and quite fat. He was almost
      as wide as he was tall. Han Sen felt that was the perfect expression to
      describe him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;So rare that we have someone new in the cookhouse.&#8221; The fat
      squad leader looked Han Sen up and down and smiled. &#8220;Have you
      learned to cook before?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have only learned how to deal with the meat of creatures briefly
      at school, sir,&#8221; answered Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The cookhouse is not like other places, so you could relax a little
      bit. Since you are new here and have not learned how to cook, just try to
      make yourself useful,&#8221; the fat squad leader said as he cooked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like that, Han Sen settled down in the cookhouse. In addition to Han
      Sen, there were five people there: fat squad leader Luo Sanxin, vice
      leader Liu Mingliang, dessert cook Xu Ge, assistant cook Li Jin, and a
      handyman same as Han Sen named Qiu Cheng, who was there one year earlier
      than Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The entire staff of the cookhouse were easy-going. Because of what they
      did, they were not as uptight as other soldiers and had less training as
      well.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after Han Sen reported, Daphne left the harbor and went directly
      to the remote galaxies, which made him quite disappointed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost all soldiers would be equipped with nutrition solutions that were
      easy to carry and store. The role of the cookhouse was more like
      nutritionist in this day and age.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not have much to do every day, because most of his job was
      computerized. If he had the time, Han Sen could even use the teleport
      device on the warship to enter God’s Sanctuary. However, since Han Sen
      just got there, there were many things he needed to learn, so he had not
      the time yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few days of learning, Han Sen had already learned the main
      responsibility of Daphne. Daphne was an exploration ship. Its main job was
      to look for habitable planets in remote galaxies and the rulings of other
      species.
    </p>

    <p>
      The universe was almost infinite. The space occupied by Shura and humans
      were just part of the world known to people. There remained to be many
      unexplored galaxies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, there were various species in the universe. Although at this
      point, humans and Shura were the two most prominent species, before them,
      there used to be other glorious civilizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mission of Daphne this time was to look for a remnant of Crystallizer
      civilization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before humans even entered the interstellar era, the Crystallizers had
      built an empire in the universe. They used to be the master of a dozen
      galaxies, but they eventually became extinct for some reasons no one knew.
      People could only feel how great they were from the relics they left
      behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      When humans entered the interstellar age, Crystallizers had already become
      a legend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike humans and Shura, Crystallizers were a different life form. Their
      whole bodies were made up of crystals, looking like giant diamonds without
      any limbs. However, Crystallizers all had strong mental power.
    </p>

    <p>
      The superpowers often depicted in human movies such as moving something
      with one’s mind that were simply a piece of cake for Crystallizers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this was only the conclusion humans had arrived at after
      consulting the information left behind by Crystallizers. Because no one
      had ever seen a living and breathing Crystallizer, no one was certain if
      that kind of mental power was real.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to the legend about the mental power, Crystallizers had a lot
      of treasures. For example, in their record, strong Crystallizers could
      even control a planet and change its orbit to turn it into their warship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, these were just legends. However, one thing was for sure. The
      memory crystal technology humor was using currently was largely generated
      from the study of Crystallizer science.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Alliance had spared no effort in developing Crystallizer ruins. Their
      research results were always highly confidential, for commoners, they had
      merely heard of the name of Crystallizer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because interstellar travel took large amounts of time, soldiers could
      enter God’s Sanctuary freely if there was no specific mission, as long as
      they returned on time. Especially the cookhouse, except for some special
      days, they actually had a quite flexible schedule and more time to enter
      God’s Sanctuary than other soldiers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had just come back, so he should not leave immediately, given
      there was a lot of things that he was not familiar with.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you looking at?&#8221; After a couple of days, Han Sen had
      become friends with the soldiers of the cookhouse. When he was taking a
      break, he saw the fat squad leader holding his comlink watching a video
      and felt curious.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What else other than the video of Eight Kill? Our fatty has a grand
      vision. He would love to become a fatty who could fly,&#8221; vice squad
      leader Liu Mingliang joked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What Eight Kill?&#8221; Han Sen glanced at the video and couldn’t
      help opening his mouth, because the video the fat squad leader was
      watching was exactly the fight between Lu Bin and himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fuck off. I just want to learn Killer Kicks,&#8221; grunted the fat
      squad leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing his round body and short legs, Han Sen could not imagine what it
      would look like if fat squad leader jumped in the air to make seven kicks.
