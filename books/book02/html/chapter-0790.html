    <p>
      Although Han Sen was unable to trace the path of the Falsified-Sky power,
      it was cast by a human. That meant Han Sen could tell exactly when Luo Yin
      cast the move.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this knowledge, Han Sen should be able to fight in a way that would
      prevent his opponent from casting any Falsified-Sky powers. No matter how
      powerful a skill was, it was pointless if it could not be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was just a thought. He couldn&#8217;t blindly go against
      something like that and expect things to turn out exactly as he
      envisioned. He knew he&#8217;d have to deliberate it more and work out
      exactly how he might break down those attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not an old-fashioned man. He had doubts, so he didn&#8217;t
      venture to the Emerald Lake as planned. Instead, he returned to a human
      shelter so he could go back to the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon his return, he wanted to research and learn as much as he could about
      the Falsified-Sky Sutra. He didn&#8217;t plan on learning it, but Han Sen
      would definitely value a way in which he might break it, if it was ever
      used against him again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Luo family would never expect the Falsified-Sky Sutra they gave Han
      Sen to go unlearned, and he would instead use it to reverse-engineer a
      counter to the very thing they desired him to know.
    </p>

    <p>
      After glossing over a bunch of information, Han Sen stumbled onto
      something rather elucidating.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The power is of the sky but not; it is shura. Power is drawn from
      blackened hearts.&#8221; After reading this sentence, Han Sen sort of
      understood what it meant. The Falsified-Sky power was derived from the
      shura, obtained through the consequence of evil actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      You cannot avoid karma. Once you strike, it is locked-on and unavoidable.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it really was karma, then no one could avoid it. But this Falsified-Sky
      Sutra was created by humans. The karma they created was just a power built
      by the hands of humans.
    </p>

    <p>After Han Sen saw this, his mood began to ease.</p>

    <p>
      The power of humans could always be exhausted; they could not go on
      forever. So, the Falsified-Sky Sutra that never missed had to suffer from
      the same human defect.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If things are like this, then the Dongxuan Sutra should be a
      Falsified-Sky Sutra-buster. Dongxuan is all about seeing opportunities.
      You can observe people, the sky and ground. You can see through everything
      in this world. My dongxuan aura should be able to trace the coming of
      Falsified-Sky power. So, why am I unable to?&#8221; Han Sen had yet to
      come up with a solution to this puzzle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen brought out his Dongxuan Sutra and gave it a read. There was still
      much content he did not understand. The lexicon of its writing was too
      ancient and old.
    </p>

    <p>
      It had been a long time since he last tried reading it, but now here he
      was again with it. He compared it with the Falsified-Sky Sutra, for his
      knowledge of the Dongxuan Sutra had greatly expanded by now.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;So, Dongxuan Sutra can restrict Falsified-Sky Sutra? My dongxuan
      aura should be able to see and predict the path Falsified-Sky powers take.
      But it looks like I lost my way when learning the Dongxuan Sutra, and I
      focused too much on observing energies. Energy is only one component of
      everything in this world, after all.&#8221; Han Sen felt as if he was
      learning more, the more he read. And the more he read, the more he
      realized just how incredible the Dongxuan Sutra really was. The contents
      would undoubtedly shock the world and bring God himself to tears. Still,
      there were many things he was unable to learn to completion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to break the Falsified-Sky
      power. I need to sense destiny and predict karma. Then, it all boils down
      to which combatant is more powerful.&#8221; Han Sen closed his Dongxuan
      Sutra with a far greater understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t choose to immediately change his dongxuan aura. He
      started to review Jadeskin, which he had learned before it. After
      unlocking his first gene lock with Jadeskin, his eighth sense was what
      would enable him to restrict the Falsified-Sky power the most.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he mastered his eighth sense, with the power of space and time, and his
      super sense ability, he wagered he could catch the Falsified-Sky
      power&#8217;s trace.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was already used to dongxuan aura, which was similar enough.
      He rarely made use of his eighth sense, as it was. But now that he had
      read the Dongxuan Sutra again, he had learnt something new. He thought the
      dongxuan aura could include the eighth sense. So, he took a look at its
      specifics again, and got to thinking of a way he could incorporate it
      directly into dongxuan aura. And if he could not do that, he&#8217;d at
      least want to find a way in which he could use both simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Dongxuan Sutra was the real and complete one. He had just been too
      focused on energy patterns and flows before. He had obtained many
      advantages from that, yes, but it resulted in him losing the true meaning
      behind dongxuan aura.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not go back to the sanctuary for a while. He remained where he
      was, practicing the Dongxuan Sutra and Jadeskin, hoping for a
      breakthrough.
    </p>

    <p>
      He thought the Luo family&#8217;s business was too complicated. Even
      though his mom tried her hardest to get away from them, they&#8217;d
      always crop up in an unexpected manner. Han Sen began to think he might
      not be able to completely escape them, either. If there was some conflict
      with the Luo family in the future, this would be his best shot of coming
      out on top.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he didn&#8217;t learn how to overcome the Falsified-Sky Sutra, even if
      he learnt it himself, he would be unable to compete with the Luo family.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dongxuan Sutra, which could predict and foresee every opportunity, was
      his best chance of staying alive if he ever had to do combat with someone
      with a high-tier of the Falsified-Sky Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, Han Sen got to practicing seriously once more. Unfortunately
      for him, however, progress was excruciatingly slow. So, Han Sen decided to
      visit the virtual training camp so he could do battle with real people. He
      would learn much faster through actual combat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan visited the virtual training camp whenever she could, too. She
      always did so in the hopes of meeting up with A Little Soldier on the
      Battleship for some guidance. But it had been a long time since she last
      saw him, and this severely disappointed her.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, on this day, she entered the virtual training camp and went straight
      to her friend list like usual. Much to her surprise, she saw A Little
      Soldier on the Battleship was online.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Coach, are you free?&#8221; Qin Xuan quickly sent a message and
      invited him to her lobby.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw Ms. Perfume&#8217;s invitation arrive and agreed to join. He
      knew Ms. Perfume was Qin Xuan, but Qin Xuan didn&#8217;t know Han Sen was
      A Little Soldier on the Battleship. Therefore, he exercised much caution
      in not allowing her to see who he truly was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan was quite powerful among evolvers, but because of Han Sen&#8217;s
      fitness, she was far weaker than him now.
    </p>

    <p>
      But not everything came down to fitness. The hyper geno arts and combat
      skills she possessed would do well for his practice. That was why he
      agreed to join her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Use all you can to beat me,&#8221; Han Sen said to Qin Xuan after
      entering the arena.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan was happy to hear this and even happier to oblige. She thought
      the reason why he said this was so he could test her power and correct any
      mistakes she made.
    </p>

    <p>
      To have such a powerful elite practice with her was a brilliant thing.
