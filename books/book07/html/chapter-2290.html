<h2>Four Symbols Seal</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2290</h3>

<p>The light symbol hummed on Han Sen’s hand like an energy
converter. When Han Sen sent power into the light symbol, his
energy was transformed into sealing power.</p>
<p>Green Dragon, White Tiger, Red Bird, and Black Turtle. Four
beasts made up the symbols, and Han Sen was represented by the Red
Bird. As his power flowed into the symbol, the symbol swirled
around in his hand like a flaming bird.</p>
<p>Mister White stepped in front of one xenogeneic clone and
directed Han Sen, Crime, and the blood kirin to stand on either
side of and behind the creature.</p>
<p>This was a powerful seal that normally required many people to
do what they were attempting to. It wouldn’t be an easy task in the
midst of combat, that was for sure. Usually, a person would use
this technique to seal a creature that was already under their
control. The technique took far too long to be useful in a
fight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the xenogeneic clone wasn’t going to attack them
during their free day. It stood there, unmoving, increasing their
chances of sealing it successfully.</p>
<p>The first attempt went smoothly. Han Sen and the others
surrounded the xenogeneic from four different directions. They
weren’t attacked, and the xenogeneic simply stood there looking at
them.</p>
<p>Mister White waved at Han Sen and the others, indicating they
should rest a little. It was still early in the day, after all. If
they fully committed to the sealing right then, they’d be wasting
some of their strength. They needed to seal the creature at the
last moment possible in order to save every smidgen of energy they
had.</p>
<p>After a minute of thought, Han Sen said, “Since they aren’t
attacking us now, why don’t we at least try the sealing to see if
it works?”</p>
<p>“You don’t trust Mister White? Even if the seal doesn’t work, do
you have another way out of this?” Crime asked in a cold voice.</p>
<p>“There is nothing wrong with giving it a try,” Han Sen responded
flatly.</p>
<p>Mister White nodded. “Okay, then let us try. It will be a useful
practice run.”</p>
<p>Following Mister White’s command, Han Sen and the others cast
the Four Symbols Seal. The symbol of the red bird shivered on Han
Sen’s hand. He felt a connection form between the bird and Mister
White’s white tiger, Crime’s black turtle, and the green dragon
that hovered around the blood kirin’s claws.</p>
<p>All those powers were transferred, and the Four Symbols Seal’s
light became stronger. The connection between them
strengthened.</p>
<p>The four powers supported each other, and as the light rose,
four giant shadows formed into a bai sema that trapped the creature
inside.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic found itself confined within the bai sema. Its
eyes flashed, and the enemy started to move.</p>
<p>“Oh no! It is going to attack us. Seal the bai sema now!” Mister
White shouted loudly.</p>
<p>The four of them quickly finished casting the Four Symbols Seal.
The shadows of the green dragon, the white tiger, the red bird, and
the black turtle were cast onto the xenogeneic’s body. The shadows
bound the xenogeneic.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic kept moving as Han Sen and the others continued
casting their seal. The four shadows kept seething across the
xenogeneic. The xenogeneic tried to fight back, but it couldn’t
break the seal.</p>
<p>Crime looked ill, and he said, “I told you to trust Mister
White, but you just had to try it! Now we’ve wasted so much more of
our power.”</p>
<p>“What’s done is done. We will just have to hold the seal and
keep it going for the next ten days,” Mister White said firmly,
putting an end to Crime’s complaining.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged slightly and remained silent. He had known this
was a possibility, but he thought they should give it a try
anyway.</p>
<p>Attempting the seal now would only anger one xenogeneic. If it
failed, only one powerful creature would be trying to kill them.
But if they failed closer to the end of the first day, they might
end up being attacked by whole groups of the monsters.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen would rather spend a bit more energy now than risk
everything later on.</p>
<p>Aside from the struggling xenogeneic in the seal, the other
xenogeneics just maintained their stances and their expressionless
stares. When Han Sen’s group confirmed that they weren’t going to
be attacked by the monsters around them, they felt greatly
relieved.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic kept struggling. Although its power was sealed,
it still had a deified body. Han Sen and the others had to use all
their power to hold the seal against the raw, physical strength of
the creature’s thrashing.</p>
<p>Mister White and the blood kirin were half-deified, so they had
an easier time. Crime was a top dog of the Kings, so he was holding
up well, too.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had only just become a Duke. He hadn’t been a Duke
for very long, so his power was lacking in comparison to the
others. He had to use all of his strength just to keep the red
bird’s symbol of light up.</p>
<p>Mister White looked at Han Sen and said, “A Duke’s element is
separate from your original body’s astral body and celestial body.
Your original body is your own genes taking the form of an element.
At that stage, you must use your own power to fight. At the second
stage, your astral body needs to rely on the planet beneath you.
Planetary powers can be used to aid the elements of your body. For
instance, a water element Duke will perform much better on a
water-based planet.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Mister White continued to say, “The celestial
body you can access in the third stage is also known as your
universal body. That body can use the power of the universe. As
long as it is not separated from the universe for some reason, it
has access to practically unlimited power.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what Mister White was talking about, but he
had only just become a Duke. He only had his original body, so he
couldn’t make use of any external powers.</p>
<p>Plus, even if he did gain a celestial body, he knew that Holy
Town was separated from the outside world. He couldn’t access any
power that was outside the town.</p>
<p>Mister White knew what Han Sen was thinking, and so he smiled.
“Judging by the way you use your body, you must still be at the
first stage. You only have your original body. I have an original
body geno art that might be able to help you. Perhaps you could
learn it in order to ascend more easily.”</p>
<p>“If you are really willing to teach me, I would be very
grateful.” Han Sen was surprised. He hadn’t expected Mister White
to volunteer to teach him a geno art, and he wasn’t sure what the
sudden offer meant.</p>
<p>“Mister White, why do you care about him!” Crime exclaimed
unhappily.</p>
<p>Mister White smiled. “We are cooperating to maintain the seal,
aren’t we? We are all in this together. Han Sen is of a lower level
than us, so he will have a hard time over the course of the next
ten days. If anything happens to him, we will all be destroyed. I
am only doing this for myself.”</p>
<p>After Mister White said that, Crime fell silent.</p>
<p>Mister White paused for a moment before speaking. “My geno art
isn’t very impressive. I made it myself, and I never did think up a
name for it. It hasn’t been presented anywhere. I’ll explain it as
best I can, and if you think it helps, you can use it. If it
doesn’t, that’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Please tell me,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>In a quiet voice, Mister White gave a straightforward
explanation of the geno art. Crime and the blood kirin focused on
his words as well.</p>
<p>Crime listened seriously. Just like Mister White said, his geno
art seemed rather simple. Even so, it was obviously quite special.
Despite its simplicity, it was incredibly difficult to
understand.</p>
<p>“Mister White, your geno art is so complicated. I am afraid he
won’t be able to understand it,” Crime said after hearing Mister
White’s geno art.</p>
