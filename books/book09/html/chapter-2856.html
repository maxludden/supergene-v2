<p>Holding the Sky Vine Radish God Lance, Han Sen opened the door of the next palace. He saw a xenogeneic inside that looked like a lion. He lifted the Sky Vine Radish God Lance and struck it.</p>

<p>It was a butterfly class xenogeneic. Because it was not Han Sen’s opponent anymore, he skipped it and did not bother killing it.</p>

<p>Han Sen was now butterfly class. Killing it would have been a trivial task.</p>

<p>The most important thing was that Han Sen wanted to use it to test out the Sky Vine Radish God Lance’s power.</p>

<p>Han Sen was pretty suspicious about the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. He thought it might work like the phoenix feather, which did not do anything to ordinary creatures and only dealt damage to gods.</p>

<p>The Sky Vine Radish God Lance shone with a green light. It pierced through the xenogeneic’s chest. Even Han Sen was shocked. The god personality armaments were able to be used on ordinary creatures.</p>

<p>Han Sen pulled back his Sky Vine Radish God Lance. He did not see god blood come out. He saw saplings growing out of the wound. They grew like mad. In the blink of an eye, they had weaved together like an old vine to wrap up the xenogeneic’s entire body. It was like a giant vine egg.</p>

<p>The vine egg died quickly. When the old vine had wilted and detached itself from the creature, the xenogeneic no longer had a life force. It had become a dried-up husk.</p>

<p>“Xenogeneic butterfly hunted. God Power Lion: deified xenogeneic gene found.”</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, Han Sen was a bit unnerved. A butterfly class creature had been killed with one hit by the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. The old vines that grew from the wound had sucked the creature’s life dry. That was more chilling than using a knife to kill it.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought about the prospect of old vines growing out of his own body. It gave him goosebump. He shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>“The power of this lance is as good as the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. With my power now, I should be able to use the shield and Charming God Jian. I also have Purgatory Heaven, a Nine Spin Destiny Mirror, and Siren Bottle. Even if I don’t use Super God Spirit mode, I should be able to battle a true god class elite.” Han Sen had never fought a true god class elite before. He was not sure.</p>

<p>“The Nine Spin Destiny Mirror and Siren Bottle do not seem to have attacking powers. They are unique treasures, and Little Angel has Purgatory Heaven. I can only use the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze and Charming God Jian. Hm, maybe I can use the Charming God Jian. Right now, I won’t be consumed by that weapon’s power.” Han Sen noticed he had amassed quite the trove of treasures. Although quite a few of them had unique powers, only a few of the treasures could not be used in combat.</p>

<p>Of course, most of those items had been collected when Han Sen was Han Sen. So he did not plan on using them in the god fight.</p>

<p>“If luck is on my side, one Sky Vine Radish God Lance should be enough to get me into the top 100.” Han Sen kept stroking the Sky Radish God Lance. He really liked it.</p>

<p>Han Sen returned to the garden. God was sitting on a chair, watching the god fights.</p>

<p>“You came back just in time. This should be the best match so far. Come and watch it.” God smiled at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the geno god list’s space battleground. He saw there was an unfamiliar Dragon in space. Although he did not know anything about the beast, he could tell it was grossly frightening.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the match list. He saw the fighters were Dragon One and Demon Alpha.</p>

<p>“That is not the Dragon One I know. That must be the Dragon One from the previous generation. I suppose it is the Dragon One that is around the same age as Sky Palace Leader. I wonder what sort of deified it is.” Han Sen looked at the space battleground, but he could not see Demon Alpha.</p>

<p>Han Sen was far more interested in Demon Alpha. That was perhaps because the Demons seemed to have a connection with the Shura. Han Sen thought Demon Alpha was the first of the Shuras to enter the geno universe.</p>

<p>“It has only been a hundred years, yet this Dragon has gone from being primitive to true god,” God said. “He must have used a Dragon blood skill. Otherwise, that feat would have been impossible.”</p>

<p>Han Sen did not understand, so he asked, “What blood skill?”</p>

<p>God replied, “The Dragons have one of the most talented geno arts. When a Dragon grows old, they can put their gene blood power into another Dragon’s body. Thus, the other Dragon’s genes grow very fast. Many races have a similar geno art, but to do it very well…only the Dragons can do that. The Buddha learned this from the Dragons. Through their own modifications, they composed a geno art that was very similar. It is much more annoying to use than a Dragon blood skill, and the effects are not as good as this blood skill.”</p>

<p>“True god class Dragon? Is Demon Alpha going to lose?” Han Sen was confused. He looked at God as he spoke.</p>

<p>Because God said the fight would be an amazing one if Demon Alpha were surely going to lose, what would be so amazing about that?</p>

<p>Han Sen did not believe Demon Alpha could fight a true god class Dragon One. After all, the Demons were a younger race. Their ranks were not too high among the higher races. It was hard to believe the Demons would have a true god class elite in their ranks.</p>

<p>In fact, many creatures were thinking the same thing. No one believed Demon Alpha could defeat Dragon One. After all, Dragons had the recognition of being the world’s bravest. When they reached true god class, their power was unimaginably strong. They were able to resist 99.9% of an elemental attack. It was like they had unbreakable bodies.</p>

<p>“Mister Palace Leader, if Dragon One wins two more times, you can continue the geno being scroll fights. I do not know who will be the dead dear.” A woman smiled at Sky Palace Leader.</p>

<p>Back during the geno being scroll fight, Sky Palace Leader suppressed Dragon One and earned the top King class rank. Dragon One was second.</p>

<p>Sky Palace Leader laughed. “He lost to me once. He will never be able to beat me again. No matter how many times he fights me, the results will always be the same. Besides, he needs to beat Demon Alpha.”</p>

<p>“The demons are not powerful yet,” the woman casually said. “How could Demon Alpha beat Dragon One, who is a true god class?”</p>

<p>“It is difficult to say,” Sky Palace leader said. “There are problems with the history of the Demons. Their Sky Demon power has casual powers. You cannot underestimate this race. Plus, the Demons have been a high race for a while now. Unfortunately, no one knows what Demon Alpha’s power is like. Not even Sky Palace has that sort of information. You can tell this Demon Alpha is unique.”</p>

<p>The woman did not agree with what Sky Palace Leader was saying. “They are merely pretending to be mysterious. Even if Demon Alpha has talents and endurance, there is nothing they can do without resources. With the small number of resources the Demons have, I would be surprised if they had a butterfly in their midst. Either way, they will not have a true god class unless they are like Dragon One and have a scary senior pass in their blood genes. Otherwise, how else could he become a true god? How could he hope to fight Dragon One?”</p>

<p>While they were talking, a shadow entered the space battleground. That shadow was completely dark. It was like a humanoid shadow walking through space but with a body that did not look real.</p>

<p>Han Sen gathered up power. He wanted to see through the shadow and see what the Demon Alpha looked like, but all he could see was darkness. He could not see what Demon Alpha looked like.</p>
