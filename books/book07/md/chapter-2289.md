Han Sen wondered if Sacred Leader had played a joke on them. They were surrounded by so many deified xenogeneics, and Han Sen had just recently become a Duke. Not even the deified elites that Han Sen knew would have stood a chance against all the powerful xenogeneics that had gathered.

“It’s a trap!” Han Sen couldn’t think of any way he could fight off the amount of power that had been arrayed against him.

Even if he refined thirteen deified blood pulses, he would only gain their blood pulse abilities. His own level wouldn’t ascend to deified status, and he would still most likely be killed.

On top of that, he didn’t have the time to refine another twelve deified blood pulses.

“Is the jade flute in Fox Queen’s hands the key to getting through this? Perhaps there is a song that can be played to soothe and lull all of the deified xenogeneics. It might subdue them without the need for fighting at all,” Han Sen thought. It was pointless since they didn’t have the flute, though.

Mister White and Crime were just as shocked by the situation they had found themselves in. There was no way for them to run. They were surrounded by too many powerful xenogeneics. Even if the ruler of the Extreme King came personally to save them, it wouldn’t do any good.

All of those scary creatures gathered in the plaza, and it became quite crowded as they filed in. The creatures watched the small group, and the weight of those eyes put fear into Han Sen and even Mister White.

The deified xenogeneics drew closer, pushing Han Sen and the others toward the center of the palace. There was no way to withdraw. And suddenly, the jade cat coughed twice.

Cough! Cough!

After the jade cat coughed, the deified xenogeneics halted their advance. They did not get any closer to Han Sen, but they did not walk away, either. They simply remained where they were, staring expressionlessly at Han Sen’s group.

The jade cat looked at Han Sen and smiled. “Don’t be afraid. They will not attack you just yet. You guys have one day to travel anywhere in this city you desire. For this one day, they will not be permitted to bring you any harm. If you guys are still alive after ten days, then you will have passed the test.”

“We’ll be hounded by one hundred deified xenogeneics. How are we expected to survive ten whole days inside the city?” Han Sen wanted to bargain for some better terms.

The jade cat smiled. “They are not really deified xenogeneics. They are just the clones of deified xenogeneics that Sacred Leader created. Each of them can only unleash a single deified attack. After one attack, they will die. So, you guys still have a minuscule chance of surviving. Try your best! Oh, and right, I forgot to tell you guys: if you get into a fight with a deified xenogeneic clone, the others will back off. Only one can attack you at a time. The others won’t interfere.”

“Right! The test starts now. Try your best to survive. You have one full day to hide. You can hide anywhere you wish inside the holy town.” The jade cat statue laid down after speaking, settling itself as if it was sleeping again. It looked like an ordinary jade statue. Han Sen could no longer sense any life force in it.

Han Sen tried asking it a few more questions, but the jade cat statue did not respond. All that was left were the scary deified xenogeneic clones looking at them.

“Let’s go! We only have one day. This is our one chance of surviving,” Mister White said, then he stepped into the crowd of xenogeneics.

The scary deified xenogeneics clones parted to form a path for him. The creatures wouldn’t stop them from leaving.

Han Sen followed Mister White out of the plaza. One hundred scary deified xenogeneics watched them walk away, but none of the creatures chased after them.

“Mister White, do you have a plan that can help us escape this predicament?” Han Sen asked.

Mister White shook his head. “I am fairly sure that exiting the holy town is out of the question, to be honest with you. The only way we can get through the next ten days is to hide somewhere that the deified clones cannot find us. But I doubt that the Sacred Leader created a game of hide-and-seek out of boredom. He must have some other purpose here. So, no matter where we hide, we can be sure that the xenogeneics will find us.”

“Sir, what are you saying? Should we hide or should we not hide?” Crime asked with confusion. Mister White had described the results of both options, and neither one sounded good.

Han Sen laughed. “Mister White explained it so clearly. We need to hide for ten days, but even so, we will be found. That suggests that there is only one way in which we can hide.”

“And what way is that?” Crime still didn’t understand.

Han Sen had no choice but to explain. “Did the jade cat statue not tell you clearly enough? If we are fighting one xenogeneic, the others will leave us alone until the fight is finished. So, we need to fight one sole xenogeneic for all ten days. If we do that, the other xenogeneics might as well not even exist.”

“I see. But how do we engage just one xenogeneic for that long? Didn’t the jade cat statue say that the deified xenogeneics here are cloned? After one strike, their bodies will break,” Crime asked.

“That is something you will have to ask Mister White about. Mister White came up with the plan first. I am sure he’s already thought of contingencies.” Han Sen looked at Mister White.

“I do have a few ideas, but ensuring our survival over the next ten days will require the four of us to cooperate.” Mister White explained his plan.

When Han Sen and Crime heard it, they thought the suggestion was way too risky. However, they couldn’t think of any alternative courses of action, so they agreed to do it.

The four of them didn’t leave the plaza to hide. They tried to leave Holy Town just to see if they could, but after that, they went back to the plaza.

Their day of waiting seemed to drag on and on. They could have spent the time hiding deep within the town, but they all knew that it would have been a pointless exercise.

No matter how big Holy Town was, it was still just a town. The deified xenogeneics could use the power of their minds to scour the entire town for their prey. There were more than a hundred deified xenogeneics there, so finding Han Sen’s group would be easy.

Mister White’s plan relied on using their single day of peace to prepare.

What came next would be simple. Mister White would familiarize himself with one of the deified xenogeneics, taking advantage of the creature’s temporary docility to use his sealing techniques on it. Once he had sealed the deified clone’s power, it wouldn’t be able to use its deified strike. That way, they could draw out the fight to last for the entire ten days.

The deified xenogeneic would still be exceptionally strong, of course. Although only one strike needed to be sealed, it was a deified power. Mister White could not seal the power by himself. He needed the combined might of Han Sen, the blood kirin, and Crime to help him complete the seal.

The three of them resigned themselves to the plan. As long as they didn’t attack the other deified clones, the clones would just stand there in the plaza and stare at them.

“Remember, my Four Symbols Seal requires four people to function. So, once the sealing begins, none of you can move. You have to keep sending power into the seal. If we lose anyone’s power, the seal will break,” Mister White said seriously. Then he sent a wave of energy into Han Sen, Crime, and the blood kirin. Strange, new symbols of light appeared on their hands.
