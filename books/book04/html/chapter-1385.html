    <p>
      Han Sen watched as his geno core was being reinforced. Each beam of light
      was a reinforcement, and after nine such beams, the process was finished.
      Immediately, Han Sen could tell the egg had become much stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rockman finished, Han Sen took the egg back into his possession. Its
      shape was very much the same, but it featured a prismatic glow in its
      interior. It shone with nine separate colors. It could make for a
      stunningly pretty gemstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like my genes and skills are just too d*mn good. The geno core
      that I created took first place. Hah. Was there any doubt who was the
      best? I’m not even sure why I was surprised.” Han Sen had let it go to his
      head a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought the black crystal must have helped somewhat, but he firmly
      believed it was primarily a product of his own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it had been reinforced nine times, however, the egg still
      couldn’t kill creatures outright. It couldn’t even inflict the minor
      damage. It did make Han Sen wonder how it could be worthy of so simply
      securing first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his goal of becoming number one complete so soon, Han Sen was a
      little at a loss on what he should do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the Crystal Core secured the number one position, the Bulwark Umbrella
      can’t be very far behind, can it? It’s saved my life more than the egg
      has, after all.” Han Sen wondered what the result might be for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he wasn’t keen on testing that out just yet. And that aside, he needed
      to accept a challenge first.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen had not entered, he wouldn’t have to comply with the Geno Core
      Storage’s quota. Now that he had entered, however, he was required to
      fight at least once a month to maintain his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he lost a fight, his nine reinforcements would still be in place. But
      if he did not comply with the once-a-month quota, and didn’t show up to
      battle a challenger, the reinforcements would be wiped and he’d have to
      start all over, without the benefit of a test-skip.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, no matter what, Han Sen had to make Shadow Shelter work and keep it
      operational so he could fight at least once a month in the Geno Core
      Storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all geno cores could challenge him, however. Only cores within one
      level of his own could challenge. And since the Crystal Core was number
      one, the challengers who could fight him had to be within the one-to-ten
      bracket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was only a once-a-month thing, Han Sen was eventually going to
      enter his Bulwark Umbrella as well, and the same requirements would apply
      to that. But they stacked, and that meant Han Sen would have to battle
      twice a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Han Sen would eventually formulate a geno core for the
      Blood-Pulse Sutra and his super king spirit. While that would mean he
      would have to fight four times a month, that wasn’t where his biggest
      issue lay. Rather, it would make hiding his identity a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen mulled this over, Rockman suddenly spoke to him. He said, “King
      Bell of the Second Rank wishes to challenge you. Heart Wheel of the Fourth
      Rank wishes to challenge you…”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen was told that at least seven others wished to challenge him.</p>
    <p>
      None of them were too concerned with becoming first place; rather, they
      just wanted to know what power the elusive Crystal Core wielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from Real Demon and the combatant at number nine, the top ten had
      all requested a battle with Han Sen. Han Sen viewed the list of
      competitors and pondered which he should fight first.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t as if he could avoid the fight, either. If he didn’t fight, his
      reinforcements would be removed and he’d be back to where he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn’t afraid, though. Han Sen had a lot of confidence in himself, and
      he didn’t think anyone of the bronze geno core tier could defeat him. Even
      if he had to battle the son of an emperor who had a bronze geno core, Han
      Sen wouldn’t be afraid. He had what it took.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even Han Sen himself wished to test out the powers of the Crystal Core
      now. It had improved a great deal, but what those improvements were, he
      wouldn’t have a clue until he tested it in battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen decided on accepting the challenge from Heart Wheel. He was
      the highest rank of the members that came from Sacred Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was still pining for revenge over what had transpired in Hidden
      Valley. He wasn’t going to waste a single opportunity to exact vengeance
      on the people that occupied that wretched place. He was out for blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen did not wish to expose his identity. If they learned
      who he was and came after him, Shadow Shelter would be destroyed in no
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hmm, it would be best if I hid my identity.” Han Sen donned a set of
      armor and removed any pieces of apparel or clothing that might give away
      his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Challenge declined. Desired opponent has accepted another challenge.” God
      King was disappointed, hearing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God had a different reaction, however, for he heard his
      Rockman say, “Challenge accepted. Desired opponent has accepted your
      challenge request.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The bronze geno core tablet then warped itself to form a black hole of
      sorts. It was a tunnel that would lead the opponents to their designated
      fighting grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God flapped his black wings and did not hesitate a second
      before flying through the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon arrival, Black Mountain God examined the place of battle. It was an
      ancient city, half-buried amidst a desert. An aura of mystique and secrecy
      permeated the atmosphere of that place, hinting at a wild and untold
      history that lay buried beneath its sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The powers of geno cores were all different, so the battlegrounds changed
      to suit the challengers and avoid providing any environmental hindrances
      to the cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God then saw his opponent emerge from another black
      void-tunnel. He locked him in his sights.
