<h3>Chapter 2442</h3>

<p>Han Sen pulled the broken sword out of Red Cloud’s hand and
swung it across the face of the statue. A deep furrow was gouged
into the statue’s face, and blood started to leak from it. The
statue didn’t move, however. The statue wasn’t as hard as Han Sen
had expected, though. After a few more of those strikes, the stone
statue’s head fell off.</p>
<p>The severed neck of the statue gushed blood, but it was just a
statue. Where the blood came from, Han Sen had no idea.</p>
<p>Strangely, once Han Sen cut off the head of the statue, it
didn’t behave like the Blood Eye Evil God had upon being
decapitated. Instead of getting stronger or fighting back, it
simply died.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the statue again to confirm what he thought he
saw. The statue was dying. It dried up like a withered plant. It
looked somewhat like a bergamot flower. The stalk and its flowers
were dark red. The stone head that had been lopped off was the
plant’s largest blossom.</p>
<p>“It is a plant!” Han Sen remarked in surprise. He didn’t hear
any killing announcement, which made him doubt that the plant was
actually a creature.</p>
<p>After the flower died, Miss Mirror’s red eyes started to fade.
It looked like the red-eye powers were finally gone.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror, however, was too injured to rejoice. She remained
on the ground, unable to rise. Han Sen put an arm around her back
and helped her sit up. “What happened? Why is Red Cloud here? Why
are you hurt?”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror opened her mouth but struggled to speak. “Something
happened back at base camp. We need to go back now.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, his face turned grey. Without asking
any further questions, he simply picked up Miss Mirror. With her in
one arm and Lady Wan’er in the other, he sprinted back to the stone
fields.</p>
<p>When they reached what was left of the base, their hearts sank.
What Han Sen saw sickened him. The base had become a ruin and been
painted red with the blood and gore of its inhabitants. No one was
left alive.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror looked terrible. A third of Spring Rain’s members
had been brought there, and now they were all gone. Furthermore,
one of the four Kings was dead, and Red Cloud had been reduced to a
King class soldier. Miss Mirror had lost so much.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face looked awfully glum, too. He feared Ning Yue and
Bao’er might have been killed in the carnage.</p>
<p>“Dad?” Han Sen turned to begin searching through the rubble of
the ruin, but all of a sudden. Bao’er emerged over the top of one
heap. It was like a mountaintop. She jumped onto Han Sen’s chest
and wrapped her small arms tightly around his neck.</p>
<p>“Bao’er!” Bao’er was okay, and as she clung to his neck, Ning
Yue and Falling Leaf came over the rubble, too. Han Sen was so
overjoyed that he dropped Miss Mirror to wrap his arms around
Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Miss Mirror was too injured to catch herself, and she
hit the ground hard. She coughed up some blood and looked rather
angered at being suddenly dropped.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror!” Falling Leaf ran over to pick Miss Mirror up. She
imbued her superior with some of her healing powers.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother, I am too injured for that. I won’t heal quickly
regardless, so just tell me what happened,” Miss Mirror said
abruptly, wiping some of the blood from her mouth.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf told her everything that had transpired, but for
some reason, she left out the part with the white-haired man and
the conversation he had shared with Bao’er. She also left out the
bit regarding the little bird becoming a fiery phoenix. She only
said that, after the white-haired man appeared, the people of the
base went crazy. They all started killing each other until none of
them remained.</p>
<p>But for some reason, a few of them had been unaffected. They
were able to escape amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>“That white-haired man, where did he come from?” Miss Mirror
asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. When we first saw him, he was already walking
around the base and everyone was going insane,” Falling Leaf said
with a shake of her head.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror suddenly had a thought, and she turned her gaze back
to Falling Leaf. “That stone. Go and see if the stone is still
there.”</p>
<p>“We’ve already looked,” Falling Leaf answered. “The stone is
gone.”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror sighed and said, “Go find Red Cloud and bring her
back here. We will have to wait for reinforcements to arrive.</p>
<p>Han Sen handed the broken sword to Falling Leaf. She went to the
stone fields and brought the frozen Red Cloud back. Although the
red-eye power had vanished from the rest of them, Red Cloud was
still crazed, and her eyes were still clouded with that shade of
red. After she was released, she again tried to attack everyone
around.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to freeze her once more. When the reinforcements
came, he was going to let them deal with it.</p>
<p>As for Miss Mirror, Han Sen knew why she had been injured so
badly. Han Sen had taken too long, and Miss Mirror had been
reaching the limits of her ability to withstand the red-eye power.
Then the feelings of addiction had suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror thought Han Sen had sorted out the red-eye problem,
and so she felt relieved.</p>
<p>But just as she was starting to relax, that addicted feeling
washed over her again, and this time it was a few hundred times
stronger. The attraction drew Miss Mirror back toward the original
statue, and Miss Mirror could no longer resist it.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s mind was still quite clear, but her will was no
longer strong enough to control the urge. When she approached the
statue, she noticed that Red Cloud had come there, too.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror was thrilled for a moment, as she thought Red Cloud
might be able to use the broken sword to break the statue. But Red
Cloud was crazy, and she attacked Miss Mirror as soon as she saw
her.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror couldn’t control her own body well enough to fight
Red Cloud, and so Red Cloud beat her to the brink of death. Miss
Mirror had been left lying on the ground, struggling to remain
conscious.</p>
<p>What happened next chilled Miss Mirror’s blood, though. Red
Cloud bowed before the statue and began praying. From what Miss
Mirror could understand, Red Cloud wanted to use her as some sort
of offering. Han Sen had come in time, thank God. If he hadn’t,
Miss Mirror would have been killed.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this was very suspicious, too. He didn’t fully
understand what was going on.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept Wan’er close. If she was any distance at all from
Han Sen, her eyes and hair would start to turn gold. The further
away from him she was, the faster she would turn.</p>
<p>Han Sen experimented with it a little. Wan’er couldn’t be ten
meters away from him. Otherwise, even in her coma-like state, her
hair would turn gold.</p>
<p>And when Wan’er was within ten meters of Han Sen, his ability to
use his super god spirit power was greatly diminished. The power
would begin to fade as soon as he summoned it. The closer to Wan’er
he was, the faster it faded.</p>
<p>Clearly, the two of them had a dramatic effect on each other.
Luckily, though, the effect only limited Han Sen’s super god spirit
body; his other powers remained intact.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Miss Mirror not to say anything about Wan’er. Han
Sen didn’t think Miss Mirror would agree to his request, so it was
a surprise for him when she actually assented. She did, however,
have a condition of her own regarding the secret.</p>
<p>“What? You want me to be an offering?” Han Sen looked at Miss
Mirror with wide eyes.</p>
