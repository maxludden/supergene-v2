    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Yu Qielan&#8217;s body shattered the atmosphere. It was as if he
      teleported directly in front of Huang Xiao, with his big hand reaching out
      for the young man&#8217;s head.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, it was too late for Huang Xiao to dodge. It was difficult
      to comprehend what Yu Qielan had just done all of a sudden. Whatever it
      was, his speed had increased exponentially. There was nothing Huang Xiao
      could do.
    </p>

    <p>
      He gritted his teeth as a golden light enveloped his body. His fist
      gleamed like molten gold as he cast it forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was not aiming to deflect Yu Qielan&#8217;s fist, however; he was
      aiming for his chest. With his life on the line, he was ready to risk it
      all for the sake of landing one devastating blow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This Huang Xiao is good.&#8221; Han Sen and the rest of the crowd
      were very supportive of his efforts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huang Xiao&#8217;s speed and power were lacking against Yu Qielan, but he
      was adaptive. If he maintained his defensive posture, he&#8217;d be
      delaying an inevitable loss and would never find a chance to strike back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huang Xiao knew this all too well, and that was why he decided not to
      deflect whatever Yu Qielan was about to do. He knew his strength and speed
      weren&#8217;t a match for his opponent, so he was willing to risk it all
      for any attack he could make.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was not being reckless, though. Huang Xiao was very good when it came
      to timing, and he had complete control of his body. His strike would
      surely land no matter what. Even though Yu Qielan was stronger, Huang Xiao
      could inflict damage of his own. And at the very least, Huang Xiao had
      Golden Buddha on his side.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although there was a chance of getting severely injured or even dying,
      Huang Xiao made this decision of his own volition. This was something Han
      Sen greatly admired, and he was taken aback by how fearless and devoted to
      the fight Huang Xiao was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone watched the two fists with their eyes open wide. That single
      moment seemed to take a lifetime for the people who watched it unfold,
      hovering at the edge of their seats.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was especially true for the four people who most worried over Huang
      Xiao&#8217;s wellbeing. Their hearts were already pounding heavily, as if
      for a release from their chests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The demigod human and royal shura would step in if their people were in
      danger. But right now, no one knew who was going to emerge victorious.
      Although the combatants were reaching a critical stage in their fight, all
      they could do was watch. And furthermore, whichever aide stepped in to
      help would lead to their fighter&#8217;s forfeiture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huang Xiao was already knee-deep in this situation, and stopping him now
      would be a worse fate than if he were to die.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The moment Huang Xiao&#8217;s fist struck Yu Qielan&#8217;s chest, Yu
      Qielan&#8217;s fist hit Huang Xiao&#8217;s head.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Aargh!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Huang Xiao shouted. He fell to the ground with his face drenched in blood,
      looking grievously wounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yu Qielan was hit, but he was still standing tall. He looked at his
      opponent on the ground with disdain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The demigod stepped forward and called for the immediate aid of a doctor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone&#8217;s eyes were glued to the stage, and their minds held out
      hope that Huang Xiao would be okay. Winning was important, but it
      wasn&#8217;t worth a young man&#8217;s life. They all wished him to be
      fine.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, sorry. I believe I may have hit you a little too hard,
      there.&#8221; Yu Qielan&#8217;s words may have sounded apologetic on
      paper, but his arrogant face betrayed their meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You have great skill. We lost,&#8221; the demigod said, as he
      coldly looked upon the shura.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Feng, who was standing next to Han Sen, looked murderous and said,
      &#8220;That Yu Qielan must die for this. If I ever meet him again, I will
      kill him.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why is that?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Lin Feng. He knew him quite
      well, and thought what he had said was rather out-of-character. What had
      happened had occurred in an established match, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This asshole should totally die.&#8221; Tang Zhenliu was fuming
      with rage, as well, and the twisted flame of a desire for slaughter was
      alight in his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Han Sen frowned.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s check on Huang Xiao first; we&#8217;ll tell you on the
      way.&#8221; Lin Feng spoke as they went towards the medical room Huang
      Xiao was taken to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu was furious, angrily grumbling as he walked, &#8220;That
      asshole is cheating!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Han Sen frowned. He had no idea what he
      meant. He watched the match just as they did, and Yu Qielan did not break
      the rules. There were no weapons employed, either. If he was cheating, Han
      Sen hadn&#8217;t been able to catch him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Han, you have never been to war. You know little about the
      shura. They have what is called &#8216;Blood Injection.&#8217; They can
      inject themselves with the blood of a higher-class shura to temporarily
      earn their strength. Me and Old Lin have seen this occur many times. Yu
      Qielan most certainly used Blood Injection,&#8221; Tang Zhenliu explained.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Feng&#8217;s face looked dire. He didn&#8217;t often get mad, but
      there he was. He coldly muttered, &#8220;It was okay of him to use Blood
      Injection, as that is how they fight. It isn&#8217;t too dissimilar to our
      hyper geno arts. But he held back on it and did not use it during the
      beginning. He let Huang Xiao fill himself with false hope. And just as he
      was willing to give his life for the fight, that was when Yu Qielan
      unleashed his power. Yu Qielan attempted to murder him. He could have used
      it during the beginning and brought the fight to a swift end, or many
      times during the middle, but he committed to using it during a critical,
      devastating stage where the demigod had no opportunity to stop such damage
      from being inflicted.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Damn it!&#8221; When Han Sen heard the explanation, his new
      understanding led to him being mad, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had noticed that Yu Qielan became strangely powerful during the
      final few moments. He thought Yu Qielan was just strengthening his own
      resolve and preparing to take the fight a little more seriously. He never
      expected this was the reality of what he had seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the four of them reached the medical bay, the doctors had Huang Xiao
      in surgery. Many of Huang Xiao&#8217;s friends nervously awaited him
      outside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Feng saw a doctor he knew and pulled him aside to ask, &#8220;Doctor
      Chan, how is Huang Xiao?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Doctor Chan had a wry smile and said, &#8220;If he was injured anywhere
      else, we could have done an organ transplant. But he received significant
      blunt-force trauma to the head, resulting in severe damage to the brain.
      He is still in critical condition, but our neurosurgeons are doing all
      that they can to stabilize him.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After a pause, Doctor Chan quietly informed Lin Feng, &#8220;The punch was
      far too hard. His skull was split, and it was unable to absorb the entire
      force delivered. This resulted in his brain sustaining severe damage. Even
      if he survives, the nerve damage—the extent of which we will have to
      determine later—will affect him for the rest of his life.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;How bad is it?&#8221; Tang Zhenliu asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Paralysis is a very serious consequence of such injuries. If the
      hit was a touch milder, he might only suffer partial mobility
      disabilities, or only be affected during certain times or under certain
      conditions. For example, every now and then he might lose control in his
      hands. But with the way things are looking right now, there is a high
      chance of the patient suffering intellectual disabilities,&#8221; Doctor
      Chan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they heard this, each of their faces went dim. This was worse than
      death for Huang Xiao. Even if his injuries extended no further, he would
      have lost the ability to fight. It would be impossible for him to
      adventure through the sanctuaries again.
