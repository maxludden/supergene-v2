	<p>“Why didn’t I think about collecting some gourds before I left the Sky Path?” Han Sen thought with regret. There
		would be far more than a single holy air in every gourd. He would have been rich if he had collected a bunch of
		them.</p>

	<p>While Han Sen was regretting his oversight, Han Yan had reached the stone stairs that led up to Sky Palace. The
		words “Sky Palace” were shining brightly, and the sensation was so overwhelming that it was rather intimidating.
		It felt suppressive.</p>

	<p>Dukes weren’t the only ones who would feel the strain of those words. Even a King class elite would feel the
		suppression if they began ascending those stairs. Most Kings wouldn’t dare to lift their heads long enough to do
		more than glance at those words.</p>

	<p>Many of Sky Palace’s nobles were eager to see how Han Yan fared on her ascent of the stone stairs of Sky Road.
		Han Yan’s performance on the Sky Path had surprised all of Sky Palace. They were eager to see how she would
		perform in her ascent of the stone stairs of Sky Road.</p>

	<p>“There is no doubt now that she is Han Sen’s biological sister. She is so strong!”</p>

	<p>“Did you forget what happened when Brother Han ascended the stairs? He had to be carried. I don’t know if his
		sister will experience the same thing or not.”</p>

	<p>“Brother Han was carried because he understood the two words of Sky Palace and what they meant. It wasn’t because
		he was weak.”</p>

	<p>“Do you think Sister Han will understand the two words of Sky Palace and their meaning as well?”</p>

	<p>“She collected the gourds like she was picking apples. She took four of them. Understanding the meaning of two
		words won’t be as difficult as taking those gourds.” “Yeah, I think so, too. The crystallizers are likely to
		become significant once again, with this Han family backing them up.”</p>

	<p>As everyone discussed this, Han Yan reached the stone stairs of Sky Road. Han Sen, Yun Suyi, and Thousand Feather
		Crane stood outside the stone stairs. If something happened to Han Yan, they could step in and save her.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried about Han Yan being crushed under the two words of Sky Palace. He was worried she would
		end up like him, understanding the meaning behind the words and allowing them into her body. If she failed, as
		her big brother, he would have to carry her up the rest of the way. It wouldn’t be appropriate for anyone else
		to do that.</p>

	<p>In regards to Han Yan’s talent, Han Sen was very confident. Han Sen thought his family had many people whose
		talent exceeded his own. He only surpassed them through his effort and determination. That was why he could do
		things others could not. It had nothing to do with talent.</p>

	<p>Of course, luck also played a part in it all.</p>

	<p>When Han Yan began to ascend the stone stairs of the Sky Road, she quickly felt the pressure of the words. She
		slowed under the sudden weight and had to lower her head.</p>

	<p>“I’m not just representing myself here. I’m representing my brother. I cannot lower my head while I walk up to
		Sky Palace.” With that thought, Han Yan’s mind exploded forcefully outward. She tried to fight back against the
		two words of Sky Palace.</p>

	<p>But those two words carried deified power. She couldn’t force them back. The more she fought, the more pressure
		was applied. Her neck bone almost broke.</p>

	<p>Her super god body opened again. A weird power covered Han Yan once more, sending her into King Release Sky mode.
		Han Sen didn’t know much about Han Yan’s super god body King Release Sky. He only knew that it was a
		Causal-element super god body. And in regards to how powerful King Release Sky was, Han Sen wouldn’t be able to
		tell unless he fought her.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had discerned that Han Yan was only able to collect the holy gourds because of her super god body, but he
		wasn’t sure exactly how she had done it.</p>

	<p>Right now, Han Yan was using her King Release Sky super god body again. Han Sen was paying keen attention, trying
		to understand precisely why it was so amazing.</p>

	<p>Sky Palace Leader saw Han Yan fighting back against the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace. He smiled and
		spoke to the woman next to him. “She is still young.”</p>

	<p>“Everyone was young at some point,” the woman said tersely. “Being reckless at such a young age isn’t a bad
		thing. Sometimes, young people need that kind of drive.”</p>

	<p>Sky Palace Leader laughed and said nothing. He could tell that the woman’s expression hadn’t changed, but anyone
		who understood her could tell from the corners of her eyes that she admired what Han Yan was doing. As they
		spoke, Han Yan was being suppressed by the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace. Then, she suddenly
		straightened out her neck and body. She stared forward and continued walking toward the door of Sky Palace.</p>

	<p>The elites of Sky Palace were all confused, wondering why the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace now seemed
		to be ineffective.</p>

	<p>“No way! The meaning of the two words of Sky Palace only affects people and creatures the first time they ascend
		the stone stairs. It loses its effect the second time, but this is Han Yan’s first time. Why isn’t it working?”
		Sixth Elder looked confused. Something was wrong. “No, it worked in the beginning, but then it suddenly stopped.
		What kind of geno art does Han Yan possess to be so amazing?”</p>

	<p>“Brother Sixth, stop blabbering these questions. It would be weird for the biological sister of a guy like Han
		Sen to be completely ordinary,” Yun Changkong gently reprimanded the Sixth Elder. His quiet smile spoke for
		itself.</p>

	<p>Yun Changkong had agreed to take Han Yan at the behest of Han Sen and Yun Suyi. He hadn’t expected that Han Yan
		would already be so impressive. He felt as if he had just won some sort of student lottery.Han Yan quietly
		walked up the stone stairs, and as she did, the others of Sky Palace thought something was amiss. They were
		quick to realize that the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace hadn’t lost its effectiveness. It was working,
		and it was now becoming stronger. As this happened, the words shone. If the Sky Palace students looked closer,
		they could see that it wasn’t real light. The brightness they saw was the waves of a mind that was too strong.
		It manifested as a physical light, shimmering with power.</p>

	<p>The higher Han Yan went, the brighter the mind powering the two words became. It was such a powerful mind. Only
		deified beings could trigger it while they walked Sky Road. But Han Yan was just a Duke, and she was already
		able to trigger the meaning of the words to such a capacity. That was surprising.</p>

	<p>Even more frightening was the fact that such a powerful mind was still proving to be ineffective against Han Yan.
	</p>

	<p>The mind was like a moonlit spring. Han Yan ascended the stone stairs dressed in all white, like a fairy bathing
		in moonlight. Her black hair floated in the shimmering moonlight behind her. Many of the young students of Sky
		Palace couldn’t take their eyes off her.</p>

	<p>“I’m in love…” a male student said. He stared at Han Yan longingly, while clutching his chest. He almost had
		stars in his eyes.</p>

	<p>“She is a true fairy.” Many of the eyes of young Sky Palace students gleamed like hungry wolves.</p>

	<p>As this happened, Han Yan slowly walked beneath the pressure of the meaning of the two words of the Sky Palace
		plaque. She had finished her ascent of the stone stairs. According to the past experience of the Sky, the power
		of the mind behind the words would now be reduced.</p>

	<p>But this time, Sky Palace’s two-word mind did not reduce. It exploded like a volcano.</p>
