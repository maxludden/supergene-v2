  “Why are you guys telling me all this?” Han Sen took a deep breath to compose his thoughts before asking.

After all, what he had been told was a hypothesis. It was just a collection of ifs, and there was no point in Han Sen being troubled by all this.

This time, Ning Yue did not speak. Second Uncle looked at Han Sen and said, “There’s one thing you shouldn’t doubt: Han Jinzhi is capable of doing all this. Although it may not be true, at least we have confirmed that it is possible. Whether you’re Han Jinzhi’s heir or not, you’re still functioning as bait. Everyone wants to get you, especially the leader of this New Community. I am just unsure why he hasn’t done anything yet. Perhaps he needs another two years to recover, and once he has, you’ll be his prime target again.”

“Second Uncle, do you know the New Community’s leader? Who is he?” Han Sen had so many questions about the New Community, all of which had no answers. He wanted them. Second Uncle seemed to know a thing or two, that much was clear.

And just as Second Uncle said, the New Community had already tried coming after him once. Han Sen had managed to avoid them. Had he not, he’d be in their hands.

“You must have heard what happened to the seventh team by now.” Second Uncle sighed.

Han Sen suddenly perked up. With excitement, he nodded and said, “I have heard a bit. When you guys first entered the sanctuary, you met a character called God. This being granted you all one wish. Only you and another woman refused the offer.”

Second Uncle nodded and said, “My knowledge of the events reflects yours. We entered that strange dimension and did indeed meet someone called God. Gu Qingcheng and I didn’t make a wish, but everybody else did. They accepted God’s Trial.”

Han Sen lifted his ears, not willing to miss a single word. He knew he was close to learning things that he had never discovered before.

Second Uncle poured some more tea and took a sip before speaking again. He said, “Han Jinzhi told me it wasn’t actually God. It was merely a creature that looked like us, and that is why he told me not to make a wish. I didn’t make a wish at the time, but I ultimately disregarded his advice. I eventually made one.”

“What? You did?” Han Sen’s eyes opened wide. He was too shocked to refer to him as Second Uncle politely now.

In the versions of the story he had heard up until now, Second Uncle did not make a wish. But now he was being told that the man had, right from the horse’s mouth.

Second Uncle sighed and said, “That being said, I wish I had listened to Han Jinzhi and not made the wish. The temptation, however, was too strong. I made it.”

Han Sen’s heart was full of conflicted emotions. He wanted to start asking questions, but he couldn’t think of where to begin. He looked at Second Uncle and waited for him to resume speaking.

If Second Uncle made a wish, then why did he appear to be doing just fine? He had not been trapped like Dawn, and he was not living with pain like Uncle Bug. He seemed in perfect health.

“Do you know what wish I made?” Second Uncle smiled, but it was a queer one.

“What was the wish?” Han Sen didn’t make guesses. He just wanted to hear the answers directly. Han Sen had spent far too much time guessing these matters, and he was getting tired of the constant theorizing.

Clearly, Second Uncle didn’t want him to guess, either. He smiled and said, “I am the greediest. So, the wish I made was to have more wishes.”

Han Sen looked at Second Uncle. The wish seemed so childish; it was something a kid would do. But at the same time, it sort of made sense.

Second Uncle took a deep breath and said, “I was wondering if Han Jinzhi was telling the truth; after all, he made a wish. If that being wasn’t God, then why would he impart advice and still make a wish of his own, anyway? That’s why I ultimately decided to make one.”

“And then? Did your wish come true?” Han Sen asked.

“It did.” Second Uncle’s face looked bitter. He went on to say, “Now I can have many wishes, but first, I must finish the missions I was given. And those wishes were not what I wanted. But if I don’t finish the missions, I will be dead.”

Now Han Sen understood what he meant. He had been tricked by God, enslaved by him to do his bidding. He was a slave and nothing more.

“What is this God thing?” Han Sen asked, gritting his teeth.

Second Uncle shook his head and said, “I don’t know what it is, but you should assume it is simply a creature residing in the Fifth Sanctuary. That might be true, but its powers exceed the boundaries of the sanctuary. This is nothing an ordinary creature can do. The New Community has some sort of a connection to this God. And the missions I am forced to do are all for the greater benefit of the New Community.”

“Could the leader of the New Community be this God?” Han Sen asked in shock.

Second Uncle shook his head, as it was not something he could answer.

“I don’t know why the New Community has not tried anything against you yet, but from what I see, their focus in finding Han Jinzhi is greater than anyone else’s. And that confuses me. Perhaps you are able to tell me why this is?” Second Uncle asked Han Sen.

“Maybe it is because they aren’t strong enough to get me,” Han Sen said.

Second Uncle gave a wry smile. “The New Community is stronger than you think. You are strong, but if they wanted you done for, you would be. They’d find a way.”

“But I can’t think of any other reasons why they haven’t.” Han Sen shrugged with his hands open.

Second Uncle went quiet for a moment, before proceeding. “There is a problem with the New Community leader’s body. From what I have come to know, it will take two years to recover. And once it has recovered, he will most likely come after you himself.”

Second Uncle didn’t give a second thought to the idea that the New Community had not struck yet was because it currently wasn’t strong enough.

When Tina brought the Geno Armor with her to fight, it was stolen by Han Sen. And Han Sen found himself able to use it. This put the New Community at a big disadvantage.

They could now only wait for their leader to recover and deal personally with Han Sen.

“If you are willing, I am hoping we can co-operate when the times comes to deal with the New Community.” Second Uncle looked directly at Han Sen.

“Second Uncle, is this appropriate?” Han Sen did not really trust Second Uncle, especially as he was apparently under the control of the enigmatic God. If he became an open enemy of the New Community, harm could be brought upon him.

“I have lived long enough. If I can do something to save the Ning family before I go, I will be satisfied,” Second Uncle said quietly.

“Okay, then. And by the way, can you tell me where the New Community is hiding out?” Han Sen asked.
