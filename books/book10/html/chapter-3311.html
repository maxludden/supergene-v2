	<p>Han Sen clutched his Inch Grey Sword and swung it at the jade sword. He broke the jade sword. He did not stop. He
		started to attack the black jade statue.</p>

	<p>The black jade statue’s eyes had an evil light flicker. The jade sword on its waist came out from the scabbard.
		One sword sound shocked the sky and the ground. It was like a jade pillar-like sword light was breaking the sky.
		It went toward Han Sen’s Inch Grey Sword.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>Under the sheer, unrelenting force of Han Sen’s sword, the jade sword and black jade statue were sliced in half.
		It suddenly made many Break World creatures fall back. The whole of the five cities and 12 buildings froze.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen grabbed the black jade crystal, an announcement played in his head. “Hunted Break World beast: Black
		king. Got black king beast soul. Found Break World gene.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s mind did not turn to focus on the Break World gene. He used all of the power in his sword to kill the
		black king. He used Dongxuan Aura and felt more strong presences were emerging from White Jade Jing like the
		black king. And worse than that, many of them were far more frightening. Han Sen did not dare underestimate any
		potential foes.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was avoiding them, and the scary Break World creatures of the White Jade Jing were avoiding him too.
		After Han Sen managed to kill the black king in a single strike, the Break World beasts outside feared him. No
		more Break World beasts dared to emerge from White Jade Jing.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s power alone stopped White Jade Jing and its scary creatures. It enabled the Sky Palace students to
		retreat in safety.</p>

	<p>A Sky Palace elder was soaked in blood. He had a broken arm. Before he left, he put his arm against his chest and
		performed the gesture of a bow to Han Sen.</p>

	<p>No one said a word. Many of the Sky Palace elites merely walked away quietly. They were not afraid to die while
		fighting, but the Sky Palace students could not die there. They had to protect the students and ensure they were
		able to leave safely and live.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not dare leave. He stood in front of the 12 buildings of the five cities. Countless numbers of scary
		creatures were being produced, but they would not step out of White Jade Jing.</p>

	<p>Still, Break World beasts were all around. The Break World beasts from White Jade Jing had brought Sky Palace a
		lot of trouble.</p>

	<p>“Ancient Devil is right. With my power alone, no matter how many Break World beasts I kill, I cannot protect all
		my family and friends. I cannot save the world.” Han Sen could not think of a better way to deal with all this.
		If he left, the scary monsters of White Jade Jing would keep coming. More and more people would be killed.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>Han Sen suddenly saw a sky full of holy light explode. A giant gourd vine broke space. The holy gourds on it were
		glowing. They killed the Break World beasts around.</p>

	<p>Han Sen watched Sky Palace Leader stand atop the vine. It looked as if he had managed to tame it. Perhaps the
		holy vine had restored its original will, so it was no longer affected by the life soul now.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was happy. The holy vine was indeed special. It was nothing compared to the Break World beasts. It had
		the protection of the Sky Palace Leader. The Sky Palace students would live on this day.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, I am taking them to go back. Can you hold the line?” Sky Palace Leader’s voice sounded. He was able to
		tell Han Sen was not doing so well.</p>

	<p>“I am here,” Han Sen coldly said. “You have my sword. None of them will make it through. You guys just keep
		going.”</p>

	<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! Well said. Let’s go.” Sky Palace Leader stroked the holy vine. The countless gourds on the holy vine
		glowed with holy light. It protected Sky Palace’s ships and battleships as they flew out and departed the realm.
	</p>

	<p>White Jade Jing’s many beasts roared to the sky. They were all jumping, wanting to get out of there.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was holding his sword. He was standing firm outside White Jade Jing all alone. No Break World beasts were
		bold enough to take a step forward. They just kept roaring where they were.</p>

	<p>A woman with white clothes stained with blood was next to Sky Palace Leader. She looked at Han Sen, who looked
		strange next to White Jade Jing, and said, “I can’t believe there would come a day the Sky only survived because
		of his actions.”</p>

	<p>“That is what is so amazing about life,” Sky Palace Leader said. “You never expect what happens next.”</p>

	<p>“From what I usually see, that is not something explicitly nice.” The woman looked at the many dead Sky Palace
		students. After the fight, Sky Palace was pretty much destroyed. Even so, its people had mostly survived.</p>

	<p>“The world has changed. We will have to change with it. If we do not want to die in silence, then we must
		explode. The Sky never shy away from the concept of a challenge. I am sure the Sky Palace students will emerge
		stronger from enduring future hardships. They will be able to rule the world again.” Sky Palace Leader changed
		his tone. “But right now, we need to focus on staying alive.”</p>

	<p>The large and small ships were protected by the holy vine as they started to fly. All of the Sky quietly looked
		toward White Jade Jing.</p>

	<p>There were the mysterious 12 buildings and five cities. There were many Break World beasts there, and a man was
		standing in front of White Jade Jing. There was also the man’s sword.</p>

	<p>“Sister, he is back.” Yun Suyi was tugging Yun Sushang’s sleeves. When they peered at Han Sen’s back, the two
		blushed.</p>

	<p>Yun Sushang sighed. It was great Han Sen had managed to save Sky Palace, but that meant Yun Suyi would not soon
		forget Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Thousand Feather Crane clenched his fists and said, “We must work harder. One day, we can reclaim Sky Palace and
		White Jade Jing through the strength of our own power.”</p>

	<p>“Yes. One day, we will take back Sky Palace,” the Sky students all solemnly vowed. Even so, they all felt sad.
	</p>

	<p>That was the day they all lost their homes.</p>

	<p>Things like this were happening everywhere in the universe. Only one place remained quiet like dead water.</p>

	<p>In a dark red planet, Blood Legion and its many members and Human King were peering at the black hole in the sky.
	</p>

	<p>“The main and reverse worlds have developed a crack. It appears Qin Xiu is making his move. This is a stellar
		chance for us.” Human King flickered with a weird light.</p>

	<p>“Mister Leader, do we do it now?” a member asked.</p>

	<p>“Of course, we do it now. The bridging tunnel has been opened. This is the age of chaos. Our best chance of doing
		it is now.” Human King stood up. He led the Blood Legion members to the black hole.</p>

	<p>In the realm of the Demon, one person was in the black hole. It was the Demon known as Demon Alpha. The black
		hole Demon Alpha was in had already been there before the other black holes had appeared.</p>

	<p>The Demon Alpha did not have a reaction when the black hole showed up. Her face did not have a single emotion.
		She silently looked at the life soul coming out from the black hole.</p>

	<p>One life soul came to the planet of the Demons. Demon Alpha waved her hand as if to carry fate. She killed the
		life soul.</p>

	<p>“Seeing the spirits before me, is it one of the Asura?” Demon Alpha coldly looked at the life soul that was gone.
		She looked disdainful.</p>
