    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the person and became surprised. The gorgeous figure of
      Zero appeared in the teleport device.
    </p>

    <p>
      No… It is impossible that she&#8217;s an evolver. How can she end up here?
      Even if she was an evolver, it is highly unlikely for her to end up at the
      same spot as me. The chance is so slim and there must be something wrong…
      Han Sen was lost, gazing at Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen believed there were only two possibilities. One was that Zero was
      abnormal; the other was that his nine-life cat pendant was problematic.
      Otherwise, how could Zero end up here?
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero still acted the same way, standing next to Han Sen like a shadow, her
      eyes blinking from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, you win.&#8221; Han Sen said with a wry smile, knowing that
      his beautiful wish to get rid of Zero was wasted.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, Han Sen did not really dislike Zero after spending some time with
      her. She was someone hard to hate. With a sweet face, she rarely spoke or
      did anything annoying despite being a tag-along. Han Sen even felt
      accustomed to her existence. It was just her weird background that made
      Han Sen feel reluctant to accept her.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, when he thought about it, Zero had never harmed him. In addition,
      Zero would probably be a huge help to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      With her ability, she could probably even fight sacred-blood creatures in
      Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Such a strong and obedient fighter was
      definitely a great assistance to Han Sen who had just entered Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a fitness around sixty or seventy, so it would be easy for me to
      break 100 if I gain some geno points. At that time, I would be able to
      match Zero&#8217;s ability, and then it would no longer be an issue for me
      to keep her around. Han Sen thought about it, decided to let it go, and
      crawled out of the hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hole led to a path that was quite twisted. Han Sen and Zero walked for
      a long while before they saw the light. The moment he saw what was
      outside, Han Sen was dazed.
    </p>

    <p>
      All he could see was icebergs and peaks covered in snow. It was also
      snowing heavily. The world was all white.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the top of the largest mountain, he could see a white fairytale-like
      castle vaguely through the flying snowflakes. Because the snow was too
      heavy, he could barely see the details of the architecture. However, he
      could still feel how dedicated and beautiful it was in the silver storm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face suddenly became grim. Although he could not see any
      details, it was not a building made by man. Otherwise, there would be some
      modern materials and practical designs, which the castle did not have.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Spirit shelter!&#8221; Han Sen suddenly had an idea, which was not
      good news to him. Since Han Sen had not spotted a human building but saw a
      spirit shelter, it was unlikely for him to meet any fellow man. Judging
      from the looks of the castle, it was probably owned by advanced spirits.
      If the spirits were too strong and had a large troop of creatures, Han Sen
      believed he would suffer in his early development.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why are you standing there?&#8221; A hasty but low voice sounded
      from Han Sen&#8217;s back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen turned to look and saw a man with his full body covered in Arctic
      suit waving at them from the depths of the hole. Han Sen suddenly felt a
      bit pleased to finally see a human.
    </p>

    <p>
      He took Zero to walk over to the guy. When he was ready to speak, the guy
      suddenly pulled them inside the ice channel. Before Han Sen even said
      anything, the guy looked them up and down and said, &#8220;you must be new
      here.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We just teleported over today,&#8221; Han Sen answered and check
      the guy out.
    </p>

    <p>
      The guy was over twenty the should be less than thirty. He looked quite
      handsome, but there was a deep exhaustion and helplessness on his face.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then you have terrible luck. It would be very hard for you in the
      future,&#8221; the guy smiled wryly and said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.
      Let&#8217;s talk inside so that we don&#8217;t alarm the ice-armored
      beasts. They have sensitive ears and could hear a voice a thousand feet
      away in snowstorm.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My name is Xu You, and I came here more than a year ago, so I have
      more experience than you. Here&#8217;s a piece of advice: do not wander
      around.&#8221; The guy was quite easy-going, talking to Han Sen and Zero
      as he walked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, what is this place? Is there a human shelter?&#8221; Han
      Sen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xu You curled his lips and said, &#8220;A human shelter can never be built
      under such circumstances. Even one could be built, it would be useless
      because of the spirit shelter in the mountains. It is a shelter of an
      aristocrat spirit. In addition to aristocrat spirit, there were a dozen
      mutant creatures and hundreds of primitive ice-armored beasts. Let me put
      it this way, all the humans here combined would not be an adequate meal
      for those guys.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is there no evolver with fitness index above 100?&#8221; Han Sen
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like creatures, there were four levels of spirits: squire, night,
      aristocrats, and royalty, which could be king or queen. The four levels
      corresponded to ordinary, primitive, mutant, and sacred-blood creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      An aristocrat spirit was about as strong as a mutant creature. However,
      because spirits had higher intelligence and the ability to control
      creatures, they were greater than mutant creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How could we ever reach 100 in such a shithole? Only seven or eight
      guys would be assigned here randomly all year-round. Because we are so
      close to the spirit shelter, we have to travel far to hunt any creatures
      so that we don&#8217;t rattle those guys in the spirit shelter. In
      addition, the creatures nearby were extremely lacking, so we might not
      even be able to find a creature that falls behind in days. It is difficult
      to kill even an ordinary creature, so how could we have enough geno points
      to strengthen our fitness?&#8221; Xu You whined.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Apparently, even the strongest evolver among us only had a fitness
      level of a little more than sixty. The good thing is that we stick
      together. Because we help each other, we are able to hunt some creatures.
      However, it is not likely that we can make any significant achievements.
      This damn place is hell. Whoever sent here are just down in luck.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you thought about leaving here?&#8221; Han Sen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How do you propose to leave? This place faces the ocean in three
      directions, only the direction of the spirit shelter leads to land.
      Besides, we don&#8217;t even know where we are. Even if we bypass the
      spirit shelter, it would be hard for us to locate a human shelter. We
      would be more than likely to die on the way.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Xu You paused and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself and
      don&#8217;t rush anything. Wait here for a couple of days. When more
      people arrived, we would be able to go farther to hunt. People here are
      nice, so as long as you do your part, the meat would be shared to you. So
      stay and gain some geno points, Know this place better, and then consider
      hunting on your own.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you so much for the instructions, friend,&#8221; Han Sen
      thanked Xu You for being so straightforward.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Call me Xu You,&#8221; Xu You smiled and said.</p>

    <p>
      After going back to the ice cave, Han Sen chatted some more with Xu You
      and got the basic idea about the place. Then he teleported back to the
      Alliance together with Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen decided to get certified as a sacred-blood aristocrat. In addition
      to all the benefits he could get, he would be able to let his sister
      continue her study at the posh school with confidence.
