  Han Sen looked dim. Ever since his body evolved, this was the first he had witnessed something like this. He could not tell what was authentic when it came to Crape Myrtle, whose entire body was veiled by fog.

Han Sen could even see through Demon Alpha, who had the power of Bao’er’s father, but he was unable to do what he did against her to Crape Myrtle.

“These illusion skills are very powerful, but for me, that can only be a good thing. It may trick my body, but I can attack.” After being tricked by the illusion skills seven times, Han Sen decided now would be the time to strike

When Crape Myrtle made the star shine, Han Sen’s body power exploded. He teleported in front of Crape Myrtle and threw a punch toward Crape Myrte’s chest.

Han Sen’s punch had a lot of power amassed in it. It traveled with the power of the Dongxuan Sutra. The powerful Dongxuan power made the universal cogwheels all around stop spinning..

Han Sen proved it on Demon Alpha’s body. Even the powerful cause God Spirit power was able to be locked by the Dongxuan Sutra’s power.

Beneath the power of the Dongxuan Sutra, it did not matter if there were wind, fire, lightning, thunder, time, or space powers coming against him. It could all be forced to stop spinning. That also included Crape Myrtle’s power.

Just as Han Sen’s fist was going to collide with Crape Myrtle’s form, Crape Myrtle’s lips developed a weird smile. The body—which once stopped—had started to move. It was extremely fast. The moment it went past Han Sen’s fist, his fingers went toward Han Sen’s waist.

Han Sen’s reaction speed was very fast but not enough to dodge those fingers. Crape Myrtle came into contact with Han Sen’s waist.

The fingering power was not like starlight or anything at all. Han Sen felt as if a needle was thrust right into his waist. He felt a numbness claim his entire body.

Crape Myrtle’s 10 fingers were like swords. They covered Han Sen’s body. When Han Sen felt sore, he planned to attack like mad. He hoped to defeat Han Sen.

Han Sen was shocked. Now, the only person who had been able to hurt his body thus far was this new nemesis.

Crape Myrtle’s power was so strong, but it was not enough to make him lose control of his body. He held the sore feelings in and moved his body. He used all his fingers like swords and went after Crape Myrtle’s fingers.

Crape Myrtle was surprised by the fact that Han Sen was able to fight back. His body was like the wind, not wanting to directly engage with Han Sen.

Han Sen was not going to permit Crape Myrtle the opportunity to fall back and retreat. When he wanted to give chase, he realized his power was all gone and could no longer combat Crape Myrtle.

Han Sen frowned and thought, “What is going on? Why does my body believe this man is harmless to me?”

Crape Myrtle was not too far away, but he looked back at Han Sen and laughed while saying, “I see. Your body requires the power of an enemy’s power before being activated so that you can use the same amount of power to repel them. If I don’t use power, then your body is practically useless.”

After that sentence was spoken, the two universes were put into shock.

“No way! Han Sen is an Annihilation-class God Spirit. What Crape Myrtle just said does not seem possible.”

“Does he need an opponent’s power to activate his own body’s power? What kind of element is that?”

“Really?”

Everyone was talking about it. Han Sen calmly looked at Crape Myrtle. He was surprised that Crape Myrtle was able to so easily see through his body’s condition, but he had not detected any powers analyzing him in such a way.

Han Sen never thought the condition of his body could be hidden from everyone. Even if Crape Myrtle did not see it, when he fought Qin Xiu, he was convinced Qin Xiu would be able to learn that about him anyway.

“Mister Dollar, am I not correct?” Crape Myrtle asked with a smile.

“You are right.” Han Sen did not deny this. He just nodded.

“What? Really? Is it true? If Han Sen’s opponent does not use any power, he will be unable to fight. A person like that can reach the top four is a bit of a joke, don’t you think?”

“I told you so. Han Sen’s success only comes from the people he knows. Otherwise, with his power, how was he ever able to reach the top four? That Wang Yuhang was much stronger than him. It is a shame Wang Yuhang was such a genius and decided to quit the top 16 for Han Sen.”

“That is impossible. Mister Dollar is so powerful. There is no way things are like this. Something must have gone wrong.”

In the universe, everyone was shocked. This news was far too shocking.

“Oh, no! San Mu’s power has been seen through.” In Space Garden, Tang Zhenliu was worried.

Ji Yanran was looking nervous as well. Han Sen’s body condition was better off being hidden. Now that his flaws had been exposed, he had lost the chance of winning.

“In that case, it looks like you are not going to be winning today,” Crape Myrtle quietly said.

“No. I am going to win,” Han Sen said with a shake of his head.

“Mister Dollar is so confident. Please explain to me how it is you think you will turn out to be the victor.” Crape Myrtle was not mocking him. He was seriously asking.

“It is like you said, my body needs your power to be activated,” Han Sen said. “If you don’t use power, then I cannot use my power. But if you don’t use power, you are not going to win either. If you use power in a bid to destroy me, I assure you I will be the victor.”

“That might not be true entirely.” Crape Myrtle was looking very self-assured.

“Is that so, huh? I am very keen to see how you plan on beating me.” Han Sen looked at Crape Myrtle. He already knew what his foe was planning on doing.

“Mister Dollar, did you forget about my starlight shadows?” Crape Myrtle asked. “Allow me to show you once more. They are not simply shadows.” His body conjured up a god light.

A sky full of stars glowed with starlight. A lot of lights came raining down, crossing each other like chess pieces as they went for Han Sen’s body.

This time, the starlight was different. The starlight did not activate Han Sen’s power. His body thought the starlight was harmless.

Han Sen’s heart jumped. He felt a chill in his spine.

In the next second, the starlight struck him. Han Sen did not have any power activated. He was unable to evade the falling starlight.

“Argh!” Han Sen screamed.

The starlight was like a knife light sword blade. It went around Han Sen. He was unable to control his body, so he flew away.

Han Sen felt his body burn wherever the starlight touched him. It was like he was being lashed with a cruel whip.

Ten million lights fell. It was like 10 million lashes delivered by a heinous whip. The pain was so agonizing that Han Sen thought he was going to break his teeth.

Although Han Sen was getting defeated, his power had yet to activate. His body did not think it was in any form of danger.

Han Sen was able to confirm his guess. Crape Myrtle’s power was able to trick his body.
