<p>“Breaking the world… Underworld Silhouette…” Rocky Dee coldly
shouted. The black flames on his body turned white. The flames were
strong. There were like ice that could not be broken.</p>
<p>The black paper man was burned by the white fire, which turned
it white. It was wrapped up by the white fire.</p>
<p>The white fire was burning on Han Sen’s body too. The scary fire
felt like it was ravaging his soul. The god temple and the God of
Wealth’s power were insufficient. They could not keep the white
fire at bay. The light of the god temple started to go dim.
“Mister.” Decapitation Queen’s body had a purple fire burning with
god light. The guillotine and doll shone with a lot of god light.
It helped the god temple and Han Sen fight the scary white power.
They fought it together. It made the invasive white fires slow
their encroachment.</p>
<p>Even so, the white fires were still slowly consuming Han Sen’s
soul. The white fire did not physically damage the body. To God
Spirits, it still dealt an incredible amount of damage.</p>
<p>“This is the break world power.” Han Sen suddenly thought it was
familiar.</p>
<p>It was the same feeling when Night God No Moon used break world
power, but both of their elements were different. This layer of
power could not be misidentified.</p>
<p>Han Sen still felt that this power was weaker than Night God No
Moon break world power. It was not as scary as he thought it might
end up being Without a shadow of a doubt, Han Sen broke the
suppression of the world’s rules and entered Super God Spirit mode.
Only Super God Spirit mode could fight the break world power. The
burning white fire came out of Han Sen’s eyes. It spread all over
his body. It turned his body into a white shadow. His body looked
as if it was no longer solid.</p>
<p>The power of Super God Spirit mode was finally able to put an
end to the fires that corroded his spirit. Han Sen’s eyes flashed.
The entire world’s substance chains were in his eyes. His hands
were going toward those substance chains. It broke the white fire’s
substance chains.</p>
<p>The white flame on him was suddenly extinguished. Stillness and
silence returned. With the absence of the white flame, there were
no scorch marks left behind. It was like he had never been on fire.
In the living room of an old house, Rocky Dee’s white paper man was
suddenly turned to dust. Rocky Dee coughed up some blood.</p>
<p>“Interesting. He was able to break my Underworld Silhouette. It
is no wonder he was able to kill Decapitation Queen.” Rocky Dee’s
eyes flashed with surprise. He put out his red tongue and wiped
away the blood. A flare of excitement started to cross his face.
“That is good. This beginning is quite interesting. Han Sen, you
have what it takes to be my prey.”</p>
<p>Super God Spirit mode provided invincibility. Han Sen was
finally able to extinguish the white flame that plagued his body,
but it didn’t bring him any joy.</p>
<p>God Chaos Party was scarier than he had imagined. He was not
allowed to use the Super God Spirit mode to sort out his problems
all the time.</p>
<p>“I must learn the break world power quickly,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>The god altar moved. A man stood atop the god altar. It was God,
who Han Sen was very familiar with. He was the superior being that
controlled the geno hall. “You broke the rules again.” God looked
at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I had to. People from the God Chaos Party tried to kill me. I
could not just stand by and do nothing.” Han Sen shrugged.</p>
<p>God blinked. It looked like he was smiling, but he wasn’t
smiling. “I am OK with it, but two worlds are suffering damage
because of you. When the worlds are destroyed, don’t say I did not
warn you.”</p>
<p>“Is it really that bad?” Han Sen did not believe his breaking
the rules could cause so much damage. Qin Xiu must have done it a
lot in the past. “You have been in this universe for quite a while
of time now, haven’t you?” God asked. “Therefore, being the curious
being that you are, you must know quite a bit about this world and
how it operates by now. Am I correct? If so, have you heard about
how this universe came to have so many god pulses and gene eggs in
the first place?” “Ah, regarding that, I heard the reason that
there are so many god pulses and gene eggs is that the geno
universe had too many God Spirits die,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“That is one of the reasons. The opposite of a creature being
born is dying. God pulses and land pulses are not.” God paused and
asked, “How about that? After your fight with Qin Xiu, the two
universes underwent big changes. What became clear to us was that
creatures grow quickly. Things that were not supposed to be here
have shown up far too early.”</p>
<p>“Is this connected to me breaking the rules of the universe?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“To be accurate, these mysterious and weird scenes that happen
are because the universe itself is in a fixing and balancing mode.
The powers that should not be here have been activated. It’s like
humans using their potential. If this keeps going, and the universe
becomes exhausted, the universe cannot go back to running how it
has been. That means the machine of the universe will stop
operating. When that happens, there will be darkness and
destruction.”</p>
<p>“That sounds very complicated, but I don’t care,” Han Sen said.
“I can stop breaking the rules of the world, but you need to make
sure I don’t die in here.”</p>
<p>Before God could speak, Han Sen smiled and said, “God Chaos
Party’s minister has a frightening amount of power. Even with
Moment God, he cannot be beaten. How did you guys defeat the God
Chaos Party in the past?”</p>
<p>God knew what Han Sen was getting at, but he still said, “It is
very simple. What makes you think God Spirits need to give
Blood-Pulses to humans?”</p>
<p>“Are you saying humans give power to the God Spirits for the God
Spirits to be stronger and perhaps even use break world powers?”
Han Sen did not quite believe it.</p>
<p>“Break world powers are too destructive and tolling on the
universe. God Spirits cannot use the power. As protectors of the
universe, God Spirits can use this world’s power, whether from
humans or gene races, to aid them. It’s like you having
Decapitation Queen. When she became your sub-god, your god powers
actually became stronger. She can also use her powers to assist you
in combat. In that capacity, humans are similar. The more you have
on your side, the more they achieve. The power they can give you
can also be more.” “What level must I reach to challenge the
members of God Chaos Party.” That was what Han Sen cared about.</p>
<p>“That is very simple. Your God of Wealth is not a fighting God
Spirit, so it is a bit weak on that front. You could destroy the
eight Annihilation God Spirits and make them your sub-gods, but it
would be best if they were eight wild Annihilation God Spirits
instead. Then, fighting Rocky Dee would be easy.” God laughed.</p>
<p>Han Sen rolled his eyes. “Wow, you sure make it sound easy as
pie. How am I supposed to find wild Annihilation God Spirits with
ease?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t easy. If it was, the God Chaos Party would not have
just almost broken the geno hall. He made the last leader reopen
the universe to destroy the God Chaos Party.” God sighed.</p>
