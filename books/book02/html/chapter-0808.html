    <p>
      &#8220;Big Brother, I still haven&#8217;t eaten any yet. You want your
      charred brethren back?&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s hands trembled, as he
      handed over a carved slice of roast goose to the newly-descended one.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Quack!&#8221; The white goose angrily cried and tried to attack
      Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, I request your assistance once more!&#8221; Wang Yuhang
      called and ran over to Han Sen&#8217;s side.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took off into the skies, not wishing to kill their new foe.
      Killing it could potentially draw the attention of more creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Wang Yuhang in the vicinity, there was a high likelihood of this very
      thing happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, don&#8217;t run! Save me!&#8221; Wang Yuhang shouted as he
      ran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, I cannot save you this time. Run back to whence you
      came!&#8221; Han Sen yelled down to him, from the safety of the skies.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whence I came? Whence I came? I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea
      where I am or how I might return to whence I came,&#8221; Wang Yuhang said
      in flustered response.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you just kidnapped? Run to where those people brought
      you. Do that and find a way to leave the goose&#8217;s ire on them.&#8221;
      Han Sen wanted to see who the people that kidnapped Wang Yuhang were.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Could such a tactic work?&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked with
      desperation.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Just go. I am still here.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, if I am in absolute danger, I still beseech that you save
      me!&#8221; Wang Yuhang yelled out, as he started to run.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course.&#8221; Han Sen watched Wang Yuhang run a great distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang led the goose without a single problem, and his attraction and
      kiting skills were exemplary—as they always had been. He led the goose by
      its nose, keeping it as close as he could, all without sustaining any
      damage. He ran and ran, right across the mountains.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had scaled numerous mountains, and after passing over many, Han Sen
      espied a camp sitting at the bottom of one particular valley. There were
      many tents there, and Han Sen suspected that the camp held at least two
      hundred people.
    </p>

    <p>
      But because there were no flags or cloths bearing an emblem, symbol, or
      logo pertaining to any particular organization, Han Sen was unable to
      discern who they were. When Wang Yuhang reached the camp, it caused a
      great scene as the campers scrambled from out of their shelter in sudden
      distress.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white goose was terrifyingly powerful, and the creature did not spare
      the lives of those who dwelled in the camp. Scores of the people there
      were killed, and many more of them were injured.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was one man ordering his fellows to surround the goose, and even
      after observing that, he was unable to tell who they were. But one thing
      was for sure; they were well-trained. And even amidst the chaos, the
      subordinates were each able to adhere to the commands of their superiors
      and focus. Not a single person ran off, despite the goose&#8217;s
      slaughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are these people? They are pretty good. But if they cannot deal
      with a single super creature, for what reason have they come here?&#8221;
      As Han Sen pondered this puzzling conundrum, he saw something strange
      happen to the people he observed down below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the leader&#8217;s control, some people brought out a vial
      containing some concoction. Then, they injected themselves with the serum.
      Soon after, their muscles expanded and their eyes turned red and a red
      horn burst forth from their foreheads.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Blood-horn shura?&#8221; Han Sen thought, with much surprise. He
      never did figure out where the blood-horn shura that assaulted him came
      from. And although he most suspected Angel Gene, he hadn&#8217;t found any
      proof to confirm it was them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of everything that might have occurred on his journey here, encountering
      blood-horn shura was one of the most unlikely. And now, viewing them with
      greater clarity, they didn&#8217;t look like shura at all. They were
      simply humans that had forced mutations upon themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite the folly of their actions, they did look far stronger following
      their injections and subsequent transformation into what Han Sen had
      dubbed a blood-horn shura. For a while, they were able to maintain their
      position but still, they were unable to slay the goose that had descended
      upon them. That being said, the goose was unable to totally destroy the
      camp now, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elites amongst them that had opened their gene locks did not use the
      medicine, and they instead took off after Wang Yuhang in the desire of
      capturing him once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched what was going on for a while, and it seemed as if no
      damage was being dealt to the wild goose. They seemed to be running out of
      patience, and so one of the elites injected themselves with the
      concoction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within seconds, the man&#8217;s muscles expanded by a vast amount. The
      person&#8217;s head grew a horn and his lifeforce made a great leap in
      power.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The man&#8217;s body burst into flames. He threw his fist forward towards
      the white goose and incinerated a portion of the white goose&#8217;s
      plumage.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s face was one of utter shock. The
      man had dealt elemental damage through the manner of a projectile. Only
      celestial beings were supposedly capable of doing such a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the man had unlocked his gene lock, he was far away from
      achieving such a level. Therefore, how was he able to do what he had just
      done?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What in the world is that medicine?&#8221; Han Sen wondered, with
      distraught surprise. The white goose wasn&#8217;t heavily injured, but
      after the fire-power-imbued man joined the fight with all the other
      blood-horn shura, it was quickly put at a disadvantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white goose, seeing its sudden inability to win the battle, cried out
      and flew away. The people were unable to catch up with it, and so they
      could do little but watch it go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Han Sen could comprehend the situation, he realized he had done
      naught but watch the events unfold with his jaw wide open. Although the
      people weren&#8217;t too difficult to kill, the entire fact that they had
      willingly transformed themselves into blood-horn shura frightened Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But before he did anything, like killing them, Han Sen knew he&#8217;d
      have to collect intel and find out more about them first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang, in the meantime, had been beaten up by the elites and thrown
      back into a cage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, despite his egregious luck, Wang Yuhang was not a dumb person.
      Although he was back at square one, he didn&#8217;t call out for Han
      Sen&#8217;s aid, and it seemed his kidnappers were still unaware of the
      presence of other people on the Empty Island.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued to watch them from afar, committed to gathering as much
      information about them as he could. They beat up Wang Yuhang, but not by a
      large amount. It was clear to him that they wanted him for a particular
      purpose. Despite his attraction of the super creature and the fatalities
      that ensued, they only locked him up instead of killing him.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, however, Han Sen noticed something interesting. The people
      who used the medicine started to look like ordinary humans after about an
      hour.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they returned to looking like regular humans again, they looked weak.
      They didn&#8217;t seem to be doing too well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It would appear that drug has negative side effects for its users.
      That aside, the transformation itself does not seem to last very
      long,&#8221; Han Sen talked to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The serum seemed to last much longer on the man who had unlocked his gene
      lock, however. For him to look like an average human again, it took two
      hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he too now looked weaker than usual. He looked pale, as if he were
      drained of energy. He went inside a tent to rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to observe them. Their lifeforces had
      become much weaker, and their fitness had dropped below one hundred.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Manager Qu, Wang Yuhang&#8217;s problems extend beyond mere bad
      luck. In his short time with us, he has caused us much trouble. We have
      sustained many losses, and I am afraid our army will be wasted before that
      thing comes out.&#8221; Two people were engaged in discussion, inside the
      leader&#8217;s tent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen bent his ear their way, thinking he might pick up a thing or two
      of interest.
