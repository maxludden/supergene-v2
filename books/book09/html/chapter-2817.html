<p>Of course, after Second Uncle said that, Evil Lotus flashed by
their heads and landed on a mechanical ruin that was not far
away.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic was chasing Evil Lotus God. When it saw Second
Uncle and the others, it spat out some scary and pink beams of
light.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic looked extremely weird. Its body was
semi-transparent and pink. It did not look like crystal. It looked
more like semi-transparent metal.</p>
<p>Its pink upper body was like a giant pink piranha, and its lower
body was wriggling with tentacles like an octopus. It looked very
strange.</p>
<p>Seeing the piranha spew out pink beams of light from its flower,
Second Uncle activated his time power. It made the pink beam of
light slower. Now, everyone had a chance to evade the attack.</p>
<p>Seeing the pink beam of light land on the ground, it cut a deep
trench through the hard soil. It was a clean, laser-like cut.</p>
<p>Everybody was shocked. They knew how hard the soil there was,
yet the pink light beam had effortlessly cut a 9- to 12-foot-deep
trench right through it. Such power was certainly on par with
Second Uncle, who was a butterfly.</p>
<p>Second Uncle opened his time area. He made the time around the
xenogeneic slow down. He shouted at Meng Lie and the others, “We
need to hurry over there!”</p>
<p>The xenogeneic’s speed was made a bit slower. Everyone wanted to
get there, but they saw the xenogeneic’s nine semi-transparent
metal tentacles waving. There was a circular thing similar to a
sucker on each tentacle. They were lined up across the
tentacles.</p>
<p>In the next moment, they saw the suckers on the tentacles
generate pink beams of light. Suddenly, lots of pink beams of light
were fired out. It was like an entire net of lasers was going to
come down and throttle Han Sen and the others.</p>
<p>In the wide radius of those pink beams, even if they were slowed
down, they could not be avoided.</p>
<p>“Follow me and break the beams of light!” Second Uncle shouted.
The substance chains on his body gathered on a deified treasure
longsword. It was wielded to go across the beams of light.</p>
<p>Meng Lie, Bao Qin, Bao Ying, Londo, and the others all used
their powers to fight alongside Second Uncle to break the net
composed of beams of light.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There was a scary explosion of power. The net of light beams was
broken, but Second Uncle looked as if he had been hit in the
process. The ground near his feet cracked.</p>
<p>Meng Lie and the others were all coughing up blood. Their bodies
sunk into the sand.</p>
<p>The net formed from beams of light had been cracked.
Unfortunately, they did not have the spare power necessary to run
forward. Before they could crawl out of the soil, the xenogeneic
was waving its tentacles. Many pink beams of light were coming at
them again.</p>
<p>Second Uncle shouted, which shocked the sky. A sword broke
through the sky. It was going for the xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Out of all of them, only Second Uncle could deal with that
xenogeneic. It was a shame that Second Uncle was only good with
time power and not destructive power.</p>
<p>Although he was able to use his time powers to control the
xenogeneic and enable the xenogeneic to not attack him, when his
longsword struck the xenogeneic’s body, it only made a few light
marks. It was unable to damage it properly.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that if Second Uncle continued to fight and used
all of his power, he could not use his time powers to keep on
suppressing the xenogeneic. Once that happened, they were to surely
lose.</p>
<p>“You are all lowlife creatures. How dare you try and play tricks
in front of me the God! You must have a death wish. You guys were
supposed to work for me, a God. I would have let you live, but if
you guys want to die, it is not on me.” Evil Lotus God looked at
Second Uncle with disdain as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Fourth Brother, you guys run!” Second Uncle shouted. “Split up
while you do so to see how many of us can escape!”</p>
<p>“Second Brother, let me help you!” Meng Lie was born a very
grumpy person. He knew he had only become larva class, and his
nine-headed, evil snake weapon had been broken. Even though he
could not deal with the xenogeneic, he was not going to just leave.
His king body exploded. He was going to fight hard.</p>
<p>“Old Four, we cannot die here together! Someone needs to go back
and report to the king! Whoever goes against the Extreme King like
this cannot go unanswered! We will have to avenge today’s events!”
Second Uncle was fighting the xenogeneic while he was shouting.</p>
<p>“It should be you leaving, Second Brother. You have the highest
chance of surviving and making it back.” Meng Lie said that as he
was already rushing out. He was using his xenogeneic spear. It was
like an evil dragon going toward the enemy xenogeneic. “Second
Brother, I’ve got this. You go. Go back and tell the king. You must
avenge my death.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got this? What have you got this with?” Second Uncle
went next to Meng Lie. The time area landed on him at the same
time. It made the xenogeneic coming for Meng Lie slow down.</p>
<p>Second Uncle grabbed Meng Lie and threw him to Bao Ying. He
said, “You guys take Old Four with you. Remember, before you go
back to the Extreme King, you must carry the pottery powder.”</p>
<p>“Second Brother…” Meng Lie was struggling and trying to move. He
discovered that his body was locked. He shouted, “Second Brother,
if you don’t come with us, how do the few of us leave the big
barren systems? We will die if we stay, and we will die if we
leave! Why don’t we fight them together?”</p>
<p>Second Uncle wished to say something, but Evil Lotus laughed and
said, “You guys do not need to fight. You are all going to die.
This place has more than one xenogeneic.”</p>
<p>Hearing Evil Lotus say that, Second Uncle’s face changed.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God suddenly screamed at the sky. That scream was
like a rumbling thunder that extended beyond hundreds of miles. It
made the sounds echo and roll.</p>
<p>“Not long later, the xenogeneics from a few thousand miles will
be drawn here. Although they are not as strong as this Cold Light
Charm, it is enough to kill you guys.” Evil Lotus God coldly
laughed.</p>
<p>Second Uncle looked terrible. He forced a smile and said, “Evil
Lotus God, you and I have no grudge. Why must you kill us all?”</p>
<p>“It is too late to say that now,” Evil Lotus said emotionlessly.
“Whoever follows me lives, and whoever goes against me dies. You
guys dared to go against me, a God, so you are all going to
die.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s face looked panicked. Although they did not see any
xenogeneics, they heard some scary beast noises roaring. They were
coming for them. Clearly, many scary xenogeneics were
approaching.</p>
<p>Second Uncle laughed and said, “Fourth Brother, it looks like
today the brothers need to kill.”</p>
<p>After speaking, Second Uncle unbound the restrictions he had
placed on Meng Lie. He knew they were going to die there.</p>
<p>“Second Brother, it is just you and me. We will kill them until
we fall.” Meng Lie raised his spear and jumped.</p>
<p>“Uncles, let me help you guys as well.” Han Sen knew this was a
life-and-death moment. He stopped hesitating and summoned his Sky
Star Wolf beast soul. He was also holding his Ying Head Ghost beast
soul, which was a skull. He confidently went forward.</p>
<p>Second Uncle did not think Han Sen could help, but he knew they
were going to die in this fight sooner or later. So, he did not
stop Han Sen.</p>
