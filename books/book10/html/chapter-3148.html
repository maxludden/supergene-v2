<p>Sky King saw Han Sen and the others return from their venture
safe and sound. He wasn’t too surprised. He laughed and asked,
“Brother Han and Bao’er, what are the fruits of your labors like
this time?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not beat around the bush and told it to him
straight. “The rewards were average. We only managed to dig up one
god-class gene egg. We are only coming back to ask Mister Wei for
help. We want Mister Wei to help us locate the primary land pulse
in the river.” “I am afraid that might prove difficult,” Sky King
quietly said. “It is not that I do not want to help you, but Mister
Wei is not one of my men. He has always avoided such dangerous
formations. I am afraid it will be a lot to ask of him. How about
this? I will come with you to seek out Mister Wei. He might be more
inclined to agree with me there.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Sky King laughed and said, “Do not worry, Mister Han. I really
love Bao’er. I still want to take her as a student. Speaking of
that, you are no outsider to me. I would like to help you all that
I can.”</p>
<p>Although Sky King was there to convince Mister Wei, Mister Wei
did not agree to help dig up land pulses around God of Wealth
River. He said that place was death, and it was a place that should
not be meddled with. He also tried to convince Han Sen and Sky King
not to trifle with the area. Otherwise, only bad things would come
to pass.</p>
<p>It was fine if Mister Wei did not want to go with them. Han Sen
just asked him where the main pulse was along the God of Wealth
River, but Mister Wei wouldn’t say. He did not want to be
responsible for someone coming to harm.</p>
<p>Han Sen was speechless. He wanted to convince him further, but
someone soon arrived. He explained that one of Mister Wei’s
students had died outside of the base.</p>
<p>Everyone went to have a look. It was learned that Bald Guy’s
Brother Three had been beheaded. He was a crumpled, headless corpse
on the floor. Blood was everywhere.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others knew he had been the power of the break
head wire.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and coldly thought, “That guy was brave. How
dare he dig land pulses along my God of Wealth River?” God of
Wealth Temple was currently overseen by Decapitation Queen. The God
of Wealth River would not allow anyone to get close to the
temple.</p>
<p>Without Han Sen’s permission to go digging land pulses around
the God of Wealth River, there was a guaranteed death sentence.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy were shocked. They had watched Han Sen
murder Decapitation Queen, so they did not understand why the break
head wire was still working.</p>
<p>Thinking about that, they looked at Han Sen, who pretended he
hadn’t seen anything. He did not want to explain. After this, it
was guaranteed that Mister Wei would not tell anyone where the main
land pulse was along the God of Wealth River. There was nothing Han
Sen could do about it now.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t find the main land pulse, it was pointless
digging up ordinary land pulses. The area around God of Wealth
River was his territory. He could go digging whenever he wanted to.
So, Han Sen planned on going to the other five planets of Ghost
Starlight. Perhaps he would find something there.</p>
<p>Sky King told Han Sen that the other five planets had already
been taken by people with powers as big as his.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. Sky King went on to say, “The god fights are to
begin soon. If you are going to risk doing battle with people on
other planets, why don’t you ready yourself to participate in the
god fights? If you win the first god rank, you can get a rare gene
egg as a reward. Wouldn’t that be better than digging up some
random stuff from a land pulse?”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be bad.” Han Sen had heard Sky King mention the god
fights before. He asked Bald Guy what the god fights were. The
so-called god fights were about fighting all types of god temples.
It was a traditional event associated with god temples that took
place every 10 years. They just had to go back to the god temple
where they got their Blood-Pulse from and could then represent
their God Spirit in battle.</p>
<p>If a challenger managed to defeat all their enemies in these
fights, the challenger was rewarded with a rare gene egg.</p>
<p>Even if they did not achieve first place, they got a gene egg as
a reward. Everyone in the top 100 got one. If people performed well
in the god fights, they were admired by the God Spirits and had the
chance to inherit a Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>Across history, many nobles had been able to earn an eternal
god-blood noble status through the god fights.</p>
<p>It was still weird. Every 10 years, there was one rare gene egg.
The universe of kingdoms had many billions of years in its history.
Many of the rare gene races should have been seen by now. Now, the
universe did not have many rare gene races.</p>
<p>There were only seven or eight days left before the next god
fights. Sky King had already prepared a return trip so he could
participate in the god fights. Han Sen did not have a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse, so, he wanted to go back to the God of Wealth Temple
and see if he could join the god fights.</p>
<p>There were still seven or eight days until the next god fights,
so Han Sen was not in a rush. He followed Bald Guy to dig up more
land pulses. He then asked Sky King to send people to deliver the
useless gene eggs to Mister Yang in Jade Wall City. At least, his
shop would blow up in popularity.</p>
<p>Before Sky King departed, he asked Han Sen to look after the
planet. He did not want him to leave the place open for someone
else to swoop in and rob all the land pulses.</p>
<p>Han Sen immediately agreed. He had a 30% stake in that planet.
For the sake of that 30%, he was not going to allow anyone to take
over the place.</p>
<p>After Sky King left, the big sky demon, which had been missing
for a while, appeared next to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“My little lover, you made a big mistake.” The big sky demon was
next to Han Sen, reaching her hand out to stroke his cheeks. “What
mistake did I make?” Han Sen casually asked.</p>
<p>“You killed a member of the God Chaos Party,” the big sky demon
said with a sigh. “You slew Decapitation Queen. People from the God
Chaos Party will not let you go.”</p>
<p>“If I can kill the Decapitation Queen, I can take down others,”
Han Sen coldly said.</p>
<p>The big sky demon behaved as if she was comforting Han Sen. She
continued to stroke his cheeks and said, “My little lover, you are
strong. You were able to kill Decapitation Queen, but challenging
the God Chaos Party will not get you anything if you do not do
things right. There is an 80% to 90% chance you will die.”</p>
<p>“Why was I told that the God Chaos Party members were already
killed by a sky full of God Spirits and there weren’t any surviving
members?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>The big sky demon shook her head. “Those guys in the God Chaos
Party cannot be easily killed. Many of them died in the past, but a
few of the core members were able to remain. The most important
thing to know, however, is that the president of the God Chaos
Party was not killed. After a billion years of rest, the God Chaos
Party is on the cusp of returning.”</p>
<p>“You seem to know a lot about the God Chaos Party.” Han Sen
looked at the big sky demon and asked, Are you a member of the God
Chaos Party?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was one of the God Chaos Party’s three vice presidents,”
the big sky demon replied with a laugh.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He had not expected the big sky demon to
confess to it so simply.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the big sky demon and asked, “Does that mean
you are going to try and avenge Decapitation Queen?”</p>
<p>The big sky demon put her face on Han Sen’s chest and said, “Of
course not. I would never dream of killing my lover. Plus, I left
the God Chaos Party a long time ago.”</p>
