<p>Upon hearing what Black Steel said, Han Sen knew that the man
must know something about this. But now was not the time to ask, so
he was going to wait until Black Steel arrived.</p>
<p>But soon, Han Sen’s worries became reality. More people in the
base began to develop strange egg markings on their foreheads. It
seemed to be spreading.</p>
<p>People could be isolated easily enough, but that wasn’t a proper
solution to the issue.</p>
<p>As time went on, more and more people developed that same
strange mark. In the beginning, it only spread amongst the people
who were at the gate when the Viscount died. Then, it started to
happen amongst the mothers and children who hadn’t even been
there.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few hours, half of the people in the base
developed the same mark across their foreheads.</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen, Little Angel, Zero, Xie Qing King, Gu
Qingcheng, and Little Silver had not yet been infected by the
strange affliction. It was very fortunate.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng had examined the infected people
and noted that there didn’t actually seem to be anything wrong
them. But the whole base was so scared that those who were not yet
infected wanted to abandon the place. If Han Sen hadn’t just killed
two Viscount creatures and enlisted the aid of Deep Blue Viscount,
the base would have descended into chaos.</p>
<p>Out of the four Viscount Nobles, Wind Viscount was dead. Deep
Blue Viscount was helpful, whereas Lake didn’t do anything. The
other Viscount had been missing for the past two days. Where he had
disappeared to, no one knew.</p>
<p>Han Sen contacted Black Steel to update him on the situation
that was currently unfolding. Han Sen didn’t want him to end up
getting infected as well.</p>
<p>“Wait for me,” Black Steel said, before hanging up again. It
sounded as if he was doing something in a rush.</p>
<p>Before Black Steel arrived, Deep Blue Viscount came over to see
Han Sen.</p>
<p>When Deep Blue Viscount arrived at Han Sen’s house, he
immediately stripped off his armor. His forehead now had the
egg-shaped marking, too.</p>
<p>“Do you feel anything?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount was calm, and he merely shook his head. “I
don’t feel anything. If I hadn’t looked in the mirror, I wouldn’t
even have known the mark had appeared.”</p>
<p>“Then, what do you plan on doing?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount went quiet, and he said, “I told you I wanted
to speak with you alone. Do you have the time to do so, right
now?”</p>
<p>Yeah.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount sat down and dropped into thought for a
minute before speaking. He said, “I know that most Nobles here have
ulterior motives. I do, as well. But I am different in one way; I
don’t work for anyone.”</p>
<p>“Then, why are you here?” Han Sen asked him.</p>
<p>Viscounts were of a high rank, and he’d be a wanted asset
anywhere he went. There wasn’t a reason for him to follow Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount gave a wry smile. He pointed to the mark on
his forehead and said something that shocked Han Sen. “I am here
for this.”</p>
<p>Han Sen really was shocked, and he replied by saying, “You are
here for that? Do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>He nodded, then shook his head and sighed. “This is not my first
time on Planet Eclipse.”</p>
<p>You have been here before? Were you with the Earl?” Han Sen
immediately asked.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount smiled and said, “Yes. I got this mark when I
was here the last time.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, but at the same time, he was delighted. It
had been many years since the Earl’s mission. And despite that,
Deep Blue Viscount was still living. The infected would be safe,
for now, at least.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount suspected these were the thoughts running
through Han Sen’s mind, and he smiled wrily. “It is not like that.
Ordinarily, when you get this, you die in a short time. It could be
two days, or it could be two weeks. People will ultimately end up
like Wind Viscount did. There is a reason why I survived, and that
is the reason for my return.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything, wanting him to continue
explaining. Since Deep Blue was volunteering information, he might
as well learn everything he could.</p>
<p>“When I was taken here by Chiron Earl, I was just a commoner. I
was just like those kids, really; but a little bit bigger. I
already had my geno armor and everything.” When Deep Blue Viscount
said that, he looked weird. Han Sen did not understand.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount went on to say, “I followed Chiron Earl
everywhere, including his final trip into the northern mountains. I
was there.”</p>
<p>“I thought that none of those who went returned,” Han Sen said
in shock.</p>
<p>“I was the only one who made it out. Back then, only normal
people resided at the base. No one was aware of the fact that I had
followed him. The Rebate investigator never considered that Chiron
Earl would have bothered to bring an ordinary Kate.” Deep Blue
Viscount wore a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“What happened there? And what is up with the egg mark?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount shook his head. “I do not understand what
happened. Back then I was a kid that possessed geno armor. My
powers and my knowledge were very limited.”</p>
<p>After that, Deep Blue Viscount went on to say, “And in regards
to the egg mark, you will only contract it after you touch
something. Aside from me, everyone who got this mark died. And that
included Chiron Earl. When I made it out, I did not infect anyone.
I am not sure what Wind Viscount did, but it is clear that his
affliction is contagious.”</p>
<p>“Where did the Earl’s group encounter it, exactly?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount said, “There is a palace up in those
mountains, and it is very big. It was so strange inside there. I
did not know much back then, so I only followed Chiron Earl. Many
people died, and when we were in front of a certain hall, Chiron
Earl seemed to become incredibly happy. We waited outside while he
went in alone. We waited half a day, and eventually, he returned
with something.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the most important part of his tale would be this,
so he didn’t interrupt. He kept on listening.</p>
<p>“It was an egg. A black egg that was as tall as a person. It
looked just like the markings do. He brought it out and allowed us
to carry it. And when we were just about to leave the palace,
something scary happened. Our foreheads began to develop that black
mark.” Deep Blue Viscount looked scared, as if he was remembering
something bad.</p>
