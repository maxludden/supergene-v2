    <p>
      Han Sen never expected things to turn out so well; it was quite the
      surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he returned, he contacted his mother. He hoped that she could
      rendezvous for a meet and greet with the Ji family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan did not object, and so Han Sen quickly brought her to meet the
      Ji family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought it would just be a discussion about an engagement, and all
      it would require was the simple forming of an acquaintance between the
      parents of the engaged couple. When he actually arrived, with his mother,
      he was surprised to see it wasn&#8217;t only Mister and Missus Ji there to
      greet them, but Ji Yanran&#8217;s aunts and uncles, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Missus Han, our Ji family have many rules. I hope you do not take
      offense at them,&#8221; Missus Ji explained politely, but her tone was
      stuffy and oozed arrogance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know. Security is a high concern when dealing with the marriage
      of a daughter. I have a daughter, too. I understand how you feel,&#8221;
      Luo Sulan smiled and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Please take a seat, Missus Han.&#8221; Ji Ruozhen looked at Luo
      Sulan with sudden surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Han&#8217;s family background was something they knew all about. But
      Luo Sulan&#8217;s temperament and mannerisms were different than what they
      expected from a housewife.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they discussed the details of the engagement, Luo Sulan seemed quite
      understanding and appeared very polite towards the Ji family. Her manners
      were excellent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t think it was anything surprising. From what he could
      recall, Luo Sulan had always been an elegant woman.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen was a kid, his mother was like a fairy to him. She always
      protected him. But after his father&#8217;s accident, his mother&#8217;s
      life was forced to change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing his mom like this took Han Sen back to his childhood for a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this event, however, Han Sen was a youngster; he had no place to
      interrupt and speak. Quietly, all he did was stand behind his mother and
      watch the conversation unfold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran was the same, standing beside her parents. She too just listened
      in on the conversation, without saying a word of her own volition. She
      would only speak when spoken to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Things were going very well, and Luo Sulan did not ask for much of
      anything. The Ji family all agreed she was a nice person and believed her
      to be a well-educated housewife.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Missus Han, after they both get married, I would like them both to
      become part of the Ji family. I believe it would be easier for us to take
      care of them, but I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.&#8221;
      Missus Ji posed the question.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not have a notable background, but if Grandfather Ji thought
      he had a promising future, they thought it best nurtured within the Ji
      family. Through their influence, he could gain far more and his change of
      family name would reflect better on Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      Missus Ji also wanted to see her daughter, whenever she could. Therefore,
      this matter was a serious issue of discussion for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a desire of Grandfather Ji, too. The Ji family would allow the
      marriage, but only on the condition that Han Sen joined their family.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am sorry, Missus Ji. I only have one son, and I was hoping he
      could be by my side when I grow old,&#8221; Luo Sulan responded. Coldly,
      she continued to say, &#8220;He is still a man of Han. A man should make
      his own family, don&#8217;t you agree?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Missus Ji&#8217;s face changed at those words. One of Ji Yanran&#8217;s
      aunts chimed in to say, &#8220;Missus Han, please reconsider your position
      on this. You are indeed correct in saying a man should create his own
      family. But one man&#8217;s power is limited. If, in the future, he became
      Ruozhen&#8217;s son-in-law, that would make him the son-of-law of the
      president. If he did something inappropriate, it would shame our
      family.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Missus Han. What year is this? Our Ji family is willing to
      help Han Sen, for with our power, he can become someone grand. He will
      make you prouder than you can imagine,&#8221; another middle-aged woman
      joined in to speak.
    </p>

    <p>
      Missus Ji then rejoined the talk, saying, &#8220;Missus Han, if Han Sen
      marries our daughter, he will be half my son. The Ji family will help him
      forge a legacy of his own and commit to fine, broad deeds. Isn&#8217;t
      that what you desire?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t have many expectations. I only want him to be with
      me. Carrying on the Han family legacy is more than enough for me,&#8221;
      Luo Sulan replied to the criticizers.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Missus Han, this is not right. How can you not share concern for
      your son&#8217;s future? Do you know what he will receive when he joins
      us? What he will achieve and where he will go? Aren&#8217;t you selfish
      for not allowing him to join our family?&#8221; Missus Ji&#8217;s tone was
      infected with undertones of anger now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could not hold his tongue any longer. He could take all the
      pressure, if he was the one under the microscope, but he couldn&#8217;t
      stand for his mother to be bullied anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as Han Sen was about to move, Luo Sulan&#8217;s left hand stopped
      him. Although Luo Sulan did not turn to look, she held onto him really
      hard and prevented him from doing that which he wanted to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran quickly tugged at her mom&#8217;s sleeves, as well. She wanted
      her to stop pushing with her dialogue.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Missus Ji was in no mood to stop her criticism, and she proceeded to
      say, &#8220;Missus Han, the Ji family is large and rich. My husband, Ji
      Ruozhen, is the president of the Alliance. Do you really think I will
      allow my daughter to sink through the mud to be with you?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;When you get married, the woman tends to follow her husband. Yanran
      is a fine child, and I&#8217;m sure she will be just fine,&#8221; Luo
      Sulan calmly responded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as Missus Ji was getting mad, prepared to say something else, a voice
      of someone annoyed came from further back, behind a screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A housewife&#8217;s opinion is one that allows their man to do
      everything. You are destroying his future.&#8221; The voice was calm, but
      it was one that was drenched in intimidation. After the man spoke,
      everyone on the Ji&#8217;s side quieted down.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What can the Ji family provide him?&#8221; Luo Sulan, as composed
      as ever, looked to the screen and spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A reputation within the Alliance. One that will earn him the
      world.&#8221; These words were spoken by Grandfather Ji. They were
      commanding words, and they were spoken with power.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If that is the future, then I&#8217;d rather he stayed at home
      raising babies,&#8221; Luo Sulan coldly scoffed in rebuttal. She was not
      spooked by the man that was now addressing her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ji family&#8217;s face looked strange, as what she said seemed so
      lame.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You woman! You really don&#8217;t know your place. I am being nice
      to your son, and you suggest he raise babies. What is it that you think
      men should do?&#8221; Grandfather Ji was furious. He stepped beyond the
      screen to see the woman that defied him, wanting to destroy her
      son&#8217;s future.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people of the Ji family were shocked, witnessing Grandfather Ji reveal
      himself. He looked mad, and not a single other person was willing to speak
      while he did so or try and usher calmness into him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Grandpa!&#8221; All apart from Ji Yanran, that was. She ran forward
      and tried to stop her grandfather&#8217;s advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grandfather Ji coldly said, &#8220;Do not worry. I am not planning to do
      anything; I just want to see who this disrespectful woman is.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As he talked, he walked in the direction of Luo Sulan. He took a look as
      he went, and his face entirely changed when he saw her.
    </p>

    <p>
      He then quickly ran directly in front of her, which shocked the Ji family
      audience. They believed his wrath had been incited so much, he was running
      forward to do something.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was not so. Grandfather Ji looked nervous, and he reached out his
      hand to her. He wanted to grab her, but he pulled back as his body
      shivered.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lady Lan! You are Lady Lan? Do you not remember the Ji&#8217;s
      third brother?&#8221; Grandfather Ji&#8217;s vocal chords were trembling.
      His knees went soft, and he knelt in front of her with tears rolling down
      his cheeks.
