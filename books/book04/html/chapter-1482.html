      Seeing Han Sen’s opponent was Xu Mi, Elysian Moon frowned and said to
      herself, “Xu Mi is far too powerful. If Han Sen is hit, I don’t think
      he’ll even have the time to concede. If I was him, I’d turn tail and run
      right this second.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the arena, Xu Mi approached Han Sen. He hadn’t drawn his weapon, and
      the spirit just looked at the human and said, “A human once told me every
      man has a price for everything. How much are your sword skills worth? What
      would you accept as payment for teaching me your technique?”
    </p>
    <p>After Xu Mi said this, everyone was shocked.</p>
    <p>
      The son of two emperors who was really famous wanted to learn the fighting
      techniques of a human. It was almost too shocking to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>“For one super geno core, I’ll teach you anything,” Han Sen said.</p>
    <p>
      “Okay, but I cannot bring a super geno core here. When we leave Geno Core
      Battleground, you can seek me out in Furnace Shelter. If you’d prefer, I
      can come find you in a place of your determining.” Xu Mi immediately
      agreed to this, and it seemed Han Sen’s sword techniques were deemed more
      valuable than a super geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people in the audience were all in shock. Not everyone could obtain a
      super geno core so easily. Many creatures toiled and struggled across the
      years to get their one, sole super geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Xu Mi wanted to swap Han Sen’s sword skills for a super geno core, it
      made everyone want to know what Han Sen’s talents were and why they were
      worth such a geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll find you in Furnace Shelter, when I have the time,” Han Sen said
      randomly. Xu Mi’s agreement actually came as a surprise. But it made Han
      Sen feel as if the kids of emperors were typical spoiled rich kids, and
      unsure of the actual value of items such as a super geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, if this business is concluded, let’s fight!” Han Sen said, as he drew
      Taia.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fight? If I was able to beat you, I wouldn’t have to learn your sword
      skills now, would I? I concede. Just remember; come and find me in Furnace
      Shelter,” Xu Mi said casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the audience had been surprised by Red Dragon’s concession, then they
      were completely floored as Xu Mi conceded and exited the arena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon’s face contorted. She had never imagined something like this
      could happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “While we were separated, what did he get up to?” Elysian Moon thought she
      had come to know Han Sen, but again, she was now feeling like he was a
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen returned to his same seat. Elysian Moon didn’t say anything, and
      just looked at him instead. She never thought he’d actually be able to
      compete, and her expression was growing more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Xu Mi, the son of two emperors, conceded to him. She was feeling a
      lot of pressure now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits and creatures around the bleachers all had their eyes on Han
      Sen and Elysian Moon now. They were all talking about them, despite the
      fact those two were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had won twice without needing to fight. Everyone was getting an
      idea of how powerful he must have been, but Han Sen didn’t think this was
      of much help.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get a God geno core, Han Sen would inevitably have to go through
      Elysian Moon and Six Paths. If he was lucky, Elysian Moon and Six Paths
      would have to battle each other first, leaving Han Sen with only one to
      deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fights would go on until there was a winner. The phantom doors
      continued to light up, beckoning fighters into the arena. Whoever found
      themselves going up against Six Paths or Elysian Moon surrendered and
      conceded immediately, with much fear for their life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not so lucky, though. Although all the combatants knew his
      name as Sky Sword, many of them still wished to witness his true strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      A super creature in the third round sniffed Han Sen and decided to
      concede, but on the fourth round, the king spirit he faced did not want to
      give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sky Sword, huh? I want to see if you have what it takes to wear such a
      fancy, self-loving title. You really think you are the strongest swordsman
      in existence?” The spirit drew his own sword and lunged towards Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never said I am Sky Sword,” Han Sen said tiredly, pulling out his own
      sword to do battle with the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t like the title Sky Sword, either. It sounded old-fashioned
      and stiff. He much preferred the title Dollar, because that at least
      suggested he was rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit swung his blade in a flurry that looked like a thousand
      simultaneous strikes. The entire arena was covered in those slashes, in a
      bid to not give Han Sen the space to dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit was called One Hundred Swords, and his geno core was Ten
      Thousand Swords. He had been born with very powerful AoE skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Hundred Swords heard Han Sen had beaten Red Dragon and Xu Mi, so he
      knew his opponent’s sword skills had to be formidable. If this was a case
      of sword skill versus sword skill, there was a chance he’d be the weaker
      of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had the Ten Thousand Swords geno core, and with its spread, it did
      not allow Han Sen to use his sword skills. It forced him to fight his
      opponent with strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing all the swords coming at him, though, Han Sen was not afraid. With
      Taia primed, he was more than ready to fight back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen needed his sword skills to win, but that was only for Xu Mi. Xu
      Mi’s sword was too strong, so Han Sen had to beat the spirit with
      movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Hundred Swords had a gemstone geno core, but it was weaker than Xu
      Mi’s. As a result, Han Sen did not have to dodge.
    </p>
    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s Taia blocked every sword that came close. He didn’t flinch once,
      and he managed to approach One Hundred Swords amidst that barrage. With
      Han Sen’s strength, he wouldn’t be at a disadvantage against any
      gemstone-owning beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience had only heard Han Sen’s skills were strong. They had yet to
      see him in action with their own two eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, seeing Han Sen fight One Hundred Swords the way he was, they were
      able to understand why Xu Mi was willing to pay the price of a super geno
      core to learn Han Sen’s techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the first attack, One Hundred Swords was unable to make
      another. All his skills were successfully canceled, and if he kept going,
      he was going to end up on Han Sen’s sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s sword skills seemed almost able to predict the future, like the
      wielder was a god. At first, Han Sen’s attacks seemed to be missing
      anything critical. But after seeing One Hundred Swords’s strike, they
      noticed the moveset was nothing short of miraculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one of Han Sen’s attacks was for the future, and this godly sword
      skill shocked everyone to see. After witnessing its capabilities, no one
      thought a super geno core was too expensive a price to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a f*cking bargain. If I had a super geno core and an affinity for
      the sword, I’d pay up to learn a sword skill as godly as this.”
