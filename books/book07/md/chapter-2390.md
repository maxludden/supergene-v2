Han Sen didn’t speak. He focused on his Dongxuan Sutra, using its strength to guide the torrent of power that was surging through him. He tried to direct it toward his self-universe cogwheel.

Although Han Sen was proficient with the techniques of Yin Yang Blast and Yin Yang Change, Fox Queen was putting so much power into him that it was difficult for him to guide the vast quantity.

The nine-tailed silver fox marking covered Han Sen’s body like the shadow of a demon. That weird perfume-like smell was growing stronger, and it almost felt as if it was becoming solid and tangible.

“It is futile! Your power as a Duke has a ceiling. No other Duke can match your strength, and not even first or second-tier Kings could hope to equal you. But compared to me, you are far too weak. Do you honestly believe you can use my power for your own gain? You must be joking.” Fox Queen’s voice whispered through Han Sen’s head.

Fox Queen’s body was hugged Han Sen’s tightly, and her lips were pressed against his as she poured the Nine Spin Fox powers into him. She controlled the power that came gushing into him, directing it little by little to transform Han Sen into a Nine Spin Fox Clone.

Han Sen tried his hardest to guide the Nine Spin Fox power, but it was staggeringly different from anything he was used to. He attempted to wrestle it from Fox Queen’s control and twist its purpose, but she maintained an iron grip on her energy. He was about to make use of a new trick, but his back suddenly felt hot. A scary power started to spread across his back.

Han Sen jerked in surprise. He wasn’t ready to use the trick he had planned, but a foreign power was being unleashed from his back. That power didn’t belong to Han Sen, but he could tell that it didn’t belong to Fox Queen, either.

Something red appeared out of Han Sen’s back. Han Sen activated his Dongxuan Aura to get a better look. The skin of his back, which was originally covered by the Fox markings, had turned scarlet. The blood-like color deepened until it revealed a crimson image.

“That is… Ancient Blood Dragon Lady.” Han Sen was shocked.

The red symbol on Han Sen’s back looked like a woman with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a slithering snake. A horn sprouted from her head. It was an ugly image, and the figure looked quite like a phantom. He was certain that it was the Ancient Blood Dragon Lady, though.

“Is this the picture that the prisoner dude drew upon my back when I was in Holy Town?” Han Sen knew where that painting had come from.

Back then, he had been unable to view what had been drawn on his back. Right before it disappeared, Bao’er told him it was an ugly woman. This was the first time Han Sen had gotten the chance to see it. He hadn’t realized that the painting was still hidden on his back, or that it would be activated by Fox Queen in this manner.

Han Sen didn’t know what the painting did, but the power that came out of the drawing was just as strong as what Fox Queen was forcing inside him. It pushed away the Nine Spin Fox markings and asserted dominance over his whole back.

Han Sen’s back was in agony, though. It felt like he had been branded with hot steel. The Nine Spin Fox power had most certainly been pushed back.

As the Ancient Blood Dragon Lady’s painting grew more detailed, a shadow of the Ancient Blood Dragon Lady manifested. It stood across from the shadow of the Nine-Tail Fox. It covered Han Sen’s back, while the fox covered Han Sen’s chest. The two powers fought for supremacy inside him.

“The Sacred Blood Statue! Why do you have the Sacred Blood Statue?” Fox Queen screamed.

She looked terrified. She struggled to free herself from Han Sen’s body, but now, something was pulling her in. She couldn’t move, and her power was surging into Han Sen’s body uncontrollably.

“What’s the Sacred Blood Statue?” Han Sen frowned. The situation was spiraling wildly out of control. The blood-colored painting was still there, and his heart was beginning to ache.

Fox Queen was chattering in fear. “Impossible! Sacred is destroyed… The Sacred Leader is dead! There’s no one living who could draw the Sacred Blood Statue… How is this possible?”

“What is the Sacred Blood Statue?” Han Sen repeated when Fox Queen continued to make no sense.

Fox Queen tried to calm down a little. But she was still in shock, and she said, “It was a way for the Sacred Leader to control subordinates. If the image of the Sacred Blood Statue was drawn on someone’s body, that body could be consumed at any time. As long as the Sacred Blood Statue wasn’t activated, nothing would be amiss. The drawing might even be beneficial. It could silently make your body stronger. But the Sacred Blood Statue has now been activated, and so it will start to consume the power and flesh of its host until they have been eaten entirely.”

“Why do you have the Sacred Blood Statue? And is it a blood drawing of the Ancient Blood Dragon Lady? Why didn’t you tell me any sooner? You almost got me killed!” Fox Queen gnashed her teeth and summoned her own power. She wanted to use her power to pull herself out of Han Sen’s body, but under the influence of the Sacred Blood Statue, her powers appeared to have been magnetized. Fox Queen couldn’t away, and so her energy continued pumping into Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen could clearly feel the Sacred Blood Statue on his back. It was tearing viciously into his power and flesh like some voracious ghoul. If this kept going, his body might soon be eaten by the Sacred Blood Statue.

But the Sacred Blood Statue’s power had already blended into Han Sen’s body, and its power was already inside him. If Han Sen tried to destroy the Sacred Blood Statue, then that meant he’d be destroying his own body. If that happened, he’d die.

“Fuck! That motherf*cker Sacred Leader was messed up. What kind of sicko creates a geno art like this?” Han Sen swore.

When Fox Queen realized that she was completely unable to pull away, she severed her connection to the power outright. She instantly started coughing up blood, and her face turned as white as a sheet. But she had at least managed to disconnect herself from Han Sen. She stumbled away from his body.

She had expended a lot of power, and she felt like she had hacked off a large portion of her own body. Severing her power had left her gravely wounded.

Without the support of Fox Queen’s power, Han Sen’s Nine Tail Fox marking started to dim. He now had far less energy to combat the Ancient Blood Dragon Lady of the Sacred Blood Statue. He was getting consumed.

“Game over… game over…” Fox Queen looked haunted. Her attempt to gain access to Destiny’s Tower had backfired spectacularly.

Han Sen was getting consumed by the Sacred Blood Statue, and God only knew when she might find another chance to enter Destiny’s Tower.

Fox Queen looked at Han Sen with a complicated set of emotions. Then she stomped her feet and left.

The Sacred Blood Statue had been activated, and Han Sen was on his way to his death. If she stayed around and was discovered, it would become known that she had murdered Prince Sixteen. That would not turn out well.

As she left, Fox Queen felt depressed. She thought she could reclaim the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror, but her opportunity had disappeared because of her own greediness.

In addition, she was now severely wounded. Without the help of the deified item she had planned to steal, it would take at least a year for her to recover.

“Dear Han Sen, I didn’t want to kill you. Your luck really is just that bad.” Fox Queen quickly departed Planet Water Zone. She did not dare to stay in case someone saw her there when Han Sen died.
