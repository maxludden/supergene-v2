<h2>A Hero to Save the Beauties</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2552</h3>

<p>Han Sen had no interest in humiliating Ji Yang Sheng, and he
didn’t really want to get in the carriage. He just wanted to see if
he could draw out some of the Demons that might be nearby.</p>
<p>If they wanted to save Ji Yang Sheng or eliminate Han Sen, it
would be hard for them to do that in the core area. It would likely
prompt would-be saviors to use their Demon Dolls.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s true purpose was to lure out more of those Demon Dolls
so he could take them for himself. It would be great for him to
have a few deified Demon Dolls in his back pocket.</p>
<p>The existence of the Demon Dolls was a very strange thing. The
Demon Doll Han Sen had already obtained had a lifeforce and could
think for itself a little. It never looked like it was truly alive,
though.</p>
<p>Its mind only came alive when it received commands via the
purple horn. If it wasn’t being controlled, it would stand in place
like a deactivated robot.</p>
<p>Plus, people were supposedly unable to travel to the core area
with another living thing. Despite that, the Demon Dolls could be
brought into the core area. That meant it wasn’t a living thing on
its own.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if a deified Demon Doll could come through,
though. If that was possible, then the Demons should have surely
been stronger in the core area than the Extreme King were.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this was just Han Sen’s line of thinking.
These were his guesses. It might not even be possible to bring
deified Demon Dolls into the core area. Even if they could enter,
the Demons might only use them in secret to avoid word of them
spreading to other races.</p>
<p>“Come and take a look. New things happen every day, and this is
assuredly the latest. The Demon’s Ji Yang Sheng is pulling a
rickshaw.”</p>
<p>“Ji Yang Sheng is loved by the Demon alpha. He was so cocky, and
now, he has been reduced to a rickshaw boy. Who is on the carriage
he is pulling? It cannot be a King of the Extreme King, can
it?”</p>
<p>“What King class of the Extreme King could do that? Such a feat
is beyond any of them.”</p>
<p>“You must be joking. In this universe, who could be stronger
than the Extreme King?”</p>
<p>“You’re forgetting God’s Daddy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you mean Han Sen? That guy isn’t dead?”</p>
<p>“Dead? He is living just fine. He’s somehow forced Ji Yang Sheng
to do this, and he has two very beautiful women next to him. Don’t
you see those two girls? They are so beautiful. I don’t think
anyone else, out of all the races in existence, could be more
beautiful than those two. I’d be willing to die for just one turn
in the sheets with them.”</p>
<p>“Really? They’re that hot?”</p>
<p>“I’m not kidding. I saw a princess of the Extreme King once upon
a time, but compared to these two… she was nothing. These girls are
so much hotter. The Extreme King princesses are hardly fit to be
their handmaidens.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I must get a closer look.”</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng lowered his head and continued to pull the
carriage. He didn’t say a word. He was so angry, and he thought to
himself, “Han Sen, that *sshole. Don’t let me find a chance to kill
you, because I will be ready to pounce the moment an opportunity
appears.”</p>
<p>Someone took a video of the scene and distributed it. The entire
universe came to know that Ji Yang Sheng was a rickshaw boy for Han
Sen. The leaders of the Demon were about to start retching blood
out of shame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the elites that had once been around Ji Yang Sheng
had been killed. The backup elites were far away, and it would be a
long time before they could get in range.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned on drawing many Demons out, but the Demons
didn’t come. Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were very angry about
the fact that they were attracting many horny men.</p>
<p>Luckily, they only showed themselves in the beginning. After a
while, the girls hid their faces. They wore armor so that no
naughty people or creatures could see what they looked like.</p>
<p>But even so, many Kings still came over to watch.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the Kings came to see the women, but most of
the Kings were just there to see Han Sen. They wanted to gain his
blessing or capture him.</p>
<p>But seeing this half-deified Demon Ji Yang Sheng pulling a
rickshaw for Han Sen, no one dared to try anything provocative. If
they were going to take him by force, they would prefer waiting for
stronger elites to come.</p>
<p>Han Sen traveled for half a day before someone was bold enough
to try to bar his way.</p>
<p>“Look, someone is here. Film it quickly. Let us watch and see
who is looking for Han Sen. Isn’t that Autumn Wind of the Aichi
race?”</p>
<p>“Teehee. The Aichi are very famous for being womanizers. Autumn
Wind must be going after those two girls.”</p>
<p>“The Aichi are pretty well-respected out of all the high races.
They have many elites in their ranks, and they are particularly
proficient when it comes to wielding bows. There are many archers
in their race. Still, aside from all that, the Aichi are pretty
lazy. Most of their elites are just hired by other races. There are
few races that don’t have an Aichi archer to help them. This Autumn
Wind is probably the best archer they’ve had for many centuries. He
is half-deified, and he might one day become deified. This guy
might actually take down Han Sen.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid his target isn’t Han Sen; it is actually those two
girls.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that Autumn Wind has what it takes. Han Sen’s
title of God’s Daddy isn’t a mere joke. Even the Extreme King
deified elites failed to catch him, so I doubt there is much Autumn
Wind can accomplish.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not. The Tianxia System and the systems of chaos are too
complicated. Those deifieds would obviously run into trouble if
they were after Han Sen and he hid well. In the core area, it isn’t
so easy to hide.”</p>
<p>While everyone was talking, Han Sen’s bronze carriage moved
right in front of Autumn Wind.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Autumn Wind. He looked just like a human. He
was shorter and skinnier than Han Sen, but his face was very
delicate. His ears were long and sharp, in particular. He had long,
silver hair with transparent wings on his back. He was like an elf
out of legends.</p>
<p>“Why are you getting in my way?” Han Sen asked, looking coldly
at Autumn Wind.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon and said, “I
had heard that there were two beautiful women here. It said their
image can stun the entire universe. So, I have just come here to
take a look. I thought the tales must have been exaggerated, but
before I could even see them, their presence alone was enough to
make me drunk. These intoxicating feelings are surely worth the
trip. I wonder if these two women are willing to reveal their faces
to me. I am willing to die for the sight.”</p>
<p>“You should go home while you still can,” Han Sen said
flatly.</p>
<p>“I’m serious about this. Ladies, if you will allow me to see
your faces, I’m willing to be a slave for you. Heck, I would kill
myself immediately and not even be upset about it.” Autumn Wind
ignored Han Sen, begging Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon for a
look.</p>
<p>Despite his monologue, it didn’t seem like he was looking for a
fight.</p>
<p>Han Sen was about to tell Ji Yang Sheng to continue past Autumn
Wind, but Elysian Moon suddenly said, “You can see our true selves,
but only if you beat him. Do that, and you can see us.”</p>
<p>Elysian Moon’s words shocked many of the Kings that were
present. They thought those two women were Han Sen’s friends, but
she had suggested something very different.</p>
<p>They started to believe the women were being held hostage by a
demon. It made people’s blood boil. They wanted to save the
beautiful women.</p>
