    <p>
      They waited the night out together, and on the next day, they returned to
      Devil-Blood Shelter. But this time, they approached from another side and
      looked for the perfect opportunity to draw out more super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang had only one more vial of Angel Gene Fluid left, so he&#8217;d
      have to use it sparingly. Therefore, Han Sen opted for a more careful
      route this time, and only aimed to attract one or two powerful super
      creatures. In the meantime, Wang Yuhang would be sidelined a good distance
      away, ready for the pull, lest his poor luck ruin Han Sen&#8217;s
      precision.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, any idea on how I can draw them out?&#8221; Han Sen
      crouched low behind a rock, pointing towards a creature that stood along
      the ramparts of Devil-Blood Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used his devil-eye mask to get a proper look at it. The super
      creature had the strongest lifeforce he had seen yet, and it could very
      well have been a second-generation super creature. It was quite far from
      him, but he didn&#8217;t dare get any closer. The limited range was what
      made his dongxuan aura ineffective.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;And for what reason would you select that brute? Why not the
      golem?&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked, looking at the super creature with a
      confused expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      The super creature was a silver-white ape. It was a three-meter-tall beast
      with silver fur. Its muscles were pronounced, glistening like brushed
      steel. It looked tremendously powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, its body looked clumsy. It moved quickly, with shining
      eyes. And the ears were weirdly curled, like snails.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have a feeling it will drop us a beast soul.&#8221; Han Sen
      laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;And might you explain to me how you are able to deduce such a
      thing?&#8221; Wang Yuhang balked, with his eyes wide open. The silver ape
      didn&#8217;t look as if it would drop a beast soul, no matter which way he
      viewed it.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you have any ideas or not?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;To attract Brutus? That shan&#8217;t be a problem.&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang looked around and nodded an affirmative.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In that case, I will leave it to you.&#8221; Han Sen, with the
      silver fox in tow, sneaked away in preparation for their cooperative
      action.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang did not use an arrow this time. Instead, he merely came out
      from the behind the rocks and shouted in the direction of Devil-Blood
      Shelter, &#8220;You there, monkey boy! Over here!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      His call garnered much attention, and the silver-ape looked over in his
      direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang reached out his arm and presented a fist. Slowly, he lifted
      his middle finger. In the next second, the thumping of a chest and a
      frightening roar sounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver-ape cried out to the sky, and the dragon joined in. Next the
      golem did, too. They all screamed at their latest intruder with bloodlust.
      And then there were more.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh my days! This is far too much!&#8221; Wang Yuhang was shocked by
      the sudden additions to his fan club, and he wasted no time in running
      away. His stinginess was not an issue this time, either, and so he
      injected himself with the Angel Gene Fluid immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw ten super creatures chasing after Wang Yuhang, and it shocked
      even him. His eyes stared at his fleeing companion with wide eyes, unsure
      of whether or not the two would survive whatever battle was about to
      occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen followed after them in the shadows, and the ten creatures were
      determined to chase down the rat that was Wang Yuhang. If he needed
      saving, Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure he could do anything for the little
      uncle this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even Wang Yuhang knew this was too much. With the boons and bonus effects
      granted by the Angel Gene Fluid, he did not stop running. And as great as
      his initial advantage was, nothing he did nor anywhere he went shook loose
      his tail.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Wang Yuhang was in genuine danger, he would not shout. He knew doing
      so would be pointless, and he was aware Han Sen was in the vicinity,
      regardless. He believed shouting would only distract Han Sen and delay his
      own rescue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen followed the pursuit for a while, but soon came to the realization
      he&#8217;d get nowhere by merely continuing to follow. There was no chance
      for Han Sen to save Wang Yuhang, and there was no possible way he could
      tackle so many super creatures, all at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as he watched them go, running off as they did, Han Sen suddenly had
      an idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;So many super creatures have run out, the shelter must be empty!
      Should I try to grab the spirit stone? If I nab Devil-Blood King&#8217;s
      spirit stone, this entire situation will resolve itself. If Devil-Blood
      King opts for suicide, the creatures will become nothing but sand,&#8221;
      Han Sen thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen bit down on his teeth and summoned Moment Queen. &#8220;Continue
      following him and ensure he draws them as far away as possible. If he
      looks as if he&#8217;s about to keel over and die, save him if you can.
      Try to the stop the monsters.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are going to Devil-Blood Shelter?&#8221; Moment Queen was quick
      to understand Han Sen&#8217;s plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s a chance, and I&#8217;m going to take it.&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s eyes told her of how sure he was of this plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then be careful. There are at least five more super creatures
      inside,&#8221; Moment Queen informed Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If there are five, I have a chance. I won&#8217;t have to defeat
      them, after all. All I have to do is grab that spirit stone.&#8221; Han
      Sen nodded reassuringly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen did not say anything further, and she simply took off after
      Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen&#8217;s teleportation abilities could save Wang Yuhang, if
      the need arose. If he sent Little Angel, the same could not be said. Even
      though Han Sen needed Moment Queen with him, he still sent her to
      safeguard Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the creatures returned to the shelter, Moment Queen could use her speed
      to kite them away again and guarantee Han Sen the time he would need.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen turned around and ran towards the shelter. He didn&#8217;t rush
      inside immediately, however. He used telepathy to communicate with Moment
      Queen, so he could get a clearer grasp on the situation with Wang Yuhang
      while he was away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally, there was a finite range in which the super creatures would
      follow. They wouldn&#8217;t pursue a random trespasser to the ends of the
      world, as they were bound to a shelter. But of course, Wang Yuhang was
      Wang Yuhang, and he had led them for far longer than he should have had
      to. Two hours later, he was still leading them on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was injured, and the Angel Gene Fluid would soon run out. It
      was a miracle he hadn&#8217;t died yet, being chased by ten super
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen is going to get me killed!&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s
      spirit had been drained of hope. Seeing all the creatures still chasing
      him, he closed his eyes and readied himself for death.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, he was lifted up by an unseen force with great haste. He evaded
      every super creature&#8217;s attack and all of a sudden, found himself at
      a great distance away from his aggressors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was delighted at this sudden happening, and when he looked up,
      he saw Moment Queen had picked him up by his clothes.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Continue inspiring their ire,&#8221; Moment Queen coldly said.</p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang had snapped out of his death-ready daze, and in Moment
      Queen&#8217;s arms, he turned and shouted towards the creatures,
      &#8220;You turtles! Come and get me; I&#8217;m right here. Come and get
      your Wang Piñata.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen finally arrived in front of the shelter he sought to infiltrate.
      Like an arrow, he went straight inside, unwavering.
