<p>“Hm, where did they go?” Qin Xiu looked at Sky King with an
unhappy gaze. He was more than glum.</p>
<p>Sky King’s heart jumped. The spirit mirror began to display
strange changes. They were no longer in Burning Red Sky. They were
actually in another sky.</p>
<p>He finally saw Han Sen, who had just combined with the woman.
His body broke space and started to soar through many skies. He was
racing through the 33 skies.</p>
<p>The barriers that separated the 33 skies no longer seemed to
exist. They were unable to stop the penetration of that scary
body.</p>
<p>Within a moment, Han Sen and Wan’er’s combined body came before
the geno tablet of the 33 skies. He used his body to pass the 33rd
sky. Even the leader in the 33rd sky could not do something like
that.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was in front of the geno tablet. He looked at the
transparent body that had been breaking through space to get there.
He was trying to find out which of the two souls belonged to
Wan’er.</p>
<p>“Qin Xiu.” A transparent body came before Qin Xiu. It appeared
and quickly disappeared. It was similar to a flickering light. It
was like it was going to be extinguished yet remain gone
forever.</p>
<p>“Wan’er, please speak to me! It pains me to see you endure all
this!” Qin Xiu looked at the body and asked, “Wan’er? Oh, Wan’er?
Are you still there?”</p>
<p>“I… I am…” The transparent body seemed to be wrestling with
pain. It held its hair and roared. It was going crazy. It threw its
fist into the sky.</p>
<p>A transparent power exploded in the air. It turned into an
invisible shockwave, and it was spreading everywhere. It was
destroying everything, including the life souls.</p>
<p>Sky King was the first to be affected by the power. With his
nearly 100% Break World rate, not even he was able to withstand
that power. His body was ripped to pieces. He was going to vanish
alongside his soul.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Qin Xiu stepped away. The black crystal armor swiftly clad him
as he appeared before Sky King. A hand reached out. It was like an
invisible wall was coming out of his hands to block the
shockwave.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s will started to control the combined body. He saw Qin
Xiu and did not hesitate. He threw a punch forward.</p>
<p>An invisible power teleported in front of Qin Xiu. The fist
struck Qin Xiu’s black crystal armor, making his body slide
away.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s face changed. Ever since he had successfully
controlled the black crystal armor, he had never been able to feel
what it was like for a damaging power to touch him. The strength of
Han Sen and Wan’er combined surprised him.</p>
<p>Before Qin Xiu was able to do anything, Han Sen waved his hand
and attacked. He felt as if his entire body was brimming with
explosive power. It was like one punch was enough to break the sky
and the earth.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu froze. He moved his hand and blocked Han Sen’s own.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was like a killing machine. He looked at Qin Xiu
and used a crazy storm-style attack. Almost every part of his body
could do incredible damage, including his finger, hand, fist,
elbow, and knees.</p>
<p>Any one of those attacks was able to destroy an average God
Spirit elite, but these attacks were still able to be blocked by
Qin Xiu’s hands. His hands were like a wall that was unable to be
broken. No matter how strong Han Sen’s attacks were, they were
insufficient in making him fall back.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu, however, could only defend and not attack. Even so, it
gave him the chance to watch Han Sen. Because his body was not
entirely Han Sen since Wan’er was still somewhere inside, Qin Xiu
did not want to attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen, on the other hand, did not care. He felt his body power
was exploding. He was like a volcano that could erupt at any
second. If he did not release the power he had now, he felt as if
he was going to blow up.</p>
<p>Plus, he was starting to feel as if there was a power
encouraging him. It made him really want to break the black crystal
armor. It was like a moth drawn to a fire.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu kept blocking Han Sen’s attacks and coldly said, “Han
Sen, leave Wan’er’s body alone, and I will permit you to live.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything in response. He felt as if the
power that came from his body was enough to melt his own body. He
had to keep going. He had to keep fighting so that he could release
the power and make his body feel better.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>He landed another punch on Qin Xiu’s hand. This time, the power
sent Qin Xiu back half a step. The black crystal armor developed a
swirl on it.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu frowned. The power of Han Sen and Wan’er combined was
already greater than he expected it to be.</p>
<p>When Han Sen attacked again, Qin Xiu moved. He evaded Han Sen’s
fist and appeared behind him. He grabbed Han Sen by the neck with
his arms. He used a scary power to immobilize Han Sen’s body. His
foe was unable to move.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was behind Han Sen, coldly talking to him. “I demand
that you leave Wan’er’s body now! This is the last chance I am
willing to give you. Otherwise, I will end your life.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen’s body flashed away. He vanished from the
area, which resulted in Qin Xiu’s power being thrown wide.</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s body appeared again, he was above Qin Xiu’s head.
His legs were like a battleax striking down.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu raised his hands to block Han Sen’s strike. A scary
power created a swirl in space. The universal cogwheels were broken
by the destruction.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body kept flickering. When he vanished, Qin Xiu’s
power could no longer lock onto him. The two of them fought like
mad. The 33 skies kept shaking.</p>
<p>Aside from the geno tablet, there were no substances that could
withstand their attacks.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Qin Xiu’s power was scary, but he did not expect
him to be that terrifying. He and Wan’er had combined. The power
that exploded was greater than what he had. Qin Xiu still seemed
fine dealing with it though.</p>
<p>Han Sen even found himself thinking that if it was not for Qin
Xiu’s fear concerning Wan’er’s welfare, his situation would have
been much worse.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen did not know Qin Xiu was actually feeling more
shocked than he was.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was strong, but the reason he was so strong was because
of the black crystal armor.</p>
<p>The combined body of Han Sen and Wan’er was just pure body
power, and it was now fighting him. Qin Xiu understood that when he
was at his strongest, he could not be like that.</p>
<p>“This kind of body power is able to make the first step by using
the body.” Qin Xiu’s eyes looked cold.</p>
<p>If that power belonged to Wan’er, Qin Xiu was willing to give
up. He would have done anything to help Qin Wan’er.</p>
<p>Now, half of the power belonged to Han Sen, who had asserted
control of the body. When Qin Xiu thought of that, his eyes turned
even colder.</p>
