<h2>The Kings Break Godlight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1882</h3>

<p>Han Sen kept swinging his Knife Blank, as if he was mowing down
swathes of grass. He cut down endless numbers of Purgatory Beasts
and the ghoulish arms.</p>
<p>“Little Han, what are you using? That is exceptionally good.”
Wang Yuhang’s mouth hung wide open.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. It might be useful right now, but it is difficult
to tell how well it will fare if higher-level Purgatory Beasts rear
their heads. Come on, let’s run.” Han Sen led everyone towards the
hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the Knife Blank did not possess special powers.
After all, it was simply the child of a knife, and it wasn’t an
actual knife. Its spirit was still weak, and it was still
growing.</p>
<p>But that Knife Blank could very well be deified. That was
because only items and weaponry of the same tier could defeat the
Purgatory Beasts. That was how he was able to defeat the creatures
and the arms.</p>
<p>Han Sen still had to decide how hard he wished to hit each
creature he came against, though.</p>
<p>Black Hell Cow’s power was equivalent to that of a Viscount. Han
Sen was able to kill their current enemies, but if they came up
against something of an even higher level, it was likely he’d end
up performing like Han Meng’er and Spell had. He’d only be able to
stagger the fiends, and not do any proper damage.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked near Guna and Guya. They went at a meandering
pace, so Han Sen went forward with Knife Blank. He killed
everything he could see in his path. From arms to two-headed beasts
to Black Hell Cows. Everything was slaughtered, and it allowed Guya
and Guna to move at a faster pace.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before they arrived at the hall they wished to go
to. When they got there, though, the situation gave them quite the
shock. The hall had fallen. The gold Gana Goddess statue was still
glowing, though, bathing the area in a light that forbade the entry
of beasts and phantom arms.</p>
<p>But inside the hall, Han Sen saw six shadows. They were the King
class elites that had previously escaped. Gold Jade King was there,
too.</p>
<p>“I thought they ran off. Why have they come back?” Han Sen
looked at them with surprise.</p>
<p>Guya said coldly, “They thought that since Purgatory Heaven does
not have a deified elite to control it, they could escape before it
was activated. Clearly, they miscalculated.”</p>
<p>Han Sen could guess this. After they left, they had hoped to
escape the entire planet. Unfortunately, they could not. So, they
had tried to destroy Purgatory Heaven.</p>
<p>Han Sen had left the place before then, so he hadn’t seen them
return.</p>
<p>The six Kings were carrying with them a strange array of powers.
The use of those powers seemed to be twisting and distorting the
very dimension. They were doing their best to get close to the
statue.</p>
<p>Gold Jade King’s hand gripped a sword that looked very sovereign
and prim. The sword was being thrust at the Goddess statue. Gold
Jade King wielded it with finesse. It looked as if it could sever
the atmosphere at any moment, but whenever it came within two
meters of the statue, its approach was stalled. It became extremely
slow, and no amount of effort could move it closer.</p>
<p>The Gana Goddess’ gold light became solid. The powerful weaponry
and powers wielded against it could not defy that tangible light.
Nothing was even able to scrape the statue.</p>
<p>Gold Jade King wasn’t the only one suffering this suppression,
either. The same thing was happening to the other Kings there, as
well.</p>
<p>A beast King was trying to bite it in the air. The creature’s
fangs had the power to crush mighty objects, and it looked likely
to break the statue with its maw. But it was ultimately unable to,
as its bite was stopped two meters away. It did not matter how hard
it tried, its power wasn’t sufficient to deliver the attack.</p>
<p>A giant-looking King was holding a mighty hammer. The hammer was
coming down on the statue. Every swing broke the air, but it could
not break the statue. It never got closer than two meters from
it.</p>
<p>Amidst those six Kings, Han Sen saw a bald monk. He wore monkish
garb, like a robe. He struck the statue with the shadow of a
buddha.</p>
<p>The same thing occurred to the monk as it did the other Kings,
too. The godlight could not be broken.</p>
<p>The six wielded an extreme amount of strength. Together, they
kept pounding on the statue. If it was a planet they were striking,
it would have exploded many times over.</p>
<p>If they were unable to break the Goddess statue’s godlight, the
power gap between a deified being and a King must have been rather
large.</p>
<p>“What about the Nobles in the hall?” Han Sen looked around.
Aside from the six Kings attacking the statue, they were all
gone.</p>
<p>Guya said, “Where the statue shines, there won’t be any
Purgatory Beasts and hellish hands. Ordinary people cannot
withstand basking in that light for too long, though. I can only
assume they were blasted and dragged into purgatory that way.”</p>
<p>“Guna, is there a way to stop Purgatory Heaven?” Han Sen asked
Guna.</p>
<p>Guna looked at the statue and the elites, and she said, “I want
to sacrifice myself, and hopefully obtain control of it that way.
Then, I can ensure Guya gets out of Purgatory Heaven. In attacking
the statue, however, they have increased its power output. Even if
I do sacrifice myself, doing so now would be useless.”</p>
<p>“You are so cruel! You only want to have Guya escape this place,
while everyone else is left behind?” Wang Yuhang was so mad!”</p>
<p>You guys are not nice. Whoever comes here has a reason to do so.
They want to use us,” Guna hummed.</p>
<p>This is not the time to talk about this, so let me ask again: do
you have a way?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“No! The statue has been activated. Not even a King can get
close to it. Unless someone deified is here, we will all die,” Guna
said.</p>
<p>“Is there no other way?” Han Sen asked, as he looked at the
statue.</p>
<p>Guna hummed and said, “Yes. The other way is what the Kings are
attempting. Break the godlight and take control of Purgatory Heaven
the hard way; only then can you stop it.”</p>
<p>“How do I control it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It is difficult to control Purgatory Heaven if you don’t have
the blood of the Gana. The same would apply even if you were
deified. But underneath the statue, there is a crack. You can
escape Purgatory Heaven that way. That is what they planned to do,
but they underestimated its power,” Guna said, while pointing at
the statue.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked in the direction she pointed to. The end of the
statue’s tail did indeed possess a tear in the fabric of space.
There was a long mark there.</p>
<p>“That mark is where our deified elites fought their enemies.
After a million years, it has yet to heal. That is why there is
such a blatant flaw. Unfortunately, only deified elites can make
use of it. King class elites cannot, so we most certainly can’t,”
Guya said.</p>
