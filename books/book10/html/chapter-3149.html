<p>“Why did you leave the God Chaos Party?” Han Sen asked with
surprise.</p>
<p>“Although the legends claim the leader was not killed, he never
showed up again. Now, the God Chaos Party is being run by one of
the vice presidents. I had a conflict with him, so…” The big sky
demon did not finish, but it was understandable.</p>
<p>The big sky demon put her lips next to Han Sen’s ear and
seductively whispered, “Who is the vice president? I cannot tell
you that unless you truly are my lover.” The Han Sen did not move.
“You already argued with the God Chaos Party. Why would you
maintain their secrets?”.</p>
<p>The big sky demon pushed herself up against Han Sen’s chest and
said, “The legends claim the leader is still alive. I don’t know if
that is true. If he comes back one day, I will have to keep myself
alive, right?”</p>
<p>“In that case, you should just leave,” Han Sen said without
moving. “You are here. If the people from the God Chaos Party come,
they are going to think I am with you.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how much of a risk I have taken for you?” The big
sky demon rolled her eyes angrily at Han Sen. She went on to say,
“But you are my favorite little lover. No matter what it costs, I
will refuse to sit idly by and watch you get killed. So, I have
thought of a way that you will not be pursued by the God Chaos
Party, and you can make the God Chaos Party never come looking for
you and trouble.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the big sky demon and asked, “Oh? How is
that?”</p>
<p>“It is very simple,” big sky demon seductively said. “Just
become my student, and I will protect you.”</p>
<p>“What is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen could guess what she
was alluding to, but he had to confirm it to be sure.</p>
<p>“It is like other humans getting a God Spirit to give them a
Blood-Pulse,” big sky demon said with seriousness. “I can give you
the big sky demon Blood – Pulse.”</p>
<p>“You have a god temple?” Han Sen looked at the big sky demon
with surprise.</p>
<p>“Of course,” the big sky demon said with a roll of her eyes.</p>
<p>“Where is your god temple? You are a gene race. Even if you
consumed a God Spirit Blood-Pulse to become a God Spirit gene race,
you still can’t have a god temple.” Han Sen was very confused. Han
Sen had been shocked about Decapitation Queen having her own god
temple. He did not expect the big sky demon could have one too. If
the members of God Chaos Party each had a god temple, that would be
scary.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder the God Chaos Party was able to kill God
Spirits,” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>Big sky demon smiled, “I know where my god temple comes from.
You do not need to care about that. Are you going to join me or
not?”</p>
<p>“Of course… Not…” Han Sen rejected her offer. He also thought,
“It looks like big sky demon does not know I have the God of Wealth
Temple, but she knows I was able to kill Decapitation Queen. All of
that happened almost together. How does she not know about the God
of Wealth Temple?”</p>
<p>“When the God Chaos Party people come and you seek my safety,
finding me won’t be so easy,” the sky demon said. Then, she
disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to ask her about the God Chaos Party some more,
but big sky demon was already gone.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to wait until the god fights began. Suddenly,
someone came to the team of big dragon riders and delivered an
urgent message from Qin Bai. Qin Bai said he was in trouble, and he
asked Han Sen to go and help him immediately or he would end up
dead.</p>
<p>The messenger did not know the specifics of the trouble Qin Bai
was in. He only said Crown Prince Qin Bai needed Han Sen to return
with all haste. If he was slow, things were sure to turn out
bad.</p>
<p>Han Sen was confused. He did not know what sort of trouble Qin
Bai was in, but Qin Bai’s letter sounded extremely serious. So, he
hurried back to Jade Wall City. “Han Sen, you have to save me!
Otherwise, I am going to die!” When Crown Prince Qin Bai saw Han
Sen, it was like he was seeing Jesus in the flesh. He ran at him.
He looked terrible and almost cried.</p>
<p>Han Sen held Qin Bai as he said, “Crown Prince, chill out first.
Tell me what happened to you.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked as if he was in pain. He said, “Teacher Jia is
back.”</p>
<p>“Who is Teacher Jia? What does that have to do with you?” Han
Sen asked with confusion.</p>
<p>Qin Bai anxiously replied, “Teacher Jia teaches me to combat. He
was an ambassador to the Qi Kingdom until only recently. He has
been away for a few years. Now that he is back, and he has seen my
homework, he is furious. He gave me a sword skill and told me to
learn it in seven days. If I don’t do it, he will punish me.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Han Sen was frozen. This extremely spoiled
crown prince was able to be scared by someone like that. He was
curious about what this Teacher Jia was truly like.</p>
<p>Qin Bai had also made him come back in such a rush for a matter
that was rather trivial. Han Sen did not know if he could join the
god fights now, and that made him want to cry. Han Sen could not be
bothered scolding him, so he just said, “You are the crown prince.
Even if you can’t learn it, can he really do something to you?”</p>
<p>Qin Bai hurriedly said, “You do not understand. Teacher Jia is a
good friend of my father. He is a very cold-blooded man. It’s not
just to me. He even beats my father. If he can do that, he will be
extra mean to me. This one time, when I couldn’t hand in my
homework, he beat me. My ass was in such poor condition that I
couldn’t even lie down on a bed for a few days. Then, he left for
the Qi Kingdom. He was there for a few years, so I never thought he
would return. Who would have known…” After saying that, Qin Bai’s
face looked like he was in pain. He was really scared of Teacher
Jia.</p>
<p>“What sword skill did Teacher Jia want you to learn?” Han Sen
asked with curiosity. Qin Bai took out a fist-sized scroll and
said, “He has made me practice a skill called Wavy Sword Skill.
This sword skill needs to be combined with a water element gene
race to practice. Teacher Jia gave me a water element god-class
gene race called a nine-wave fish. He made me combine with the
nine-wave fish, expecting me to get good with it in seven days. He
also wants me to be able to cast Wavy Sword Skill… That is killing
me. A god-class gene race combination is hard enough to control,
but he wants me to practice that in seven days. It is impossible… I
think… Teacher Jia is just looking for an excuse to beat me
up.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai begged Han Sen, “Han Sen, you are very good at finding
your way out of trouble. Please, find a way to save me. I don’t
want Teacher Jia to break my ass.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “You are just a kid. Controlling a god-class
gene race is a lot to ask of you. Learning how to practice with one
in seven days is impossible.”</p>
<p>“I know, right?” Qin Bai nodded.</p>
<p>“That does not mean it is impossible,” Han Sen said in a very
chill manner. “I have a way. I can help you practice the nine-wave
fish quickly. In seven days, you will be able to cast the Wavy
Sword Skill.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai was surprised, so he asked, “Really? What way would that
be? Is it hard? If it is too hard, I can’t do it.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it is real,” Han Sen said with a smile. “It is not
hard either. You just need to know how to play it, and then you can
do it.”</p>
<p>“I am very good at playing. Please tell me, how do I play?” Qin
Bai looked both surprised and happy.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Crown Prince. Allow me to introduce you to my daughter
Han Bao’er.” Han Sen smiled at Bao’er and introduced her to Qin
Bai.</p>
