<p>Han Sen was frozen as he watched Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng’s
bodies becoming one. The process was pretty much like how Han Sen
could combine himself with Little Angel.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen combined with Little Angel, Han Sen’s body was
the primary controller. Little Angel was secondary.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng were equals. They completed each
other.</p>
<p>Before, whenever Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian
Moon, he had always thought they were so pretty that any man could
fall for them. Even Han Sen caught himself watching them, now and
again. After all, everyone liked to admire pretty women.</p>
<p>When Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon completed themselves, Han Sen
no longer felt as if he was looking at a human. The beauty of the
being that emerged was unearthly. A sword fairy stood in front of
him; she was so pretty that she no longer looked like something
that belonged in this world.</p>
<p>The black hair spilled down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes
were like pools of black water. It looked as if she could see into
the bottom of a person’s heart with a mere glance. She could look
so deeply into a person that it was almost frightening.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a single blemish on her face, and every inch of it
was amazing. If people saw her, they would feel ashamed simply for
being in her presence. They would deem themselves unworthy.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng was beautiful, but she never used her looks to put
pressure on other people. This person now, though, was different.
Her divine beauty was naturally suffocating.</p>
<p>Of course, the most oppressive thing about her wasn’t just her
looks—it was her scary swordmind.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he was very good at sword skills. His swordmind
could compete with the swordmind of a deified being, after all. But
this woman’s swordmind made Han Sen’s swordmind look dim by
comparison. It was like comparing a firefly to a bright moon.</p>
<p>“It is a perfect sword fairy,” Han Sen thought, despite the fact
that she was holding a white paper umbrella instead of a sword.</p>
<p>“Do you know what I want to do now?” Suddenly, Elysian Moon and
Gu Qingcheng spoke to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What would you like to do?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Kill you,” the woman said as she looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Stop joking around,” Han Sen said. Although he was pretty sure
she wasn’t serious, he couldn’t actually discern her emotions or
gauge how she was feeling. Regardless, she did have a proud look
about her. Han Sen had never witnessed that level of pride before.
She was like some goddess perched in a lofty realm, despising the
commoners beneath her. Or anyone who was not worthy of being in her
presence.</p>
<p>The woman shook her head and seriously said, “I’m not joking. I
really want to kill you. Not just you. I want to kill every living
creature in this world. You are all so ugly in my eyes. You are all
so imperfect. I cannot accept these imperfections I am forced to
witness. I have held it in for so long; stopping myself from
killing people.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at her with shock. He realized that she wasn’t
joking. Right now, he was in trouble.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The woman’s body suddenly split in two. Elysian Moon and Gu
Qingcheng splintered into their separate bodies again. They looked
very pale and ill.</p>
<p>“Now you know why you must kill one of us and keep our
personalities uncombined. If we are one, things will end up that
way. We will have a personality that is untouchable and entirely
ruthless. That personality is obsessed with perfection, and it will
seek out and destroy all it deems imperfect. We combine very well,
but there are dark thoughts deep within our genes that are brought
to the surface. We can suppress the slaughterous desires for the
moment, but we have no idea what the future may bring,” Gu
Qingcheng said.</p>
<p>“So, if only one personality is alive, we won’t have this
problem?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon nodded. They didn’t want to become
murderous perfectionists. Even if it guaranteed survival, that
wasn’t a life that they wanted to lead. They would become a demon
that sought the destruction of pretty much everything. The rest of
their lives would be one of battle.</p>
<p>“What kind of sword fairy is this? It’s just an evil
swordswoman.” Han Sen had a wry smile.</p>
<p>Looking at Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng, Han Sen knew he was in
trouble. When they combined, they didn’t just have an ugly
seek-and-destroy heart: they had a terrifying level of talent that
could probably make their sordid wishes come true.</p>
<p>After they combined, they were still King class. But after
getting a good look at their willpower, it was easy to guess they
would one day become deified. At that point, they would become even
more frightening.</p>
<p>Both Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were supremely talented. Even
more frightening, they both had super god bodies. When those
combined, they would be even more perfect than they were now.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know how the two super god bodies might exist
together, but anything was possible.</p>
<p>Regardless of how exactly the combination happened, their
talents would make them scarier than any human or spirit that
existed. That was an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>“After you guys combine, will you two still have your super god
bodies?” Han Sen asked the pair.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon nodded. They didn’t speak, but Han
Sen knew how scary the confirmation was.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon looked at Han Sen and said, “I’m sure you
understand the gravity of the situation now. If we don’t combine,
we will die. We estimate we will live no longer than another year.
But if we do agree on a combination, the result still isn’t a good
one. We might not die, but many others would. We have killed
before, but we find the thought of such a pointless, murderous
existence to be abhorrent. We don’t want a life based on
killing.”</p>
<p>“Maybe that won’t happen. Maybe when you do fully combine, that
desire to kill will disappear.” Han Sen tried to offer them
comforting words.</p>
<p>“That is impossible,” Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng said at the
same time.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, and then Elysian Moon said, “We want
to live, but we don’t want to become someone like that. So, only
one of us can be permitted to live. If a winner doesn’t come about
through our battles, then we will allow you to decide. With your
involvement, one of us is sure to be a clear victor. You should
decide which of us should live.”</p>
<p>Han Sen sat in his chair, unmoving. He hadn’t expected Elysian
Moon to say something like this. He was closer to Gu Qingcheng,
though. He knew that deep inside of himself, some part of him
wished for her to be the one who would live.</p>
<p>But Elysian Moon wasn’t his enemy. He didn’t want her to
die.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng. Gu Qingcheng nodded. Sadly, he
said, “Why do you have to make me decide this?”</p>
<p>“Because you are the only one capable of killing us, even if we
want to fight back. So, this is a decision only you can make,”
Elysian Moon said emotionlessly. She said it as if this was none of
her business, like she was reading the headline of a particularly
boring newspaper.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a headache coming on. He was very strong, even
here. In the sanctuaries, he was more like a god. It turned out,
however, that there were problems even a god couldn’t solve.</p>
<p>“This is harder than choosing between a mother and wife who have
fallen into a stream. It is too fucking hard.” Han Sen couldn’t
help but swear.</p>
<p>He wasn’t just deciding who to save. He was deciding who to
murder.</p>
