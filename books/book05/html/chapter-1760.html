<h2>Golden Growler Evolves</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1760</h3>

<p>Xina flew a few thousand meters away, and she didn’t stop in her
ascent She lowered her head and suddenly looked very shocked.</p>
<p>There was not even enough time for her to scream as the holy
light gleamed in her frightened eyes. It had pierced right through
her body.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>It was like a firework in the dark. The bone arrow punched
through Xina’s strong Viscount body, and a second later, she turned
to dust. There wasn’t a single fragment of bone left for
retrieval.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Viscount hunted: Gold Feather Witch.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the announcement play, but he didn’t hear anything
about xenogeneic genes. The bone arrow was too strong, that much
was dear. Her xenogeneic genes had been ruined by the wretched
power, leaving nothing behind</p>
<p>After shooting Xina, the Archangel Bone Arrow flew back to Han
Sen and floated in front of him. It was glowing with holy light, as
if it was awaiting a master’s acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Han Sen was feeling weak right now, though, and he had to exit
super king spirit mode. When he did, his body returned to
normal.</p>
<p>When his body returned to normal, the bone arrow stopped
shining. It fell back down onto the lotus. Now it was just like a
normal arrow. It lost the strength it had previously displayed.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew he could only control the bone arrow in super king
spirit mode. In his normal form, he couldn’t do anything to prompt
an awakening.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen picked up the arrow and walked around. There was not
a single soul living across the lotus, and Ghost Eye was almost out
of breath.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked over to it and gave it a poke with his bone
arrow. A fist-sized green crystal came out of the rotten eyeball.
“Xenogeneic Viscount hunted; xenogeneic gene found: Ghost Eye
Beast.”</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up the green crystal and walked towards Lone
Wolf. He picked up the xenogeneic genes and tossed their bodies
down into the black pit.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the bone arrow to tear into the lotus. He managed
to dig up thirteen crystal lotus seeds. They were each about the
height of a person, so he moved them to the sanctuary and left the
hole.</p>
<p>The lotus died pretty quickly after losing all its seeds, and it
fell down into the bottomless pit. A day later, word was received
that the hole had collapsed, sealing itself off completely. That
surprised Han Sen, and it saved him much trouble.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger called Han Sen, and he was surprised to learn that
he was still alive.</p>
<p>Han Sen told him he didn’t go down too deep, and that he exited
long before whatever disaster had happened. He said he had no clue
what might have happened down there. Mister Tiger was confused by
this, but he didn’t ask anything else. So, Han Sen buried what had
happened as deep as he could. He wanted to avoid the chance of
someone learning what he had done and trying to kill him for his
actions.</p>
<p>Han Sen spent the next few days investigating his body. His
super king spirit was now called super god spirit. And aside from
that, there did not seem to be any grand changes.</p>
<p>But his body had most certainly changed quite a bit. His super
god spirit still had its indestructible status, and beyond that, no
normal power could hurt him. He really was like a god that could
not be harmed.</p>
<p>When he used his super god spirit, Han Sen could activate the
bone arrow’s power. That was most certainly not a coincidence. He
did not know the extent of super god spirit’s actual power, though.
He wanted to give it a test, but after transforming, it only lasted
a few seconds. And it drained him of energy after use, costing him
way too much for casual activation.</p>
<p>The Viscount xenogeneic gene material from Ghost Eye was placed
into a pot. The green crystal, just like the bone he had eaten
previously, melted into a stew after an overnight boil.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he might be able to obtain Viscount genes, but
after having a sip, all he received was an additional Baron
gene.</p>
<p>Still, after Han Sen drank the last of the xenogeneic broth, he
had received an additional nine Baron genes. Not a single Viscount
gene was obtained.</p>
<p>The Baron genes still aided in making his body stronger, though.
It especially improved his eyes, and he could see much clearer now.
His vision in the dark had greatly increased.</p>
<p>The bone from the Lone Wolf was something the silver fox seemed
to like, and the little creature enjoyed chewing it and rubbing it.
So, Han Sen gifted it to the thing.</p>
<p>“Using high class genes will increase a lot of Baron genes, it
would seem. But it doesn’t look like you can skip a tier and start
upping those points right away. That means that if I kill a few
more Viscounts, maxing out my Baron tally shouldn’t take too long,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Killing Baron xenogeneics did not satisfy Han Sen’s needs.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if the Feathers would be disturbed by the
disappearance of Xina and Lone Wolf, but after that day, many
different races came to inspect the site of the hole. Many Feathers
did indeed come to the city.</p>
<p>But everyone was clueless about the events that had transpired
down there. And no one would ever suspect Xina could have been
killed by a commoner like Han Sen. No one thought he was a
suspicious fellow.</p>
<p>The city wasn’t safe, but at least Wizard could return to normal
operational status. Qiao accepted a few missions and brought Han
Sen along to slay a few xenogeneics. They managed to get Wizard
back on the right track.</p>
<p>After a while, Third Master appeared again. They established a
time in which Han Sen could teach the man a few techniques.</p>
<p>Third Master did indeed offer a high payment for the services,
and money was something in short supply for Han Sen. It was the
perfect opportunity, really.</p>
<p>Aside from the things that Qiao needed herself, Han Sen bought
all the ingredients that they found during their escapades. He ate
some, and he also gave some to Little Angel and Golden Growler.</p>
<p>He was still wondering how he might make use of the thirteen
magnet fruits, though.</p>
<p>The legends said that after a commoner ate one, their geno armor
would evolve a second time. They’d become a Noble or xenogeneic,
right away.</p>
<p>That was an over-powered effect, for sure. A commoner with geno
armor was a person with no hope. Only Nobles and xenogeneics could
expect to grow.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if he’d be affected by eating one, as his
Spell geno armor hadn’t evolved a second time. It was just a geno
armor, though, and if he knew the fruit would work, he’d eat
one.</p>
<p>After Golden Growler gobbled down a few more xenogeneic genes,
though, his body started to evolve and he started to generate his
own geno armor.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen brought him to Kate, just in case he was sent into
the Big Silence system once the armor was generated. “Please evolve
twice…” Han Sen thought, looking at Golden Growler as he generated
his armor.</p>
<p>Golden Growler was not like Han Sen, and if it didn’t work, Han
Sen could at least feed him a magnet fruit to see what might
happen.</p>
