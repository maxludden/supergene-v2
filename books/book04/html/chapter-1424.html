    <p>“D*mn you all!” Han Sen gritted his teeth.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen allowed the spirits to hear what Luo Lan said because he wished
      for them
    </p>
    <p>
      all to understand why he was going to annihilate them. He wanted them to
      know that
    </p>
    <p>what was coming was deserved.</p>
    <p>
      Although Luo Lan had not yet been hurt, it didn’t take much intellect to
      envision what
    </p>
    <p>might have happened to her if Han Sen hadn’t been able to come back.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen walked in front of No God Emperor, and as he did, everyone’s
      eyesight was
    </p>
    <p>returned. But they could not move and they could not speak.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen coldly told the emperor, “No God, damn you. For your latest
      transgression
    </p>
    <p>against humans, I’m going to kill you. Forever.”</p>
    <p>
      No God Emperor was given the ability to speak, but he balked in Han Sen’s
      face by
    </p>
    <p>
      saying, “So what if you kill me? I can respawn. I don’t think you can stay
      in the Third
    </p>
    <p>God’s Sanctuary for long. One of these days, I’ll kill them all.”</p>
    <p>
      No God Emperor rebuking Han Sen actually inspired the other spirits with
      more
    </p>
    <p>
      courage. It was true that Han Sen could not keep returning on a whim, and
      dead
    </p>
    <p>
      spirits didn’t stay dead as long as their spirit stones were fine. They
      had more
    </p>
    <p>chances in the future, that was for sure.</p>
    <p>
      “You’re telling me you’ll try this again? Is that right?” Han Sen coldly
      said. “Zero; do
    </p>
    <p>your thing.”</p>
    <p>
      Zero swung her Bone Dagger without being inhibited. She was targeting No
      God
    </p>
    <p>Emperor, whose movement had been restricted.</p>
    <p>
      The dagger punched neatly into the temple of his forehead, and after that
      occurred,
    </p>
    <p>No God Emperor’s face looked distraught.</p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      No God Emperor’s body shattered like glass, and so did his spirit stone,
      wherever it
    </p>
    <p>was.</p>
    <p>
      That newfound courage in the spirits dissipated, after that. They knew
      what had
    </p>
    <p>
      happened to No God Emperor, and they feared the same happening to them.
      They
    </p>
    <p>
      tried to suicide in an attempt to escape, but Han Sen had stolen their
      ability to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen walked before Ruin Emperor next, and then, he gestured for Zero to
      cut his
    </p>
    <p>entire head off. He wasn’t even given the opportunity to speak.</p>
    <p>
      One by one, Han Sen and Zero walked to each emperor spirit and had each of
      them
    </p>
    <p>beheaded. The terror of those in-line was tangible.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was planning to see to it that each spirit was killed, but the
      army was large,
    </p>
    <p>
      and he had little time left there. He could feel the tug of the portal
      beckoning his
    </p>
    <p>return to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>
    <p>
      Demi-Gods were not supposed to reside in the Third God’s Sanctuary, and it
      was
    </p>
    <p>
      actually dangerous for them to stay there long. He would have to take his
      leave very
    </p>
    <p>soon.</p>
    <p>
      And he now understood why Night Empress had to leave so swiftly. The
      pressure of
    </p>
    <p>
      keeping his stay in the Third God’s Sanctuary was slowly becoming
      unbearable, and
    </p>
    <p>
      it was highly likely that his body could be ruined by remaining there for
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll give the rest of you one last chance to make this work. If I need to
      come knocking
    </p>
    <p>
      again, I won’t be showing any mercy; and neither will there be any
      theatrics.” Han
    </p>
    <p>
      Sen gestured with his hand and made all the spirits explode. Those he did
      this to
    </p>
    <p>returned to their spirit stones to lick their wounds.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not kill any of the creatures there. His beef was with the
      spirits, more
    </p>
    <p>
      than anything, and he knew the rest of his companions could deal with the
      creatures
    </p>
    <p>just fine.</p>
    <p>
      He let loose his grip on them, and as soon as they regained control of
      their limbs, the
    </p>
    <p>
      creatures tried taking off. They scrambled as best they could to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were so frightened after what had happened. Creatures couldn’t
      respawn like
    </p>
    <p>
      spirits could, after all. They sure wished they could run faster, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person Han Sen had left alive was Sky King. He was planning on
    </p>
    <p>
      interrogating that sickly emperor, as there was much he wanted to learn
      before he
    </p>
    <p>departed.</p>
    <p>
      Qing Jun was his daughter, too; as much as Han Sen despised Sky King, he
      didn’t
    </p>
    <p>
      think it was very nice to have her father brutally murdered in front of
      her, deserving or
    </p>
    <p>no.</p>
    <p>
      “Demigods are so strong! Whoa, it looks like I should strive for a
      promotion.” Xie
    </p>
    <p>Qing King laughed.</p>
    <p>
      “Haha! If you’re interested, I can take you back with me. But… not
      ascending through
    </p>
    <p>
      the fires could inhibit you further down the line, and you may struggle.
      Becoming a
    </p>
    <p>god will later become extremely difficult,” Han Sen said.</p>
    <p>
      “Understood! From this point on, I will strive to become a demigod the
      proper way.
    </p>
    <p>Where’s the fun in taking a shortcut,” Xie Qing King said.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen asked Dry Bone King and Water Fairy, “I have explained the
      situation, but if
    </p>
    <p>
      you still want to come, you may. Does anyone want to become a demigod, any
      of
    </p>
    <p>you can come with me?”</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen expected some of them to return with him, but surprisingly, none
      chose to
    </p>
    <p>
      come. They all looked at each other, and despite wanting to become
      demigods, they
    </p>
    <p>
      all agreed that if they were to ascend, they should do it the proper way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Snowball, who was a bona fide wimp, did not fancy cutting any
      corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was an example to them all, too, he later realized. They had seen
      what Han
    </p>
    <p>
      Sen was capable of, and they wanted to replicate his success and strength.
      They
    </p>
    <p>wanted to follow in his footsteps and do things right.</p>
    <p>Han Sen rubbed his nose and shook his head and said, “I understand.”</p>
    <p>Luo Lan then walked up to Han Sen and provided him with a few items.</p>
    <p>
      She gave him the Cruel Bottle, and even Meowth. He hadn’t taken them with
      him
    </p>
    <p>
      when he ascended the Ten Steps of the Holy Door due to the added strain it
      would
    </p>
    <p>have posed. He was afraid the fire would have incinerated them.</p>
    <p>
      “Thank you. And now, Mom, I should go.” Han Sen’s body was having trouble
    </p>
    <p>
      remaining in the Third God’s Sanctuary. He placed Sky King inside the
      Cruel Bottle
    </p>
    <p>and began walking back.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could at least chat with his mother back in the Alliance whenever
      he wished
    </p>
    <p>to. There was no need to do it there.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen waved goodbye to everyone and then stepped back into the
      vortex-like
    </p>
    <p>portal that would take him back to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>
    <p>
      Inside the Cruel Bottle, Yaksha, Sky King, and even Meowth were all fine
      and safe
    </p>
    <p>during their transport.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was just going to treat Meowth like a pet, sort of like he always
      had. He
    </p>
    <p>wasn’t bringing it through to do any fighting.</p>
    <p>
      Many emperors had been slain in the Third God’s Sanctuary, and with the
      prospect
    </p>
    <p>
      of Han Sen possibly returning, none dared to attack the humans again. They
      could
    </p>
    <p>keep Sky Mountain.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen returned to the Alliance to be with Ji Yanran shortly after this
      escapade, as
    </p>
    <p>her due date was incredibly soon. He was very excited to have a son.</p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for him to do in the sanctuary right now, anyway. He
      could not
    </p>
    <p>
      take on super creatures, so the best thing he could do was train and
      practice, which
    </p>
    <p>he oftentimes did in the Alliance.</p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen and his wife had been taking good care of Ji Yanran during the
      time she
    </p>
    <p>had been pregnant and Han Sen had been absent. And while Luo Lan was</p>
    <p>
      overjoyed she’d soon have a grandson, Han Sen did not fully trust her with
      the ability
    </p>
    <p>of raising a kid.</p>
    <p>
      The next day, Ji Yanran was taken to the delivery room. Han Sen, Luo Lan,
      Ji
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruozhen, and his wife were all waiting outside, eagerly awaiting news.
