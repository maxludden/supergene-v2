<h2>Killing a God</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2822</h3>

<p>When the ash settled, Han Sen was instantly there. His body went
past the purple, evil spirit and came right before Evil Lotus
God.</p>
<p>“Death wish.” Evil Lotus God threw a punch at Han Sen. Suddenly,
there was a white flame coming from Han Sen’s hand. At the same
time, Evil Lotus God’s punch hit Han Sen, the white flame went
through Evil Lotus God’s chest.</p>
<p>“Phoenix flame… Phoenix feather… How could you…” Evil Lotus God
lowered his head to look at his chest. He saw a phoenix feather in
his chest. A white flame was madly surging through his body and
organs.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen did not let him speak. The moment he pulled out the
phoenix flame, he controlled Sky Vine Radish to punch the purple,
evil spirit, which was connected to Evil Lotus God. When Evil Lotus
God was damaged, he did not have the time to react. Sky Vine Radish
punched his head, unleashing purple air everywhere.</p>
<p>Half of Han Sen’s shoulder bones were broken by Evil Lotus God’s
punch, but Han Sen did not mind. When he was with Sky Vine Radish
working together, he was not going to give Evil Lotus God a
chance.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Evil Lotus God and the purple, evil spirit received a
double whammy of damage. His body was damaged, and it made Evil
Lotus God’s face immediately change.</p>
<p>Han Sen discovered that Evil Lotus God had a weak point that did
not really count as a weak point. His purple, evil spirit was not
able to affect creatures in the universe. When the evil spirit got
injured, Evil Lotus God’s body was also injured.</p>
<p>His body was like a normal creature that could be harmed by
universal powers. This meant that when Han Sen was fighting with
Sky Vine Radish, Evil Lotus God was taking double the damage.
Although his body was a true god class, it did not mean his battle
power was a true god class.</p>
<p>At least for Han Sen, Evil Lotus God used the purple, evil
spirit, which meant his body’s lifeforce was being reduced. When
the purple, evil spirit’s body got its god mark, his body received
even more cracks. It was like his body was going to collapse.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not expect the phoenix feather could heavily damage
the Evil Lotus God. In fact, the phoenix feather went through Evil
Lotus God’s body. Evil Lotus God’s power had become weaker because
of the negative effects that came from using the purple, evil
spirit.</p>
<p>For Han Sen, this was a situation that yielded quite the
advantage. If Evil Lotus God’s power kept staying at true god
class, the phoenix feather Han Sen held might not hurt him. Now, it
was different.</p>
<p>When the phoenix flame and Sky Vine Radish kept hitting, Evil
Lotus God kept screaming. God blood kept pouring out of him without
reprieve. Bao Ying and the others were watching in shock.</p>
<p>From what they saw, Han Sen was holding a white flame. He made
Evil Lotus God’s god blood spill, making it so he was unable to
fight back. It was very strong like a sky god landing on the
earth.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible… I am a God… I cannot be killed by a lowlife
creature… I cannot die… Hell no… Argh…” Evil Lotus God was unable
to finish his sentence. Han Sen cut off his left arm, making god
blood spill out of him and squirt everywhere like a bloody
spring.</p>
<p>“Damn you… I will cut you up into little pieces for this and
ensure you will never be reborn…” Evil Lotus God’s face was full of
anger. He put away the purple, evil spirit to look normal
again.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God’s purple, evil spirit was gone. Sky Vine Radish’s
power had returned to normal. Evil Lotus God’s body had obviously
improved. His face looked enraged. He gathered up power to continue
his fight with Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had another two compressed plastic bags ready to unload
their contents. A lot of pottery powder was unleashed. It went all
over Evil Lotus God’s body. It made his skin corrode like he was
drenched in acid that fizzed and bubbled across him. A big part of
Evil Lotus God’s body was being corroded away right there.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Evil Lotus God was screaming in pain.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going forward to the place full of pottery powder.
He used his phoenix feather to strike it against Evil Lotus God’s
neck. He cut it in half.</p>
<p>“Impossible… I cannot die… I am a God… I am a God…” Evil Lotus
God lost that very high sense of nobility and confidence he exuded
earlier.</p>
<p>He was in a very bad situation on all sides. Using the purple,
evil spirit forced him to accept the two-way attacks from Han Sen
and Sky Vine Radish. If had not used the purple, evil spirit, his
body would have been harmed by the pottery powder. It seemed as if
he had no way out of this bad situation.</p>
<p>“I am killing a god,” Han Sen coldly grunted. His body was
covered in pottery powder. He slashed Evil Lotus God.</p>
<p>Many white flames flew across the scene. They gave Evil Lotus
God more wounds to deal with. Evil Lotus God was screaming in
agony. It was hard to imagine that this was the same Evil Lotus God
that used his power to defeat Second Uncle and all the others until
they had no possible hope of fighting back.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God’s head was lopped off by Han Sen. The head
dropped and rolled near Second Uncle. The rest of the audience had
gathered around to spectate.</p>
<p>Second Uncle looked at the bodiless head with shock. His face
looked very weird. No one knew which words would be best to muster
and speak.</p>
<p>“I am a God… You dare to kill a God… You will be cursed for
eternity…” Evil Lotus God’s head might have fallen to the ground,
but he was not dead yet. He still cursed and cried at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was carrying a white flame. He slashed downward.
It split Evil Lotus God’s head through the middle. A purple lotus
flower came out of it. Many mysterious markings were flickering
across it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God Spirit Hunted. Found God Spirit Gene.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen was depressed. This time, there was no god spirit. Han
Sen was hoping to claim another god spirit and compare it to Sky
Vine Radish’s god spirit.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When Evil Lotus God was killed, a purple light came down from
the sky. All of his flesh and bones tuned into a purple light that
rose.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought another god’s sadness would repeat. When the
purple pillar of light went through the sky, the sky had a weird
twist. The purple pillar of light faded away in that twisted space.
It was not able to generate a god’s sadness.</p>
<p>After seeing that, Han Sen felt his heart jump. “Even the power
of a god spirit’s death cannot break out of the big barren systems.
What happened to this area? How did Sacred get destroyed?”</p>
<p>“Is that god’s personality…” Londo looked at the purple lotus
flower on the floor. His voice was trembling.</p>
<p>That was a god’s personality. If they took it, they could go
into the skies and become a god.</p>
<p>With such an amazing treasure before them, none dared take it.
They all looked at Han Sen. After all, when Han Sen killed Evil
Lotus God, his performance had been far too shocking.</p>
<p>Even Second Uncle or Meng Lie dared not think of doing something
so evil.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up the purple lotus flower off the ground. He was
going to put it away. He then heard a “katcha” noise come from
Londo followed by shockwaves.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it was Londo being brave enough to try and steal
the god’s personality. When he looked closer, it was not Londo that
was coming. It was the metal Kirin box that was behind him. It had
somehow opened. There was something inside it, and it had come out.
It was heading for Han Sen.</p>
