<h2>Invincible Defense</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2411</h3>

<p>People like Han Sen, who could survive a conflict with a deified
xenogeneic, were really helpful when it came to taking down deified
xenogeneics. Dia Robber and Dragon One both knew the value of
recruiting Dollar to their respective causes.</p>
<p>Even a party of Extreme King would be willing to hire Han Sen to
fight for them.</p>
<p>Kings wanted to hunt down deified creatures, and the Extreme
King could sometimes do that, but only if they found a weak
deified. The stronger deified beings were too powerful for even the
Extreme King to handle.</p>
<p>Dia Robber and Dragon One exchanged a glance, then flew towards
the fire area at almost the same time.</p>
<p>“This looks very bad! The core furnace just triggered its third
fire area. The Swords from the Furnace are strong enough to kill a
half-deified elite now.” When Dia Robber got a better view of the
battlefield, he couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>The core furnace had remained alive while deified xenogeneics
were killed around it because its power and fire area were too
scary.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like no one had tried to take it down before. A group
of half-deifieds had worked together to attack the creature before,
but their attempt failed beneath that sword rain. A few of the
half-deified elites were even killed before they could escape.</p>
<p>The large sword rain and the stacking fire area was a nightmare
for the Kings that challenged this beast. It wasn’t something that
could be overcome simply by assembling more people to go up against
it.</p>
<p>Dragon One nodded. “The fire area has stacked three times. Not
even our last generation Dragon Thirteen, who has the strongest
defense, would have been able to block this. And he was
half-deified.”</p>
<p>As they talked, they carefully kept themselves well outside of
the fire area. They didn’t dare enter. There were three fire area
buffs and rivers of swords in front of them. If they went inside,
they wouldn’t be coming out alive. Plus, that core furnace was
brewing its fourth fire area.</p>
<p>But when they peered down through the haze of swords, their
faces changed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was wrapped in a blue glow, and rivers of swords were
washing over his body from every angle. It was so scary that the
two half-deifieds felt a little numb at the sight.</p>
<p>Those scary sword streams slammed into Han Sen’s body, but they
couldn’t break through the defense of his armor. Han Sen hung in
the air as countless green crystal Swords from the Furnace came
soaring down to strike him, then bounced off like they were made of
cheap wood.</p>
<p>Against Han Sen’s armor, those scary swords that could kill
half-deified beings were nothing more than raindrops.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As they watched, the core furnace’s cogwheels and chains moved,
opening the furnace so it could absorb universal energies. Then the
entrance port of the furnace spat out a volcano of green fire. The
new fire area spread, then settled over the Swords from the
Furnace.</p>
<p>The Swords from the Furnace absorbed the fire area and
crystallized further. Many of the swords now looked like green
jewelry. They were glowing with light and fire, and each one of
them looked like some mythic weapon of legend.</p>
<p>“The fourth fire area!” Dia Robber’s lips pressed into a thin
line.</p>
<p>Dragon One looked glum. Four fire areas were now buffing the
Swords from the Furnace. Each sword now wielded the power of a top
half-deified being. Every one of them was equal to Dragon One’s
power.</p>
<p>There were many swords, and they swirled through space like some
angry, crystalline hurricane.</p>
<p>If that core furnace could go out into the geno universe, it
could wipe out many of the higher races. Its storm of swords was
like an army of half-deified xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Of course, the core furnace had its downsides, as well. Every
time it absorbed power from the universe, it shouldered the burden
of casting another fire area. Each fire area it cast was a strain
on its strength, so it couldn’t continue stacking its area power
forever.</p>
<p>Four fire area buffs were almost all the core furnace could
endure. If the fire area continued to stack, the furnace itself
might buckle and melt under the strain.</p>
<p>If the furnace was unlucky enough to encounter a powerful
deified xenogeneic, the deified wouldn’t let the fire area stack up
that many times. The deified would just smash through the storm of
swords and break the furnace in one hit.</p>
<p>But right now, the furnace had managed to build up four layers
of the fire area. The power it now wielded was truly frightening.
It wasn’t something a normal deified xenogeneic could deal
with.</p>
<p>A flash flood of swords approached Han Sen, blanketing the space
around him. Dragon One and Dia Robber’s eyebrows rose. The pressure
of the situation was getting to them, and they clenched their
fists.</p>
<p>“Can Dollar survive this?” Dragon One and Dia Robber stared at
Han Sen, hovering alone in his blue area.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The waterfall of swords came crashing down on Han Sen. They
buried Han Sen under a seething mountain of green jade. The raging
stream of swords kept coming down, and it felt like so much mass
was converging that a black hole was about to form, right there in
space.</p>
<p>Sweat tricked down the foreheads of Dragon One and Dia Robber.
If this kind of attack came at one of them, their bodies would be
torn to shreds.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a matter of enduring it through force of will. It was
an incredible power that had been designed for the sole purpose of
killing enemies. It was impossible to endure unless the defender
had more raw power than the attack. No amount of reinforcements or
additional troops could overcome something like this.</p>
<p>Water was very weak in small quantities, but when enough water
gathered in one place, it could become a tsunami. Even tall
buildings could be toppled by such forces of nature.</p>
<p>The swords of the core furnace held that same awe-inspiring
power.</p>
<p>The impacts of the sword stream were so loud that Dragon One and
Dia Robber could barely hear each other. Their eyes stared at the
blue light in the middle of the sword stream.</p>
<p>The blue light area had yet to be swallowed, and that meant
Dollar was not yet dead.</p>
<p>Surviving under such circumstances was nothing short of a
miracle.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The falling sword stream began to slow down, and Dragon One and
Dia Robber could finally see Han Sen through the small gaps between
the swords. Han Sen stood calmly in place. He was fearless, like
some sort of god. He let those Swords from the Furnace collide with
his armor, and he made no effort to block them. None of the swords
could break through his defenses.</p>
<p>Dragon One and Dia Robber were both shocked and happy. “What
kind of area and armor power does Dollar have? He remained
uninjured beneath the weight of those attacks.”</p>
<p>They could barely believe the strength of Han Sen’s defenses,
but it gave them hope. With such a powerful defense, stalling a
deified xenogeneic might be possible.</p>
