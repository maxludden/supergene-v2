<h3>Chapter 1796</h3>

<p>Yisha saw Han Sen coming back for the statue and swung her sword
again. The sword moved like a subtle dragon, and it wasn’t as
obvious as Han Sen’s approach.</p>
<p>Her sword mind was not any weaker than Han Sen’s. In fact, she
was the most difficult enemy Han Sen had faced since entering the
geno universe.</p>
<p>He didn’t have a weapon, and he didn’t dare to use his Pirate
Bone Sword to challenge her saw-knife. All he could rely on was his
movement abilities as he flew around the statue, trying to get on
it.</p>
<p>But Yisha’s agility and sword skills were in no way inferior to
Han Sen. When she waved her saw-knife, she prevented Han Sen from
being able to reach the statue.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew around the statue three times, eventually feeling
as if he had exhausted all the power in his body. If he didn’t
borrow some power from another source soon, he’d likely fall into
the water below.</p>
<p>“Let’s try this and see if it works.” Han Sen summoned something
in his hands. The light became a steel shield.</p>
<p>The steel shield was one meter high, and it was made of good
steel. In the front, there was a carving of a centaur roaring up to
the sky.</p>
<p>This was the Viscount beast soul Steel Centaur. It was a shield
beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not tried it out yet, and he didn’t know if it would
be weakened by Demon Grave. But he had to do something, and using
it now seemed like the best idea.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted the steel shield to cover his entire body. He
forced himself onto the statue’s shoulder.</p>
<p>When Yisha attacked this time, Han Sen did not retreat. Not that
he could, as there was no space to move backward. If he could not
maintain a position on the statue, he’d stumble back and fall into
the lake.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Yisha slashed the shield and heard a metallic noise ring out.
Han Sen’s body moved back a bit, but he still managed to recompose
himself and stay firmly on the statue’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Yisha looked shocked by this. Her eyes looked at Han Sen’s
shield, unable to believe it had managed to block her saw-knife and
save Han Sen’s life.</p>
<p>The serrated knife was like a mouthful of teeth, heading right
for Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had already regained his footing on the statue, and
now his stance was firm. He had a shield to block Yisha’s
saw-knife. He wasn’t afraid anymore.</p>
<p>They were both fighting atop the statue, and Yisha’s sword
skills still proved themselves to be tremendously spooky. But Han
Sen was hiding behind the shield. She slashed dozens of times, but
she failed to break the steel surface of the shield.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thrilled. Apparently, Demon Grave’s suppression had
no effect on beast souls. Therefore, beast souls were very handy to
have in that place.</p>
<p>Han Sen hated himself for not having any other beast souls right
now. If he had a bunch, he’d practically be invincible in this
place.</p>
<p>Yisha continued fighting for a while, but eventually stopped.
She stood on the right shoulder of the statue, staring at Han Sen
who stood atop the left shoulder. She said, “Why aren’t you
following Luo Ji? Why did you come back this way?”</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders. Keeping himself behind the
safety of the shield, he sat down carefully and said, “Mister Ji
ran off, so I decided to come back here.”</p>
<p>Yisha stared at Han Sen and sat down, as well. She felt
exhausted after doing so much fighting, too.</p>
<p>She was a noble belonging to one of the higher races, but the
Demon Grave had an even worse effect on her. Her body was no
greater than Han Sen’s in this place.</p>
<p>Now that Han Sen had the time to look over the statue properly,
he noticed that there was a word engraved on the statue’s neck. The
carving was a little rough, as if it had been added after the
statue was made.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked a little closer, and when he did, he was given a
shock. He knew those words. They weren’t Kate characters.</p>
<p>It was a language belonging to ancient humans.</p>
<p>“Super Gene?”</p>
<p>Two words followed by a question mark. When he saw those words,
Han Sen was shocked. The most shocking thing was how familiar the
writing looked.</p>
<p>Han Sen had previously seen a note written by his great-granddad
Han Jinzhi. It had said “Super Gene?” Now, the same words and
question mark were on this thing. The handwriting was identical,
too.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the words as his mind raced. “Han Jinzhi was
here? Why did he write this down? Why is there a question mark? Why
is Yisha here?”</p>
<p>There were so many questions racing through Han Sen’s head, but
he could not come up with any answers.</p>
<p>“Do you know these words?” Yisha suddenly asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was wearing his Dongxuan Armor, so she could not see his
face. But Han Sen had jerked slightly when he saw it, and he had
stared at it for too long.</p>
<p>“I can read a bit.” Han Sen did not deny it.</p>
<p>Yisha looked happy and asked, “What does it say?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Yisha and her smile, and said, “What’s written
there is not complicated. Tell me why you are here.”</p>
<p>Yisha immediately frowned and said, “I know something is strange
about this place. Perhaps there is treasure waiting to be
found.”</p>
<p>“Do I look retarded?” Han Sen asked, looking at her.</p>
<p>“No.” Yisha was shocked.</p>
<p>叮hen don’t treat me like I am.” Han Sen lifted his lips.</p>
<p>The scene went quiet. Han Sen began looking over the statue to
see if he could find any other writing. If Han Jinzhi really did
write those words, he wouldn’t have done so for no reason.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked everywhere, but there were no other words. It was
quite disappointing. And furthermore, he could no longer see the
Chaos. He wasn’t sure where they had gone off to.</p>
<p>“Who does this statue represent? Is it be a human or a
crystallizer?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of bubbles was heard from down below. He
looked down to the lake, and it seemed as if the water beneath them
was boiling. But Han Sen didn’t feel as if the lake was getting any
hotter. And there were so many bubbles emerging, you could not even
see beyond the surface.</p>
<p>“Dollar, do you want to live or die?” Yisha asked suddenly,
looking at Han Sen.</p>
