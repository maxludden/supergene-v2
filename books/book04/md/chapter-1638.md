Han Sen had been studying ways to defeat the Armored Man before the ranking competition of the Son of God’s started.

Han Sen wasn’t sure how powerful the Armored Man could be when he fully triggered his medication. If the Armored Man had shown the full extent of his power in the fight with Gu Qingcheng, then Han Sen’s own physical power when combined with Little Angel and his blood-pulse technique could defeat the Armored Man.

Han Sen found somewhere silent to combine with the Little Angel. The power infused his entire body, and his strength immediately surpassed the emperor level. There wasn’t any downside to combining with the Little Angel, so Han Sen had been fighting in this mode.

However, Han Sen wasn’t sure if he could defeat the Armored Man or not. Han Sen tried the Blood Legion technique while under this status.

Han Sen’s blood slipped out of his veins and suffused his flesh, which made some strange changes in Han Sen’s body.

Suddenly, in Han Sen’s Sea of Soul, Destiny’s Tower started to shake as if it were responding to the changes in Han Sen. It was no longer peaceful like it had been.

Han Sen summoned Destiny’s Tower and held it in his hands. He tried to control the geno core to make attacks. He didn’t actually fight, because he just wanted to see how long he could last under this status.

The results beyond his best expectations. After combining with the little angel, using the Blood Legion technique didn’t place a huge burden on his body. He lasted for a whole day before he gradually felt kind of tired.

“I think I should have enough time, and I don’t think it’s going to take that long to end the fight.” After separating himself from the Little Angel, Han Sen felt that his body was much weaker than before. It seemed that the Blood Legion technique still had a significant impact on his body, but merging with the Little Angel significantly weakened that influence.

When he returned to the Alliance, he found Littleflower and Bao’er playing in the yard. Zero was drinking tea on the stone chair beside them as she watched the two play.

“Zero, are you bored here? If you are, you can go to the Sanctuary.” Han Sen felt a bit sorry for Zero.

To ensure that his family would be safe, he asked Zero to stay in the Alliance to look after Littleflower and Ji Yanran. It had been very unfair to Zero.

Zero gave a very calm smile, and she poured a cup of tea and put it in front of Han Sen. She also filled her own cup, held the tea close to her face, and breathed in the steam as she sipped it.

Looking at Zero, Han Sen suddenly felt relaxed, as if nothing else actually mattered.

“No matter who she is, I won’t let anyone hurt her,” Han Sen promised himself. He then took the cup, took a sip, and enjoyed the moment

“Instructor, I still can’t find Qing Ya. Perhaps he’s already dead.” Inside a palace, a man in a cape saluted a man sitting on the throne.

“Who killed Qing Ya?” The man sitting on the throne looked very young, and he didn’t look like a human being.

He had silver hair and a bloody scar between his eyebrows. There was a spiral horn on his head that made him look like a unicorn, and at his back were a pair of golden dragon wings. With that golden crystal armor, he looked exceptionally powerful.

“We haven’t found out yet, but with Qing Ya’s power, I can’t think of anyone who could have killed him. Even the disciples from Blood Legion, while they might be able to defeat Qing Ya, I can’t imagine that they could actually manage to kill him Qing Ya. The only one I can think of who could kill Qing Ya that easily is the Chairman of the New Community,” said the caped man.

“Why him? Does he really have that kind of power?” The instructor said, looking at the caped man.

The man in the cape lowered his head. “That Chairman of the New Community is too mysterious. We still aren’t sure where he came from, and we aren’t sure if he is like us. We don’t even know if he is from Blood Legion. Qing Ya joined the New Community to study him, so he’s the greatest suspect.”

“But we can’t say for sure that he is the one who killed Qing Ya,” said the instructor.

“If we want to know if he killed Qing Ya, just let me go and test him. Then we’ll know whether he has the ability to do so,” said the man in the cape.

“The New Community is a part of our organization, and I have a pact with the previous Chairman that I won’t interfere with their issues. If we can’t be sure that the new Chairman is indeed someone like us, we’ll just leave him alone for now,” said the instructor calmly.

“Then what about Qing Ya?” asked the man in the cape, raising his head.

“Put it out of your mind for now. If the Chairman of the New Community really did it, we’ll figure it out sooner or later. There’s something more important for you to do now,” said the instructor.

“Please, do tell,” said the man in a cape with his head lowered.

“You’ve heard about the two creatures in the Divinity’s Bout in the Fourth Sanctuary, right?” asked the instructor.

“I did. Instructor, do you think that they might belong to Blood Legion?” asked the man in the cape.

The instructor shook his head. “That’s not possible, but something is indeed strange. Have some people in the sanctuary inspect them and find out who they are.”

“Instructor, they are almost invincible in the Fourth Sanctuary, which we cannot enter. The creatures we have in the Fourth Sanctuary might not be able to deal with them,” said the man in the cape.

“No need to deal with them. Just send our forces to see if they are really human beings or not. That is enough,” said the instructor calmly.

“Okay, I will go do it now. Eye of God is still in the Fourth Sanctuary, and with its power, it should be able to tell whether they are humans or not,” said the man in the cape.

“Have you figured out who the masters of the other three geno cores are?” asked the instructor.

“I haven’t identified the masters of Real blood or Bulwark Umbrella yet, but the master of that Crystal Core might be Han Sen. I’m still trying to confirm it,” The man in the cape said after some thought.

“The Hans again? D*mn it. Just go and confirm his identity,” the instructor said with a complicated facial expression.

After a few days, the ranking contest of the ten Son of God’s began, and Han Sen’s first opponent was the master of Sacred.

Han Sen wasn’t afraid of Sacred’s master now, and if the Divinity’s Bout hadn’t been taking up his time lately, he would’ve already rushed into Sacred shelter and killed Goddess.

He now hoped that Sacred’s master wouldn’t concede, as it would be a good opportunity for him to kill Sacred shelter’s leader.

He just needed to engage in one-on-one combat in Divinity’s Bout, but if he went to Sacred shelter, he would be forced to deal with lots of super beings, which would be much more difficult.

After entering the battlefield, Han Sen saw that Sacred’s master was already on the battlefield, and he wasn’t backing out Han Sen was very pleased.
