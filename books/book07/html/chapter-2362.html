<h2>Getting a Beast Soul Again</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2362</h3>

<p>The rainbow sea conch kept running, but the fire across its
shell couldn’t be extinguished. It was like a flaming wheel blazing
a trail through the water and across the sand. The fire refused to
go out.</p>
<p>“The little red bird, the harbinger of death!” Han Sen was
grinning like an idiot. Although he knew the little red bird had
become a deified elite, being able to damage another deified elite
like that was remarkably impressive.</p>
<p>Plus, the little red bird had only recently become deified, so
it could probably improve even more in the future. In time, it
might grow up to become something like the Ancient Water God.</p>
<p>The little red bird cawed in pride. It flew to the rainbow sea
conch, and Han Sen followed it while shouting, “Save his last
breath for me. I want to take the last hit!”</p>
<p>Han Sen chased after it, and the rainbow sea conch eventually
found itself unable to move any farther. The meat inside its shell
was boiling. The shell had turned translucent white, and it looked
as if the creature was being barbecued.</p>
<p>“Is it still breathing?” Han Sen drew his Thunder God Spike and
ran at the fiend. It was a deified xenogeneic, and although Han
Sen’s chances of getting a beast soul out of it were low, he still
wanted to try.</p>
<p>The fire around the little red bird’s body vanished, and it
floated down to land on Han Sen. It opened its mouth toward the
rainbow sea conch and inhaled. The gold fire was pulled back into
its belly.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Thunder God Spike slammed into the cooked conch meat,
but it was like a blade hitting rubber. The spike would not go
in.</p>
<p>Han Sen gathered up all the power he could, but no matter how
hard he tried, he couldn’t penetrate the flesh.</p>
<p>As the rainbow sea conch’s life faded, its body crystallized. It
became more and more resistant to Han Sen’s strikes.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed. The prize was right there in front of
him, but he couldn’t take it.</p>
<p>Not long after, the rainbow sea conch was completely
crystallized. Every inch of its body was a xenogeneic gene. It was
like a piece of art made from rainbow crystal.</p>
<p>“What a shame.” The rainbow sea conch was very dead. Han Sen was
unable to break its flesh, even though he used his Thunder God
Spike to strike it.</p>
<p>“Electrocution is a type of damage, right? Will the final hit
count as mine?” Han Sen felt very nervous. The prospect of earning
a deified beast soul was very enticing.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic deified hunted: Crystal God Conch. Xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he had been dropped off at the pearly gates
at heaven, only to fall way down into the fiery pits of hell. He
had managed to get the kill, but he didn’t get a deified beast
soul.</p>
<p>“Anyway, at least I got the deified gene. That is the biggest
reward,” Han Sen mumbled to himself, but he still felt
crestfallen.</p>
<p>Han Sen sent the Crystal God Conch’s body back to the
sanctuaries. Lifeless items weren’t destroyed in the sanctuaries,
just like the baby Sun Raven’s body.</p>
<p>The small black sea conches invading the blood kirin were gone.
It was wounded, but it wasn’t in any danger of death. With its
lifeforce and recovery speed, it wouldn’t take long for the blood
kirin to be back in action.</p>
<p>The blood kirin began to feast on the flesh of the Move Mountain
Sea Conch and what remained of the Electric Dragon. With gritted
teeth, Han Sen gave the Move Mountain Sea Conch’s xenogeneic gene
to the blood kirin, as well. He wanted it to recover the power it
had lost.</p>
<p>It was two days before he made it back to Underwater Town. By
then, the wounds on the blood kirin were no longer visible, but it
had yet to fully heal.</p>
<p>The blood kirin had been badly hurt by the Crystal God Conch,
and the little sea conches had ravaged its organs. It had been
really damaged. If it hadn’t been given plenty of resources to
heal, it would have taken a very long time for it to get
better.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on exploring the underwater realms, but he was
never able to find another King class xenogeneic. He didn’t know
why they had found two Kings and a deified in that one region.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to go back to that cave and take a look, but he
wasn’t good at shrinking his body. That cave grew smaller the
deeper it went. It eventually reached the width of a needle. Han
Sen spent some time digging his way through but found nothing. He
decided to give up after a while.</p>
<p>“I should take the blood kirin to King’s Garden to heal,” Han
Sen decided.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen had no intention of provoking the king tree
again. He wanted to find a root king dragon there so he and the
blood kirin could absorb some king air. If the blood kirin could
absorb some of that king air, the healing process could be
hastened.</p>
<p>Even though Han Sen tried to keep a low profile, entering King’s
Garden still drew a lot of attention.</p>
<p>It was very hard to find a primary root king dragon that was
unoccupied.</p>
<p>Han Sen found one, and after looking closer, he smiled. He
lifted his lips and said, “What a shame! It is Prince
Swordstar.”</p>
<p>Han Sen flew over to Prince Swordstar without hesitation.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar was sitting atop a primary root king dragon
with a few of his guards. When he saw Han Sen coming toward him,
his face changed.</p>
<p>“My good little brother, haven’t you heard that you should
respect your elders? I am taking this primary root king dragon. Get
lost,” Han Sen said as he approached.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar was very annoyed that Han Sen had been released
from prison by Miss Mirror. Now, hearing Han Sen say this, he was
so angry that he shouted, “I should respect our elders, but even if
we give it to you, I doubt you’d be capable of defending it! So,
what is the point of you having it?”</p>
<p>Other princes and princesses knew that Prince Swordstar had
brought Han Sen to the Sentencing Court. With Bai Yi’s spiteful
personality, everyone knew that he wasn’t going to let go of the
affront lightly. They turned excited eyes toward the brewing
confrontation.</p>
<p>“It looks like this big brother should teach you a lesson,” Han
Sen laughed coldly. His fist gathered up power, and he used the
Extreme King’s Shocking Sky Punch. He threw his fist toward Prince
Swordstar, who was sitting on the dragon’s head.</p>
<p>“Get them!” Prince Swordstar barked, looking at the blood kirin
in fear. He didn’t dare fight.</p>
<p>Four guards suddenly emerged from behind the dragon. Two of them
were half-deified.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Han Sen would allow the blood kirin to fight. But
the blood kirin was still injured, so he couldn’t let him go
forward.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “Let this big brother teach you the
invincible ways of a real Extreme King!”</p>
<p>After that, he sent an Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch toward
all four guards.</p>
<p>“Is Bai Yi crazy?” All the princes and princesses were shocked.
They knew who Bai Yi really was.</p>
<p>Although he had managed to claim the alpha statue and earn the
protection of the Kingese, he still wasn’t very high level. He was
a first-tier King. With his power and Original Water King Body, he
could fight a single half-deified, but it was simply arrogant to
think he could take on four at once.</p>
