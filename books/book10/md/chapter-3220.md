  It had to be said that reverse Super God Spirit mode was very strong. Although it was affected by the power in Dusk Sky, it was not like ordinary power that was sapped away quickly. The power was still very destructive.

Although it was affected too, the situation was better for her than it was for Han Sen.

Bury Path God did not move. His hand blocked Wan’er’s gold light again and again. The power broke the gold light. Wan’er was currently very weak. She probably only had about 30% of her power left. If she was still able to do things to that level, Bury Sky God’s power was likely as strong as a Reboot God Spirit.

Han Sen thought, “Is the temporary leader that strong? I wonder how strong the true leader of the God Chaos Party is. It is no wonder why or how he pushed the God Hall Leader to reboot the universe.”

Wan’er’s god will have not awaken yet. Her battle will keep exploding. She kept attacking Bury Path God, but she was being affected by Dust Sky’s power. It made her attack power weaker. Her threat to Bury Path God diminished, becoming less as time went by.

It was unknown what Bury Path God was planning. Although Wan’er kept on attacking him, he only used the right amount of power every time to shake her off. He did not actually try to harm Wan’er.

Han Sen knew Bury Path God likely had a plan for what to do with Wan’er, but now was his chance. He could have used this free time to break the power of Dust Sky and turn the tides of battle.

The area of the Dongxuan Aura had been reduced to cover only a planet, but Han Sen managed to push it out one inch from within him. His eyes looked at Dusk Sky’s structure. He went into it with remarkable details.

Han Sen had observed the structure of the geno universe and universe of kingdoms well, and he could tell that the two were quite different from each other. Although the most basic point of their structure was a very small glob of a substance, the geno universe’s ball substance was white. It looked transparent and not very real. The ball substance of the universe of kingdoms was presented as a solid black ball.

The two substances of the universes queued up differently. They both had their structural features and elements.

The 33 skies were the zones between the two universes. The structures there were very complicated. The basic substances of the nine skies he had already passed through were all different colors. Even their shapes were very odd. They were not just ball-shaped. The order of the substances was different from the two primary universes as well.

What was most ridiculous was how every sky’s structure and substance were different. It was hard to understand the rules dictating why that was.

In Han Sen’s head, Dust Sky looked very weird as he examined its most basic composition. Dust Sky’s basic substance structure was like a ball-shaped tai chi.

It was half white and half black and half real and half virtual. It was also spinning fast.

In the Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen clearly saw that his powers were being absorbed by the tai-chi-looking symbol.

These substances were everywhere. Everything there was made by the most basic tai chi substance structure, including the air. The spinning tai chi substance was like a vortex or a black hole. It emotionlessly consumed the power Han Sen and Wan’er had inside them.

Even Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit mode could not deal with the consumption of that power. It was just the consuming speed was a little slower for her.

If ordinary powers to the tai chi substance were a delicious cake, then Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit mode was like a bone that was hard to chew.

No matter how difficult it was to chew, it was still being consumed by the tai chi substance. It made Wan’er’s power weaker.

Han Sen tried to use his Break World power to block the consuming tai chi substance’s power, but it did not work. The tai chi substance itself was Dust Sky’s basic principle. Fighting against the tai chi substance was like fighting the whole of Dust Sky. Han Sen’s Break World power was not at a level that was that strong. It meant his power was consumed a lot. It was harder to fight against Dust Sky’s rules.

“Why does Bury Path God’s power not get consumed by the laws governing Dust Sky? How has he managed to do such a thing?” Han Sen looked at Bury Path God and noticed the tai chi substance that gathered up around him but did not consume his power. It was with him peacefully. Bury Path God did not do anything special. He did not use any power to repel the tai chi substances.

“Forever Solid.” Han Sen could not find a method from Bury Path God, so Han Sen had to sort it out himself.

Forever Solid enabled Han Sen’s body to remain in a solid mode that could not change, but power like that only made his consuming speed slower. It could not stop the power being drawn out of him.

That didn’t mean that the Forever Solid power was useless. Forever Solid did make Han Sen’s body fight the rules of Dust Sky’s power. Now, Han Sen was in Dust Sky. Each of his movements led to more of his power being consumed. To fight Dust Sky, the power released would be consumed by the tai chi substance.

Unless Han Sen used no power at all, all of his power would be consumed. There would be no coming back from that.

If Han Sen used his power to fight, the power leaving his body would be consumed. He could not figure out a solution to this issue. His situation was similar to Wan’er’s.

“Han Sen, why do you make yourself an enemy of the God Chaos Party?” Bury Path God asked Han Sen while continuing to fend off Wan’er.

“It is not like I wanted to be an enemy of the God Chaos Party, but it was you and your God Chaos Party that wanted to kill me. I am just doing what I can to protect myself.” Han Sen knew that stalling for time was not of much use, but this might have been the only way to break the deadlock. There was less chance of success in fighting Bury Path God. There was less than 10% of his power left. He could not beat Bury Path God.

Bury Path God did not deny what Han Sen told him, but he did not want to rebut the claim. He only coldly said, “If things are really that way, I will give you a chance to live. If you join the God Chaos Party, we will forgive all ill sentiments and erase our grudge.” “I have admired your party for a long time, but I do not know if you have the special requirements that would prohibit me from joining,” Han Sen replied.

“It looks like you are not afraid of dying.” Bury Path God was not a man who wanted to waste lives, but his interest in Han Sen was not as high as it was thought to be.

If he had not seen Han Sen’s power, in which he had killed the eighth sky king, Weapon God, he would probably not have spared more than two seconds to talk with Han Sen.

Bury Path God used one hand to break Wan’er’s gold light. His other hand wielded a rainbow. Its light looked like it could pierce the sky. It came right before Han Sen.

Bao’er frowned. Her hand held the small gourd with an urge to fight, but Han Sen stopped her.

Boom!

Han Sen’s Break World power attacked the shocking rainbow that pierced through the sky and ground. His entire body flew away. He hit a planet like a cannonball had been fired into
