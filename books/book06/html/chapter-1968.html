<p>The woman heard him and smiled. “You are very funny. My name is
Yun Sushang. I am a student of the Tenth Elder. You can call me
Senior.”</p>
<p>“Greetings, Senior Yun,” Han Sen said, suddenly feeling like he
was back in school. It was actually a nice feeling.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang pointed at the Buddha man and said, “His name is
First Day. The Buddha sent him here to study in Sky Palace, just
like you.”</p>
<p>“Amitabha! Greetings, Mister Han.” First Day bowed before Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not like the Buddha, but he didn’t think that every
single one of them was a bad person. He didn’t know First Day,
though, so he had no immediate reason to hate the man. That being
said, he still wanted to avoid being First Day’s friend. After the
introductions, Han Sen turned to Thousand Feather Crane.</p>
<p>“Thousand Feather, I thought you said there were twelve White
Jade Buildings. But I have only seen this one.” If Han Sen couldn’t
achieve a breakthrough on the seventh floor, he thought that he
might need a place with an even stronger Jade Air.</p>
<p>“There are twelve buildings and five cities in White Jade Jing.
Most people only see the twelve White Jade Buildings, not the five
cities. Consequently, they can only enter this one place. If you
wish to enter the others, you must first understand the other
towers,” Thousand Feather Crane said.</p>
<p>“What is there to leam?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s just something you have to learn. It’s hard
for me to explain. But I think you should practice on the third or
fourth floor. You can start thinking about moving on when you reach
the fifth or sixth floor,” Thousand Feather Crane said.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but someone suddenly entered
the seventh floor. It was Yun Suyi. They had met on the third
floor.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi, upon seeing Han Sen, was shocked. When the Jade Air
passed, Han Sen had vanished. She had believed that he had been
unable to withstand it, and so he decided to leave. She didn’t
expect that Han Sen had already gone to the top, looking for
Thousand Feather Crane.</p>
<p>“Suyi, let me introduce you. This is Knife Queen’s student Han
Sen.” Yun Sushang pulled Yun Suyi near and smiled.</p>
<p>“I met him already, down below,” Yun Suyi answered.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were sisters. They were the heirs of
the Tenth Elder. Yun Suyi had blood, while Yun Sushang was a
step-daughter. Yun Sushang was the Seventh Elder’s daughter, but he
had died. Yun Sushang was taken in by Yun Suyi’s father while she
was still young.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane was also a student of the Tenth Elder, so
he was close with the Yun sisters.</p>
<p>The sisters had a good relationship, as fine as any real
siblings. Since they had a little while before White Jade Jing
opened again, Yun Suyi had come to talk to Yun Sushang and kill
some time.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Thousand Feather Crane, “Thousand Feather, I’m
curious about the Jade Air of the other twelve buildings. Are they
stronger?”</p>
<p>Before he could answer, Yun Suyi said, “They’re not just
stronger. They have spirit. If you’re not an Earl at least, you’ll
die there. Don’t even think about going elsewhere. Just stay here
and practice.”</p>
<p>“So if I become an Earl, I can go to the other twelve
buildings?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You have to understand the knowledge of the White Jade
Buildings. Only then can you see the other buildings behind this
one,” Yun Suyi said.</p>
<p>“Thousand Feather Crane, Yun Sushang, and First Day are the best
of the Earls. Can they not understand this knowledge?” Han Sen
thought to himself. He knew it was something he shouldn’t say out
loud.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi knew what Han Sen was thinking, however. She smiled.
“Brother Crane and my sister already understand. Many people on the
sixth floor already understand, too. But of the twelve buildings,
this first one is the most tamed. The Jade Air here is the easiest
to refine, so it is best to stay here until you are a
Marquise.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Han Sen frowned in thought. “If the Jade Air
here is considered mild, how scary must the Jade Air be in the
other buildings? If I can’t break through here, maybe I can go to
the other White Jade Buildings. I just don’t know what I need to
understand about these constructs.”</p>
<p>After talking for a while, Yun Sushang suddenly noticed the
time. Then, she spoke to Yun Suyi. “The Jade Air is going to erupt.
Go back now. We will speak later when this is done.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi nodded and headed for the stairs. Han Sen was still
talking to Thousand Feather Crane, so she said, “You should come.
When the Jade Air arrives, you will become a jade statue before you
have a chance to return to the third floor.”</p>
<p>“Brother Han, head on down. We will talk later,” Thousand
Feather Crane said.</p>
<p>“I’m not going back. I want to practice here,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi and the others all looked at Han Sen. Yun Suyi found
herself both angry and amused. “Even most Earls do not dare come to
the seventh floor. Only my sister and Brother Crane, who are both
so talented and stronger than the average Earl, dare to practice
here. Did you not see the swathe of Earls down on the sixth floor?
They don’t dare come up. What do you think a Viscount can do here?
Do you want to become a statue?”</p>
<p>“Brother Han, you should go downstairs. You have to do this
floor-by-floor,” Thousand Feather Crane said.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “My skills have maxed out! I need the
seventh floor’s Jade Air to break through. Don’t worry;</p>
<p>I can fight against the Jade Air here. I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi started to say something else, but Yun Sushang cut her
off. “Suyi, go now. The Jade Air will soon erupt, and it’ll be too
late for you to leave when it does.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi left the seventh floor and paced quickly down the
stairs. She kept looking back, but she did not see Han Sen
following after her.</p>
<p>“This guy isn’t strong, but he is ambitious. Brother Crane will
have to carry him down, again,” Yun Suyi thought to herself.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang tried to convince Han
Sen, but they were not really friends. If Han Sen wanted to stay
that much, they weren’t going to plead against the idea.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane smiled wryly and shook his head. If Han
Sen could not withstand the force, then he would carry him down. He
could not allow the Jade Air to turn Han Sen into a statue and kill
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen found a spot that was closer to Thousand Feather Crane.
First Day looked at Han Sen curiously, and Han Sen shot him a
smile. First Day looked shy, and then turned away.</p>
<p>“This First Day Buddha is interesting. He is so young and so
strong. He might be as good as Seven Spirit. His mind is still like
a kid’s, though,” Han Sen thought. Then, the jade walls began to
emit a Jade Air.</p>
