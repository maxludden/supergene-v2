  Over the past few centuries, the Extreme King had put much of their focus on the systems of chaos. The Ice Blue Knights were pioneers, and their primary killing fields were those dangerous systems. They knew little about matters concerning other places in the universe. Because of this, they were unaware of who Han Sen was.

The Extreme King did have an information gathering department, so they did know a thing or two about Han Sen. But the Extreme King thought only people like Moon Wheel King or Yisha were worth focusing on. Not many people knew Night River King, at all. The only people that cared for that sort of information were the locals of Narrow Moon.

Ice Blue Knight King only knew that Yisha had a student. He didn’t know that person’s name or race. He had just assumed that her student would be a Rebate, not a crystallizer.

Ice Blue Knight King didn’t say much to Han Sen, and he simply encouraged him to engage in the test.

Although Ice Blue Knight King really admired Knife Queen, he wouldn’t go easy on her student. To gain his approval, Han Sen would have to demonstrate an appropriately impressive amount of power.

But because of his experience with Yisha, Ice Blue Knight King remained hopeful that Han Sen would succeed.

“Mister White, what do you think about Knife’s student?” Ice Blue Knight King looked at a man in green clothing standing beside him.

The man squinted as he peered at Han Sen and said, “He is an interesting man.”

“Well, after all, the student of Knife Queen should be at least half-decent. If he wasn’t, he would not have been selected by a woman like her,” Ice Blue Knight said with absolute confidence.

The green-clothed Mister White didn’t answer. He merely smiled and kept his eyes on the test.

Han Sen was in the Marquise queue. He was watching the Kings perform their test, thinking of a way in which he might get himself disqualified without looking like he was intentionally throwing the test.

It wasn’t as if he didn’t want to go to the Extreme King; it was just that he had many problems already in Narrow Moon. Leaving Han Meng’er there alone with Night River King would be a risky thing to do.

Han Sen wanted to take out Night River King before he left Narrow Moon. So, Han Sen planned to stay.

After watching for a while, Han Sen had an idea of how he might sneak his way past the test. The most annoying thing, though, would be the geno tree test.

That test was way too straightforward. The flowers opened up in accordance with how much power one had. People could see the results easily.

Han Sen was far stronger than the average Marquise. Even if he performed poorly in the other tests, dropping some blood on the tree would guarantee a flower boom that far exceeded anyone else there. Cheating on the other tests would be rendered pointless.

Fortunately, Han Sen had a way to deal with the tree, so he wasn’t too worried.

When it was almost Han Sen’s turn, Night River King cockily said, “Ha, now he has to go. That means I have Cold Palace all to myself.”

The tests at each level were different. A Marquise’s first challenge was a combat test. He had to fight and defeat a machine robot. That robot had been created by a Duke knight. Its strength would be Marquise level, so it would adequately test combat skills at that rank.

The scoring system went up to one hundred, and if you wanted to pass, you’d have to beat the ninety-point mark. The tests would continue even if the examinee failed one, though. Each test would have to be gone through for proper evaluation.

People that performed some tests poorly could still be selected.

With Han Sen’s level of power, the people of Narrow Moon thought he could defeat the machine with great ease.

But when Han Sen started to fight, the mouths of all the Kings were left wide open. Moon Wheel King himself was particularly shocked.

Lit! F*cking lit!

Han Sen’s fight with the doll was like the greatest fight of all time. If the audience hadn’t known Han Sen’s real power, they’d have been very moved.

Han Sen seemed like someone who had fantastic endurance, but not enough strength. He kept on fighting and fighting, even if he failed. He worked his way against the enemy without any fear of how difficult it might be. While Han Sen would bleed, he would not cry. And eventually, he did defeat his foe. He won the fight. It was just done in a movie-like way that was sure to encourage others.

When Han Sen beat the robot, many lovely female Nobles had tears in their eyes. They almost shouted out, “Han Sen, you are the best!”

But the people in Narrow Moon who actually knew Han Sen had strange expressions on their faces.

Han Sen was a man who treated Night River King like an annoying dog. He had beaten Dragons. He was regarded as being on the same level as Lone Bamboo. But now, seeing him struggle to fight a mere Marquise robot made the onlookers think that something was wrong with their eyes.

“*sshole! That *sshole! This is too much!” Night River King seethed as he watched Han Sen’s performance. But then he calmed himself down. “Yes, keep acting. Let’s see if you can trick the geno tree into blooming with fewer flowers.”

As he watched the fight, Ice Blue Knight King frowned. He asked Moon Wheel King, “Is he really Knife Queen’s student?”

Moon Wheel King coughed and smiled. “He has just become a Marquise. So, he is not in his best shape.”

“He works hard, but he is grossly underpowered. How did Knife teach him?” After seeing Han Sen use Teeth Knife, Ice Blue Knight King thought his performance of it was terrible.

“Um, Knife was busy much of the time. She sent him to Sky Palace for a while…” Moon Wheel King felt depressed.

Ice Blue Knight King stopped his line of questioning. He watched Han Sen’s performance and concluded that Knife must have had her reasons for taking Han Sen as a student. He believed Han Sen must have been strong in another way.

The tests of the Extreme King were very scientific, and they could accurately gauge anyone’s potential. The tests could show the extent of a person’s talents. But Han Sen’s performances were driving the people of Narrow Moon nuts.

They knew some of Han Sen’s true abilities. They knew how scary he could be, but now, he looked like a man that worked hard and had no real talent.

He worked very hard, but his results were terrible.

Moon Wheel King’s expression was becoming increasingly strained. It was difficult to avoid laughing when looking at his pinched face.

“It looks like Knife didn’t have a replacement.” Ice Blue Knight King sighed. Han Sen seemed well-behaved, and it looked like he worked very hard. His talents, however, were downright terrible.

Night River King only laughed at Han Sen coldly, without saying a word. He wanted to see how Han Sen planned to make it past the geno tree.

The results given by the geno tree were always accurate, so his act wouldn’t pay off. Taking the geno tree test would reveal the true extent of his power. Perhaps it would make Ice Blue Knight King angry.
