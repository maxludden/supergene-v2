<h2>Father and Daughter That Came From Nowhere</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2050</h3>

<p>All the shura were frozen. A human child, who was six years old
at the most, could throw around a third-rank goldhorned shura
fighter as if he was nothing more than a toy.</p>
<p>In their eyes, Bao’er was no longer a kid. She was a
monster.</p>
<p>“Humans are that strong?” All the shura were in shock.</p>
<p>If a child had achieved such strength, they couldn’t imagine how
strong the adults must have been.</p>
<p>Golot wanted to turn around and run, but Bao’er threw the
gold-horned shura at him like a bowling ball. The two slammed into
each other and tumbled across the floor in a spray of blood. They
lay in a pile, half-dead. They couldn’t get up, and they
moaned.</p>
<p>The other soldiers scrambled out of the restaurant, screaming
all the way. It was too horrifying for them.</p>
<p>“If you want revenge, take it now. They can’t fight back,”
Bao’er said to Wood.</p>
<p>But Wood and the others only looked at Bao’er strangely, and
they didn’t do anything else.</p>
<p>Bao’er then returned to Han Sen. She took his hand before
speaking to Wood again. “Don’t worry. If you guys want to, you can
go to the Alliance. Just tell them my father’s name, and no one
will touch you there.”</p>
<p>Wood and the others immediately understood that Bao’er and Han
Sen were special. Wood gritted his teeth and picked up a gun. He
shot Golot and the gold-horned shura in the head.</p>
<p>Wood handed the gun to a friend, then said to Bao’er, “I will
remember this favor, and I will repay the debt, if there is ever an
opportunity to do so. We will not go to the human place, though.
And you should go now. You killed King Samo’s people. The king owns
this planet, so you should run.”</p>
<p>“You guys aren’t leaving? There is no need to worry. My Dad is
here, and you can live in the Alliance.” Bao’er blinked at Wood and
the others.</p>
<p>Wood shook his head. “I believe you guys are earnest, but we are
shura. We will never betray our own race. We will not defect and
align with the enemy, so you guys should run.”</p>
<p>“What a nice soldier.” Han Sen sighed. A similar thing could
happen to humans, so there was nothing there that made them
inherently better than the shura.</p>
<p>“You guys have houses here? We are here on business for a few
days. Can we live here for a while?” Han Sen smiled at Wood.</p>
<p>“Did you not hear what the boss just told you? Planet Sky Cloud
is different, as King Samo controls it. You will be killed if you
do not go,” the waitress said.</p>
<p>Wood waved his hand, telling her to stop talking. He asked Han
Sen, “You really want to live here?”</p>
<p>Yeah, for no more than four days. Is such an accommodation
available to us?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Bell, take them someplace where they can rest,” Wood said,
while looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Bell obviously wanted to say something else, but she didn’t. She
obeyed Wood’s command and took them to their new room.</p>
<p>“Boss, why are you keeping them? You just killed King Samo’s
son. Keeping them here will only get us killed,” Bell said to Wood
when she returned.</p>
<p>Wood shook his head. “Couldn’t you tell they weren’t your
average humans?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how strong they are; they cannot defeat King
Samo and the other elites. Even if they were famous, what’s the
point? They are humans,” Bell said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Let us wait and see,” Wood said.</p>
<p>“Wait? Are we not leaving, either?” Bell and the others stared
at him with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“It is like you said. Planet Sky Cloud is controlled by King
Samo. We don’t have the money or the connections, so where can we
possibly go?” Wood continued. “Maybe staying here is how we
survive.”</p>
<p>You mean, those two humans? They…” Bell wanted to say something,
but there were noises coming from the hall. Many people were coming
through.</p>
<p>Their faces paled, and before they could react, many guns were
pointed at them. They were then led out to the lobby.</p>
<p>Wood saw King Samo, clad in his shura armor. If things hadn’t
worked out the way they did, they might never have seen the king up
close.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The shura soldiers stepped back behind the king. King Samo’s
face looked grim, and his voice was grating. “I don’t care who you
are, but you will die. My son’s death will not be for nothing.”</p>
<p>“King Samo, you had a good son,” a voice said from deeper within
the building.</p>
<p>When King Samo heard that voice, his face changed. His eyes
opened wide, and he asked in shock, “Who are you…?”</p>
<p>“I know who I am, but you have forgotten who you are. Killing
your own kind. Humiliating wartime veterans. Ignoring the laws of
the shura. Do you really think the shura are simple property that
you can own and control?” said the hard voice.</p>
<p>King Samo’s legs were quivering and his voice was shaky, but he
still had the guts to ask, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Come in and see who I am,” the cold voice responded.</p>
<p>“Don’t play tricks! Come out now,” King Samo said.</p>
<p>“As you wish.” A woman with white clothes, a white hat, and a
white mask emerged from the back of the establishment. When King
Samo saw Jade Ming’er, he was so shocked that he fell to the
ground.</p>
<p>He was the king of the planet, but he wasn’t actually shura
royalty. He was only a distant relative of the Jade family. Seeing
Jade Ming’er, who could one day be the queen, he was rightfully
fearful.</p>
<p>Wood thought he must have been dreaming. King Samo was now
begging before the woman, like a grandson meeting a grandad.</p>
<p>The woman scolded King Samo, and Samo did not say a word against
her. When she released him, he was overflowing with gratitude. He
appreciated the mercy, and he no longer cared about his son’s
death.</p>
<p>The most shocking for Wood and the others was that the woman had
been pouring drinks for the father and daughter. She was being
treated like a maid, and it made them feel as if they were in a
dream.</p>
<p>“Who are Bao’er and that man?” Bell asked Wood when they went to
rest. The whole day had been too strange.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk, and don’t ask! Keep them a secret forever. We
shouldn’t have come to know this,” Wood told them, with a sense of
importance.</p>
<p>Wood wanted to know who the father and daughter were, but he
knew that the more he knew, the more danger he’d be in.</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed in that restaurant for four days. When the fourth
day passed, a shura woman with a black mask arrived.</p>
