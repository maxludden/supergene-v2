<h2>Reborn</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2759</h3>

<p>While Han Sen was still trying to figure out what was going on,
his left arm started to move. It was like the blood in his arm was
driving his muscles forward. Han Sen’s brain definitely wasn’t
telling his arm to move, but his hand reached out to grip the blood
coral anyway.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at his hand in consternation, but he couldn’t
stop it. His left hand gripped the part of the blood coral that
looked like a dragon’s head.</p>
<p>“That Sacred elite isn’t planning on using my body to be reborn,
is he?” Han Sen wondered. His body and the blood coral began to
glow with a red light.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing was that this was the most critical
moment of the fight. He was losing control of his body, and the
demon was still coming toward him. It was going to kill him.</p>
<p>“Big Brother, I understand that you’re probably trying to take
over my body, but can’t it wait until later? Now is a bad time.” To
his surprise, Han Sen noticed that the blood demon wasn’t attacking
him. It stood some distance away, looking at Han Sen with
confusion.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Blood light surged from Han Sen’s body, but the process was
actually the reverse of his expectations. Instead of changing Han
Sen, the light was leaving Han Sen’s body and going toward the
blood coral in his hands.</p>
<p>The blood light sank into the blood coral, and Han Sen’s black
scales started to dull and thin. It was like he was devolving.</p>
<p>“What is going on? It isn’t going to take over my body? Is it
going to suck me dry instead?” Han Sen looked at the blood coral.
The dragon-shaped blood coral began to change as it absorbed the
blood light coming from Han Sen. Oddly enough, the blood coral had
lost its serpentine appearance and was now taking on a humanoid
shape.</p>
<p>No, it was taking on an actual human shape. The dragon head was
becoming a human head, and long human arms were growing out of the
body. The tail, however, still looked the same.</p>
<p>As the blood coral changed, Han Sen’s black scales quickly
disappeared. Soon, Han Sen looked normal again. It seemed like
something had been pulled out of his body.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, the shape of the blood coral looks rather
familiar… Old Blood Dragon Lady. Isn’t this what the Old Blood
Dragon Lady looks like?” It took Han Sen a minute, but he finally
realized why the half-human, half-dragon shape of the blood coral
looked so familiar.</p>
<p>The blood coral now had a human head and a dragon tail. Dragon
scales covered the being, and horns protruded from her head. The
Old Blood Dragon Lady was the being that had been drawn on his back
long ago. But the Old Blood Dragon Lady on his back had possessed
silver scales, whereas this one had red scales.</p>
<p>“I understand now. I understand why the blood coral has been
following me. It is because there are still remnants of the Old
Blood Dragon Lady in the tattoo on my back. If the Old Blood Dragon
Lady was the blood coral’s master, that means she is using the Old
Blood Dragon Lady drawing on my back to be reborn. The coral was
never trying to claim my body at all,” Han Sen thought, trying to
logic his way through what was happening.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen didn’t entirely understand the events occurring
around him, he could sense that his guesses were getting near to
the truth.</p>
<p>When the black scales on Han Sen’s body disappeared completely,
the blood coral became the Old Blood Dragon Lady. Her body hung
silently in the air, her eyes closed. She looked like a statue.</p>
<p>“Sacred sent the Old Blood Dragon Lady to help out the Very
High. Now, everything is explained.” Han Sen’s body was free once
more. He looked at the Old Blood Dragon Lady in the air, but he
didn’t know if this was a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
<p>The blood demon didn’t have Han Sen’s patience. It saw that the
Old Blood Dragon Lady was hanging motionless in the air like a dead
statue, and the blood demon’s flames exploded. The knife flew to
attack the Old Blood Dragon Lady.</p>
<p>“Be careful!” Han Sen shouted. It didn’t seem the Old Blood
Dragon Lady had woken up yet, and Han Sen was afraid for her. He
channeled some of his power into the shout, trying to roust the Old
Blood Dragon Lady.</p>
<p>He didn’t know if the Old Blood Dragon Lady was a friend or foe,
but the blood demon was definitely an enemy. And as far as Han Sen
was concerned, the enemy of his enemy was his friend. Right now,
Han Sen hoped the Old Blood Dragon Lady wasn’t going to wind up
dead before she had woken up.</p>
<p>The bloody knife light surged toward the Old Blood Dragon Lady,
but her eyes remained closed. She didn’t react to the incoming
storm of destructive power.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew how strong that knife was. Its attacks couldn’t
even be blocked. If the Old Blood Dragon Lady was struck without
even being aware of its coming, there was no telling whether or not
she could withstand the blow.</p>
<p>At this time, the Old Blood Dragon Lady finally opened her eyes.
Han Sen had never seen eyes like hers before. It was like stars
were spinning around inside them. They held all the possibilities
of a clear, open sky. Just looking into those eyes would be enough
for most people to be conquered by their purity and greatness.</p>
<p>“Your eyes are my home for eternity.” Han Sen had heard romantic
things like that said before, but he had never understood what
people meant. Until now. Looking into the Old Blood Dragon Lady’s
eyes, he understood.</p>
<p>The Old Blood Dragon Lady calmly looked on the blood demon. As
the knife light landed, she raised her arm. Her fingers that looked
like jade were pointed forward.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A beam of light as thin as a pen shot out of her finger. The
force of it destroyed the bloody knife light and the blood demon
shadow, revealing the sharp knife’s real body.</p>
<p>The sharp knife was struck, and it whirled away like a windmill.
It hit the field, digging a hole into the turf. God knew how deep
that hole was.</p>
<p>“So strong.” Han Sen was shocked. The sharp knife was a strange
xenogeneic. It was probably larva class, or perhaps even stronger.
The Old Blood Dragon Lady had annihilated it with only her finger.
Based on that alone, it would be difficult to comprehend how
scarily powerful she was.</p>
<p>The sharp knife seemed to be quite resilient. Although the
bloody flame shadow was destroyed, the blade itself hadn’t been
injured.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the sharp blade shot out of that
bottomless pit. The blood flame surrounding it had gotten scarier.
It generated a blood demon shadow once more, which grabbed the
sharp knife and slashed toward the Old Blood Dragon Lady.</p>
<p>The Old Blood Dragon Lady didn’t move. She raised her finger and
destroyed the bloody flame shadow surrounding the sharp knife
again.</p>
<p>The sharp knife generated bloody flames again and again, but the
Old Blood Dragon Lady casually blew them all up. It made Han Sen’s
blood boil.</p>
<p>“This is an example of true power. No wonder the Old Blood
Dragon Lady forced one of those people who call themselves God to
fall back. She is so strong.” Han Sen looked at the sharp knife
that was still trying ceaselessly to reach the Old Blood Dragon
Lady. Han Sen had to shout, “Big Sister Dragon Lady, please blow up
that knife!”</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The sharp knife was struck by Old Blood Dragon Lady. The weapon
flew a few hundred miles away, and a minute later, it was flying
back. It was carrying its scary, bloody flames. The terror still
hadn’t been stopped.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to keep cheering the Old Blood Dragon Lady on,
but the Old Blood Dragon Lady’s body froze. Suddenly, she fell from
the sky. She landed close to Han Sen, looking like blood coral
again.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes opened wide. He had been about to shout his
support, but now there was no point. He was looking at the blood
demon face-to-face. The atmosphere was quiet and tense.</p>
