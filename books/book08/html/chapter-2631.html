<h2>Random Punch</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2631</h3>

<p>“I am the greatest of my level.” Suddenly, everyone felt very
differently about the words that Han Sen had just spoken.</p>
<p>Exquisite’s body hit the ground with a thump. When she rose to
her feet, she did so like a shambling zombie. Her bloody face and
broken nose had instantly returned to normal. She was as pretty as
she had been before Han Sen’s punch, and it didn’t look as if she
had sustained any injuries.</p>
<p>“What kind of geno art is that?” Exquisite asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been able to increase his speed until he was faster
than the manipulated universe. He had moved too quickly for her to
even react. That wasn’t something a ninth-tier King should have
been able to achieve. Only a handful of half-deifieds could reach
such a speed. Exquisite knew a few people who could accomplish
this, but Han Sen wasn’t on that short list. The ones she knew were
all half-deified.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin of Sky Palace was one such individual. He could move
that quickly, but he used his Sky Eye and the Extreme Evil Path.
Han Sen was just a crystallizer that couldn’t use a Sky Eye.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t a geno art. It was just a simple punch.” Han Sen
smiled.</p>
<p>“Son of a b*tch. I am now buying into Han Sen’s bluffing.”</p>
<p>“Haha! A random punch. Well said, Brother Han.”</p>
<p>“This Very High is actually quite lame. She couldn’t even
withstand one of Brother Han’s punches.”</p>
<p>Many of the students at Sky Palace were excited. None of them
liked Exquisite much. They were all happy to insult her.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi couldn’t help but smile. “What is wrong with Brother
Han? Is he not capable of behaving humbly?”</p>
<p>“He has done what he should have. I never liked these Very High,
anyway,” Yun Sushang said.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo didn’t say anything. He merely smiled. The audience
thought Han Sen was just trying to make Exquisite mad, but he knew
Han Sen was speaking the truth. It really was just a simple
punch.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo had fought against Han Sen once before. Han Sen
really was that fast. His fitness was so high, it would be
difficult to find a half-deified that could equal him.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo had become one with the Purple-Eye Butterfly, which
was how his own fitness had increased to unbelievable levels. But
if he was compared to Han Sen, he still fell far short.</p>
<p>Four of Han Sen’s geno arts had reached the ninth tier. His
fitness had been reinforced four times. Ordinary ninth-tier Kings
simply couldn’t compete.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen didn’t use his super god spirit body, his
fitness was still better than others of the same level. By a wide
margin, too. Against other Kings, Han Sen really did reign supreme.
His talk about being the best of his league wasn’t some baseless
boast. After all, there were no other creatures that could
experience the reinforcement of four geno arts the way Han Sen had.
In addition, the geno arts he had focused on were amongst the best
ever. With the fitness he wielded, he was still a bit weak against
deified creatures, but Kings and half-deifieds were no longer a
serious threat.</p>
<p>“That was a simple punch? Then let me see how many simple
punches you can throw.” Although Exquisite was using her Very High
Eye, she couldn’t help but look a little angry.</p>
<p>Exquisite lifted her right arm and used the edge of her hand
like a knife. With it, she tried slashing toward Han Sen. Everyone
immediately realized that she was using Han Sen’s own skill; this
was Fang.</p>
<p>The students of Sky Palace were in shock. Teeth Knife wasn’t an
insanely good skill, but it was the Rebate’s secret geno art.
Practicing it required the body of a Rebate.</p>
<p>It was remarkable that Han Sen was able to use it, but after
all, he was Yisha’s only student. Somehow, Exquisite was able to
use Teeth Knife, too. When she used it, the purple Teeth air
shredded space. She was wielding the skill with more power than Han
Sen’s usage had possessed.</p>
<p>Exquisite had been in Sky Palace for a year. She hadn’t been
lazy during that time. Teeth Knife wasn’t a secret to the Very
High, and she had spent time practicing it to achieve a very high
proficiency with it.</p>
<p>When Exquisite used her Very High Eye, the entire universe would
work to help her. Her knifemind wasn’t as good as Han Sen’s, but
the power in her strikes was above the Teeth Knife Han Sen had used
earlier.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the tearing space power coming toward him. The knife
air was like the real, raging purple air of a dragon’s maw. Still,
his expression didn’t change. Running The Story of Genes at
maximum, he used his own body to throw a punch toward the purple
knife air.</p>
<p>As everyone gaped in astonishment, Han Sen’s punch broke the
knife air that was raging toward him. His counterattack didn’t stop
there, though. It flew all the way back to Exquisite and pounded
her knife-hand.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The sound of breaking bones crunched audibly throughout the
arena. The thin bones in Exquisite’s hand were shattered by Han
Sen’s fist. His punch was still unstoppable, and it continued
toward Exquisite’s chest.</p>
<p>Exquisite’s face had turned white, but she was able to react
instantly. She used God’s Wander to disappear from in front of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was waiting for her to appear again. When she
reappeared, Han Sen’s fist was still heading straight toward
her.</p>
<p>Everyone’s mouths opened wide. They couldn’t believe their
eyes.</p>
<p>Even Sky Palace Leader looked stunned. After a while, he said,
“Not bad. He is as good as I was when I was younger.” “He’s much
stronger than you when you were young,” the woman said. She didn’t
feel bad about the critique.</p>
<p>“When I was young, I was stronger than a tiger. I was crueler
than a wolf,” Sky Palace Leader tried to explain.</p>
<p>Before he was finished, the woman cut him off. “Could you bully
a student of the Very High like this when you were younger?”</p>
<p>“Um… I did beat them…” Sky Palace Leader coughed. “There is a
big difference between ‘beating’ and ‘bullying,” the woman said
with a roll of her eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen was playing with Exquisite like a cat with a mouse.</p>
<p>In front of that absolute power and speed, Exquisite—who had
previously looked like some sort of god—was being used as a
punching bag. Her bones were breaking one by one, and she couldn’t
maintain her regal appearance.</p>
<p>Exquisite used all kinds of geno arts as she tried to fight
back, but her efforts were wasted. Han Sen’s speed and power
completely suppressed her. She couldn’t dodge. She couldn’t
counterattack. Aside from getting pummeled, there was nothing she
could do.</p>
<p>Han Sen was like an enraged tyrannosaurus rex right now. He
ignored Exquisite’s attacks and allowed her powers to come down on
him. Her attacks made slight marks on Spell’s armor, but they
disappeared quickly after.</p>
<p>Every one of Han Sen’s punches hit Exquisite, though. Every bone
in her body broke under the onslaught. Blood gushed out of her
mouth uncontrollably.</p>
<p>If she had been fighting someone ordinary, she could have used
God’s Wander to protect her body. Things would have gone much
better for her.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s alter ego had already learned God’s Wander. Each
time she disappeared, he just needed to calculate and predict where
Exquisite was going to pop back into reality.</p>
<p>Plus, the arena was quite small. There wasn’t much room for her
to teleport around. Han Sen could easily determine where she was
going to show up next. Pang!</p>
<p>Exquisite’s body hit the dome of the arena again, and the shield
flickered and shimmered under the impact. When she landed on the
ground in a heap, Exquisite remained where she was and didn’t try
to get back up again. She looked at Han Sen with astonishment.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe it. Her Very High Eye was active, but she
was completely suppressed by another of the same level. Try as she
might, she couldn’t fight back.</p>
