  Although it was separated through the geno god list, one could still feel Barr's scary presence.

Normal creatures only sensed that Barr was powerful. It was hard to tell exactly how strong he was. The faces of the deified elites participating in the geno god list all exhibited different amounts of change.

The presence Barr released was very strong for someone at the primitive level.

"That power is not bad, but if he said he was invincible against others in the same tier as him, that is a bit over-the-top," an Extreme King primitive deified said while grunting. "If I was his opponent, I could easily suppress him."

Other primitive deifieds thought the same way too. In the next second, the faces of the primitive deified people who had these thoughts changed.

Pang!

Barr rushed before Han Sen. The moment their fists collided, his whole body exploded like a nuke. Every inch of his flesh erupted with power. He unleashed all of the power inside his body.

A big, black sun arose. It was like a demonic mouth that could swallow everything. The meteors and small planets in space were destroyed by that scary power. It was like everything within that explosion was destroyed.

Power like that was already better than anything else a primitive deified could achieve. There were no deified primitives out there who could explode their god bodies completely, and there were no primitive deifieds who could use their own god bodies as Barr could.

This self-exploding power had the same magnitude of a powerful attack dealt by a transmutation class deified.

Killing another of the same level as easily as killing a dog was indeed an exaggeration, but the power of that attack could effectively deal with most primitives deifieds. It was nothing to sneer at.

"Fuck! This guy is too crazy," a primitive deified angrily said. "Is this how he plays? He is making himself a bomb."

The black sun was like a demon that could control everything. It flickered in space for five seconds and then started to go dim. The shockwave made people's hearts jump. It made the normal creatures that watched the fight become very scared.

Even if they were only just watching this scene, it still terrified the people.

"It is no wonder a deified elite of the Destroyed is so scary."

"Of course. That is why Barr was called a genius. Although he used Han Sen's blessing to become deified, what he achieved was nothing weaker than a deified who had managed to level up. He is perhaps even stronger."

"Aren't you guys just talking trash? If people did not have Barr's Destroyed body, who would play like this?"

"Dollar is so unlucky. He encountered Barr in his first fight; a man who will recklessly play with his life. Even if he doesn't die, he will end up wretchedly disabled."

"I don't think there is much of a chance of him being rendered disabled. Although what Barr said was a bit crazy, he does have what it takes to be crazy. His self-exploding power can really kill most that are of the same level. Perhaps Dollar's level is higher than him."

"Impossible. In the geno being scroll fight, Dollar was only Marquise. How many years has it been? Leveling up to primitive so soon is already a scary prospect. If he was larva class, that would be ridiculous to suggest."

While everyone was discussing the situation, the black sun had started to dim. The sky full of ash started to come together. It had become Barr's body.

"This power is like a bug. He will explode himself to die with his enemy and then come back to life. It really is something invincible against another of the same level," a high-level Extreme King deified commented.

Just as he finished speaking, the creatures in the universe were shocked. Within the space that exploded, that saw that everything had been turned into dust. Right at the epicenter of the explosion, Dollar was still hovering. It looked as if he had not been injured at all. Even the armor he wore had not been dealt a scratch.

"How is that possible... He is not injured... How did he do this..." Everyone was shocked.

"He resisted such a scary attack and did not get hurt. Did he become a transmutation class?"

"I don't think so. I have never heard of this race called humans before. Not even the three higher races can level up so quickly, and he is just from one of the smaller races. How could he level up so fast?"

"If it is not his level, do you think he has some special sort of geno art or treasure?"

While everyone was trying to guess, they heard Barr laughing like a mad man. "It is no wonder you are Dollar. I knew it would not be so easy to defeat you. Now, let us begin. What I am going to do next will require all my true power."

After that, Barr's body was burning with a light flame that was like a demon flame. His whole body turned into a black flame that was headed for Han Sen.

Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!

Barr's entire body had become a scary explosion that had a humanoid shape. It kept coming for Han Sen. The self-explosion power was now stronger and scarier than before. After he self-exploded, Barr immediately regenerated the shape of his body. Then, he committed to another suicidal attack on Han Sen.

Every attack was self-exploding. Barr was like an undying demon. The scary, suicidal attacks made the scalps of many deified elites itch.

What really shocked them was Dollar's performance. They saw Dollar just standing there in space. He was like a god. He was just hovering there and not moving. He randomly waved a punch and blocked all of Barr's scary and suicidal attacks. It did not matter how Barr self-exploded. He was unable to hurt him.

The scariest self-explosion was like a beautiful, albeit useless firework, against Han Sen. It did not even make him stumble an inch.

"Too strong... Dollar is too strong..."

Many spirits were so excited while watching all of this, but most of the creatures could only tell that Dollar was strong. They did not know how strong he was.

"Weird. How can Dollar level up so quickly? It looks like he is at least transmutation class, but he could be even higher." The elites who we're able to understand the scene knew that there was a level gap between Barr and Dollar. If Dollar wanted to beat Barr, it would be easy.

"Dollar, let's finish this while we compete in the geno god list fight." On a planet in Narrow Moon, Yisha was staring at Han Sen and Barr fighting. Her eyes were burning with the desire for combat, and her face was as cold as ice.

Yisha joined the geno god list fight too. She had studied the combatant list. She only had to win twice. In the third match, she would square off against Dollar.

God was in the garden watching the events unfold with interest. God seemed to be happy watching this performance.

It is a shame. I should have given him a stronger opponent. But don't worry, things will get more interesting later. God took out a notebook and looked at it. It seemed as if it was a list of fighters.

"Let's end this." Han Sen had now seen Barr's Destroyed skill. It was strong, but it was still comparable to something like Break Six Skies. It was nothing unstoppable. The only thing Barr was strong with was his indestructible god body.

Han Sen had no mood to keep going. He punched toward Barr.

"Good timing." Barr roared. He did not fall back. He ran toward Han Sen. No matter how powerful the enemy was, he was not afraid.

Of course, that was because having a god body meant not needing to fear death.
