    <p>
      Stay Up Late looked at the officer sadly. Without moving an inch, he said,
      “Officer, it was you who taught me to never fall back. It was you who
      taught me to always do my job. I will never forget that”
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer moved his eyes and then stopped. He responded by saying, “If
      you must be like this, then excuse my cruel deeds.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, the officer swung his white metal sword. But before Stay Up
      Late could see how it moved, he groaned in pain. He now had a wound on his
      chest that was deep enough to reveal his ribs.
    </p>
    <p>“That was a warning strike,” the officer said to Stay Up Late.</p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late looked at the white metal sword and said, “The Western King
      Sword and the Southern King Wings are so powerful. No wonder they are
      legendary.”
    </p>
    <p>“I only used 10% of my power!” the officer said.</p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late looked down on the wound on his chest and calmly said, “Next
      time you strike, and I don’t dodge, please just leave my body here. A
      special ops operative that doesn’t complete their mission should not
      return home.”
    </p>
    <p>“Why are you so stubborn?” The officer sounded a bit angry.</p>
    <p>“These are my principles. You taught them to me!” Stay Up Late said.</p>
    <p>
      “Good. I will teach you another lesson, then. You need to think on the
      fly,” the officer said and moved his Western King Sword again. He did so
      faster than last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this time, Stay Up Late moved. It was like he moved with the Western
      King Sword, except he was a little ahead of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late grunted, and another wound appeared on his body. This wound
      was lighter than the last, however, and the damage wasn’t so grievous.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like you can teach an old dog a new trick.” The officer frowned.
      The sword had not performed as impressively as he had expected, especially
      after he put even more strength into the second swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late laughed and said, “I learned that from Han Sen. Humans are
      weaker, and their lifespans are shorter, but their creativity far exceeds
      ours. The skills they create are far more ingenious than what the
      crystallizers developed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are falling!” the officer grunted. He waved his fire wings and swung
      his Western King Sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late’s movements were similar to Han Sen’s, but not exactly on the
      mark. He was borrowing some techniques and skills, but he was adding them
      to his own. He was still using mostly his own talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late dodged the deadly attack, but he was too weak to escape it
      all. His body was wounded again. He was beginning to look like a bloodman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer, with armor from two crystallizer kings, was faster and
      stronger than Stay Up Late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Gugia get killed by Golden Growler, the officer had lost all his
      patience. He waved his Western King Sword and prepared to unleash all his
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late had managed to avoid getting killed by the previous three
      strikes, but he had still been hit by each. With the wounds incurred, he
      wouldn’t be able to evade the fourth. The sword was on its way, arcing
      down towards his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s over!” Stay Up Late sighed. He knew he wouldn’t be able to dodge it,
      and he knew his body would be cut in half.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a light came from the sky. It hit the Western King Sword with
      the power of a small sun. It shocked the officer and his sword, and the
      sword missed its target, buying Stay Up Late time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late’s body moved fast, and he avoided the strike. He looked to
      the sky in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer’s face changed and he looked up, too. There was a shadow up
      there, moving quick. And there was a light coming down on the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer kept swinging his Western King Sword to try and break the
      light, but he then saw a giant beetle land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had finally come back to Roca, and he saw Stay Up Late was going
      to get killed. He used the unicorn beetle’s weapon systems to save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the person use a sword to break the beetle’s light, Han Sen was
      shocked. The beetle’s light was not as good as geno armor because the
      mobility wasn’t up to scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer saw someone appear, and he didn’t want to waste any more time
      with the unexpected. So, he had to finish his task before Zagu was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flapped his wings and teleported to the beetle. He slashed towards the
      beetle and cut a three-meter-long crevice through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, so he quickly recalled the beetle. The unicorn beetle
      could not move fast to evade attacks. He was afraid it could very easily
      be destroyed if that continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen!” The officer was shocked when he saw Han Sen emerge from the
      machine. He used his Western King Sword against him, trying to slash him
      like he had never slashed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s face changed and he tried to dodge, but his fitness could not
      save him from those swipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could move, the glove on his right hand became an armorset that
      shielded his entire body. Then, the fist aligned itself with the arc of
      the Western King Sword.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The fist hit the sword, and it created an explosion in the sky. It was far
      worse than the detonation of an atom bomb. The impact turned the ground
      into an ocean. The city became a ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s body fell back a few thousand meters. He was rather shocked that
      he didn’t fall over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the immense power of the glove, but even so, he was still sent
      flying. His chest fell awful, but his opponent hadn’t moved an inch. That
      was a testament to the sheer power he wielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not know Western King Sword, Southern King Wings, and the
      glove were all on the same level. The officer was simply stronger than Han
      Sen, which made the glove appear weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Northern King Glove. I did not expect one of the four crystallizer kings’
      armors could be found here. Let me take the Northern King Glove and the
      Eastern King Crystal Shoes, then I can get moving.” The officer looked
      excited, staring down at Han Sen in the jade armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flapped his wings alongside his sword. The officer looked completely
      murderous, and he wanted to kill Han Sen for the glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used The Story of Genes and let his energy combine with the armor
      to assimilate with it.
