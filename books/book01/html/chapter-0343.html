<p>Fang Guotao was a renowned martial arts specialist who had become popular because he invented a hyper geno art named Primal Innocence.</p>

<p>Among the unevolved, Primal Innocence was the fad of the moment. Four to five young man out of ten had read Fang&#8217;s book elaborating on Primal Innocence.</p>

<p>The reason why this hyper geno art was popular was its concept &#8220;the innocent has no fear.&#8221; Its core value was that humans had unlimited potentials, but due to negative emotions such as fear, humans had become their own prisoners, which made it hard for them to reach their potentials.</p>

<p>In order to develop one&#8217;s potentials and increase one&#8217;s abilities, the key was to keep one&#8217;s innocence and lose the fear. This way, one could continue to break free and increase one&#8217;s abilities.</p>

<p>Because of the popularity of Primal Innocence, Blackhawk had also invited Fang Guotao to give a speech.</p>

<p>Many students of Blackhawk had come down to the auditorium for the speech. Many became motivated, as if they were to come fearless demigods in the next moment.</p>

<p>Naturally, Han Sen had no time for the speech, and he was not at all interested in Primal Innocence.</p>

<p>Primal Innocence was so popular that even Shi Zhikang bought the book to study. Han Sen scanned through the book and found most of its contents pointless.</p>

<p>Few people could reach the state of being fearless, unless they were brainwashed or hypnotized. Even if one could reach that state, it would be more harm than good.</p>

<p>The ability of feeling fear was an important function of mankind. It was like the ability of sensing pain, which was a guideline telling you what to do and what not to do.</p>

<p>Although this guideline could be off, it would be even worse without it. If someone lost the ability to sense pain, after falling asleep, he would not be alarmed when burned or attacked. The alarm system would be down.</p>

<p>It was the same in the case of fear. If one did not know what was fear, the person must be a lunatic who dared to do anything.</p>

<p>Therefore, Han Sen was not interested in Fang Guotao or his Primal Innocence, and thus would not listen to his speech.</p>

<p>However, Fang Guotao was a flamboyant person. He would not be satisfied with a speech in the auditorium and had to demonstrate the magical effects of Primal Innocence in the training hall where Han Sen was.</p>

<p>&#8220;The potentials of mankind are unlimited and Primal Innocence will teach you how to reach your full potentials. I&#8217;ll demonstrate that with the gravity trainer.&#8221; Fang Guotao pointed at a student and said, &#8220;Mister, please come over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; The students pointed at himself, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you,&#8221; replied Fang Guotao assertively.</p>

<p>The student hesitated for a moment and then walked toward Fang Guotao. Fang Guotao asked, &#8220;what is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Wang Hong,&#8221; answered the student.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wang Hong, could you tell me what are your limits when using the gravity trainer?&#8221; Fang Guotao asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could barely pass the 12.0 test,&#8221; replied Wang Hong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great. If I tell you now that you can pass a 13.0 test right away, would you believe me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is unlikely, right?&#8221; Wang Hong knew his phone limits. He could barely pass a 12.0 test and would definitely fail a 13.0 one.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe me? I will teach you right away Primal Innocence and then you can immediately pass a 13.0 test,&#8221; Fang Guotao said and turned on his own smart device, showing Wang Hong some tutorials of Primal Innocence.</p>

<p>Wang Hong did some movements as Fang Guotao asked and listened to the explanation of Primal Innocence before he started a test in a gravity trainer.</p>

<p>The parameters were set to 13.0, and Wang Hong successfully passed the test, which amazed the audience and gave rise to waves of applause.</p>

<p>Although the improvement was only 1.0, it was quite something for military school students. After all, it was extremely difficult to enhance one&#8217;s ability after a certain point.</p>

<p>Next, Fang Guotao picked several more students for the same experiment, and they all made some improvements, which convinced more students.</p>

<p>After coming out the gravity trainer, Han Sen was dazed after seeing so many people in the hall. After a while, he realized that Fang Guotao was making his speech there so Han Sen stayed and watched.</p>

<p>After watching for a while, Han Sen became impatient. In fact, Fang&#8217;s methods were not that great. Although primal instance was effective, it depended on who the user was.</p>

<p>All the students picked by Fang Guotao were timid and inconfident. Normally speaking, people like this could tap into their potentials easily once their confidence was boosted. In addition, there was tricks similar to Overload in Primal Innocence. Therefore, it was not hard at all to improve their testing results.</p>

<p>Han Sen was totally able to demonstrate the same thing himself, so he was bored.</p>

<p>Without the motivational words, Primal Innocence was nothing compared to Overload.</p>

<p>The psychological suggestions made people blind, and Han Sen was not interested in that idea. However, he had to admit that Primal Innocence might be useful for those who lacked confidence.</p>

<p>Han Sen decided to go back to the gravity trainer instead of wasting his time listening to the speech.</p>

<p>In Fang Guotao&#8217;s eyes, Han Sen&#8217;s move stood out. All the students were listening attentively except for one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister, are you going to try Primal Innocence in the gravity trainer right away? Please wait a second. There are some techniques that you have to understand before you try Primal Innocence out. Come over here. I would love to instruct you on them.&#8221; Fang Guotao thought Han Sen was so motivated by his speech that the student wanted to try it out in a gravity trainer.</p>
