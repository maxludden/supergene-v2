  “It is very violent, but I must admit I do like the concept.” Han Sen quickly memorized all the content of the Break Six Skies he had just read, and he made plans to learn and practice it when he found the time. It was such a violent geno art that it could easily be used to challenge enemies that were a higher level than he was.

Still, it did seem particularly difficult to learn. It was a very rough and visceral geno art, but wielding it required a lot of precise skill. The difficulty level was definitely up there with Sky Palace’s Suppress Evil.

As an analogy, the geno art was like a human nuke. Even if the user understood the principles of how it worked, trying to make use of it without blowing yourself up was a difficult feat to achieve.

Han Sen was not worried about the level of precision required, of course. And he had his Dongxuan Sutra. With that, he could control any substance. That made it far easier for him to practice other skills than it would be for any other person or creature.

Even so, training this skill would require a lot of time. He currently had a lot of other skills to practice, and he wasn’t even in the mood to start, so he wasn’t going to do anything with it just yet.

Han Sen looked around the warehouse some more, but he didn’t find anything else that was half as interesting. He eventually returned his focus to the metal cubes.

He started talking with the white Metal Beast, despite the fact that there was a rather severe language barrier. Han Sen put in a lot of effort to overcome it, and he used Metal Eater as bait to entice the Metal Beast to cooperate with him.

Han Sen was eventually able to confirm that the white Metal Beast would leave him the half-dead, half-deified Demon Bug King. Upon settling on that, Han Sen went over to one of the metal cubes.

The white Metal Beast had eaten the demon bugs before. The only thing it didn’t like was the layer atop the cubes. When Han Sen asked the white Metal Beast to leave an ordinary demon bug xenogeneic gene for him, he was met with a stern refusal. That wouldn’t be allowed, and even making Metal Eater seduce the white Metal Beast did not change its mind. So, Han Sen gave up on that prospect.

“Twenty-four Demon Bug Kings. I should be able to get a Demon Bug King beast soul, for sure. Just one is all I need!” Han Sen thought to himself as he stood before a gold metal cube.

The handprint pattern passwords of the Breaksky’s gold metal cubes were all different from each other. And figuring out each combination was a headache. Getting the right code by chance was less likely than winning the lottery. The chances were as slim as a supernova creating humans.

But Han Sen did not need to rely on luck. As he examined the gold metal cube, a purple color flowed into his right eye. The black pupil became entirely purple, then split into four. It became a purple pupil composed of four petals.

That was the spectacle beast soul Han Sen had received from killing Evil Eye. It was called Purple Eye Butterfly, and it was a deified beast soul.

Although that was not a beast soul used for fighting, Han Sen still treasured it. He considered it more of an asset than any fighting type beast soul. Even a deified weapon beast soul was just a weapon with deified powers. Although possessing it would make Han Sen more powerful, it’d still be useless against an actual deified enemy.

The Purple Eye Butterfly spectacles were different, though. Even against a deified enemy, they would be very useful.

Han Sen stared at the gold cube with his right eye, and the four petals in his eye began to spin. It looked very weird. As the petals spun, Han Sen’s right eye could see something he would not have been able to see otherwise.

It was different from the Purple Eye godlights. The spectacle couldn’t restrain an enemy, but it could allow Han Sen to analyze a substance’s structure and thereby research it more effectively.

When Han Sen looked at it with his purple eye, it was like he was playing back the entire sequence of the gold cube’s creation. He saw its components stripped away one by one until it was only a pile of raw material. Han Sen was able to see every step of how the thing was made. If he had his own materials, he figured he could create one himself.

With the whole process unfolding before him, Han Sen looked for the password that had been input into the gold cube. Han Sen didn’t actually plan on making a cube of his own, though, so the only thing he decided to memorize was the password.

After doing that, he put away the spectacles. He gathered up power in his hands and started smacking the prints.

When Han Sen’s last strike landed on a print, he retreated without a moment of hesitation. He pulled Bao’er and Metal Eater close, then summoned his Demon Bug Bai Sema.

They all hugged each other tight so that Han Sen could make the Bai Sema as strong as possible. That way, even if a half-deified Demon Bug King came to strike them, the shield wouldn’t break under the force of a single blow.

Katcha!

The gold cube started to split open, and before long, it wholly shattered. The metal cube became a rapidly unfurling swarm of gold demon bugs. They were each half as big as a fully grown human, and in a few seconds, gold demon bugs were frantically flying everywhere.

Han Sen looked at the gold demon bugs, and he noticed that they looked almost exactly like the blue demon bugs. It was obvious that they were the same species.

Upon seeing all those demon bugs, the white Metal Beast looked extremely happy. It only disliked the layer that coated the cubes. He found the bugs themselves quite tasty.

Before the gold demon bugs could spread out, the white Metal Beast opened its mouth and swallowed the entire swarm of them.

“Hey! Hey! You said you’d leave the gold Demon Bug King for me. But you went and ate them all!” Han Sen shouted in frustration.

The gluttonous creature had eaten every single bug. Han Sen had put in a lot of effort to open that cube, but despite that, he had gotten nothing for all his work.

While Han Sen sulked, the white Metal Beast opened its mouth and spat out a few things.

There were many gold bug crystals. They all glowed with golden light, looking like the rarest of gems. There was one amongst them that must have been the King class xenogenic gene.

Aside from those gold bug crystals, a gold demon bug was spat out, too. Its body was half-melted, and its organs were even oozing out in places. It struggled on the ground, writhing around. It looked as if it would give up the ghost at any second.

“Thanks.” Han Sen was absolutely thrilled. He used his Ghost Teet Knife to slash the gold demon bug king. He mumbled to himself, “Give me a beast soul. Give me a beast soul! Even if your Demon Bug King beast soul is the same, it’d still be the best beast soul to have. I can give one to my wife and kids. I could hand them out, one each. And then, they could survive anything. Only a deified elite might pose a threat.”
