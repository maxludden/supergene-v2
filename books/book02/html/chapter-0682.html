    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t feel too disappointed. His heart had been preparing
      for this dreary result. After all, the Golden Roarer spat it out to him
      way back when, and this one had been dug out of the corpse of a dead super
      creature like all the rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not sure what generation the Golden Roarer belonged to, so
      there was still some uncertainty there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hadn&#8217;t really expected licking it to work. He was just
      trying his luck. If it worked, that would have been great. But if it
      didn&#8217;t, it was half-expected anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen held onto the bone Life Geno essence and then used the Dongxuan
      Sutra to simulate the bone elephant&#8217;s flow. That thundering power
      rumbled across the insides of his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, he felt the Life Geno essence in his hands begin to follow the
      flow of the energy inside him. A rhythmic beat developed, and it followed
      every note and jump of the energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This made Han Sen very happy, and he knew he had stumbled onto the correct
      path. He sped up the elephant&#8217;s flow of energy, which made the Life
      Geno essence shake even more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could feel the bone elephant&#8217;s Life Geno essence provide him
      with a strange, foreign power. It seemed as if it was going to follow Han
      Sen&#8217;s own energy and burst out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen simulated the bone elephant&#8217;s energy flow again, but the
      energy inside the Life Geno essence did not burst out. He stuck his tongue
      out and licked the Life Geno essence again, but it did not melt.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I can activate the Life Geno essence, why can I not eat
      it?&#8221; Han Sen frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen knew he was on the right path, and progress was being made.
      Otherwise, why would it have become active the way it did? He simply could
      not observe it because his simulation of the elephant was not powerful
      enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, his Dongxuan Sutra had not yet broken the first tier. It could
      not simulate things 1:1, and there were a few minor differences from the
      original creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like I need to finish up my first tier of the Dongxuan
      Sutra. If I unlock the gene lock, I should be able to simulate the bone
      elephant&#8217;s energy flow perfectly. If I do that, I must be able to
      absorb the Life Geno essence.&#8221; Han Sen believed he had at long last
      cracked the puzzle. He had found the way to absorb a Life Geno essence.
      But for now, he still had to find a way to practice and finish up his
      Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      He wanted to speed up his training of the Dongxuan Sutra, and his best
      chance at doing that was with the peaches from the mystic peach tree.
      Perhaps in two months, the peaches would ripen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the super creatures in the Peach Forest, like the pink snake, might
      prove an obstacle, and Han Sen was unsure whether or not he could steal
      from them â€“ again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If this is the way it has to be, then that means I have to absorb
      the second or third generation Life Geno essences of super creatures. And
      before I kill them, I must have an understanding of their energy flow. If
      I don&#8217;t get a grasp of that, there&#8217;s no point in killing them.
      And to kill a first generation creature? Well&#8230; that would be even
      more pointless.&#8221; Han Sen furrowed his brow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the first generation Life Geno essences must possess another
      method of absorption, Han Sen had already had one breakthrough for the
      day. For now, he would focus on what he had just figured out before
      working on the next conundrum.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen wanted to look for a second generation super creature to spit
      out a Life Geno essence for him, such luck wouldn&#8217;t strike for
      another thousand years, most likely. As much as he would have liked it,
      Han Sen did not expect this to happen again during his tenure in the
      Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Therefore, Han Sen thought to focus on
      hunting the second or third generations of super creature for now and earn
      the points he wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Should I kill the silver fox and eat his flesh? That guy is
      definitely a second generation super creature.&#8221; Han Sen wore an evil
      smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it was just a thought, nothing more. There were many second generation
      super creatures out there in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, just
      waiting to be found. It would not be necessary for him to kill the silver
      fox, and as the fox had been a diligent pet for so long, he&#8217;d feel
      terrible doing that.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was the little black cub, though. But if he wanted to go after that
      super creature, it&#8217;d be two on one. That would be too much for him
      to handle.
    </p>

    <p>Red pony?</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought back to the legion of pegasi and the wolf pack that aided
      each other, then quickly dropped that thought, as well.
    </p>

    <p>Eight small snow-turtles?</p>

    <p>
      He didn&#8217;t even need to think about that one. He would be better off
      taking a suicide pill than going up against a family of super creatures.
      Han Sen felt chilled just thinking about the nine super creatures there.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like I need to get out there and look for more solo second
      generation super creatures,&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself, as he
      stroked his jaw.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen was perusing the various chambers and hallways of his mind,
      the angel had finally finished her meal. She returned to the Sea of Soul,
      and that was when Han Sen saw the angel shine with neon lights. She had
      evolved into her battle variant.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;She&#8217;s evolving! My super battle pet is born, yay! Fighting
      super creatures should be much easier from this day onwards.&#8221; Han
      Sen was beaming with delight.
    </p>

    <p>
      He quickly left the Peach Forest, not wanting to stay there any longer
      than he had to. The next time he returned, he decided, would be when the
      peaches were ripe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that Han Sen knew how to absorb Life Geno essences, and his angel was
      going to be born anew, it&#8217;d be easier for him to nab a peach from
      the giant, mystic peach tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      The angel would most likely finish her evolution before they were ripe, as
      well. With a super fighter like that at his side, Han Sen was sure that he
      could grab at least one peach for himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the shelter, Han Sen was no longer in a rush to return to the
      Icefield. He brought Su Xiaoqiao and Qi Wenzhao out to kill some more
      creatures. He wanted to train and push their survival abilities here in
      the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, allow the angel to finish her evolution,
      and wait for the peaches to ripen in the Peach Forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Long, we are ready. Should we head out now?&#8221; In a
      royal shelter to the north, Cheng Yulang excitedly reported to Huang
      Yunlong.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Have your preparations been double-checked? Have you confirmed that
      the Life Geno essence is on Han Sen&#8217;s person?&#8221; Huang Yunlong
      squinted, emitting a sinister, evil aura.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huang Yunlong had been a king of the north for sixty years. His wealth was
      practically unlimited, and his strength far exceeded the capabilities of
      Lu Hui, who had only become famous a few years before. He had many strong
      subordinates, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Out intel is not incorrect. It cannot be. Those we have planted in
      the Goddess Shelter have seen it, and they have seen Han Sen carry it
      around with him. He has not absorbed it yet,&#8221; Cheng Yulang said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good. Rally all our troops. I am going to relieve Han Sen of the
      Life Geno essence.&#8221; Huang Yunlong&#8217;s eyes were full of cruelty.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do not worry, Brother Long. This time, we will all strike together.
      With a dozen elites who have unlocked their gene lock, and with your help,
      Han Sen will be very, very dead.&#8221; Cheng Yulang gave many confident
      nods as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Remember; try to cover our tracks as best as you can. We cannot
      allow anyone to know we have vacated our northern premises for a time. We
      cannot afford to spook him,&#8221; Huang Yunlong said, as he continued to
      squint.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have made arrangements; even Lu Hui won&#8217;t expect us to be
      there. By the time he suspects something is afoot, we will already have
      killed Han Sen and taken his Life Geno essence.&#8221; Cheng Yulang
      laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s head out.&#8221; Huang Yunlong trusted Cheng
      Yulang&#8217;s abilities fully, for he had never disappointed him once
      across the years.
