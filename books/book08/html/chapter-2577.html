<p>When Han Sen looked closer, he realized that the circles around
the snake king’s neck weren’t actually eyes; they were six spinning
cogwheels. He didn’t know what the six cogwheels did, though.</p>
<p>“Quickly, we must go!” Li Keer shouted at Han Sen. She was on
the verge of using God’s Wander to escape that place.</p>
<p>But before she could teleport away, she saw that the space
around her had already been turned on its head. The entire universe
appeared to be spinning like a hungry vortex.</p>
<p>Han Sen also tried to teleport away, but he found that he
couldn’t tear space and escape through it like he would need to. It
was like he had lost his connection to the outside world.</p>
<p>“Oh no! We’re trapped in Six Space. In this Six Space, all of
space follows the rules set by the Six Core God Snake. Your space
powers won’t be of any use here.” Li Keer was in shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t frightened by this enemy, though. He noticed that
the Six Core God Snake was looking steadily at his head. Clearly,
it was after the small Crocodile God.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God was very young, and it didn’t yet know
what fear meant. Seeing the Six Core God Snake look at it, the
little creature simply stared back. It then roared proudly at the
Six Core God Snake.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the small Crocodile God commanding the snake to
follow and be its little brother.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake appeared to understand, and it screamed
back with immense rage. It opened its mouth and unleashed some
space substance chains. They flew toward the small Crocodile God
like an aurora trailing through space.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly evaded them, and the small Crocodile God flew
forward. In all its boisterous glory, it fancied taking on the Six
Core God Snake all by itself. It wanted to teach the huge creature
a lesson.</p>
<p>It made this decision because of Han Sen’s constant compliments,
no doubt. Han Sen had been going on and on about how powerful and
almighty the small Crocodile God was. He had filled the creature’s
head with nonsense, as if it was the strongest creature in
existence. He had even claimed that every race would treat it like
a god. He said people would admire and show great love to the
little crocodile. He said every creature would want to become its
subordinate.</p>
<p>The poor, naive little Crocodile God thought its mother was the
most people being in the universe, and that it was number two. It
thought all other creatures were tiny by comparison, so it wasn’t
going to stand for the Six Core God Snake’s offense.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t run far before coming to a stop. He wanted to
watch the fight between the snake and crocodile.</p>
<p>“Run! The small Crocodile God isn’t a worthy opponent for the
Six Core God Snake. We should leave now before it is too late,”
Exquisite said, flying over to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“The small Crocodile God’s power should be as good as a
primitive deified here, right? Can anything else in the core area
be stronger than it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“The Six Core God Snake is one of the strongest xenogeneics in
the core area,” Li Keer explained. “The snake isn’t as strong as
the big Crocodile God, but it is as good as a primitive can get.
Plus, its space powers are so strong, and in addition to the
fighting experience it has compared to the little Crocodile God…
Well, the newborn Crocodile God doesn’t really stand a chance of
fighting back.”</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>What Li Keer said immediately came true. There was a loud noise,
and when Han Sen turned to take a look, he saw that the little
Crocodile God had been sent flying away by the Six Core God Snake.
The little creature rolled end over end through space. It
eventually hit a planet, and the planet blew up.</p>
<p>“So strong!” Han Sen thought in shock. He took the bronze
furnace with him as he flew away. The space around them was under
the snake’s control, so they couldn’t teleport away. Even Exquisite
and Li Keer were forced to fly away instead of teleporting.</p>
<p>The space behind them seemed to groan with a strange sound. Han
Sen couldn’t help but look back. There, he saw that the small
Crocodile God’s face was swollen and discolored. It started to cry.
Its small eyes were streaming with tears.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, little Crocodile God. You can’t beat him, and
neither can I. At least you are a deified xenogeneic. You should
just run while you still have the chance to. Don’t take it out on
me. We aren’t being cruel, here. You took us as hostages, remember?
We are enemies,” Han Sen said over his shoulder as he flew.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed the Very High women as they flew away, but some
unexpected pangs of regret were striking Han Sen’s heart. He
thought that the teary eyes of the small Crocodile God were meant
for him.</p>
<p>“So… why did the Six Core God Snake want to kill the small
Crocodile God?” Han Sen asked Li Keer as he continued flying.</p>
<p>“The Six Core God Snake is one of the rare core xenogeneics that
can evolve. Its name wasn’t always Six Core God Snake. It used to
be known as the Two Core God Snake. Its neck only had two cogwheels
back then. Whenever it eats a deified core gene, it can create
another cogwheel, and its power increases. It now has six cores,
and so the power it has should make it the most powerful primitive
deified out there. Plus, it has scary space powers. It isn’t like
the Gold Armor General or those other core deified xenogeneics,” Li
Keer explained.</p>
<p>“Does the Six Core God Snake have a weakness?” Han Sen asked
with a frown.</p>
<p>“It does. Its power is very strong, but core xenogeneics always
have flaws. The same applies to the Six Core God Snake. Its
weakness is those cogwheels. Four of them were obtained by eating
four other deified xenogeneics. They aren’t as good as the
creature’s original cogwheels. That is its weakness,” Li Keer
said.</p>
<p>“You guys should go on ahead,” Han Sen said. Then, he suddenly
flew back.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Li Keer and Exquisite asked in confusion.
They weren’t quite sure what Han Sen was planning.</p>
<p>“You guys should leave now. I’m going back to watch,” Han Sen
said. He felt something weird in his heart, and so he decided to go
back.</p>
<p>“Is he going to save that small Crocodile God?” Li Keer watched
Han Sen leave. She couldn’t believe that what she said was actually
happening.</p>
<p>“He is controlled by his emotions way too much. He will be at a
constant disadvantage like that. While his talents are exceptional,
he is too dangerous to take on as a silkworm,” Exquisite said
emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“But if I was trapped and couldn’t fight back, I wish there was
someone out there driven by an emotion that made them want to save
me,” Li Keer said with a conflicted expression.</p>
<p>“Everything must die. With an attitude like that, your practice
with the Very High Sense will not go very far.” Exquisite
frowned.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God had been captured by space substance
chains. It hung in space, unable to move. Thankfully, its body was
too strong for the chains to dig into its scaled flesh. The space
substance kept hitting it, but the blows could only make the small
creature bleed.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake was staring down at the small Crocodile
God like a hungry demon. Its substance chains kept raging, lashing
the little creature over and over.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God continued to cry out as more and more
bloody wounds appeared across its body.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God’s powers weren’t enough to break the
space substance chains. It was unable to avoid the hits. It was
just hanging where it was, being lashed over and over. Streaks of
blood ran down its body. Although it wasn’t heavily injured, it was
in agony. Its tears streamed off its face to fall like droplets of
rain.</p>
