<p>In Space Garden, Human King walked alone and approached the
remnants of a collapsed house.</p>
<p>“Roo!” Ji Yanran and a bunch of pets were stuck inside that
house. Golden Growler did not seem to be completely frozen. He
stopped before Ji Yanran and looked at Human King, who was coming.
He made some roaring and hostile sounds to stay his approach. It
was like he was warning Human King not to enter the small
garden.</p>
<p>“This really is unique.” Human King looked at Golden Growler. He
walked to the little yard.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Golden Growler appeared to be a little afraid of this
new nemesis, but he still managed to roar threateningly and allow a
door to rise up from out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Although he was not completely frozen, because of the effect of
Human King’s power, Golden Growler’s motions were very slow. The
golden door came out of his mouth very slowly, and it was presented
before Human King to block him.</p>
<p>“Is that it?” Human King looked at the golden door strangely. He
did not plan on doing anything</p>
<p>In fact, if Human King moved first, Golden Growler would not
have been able to spit out the golden door in the first place. He
would have been instantly killed.</p>
<p>The golden door had yet to open. Human King became annoyed. His
heart jumped, and Golden Growler returned to normal. He was not
affected by the power anymore. “Roar!” Golden Growler was trying to
open the golden door, but his body was returning to normal. The
golden door was now slightly ajar.</p>
<p>The sunset-like gold light came out from the door and shone on
Human King.</p>
<p>When Human King saw the gold light, he raised his hand to hide
his face. That gold light was like a small laser going across his
body. Suddenly, his black crystal armor had a golden burn scorched
right into it. That golden burn mark was expanding. It looked like
it was going to burn right through the black crystal armor.</p>
<p>Feeling the black crystal armor’s painful feelings, Human King’s
eyes flashed wildly. He looked conflicted, as he stared at the open
golden door. “This power… It feels like the power I felt before.
When the door opens, is that the place?”</p>
<p>The angle of the golden door opened more and more. The beam of
light became bigger and bigger. Human King stood before the golden
light with his black crystal armor melting away. He was fading
away.</p>
<p>Wherever the gold light shone, the light turned into
nothingness. Nothing could even survive it.</p>
<p>Human King’s eyes flashed. Behind his hands, he looked at the
golden door. The gold light was very shiny. Even with his sense of
vision, he could not see what might have been inside.</p>
<p>Seeing the black crystal armor about to be destroyed, Human King
realized he could no longer watch it. He wanted to get out and away
from the golden light.</p>
<p>Human King discovered that his body had been bound by that
golden light. In a flabbergasting, totally unexpected turn of
events, he discovered he was unable to teleport away from this wild
force of light.</p>
<p>He was shocked. He could not quite believe it. He could not
fathom a power was capable of doing this to him. He knew he had to
act fast, so he put an end to his hesitation. He moved his body as
only he could. Through that movement, he went behind the golden
light.</p>
<p>Under the pressure of the gold light, not even an elite like
Human King could move and break free. Even his black crystal armor
had been wholly damaged by the golden light. In those parts across
the armor that were receiving the light, there were scorch marks,
dents, and holes all burned into the armor. Big chunks of it had
been seared away.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Golden Growler roared again. The golden door moved when
Human King did. It kept him snared, not permitting Human King to
escape the beam of light it shone on him.</p>
<p>Human King frowned a little. He moved his will again. Suddenly,
the power of the sky and the power of the ground gathered up.
Golden Growler’s power was affected, and he started to move slowly
again.</p>
<p>The golden door’s speed slowed down. Human King quickly emerged
from the area of golden light.</p>
<p>Now, the black crystal armor on Human King’s body was smoking
white. Some places on him were burned. A black mark was left on
Human King’s body. It seemed as if only a little more time was
needed before Human King’s body was incinerated.</p>
<p>More shockingly than that, the geno prototype armor, which could
usually recover in a jiffy, was not recovering itself quickly at
all. When Human King walked away, it was still smoking white. Some
spots on it were still burning. It was like the golden light’s
power was still there and unwilling to fade away.</p>
<p>“This must be the heir of a Growler, but the Growlers should not
have this power. Does this mixed Growler have something special
about it? Is it in his bloodline? Aside from the genes of a
Growler, what other genes could it possibly possess?” Human King
looked at Golden Growler weirdly. He kept thinking about it. With
his naked eyes, he could not tell which genes the Golden Growler
might have also possessed in its blood.</p>
<p>“Never mind. Let me take it back and research it.” Human King
teleported in front of Golden Growler. He held Golden Growler’s
head.</p>
<p>Golden Growler wished to scream, but he passed out before he
could do anything about it. The small golden door that was
previously open was now gone. Although Human King wished to see
what lurked beyond the golden door, his body could not withstand
the gold light that seeped out of it. Entering it seemed as if it
might be impossible. He would have to bring Golden Growler back
with him first.</p>
<p>He knocked out Golden Growler. Human King then looked at Ling’er
and Ji Yanran and said to himself, “Since I am already here, I
might as well take these with me too. God Chaos Party never had a
threat that was grand enough to challenge the rule of the geno
hall. It only makes sense. If we cannot do this small thing, the
God Chaos Party will surely not survive.”</p>
<p>After that, Human King walked up to Ji Yanran. It only took him
two steps to reach her position. He put out his hand with the
intent to capture Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>At that moment, Human King was instantly shocked. He saw a white
light in Ji Yanran’s chest. A transparent hand suddenly landed on
her chest.</p>
<p>Human King’s pupils became smaller. He felt his soul tremble. He
stumbled back and spit out some blood. He had absorbed Qin Xiu’s
soul and flesh. He had taken his power for himself. The flesh power
was easier to combine with, but the soul power had not been
obtained completely just yet.</p>
<p>That palm was a pure soul attack. It made Human King’s soul
shake. The soul that had almost finished combining was nearly
shattered.</p>
<p>The voice of an angry child sounded. “Don’t you dare bully
Little Gold Gold and my Mom!”</p>
<p>Human King saw who had hit him, and it gave him a shock. It was
Han Sen and Ji Yanran’s daughter.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er’s body was like a holy light. She was like a holy
God Spirit. One could not distinguish the presence of any actual
flesh.</p>
<p>“Why would Han Sen have a God Spirit daughter? Is this Han
Ling’er the same as Han Bao’er? Are they from elsewhere?” Human
King wondered.</p>
