    <p>
      There were a lot of negatives associated with the &#8220;Dual&#8221; sword
      skill, and they created problems that would arise during combat. This made
      Han Sen realize that creating a sword skill was no easy task.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen had no other choice. Any new sword skill creation required
      vigorous combat testing, so he had to be patient and make a note of every
      flaw he noticed during battle, in order to rectify and improve later.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there were any mistakes, he was free to make changes now, but if a
      problem arose during a real field of battle, the price for such a mistake
      would be paid in his own blood. Knowing this, Han Sen was in no rush.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued to improve over time as he tried to perfect the
      dual-blade sword skill. Today Han Sen had visited the shelter again. Li
      Xing Lun was there and found him, wearing a strange facial expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, I found a Humanoid sacred-blood fused transfigured beast
      soul.&#8221; Li Xing Lun&#8217;s tone of voice was also somewhat strange.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Is its owner willing to trade?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun did not answer directly, instead saying, &#8220;Earlier, I
      sent out word that a friend was willing to swap a Berserk beast soul for a
      Humanoid beast soul. Although many people wanted to trade, and many people
      called me, Humanoid transfigured beast souls were too rare and no-one was
      willing or able to make a trade like that.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun paused for a moment, then continued. &quot;Yesterday, Blackgod
      contacted me. He said he wanted to use an Egregore soul to trade for your
      Berserk beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Does he really have an Egregore soul?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I looked. It is a sacred-blood class Snow-Lady beast soul. The
      abilities of the Snow-Lady beast soul are quite special. It does not
      increase one&#8217;s strength, just one&#8217;s speed. It also has the
      ability to reduce one&#8217;s temperature, but that seems rather useless
      to me. It would most likely just become a problem. I don&#8217;t think
      it&#8217;s worth trading a Berserk beast soul for a Snow-Lady beast soul.
      Plus, you had argued with Blackgod before,&#8221; Li Xing Lun said
      severely.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did you say that it was me who wanted to trade?&#8221; Han Sen
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, I only said that it was a friend.&#8221; Li Xing Lun shook his
      head as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought for a moment about what to say, then said,
      &#8220;That&#8217;s okay - feel free to tell him it&#8217;s me who wants
      to trade. If he is willing, tell him to come here so we can complete the
      transaction.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Speed was what Han Sen needed most right now. The strongest aspect of the
      Twin Spirit&#8217;s power was their speed. If he was able to match with
      their speed and break their sword skill, the battle would be much easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      And combined with the beast soul&#8217;s ability to lower the body&#8217;s
      temperature, for Han Sen, there was an absence of negatives. The
      &#8220;Jadeskin&#8221; skill worked even better in a cold environment, so
      not only was it of no detriment to Han Sen, it was an outright benefit.
    </p>

    <p>
      For others, this would have been a debilitating attribute, but Han Sen
      would be glad to receive it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides, to find a Humanoid sacred-blood beast soul was extremely
      difficult in the ice fields. It was good to be able to trade a Snow-Lady
      beast soul, which was not too far from a Humanoid beast soul. Han Sen was
      satisfied at the proposal of this trade.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You really want to make this trade with Blackgod?&#8221; Li Xing
      Lun asked. &#8220;You really have to consider this well. If you trade your
      Berserk beast soul with Blackgod, he may use it against you in the
      future.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen laughed. &#8220;Thank you for your concern,&#8221; he said.
      &#8220;If I am willing to trade this with him, of course I am not afraid
      of his ownership of the beast soul.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, then. Did you bring the beast soul? Tell me about your
      situation and I will talk to Blackgod,&#8221; Li Xing Lun smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past few days, Han Sen had already raised the Inferno Bull into a
      Berserk beast soul. When he summoned it, it combined with his body to
      become a black-winged bull.
    </p>

    <p>
      He told the specific attributes of the Inferno Bull to Li Xing Lun, all
      the while muttering, &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame&#8221;. A beast soul that
      was able to greatly increase one&#8217;s strength and which provided the
      ability of flight was much stronger than the Snow-Lady of Blackgod; one
      which appeared to be inherently flawed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Snow-Lady beast soul, aside from being Humanoid and providing a
      passable speed boost, did not appear to be anything special. The ability
      to lower one&#8217;s own temperature seemed pointless and stupid.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen insisted on making the trade, so Li Xing Lun went off to talk
      with Blackgod.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen waited a day. On the second day he went to the shelter. Li Xing
      Lun was there and he had already spoken to Blackgod. Aside from the
      Snow-Lady, Li Xing Lun had managed to bargain for an additional two Mutant
      beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Brother Lun. But for those two Mutant beast souls, we
      should share them. Let&#8217;s take one each.&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Li Xing Lun did not want any, no matter what. He only told Han Sen
      that after the saving of the Starwheel Shelter, it was an honor to help.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was time to trade with Blackgod. Blackgod had brought people with him
      to the Starwheel Shelter. He noticed that Han Sen&#8217;s eyes were a
      little cold, but of this he made no mention.
    </p>

    <p>
      After they both observed the beast souls they were to receive, they handed
      their own over to Li Xing Lun. Then Li Xing Lun completed the trade by
      handing the beast souls over to their new owners. The transaction was
      smooth and without incident.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen received the two Mutant beast souls and Snow-Lady beast soul. He
      looked them over to ensure no mistakes had been made, and while he was
      getting ready to bid Li Xing Lun farewell, Blackgod called to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod looked at Han Sen with disdain, and coldly said, &#8220;Han Sen,
      you dare gamble with me? Perhaps now we can settle our grudge.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Han Sen furrowed his eyebrows in response.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You and I engage in battle. Regardless of who wins or loses, our
      grudge can be settled.&#8221; Blackgod looked at Han Sen and continued,
      &#8220;Of course, if you do lose, you must leave behind the Snow-Lady
      beast soul. If I lose, however, I can leave behind the Inferno Bull beast
      soul.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun frowned and said, &#8220;Blackgod, we only want to exchange
      beast souls on this day. Nothing else.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am merely suggesting a solution to our grudge. It is entirely up
      to him if he wants to partake in my idea. If he does not dare to engage me
      in battle, that is fine,&#8221; Blackgod said sternly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What if I do not wish to gamble?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Blackgod
      as he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you do not wish to settle our prolonged dispute, then you will
      become my enemy. And I do not go soft on those I deem to be my
      enemy.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The few people who had accompanied Blackgod now summoned their beast
      souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Blackgod, this is the Starwheel Shelter. This is not Blackgod
      Shelter.&#8221; Li Xing Lun&#8217;s eyes went cold, and he summoned a few
      leaders from the Starwheel Shelter to push back against Blackgod&#8217;s
      people.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Li Xing Lun, this is about me and Han Sen. This is none of your
      business.&#8221; Blackgod furrowed his brow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am the notary of the exchange; I do not care for your grudge with
      Han Sen, but in my Starwheel Shelter, none can lay a finger on him.&#8221;
      Li Xing Lun&#8217;s eyes were firm, hesitation and the desire to hold back
      entirely absent from them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Li Xing Lun, do you really want to offend me on the behalf of a
      person who doesn&#8217;t even matter?&#8221; Blackgod looked at Li Xing
      Lun sternly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen saved me when the Starwheel Shelter was in crisis. He is my
      savior; no one can do him any harm before me.&#8221; Li Xing Lun said
      these words directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod&#8217;s emotion began to change, the atmosphere inside the
      Shelter growing tense. It was like a room that was packed to the brim with
      explosives, where the presence of a single spark would be enough to ignite
      the volatile atmosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is okay to have a one-on-one, but the beast souls that we gamble
      must be held onto by Li Xing Lun.&#8221; Han Sen said all of a sudden.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is no problem.&#8221; Blackgod agreed to the terms, as he knew
      all about Li Xing Lun&#8217;s identity. He knew he was not the sort to
      accept the beast souls and make a run for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was also the fact that Blackgod&#8217;s purpose there was not merely
      to win a beast soul - he wanted Han Sen&#8217;s life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had stolen the Snake Fish King in the past and used a poison
      dagger to hurt him. This had almost taken Blackgod&#8217;s life, and was
      the cause of the anger that he could never find it in himself to swallow.
