<p>“Where are the items you sucked into it? Can I see them?” Han
Sen asked Bao’er happily.</p>
<p>They were digested a long time ago,” Bao’er said, blinking
again.</p>
<p>Han Sen was speechless, and so he asked, “You just said you
could release them.”</p>
<p>Bao’er seemed a little indignant. “I can, but I have to know
that they need to be saved. Otherwise, they will be digested by the
gourd.”</p>
<p>“Bao’er’s little gourd might be able to catch that red cloud.
But Bao’er has been in the sanctuary all this time, and I have yet
to see her evolve. She can’t be any greater than a Baron. There is
no way she can absorb that Marquise red cloud,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>Bao’er seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking. She
clapped her hands and the shiny gourd appeared between them. She
said to Han Sen, “Dad, what would you like to claim? My gourd is
powerful, and it can absorb anything.”</p>
<p>“I will tell you another time.” Han Sen touched Bao’er on the
head, then teleported back to his Jade Island in Sky Palace. Han
Sen wanted to find a chance to bring Bao’er there, so he could try
out her gourd powers.</p>
<p>Bao’er had eaten many of the xenogeneic genes Han Sen had given
her, but she still wasn’t getting pushed out by the sanctuary.
Because of that, she couldn’t be too strong.</p>
<p>Han Sen cooked a xenogeneic material in a pot. The xenogeneic
gene was almost too big to fit in the pot, but he choked it all
down anyway and heard the announcement.</p>
<p>“Marquise Gene +1”</p>
<p>The pot of meat must have weighed at least one hundred
kilograms. Although Han Sen had the ability of Consume, it still
made him uncomfortable to eat all that at once. He gave up on
eating for the evening.</p>
<p>“It looks like it’s better to stick to smaller xenogeneic
genes.” As Han Sen was speaking to himself, someone outside the
island called his name.</p>
<p>Han Sen stepped out. He saw White Real high above, riding a bird
made of wood. When Han Sen stepped outside, White Real brought it
down to land on the island.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, come with me quick!” White Real jumped off the
bird and grabbed Han Sen, pulling him to the creature. “Brother
White, what’s going on?” Han Sen asked, with obvious confusion.</p>
<p>As they mounted, White Real said, “Our leader is inviting you to
Sky Path Garden. He wants you to help us refine the Blood Feather
Knife.”</p>
<p>“He’s asking me to help? I’m no good with that sort of thing.
What am I supposed to do?” Han Sen was shocked. Surely the things
he had learned couldn’t compare to the combined minds that already
worked in Sky Path Garden.</p>
<p>If Bai Yishan was there, perhaps he could make worthwhile
contributions to their research. Han Sen knew some things, but not
to that level.</p>
<p>Plus, there was a big difference between the geno arts of the
sanctuary and the geno arts of the geno universe. They couldn’t
really be talked about as if they were the same thing.</p>
<p>The geno arts Han Sen had in the sanctuaries were edited, and
they were different from their geno universe equivalents. He also
had to refine xenogeneic treasures to make them work.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, don’t be so humble! You were able to remove the
xenogeneic blood from the knife. You are good at this. Let’s go.
The leader and the others are waiting for you.” White Real pushed
Han Sen atop the wooden bird, and then they took off towards Sky
Path Garden.</p>
<p>When they arrived, Han Sen explained to them that he had only
been able to remove the xenogeneic blood because his geno art was
compatible with it. Han Sen did not know how to refine a xenogeneic
treasure or craft a deified treasure.</p>
<p>The head researcher smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Han Sen. We
have invited you here so you can be a part of the refinement
process. If we find some leftover blood while we are refining it’
we will require your assistance. Otherwise, our work will be
wasted.”</p>
<p>Han Sen told them there was not a single drop of blood left, but
the elders that worked with the leader were worried that there
might still have been some. So, they asked him to stay.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Sky Path Garden did not ask anything more of him.
Han Sen just sat in the refinement room, listening to the commands
issued by the head researcher.</p>
<p>Han Sen had nothing to do, so he practiced with his Jadeskin. He
also watched the refinement process for the Blood Feather Knife. He
learned a lot.</p>
<p>The Blood Feather Knife was placed inside a crystal container.
Han Sen thought they’d use blacksmithing techniques and fire to
change the blade.</p>
<p>He was wrong. There wasn’t even the slightest spark.</p>
<p>The white feather knife was placed in a container. They cleansed
the container, put the knife inside, and removed all the air within
it. Then they lowered the temperature as far as they could.</p>
<p>As the temperature dropped, the Blood Feather Knife looked like
it was being crystallized. In the end, the entire knife appeared to
be entirely crystal, just like the container itself.</p>
<p>One of Sky Path Garden’s teachers used an instrument to check
the Blood Feather Knife and frowned. “The temperature is not low
enough. We cannot activate the power of the Blood Feather
Knife.”</p>
<p>Han Sen, after four days of being there, had heard the same
thing a thousand times. They tried to lower the knife’s
temperature, but they could never hit the depths they required.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know why they wanted to lower the temperature,
but he saw a lot of secret cold element geno arts.</p>
<p>They were really scary. Other materials would crumble easily at
such temperatures, but the knife seemed just fine.</p>
<p>That crystal container is impressive. It can endure such
incredible cold without breaking,” Han Sen said quietly to
himself.</p>
<p>White Real’s ears were sharp, though. He heard Han Sen’s
statement and said proudly, “Brother Han, you are right! The
container is good. This is the only deified item that belongs to
Sky Path Garden.”</p>
<p>“That thing is deified?” Han Sen was shocked to hear this. He
knew it was very durable, but he never expected it to be
deified.</p>
<p>“Its name is Absolute Container, and it has a whole lot of uses.
Many of our high-tier treasures are refined inside it. Half of the
King class weapons in Sky Palace were made in there,” White Real
said seriously.</p>
<p>Han Sen started to ask something else, but the head researcher
spoke glumly. “It looks like our power isn’t enough to reduce the
item’s temperature to what the knife needs. Old Dong, please go to
White Jade City and invite him to join us.”</p>
<p>“Will he come?” Old Dong looked depressed.</p>
