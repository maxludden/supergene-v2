<p>Feng Fei Fei was not going to let something so insignificant
annoy her, but she still wanted to test Han Sen’s mind. She put a
drop of mysterious power into her singing. It was the phoenix voice
from the holy phoenix. The grudge between Han Sen and Gong Shu Jin
was something no one knew more about than Feng Fei Fei. Now, Gong
Shu Jin had died. Although it was only a speculated rumor, Feng Fei
Fei was suspicious about Han Sen’s involvement.</p>
<p>She supposed it had something to do with Han Sen, but she did
not want to believe it. Seeing Han Sen there, she decided she might
as well use her voice to test his fortitude. She wanted to know if
Han Sen was telling the truth and if he had the power to murder
Gong Shu Jin.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei was very good with voice and sonic powers. She
controlled them well. It was no wonder she was one of the three top
singers of the Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>She put the phoenix sound power into her voice. As she did so,
people believed she was starting to sound better than ever. Han Sen
felt as if there was some scary sonic power suppressing him. It was
like thunder exploding in his ear. It was like the sound of booming
thunder that existed between the sky and the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He looked around. Everyone was still
enthusiastically enjoying the performance. They did not feel what
he was feeling. He knew Feng Fei Fei must have only been doing it
to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move. The sound was unbearable. It would have
been utterly frightening to other people, but Han Sen was able to
completely ignore it. All he had to do was focus, and the sound
became as quiet as a mosquito. He did not even need a gene race to
fight it.</p>
<p>When Feng Fei Fei witnessed Han Sen display no reaction, and he
even had the audacity to wink at her, she was shocked. She really
wanted to win.</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>She increased the phoenix sound power. It was in her voice. It
was like the sound of a phoenix on cloud nine. It started to break
the sky. It was like it was going to draw Han Sen into a
vortex.</p>
<p>Other people could not hear it at all. Even Bald Guy, who was
next to Han Sen, had no such feelings. He still looked drunk in the
pleasure of hearing Feng Fei Fei’s voice.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked as if he did not feel anything either. Although
he heard the sounds, the sounds did not affect him in the
least.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei saw Han Sen smiling at her. For some reason, she
felt as if the smile was extra spiteful. She powered up the phoenix
sound power.</p>
<p>SO</p>
<p>No matter how far Feng Fei Fei increased the phoenix sound
power, Han Sen shrugged it off as if he did not hear it. He just
kept smiling at her, which made Feng Fei Fei believe her phoenix
sound power might have a problem.</p>
<p>The song was almost over, but she was still unable to affect Han
Sen. It triggered Feng Fei Fei’s desire to win even more.</p>
<p>When she sang the last sentence, Feng Fei Fei used the holy
phoenix and combined with her gene skill Phoenixes Cry
Together.</p>
<p>The sonic power of the Phoenixes Cry Together was able to break
platinum. Although Feng Fei Fei did not try her best, she could no
longer hide her sonic powers. Even her voice started to sound
weird.</p>
<p>At this time, many true elites noticed Feng Fei Fei’s voice was
a bit strange. They frowned. They looked at Han Sen, who was
getting attacked by the center point of that Phoenixes Cry Together
part.</p>
<p>Han Sen behaved as if he could not hear the scary shockwaves. He
let the sound wash over him and sat unaffected. He smiled at Feng
Fei Fei.</p>
<p>Bald Guy, who was sitting next to him, now had to plant his
hands on his ears. He looked as if he was in intense agony. He was
sitting too close to Han Sen, so he was suffering its effect.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Feng Fei Fei was one of the three top singers. A
scary power like that was still something she was able to hide very
well. The power was not strong enough to damage Bald Guy.</p>
<p>By doing that, everyone’s attention now turned to Han Sen. He
and Bald Guy had suddenly become the focus of attention.</p>
<p>Everyone held their hurting ears. They looked at Bald Guy, but
the people that realized that the problem was Han Sen. He was
behaving extremely chill.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei, the professional singer, was using Phoenixes Cry
Together to deal with a person who was attending her birthday
party. Everyone was interested in who this individual was.</p>
<p>Mister God One was looking at Han Sen thinking of something. He
smiled.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei knew it was a bit too much this time, but she could
still see that smile on his face. It was so annoyingly wretched
that it made her feel awful.</p>
<p>“If I knew that, I would have tried my hardest with Phoenixes
Cry Together on the final sentence of the song,” Feng Fei Fei
thought. The power of Phoenixes Cry Together was incredibly strong.
If she had tried her hardest, the entire arena would have been
affected. At the end of the day, that wouldn’t have been what she
wanted.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday, Auntie.”</p>
<p>After Feng Fei Fei sang the song, a pretty little girl
approached the stage with a birthday cake in her hands. She walked
in front of Feng Fei Fei.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw the little girl, he was given a fright. His
pupils went smaller, and the corner of his eyes became teary.</p>
<p>That little girl was only five or six years old, but she looked
just like Xiang Yin. It was like a child version of Xiang Yin.</p>
<p>“Impossible! Does that mean Xiang Yin died and was reborn here?”
Han Sen looked at the little girl and felt his eyes become
blurry.</p>
<p>He thought about what he had been through with Xiang Yin and how
nice she had treated him. He felt as if his heart had been cut.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen could not confirm the little girl was the
reborn Xiang Yin, he had not heard about her for many years. Thus,
she probably had already been reborn.</p>
<p>Plus, that little girl looked exactly like Xiang Yin. It was
difficult for Han Sen not to think that way.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Little Yin.” Feng Fei Fei stopped looking at Han
Sen. She squatted down and smiled at the little girl.</p>
<p>“Her name is Little Yin?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart was like iron, but he got sad sometimes. The
touching feelings Xiang Yin evoked was something he had never felt
from others.</p>
<p>While everyone was celebrating, Feng Fei Fei blew the candles
out on the cake. It looked like she was everyone’s focus. In Han
Sen’s eyes, the focus was only on the little girl.</p>
<p>“Is she Xiang Yin’s big sister?” Han Sen felt terrible. He did
not know what to feel.</p>
<p>Han Sen was planning to leave early, but he stopped thinking
about doing that now. He wanted to find a chance to interact with
that girl called Little Yin. He wanted to find out if she was
Little Big Sister Xiang Yin.</p>
<p>The little girl remained with Feng Fei Fei, and Feng Fei Fei was
perpetually surrounded by nobles. Han Sen and Bald Guy did not have
what it took to penetrate that circle.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not wait any longer. For the past few years, few
things made his heart jump that fast. Now, his heart was beating
rapidly.</p>
<p>“My little dear, do you want her? Then, go get her. If you are
willing, I can help you. Do not be afraid.” The shadow of the big
sky demon appeared next to Han Sen. It was like she was holding him
from afar whispering into his ears.</p>
