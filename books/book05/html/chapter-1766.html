<p>“What’s with that guy? Could he not understand our language?” Han Sen had encountered rude people before, but none that were rude to that extent.</p>

<p>Hai’er looked bitter and said, “He’ll really do what he said. This is bad.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it If he wanted to kill someone, why would he leave?” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Hai’er shook her head. “The higher races like the Zhenyue wouldn’t bother to kill those of a lesser race themselves. He only needs to give the word, and others will come tripping over each other for the opportunity. It won’t be long before we encounter others who will have come here to kill you in the hopes of obtaining a reward.”</p>

<p>“I am a Baron. It may not be a very high class, but that still makes me a Noble. Don’t say I’m from a lesser race.” Han Sen smiled, not very concerned about their predicament.</p>

<p>“Can’t break the cocoon and become a butterfly without your race being in the geno hall. Even if you become a Duke or a King, you’re still an individual. And you still hail from a lesser race,” Hai’er said.</p>

<p>“What cocoon? And what is the geno hall?” Han Sen asked, confused by her strange metaphors.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ve only heard about it from Old Pirate. I know that if a race doesn’t have a lantern in a geno hall, they cannot leave their names there. And that means they are deemed a lesser race,” Hai’er said quickly. “But this is not the time for talk. Let’s run and leave the xenogeneic space behind. At least that way, you might live.”</p>

<p>Han Sen thought for a moment, but then said, “You should leave. He wants to kill me, and I’m sure I’ll find a way through.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that. If I left, people will think we pirates are afraid of the Zhenyue. I cannot bring us any embarrassment.” Hai’er lifted her chin.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not know what to think. He had been dragged into this by Hai’er, and he thought, “What the hell is going on? I came here to kill xenogeneics and that’s it I haven’t killed any, and I need to be running for my life. My luck is bad. Next time I go hunting, I should really check my fortune or something.”</p>

<p>They hadn’t walked far when they heard footsteps roll up like thunder. A group of people came down from the mountain, headed their way.</p>

<p>Han Sen noticed it was the people they had seen earlier, the group that had slain the six-armed bear. Their leader was the Viscount with the sword.</p>

<p>Hai’er’s face changed. She pulled Han Sen to get him to walk faster, but soon after, a few Barons and other soldiers barred their way. The Viscount caught up, and they were swiftly surrounded.</p>

<p>“Lady of the Pirates, we have come here for him. Please step aside, for we do not want to sully your clothes with blood,” the Viscount politely told Hai’er.</p>

<p>“He’s one of my people. Do you dare touch him?” Hai’er responded coldly.</p>

<p>“My Lady, please don’t do this. If we don’t take him back, we will all die on his behalf.” The Viscount’s speech was very calm, but he had already made his decision. Even if he had to offend Hai’er of the Pirates, he still wanted to claim Han Sen’s life.</p>

<p>Pirates hadn’t entered the Dan Xuan system for seven hundred years. The Zhenyue were a high race of the Dan Xuan system. Although they were not as respected as the Pirates, if the Pirates were looking to cause trouble with the Zhenyue, they would have to go past Holy Heaven.</p>

<p>“If you are not afraid to die, then come! I will kill whoever dares come close!” Hai’er shouted angrily as she brought out her dagger.</p>

<p>“Then, I am sorry. We may not dare to hurt you, but we have to do this.” The Viscount waved his hand, and a few Nobles approached Hai’er. They all had Baron geno weapon shields.</p>

<p>The Viscount pulled out his sword and ran to Han Sen.</p>

<p>In an instant, Han Sen went from standing motionlessly to running like the wind. He ran to the nearby forest.</p>

<p>It was difficult to determine how many teams wanted to kill Han Sen and claim whatever bounty had been offered. He knew he couldn’t kill them all. Some of them would be Viscounts, too, so any fights that ensued would be very tough.</p>

<p>Two Barons tried to stop Han Sen, raising their weapons to block his path. And for this, Han Sen moved in a way that made it look as if he went left and right. The two Barons made a terrible judgment, for one moved left while the other moved right. There was a gap in the middle.</p>

<p>Han Sen went right past them, as both hands beamed with a purple light. And after Han Sen had passed them by, their heads sailed into the sky, trailing blood.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s eyes did not move. He had been through so much, and in battles like this, the loss of life no longer bothered him.</p>

<p>If they wanted to give their lives to Zhenyue, they must have prepared themselves to die.</p>

<p>Even if their lives were threatened by the Zhenyue, that was not a valid reason for killing others. There was no excuse for killing others, just so you could stay alive.</p>

<p>“Come here, scum! Give me your life!” The Viscount was very mad. His longsword was lit with a bright green light, and it slashed right behind Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s mutant blood was boiling inside his body, and with the Dongxuan Armor, it was like he had the strength of a xenogeneic and a Noble all-in-one. He was definitely far stronger than the average Baron, at least.</p>

<p>He moved like a tiger, as a power burst out from his waist. He moved his body half a foot forward, dodging the swordlight.</p>

<p>And as he did so, he slashed with his own Purple-Moon Sword. He did so at an angle the Viscount could not see, which let it strike the man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The sword went in two inches, but it felt to Han Sen as if he had just tried to stab glue. He could not stab the man again, as the sword was stuck inside his shoulder.</p>

<p>The Viscount did not next expect himself to get hurt by a Baron. He looked incredibly mad, and without caring much for the wound, he tried thrusting toward Han Sen’s neck. He wanted to cut Han Sen’s head off, then and there.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew this would happen, though. So, he pulled his sword back and dodged. He continued running towards the forest.</p>

<p>But another Baron blocked Han Sen’s way. The Baron’s lance was swinging wildly like a dragon. He didn’t want to kill Han Sen; just stop him.</p>

<p>The Viscount looked cold and murderous. He wanted to stab Han Sen in the back.</p>

<p>Han Sen could not go backward nor forward, and he was going to get hit by the Viscount.</p>

<p>So, Han Sen turned around and watched the Viscount He crossed the Purple-Moon longsword and shortsword so they’d be brought up against the Viscount’s sword. He paid little attention to the lance behind him.</p>

<p>The Baron noticed his opportunity, and so he used all of his powers to strike Han Sen in the back. The tip of the lance cracked the atmosphere as it flew to plant itself in Han Sen’s back.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time this occurred, the Viscount’s sword came down on Han Sen’s two swords. It shined brightly, dousing the whole forest in green light.</p>

<p>Han Sen suddenly jumped, his body assuming a weird position in the air. It was like he was lying down, aloft in the air. He pushed the Viscount’s sword back with his own two swords, as a swordlight came behind Han Sen.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The Baron’s lance went below Han Sen, striking the Viscount in the chest. And at the same time, the Viscount’s swordlight decapitated the striking Baron.</p>

<p>Blood was spilling everywhere, and the Viscount was enraged. He swung his sword and chased Han Sen into the forest.</p>
