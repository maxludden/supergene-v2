<h2>The Use of the Story of Genes</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2497</h3>

<p>Seeing Spell’s self-cogwheel, Han Sen reached his hand out to
touch her forehead. He activated The Story of Genes’
self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Two identical self-cogwheels were able to connect. They fit
together perfectly.</p>
<p>As Han Sen’s self-cogwheel started to move, Spell’s
self-cogwheel followed along with it. The two cogwheels accelerated
together, becoming brighter and brighter with Spell.</p>
<p>But because of the teeth of the cogwheels, the two cogwheels
spun in opposite directions. One of them went clockwise, and the
other went counter-clockwise.</p>
<p>As they spun faster and faster, Spell shone with ever-increasing
intensity. Han Sen and Spell’s power was moving like crazy.</p>
<p>They both had the power of The Story of Genes. Han Sen soon
detected that his power was different from Spell’s power, but he
couldn’t discern exactly what made each one unique.</p>
<p>Han Sen guessed that the difference in their powers had
something to do with the way the self-cogwheels were spinning in
opposite directions.</p>
<p>As Han Sen tried to figure out what benefit the connection
between the cogwheels provided, Spell’s body suddenly began to
change beneath his hand.</p>
<p>This change was different from when she became the armor, the
pistols, the sniper rifle, or the rocket launcher. Spell stepped
toward Han Sen and connected with his body.</p>
<p>“This is…” Han Sen was shocked. This was a familiar feeling. It
was the same feeling as when he combined with Little Angel.</p>
<p>Of course, when Spell combined with Han Sen’s body, his body
changed, too. His hair and his eyes changed to reflect Spell’s
colors. His body became softer. The strange symbols of Spell
appeared across his forehead.</p>
<p>This combination was different than when Spell became an armor
set for Han Sen to wear. It was more like the combination process
and result Han Sen had experienced with Little Angel. And Han Sen’s
body had no armor.</p>
<p>After combining with Spell, Han Sen noticed he had two
self-cogwheels for The Story of Genes. He could barely believe it.
They were still active and spinning in opposite directions, but
aside from affecting each other, they didn’t connect with any other
universal cogwheels. They weren’t much different now than when they
were apart. There were no area powers.</p>
<p>But because they had combined, Han Sen’s fitness had risen
higher.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was wondering about the power of The Story of
Genes’ area, he suddenly felt a mysterious shockwave come from
inside his Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen had felt this shockwave before. And now, it was
happening again. Han Sen peered into his Sea of Soul and saw the
black crystal armor. A symbol had appeared on the helmet of the
black crystal armor that looked exactly the same as the one on Han
Sen’s forehead. It was glowing with a gentle light.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt that his connection with the black crystal armor
had never been this close before. It was as if he could control it
with his mind.</p>
<p>But Han Sen swiftly realized that it was an illusion, more than
anything. He could see the symbiotic connection between himself and
the black crystal armor, but he still couldn’t control it.</p>
<p>But this change made Han Sen a very happy boy. “Is the power of
The Story of Genes meant to control the black crystal armor? The
connection between me and the black crystal armor has certainly
strengthened. If The Story of Genes levels up to a certain point,
maybe I will be able to actually control the black crystal
armor.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mind returned to the moment when the black crystal
armor’s punch had annihilated that statue. He would definitely like
to max out The Story of Genes to be able to don such armor.</p>
<p>But that also made Han Sen a touch worried. “The Story of Genes
was invented by Sacred Leader and that strange woman. Its purpose
was to kill gods. Why does The Story of Genes have a connection
with the black crystal armor? Is the black crystal armor connected
to Sacred Leader? The black crystal armor originates from the
sanctuaries. If it is connected with the Sacred Leader, why did the
Sacred Leader leave it behind in the sanctuaries? If the black
crystal armor is an item the Sacred Leader created to slay a god,
then did it fail? Is that why he just tossed it into the
sanctuaries?”</p>
<p>He knew it was unlikely that the Sacred Leader would just throw
the set of armor away like that. So, it was just a guess. No one
knew the truth just yet.</p>
<p>After learning what Spell could be used for, Han Sen felt
depressed. Until he opened the black crystal armor, Spell’s area
wouldn’t help him much. Combining with her only made his body
stronger. There were no special abilities.</p>
<p>“No way. The Story of Genes must be independent. That woman
never said that The Story of Genes required a set of armor. What is
going on? Does the black crystal armor exist because it was the
only way for the Sacred Leader to learn The Story of Genes? Is that
why they are a match?” That idea actually seemed possible.</p>
<p>When he first tried to practice The Story of Genes, he failed
repeatedly. It was through the help of the black crystal armor that
he was able to properly start practicing with The Story of
Genes.</p>
<p>If Sacred Leader and that woman created The Story of Genes and
noticed that it couldn’t be practiced, Sacred Leader might have
found a way to do so through the synthesis of that black crystal
armor. In that case, Han Sen’s experience with The Story of Genes
might make sense.</p>
<p>There was one thing that didn’t make sense, though. If the black
crystal armor was something that helped The Story of Genes, Sacred
Leader must have carried it around with him like a treasure. Why
would he leave it behind in the sanctuaries? And on top of that,
why would he leave it in the first realm of the sanctuaries?</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t understand, so he stopped thinking about it and
released his connection with Spell.</p>
<p>“Weird. When I combine with Spell, why is the process so similar
to what I do with Little Angel?” Han Sen wanted to find Little
Angel and try it again, but she wasn’t here. So, that would have to
wait.</p>
<p>When Han Sen returned to the control deck, the pirates were
standing in front of Bao’er. They all looked depressed. They were
Dukes and Kings, but their faces were covered with stickers. They
looked hilarious.</p>
<p>He saw that the eyes of the pirates were pleading for help. So,
Han Sen put Bao’er on his shoulder and said, “Okay, you should let
them go back to work now. We should have a look at the knights of
the Extreme King.”</p>
<p>Han Sen walked a few steps when he suddenly heard a pirate
shout, “Captain, look! Something is approaching us.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked where the man was indicating, and he saw a giant
battleship amidst the clouds. The battleship was almost as big as a
planet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t rare to see a ship that big, but this was the Tianxia
System. Most electronics failed to work in this place, so it was
surprising to see something that large remain functional.</p>
<p>As Han Sen mulled over this oddity, the battleship came near the
white whale. The enormous white whale looked like a tiny fish next
to this monolithic battleship.</p>
