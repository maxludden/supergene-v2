<p>Black-Moon King nodded slightly, then shook his head. The nobles
around were confused, and they weren’t sure what that meant. No one
was going to ask now, though. They were happy to wait until
Black-Moon King finished his investigation. They were still very
curious about the knife.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King inspected the blade from top-to-bottom, at least
ten times. He eventually gave out a long sigh, and with an ashamed
tone of voice, said, “It is a shame…”</p>
<p>“Black-Moon King, tell us clearly! What about it is a shame?”
Night River King couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King held the and said, “Planet Knife Grave is more
like a museum for knives. No one knows where the knives come from,
but they are relics from a long-ago eon. They weren’t forged, and
the grave is just a container. Their numbers don’t change. So, when
you take one out, there is one less there. New ones aren’t
generated.”</p>
<p>“We know that! But what does that mean?” Night River King looked
annoyed.</p>
<p>As Black-Moon King continued looking at the , he sighed and
said, “This is an anomaly. I am not sure why such material exists
there, in the grave. The surface of the planet has been soaking in
knifeminds and knifeairs for so long, this was generated. Give it a
bit more time, perhaps a few thousand years, and it might become a
real knife. And on top of that, a King class weapon. It is a shame
it was brought out so early. It is just a . Now that it has left
the grave, there is no more knifeair or knifeminds to cultivate it.
I am afraid this might be ruined forever.”</p>
<p>Hearing him say all this, Night River King asked, “No one can
finish it, perhaps through forging?”</p>
<p>“It would be hard. Aside from Planet Knife Grave, where could
you find a place with knifeair? And the knives that come from
inside there, they cannot be returned once they have left. I am
afraid it won’t become a true knife.” After Black-Moon King said
that, he returned the knife to Han Sen. “Although it is just a ,
and it doesn’t have its own knifeair and knifemind, it’s still as
sturdy as a King class weapon. It counts as King class, fret
not.”</p>
<p>Many Nobles and Kings were very jealous, hearing this. Although
it wasn’t fully a King class weapon, it had the makings of one. Han
Sen had also received another King class knife, as well: Ghost
Teeth. He was the one who had emerged with the most rewards,
following the trip inside. Despite their jealousy, the onlookers
knew they couldn’t say anything. It would be impossible to try to
steal the items, too. Han Sen was Knife Queen’s student.</p>
<p>“Everyone, take your knives and get them recorded. Then we can
return,” Black-Moon King addressed Han Sen and the other
Barons.</p>
<p>“My King, we do not know what the ’s name is. How might we
record it?” A recorder asked Black-Moon King.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King looked at Han Sen and said, “See if you can
activate its power. Although it is only a , it might still have a
mind of its own.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and tried to insert his power into it.</p>
<p>It was different from how it occurred with Ghost Teeth. When Han
Sen used that malicious blade, he only needed a little bit of power
to activate it. But this was like a black hole. When Han Sen put
power into it, nothing happened. Nothing even moved.</p>
<p>The was like a block of steel, and nothing transpired.</p>
<p>Han Sen expected this, though. After all, the did not have a
reaction to his knifemind. Han Sen had a strong knifemind, but his
actual strength was far weaker. It would be strange if Han Sen
could activate it through his current level of strength.</p>
<p>Seeing the give no reaction, the others couldn’t keep themselves
from mocking the effort.</p>
<p>“It looks like it has no life, after all. It’s just a rod of
steel!”</p>
<p>“This world is not as good as you might like to believe. There
is no way you could have received a second King class weapon. After
your first, don’t expect anything else.”</p>
<p>“It has no life, but it is hard. You could still use it to
practice!”</p>
<p>Han Sen deactivated his powers. As he held the , he shook his
head.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King thought for a moment, then said, “If you agree
to it, I myself can try and activate it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.” Han Sen passed it to Black-Moon King.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King took the and inserted his power into it.
Black-Moon King was a very powerful person, but not even he could
an incite a reaction in it.</p>
<p>After that, Black-Moon King shook his head and gave it back to
Han Sen. “It looks like the does not have a mind. It is a
shame.”</p>
<p>Black-Moon King turned around and said to the recorder, “Write
down ‘,’ then.”</p>
<p>After the registration was complete, Han Sen said goodbye to
Black Steel. He brought Ghost Teeth and with him back to Planet
Knife. He was going to meet up with Yisha.</p>
<p>“Show me your Ghost Teeth knife,” Yisha said, nodding to the
knife that was in his satchel.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought the Ghost Teeth knife out in front of Yisha.
Yisha took it and put her power into it, and then, she frowned.</p>
<p>When Han Sen put his power in, it had incited a reaction with
his knifemind. She had casually done the same, too, and while she
was stronger than Han Sen, there was no reaction.</p>
<p>Yisha frowned. She tried putting a lot of power into it, and
eventually, Ghost Teeth started to rattle. It released a purple
smoke before trying to escape from her hands and return to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Yisha was shocked. Ghost Teeth knife only managed to escape
while she was distracted, but that was not the point</p>
<p>The point was, her Teeth Knife matched with the Ghost Teeth
knife. It should have felt her power and accepted her strength, but
it resisted her and flew back to Han Sen. That was shocking.</p>
<p>Yisha did not know Han Sen’s Teeth Knife knifemind was stronger.
The reason it selected Han Sen was because of his deified
knifemind. She was half a step behind him, so the blade did not
choose her.</p>
<p>Yisha didn’t try taking it again. She stared at Han Sen for a
while, and eventually said, “You did well. Put the knife away for
now. A rule of the Rebate says that if you have a King class
weapon, you can own a planet in the Narrow Moons. Get ready.”</p>
<p>Black-Moon King nodded slightly, then shook his head. The nobles
around were confused, and they weren’t sure what that meant. No one
was going to ask now, though. They were happy to wait until
Black-Moon King finished his investigation. They were still very

<p>“Black-Moon King, tell us clearly! What about it is a shame?”
Night River King couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King held the Knife Blank and said, “Planet Knife
Grave is more like a museum for knives. No one knows where the
knives come from, but they are relics from a long-ago eon. They
weren’t forged, and the grave is just a container. Their numbers

sighed and said, “This Knife Blank is an anomaly. I am not sure why
