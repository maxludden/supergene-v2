<h2>Spell Evolution</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1922</h3>

<p>Han Sen kept fighting and consuming the spring water he could
get. His mind was thinking about the little bug on his forehead, so
he wasn’t paying attention to anything else.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought what he had taken was just a larger water drop.
It sure tasted like ordinary spring water, but after swallowing it,
he acknowledged that something might have been wrong. It was as if
he swallowed a vat of lava, and his entire body flared up with
pain. He was burning on the inside with a sensation that was worse
than any cut.</p>
<p>But Han Sen kept on casting his Yin Yang Change, trying to
convert the horrible substance. His other hand was reaching for his
forehead, to try to remove the red bug.</p>
<p>The bug looked like blood. It was only the size of a needle
head, and when it touched Han Sen’s forehead, it tried to drill
through the helmet. Quickly, a hole had been punctured through the
Spell armor. The fiend was going to go right through.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his other hand to cover the hole, but the bug was
already inside the armor. He couldn’t get a hold of it.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. Before he could think about how to deal with
the bug, Sword Know and the Tego Earl were coming for him once
again.</p>
<p>They were just like Han Sen right now, in that they did not know
about the red mist soul. They didn’t know that after the red mist
soul, there would not be any more spring water.</p>
<p>The red mist soul was extremely rare. It was an angry spirit
that the spring itself had generated.</p>
<p>The red mist spring worked on Viscounts. It was not effective
when you reached Earl, but the red mist soul was. It could trigger
an evolution for an Earl. The chances weren’t very high, but the
mere prospect of it being a possibility was quite scary.</p>
<p>If normal Viscounts used a red mist soul, they could easily
become an Earl. It was a guarantee.</p>
<p>The Kings watched Han Sen swallow the red mist soul, and they
thought it to be an even grander waste. None felt this more than
Night River King. He wished he had allowed Sword Know to use the
Blood-Brain Bug sooner.</p>
<p>Blood-Brain Bugs were a harmful xenogeneic. As a parasite, they
could latch themselves onto the brains of others. One of them would
look like a normal bug, but when activated, it could ravage the
brain of its victim. Its behavior could be controlled remotely,
too.</p>
<p>Seeing the Blood-Brain Bug pierce the helmet, Han Sen’s body
shone. The Spell armor was glowing white.</p>
<p>The red mist soul in Han Sen’s body, and the spring water, were
converted into energy inside his armor. Spell’s energy was finally
released. It was going to reach Viscount class.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The Spell armor was bathed in light, and in its radiance, the
Blood-Brain Bug melted. Nothing of it remained.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Ghost Teeth Knife glowed white as it was imbued with
Spell’s light. It was a knifelight.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knifemind was also increasing. It was scary before,
but now it was becoming something even greater. It was way past the
level of a Duke.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The person and the knife combined into one. The knifelight was
like the light of dawn. It banished the dark and signaled the
coming of a new day. And now, it was going after the Tego Earl.</p>
<p>The Tego Earl was shocked. That knifelight was scarier than any
monster. It took over his entire world. The Tego Earl swung his
fist like a tiger, but he himself wished to retreat.</p>
<p>The knifelight acted as if it had a life of its own. It smashed
into his back and sent fractures all the way through his chest. He
started to bleed profusely.</p>
<p>When the blood spilled out, the purple mist began to spread
across the wounds. The Tego Earl looked scared, and his wounds
expanded quickly. His chest was torn wide open, and then, his
organs fell out.</p>
<p>“Aargh!” The Tego Earl screamed. He had been ripped apart by the
Teeth power.</p>
<p>Rebecca and the others stopped attacking. The looked at Han Sen,
holding Ghost Teeth Knife like a demon.</p>
<p>He didn’t look like he was going to stop. And he turned his
murderous attention onto Sword Know.</p>
<p>In that fight, all that the other Earls had wanted was a bit of
that spring water. It was only the Tego Earl and Sword Know that
wanted to kill Han Sen. But he didn’t look willing to stop.</p>
<p>The knife he wielded was like a demon striker. The knifelight
was like a maw of toxic teeth, wanting to crush Sword Know.</p>
<p>Sword Know knew he was injured, and far worse than the Tego Earl
had been just before Han Sen killed him. He couldn’t take Han Sen’s
strike, and he looked so scared. He flailed his sword to spawn
another meteoric slash that could hopefully break Han Sen’s
swordlight.</p>
<p>“Enough! The fight for the red mist spring has ended.” Night
River King’s scary power and aura landed. It covered the entirety
of the Red Mist Valley. He spoke in a cold voice.</p>
<p>Han Sen acted as if he had not heard him. He didn’t care about
the King’s presence, and he still continued swinging his knife. The
knifelight cut through from the top of Sword Know’s head, down
through his body until he flopped in two.</p>
<p>Everyone was in shock. They never expected Han Sen could be so
cruel. Even with Night River King there, he had mercilessly slain
Sword Know.</p>
<p>Night River King was furious, and he said, “I told you to stop!
And you are still killing?”</p>
<p>Night River King swung his palm, and his scary power came
towards Han Sen to crush him. The mere presence that the hand
possessed was terrifying. As rocks were broken, it felt like the
end of the world.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding his Ghost Teeth Knife. He stared at that
hand that towered towards the sky like a mountain. He wasn’t
scared, though.</p>
<p>His knifemind roared like a beast, but the King’s power did not
relent.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Before the hand could land, a purple gust of knife wind came
from Planet Blade. It traveled through space like a beam that
crossed the universe. It broke through Planet Eclipse’s atmosphere
and cut through the hand.</p>
<p>“Aargh!” A scream sounded, and the big hand was sliced into dust
by that fearsome knifelight. Night River King’s body disappeared,
right from where he was on Planet Eclipse.</p>
<p>“Please don’t be mad, Knife. Night River King was just angry,
and he did not mean to hurt Han Sen,” Moon Wheel King said, looking
up towards Planet Blade.</p>
<p>“I will decide the fate of my student. Others should learn not
to interfere.” Queen’s voice sounded empty, but it was all over
Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King shook his head and then vanished from Planet
Eclipse.</p>
<p>The other Kings left, too. There was no point in them staying
any longer. If they tried anything, they’d be humiliated like Night
River King had.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen had his Teeth Knife knifemind, Yisha could protect
him properly. They weren’t Moon Wheel King, and they were not
deified. They wouldn’t want to incite Yisha’s fury.</p>
