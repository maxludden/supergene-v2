<h2>Cricket Cave</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3071</h3>

<p>A black-bodied, red-headed big cricket came out of the gap in
the stone. It battled the big, dark green gecko. The cricket was
only the size of a fist. It was much smaller than the big gecko,
but it was very fast. It was not at a disadvantage while it fought.
The black and green, the two shadows, battled on the banks of the
pool. The fight was intense to watch.</p>
<p>Han Sen found it a fun spectacle to view. The levels of the two
gene races were not very high. They were viscounts at the most, but
their methodology of battle was brutally intense. It was like
watching crickets fight.</p>
<p>“Even though sparrows are small, they’re still meat. I will wait
until they’re almost finished, then I will turn them into eggs. I
should be able to earn a bit of money when I bring them back with
me. I will at least be able to sort out my rent problem.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was having fun watching this. Suddenly, the toxic lump
on the gecko exploded. Green juice squirted everywhere. It was like
a blossoming flower spraying all over the cricket.</p>
<p>The shell on the cricket’s body looked as if it had been sprayed
with acid. It emitted white smoke. It looked as if it was being
corroded.</p>
<p>The cricket went “tzi-tzi” and fell to the ground. The gecko saw
that its attack had worked, so it approached its enemy. The cricket
struggled, trying to make its way back to the stone gap.</p>
<p>The gecko’s juice was far too toxic. Before the cricket was able
to climb into the stone gap, the shell on its body was already
being corroded. The blighter turned blurry and disgusting. It was
not going to last.</p>
<p>The cricket suddenly looked like it came back to life. Its back
legs used some hidden power to make its bloody body leap and avoid
the gecko’s tongue. It entered the stone gap.</p>
<p>“It was injured badly, so it is useless for it to go back inside
the cave. The gecko does not have to do anything. It will turn into
bloody water soon enough.” Han Sen knew now was the time for him to
act, but his pupils suddenly got small.</p>
<p>The gecko was in front of the stone gap. Suddenly, a cold light
beamed out of it. Before the big, dark green gecko reacted, it was
turned into a stone. “Huh? Does that cricket have the ability to
petrify? Why did it not use it earlier?” Han Sen was very
confused.</p>
<p>Before he thought any more about it, Han Sen worried that the
cricket was heavily injured. If it had turned into blood water, no
matter how strong his Xuan Yellow Sutra was, he could not turn a
pile of mush into an egg.</p>
<p>Han Sen flashed and came before the elusive stone gap. He cast
his Xuan Yellow Sutra to kick up a red light that struck the
petrified, dark green, big gecko.</p>
<p>Although his body was petrified, under the power of the Xuan
Yellow Sutra, it still devolved. It quickly turned into a dark
green egg that was the size of a pigeon egg.</p>
<p>He held onto that gecko egg. Han Sen reached out his hand to
punch the rock. He wanted to blow up the stone gap and see what the
cricket was doing inside.</p>
<p>After Han Sen unleashed his punch, only a few cracks manifested
in the stone. He was unable to break it.</p>
<p>“Huh? What is going on?” Han Sen was shocked. His punching power
was scary. Forget about stone, but he was able to break an ingot of
pure platinum into mini pieces with the strength he put into his
punches. Now, all he had managed to do was leave a few measly marks
on the stone. Clearly, there was something funky about the
stone.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the stone gap had no movement. No petrified light
came out of it either. So, he kept on punching. When he unleashed
his fourth punch, the rock broke. The gap was now the size of a
human head.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked into the cave and was quite surprised. It was a
cave about the size of a bathtub. There was no cricket. There was
only a pool of blood. There was an 80% to 90% chance it was the
body of the cricket.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Han Sen looked at the bloody water.</p>
<p>The stone cave was very humid and had a heavy layer of moss. The
blood water seemed to be corrosive. It had started to corrode the
moss, revealing the stone underneath.</p>
<p>The rock looked very flat. It looked as if it had been made by
someone. There were also some carvings there. Underneath the blood
and the moss, it was not very clear.</p>
<p>Han Sen wiped away the moss. He quickly discovered that beneath
the stone cave there was a stone board that had special symbols on
it. Han Sen broke the rocks around to get the stone board out, but
the stone board was around four-feet long and one-foot wide. He did
not know how long it was and could not get it out.</p>
<p>Han Sen needed to be patient. He broke the stone board around
and noticed the stone board was only half-a-foot thick. It was grey
in color. It did not look like the granite around. After being busy
for a while, Han Sen finally got the stone board out of the ground.
When he pulled out the whole stone board, he noticed it was not a
stone board. It was a stone box.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to open the stone box, but there was no reaction
from the box’s keyhole. He used his hands like a knife to strike
it. He left a few white marks on the stone box.</p>
<p>“This stone box is so weird.” Han Sen thought it was still early
enough that the eight sound bugs were not yet ready to appear, so
he took the stone box out and went to check out the cave again. He
found nothing else. He used the stones to rebuild and hide the cave
he had just discovered. Han Sen thought, “That petrifying light
probably did not come from the cricket. After all, it did not look
like a stone-element gene race. If that was not it, then it has to
be this stone box. When I dug up the stone box, after all this
time, why hasn’t the stone box done anything?”</p>
<p>Although Han Sen thought he was very handsome, he did not think
he was handsome enough for the stone box to treat him differently.
“What is the reason?” Han Sen looked at the top of the stone box.
There was still blood water the cricket had left behind. It had
already dried up.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart suddenly jumped. “This thing is not going to
react after seeing blood, is it?”.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen thought that way, he was not going to use his
own blood for the testing. He looked around, planning to kill a
gene race and see if he could use the gene race’s blood to activate
the stone box.</p>
<p>Ding! Han Sen suddenly heard a sound that was like a harp’s
string being plucked. It came from inside a bush. Han Sen looked
into the sky. It was dark. A moon was now above the mountain.</p>
<p>Not long later, Han Sen heard a harp sound in the vicinity. It
was like someone was playing an old instrument. It sounded very
nice. Under the night sky of the valley, it sounded very
mysterious.</p>
<p>Han Sen held his breath. His body was like it was petrified and
unmoving.</p>
<p>The eight sound bugs could not see anything, but they were very
sensitive to sound. Insects that were a few miles away could not
hide from them. If people wanted to catch an eight sound bug, they
could not make a sound. Even the jump of a shocked heart would
alert them.</p>
<p>He needed to wait until they emerged from the ground and hit
them when they were nearby. He could not claim another if they
escaped underground.</p>
<p>Han Sen controlled his body. He sat where he was like a stone.
Not long later, from out of the bush, he saw a white light emerge
from the leaves. In the nighttime, it looked like a firefly.</p>
