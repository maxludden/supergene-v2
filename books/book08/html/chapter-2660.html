<h2>Physiognomy</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2660</h3>

<p>“This fruit is very puffed and full. It does seem very rich. It
is obviously a sign of happiness. It must surely have generated a
deified xenogeneic.” Those who studied physiognomy believed they
could judge the personality of a person merely by studying that
person’s facial features. Han Sen attempted to apply the same
principle to the fruit, running his hands over its surface.</p>
<p>“Ha! Are you trying to read the fruit’s physiognomy?” Exquisite
couldn’t help but laugh. The Very High had physiognomy skills, as
well. But they had never thought about trying something like that
on a star fruit, of all things.</p>
<p>“Humans have faces. Fruits have faces, too. If humans can
receive physiognomies, then why can’t fruit have a physiognomy?”
Han Sen replied in a dignified manner.</p>
<p>He actually didn’t understand physiognomy; he had merely seen a
reference to it in the texts of the Xuan Men. Han Sen had barely
glanced over the topic. He couldn’t even be called a beginner. He
couldn’t actually read the face of a human, let alone of a
fruit.</p>
<p>Right now, he just needed something to reassure him that he
wasn’t making another blind choice. He desperately hoped to receive
a deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>But God didn’t give people what they wanted very often, and Han
Sen had thus far only been able to receive King class xenogeneics.
He had selected many fruits, but they all turned out to be Kings.
He could only use them for grunt work. So, overall, they wouldn’t
be very useful.</p>
<p>After choosing more fruit, Han Sen realized he only had two
left. Upset by his disappointing results, he grabbed the two
nearest to him and slammed them down.</p>
<p>Bao’er was useless now. Han Sen could only depend on his own
luck, and that wasn’t working out well for him.</p>
<p>The two fruits dissolved quickly, revealing the xenogeneics
inside them.</p>
<p>One of them was a wolf. Han Sen immediately recognized that its
presence was King class, but the other one made him quite happy for
a change.</p>
<p>It was a rock giant. It was in a sitting position, holding its
knees. It was ten meters tall, and its body was entirely composed
of black rock. It seemed to radiate strength. It looked like a
little mountain, in many ways.</p>
<p>“A deified xenogeneic, can you believe it? Finally, I have
received a deified xenogeneic.” Feeling the mammoth presence of the
rock giant, Han Sen was thrilled.</p>
<p>Exquisite felt relieved. One deified xenogeneic out of 50 fruits
was an ordinary shake of luck. While the rock giant was still
sleeping, Han Sen quickly signed a contract with it. Outer Sky was
full of deified creatures, and having a deified fighter by his side
would make life much easier for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Especially if he wanted to kill star beetles in the future,
having a deified xenogeneic to help would save him a lot of
trouble.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought his group of xenogeneics over to the old man.
The old man didn’t say much. When his gaze passed over the little
pigs around Bao’er, he seemed surprised.</p>
<p>“Uncle, I wonder what these little pigs are. Why did xenogeneics
that are so similar come out of so many fruit?” Exquisite
asked.</p>
<p>“The star tree is a true god plant,” the old man said simply.
“It possesses the energy of the universe. It isn’t something that I
fully understand. It has its reasons for existing, however.”</p>
<p>After that, the old man brought out another item to present to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“This is my token. You need to use it when you clear out beetles
in the future. Every ten days, come back and take care of the star
tree. Whenever a swarm of bugs arrives, you must make sure that you
clear out each and every one. None of them can be allowed to
live.”</p>
<p>Han Sen bowed and accepted the item. It was a small stick. It
was aqua colored, and it looked like it was made from jade.</p>
<p>The item had a very strong presence. It looked like a deified
treasure.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t expected to receive a powerful item out of this
deal, but he quickly took the jade stick and bowed before the old
man. “Do not worry, uncle. I will do my best to take care of the
star tree until you return.”</p>
<p>“You may leave now. Come back again in 10 days,” the old man
said dismissively.</p>
<p>Bao’er and Exquisite joined Han Sen as he turned to depart, but
Exquisite was unable to teleport so many creatures with her. Even
if she had used her small ship, there wouldn’t have been enough
room for all of those xenogeneics.</p>
<p>So, for now, Han Sen left the creatures there. He would be
returning to the tree in 10 days, anyway.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s small pigs were only a fist-size, so transporting them
wasn’t difficult. Han Sen pulled out a bag and stuffed all of the
pigs inside it. He carried them to the small ship.</p>
<p>“You should let them out. They won’t take up much space,
anyway,” Exquisite said. She could see the pigs writhing around in
the bag in an obvious state of discomfort.</p>
<p>Han Sen realized that she was right. He released the little pigs
and allowed them all to happily run toward Bao’er, who was standing
in the front of the ship. Altogether, they watched the majestic
scenery go by.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go back to Underworld Lake, or would you rather
hunt some xenogeneics?” Exquisite asked Han Sen as both of them
rested in the back of the ship.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back to Underworld Lake. I think it will be safer if I
practice more with God’s Wander before I begin hunting
xenogeneics,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Exquisite nodded and delivered Han Sen to Underworld
Lake.</p>
<p>Unless someone had space teleportation, they would have to use a
ship like Exquisite’s to travel around Outer Sky. The ship had a
special power buff that deterred the creatures in Outer Sky from
attempting to break it. Not even deified elites could travel
through Outer Sky on foot without trouble. And Han Sen wasn’t even
deified yet.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen wanted to practice space teleportation so he could
travel around Outer Sky with greater ease. He didn’t plan on
hunting down xenogeneics yet.</p>
<p>And of course, Han Sen also wanted to fish-up the rest of the
yellow papers he had been in the process of collecting. That was
the main reason he had asked her to take him to Underworld Lake
rather than the wooden house.</p>
<p>Exquisite could feel what Han Sen was thinking, and it made her
blush. She thought Han Sen wanted to see more of the pictures on
the yellow papers. She didn’t know the yellow papers actually
seemed to represent some sort of geno art.</p>
<p>They soon arrived back on the shores of Underworld Lake, but
this time, Exquisite didn’t leave. Instead, she remained to fish
alongside him. That was quite frustrating.</p>
<p>With Exquisite there, he had to control his thoughts. And that
was no easy task. Even Han Sen struggled to keep his thoughts in
check.</p>
<p>Han Sen enjoyed practicing his geno arts, and Exquisite got to
experience everything that he learned as well. Although Exquisite
had already learned God’s Wander, watching Han Sen practice allowed
her to learn some new things at times.</p>
<p>But Exquisite was caught off guard by Han Sen’s fishing success.
Before she pulled out a single thing, Han Sen had already managed
to reel in a few items.</p>
<p>But Han Sen only seemed to be retrieving those yellow papers.
Whenever Han Sen looked at them, she could feel it. And every time
he did, her face blushed.</p>
<p>Bao’er was now close friends with the small pigs, and she played
with them nearby as Han Sen and Exquisite fished. The pigs kept
Bao’er occupied; otherwise, she would have been bored out of her
mind. The little pigs continued to look passive, and they didn’t
exhibit an ounce of aggression. While they made for nice pets, they
were useless. Han Sen felt a little disheartened every time he
looked at them.</p>
<p>After a few days, Han Sen couldn’t stand being watched by
Exquisite anymore. So, he told her that he wanted to go to the core
area.</p>
<p>But Exquisite told him that Outer Sky was between the real world
and the anti-material world. Due to the presence of space barriers,
he couldn’t enter the core area.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried it anyway, and he really couldn’t enter the core
hall’s door anymore.</p>
