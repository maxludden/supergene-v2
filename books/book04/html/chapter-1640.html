      The fight between Han Sen and the Armored Man was Han Sen’s fourth fight
      Aside from Sacred’s master, Han Sen also defeated two other Son of God’s.
      Though he defeated them, his performance seemed to pale in comparison to
      the Armored Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Armored Man didn’t have to fight at all, as all his opponents
      immediately conceded. Han Sen wasn’t as frightening as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the creatures were speculating on whether Dollar would actually dare
      to fight the Armored Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t think about it that much. He was still practicing the
      Dongxuan Sutra like usual, hoping that he could advance Bulwark Umbrella
      to super level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran went to the company. Han Sen, Littleflower, and Bao’er were at
      home. Littleflower and Bao’er were playing in the garden, while Han Sen
      was practicing the Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, Ji Yanran still hadn’t come back yet. She was very busy
      in the company, and she needed to do overtime in the afternoon. Han Sen
      thought about it, and then he took Littleflower and Bao’er to the street
      for some food.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father, I want ice cream,” Bao’er said happily, holding Han Sen’s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, since your mom is not here, let’s get wild today. You can eat
      whatever you want until you are full,” said Han Sen, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>“Yeah!” Bao’er cheered.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t want to drive them to the shops himself. It was much easier
      to just ride there. They arrived at the street, and they stepped onto the
      automatic portal, arriving at the business center.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three ate happily, and they toured all the restaurants and food
      stands. Han Sen wasn’t afraid that Bao’er and Littleflower would get food
      poisoning. Their bodies were strong enough to resist even real poison, not
      to mention ordinary food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Littleflower was only one year old, but he could already eat a lot, a lot
      more than ordinary adults. However, he was very polite and quiet, and he
      was very elegant even when eating food.
    </p>
    <p>
      After eating, Han Sen went to the bathroom, and he put Bao’er and
      Littleflower in the children’s entertainment area. Bao’er and Littleflower
      sat on small chairs as they played.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a lady walked toward the children’s entertainment zone, and she
      arrived at the doors. She was stopped by the Al. “Lady, you didn’t put a
      child here. Is there anything I can help you with?” said the Al to the
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course.” The lady put her hands on the Al, and the machine exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody panicked because of the explosion. The entire children’s
      entertainment area seemed to have been cut off from the building.
      Everything happening here seemed to have nothing to do with the building
      anymore, and everyone overlooked the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other kids were still playing, but Bao’er suddenly jumped off the seesaw.
      She walked to Littleflower, and she stared at the woman walking toward her
      with her large eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can actually sense me coming. It seems that you’re not just a pet for
      companionship,” said the lady as she looked at Bao’er, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Please leave now, sister. My dad is very ferocious. He doesn’t like
      women. If he sees you here when he comes back, he’ll be angry and kill
      you.” Bao’er stood in front of Littleflower and looked at the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I’ll leave soon. I don’t like men who are very ferocious either. I
      only like boys who are cute and beautiful,” the woman said while she moved
      her body. She teleported beside Littleflower and reached toward his
      collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er immediately grabbed Littleflower and jumped up. She dodged the
      woman’s palms and rushed toward the exit of the children’s entertainment
      zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was surprised. “Those people are idiots. Their intelligence is
      completely wrong. A pet for companionship? Even ordinary top-tier demigods
      are not this fast.”
    </p>
    <p>Peng!</p>
    <p>
      As Bao’er tried to run out of the children’s entertainment zone with
      Littleflower, they seemed to hit an invisible wall, and they bounced back
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman smiled and walked toward them. “Even if you’re a pet at the
      demigod level, it’s still useless. If you don’t want to be killed, stand
      there and don’t move.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sister Bao’er doesn’t want to die, but if I lose my brother, my father
      will beat me to death. You’re so beautiful, so you must be a very good
      person. Help me, okay? Don’t take my brother away,” Bao’er begged, looking
      at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a cute pet. I just want to take you back… And eat you.” The woman
      licked her lips. Her tongue was long and thin like a snake’s, and it
      looked absolutely bizarre.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bao’er is still very young, so I don’t have that much flesh for you to
      eat. How about you wait for a few years, and when I grow up, you can come
      to eat me,” Bao’er said with her eyes wide open.
    </p>
    <p>Littleflower looked at the woman curiously.</p>
    <p>
      “You’re so smart, but there’s no use in stalling for time. Even if you are
      one of Han Sen’s beast souls, you can’t get through my Sen Luo illusion to
      contact him. Don’t even think about it,” the woman said while moved her
      body again, teleporting over to grab Littleflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er grabbed Littleflower, and she was extremely quick. The woman
      teleported several times, but she still couldn’t touch Littleflower, so
      she was upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Bao’er for a second. The woman then said, “Those people are
      all useless. They actually think a powerful pet like this is only for
      companionship. I’ll have to ask the instructor to punish them when I go
      back.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, black and purple smoke started coming out of her body, filling
      the entire children’s zone. The smoke looked like threads, and they moved
      toward Bao’er and Littleflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was black and purple smoke everywhere, so Bao’er and Littleflower
      didn’t even have a place to move anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black smoke touched other children, and it bound them like ropes. The
      kids were all falling down on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some kids were terrified and wanted to cry, but they found that after they
      were bound by the black and purple smoke, they couldn’t even cry out loud
      because their mouths seemed to be sealed shut. They could only cry
      silently with their eyes wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black and purple smoke that looked like hands sealed all avenues of
      escape for Bao’er and Littleflower, and then it started to attack them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er slapped her palm, and then a small gourd showed up in her hands.
      She held it toward the black and purple smoke, and then the smoke was
      quickly sucked into the gourd.
    </p>
    <p>“What is that? Is that a Geno core? How can a beast soul have a geno</p>
