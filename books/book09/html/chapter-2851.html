<h2>One Chess Piece</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2851</h3>

<p>Looking at Yisha slashing forward, Han Sen did not bother
evading like before. He moved his body forward and teleported in
front of her.</p>
<p>When the teeth knife slashed down from above, Han Sen pulled out
his right hand’s middle finger and index finger to catch the teeth
knife’s body. That scary knife power was captured by Han Sen’s
fingers. The attack was unable to proceed anymore.</p>
<p>Yisha’s vision was like a blade. Her body’s power was gathering
on the knife. She kept trying to press the blade down. As Han Sen’s
fingers continued to clamp it, the teeth knife looked as if it was
growing roots. It was unable to move.</p>
<p>It looks like the god spirit gene’s geno armament is rather
lame. With the buff of the scabbard, Yisha’s power is still able to
override my xenogeneic body. Han Sen had given Yisha the scabbard
because he wanted to see how powerful the scabbard was. If Yisha
was able to use the scabbard to beat him, he would let Yisha keep
the scabbard as a reward for being his teacher.</p>
<p>When Yisha received the scabbard’s boon, she was still unable to
influence the universal cogwheels that were currently under the
Dongxuan Sutra’s control. It could not be spun.</p>
<p>It was because Han Sen’s xenogeneic body was too strong and
Yisha had just received the scabbard. She was unable to activate
the scabbard’s entire power.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the scabbard was not made from just a god’s
personality. Compared to a god’s personality armament, it was
considerably weaker.</p>
<p>“How does that work? Dollar’s power can restrict a scary Knife
Queen who attacks like that. Is he butterfly class?”</p>
<p>“Judging from his level of power, he should only be larva class.
A larva class being with this sort of power must mean he is the
best of the same level though.”</p>
<p>“It is no wonder Dollar is so cocky. He has what it takes to
be.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen released his hands and retreated a few steps. He looked
at Yisha and said, “Knife Queen, I do not think you have enough
power to beat me.”</p>
<p>Yisha looked at Han Sen strangely. She flipped her hands and
threw the scabbard back to Han Sen. When Han Sen caught the
scabbard, Yisha was already flying out of the space
battleground.</p>
<p>“When I beat you, I will take back the scabbard.” A cold voice
echoed throughout the space battleground.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He left the space
battleground.</p>
<p>Han Sen had won the match quickly and cleanly, but there were
too many deified creatures. Many of them, including Zheng Xuandao,
Dragon One, Demon Alpha, Destroyed Leader, and the Very High
Leader, were taking part. That was a whole bunch of scary people.
Golden Growler continued to prove itself invincible. No creature
dared enter the space battleground to fight it.</p>
<p>Thus, Han Sen’s performance made people’s eyes brighten. He had
reached a level that shocked people.</p>
<p>Back in the garden, Han Sen saw God sitting on a stone chair.
There was a chessboard atop the stone table.</p>
<p>God looked at Han Sen and said, “Your power is not comparable to
anyone else in the same class. Even against a butterfly class
creature, you are pretty good. You have such powerful genes. It
should be carried on by ancient blood. Yet, you do not look like
anyone with ancient blood. It is very strange. Can you tell me what
race you belong to?”</p>
<p>“I am human,” Han Sen casually answered. He saw the chess pieces
were in a stalemate. He was confused and asked, “Who were you
playing chess with?”</p>
<p>“Just an interesting guy,” God said with a smile.</p>
<p>“An interesting guy, huh? Where is he?” Han Sen did not see
anyone else there.</p>
<p>“He is here,” God said and pointed at the chessboard.</p>
<p>“Here?” Han Sen looked at the chessboard with confusion. Aside
from the chessboard itself, he could neither see nor feel anything
else.</p>
<p>“He is inside the chessboard,” God said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Is he…” Han Sen’s face changed. He closely inspected the
chessboard’s chess pieces. He saw a black chess piece that looked
very weird.</p>
<p>The black and white chess pieces were very simple. There were
not many differences between them, but this black chess piece was
carved with a symbol. It was an old man symbol.</p>
<p>“Why does this symbol look so familiar… Oh, crap!” Han Sen
opened his mouth in shock. With a look of disbelief, he asked, “Is
that Holy Pirate? Why was he turned into a chess piece?”</p>
<p>“He made three wishes to me. One of them was that he wished to
play chess. I fulfilled his wish.” God pointed to the chessboard
and asked, “Are you interested in finishing the round?”</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. He did not want to end up like Holy
Pirate and become a chess piece on a chessboard.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, he is only like that because he made a wish to
me,” God said with a laugh. “I am only going to play chess with
you. Nothing else.”</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “My chess skills are only average. You
should find a chess master to play against you.”</p>
<p>“Your geno art is very familiar to the Very High’s Very High
Sense,” God said. “Chess is very good for you to understand things.
Learning how to play well might serve you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew God was right. The Dongxuan Sutra and the game of
chess had a lot in common. In the past, he had researched chess
skills, so his chess abilities were pretty good.</p>
<p>But playing chess against God was more than practice. There was
bound to be a lot more pressure in a game of chess that was more
like a deathmatch. If he fell for God’s tricks, there was every
chance he could end up like Holy Pirate. Han Sen shook his head and
said, “I am going to prepare the next round. I do not have time to
play.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was telling the truth. He needed to reach butterfly
class before the next round began.</p>
<p>“If you lose, you do not have to give me anything. If you win, I
can give you this chess piece.” God pointed at the chess piece that
Holy Pirate had become.</p>
<p>“What would I need that chess piece for?” Han Sen shook his
head.</p>
<p>“People can become chess pieces, and chess pieces can become
people. If you have this chess piece, you can do anything you want
with it. He can only do what you want him to do. If there is a
knife mountain fire sea ahead, he cannot regret it.” After speaking
God picked up a white piece, placed it on the chessboard, smiled,
and said, “Your turn.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what Holy Pirate’s level was, but he had to
be at least butterfly class since he could freely enter and leave
Space Garden. Having a deified creature that could be controlled
like that would be very good for him.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate also had the power to freely enter and exit Space
Garden, which worried Han Sen. He was concerned that Holy Pirate
would become a tool for people of other races to attack Space
Garden. If he was able to keep Holy Pirate in his pocket, that
would be beneficial.</p>
<p>It was a big temptation, but Han Sen did not dare believe
God.</p>
<p>“I said that for the next half a year, I would not do anything
to harm you,” God coldly said. “I will not break my promise. You
should know that God cannot lie.”</p>
<p>“OK. You make a bet with me to do this. I suppose I will
participate.” Han Sen picked up a chess piece and sat opposite of
God.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought his chess skills weren’t too shabby. In the
Alliance, he was one of the top-class chess players. When he played
chess with God, he lost badly.</p>
<p>Stalemates didn’t count. Han Sen and God played eight rounds.
Han Sen lost each and every time. He was unable to fight back. He
lost completely.</p>
<p>Han Sen playing chess with God was like playing against a
supercomputer. The moves he made took forever to calculate, but his
opponent would respond with a move that seemed almost random. It
did not look as if God even thought about what to do. Even so, Han
Sen sorely lost each time.</p>
