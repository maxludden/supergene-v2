	<p>Seeing Bai Qing Xia striking with his palm, Han Sen unleashed another Shocking Sky Punch.</p>

	<p>He would have liked to use other techniques, but he had only just started using his Bai Yi disguise. He hadn’t
		yet had the time to learn any other skills. He had been lucky to learn this punch from the Extreme King alpha’s
		statue, but using other skills might expose him.</p>

	<p>The Shocking Sky Punch was a technique that every member of the Extreme King had to learn. Although it was basic,
		it was still very powerful. It would be ridiculous to call the skill invincible, but it could challenge a
		surprising number of other techniques.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>The fist and the palm hit each other. Han Sen’s Shocking Sky Punch blocked Bai Qing Xia’s day and night cycle
		split. But still, no one was winning.</p>

	<p>“Huh. Bai Yi’s Shocking Sky Punch managed to block the day and night cycle split? Today is a weird day. We are
		witnessing so many bizarre things.”</p>

	<p>“They are both first-tier Kings. How can a Shocking Sky Punch break a day and night cycle split?”</p>

	<p>“The Bai family has too many powerful members. Those two princes have never really revealed themselves before. I
		wouldn’t have expected the two to possess powers like this. They are both so talented, and it seems as if the
		fight between these two princes has only just begun.”</p>

	<br>

	<hr />

	<br>

	<p>Everyone was talking. Instead of attacking Han Sen again, Bai Qing Xia just stared at his opponent. A long time
		later, he said, “You are very special, Brother Sixteen. It was no wonder that you were able to claim the alpha
		statue.”</p>

	<p>“You’re not bad, either,” Han Sen admitted with a nod.</p>

	<p>Bai Qing Xia raised his head. He looked up to the king tree and said, “The king tree is going to wake up, so we
		should cease our fighting for now. If you are here to seek protection from King’s Cover, then let us determine a
		victory through how many Kingese we both receive. How does that sound?”</p>

	<p>“I’m just here on a stroll. I don’t care if I get Kingese or not,” Han Sen said.</p>

	<p>Bai Qing Xia laughed. “Are you afraid to lose?”</p>

	<p>“Huh? You really think I can actually be afraid of you?” Han Sen grunted dismissively.</p>

	<p>“Then it is settled. We will determine the victor based on how many Kingese we each receive. Whoever has the most
		Kingese will win.” After saying this, Bai Qing Xia returned to the king dragon’s head.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had no idea how to get the Kingese. So, he pretended to shoot Bai Qing Xia a look of contempt. He flew to
		another king dragon’s head and sat down just like the other prince.</p>

	<p>Seeing Bai Qing Xia close his eyes atop the dragon’s head, Han Sen pretended to do the same. The blood kirin sat
		down next to him.</p>

	<p>“Bai Qing Xia and Bai Yi are both seeking King Cover’s protection. I wonder how many Kingese they will receive?”
	</p>

	<p>“In the past, I would have thought they would be lucky to earn one or two. But now, it is hard to tell. Those two
		have been keeping secrets, and it is obvious they are looking to impress everyone. They’re probably still hiding
		much of their power.”</p>

	<p>“You are right. I didn’t expect two normal princes to hide their powers in the way they have. It looks like this
		is the Extreme King’s strongest era.”</p>

	<p>“Haha! As the royal children grow stronger, their fights will grow stronger as well. I do not know if that is
		good or bad.”</p>

	<p>The king tree’s leaves started to glow, but few of the royal children went looking for the primary root king
		dragons. Most of them wanted to watch Han Sen and Bai Qing Xia.</p>

	<p>Every leaf on the king tree had some Kingese. When the king tree woke up, the Kingese on the leaves grew
		brighter. Under their light, the leaves looked gold.</p>

	<p>Kingese was the blood pulse of the leaves. Every king leaf’s blood pulse was different. As time passed, the blood
		pulse became brighter. The Kingese brightened into gold symbols branded onto the gold leaves, and each symbol
		gave off a different sensation.</p>

	<p>Some of them were strong like fire. Some of them felt like rushing water. Some of them were heavy on the ground,
		and others were deep like an abyss.</p>

	<p>Although Han Sen couldn’t decipher the Kingese, he could feel their power. He could understand what they meant.
	</p>

	<p>It wasn’t because Han Sen was good at learning. It was because the power of each Kingese was linked to a
		substance. There was a deeper meaning to them than a mere hieroglyph. Han Sen didn’t have to learn them. He just
		had to see the shape of the item that was related to the Kingese. Then, he could recognize what they meant.</p>

	<p>“This world is so big. Everything and anything can exist here. Even the leaves of the king tree are in some way
		connected to the fabric of the world. It’s all-inclusive. How amazing.” Han Sen sighed, and then he thought to
		himself, “If I could dig it out and haul it back to the Alliance, I wonder if it would still grow?”</p>

	<p>The king tree and its leaves woke up. The Kingese was shining brightly. A king dragon nearby roared and then fell
		into the ground.</p>

	<p>Han Sen saw that Bai Qing Xia hadn’t moved yet. He furrowed his eyebrows. “Does he not want the protection of the
		Kingese? Why is he sitting on the head of a dragon? That way, he will not be able to go underground.”</p>

	<p>That was what Han Sen was thinking, at least. He didn’t move. He maintained his position just as Bai Qing Xia
		did, sitting atop the dragon head.</p>

	<p>The king dragons around them were all drilling into the soil. And then, both of their own king dragons started to
		move. Bai Qing Xia still didn’t move.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wasn’t sure what was going on. The king dragon didn’t go underground as the other dragons did. Instead,
		it raised its head and went up to the top of the tree.</p>

	<p>The boughs of the tree high above were like a golden sky. The Kingese was shining like a platter of gold stars.
		The two dragons kept going up and up, as if they were shooting off into the cosmos.</p>

	<p>If someone hadn’t actually seen it in person, it would have been difficult to imagine how beautiful it looked.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen was standing atop the dragon’s head, staring at the shining Kingese. It was like he was in a dreamland.
	</p>

	<p>Those two king dragons stopped moving forward after reaching the halfway point. After all, they were just the
		roots of the king tree, and there was only so far that they could go. They would have to disconnect from the
		king tree to go further.</p>

	<p>Bai Qing Xia opened his eyes. He stood up, looked at the Kingese, and said, “The older one should do this first,
		so go ahead.”</p>

	<p>“I am just sight-seeing. You go first,” Han Sen said simply.</p>

	<p>He had no idea how to gain the approval and protection of the Kingese.</p>

	<p>Bai Qing Xia didn’t decline the offer to go first. He looked up to the Kingese, and then his body started to glow
		with a white light. The white became more intense, and it made Bai Qing Xia’s body brighter. It was like he was
		becoming a transparent jade stone.</p>

	<p>“King body?” Han Sen squinted. Bai Qing Xia was still standing on his dragon’s head. His body was so bright, it
		was like he was wholly wrapped-up by a godlight. It wasn’t just his flesh, either; even his hair looked like
		jade.</p>

	<p>With his king body’s power spreading, the Kingese on the king leaves answered. A king leaf started to shake. It
		began to make a rustling noise, like it was caught in a wind that affected nothing else.</p>
