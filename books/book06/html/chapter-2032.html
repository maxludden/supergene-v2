<h2>Knife Air Like Silk</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2032</h3>

<p>Han Sen dodged. He was like a shadow as he slipped around Dragon
Thirteen’s lance. He was even faster than before. “Two Sky Heart
Locks?” Dragon Thirteen’s face went slack.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a powerful Earl. It was shocking to learn he was
carrying even just one Sky Heart Lock. No one would have ever
expected he might be carrying two of them.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t seen this for herself, she wouldn’t have believed
it. The idea that an Earl could still fight her adequately while
shouldering the burden of two Sky Heart Locks… It was
unfathomable.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen felt very light. His body felt great. With every
step he took, it seemed like he could shoot into the air like a
prancing fairy.</p>
<p>The lance that had once seemed difficult to dodge was now easy
to evade. He didn’t feel any of the pressure he had felt
earlier.</p>
<p>He didn’t feel as easily tired as earlier, either. He was now
active again.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen frowned. Han Sen had unlocked two Sky Heart
Locks. She felt as if she was not suppressing him anymore.</p>
<p>The two of them moved fast, as knife airs came against the lance
in rapid collisions. Han Sen’s power was a little weaker than hers,
but unlike earlier, he could now hold her off.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was fighting Dragon Thirteen, Sharon was still
engaged in battle with the silver glass bug. The silver glass bug’s
silver shield was powerful. Sharon had delivered a few hundred
strikes against it, but it had yet to buckle and break.</p>
<p>Sharon frowned. He wanted to get this fight over with quickly.
Dragon Thirteen had been gone for some time, and he couldn’t help
but feel as if something was wrong.</p>
<p>His power changed, and a black light began to shine. It gathered
up across his scimitar as he slashed the silver glass bug again.
The scimitar had done nothing to the silver armor earlier, but
under this new attack, a crack was left across the silver
surface.</p>
<p>“What powerful armor! It did not shatter, even with my
Demon-Dragon Air. This guy’s defense must be the greatest of all
Marquises.” Sharon frowned, but his scimitar did not relent. He
kept on attacking.</p>
<p>Sharon was part of Demon, but his blood had ties to the Dragon.
Aside from the Sky-Demon Sutra, he had also practiced with their
Evilbreaker Secret. The Evilbreaker power he possessed was actually
stronger than what Dragon Thirteen had.</p>
<p>Even amongst the Demon, it was a secret that Sharon harbored
Dragon blood. Sharon wouldn’t use Evilbreaker powers on a whim. Now
he was worried enough to use them without a second thought. He just
wanted to kill the silver xenogeneic as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>Sharon kept striking the silver glass bug’s shield and making it
flash. The armor was wreathed with more and more cracks, and it
looked as if it’d break very soon.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug lost its will to fight before long, and it
sought to escape. It was unable to, as Sharon pursued it like a
ghost. He kept attacking it with his scimitar.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen continued chasing Han Sen, but she felt
nervous.</p>
<p>Even though she had the title of bravest, that did not mean the
Dragon were the strongest. And she felt as if she could no longer
suppress the man who had just broken two Sky Heart Locks.</p>
<p>A cold light glowed within her, and her lance was like a dragon
itself. Dragon Thirteen, with the Evilbreaker Lance, was firing on
all cylinders. But when the lance pierced through Han Sen’s body,
she knew she had failed.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body exploded like a balloon. It was just a clone. The
real Han Sen was twenty meters away, smiling at her.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen lifted her screw-shaped lance to attack Han Sen
again, but Han Sen quietly told her, “If I were you, I would not
move.”</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen coldly hmph’d and ignored Han Sen’s warning. She
moved forward.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The sound of armor cracking played in Dragon Thirteen’s ears.
Her armor was annihilated by the knife silks. But this time, the
knife silks were able to cut her skin. Like strands of steel wire,
the silks were unbroken.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved his Blood Feather Knife. It looked as if no power
was being mustered, but the many invisible strands of silk twisted
together to bind Dragon Thirteen’s body. As Han Sen waved the
knife, he pulled them in closer.</p>
<p>Countless silk strands tightened around her arms, legs, waist,
and head. Dragon Thirteen’s body was tied up, suspending her in the
air. Her armor eventually shattered into nothing but pieces.</p>
<p>The knife silks were starting to dig into her skin. Her pale
white body was covered in marks of blood, but the blood that came
out was in stark contrast to the beauty of her pale white skin.</p>
<p>“D*mn you!” Dragon Thirteen shouted angrily. Evilbreaker powers
surged out of her body to destroy the knife silks binding her.</p>
<p>But the moment she got rid of them, more knife silks arose to
take their place. They bound her again, and she could no longer
draw closer to Han Sen. She hung in place.</p>
<p>“It looks like you have run out of chances. It’s still not too
late to beg for your life, as I am willing to spare you.” Han Sen
was clutching his Blood Feather Knife, staring at Dragon Thirteen
who had been tied up. He said the same thing she did.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>Dragon Thirteen’s Evilbreaker power exploded. It snapped the
knife silks, but using her body to break the ties that bound her
caused her even greater wounds. She was bleeding profusely from
everywhere.</p>
<p>“The body of a Dragon is strong,” Han Sen complimented her.</p>
<p>After Dragon Thirteen escaped from the knife silks, her eyes
were burning. With her lance, she again tried to attack Han Sen.
But just as she raised it to strike, the knife silks were back to
tie her up like a doll again.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood in front of her, but she could not attack. Every
time she cut the knife silks, more arose to entangle her. She could
not move at all.</p>
<p>“It is time to end this.” Han Sen’s Blood Feather Knife was
shrouded in a purple mist. The knife silks had a purple air,
too.</p>
<p>Endless numbers of knife silks cut Dragon Thirteen’s flesh.
Purple mist seeped into her wounds.</p>
<p>“Teeth power.” Dragon Thirteen looked pale.</p>
<p>Teeth powers dealt more damage than her Evilbreaker powers did.
There was no chance for any person to survive, once they were
struck by it. And with the countless wounds already across her
body, there was no hope of her escaping now.</p>
