<p>“Even if Han Sen’s Break World rate was at the almighty sum of
99%, he should have been refined by now,” Floating Kill thought. To
play it safe, he did not bring back his sky floating kill just yet.
He let it remain in the area, readying himself for its retrieval
when the displacement of time had gone by. Only then would he bring
back the sky floating kill.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a golden light was coming from the sky floating kill.
It was shaking. In the next second, the whole of the sky floating
kill exploded. It became small bits of sand that scattered about
everywhere.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body fell out from within it. It seemed that it had
not done him any harm. It had not reduced him to blood water. Not
even his clothes had been harmed by the time he had spent inside
it.</p>
<p>“Blergh!” When the sky floating kill shattered, Floating Kill
coughed up a bevy of blood to coincide with it. His eyes opened
wide. He looked at Han Sen’s unharmed figure in complete
disbelief.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at his fists and froze in place. It had been a
random punch. It was not some extreme power that he had mustered,
but the miraculously solid sky floating kill had still been
rendered little more than dust in the wind.</p>
<p>When Floating Kill reacted, he instantly turned around and
wanted to run away. A chill was running down his spine. His heart
was even colder.</p>
<p>The sky floating kill, boosted by the wretched advance of time,
had been unable to damage Han Sen. Therefore, how scary could such
a man’s body be? Aside from Qin Xiu, Floating Kill had never
witnessed someone so scary.</p>
<p>He knew he would be unable to fight Han Sen. Floating Kill did
not dare hang around and fight Han Sen. He wished he could run
faster. Floating Kill had not seen someone this scary ever
before.</p>
<p>Since he knew he would not be able to beat Han Sen, Floating
Kill did not dare stay there and fight the man. The stone clock was
still spinning, so he could not escape. Floating Kill kept
traveling between the stone clock areas in a desperate bid to
escape.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the speed of every clock area was different.
Floating Kill was heavily affected by each of them. It was fine to
be in a time area where time ran fast. When it came to a time area
that ran really slow, Floating Kill’s motions were much slower.</p>
<p>Han Sen chased after Floating Kill at a pace that was not too
fast. No matter which stone clock’s area he entered, he was not
affected.</p>
<p>“This body is not affected by the passage of time.” Han Sen was
more than pleased with this result. He hurried up, wanting to catch
up with Floating Kill.</p>
<p>When Han Sen wanted to use his powers, his body did not adhere
to the desires of his mind. He lacked the speed necessary to catch
up.</p>
<p>“What is wrong with this body?” Han Sen felt a little bit
depressed. He still kept up his pursuit.</p>
<p>Floating Kill kept on escaping, but he suddenly stopped. Up
ahead, there were two areas he could go for. One area’s stone clock
was spinning at the speed of light. The other one stone clock’s
needle barely even moved.</p>
<p>Floating Kill’s lifespan was very high, but he did not dare go
into a fast area like that. That speed might have cost him 10
million years in a single second. Even he would not have been able
to hold strong against a force of time like that.</p>
<p>As for the other area, time was almost still. If he went inside,
he might have stopped moving and become frozen in time.</p>
<p>He watched Han Sen approach him. Han Sen was not very fast and
not very slow because he could not be as fast as normal. In
Floating Kill’s eyes, Han Sen was still a very scary man. He felt
like a mouse being toyed with by a cat.</p>
<p>“Goddamn asshole!” Floating Kill was very angry. As Han Sen kept
playing with him, it made his fear of Han Sen even deeper. He did
not even have the courage to fight or threaten Han Sen anymore.</p>
<p>If he knew Han Sen could not catch up, which was why he was not
fast and not slow, he would have likely felt much different.</p>
<p>Floating Kill gnashed his teeth. He was headed for the stone
clock area that was extremely slow in its advance. He also took
something out.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Floating Kill flash with a blue light. It was like
blue seawater was wrapping up his body. He then entered the nearly
still time area.</p>
<p>In the area where time was stopped, he should not have been able
to move. When Floating Kill went inside, he was not stalled by
time. He was able to go forward. He was, however, very slow. He was
not much faster than a turtle crawling.</p>
<p>Floating Kill kept rushing forward. He felt relieved. He looked
at the blue crystal orb and felt much better.</p>
<p>“Luckily, when I went to time sky, Mister Leader gave me this
space crack orb. Had I not received this gift, I would have been
killed by Han Sen’s hands today. With the protection offered by
this orb, I can travel through the time area. Even an absolutely
still time area will not be able to stop me. That Han Sen will
never be able to catch up.” Floating Kill looked back having all
those smarmy thoughts to himself.</p>
<p>When he looked back, Floating Kill’s face changed. He saw Han
Sen enter the still time area without his speed slowing down the
smallest mote. He was still coming for him at an ordinary pace. It
was then that his face turned pale.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Floating Kill rush to the silent area. He thought,
“Floating Kill must have a death wish. If he ran elsewhere, I might
not have been able to chase him. Now, he is a very dead man.”</p>
<p>While he was thinking about this, Han Sen walked in. Just like
before, this place was an area where the time power did nothing to
inhibit his body. Han Sen was behind Floating Kill in no time at
all.</p>
<p>“I am going to fight you!” Floating Kill was angry. His face was
twisted as he felt forced to gather power. He generated the sky
floating kill, moving to suppress Han Sen.</p>
<p>The time in that nearly still area made his motions awfully
slow. Even the sky floating kill was becoming slower and slower in
its advance.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not back off. He raised his fist and moved toward
the sky floating kill.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The sky floating kill exploded with a single punch. It was
quickly turned into a sky full of yellow dust. After the punch, Han
Sen’s fist was not stalled. It was still going further, punching
toward Floating Kill’s chest.</p>
<p>Floating Kill did not have a chance of dodging the strike. He
gnashed his teeth and put all his power into the space crack orb.
The blue water images were clearer. He wanted to use the space
crack orb’s power to block Han Sen’s punch.</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s punch landed on the blue watermark, the blue
watermark shattered. It was unable to withstand Han Sen’s fist for
a single second. It just instantly broke. Even Floating Kill’s
space crack orb was shattered.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen’s fist come thrusting into his chest, Floating
Kill’s eyes opened wide. He looked very shocked. In the end, he
thought, “Perhaps Han Sen is scarier than Mister Leader.”</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Before his thoughts ended, Floating Kill’s body was punched open
by Han Sen’s manic fist. He was reduced to a bloody mist.</p>
<p>Floating Kill’s Break World rate was almost maxed out, but he
had not been able to resist one of Han Sen’s punches.</p>
