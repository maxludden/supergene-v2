<p>When everyone saw the skies of the systems of chaos, they all
looked happy.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around as they emerged, but he couldn’t see a
Black Hole Spider anywhere. The space crack they had just exited
hung like a rift in the sky.</p>
<p>Once they fully left the rift, a short knife flew out behind
them. That knife was shaped like a dagger that was only one foot
long. It was curved like a crescent moon and white like a fang.
Space distorted around the small weapon as it moved.</p>
<p>Yisha was holding a curved scabbard. When the fang-like knife
reached her, she slid it into the scabbard and attached the
scabbard to her waist.</p>
<p>The space crack lost the support of her Teeth Knife, and in
seconds, it had collapsed and disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>“Master, what kind of knife is that? Why is its presence so
familiar to me?” Han Sen couldn’t help but ask Yisha. That
moon-like Teeth Knife had Teeth powers. And they certainly weren’t
ordinary Teeth powers.</p>
<p>“This is the knife that belonged to my race’s alpha. It is
called Break Space Teeth. If I hadn’t had this knife to open the
space tunnel to get to you, it would have been impossible for me to
get into the Black Hole Spider’s belly to save you,” Yisha said,
her face impassive.</p>
<p>“Teacher, how did you know we were inside the Black Hole
Spider’s belly?” Han Sen had been wondering this since she first
appeared.</p>
<p>Even though she had Break Space Teeth, which could open a space
tunnel, Yisha would have needed to know where Han Sen was before
she could jump to him. How could she have so accurately leaped into
the Black Hole Spider’s stomach to save him?</p>
<p>If she had made the tiniest mistake, such as opening a space
tunnel inside the gruesome flesh of the Black Hole Spider and
alerting the gross fiend, Yisha would have probably met a grizzly
end. She wouldn’t have been saving anybody.</p>
<p>“While no one else knows of your return, let us head to Sky
Palace,” Yisha said simply. She didn’t answer Han Sen’s
question.</p>
<p>If Yisha wasn’t going to answer, then there was no point in Han
Sen asking her again. He continued to follow Yisha as she traveled
through the systems of chaos.</p>
<p>With Yisha there, leading the way, their path was much safer.
Han Sen had unlocked the ninth-tier of his Blood-Pulse Sutra during
his time inside the Black Hole Spider’s belly. The Story of Genes
had been leveled up, too.</p>
<p>It was just as Han Sen expected. As The Story of Genes’ area
increased, the strength of his body increased along with it. His
connection with the black crystal armor had also become clearer and
more defined.</p>
<p>“If I become half-deified, will I be able to manually activate
the black crystal armor?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>The white tiger followed them out. It flew along with them, not
looking as if it wanted to leave.</p>
<p>It was weird. When they left the Black Hole Spider’s belly, the
mushrooms on their heads died and didn’t grow back.</p>
<p>But the white tiger’s head still had a mushroom on it, and that
mushroom showed no signs of dying. Everyone else, however, was
quite pleased to see their mushrooms shrivel and fall away. It was
as if a weight had been lifted off their shoulders as a grand
crisis was resolved. But Yisha looked at the white tiger and said,
“Inside the Black Hole Spider’s belly, nothing below the rank of
deified can survive. If you all survived this long, you should be
thanking the mushrooms you were given.”</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were shocked. They had viewed their
mushrooms as something of a curse. They had never realized that the
mushrooms were protecting them. They looked at Yisha with a gaze of
disbelief.</p>
<p>“You think it’s that easy to live inside the Black Hole Spider’s
belly?” Yisha asked sternly. “There are scary powers in there that
you couldn’t even see. The powers in that place are like viruses
that can invade the bodies of anything. They break down entire
creatures into nothing but raw nutrients to feed the Black Hole
Spider. Without a deified body, it is impossible to withstand or
even notice those powers before it is too late. Even with a deified
body, survival is not guaranteed. The mushrooms that the big white
cat placed on your heads are the only reason you guys were able to
survive there for the duration you did.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard Yisha say this, he suddenly had a flashback
to the information he discovered inside the broken battleship. He
thought to himself, “When that woman conducted the tests that we
saw, was it to allow the white cat to survive there? If what Yisha
says is true, then it seems pretty likely. The mushroom on the
white cat was probably invented by that woman. It was a vaccine to
resist the viruses that would have otherwise ravaged the white
tiger’s body. We were saved by it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t sure if “vaccine” was the right word to describe
a mushroom with magical healing powers, but he decided to go with
it. “So, ever since we first arrived in that place, the white tiger
was sustaining our lives. Without it, even if I survived, everyone
else would have died.”</p>
<p>“But how did that woman get inside the Black Hole Spider’s belly
in the first place? And why did she leave by herself, leaving the
white tiger behind?” Han Sen really wanted to find that woman and
ask her. But he had no clue where she might be found.</p>
<p>Ever since they parted ways in Two World Mountains, he never
heard from her again.</p>
<p>“What is up with you?” Yisha asked, looking at Han Sen’s
head.</p>
<p>Bao’er was sitting on Han Sen’s shoulders, playing idly with Han
Sen’s fox ears. She kept squeezing them. She seemed to be having a
lot of fun with them.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Yisha about what had happened in the tunnels under
the island, and when Yisha heard what he said, she looked stunned.
“Let me see the jian.”</p>
<p>Han Sen brought out the purple copper jian to show Yisha. Yisha
didn’t take it into her hands, but after a while, she nodded and
said, “That’s it! That is the fox’s race weapon.”</p>
<p>“It’s a race weapon?” Han Sen didn’t understand. He had never
heard that term before.</p>
<p>Yisha sighed and said, “Right now, not many know about race
weapons. In ancient times, all the races that lit up a geno lantern
were able to make a gene weapon with the fire of the lantern. That
race weapon would be fused with the genes of the race that forged
it. It would gain incredible power and become a very special
weapon. Some strong race weapons are like true god-level deified
weapons. They might even be stronger. But each gene lantern can
only ever forge one race weapon. The first person that lights up
the lantern receives the weapon. If they light up the gene lantern
again, they won’t get another. Stealing a race weapon is the only
way to get a second one. So, right now, not many creatures know
about race weapons. Even if they encountered one, most people would
just think it was a powerful deified weapon.”</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Yisha said, “The Foxes’ race weapon is
called Nine Spin Destiny Mirror, but from what I know, it was a
race weapon that the Foxes stole. It didn’t originally belong to
them. I have heard that their real race weapon, the one they
received when they lit their lantern, is the purple copper jian.
I’ve never seen it myself, but I think that might be it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was thrilled to hear that, because the Nine Spin Destiny
Mirror was also in his hands. He just didn’t know how to use the
Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. He heard from Fox Queen that the Nine
Spin Destiny Mirror only worked for Foxes who became deified. He
didn’t know if that was the truth.</p>
<p>“Teacher, is there a way to remove this ailment of mine?” Han
Sen looked at Yisha, his eyes full of hope. She knew where the
purple copper jian came from, so she must have known a way to fix
it.</p>
