<p>Bury Path God nodded. “I am not sure if Wu Wei Dao Alpha had the
gene prototype or if Qin Xiu really is the Wu Wei Dao Alpha after
reincarnating.</p>
<p>Big sky demon and Ancient Devil retreated into deep thought.
Bury Path God did not say anything more. It was not long before the
entire hall fell silent. It was so quiet that if a pin was dropped,
it would end up shattering people’s eardrums.</p>
<p>“Is Qin Xiu the Wu Wei Dao Palace Alpha?” Han Sen pondered this
too, but he was unable to receive an answer just yet. There was not
a whole lot he knew about the Wu Wei Dao Palace or the alpha, so
there was no proper way for him to compare them.</p>
<p>While he was thinking, something more happened inside that
copper hall. A scary power exploded in the copper hall, scattering
Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura. Once again, he could no longer discern
what was happening there.</p>
<p>When Han Sen witnessed the situation in the copper hall, the
hall was empty. Nobody was there. Big sky demon, Ancient Devil, and
Bury Path God were gone. There were bloodstains on the floor where
they previously were. It was unknown if the bloodstains belonged to
just one of them or all the three of them.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly moved to explore the entire hall. He noticed
there was a door on all four sides. Three of those copper doors
were open. It was unknown which door they departed from.</p>
<p>That place was inside the Destiny Tablet. It had a weird power
that blocked abilities, so Han Sen could not his Galaxy
Teleportation to enter or leave. His Dongxuan Aura was now blocked
by the copper hall too. He could not tell where the three of them
went.</p>
<p>“It looks like I will have to leave via the way I came in from.”
Han Sen used Blood-Pulse Sutra to morph his body into something
that resembled a boneless snake. He entered the rat hole and
followed the path through the copper pillars to reach the copper
wall. He was going to go to the copper hall big sky demon and the
others were previously in.</p>
<p>Han Sen entered the rat hole. He had not left yet when he heard
the sound of gears starting to move. The copper hall he had just
been inside of was slowly opening.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He went into the rat hole and looked
toward the copper door. It was rising to reveal a weird shadow that
belonged to big sky demon.</p>
<p>“How did big sky demon find this place so quickly?” Han Sen was
shocked. He did his best to avoid being discovered by big sky
demon.</p>
<p>Big sky demon entered the hall and looked at the pool. It was
empty. The pool was only half-full. She frowned and asked, “How can
it not be here? Back then, Mister Leader said the gene seed would
be in this pool. Why is it not here now?”</p>
<p>Big sky demon kept talking to herself as she went next to the
pool. She looked at the bottom of the pool and noticed how clear it
was. There were no clues to be found. At the bottom, there was no
seed or anything remotely similar to what she wanted.</p>
<p>“This is weird. Mister Leader would not lie to me. There is a
gene fluid here, and the gene seed can only be grown here. Ergo, it
begs the question, why is it not here? Was the universe rebooted
too much in a rush that resulted in it being erased? Was Mister
Leader not able to put the gene seed inside the gene pool in time?
If that was true, where could the gene seed even be?” Big sky demon
looked around. She then looked at the rat hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Although he knew big sky demon would notice
the rat hole, he was still a bit scared. He hid inside it a little
harder.</p>
<p>Big sky demon said to herself, “The Destiny Tablet has holes in
it. It looks like Mister Leader’s gem eye rat is still alive, but
the gem-eyed rat should not have had what it took to take the gene
seed.” She went closer to the rat hole, trying to find out more
about it.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to hide his presence. He climbed
the copper pillar and tried to go back.</p>
<p>When big sky demon spoke to herself, he was able to confirm he
had taken the prestigious gourd seed that was the gene seed God
Chaos Party’s old leader left behind. That meant he had been able
to retrieve everything he needed there. It was now time for him to
go.</p>
<p>When big sky demon came before the rat hole, she stopped. She
looked at the copper hall’s wall inside the chamber and then said,
“Weird. I seem to remember this was not here before.”</p>
<p>Big sky demon turned around. She stood in front of the wall and
did not move an inch. She was looking at something.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to walk away, but he got curious. He did not
leave yet. He looked at the wall.</p>
<p>In the past, Han Sen focused on the gourd vine and the pool. He
did not pay attention to the walls. He now noticed that there were
some patterns on the wall. Now that he was looking at it, aside
from the carvings in it, there was a depiction of a beast on that
wall. A stone ring was on the beast’s head nose.</p>
<p>Big sky demon looked at it for a while. She reached out her hand
and held the stone ring. She pulled it.</p>
<p>She pulled out the stone ring, which led to the sound of cogs
turning. The wall rose and revealed another copper hall.</p>
<p>It wasn’t really another copper hall. The copper hall behind it
was connected to the copper hall she was in, so it was more of a
wall to split the copper hall in half.</p>
<p>Now, the wall was rising, and the entire copper hall was
showing.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not see what was in that hole before the copper hall
arose, but Big Sky Demon screamed and kowtowed on the floor.
“Mister Leader!”</p>
<p>“No way. Is the God Chaos Party’s leader not dead?” Han Sen
developed a cold sweat. He looked at the hall behind him. There was
a bed in that hall. There was also a woman wearing white clothes.
She was so pretty that she was like a jade statue.</p>
<p>Looking between the eyebrows of the woman, Han Sen got the sense
that she looked like Bao’er. She was very pretty. She was lying on
the bed with her hands holding her jaw. Her eyes were closed as if
she was asleep.</p>
<p>After Han Sen took a closer look, he felt relieved. The woman
looked lively, but it was a jade statue and not something that was
actually alive.</p>
<p>“I did not expect the God Chaos Party Leader to be such a
beautiful woman.” Han Sen was shocked as he looked at the jade
statue.</p>
<p>Big sky demon had found out the secret too. She sighed and wiped
away her cold sweat. She got up off the floor.</p>
<p>“Mister Leader, you almost scared me to death.” Big sky demon
patted herself on the chest. She noticed it was a statue, but she
was still scared by it. She bowed and went peeking around the
bed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was peeking around the bed and jade statue there too. He
saw a book beneath the jade statue. The book was open. He could not
see the cover, but he could see the contents of the text.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to get a better look. When he saw
the contents of the book, he looked strange.</p>
<p>“White Jade Jing is up in the sky. Twelve buildings, five
cities. Fairies are above my head, and my hair grows… No way… Why
is this poem here? Is the jade fairy that made the White Jade Jing
and the other jade fairies the God Chaos Party Leader?” Han Sen was
very shocked.</p>
