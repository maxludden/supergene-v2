<p>“There are many primitive Light Well Lotuses,” the Extreme King
old man said with a laugh. “Consider them as a gift from me. The
Extreme King will still have nothing to do with you. Isn’t that
perfect?”</p>
<p>What he said was kind of soft and hard. It also made sense. If
he was an ordinary person who could not get the true god class
Light Well Lotus, he would not make things any worse by offending
the Extreme King.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was very determined to get the true god class Light
Well Lotus. He was not going to leave now.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak. He looked at the primitive class Light
Well Lotuses around and waved his lance. He broke the Light Well
Lotus.</p>
<p>“Deified Xenogeneic hunted. Light Well Lotus: deified xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
<p>All the Light Well Lotuses were cut by Han Sen. Many
announcements played in his head. Han Sen collected the Light Well
Lotuses he cut down and threw them into his Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>“Deified Xenogeneic hunted. Light Well Lotus: deified xenogeneic
gene found. Deified beast soul obtained.”</p>
<p>After killing a hundred Light Well Lotuses, he finally received
the beast soul announcement. He looked into his Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>[Deified beast soul Light Well Lotus: Bai Sema-type
(incomplete)]</p>
<p>Han Sen was not in the mood to take a look at what the Light
Well Lotus bai sema could do. He continued slashing all the Light
Well Lotuses around. He received 213 Light Well Lotuses. Out of
them all, he only received one beast soul.</p>
<p>After he got all the Light Well Lotuses he could, he went back
to the giant Light Well Lotus. He looked at the Extreme King old
man and said, “For Bai King’s sake, if you leave now, I will not
kill you.”</p>
<p>The Extreme King old man’s expression changed. “You are being
such a bully! Are the Extreme King really that easy to bully?”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you are not going to leave?” Han Sen looked at
the old man as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I am not leaving. What are you going to do to me?” The old man
opened the green metal umbrella and coldly laughed.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes looked weirdly shiny. He stared at the old man’s
eyes and slowly asked, “Do you think that umbrella will safeguard
your life?”</p>
<p>“Maybe I cannot beat you, but if you want to kill me, this lotus
will be destroyed,” the old man said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Really?” One of Han Sen’s eyes suddenly released some weird
light. His eye turned a blood-red color.</p>
<p>In the next second, Han Sen had already gone right through the
light of the green metal umbrella. He entered the old man’s eye by
using the Blood-Eye Evil Eye beast soul eye skill.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Blood was coming out of the Extreme King old man’s right eye.
Even the back of his head had a bloody gaping hole. Han Sen was
holding the Sky Vine Radish God Lance when he reappeared behind the
Extreme King old man.</p>
<p>Green sprouts grew out of the old man’s wounds. They kept
absorbing the Extreme King old man’s lifeforce.</p>
<p>“Argh!” The old man held his eye and screamed. He wanted to
swing the green metal umbrella he possessed. He had only moved an
inch when Han Sen’s lance cut off his arm.</p>
<p>The old man was terrified. He used his other hand to pick up the
one that had been lopped off. He then picked up the green metal
umbrella and flew away. He disappeared in the sky at the speed of
light.</p>
<p>“Go home and tell Bai King I used my life to get this,” Han Sen
said to the elder as he fled. “I deserve it.”</p>
<p>Bai King knew that the Holy Baby was Dollar, and he had almost
got the Holy Baby killed. Han Sen used Dollar’s identity to take
the Light Well Lotus as a demand for respect.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted the Light Well Lotus, but he did not want the
Light Well. Han Sen looked at the giant Light Well Lotus. He used
the Sky Vine Radish God Lance to strike its root.</p>
<p>With the power of the Sky Vine Radish God Lance, Han Sen slashed
it a dozen times to cut it.</p>
<p>“Deified Xenogeneic hunted. Light Well Lotus: deified xenogeneic
gene found. Deified beast soul obtained.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was very happy. He did not expect to get another beast
soul. He had a look inside his Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>[Deified beast soul Light Well Lotus: Bai Sema (perfect)]</p>
<p>Seeing the word “perfect,” Han Sen was made even more thrilled.
It was a perfect-class beast soul. It was equal to a true god class
beast soul. He still did not know what the Light Well Lotus bai
sema was for.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the giant Light Well Lotus inside his Destiny’s
Tower and summoned the Light Well Lotus bai sema.</p>
<p>Surpassing Han Sen’s expectations, the Light Well Lotus bai sema
beast soul was quite different from the bai sema beast soul he had
before. It was not a bai sema with Han Sen’s body for a center.</p>
<p>The shadow of a Light Well Lotus was in front of Han Sen. That
Light Well Lotus was the center. It opened up a holy light bai sema
that was 30,000 feet long. It covered the entire area.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood inside the bai sema, but he did not feel his speed
or power receive a boost. He did not detect any defensive
properties within the Light Well Lotus bai sema either.</p>
<p>Seeing the Light Well Lotus’s shadow release a holy light, Han
Sen jumped. He used the Sky Vine Radish God Lance to cut his
finger. He had a deep wound. In the Light Well Lotus’ bai sema, the
wound on Han Sen’s finger quickly healed. The damage was instantly
reversed.</p>
<p>“Healing bai sema.” Han Sen was delighted by this discovery. A
bai sema like that was very rare, and it was a true god class bai
sema on top of that. It was very effective. Even though his body
could heal fast, the sort of healing power he had now must have
been the best throughout the entire universe.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried it out a few times. He soon discovered a major
problem. The Light Well Lotus bai sema’s healing holy light did not
concern itself with the differences between friend and foe. It did
not matter who it was inside. The bai sema would have graced them
with its healing power.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “That means I have to be careful when I make
use of this. Otherwise, it may become a shield for the enemy.”</p>
<p>He took all of the Light Well Lotuses with him as he departed
the Light Well. The news concerning Dollar attacking the Light Well
spread across the entire universe.</p>
<p>“The world is messed up. Even the Extreme King were robbed.”</p>
<p>“With the god palaces appearing, it must be a sign of chaos. The
universe is not going to be stable anymore.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the Extreme King, Bai King heard what the blind old man had
to say and sent him away. He sat alone and said, “I am afraid that
kid is not going to stop.”</p>
<p>After remaining silent for a bit, Bai King summoned an officer.
He told the officer, who was a messenger, to deliver a message for
him. “Wherever Dollar goes, our people cannot stop him. Let him
take whatever he wants.”</p>
<p>The messenger froze for a while after hearing what Bai King
said. He could not react. Ever since he had been born, he had not
heard the Extreme King issue orders like that.</p>
