Dragon Eight tried to force himself to get up, but the figure on the coin was displaying a mighty number eight. His hands trembled in exertion as he attempted to rise, but nothing came of it. He couldn’t get up.

Dragon Eight’s dragon fire was burning like a bonfire, but try as he might to rise, he just couldn’t get back on his feet.

*Ding!*

The number on the coin was now an almighty nine. Dragon Eight couldn’t hold the force back anymore. His hands were pressed into stones that buckled under the weight and crumbled, leaving him to slowly sink into the earth.

Dragon Eight roared and cut off half of his own head again.

His body was free for a sparse few moments, but the coin appeared back on his forehead in precisely the same spot in less than a second.

Pang!

There was a loud noise, and Dragon Eight’s body slammed back into the ground.

All of the people and creatures watching this horrid spectacle were frozen. The elites of the Dragon were dismayed at Dollar’s chilling performance.

When the coin’s number ticked over to ten, Dragon Eight could no longer resist. He collapsed and let his body sink into the earth without restraint. Gritting his teeth, Dragon Eight tore up the sheet of paper. With a body contorted under the tremendous pressure, he left the Geno Being Scroll in defeat.

The fight came to an end, but when all was done, no one was sure how to describe what they had just witnessed.

No one had ever heard of a “human,” and what was that geno art? An unknown name had suddenly shot to stardom faster than the speed of light.

Although Han Sen did not tell anyone the geno art’s name, it was commonly referred to as Dollar.

“Dollar is awesome! It was even able to pin down Dragon Eight!”

“Dollar is incredible! His body is as strong as a Dragon’s. It’s rare to see a performance like that even amongst the higher races.”

“Human? What is this race? I’ve tried to do some research, but I haven’t found anything about their origin.”

“I couldn’t find anything about them, either. Did he make them up?”

“He might have, but that does not discredit how strong Dollar himself really is.”

If he keeps winning like this, he is sure to go up against Lone Bamboo of the Sky. Now that will be a show to watch!’

Everyone in the universe was raving about the human Dollar and his Dollar. But two women in particular were gritting their teeth.

“Dollar! You are finally here.” Yisha’s face turned dark. She had sought Dollar for the longest time, but since their last encounter, she had found no trace of him. Dollar was now participating in the Geno Being Scroll, but where he was joining from, she hadn’t a clue.

In that universe, the Geno Being Scroll could be entered from anywhere.

The other person who hated Dollar was called Hai’er. She wanted her revenge on him. She had used the resources of the Pirates to learn of his whereabouts, but she had come up empty.

These two women ground their teeth. It was torture to watch Dollar merrily waltz his way through every opponent he encountered in the Geno Being Scroll. And on top of that, there was nothing they could do about it.

Yisha’s next opponent was sure to be in bad luck. She was on a King class battlefield, whereas Dollar was on a Marquise battlefield. They couldn’t fight no matter how much she wanted to, but all that pent-up rage had to go somewhere. And that meant her next combatant would be the unfortunate recipient.

The poor King that went up against Yisha was swiftly wrecked. He couldn’t fight back in the least. If he hadn’t ripped up the paper quickly, it’d have been a fairly brutal murder.

“Fuck you! It’s just a ranked match. You don’t need to hit that hard!” The King cradled his battered body and started to fancy some revenge himself.

Dollar became incredibly famous. The title of Human Dollar was one of much renown now, and it wasn’t just the Marquises that were interested in him. Because of how mysterious Dollar was, people became all the more fascinated with his geno art.

The contestants who knew they would have to face Dollar researched his geno art even more frantically than the rest.

If they couldn’t find a way to counter Dollar, they knew that they’d lose in a most spectacular fashion.

Every race sent a researcher to watch Dollar’s fights. They desperately wanted to discover a way in which they might deal with a hostile Dollar. Every time a new geno art was discovered, such things would take place. The pursuit of knowledge was always ongoing.

But the geno arts usually researched were King class or deified geno arts. Lower tier geno arts rarely drew much attention. Dollar was cast by a Marquise, so it was strange for so many people to invest time in researching it.

The reason why every race focused on Dollar was because Dollar was able to suppress even the Dragon’s Evilbreaker powers. It also seemed as if it could keep growing in strength. Those two points were enough to draw the attention of every race.

And this was only a Marquise’s use of it. They worried about what could be achieved if a King or deified person used it. Just thinking about that was enough to give such dreamers a chill.

If they could not find a way to overcome Dollar, the Kings would never feel safe.

But after the fight with Dragon Eight, no other opponent had been able to get Han Sen to cast Dollar.

Han Sen beat them all with simple strength. It was something that came as a grand disappointment to those who wished to research Dollar in finer detail.

Littleflower came against his next opponent, and it was a white tiger. Littleflower swung his fist, and when the little fist was going to come into contact with the white tiger’s face, he disappeared and appeared behind the tiger. The fist was driven in the direction of the tiger’s bum.

Seeing the fist on its way to smack its butt, the tiger’s body blurred. Littleflower punched through the tiger, revealing it to be little more than a shadow.

Behind Littleflower, the tiger bared its teeth in a savage grin. Its claws were like lightning, soaring to strike Littleflower’s skin. But in the next second, the white tiger’s smile froze. When it touched Littleflower, the boy’s body was revealed to be a shadow, too.

Another Littleflower appeared to the left of the tiger. He kicked the creature in the belly.

The white tiger disappeared the moment Littleflower’s foot came into contact with its belly. The two of them then flashed and flashed between each other around the mountain. They disappeared and reappeared continuously, making spectators dizzy.

“He really is from Sacred! He can fight the white tiger’s teleportation.” The dog-faced elder standing in the desert frowned.
