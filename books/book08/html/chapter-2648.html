<p>When the potential reward was high enough, Han Sen could be a very patient man. He squatted down near the lake, and he didn’t move for half the day. In fact, in all that time, he didn’t even blink. He was hoping he would be able to fish something out.</p>

<p>Bao’er spun her gold sword around, playing with it casually. But after a while, she grew tired of the weapon. She put it away inside her little gourd. She returned to Han Sen’s side with her hand on her jaw. She watched him fish.</p>

<p>Han Sen was very jealous of her ability to use the gold sword, but there was nothing he could do about it. It was similar to when he needed to make use of Wind String. He had been able to fire the legendary bow, but he preferred using the Six-Core Snake Bow due to its adherence to his will.</p>

<p>“Are big gold swords the only thing that this lake contains?” Han Sen wondered. He didn’t think things would be that simple, though. If it was that easy to obtain deified treasures, the Very High wouldn’t have been beaten by Sacred long ago.</p>

<p>While Han Sen was in deep thought, he felt his Underworld Silk twitch. The vibration ran gently through his fingers.</p>

<p>“I’ve got something!” Han Sen jumped. He quickly yanked the Underworld Silk back and began reeling it in. It didn’t, however, feel as heavy as last time. There was little resistance, so whatever it was had to be lighter. Han Sen thought to himself, “It doesn’t seem like it is another giant sword. Could it be a dagger instead? Or maybe an arrow? It has to be something. If it’s a smaller item, maybe I can use it with my Six-Core Snake Bow, at least.”</p>

<p>Bao’er happily helped Han Sen pulling the line in. With the two of them working together, it wasn’t long until they had brought their catch out of the mist. Just like the last time, when they pulled something out of the lake, it felt as if an elastic band had been broken. The Underworld Silk suddenly bounced up.</p>

<p>Han Sen was prepared this time, however. He stood solidly and didn’t fall over. He stared at what was attached to the Underworld Silk this time.</p>

<p>“What is this?” Han Sen saw an old piece of yellowish paper on the end of the line. He reached out his hand and pulled the paper free.</p>

<p>When he brought it closer to his face, he confirmed that the piece of paper was exactly what it looked like.</p>

<p>“This Underworld Lake is so weird. How can I fish out paper?” Han Sen opened the old, wrinkled paper. He noticed that there was a drawing on it.</p>

<p>Han Sen almost coughed up lots of blood upon seeing what was inside it. He quickly closed it and pushed Bao’er’s head away. He was not going to let her see the illustration.</p>

<p>“What the hell? What is this? Why did I fish out porn?” Han Sen felt depressed.</p>

<p>Bao’er had fished up a deified xenogeneic treasure, whereas Han Sen had pulled out a pornographic image. It was very beautiful, he had to admit. He only looked at it once, but his nose almost bled.</p>

<p>“It seems as if what can be fished up isn’t fixed. If people could just randomly fish up deified treasures, the Very High would be very rich.” Han Sen thought this was to be expected.</p>

<p>But if there was still a chance of fishing up deified treasure, then Han Sen wasn’t about to miss the opportunity. So, he lowered the Underworld Silk and went back to patiently waiting.</p>

<p>This time, it took a much shorter time before the line twitched again. It had only been an hour when the Underworld Silk began to move.</p>

<p>Han Sen was so happy, and he pulled the line. Bao’er came over to help, and so they reeled in their freshest catch together again. As the two of them worked, Han Sen prayed, “Give me a deified treasure… Give me a deified treasure…”</p>

<p>Bo!</p>

<p>Something came flying out of the lake. When Han Sen saw it clearly, his face almost collapsed.</p>

<p>It looked like another sheet of paper. It looked similar to the last one he had brought up.</p>

<p>Indeed, when Han Sen took the catch in his hands, it was the same old, yellow paper.</p>

<p>He gripped Bao’er’s head and moved it away. He opened the old sheet of paper to reveal another pornographic image.</p>

<p>But this was different from the last one. The people depicted were the same as before, but they were doing things in a different position.</p>

<p>“Holy crap! Is this whole thing a comic?” Han Sen felt depressed.</p>

<p>“Dad, I want to fish, too,” Bao’er said, as she looked at Han Sen.</p>

<p>“Sure, it can be your turn to try.” After Han Sen put down the Underworld Silk, he passed it to Bao’er.</p>

<p>Bao’er gave him a pleased grin. She took the silk and squatted near the lake’s edge. She stared at the lake intently, as if she was afraid of missing this opportunity to fish.</p>

<p>Han Sen went back to researching the geno arts he had been given. He was still interested in fishing, but he had received two pornographic images in a row. So, he was no longer in the mood.</p>

<p>Very Real Body was a high-class geno art. Han Sen followed the teachings and practiced with it. The cells in his body grew numb, as if electrical currents were zapping them. It was a sensation that surged through him from the tips of his toes to the top of his head, reaching into every nook and cranny within him.</p>

<p>But the effect was still very weak. It would take a long time to practice, but over time, he should be able to turn his own body into a dangerous weapon.</p>

<p>“Dad, I got something!” Bao’er shouted, interrupting Han Sen’s practice.</p>

<p>Han Sen helped Bao’er reel the line in. It felt so very heavy this time, and it had Han Sen thinking, “Another beautiful, enormous sword?”</p>

<p>“Dad, I wonder what I got this time?” Bao’er babbled in excitement. She didn’t really care about procuring more items for herself, but the mystery of what she might pull out of the lake was tantalizing.</p>

<p>She was like a gambler, riding the lightning for all the life and death excitement she could find.</p>

<p>“Pull it out and you’ll find out.” Han Sen kept tugging, and before long, they yanked the catch out.</p>

<p>The thing that emerged from the mist arced above them like a rainbow and fell toward them, shining like a piece of the sun itself.</p>

<p>Han Sen couldn’t see what it was due to the intense gleam, but he could feel that it possessed a scary presence. He didn’t dare touch it, and he pulled Bao’er aside.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>That shining thing landed on the shore. Once it hit the ground, the light grew dimmer. Han Sen could look at it safely now. He discovered that the item wasn’t as big as he initially thought. It was actually rather small. It was curved like a rainbow, and there were three gems shaped like a sun, moon, and star embedded within it. It looked very pretty.</p>

<p>“What is this?” Han Sen asked, his voice confused.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful hair clip.” Bao’er happily picked up the item and put it in her hair. She turned around, looked at Han Sen, and asked, “Dad, does it look good?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it looks very nice,” Han Sen said while staring at the hair clip.“A hair clip? It looks like you can fish anything out of this lake, but judging from the power inside it, this item is rather extraordinary. It seems rather easy to get grand treasures from this lake.” Han Sen was so tempted. He told Bao’er, “Bao’er, how about we take turns fishing?”</p>

<p>Bao’er had received a beautiful hair clip. She was so happy. She nodded and gave Han Sen the Underworld Silk.</p>

<p>Han Sen started fishing again. And he took turns with Bao’er. The two of them created quite a ruckus as they fished.</p>

<p>“Come out! Give me a treasure…” Han Sen was shouting.</p>

<p>A piece of yellow paper came soaring out of the lake.</p>

<p>“Ah, what is this? It looks so pretty!” said Bao’er’s voice.</p>

<p>A piece of yellow paper… Bao’er’s excited voice… A piece of yellow paper… Bao’er’s excited voice… The same process repeated itself over and over on the shores of the Underworld Lake.</p>
