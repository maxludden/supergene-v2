<p>Han Sen was out hunting xenogeneics with Gu Qingcheng and
Elysian Moon. All of a sudden, though, he felt a strange movement
in his Sea of Soul. Han Sen was surprised by this, and so he looked
inside himself. There, he saw the black crystal armor twitching
slightly. For an instant, some sort of vortex appeared around his
body.</p>
<p>The vortex only lasted for a second, though. Then, the black
crystal armor returned to its usual motionless self as if nothing
had occurred.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” Han Sen wondered as he glanced around. He
didn’t see anything dangerous.</p>
<p>Far away, in a certain system inside the core area, Third
Sister’s eyes looked magical. The shadow of a man appeared and
began to grow clearer. The image was on the verge of revealing his
face.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Suddenly, Third Sister screamed and cupped her hands
over her eyes.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, what happened?” Li Keer was shocked. There was
blood seeping out of the gaps between Third Sister’s fingers.</p>
<p>“Someone broke my scrying skill. Who is this Dollar?” Third
Sister lowered her hands. Her eyes were red, and tears of blood
were rolling down her face. Li Keer was shocked seeing this. Third
Sister’s Very High Sense was much stronger than her own. The
powerful Very High had only just used her scrying skill, and her
eyes had been injured. It was difficult to believe.</p>
<p>“Dollar is Dollar. He said he is human!” Li Keer realized she
actually knew nothing about Dollar.</p>
<p>“What is a human? This Dollar isn’t someone ordinary. He broke
my scrying skill. He must have some sort of deified protecting him.
How could someone who doesn’t even have a name possess deified
protection?” Third Sister gritted her teeth as she spoke.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Li Keer’s face kept changing. She hadn’t
expected Dollar to have such a mysterious background.</p>
<p>Both of them spent some time trying to guess where Dollar had
come from. Third Sister didn’t dare try to steal a look at him
again, though. As a result, neither of them could come up with a
solid idea for who he truly was.</p>
<p>“I want to see who he is.” Third Sister lowered her hands
emotionlessly. Her eyes had recovered a little. They weren’t
bleeding, but they still looked injured.</p>
<p>She planned on waiting with Li Keer for Dollar to show up so she
could find out who he was.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know the situation of Li Keer and Third Sister.
He was busy killing xenogeneics with Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.
Along the way, he kept practicing using his teleportation talents
and Big Destroyed in combat. Although he was growing more familiar
with both skills, he needed to test out their practical
applications in real fights.</p>
<p>While the three were fighting a metal wolf, someone appeared
before them. When that person laid eyes on Han Sen, he was
immediately recognized.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you aren’t dead?”</p>
<p>When he realized someone else was there, Han Sen stopped using
his teleportation skills and Big Destroyed. Turning to take a look,
he noticed it was the Extreme King’s Princess Bai Wei.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked at Han Sen with a conflicted expression.</p>
<p>She thought Han Sen had been killed by Bai Yi. She had always
wanted to help Han Sen and herself. She even wanted to save Bao’er.
Little did she knew that it wasn’t Bai Yi that had killed Han Sen;
it was Han Sen that killed Bai Yi.</p>
<p>And then Bai Wei thought about the things Han Sen had done. She
couldn’t believe the fake prince claimed an Extreme King’s alpha
statue and did so many horrible things in his time with her
people.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about him was the fact that he escaped the
wrath of the Extreme King without being damaged. And he traveled
through the Tianxia System while the Extreme King were pursuing
him. He had done so many shocking things in the universe that it
was hard to fathom. He even grabbed Bai Wuchang and held him as a
hostage. Ultimately, the Extreme King couldn’t do anything to him,
and above all, they’d lost track of him.</p>
<p>Thinking about what Han Sen had accomplished in recent times,
Bai Wei felt as if her own experiences were nothing.</p>
<p>No matter how bad her situation became, at least she was a bona
fide royal amongst the Extreme King. She would always have
resources, and no one would dare try to take her life.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just an outsider, and yet, he had become a very
famous character in the historical annals of the Extreme King. She
was a real royal and yet, compared to Han Sen, it was like he was
in the sky and she was stuck on the ground. There was no way she
couldn’t do all the things he could, she believed.</p>
<p>In the time since they had last met, Bai Wei had changed a lot.
Those changes had happened because she had pondered these questions
thoroughly. It was all due to Han Sen. So, Bai Wei had very complex
emotions when it came to confronting Han Sen again.</p>
<p>Seeing him there now, Bai Wei had no intention of attacking.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, you have now reached King class.” Han Sen
bowed before Bai Wei.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked at Han Sen. A while later, she said, “Just go,
and don’t ever let me see you again.”</p>
<p>But Han Sen still went on to say, “I will never forget how you
took care of me and my daughter. If you need anything in the
future, have someone deliver a message to me. I will do whatever I
can, and I will put my utmost effort into not disappointing
you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen still really liked Bai Wei; after all, she had tried her
best to save Bao’er. He had always felt as if he owed her
something.</p>
<p>“When we meet again, we will be enemies and not friends,” Bai
Wei said. Then, she turned around and flew away from Han Sen in the
opposite direction.</p>
<p>“Then let us hope we never meet again.” Han Sen, Gu Qingcheng,
and Elysian Moon also flew away.</p>
<p>The three of them were traveling through space when Elysian Moon
suddenly stopped. She floated and pointed in the direction of a
planet.</p>
<p>“There is something amiss up ahead.”</p>
<p>“What is wrong?” Han Sen didn’t sense anything unusual coming
from the planet. His Dongxuan Area still couldn’t reach that
far.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon frowned and said, “I don’t know. But I can sense
that an extremely dangerous presence resides on that planet.”</p>
<p>“Is it a xenogeneic or some other sort of creature?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“It should be a xenogeneic,” Elysian Moon said quietly.Han Sen’s
eyes brightened. “A xenogeneic is great. You guys hang back while I
go take a look.”</p>
<p>Han Sen readied himself to attack when suddenly, a bunch of
people came flying over. They were clearly coming toward Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Demons?” Han Sen frowned upon seeing the people with purple
horns approach.</p>
<p>“I am Ji Yang Sheng. I have admired you for a long time, and
finally, I have the chance to see you in person. This is a great
privilege.” A half-deified Demon bowed to Han Sen.</p>
<p>The Demon man looked very pale and very handsome. He was very
polite, too. It would be hard to find a reason to hate him.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Looking at Ji Yang Sheng, Han Sen knew he must have
been quite famous amongst the Demons. Otherwise, Kings and
half-deifieds wouldn’t have been following his leadership.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought to himself, “That Demon protector Moldo wanted
me to come and bless a prince of the Demon. It cannot be this guy,
can it?”</p>
<p>After Ji Yang Sheng bowed before Han Sen, he looked at Gu
Qingcheng and Elysian Moon. Something strange passed through his
eyes, but it only happened for a second. No one noticed it.</p>
