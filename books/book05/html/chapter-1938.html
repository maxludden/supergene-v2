<p>Seeing how shocked Han Sen looked, Hai’er took his reaction for
a confirmation. She then murmured, “We shouldn’t talk here. We
should find someplace else to chat.”</p>
<p>“I think you have the wrong guy; I have no clue about what
you’re talking about.” Han Sen acted through his shock.</p>
<p>Hai’er lifted her lips in a little smile and said, “There is no
use in pretending. I am a thief, and nothing escapes my senses. I
will tell this to a Buddha King; you know what will happen to you
and Speechless if I do, right?”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could put another word in, Hai’er continued. “Oh,
but just so you know, I am not being hostile. Actually, I would
like to strike a trade with you.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Hai’er pulled Han Sen away from Buddha’s
Path. They walked out of the city and went to the banks of a nearby
river.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to hear what she wanted to say, so he didn’t
resist following her out.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s talk here.” Hai’er let Han Sen go, then sat down
atop a rock. She smiled and said, “Given your relationship with
Speechless Buddha Lady, I can only assume you know the secrets to
heaven.”</p>
<p>“What secrets?” Han Sen asked Hai’er.</p>
<p>“Stop pretending! Heaven has opened many times, and many races
have been here. Only ten of them can reach the end, each and every
time. I believe there is a secret to this somewhere.” Hai’er was
peering right at Han Sen when she continued. “With Speechless’
reputation, she must assuredly know how to reach the other side. I
don’t want anything from you. All I want is for you to take me with
you and help me reach the end. If you do, I’ll keep the
relationship between you two a secret. I promise.”</p>
<p>“I think you have misunderstood us. I know Speechless, but we
are not in a relationship with each other. In fact, we have only
ever met twice,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked annoyed by the denial. Her face filled up with
frost and she said, “This is bad. I am going to tell Buddha King
about it right now.”</p>
<p>“So what if he knows?” Han Sen laughed at Hai’er.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked back at Han Sen with disdain. “Still pretending?
You can’t hide anything from a Pirate. ^ every trick in the book to
get others to join their creed. Marriage is one such method. Many
creatures in this universe have been tethered to the Buddha in this
way. Like Happy Buddha King; he was the best in the entire
universe. Yet even he was suckered into one of those arrangements.
Speechless is famous, and she will have a marriage with someone
powerful. It’s a must for her. If Buddha King leams about you two,
do you think he will let you go lightly? You should know about
this.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know the Buddha had such a culture, and he found
it rather interesting.</p>
<p>When Han Sen didn’t respond, Hai’er went on to say, “Others
don’t know the Buddha are this way, but we do. They are not much
smarter than the Pirate, you know. I don’t really like them, and
more than that, I don’t want to expose your story. If you help me,
it is a win-win situation for all of us.”</p>
<p>You know who I am?” Han Sen asked Hai’er.</p>
<p>Hai’er was surprised and said, “How am I supposed to know who
you are? You’re just a lowly Viscount Even if you are famous, the
Buddha won’t let you be with her.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “I am the student of the Rebate called
Knife Queen. This is my first time here, and it marks my third
encounter with Speechless. Nothing else is going on, okay? You are
wholeheartedly mistaken.”</p>
<p>Hai’er frowned at Han Sen. She looked right at him. Seeing him
turn to leave, she tugged at him and said, “Even if the two of you
aren’t together, how about we co-operate anyway? Let’s walk through
heaven together!”</p>
<p>“What benefit is there for us to co-operate?” Han Sen asked
Hai’er.</p>
<p>“There is a lot. I am the number one genius of the Pirate.
Everyone knows the name Hai’er. She is a rare and very talented
person. I will be deified, one day.” Hai’er kept complimenting
herself, showing utterly no embarrassment.</p>
<p>“If you and I co-operate, it would be easier to traverse
heaven.” Hai’er patted Han Sen on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“If you’re as good as you say, why do you need Speechless to
guide you?” Han Sen laughed at her.</p>
<p>Hai’er’s face did not change, and she said, “I am certain I can
get through it, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime affair. It’s good
to take extra precautionary measures, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around and left, ignoring her.</p>
<p>Hai’er followed and pleaded, “Let’s talk about it! State your
conditions.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything about what to expect in heaven, so
following me is pointless.” Han Sen knew Hai’er was suspicious
about the prospect of his relationship with Speechless, so he kept
walking resolutely.</p>
<p>Hai’er gritted her teeth and pulled out something. “You must
know this. If you co-operate with me, then this is yours.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Hai’er’s hands and saw a tablet. It was
palm-sized. There were many words, smaller than grains of rice,
etched into it. There was nothing particularly special about it,
though.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen looked at Hai’er’s tablet dubiously.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked shocked. She stared at Han Sen, and said, “Really?
You don’t know about the Virtual Tablet?’</p>
<p>“What is a Virtual Tablet?” Han Sen looked at it and asked.</p>
<p>Hai’er saw that Han Sen was honestly confused, so she shook it
in front of him and said, “The Virtual Tablet is a powerful
treasure left behind by a mysterious, higher race. It has that
mysterious race’s geno art. When the Buddha received the Virtual
Tablet, they absorbed the talents to become as they are. Many geno
arts have come from this Virtual Tablet. This is one of many. The
Pirate unearthed it from some old ruins, and no one else knows
about this. But it can be yours for the price of a co-operative
partnership.”</p>
<p>“How do I know if this is real or not?” Han Sen was curious.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you Knife Queen’s student? If you let her take a look,
she’ll know the truth. She won’t lie, either,” Hai’er said.</p>
<p>“Okay. If this is real, I will cross heaven with you.” Han Sen
took the tablet. Hai’er had no relationship with Speechless, and
she was practically giving him something for free. He wasn’t going
to reject that.</p>
