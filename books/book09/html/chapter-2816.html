<p>“Kirin power!” Evil Lotus’s face changed. His body brimmed with
a god light that pushed the red light away. The skin on his face
and hair returned to normal.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. They all generated powers to get ready,
but they did not notice there was a problem. It was like the power
had focused solely on Evil Lotus.</p>
<p>“Hmph! The pottery statues have a problem. The pottery powder
has a Kirin power inside it.” Evil Lotus’s god light kept
releasing. Everyone saw the broken statue had scattered some of its
powder onto his body. It resulted in a strong reaction with the god
light. It jumped and sparkled like lightning.</p>
<p>Everyone had been sprayed with the same powder. Second Uncle had
crushed a piece of pottery, but nothing had happened to him.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others were confused, but Han Sen could
guess why this had come to pass. The phoenix fire and phoenix flame
were like that too. They did not deal any damage to any creature,
but they were able to harm the Sky Vine Radish. It seemed as if the
pottery pieces had been created by the same stuff.</p>
<p>“Break all the pottery here. I want to see what the Holy Kirin
is up to,” Evil Lotus said to Second Uncle with a cold and
commanding voice.</p>
<p>Second Uncle’s heart leaped inside his chest. He addressed the
others. “You all heard the man! Mister God wants us to break these
Kirin statues. Hurry up.”</p>
<p>After all, Second Uncle was Meng Lie’s brother. He saw Second
Uncle’s eyes and knew what he meant. He punched toward a Kirin
statue. A whole line of them was broken.</p>
<p>Meng Lie had easily destroyed those Kirin statues. This time, he
broke them hard. He made sure lots of dust was kicked up. He
generated a plume so large that it choked the entire hall.</p>
<p>The dust that touched down on Han Sen’s body and the bodies of
all the others seemed fine. When they landed on Evil Lotus, it
prompted a large reaction to occur with his god light. It made his
entire body become wrapped up by some burning lightning.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus screamed. His body was like a thunderbolt. He raced
out of the palace, looking as if he had been severely damaged.</p>
<p>“Now is the only chance we have to live. Everyone, put some
pottery powder on yourself!” Second Uncle commanded. He collected
many pottery pieces. He crushed them and rubbed them on his body.
Not long later, it looked as if he was a person that had been built
entirely from dust.</p>
<p>Everyone realized that the power in the pottery dust only
affected Evil Lotus God. It did not affect them. Although they did
not know why, they knew it was the best weapon they had against
Evil Lotus.</p>
<p>“Collect more pottery powder! We will need it to escape this
place. We cannot keep digging for him. If we do, it is only a
matter of time before we are all killed.” After speaking, Second
Uncle broke a few more pieces of pottery. He used a pill presser to
store the powder within.</p>
<p>Everyone copied the same method. They broke a few of the pottery
statues and collected the powder.</p>
<p>Han Sen really admired them. Second Uncle, in particular, was
very focused when he was very scared. When the time came for them
to be decisive, he was decisive. He was definitely not an ordinary
person.</p>
<p>“Bai Buyi, do you know what consequences you will bear if you do
this? Do you really think these crappy pottery statues can go
against me? I am a God.” Evil Lotus' voice boomed from outside the
hall.</p>
<p>“Mister God, what are you talking about?” Second Uncle politely
asked. “We have followed your orders to break the pottery statues.”
He and Bai Buyi kept breaking the pottery statues while also
collecting the pottery’s powder.</p>
<p>“Ha!” Han Sen was unable to suppress a laugh. Second Uncle was a
genius. Even now, while gasping, he still said that.</p>
<p>“Good. Very good,” Evil Lotus coldly said from the outside. He
stopped talking due to the anger he was feeling.</p>
<p>“Mister God, we are breaking the pottery statues,” Second Uncle
said. “Is there anything else you would like us to do?”</p>
<p>They did not hear Evil Lotus respond to them anymore. Perhaps he
was too mad to even speak, or perhaps he was doing something else
entirely.</p>
<p>“Be quick! We do not have much time. Try to bring all the
pottery pieces you can. Our return to the Extreme King is entirely
dependent on this.” Second Uncle hurried them up.</p>
<p>Han Sen was collecting pottery statues. Bao Ying suddenly said
with shock, “This Kirin statue has some stuff in it.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Bao Ying. Seeing a Kirin statue that had been
broken by Bao Ying, their attention was snared by the presence of a
metal box.</p>
<p>The metal box was square. It was pitch black and looked
incredibly heavy. On the outside of the box was the carving of a
Kirin.</p>
<p>“It looks like it was left behind by the Holy Kirin, but I
wonder why it chose to leave a box behind here,” Second Uncle said
as he observed the metal box.</p>
<p>“Should we open it?” Bao Qin merrily asked. “Perhaps it contains
some treasure left behind by the Holy Kirin. If the pottery powder
did not hurt us, perhaps something inside this thing can help us
deal with Evil Lotus God.”</p>
<p>Second Uncle was not as optimistic as Bao Qin. He shook his head
and said, “We should not take that risk right now. Bring the box,
but do not open it.”</p>
<p>Londo carefully picked up the box. Nothing went awry. Second
Uncle felt relieved. Everyone went back to collect the pottery
powder.</p>
<p>They broke all the pottery statues inside the palace and
collected the remains, but no other metal boxes were discovered.
There was just that one metal box.</p>
<p>Second Uncle wanted to put the metal box inside a plastic bag
that compressed things, but he noticed he was unable to put it in.
He made Londo carry the box.</p>
<p>“When we exit, we need to use the pottery powder,” Second Uncle
reminded them. “If Evil Lotus comes, everyone just start throwing
the pottery powder. There is no need to use any other powers.”</p>
<p>Everyone now knew what to do, but their hearts were overwhelmed
with worry. They did not know if the pottery powder would really
rival Evil Lotus.</p>
<p>Trying to get back to the Extreme King this way was a long shot.
They had a long way to get back to the safety of the Extreme King.
Even if the pottery powder repelled Evil Lotus, it might not have
been enough to carry them all the way back to the Extreme King.</p>
<p>Because there was no other way to go, they still had to try
despite the danger.</p>
<p>“Mister Holy Baby, please stay next to me,” Bao Ying said as she
looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He stayed next to Bao Ying, followed everyone,
and went outside.</p>
<p>After they exited the palace, they were surprised to no longer
see Evil Lotus God. They were not sure where he had gone off
to.</p>
<p>“Where is Evil Lotus?” Fourth Uncle frowned.</p>
<p>“There is no need to care about him. Let’s just run,” Second
Uncle said. He hurried everyone out of the East Holy Garden.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the group carefully exited the East Holy Garden. On
the way, they did not see Evil Lotus.</p>
<p>“Evil Lotus must know we have the pottery powder to protect
ourselves,” Bao Qin said with a laugh. “I think it is afraid of us
and no longer dares to show up.”</p>
<p>Second Uncle frowned and said, “Run and stop talking crap.”</p>
<p>Everybody got ready to move. Suddenly, they felt the ground
vibrate. It was like a scary beast was running across the ground.
They quickly turned their heads to see where the noise had come
from.</p>
<p>They shockingly saw Evil Lotus slowly approach. He was not
walking fast, but one step was like crossing a mountain and going
over water. Behind him was a scary xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the xenogeneic, Second Uncle’s face changed. “Oh,
no! Evil Lotus is scared of the pottery powder, so he won’t attack
us. But he brought a xenogeneic to deal with us instead.”</p>
