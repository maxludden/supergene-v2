<p>Han Sen looked at her for a minute. She was spoiled and a touch
crazy, but he didn’t want to do as she said. Still, he was not mad.
He laughed casually and said, “I have learned all kinds of
different geno arts. I’m not a master with them, but I have
sufficient skill to use each.”</p>
<p>“The term ‘sufficient’ means different things to different
people. Are you sure you have learned these geno arts
sufficiently?” Yellow Clothes asked seriously. Her face was
solemn.</p>
<p>“I suppose so.” Han Sen didn’t know what was wrong with Yellow
Clothes. She was talking like they were competing, and they had to
find out which of the two was stronger.</p>
<p>“Okay. In that case, I will test you with the most basic sword
skill. Do you know Listening Sword?” Yellow Clothes asked
coldly.</p>
<p>“What is Listening Sword?” Han Sen had never heard of the
skill.</p>
<p>Yellow Clothes didn’t laugh at Han Sen for his ignorance. She
simply explained, “A sword is like a person. A person is like a
sound. We can see a person, but until we speak with them, they
cannot truly become a friend. You only need a voice to communicate.
In that way, we do not learn who people truly are by their
appearance. Swords are this way, too. If you just look at its
appearance, you cannot understand what is inside the sword. You
need to listen to the sword to truly understand the blade. Only
then can you understand it.”</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had heard of this. He thought it
was a very interesting concept, and so he asked, “People talk, but
swords don’t. How can you hear the voice of a sword?”</p>
<p>“The sounds of instruments are not a language, so how can people
listen to music and still understand what emotions it conveys and
what it means? Although a sword does not speak, when you use a
sword to make a sound, you are hearing the voice of the sword. If
you know a sword really well, even if you cannot see the sword, you
can know what sword it is by the sound it makes,” Yellow Clothes
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t believe what she was saying. He looked at Yellow
Clothes and said, “That means I can pull out a sword and randomly
swing it, and by that, Lady Clothes will know which sword I
wield?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Yellow Clothes answered. She did so with absolute
certainty.</p>
<p>“Great. I have a sword, and I would like you to unveil my
sword,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Yellow Clothes turned around and closed her eyes. She
said to Han Sen, “You can swing your sword for me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. Using his body to block her line of
sight in case she peeked, he whipped out his Toxic Umbrella
Mushroom beast soul.</p>
<p>The Toxic Umbrella Mushroom was a weapon beast soul, but it was
not a sword. It was an umbrella. When it was folded, it was three
feet long and could be used as a sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen held the toxic umbrella and waved it around with a
couple of sword skills. He kept using the Dongxuan Area to scan
Yellow Clothes, in case she was using some sort of geno art to see
the umbrella.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too suspicious, though. Yellow Clothes wasn’t using
any geno arts to watch him. She was merely listening to Han Sen
wave his sword around.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only swung his sword twice before Yellow Clothes
said, “That’s plenty.”</p>
<p>Han Sen put the toxic umbrella away. He looked at Yellow Clothes
and said, “Please tell me what my sword sounded like.”</p>
<p>“This sword is bad,” Yellow Clothes coldly said.</p>
<p>“Why is it bad?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“If you’re using an umbrella as a sword, you should focus on
thrusting and sweeping. Your sword skills were just you slashing,”
Yellow Clothes said succinctly.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t surprised. Identifying an item by the sounds it
made wasn’t difficult. Han Sen could do it, too. Many Kings could
do it, so it was nothing special.</p>
<p>Yellow Clothes seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking,
and she said, “Your umbrella sounds very bitter. If I am hearing
this correctly, it is likely a toxic umbrella. Its sounds are very
pure and concentrated. It is likely a King class weapon.”</p>
<p>“You can distinguish its sounds to that level?” Han Sen was
shocked. Even if someone looked at the umbrella, there should have
been no way for them to know that it was toxic. Plus, he was the
only person in the geno universe who used a toxic umbrella beast
soul. There should have been no way for Yellow Clothes to know what
it was. How could she know the toxic umbrella was toxic? Han Sen
was confused by this.</p>
<p>“Everything has its reason for being. I can hear swords, and I
can hear umbrellas. One skill can be like a thousand skills. There
is nothing that can escape my hearing.” Yellow Clothes spoke
naturally as if it was a universal truth.</p>
<p>Yellow Clothes did sound a bit too boastful, though. Not even a
high race alpha would claim to know everything. Yellow Clothes had
said this casually, as if it was no big deal.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking, “If this woman is this cocky despite being
only King class, she must be someone important to the Sky. Why did
I not see her when I was in Sky Palace?”</p>
<p>Yellow Clothes could see what Han Sen was thinking, and so she
fixed her hair and told him, “If you don’t believe me, you can use
a geno art. Without seeing it, I will tell you about it and its
element.”</p>
<p>“Interesting. I want to see this very magical listening skill.”
Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“Yes, please.” Yellow Clothes smiled.</p>
<p>She had tried so hard to get close to Han Sen and speak to him
because she wished to get to know him better. But the best way to
get to know him was to see how he practiced his geno arts.</p>
<p>The theory of listening to sounds was just an excuse that Yellow
Clothes had given so she wouldn’t have to explain her real ability.
Yellow Clothes had practiced a secret skill of the Very High. It
was called Very High Sense, and it could feel anything.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just about hearing. Even if she blocked all seven of
her senses, she could still picture everything around her clearly
in her mind. Her ability to hear and feel would not be
impaired.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t believe what he was being told, though. He paused
for a bit and then turned his hands into stone. It was the
Petrified skill he had learned from Left Crazy.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking, “This Petrified skill makes no sound. I
don’t think she will be able to hear anything.”</p>
<p>He only petrified his hands so his arms could still be used. He
used his arms to swing his fists. Then he asked Yellow Clothes, who
had turned around, “Can you tell what sort of geno art this
is?”</p>
<p>Yellow Clothes used her Very High Sense to feel every single
moment of Han Sen’s movements. She did not turn around, but seeing
it behind her, she said, “Your fists sound very heavy and clumsy.
It feels rather natural. If I am hearing it correctly, you have
employed a petrification skill. And in regards to your punch, if
you want to name it, call it Petrified Punch.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, and he sighed. “Lady Clothes is so
strong.”</p>
<p>“Petrification skills are not mainstream. You use secret geno
arts quite casually. If I name one incorrectly, you do not have to
come to hunt the core bronze tripod with me,” Yellow Clothes coldly
said. She wanted to engage Han Sen’s curiosity so that Han Sen
would use the geno arts he was good at. That way, she could find
out just who Han Sen really was.</p>
<p>Dollar and the race of humans were an oddity in the geno
universe. No one knew where he was from.</p>
