<h2>Battle in the Deep Sea</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2747</h3>

<p>The water around Han Sen became dark blue, and the color started
to drift straight through the substance chains that protected Han
Sen’s body. The color was about to touch down on Han Sen’s body
like a plume of blue smoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes hardened, and his body transformed into icy jade.
He lifted a hand and an icy jade substance chain suddenly
crystallized large portions of the water around him, freezing the
toxic substance chains in place.</p>
<p>Once the toxic powers had been stopped, Han Sen immediately
turned his attention back to Bai Wei and summoned his Immortal
Dragon. “Let’s see if the Immortal Dragon’s power can fix a body
that’s been affected by a toxic substance chain.”</p>
<p>The Immortal Dragon felt Han Sen’s command, and it opened its
immortal substance chains. A holy light landed on Bai Wei, causing
the blue toxic gas around her to fade. In seconds, her skin had
returned to its normal, healthy color.</p>
<p>Bai Wei gave Han Sen a strange glance. She didn’t speak, though,
so Han Sen had to ask, “How do you feel?”</p>
<p>Bai Wei shook her head and said, “There is no problem. I’m
completely fine, as a matter of fact.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt more secure once he had heard that. He looked at
the sphere of blue ice that he had created around them, and then he
threw a punch straight at it. When Han Sen first created the ice,
his icy power had followed the path of the toxic substance chains
as it went. Now, as he shattered the ice, the force of his punch
followed the frozen substance chains back to their origin. At the
end of the long trail of icy shards, a scorpion-like xenogeneic lay
unmoving on the sea floor. It was like an icy sculpture.</p>
<p>Bai Wei gave Han Sen a glance that was even more inscrutable.
Han Sen was just a crystallizer. Despite that fact, and even though
far fewer resources had been available to him than to her, Han Sen
could freeze a deified xenogeneic in a single punch. That power was
super rare even in the upper echelon of the Extreme King. Elites of
the Extreme King could likely never perform such a grand feat
against an enemy of the same level.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked in front of the frozen deified xenogeneic. His
fist blurred down, obliterating the creature’s head in a single
strike. Under the sheer force of Han Sen’s fist, the incredibly
resilient armor of the beast was as weak as a wet tissue.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic deified killed: Deep Blue Sea Scorpion. Deified
xenogeneic gene found.”</p>
<p>An announcement played in Han Sen’s head once the finishing blow
was delivered.</p>
<p>“It looks like deified xenogeneics aren’t that difficult to
kill. Once I take down a few more, fulfilling the 100 deified gene
requirement will be easy. But this Deep Blue Sea Scorpion is too
big. If I have to eat its flesh, I will be casting Consume for many
days,” Han Sen thought to himself. Just as he was about to grab the
body of the Deep Blue Sea Scorpion and drag it away, something
burst through the frozen seawater behind the Deep Blue Sea
Scorpion. An enormous mouth appeared and gulped down the Deep Blue
Sea Scorpion’s body.</p>
<p>“Oh, shit! How dare he steal a kill that I, Han Sen, have
earned! Did you eat a bear’s heart?” Han Sen was so angry. He
stared darkly at the xenogeneic that had just swallowed his Deep
Blue Sea Scorpion.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic looked like an electric eel. Its body was snow
white, and its scales shone like diamonds. Although it wasn’t
trying to attack, its body crackled with white lightning that
looked like silk as it flickered.</p>
<p>After the electric eel swallowed the Deep Blue Sea Scorpion, its
hunger still wasn’t satiated. Its eyes locked on Han Sen and Bai
Wei like a prison spotlight.</p>
<p>The next second, the creature exploded with a burst of
lightning. A bolt of power flashed toward them, and Han Sen reacted
with blinding speed. He generated a substance chain born from
Jadeskin to counter the lightning.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The lightning discharged violently when it slammed into Han
Sen’s counterattack. Han Sen’s hair stood on end as the power swept
over him, leaving his clothes charred and pitch-black.</p>
<p>“This guy can’t be a transmutation xenogeneic, can it?” Han Sen
was shocked by the fact that he hadn’t completely deflected the
lightning’s power. He knew this electric eel was far from
ordinary.</p>
<p>The strike of the electric eel hadn’t killed him, though. It
just sent his body spinning through the blue water. That white
lightning was incredibly powerful, though. The beast cast another
attack, which surged toward Han Sen and Bai Wei like a net of
electricity.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed Bai Wei and hastily dodged. He also cast the
Dongxuan Sutra at the same time, and he unsheathed Ghost Teeth
Knife. He used Under the Sky to slash at the electric eel.</p>
<p>The power that Han Sen could currently emit was enough to defeat
an ordinary primitive xenogeneic, but the electric eel’s lightning
was able to break his offense with ease. Han Sen’s brow furrowed as
he wondered again what level the electric eel was.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A flash of lightning that looked like it came from space landed
on Han Sen. Han Sen didn’t have time to dodge it. His whole body
crackled with the power, and for a split second, it knocked him
senseless. His body fell through the water.</p>
<p>Bai Wai was in even worse shape, and she only stayed upright
because Han Sen was holding her. Her body wasn’t as strong as Han
Sen’s. She was wracked with pain, and her electrified armor
blackened under the power of the electricity. When Han Sen
teleported away with her, the armor couldn’t withstand the
additional force, and it disintegrated into dust.</p>
<p>“Argh!” When Bai Wei recovered from the lightning’s paralysis,
she noticed that her armor had turned to dust. She screamed and
blushed deeply.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have time to admire her. He used God’s Wander to
teleport away from the Buried Dragon Sea. They returned to the
coast.</p>
<p>“You stay here for now. That xenogeneic is too strong. I’m not
confident that I can kill it, so I need to push my luck solo,” Han
Sen said, and then he used God’s Wander to return to the deep
sea.</p>
<p>Although he knew the electric eel was extremely strong, it had
swallowed his prey. He wasn’t going to let that go so easily.</p>
<p>The electric eel had lost track of Han Sen and begun to survey
the area in an intense search. When it eventually found him, it
immediately unleashed a wild burst of lightning. What seemed like
an ocean of lightning was now surging toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart pounded, and a blood-red color swept over his
body. It made his skin look like a bloody shell. His body quickly
changed, turning him into a half-human, half-demon creature. He
looked like some beast that had just crawled out of hell.</p>
<p>It was the Red Blood Demon beast soul. The beast soul wielded a
demonic power, and after Han Sen demonized his body, his strength
increased by heaps and bounds.</p>
<p>Han Sen also clad himself in his Peacock King’s soul robe. The
two beast souls appeared on Han Sen at the same time, making Han
Sen considerably stronger. He summoned power through Jadeskin again
and threw a punch to meet the incoming storm of electricity.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power rushed out, turning everything in front of him
into ice. Even the lightning was frozen beneath the sea. It hung in
the water, still blazing with light through the ice that encased
it.</p>
<p>When the electric eel noticed that its lightning had been
frozen, it became furious. It opened its mouth and fired out a
pillar of lightning like an aurora. Wherever the lightning pillar
went, the ice was broken. Nothing seemed capable of stopping the
advance of that wicked electricity.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at the pillar of lightning. He mustered his own
power, not willing to fall back. He threw a punch forward, aiming
directly for that grand force.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The water exploded away as the two powers collided, forming a
vacuum zone in the sea. The lightning didn’t stop, though, and Han
Sen’s Jadeskin body could do little to stop the lightning that
began surging through his body. He was electrified, and he spasmed
and shook like he was doing a breakdance.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! There’s something strange about this electric eel’s
lightning,” Han Sen thought, his mouth going dry. Ordinary
lightning power shouldn’t have been able to hit him like that.</p>
