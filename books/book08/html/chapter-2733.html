<p>Luckily, although Han Sen wasn’t deified yet, his body was
already as strong as a deified. If he was an ordinary half-deified,
his body would have been completely crushed by the four disrupted
powers.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen hadn’t been completely destroyed yet, the
situation wasn’t good. When the four powers fell out of rhythm,
they began to impact each other with explosive force. No matter how
strong Han Sen’s body was, it couldn’t withstand that type of
collision for long.</p>
<p>Han Sen was doing his best to cast his geno arts. He needed to
get the messed up powers back into their rightful places, but he
quickly realized it would be almost impossible.</p>
<p>When he cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra, it made the Blood-Pulse
Sutra’s power so strong. The other three powers would gather and
counter it. The constant surge of powers made it difficult for Han
Sen to get back on track.</p>
<p>Casting the other three geno arts led to a similar result. Han
Sen could only cast one geno art at a time, too. He had no way of
casting all four at the same time.</p>
<p>His geno arts were in chaos as they sought to balance themselves
out. Han Sen was left unsure of what to do. Try as he might, he
couldn’t find a way to make them all work together.</p>
<p>“I have to take a risk.” Han Sen could feel his body growing
more damaged with every passing second. If he didn’t find a way to
bring his powers under control and get them back on track, he would
probably end up dying at the hands of his own abilities.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have time to second-guess his decision. He split
his mind into four, and he cast the four geno arts at the same
time. He wanted to control the four geno arts simultaneously and
put them back on track, so he would be able to maintain the balance
of the four powers.</p>
<p>He had only managed to cast all four geno arts at the same time
once before. Han Sen hoped to replicate that moment and enable his
four geno arts to run together. That was his only hope for putting
them back on a normal track.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly discovered that casting four geno arts at the
same time was a difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen’s body was injured, casting the four geno arts
wouldn’t have been as difficult. But now, his pulse had been badly
damaged. Plus, the four powers were messed up. Pulling the geno
arts back into rhythm would be harder than casting them had been
before.</p>
<p>The instant that Han Sen cast his four geno arts, he felt the
conflict inside his body grow even more severe. Now the powers were
tearing even deeper into his body.</p>
<p>The pain was like having his heart and lungs ripped loose. Han
Sen couldn’t suppress a scream. It felt like his pulse, his
vessels, and his organs were being torn to pieces by some wretched
power.</p>
<p>He knew he couldn’t stop, though. He had to put those four
powers back on the right track. If he didn’t, it would be a
miserable ending that awaited him.</p>
<p>Han Sen held strong against that pain, and he continued trying
to cast the four geno arts. He wanted them to go back to normal.
But every time he cast them a little, his body became more and more
injured. Blood was pouring out of his wrecked flesh.</p>
<p>“Immortal Dragon.” Han Sen’s heart leaped. The black crystal
came out of his Sea of Soul, looking like the Immortal Dragon. It
began using its immortal substance chains to fix up Han Sen’s
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was being torn apart, but the Immortal Dragon was
fixing it just as fast. Han Sen held strong against his pain and
focused his mind on forcing the four geno arts back into order.</p>
<p>The entire process was excruciating. Anyone with a poor will
would have failed. Han Sen struggled to hold strong against the
pain that felt like his heart was being torn apart and the flesh
was being scraped off his bones. He was slowly guiding the four
geno art powers back onto the right track.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Immortal Dragon had strong healing power.
Otherwise, even if Han Sen had been able to hold on against that
pain, his body would simply have been ripped to pieces.</p>
<p>After one hour of torture, Han Sen finally put the four geno
arts back onto the right track.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the end of the matter. Once the four geno arts
were put onto the right track, they kept running at an insane
speed. They began to generate their prototype substance chains
again, and Han Sen started leveling up to deified once more.</p>
<p>Han Sen realized that he had fallen into an endless cycle. His
body had fulfilled the requirements for becoming deified. In any
normal situation, he would already have ascended.</p>
<p>But the powers of his four geno arts were all trying to become
deified at the same time. When they leveled up, they each needed
his body to support their development. Each power tried to take
over his body completely. That was why there was conflict, and that
was why he had failed to level up the first time.</p>
<p>Fixing his body would lead him to leveling up, but attempting to
level up would always end in failure. If this kept going, Han Sen
would die eventually. Even his powerful will couldn’t sustain him
forever.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to cast only one geno art so that it could become
deified, but he couldn’t do it. That was because his body had
reached 100% deified progress. It was forcing all four of Han Sen’s
geno arts to activate. His body wanted him to level up completely.
It wasn’t possible for him to suppress all but one geno art.</p>
<p>It was like a baby growing. It was impossible for the baby to
only grow one arm or one leg. A child couldn’t let one limb develop
but forbid another part to grow.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen’s situation was like that. He was leveling up
completely. He couldn’t choose a particular part of himself to
ascend. If he leveled up, everything about him would become
deified.</p>
<p>“If I can’t suppress three of my geno arts, I will have to let
all four become deified…” After Han Sen thought about his
situation, he realized that he had to take the risk and try. He
wasn’t going to back out now.</p>
<p>But on the final step, as the four geno arts tried to use his
body to become deified, the powers conflicted. Han Sen failed
again. The powers of the geno arts were thrown into disarray, and
the forming substance chains collapsed. Han Sen experienced a pain
that almost broke his body.</p>
<p>“No. If this continues, I will not succeed.” Han Sen held firm
against the pain that wanted to tear his body to pieces. Many ideas
flew through his head as he considered how he could let the four
geno arts run and become deified.</p>
<p>Based on what he knew of evolution, there was no possibility of
Han Sen becoming deified now. That was because the four geno arts
couldn’t become one, and neither could they evolve individually
while using only a portion of Han Sen. They had to take over Han
Sen’s body completely. That was a contradiction that couldn’t be
solved.</p>
<p>“Wait a second… According to the theory, Spell itself has a
lifeforce… She has a complete body structure and cycle… Maybe that
will really work!” Han Sen’s brain flashed with an idea.</p>
<p>He used the power of the Immortal Dragon again. Gritting his
teeth through that unbearable pain, he shoved the four messed up
geno art powers back on the right track. The pain he experienced
was worse than death. It was like being sliced to the bone a
billion times. Han Sen didn’t know if he could endure it if he had
to do it a second time.</p>
<p>“It must work…” Han Sen felt his teeth chattering. He sent up a
desperate prayer and then summoned Spell.</p>
