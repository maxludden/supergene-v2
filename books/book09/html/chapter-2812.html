<h2>Real Fake Han Sen</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2812</h3>

<p>The ground was destroyed ground. Broken metal and stone
buildings were seen everywhere. The broken, metal pieces of
machinery were sort of like products from a steampunk era. The
buildings seemed even older than them.</p>
<p>Stone tripods with bowls atop them, stone stoves, and stone
towers were cracked and strewn across the land. A 9-foot stone
stove had been split in half. One saw broken stone buildings and
tools all around.</p>
<p>Giant metal machines were visible in every direction. They were
so decayed that one could not tell what they were.</p>
<p>Under the light of the setting sun, the whole place was like a
ruin left behind by an apocalypse. Han Sen and the others had only
just arrived. Upon seeing all this, they frowned.</p>
<p>“I calculate a 90% probability that this place belongs to the
big barren systems,” Meng Lie said as he looked around.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the broken buildings all around. They looked
familiar. The style of the buildings looked like the stone-era
stylings of the architecture in the Valley of Time in the
sanctuaries.</p>
<p>He thought, Does this mean the stone tools came from here? That
must mean the destiny tablet comes from here as well.</p>
<p>Because Ger’s power was still there but not working, they had to
continue depending on Bao Ying in their pursuit of the fugitive Han
Sen.</p>
<p>The way the petals led into the ruins was like a stream. Second
Uncle and the others carefully followed the petals that were
guiding them. None of them dared to risk carelessness.</p>
<p>The big barren systems were the scariest places in the entire
universe. Even a deified as strong as Second Uncle did not
underestimate such a place.</p>
<p>After walking 100 miles, they still only saw ruins. They did not
see any xenogeneics, however, which made the travelers feel
moderately better. Even so, no one dared to lose their
vigilance.</p>
<p>The petals suddenly stopped before a stone tower. They kept
spinning around the stone tower.</p>
<p>Bao Ying looked at the stone tower and said, “This is it.”</p>
<p>Everyone was happy. If they could catch Han Sen inside there,
they would not have to venture too deep into the big barren
systems.</p>
<p>“It looks like that kid Han Sen did not think we would dare to
chase him to this wretched place,” Bao Qin said. “He did not think
he would have to go far, so he decided to hide here.”</p>
<p>“Londo, break this stone tower.” Second Uncle spoke to a deified
man with the head of a cow.</p>
<p>The man with a cow head adhered to the order and summoned his
geno armament. It was a big axe that shone with indestructible
substance chains.</p>
<p>“Roar!” The man with a cow head roared. His big axe was madly
swung toward the stone tower. He cut the tower, which was a few
dozen feet tall, in half.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The split stone tower flopped to both sides. When the giant axe
reached the feet of the stone tower, something blocked its descent.
It created the sound of metallic noise.</p>
<p>Everyone was left staring at where the giant axe had stopped its
swing. They saw a young man, who had apparently been sitting inside
the stone tower. He lifted his right hand. The big axe’s descent
had been stopped by the squeeze of the man’s index finger and
middle finger.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Londo madly roared. A substance chain exploded on his
axe like a volcano. He wanted to slash down and cut the young man’s
arm off.</p>
<p>No matter how much power Londo exploded, the big axe was unable
to be moved.</p>
<p>The young man laughed. He applied more strength with his fingers
to make a “katcha” noise. The giant head of the axe broke between
his fingers.</p>
<p>“Blergh!” Londo’s mouth spewed with blood. It made him stumble
backward. His face was white.</p>
<p>The giant axe was his geno armament. The geno armament broke, so
he was heavily damaged.</p>
<p>The faces of Second Uncle and the others looked grim. Although
Londo was just a primitive deified and not one of the Extreme King,
his power was supposed to be indestructible. Yet, that young man
had just used his fingers to effortlessly break The Story of Genes.
Via that one small move, one saw just how powerful the young man
must have been.</p>
<p>Second Uncle surrounded the young person. Bao Qin coldly shouted
at the young man, “Han Sen, no matter how evil you are, today is
the day that you die!”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the young man. His face morphed into a strange
expression. That was because the young man he was looking at looked
identical to him. He looked at the young man and thought he was
looking in the mirror.</p>
<p>Who is this guy that has this sort of power? He is stronger than
me. He is not any weaker than me when I turned. Why is he disguised
as me? Han Sen thought about it with suspicion.</p>
<p>The young man looked at Second Uncle and smiled. “I thought the
Very High would get here first. I did not expect it to be you guys,
but that is fine. Since you guys are here first, then it is you
guys. From now on, you will have to listen to my commands. If you
make a mistake, you will be punished.”</p>
<p>How that young man spoke was very demanding. It sounded like
Second Uncle and the others were his slaves.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and Meng Lie were Bai King’s family. They had been
in lofty positions their entire lives. They had never been treated
like this before. It made them feel extremely agitated.</p>
<p>Meng Lie coldly grunted. “Han Sen, do not be all cocky here just
because you have the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. Today, I will be
letting you know that the medusa shield is rubbish.”</p>
<p>After that, Meng Lie brought out a pill. He crushed the pill.
Soon after, a scary deified xenogeneic came out. When the wind
arrived, it became a 30-foot, black-scaled, nine-headed, big
snake.</p>
<p>Meng Lie grabbed the tail of the black-scaled, nine-headed, big
snake. His body shone with a gold god light. He dyed the giant
black-scaled, nine-headed, big snake in gold color.</p>
<p>When Meng Lie shouted, the black-scaled, nine-headed, big snake
became a gold, nine-headed trident. Meng Lie grabbed it, took aim
at the young man who was sitting on a platform, and unleashed a
scary power. It made Ger and the others fall back.</p>
<p>This guy Meng Lie is stronger. Did he become larva? Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>The young man looked at Meng Lie with interest. He did not plan
on standing up from the platform. He smiled and looked at the gold,
nine-headed trident. He said, “Gold soldier body. That is
interesting, but I still think you are too weak.”</p>
<p>“It is still enough to kill you,” Meng Lie coldly grunted. The
gold, nine-headed trident unleashed a scary gold light. It was
attacking the young man on the stone platform.</p>
<p>With that strike, the gold, nine-headed trident became nine,
gold, evil snakes that were heading for the young man. They were
like nine, gold, evil dragons that could swallow the world.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to admit that Meng Lie had become stronger. When Han
Sen was primitive, if he used his xenogeneic battle body, he would
have been unable to block that attack.</p>
<p>“Fourth Brother’s gold soldier body is getting stronger,” Second
Uncle said.</p>
<p>In the next second, everyone froze. The young man sat on the
stone and flicked his finger nine times. Each flick hit the head of
one of the gold, evil snakes.</p>
<p>Instantly, nine, gold, evil snake heads exploded. The gold,
nine-headed trident was destroyed. Meng Lie could no longer hold
his broken trident. He threw up blood and went soaring away. He
collapsed among several metal tools.</p>
