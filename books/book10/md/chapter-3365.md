The fire was very unique. Just as it left the Tail Fire Beast’s mouth, it activated all the fire elements in the universe’s universal cogwheels. The power of the fire subdued the rules of all the others. It created an absolute fire rule seal.

This was an absolute Break World power. It was the type of power only Break World creatures that had a Break World rate over 90% could use. It was very close to an ultimate aura.

As a sky full of fire descended, all the rules were replaced by fire rules. The fire scorched the entire world.

Han Sen did not plan on backing down. He used his Jadeskin to break the world. A mysterious ice-jade marking revealed itself. It came together to become an ice-jade ball that put Han Sen, Bao’er, and the two pets inside its protection.

“He has a Break World rate that is only 60%. This fight is going to lack excitement.” The Break World beasts that watched Han Sen saw his Break World mark and acknowledged that he was not spawning an absolute bai sema. They were all coldly laughing at him.

It was just a layer of power. The Tail Fire Beast had a burning red sky power buff to fuel its strength, and it looked as if the fight was going to be over very soon.

Pang!

The fire was like a disaster coming down. It buried Han Sen and his ice-jade shield with endless streams of fire that seemed able to bully the world. The whole burning red sky became a purgatory of fire. Everything was melting.

It was such a scary scene that everyone was shaking. Tail Fire Beast was like a god beast that managed fire. It made people feel scared just seeing it.

If it wanted to, it seemed it could cast disasters on a whim and set the whole world on fire.

In the next second, everyone froze. Amidst that endless purgatory of fire, there was an icy light. A holy shadow emerged from the fire. When the shadows disappeared, one could see that the scorching fire was frozen. It was like an ice statue that looked like tentacles in the air.

“How is that even possible?” Many Break World beasts were shocked. They looked at Han Sen with a gaze of disbelief.

A man with a Break World rate of 60% was squaring off against a foe with a 90% Break World rate. Despite that, the former was using a weaker element and could repel the fire conjured by Tail Fire Beast. It was extremely difficult to believe.

Although the Break World rate was not real power, there was a difference between the combatants’ levels. Furthermore, the elements were weaker. It was hard to believe something lower could defeat something higher.

Tail Fire Beast’s pupils became small. It roared madly. The fire in the burning red sky started to explode. The fire coming to attack Han Sen raged even more.

Han Sen looked cold. He appeared clean and icy. It was not like he was a being from Earth. The ice-jade power fought the fire power. It separated two worlds.

There was only a wall of fire in front of Han Sen. It was a lava fire.

Behind him was a frozen path of ice and jade.

The two powers with different levels collided. No one could prove greater than the other, which made time freeze in place.

On a distant planet far away, there was a god temple wrought of metal. It was near a forest and a river. A woman was sitting atop a rock on the banks of the river. Her white feet dangled in the water. She kicked and splashed it merrily.

A man with white hair was not too far from the river. He was cooking fish on the nice flames of a campfire.

The woman held her jaw and looked up. She saw Tail Fire Beast battling against Han Sen. She lifted her lips and said, “What a fool. It has been so long, and he has only practiced Cold Sutra to this level.”

The white-haired man smiled. “He is a man practicing Cold Sutra. It is merely lucky he has not been consumed. It is not easy for him to practice that.”

The woman was not happy. “No matter what body he has, if he took my Cold Sutra, he must do his best to master it.”

The white-haired man laughed and did not speak. He knew what the personality of this woman was like. It was not that she was not enjoying Han Sen’s performance. She just wanted Han Sen to be able to do better.

“What a fool. It is the Cold Sutra. What did he do with it? He cannot even put out a small fire. He is making a fool out of me.” The woman complained again. Even so, when she squinted her eyes, it looked as if there was a faint smile forming.

The white-haired man asked, “If you hate him that much, why do you not invite him here? Perhaps you can teach him the true Cold Sutra.”

The woman shook her head and sighed. “It does not matter anymore. The water is too polluted. It would be best if we do not touch it anymore.”

The white-haired man did not respond. After cooking the fish, he gave it to the woman.

The woman accepted the fish and had a bite. She resumed watching Han Sen in combat. As she continued to eat, she said, “The Cold Sutra he practices with is weird. It is different from my Cold Sutra. Even if he has taken a shortcut, I wonder what it will be when he practices it at its ultimate level.”

“The same geno arts turn out differently depending on who practices them,” the white-haired man said. “Plus, men and women are different. It is normal for this to be different.”

The woman looked at the white-haired man and asked, “So, if he and I practice to the max, whose Cold Sutra would end up stronger?”

“Of course, yours would be stronger.” The white-haired man did not hesitate to respond and looked sincere as he spoke.

The woman puffed from her mouth and rolled her eyes. “You answer me honestly now. Do not lie.”

The white-haired man laughed and said, “I am speaking the truth. If it was just a matter of cold power, I think yours would be better. Regarding interest, I think his modified Cold Sutra might prove more interesting.”

“What do you mean by interesting?” the woman asked. She looked at the man with confusion. She was not entirely sure what he meant.

“Unknown things are always interesting due to the infinite possibilities one can think up,” the white-haired man said. “No one can see what lies ahead to determine the outcome. Therefore, you are always made hopeful in seeing the unknown.” The white-haired man looked weird as he proceeded to say, “Like this.”

When the white-haired man spoke, the burning red sky’s power exhibited changes. Han Sen’s ice-jade power suddenly lessened. The ice-jade shield became smaller too.

The stalemate of balance between the two was broken. The crazy fire came down to cover Han Sen’s holy body.

The creatures watching were shocked. They thought Tail Fire Beast had taken the advantage and beat Han Sen.

The Break World beasts were so excited that they roared. The geno universe’s creatures looked terrible. If the geno universe’s strongest elites lost, they would not stand a chance.

“Are San Mu and Bao’er OK?” Qin Bai asked with worry.
