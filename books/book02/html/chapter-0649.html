      Unfortunately for Han Sen, it was a common occurrence that what he was
      most afraid of was exactly what he&#8217;d end up suffering. Han Sen began
      climbing the mountain, and his greatest fear was realized; Wang Yuhang was
      also there, killing monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Wang Yuhang saw Han Sen, he was delightfully surprised. He finished
      off the creature he was engaged in combat with and enthusiastically ran
      towards Han Sen. He asked aloud, &#8220;Brother Han, have you come looking
      for me?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah, sure.&#8221; Han Sen didn&#8217;t really know how to respond,
      thinking of how unlucky – and how unlikely – he was to meet Wang Yuhang
      here, of all places.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, have you heard of what&#8217;s afoot in the Alliance?
      It&#8217;s major, from what I hear.&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s voice had
      dropped low, as if he was whispering a secret.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What big thing, Little Uncle?&#8221; Han Sen was never really
      concerned when it came to events in the Alliance, but he asked anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Only a few of the high-class Alliance members know about this,
      right now. It&#8217;s currently on the down-low, but I fear it&#8217;s
      only a matter of time before it gets announced.&#8221; Wang Yuhang paused
      for a bit, inched closer to Han Sen&#8217;s ear, and said, &#8220;Someone
      has managed to slay that creature in the First Shelter.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What creature?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s body shook.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That creature that is above the class of a sacred-blood creature.
      It turns out, they&#8217;re actually called &#8216;super creatures&#8217;
      and it has shaken the high-class members of the Alliance to the very
      bone!&#8221; Wang Yuhang spoke aloud, with envy.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen heard what he had to say, he felt some relief. Since there
      were more and more elites in the First Shelter, it was only a matter of
      time before they could kill super creatures. The existence of super
      creatures becoming well-known by humans would be a relief for Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who killed the super creature and how?&#8221; Han Sen asked Wang
      Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It was a woman called Ji Qing from the Ji family. In a way, you are
      her brother-in-law, but she is not a daughter of Ji Ruozhen. She is only a
      cousin to your family, but she is far more talented than Ji
      Ruozhen&#8217;s daughter. She has already been titled the first genius of
      the Alliance and a star of hope for the future.&#8221; Wang Yuhang trailed
      off for a second with a smile. Then, he shook his head and continued by
      saying, &#8220;But they didn&#8217;t manage to kill a super creature
      merely because Ji Ruozhen was so strong, but members of the Wang, Lin, and
      Xue families helped out, as well. They also hired many elites; three
      hundred, as a matter of fact! They were elites who have not yet evolved
      but have maxed out their genes. They aided in injuring the super creature
      for her, and many people are reported to have died.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is a shame such a feat is even more difficult to achieve in the
      Second Shelter. The Second Shelter excludes surpassers, so once we hit
      that level, we have to immediately leave this place. Otherwise, our bodies
      will be dealt irreversible damage. It&#8217;s a shame none of these events
      take place in the Second Shelter, I know I&#8217;d join in, if such a
      thing were to happen!&#8221; Wang Yuhang sighed and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked confused and asked, &#8220;All those people gave their best
      to kill that super creature and many people gave their lives. Were there
      any goodies? Why does that Ji Qing hog all the glory?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;She was the one who found an injured super creature and she was the
      one who dealt the final blow. The others were just hired help – sellswords
      and the like – who were paid beforehand. They got what they were
      promised.&#8221; After saying this, Wang Yuhang lowered his voice to tell
      Han Sen, &#8220;Plus, Ji Ruozhen basically confirmed he is going to be the
      leader of the Alliance. No one will offend the Ji family over the killing
      of a super creature. And if they can kill one once, they&#8217;re sure to
      be able to do it again. With our association to the Ji family, where we
      help her and she helps us, fighting over such a kill would be
      pointless.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen nodded. He knew it was difficult to kickstart anything in this
      world. After killing the first, it was incredibly likely more and more
      would start to die. It was only a matter of time before someone maxed out
      all their super geno points. As time went on, the snowball effect was
      inevitable.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Did Ji Qing get a super beast soul?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, an armor variant. If she hadn&#8217;t, she wouldn&#8217;t be
      called the star of hope for the future of the Alliance. With that sort of
      armor, the First Shelter will become Ji Qing&#8217;s stomping
      ground.&#8221; Wang Yuhang then looked into Han Sen&#8217;s eyes and
      continued by saying, &#8220;Oh, yeah. Anyway, let&#8217;s get back to
      business. Why have you come searching for me?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m going into the mountains to hunt a berserk sacred-blood
      creature. If you aren&#8217;t busy, you can tag along.&#8221; This was the
      only thing Han Sen could say, really.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brilliant! Slaying berserk sacred-blood creatures is my favorite
      pastime!&#8221; Wang Yuhang was giddy like a child and looked genuinely
      ecstatic to be able to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      They both followed the ridge of the mountain. Han Sen ascended the place
      carefully, in fear of any threats that may have been lurking beneath the
      snow he treaded upon. He did so because he hadn&#8217;t forgotten about
      the super creature turtles he had once spotted, when they emerged from a
      small cave for a feast of red mushrooms. If they were still around, and he
      somehow alerted them, Han Sen didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d be able to
      take on nine super creatures all at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before long, Han Sen safely arrived at the last place he had seen the
      Red-Scale Dragon. Surprisingly, it had been a journey free from any
      trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Red-Scale Dragon had not vacated the area, and he spotted it resting
      in the valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Red-Scale Dragon looked slightly different than the first time he saw
      it. Its red scales were already crystallized. When watching it from afar,
      it looked like a giant statue encrusted with rubies. It was beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is one big chap.&#8221; Wang Yuhang saw the Red-Scale Dragon
      too and took a deep breath.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen laughed. He looked at Wang Yuhang and told him, &#8220;Little
      Uncle, I&#8217;m afraid I am going to have to request your assistance once
      more. If you would be so kind, I would like you to attract the fiend while
      I kill it. As payment, I&#8217;ll let you keep half of its flesh.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Accepted!&#8221; Wang Yuhang nodded, summoned a beast soul, and ran
      screaming towards the red dragon.
    </p>

    <p>
      He didn&#8217;t run too far, however. He stopped a good distance from it,
      scrambled for some rocks beneath the snow, and lobbed them at the
      creature. The Red-Scale Dragon saw its harasser and quickly took off after
      him, seething with rage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang led the Red-Scale Dragon up and down the slopes of the
      mountain. Han Sen summoned his peacock crossbow and loaded up his seven
      remaining bolts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Red-Scale Dragon was most certainly in berserk mode and a result, its
      scales were currently much tougher than the scales of an average
      sacred-blood creature. If he used the raven bolts to pierce the scales,
      Han Sen feared they wouldn&#8217;t do much damage to the creature. It was
      of a monstrous size, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, Han Sen prepared to repeat the tactic that had allowed him to bring
      down the T-rex. He took aim at the red dragon&#8217;s eye. Since the red
      dragon was not a super creature, unlike his previous foe, Han Sen believed
      firing his crossbow at its eye was sure to have peg a bolt directly
      through its brain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finding a sound location on the mountain&#8217;s peak to take his shot,
      Han Sen waited for Wang Yuhang to draw the red dragon a little closer
      before he attacked.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the red dragon was led in a circle around the peak, Wang Yuhang
      reappeared yelling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Run!&#8221; Wang Yuhang was screaming, flailing his arms like a
      madman towards Han Sen as he ran. Something was most certainly wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart began to race as he pondered what might have gone
      awry. He thought to himself, &#8220;What&#8217;s happening? Surely nothing
      terrible has happened once again, has it?&#8221;
