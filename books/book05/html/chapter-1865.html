<p>Han Sen did not plan on escaping this time. He</p>
<p>had already achieved first place here, so there was little to
worry about. Now it was time for him to show off the knife skills
that Yisha had taught him.</p>
<p>Yisha had been teaching him Teeth Knife for a while, and by now,
that was what he was best at.</p>
<p>Now he needed to perform what he had learned well in order to
avoid disappointing her. If he made her happy, it was only
expectable that he would receive more resources from her. So, this
next move would be more important than anything.</p>
<p>He gripped his Ghost Teeth Knife as he ran towards Night Giant
God. He was holding the hilt, but the weapon was still inside its
sheath. He hadn’t drawn it.</p>
<p>“Good timing!” Night Giant God shouted, as he swung his own
knife with greater strength.</p>
<p>His geno art was called Battle River. It was a water geno art.
Water geno arts were usually quite soft, and they had a sense of
infinity about them. They were usually quite effective against
something hard.</p>
<p>But Battle River was different. It was a really rough water geno
art, that was like a river coming down from the sky. It was the
strongest strike, and that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Backed by the knife skills of the Rebate, his attack would be so
fast and so strong. No one at the same level would be able to block
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on escaping. He slashed with Ghost Teeth
Knife, and he used Teeth Knife skills to perform the technique
Tooth-for-a-Tooth.</p>
<p>This was different from Tusk. This move changed depending on the
opponent. If the foe was cruel, then it’d be cruder than them. If
the foe was hard, then it would be harder than them. If the foe was
obscene, it would be obscener than them.</p>
<p>Night Giant God was striking very hard, and so Han Sen did the
same thing.</p>
<p>There was no way around this.</p>
<p>They are going for a direct collision with each other! Night
Giant God was born powerful. He has five hundred flowers despite
being a Baron. Very few people can fight him. Although he does not
have a King class weapon, I don’t think it matters all that much.
Han Sen himself can’t cast the King class power of his weapon,
after all,” someone who knew Night Giant God said.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife and Night Giant God’s knife came against each
other. The thin and curved Ghost Teeth Knife, coming against the
large knife of the opposition, did not look appropriately
scaled.</p>
<p>But the purple blade of Ghost Teeth cleaved right into the big
knife. It shattered the big knife, sending fragments flying
everywhere.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife did not stop. It kept coming forward towards
Night Giant God. When it was less than one inch away from his head,
just about brushing his hair, the knife stopped dead.</p>
<p>Night Giant God’s eyes were opened wide, and sweat broke out
across his brow. He did not dare to move at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled. He put the knife away and walked right past
Night Giant God.</p>
<p>“You only won because you have a King class weapon. I will fight
you.” Another Baron appeared. He moved like a ghost and tried to
attack Han Sen’s neck with a dagger.</p>
<p>But within a second, his dagger was also broken.</p>
<p>A few other Barons came at Han Sen at the same time, prompting
him to move. But wherever Ghost Teeth Knife went, a broken weapon
would follow in its wake. No one’s weapon could withstand the
strike of that knife.</p>
<p>“Powerful, that Teeth Knife skill is,” the beautiful man said in
compliment.</p>
<p>The man with the head of a cow replied, “He is a powerful
man.”</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on swinging his blade fearlessly. If any Baron came
close, he’d break their weapon. He was not killing anyone, though.
He’d simply break their knives and that was it. If he did start
killing, the entirety of Narrow Moon would likely consider him an
enemy.</p>
<p>The Barons could not stop Han Sen’s advance. And before long, it
was a Viscount that tried him next.</p>
<p>The sword of the Viscount came at him like a shadow. The
swordlight became a flash of light that weaved a net of strikes to
attack Han Sen all at once. This was a Rebate skill known as Moon
Shadow Slash.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on moving, not slowing down as he came towards the
sword net. He used a Teeth slash towards the Viscount.</p>
<p>The Viscount was shocked by the boldness, because Han Sen was
now moving toward where Moon Shadow Slash actually began. The net
was just an illusion, and it wasn’t where the actual sword was
going to strike.</p>
<p>It was too late for him to withdraw his sword, too. So, the
Viscount committed to the slash, as the swordlight came down on Han
Sen’s Ghost Teeth Knife.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>A large chunk was carved out of the Viscount’s sword. This
wasn’t because the Ghost Teeth Knife was sharp and hard.</p>
<p>Dog Teeth was based on the concept of a heavy strike. Many
Rebate used this skill, as it was infamous for destroying popular
swords. Many King class weapons were missing chunks due to this
technique.</p>
<p>And seeing that the Viscount was unable to block Han Sen, many
other Viscounts swept forward to stop him. They were afraid he’d
run off again.</p>
<p>But this time, Han Sen was not planning to run. He had achieved
first place already, and now was the time to show off. The better
he performed, the more resources Yisha might be willing to give
him. This was his best chance of securing valuables.</p>
<p>He had Yisha as back-up, anyway. He wasn’t afraid anyone could
actually do something to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his knife to fight many Nobles, all alone. The
Barons had stopped, so it was mostly just the Viscounts that were
fighting him now.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not use his Viscount Jadeskin, though. He maintained
his Baron class for the fight. He didn’t use his Teeth Rabbit
shoes, either. He was only using his Ghost Teeth Knife to fight
back against the Viscounts.</p>
<p>“It looks like Knife Queen recruited him a long time ago. How
long she’s been training him, god only knows. But it would take a
decade for him to reach this sort of level.” Night River King
hummed.</p>
<p>Yisha was shocked, too. She knew exactly how long she had been
teaching him: Han Sen had only been with her for a few months. She
had not taught him for long, at all. The last skill he learned was
eight days ago.</p>
<p>It was shocking that Han Sen could use Teeth Knife with that
level of proficiency.</p>
<p>“Is he a knife master?” Yisha had a complicated look.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s performance kept on surprising her. As a teacher, she
was very lucky to have such a student. She had only taken him on in
a bet to find out where Dollar might be, but she felt like having
him as a student was not a negative thing, at all.</p>
<p>“Should I expect more from him?” Yisha wondered. But whenever
she did, the thought of The Story of Genes would return and give
her a headache.</p>
<p>“He is good at Teeth Knife, yes, but he is not one of the
Rebate. It is difficult for him to use Teeth Power. Even though he
is good at it, it is still a waste.” Moon Wheel King felt
ashamed.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Viscounts could not block Han Sen, and no one
could strike, it seemed likely Han Sen would be able to escape.</p>
<p>The beautiful man then decided to teleport in front of Han Sen.
His bone knife was forged from dragon bones. He slashed towards Han
Sen.</p>
