<p>Without the plants, the red mist had smothered the entire cave.
Fortunately, Han Sen had his Dongxuan Aura to help him see things
clearly.</p>
<p>After they entered the cave, the minks returned to where they
were born. Then, they started digging with their little paws. They
wanted to burrow through the stone. The little minks had just been
born, however, and they were only Baron class. They were still very
weak, so they could only leave small scratches across the rock.</p>
<p>Han Sen commanded them to fly back inside his pocket. Then, he
pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and activated his Jadeskin light.
Then, he got to digging the ground in their stead.</p>
<p>All seven of the minks popped their heads out of his pocket.
Their fluffy heads all lined up to watch Han Sen dig through the
stone.</p>
<p>Han Sen, after a little while of digging, had created a pit that
was two meters deep. Suddenly, there was a dong noise. He wasn’t
sure what the knife had hit, but it sounded like it had struck
metal. And furthermore, whatever it was did not sound broken.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the bottom of the pit and saw something of a
grey and white color. Han Sen dug up the stones around it, and he
realized it was a bone. Only one inch of the bone was showing, but
it was obviously much larger than that. What the bone might have
belonged to, he wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen swung his Ghost Teeth Knife and resumed digging.
When he unearthed not one but multiple bones, he was given a
shock.</p>
<p>It appeared to be a complete skeleton that was more than four
meters long. It was that of a creature with four legs. It looked
like the skeleton of a Red Mist Mink.</p>
<p>It was dead, of course. And there it was, with only the bones
remaining. The Ghost Teeth Knife was incapable of breaking the
bones, and only faint marks were left on them. You could tell that
its level must have been quite high before its passing.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the bones for quite a long, but he found no
source of xenogeneic genes. This was surprising.</p>
<p>“Weird. Did someone kill this xenogeneic and take its xenogeneic
materials?” Han Sen thought that was incorrect, though. If it had
been killed, why would the bones show zero signs of damage?</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what to do, so he allowed the seven little
minks to hop out of his pocket. Han Sen thought their purpose here
was to check out these bones, but when they entered the pit Han Sen
had dug, they went into a specific corner and kept on digging.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not a patient fellow, and he had no interest in
waiting for them to complete the task of digging. So, with Ghost
Teeth Knife, he took over the spot they were digging. He dug out
two feet of stone before he came across something else.</p>
<p>A red mist started to ascend from it.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could see what it was, the seven little minks
jumped inside. They all ran into the red mist and disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked closer, and there, he noticed an orb that was
around the size of a grapefruit. It looked very clear, as if it had
been made of crystal.</p>
<p>But the red mist there made Han Sen believe it wasn’t real. And
now the minks had vanished.</p>
<p>Han Sen dug out the orb and took a look. He was given another
shock.</p>
<p>Inside the orb, amidst the mist, there was a red palace. It
looked like a suitable habitation for a god.</p>
<p>For some reason, the seven minks had gone inside the crystal
orb. They appeared before the red palace, and then resumed trying
to scratch their way in. They were trying to dig into the palace.
There were no gaps in the walls, though. They were too weak, and
they could not push open the doors to the place.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the nameplate of the palace. There were three
words on it, but Han Sen could not read them. They weren’t of a
language belonging to the humans or the crystallizers, and neither
were they from a language that existed in the geno universe.</p>
<p>“How did they get inside there?” Han Sen was playing with the
crystal orb, trying to activate it. Nothing he did seemed to
work.</p>
<p>If this was a treasure of some kind, it might require a very
special element to activate it.</p>
<p>“If those seven little minks could enter the orb, that must mean
that their power is the same as the orb’s power. I can cast powers
with my Dongxuan Aura. Perhaps I can simulate the lifeforce of the
little mink and get it to work,” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen was wondering how to get the seven minks out first,
though. It was then that he realized the mist inside the cave was
starting to fade. The spring was on the precipice of erupting.</p>
<p>Han Sen quit his stalling, put the crystal orb in his pocket,
and ran out of the cave.</p>
<p>The valley’s mist was starting to fade. Something was sucking it
all away.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed the subsiding flow of the red mist until he
reached a place where the red mist was going into the ground. There
was a big hole there now, and the red mist was drifting down into
it.</p>
<p>The mist around him was getting thinner and thinner, and it was
then that Han Sen heard the sound of fighting. It must have been
the Viscounts, rushing into the valley.</p>
<p>Nothing was coming out of the spring, though, so Han Sen stood
there as if he was guarding it. He waited for a flow to begin.</p>
<p>Not long after, Sword Know made it deep into the valley. The red
mist in the valley was almost all gone, and that was when he saw
Han Sen. He coldly laughed, “Han Sen, it is useless, even if you
did come early. You still have to wait for the spring!”</p>
<p>Many Viscounts were approaching behind Sword Know. Many
xenogeneics were on their way, as well. They were all fighting
hard.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t be bothered to talk to him, so he just sat down
to wait.</p>
<p>Sword Know was next to the eye of the spring. He found a decent
spot, and he got to killing the xenogeneics around him. Whenever
the xenogeneics came within ten meters, he’d kill them quick.</p>
<p>“Earl!” Han Sen frowned. Sword Know had not used spirit power,
but his swordlight power was better than that of a Viscount.</p>
<p>Han Sen reviewed the documents and read that only Viscounts
could come.</p>
<p>“Why are you here if you are an Earl!” Han Sen shouted over to
Sword Know.</p>
<p>Sword Know hummed and said, “I was a Viscount when I came. Am I
not allowed to level up?”</p>
<p>After that, Sword Know looked at the other Viscounts sent by the
other Kings. Then, he coldly laughed. “I’m not the only one who
became an Earl here.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He saw a few Viscounts that were stronger
than what Viscounts should have been capable of. He also saw Moon
Wheel King’s daughter Rebecca.</p>
<p>“You guys have really worked hard for this,” Han Sen coldly
said.</p>
<p>“Stay away from me, in case I hurt you by mistake. You know I
have only just leveled up to Earl, so I can’t really control my
newfound powers all that well,” Sword Know said threateningly.</p>
