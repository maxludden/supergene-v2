    <p>
      After what Hua Ping told him, Fang Mingquan started to worry. He
      didn&#8217;t want Dollar to go up against something so fiercely powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they spoke, the two combatants entered their battleground. One
      combatant was three meters tall and clad in black armor. He looked
      terrifying. His movements were almost like a mechanical robot, built from
      steel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other fighter looked fairly strong compared to what might be expected
      of a human. However, he was clad in a purple armor that looked relatively
      thin next to his opponent&#8217;s.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Black-Gold spirit shouted and raised the hammer he wielded, which was
      bigger than a small car. He smashed the ground in front of Han Sen with a
      force that probably could have toppled a small mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan watched Dollar with great trepidation. Although Dollar was
      wearing purple armor, he could tell it was Dollar from the way the man
      held himself. As he observed Dollar facing-off with Black-Gold, it
      frightened him. Fang Mingquan was an evolver himself, so he could clearly
      sense the threatening power that resided within the hammer Black-Gold
      wielded.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Your friend seems a little slow. His abilities are
      strength-focused? If that is true, he won&#8217;t fare too well against a
      foe such as Black-Gold. His enemy&#8217;s power is infinite, so unless he
      is one of the strongest humans in history&#8230;&#8221; Hua Ping trailed
      off, but such a sentence had only one conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan didn&#8217;t see Dollar dodge, and neither did Dollar draw a
      weapon. He watched nervously, as Dollar had only been in the shelter for a
      couple of years and his power had most likely not peaked yet. Going up
      against such a frightening foe was wildly dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Black-Gold&#8217;s hammer swung again, poised to land on Dollar&#8217;s
      head, he brought out his right fist and punched the hammer.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Hua Ping witnessed this move, he shook his head and said, &#8220;Your
      friend is a reckless one. Black-Gold&#8217;s power is&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Hua Ping could finish his sentence, Dollar&#8217;s fist collided
      with the hammer.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The hit was deafening, and the fist shattered the hammer into pieces.</p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping and Fang Mingquan were motionless. They couldn&#8217;t even
      fathom the strength that resided in that fist, for it to break a giant
      metal hammer such as that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping was shocked the most. He had witnessed many Divinity&#8217;s
      Bouts over the years and was knowledgeable about many of the fighters
      there; that included Black-Gold, the spirit. He was a remarkable warrior.
      He may not have been the strongest, but he possessed a lot of strength
      nonetheless. Against his unbreakable armor and intimidatingly large
      hammer, many evolvers had died, or at the very least, been grievously
      injured in battle with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of sacred-blood weapons had been broken by that hammer, as well. But
      now, that very same hammer had been utterly annihilated by a human fist.
      The sight was unimaginable, and it was the sort of tale that few would
      ever believe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping could only stare at Dollar, mouth agape. He was forgetting to
      write his report.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the battleground, after Han Sen wrecked the hammer, a flood of power
      boiled inside his body once more. Seeing Black-Gold himself aghast at what
      had just happened, Han Sen stepped forward with atmosphere-cracking
      strength, directly before the spirit&#8217;s face.
    </p>

    <p>
      His flesh was like that of a tiger, and his fist buzzed loudly as it
      flashed towards Black-Gold&#8217;s face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Black-Gold shouted and crossed his arms in an attempt to block the
      incoming attack.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      His armor, arms, and skull were crushed under the weight of Han
      Sen&#8217;s Elephant-Disc Punch. Blood soaked the arena, and the
      disfigured and dismembered body of Black-Gold was launched out of the
      battleground. The bloody mess crash landed fifteen meters away.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How is that possible?&#8221; Hua Ping was on his feet, his book and
      pens fallen to the floor. As he looked upon Dollar, his eyes widened until
      it looked like they were going to fall out.
    </p>

    <p>It was a one-punch victory.</p>

    <p>
      The immeasurably powerful spirit Black-Gold was killed shortly after the
      fight began, and he hadn&#8217;t stood a chance. No one could imagine the
      strength that was delivered in that punch, and Hua Ping struggled to
      believe it was possible for an evolver to achieve such a wretched power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan was almost as shocked, as well; he almost cried aloud. He
      did not expect Dollar, who had only been in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary for as long as he had, to have managed to achieve such power. He
      killed a royal spirit with a single punch, and it was a ravenous
      crowd-pleaser.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mingquan, is this man human?&#8221; Hua Ping asked after Dollar
      left the arena, excitedly grabbing Fang Mingquan&#8217;s hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, he is. Dollar is pretty popular in the Alliance,&#8221; Fang
      Mingquan quickly told him, in his own excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If he is really human&#8230; Wait&#8230; Let me see&#8230;&#8221;
      Hua Ping was no longer coherent in his dialogue, as he ran his hands up
      and down his body in search of his book. Realizing it was on the floor, he
      raced to pick it up.
    </p>

    <p>
      He began flipping through the pages, scanning the battle lists and
      frantically drawing with his pen. Fang Mingquan wasn&#8217;t sure what he
      was doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      He drew with a manic speed. Every time he wrote down a name and drew a
      line, his face perked with further excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan looked at what Hua Ping was doing and noticed it was a
      calculation of the battle list. It seemed as if Hua Ping was trying to
      determine who Dollar would face off against next.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ten matches&#8230; He won&#8217;t go up against anyone stronger
      than Black-Gold for another ten matches. This is a chance.&#8221; Hua
      Ping&#8217;s face had gone red as a beetroot, and he beamed with delight
      in his mad drawings.
    </p>

    <p>
      The excitement in his face was getting deeper and deeper. But after a
      while, his face froze. His excitement drained away, and he sat down in
      evident disappointment. His eyes looked empty as he mumbled, &#8220;It
      still doesn&#8217;t work. It still doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Hua, what doesn&#8217;t work?&#8221; Fang Mingquan quickly
      asked, eager understand what was going on.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Your friend is pretty lucky. If he continues fighting, he
      shouldn&#8217;t encounter any more opponents who are that powerful. Even
      if he met another spirit that was as powerful as Black-Gold, he would
      still have every chance of beating it. If he is lucky enough, he can reach
      the top ten. But&#8230;&#8221; Hua Ping gave a long, drawn-out sigh. Then,
      he continued by saying, &#8220;In his final fight, the one before he can
      be crowned Son of God, he must face-off against an opponent no human can
      possibly defeat.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What manner of opponent do you speak of?&#8221; Fang Mingquan
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In the fifth Divinity&#8217;s Bout, there was a light-element Son
      of God. Although this Son of God had only joined once, he was extremely
      powerful. His power now is something few humans might ever fathom. No
      human can beat him. Even evolvers with unlocked gene locks don&#8217;t
      stand a chance. Before the Light Son of God, they would be crushed like
      bugs.&#8221; Hua Ping bore a wry smile as he explained the predicament.
