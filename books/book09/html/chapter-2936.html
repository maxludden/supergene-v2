<p>The scariest thing was that Han Sen slowly noticed that his own
eyes were shutting too. It was as if he was becoming extremely
tired. He was not able to open his eyes anymore. No matter how much
he struggled and tried to open his eyes, nothing seemed to work.
His eyelids refused to open. They just wanted to close.</p>
<p>“Stop resisting! It is useless. The sword lights of the
nine-eyed sword can rob the vision of every being in this universe.
When facing the nine-eyed sword, no creature has an eye.” Nine
Thousand King raised his nine-eyed sword. He looked evil as he
said, “It is not just that either. When you see the eyes on the
nine-eyed sword, you are almost dead!”</p>
<p>As Han Sen listened to Nine Thousand King’s voice, he was still
unable to open his eyes. They were closing completely. He felt as
if something was moving in his eyes. It felt as if it was going to
blow up his eyeballs and emerge.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Yang Yun Sheng screamed. He held his eyes and screamed
like crazy. Somehow, his eyes exploded. They had become two, gaping
and bloody holes.</p>
<p>“I gave you the chance to leave, but you did not want to!” Nine
Thousand King coldly looked at Yang Yun Sheng. He then turned his
gaze toward Han Sen. He was hoping to see the moment Han Sen’s eyes
exploded.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt like all of the blood in his body going toward his
eyes, preparing to pop them out. He knew the nine-eyed sword was
weird, but he had no idea he was actually being dealt damage by
it.</p>
<p>The big goldfish and small goldfish kept their eyes closed.
Their eyes were swollen like balloons with a maximum amount of air
put into them. They were going to blow up any second.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen could not see, in the Dongxuan Sutra, he still
felt everything. The only person who had not been affected was
Bao’er, who happened to be wearing her sunglasses.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King coldly looked at Han Sen. He was waiting for
Han Sen’s eyes to explode.</p>
<p>The nine-eyed sword power not only exploded eyes. When the eyes
exploded, all blood and the lifeforce would seep out of that wound
until the person was a dried husk. The person would be dead.</p>
<p>Feeling that his eyes about to blow up, Han Sen suddenly pulled
the string of the Dog Crow Bow. He fired an arrow at the nine-eyed
sword.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King immediately saw his action. He swung his
nine-eyed sword at the teeth arrow that was coming toward him.</p>
<p>The Dog Crow Bow was very famous, but that was only when it was
in Crow Sky Dog’s hands. In ordinary people’s hands, Nine Thousand
King did not really care.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King knew Crow Sky Dog very well. He knew the Dog
Crow Bow’s power very well too.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>It traveled through space. The teeth arrow behaved as it
teleported. The nine-eyed sword slashed it away. It did not harm
Nine Thousand King in the least.</p>
<p>In the next second, Han Sen’s body weirdly appeared behind Nine
Thousand King. He swung his knife toward Nine Thousand King.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King’s expression changed. Han Sen teleported
quickly, faster than he could have possibly imagined. It was too
late for him to evade, so he waved the nine-eyed sword to block Han
Sen’s knife.</p>
<p>“How is that possible?” When the knife and sword collided, his
nine-eyed sword was broken by Han Sen. The nine-eyed sword was
dead, and the lights were extinguished.</p>
<p>When the nine-eyed sword was broken, Han Sen’s knife light was
still going toward Nine Thousand King’s back.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>A metallic sound rang out. Han Sen had cut open the gold robe.
Inside the gold robe, there was a dark green armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s slash was able to break the nine-eyed sword, but it
did not leave a mark on the dark green armor.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King waved his right arm. It struck Han Sen’s
cause karma knife. It made Han Sen and his knife fly back.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body hit the pillar of the pavilion. The stone pillar
looked ordinary. Once he hit it, Han Sen was unable to break it. He
bounced back onto the floor. Blood was pouring out of his mouth.
The blood inside his chest was thrashing around like a stormy
sea.</p>
<p>“God personality armament?” Han Sen stood back up. He stared at
the dark green armor inside the gold robe.</p>
<p>“You have good eyesight.” Nine Thousand King ripped off his gold
robe. He revealed the splendor of his dark green armor. Aside from
his head and neck, every inch of him was covered in the dark green
armor.</p>
<p>The dark green armor was tightly wound around the body. It
looked very powerful. There was a small gap on the plate of the
armor. Han Sen looked closer. He saw a closed eye. It made people
feel a chill.</p>
<p>“This is the god personality armament Thousand Eye Battle Armor.
This nine-eyed sword was just one of the toys I built to try and
copy the Thousand Eye Battle Armor. The power it has is not half as
strong as the Thousand Eye Battle Armor.” Nine Thousand King looked
very menacing as he said, “Since you have seen my Thousand Eye
Battle Armor, I will not let you live anymore. It is too late now,
even if you want to live and leave.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not budge an inch. He held the cause karma knife and
coldly said, “You can put your god personality armament Thousand
Eye Battle Armor to the test. See if it can kill me.”</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King frowned. He looked at the god list fights
before. He knew the power of the cause karma knife. He had learned
the power of the cause karma knife.</p>
<p>The nine-eyed sword’s damage to Han Sen had been completely
absorbed. The cause karma knife was much stronger than Nine
Thousand King had imagined.</p>
<p>“If I cannot kill him with one hit, it will be annoying to have
him use the cause karma knife power,” Nine Thousand King
thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly said, “Nine Thousand King, what you want is the
item in the pavilion. We don’t have to keep fighting. If you can
answer me a few questions, I can give you the treasure inside this
pavilion.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Nine Thousand King looked at Han Sen with
curiosity. He had not expected Han Sen to say something like
that.</p>
<p>“I am serious,” Han Sen said. “If you cannot answer me, then it
does not count.”</p>
<p>“If you deliberately give me questions that I don’t know the
answer to, how am I supposed to answer you?” Nine Thousand King
coldly laughed.</p>
<p>“If you are here for the treasure in the pavilion, you must know
what it is,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“If I answer the question, will you give me the item?” Nine
Thousand King did not answer the question. He coldly smiled at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“That is one of the questions. I will only ask you a few
questions.” Han Sen did not hesitate. He spoke
straightforwardly.</p>
<p>“What questions? Let me hear them first.” Nine Thousand King’s
eyes shone. He was not in a rush.</p>
<p>“That was the first question. I have four other questions to
ask. Who is the lady depicted in the statue? What is her
relationship with Sacred Leader? How many elites are there in
Sacred, and where are they?” Han Sen asked all he wanted to
know.</p>
