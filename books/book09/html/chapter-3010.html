<p>When Han Sen heard that, his expression kept changing. It was
not like he did not want to give Dragon Lady a drop of his blood.
Let alone a drop of blood, Han Sen would have given her a bucket of
blood if she needed it. For him, it was nothing that would harm
him.</p>
<p>But that was blood Han Sen could not really give since he could
not control the blue blood power. If Dragon Lady had some blue
blood and was unable to refine it, she would end up being infected
by the blue blood. That would have been bad.</p>
<p>“Do you really think Sacred Leader’s blood was really that easy
to absorb?” Han Sen seriously asked. “To be honest with you, I am
infected with the blue blood. I am being controlled by the blue
blood power. I cannot take control of my body, and I still cannot
find a way to get rid of my blue blood. Are you sure you want
Dragon Lady to risk this? If you ask me, it’s a bit reckless.”</p>
<p>When Ancient Origin God heard that, he nodded and said, “What
you are saying kind of makes sense. Although I, Ancient Origin God,
eat all kinds of races, Sacred’s genes are different. We must be
aware of that.”</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God was silent a moment before saying, “How about
this? If Godfather Han is willing to help, give me one drop of your
blood. I will have an Ancient God try it. If it turns out to be OK,
then Dragon Lady can give it a shot.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not think that would be a problem. He cut his finger
and placed a drop of blue blood into a jade bottle.</p>
<p>The blue blood was so still. The color was like blue ink. It did
not appear to be anything special.</p>
<p>“Godfather Han is so nice to us Ancient God. I will always
remember this.” Ancient Origin God accepted the jade bottle and
called an Ancient God over.</p>
<p>The body of the Ancient God was made of something like steel. It
was like a steel monster. Han Sen looked at him and knew that he
was an Ancient God with metal power.</p>
<p>“Ancient Iron God, drink this blood.” Ancient Origin God gave
Ancient Iron God the jade bottle.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.” Ancient Iron God did not hesitate or ask why. He
accepted the jade bottle and drank the blue blood inside it. He
swallowed it completely.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Ancient Origin God stared at Ancient Iron God. He
did not seem to have any reaction to the liquid. Ancient Origin God
asked, “Ancient Iron God, can you refine that blue blood?”.</p>
<p>Ancient Iron God’s face looked weird as he said, “That blood is
in my stomach. It is like a rock that cannot be refined.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Ancient Origin God looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. When Human King dropped blue blood all over
him, the blue blood immediately invaded his body. There was no need
for refinement or anything.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it some more, Han Sen started to have
a guess. “Humans are mixed with crystallizer and Sacred Leader’s
blood. Human King is the human alpha. It would be easy for me to
combine with his blue blood. If other races seek to use the blue
blood, I am afraid that might not be so easy.”</p>
<p>Ancient Iron God was unable to refine the blue blood. He could
not melt it.</p>
<p>“If I cannot refine it, I will try to put it in the baby god
wok.” Ancient Origin God made Ancient Iron God spit out the blue
blood. The blue blood still looked like crystal. It had not been
affected by anything.</p>
<p>He put the blue blood back in the jade bottle. Ancient Origin
God led Han Sen to a baby god wok.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the same baby god wok that cooked Empty Dragon King.
There was only half a bowl of water in it. The flame beneath it was
raging. It kept boiling the water in the pot.</p>
<p>No matter how much the water bubbled and boiled, there was no
steam. The water levels did not decrease.</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God put the drop of blue blood into the water.
That drop of blue blood combined with it. It was still in the shape
of a liquid blood drop.</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God called the eight-armed black bear and
one-eyed xenogeneic over. The two xenogeneics spit out flames. One
spat green fire, which helped the fire on the ground, but it burned
for half a day. It got to the point where the baby god wok was all
red. The water inside bubbled like a dragon rolling. The blue blood
still did not exhibit any changes.</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God’s face changed. “Sacred Leader’s blood is
very powerful. Even the baby god wok cannot cook this gene
essence.”</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. “The blue blood is not refined, but maybe that
is not a bad thing. With how weird the blue blood is, if it was
refined, perhaps that would just lead to a nightmare. Just like
what happened to me.”</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God went silent for a while. He then said, “Blue
blood really is weird. If things are like that, we will research it
first. The geno holy fluid will not add this blood.”</p>
<p>“Then, the ancient spirit seed…” Han Sen hesitated to say
it.</p>
<p>“Do not worry,” Ancient Origin God said. “I promised you I would
not take its life. I will find another way to cook and extract
Empty Dragon King’s gene essence. Godfather Han, you came just in
time. You should come and take part in Dragon Lady’s adult ceremony
before you depart.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and agreed. This was a big thing for Dragon Lady.
Han Sen wanted to go to the cold planet, but he might as well
remain there for another two days.</p>
<p>Back in Dragon Lady’s garden, Han Sen and Dragon Lady talked
about how they had been in recent times. Dragon Lady learned that
Han Sen had been trapped by the blue blood and he needed to find
Han Yufei somewhere on the cold planet. She said, “Ancient Origin
God said I can leave freely after the adult ceremony. I can
accompany you to the cold planet in case you encounter danger out
there. Right now, the whole universe knows you have Sacred’s blue
blood. Many old antiques might want to harass you. If they find
where you are, you might end up in danger.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not refuse her offer. He smiled and replied,
“Thanks. In that case, I will enlist you as my bodyguard.” “I am
not really a hero,” Dragon Lady gently said. “I am just a chef. If
someone wants to give me some cooking materials, I would not
decline the offer.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed in the garden and waited for the adult ceremony
to start. The ancient spirit seed was awfully clingy. It always
climbed on Han Sen and never left him.</p>
<p>Although it looked like just a baby, it was a newborn Ancient
God. If it was awakened, it would become an Ancient God and get god
power.</p>
<p>It had not woken up yet, so it was hard to tell what sort of
Ancient God element it would end up having</p>
<p>Han Sen waited two days. It was time for the adult ceremony to
start. Ancient Origin God invited Han Sen to watch.</p>
<p>In a giant Ancient God plaza, many Ancient Gods broke space and
appeared. Some Ancient Gods looked like they were made of fire.
Some Ancient Gods looked like metal Ancient Gods. Some of them were
made of rocks.</p>
<p>Every Ancient God had their own element. All of them were
incredibly scary. Although Ancient God had less than 300 people,
many of them were already true god. Now, they were all together.
Han Sen could not use his Dongxuan Aura to scan, but he was able to
tell how scary they all were.</p>
<p>“No wonder Ancient God is one of the three high races. It is
hard to imagine what it would be like and how shocked the sky would
be if there were 3,000 of these people running about,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>When Ancient Origin God arrived, the adult ceremony started.
Ancient Origin God was holding an old copper tool that looked like
a Jun. The item looked lively. It generated steam that came out of
its exit.</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God looked serious. He held the bronze tool with
both hands. He read aloud in a language that Han Sen could not
understand. It was like he was praying. It felt mysterious and
serious. When Ancient Origin God was praying, his body glowed with
rainbow god light. The rainbow god light was strong. Ancient Origin
God put his rainbow-like blood into the bronze tool.</p>
<p>After that was done, Ancient Origin God gave the bronze tool to
another Ancient God. That Ancient God behaved just like Ancient
Origin God. After praying, he placed a drop of rainbow blood into
the bronze tool.</p>
<p>They passed it to each other. The 200 Ancient Gods placed their
blood into the bronze tool. They then gave it to Dragon Lady.</p>
