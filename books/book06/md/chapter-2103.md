“The Pool of Rebirth doesn’t just reset your body. The powers of rebirth have a unique way of speeding up your leveling. The leader must think your geno art is ascending too slowly, since you are still only a Marquise. Hence, he has presented you with this opportunity to make use of Holy Heaven’s Pool of Rebirth. Our contract with the Feathers allows us to send three people of our choosing to use the Pool of Rebirth every ten years. You are one of those selected. The leader takes you as someone quite important,” Thousand Feather Crane said, his voice filled with admiration.

“In that case, I will go to Holy Heaven.” Upon hearing that the trip would benefit him, Han Sen did not hesitate. He agreed to become an envoy and travel to Holy Heaven.

Given the precarious situation that the Feathers had found themselves in, they could not risk offending Sky Palace and bringing harm to Han Sen, either. The worse they could do was mocking him.

Since he was gaining access to a valuable resource, though, Han Sen was willing to turn a blind eye to their bad behavior.

“When you return from the Feather, it will be time for the Geno Being Scroll to appear. Will you be entering that competition? You could be the first Earl, easy.” After the question, Thousand Feather Crane smiled.

Han Sen had two geno arts that were Marquise already, and winning the competition would put him atop the list of all Marquises in the universe. It would also highlight the fact he had more than one geno art.

“I am not interested in boosting my reputation.” Han Sen shook his head.

Han Sen wasn’t the only person going to Holy Heaven as an envoy. A few others, including an elder, were going with him. The others would hold meetings with the Feathers to discuss prolonged co-operation between the two races. Han Sen had no objective beyond making use of the pool.

Han Sen followed the group to Holy Heaven. The leader was the tenth elder, Yun Changkong. Han Sen felt safe in his company; he had a good relationship with the man’s daughters and students. If something was to happen, he was certain Yun Changkong would protect him.

The people of Sky Palace treated Han Sen nicely, in part due to his great reputation there. He had done many great deeds in service of Sky Palace, so they all liked him. Many gushed compliments.

They arrived in Feather territory safely. Before they went to Holy Heaven, though, a King of the Feathers welcomed them.

At this point, the Feathers depended on their relationship with Sky Palace for survival. Sky Palace’s protection was the only thing keeping the other high races from attacking them, so they took their commitment to Sky Palace seriously.

When the Feather King looked at Han Sen, however, his expression was filled with distaste. Han Sen couldn’t tell if it was due to the events with Kong Fei or the Blood Feather Knife. When Han Sen entered Holy Heaven, all the Feathers treated him strangely, as well. They were friendly with the other envoys, but they looked at Han Sen with distaste.

Han Sen pretended it was nothing.

When the Feathers learned Han Sen was going to make use of the Pool of Rebirth, though, they went from being annoyed to being terribly upset.

After Ring Feather King showed them the pool, he said, “The Pool of Rebirth it shut down for maintenance, so you’ll have to wait a few days to use it. It will be available to you as soon as it opens again.”

Han Sen resigned himself to staying in Holy Heaven for a while. Luckily, he was an envoy, so nothing awry transpired.

In a meeting room in Holy Heaven, many Feather alphas and high level Feathers were talking.

“The Pool of Rebirth is the holiest relic of the Feathers. How can we allow it to be defiled by Han Sen?” a Feather elder growled.

“Yeah! That animal is connected to Kong Fei. He cannot be allowed to use it!” another Feather elder agreed angrily.

None of the Feather leadership were happy about the prospect of Han Sen making use of their Pool of Rebirth.

“It’s not like we have a choice, though. This is the deal we made with Sky Palace. Using the pool is perfectly within Han Sen’s rights. And there is nothing we can do to stop that,” Holy Feather King said.

Everyone was silent. When the Feather lantern darkened, all the Feathers dropped a level. Holy Feather King had made use of resources to re-secure his rank as a King. It had cost everything Holy Heaven had in its reserves.

But they only recovered thirty to forty percent of their original power. Without the protection of Sky Palace, Holy Heaven would have ceased to be.

“If we cannot stop Han Sen from going in, we might as well just totally open it for him,” an elder said.

“Fairy Feather elder, what do you mean?” Everyone looked at the elder in confusion.

“Three people are allowed access to the rebirth pool at one time. We have given Sky Palace three slots every ten years. They are only making use of one slot, and that slot is given to Han Sen. That means we can send two Feathers alongside him,” Fairy Feather elder said.

Everyone looked at him with confusion, but he went on to say, “The Pool of Rebirth’s power is limited. That is why only three can go at a time. And those three have to be Marquise or lower. If a King entered, the power of the pool would only be enough for that one King. And he wouldn’t be able to be reborn. If Dukes wanted to enter, only two Dukes could be reborn at a time.”

“You mean, we should send two Dukes into the pool with Han Sen? So that they could steal whatever power he’d otherwise gain?” Holy Feather King asked, while looking straight at Fairy Feather elder.

Fairy Feather elder said, “We have all used the Pool of Rebirth, so we can cope with its powers more than outsiders can. With two Dukes that are stronger than Han Sen, they can surely absorb most of its power. Han Sen will earn a little, but Sky Palace won’t notice the trick.”

“This might work, but who is going to take this power?” The elders began to discuss.

If a Duke class person absorbed too much power, they would end up like Angia and become primal. They wouldn’t even be a Baron, and they’d have to start from scratch again.

Not many people wished to end up like Angia, so very few Dukes would want to take part in that.

Fairy Feather elder smiled. “Why don’t we let the two brothers Angela and Andola use it?”

“Aren’t they locked-up in prison? Will they agree?” an elder asked in shock.

“I can persuade them,” Fairy Feather said with a look of confidence.

“If they can go, that really would be best. Not even ten Han Sen’s could fight the two of them,” the elder stated, almost as if he admired them.

On Han Sen’s fourth day there, they received news from the Feathers proclaiming that the Pool of Rebirth was open again. It was being prepared for use.
