  Everyone was frozen. They didn’t know what was going on. Han Sen felt a sharp pain in his heart. He had no clue why the word water had just stopped above him.

The next second, the symbol on Han Sen’s forehead fired away from him like a cannonball. It whooshed back up into the sky, flying into the leaves at the top of the tree and vanishing.

“What is this?” Han Sen was frozen.

Every royal child and guard in King’s Garden stood as still as stone. They thought they must have been imagining things, and their eyes were opened wide in disbelief.

The king tree had stood in the center of the Extreme King territory for billions of years. There had never been a Kingese that saw its recipient, then high-tailed it back to where it came from.

“Haha! I cannot go on! I’m laughing too hard! Old Sixteen is way too funny. The Kingese that fell escaped his clutch.” Prince Nineteen held his belly while he laughed, tears of mirth welling in his eyes.

The water Kingese looked like a horny man, seeing a sexy woman with a great body. It quickly gave chase, but when it got close enough to see her face, it ran away faster than any rabbit.

“This… what’s going on?” Bai Ling Shuang was shocked. She hadn’t a clue what was happening.

Miss Mirror squinted her eyes. “It looks like he isn’t actually Bai Yi. The water Kingese was attracted by the Original Water King Body, but it noticed that there was a problem. And so, it decided to run back. I’m pretty sure he is actually Han Sen.”

“What is this? A fallen Kingese can go back?”

“I don’t know. I’ve never heard of something like this happen before.”

“Prince Sixteen looks a bit embarrassed. He is like a cooked duck that can still fly.”

“Haha! Not only that, but he must be the first of the Extreme King to have a Kingese run away from them.”

The princes and the princesses and the guards all exploded. This was the first time they had ever heard of such a thing. They were so hyped, it was as if they had been injected with chicken blood.

Han Sen thought this was bad. “Did the king tree notice that the Original Water King Body isn’t really mine? Is that why the Kingese ran back? If that is the case, many people might become suspicious of my identity. I have suffered some really bad luck here. If I knew this might happen, I would have just settled for collecting some king air and left.”

Han Sen was depressed. As everyone chattered and laughed about what had happened, the top of the king tree lit up.

The king leaves were suddenly all so bright, and a Kingese fell down like a sun. It came from the top of the tree, flying down to Han Sen’s forehead.

“Come! Come! Let us not have something bad this time. Come on!” Han Sen begged awkwardly. If this went wrong, everyone would know that there was something wrong with him.

The Kingese symbol fell down. Han Sen could see it, too. That word was so solid, unbreakable. It was like a stone that had been made a billion years ago. It said, “Ji.”

“That’s gay, why would I have a word like this? No, no, I’m not gay at all… It must mean gene or base… It must be… It must be…” Han Sen thought to himself.

Han Sen honestly didn’t care what the word was, as long as he had a word.

Everyone who watched this was now looking at Han Sen, trying to see what was happening. Some were actually hoping that the Kingese would escape again.

Quickly, the word landed on Han Sen’s head. Everyone held their breath. They stretched their necks to look at Han Sen’s head and the Ji word. They wanted to see if it would actually meld into him.

“Come on! Come down! Don’t make this any worse!” Han Sen was in a rush. He would have liked to just grab the word, cram it into his mouth, and swallow it.

It was a shame that grabbing Kingese symbols was impossible, though. If they could have, the royal children wouldn’t have had to wait. They would have just grabbed the Kingese by themselves.

Han Sen kept praying in his heart. The word Ji stopped one centimeter in front of Han Sen’s head. It didn’t actually touch down on his body.

“Shit! It is playing around with me again.” Han Sen wanted to cry.

“It stopped… It stopped…” Someone sounded so excited by the sight. They sounded like a kid that had never traveled abroad before and was finally going, with the way they screamed. It was like they were visiting a foreign place.

Prince Sixteen was getting really famous now. He was the first one to ever be abandoned by a Kingese.

“Hahaha! This is so funny.”

“But why do the Kingese refuse to touch down and meld into Brother Sixteen’s body?”

The whole of King’s Garden exploded. They had never thought something like this might happen, but now they were. Their nosy souls were burning.

Bai Qing Xia, who was closest to Han Sen, was also confused. He didn’t know what was going on with Han Sen.

“Huh? That is weird. The Ji word has stopped, but it hasn’t left.” Someone noticed this little issue, too.

The Ji word had stopped, but it didn’t escape like the water one did. It hung above Han Sen’s head as if it was in suspended animation.

“Brother, what the hell is this? If you are going to come down, then come down! Leave, if that is what you prefer. Why are you just hanging around here? There is no half-in, half-out. Are you just trying to scare me? Whatever it is you want to do, just get it over with.” Han Sen rolled his eyes and stared at the Ji Kingese. He was nervous.

Han Sen thought his luck had turned sour. He thought everything had gone awry. He had drawn too much attention in the Pavilion already. Now that this had happened, it was difficult for him not to appear suspicious.

“I need to be an honest person. I will never disguise myself as someone else again. I cannot deal with this kind of stress.” Han Sen’s eyes were burning. The Kingese wasn’t moving. It didn’t come down, and it didn’t go back. It just hung where it was.

Everyone was confused, but somehow, the top of the king tree became super bright again. Many king leaves lit up like a tapestry of suns.

Voila!

The suns began to fall like a meteor shower. Many Kingese fell down from the king tree. They were all coming for Han Sen like a galactic stream. It was like the stars were spilling forth in his direction.

“Shit! What is this?” Seeing all these flying Kingese symbols, Han Sen’s heart felt like it was going to jump out of his chest.

All of the royal children and guards looked on with wide eyes. Everyone was petrified.
