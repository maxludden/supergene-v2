<p>After Han Sen told them his shop name, Feng Fei Fei thought it
sounded familiar. But she paid in no true mind and did not make the
connection.</p>
<p>Everyone was talking and laughing. The shadow of the big sky
demon suddenly appeared next to Han Sen. She came from behind and
held Han Sen’s chest. She whispered into his ear, “My little lover,
that pretty singer has been doomed by a gene race. She is dying. Do
you want to let her die?”</p>
<p>“Which one?” Han Sen whispered back at a volume only he could
hear. He looked at the pure light salamander in his pocket. While
the pure light salamander did react, it was to other gene races. It
did not detect the big sky demon.</p>
<p>“Of course, it is Feng Fei Fei. She is such a beautiful woman,
even I like her. Later, she will be bleeding all over her face. Her
skin will fall off, and she will die. What a shame.” The big sky
demon placed her lips right next to Han Sen’s ear. She used a
seductive tone to speak into Han Sen’s ear.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Feng Fei Fei. Although he did not know much
about gene races, he had learned a thing or two. He could not tell
whether or not Feng Fei Fei was doomed by a gene race, but he could
tell Feng Fei Fei was not well. Her face looked strangely red.
Other people would have thought she had makeup on, such as some
blush on the cheeks girls frequently used. Han Sen knew the red
possessed an evil power. There was a tint of blood in Feng Fei
Fei’s black eyes. One would have been unable to tell it was there
if one did not look closely. It was weird. It was like blood snakes
were writhing around.</p>
<p>Thinking about Feng Fei Fei suddenly bleeding from her nose
earlier, he thought what the big sky demon told him might be
true.</p>
<p>“How do I break the clutch that gene race has on Feng Fei Fei?”
Han Sen quietly asked.</p>
<p>If it was just the average Feng Fei Fei having this issue, he
would not have cared. But Feng Fei Fei was Little Yin’s auntie, and
they seemed close. Han Sen did not want to see Little Yin be upset.
Now that he knew this, he could not just sit and watch. “It is a si
ming demon race,” the big sky demon said with a smile. “It is a
rare god-class gene race. Its master grew this si ming demon race
to the ultimate level. If you had noticed sooner, you might have
been able to get rid of it. Now, her soul has been wholly consumed
by it. You cannot remove its presence now.”</p>
<p>“So, can she be saved?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>The big sky demon sighed and said, “No. If you really like her,
I can try to save her. But it will be very hard. I will require
your assistance.”</p>
<p>“How do I help you?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It is very simple,” the big sky demon said. “Just use your
blood to draw a spell, my love. Put the blood spell on her, then
you can remove the si ming demon race power.” Han Sen smiled. He
did not believe a word big sky demon was telling him. The big sky
demon wanted a blood spell to probably go against his own
wishes.</p>
<p>“My love, if you do not save her, she really will perish,” the
big sky demon calmly said. “Look at her ears if you do not believe
me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Feng Fei Fei’s ear. Due to the fact he and
Feng Fei Fei were sitting next to Little Yin, he could see Feng Fei
Fei’s left ear was extremely red. It was like she was drunk.</p>
<p>It was a red that most people assumed wasn’t a problem. When Han
Sen looked closer, he saw her ear possess vibrant, strained veins
that were spreading like a web.</p>
<p>The si ming demon race was something too rare. Even many nobles
had never heard of its existence. It was also the best part of the
party. No one had noticed something had happened to Feng Fei Fei.
They would have assumed she had become drunk with ease.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen knew Feng Fei Fei had something wrong with her,
he did not know much about gene races. He did not know how to erase
the gene race power on Feng Fei Fei. Seeing Han Sen not do
anything, the big sky demon sighed and said, “Little Loser, you
think too much. If you do not want to lose your blood, there is
only one other way. You have got a blood ghost spirit gene race.
That blood ghost spirit power can suppress the si ming demon race,
but it can only suppress it. You cannot completely erase it. For
that, you require a special skill. “What do I do?” Han Sen quietly
asked.</p>
<p>On V</p>
<p>The big sky demon was fast. She told Han Sen the method
required. He had no idea what she was thinking.</p>
<p>The party went on swimmingly. Once it was past midnight, the
place flickered in the glow of fireworks. Everyone was celebrating
Feng Yin Yin’s birthday.</p>
<p>After the celebration, Feng Fei Fei put a box in front of Feng
Yin Yin. She nicely said, “Little Yin, this is a gift from your
auntie. See if you like it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Auntie.” Feng Yin Yin opened the box immediately.
She did it every year, so she was used to it.</p>
<p>When Feng Yin Yin opened the box, she saw a gene egg inside it
that was shining like a gem. There was even magical music coming
out from the gene egg.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin only knew this was a gene egg. She did not know
what sort of gene egg it was.</p>
<p>Si Tu Ya saw the gene egg and became extremely jealous. She
maintained her calm and said, “Little Yin, your auntie is so nice
to you. This is a very famous sonic gene race. It is an autumn
cicada. Although autumn cicadas are a marquise gene race, it is a
very rare one. It is especially useful for singers. The autumn
cicadas can provide the wielder a very cold, autumnal voice. The
voice might be a bit rough, but the songs you sing will be very
touching. Many singers want autumn cicadas.”</p>
<p>The last sentence Si Tu Ya said was true. She wanted an autumn
cicada, but the autumn cicadas were too rare. Although it was
marquise class, to singers, it was more important than a king-class
gene race. No matter who it was, they would cherish the autumn
cicadas. No one would sell it. It was something most people could
not buy with money.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Auntie. I love it.” Feng Yin Yin grabbed Feng Fei
Fei by the neck and kissed her.</p>
<p>“I am glad you like it. The autumn cicada actually suits adults
more. I was planning to give you a mutant eight sound bug since
that would be more suitable for you, but…” Feng Fei Fei stopped
talking. She thought about the mutant eight sound bug costing 10
million. It was not something she was able to purchase. The young
man next to them said, “The eight sound bugs are not hard to find,
but the mutant eight sound bug is a priceless treasure. It is rarer
than an autumn cicada. It will be very hard to find. You already
did well for finding an autumn cicada.”</p>
<p>Everyone said something similar. Feng Yin Yin said she liked the
autumn cicada too.</p>
<p>“I wonder what Mister Han will provide as a gene race,” a woman
said. “It cannot be a mutant eight sound bug.” She was making fun
of him.</p>
<p>That woman was supposed to be on the main table, but Feng Yin
Yin sat Han Sen in her seat and kicked her away. She felt
humiliated, so she hated Han Sen. She could not help but mock him
and make him look bad.</p>
