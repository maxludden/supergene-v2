    <p>
      In the middle of the Black Desert, Han Sen and the little angel walked.
      They were a good distance away from the shelter, since Han Sen wanted to
      use a beast soul associated with Dollar. As such, he didn&#8217;t want
      Zhou Yumei to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ran across the desert sands, all the while observing the regions
      he paced through.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy popped out of the black sands, and with a maddened stare towards
      Han Sen, let out a fierce gust of icy air.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ignored her sudden appearance and continued his run. The little
      angel swiftly came to Han Sen&#8217;s back and cut off the fairy&#8217;s
      advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel garnered the fairy&#8217;s attention well enough for it
      to go after her, and in this way, the fairy was led countless miles until
      the Yellowstone City was out of sight. Han Sen summoned all manner of
      beast souls and armored up in preparation for a fight against the fairy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the protection provided by the ant king&#8217;s armor and the Devil
      Unicorn&#8217;s elemental shroud, at least Han Sen couldn&#8217;t be
      one-shotted by his fluttering nemesis. He also had Jadeskin prepared,
      revved up and ready to withstand any ice powers that broke through his
      defenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the actual fight, however, little angel would be Han Sen&#8217;s
      greatest weapon. Han Sen&#8217;s combat contributions would be secondary,
      as his attacks did little to the fairy individually; but he at least hoped
      that together they would be greater than the sum of their parts. He
      didn&#8217;t want to use the Sonic-Thunder Punch yet, but he was able to
      incite the fairy&#8217;s fury well-enough without it for now. His
      pestering jabs gave the fairy a rabid lust for Han Sen&#8217;s blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Turning to him, the fairy unleashed its ice powers, and so Han Sen
      retreated for the moment. He evaded her attacks and called for the little
      angel to resume its kiting.
    </p>

    <p>
      After doing this a few times, the harassment of Han Sen&#8217;s petty
      strikes and subsequent evasions got on the fairy&#8217;s nerves. More than
      ever, it desired nothing more than to hack Han Sen into pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy took advantage of her next opportunity to dodge the little
      angel&#8217;s attack and buzzed right past her. Like a wild, icy shadow,
      she quickly gained on Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this did not come as a surprise to him; rather, this pleased Han Sen.
      His eyes flashed as he cast his Dongxuan Sutra. Half of his body gleamed
      like silver lightning, while the other half chimed ominously like an
      ancient bell. The moment the fairy appeared in front of Han Sen, his fist
      blurred towards her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver lightning and the bell sounds came as one. His fist was like a
      silver sun, shooting towards the fairy.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The fairy&#8217;s face convulsed into an expression of hatred, and in
      response she threw her own fist to greet the incoming star. As they
      collided, streaks of silver lightning and cones of exhausted frosty air
      consumed the environment with the noise of a deafening explosion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver lightning could not hurt the fairy, but the bell&#8217;s sound
      threw the fairy for a loop. She began twirling around at the mercy of a
      violent seizure, seemingly dazed out of her ordinary consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The force that was birthed by the collision of fists sent Han Sen
      careening across the desert dunes, a one hundred meter skid mark unfurling
      behind him. Blood flew out of his heaving mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel dashed forward to slice the fairy while its energy was
      disturbed. Her hefty blow finally drew blood, forming a nasty gash.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The fairy was launched into the black sand like a bullet, and it let out a
      screech of agony.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Finish her!&#8221; Han Sen commanded the little angel, as he
      quickly made his own exhausted retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
      After his strike, his body was weak. It would take him a long time to
      recover and become battle-ready again. If the little fairy found its wings
      and resumed its chase, he feared he&#8217;d be killed in no time at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there was no need for the verbal command, because the little angel was
      already raising her greatsword once more. She drove it down into the sandy
      cleft the fairy&#8217;s body had created as it crashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like a geyser, ice burst forth from the sandy crevice. Inside the pit, the
      fairy was down on its knees. With excruciating effort, it lifted one hand
      to block the greatsword.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel&#8217;s eyes flashed, and she brought the greatsword down
      once more. The fairy was drained of her prior power, and now the sword
      managed to pierce through her hand and draw blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy&#8217;s body collapsed into the sand, the blood from the wound
      on its back oozing out at a dangerous speed. She was not done for yet,
      however. She let out another screech and, as if it instilled her with
      renewed vigor, amplified the power of her icy fortification. She stood up
      straight as a frightening, frosty air froze the greatsword that sought to
      end her. Within two seconds, the ice had consumed the entire blade.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel was afraid to get hurt, so she let go of the greatsword
      and took a step back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy used this moment to escape her sandy coffin and race towards Han
      Sen. Her frosty air swirled around her, and although she was heavily
      wounded, her demise did not matter if she could bring Han Sen down with
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! It was the little angel that injured you. What are you
      coming after me for?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart had been dropped into a
      vat of quicksand, recalling how he had actually only managed to hurt the
      fairy once. For the entire time she had hounded him, he had no idea what
      drove her desire for vengeance, or why she despised him so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen boosted his powers a little, so he could throw his frail body out
      of the way and dodge her incoming attack. The fairy looked as if she was
      ready to keel over and succumb to her wounds; whatever happened next, it
      would be her final stand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could not risk coming into contact with any attack the fairy made
      now. With his body in such a weakened condition, he&#8217;d sustain
      grievous damage if he allowed her attacks to touch him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy&#8217;s final strike was stronger than anything that had come
      before. If it was unleashed against the little angel, she would have been
      able to dodge with no problem. But in Han Sen&#8217;s current state, there
      was nothing he could do.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel was trying to catch up to the fairy, but it was too late.
      Knowing it would be impossible for him to attempt an evasion, Han Sen
      summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and held it to his chest right as the
      fairy&#8217;s fist was coming at him.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      An icy tornado was summoned, and it quickly smothered the flames of the
      rex spike. A brutal force was driven into his rex spike, which in turn got
      pushed into Han Sen&#8217;s chest. Han Sen&#8217;s black smoke was doused
      and his armor shattered. He was sent flying.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen was in the air, his entire body and rex spike were consumed
      by a wailing tornado. He became an ice cube, and when he fell back down to
      the ground, he was like an iceberg in the sea of sand.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel caught up from behind, swung her greatsword, and whacked
      the fairy down into the black sand. Blood now gushed from her exposed
      wounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy had reached the end of its tether, and it would soon die. It had
      no hope of competing against the little angel anymore. It was drained of
      strength and its body was covered in exposed wounds that gushed blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel&#8217;s eyes flashed, and she waved her white wings. But
      as she flew towards the fairy, a firework of frost and ice rocketed into
      the air and exploded. The dazzling display brought with it an abundance of
      snowflakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      But within the snowfall, a small shadow fluttered out of the haze with
      great speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy wasn&#8217;t dead, but like a shadow, it took off in the
      direction of the bamboo forest.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen cleaved his way through the ice that encased him. His chest was
      all bloody and cut; even his ribcage was exposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill her!&#8221; Han Sen was now infuriated, and he did not care
      for the wound on his chest. He summoned his wings to give the fairy chase
      and vowed to the heavens above that he&#8217;d kill her.
