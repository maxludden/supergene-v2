  Han Sen was not the only one taking notice of Littleflower, though. Not by a long shot. The whole geno universe had started to pay attention to the previously-unknown Viscount named Littleflower.

Most people didn’t give Han Sen a second thought due to the score he had ended up on, and the title of Sacred was a far more enticing subject to talk about.

Sacred was actually a faction, not a race. In fact, it had once conquered all the other races, and its roots reached far back into the history of the universe. Sacred was actually the very first race to light a lantern.

Despite their former glory, something awful must have taken place that had sunk the faction into darkness and obscurity. It was commonly believed that all the old Sacred elites had vanished from the universe.

But now, someone had used the name Sacred to participate in the Geno Being Scroll’s leaderboard. And in addition to that, that contestant had come out on top of the Viscounts. It was drawing quite a bit of attention.

Truthfully, only the oldest people really knew about Sacred and the implications of Littleflower’s rise. Most people only admired Littleflower’s score because of his tender age.

In the geno universe, size did not represent your age. But, to put it simply, Littleflower just looked like a kid.

On a primal planet, an old man stood clutching a staff. His head was that of a dog. He looked at the Geno Being Scroll’s scoreboard—the Viscount one, in particular. Seeing the name Sacred made his old eyes shine brightly.

“Sacred has an heir?” he asked.

“Those *ssholes of Sacred aren’t dead yet?” Deep in a sea, a dragon-like creature stared up through the water at the scoreboard. The word Sacred worried him.

In many places across the geno universe, mysterious people and creatures were observing the Geno Being scoreboard. They all examined the person occupying first place for Viscounts.

Sacred and Littleflower’s name was suddenly all across the geno universe.

Han Sen’s rank, meanwhile, was way too low. No one paid attention to the bottom ranks of the Marquises.

Deciding to remain in the Fire Lotus system for the time being, Han Sen browsed the web. He soon came to learn that the most popular Marquise wasn’t Lone Bamboo or Dragon Eight: it was a man known as Evil Eye.

Many gamblers had put swathes of money on Evil Eye winning. Some websites had surveys on xenogeneic rankings. On these, Evil Eye had much support. Dragon Eight was in second place in terms of popularity, but Evil Eye was favored multiple times over.

“Who is this Evil Eye? He has so much support. Is he stronger than Lone Bamboo?” Han Sen couldn’t believe this was correct, and so he tried to find more information on Evil Eye.

After checking him out, he realized Evil Eye was actually quite famous.

The Feathers had the Pool of Rebirth, and it could reset geno armaments but also level up a person’s talents. The Buddha had a technique that could pass all knowledge and skills to a person of the next generation.

But those powers weren’t real, physical rebirth. Evil Eye, however, was a person that could really be reborn.

So far, no one knew what sort of creature Evil Eye was. No one knew his race, and they only knew his name was Evil Eye. He had become famous long ago, because he used to be indestructible in the geno universe.

Even deified elites died of old age, and the same was true for Evil Eye. But not long after Evil Eye died, another Evil Eye would be born. The new Evil Eye was not of the same race as the first one, and neither was he as strong. When he was found, he was just an Earl.

But as time passed, this Evil Eye became stronger. He even became stronger than the first Evil Eye. He was unstoppable.

As millennia passed, this cycle continued. Every time Evil Eye died, a new Evil Eye would rise from a different race and become stronger than the last.

Evil Eye had appeared as a Dragon, Demon, Feather, and even as one of the Meka. The only constant thread connecting the Evil Eyes was their possession of four evil eyes.

But Evil Eye himself had said that there had only been one Evil Eye. He said that there was only him and no others.

So, people started to believe that Evil Eye could really be reborn. Whenever he died, he was reincarnated in a new form. What method he used to accomplish this was unknown, as was the reason why he always appeared as a member of a different race.

This time, when he was reborn, no one knew what race he belonged to. All that could be gleaned was the name he had on the scoreboard.

In the initial battle, he hadn’t killed a single opponent. He was at the bottom of the Marquise list, but the name Evil Eye instilled a confidence in the people of the geno universe that he would be the one to become first rank.

After so many cycles of rebirth, his mind had become deified. It was just that his body was still tethered to the level of Marquise. No one would treat him as an ordinary Marquise, though.

Even powerful Marquises like Lone Bamboo and Dragon Eight would think Evil Eye was better than themselves. Evil Eye was above everyone.

“I can’t believe there’s a guy like this out here. It’ll be hard to achieve first place, if so. I hope I don’t run into him too soon. If I do, all my efforts will go to waste if I end up fighting him here at the beginning.” As Han Sen read the legends about Evil Eye, his curiosity grew.

There were ten thousand Marquises who would be engaged in battle, though. He didn’t think he’d be unlucky enough to encounter Evil Eye.

On the day that the ranked fights were ready to begin, all the people in the geno universe watched the leaderboards intently. The strong ones did, especially. They were hoping to fight weak enemies, too.

Quickly, though, the leaderboard on the Geno Being Scroll started to move. When it became legible again, it had split into a schedule of fights.

Han Sen glanced at his listed opponent and noticed it wasn’t Evil Eye. This made him feel very relieved. He didn’t think he was the best Marquise anymore, and he thought it’d be best if he started with a less desperate fight.

But when Han Sen looked closer, he was given a shock. His first opponent was listed as Kahn – Demon.

“It looks like my fate is intertwined with Kahn’s.” Han Sen smiled.
