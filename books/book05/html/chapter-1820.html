<p>Yisha sat on a chair, watching Han Sen gather up power to evolve
a second time. She looked at him emotionlessly, as if she was made
of ice.</p>
<p>But her eyes twitched sometimes, showing that she was not all
that calm.</p>
<p>Her heart was bleeding. After their discussion, Han Sen had used
another three Magnet Fruit elixirs, two Thunder geno fluids, two
Reborn geno fluids, one Fire and Ice geno fluid, and one Beast
Blood geno fluid. They were all the treasures that could force
someone to evolve a second time. Normally, one would be enough to
accomplish this.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had almost emptied her entire treasury by this
point, and he hadn’t evolved a second time.</p>
<p>To Knife Queen, that might have been nothing. But they belonged
to the One, and she couldn’t just take whatever she pleased
whenever she wanted.</p>
<p>These were her private items. She was rich, but these items were
priceless. They couldn’t be bought with money, and Han Sen had yet
to evolve a second time. It made Yisha start to feel quite ill.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, but it looks like I have failed again.” Han Sen
stood up. With this latest failure, he had failed eleven times.
“Continue,” Yisha said emotionlessly. Her eyes twitched another
couple of times, though.</p>
<p>She only had one Boiling geno fluid left to give, and a Cell
geno fluid. If those two didn’t work, her current investments would
have all been for nothing. She wouldn’t know how to deal with him
after she went gone through these.</p>
<p>She couldn’t just let Han Sen go after investing so much in him
with no return. If this were to continue, she’d have to pay a big
price to gain an item that would instigate the evolution she wanted
to see. And that was something that she really, really didn’t want
to do.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed another geno fluid and drank it. Then, he cast
The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>The Spell armor was brimming with energy, and it thumped with
boundless strength.</p>
<p>And then, all of a sudden, a strange power lit up the armor. It
made Yisha’s heart jump. All the other symbols and etchings began
to light up, too. Not long after, the geno armor was covered in
those symbols and scrawls, making it look like a rippling
flame.</p>
<p>Yisha was so happy to see this, and she said, “It’s going to
succeed this time!”</p>
<p>Twelve vials of geno fluid was an investment of goliath
proportions. She felt grand relief seeing this. If the final two
fluids did not help, she wasn’t sure if she would have been willing
to dip her hands into the ones owned by the entire tribe.</p>
<p>Amidst the flame-like symbols, the geno armor started to melt.
It melted into a liquid that then took on another form.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen become a Noble and not a xenogeneic was a great
thing, too. If he became a xenogeneic, things might have been even
harder.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at the geno armor’s shape, trying to figure out
what sort of geno armament he was set to receive. A geno art that
required so much was sure to yield a fascinating result.</p>
<p>The geno fluid kept swirling and changing, and eventually, it
started to become transparent But Yisha’s face started to turn,
too. It looked perplexed.</p>
<p>Most armors would evolve to create something that was obviously
a weapon. You might even find items or enhancements to the armor
itself.</p>
<p>But the geno armament that Han Sen created looked very strange.
It was not finished, but you could start to make out its shape.</p>
<p>It was a crystallizer kid, complete with limbs and a face.</p>
<p>“Is that a doll geno armament?” Yisha was thinking to
herself.</p>
<p>But when the armament had almost finished, Yisha started to look
shocked.</p>
<p>In the air, after the geno armor melted, the geno armament
appeared. It looked so weird.</p>
<p>It looked like a twelve-year-old girl. Her long black hair
reached down to her feet, and her eyes were black, also.</p>
<p>Her skin was white and smooth, like that of a real human. Some
parts of her were wrapped up in white armor, and in her hands, she
was holding two revolvers. There were names etched into the grips
of both guns. Yisha thought it was the language of the
crystallizers, so she wasn’t able to read the words.</p>
<p>The girl moved her eyes and crouched down against the floor. She
lifted her guns and pointed them at Yisha, as if she was guarding
Han Sen from a hostile.</p>
<p>Yisha’s eyes opened wide as she stared at the girl. She had seen
many geno armaments, but nothing like this. This one looked alive.
She had a proper lifeforce. She also looked like she had
intelligence, too.</p>
<p>For a geno armament to have life like that, and to have armor
and guns, her knowledge on what was possible when it came to
evolving was wholly flipped on its head.</p>
<p>When the geno armament finished generating, Han Sen looked at
the girl and said, “Why is my armament a woman? Is that really my
geno armament?”</p>
<p>The grips convinced Han Sen that this really was his geno
armament, though. On the grip of the two pearl-white revolvers, the
letters Spe were carved into one, and the letters II were carved on
the other. Together, they formed Spell. And that was the name of
his geno armor.</p>
<p>When Han Sen used his mind, the woman came towards him. When
they bumped into each other, she became a white armorset that
covered his entire body. The word Spell was written all across
it.</p>
<p>An incredible power filled Han Sen’s body now. It gave him much
more power than the geno armor ever did.</p>
<p>“This is my geno armament!” Han Sen was shocked. He went to
check on its information, and the geno body said he had become a
Duke behind the word Spell.</p>
<p>“My Queen, I think I succeeded!” Han Sen said, looking at
Yisha.</p>
<p>“Very good… now keep practicing.” Yisha was still in shock, and
she was roused from a slumber of deep thoughts by Han Sen’s sudden
shout.</p>
<p>Yisha had never heard of a geno armament like this.</p>
<p>“Maybe this guy really can achieve something special. A geno
armament like this is strange,” Yisha thought to herself.</p>
