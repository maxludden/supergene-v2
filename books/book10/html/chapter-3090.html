<p>Feather Fairy had said that there were scare gene races close to
Holy Light Mountain, so Han Sen was worried. He did not want any
more trouble just yet. With Mister Yang in tow, he sneakily climbed
the mountain.</p>
<p>Ever since he had encountered the big sky demon, Han Sen knew
this world was a weird place. He was unable to get through
everything alone. He needed to keep a low profile and try not to
draw too much attention to himself.</p>
<p>“Mister, is this the legendary Holy Light River’s Holy Light
Mountain?” Mister Yang was shocked. He looked up across the
mysterious mountain with trembling legs.</p>
<p>“I think it is just its name.” Han Sen did not care. He
continued hiking up the slopes of the mountain with Mister
Yang.</p>
<p>Mister Yang’s heart was truly rattled. “Mister, I have heard
that Holy Light Mountain is home to a scary, ultimate gene race. It
has loads of mysterious things about it. Even if top-class elites
visit that area, they are sure to die.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I know a secret path that can safely lead us to the
god temple.” Han Sen walked as he talked.</p>
<p>A mysterious mist was draped over the mountain. One was not able
to see anything. At about 15 feet away, all visibility was lost to
the mist. It was still frightening to keep hearing beasts roar and
thunder echo. Mister Yang was in shock. He followed Han Sen, not
daring to take one step away.</p>
<p>The scene was very scary, but as Feather Fairy had said, they
did not have a personal encounter with any of the dangers during
their climb.</p>
<p>Mister Yang’s body was old. He had not climbed for long before
he was gasping. His forehead was like a raincloud. He was profusely
sweating. He could not climb for much longer. Han Sen had to hold
his body and hike.</p>
<p>It was unknown how high the mountain was. Even with Han Sen’s
speed, it took half a day to arrive at the peak.</p>
<p>It was different from the land below. The peak was very warm and
gentle. It was like a cloud and clearly visible. There was no wind,
thunder, or dust to mar the area. It was a peaceful place.</p>
<p>Atop the peak, there was an old temple. It was made of green
bricks and slate. It looked mysterious and old. It seemed like
there would be no fire inside it.</p>
<p>“Mister, there is a god temple there.” Seeing the god temple,
Mister Yang felt safer.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his head to look upon the grandeur of the
temple’s door. The words “Feather Fairy God Temple” were on it. The
words looked like they had dust and belonged to a fairy.</p>
<p>“Go in. After you get a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, we can return.”
After speaking, Han Sen went into the god temple. Mister Yang did
not dare slow down. He ran toward the god temple and said, “Mister,
I am going to beg now. I am afraid I am too useless. I do not want
to waste your nice gesture.”</p>
<p>After that, Mister Yang walked into the god temple. He went in
front of the god’s altar. According to the gestures required, he
hastily kneeled and prayed. He then dropped a speck of his blood
onto the stove.</p>
<p>He knew the outcome. He didn’t think he’d get a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. He just wanted to get it over with and return home. He
did not want to waste any more of Han Sen’s time. The blood entered
the stove, but there was no reaction. He knew that would happen,
but he was still disappointed.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood in front of the god temple. Mister Yang stood up
and presented him with a wry smile. “Mister, it looks like I wasted
your nice intent of bringing me here.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He was there, but Feather Fairy wasn’t treating
him nicely. He felt a bit angry about that. “It is fine. You stand
here.” Han Sen just wanted Mister Yang to get a God Spirit Blood
Pulse. It was best he did not have to do anything, but he now had
to walk up to the god altar.</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>Han Sen slammed the god’s altar. The stone on the altar was
delivered the mark of a hand. The entire temple shook
violently.</p>
<p>Mister Yang was scared. He waved his hands and yelled, “Don’t do
that, Mister! Don’t do that!”</p>
<p>People in the universe of kingdoms were taught that God Spirits
were superior to everyone and had created the universe. Being alive
meant the God Spirits enabled a human to exist and live. They had
the highest authority.</p>
<p>The god temples were signatures of each god’s power. At all
costs, they were not to be offended. If they were, the God Spirits
would surely dole out punishment.</p>
<p>This dogma existed due to the ability of God Spirits to bless
the blood of others. Most importantly, it resided in the education
of the kingdom. Mister Yang could not be blamed for feeling the way
he did. That was how he had grown up and taught to be.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen slap the altar, Mister Yang thought it was a
grand blasphemy. Even the Qin Kingdom’s king would have never dared
do such a thing</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored Mister Yang and coldly shouted, “Where is
Feather Fairy?”</p>
<p>After hearing what was said, Mister Yang was shocked. Han Sen
had slapped the altar and shouted the God Spirit’s name out loud.
He must have had a death wish.</p>
<p>In the next second, Mister Yang’s face turned pale. He saw
Feather Fairy’s god statue start to glow with holy light. It was
scary. An old fairy-like man appeared and floated down from the
altar.</p>
<p>“Oh, no… Oh, no… A God Spirit has revealed itself. This is bad…
We have to go, Mister.” Mister Yang ran to Han Sen and tugged at
him. Since Mister Yang was old and had no gene-race buff, he was
too slow. He had only just touched Han Sen’s arm when the old fairy
God Spirit floated down before them.</p>
<p>Mister Yang’s face looked grey. He thought, “This is bad. We are
going to die.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the God Spirit bowed to him. He behaved politely
to Han Sen and said, “Little God did not know you were here. I did
not come out to greet you, so please forgive me.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang’s entire body appeared petrified. His eyes were open
wide. He looked at Feather Fairy and Han Sen in awe. His brain was
empty of thoughts. He could not compose one.</p>
<p>Han Sen pointed at Mister Yang and said, “This guy is my
servant. I brought him here to accept a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Can
you give him something?”</p>
<p>Feather Fairy looked at Mister Yang. He then looked at Han Sen
and carefully asked, “Mister, what kind of Blood-Pulse would be
suitable?”</p>
<p>Feather Fairy felt depressed. He controlled a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse, but it cost him god power to give it out. If he gave
his Blood Pulse to someone weak, he would not achieve much. There
was nothing for him to gain.</p>
<p>Mister Yang, who was standing in front of him, was the sort of
person with very bad genes. Under ordinary circumstances, he would
never have even dreamed of giving someone like him a
Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was asking him directly, so Feather Fairy could not
reject the request. Even though that person was too weak, he still
had to give out his God Spirit Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>“Just give him something.” Han Sen looked like he was smiling
but not smiling at Feather Fairy.</p>
<p>Feather Fairy gnashed his teeth and thought, “This time, I am to
lose something no matter what. Instead of fighting back and
allowing Mister Dollar to be upset with me, why don’t I do him a
favor?”</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Feather Fairy lit up the god stove. The god
stove’s holy light was like a volcanic eruption. Many snow-white
feathers arose. They covered the entire god temple. It was like a
million goose feathers were falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, thousands of feathers started flying toward Mister
Yang. They melted into his body. It made Mister Yang’s body feel as
if it was in heaven. It was like a dream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Perfect God Spirit Blood-Pulse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mister Yang was suspicious about whether or not this was all
just a dream. Actually, it was like he had never even dreamed of
this. He now had a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, and it was a complete
God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Not many people earned a perfect God Spirit
Blood-Pulse.</p>
