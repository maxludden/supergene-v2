<p>Pang!</p>

<p>An airship was hit by a shockwave unleashed by a Break World beast’s tail whip. It created a big hole. The ship lost control and rolled around in the air.</p>

<p>Many Rebate children were flung away as more kids cried helplessly inside the ship. It was a rescue ship designated to evacuate school children.</p>

<p>The Break World beast made a happy roar. It opened its mouth wide and moved to the kids who had been flung out of the ship. It also rushed to the ship. It was going to eat the ship and the kids.</p>

<p>Yisha gnashed her teeth. She knew she would be unable to defeat such monsters, but she still raised her knife to try and attack the Break World beast.</p>

<p>The overbearing teeth power struck the scaly armor the Break World beast was wearing. Blood went everywhere. The Break World beast opened its mouth and turned its attention to Yisha. It was going to swallow her.</p>

<p>Yisha’s teeth power exploded with fury. A purple and black knife air blew into the sky. It was a sign she wanted to self-destruct.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Yisha felt a power enter her body. It turned her teeth power, which was inside her body, into nothing. It angered and shocked Yisha. She thought some other scary creature had just arrived.</p>

<p>When she turned around, she realized it was Han Sen who had come behind her. Han Sen put his hand on her back and gently said, “Student meeting a teacher. Let your student handle this matter.”</p>

<p>After that, Han Sen’s strong body strolled past Yisha. He went in front of her and threw a punch at the Break World beast.</p>

<p>The powerful Break World power of the Dongxuan Sutra dismembered the Break World beast. The giant monster was destroyed with one sole punch. A crystal that looked like a teardrop fell out of its remains.</p>

<p>After witnessing this, the Rebate survivors cheered. Yisha looked at Han Sen’s back. She did not know how to feel. What she had just seen kept replaying in her head like a movie.</p>

<p>Back in the day, everyone had abandoned him. No one wanted to accept a crystallizer for a student. Because of a silly bet, she took him on as her own. Yisha never expected, not even in a million years, that her student would turn out to be her rival, Dollar.</p>

<p>She did not expect that student would become a legend of the universe and heralded as the greatest man to exist. Now, he had taken the time to save her and the Rebate.</p>

<p>All those complicated emotions were wrestling within = Yisha’s heart. It made her unable to formulate a sentence in response.</p>

<p>Student. Enemy. Closest stranger.</p>

<p>“Break World beast killed: Red tail killed. Got Break World gene.”</p>

<p>Han Sen reached out his hand to grab the Break World gene. He put it in his pocket and turned around. He bowed again and said, “Greetings, Teacher.”</p>

<p>“Are you mocking me?” Yisha self-deprecatingly asked.</p>

<p>Han Sen shook his head. “If had not had your care back then, I would never have earned the chance to level up and gather resources. I would not have become the man I am today without your assistance. How could I ever forget you and your kindness? Once you became my teacher, you were forever my teacher. You are my teacher forever.”</p>

<p>“Teacher, this is not the place to speak,” Han Sen said to Yisha. “Please take the Rebate and depart Sky Palace. You cannot live here anymore. If you leave Sky Palace, your people will find greater safety. If you can, take the Rebate to Space Garden. That is the safest place.”</p>

<p>Yisha knew this was not the time to talk. She looked at him with a complex mixture of emotions and nodded. She returned to the Rebate and commanded them to take a ship and leave.</p>

<p>Many Rebate people remembered Han Sen. Some people used to believe he was an enemy. They now looked at Han Sen differently. It felt as if he was from a different world.</p>

<p>“Things are hard to predict,” a Rebate king said. “No one would have thought a crystallizer heir, who had been abandoned by the universe, would become one of the universe’s greatest legends.”</p>

<p>There were no more Break World beasts on the way, so Han Sen went to Sky Palace. That was Sky where the worst battle was happening.</p>

<p>He wanted to cover the Sky Palace students. Sky Palace Leader and the elites were fighting the scary Break World beasts that hailed from the White Jade Jing. Many Sky Palace elites had already been slain, so Sky Palace was raining blood. No one knew whose blood it was anymore.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw Sky Palace Leader had a presence that not unlike the tide. He blocked a jade statue that looked like a flying sky demon woman. He was not losing. He had already managed to break the world.</p>

<p>“In the universe, there are people who have managed to break the world!” Han Sen proclaimed as a compliment. To be able to break the world in the geno universe meant one was a very special person.</p>

<p>This was much harder to achieve than it was in the universe of kingdoms. Sky Palace Leader really was the strongest in the whole universe.</p>

<p>Even though Sky Palace Leader had already broken the world, he could not take down the many Break World beasts assaulting Sky Palace. The elites kept fighting, but it was a nasty battle.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked toward White Jade Jing’s 12 buildings and five cities. He noticed the scary presence was getting stronger. He did not know how many terrifying creatures had combined with life souls. He knew this fight would only be a losing one. Victory did not seem possible. He covered Sky Palace and bid for them to fall back.</p>

<p>“Leader, tell the Sky Palace students to retreat. I will take care of the rest.” Han Sen drew his Inch Grey Sword. He used the sword like a knife, prompting many knife lights to break through space. The knife lights crossed each other. The knife lights went against the sky as they headed for White Jade Jing.</p>

<p>The Break World beasts that touched the knife lights had their limbs hacked off. Beast blood spilled everywhere.</p>

<p>“Good kid, always coming to help people in the nick of time.” Sky Palace Leader was covered in blood. Even so, seeing Han Sen was enough to make him joyful. White Jade Jing had too many scary creatures. The 72 killers were breaking the palace too. If Han Sen had not arrived, even if they bled and became a river, they would be unable to fall back.</p>

<p>“You hold on here. I need to see the gourds first.” Sky Palace Leader was not being so polite to Han Sen. He taught Han Sen in the past, and he had accepted Han Yan as a student. His relationship with Han Sen was a special one.</p>

<p>“You can go. I am here.” Han Sen kept swinging his knife. Under the Sky Knife skills created a net of knives that blocked the path from the White Jade Jing. The Break World beasts could not advance.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not have the time to kill the Break World beasts. There was not much he could do alone. When he killed the Break World beasts, there would be more lives open to being killed by Break World beasts elsewhere. All Han Sen could do was block the Break World beasts to cover the retreat of the Sky Palace students and save the lives of as many as possible.</p>

<p>Many knife lights crossed each other. It was like there was a sky net blocking all of space. Han Sen’s knife lights slashed out fast. The gaps became smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>Many Break World beasts broke the knife net wanting to rush through it, but they were only hurt by the knife net.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>A jade light was shining in a White Jade Jing. The jade light broke Han Sen’s knife lights. It made a hole. It was going for Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen froze. The jade light was a jade knife. It was able to create a solid power. That meant the Break World beast in White Jade Jing had a Break World rate of at least 30%.</p>
