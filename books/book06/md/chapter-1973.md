“Suyi, say thank you to Han Sen.” Yun Sushang nudged Yun Suyi with a hand.

Yun Suyi was still a bit rattled, but she stepped forward and said to Han Sen, “Thank you for saving me.”

“It’s okay. Even if I hadn’t struck, it couldn’t have hurt you. I just wanted to find out the power of the Xuan Jade Spirit.” Han Sen smiled. He wasn’t suggesting that Suyi was strong, but acknowledging that Sushang was right beside her.

There was no way the creature would have been permitted to hurt her.

But Sushang was surprised that Han Sen had reacted before she had. Han Sen had just become an Earl, and if his reaction speeds were superior to theirs already, that was most certainly not normal.

Yun Suyi looked at Spell with curiosity. “Han Sen, is that your geno armament? It is special. I have never seen one like that before.”

Thousand Feather Crane was just as curious. Prior to this, they had only seen Spell’s armor mode. Her second mode looked like a person, and this was something they hadn’t seen before.

Han Sen smiled, but he did not answer the question. He asked, “That Xuan Jade Spirit was not strong. Aside from being able to travel through stone, what else can they do?”

Thousand Feather Crane said, “That one was an Earl class Ghost Claw Beast. They aren’t the strongest of Earls, but they are very fast. They can appear through the rock, so they are very dangerous if you are careless. Even cutting off the creature’s claws won’t kill it. They can regenerate. It’s very annoying. If you want to kill it for good, you need to damage the stone it resides in, once it has revealed itself with the claws.”

Yun Sushang said, “Ghost Claw Beasts are too fast. Most of the time, we can’t detect their presence until it is too late. And if they miss or break their claws, they’ll run away. Second chances are rare. So, when you want to kill one, you need two Earls. One can cut the claws while the other pummels the body inside the stone.”

After that, Yun Sushang struck a rock with her knuckles and said, “The Xuanyuan rock is very hard. With our powers, we can only cut through an inch of the stone at a time. The Ghost Claw Beasts raise their claws around one foot out of the rock. Then, they attack.”

Thank you for teaching me,” Han Sen said gratefully.

They kept walking, and Han Sen felt as if the Ghost Claw Beasts were right next to them. One was getting ready to attack again.

It was the same Ghost Claw Beast, and it wanted revenge. It kept following them, ready to perform a Ghost Claw Slash upon them. But it had been hurt by Spell once already, so it was exercising great caution. It didn’t come too close yet, and it watched and waited for an opportunity from beneath the stone.

“Be careful; there are xenogeneics up ahead,” Thousand Feather Crane told them. He was up front.

Han Sen looked forward, and he saw a blurry shadow. Without Thousand Feather Crane’s warning, he would not have known that it was a xenogeneic.

The group soon got close enough to see it clearly, however. It was a bug that was native to the cave, and it looked like a centipede. Its shell was of a bluish hue, and there was a face emblazed upon its back. It looked creepy.

“Earl class Face Centipede. Be careful. Face Centipedes appear in a group, mostly. They don’t travel alone.” Yun Suyi explained this for Han Sen’s benefit, as the others there were no strangers to the cave. Face Centipedes were quite common, and the Sky were familiar with how they behaved.

The Face Centipede soon saw Han Sen, and it came scurrying over. It let out a wretched sound that drew the attention and ire of more in the vicinity.

“Get ready to fight!” Thousand Feather Crane shouted and drew his sword.

Yun Sushang and Yun Suyi wielded swords, as well. First Day didn’t draw a weapon, though; his hands gleamed with white light. He slapped the ground, leaving white marks on the dirt. His spirit covered an area that was three meters wide and brightened up the entire place.

First Day slapped the ground another five times, and then he said something. Then, six spirits rose toward the feet of Han Sen and the others. Power entered their bodies.

“What a strong spirit! It increases power and speed by a lot.” Han Sen was in shock. He looked at First Day, and he was really surprised that the shy Buddha could pull something like this off.

Seeing Han Sen look at him, the Buddha man awkwardly glanced away. He said, “I was sent here to study when I was young. I practiced the Truth Spell of Sky Palace.”

“Very nice,” Han Sen said. Ever since Han Sen had been forced to leave Disloyal Knight behind, he hadn’t seen much in the way of buffs and boons.

Yun Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane stood inside the radius of the spell to fight with the Face Centipedes.

Their sword airs looked like clouds, and they moved like silk in the sky. It was very light and strange.

The Face Centipedes were getting killed by the silk sword air. Their shells cracked under the force, and a few died immediately on contact.

The path was very narrow, and since Yun Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane had a handle on the situation, Han Sen didn’t bother helping.

Yun Suyi wanted to fight, but she couldn’t. She started to say something to Han Sen, and so she turned around. But she looked at Spell, who was standing next to Han Sen, Spell was transforming her pistols into a sniper rifle. The long weapon dropped into Spell’s hands, and she pointed it toward Yun Suyi and pulled the trigger.

Yun Suyi was frozen. Spell had moved too quickly for her to react. She saw a shining bullet fly out of Spell’s rifle and whiz right past her face.

Pang!

The bullet hit the stone wall behind her, and the cracking sound hurt her ears.

Yun Suyi turned around to take a look. A hand bearing jade claws hovered behind her, inches from her neck. It was frozen in place.

There was a bullet hole in the stone wall, and black blood seeped out of it.

> “Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Jade Ghost Claw Beast: Xenogeneic Gene Found.”

An announcement played in Han Sen’s head, but it was a shame he did not receive a beast soul.

“Thank you.” Yun Suyi looked at Han Sen with a complex expression.

This was the second time Han Sen had saved her, and this time, he had managed to one-hit-kill a Ghost Claw Beast by himself. Such reaction speed and powers were difficult to find amongst Earls.
