<p>Although Han Sen thought it would be difficult if he and Mister
Yang wanted a share of this, Peaceful still took them back and
introduced Mister Yang to her partners. Those people were greatly
enthused to meet Mister Yang. They had no problem learning they
were to lose 20% of their cut for his services.</p>
<p>When he returned to his room, Han Sen looked at Mister Yang and
laughed. “Old Yang, I did not expect you to be this
well-renowned.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang had a wry smile. “Sometimes, it is very bad to earn
a reputation and title you cannot live up to. Although I have
knowledge when it comes to looking for Blood-Pulses, I do not have
the power to protect myself. That is the reason why I suffer when
it comes to treasure hunting. Without you, Peaceful would not be so
nice to me. I am afraid I would have to come here against my will,
and I would likely not be given a 20% cut.”</p>
<p>While Han Sen was talking with Mister Yang, he took out the body
of the overbearing bug and started cooking it in the oven.</p>
<p>They were inside a hotel in Ancient God City. They could not
make a fire, so having an oven was not too shabby.</p>
<p>Small Cat was politely sitting next to the oven. He was looking
through the cooker’s window, staring at the slowly roasting meat
inside of it. It wanted to devour what was inside so bad that one
could see the kitten drool in anticipation. When it was eventually
cooked, Han Sen split the meal into three parts. He was going to
give Mister Yang one part, but Mister Yang shook his head. “My old
body cannot accept this gene race meat. You should enjoy it.”</p>
<p>“Do the nobles not eat gene-race meat either?” Han Sen asked
with curiosity.</p>
<p>“People will eat such things only when they have no other
choice, but they will never eat too much. Gene-race flesh has too
much weird energy. Human bodies cannot take too much of that
energy. Only gene races can eat it.” Mister Yang stared at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>He watched Han Sen consume the meat. It made him think, “Is this
guy a gene race? If he is not a gene race, his body and the amount
he can eat is nothing like a human. He is like a gene race. But if
he is a gene race, how can a gene race combine with another gene
race?”</p>
<p>Han Sen and Small Cat, a man and a cat, ate a lot of the
overbearing bug meat. Small Cat was very small, but he had no
problem eating a cow’s weight of the overbearing bug meat. Its
small belly was stretched. It laid out its limbs and comfortably
reclined after the meal. Its small paws were placed on its circular
belly. A look of utter satisfaction crossed the cat’s face.</p>
<p>Han Sen ate a few more pieces. He noticed that he did not get
any gene announcements. He was disappointed, so he stopped
eating.</p>
<p>Mister Yang wanted to say something, but he saw that the night
sky was brightening up outside the hotel.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Mister Yang looked out the window. A purple beam of
light was shot into the sky. It fired into the clouds. It was like
a pillar connecting the sky and the earth.</p>
<p>“That was the location of Evil Lotus God Temple. I wonder what
happened there.” Han Sen stood in front of the window with a frown
as he observed the purple light.</p>
<p>Mister Yang looked at the location for a while. He looked
envious as he said, “Someone has a complete Evil Lotus God
Blood-Pulse. I did not expect Ancient God City was home to such a
genius.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Mister Yang and asked, “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Mister Yang explained, “Normal people get a Blood-Pulse that is
not complete. It is like what we saw before when people got one or
two purple lotuses or even three or four purple lotuses. They are
not complete God Spirit Blood-Pulses. The weird scene that is
happening now means someone has managed to get a complete Evil
Lotus God Blood-Pulse. The talent has maxed out. It is easier to
get a gene race than it is for a normal person. That is their
talent.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Mister Yang sighed and said, “It is very hard
to compete with people. I only want a drop of a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse, but I have never been able to get anything. Others?
They always get what they want. Such geniuses. Ancient God City’s
leader will likely recruit that person.”</p>
<p>“Are God Spirit Blood-Pulses really that important?” Han Sen
really did not understand this concept.</p>
<p>The place where Han Sen grew up depended on effort and power. If
they had power, they could use that power to accelerate their own
growth in the sanctuaries and become stronger. This world seemed to
be completely different. God Spirit Blood-Pulses seemed to
determine everyone’s fate. Without a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, a
person did not even have a chance to get strong. “They are very
important,” Mister Yang bitterly said. “One purple lotus God Spirit
Blood-Pulse makes a baron-class gene race obey. It requires you to
keep communicating and trying even without a guarantee of success.
A complete lotus god pulse can give you a chance to claim king
class gene races. Just think about it. If a 10-year-old boy can
combine king class gene races to fight, it is all smooth sailing.
They become a top-class elite in Ancient God City overnight. Do you
think it is important?”</p>
<p>To him, being unable to get a God Spirit Blood-Pulse gave him
pain and a disadvantage every minute of his life.</p>
<p>While they were talking, the purple light beam spread out like a
lotus flower. It created a giant purple light lotus. It hung in the
sky for a few minutes before it disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen was now very interested in the god temples again. He
wanted to know what might happen if he was to take the test.</p>
<p>“Will Evil Lotus God give me an Evil Lotus God Blood-Pulse?” Han
Sen looked at Evil Lotus God Temple with interest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were too many rules for the god temple
test. Han Sen did not want to act like a bully and disregard the
rules of the god temple, so he decided against it.</p>
<p>As for the rule that required him to pray before Evil Lotus God,
there was no way that was ever going to happen.</p>
<p>The hotel room had a computer. The technology of this world
seemed to be advanced. At least, it was no worse than the universe
computers. Making use of them was a breeze. Han Sen entered the
virtual community and checked out a lot of information. He learned
more about the world.</p>
<p>Just as Mister Yang said, the world was one that used a
Blood-Pulse to determine a person’s level. In any of this
universe’s seven kingdoms, a person was the cheapest and least
regarded in society if they didn’t have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse.
Many such people were sold like slaves.</p>
<p>The more God Spirit Blood-Pulses one received, the higher up on
the societal ladder one was.</p>
<p>But that was not absolute. Having a powerful God Spirit
Blood-Pulse meant nothing if a person did not have a powerful gene
race to back them up. Without one, they were just as useless.</p>
<p>The kings of the seven big kingdoms had destroyed class God
Spirit Blood-Pulses. That was how they ruled the world. What made
Han Sen feel weird was that in the virtual community, he was not
able to search about Reboot class god temples or God Spirits. It
seemed as if no one had ever received a Reboot class God Spirit
Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>“Reboot class God Spirits should be in the geno hall, but this
world does not seem to have a geno hall. This is weird.” While Han
Sen was browsing the information, he found an interesting virtual
community function.</p>
<p>This function tested the strength and determined the level of a
God Spirit Blood-Pulse.</p>
