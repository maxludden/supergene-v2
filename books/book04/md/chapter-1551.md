When Han Sen took a look inside, he was shocked. Inside the chimenea, a pair of eyes were looking up at him.

Fortunately, Han Sen had been through a lot, so he maintained his cool and did not look away. Instead, he just stared right back at the eyes.

It didn’t look real. The owner of the eyes was something clad in armor, and it was dark like the chimenea itself. The being was sitting inside the chimenea with just its eyes showing, and Han Sen couldn’t make out anything else. On some level, however, it looked human.

“Human? Spirit? Or humanoid creature?” Han Sen wondered to himself, as he continued staring back down at the pair of eyes in the armor.

Bao’er climbed atop Han Sen’s shoulder and looked down the exhaust again. Seeing the creature clad in armor, even she thought it was a curious thing.

Not long after, Little Fairy, Jade Little Lion, Little Silver, and Little Star arrived. They also took a look at what was inside the chimenea. The eyes inside the chimenea were unmoving. They continued to stare at Han Sen and ignored the others that were now present.

Han Sen’s heart eventually skipped a beat. With the eyes staring at him, it felt as if he was being watched. It shocked him, and he thought to himself, “Does this mean that this is the thing that keeps watching me in God’s Ruin?”

As Han Sen continued to get stared at by those eyes, he wondered if the thing was watching every creature, or if it really was transfixed with Han Sen himself.

Han Sen had originally thought every creature that entered God’s Ruin might get watched, but with the eyes staring at him, ignoring all the others, he did not think his theory was correct.

Little Fairy and the others all looked bored after seeing it. They thought it might be a treasure, not something living.

Still, in their hearts, there was some element of shock. The chimenea had exuded a horrible icy flame. It was brutal even in a neighboring proximity which prohibited them from getting close.

The creature was now sitting there in the chimenea, and only heaven would know how long it might have been burning for. Whatever the answer was, they could guess how powerful the creature inside might have been.

They were in such surprise, though, they didn’t know if they should leave. The creature in the chimenea had seen them, and if it chose to alert the Black Seahorses and a chase ensued, they’d all find themselves dead very quickly.

Jade Little Lion and Little Star had become super class, but not even they would help triumph against eleven Black Seahorses.

Before they could run off, though, they heard a not-too-distant sound of crying. It shocked them.

They looked around for the source and saw a one-meter-tall Ice Seahorse. Somehow, it was inside the sea of clouds. With its megaphone-looking mouth, it was making those sounds at them.

It did not seem hostile, and it just looked at them with curiosity.

But after the noise subsided, the bigger Ice Seahorses and Black Seahorses quit their get-together. Then, a few dozen eyes turned to stare at Han Sen and his group.

“Run!” Han Sen said and immediately took off running.

Han Sen’s power was very strong, but he had only reached super. Every Black Seahorse was super class, but there was also the Ice Seahorses backing them up and the enigmatic creature inside the chimenea. If they stayed behind for a fight, it was likely they would end up in bad shape.

They kept running downhill as the little seahorse followed.

The eleven Black Seahorses that had seen them looked incredibly angry, and they gave an earnest chase. They were much faster than Jade Little Lion, too, who was now super.

“Oh no! These Black Seahorses are too scary. We’ll be dead if they catch us.” Jade Little Lion looked back and was shocked by what he saw. A Black Seahorse was directly behind him.

Han Sen chomped his teeth, then grabbed Bao’er and Little Silver and brought them onto Little Star’s back. Then he shouted, “Come up here! Run, Little Star!”

Little Fairy leaped up and so did the little seahorse. It looked like it was actually having fun.

Starsea Beast used its Starsea power, and then, its body shone with countless stars like a galaxy. Its speed was supremely fast now, as well.

“Wait for me!” Jade Little Lion caught up, but he was too big. All he could do was cling to Starsea Beast’s tail.

With the stars all around, Starsea Beast’s body enabled it to traverse through glaciers. The Black Seahorses were unable to catch anything, and all they did was crash into the glaciers, shattering them. Still, the Black Seahorses were determined and not yet willing to abandon the chase.

Starsea Beast continued to travel through the glaciers like this, as the Black Seahorses hounded them from behind. Aside from the Black Seahorses, the Ice Seahorses had started to chase them, too. They made a shrill moaning sound.

Dong!

All of a sudden, the Black Seahorses then turned and entered the clouds. The chains from the chimenea manifested and attached to the Black Seahorses. The chains bound the necks of the Black Seahorses and prohibited them from traveling any further. The chains pulled them back all the way to the chimenea.

They grumbled and grunted with anger, unable to escape the binding.

The Ice Seahorses were still able to maintain their pursuit of Starsea Beast, but when it traveled through a few additional glaciers, the seahorses lost track of Starsea Beast.

They were able to hear the cries of the seahorses when the pursuit was on, but they couldn’t any longer.

“Starsea Beast is great for escaping.” Han Sen felt rather happy on the inside. The speed and power of Starsea Beast, now that it was super, had increased by a lot.

Starsea Beast eventually came to a stop on an icy field. Everyone dismounted it at that point. Jade Little Lion made sure to examine Starsea Beast and profusely compliment the creature. “This brother can travel through objects? Wow. This is far too strong.”

The little Ice Seahorse that had followed them now looked frightened. It spun around in circles, as if it could no longer find its mother. It kept crying as if it missed its parents.

They were now very far away from the seahorses, and no matter how hard it whined, its parents wouldn’t hear it.

Bao’er jumped onto the back of the little Ice Seahorse, and with her fat hands, she stroked its head.

“Calm down! Don’t be afraid. Bao’er is here for you.”

The little Ice Seahorse rubbed its head into Bao’er as it cried. It looked as if it had found protection now, and it didn’t look as helpless as it just had.
