<p>“It is useless,” Old Vulture said with a cocky laugh. “The race
lantern has returned. Even a sky full of God Spirits would not
stand a chance. Aside from Little Master, who has a holy body, no
one can go in. No one can hurt it.”</p>
<p>The demon lady asked, “Han Sen, why are you so stubborn? Little
Master is everyone’s leader. You are his father. Why are you
getting in his way?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the cause karma knife. He kept pushing down.
Knife lights and the holy palace’s lights kept striking each other.
The holy palace’s light was shaking, which also made Han Sen’s
hands shake. The skin between his thumb and index finger cracked.
The boiling blood was shaking out of the wound.</p>
<p>“Littleflower can decide if this is the way. It is just as you
guys said. This path has been decided for him because you
yourselves are too scared to walk it. You guys make Littleflower
walk it instead, and he is just a child. If you want to rebuild
Sacred’s glory, use your own blood to build it. If you want to kill
a sky full of God Spirits, use your own knives to kill them. Using
the lives of others to finish your dreams that you yourselves could
not accomplish… Pah! You make it sound so glorious. You guys are
pathetic.” Han Sen harshly spoke each word, which was like a sharp
blade.</p>
<p>“How can we explain it in a way for you to understand? In this
world, only Little Master has a holy body. Only he can use a holy
spirit armament and control the race lanterns. Only he can do
something like that. Even if we wanted to do it ourselves, it would
be impossible.” Old Vulture was angry.</p>
<p>The demon lady said, “Han Sen, there are some things that are
just meant to be. It is like how no matter how strong you are, you
cannot use Sacred’s race lantern. It will resist. It is like how
you cannot set water on fire or make a fire stop. The world
approves of the Little Master. It accepts Little Master as its
savior. There are responsibilities he has to assert control of. He
cannot avoid what his destiny compels him to do.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked very stable. He kept pushing down his cause karma
knife. Even the light power made the cause karma knife’s surface
burn. It made Han Sen’s body burn too, but he did not relent.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked very angry as he burned. He kept accelerating the
growth of his power. Han Sen would have rather exposed his super
God Spirit body to destroy the bullshit of Sacred.</p>
<p>“The universe will continue to function even if a few important
people are lost, which includes me,” Han Sen coldly said. “No one
is born its savior. No one should be forced to carry such a grand
burden the moment they are born. Compared to death, a so-called
destiny is just the fate of your heart. If you are willing to carry
it, anyone can fulfill their destiny. Sacred Leader was the best of
his generation. He achieved everything. He commanded everything. He
controlled everything. Even if he committed a crime, that was his
destiny to carry. Even if he deserved to die, I, Han Sen, would
admire him to have the courage of carrying such a destiny. I cannot
believe his subordinates were just a bunch of useless creatures
without any guts or knowledge. You insult Sacred Leader’s name and
legacy.”</p>
<p>The demon lady, Old Vulture, eyeless beast, and Red Ghost heard
his words and felt angry. They were not Han Sen’s opponents. Even
if they felt insulted, they did not dare walk out of the holy
palace’s light to fight Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You are just trying to play word games,” Old Vulture coldly
said. It was furious. “If you say everyone can carry their destiny,
why don’t you go and control the lantern and control the holy
palace? If you cannot do it, then what you just said is bullshit.
That is just your crazy talk because you are so small, useless, and
jealous.</p>
<p>Back in the past, they were very powerful in the universe.
Everyone was scared of them. For Old Vulture, in particular, Han
Sen had just claimed it was a coward. How could it not be mad?</p>
<p>“It does not matter if I succeed. I tried my best, and that is
something I am fine with.” Han Sen looked certain. Old Vulture’s
words were unable to change his mind.</p>
<p>Old Vulture wished to say something, but it saw a white flame
arise on Han Sen’s body. It burned like mad on him.</p>
<p>“This… Impossible… This is impossible…” Old Vulture, upon seeing
the flames, was shocked. It could not believe it.</p>
<p>The demon lady, Red Ghost, and eyeless beast opened their eyes
wide. They looked at the wreath-like flames on Han Sen. Their faces
looked as if they had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“Impossible… That is impossible… Only holy bodies can use a holy
spirit armament. How can he…” As the flames around Han Sen’s body
grew brighter, the demon lady’s eyes opened wider.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>The roaring sound carried across space. Han Sen was turning into
a light shadow that carried white light and looked like a Kirin. He
raised his head and looked down. It was the Holy Kirin’s holy
spirit.</p>
<p>“The Holy Kirin… Impossible… Aside from our Little Leader who
has a holy body, no one can control the holy spirit armament. No
way…” Seeing that power which was like a holy beast covering Han
Sen’s body’s Holy Kirin shape, Old Vulture acted as if he had lost
his soul.</p>
<p>The demon lady, Red Ghost, and eyeless beast were like wooden
chickens. They were all staring at the light of the Holy Kirin
completely unable to speak.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Holy Kirin’s holy spirit turned into a white flame. It was
headed toward Han Sen’s cause karma knife. The holy light made the
cause karma knife light burn. The knife flames burned stronger and
stronger like a burning, bright sun.</p>
<p>The Holy Kirin’s holy spirit totally went into the cause karma
knife. The knife turned transparent. One was able to see the Holy
Kirin’s spirit mark on it.</p>
<p>Han Sen clutched the cause karma knife tight and felt an endless
power surge through the blade, which made him feel calm.</p>
<p>Earlier, he was not able to use the Holy Kirin. Now, for some
reason, it was reacting, and he was able to summon it.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood why the demon lady and the others placed so
much faith in what the holy spirit armament could achieve for them.
The Holy Kirin provided a power that was so strong one could not
imagine it.</p>
<p>Even a god personality armament like the Sky Vine Radish God
Lance could not compare to the power possessed by the Holy Kirin.
It was like a star or a moon.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed. He broke the light of the holy palace. Han Sen
entered the holy palace wherever the knife light went. The first
thing Han Sen destroyed was the holy palace’s door.</p>
<p>“No… No…” The demon lady, Old Vulture, Red Ghost, and eyeless
beast looked hopeless and roared madly.</p>
<p>The race lantern’s power was useless against the holy spirit
armament. It was unable to prevent Han Sen’s advance. They did not
understand why Han Sen was able to use the Holy Kirin’s holy
spirit. That should have been impossible.</p>
<p>The holy palace’s door was cut in half. They fell on both sides.
Han Sen was holding the holy spirit that was infused with the cause
karma knife. Suddenly, he entered the hall. Wherever the light
went, the burning stone statues broke. Limbs and broken walls were
everywhere. Han Sen stood in front of Qin Xiu and the four holy
beast’s stone statues. He wildly waved the cause karma knife’s
flames.</p>
