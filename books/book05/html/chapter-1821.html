<h3>Chapter 1821</h3>

<p>Yisha allowed Han Sen to write down the content of The Story of
Genes so she could look over it. She wanted to help Han Sen learn
and modify the later parts to facilitate his practice.</p>
<p>Because the practice method was so demanding, if no changes were
made, it would be much harder to level up and ascend. It would be
even harder to generate geno armaments. He would need to be a god
to practice it in its entirety.</p>
<p>After the changes, the power would be decreased, but if it
weren’t edited, then it couldn’t be learned at all. This thing was
not created for the average joe to fool around with. Because
modifying took a long time, she allowed Han Sen to continue
practicing for now. And when she was done, they would begin
anew.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to his garden and summoned Spell. He wanted to
know what powers she possessed. He was mostly interested in the two
revolvers she wielded, and he wanted to know if the guns could fire
bullets.</p>
<p>Spell moved by her own volition. She did so with gentle grace,
and as she clutched the two revolvers, she was able to fly around
effortlessly and shoot the flowers all about</p>
<p>The revolvers could fire bullets and hit the flowers. Her
accuracy was good.</p>
<p>But Han Sen noticed that the bullets weren’t solid, and they
cost energy to fire. Even Han Sen’s own energy was drained by the
attacks. Spell was Han Sen’s geno armament, so it made sense that
it could be used as a weapon. But he also realized the more power
he was willing to put in, the more powerful the bullets fired would
be.</p>
<p>Those bullets did not have any special powers, though. Perhaps
it was because he was too low level. Becoming a Viscount might
change things.</p>
<p>Barons couldn’t unleash powers from a distance. They had no
ranged attacks they could use, so at least where Barons were
concerned, having Spell was something that was a little
overpowered.</p>
<p>Han Sen tested it quite a bit, and he realized he could command
and control Spell in battle. Her movements were controlled by Han
Sen’s thoughts. There was no delay, despite the distance that
separated them.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not need to control her all the time, though. With
just a thought, Spell could be put to any task, and she’d finish it
by herself. She was like a living thing, for the most part, and she
possessed a lot of intelligence.</p>
<p>“She’s like a real lifeform. Gee, that The Story of Genes is
strange,” Han Sen thought to himself. He really liked Spell, and
valued it far above something like a sword or whatever else he
might have gotten. He could do a lot more with this.</p>
<p>Aside from Yisha, though, no one else had learned that he had a
geno armament. The news about Yisha using twelve geno fluids to
make Han Sen a geno armament did circulate, though.</p>
<p>All the Rebate that heard this could not believe their ears.</p>
<p>No matter how bad the creature was, one or two geno fluids
should have made them Noble. And Han Sen had taken twelve. How bad
was he?</p>
<p>Many of the high-class Rebates believed raising Han Sen was
pointless. If it was so difficult for him to generate a geno
armament, becoming a king and refining the feather would be so much
harder.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother raising a talentless person like that”</p>
<p>“No wonder those elites did not invite Han Sen to join them. He
is way too bad.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what Queen was thinking, using twelve geno fluids.
Even if he does have a deified feather, there is such a low chance
he can become deified. How much is it going to cost to get him to
that level? The resources she wasted could have made two
semi-deified warriors.”</p>
<p>All of the Rebate were talking about this. Some ministers and
elites had already come to consult with Yisha, informing her that
she should give up on Han Sen now.</p>
<p>Yisha did not explain her reasoning, and neither did she take
their advice. And she said that when the Narrow Moon tunnel opened
up, Han Sen would be a part of it</p>
<p>After that, the Rebate communities exploded with talk of Han Sen
and Yisha.</p>
<p>Twelve geno fluids to become a Noble Baron. Already it was seen
as a pointless idea, but Yisha felt differently. She still wanted
to raise Han Sen up. She even wanted to give him a name for the
tunnel. It was hard to take the minds of others off of this
idea.</p>
<p>Many of the elites thought that Yisha raising an outsider and
taking him as a student meant they had some sort of secret
relationship.</p>
<p>Yisha hadn’t even performed a ceremony when she accepted him as
a student. With the sudden induction, they all believed she knew
how bad he was, but she was forging ahead anyway.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why would the queen accept a student so quietly?</p>
<p>No one was willing to challenge Yisha’s desires, though. But
even so, everyone was determined to continue hating Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed in the garden to practice with Spell. He had no
idea people were talking about him the way they were.</p>
<p>Even if he had known, though, he wouldn’t have cared. Han Sen
might have looked young, but he had gone through life and death
experiences few others could equal. He had experienced everything a
person could, a long time ago. He was not totally uncaring, but he
wouldn’t waste many feelings on petty quarrels, either.</p>
<p>Yisha summoned him and told him to practice in Narrow Moon. If
he went, that would be the first time he had exited the garden.</p>
<p>“Before you go to Narrow Moon, I will teach you a knife skill.
Try to learn as much of this as you can.” When she said that to Han
Sen, her voice sounded strange.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t notice, though. He didn’t realize how many
talented young Rebates were waiting in Narrow Moon to teach him a
lesson. Narrow Moon’s space tunnel opened once a year, and only
Barons could enter. Only ten of them could go at a time. Only the
best Barons would be there, as a result.</p>
<p>To claim a spot, you had to be an approved and formally
recognized genius. And you also had to have proof to support any
claim of excellence. In addition, you had to receive an invite from
an elder.</p>
<p>Han Sen had nothing, and yet, Yisha had claimed a spot there for
him. People weren’t very happy about that, and the young men who
had claimed the other nine places didn’t like him at all.</p>
<p>Some of the young ones were preparing to teach him a lesson
inside the tunnel, because when Han Sen got bullied in there, Yisha
wouldn’t be able to do anything to save him.</p>
