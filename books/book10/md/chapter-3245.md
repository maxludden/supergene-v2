  Han Sen used all the power he could. He temporarily suppressed the reverse Super God Spirit mode. It slowed down the gold spreading in Qin Jing Zhen’s body. It enabled him to last another three to four years.

Wan’er’s power was too strong. The power of Wan’er from both worlds being combined into one pushed the reverse Super God Spirit mode to the max.

“Thank you, Mister God Spirit.” Qin Jing Zhen stood up and bowed.

Qin Jing Zhen was Qin Kingdom’s leader. When he looked at the God Spirit, even he lowered his head in a show of respect. After all, the humans of the universe of kingdoms used the power of God Spirits to fight. They adored God Spirits.

“You do not have to do this, My King. Your wounds will be fine for another three years. After three years, it will depend on your will.” Han Sen lifted Qin Jing Zhen.

After he left the palace, Han Sen returned to the Feng family castle.

He met many officers on the way, and they all looked at Han Sen strangely.

Han Sen’s sword skills were very strong, so they looked at him with fear. No matter how much Qin Jing Zhen said Han Sen was a good person, people’s eyes showed their doubt. That was especially true in the Qin Kingdom, where the system of law was enforced. It made people hate Han Sen more than they could adore him.

Even some officers at the castle gates were shouting about Han Sen being an evil officer that destroyed kingdoms. They begged Qin Jing Zhen to remove that poison from the realm.

Even though Han Sen did not see it, he could imagine Qin Jing Zhen’s table being stacked with letters. It was likely that 90% of that mound were demands for his arrest.

Han Sen did not care. He also was not in the mood to change his image in the hearts of the people of the Qin Kingdom. Back in the Feng family castle, Han Sen took to playing with the half-burned candle. That candle was remarkably strange. When holding the candle, Han Sen was able to see the spirits of dead creatures. The spirits did not seem to be active. They merely floated to the sky toward the eerie image of the geno hall.

The geno hall was only visible by holding the candle. He discovered that when he put the candle down. He immediately realized that the geno hall could no longer be seen. It was really weird.

Han Sen thought, “If I hold this candle and go into space, I wonder if I can enter that geno hall.”

He knew the half-burned candle possessed a mysterious power, but he could not really use it for much. He was unable to combine with it, and it had no tangible power he could wield.

Han Sen thought, “I do not know where Night God No Moon received this half-burned candle from, so I will definitely have to ask her the next time I see her.” He then put the candle away.

Han Sen planned on going to the Chu Kingdom’s ice fields. His trip there had been delayed for too long. He had yet to find a suitable gene race. Therefore, he was going to test his luck out in the ice fields.

Due to the fact he was going to the Chu Kingdom, a place where the people of the Qin Kingdom should not go, Jian Bu Gu was not going with. If he left the Qin Kingdom, he would have probably been killed by people from the Wu Wei Dao Palace. Han Sen only took Bao’er and Small Cat with him. Even the little flying fish was left behind with Qin Bai.

Jade Wall City had the Dark Dragon Promise. It was so solid that it was like a golden soup. Now, many of the Qin Kingdom elites were around. Without the black dragon, they could not gather up any power. It meant they were feeble.

Just in case, Han Sen put the little flying fish next to Qin Bai. Qin Jing Zhen would take care of Qin Bai’s safety, so everything should have been ready for his departure.

A giant iceberg floated in deep space. The stars were very small compared to the ice field.

This was a big system, but there was a scary ice light that froze most of it. That was also because of the ice fields. Many planets were frozen there.

Because the ice fields were so special, the planets were frozen inside the ice fields. As a result, digging land pulses to get to gene eggs was very difficult.

Many land pulse masters were unable to do anything about the ice fields in the Chu Kingdom. Only some very good land pulse masters were able to find land pulses and weird scenes below the sheets of ice.

Even so, to break the land pulses that lurked beneath the ice was still very hard.

Everyone knew that super god pulses were lying in wait in the ice fields. Unfortunately, there just were not many people there who could find and dig up the land pulses. Even if there were people of the Chu Kingdom that were very close to the place, they would never want to go there.

In the ice fields, two handsome young men rode atop a jade Kirin.

If one looked closer, one would find a young man that looked pretty and beautiful. His neck didn’t even have an Adam’s apple. It was a woman disguised as a man.

“Big Sister, do these ice fields really have that legendary gene race ice jade evil lady?” the man asked with some amount of confusion.

The woman disguised as a man heard him and replied, “According to Xuan Mi Zong’s old scroll, this weird scene is a jade ice fairy sign. There is an 80% to 90% chance that there will be the rare gene race ice jade evil lady. This time, we must get the rare gene race so that our Xuan Mi Zong can have another rare gene race.” “If it really is the ice jade evil lady, does that mean you can use her power to practice our Xuan Mi Zong’s secret and amazing skill?” the man asked. “Let’s just find the ice jade evil lady first,” the woman coldly said.

Two jade Kirins were running across the ice fields. Suddenly, a man was moving amidst a snowstorm. The hearts of the pair jumped. They looked at the ice. When they saw the shadow, the man and the woman were shocked. The shadow on the ice displayed a young man holding a female baby.

The young man looked like he was around 20 to 30 years old. He looked very manly.

The baby in his arms was around four or five years old, or so it seemed. She was in the man’s robe. Only her little head was sticking out. She was curiously observing the storm around them.

“Who is this man? Why would he bring a little girl to such a place?” the woman asked with a frown. She looked at him with disdain. She knew the seven kingdoms had many places that took men seriously but not women. He should not have taken a little girl to such a dangerous place.

The ice air in the ice field was not something a little girl should have been able to endure. If he was there to dig land pulses, he should not have taken the little girl there.

That was unless the little girl served a special purpose, such as being the fuel for a sacrificial skill. If they saw a Yin and evil land pulse, they could use the blood of a female baby to do a blood sacrifice. That way, they could find a Yin pulse at least.

Many evil land pulse masters used that land pulse skill, but they decided to use slaves as a sacrifice.

A gold pulse out on the ice fields was an extremely Yin place. Thus, the woman assumed that was who they were.

The man laughed. “If you are worried about the little girl, why don’t you go and check them out? If she is talented, recruit her into the Xuan Mi Zong. That would be a good deed.”

The woman nodded. She steered the jade Kirin to where the little girl was.
