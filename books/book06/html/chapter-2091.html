<p>Han Sen followed Li Duo through Night Ring 12th Street. They
checked out a few places, with many of them being murder scenes.
Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan each area for details.</p>
<p>The strangest thing was that the only traces Han Sen picked up
had been left by Night Ghosts. He couldn’t see any sign of there
being any other creatures around.</p>
<p>“Strange. Normally, any creature that passes through would leave
behind a substance to trace. There cannot be nothing. Unless the
murderer can control its physical form to the molecular level, this
suggests the murderer might very well be a Night Ghost. There is no
evidence of any other being around here, after all,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>“Did you find anything?” Li Duo couldn’t help but ask. She had
already taken Han Sen to several locations.</p>
<p>“No.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>“I told you that we need the Sky to sort this out. We’ll need
your Sky people to come and check out these crime scenes,” Li Duo
said.</p>
<p>“He is on his way. I’m just trying to do some of my own
investigating. Take me someplace else, so I can report to Brother
Sky,” Han Sen said seriously.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Li Duo led Han Sen to another crime scene.</p>
<p>“Are there any other intelligent creatures around this planet?”
Han Sen asked as they walked.</p>
<p>The universe was comprised of a variety of races. It was rare to
see one race govern more than their own small area. Han Sen had
been in Night Ring 12th Street for a while now, and all he had seen
living there were Night Ghosts.</p>
<p>“The environment of this planet is special. Most races couldn’t
fathom living here,” Li Duo said.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any other races living in Night Ring 12th Street?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Li Duo thought and then said, “There are a few on the planet,
but they aren’t in Night Ring 12th Street.”</p>
<p>“Oh, what does that mean?” Han Sen looked confused.</p>
<p>Li Duo hesitated for a moment, but then said, “Night Ghosts love
eating meat, but there aren’t many creatures on Planet Night Ghost.
So, the meat is imported from another planet. Over the last
century, we have been cooperating with the Taurus. They have a base
not far outside of Night Ring 12th Street. If you want to find a
foreigner, they would be it.”</p>
<p>“I recall that the Taurus belonged to the Demon. Why don’t you
buy food from Sky Palace, anyway? Why rely on the Taurus?” Han Sen
asked after a moment.</p>
<p>“We have no choice. The food we require is special. Normal races
cannot satisfy our needs, and the Taurus are the only ones who can
supply what we need. The Sky Palace leader has approved our ties,”
Li Duo said.</p>
<p>“Where is their base now?” Han Sen thought he’d have to go and
take a look. The Taurus were dangerous, and they very well could
have been the ones doing this.</p>
<p>“It cannot be them,” Li Duo said immediately.</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen was surprised by her certainty.</p>
<p>“We have a contract. They only live in their base, and they do
not venture beyond it. And furthermore, there are cameras all
around their base. If they left their zone, they would be
discovered. If they entered Night Ring 12th they’d be found out
because they look so different.”</p>
<p>After a while, Li Duo resumed talking. She said, “The leader of
that base is Marquise Khan. He is of the Demon. He is a noble
gentleman, too. He wouldn’t be the one doing this.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I am just going to go scope it out on behalf of my
brother. It’s so I can have answers for him if he asks me about
them.” Han Sen smiled while he spoke.</p>
<p>He followed Li Duo out of Night Ring 12th Street. They were
going to the Taurus base. Han Sen was thinking, “The Demon are the
leaders of the Taurus. I guess it isn’t too strange for a Demon to
be here, but still, the Demon might have motive… Is it just a
coincidence?”</p>
<p>When they reached the Taurus base, he realized that it was
actually like a space station. The interior was wholly sealed.</p>
<p>“It looks like they can’t cope with the environment here. They
needed to create a place that was suitable for them to live.
Otherwise, they could not stay here for very long.” After Han Sen
entered, he felt that it was a far more comfortable environment for
a human as well.</p>
<p>“Miss Li Duo, why are you here?” Two Taurus guards smiled. It
looked as if she was well-known around there.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not surprised. He hadn’t thought that an ordinary
Night Ghost would try to prohibit his passage. She must have been
sent by Sleepless Duke, but her exact identity was still unknown to
him.</p>
<p>But through their conversation, Han Sen had quickly realized
that Li Duo was Sleepless Duke’s daughter.</p>
<p>“Miss Li Duo.”</p>
<p>Han Sen and Li Duo led to a meeting room, and shortly after, a
Demon wearing a black suit entered. He looked very refined, and he
said hello to Li Duo.</p>
<p>Li Duo stood up and said, “Marquise Kahn. I am sorry to bother
you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was checking out Marquise Kahn. He was an attractive
Demon. His face was handsome and memorable.</p>
<p>Something about him gave Han Sen the sense he was dangerous,
though. It was the same feeling Han Sen got when he encountered
Sharon.</p>
<p>“A small Taurus base has a Demon leader? This whole thing is
getting interesting.” Han Sen was sizing up Kahn with interest.</p>
<p>He had been focusing on practicing geno arts lately, and he had
only learned a little bit of Suppress Evil. He had only come here
because he had been ordered to. But now Han Sen had an interest in
the affair. He didn’t think the mission was as bad as he initially
believed it to be.</p>
<p>“Marquise Kahn, this is an assistant of Sky Palace. He is merely
here to look around. This is just a normal investigation.” When
Marquise Kahn showed up, Li Duo could barely keep her eyes off him.
Anyone could tell Li Duo liked him very much.</p>
<p>“I’m Kahn. It is nice to meet you, Mister Han.” Kahn looked at
Han Sen and smiled. Then, he extended his hand.</p>
<p>You know him?” Li Duo was surprised. She didn’t say Han Sen’s
name, and she hadn’t introduced him. If Kahn knew his surname, then
he was already familiar with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Han Sen from Sky Palace. I’m afraid the whole world knows who
he is,” Marquise Kahn said.</p>
<p>Li Duo looked at Han Sen with confusion.</p>
<p>“Marquise Kahn, can you answer a few questions?” Han Sen shook
his hand and smiled.</p>
<p>“Of course, but before that, I hope you can come take a look at
something. Murders like those in your investigation have occurred
here, too,” Kahn said.</p>
