<h2>Where the Relic Lies</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2369</h3>

<p>Han Sen frowned, and Lilly looked upset. Then he realized
something.</p>
<p>Han Sen was riding atop the blood kirin, following slowly behind
Lan Haixin. He behaved as if he didn’t care, but the truth was, he
didn’t know where the relic was. He stayed carefully behind Lan
Haixin where he wouldn’t have to lead the party.</p>
<p>What confused Han Sen was that the old female Siren in front
wasn’t guiding them away from Planet Water Zone. They were actually
headed for the deeper recesses of the sea.</p>
<p>“Does the Siren treasure reside here on the planet? If the
treasure is here, why haven’t they just gone and taken it already?”
Han Sen thought for a minute and suddenly realized, “Maybe Lan
Haixin and the others don’t have possession of the relic? Maybe
they didn’t bring it with them; the relic might have already been
on Planet Water Zone when they came here.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought some more, and he considered many details. He
thought to himself, “If that is what is happening, then Bai Yi’s
mother should have kept the relic. In that case, why didn’t Bai
Yi’s mother give the relic to her son? Based on the angry journal
entries on Bai Yi’s computer, he had no idea where the relic was.
But Lan Haixin did. This whole scenario makes no sense.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought some more, but he couldn’t find a reasonable
explanation for this. He eventually grew tired of the fruitless
line of thought, so he decided to roll with things and see where
his luck might take him. He would love to take the relic for
himself, but it would be fine if he couldn’t. It wasn’t his, after
all.</p>
<p>Following the guidance of that old Siren woman, Han Sen and the
others stopped near a mountain deep beneath the sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and looked around.</p>
<p>He was very familiar with this underwater mountain. The last
time he was here, he had been chasing the Move Mountain Sea Conch.
In fact, this was where he killed both the Move Mountain Sea Conch
and the Crystal God Conch.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had been on the left side of the mountain back then.
Now, he was on the right side of the mountain.</p>
<p>“The Crystal God Conch cannot be related to this relic, surely,”
Han Sen thought. He felt something very strange occurring.</p>
<p>Bai Yi had killed all of Planet Water Zone’s high-class
xenogeneics. This underwater mountain had two Kings and one
deified. That was definitely strange.</p>
<p>“My lady, it is okay.” The old Siren woman walked before a cliff
face and bowed to Lan Haixin.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin nodded and gave Bao’er to the female Siren guard.
Then she walked in front of the mountain and took the necklace off
her neck.</p>
<p>The necklace was simple: a red chain adorned with a blue stone
pendant. It wasn’t shiny like a gem, so it didn’t appear to be
anything too special.</p>
<p>If Lan Haixin hadn’t brought it out now, Han Sen would never
have known that it was important. He would have walked right past
it if it was lying on the side of the road. It was too
ordinary-looking to even draw the eye.</p>
<p>There was a small triangular hole in the mountainside, and Lan
Haixin slid the blue stone into it. The stone fit the small hole
perfectly. Then, a booming noise came from within the mountain.</p>
<p>The whole underwater mountain moved, revealing a dark path
beneath. Stairs led downwards, but when Han Sen tried to look down
them, he could only see blackness.</p>
<p>The seawater had been separated by some hidden force, too. The
path was dry.</p>
<p>The old Siren woman slowly headed down the stairwell, and Lan
Haixin brought Bao’er and the other Siren in with her.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and followed after Lan Haixin. He looked around
dubiously, feeling nervous about something unseen. He couldn’t
quite tell what was making him unsettled, though.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s instincts were reliable. Aside from his guesses
about whether or not he would receive a beast soul, his other
feelings were fairly accurate.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was feeling this unsettled, there had to be some
danger lurking in that place.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t yet detect any presences that shouldn’t have
been there. The stairs led down and down, as if they would never
end. The people shone like holy lights in the dark, but their
lights only lit up a small portion of the area around them. And
their lights didn’t penetrate far below.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked down the dark stairs, and he felt as if he was
walking into the hellish maw of some terrible beast.</p>
<p>Lilly was scared, and she stood as close as she could to the
blood kirin. She almost found herself hugging Han Sen’s legs. She
was usually scared of the blood kirin and stayed as far away from
him as she could. Clearly, the darkness scared her far more. Her
decision to stay that close to Han Sen and the blood kirin revealed
how frightened she really was.</p>
<p>In other circumstances, Han Sen already would have comforted
her. But he was disguised as Bai Yi. Bai Yi wasn’t a man who showed
compassion and concern for others, so he pretended as if there was
nothing to see.</p>
<p>The group moved silently. Han Sen wasn’t certain how long they’d
been traveling, but he figured it was at least eight hours before
they saw a light up ahead in the darkness.</p>
<p>“We’re almost there.” The old Siren woman looked happy, and she
moved a little faster.</p>
<p>The light grew brighter. After walking for another half hour,
Han Sen saw what was basking in the light. And what he saw shocked
him.</p>
<p>It was a crystal palace that looked like it had come straight
out of a legend. The whole palace was bathed in holy light and
mysterious clouds. It looked like something out of a dream.</p>
<p>When Han Sen and the others drew closer, they saw that the
crystal palace’s gate had a sign above it. It really did say
Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>Looking at the Crystal Palace, Han Sen felt rather nervous. His
heart jumped.</p>
<p>The Crystal Palace was entirely transparent, as if it had been
crafted from flawless crystals. He should have been able to see
straight through it, but clouds and strange sparkles of rainbow
light hung within the Crystal Palace. It was impossible to see what
lay within the palace.</p>
<p>The rainbow light caught Han Sen off guard. It looked like the
Crystal God Conch’s rainbow.</p>
<p>The crystal of the Crystal Palace looked like the material that
composed the Crystal God Conch’s shell.</p>
<p>“Is that just a coincidence?” Han Sen wondered, but he doubted
that.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen hesitated to continue forward. If the Crystal God
Conch was a xenogeneic from Crystal Palace, it was possible that
another deified xenogeneic might be inside, as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen glanced over at Bao’er and the little red bird atop
Bao’er’s shoulder. They didn’t seem concerned about the place, so
that put him at ease a little.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was thinking, the team came before the gate of the
Crystal Palace. And there, Lan Haixin looked at Han Sen. “Your
turn.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was startled. He didn’t know what Lan Haixin meant, but
he couldn’t reveal his confusion.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen kept looking at the gate of the Crystal Palace,
pretending to be lost in thought.</p>
<p>“You’re already here. What are you waiting for? Do you not trust
your mother? If she hadn’t set the Crystal Palace gate to only open
to your blood, I wouldn’t have accepted her request.” Lan Haixin
looked at Han Sen coldly. “Now that you know where the Crystal
Palace lies, are you really going to try to back out of our
deal?”</p>
