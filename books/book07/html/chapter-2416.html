<h3>Chapter 2416</h3>

<p>Han Sen had realized almost instantly that Falling Leaf wasn’t
an ordinary woman. She was very good at hiding her energy so that
the average person would be unable to discern her level, but Han
Sen had his Dongxuan Area. There was no way that Falling Leaf could
hide her King class power from him.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen couldn’t tell how many tiers she had unlocked,
she had definitely surpassed the first couple of tiers.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror is very generous. Falling Leaf must be a ranking
member in Spring Rain,” Han Sen thought, as he tried to come up
with a way to make her leave.</p>
<p>If Han Sen made her leave himself, that would draw unwanted
attention. It would also give Miss Mirror a clue to figuring out
what he really wanted. So, Han Sen couldn’t take action himself.
Instead of making her stay with them uncomfortable, and he would
need to treat her nicely. Bao’er, however…</p>
<p>“When it comes to making people miserable, Bao’er is a true
artist,” Han Sen thought, looking at his smiling daughter.</p>
<p>2“Sister Falling Leaf, can you play a game with me?” Bao’er was
holding a doll in front of Falling Leaf. Her big eyes made it look
as if she was desperately begging.</p>
<p>“Of course I can,” Falling Leaf replied, a smile softening her
cold face.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf was quite famous in Spring Rain. She was known as
“The Icy Femme Fatale.” Her calm, calculating mind made her an
amazing assassin. When she worked, nothing could shake her up or
throw her off her game.</p>
<p>Her greatest fight took place on a deified-owned planet. She
killed a half-deified elite, the son of a deified being, and they
all backed off her.</p>
<p>But facing a sweet little girl, even Falling Leaf’s mood seemed
a bit lighter.</p>
<p>She seemed happier than when she faced Han Sen, at least.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf didn’t know Han Sen was a fake prince, but even
believing that Han Sen was a real royal, she wasn’t interested in
him. She would hate the thought of dating a prince.</p>
<p>If not for Miss Mirror’s order, she wouldn’t have accepted the
mission that brought her here. She most certainly wouldn’t have
agreed to serve Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched Bao’er play with Falling Leaf and felt some
relief. He returned to his room to continue practicing,</p>
<p>After many attempts to turn Jadeskin’s self-universe cogwheel,
he was finally beginning to understand how it worked. He only
needed to hit a breaking point for it to reach King class.</p>
<p>Jadeskin was different from the Dongxuan Sutra. Han Sen could
actually see the Dongxuan Sutra’s self-cogwheel and all the other
universal cogwheels around it.</p>
<p>But when he used Jadeskin, the universal cogwheels all appeared
blurry. They weren’t as clear as they were with the Dongxuan
Sutra.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen tried many different methods in the hope of turning
the self-universe cogwheel. He had long since lost track of how
many attempts he had made. The self-cogwheel refused to budge,
however.</p>
<p>He only needed enough power to connect with the self-cogwheel.
Anyone could push universal cogwheels, and the number of cogwheels
they could push all boiled down to how much strength they had.</p>
<p>But ordinary Kings couldn’t actually see the universal cogwheels
like Han Sen could. They could get a vague sense of what they
needed to do, but they couldn’t tell it was actually a cogwheel
they were pushing.</p>
<p>And although Han Sen had initially thought that the number of
cogwheels someone had to push was directly related to their
strength, that wasn’t exactly true. There were some people who
didn’t push many universal cogwheels, but even so, they became very
powerful. Many such people existed.</p>
<p>The difficulty of reaching King class depended on the strength
of the initial cogwheel. If the self-cogwheel was strong enough and
you cast sufficient power, you could spin your self-cogwheel very
quickly. In so doing, you could equal the power of people who spun
many cogwheels just by spinning your single cogwheel at high
velocity.</p>
<p>Many Kings with one area power could unleash more power than
Kings with many area powers. That was the theory.</p>
<p>Jadeskin was a geno art that was very simple in the way its
power was used. The self-cogwheel didn’t have to push many
neighboring universal cogwheels, but that didn’t mean the
self-cogwheel was weak in itself.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was ready to become King class, he started off with
Dongxuan Area. With Dongxuan Area’s help, pushing other
self-cogwheels was easier. The ability allowed Han Sen to see the
Jadeskin cogwheel.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s self-cogwheel wasn’t much smaller than the Dongxuan
Sutra’s self-cogwheel. After all, they were the self-cogwheels that
were based on Han Sen’s body, so there wouldn’t be many differences
between them.</p>
<p>But the two cogwheels did look rather different. The Dongxuan
Sutra’s cogwheel was black, while Jadeskin’s was some sort of
translucent jade. It connected to seven universal cogwheels. That
number was fairly ordinary for an average King. Compared to the
Dongxuan Sutra, that was a tiny number of connected cogs.</p>
<p>But having a small number of connected cogs didn’t mean that
Jadeskin’s power couldn’t spread. The self-cogwheel would still
spin very quickly.</p>
<p>Under the Dongxuan Area, Han Sen slowly cast his Jadeskin, then
began shoving against his self-cogwheel to spin it. The progress
was now much easier than it had been when he was pushing the
Dongxuan Sutra’s self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>After all, Han Sen was King class now, so he had much more power
that he could throw behind his efforts.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>The translucent jade cogwheel slowly started to shift. As the
self-cogwheel spun, a weird flower symbol appeared on its
surface.</p>
<p>The flower symbol spread like a growing crystal, slowly sliding
over the self-cogwheel. As the cogwheel spun, the symbol swelled
more and more. A short time later, it had completely covered the
cogwheel. Jadeskin’s self-cogwheel became an ice moon.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s self-cogwheel pushed the other seven universal
cogwheels that connected to it. As it did, the symbol glided over
those universal cogwheels too. Then it spread further.</p>
<p>The icy, jade-looking area power spread through Han Sen,
becoming a strange sealing area. But after spreading for a while,
the power returned, heading back for Han Sen. His body absorbed all
of the power.</p>
<p>When the ice moon-like cogwheel spun, Han Sen’s entire body
crystallized, and he glowed like a crystal. He was like a god
wrapped up in holy light.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The cogwheel continued to spin as the universal core hall door
opened. Han Sen’s body was sucked into it. He entered the universal
core hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t hesitate. He landed atop the cogwheels of the
hall, and when the cogwheels moved, the hall’s door opened. Han Sen
exited the hall, finding himself in a new place inside the core
area. This wasn’t where he had been previously.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, leaving the core area would set a spawn point for
his return. He would be able to come back to the exact place he had
previously left.</p>
<p>But now that Han Sen was entering with his Jadeskin cogwheel, it
had taken him to a different location than where he would spawn
with his Dongxuan Sutra cogwheel.</p>
<p>“Does that mean I can go to different core areas with each
skill? I just need to change the self-cogwheel to determine which
place I access?” Han Sen realized joyfully.</p>
