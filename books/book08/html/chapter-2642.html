<p>When Han Sen placed the second drop of blood before the God
Spirit Touch, it didn’t behave any differently. It swallowed the
droplet, then returned to its previous, motionless state. The four
waited around for a long time, hoping something would happen. But
there the bug remained, at the bottom of the canister, not moving
an inch. If they hadn’t seen it swallow the blood, they would have
believed the insect to be dead.</p>
<p>The man frowned. He had no idea what was going on. He picked up
the God Spirit Touch again, trying to make sure there was nothing
wrong with it.</p>
<p>“Weird. No matter how bad his skills are, it shouldn’t be
possible for him to be entirely without an armor talent.” The man
continued to poke and investigate the creature, but he learned
nothing.</p>
<p>“Maybe the God Spirit Touch is simply too old, and it can no
longer shed its shell?” Exquisite paused, then went on to say,
“This God Spirit Touch is the very first God Spirit Touch that once
belonged to the alpha, is it not? It performed tests here for much
of the alpha’s life, and that was eons ago. Perhaps it really has
finally succumbed to old age.”</p>
<p>The man shook his head and said, “When Bixi brought Yu Shanxin
here, they conducted the test just fine. That wasn’t very long ago.
Why would it suddenly stop working now?”</p>
<p>“Well, aside from that, what other possibilities can you think
of? There is no way that Han Sen is lacking even a single armor
talent,” Exquisite said. The man knew that was impossible, too.
Without a four armor talent or above, reaching King class was
impossible. If Han Sen was already King class, no matter how bad
his talents were, he couldn’t have an armor talent less than four.
“This is weird,” the man said with queer hesitation. He put out his
finger and sliced it, releasing a thin trickle of his own blood. He
let it bleed near the God Spirit Touch’s mouth to see if the
creature reacted like normal.</p>
<p>The God Spirit Touch had been lying in the same spot ever since
consuming Han Sen’s blood. It didn’t react to the man’s blood, at
all. It was like it had become too old and numb to move a
muscle.</p>
<p>“It really is growing feeble in its old age?” The man put his
face close to the creature, staring at it in shock.</p>
<p>“It has lived long enough. It has lived longer than most
ordinary God Spirit Touches. Its aging was to be expected,
eventually,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>“We cannot conduct the test now,” the man said quietly. “I don’t
have another God Spirit Touch nearby. It looks like we will have to
go back and request another one. Then, we can take the test.”</p>
<p>“Stop testing him. I’ve decided to make him my silkworm, so it
doesn’t matter how what armor talent he has,” Exquisite said
icily.</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>The man started to say something, but Exquisite swiftly cut him
off. “I don’t have time for this. I can decide who I want to be my
silkworm, and look: I have made my decision.”</p>
<p>The man opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Eventually, he
smiled and said, “If you have made your decision to accept this boy
as your silkworm, then that is fine. In that case, let us proceed
to the altar.”</p>
<p>After that, the man led them the remainder of the way. They
continued on up the mountain.</p>
<p>When they reached the palace that rested on the mountaintop, the
man turned and said, “Exquisite, I will be waiting for you outside.
If you need anything, please just ask.”</p>
<p>“Second Brother, please take care of this child. I like this
child, so do not upset her,” Exquisite said while looking at
Bao’er. “Don’t worry, Exquisite. I will take care of her,” the man
quickly assured her.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, wait for me here, and don’t be a naughty girl. Okay?”
Han Sen put Bao’er down. With Bao’er’s personality and power, it
wouldn’t go well for the man if he tried anything.</p>
<p>“I’ll be very nice, dad,” Bao’er said, looking sweetly up at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen stroked her head and went to the hall with
Exquisite.</p>
<p>After they entered the hall, the hall door closed behind them.
Han Sen couldn’t see hide nor hair of anyone else in the hall.
There was an altar at its end, however, and the sight of it
prompted him to ask, “That Second Brother seems different from the
other people here.”</p>
<p>Exquisite continued walking toward the altar, but on her way,
she said, “The children of the Very High are separated into two
groups. One group suffers the Very High Sense, whereas the others
can practice the geno arts they truly fancy. Brother Bixi and I
studied the Very High Sense. Second Brother Liyu studied something
else.”</p>
<p>“Why do you have to be separated?” Han Sen asked with
curiosity.</p>
<p>Exquisite twitched slightly, but she pretended it was nothing.
“Practicing the Very High Sense gradually removes our ability to
feel emotions. That can harm our breeding capabilities.”</p>
<p>Now Han Sen understood why they had to be separated. It was so
their bloodline could continue. Otherwise, if all of the Very High
transformed themselves into emotionless machines, they probably
wouldn’t reproduce at all. The race wouldn’t have lasted very long
in that case.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his head. The altar ahead looked a bit strange.
There was a large platform that held a large furnace in its center.
Aside from that, the altar was bare.</p>
<p>“Put a drop of your blood into the furnace,” Exquisite said. She
held out her finger and dropped her blood into it. Han Sen had
known this was coming. Sky Palace Leader had told him what to
expect. He lifted his own finger and quickly supplied the furnace
with a drop of his blood.</p>
<p>When the jade furnace took in the two drops of blood, it lit up.
It began to glow with a shifting cosmic light, and something inside
the furnace began to rumble.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the jade furnace with curiosity. He couldn’t
see what was inside it, but the light and presence of the furnace
were enough for him to tell that it was stuffed with knowledge
about the universe.</p>
<p>As the light grew stronger, it began to gather on the carving on
the front of the furnace. The engraved symbols were shaped into a
rough triangle.</p>
<p>The light continued to shift restlessly, and the engraving
glowed brighter and brighter. And then, the light within the
furnace dimmed as it all rushed into the engraving</p>
<p>When the triangular symbol burned like a sun, Exquisite said,
“Put your hand against that symbol.”</p>
<p>“Which hand?” Han Sen asked with a blink.“It is up to you,”
Exquisite said. “Men go left, women go right. In that case, I will
use my left hand.” After that, Han Sen placed his left hand on the
triangular symbol.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he had pressed his hand against red hot
steel. Han Sen jerked his hand away, and when he did, the light on
the jade furnace’s engraving vanished. A shining triangle was now
branded on his left hand.</p>
<p>When the burning sensation disappeared, the triangle vanished as
well. Han Sen could no longer find any trace of it on his skin.</p>
<p>“Is that it?” Han Sen looked at Exquisite with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is done,” Exquisite answered with a nod.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that at this point, Exquisite should be able to
feel what he felt and read his mind. His mind should have been an
open book to her. So, he started imagining stuff to test it.</p>
<p>In a split second, Exquisite blushed and shouted, “Stop!”</p>
<p>“It looks like you really can read my mind,” Han Sen said while
looking at Exquisite.</p>
