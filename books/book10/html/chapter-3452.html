<p>Bao’er’s eyes looked cold. The little gold gourd in her hands was not going away. She coldly shouted, “Mother! Come back!”</p>

<p>Human King felt bad about this. He used rule powers to cloak the skies and then suddenly felt emptiness. Ji Yanran, who had been grabbed by him, had been sucked toward the gold little gourd with the magical spell chain that had kept her in wraps. Human King’s face changed. Let’s not say this was purely because of Bao’er’s power, but even Han Littleflower and Han Ling’er had beaten him up when they co-operated. He turned around, wanting to do nothing more than escape.</p>

<p>“Are you attempting to escape now? Isn’t that just a bit too late?” Bao’er grunted coldly. She used the little gourd to shine on Human King. Space suddenly started to swirl. A gourd was at the center of the swirl.</p>

<p>Human King gathered up universe power. He was unable to teleport away. The whole of space, all of its rules and orders, were disturbed by the presence of that gourd. Human King was unable to his own rules powers to move and shift things. He used his universe powers to fight back against the force of suction. No matter what he tried, he could not escape and fly away from the suck.</p>

<p>“Bad man! Where are you going to go now?” Han Ling’er shouted. Her body had combined with Han Littleflower’s holy spirit. She was going toward Human King, who was currently in space.</p>

<p>Bao’er’s little gourd power was weird. Her force of suction only seemed to work on Human King. It did not affect anyone else. Han Ling’er was not affected in the slightest, so she ran in front of Human King and gave him a big punch in the face.</p>

<p>Human King was not capable of beating Ling’er, who had Holy Spirit Protect keeping her safe. His body was trapped by the godly force of suction. Nothing he did granted him escape, so Ling’er punched him in the face.</p>

<p>Human King’s face twisted as his body leaned back. Because he had been sucked by the little gourd, he could not fly away. He had to remain precisely where he was. Ling’er was furious. A fist and a leg were moving. They beat against Human King as if he was a doll. He moved left and right in response. Bit by bit, the geno prototype armor shattered more and more as time went by.</p>

<p>Chaos was watching this unfold. She was frozen in sheer disbelief.</p>

<p>“What is going on? Why is her power no worse than this guy, who is half a step away from achieving Universe class or perhaps even better? Is this as far as a mixed human can go?” Chaos thought. Seeing that his god body was going to shatter, Human King was becoming very angry. After he consumed Qin Xiu, his power kept fading. Even the geno god base needed to be avoided. He did not expect his heirs would provide him with so much trouble. His heart jumped. Space around started to rumble. It was like there was a giant space tsunami. The whole of space in Space Garden created big space movements. Every substance and creature became distorted. Their bodies all became weird.</p>

<p>The area that had shaking space came out from a giant stone tablet. It was the geno tablet.</p>

<p>Seeing the geno tablet’s light spell spin, it was like a giant calculator was calculating something. All of the light symbols kept flickering across it.</p>

<p>Ever since the geno tablet had appeared, Human King, who had been restricted, had his spirit light glow brighter. Originally, it was just his hand that had a spirit body. With the buffing of the geno tablet, his body and the black crystal armor started to adopt a spirit-like appearance.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Human King and Han Ling’er punched each other. The former failed to shake off Han Ling’er, but it was not like before where he was getting dominated. Bao’er’s face changed. Human King’s body flew up. He escaped the gourd’s force of suction.</p>

<p>The geno tablet struck the Space Garden. All of Space Garden and space around looked as if it was under the pressure of the geno tablet. The creatures that were not yet Break World class were pushed down onto the ground by the geno tablet’s rule power. They were unable to move.</p>

<p>Han Ling’er attacked Human King again, but Human King’s spirit body was able to fight against Han Ling’er’s speed and power. It was becoming easier and easier to block. He was no longer suppressed by the violent Han Ling’er.</p>

<p>“Han Ling’er, come back!” Bao’er looked glum as she yelled at Han Ling’er.</p>

<p>Han Ling’er was very young. When she saw Human King was capable of blocking her attacks, she became a little scared. She heard Bao’er calling out to her, which was what prompted her to fall back.</p>

<p>“I am the leader of the geno tablet. I can suppress the entire universe. You have some power, but you do not have enough to defeat the likes of me.” Human King’s body was clad in the broken geno prototype armor. When he was a spirit, it recovered. It wrapped up Human King’s body to look like new.</p>

<p>“Human King is using the geno tablet’s power. It looks like he is going to be able to make that step.” Chaos was watching all of this unfold from afar. She was primarily concerned about the safety of Bao’er.</p>

<p>Human King was going to take that step any second now, but Bao’er only needed some fire. She could not really fight him.</p>

<p>Human King stood in front of the geno tablet as a sky full of god light protected his god body. People were able to see there were two bolts of lightning striking each other.</p>

<p>Bao’er’s eyes were filled with gold. She fired two gold lights at him. With Human King’s vision hitting her lights, two scary powers exploded between them.</p>

<p>Space collapsed. Time and light collapsed. It created a weird hole. It looked like it was there, but it was not there. It looked like a giant, empty hole.</p>

<p>“It is no wonder why this is God Chaos Party and the Geno Hall Leader’s heir. If you walk that step, I will have to fight you with my power.” Human King’s long purple hair went straight. It was flying with the black and grey universe power. The black and grey universe power started to turn purple.</p>

<p>The geno tablet and Human King’s power shone on each other. They were covered in purple light. It was like a mysterious tablet from ancient times was landing there.</p>

<p>When the power of Human King and the geno tablet changed, Human King’s geno prototype armor became like melting ice. It simply became juice that was absorbed by Human King’s body. Human King’s perfect god body was now on display in front of everybody. Every inch of his body was releasing a mysterious and powerful purple light. That light did not seem to fit in with the universe’s rules and order. It made the rules of the universe isolate from his body. It put Human King’s body in a blur. It did not look real. It was like a layer of matte glass.</p>

<p>“He walked that step.” Chaos’s heart jumped. Even though she knew this was going to happen, she was still nervous about it actually happening</p>

<p>With the old leader’s and her blood, combined with the aid of the geno tablet, it would be strange if he had not been able to take that last step.</p>

<p>What made Chaos sad was that Human King had great difficulty breaking through that step. Yet, Bao’er’s and Ling’er’s suppression was the catalyst for making him finally make that step. He made it.</p>

<p>His body was now looking weird. Human King was glowing with a mysterious and purple light. Bao’er could not help but frown. She looked at Human King and said to Littleflower, “Littleflower, let me use your holy spirit.”</p>
