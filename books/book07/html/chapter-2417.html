<p>Han Sen took a moment to look around, trying to place where he
was within the core area. He wasn’t in the mood to hunt core
xenogeneics at the moment. After he had confirmed his location, he
just returned to camp.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked out of his private room, then suddenly jerked to
a stop. Falling Leaf and Bao’er were staring each other down.
Falling Leaf’s face, meanwhile, was covered in paper.* She was
holding two cards, and she looked very serious.</p>
<p>Bao’er, on the other hand, was holding one card. She looked
gravely at Falling Leaf’s two cards.</p>
<p>“Which one should I choose?” Bao’er wondered, carefully
considering the decision. She pointed her finger, wavering between
the two cards in the other woman’s hand. It looked as if she had to
pick one out of the two.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw them, he knew Bao’er and Falling Leaf were
playing Old Man.</p>
<p>Old Man was very simple to play. One of the Jokers was removed
from a normal deck of playing cards, and then the deck was dealt to
the players.</p>
<p>Each player then removed all the pairs they could from their
hand. Once their hands only contained the cards that couldn’t be
paired, they took turns choosing cards from one another’s hands. If
a player chose a card that they could pair with one of their own
cards, the player could discard the pair. The winner was whoever
got rid of the Joker, which could not be paired, and discarded all
of their cards.</p>
<p>This was a game that Han Sen had played a lot with Bao’er in the
past. Because Han Sen was very good at this sort of prediction
game, Bao’er initially never won. But after they played for a
while, he stopped winning so often. Before long, Han Sen felt as if
he would never win another game. It took a lot of focus for him to
play with Bao’er, especially when he was doing his best to avoid
losing.</p>
<p>Eventually, he just stopped playing with Bao’er entirely, which
meant Bao’er could never exact revenge on Han Sen for all the times
he had beaten her. Bao’er had been angry about that for quite some
time.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was very adamant about not playing with her. He
never gave her the chance to exact revenge on him.</p>
<p>It was a game that was highly based on luck, judgment,
observation, and mind tricks. The Han family prided themselves on
their skill with the game, but Han Sen was no longer sure if he had
what it took to beat Bao’er these days.</p>
<p>Seeing Falling Leaf with a face full of paper, he could tell she
had lost badly. Bao’er’s face was very clean, and there was not a
single piece of paper on her.</p>
<p>As Bao’er’s hand moved slowly back and forth between the two
cards, Falling Leaf’s face displayed no emotion. But her heart
leaped in her chest with every movement of Bao’er’s hand.</p>
<p>She really did feel awful. In the beginning, she had only agreed
to play the game with Bao’er to make the child happy. A game like
this was too easy for a killer like her. She was excellent at
reading people, and her prediction abilities were phenomenal, of
course.</p>
<p>But in all the time since they had begun playing, she hadn’t won
once. Falling Leaf was rapidly growing rather desperate, and she
would have done anything to win at least once.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf’s eyes stared at the two cards in her hands.
Whenever Bao’er touched the Joker card, she felt good. When she
pointed at the seven of hearts, she felt very worried.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll pick this one?” Bao’er said. Her little hand reached
for the Joker card. Falling Leaf’s pulse quickened as Bao’er’s
fingers brushed the Joker card…</p>
<p>“Take it! Take it!” Falling Leaf was shouting madly in her
heart, but she didn’t allow her emotions to show on her face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Bao’er stopped. She turned and grabbed the seven of
hearts, and she smiled. “I think I am going to take this one.”</p>
<p>A muscle in Falling Leaf’s cheek twitched. Her fingers tightened
on the two cards as Bao’er tried to pull the seven of hearts loose.
Falling Leaf wouldn’t let it go.</p>
<p>Seeing that the woman was refusing to let the card go, Bao’er
didn’t know what to do. She let go of the seven of hearts and
picked the Joker card. “In that case, I will take this one.”</p>
<p>Falling Leaf was thrilled, and she released her clawlike grip on
the cards. Bao’er grabbed the Joker card and quickly said, “It is
my turn.”</p>
<p>Bao’er placed two cards in the deck and then brought out two
cards of her own. Facing Falling Leaf, she said, “Okay, it is your
turn to pick.”</p>
<p>Falling Leaf gritted her teeth and stared at the two cards. She
focused intently, as if she could read something from the back of
the cards.</p>
<p>As the top killer in Spring Rain, Falling Leaf’s powers of
observation and judgment were the best. She could easily pick up on
even the smallest difference.</p>
<p>She had just taken the Joker card, so it was possible that some
instinct deep within her would guide her to victory.</p>
<p>But God only knew what material was used to create those cards.
They were thin as paper, but she couldn’t sense any trace that
might identify the cards. She couldn’t tell what was on the
cards.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf’s eyes looked ready to pop out of her skull. She
couldn’t tell which one was the Joker card.</p>
<p>“Are you going to pick one or not?” Bao’er said with a yawn.</p>
<p>“What’s the rush?” Falling Leaf reached out her hand to pick the
card that was on the left. She looked at Bao’er, hoping to see some
sort of clue in her eyes.</p>
<p>“If that’s the one you want, then just take it,” Bao’er said,
her face bored.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf, hearing Bao’er say this, decided not to pick it.
They had only been together for two hours, but in Falling Leaf’s
eyes, Bao’er was no longer a small child.</p>
<p>“Trying to fool me, huh? It’s not that easy.” Falling Leaf
raised her hand to take the card on the right.</p>
<p>When she turned it around, though, she looked like she had been
struck by lightning. It was a Joker card.</p>
<p>“Why do you not just believe people? You adults are all so
complicated. I don’t understand you.” Bao’er looked sorrowful as
she shook her head.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf’s face twitched. She gnashed her teeth and said
nothing. She placed the card down behind her and drew two more
cards. She put them in front of Bao’er and coldly said, “Your
turn.”</p>
<p>“I pick this one.” Bao’er reached out her hand and picked up the
seven of hearts from Falling Leaf’s hands.</p>
<p>“Haha, I win again.” Bao’er threw down her pair of sevens. She
grabbed a piece of paper and stuck it on Falling Leaf’s face.</p>
<p>“We’re playing again!” Falling Leaf started to shuffle the
deck.</p>
<p>“I’m not playing. You are too weak for me.” Bao’er looked very
bored.</p>
<p>“Just one last time,” Falling Leaf said slowly, enunciating the
words. Her eyes looked ready to burst into flames.</p>
<p>Han Sen almost laughed. Playing that game with Bao’er was like a
death wish.</p>
<p>Bao’er rolled her eyes, looking like she really had no interest
in playing. She said, “We can play, but sticking paper on each
other’s faces is boring. Let us raise the stakes.”</p>
<p>“Sure. What would you like to bet?” Falling Leaf really wanted
to win. She was Spring Rain’s top killer. She couldn’t allow
herself to lose to a kid. She had to win.</p>
<p>“The loser has to go to the door and shout ‘I am stupid,'”
Bao’er said after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>“That…” Falling Leaf hesitated. She wasn’t entirely sure she
could defeat Bao’er, and many Spring Rain elites were nearby. It
would be embarrassing if she was heard.</p>
<p>“Never mind, then. This is lame, anyway.” Bao’er stood up and
got ready to go.</p>
<p>“Fine! We will do as you say!” Falling Leaf almost shouted as
she touched Bao’er’s arm. She was desperate to defeat her.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t watch. The game had ended before it even began.
Not even a deified being could beat Bao’er at this game. This was
what the Han Sen family was best at.</p>
<p>*Endnote: When a person loses a round, they place a sticker on
their face. This makes it obvious at a glance who is winning and
who is losing.</p>
