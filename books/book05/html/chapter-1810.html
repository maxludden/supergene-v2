	<p>Vic coldly hummed. “Without me holding its attention, what could you guys have done? I am the one who exerted the
		most effort in felling it, so I should get the first choice of the spoils. I want the rabbit teeth! You can have
		the rest.”</p>

	<p>“Mister Vic, do not be ridiculous!” Han Sen responded to Vic, his voice hard.</p>

	<p>“Ridiculous? In what way am I being ridiculous? Would you like to direct that question to my dagger, and see if
		it tells you how I’m being ridiculous?” Vic held up his dagger, its tip pointed at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen frowned. Vic thought the reason his dagger could not kill the rabbit was because the rabbit was too
		powerful. He did not have to worry about killing Han Sen, due to the equalized powers.</p>

	<p>An absolute hit on Han Sen, with the dagger, could easily kill Han Sen.</p>

	<p>“You! Get on the bridge!” Vic was still pointing the dagger at Han Sen as he shouted. He didn’t just want the
		xenogeneic material; he now wanted Han Sen to be bait.</p>

	<p>Han Sen remained still, though. He stood, looking at Vic emotionlessly.</p>

	<p>“Didn’t you hear me tell you to get on the bridge?” Vic looked at him darkly. He was not at all happy with Han
		Sen’s behavior, and so he approached him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not speak, and neither did he move. He silently watched Vic approach.</p>

	<p>“It looks like you aren’t afraid of death.” Vic was so angry, he swung his dagger at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had ignored his authority, and so he really wanted to teach the man a lesson. He wanted to injure Han
		Sen, and then toss him on the bridge.</p>

	<p>The strike was disturbingly invisible. The Sky-Demon powers were so very unpredictable, and Vic used them well.
	</p>

	<p>But in Han Sen’s eyes, it was nothing special. He wagered Zero and Han Yan were better with the Falsified-Sky
		Sutra than Vic was with the Sky-Demon Sutra.</p>

	<p>Vic put a fair amount of raw power behind the skill, but he had little talent with it.</p>

	<p>Yisha looked at Han Sen with interest. She was keen to see how Han Sen might handle a confrontation such as this.
		Sky- Demon powers were unpredictable, and not even she would dare challenge Vic. His attack should be impossible
		to evade.</p>

	<p>Yisha kept thinking that if she was Han Sen, the best thing she could take advantage of would be range. Vic’s
		power could not be released inside that place, so if he couldn’t use his sword to unleash the ability, then the
		skill ought to be useless.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen was not planning on falling back or anything of the sort. Despite seeing Vic’s dagger approaching his
		neck, he continued to stand where he was.</p>

	<p>“Is he not going to move? How is he going to deal with the Sky-Demon power? It is impossible to block or even
		dodge.”</p>

	<p>Yisha was really surprised.</p>

	<p>Vic felt like something was wrong as he attacked, though. He wondered why Han Sen made no effort to move, but he
		was still confident in his Sky-Demon power, and he carried on with his skill cast.</p>

	<p>Seeing the dagger about to hit his neck, Han Sen suddenly waved his arm to bring the scabbard up against the
		dagger. “Does that guy not know that Sky-Demon powers won’t miss? Does he really want to block it?” Hawk Wing
		looked shocked. Yisha only frowned. Vic was laughing coldly. He put even more strength behind the swing.</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>Vic’s confident strike was blocked a mere three inches away from Han Sen’s neck.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t even look at the dagger. He was staring at Vic the whole time, and yet, he managed to block the
		blade.</p>

	<p>“How is that possible!” These words ran through the minds of Vic, Yisha, and Hawk Wing all at the same time. Even
		when both parties had similar strength, it should have been impossible for Sky-Demon power to be blocked. And
		Han Sen had done so with such ease.</p>

	<p>Vic looked to be in shock. He struggled to believe what had happened. He didn’t want to believe what he had just
		seen.</p>

	<p>Vic clenched his teeth and started raging with his dagger. Like a hailstorm, he thrashed at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen just stood there the whole time, though, inside the violence. He waved his scabbard, the whole time
		looking at Vic and not his dagger. His scabbard was able to block each and every strike.</p>

	<p>All those strikes had not been enough to even make Han Sen move his feet.</p>

	<p>“What’s happening? Has Sky-Demon power lost its effectiveness here? How can it be blocked? Who is this guy?!”
		Hawk Wing screamed after breaking out of his reverie.</p>

	<p>Yisha looked at the scene with a confused expression, thinking, “Human? Dollar? What kind of race is this? How
		can I not have heard of people like this before?”</p>

	<p>Vic was extremely shocked. He never thought his Sky-Demon power could be blocked by someone on the same level as
		him. “Are you done?” Han Sen asked quietly.</p>

	<p>He took a step forward and waved his scabbard at Vic. The swordmind started up.</p>

	<p>Vic fell back, but it was too late. He tried to use his dagger to block, but he failed.</p>

	<p>Blergh!</p>

	<p>Vic felt as if his belly had just been hammered. Blood spilled over his lips, and his body fell backwards onto
		the bridge.</p>

	<p>Vic landed on the bridge, just as it started to shake. The geyser of milk fired from below.</p>

	<p>Vic ignored his pain and rolled forward to evade the white juice. But this time, the white juice did not wash
		away. It gathered up on the bridge, and as if it had a life of its own, it climbed towards him.</p>

	<p>Vic had dodged the liquid, but he hadn’t expected it to react like this. The white liquid touched his foot and
		was immediately absorbed.</p>

	<p>Han Sen, Yisha, and Hawk Wing were shocked. The white juice seemed like it was alive. It didn’t seem like a
		genuine liquid. Roar! Vic screamed. His muscles and bones began to expand, and a horn grew from his forehead.
	</p>

	<p>His handsome face suddenly took on the shape of a cruel demon’s. His fangs were on display, as a black miasma
		shrouded him. He took on the appearance of Asura.</p>

	<p>Vic slowly turned around. The purple had vanished from his eyes, and they were now red.</p>

	<p>Roar! There was more roaring. Vic was headed for Han Sen, as the demon-looking body came right before him. Five
		black nails, as sharp as daggers, came right for his head.</p>
