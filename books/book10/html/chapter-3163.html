<p>“Little Yin, you have made Little Auntie very sad.” Feng Fei
Fei’s eyes were so red that tears were about to flow.</p>
<p>God only knew what kind of trouble she had gone through to get a
God Spirit Blood-Pulse for Feng Yin Yin. The amount of effort she
must have put in could not have been described in words.</p>
<p>She had given up so much for Feng Yin Yin. Now, it was like
someone had poured a bucket of ice over her head. It felt
terrible.</p>
<p>If this was anyone else, it would have driven them insane. Feng
Fei Fei was handling it surprisingly well.</p>
<p>When Feng Yin Yin saw her Auntie looking the way she was, she
put out her hands and tried her best to explain. “Auntie, I am
sorry. I know you have tried your hardest for me, but the God
Spirit San Mu found is really good. It is better than Prophet
God.”</p>
<p>“No matter how good it is, can it be better than Prophet God?
Whatever. You have grown up now. You do not need me to watch over
you anymore.” Feng Fei Fei felt very depressed. If Han Sen had not
saved her life, she would have tried to kill him.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin’s eyes turned red too. She held Feng Fei Fei’s
hands and tried to explain what had happened. “Auntie, don’t do
this. It hurts me to see this. The God Spirit San Mu introduced is
really good. It is an Annihilation God Spirit.”</p>
<p>“An Annihilation God Spirit? Which one? What kind of Blood-Pulse
did you receive?” Feng Fei Fei could not completely stop looking
out for Feng Yin Yin. When she heard Feng Yin Yin had received an
Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse, some glimmer of hope was
regained.</p>
<p>Although it was not a sonic God Spirit, it was Annihilation
class. That made it not too bad. It was better than just finding a
random, low-class Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>“It was the one San Mu mentioned earlier,” Feng Yin Yin quickly
said. “It was that God of Wealth.”</p>
<p>When Feng Fei Fei heard about the God of Wealth again, she was
immeasurably disappointed. Out of the 12 Annihilation-class main
gods, there weren’t any that she knew of called God of Wealth.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to comfort me,” Feng Fei Fei said with a sigh.
“Whatever happened, happened. I cannot help you change your
Blood-Pulse. I guess staying angry is pointless.”</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin sensed that Feng Fei Fei did not believe her, so
she hurriedly tried to explain it to her. “Auntie, I am not lying
to you. God of Wealth really is an Annihilation God Spirit. It was
the main god of a god temple that blessed me. Even the sub-god of
that god temple was Annihilation class.”</p>
<p>“You’re joking. You’re being a bit too ridiculous now, don’t you
think? I told you that I wouldn’t be angry with you. But if you
continue to lie, I really will get mad.” Feng Fei Fei did not
believe her at all.</p>
<p>Out of the 12 Annihilation-class main god temples, there were
sub-gods, but there were not many. Sub-gods were usually Disaster
class. No God Spirit had a sub-god that was the same class as the
main god.</p>
<p>“Auntie, I am really not lying.” Feng Yin Yin didn’t know how to
explain it any better, so she just tried to be honest. “God of
Wealth and its sub-god are both Annihilation God Spirits. God of
Wealth gave me an inheritor Blood-Pulse.”</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei froze after hearing about an inheritor Blood-Pulse.
She did not believe it. An inheritor Blood-Pulse was not something
just anyone was able to get. Even a Destroyed-class inheritor
Blood-Pulse was rare. Many gene casters begged for it.</p>
<p>What Feng Yin Yin had said was too ridiculous. Feng Fei Fei
could not believe it. Ordinary God Spirits only chose one family to
give an inheritor Blood-Pulse. The 12 Annihilation God Spirits
already had their inheritors. They were royals or leaders. It was
obscenely rare to gain.</p>
<p>Han Sen whispered into her ear, “Yin Yin, show your God Spirit
mark to Feng Fei Fei. She will believe you,”</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin had been too pushy. She only recognized that now.
She quickly showed her God Spirit mark off.</p>
<p>A sparkling coin appeared in the middle of Feng Yin Yin’s
forehead. It was like a gold sun. The word “wealth” was on the
coin. It was shining with a miraculous god light.</p>
<p>A scary God Spirit presence enveloped the entire garden. On top
of that, there was the symbol of an Annihilation God Spirit
mark.</p>
<p>“It really is Annihilation class… Little Yin… Is this really an
Annihilation-class inheritor God Spirit Blood-Pulse?” Upon seeing
the symbol, Feng Fei Fei was as surprised and happy.</p>
<p>Just as Feng Yin Yin said, she had an Annihilation-class
inheritor God Spirit Blood-Pulse. This was incredibly good news.
This was many times better than what Prophet God could have given
her.</p>
<p>Prophet God was Annihilation class too, but he could only offer
Feng Yin Yin a perfect Blood-Pulse. He could not give her an
inheritor Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>An inheritor Blood-Pulse was very important. It did not just
benefit one person. The children and grandchildren would also have
this honor.</p>
<p>Even if Feng Yin Yin received Prophet God’s perfect Blood-Pulse,
it would only be good for her lifetime. Having an inheritor
Blood-Pulse meant all her children and grandchildren would benefit
just as much. Generations would be respected and treated like
nobles. The differences were incomparable.</p>
<p>While Annihilation class was unexpected, even a Disaster class
would have been an achievement. Even a Destroyed class inheritor
Blood-Pulse would have made Feng Fei Fei give up her life for Feng
Yin Yin to receive.</p>
<p>God Spirits did not pick their inheritors easily. Feng Yin Yin’s
talents and position were very rare. Even a Destroyed-class
inheritor Blood-Pulse would have been hard for her to get.</p>
<p>“Auntie, when have I ever lied to you?” Feng Yin Yin asked.
“This God of Wealth San Mu found me really is an Annihilation God
Spirit, and it gave me an inheritor Blood-Pulse. God of Wealth’s
sub-god is Annihilation class too. Now, I have the buffs of two
Annihilation-class authority god powers. One is wealth, and the
other is death sentence.”</p>
<p>The mark could only reveal that it was Annihilation class. She
could not properly prove if it was an inheritor Blood – Pulse. Feng
Fei Fei looked at Han Sen as if she wanted his confirmation.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. Feng Fei Fei felt shocked and happy, but she
still struggled to believe it.</p>
<p>This was a bit too against everything she knew. It was too hard
to believe. Feng Fei Fei’s heart jumped. She transferred her holy
phoenix to Feng Yin Yin.</p>
<p>Her holy phoenix was a god-class gene race. It was in ultimate
mode, but Feng Yin Yin was not the one who had raised it. If Feng
Yin Yin did not have an Annihilation-class inheritor Blood-Pulse
when Feng Fei Fei transferred it, Feng Yin Yin would have a hard
time controlling it.</p>
<p>“Little Yin, see if you can combine with the holy phoenix.” Feng
Fei Fei was as excited as she was nervous. She really hoped what
Feng Yin Yin said was real, but she was afraid of it being a
lie.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin accepted the holy phoenix. She summoned the holy
phoenix to combine with it.</p>
<p>The holy phoenix was very powerful. Under the powers of two
Annihilation-class God Spirits, it did not refuse or resist. It
allowed Feng Yin Yin to summon it and combine with it. It was done
very simply. It was like they had already done it a million
times.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin was afraid Feng Fei Fei that did not believe her.
She used the holy phoenix combination skill phoenix sound. When
Feng Fei Fei heard the sound and saw Feng Yin Yin use a holy sound
gene combination skill, her tears kept falling.</p>
<p>“Auntie, what is wrong? Have I not just performed it?” Feng Yin
Yin was shocked. She went to hold Feng Fei Fei.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei kneeled before Han Sen and said, “Mister Han has
done so much for the Feng family. Me and Little Yin have nothing to
pay you back with.”</p>
<p>Before she went to the floor, Han Sen reached out his hand to
stop her. “Me and Yin Yin were fated to meet. I have merely helped
her. This was my pleasure. Please, just don’t be mad that I made
this decision.”</p>
<p>“I was ignorant and blamed you by mistake. You can punish me and
make me do whatever you want me to do.” Feng Fei Fei blushed.</p>
