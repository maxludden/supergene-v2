<p>Many god plants were in Space Garden. One could not imagine it.
Han Sen did not know if this was the result of Space Garden itself
or if it had to do something with the entire geno universe
exhibiting such changes.</p>
<p>Han Sen remembered God Hall Leader told him that because his
fight against World King God was too destructive, the universe of
kingdoms and geno universe were affected. The universe of kingdoms
had an abundance of pulses and gene eggs appear. The geno universe
had changed too, but God Hall Leader did not elaborate. If this was
it, Han Sen never expected the changes to be so grand.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why have you come to Space Garden?” A young man
raised his sword at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the young man. He looked familiar, but he
could not recall where he had last seen him.</p>
<p>“Space Garden is a place I come and go to as I please. Who are
you, and who are you stop me?” Han Sen looked at the young man with
interest as he spoke</p>
<p>The young man was not human. He was like a young man who
belonged to the Sky. The Sky should have been in Sky Palace though.
Han Sen had no clue what he was doing in a place like Space Garden.
“I am a student of Space Garden’s Yu Wu Shuang,” the young man
coldly said. “I am patrolling Space Garden. You better not try and
fight back. Follow me back and explain how you have come to be
here.” “Sure,” Han Sen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Yu Wu Shuang had not expected Han Sen to comply nicely. He was
shocked, but he quickly reacted. He used a sword to point at Han
Sen and said, “Come on. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was led by Yu Wu Shuang to Space Garden’s base. As he
walked, he made sure to ask questions. “You are one of the Sky. Why
don’t you stay in Sky Palace to practice? What are you doing in
Space Garden?”</p>
<p>Yu Wu Shuang raised his head and looked proud. “Space Garden is
the geno universe’s first sacred place. Mister Dollar used to
practice here. Many people in the universe wish to study in this
place. They want to feel Mister Dollar’s glory, but they cannot.
Sky Palace is good friends with Space Garden, so only a few people
can come here to study. I beat out many other competitors to come
and study here.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Han Sen noticed that Space Garden was no longer like it
used to be.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it was right. Even though he had not been there,
Littleflower was still around. He then thought about Xie Qing King,
Gu Qingcheng, and the others. In his absence, the people from the
sanctuaries had undoubtedly developed quite a bit. It would have
been pretty silly if Space Garden had not become famous.</p>
<p>“Aside from Sky Palace, are there students from any other races
coming to this place?” Han Sen asked. This was not a secret. It was
something everyone in the universe would have known. Thus, Yu Wu
Shuang was able to easily answer. “Of course. Everyone knows
Dollar’s name in the universe. Although Mister Dollar is gone,
Mister Fei and the other elites are still around. We’re not talking
about ordinary races here. Even if the super-rich races want to
send their kids to Space Garden for practice, they must adhere to
the extremely hard conditions set in place by Space Garden. No race
is able to come in whenever they wish to. Aside from the Sky,
Rebate and a few other races can come. For all other races, coming
to study here is an exceptional privilege and task.” Han Sen was
surprised. He soon realized who the Mister Fei he was talking about
was. It was obviously his son, Han Fei. He had been calling him
Littleflower for so long that he had forgotten his original
name.</p>
<p>When he heard Littleflower’s name, he still didn’t react.</p>
<p>Yu Wu Shuang looked cocky as he said, “I am Mister Fei’s
student. I follow Mister Fei’s guidance for practice.” “Where is
Han Fei now?” Han Sen asked with a smile. Littleflower was not that
old. He would not have been much bigger than Yu Wu Shuang, yet he
was already taking students. It made Han Sen think Wu Yu Shuang
was, in some way, his grand-student.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking so many questions? Just follow me.” Yu Wu
Shuang looked alert as he spoke to Han Sen.</p>
<p>It looked like Yu Wu Shuang was very territorial. When it came
to aspects of Space Garden, he stopped talking.</p>
<p>In Space Garden’s base, Han Sen noticed it was now many times
bigger. It looked like a massive city. The opulence on display was
not unlike the capital of the Extreme King.</p>
<p>He saw all kinds of creatures traveling around the place. Han
Sen looked around and saw many familiar faces. Many humans and
creatures from the sanctuaries were there. There were even many
spirits.</p>
<p>“It looks like Littleflower brought over many humans, creatures,
and spirits to this place from the sanctuaries,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>The only other person who was able to go in and out of the
sanctuaries was his son, Littleflower.</p>
<p>At the door of the base, two people were standing guard. One of
them was obviously from the Extreme King, and the other was
obviously from the Very High. They were similar to Wu Yu Shuang.
They were young men, so he thought they were also students who had
been sent there to practice. The Extreme King young man pointed at
Han Sen as he asked, “Yu Wu Shuang, who is he?”</p>
<p>“While I was patrolling, I noticed this invader slip inside,” Yu
Wu Shuang said. “I am going to take him to see Mister Tang.” The
Extreme King young man coldly said, “Outsiders cannot be taken to
the city. Make him stay here. In the meantime, I will contact
Mister Tang.”</p>
<p>Han Sen quietly watched the Extreme King young man bring out a
communicator to contact the person he wished to contact. He then
heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>“What? Did you say an outsider tried to invade Space Garden?
Watch him! I am coming over at once. I want to see who was powerful
enough to breach our Space Garden.” The voice was abruptly cut
short.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard a ping in Tang Zhenliu’s voice.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Extreme King young man and said, “Looking
at your face, you look rather familiar. Are you related to Bai
Wanjie?”</p>
<p>“How dare you say my father’s name aloud,” the Extreme King
young man said. He was furious.</p>
<p>“Bai Wanjie is your father, and you call him a king,” Han Sen
said with shock. “So, he was the one who took the throne for the
Extreme King.” “My father took the throne,” the Extreme King young
man coldly said. “Everyone knows that. Are you trying to troll me
or something stupid like that?”</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. He had been away from the geno universe
for two years. It seemed as if many things had happened in his
absence. Since this Extreme King prince went to Space Garden to be
a guard, it seemed as if the reputation of Space Garden in the
universe had become very high. “What is happening here?” A female’s
voice sounded out from the city as a woman wearing green clothes
walked out.</p>
<p>The woman started to question Yu Wu Shuang, but her eyes opened
wide when her vision landed on the presence of Han Sen. Her eyes
turned red. She was unable to believe who it was. It looked as if
tears were going to fall any second. “You…” The woman was only able
to speak one word before stopping. “Exquisite, long time no see.”
Han Sen smiled and waved at her. He was surprised too. The Very
High Exquisite was in Space Garden.</p>
<p>“You… You are back…” Exquisite’s eyes had tears start to fall.
She had this overwhelming feeling of wanting to leap into Han Sen’s
arms. When she moved forward, she stopped. Her voice was a bit
shaky.</p>
