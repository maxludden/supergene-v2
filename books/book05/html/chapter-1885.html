<h3>Chapter 1885</h3>

<p>The gold fountain unleashed a gold light. The gold light
descended on Guna and Guya, quickly repairing their ravaged bodies.
When Giant King witnessed this, he ran to the fountain and threw
his hands into the water to try and absorb that same power.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Giant King cried. The spring water was like a corrosive
acid on his hands.</p>
<p>The water was good for Guna and Guya, but it was deadly for
Giant King.</p>
<p>Guya coldly looked at Giant King and said, “I told you that this
is Gana’s Heaven. For you, this place is nothing short of hell.
Only the Gana have power here, and can receive the boons bestowed
by their goddess. We are practically invulnerable. All your power
is stripped, so you are little better than an ordinary
creature.”</p>
<p>After that, she smiled and went on to say, “It is in thanks to
you lot that we are here, of course. Even if we had tried to use
our own blood, we wouldn’t have made it here alone.”</p>
<p>“Is this Purgatory Heaven’s Heaven?” Buddha King frowned.</p>
<p>Yes. Outside is purgatory, and here is heaven,” Guya said.</p>
<p>“I have heard heaven is in the clouds. Why is it here? We
arrived here through a slipspace crack, which we broke open!” Gold
Jade King said.</p>
<p>“The ‘slipspace crack* was just a lie that we created about
Purgatory Heaven. The gold clouds outside are just a path that can
take you to purgatory, through the statue. The clouds won’t kill
you, but you can be killed in heaven—by someone with power, of
course.” Guna said this, and then punched Giant King in the
head.</p>
<p>The strong Giant King was sent soaring. After his descent, he
rolled violently until he came crashing into a wall, coughing up
blood.</p>
<p>Giant King stood up in a fury. He was a King who had never been
humiliated before, and he really wanted to fight back. Before he
could straighten himself up, though, Guna came forward and punched
him again. This time, he went flying into the clouds.</p>
<p>Guya did not join Guna, and she simply walked to the palace near
the fountain.</p>
<p>Not long after, the clouds rumbled. Many clouds rose, and they
each looked like a cage. Many creatures were inside them, and Giant
King was one of them.</p>
<p>Han Sen now learned that the creatures that were trapped here
were the ones who had been zapped by flying into the clouds. He
knew Guya wasn’t lying, as all of those creatures were here.</p>
<p>They had been trapped in the clouds, and while they had not
died, they most certainly weren’t free. Death was still an
inevitability for them, though.</p>
<p>Many clouds came towards the palace. Han Sen saw that the clouds
that flew there housed Gana.</p>
<p>Han Sen counted their numbers, and he noted that most of the
Gana were here now. Han Sen tallied thirty or forty. It seemed as
if they had planned to be captured, all so they could end up
here.</p>
<p>It was the same for the other creatures who had been trapped by
the clouds. They couldn’t get out on their own.</p>
<p>But now, things were different. The clouds were supported by
some phantom power. The Gana were sent to the palace, and the
clouds faded from sight. They were free now.</p>
<p>The Gana were so happy, and they all bowed to Guna. They then
proceeded to speak their own language, which was one that Han Sen
did not understand.</p>
<p>“Throw them all in the clouds. They deserve it,” Guna said
angrily, pointing at the Kings.</p>
<p>The Gana headed towards Gold Jade King and the others. They
could not use geno armor, so they were pretty much worse than the
average commoner. And while they had skills, they did not have the
power to make use of them. Quickly, they were taken to the sea of
clouds.</p>
<p>“Hey! Hey! We are together!” One Gana approached Han Sen and
tried to take them, too. Wang Yuhang was quick to shout. He even
turned to Guna and said, “Guna, we meant you no harm. We went
through all that together. Doesn’t that make us friends?”</p>
<p>Guna looked at Wang Yuhang, and then Han Sen, and said with a
venomous tone, “You guys are not nice people, either. Get
moving.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew he had kidnapped Guna, which hadn’t made her very
happy. She wouldn’t consider him a friend.</p>
<p>“You guys are not loyal at all.” When Wang Yuhang saw the Gana
approaching, he started to tread backwards.</p>
<p>“This is pointless. Let’s just jump!” Han Sen made it sound
easy. He was, of course, referring to a jump into the clouds.</p>
<p>Han Meng’er and Dragon Lady jumped without thinking. Icebird
Duke didn’t fancy getting hit, so she did so, too.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang didn’t think there was another way out of there, so
he jumped as well.</p>
<p>Not long after, they found themselves floating inside the
clouds. They were trapped inside them.</p>
<p>Giant King and Gold Jade King were in a similar situation. This
Heavenly power of imprisonment was scary. Aside from the Gana, no
King could escape. It was likely only a deified being would be able
to break the chains that bound them.</p>
<p>Guya walked out of the palace. Her hands were clutching a piece
of golden jewelry. Han Sen couldn’t tell what it was, but Guya
could use the power of the gemstones to control the clouds.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat in his cloud, watching Guna and the others. He
wasn’t going to just sit there, of course. He was going to figure a
way to sort all this out.</p>
<p>In Gana’s Heaven, all powers other than the Gana’s were
suppressed. Even Ghost Teeth Knife had no power. He could not
summon geno armaments, either.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had one thing that wasn’t restricted: the Knife
Blank that was currently in his hand. There was still a strange
power inside it. Aside from the Knife Blank, Han Sen also felt a
power inside him that was not restricted.</p>
<p>Guna and Guya were at the edge of the palace. They looked at the
people they had imprisoned, and their gazes were looked. It looked
like they wanted to murder their prisoners.</p>
