  Han Sen moved like a shadow, and Barr’s slashing bone knife was unable to strike him. Han Sen couldn’t counter Barr’s strength directly, so he had to remain fleet of foot. Even blocking one of those blows with his Ghost Teeth Knife would damage him a great deal.

“Barr is getting stronger!” Qing Li had finally seen the problem that Han Sen was having. Barr’s increase in strength was becoming obvious to all of the onlookers. And Han Sen’s power remained what it was, not increasing at all.

After the power increase, Han Sen was suppressed. All he could do was keep dodging. He couldn’t fight Barr anymore.

Qing Li became very worried that there might not be a ceiling to Barr’s increase of strength. Even if Han Sen used all of his power, if he couldn’t avoid Barr’s strikes, he could be killed in one shot.

A Destroyed Duke laughed and said, “Barr is invincible against those who are of the same level as him. And Han Sen is only a Marquise. He might be strong, but a Marquise is just a Marquise. He’s offended Barr, so death is his fate, now.”

Han Meng’er, Zero, and Little Angel were watching intently. They hadn’t said a word thus far. It was usually a noisy affair when women got together, but the three of them weren’t the fondest of speaking. So, none of them said a word as they watched.

Little Silver and Little Star were standing with them. They, too, watched quietly.

“Up.” Han Sen suddenly leaped upwards and used his knifetip to press forward. A purple knife silk appeared in the air, thinner than a strand of hair. Barr was trapped and tangled up inside the knife silk. He was no longer able to move.

Barr’s fire was still growing. He looked at Han Sen with eyes full of rage. His motionless body began to expand, but he couldn’t sever the incredibly soft yet durable knife silks. The knife silks dug into his flesh, making the man bleed profusely all over.

Barr laughed. He cared nothing for the wounds he was incurring. He fought back with all his strength, laughing the entire time. And then, there was a katcha! He exerted too much strength, and the knife silks cut him to pieces.

But, a second later, those broken limbs were reconnected once more. Barr was standing again, and his body looked even scarier now.

This guy is pretty hard to deal with. I could totally annihilate his body with Super Spank, but I really shouldn’t use it with so many people watching.” Han Sen frowned. His mind raced for a way to get rid of Barr.

Barr was powerful, and the Destroyed said Barr was the strongest Duke.

Han Sen did not believe the man was invincible, though. Perhaps Barr was the best out of the Destroyed, but Han Sen did not believe that any random genius in the geno universe could overwhelm his power. Especially not someone who was a Duke.

The bodies of the Dragon were strong and powerful. This was especially true of the King class ones. Barr’s body might have been powerful, but not to a degree that elicited fear. His power was limited, and that was why he had been forced to escape from Dragon One. There was nothing to suggest he was actually invincible.

“Thank you…” Barr crooned. “Thank you so much. Thank you for letting me enjoy such a delicious fight… The moment I kill you will be the best moment of my life!”

Barr was crazy. Every strike carried an endless murderous presence.

Many black and red knife flames rose in the air, crossing over each other. Every scrape across the ground left behind a large knife mark.

Barr’s power and speed were better than any others of the same level. It was likely only a small handful of Dukes that had what it took to fight him now.

“So strong!” Han Sen complimented his enemy. He also had to admit that if he did not make use of Super Spank, defeating his opponent would be impossible until he was a Duke.

Blowing him into pieces via Break Six Skies would be a futile endeavor, as well. The enemy would survive, and end up even stronger.

By the way Barr was getting stronger, Han Sen could guess that Barr was using his own injuries for power. The harder Han Sen struck him, the stronger he became.

But he could also tell that the power Barr had absorbed from him wasn’t permanent. If it was permanent, Barr wouldn’t have been damaged so easily upon their first encounter.

When he first saw Barr, Han Sen noticed that his power was not all that higher than the average Duke. He was nothing special amongst them.

But right now, Barr was ranking amongst the best of the Dukes. To continue fighting this way would only give him even more strength.

“It is useless. No matter how hard he tries, Han Sen is going to die.” Many of the Destroyed were smiling. If Barr could kill Han Sen, it’d be a notable boost for the Destroyed.

Han Sen could not kill his enemy, and neither could he risk injuring him. He was getting pretty desperate.

“Die!” Barr’s bone knife kept on swinging. The power it carried was enough to sunder mountains. It struck Han Sen’s head.

The bone knife met no resistance, and it went clean through Han Sen’s head. Then, Han Sen’s body exploded like a water balloon. It was another one of his Moon doppelgangers.

The real Han Sen was now standing right next to Barr. His hair was close enough to touch Barr’s face.

Han Sen smiled at Barr, and he said, “You are strong. Unreasonably strong. I cannot kill you.”

“But of course, I am going to kill you.” Barr swung his knife with the aim of cutting Han Sen in half.

Han Sen moved as smoothly as the wind, while Barr’s bone knife whistled through the air after him. But there was still a distance between the knife and Han Sen. It felt as if some invisible waves were enabling Han Sen to evade the bone knife.

“I cannot kill you, but I can still beat you!” Han Sen laughed.

“I think he is crazy. If he cannot kill Barr, then how can he defeat him?” A Destroyed Duke grunted repeatedly.

As this was happening, Han Sen raised a pistol with the word “Spell” scrawled across it. He aimed it at Barr’s body and pulled the trigger.

Pang!

A bullet whizzed out of the gun and struck Barr’s forehead.

The bullet hit Barr’s forehead and disintegrated into dust. It left a red mark and a spell behind.

“This skill again? I have told you already, and I can tell you again: your sealing powers won’t work on me while I have my chaos powers.” Barr looked at his foe with disdain and roared. He used his knife to try to attack Han Sen again.

But after he brought his knife up, his faces went blank. A light sheet of ice began to seep from his forehead, and it started to spread across his entire body. Before he could wipe it away, his body was completely frozen. He looked like an ice statue, sculpted into the shape of a person about to strike.
