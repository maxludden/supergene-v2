<p>The universe was dead silent. All of the creatures were watching
Dollar stroke Golden Growler’s head. They could not believe it was
the same Golden Growler who had scared off Very High Leader.
“Little Mountain… Little Mountain Leader… What is it doing?” The
green-haired beast’s jaw nearly dropped to the floor. After he
realized what was going on, he madly stomped his feet and screamed,
“How dare he touch Little Mountain Leader’s head! I am going to
destroy his dirty fingers.”</p>
<p>The woman nearby had only just realized what was going on. She
looked at the green-haired beast seriously and said, “When you
brought Little Mountain Leader back, it already had a lower-race
companion. Was that low-race person Dollar?”</p>
<p>“No, it was a crystallizer. He was of a different race to this
xenogeneic. There is no way it was this guy who could level up so
quickly. But…” The green-haired beast hesitated.</p>
<p>“But what?” the woman asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“That crystallizer is now quite famous in the universe,” the
green-haired beast said. “It was Han Sen, who is in Space Garden
now.”</p>
<p>“Han Sen?” the woman asked with shock. After a deep thought, she
said, “It’s him!”</p>
<p>Right now, the universe was all messed up. The two of them were
not able to speak anymore. They had not expected things to take
such a drastic turn.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Why does Golden Growler look like Dollar’s
pet?”</p>
<p>“Dollar… Golden Growler… They must have some sort of connection.
I should have thought about that.”</p>
<p>“No way! The geno god list’s No. 1 is Dollar’s pet?”</p>
<p>It was not just ordinary creatures feeling this way. Even the
old antiques, who had hidden away in the dark, and the higher races
all had strange expressions.</p>
<p>The woman in Sky Palace was also shocked. “Who is this Dollar?
Empty Mountain’s Golden Growler is treating him like this… The
Growlers were always very cruel and cold. They never got close to
outsiders.”</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader thought, “Dollar is very special. He has a god
personality armament, law power, and a relationship with Golden
Growler. I wonder what faction created such a person.”</p>
<p>In the Extreme King garden, God watched Han Sen and Golden
Growler with great interest. “I did not expect you to be this
interesting. You have surpassed my expectations. This was certainly
not a wasted trip.”</p>
<p>Golden Growler’s claws came off of Han Sen’s shoulders. It
opened its mouth and spat something into Han Sen’s hands.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked it up and had a look. It was a crystal body that
had been generated by thunder. It looked like countless lightning
bolts were broiling around inside it. It was like a mini thunder
universe.</p>
<p>“Is this Ancient Thunder God’s Ancient God Origin?” Han Sen
recognized what he had been given. He already had Ancient Water
God’s origin. It looked very similar. It was just this new one was
a thunder element whereas the other one was water-based.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Little Gold Gold growled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Little Gold Gold had a special connection similar to
Little Angel. They were Han Sen’s beast souls. Their bodies had
been rebuilt to become genuine lifeforms that existed
independently. Yet, they still had a connection to Han Sen, who
could understand their thoughts. Little Gold Gold had recognized
Han Sen because of that connection.</p>
<p>Little Gold Gold was saying he wanted to give Han Sen the
Ancient Thunder God Origin so he could pass it on to Little Silver.
He said it would help Little Silver a lot.</p>
<p>“So, this was not for me, after all?” Han Sen felt a little
touched. He had not expected Golden Growler to remember Little
Silver. He reached out his hand and stroked its head.</p>
<p>In the eyes of others, this scene had them seeing Golden Growler
merrily swinging its tail like a hunting dog having captured prey
to give to its master.</p>
<p>“Oh my God… Dollar can’t actually be Golden Growler’s master,
can he?” “If things are really like that, then that is too scary. A
pet has suppressed the whole universe and claimed the No. 1 spot on
the geno god list.”</p>
<p>“It really does seem like things are that way.”</p>
<p>Empty Mountain’s green-haired beast was as mad as a lunatic. He
kept stomping around. He wanted to kill Dollar and 180 of his
generations.</p>
<p>“You should go now. I will look for you in Empty Mountain.” Han
Sen patted Golden Growler on the head and allowed it to exit the
space battleground. In that way, Golden Growler was able to keep
first place.</p>
<p>Golden Growler shook its head and growled. Han Sen knew what he
meant. Golden Growler was going to give first place to Han Sen. Han
Sen was going to reject it, but Golden Growler growled at him and
lowered its body. It wanted Han Sen to ride him.</p>
<p>“Dollar! How dare you!” The green-haired beast yelled. It was
like a volcano eruption. He slapped the floor, making Empty
Mountain shake. Every other creature reacted by falling to the
ground in fear.</p>
<p>Everybody was watching Han Sen ride Golden Growler’s back.
Suddenly, Golden Growler ripped space and exited the geno god list.
“What is going on? Why did they leave the space battleground
together? Who lost?” All of the audience was in shock. They had no
idea what was going on.</p>
<p>“Quick, look at the geno god list. Dollar is on top. It looks
like Dollar won. No… Dollar won…” People started talking nonsense.
Everybody turned to look at the geno god list. The geno god list’s
top place was now showing Dollar instead of Golden Growler, which
had taken Han Sen’s previous position of No. 25.</p>
<p>“Dollar… He is awesome. He let his pet get first place so he
could be given it back…”</p>
<p>“If you have what it takes, you can have a Golden Growler for a
pet.”</p>
<p>“I think only Dollar has what it takes to do that. In the
universe, there is no other Golden Growler.”</p>
<p>While everyone was talking, Golden Growler took Han Sen out of
the geno god list. They did not teleport back to where they were.
They were nearby in space floating next to the geno god list.</p>
<p>“y.</p>
<p>Everyone was wondering why Golden Growler and Han Sen had not
teleported away. Suddenly, Golden Growler roared to the sky. Its
body had a golden light that was like a flood. It went into the sky
to tear up space. Under Golden Growler’s power, space had a crack.
An old, godly temple appeared. It was the geno hall. “What is going
on? I do not think the geno god list fights are over yet. Are they
giving out the prizes already?” “Prize your ass. Did you not see
Golden Growler rip space and summon the geno hall? They are going
to the geno hall.”</p>
<p>“Holy shit! They are going to the geno hall? Can he do that?
Ancient Water God failed not too long ago.”</p>
<p>“It gave Dollar first place. It gave up the chance to become a
God Spirit. The only chance to become a God Spirit is to enter the
geno hall. That is expected.”</p>
<p>When the geno hall descended, the whole universe felt like it
went dim. Only the geno hall was shining with holy light. It was
slowly coming out from space.</p>
