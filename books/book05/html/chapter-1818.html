	<p>“Thank you, My Queen.” Han Sen’s eyes felt wet She had been really helpful, and even given a precious gift to her
		enemy.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought that if she found out he was Dollar, she’d be so angry that she’d most likely stroke out and die.
	</p>

	<p>Seeing Han Sen look so grateful, she misunderstood. Her attitude softened, and she went on to say, “If you heed
		what I say and take me for your proper teacher, you will become a Duke in three years. With some luck, there is
		a chance you might one day become a King.”</p>

	<p>But as for Han Sen’s current condition, Queen didn’t say much. And the only reason she said three years was due
		to the instability of Han Sen’s body. Otherwise, it would not have taken that long.</p>

	<p>“Anyway, drink this geno fluid that once belonged to a Magnet Fruit. And then, practice your geno arts. Focus on
		evolving for a second time first. It does not matter whether you become a Noble or a xenogeneic; I will take
		care of you. You will not become a mindless monster.”</p>

	<p>Yisha sounded confident</p>

	<p>“Yes, My Queen.” Han Sen did not say anything more. He just opened the bottle and drank its contents.</p>

	<p>He was familiar with the smell, and he had many Magnet Fruits at home. He was planning to eat one and see if he
		could evolve. He didn’t expect Yisha would go to such lengths and provide him with the juice. So, he spared no
		time in necking it down.</p>

	<p>When Yisha saw Han Sen do it so quickly, she smiled even more.</p>

	<p>Han Sen chugged the geno fluid that contained Magnet Fruit, and then, he felt a weird power soar into his limbs,
		rejuvenating his cells. Han Sen cast The Story of Genes, and then his Spell armor appeared. The geno fluid had
		become a raw power that was absorbed by the armor.</p>

	<p>Yisha sat where she was and waited for the result of Han Sen’s evolution. If Han Sen became a xenogeneic, and his
		will was lost to the lust for killing, she could recover his will and sense.</p>

	<p>After a while, Han Sen’s energy started to roll downhill. But still, she hadn’t seen Han Sen evolve a second
		time.</p>

	<p>“How can that happen? Did I bring him the wrong ingredient? Maybe that wasn’t the geno fluid.” Yisha frowned and
		sniffed the bottle, and then she went on to think, “This is the Magnet Fruit! Why did he not evolve a second
		time?”</p>

	<p>Yisha saw Han Sen’s energy had weakened and become normal again.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt depressed about it, too. This was his second time trying to evolve using The Story of Genes, and he
		had failed this time, as well.</p>

	<p>“I am sorry, My Queen. I have failed.” Han Sen opened his eyes and looked at her apologetically.</p>

	<p>“It’s fine. You failed only once.” Yisha called for a guard to bring her another bottle. Then, she continued by
		saying, “Try again. After the first failure, this is sure to succeed.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, My Queen. I will succeed.” Han Sen accepted the second bottle and spared no time in drinking it all.</p>

	<p>Yisha looked fairly unconcerned, but on the inside, it was a different story. She felt awful. Magnet Fruit was
		not something you could buy at a streetside market. They were very expensive, and they were items coveted by
		many.</p>

	<p>And it wasn’t just commoners, either. Even many of the high races, who were unlucky enough to have babies that
		weren’t born Nobles, wanted it.</p>

	<p>So, treasures like Magnet Fruit could be very expensive to obtain. And there were times when they were completely
		unavailable for purchase. Even someone like Yisha did not have many to her name, and she would have much
		preferred to save them.</p>

	<p>Ordinarily, one bottle of such geno fluid was all that would be needed for success. Failure was abnormally rare.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen downed the second one, and that weird power manifested once more. The power surge was stronger than what
		he experienced the last time.</p>

	<p>“Such powerful energy! This is far greater than a Baron. He must certainly succeed this time.” Yisha started to
		feel relieved. After a while, Han Sen’s geno armor showed no sign of responding. It didn’t look as if it was
		going to melt at all.</p>

	<p>After a while. Han Sen’s energy started to dip. And that meant another failure.</p>

	<p>“My Queen, I am so sorry.” Han Sen felt embarrassed. He didn’t know why his Spell armor kept on failing.</p>

	<p>Yisha’s eyes were twitching. And as she looked at Han Sen, she asked, “What geno arts have you practiced? Let me
		see.”</p>

	<p>The fact that he had drunk two geno fluids without success led Yisha to believe there was a serious problem with
		him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen made no effort to hide anything, and he just told her, “I did not write my geno arts down, but I can show
		it to you.”</p>

	<p>Yisha nodded, and Han Sen read it out slowly. He himself believed there was a problem somewhere, as failure was
		not something he often experienced. Han Sen could not tell what the problem was, though. Yisha, being a
		semi-deified being, might be the one to help him through the slump.</p>

	<p>Han Sen only read out a little when Yisha’s face looked glum. She asked coldly, “Who taught you this?”</p>

	<p>“No one. I bought it out in the markets. It seemed fairly powerful, so I decided to study it” Han Sen was shocked
		by the sudden question. She looked as if she knew something about it.</p>

	<p>In disbelief, Yisha said, “You just practiced this random skill on a whim? And you created a geno armor with it?
		I am not sure if you are lucky or unlucky, truth be told.”</p>

	<p>“Is there a problem with this geno art?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>

	<p>Yisha said slowly, “It isn’t just a problem. But don’t you think this skill requires… well, too much… skill? If
		you had a body like this, you’d already be a god. You wouldn’t have to practice. Whoever wrote this was
		conducting a prank with the intent of harming others. And mistakenly, you generated your geno armor with it. It
		is impossible to evolve a second time.”</p>

	<p>What do I do, then?” Han Sen wondered if this really was a problem associated with The Story of Genes.</p>

	<p>When he studied The Story of Genes, he had acknowledged the problem. He already knew the requirements were
		absurdly high and demanding. No one could even start off with the basic requirements, and he had to use the
		black crystal armor to help him get his foot in the door with its practice.</p>
