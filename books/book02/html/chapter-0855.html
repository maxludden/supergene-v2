    <p>
      The blood of super creatures not only stained the plaza; there was so much
      of it that a pool had formed, flooding the paved area. The blue bell was
      already in the midst of evolving, so Han Sen thought it was a shame to see
      so much blood go to waste.
    </p>

    <p>
      The airborne crane let out an ear-piercing screech at the precise moment
      the dragon swooped in to tear its head off. The golden chest fell to the
      ground, and was quickly taken away by a centipede-like worm.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crane was the first super creature fatality of the battle. The body
      decomposed as it fell back down to the plaza, and as it fell, a Life Geno
      Essence went with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dragon quickly consumed the Life Geno Essence and attacked the giant
      centipede.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched the grand battle for a while. When the opportunity arose,
      he summoned Moment Queen and Little Angel and then sent them over to
      attack the silver ape.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The silver ape used its thick arms to block Little Angel&#8217;s
      greatsword. She had been buffed by the Steel-Knight King, but even so, all
      her strike could leave behind was a light scratch mark. Its body was
      incredibly tough.
    </p>

    <p>
      As this occurred, Moment Queen teleported behind the silver ape and
      punched its left ear.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      The sound was as if a snail had just had its shell cracked, and the sound
      indicated she had broken his left ear. The ape shouted in pain and moved
      one of its hands to protect it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, in the meantime, drilled his Flaming Rex Spike into the silver
      ape&#8217;s right ear.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The ape thundered in pain. It grabbed the Flaming Rex Spike and threw Han
      Sen away with tremendous force.
    </p>

    <p>
      After its ears were both injured, its face began to bleed. The silver
      color of its body seemed to wash away, and the power it once exuded began
      to fade.
    </p>

    <p>
      Little Angel attacked again, and the ape sought to use its arms to block
      the incoming strike. Unlike before, its entire arm was lopped off.
      Following the breaking of its ears, it seemed as if the ape&#8217;s body
      had become weaker.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Devil-Blood King saw Han Sen assault and damage his silver ape,
      he became infuriated. No longer caring if the golden chests ended up in
      the possession of others, he ran towards Han Sen with fuming rage.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he went, he issued a command for the rest of his super creatures to
      surround Han Sen. They circled him, and the dragon guarded from above like
      a lid. The Devil-Blood King flashed and melded in with the shadows. When
      he reappeared again, he was standing behind Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he struck, the Devil-Blood King&#8217;s attack hit nothing. Somehow,
      Han Sen had evaded his strike.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Better learn a new trick, 'cause that one&#8217;s getting
      old.&#8221; Han Sen picked up his Flaming Rex Spike and swung it down on
      the Devil-Blood King.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had already deduced that the Devil-Blood King moved through
      shadows. Now, he could use his dongxuan aura to predict his destination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even so, the Devil-Blood King did not believe Han Sen could beat him.
      Repeatedly, he disappeared into the shadows for spring attacks. After
      several more repetitions, he was taken aback to see Han Sen dodge them
      all.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he realized Han Sen truly could track his movements, his face looked
      dire.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The silver ape screamed, just as Little Angel brought down her greatsword
      to hew its head from its body.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Silver-Blood Macaque Killed. Beast Soul Gained.
        The Flesh Of This Creature Is Edible, And You May Harvest Its Life Geno
        Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno
        Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen heard the announcement and was pleased to hear that he had finally
      obtained another beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King&#8217;s reaction to this slaying wasn&#8217;t quite
      the same, though. His blood boiled with anger. His determination to kill
      Han Sen doubled, but just as he was about to attack once more, a super
      creature barred his way. From the sides, other wild super creatures
      attacked and tried to maul him, in a bid to take his golden chests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Shelter was in a diabolical mess, and amidst the chaos, the silver
      fox thought it was a good time to depart Han Sen&#8217;s shoulders and
      chow down on the dead silver ape.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the Devil-Blood King was preoccupied, Han Sen took the opportunity
      to flee to an area that had fewer shadows. If his nemesis came after him
      again, things would be significantly easier. Although Han Sen could dodge
      the attacks, one mistake was all it would take for him to be destroyed. It
      was better to be safe than sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King&#8217;s fury showed no sign of lessening, however.
      Shaking off the super creatures, he followed after Han Sen through the
      air, screaming.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dragon, hearing its master scream in the pursuit of his most despised
      human, accompanied the Devil-Blood King. It flew high above Han Sen,
      forming a shadow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King used this portable shadow to warp towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      To this, Han Sen coldly smiled. He did not dodge; instead, he swung his
      fist. His fist was like a silver sun, one that illuminated the area and
      forbid the approach of any shadow.
    </p>

    <p>Pop!</p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King could not make use of Han Sen&#8217;s shadow to
      pounce upon his foe. Spilling blood, he exploded back through the
      dragon&#8217;s shadow as if he had been banished from its premise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen used her teleportation-like abilities to swoop behind the
      Devil-Blood King and smack his head. The Devil-Blood King&#8217;s his head
      was driven through the stone platform beside him in a squishy mess.
      Grabbing the three gold chests he had possessed, she quickly took off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite his ruined, bloody, and disfigured head, the Devil-Blood King was
      not done yet. He called and went after Moment Queen with the rest of his
      super creatures, wanting those three chests back more than anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Run!&#8221; Han Sen commanded Moment Queen to escape with the
      goodies she had managed to retrieve. Obtaining three was more than he
      expected, and securing them was his first priority.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Moment Queen&#8217;s speed, escape shouldn&#8217;t have been
      difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      But much to Han Sen&#8217;s surprise, Moment Queen was not able to escape
      the pursuit of the Devil-Blood King and his subordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen&#8217;s face was consumed by a look of disdain, cursing the
      creatures that chased her.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, Moment Queen opened the three chests in her possession. A gold light
      burst forth, expelling a wretched energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, and his face became gloomy. He knew something
      terrible was about to occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other super creatures had not been able to open the chests, due to how
      tightly they had been sealed. One creature had even swallowed theirs, all
      to no avail.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen watched the super creature do this, the beast was torn apart
      from the inside. When the chest slipped out of its intestines, it was fine
      and unchanged.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a chest that seemed to be impossible to open or eat, Moment Queen had
      popped her lid with relative ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was already suspicious regarding the Jade-Gold Tree&#8217;s choice
      of rooting itself in Moment Shelter, and he still didn&#8217;t believe she
      was totally unaware of what the tree&#8217;s existence meant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen had been performing exceptionally well in recent times, and
      she had obeyed Han Sen&#8217;s every command. Her life was in his hands,
      too, so he never thought to question her loyalties.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now, something was amiss. Moment Queen must have known something about
      the tree, and she had decided to keep Han Sen in the dark. Opening a chest
      now, with apparent ease, was revealing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stared at Moment Queen and the three open chests, wanting to know
      what was inside them.
