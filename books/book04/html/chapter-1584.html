      “That Destroyer Wolf will be a big problem if I don’t kill it.” Han Sen
      frowned as he watched the Destroyer Wolf roaming wherever it pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Destroyer Wolf had seen him become a super king spirit, and the wolf was
      definitely an enemy now. Han Sen certainly wanted to kill it, but the
      Destroyer Wolf’s powers of death and space were a difficult combo to deal
      with. It could easily travel between space faults, so it would be
      difficult to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were at least thirty super creatures encircling it now, yet none of
      them could do anything to it. Instead, many of them were getting gravely
      injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also many super creatures watching the fight, and some of them
      were incredibly powerful. Han Sen saw that Gu Qingcheng was also observing
      the fight from a distance. She wasn’t certain that she could kill the
      Destroyer Wolf, so she could only watch the fight without doing anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen watched for a while as he thought. “There are so many powerful
      creatures here, so perhaps my Dollar geno core can finally be put to use.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the Dollar geno core had a low level, the nature of its power could
      still be useful. It was normally rather useless, but now, surrounded by so
      many powerful creatures, things were different.
    </p>
    <p>
      The super creatures here were all like billionaires. If the geno core
      could absorb a little power from each of them, the power inside the Dollar
      would be inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The only problem now is, how can I hit the body of that Destroyer Wolf
      with Dollar?” Han Sen glared at the Destroyer Wolf that was blinking
      between locations, trying to find a chance to hit it with the geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf was moving quickly, and Sacred blood was splashing
      everywhere. It was powerful beyond imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xu Mi took Bao’er to Gu Qingcheng. Gu Qingcheng took a look at Bao’er and
      asked, “Where is Han Sen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Teacher had something important to do, so he hasn’t come back yet.” Xu Mi
      looked at the fight in the sky and asked. “Sister Gu, do you think they
      can defeat that Destroyer Wolf?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That will be difficult! The power of that Destroyer Wolf has surged, and
      nobody can stop its attacking power. But that’s not even the problem. His
      space swallowing power is just incredible. Its ability to travel between
      space faults makes it too difficult to kill. If Sacred’s group doesn’t
      choose to leave, there will be a lot of casualties here today,” said Gu
      Qingcheng mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xu Mi shook his head and said, “Destroyer Wolf might not be able to do
      that. Though it’s indeed powerful, it still can’t compare with the
      emperors throughout the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. If it actually goes
      reckless today, it won’t be able to stay in this sanctuary anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Xu Mi spoke, Destroyer Wolf tore apart a spirit from Outer Sky, and it
      didn’t show any sign of stopping. It seemed that it needed to kill
      everyone present to sate its bloodlust.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s gone mad.” Xu Mi smiled.</p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng said, “It suddenly got such incredible power, so it’s normal
      that it’s arrogant and rash. It’s probably powerful enough to rival some
      of the strongest emperors now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Goddess, let’s go. Destroyer Wolf is too powerful, and there’s nothing we
      can do about it,” yelled a super creature following Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>Another spirit was also trying to persuade Yu Miao to retreat.</p>
    <p>
      Some of the spirits and mutant creatures watching the fight also fled the
      area.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You want to go? Not that easily! I’ll kill you all today, and no one will
      survive!” The Destroyer Wolf was reckless. It grabbed a super creature
      that looked like an elephant and broke its neck. It took a bite, then
      roared at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden, a trace of golden light broke the sky and flew toward it.
      Just when Destroyer Wolf had reached its peak, the gold light hit the
      Destroyer Wolf’s neck and stuck to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was staring at the Destroyer Wolf, and they could all clearly see
      the golden coin stuck on the wolf’s neck. Everyone, including the
      Destroyer Wolf, looked back at where the golden coin had flown from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was standing there in his super king spirit mode. All the super
      creatures were dazed; apparently, no one recognized Han Sen as a super
      king spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Destroyer Wolf sneered, and its eyes were bulging with rage. “You again.
      Great, then I’ll kill you first.”
    </p>
    <p>The Destroyer Wolf’s deathly power surged as it flew toward Han Sen.</p>
    <p>Han Sen didn’t say anything. Instead, he clicked his fingers.</p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden, the golden coin on the wolf’s neck started to gleam, and
      the wolf’s body paused for a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the other super creatures, they were all horrified as they noticed
      that a little of their power was seeping out of their bodies and drifting
      toward the golden coin on the Destroyer Wolf’s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the creatures were trying to stop their power from leaving, but it was
      completely useless. That part of their power didn’t seem to belong to them
      anymore, as it was completely out of their control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Gu Qingcheng looked ill. A part of her power was also being sucked
      away. Even with her strength, she wasn’t able to slow it down. She was
      horrified, and she couldn’t help looking at the master of that golden
      coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, all the creatures around were staring at Han Sen in
      shock. Some random guy with a random golden coin was able to steal their
      power from their control.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they looked at the Destroyer Wolf, the super creatures were even more
      horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf, who had previously been dominating the battle, was now
      being suppressed completely like it was being crushed under a mountain.
      Its body was shaking, and then the creature was falling through the air.
    </p>
    <p>Bam!</p>
    <p>
      With a giant sound, the Destroyer Wolf hit the ground hard enough to form
      a crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      The geno core couldn’t gather power from a very large area, so it usually
      wasn’t very strong. However, there were too many super creatures around,
      so they could give the coin much more power than usual, which was why the
      golden coin was stronger than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was exhilarated, as the Dollar was performing much better than he
      had expected. It was even able to absorb power from all those super
      creatures. It was absolutely incredible as it was only a silver geno core,
      and it hadn’t even reached the level of gold geno core yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every creature here had at least a gemstone geno core, and many had super
      geno cores. But none of them could resist the absorbing power of the
      Dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf struggled and tried to move into a space fault, yet its
      body was trembling, and it couldn’t even take a step. Its head was
      particularly immobile, and the creature had a hard time even raising it.
      The wolf’s head was getting lower and lower, and it almost touched the
      ground. It kept roaring, but its head just kept sinking.
