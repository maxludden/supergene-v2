<h2>Training Is Over</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2161</h3>

<p>The elites of Sky Palace, the Dragon, the Destroyed, the Buddha,
and the Demon were still waiting outside of Metal World. Two months
had elapsed by now, and they had yet to see any of their Marquises
return. As each new day passed without any sign of their students,
their moods became darker and darker. They were finally beginning
to settle on the painful acceptance that their people might never
come back.</p>
<p>“Some… something is coming out of Metal World…” murmured a
Dragon that had been keenly watching Metal World.</p>
<p>As he spoke, everyone else began to react, as well. The elites
that were waiting outside of the planet inched closer, staring
intently at the magnetic storms that shrouded the surface of Metal
World.</p>
<p>Someone emerged from the clouds. One… two… and then there were
more. The dots emerging from the clouds continued to grow until
they resolved into familiar faces.</p>
<p>“Dragon Eight! It’s Dragon Eight!” a Dragon King screamed.</p>
<p>The elites of the other races reacted the same way when their
people emerged from the storm.</p>
<p>But as the last of them came through the clouds, the Sky Palace
elders looked more ecstatic than ever, while a gradual glumness
crept into the hearts of the others.</p>
<p>This was because there were more Sky Palace students than the
students of all the other races combined. The Sky Palace team was
entirely intact, but the same couldn’t be said of the others. The
other groups were in a sorry state, and even the survivors had
sustained grievous injuries.</p>
<p>Han Sen took Yuya with him to debrief the Sky Palace elders on
what had transpired. The elders were delighted to see one hundred
students all accounted for, only a little worse for wear. One elder
was so exuberantly happy with the results, he said, “Good! Well
done, you guys. There is no need for you to say anything more. You
should go home and take a well-earned rest.”</p>
<p>Yes.” Han Sen, Yuya, and the others were ready to leave
alongside the elders.</p>
<p>But suddenly, they found themselves surrounded on all sides by
the Dragon, the Destroyed, the Buddha, and the Demon. They
positioned themselves threateningly around the Sky Palace group,
clearly not intending to let them leave.</p>
<p>“What is this?” The leader of the Sky Palace elites, Green Crane
Elder, looked at them darkly. The Sky Palace members prepared to
fight.</p>
<p>A King of the Destroyed looked at Han Sen and all the others and
said angrily, “All these races entered Metal World, and they were
obliterated. But you haven’t lost a single soul. Have you performed
a trick to harm our Marquises?”</p>
<p>It was understandable why the Destroyed King was so angry. Every
race except the Destroyed had a few Marquises return. They had lost
their entire team. They were confused and angry, and they
desperately wanted to know more about what had transpired on Metal
World.</p>
<p>The other races weren’t filled with the same rage as the
Destroyed, but they had still lost a great many people. They were
still feeling that loss, and they didn’t want Han Sen and the
others to leave so casually.</p>
<p>With everyone there to stop Sky Palace from leaving, this was
the perfect opportunity to find out what had happened. Once the Sky
made it back to their home, negotiating with them would become much
more difficult.</p>
<p>So, right then and there, all the elites were going to demand
some answers. If this was going to happen, it had to happen
now.</p>
<p>Green Crane Elder chuckled after hearing the Destroyed King.
“Your people are weak. How is the demise of your people our
business?”</p>
<p>The Destroyed King laughed grimly and asked, “Are you saying all
these races are not as strong as you? Even if that were true, there
is no way all our own died of mere circumstance, whereas not a
single one of yours was brought grievous harm. If you do not
explain the reasons for this, we Destroyed—and the others—will not
be allowing you to walk away from here.”</p>
<p>They were obviously hoping for the Dragon to support them. The
Destroyed couldn’t stop Green Crane Elder on their own.</p>
<p>“Explanation? Sky Palace doesn’t owe an explanation to anyone
for anything,” Green Crane Elder grunted.</p>
<p>He had already instructed Han Sen and the others not to speak
because he had suspected something like this might happen. Green
Crane Elder actually thought the same thing that the other elites
did; the Sky Palace Marquises must have done something to the other
teams. Otherwise, how could they have returned without losing a
single member, while the other teams were in such disarray?</p>
<p>Destroyed King bared his teeth and growled, “Don’t use the
influence of Sky Palace to scare us. The Sky are strong, yes, but
none of us here are weak. If you do not give me an explanation,
none of you will be permitted to leave.”</p>
<p>“Mister Green Crane, why do you not clarify this situation
before you leave?” one of the Buddha Kings asked tonelessly.</p>
<p>The Dragon King spoke as well. “If the Sky Palace students
weren’t responsible for any of this, what harm can there be in
staying for a little while and providing us with an
explanation?”</p>
<p>Green Crane Elder frowned, and he started to say something. But
before he could speak, Dragon Eight, Kahn, and the others that had
still been making their way up from Metal World arrived. They all
moved to their respective Kings and spoke quietly with them.</p>
<p>Aside from the Destroyed, when the other races heard of what
happened, their expressions grew even darker.</p>
<p>Moments ago, they all had their weapons raised at Sky Palace,
but now, their hostility had turned to the Destroyed.</p>
<p>“Destroyed, it looks like you all are the ones who need to
explaining yourselves.” A Dragon King looked at the Destroyed with
icy eyes.</p>
<p>The other races were giving them severely unfriendly looks. The
Destroyed were confused, as they suddenly had no idea what was
going on.</p>
<p>Green Crane Elder asked Han Sen and Yuya to explain what had
happened. After he heard it all, he was left in shock.</p>
<p>His mouth hung wide. He was not shocked that the Destroyed had
betrayed and ambushed the other races, but he was shocked to hear
that Han Sen had fought off all those xenogeneics alone and saved
everyone in the process.</p>
<p>Every Marquise that had gone there was supposed to be an elite,
especially the likes of Dragon Eight, Dragon Nine, and Kahn.
Despite their impressive powers, they were unable to fend off the
xenogeneics. Han Sen, on the other hand, had beaten those same
xenogeneics by himself. It was a very scary thing to think
about.</p>
<p>“Invincible” was the perfect term for someone like Han Sen.</p>
<p>Although the Dragon and the others couldn’t believe Han Sen was
that strong, there were many Marquises there to verify the story.
Their own people had no reason to exaggerate Han Sen’s power in the
tale, so they had no choice but to believe the story.</p>
<p>After this, Han Sen was being talked about everywhere. Whoever
heard the story knew now that Sky Palace was the home of two very
prestigious individuals. One was Lone Bamboo, and the other was Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Because the deified Metal Beast still lived on the planet,
everyone gave up on the idea of claiming Metal World for
themselves. And as for how they all planned on dealing with the
Destroyed, Han Sen did not know.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen brought all of the Sky Palace members back
alive, he was rewarded by Sky Palace. But none of that actually
mattered to Han Sen. The deal between Yisha and Sky Palace was for
Han Sen to reach Marquise status. Now that Han Sen was a Marquise,
his studies with them were over. He now had to return to Narrow
Moon.</p>
<p>After all, he was not a true heir of Sky Palace. Sky Palace
could not offer the resources he needed to get him up to Duke.</p>
