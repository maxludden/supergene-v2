The jian’s body was delivered another gash as a consequence of the saw sword. After the slash, Han Sen was sent flying away. He struck a shield. The jian’s body pierced through the shield. He was now behind the shield.

The little girl came out of nowhere. She clutched the handle of the jian and pulled Han Sen away from the broken shield.

“Why are you here to mess things up?” Han Sen was depressed. He saw see the woman was holding the saw sword and slashing toward them. It was just above the little girl’s head. Han Sen could only use his Jadeskin’s Break World power to stop the saw sword.

Han Sen thought The Story of Genes’ power would be able to combat the saw sword, but the power of The Story of Genes was too much. The shockwave he was able to create was enough to obliterate the little girl.

The jian and saw collided. Han Sen and the little girl were shaken away. The little girl spilled some blood, but her eyes were still very wild. She held onto Han Sen and struggled to get up off the ground.

“If you are not Qin Xiu, do you mind telling me who you are?” Han Sen ignored the little girl and used his will to talk to saw sword.

“I am Qin Xiu, but I am just a doppelganger. I am here to claim Soldier Weapon Sky.” The woman sounded like Qin Xiu was talking through her.

“Weren’t you already able to reach the 17th sky? Why must you come back down here to claim dominance over the first sky?” Han Sen now understood why he felt like it was Qin Xiu but not exactly Qin Xiu. It was just a clone.

Qin Xiu said, “I can tell you that the 33 skies were returned to their origins. Any creature can become the leader of the 33 skies and take control of the geno tablet, but something must be done before that can be achieved. They must take the first sky and be the leader of the first sky so that they can fight for the geno tablet.”

“I see.” Han Sen’s eyes squinted.

Qin Xiu explained all of this because he was very confident. He was not afraid of Han Sen learning the truth and trying to fight him.

“If you already understand, then show me what you are really capable of,” the woman said. “Let me see the true breadth of your power.” She then slashed her sword toward Han Sen and the little girl.

“I do not need any power to deal with you.” Han Sen used Jadeskin. He borrowed the jade sheep’s hollow structure.

Outside of the ice-jade jian was an ice-jade shield. The ice-jade shield was plated in a hexagon, beehive-like patterns. It covered Han Sen and the little girl. The sword struck the ice-jade shield and cut it, but it did not, however, harm Han Sen and the little girl inside.

“It would appear my Break World rate is over 3% now. That is brilliant. That also means my Break World power has reached the level in which it becomes solid.” Han Sen was absolutely delighted.

All these attacks were not useless. He was finally able to use the features of the jade sheep’s body and apply them to his Jadeskin. It enabled the Jadeskin’s Break World power to become solid.

The woman coldly grunted. The saw sword kept slashing. Sword after sword, it was like a storm that kept slashing downward.

Han Sen generated more ice-jade shields. He kept blocking the attacks of the sword again and again. The ice-jade shield was broken again and again.

Han Sen thought, “Very powerful Qin Xiu. Even just a cloned sword is this powerful. If the real Qin Xiu became a sword, how powerful would he be?” The Jadeskin breakthrough was not coming to an end.

The hollow structure of the jade sheep’s body had many different types. Now, Han Sen was using a beehive mode. He was trying to put more of the hollow structures into Jadeskin.

Jadeskin’s Break World rate became higher and higher. The saw sword left smaller and smaller marks across the ice-jade shield.

When Jadeskin’s Break World rate reached 60%, a mysterious and old spell started to appear on the solid ice-jade shield.

The spell was weirdly shaped. It was not like ordinary text, but it had an ice-jade mind. It was hard to describe how clean it was.

When Jadeskin generated a Break World spell, the saw sword was unable to cut the solid ice-jade shield. Han Sen was no longer losing the battle.

Han Sen looked at the saw sword and said, “Qin Xiu. If you want to kill me, come and fight me yourself. You are too naive to believe a petty clone has what it takes to bring me down.”

The woman stopped speaking. She kept striking Han Sen again and again, but she was blocked by the ice-jade jian’s Break World power. She was unable to damage the jian.

Regarding the 33 skies, a man was standing in front of the geno tablet. He was looking at the geno tablet, remaining totally motionless.

The geno tablet was like a big screen made of many smaller screens. All of the scenes kept changing across the geno tablet.

One of the screens displayed Han Sen doing battle with a woman. The man was watching that fight.

While the man watched the fight, the geno tablet suddenly started to glow. Not just the man, but also the countless number of creatures that populated the two universes could see the headstone-like 33 skies have its geno tablet glow. It lit up the two universes.

When the geno tablet’s light grew weaker, the main and reverse universe noticed the light source was the first line of the geno tablet’s text.

Seventeenth Sky Leader: Qin Xiu

“Qin Xiu is Qin Xiu. He took one sky so soon. He became a leader of 17 skies.” Some old antiques who knew about the 33 skies were shocked.

At the same time, Qin Xiu’s body emerged from the geno tablet. He saw the man in front of the geno tablet.

“God. Long time no see.” Qin Xiu squinted his eyes as he looked at the man.

“If I was able to, I would opt to never see your face again,” God Hall Leader coldly said.

“You are scared. You are scared I will become the master of the geno tablet. What a shame. You are God Hall Leader already. You have the geno hall. You cannot also be the master of the geno tablet. If you could, you would stop me.”

“Even if I was not here, you could not become the geno tablet’s master,” God Hall Leader said without moving.

“Who do you think can actually stop me?” Qin Xiu asked with confidence. “Do you think those Annihilation-class God Spirits you employ are capable? You should know they can do nothing to stop me.”

“Maybe they would be enough. Maybe they would not be enough. I will not know until I try it. Besides, this world has many powerful creatures.” God Hall Leader remained looking very cold.

“The powerful creatures you are talking about does not include him, does it?” Qin Xiu’s eyes looked at the geno tablet. They landed on the image of Han Sen.
