<h2>Getting Hide</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3132</h3>

<p>Han Sen and the others sat atop Bald Guy’s God Wind Dragon. The
journey seemed hurried. Bald Guy knew where the key planet of Ghost
Starlight was.</p>
<p>The first planet had been destroyed. They had to leave the
system. They needed to find the next Ghost Starlight land. Bald Guy
could not help but ask, “Old Han, did you find a god pulse in the
core?”</p>
<p>“I found it, but the god pulse had been absorbed by a gene race
Han Sen replied. “I was unable to retrieve anything.”</p>
<p>He was not lying. He really didn’t get anything out of it. All
of the good stuff had been claimed by the flying fish, and the
flying fish followed Bao’er. He only got an ultimate eight-armed
evil dragon from Sky King out of it.</p>
<p>A god-class, ultimate gene race took a lot of time and resources
to raise. For ordinary people, having a god-class, ultimate body
gene race was an insurmountably difficult task to accomplish in
their lifetimes.</p>
<p>The eight-armed evil dragon had three skills, which was
exceedingly rare. Han Sen was satisfied with acquiring it. If he
had not received something so wonderful, he would not have allowed
Sky King to get away so quickly. It was the same for Han Sen as it
was with the others. Many powerful nobles were looking for Ghost
Starlight. They saw many groups of flying gene races flying
around.</p>
<p>There was a battleship-sized purple and red dragonfly breaking
space. It sounded scary. Every gene race made sure to get out of
its way. Even the God Wind Dragon was so afraid that it made sure
to fly away from the fiend. When the purple and red dragonfly broke
space and departed, they continued traveling on their original
route.</p>
<p>“The dragonfly looked very good,” Bao’er said with jealousy.</p>
<p>Bald Guy lifted his lips. “Of course, it is. It was the first
reward from a god battle. It was a rare gene race called a mutant
dragonfly. There is only one of them in the entire universe. It
once belonged to the Qin Kingdom’s first swordsman, Jian Bu Gu. He
got it from a god fight, but he gave it to the Mo family. Now, the
Mo family’s Mo Shang Cang owns it. “Why did Jian Bu Gu give the
mutant dragonfly to the Mo family?” Han Sen asked with
curiosity.</p>
<p>Bald Guy’s eyes flared with a nosy flame. He laughed and said,
“The old grandma of the Mo family was the Mo family’s matriarch.
She loved Teacher Jian very much. When she was younger, she did a
lot for him, but Teacher Jian only practiced with the sword. He
only treated the Mo family’s matriarch like a little sister. When
he vanished, he gave the mutant dragonfly to the Mo family’s
matriarch. The Mo family was a second-class noble. Because of the
mutant dragonfly and Jian Bu Gu, the king has always treated her
differently. Now, they are a top-class noble family.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Jian Bu Gu must have been full to the brim with
great stories, but he never expected his stories to be that
amazing.</p>
<p>While they were talking, a white crane flew over to them. When
it approached, it put them on alert.</p>
<p>The sky was wide. Even if a group of knights flew by, they would
never have to get so close to them. The white crane, however,
seemed to be headed in their direction.</p>
<p>“I mean no harm, Brother Han!” When the white crane drew close
enough, they saw a beautiful man sitting atop it. He waved to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Mister God One Gong Zhen Jun? Why is he looking for you?” Bald
Guy whispered with a frown.</p>
<p>“Ah, it is Mister God One. What inspires you to come to see me?”
Han Sen looked at Mister God One, who was now very close.</p>
<p>Mister God One and Gong Shu Jin, the man Han Sen had murdered,
were both one of the top four misters of Jade Wall City. Although
the four misters were famous, in the eyes of real nobles, they were
nothing.</p>
<p>Mister God One laughed. “I just randomly saw Brother Han, so I
thought I would drop by and say hello. Now that I think about it,
there is something I would like to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>“Please tell me, Mister,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Mister God One was silent a moment before saying, “I found a
land pulse, but the land pulse is extremely dangerous. My power
alone is not sufficient for digging it up, and I do not have
friends or family here. So, I thought I might ask for your help in
digging the land pulse there. After that, we can share the loot.
How does that sound?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not answer. Bald Guy lifted his lips. “This Gold
Crystal System has many land pulses. Why don’t we go do it
ourselves? Why do we have to share with you?”</p>
<p>Mister God One smiled. “Brother Xia is Mister Wei’s student. You
must have heard about skinning hide.”</p>
<p>“You found a skinning hide?” Bald Guy was shocked.</p>
<p>Mister God One nodded and said, “If it was not for a land pulse
that shocked the sky, I would not have asked Mister Han to
help.”</p>
<p>SC</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Bald Guy, who explained, “Skinning hide is a
land pulse with a weird scene. A strange grass grows on the land
pulse and absorbs the weird scene of the land pulse. If you do not
see the grass up close, you would not know that it was a land
pulse. When a skinning hide appears, there will be a land pulse
that shocks the world. There is a very high chance of getting a
god-class gene egg there. But…”</p>
<p>After saying that, Bald Guy hesitated. Mister God One
interjected. “Things like skinning hide are what many gene races
adore. This is a skinning hide with a land pulse air. Even
god-class gene races seek to guard it. They wait there for skinning
hide to mature. The skinning hide I found has a lot of scary gene
races protecting it. That is why I am asking for your help.”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Han Sen looked at Bald Guy and Li Bing Yu
for their opinions.</p>
<p>“If it really is a skinning hide, we can at least go check it
out.” Bald Guy admitted to his temptation.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t entirely sure about it, yet he agreed. Mister God
One led the way. They headed in a different side direction.</p>
<p>Mister God One was targeting a planet with life, but one without
humans. Gene races were all over that planet. If the super god
pulse had not appeared in the Gold Crystal System, most humans
would not have ventured there.</p>
<p>Now, a super god pulse had appeared. The gene races there had
achieved breakthroughs, and they had wildly mutated. The places
were many times scarier. Ordinary people would not dare go to that
planet.</p>
<p>Bald Guy felt a bit surprised that Mister God One dared going
there to dig up a gene egg alone. It was very brave of him.</p>
<p>After entering the planet, Mister God One steered them all to
land carefully atop a mountain peak. He pointed at another
mountain. About halfway up its slopes was a skinning hide.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his peacock king’s eye skill and was able to see a
platform around the size of a football halfway up the mountain.
There was a lot of strange grass on it, decking the entire breadth
of the platform.</p>
<p>The grass was half a foot tall. The leaves were yellow. It was
like aloe on the ground. A red baby bucket was at the center of the
grass. It was unknown if that was the seed, grass, or what.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, one would have thought it was a baby
that had been skinned alive. It had red flesh that made people feel
extremely uncomfortable. The skinning hide was not glowing, but it
looked bloody. It was definitely not something ordinary.</p>
