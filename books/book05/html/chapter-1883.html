<p>“We have to give it a shot, no matter what. We cannot willingly
let ourselves die here!” Wang Yuhang said, then jumped into the
godlight area.</p>
<p>When his legs and his head touched the godlight, it was like he
had struck a plank of raw steel. He bounced off with a pang, and it
was fortunate he was wearing Han Sen’s Marquise armor. Had he not,
that would have hurt.</p>
<p>“Damn! Is that light or a wall of steel?” Wang Yuhang looked at
the golden light.</p>
<p>“Why else do you think the Kings tried to run?” Guya looked at
him with disdain.</p>
<p>Han Sen touched the golden light, and it was like stone. It was
so smooth, he couldn’t even find a seam or crevice. So, Han Sen
tried to use his Ghost Teeth Knife to slice golden light. Sparks
flew from the blade, but he could not break through the light.</p>
<p>“It’s so hard!” Han Sen was shocked. They could not penetrate
the wall, so it spoke volumes about the Kings who had been able to
move through the light. But even so, despite their massive
strength, they were unable to get close to the statue.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang and Han Sen were both unable to enter the godlight,
but the six Kings soon noticed them, even as they tried hitting the
statue.</p>
<p>They looked around them and were shocked. They did not expect
another big bunch of people to still be alive. On top of that, Han
Sen’s group only had average power.</p>
<p>Aside from Icebird Duke, the others were all decidedly weak.</p>
<p>When they saw Guna and Guya, however, they were even more
shocked. And adding to that, they then looked happy.</p>
<p>The giant King, still clad in armor, walked before Han Sen. He
grabbed Guya and Guna in his hands and took them over to the
statue.</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Han Sen saw this happen, but he did not
move, and the giant had already taken them and brought them before
the statue.</p>
<p>“What does he want to do?” Wang Yuhang asked.</p>
<p>Icebird Duke coldly said, “They cannot break the godlight. They
want to use Guna and Guya’s blood to hopefully achieve a connection
with Purgatory Heaven. It might enable them to reach the tear.”</p>
<p>Han Sen could not say anything. After they were taken, their
protective light went with them. The arms started to rise like mad.
But Han Sen’s people could not enter the godlight, so he kept on
swinging his Knife Blank to cut down the arms.</p>
<p>“Buddha King, you are the best at this. I will let you handle
it. Our survival solely depends on you,” the Giant said, right
before handing over Guna and Guya to the monk-like King.</p>
<p>“Who will go to hell if I don’t?” The King recited the line of
an ancient buddha, and then he raised his hand and became a buddha
himself. In a shroud of white light, he came before Guya and
Guna.</p>
<p>“The geno universe has monks, huh?” Han Sen was shocked, as he
had thought that monks were a human thing.</p>
<p>They are not monks, they are the Buddha! They are one of the
higher races,” Icebird Duke said.</p>
<p>“Buddha?” Han Sen and Wang Yuhang came from the Alliance. Their
faces looked strange.</p>
<p>The buddha’s head was as smooth as a lightbulb, without a single
hair, as if he had been born bald. The dots across his head were
nine naturally-born moles. Guna and Guya’s faces turned pale. It
looked as if they wanted to struggle and get free. But beneath the
Buddha Light of the Buddha King, they could not even flicker their
eyelids.</p>
<p>Buddha King moved his finger, and then a Buddha Light landed
between her eyebrows. Blood began to seep out of her brow.</p>
<p>It was more than a mere dribble, as well. Suddenly, it became a
long streak of blood that floated away from her head. Its target
became clear, as it began to drift towards the statue.</p>
<p>The blood began to suffuse into the golden light. Gold Jade King
and the others started to gather up power, ready to strike the
blood.</p>
<p>As the Kings prepared a frightening attack, the blood-tainted
light started to crack. Blood began to fill the cracks like a
blooming flower.</p>
<p>The Kings were happy with this result, and the giant shouted,
“Buddha King! Take the essence of the other Gana, so we can escape
with greater haste! The longer we are here, the more danger we are
in.”</p>
<p>“Amitabha!” Buddha King said again. His face did not look very
kind. He pointed at Guya’s forehead, and then more blood came
flowing out. That too started to drift towards the statue.</p>
<p>With Guya and Guna’s blood, the godlight seemed to have
weakened. The six Kings kept attacking without reprieve. Then the
godlight began to shatter.</p>
<p>The smashed light could not coalesce again because of the blood
that was spreading through the rupture.</p>
<p>Gold Jade King and the others were all made supremely happy, as
they were able to destroy the godlight with their crazed attacks.
Now, they wanted to create a path through the godlight and head
towards the rupture.</p>
<p>“These scumbag *ssholes!” Wang Yuhang was so mad, he punched the
godlight. But he was too weak, and he could not even break the
outer layer. All he did was make his fist numb.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t like what had happened, either, but at the end of
the day, it was just natural selection. He couldn’t have helped
Guna and Guya, even if he wanted to. And they weren’t in a much
better position themselves.</p>
<p>Their powers would not be enough to breach the godlight. Even if
Gold Jade King cleaved a path all the way through, they had no
choice of entering.</p>
<p>Han Sen could jump into the sanctuary for safety, alongside Wang
Yuhang, but Dragon Lady and Han Meng’er did not have anywhere to
hide. If they were left alone, they’d surely die.</p>
<p>Guna and Guya had been frozen stiff by the Buddha King. The
essence of their blood continued to leak from their foreheads. The
blood was leaking slowly, but they had already lost a large volume.
Especially Guya.</p>
<p>The two of them looked so angry, hopeless, and sad. They looked
at each other, but understood that neither of them could do a
thing.</p>
<p>They could not even die holding each other. They stood where
they were as their blood was stolen, bit by bit.</p>
<p>Gold Jade King and the other Kings were waiting for them to
finish bleeding out. The godlight was cracked, and a blood path
opened. They were only one meter away from the statue.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>A giant dragon-like Purgatory Beast was bom. It came rushing
towards Han Sen like mad.</p>
<p>It was a high tier Purgatory Beasts. Seeing it, everyone’s faces
paled.</p>
