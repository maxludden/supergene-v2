    <p>
      Wang Liang and the other evolvers greatly admired Han Sen. No-one they had
      served under could command with the talent he did. Battles were instant,
      moment-to-moment affairs that morphed and changed every second. To command
      people ahead of time in such a way was remarkable, because if anyone else
      had issued commands, by the time the evolvers performed what they were
      told, the opportunity to do anything more would be gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen had just commanded ten people with amazing efficiency. He was
      quick in issuing his commands, that was to be expected, but his words were
      never rushed. Taking such impeccable orders relieved Wang Liang and his
      people from a great deal of stress, so they were able to do far more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang and his people admired Han Sen with the respect usually
      reserved for a religious deity. In the army, powerful people typically
      gained the respect of others, but for genuine admiration, one had to
      command others calmly and with grace, leading their troops on to victory.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had all served in the army, but none of them had been under the
      command of someone with such a talent for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In theory, it should be impossible for Han Sen to individually command the
      actions of ten people in a battle. But there he was, disproving it. The
      most amazing thing about Han Sen&#8217;s Dongxue Sutra was the layout, as
      he didn&#8217;t command the others what to do, nor how they should react.
    </p>

    <p>
      All Han Sen did was predict. The orders he issued came through his
      foresight and were therefore prepared beforehand, so what he did was relay
      his pre-emptive script of actions. He would lead his men into various
      positions, and like the forming of a jigsaw, an opportunity for them to
      strike would reveal itself to them just when they obeyed the command. But
      how they should attack was not specifically told to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was like Han Sen was using his Dongxue Sutra. Every move would lure or
      force an opponent into the exact position he wanted them to be. The people
      at his command were now like extensions of his own body, and it was as if
      he had ten hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key to doing this, however, rested in the fact that Han Sen knew the
      limits of his troops. He knew what they could do, and what they could not.
      If Han Sen had misjudged them, whenever they got into the position he told
      them to, they could not do anything and they would fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is why Han Sen had made sure to take a step back and observe their
      abilities thoroughly from the beginning. When he leapt back into the fray,
      with his great grasp of what his comrades could do, he could confidently
      start to issue commands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under Han Sen&#8217;s command, the ten people were fighting more calmly.
      They trusted Han Sen with an indomitable faith. This belief in one another
      had been forged through this experience of battle together, and it made
      their bodies and spirits accept it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Wang Liang and his people had not been injured any more, the
      snake-king refused to submit and they still could not kill it. Their foe
      was not slowing down, and it would only be a matter of time before they
      got tired. If that happened, losing the battle would be inevitable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of this, a nagging concern tugged at the minds of Wang Liang and
      his troops. After all, humans were not creatures, and their vitality and
      stamina were limited. To engage in a fight that was as rough as this, even
      the most experienced people could only last one or two hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen did not worry about this. He was using these ten people to
      push the snake-king exactly where he wanted it.
    </p>

    <p>
      At last, the snake-king&#8217;s head had practically been delivered to Han
      Sen. This was his long-awaited opportunity. He jumped to the
      snake-king&#8217;s head with a fist fuelled by a power that could shatter
      a mountain. With his Yin Force, Han Sen used his fist to drill inside the
      monster&#8217;s head. The damage he inflicted to the skull of the
      snake-king was the critical hit he had been waiting for, and it was
      terribly injured as a result.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The snake-king screamed and writhed in agony. When he lowered its head,
      its body&#8217;s shape was all wrong. Although the creature looked just as
      strong and fierce as before, its composure and form was not as solid as
      before the hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart was gladdened, thrilled that the Yin Force seemed to
      work. The blast must have rattled the snake-king&#8217;s brain, ruining
      its form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued to issue his commands to Wang Liang and the other
      evolvers to fight. Before long, the snake-king&#8217;s head was in front
      of Han Sen once more. He delivered another Yin Force punch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the second hit, it was as if the snake-king was drunk, as it
      began to lose control of its body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang was surprised at how things seemed to be turning out and he too
      was happy. Now, feeling assured of victory, and under the impeccable
      leadership of Han Sen, they put even greater efforts into the fight. Their
      admiration of the man did nothing but rise.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen struck the snake-king&#8217;s head for the third time, the
      beast could no longer resist. It collapsed to the ground, writhing,
      twisting and contorting in pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      For all intents and purposes, the battle was over. Han Sen told Wang Liang
      and his men to go and finish off the rest of the group of ice-snakes. Han
      Sen walked over to the helpless snake-king and pounded its head another
      dozen times, until its brain was exposed and he smashed it into bits,
      finishing the beast off completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Please give me your beast soul. I have to get a beast soul&#8230;
      Hallelujah! May the sweet mother of baby Jesus bless me!&#8221; Han Sen
      was cheering in his heart and soul. To spend so much effort and get
      nothing out of it would be quite crushing.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Sacred-Blood Creature Hunted: Silver-Eye Ice Snake King. The
        Beast Soul Has Been Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random
        Numeric Amount Of Sacred-Blood Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To
        Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Hearing that sound, Han Sen wanted to scream aloud in merriment. &#8220;I
      love you, Saint Mary!&#8221; But he only shouted in his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the snake-king had been killed, the other ice-snakes did not want to
      give their lives to fight the evolvers. Quickly, they raced back to the
      ice valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang and his men chased them to the entrance of the ice valley and
      when they turned around, they were quite surprised at the sight. The
      results of the battle in which they had just been victorious were strewn
      everywhere, with countless corpses of ice-snakes and the snake-king
      itself. There were even a few mutant class creatures piled up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the battle, they each received a couple of ice-snake beast
      souls. Although most were an ordinary class, a lucky few received mutant
      beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had killed far more ice-snakes than they had expected, but their haul
      of loot was their greatest ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will leave them for you. But go and find someone to help transfer
      the bodies of the snake-king and the ice-snakes back,&#8221; Han Sen
      hurriedly said, and then left.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang and the rest of the evolvers had no problem obeying Han
      Sen&#8217;s commands, because his leadership abilities had earned every
      ounce of their faith, trust and respect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen walked in a circle, returning to the top of the snowy mountain.
      The little silver fox was still patiently awaiting his return, and its
      hopeful eyes made Han Sen wonder whether the little thing would have
      waited there forever, if he had not come back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen return, the silver fox elegantly approached his legs again.
      The big fluffy tail hooked his legs like it had before, and the fox rubbed
      his head up and down against them again, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was beginning to grow fond of the silver fox. He secretly wished
      that it was just an ordinary creature, though, so he could have it by his
      side with relative ease. He didn&#8217;t yet know whether it had the
      intelligence or will to distinguish friend from foe.
    </p>

    <p>
      He held the silver fox in one arm and used his other hand to summon the
      silver-eye ice snake king sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      The thin silver sword was in Han Sen&#8217;s hand, and it was about three
      feet long and about as wide as a finger. The white silver of the sword
      gave it the feeling of having been forged from ice, and its composition
      was sure to leave a lasting impression on others. It looked as strong as
      it really was.
    </p>

    <p>
      The handguard was shaped like the wings of the snake it once belonged to,
      and the blade itself was plated with the scales of the creature. It looked
      beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it was thin, the silver-eye ice snake king sword was still wider
      than the silver-haired lady spirit sword, which was thinner than a
      cicada&#8217;s wing. But the snake-king sword felt solid, having been
      built in an entirely different style.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen swung it twice, and felt a certain splendor in splitting the air
      with it. Overjoyed, he said, &#8220;I only need one more sword. Once I get
      it, I can visit the Royal Shelter and battle the Twin Spirit.&#8221;
