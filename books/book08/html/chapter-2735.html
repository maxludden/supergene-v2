<p>Now that he was back in the valley, Shale was his opponent once
again. But things were different this time. Han Sen had changed a
lot since their first fight; he had become deified.</p>
<p>Shale wasn’t the same person Han Sen had fought the first time,
either. He had learned many more geno arts in the interim. Although
there were still flaws in his execution of certain skills, he was
stronger than he had been.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu stood outside the valley, but his eyes never left
Han Sen.</p>
<p>He knew it was even more unlikely that Shale would win this
time. He hadn’t thought that Han Sen would become deified so soon,
so Li Chun Qiu wasn’t expecting Shale to take part in a fight
already.</p>
<p>He hadn’t completed his instruction of Shale. The geno arts
Shale needed to learn took a long time to practice, especially when
it came to fixing the issues arising from the simplicity of his
previous skills.</p>
<p>But this didn’t matter, at the end of the day. Real fights were
how true fighters grew. Fighting an opponent like Han Sen would be
beneficial for Shale’s development.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu also wanted to know what Han Sen was like now that
he was deified.</p>
<p>In the valley, Shale looked at Han Sen and said, “I’ve found a
way to break your Under the Sky knife skill. You won’t defeat me
the same way this time.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t planning on using Under the Sky, anyway.” Han Sen
smiled and summoned Spell’s dual pistols.</p>
<p>The dual pistols of Spell had become deified class now. There
was even more detail in the engraving that covered the weapons, and
the texture of the grips was even comfier. The two pistols were
carved with mysterious flower symbols.</p>
<p>“Let me try how strong Spell has become now that she’s deified.”
Han Sen raised one of his hands and pulled the trigger. With a
roar, a bullet went flying out the barrel and shot directly toward
Shale.</p>
<p>Shale remained still. Instead of attempting to dodge the bullet,
one of his substance chains rose. He threw a punch to meet the
bullet.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The fist and the bullet hit each other, creating a scary impact.
Shale’s body was strong like a lion, but he was hit badly. His legs
cleaved two long trenches through the earth as he flew back a few
hundred meters.</p>
<p>Shale’s face changed. He turned his hand over to look at it, and
he saw the bullet lodged inside one of his fingers. Blood oozed out
from the bullet wound.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu frowned. Shale’s power was the best out of all
primitive deifieds. Yet with pure power, the lion-headed warrior
was at a disadvantage. It appeared that he was much weaker than Han
Sen, who had just leveled up.</p>
<p>“How can Han Sen be so strong?” Li Chun Qiu wondered to himself,
turning his gaze back to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Crystallizers were notorious for their poor fitness, but Han
Sen’s body was better than a born-deified at the same level. This
was so weird.</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite, on the other hand, were very happy. Han
Sen had leveled up to deified, and he was so strong. He was
stronger than any Very High of the same level. This was very
scary.</p>
<p>“What impressive power.” Shale’s eyes were on fire while he
watched Han Sen. His resolve for battle hadn’t been lessened.
Seeing Han Sen’s strength had actually stoked a greater fire in his
heart.</p>
<p>Substance chains danced madly around him. The atmosphere sizzled
like an unstoppable volcano that was about to erupt.</p>
<p>Clearly, Han Sen’s gun had triggered Shale’s desire for victory
even more. This explosion of power wasn’t just pure force. It was a
special skill.</p>
<p>“Shale has learned quite a lot of stuff recently. This will be a
perfect way for me to gauge the extent of my deified power.” Han
Sen didn’t attack. He was waiting for Shale to build up his
strength first.</p>
<p>Last time, Shale had lost to Han Sen because he didn’t have a
decisive power to beat him. That was why Han Sen had a chance to
trigger a hidden ability of Under the Sky. After his failure, Shale
had spent a lot of time thinking about how he might defeat Han Sen.
He considered many different potential tactics. With Li Chun Qiu’s
help, Shale settled on two different methods.</p>
<p>One method employed a punching skill that was similar to Under
the Sky. It was called Return to Origin. It could generate a lot of
punching power, and it formed a scary punching light that flowed
through the sky like a river. Using this, he could go against Under
the Sky and trace its movements.</p>
<p>The other method was known as Star Explode. For a short amount
of time, this geno art could greatly increase the fitness of
Shale’s body. His power and speed would receive a major boost. He
could use the skill to defeat Han Sen through absolute, sheer
power. It would limit Han Sen’s ability to use powerful knife
skills.</p>
<p>But Star Explode’s weakness was its short duration. Because it
was an exploding power, it would give Shale less than ten minutes
to beat Han Sen.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t beat Han Sen within ten minutes, his body would
become weak because he exploded too much.</p>
<p>When Star Explode’s power erupted, Shale’s whole body shone with
silver light. It was like a star exhausting all of its power in one
burst. Everything outside of his body darkened against the
background of his radiance.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, try out my punching skills!” Shale roared and threw a
punch toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>He was still using his old punching skill, but it was so
powerful that it seemed almost invincible. It was simpler than the
last time it was used, but its power and speed had grown as
well.</p>
<p>He unleashed his punch, and his substance chains spread like the
dust from a supernova. It was like that punch could destroy
everything. No power could rival that almighty strike.</p>
<p>That punching power carried the condensed light of a thousand
suns. Han Sen didn’t choose to dodge it, though. He straightened
his arm in front of him, lifting one of his pistols into line with
the incoming attack. That star-like power surged toward him. His
finger calmly squeezed the trigger.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The bullet streaked out of the barrel, shooting straight toward
the massive incoming strike.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A bright light exploded within the valley, blinding everyone who
was watching the fight. For several long moments, no one could see
anything. When the light finally dimmed a bit, they could see what
had happened. Their faces went blank.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s bullet hadn’t been stopped by Shale’s punching power.
It slid straight through the stardust to strike Shale’s fist
again.</p>
<p>But after passing through the star explosion, the bullet had
become weak. It hit Shale’s fist, but it hadn’t hurt him as the
first bullet had. It simply bounced off and dropped to the
ground.</p>
<p>Although the bullet hadn’t hurt Shale, its performance still
left Li Chun Qiu, Exquisite, and Li Keer speechless. After Shale
used Star Explode, his power had grown by an order of magnitude.
One punch should have been able to destroy a deified at the same
level.</p>
<p>And the bullet that Han Sen used had been built from the power
of a substance chain. It wasn’t even solid. The fact that it could
go against Shale’s Star Explode without being destroyed was beyond
shocking.</p>
<p>“My solidifying powers have become stronger. It generated a
bullet that wasn’t damaged by such a powerful explosion. I think it
has reached an eternal level now,” Han Sen complimented in his
heart.</p>
