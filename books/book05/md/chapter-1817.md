  Han Sen did not know if Yisha had gone crazy, or if he himself had snapped. “She wants to take me as a student What? I thought she hated my guts! I thought she’d prefer to skin me alive. Why would she take me as a student, pledging to make me a Duke in three years? Did her mind implode in rage, and this is some strange form of insanity?”

“Or is this all one great, big conspiracy? Will she try and trick me before destroying me? She could destroy me right now, if that is what she wanted to do. But then again, maybe she doesn’t know I’m Dollar. Even if she doesn’t know, though, why would she find me as a student? Am I getting grossly lucky? Or did Yisha simply get kicked in the head by a donkey, and randomly picked out a student that just so happened to be me?”

Han Sen did not understand. He looked at Yisha, having not the faintest clue why all of this was happening.

Yisha was satisfied with the way Han Sen reacted. She could tell Han Sen was in great shock, and she thought that was because he was unable to comprehend why a deified elite would so willingly accept someone so ordinary.

Yisha was going to take Han Sen as a student, and that was not just a random decision. When the man pointed at Han Sen, Yisha recognized him. She recognized Han Sen, but not Dollar.

When Kong Fei took a lantern to become known as No, everyone heard about it. The elites around Planet Kate knew that Kong Fei had given two deified feathers to two crystallizers.

Because Yisha was headed to Demon Grave, she was near Planet Kate at the time. She too learned about this. She knew Han Sen had one deified feather.

But Han Sen was just wearing his geno armor. He wasn’t wearing his Noble stuff, and he didn’t have pure crystallizer blood. Han Sen’s genes were complicated, so the elite races had all given their favor to Stay Up Late, who had pure blood. No one had made membership offers to Han Sen due to the risk of raising him.

When the man pointed out Han Sen, she didn’t think it was purely coincidental. She thought the man was trying to trouble her and make things harder.

Developing Han Sen to the ranks of a top champion and refining the deified feather to become semi-deified… That would have been too much to bet. She didn’t know if that would even have been possible.

But the fortune-teller’s request had been a strange one. Dukes were not particularly high level or low level. The challenge was definitely possible, so she agreed.

If Han Sen was an ordinary person, Yisha would have just taken him home without even telling him why.

But Kong Fei, who was deified, was still out there. And Han Sen had one of his deified feathers. So, Yisha was willing to take him as a real student. That meant she respected the feather and Kong Fei himself. She wasn’t going to invite the trouble of Kong Fei knocking on her door.

It was not embarrassing to take a crystallizer on as an acolyte, especially one that had received a feather from Kong Fei. It was lucky that Han Sen had met Kong Fei; if he hadn’t, Yisha would have treated him very differently.

The challenge would be a bit difficult, but she was confident She only had to raise him to the Duke level. Even if he was just a pig, she could still turn him into a Duke in three years.

It was because of all these reasons that Han Sen was brought back to the HQ of the Rebate. It was called Narrow Moon. It was a xenogeneic space that was no weaker than Holy Heaven had been. It covered the sky.

Han Sen found out that Yisha was sincere about taking him on as a student, and there was no ulterior motive for doing so. It was all very strange, yes, but he decided on not returning to the sanctuary just yet.

He knew that if he did come back, he’d still be teleported to right where he was. And that would put him in a bad situation, no matter what

“I can’t be sure what is wrong with her, but all in all, I can only suppose it is a good thing. A semi-deified being wants to train me up to the rank of Duke. Such an internship is hard to find! It’s better than her finding me as Dollar, at least.” Han Sen decided to accept the situation and just go with it.

But she didn’t take him as a real student. Everything started with the most basic of routines, and there wasn’t even a ceremony to induct him.

The Knife Queen taking a student was a very important event for the Rebate. Now that she had chosen Han Sen—an outsider—many of the Rebate were wondering what she was up to. He wasn’t one of them, after all.

The Knife Queen had not married or had children. She had never taken a student before, either. So, the presence of this student meant a lot to the Rebate.

Everyone thought that she would soon become deified. It did not matter that she had no children as of yet, as her lifespan still had many years in it.

But the Knife Queen had suddenly taken a student. It made people start to wonder.

Many of the Rebate Nobles and officers wanted to find out why she had accepted this student. They also wished to learn more about who Han Sen was.

They eventually found out that Han Sen was an owner of one of the deified feathers. Thus, the people quickly came to the conclusion that the Knife Queen wished to develop a half-deified alongside her.

But they worried about Han Sen’s talent. He was a non-pure crystallizer, and that meant he was a greater risk than Stay Up Late would be.

Knife Queen didn’t explain much, and she wasn’t going to tell everyone that she had actually taken Han Sen because of a bet. She wasn’t concerned about making him truly powerful. And she was serious about only taking him up as high as a Duke.

Then, it all depended on Han Sen.

Knife Queen’s palace covered half the planet. And it was a much bigger planet than Planet Roca. Han Sen was told to go to a garden located in the palace.

“Yes, Master.”

“Don’t call me Master. Just call me Queen.” Yisha looked at Han Sen. She didn’t like the first title he had used, as that made her sound old.

“Okay, My Queen.” Han Sen nodded.

Han Sen thought that taking an enemy and raising him was unexpectedly nice of her. It was a respectable deed.

“Drink this.” Yisha gave Han Sen a bottle.

“What is this, My Queen?” Han Sen asked.

“It is the geno fluid from a Magnet Fruit. It can make your geno armor evolve. You are currently way too weak. You should focus on becoming a Noble first After that, we can keep going and level you up that way,” Yisha said.
