<p>“What way? Tell me.” Han Sen looked at Speechless with interest
for the first time.</p>
<p>“Galaxy Sand needs to be showered with starlight to be kept
alive. Otherwise, it turns to simple stone in only a few days. I
know when Clear Sea King will bring the sand out, and where he
takes it to be replenished with starlight.” Before Speechless
finished, Han Sen summoned a green tower and sucked her inside.</p>
<p>Entering a King class house and stealing their items was
something Han Sen would do only if he was crazy. Speechless was
only stalling for time.</p>
<p>Han Sen hid all the evidence he might have left at the scene,
but Speechless was supposed to meet with Clear Sea King. If she
didn’t show up, Clear Sea King would notice something was
amiss.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to waste any more time than he had to, so he
scrawled a few words on the ground where he was and then left.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked around the mall, and eventually, Battle King’s
subordinates saw him. On his way back to Mach’s shop, all the
subordinates that belonged to Battle King began to move.</p>
<p>News of Speechless’s kidnapping had already spread. When Clear
Sea King saw the words Han Sen had left on the ground, his face
looked extremely sour.</p>
<p>“Clear Sea King, do not worry. I will take responsibility for
this. I will return the Buddha Lady to you alive, but I want to
find out who is messing around in my territory.” Battle King looked
horribly angry, too.</p>
<p>The enemy had kidnapped a Buddha in his own territory, and had
asked for Galaxy Sand in exchange for her return. It was
humiliating Battle King.</p>
<p>If Battle King hadn’t taken responsibility, Clear Sea King might
have believed he was the one who started all this—to steal the
Galaxy Sand.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! I will let you handle this,” Clear Sea King spoke the
Buddha catchphrase. His face did not change, but he looked
worried.</p>
<p>Battle King might have said he was going to help, but Clear Sea
King was still suspicious of his possible involvement in the
kidnapping.</p>
<p>On Battle King’s planet, someone had kidnapped Speechless in
secret. And furthermore, she was there under Clear Sea King and
Battle King’s protection. Clear Sea King believed that Battle King
must have been the kidnapper.</p>
<p>“Give me one day.” Battle King knew Clear Sea King was
suspicious of him, and so he looked fairly gloomy.</p>
<p>The entire planet started to search for Speechless, all
following a command issued by Battle King himself. But after a
whole lot of time, Speechless went undiscovered. The kidnapper’s
identity was still unknown.</p>
<p>When the investigation concluded, the most suspicious person
they found was Han Sen, who happened to disappear from the watch of
the spies. But Han Sen was just a Viscount, and it seemed
impossible for someone such as that to kidnap someone like
Speechless without making a ruckus.</p>
<p>At a time like this, though, Battle King wasn’t willing to let
the slightest possibility by.</p>
<p>When Han Sen took Little Seven to participate in the next
contest, Battle King’s best subordinate, Blood Kill Duke, took
control of Mach’s store with further subordinates.</p>
<p>Mach was just a businessman with no money. He wouldn’t risk
co-operating with Han Sen, but he informed them of how he and Han
Sen met and did not hide a single thing.</p>
<p>After Han Sen returned from the contest, Mach invited him in.
But when he entered, Blood Kill Duke and his people quickly
surrounded Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Blood Kill Duke brought out a red chain and tied up Han Sen. He
said, “Take him back for interrogation.”</p>
<p>Quickly, Han Sen was brought into Battle King’s house. Little
Seven was taken away.</p>
<p>In a lonely room, Blood Kill Duke looked at Han Sen and coldly
said, “Dollar, if you hand her over now, all will be fine. Don’t
make me do this.”</p>
<p>“You should tell me what you want me to hand over first,” Han
Sen replied.</p>
<p>“Where is Speechless Buddha?” Blood Kill Duke asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“In a safe place!” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Blood Kill Duke was shocked. He did not expect Han Sen to admit
he was responsible, so that was quite unexpected.</p>
<p>After pausing, Blood Kill Duke looked murderous once more. He
shouted, “Hand Speechless over and I will let you live!”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “If you dare touch me, I can assure
you that you’ll never see Speechless again. Why don’t you give your
method a try, and see what Clear Sea King and the Buddha will have
to say about it?”</p>
<p>“This is Meka!” Blood Kill Duke growled.</p>
<p>He shone with a red light, which then flew swdftly down on Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t even blink. He just looked at Blood Kill Duke. He
made no effort to dodge, and he just sat there quietly.</p>
<p>Blood Kill Duke was annoyed, but he knew he couldn’t do
anything. This was something that involved the Buddha.</p>
<p>Things would go badly for him if he messed this up.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Blood Kill Duke asked after he regained his
calm.</p>
<p>“Galaxy Sand. You are too low level to talk to me, though. Give
Clear Sea King a ring and tell him to come over,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget that your life is still in my hands here. I can
make you suffer.” Blood Kill Duke hummed.</p>
<p>“Kill me or give Clear Sea King a shout. It’s your decision,”
Han Sen said, as calm as ever.</p>
<p>In the control room, Clear Sea King and Battle King witnessed
everything. They were surprised to hear he was the one who
kidnapped Speechless Lady.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! Let me talk to him,” Clear Sea King said.</p>
<p>Battle King nodded. Dollar had put him in a pretty bad
situation. He couldn’t kill him, either. It would be best if Clear
Sea King went and talked with him.</p>
<p>Blood Kill Duke was given an order by Battle King, which
prompted him to leave. Then, Clear Sea King came in. Clear Sea King
sat next to Han Sen. He did not say anything to Han Sen, and merely
looked at him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s energy was not outstanding. It didn’t seem too
powerful, but Han Sen didn’t appear to be trying to hide anything,
either. It was like he didn’t care about his own presence, even
when a King was sitting right in front of him.</p>
<p>Han Sen wore armor so Clear Sea King couldn’t recognize his
face. After a while, Clear Sea King said, “How much did they give
you? I can give you ten times more.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “Don’t even think about it. No one
else is behind this. You either kill me and Speechless dies with
me, or you give me Galaxy Sand. Those are your two choices.”</p>
