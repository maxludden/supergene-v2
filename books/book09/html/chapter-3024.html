<p>“No matter how strong Qin Xiu was, he was abandoned by the
world. No matter how hard he tried, he could not gain the approval
of the world. I am different. I have his power, and I have the
genes of God Spirits. It makes me the king of the universe. The
whole universe will serve me.”</p>
<p>It was like Qin Lan was being answered. The whole universe was
resonating with the holy spine. In space, countless numbers of
weird powers went to the holy spine. It made the holy spine and Qin
Lan’s power all the more powerful. It was going to break the
sky.</p>
<p>Littleflower’s power was very shocking. Compared to Qin Lan’s
power now, he was suppressed. It was like a commoner versus a
giant. There was a big difference. Littleflower looked serious. He
did not appear as if he wanted to fall back. His battle spirit was
burning. A black and white flame was rising. It fought against that
scary suppression.</p>
<p>“Go to hell!” The holy spine in Qin Lan’s hands finally moved.
It was like a sharp sword thrusting toward Littleflower’s
heart.</p>
<p>Littleflower wanted to raise his hands and block that strike,
but he suddenly discovered that his body had been locked down by
the universe. He was not able to move.</p>
<p>All of that only happened in a moment. It did not allow
Littleflower to react. The weird spine was thrust into his chest.
Even Sacred Leader’s armor could not withstand the force of the
holy spine. The holy spine pierced through it. “What should have
come has finally arrived.” In an old building upon a mountain, the
fortune-telling old man closed his eyes and sighed.</p>
<p>“Finally… It is starting…” Old Cat, in front of the palace,
looked very excited.</p>
<p>Qin Lan was looking insane and ugly. He was excited as he held
the holy spine and laughed loudly. “So what? Even if it is Qin
Xiu’s armor, so what? Even if you were chosen by Qin Xiu, you are
not as good as me. I am the only one who can be better than Qin
Xiu.” Qin Lan’s madness still wasn’t finished. His expression
suddenly changed. In the next second, his madness and smile turned
into ghastly shock.</p>
<p>Qin Lan was so scared that he screamed. It looked as if he
wanted to get rid of the holy spine in his hands, but he looked
electrified. He could not get rid of it.</p>
<p>Qin Lan’s power was going into the holy spine. The holy spine,
which was in Littleflower’s chest, seemed to melt. It turned into a
blue fluid as it went into Littleflower’s body.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” Qin Lan’s face was severely twisted. He felt
wronged, hopeless, scared, helpless, angry, and hateful.</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>No matter what he thought, he could not get rid of the holy
spine. His body’s lifeforce kept heading for the holy spine. He was
rapidly growing old. His very handsome and young face was suddenly
turning into the face of a middle-aged man. Even his hair was
turning white.</p>
<p>Moment God’s face changed. She gathered up time god power and
tried to strike Han Littleflower. Unfortunately, the time god power
was still quite a way away from Han Littleflower and Qin Lan. It
was like it was falling into endless space. It could not get close
to them.</p>
<p>All the creatures in the universe watched as Qin Lan started to
age. The man who was once an invincible elite had become an old man
with white hair and on his death bed. His lifeforce was extremely
weak. It was like it was hardly there at all.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Qin Lan finally got rid of the holy spine. He fell to the floor,
but he was so old that he could not even get up anymore. He used
his tired, old eyes to look at Han Littleflower.</p>
<p>The holy spine had completely melted and become fluid in
Littleflower’s body. The armor’s broken spot was already fully
healed. Aside from the two black and white lights, Littleflower had
blue power flowing through him. It quickly combined with his
body.</p>
<p>The armor also looked as if it had been dyed blue. The black
armor started to show some weird blue symbols.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A pair of blue wings opened up behind his back. They went all
the way into the nothingness. It was like they connected with the
very universe.</p>
<p>Littleflower’s eyes now looked blue. Moments before, they had
looked murderous. Now, they appeared rather calm. He was even
smiling.</p>
<p>“You… You are… You are… Cough Cough…” The dying Qin Lan saw his
face. His entire body started to shiver and shake. It was like he
had discovered something extremely scary. His eyes opened as far as
they could go. He could not keep talking</p>
<p>“You did a great job. Your work is done here. You did fine.”
Littleflower looked at Qin Lan kindly. It was like some elder who
was complimenting a young man. “Impossible… Impossible… That is
impossible…” Qin Lan seemed to understand something. All the
emotions inside him drove him insane. He tried his best to lift his
old body. He wanted to jump at Littleflower, but he fell to the
ground after taking only two steps. He angrily looked at
Littleflower. At the same time, his face was drenched with a
distinct lack of hope. His hands tried to grab Littleflower, but he
ran out of power. His hands just slumped. His eyes were still
opened wide. He was not able to close them.</p>
<p>“My poor child, you do not have to do this.” Littleflower
sighed. He did not look at Qin Lan. He looked at the geno hall
ahead of him.</p>
<p>In Blood Legion’s palace, Human King stood got up from his
throne. He looked weird as he said, “Qin Xiu really didn’t die.
That Qin Lan was unfortunate. He thought he had discarded Qin Xiu’s
control a long time ago and destroyed Sacred. He had no idea that
was what Qin Xiu wanted all along. If he had not entered the geno
hall and combined his genes with a God Spirit to create the holy
spine, Qin Xiu would not have finished evolving. Now, he is being
repelled by the universe. Who would have thought Sacred’s biggest
traitor was the key to Qin Xiu’s rebirth? Qin Xiu used a body to be
reborn. He has a powerful body and is not repelled by the universe.
He is like those God Spirits. He has the power of the universe…
Very good Qin Xiu… Very powerful conspiracy.”</p>
<p>“God… I… Qin Xiu came back.” Littleflower looked at the geno
hall. He smiled and walked toward it.</p>
<p>Moment God wished to attack, but there was suddenly a loud
booming noise. It was followed by the geno hall’s door opening. A
hand touched her shoulder. She was unable to go out.</p>
<p>“God… Mister…” Moment God turned and looked at the body that was
touching her shoulder. She immediately bowed.</p>
<p>“Go back. Go back to your god temple.” God patted Moment
Goddess’s shoulder and warmly smiled. Moment God politely bowed and
ran back to her Moment God Temple.</p>
<p>The entire universe could see the body that had come out of the
geno hall was the shape of a lady, but it did not have any power.
It was unknown why Moment God was being so nice to her.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo saw the lady’s face. When he did, he was so shocked
that he screamed, “Wan’er!”</p>
