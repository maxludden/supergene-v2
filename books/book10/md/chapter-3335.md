  “You are tricking me,” the purple copper sword said. It was furious. It now knew it had been well and truly duped by Han Sen.

“If wanted to choose a man, so you chose a man,” Han Sen said with a smile. “If you wanted a woman, you should have chosen a woman. I let you pick first. What you are saying now is plain unfair.”

His sensing power was much stronger than the purple copper sword. He had seen the adult woman a long time before. It was the whole reason he decided on doing the bet charade with the purple copper sword.

At this time, Han Sen was not going to confess to anything.

Seeing the purple copper sword not say a word, Han Sen used all of his power to move his jian body and attract the woman.

The woman heard the jian’s moaning sound and walked toward it. When the woman got close to Han Sen, the purple copper sword suddenly started to moan too. It made some crunchy, sword-moaning sounds that ensnared the attention of the woman.

“Holy shit! Han Sen madly exclaimed. “Did you forget the promise you made? Are you not afraid of your son having no ass? Are you going to be happy wearing a green hat for your wife every single day?”

The purple copper sword looked as if it didn’t care. It simply laughed it off and said, “I am not afraid. What is so scary about that? I do not plan on having a wife or a son.”

“You are obscene!” Han Sen felt glum, so he felt compelled to swear.

“I learned that from you,” the purple copper said while merrily laughing.

The jian and the sword moved their bodies in an attempt to attract the woman. After what happened last time, they did not go all in.

Han Sen was thinking about how to attract the woman and get her to go for him first when he suddenly saw the purple copper sword start to glow. It looked like a shining sun.

The light was not very effective, but it exuded an aura and added an extra visual highlight. It was impactful on the eyes. It was not unlike a god sword that was summoning its new master. It attracted the eyeballs of the woman. The woman ended up walking up to the purple copper sword with profound curiosity.

Han Sen frowned. He wanted to release some light and have the woman’s attraction be sent his way instead.

Unfortunately, the pitch-black body of the jian was not able to release any light. Although his geno arts were there and could be used, he was embedded in a stone. Furthermore, he was bound by the rules of Soldier Weapon Sky. Before he could be pulled out, the geno art powers could not be used on the jian.

Plus, the woman kept looking at the purple copper sword over and over. She did not seem to like looking at him. Even if he started to glow, it would have been pointless.

“Weird. How did the purple copper sword achieve that? How can his sword body release a light?” Han Sen watched the woman meander over to the purple copper sword. He did not know how to respond or what to do about it.

“Do you think you can fight against me? You are simply too weak.” The purple copper sword appeared as if it had already achieved victory. It looked at Han Sen cockily.

Han Sen’s heart jumped. He knew he could not glow, but he had spent time with Feng Yin Yin and Feng Fei Fei. As a result, he knew a thing or two about music.

Han Sen’s heart jumped. He increased the vibrations of the jian. This time, the vibrations composed a beat. He made jian moans that were high and low and long and short.

The woman who had been enticed by the purple copper sword started to pick up on the sound that was going with a rhythm. She looked confused as she turned her head. She wanted to find the source of that harmony. She looked at Han Sen’s black jian and seemed surprised. She had just been walking to the purple copper sword, but now she had stopped. She looked at Han Sen and the purple copper sword with an inability to decide between them.

“Do you really have to fight me?” The purple copper sword was very angry.

“You are the one who did not follow the rules. That woman was supposed to be mine.” Han Sen was not going to step back and show weakness.

The jian and the sword were both there. One was making music, and the other was glowing with light. It did not matter which one the woman looked at. They were both special to view. The woman was deep in the throes of hesitation. She looked at Han Sen and purple copper sword. She was unable to decide which one to take.

The two of them were employing tricks. As they were trying to attract the woman, some roaring sounds were heard coming from the forest. The sound made the woman’s face change.

Han Sen and the purple copper sword were shocked by this too. They did not know what was happening. At the same time, they put their senses down on that region and discovered the presence of a big beast that was like a saber-tooth tiger. It was chasing the little girl they had seen before.

The girl’s speed was certainly inferior to that of the big beast, but she was smart. She kept weaving and bobbing her way through the forest as she fled. It made the saber-tooth tiger have a hard time catching her. Just as it seemed he would get her, he always ended up missing.

It was easy to tell that the little girl was running toward Han Sen and the others.

Han Sen had a closer looked. He saw what the girl was planning on doing. She was fast and smart, but she could not escape the big beast in simple flight. He believed there was an 80% to 90% chance that she was running there to draw one of the two weapons to fight the big beast.

“It is no good for you or me to keep fighting right now. This can be our demise. There are two natives here. I will let you be taken first.” The purple copper sword suddenly stopped glowing and moaning.

The woman heard the beast’s roar. She wanted to deal with the threat quickly. She pulled out a weapon. At this time, the purple copper sword had stopped glowing and moaning. He was like a simple, inanimate object. The woman looked at Han Sen.

Han Sen thinking. When the purple copper sword’s voice just spoke, he put away the sounds of the jian as well. He looked more normal than the purple copper sword. He was now looking like a charred fire poker.

Han Sen knew the purple copper sword was not nice. He suddenly gave up and let the woman draw him out of the ground. He did so mostly because of the little girl and fierce beast.

“What the f*ck does that mean?” the purple copper sword angrily asked. “If I do not let you have it, you steal from me. If I let you have it, you don’t want it. Are you purely doing what you are doing to spite me?”

The woman saw the black jian behave like normal and her face changed. She looked around. She heard the roaring sound come closer. She gnashed her teeth and went to the purple copper sword.

Although neither the jian nor the sword looked good right now, the purple copper sword’s style still looked better than Han Sen, who looked like a charred stick. Women often preferred things that were prettier. Thus, the woman picked the purple copper sword.

The woman leaped onto the rock and gripped the handle. She was going to pull out the purple copper sword. The purple copper sword was sad and angry. It yelled, “Get lost! Do not pull me!”

He thought the little girl was scared and wouldn’t come back. That was why he was willing to fight Han Sen for the woman.

Now, the little girl was obviously coming to select a weapon. He wanted to choose the little girl, but the woman was drawing him. The sword was being brought out of the stone inch by inch.
