    <p>
      The cave was rather small, and Han Sen could only crawl. He held back his
      energy and crawled for one hundred meters before reaching the end. This
      was as far as the pangolin had dug, and the creature was still busy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this guy doing?&#8221; Han Sen watched it for a while,
      observing how quickly the pangolin worked. It seemed as if it was digging
      a route into the back of the cave where the ant king was protecting the
      primary entrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It seemed like the ant king was guarding that little cave for a
      reason. There has to be some reason for it doing so; I wonder what it
      could be? Whatever it is, it&#8217;s attractive enough for the pangolin to
      come all this way.&#8221; Han Sen watched the pangolin from a good
      distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not very much later, however, he heard something collapse. It was the
      tumbling of rocks as the pangolin breached through the last bit of wall
      into another cavern. The pangolin quickly entered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his peacock crossbow and loaded it with his raven bolts.
      He crawled along the tunnel, and scrambled over the dusty rocks without
      hesitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen saw what was inside the cave, his jaw dropped and his face
      froze.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant cave was like a warehouse, stocked with white eggs that looked
      like ping-pong balls. Quite clearly, the eggs belonged to the devil ant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pangolin-like creature looked joyful as it began munching on the eggs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen climbed out of the tunnel that had been dug out by the pangolin,
      spooking it. It turned around to look at Han Sen with alarm, but it did
      not attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took aim at the pangolin with the peacock crossbow as a precaution
      but felt conflicted. The pangolin was very strange, he did not know
      anything about it, and his own body was so weak that he didn&#8217;t want
      to start a fight he might not be able to finish.
    </p>

    <p>
      They both froze, eyes locked. Neither of them knew what to think of the
      other. The pangolin rolled its beady eyes and then stood up on two legs
      like a human. Its claws pointed towards the entrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen understood what it meant. The pangolin was pointing towards the
      ant king&#8217;s location, and it did not want Han Sen to alert it to
      their presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This guy&#8217;s intelligence is no less than the fox king I
      encountered in the First Shelter.&#8221; Han Sen gave the pangolin a
      puzzled look.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pangolin then pointed to the eggs on the floor. It pointed to Han Sen,
      and then pointed to itself. It was a funny little creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      But again, Han Sen understood what it was suggesting. It was telling Han
      Sen that there were many eggs for the both of them, and that they were
      free to eat as many as they desired, as long as they didn&#8217;t disturb
      each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the pangolin, then he released his draw of the peacock
      crossbow. The pangolin went down on the ground again and resumed its
      feast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not feel comfortable in the presence of the pangolin. He made
      sure to watch it, in between his observations of the cave and the eggs
      that populated it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ant eggs were all identical. They were white, almost exactly like
      ping-pong balls, and mildly transparent, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was aware that something was amiss. Traditionally, ant eggs
      were laid by ant queens, not ant kings. There had to be something quite
      different about these eggs.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they were the ant king&#8217;s eggs, then they would all be super
      creatures. But there had to be at least one hundred thousand in the cave.
      If they were all super creatures, the devil ant would reign over the
      Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary unopposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they were created by the ant king, they couldn&#8217;t be super
      creatures. They had to be something else.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen stepped on one of the eggs.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Mutant Creature Hunted: Subterranean Devil Ant Baby. The Beast
        Soul Has Not Been Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric
        Amount Of Mutant Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, so these aren&#8217;t super creatures.&#8221; Han Sen then
      stepped on a few more to check. He managed to squish a few more mutant
      variants, as well as ordinary variants. He could not find any sacred-blood
      types, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pangolin must have been confused about this, as well. Sometimes it
      stopped eating, as if to taste-test the quality of what it was consuming.
      The way it rummaged through the eggs suggested it was looking for super
      creature ones, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen bent over and picked up an egg, observing it the best he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were so many ant eggs there that if he ate them willy-nilly like the
      pangolin was, he would never find what he was looking for. Han Sen needed
      to look for a signature, or a way to discern one type of egg from the
      others, to find the super creature eggs that he sought.
    </p>

    <p>
      The eggs were semi-transparent. When he held them in his hands, the eggs
      were quite elastic and felt like jelly, but even more gloopy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ping-pong shaped, circular balls did not smell bad. They were quite
      dry, as well. But when he looked inside, Han Sen could easily observe a
      creamy juice in there. There were no marks on the outside, either; the
      eggs were flawless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen checked out a few more and noticed they were mostly identical, and
      their class could not be concerned by the naked eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ants were smart. By heaping so many similar eggs together, no one was
      able to tell where the most precious ones were hidden.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for Han Sen, things were different. Their appearances were all the
      same, yes. And the difference of their contents was something not even the
      pangolin could discern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen easily figured out its inability to determine which egg possessed
      which ant by the way it picked through them, one by one. Sometimes it put
      them in its mouth, as if taste-testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had his Dongxuan Sutra, with its first gene lock unlocked. He used
      it, and his dongxue aura spread. The lifeforce of the eggs were easily
      detectable to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although they were only eggs, their life forces weren&#8217;t all that
      different than they would be after hatching. Super creatures were super
      creatures, too, so if they were out there somewhere amongst all the other
      eggs, their life forces were sure to shine like a beacon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen scanned all the ant eggs and soon found an egg with a lifeforce
      that was stronger than the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen went there and crushed the egg, which instantly played a
      notification he was eager to hear.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Sacred-Blood Creature Hunted: Subterranean Devil Ant Baby. The
        Beast Soul Has Not Been Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random
        Numeric Amount Of Sacred Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      &#8220;As expected, this is a sacred-blood class egg.&#8221; Han Sen put
      the crushed egg in his mouth and it tasted very fresh, like shrimp. It had
      the bonus of not stinking like seafood, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen kept using his ability to sense the life forces of the eggs and
      continued prowling around the cave in search of more. It wasn&#8217;t long
      before he found three more sacred-blood eggs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, a particular life force stood out to him. It was one that looked
      like a brazier, alight in the dark. The life force was far stronger than
      that of any sacred-blood egg.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have found it!&#8221; With exuberant joy, Han Sen immediately
      went to pick it up.
