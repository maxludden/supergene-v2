<p>“Leader, I have been thinking about it. I’m willing to go to the
Very High. But before that, I would like to speak with Exquisite
alone.” Han Sen went to see Sky Palace Leader and started
explaining the reason for his visit.</p>
<p>“What do you want to say to her?” Sky Palace Leader squinted his
eyes in the direction of Han Sen. He knew Han Sen and Lone Bamboo
were the same. Convincing men like them of anything wasn’t
easy.</p>
<p>“I would like to discuss the terms and conditions of me
accompanying the Very High. I’m an eleven armor talent genius,
after all. It’s okay for me to strike a bargain that will suit me,
right?” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you need. There is a team in Sky Palace that can
fight for the best terms and conditions to benefit you.” Sky Palace
Leader didn’t believe that Han Sen just wanted a better deal.</p>
<p>“There is one aspect of the deal that needs to remain private.
Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. I won’t do anything that will
cause you trouble,” Han Sen said seriously.</p>
<p>“Fine. Go home for now, and I will establish a private meeting
for you.” After Sky Palace Leader said that, he allowed his eyes to
linger on Han Sen for a while. And then, he said, “If you really
don’t want to go, though, you don’t have to. I can deal with the
Very High.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I have decided to go. I thought about it some more,
and I figure that it isn’t a bad deal. It will take one and a half
years for me to recover. If I go there, I can save at least a year.
And I will be given lots of goodies. So, why not?” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>After Han Sen left, Sky Palace Leader looked at Yu Shanxin and
asked, “Do you think he is really going to go to the Very
High?”</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin bowed. “Leader, I cannot guess how Han Sen’s mind
works. But I don’t think he is a liar. I don’t think he will crap
all over Sky Palace, given how we have treated him, and I don’t
think he means us harm.”</p>
<p>“I thought that, too. But this little guy does cause us a lot of
trouble. He’s kind of annoying,” Sky Palace Leader said as he
rubbed his temples.</p>
<p>“Who isn’t annoying when they are young?” Yu Shanxin said with a
smile.</p>
<p>“You are right. You should go and get ready yourself. After
reaching the Very High, your safety comes first. Do what you can,
and don’t push yourself further than that,” Sky Palace Leader
said.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Yu Shanxin bowed.</p>
<p>Han Sen arrived back on his little jade island, and a Sky Palace
butler came to see him shortly after. The man told Han Sen that
Exquisite was going to meet him at the Sky Water House that
night.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed the butler to the Sky Water House. Exquisite
was there, as expected. She was sitting atop a staircase that led
down into a pond. Her feet were in the water, displaying the pale
skin of her legs.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you want. Do you want xenogeneic genes, treasures,
or geno arts?” Exquisite asked, her expression unreadable. On her
face, not a single human-like emotion was visible.</p>
<p>“I don’t want any of those things,” Han Sen said to her, sitting
down next to the pool. He took off his shoes and rolled up his
pants. Just like Exquisite, he allowed his legs to dangle in the
water. A cooling sensation rushed against his feet, prompting Han
Sen to shiver in pleasure. It was like eating ice cream in the
summer.</p>
<p>The water in Sky Water House wasn’t ordinary water. It was blue
water, and it was filled with energy. It was able to quicken the
growth of cells and aid in the rejuvenation of one’s body.</p>
<p>“What do you want then?” Exquisite looked curiously at Han Sen,
who was sitting next to her.</p>
<p>Exquisite had given up on Lone Bamboo and selected Han Sen.
Aside from Han Sen’s talent and power, the most important motivator
was the fact that Li Keer had chosen Dollar.</p>
<p>Dollar had once beaten Lone Bamboo in the Geno Being Scroll. And
Exquisite and Li Keer had both seen Dollar’s power. If she chose
Lone Bamboo, he would always be compared to Dollar. That wouldn’t
be much better.</p>
<p>Li Keer had a ten armor talent. Exquisite had a nine armor
talent. So, Exquisite didn’t want a silkworm that was inferior to
Li Keer’s. That was why she was taking a risk by going for Han
Sen.</p>
<p>If Han Sen really had an eleven armor talent, then her silkworm
would be better than Li Keer’s. If Han Sen’s talent wasn’t great,
she would only lose once. But this way, at least she would have a
chance to win.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Exquisite. After a while, he laughed and said,
“You can use me. But you need to be better than me. Why would I
follow someone who is inferior to me? Don’t you think there is
sound logic to that thought?” “Of course,” Exquisite said. She
wasn’t angry.</p>
<p>“If you think this is right, then it is settled. If you can
convince me, I will follow you to the Very High. If you cannot, can
you leave me and Sky Palace alone?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Exquisite answered with haste. She sounded very
confident.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Exquisite with interest. “How are you going to
convince me?”</p>
<p>Exquisite looked at Han Sen calmly and asked, “What is your best
geno art?”</p>
<p>“Knife skills, I guess.” When Han Sen was Han Sen, he used
knives the most.</p>
<p>“Then let us compete with our knife skills.” Exquisite reached
out her hand. A stream of water rose into her palm in a serpentine
swirl, then formed itself into a knife. “I will sit here, and you
can attack me. If you can make me stand up in one hundred attacks,
you win.”</p>
<p>Exquisite was very confident, which was evident in the way she
had chosen to fight with a water knife. She hadn’t even stood up.
Han Sen smiled. He reached out a hand toward the pond. He sucked up
some of the water to form a water knife of his own.</p>
<p>“Sure. One hundred attacks is the limit. Let us see who stands
up first,” Han Sen said to Exquisite with a smile.</p>
<p>“Please, go ahead,” Exquisite said without argument.</p>
<p>“In my home, ladies always go first. After you.” Han Sen wanted
to see Exquisite’s real power.</p>
<p>Han Sen had traveled with Li Keer and Exquisite for a long
while, but he was never able to accurately gauge their real
power.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Exquisite answered. She didn’t hesitate to attack Han
Sen with the water knife.</p>
<p>She didn’t apply much strength, so the knife didn’t make much
sound as it slid through the air. But even so, Han Sen felt a chill
at the sight. Her knife was coming for his head. Her hand appeared
to be moving in a smooth arc, but Han Sen felt as if he couldn’t
see where the knife was coming from. It was as if the water knife
adhered to the rules of some strangely shifting space.</p>
<p>“Good knife skill,” Han Sen complimented her. He swung his own
water knife, using Teeth Knife’s Fang.</p>
