      “We can’t use this name. Think about his future! What if he becomes a
      president,
    </p>
    <p>
      and everyone refers to him as President Littleflower! It’s a name that
      lacks strength!
    </p>
    <p>Don’t use it.” Luo Lan was the one to reject the name first.</p>
    <p>
      “There’s no need for him to become a president; take it from me. All you
      do is work
    </p>
    <p>
      yourselves rotten. But this name is good! He’ll become famous by simply
      using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Littleflower will have what it takes to conquer the entire universe.”
      Ji Ruozhen
    </p>
    <p>stroked his beard as he spoke.</p>
    <p>
      “Dad, how about we accept it as a nickname and you come up with something
      else?”
    </p>
    <p>Ji Yanran wasn’t very fond of the name, either.</p>
    <p>
      The president had no choice but to concede, and so he told them, “Fine.
      Fine. Lucky
    </p>
    <p>
      for you lot, I have a backup name. It’s not half as good, but you might
      like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that, everyone felt more worried than relieved. Clearly, no one
      wanted Ji
    </p>
    <p>Ruozhen to come up with more names for the baby.</p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen said, “If you really don’t like Littleflower, how about Han
      Fei?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Fei… that’s good. Yes, that is very good!” Everybody agreed this was
      actually a
    </p>
    <p>decent name.</p>
    <p>
      They were grateful he had managed to come up with an ordinary name, for
      they all
    </p>
    <p>
      clenched their backsides when they heard he had come up with another name,
      that
    </p>
    <p>
      was not as good by his standards. They expected him to name the baby Han
      Bigfoot
    </p>
    <p>or something. That really would be awful.</p>
    <p>
      So, after that, it was settled that the baby would be called Han Fei. Its
      unofficial
    </p>
    <p>nickname remained Littleflower.</p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen continued to refer to the baby as Han Littleflower, but
      everyone just
    </p>
    <p>ignored him when he did that.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s house was already full of high-tech AI-driven machinery and
      robots to
    </p>
    <p>
      help out, but Ji Ruozhen insisted on coming over to do what he could,
      despite his
    </p>
    <p>obligations and hefty workload.</p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen’s wife had also moved into Han Sen’s house for a time, under
      the pre-
    </p>
    <p>
      tense of wanting to help out, but more than anything, she was just
      determined to
    </p>
    <p>spend as much time with the baby as she could.</p>
    <p>
      Luo Lan liked kids, but she did not like housework, and since it was her
      home, she
    </p>
    <p>took every chance she could to command Ji Ruozhen’s wife to clean.</p>
    <p>
      While the name Han Fei had been settled on, most people stuck to calling
      him
    </p>
    <p>Littleflower.</p>
    <p>
      The baby was well-behaved, and it never really cried or threw a tantrum.
      It swiftly led
    </p>
    <p>
      to the mother-in-law believing it would one day grow up to be a remarkable
      person
    </p>
    <p>and a shining example.</p>
    <p>
      However, you could not make the baby mad. If you did, the house could end
      up
    </p>
    <p>getting blown to kingdom come.</p>
    <p>
      But the instances of the baby getting mad were very rare, and it only
      happened if
    </p>
    <p>
      people were unusually and unnecessarily cruel to him, like Ji Ruozhen had
      been,
    </p>
    <p>after picking up the baby and slapping it with no cause to.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had nothing much to do in the house, especially with everyone
      crowding
    </p>
    <p>there, so decided to return to the sanctuary for a bit.</p>
    <p>
      “The geno cores level up so slowly, and that aside, I really need to
      generate a geno
    </p>
    <p>
      core for super king spirit mode.” After thinking this, Han Sen traveled to
      a large valley
    </p>
    <p>
      that was far beyond the middle of nowhere. There, he was going to find a
      way in
    </p>
    <p>which he could generate a geno core.</p>
    <p>
      He tried many different methods, but all were to no avail. He ended up
      using his old
    </p>
    <p>
      trick Saving Money. And with it, he began to build up a vast reservoir of
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coin rattled between his fingers as it gathered power, and the numbers
      on the
    </p>
    <p>coin ticked up to the number twenty-seven.</p>
    <p>
      This was all Han Sen’s power multiplied by the figure of twenty-seven.
      Needless to
    </p>
    <p>say, holding that much power was a difficult task.</p>
    <p>But he held onto it firmly, not yet willing to let it go.</p>
    <p>
      When the sum reached thirty, his body began to sweat profusely. It felt as
      if he had
    </p>
    <p>just stepped out of the shower.</p>
    <p>
      When the figure reached forty, the real strain began to settle in. His
      body was
    </p>
    <p>
      trembling like mad, exhausting everything it could to hold onto that
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coin itself was glowing, having trouble containing that might. If it
      buckled and
    </p>
    <p>
      exploded between his fingers, it was highly likely Han Sen could end up
      destroying
    </p>
    <p>himself.</p>
    <p>
      Normally, Han Sen wouldn’t hope to continue past a number this high. But
      on this
    </p>
    <p>
      day, he was genuinely interested in seeing how far he could take Saving
      Money.
    </p>
    <p>
      One-by-one, the figure grew higher. It hit the number fifty. If the power
      contained
    </p>
    <p>
      inside that coin was inside his body, he’d be nothing more than a flash of
      light, and
    </p>
    <p>then nothing at all.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen made sure to hold onto the coin carefully. He didn’t want to risk
      dropping it
    </p>
    <p>on the ground.</p>
    <p>
      With all the power inside that coin, it was becoming incredibly heavy,
      too. Han Sen’s
    </p>
    <p>
      fingers were beginning to creak and make strange sounds as he struggled to
      hold it
    </p>
    <p>up.</p>
    <p>
      When it reached the almighty figure of one hundred, Han Sen knew he
      couldn’t take
    </p>
    <p>
      it any further. The risk was too high and he was beginning to lose control
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to fire his coin and get rid of the power that he had
      bottled up inside
    </p>
    <p>it. Unfortunately, he now realized he was unable to.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen understood the best he could do right now was toss it away
      elsewhere, so it
    </p>
    <p>could explode.</p>
    <p>
      He had decided to use this valley due to the presence of a strange hole
      there. He
    </p>
    <p>
      hadn’t ventured down it before, and truthfully, he did not know precisely
      how deep it
    </p>
    <p>
      was. He only knew that it was deep, and if he had to, he could drop the
      coin down
    </p>
    <p>there and avoid blowing himself up.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t want to kill himself by mishandling the coin, but when Han
      Sen threw
    </p>
    <p>
      the coin out, it really was too heavy. He was only three meters away from
      the hole,
    </p>
    <p>but he felt as if he couldn’t even throw it ten centimeters.</p>
    <p>
      He had to inch his way close to the hole and drop the coin in. Walking
      over towards
    </p>
    <p>
      pit was a struggle, and each step left a crater-like bootprint in the
      earth. The very
    </p>
    <p>core of his bones squealed.</p>
    <p>
      After taking three steps, he had walked three meters. Those three meters
      felt like
    </p>
    <p>three lightyears, however.</p>
    <p>
      “Shit. Am I going to end up blowing myself up?” Han Sen stretched out his
      hand and
    </p>
    <p>watched it fall slowly, under the crushing weight of that coin.</p>
    <p>
      “I shouldn’t have done this. I won’t reach the hole.” The coin was about
      to drop.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      Cracks in the earth began shooting out from Han Sen’s feet. The ground
      could not
    </p>
    <p>
      even handle the initial weight of the coin, and in less than a second, Han
      Sen felt the
    </p>
    <p>earth around him give way. He found himself falling.</p>
