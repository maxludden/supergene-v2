  A copper furnace that was a hundred meters tall connected to the palace in the clouds. It was obvious that the enormous place used to be quite glorious.

But that place was now in ruin. It was empty and quiet Even the sky had abandoned it, leaving the palace dark and forlorn. The darkness veiled that once-wonderful place, giving it no tomorrow.

Around that broken palace, four candles were burning. They gave off a little bit of light, but only in that one small place.

In the darkness, an old red cat was using his teeth to carry a lamp that flickered crudely. They were walking through the darkness, towards the light.

A little boy was lying on top of the creature, fast asleep. He was drooling.

When the old cat reached the palace, a demon-looking beast descended from the sky and landed heavily. Its eyes were like black holes as it spoke angrily to Old Cat. “Nine-Life, you dare return? It looks like you know you will have to pay with your life. I will kill you now, then.”

After that, the beast opened its mouth. It looked like the entire world was going to be swallowed up.

“His life doesn’t belong to you, though. You can’t erase his sins by killing him. I will put him into a loop, so that he will hurt forever. That will erase his sins.” A red beast spoke, stepping out from the darkness.

“You are wrong. His life doesn’t belong to anyone. I will split him into a thousand smaller lives, and then kill one each day. Killing him a different way, each and every day, will surely make him suffer.” A demonic voice boomed from the top of the palace. There was a strange bird with cruel eyes atop it.

“Where’s the fun in that? If this was me, I’d kill him slowly. I would torture him every day, but not grant him the release of death. That is how I can erase my hatred.” A seductive-looking woman walked out of the palace. She looked at Old Cat with hatred. She looked so cold.

“Why are you guys planning on killing me? We are best friends.” Old Cat looked as if he had been wronged.

Roar! The four beasts roared in unison. It was as if they were going to tear the very darkness.

“How dare you say we are your friends. If it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t have suffered so much pain. The Holy Place would not be in such a state. I would like to kill you and drink your blood.” The four beasts surrounded Old Cat, cursing him bitterly.

“Friends! Don’t be like this. I have actually come here to save you.” Old Cat faced the scary creatures while he spoke, a smile still on his lips.

“Save us how?” The woman looked at him with disdain.

Him.” Old Cat would not let the others speak, and immediately, he put Littleflower down.

The four monsters looked at the sleeping Littleflower.

“What is this? Some food you want to share? It doesn’t even look filling, and you expect that it’d make us want to forgive you?” a giant beast coldly said.

“If you eat him, the Holy Place will never again have daylight.” Old Cat stopped smiling, and with a serious look, went on to say, “He will become a Holy Child. He will make the Holy Place have daylight once again. He will make the world feel true fear.”

“Him? Are you joking? You were in the sanctuary for many years. Did being there break your brain?” the woman spoke to him with a look of disdain.

“Nine-Life, do you think you can fool us with your fancy words?” the mean-looking bird said, its voice hard.

The other two beasts roared, filled with the desire to eat Old Cat.

“Are you guys stupid? Look closely and see the difference.” Old Cat was not afraid, and he pointed to Littleflower.

The four of them looked at Littleflower again. The bird opened its wings and flew right before the boy. Its mean-looking eyes looked ready to jump out and touch Littleflower. They were shining with light.

“How? Impossible! How?” The weird bird could not spit out a complete sentence.

The seductive woman saw something, as well. Her eyes looked to be full of shock, and she said, “What did you do to him? How can he possess the Holy God’s power?”

“Idiot!” Old Cat shot back. “As if this was my doing. He learned it!”

“This is impossible! Someone has been able to learn the Holy God’s skills?” The red beast stared at the sleeping Littleflower, looking surprised.

“Now that you guys see it, you can see that it is not impossible. This cannot be a trick. If you guys can raise him, it shouldn’t be hard to recover this place, right?” Old Cat said.

The four demon-looking creatures then forgot about what they had said earlier. No longer did they want to kill Old Cat. The four of them came to surround Littleflower and guard him closely. They looked over Littleflower like he was a sacred treasure.

“Horny Woman, try him. Make sure this isn’t another trick of the Nine-Life,” the strange bird said to the woman. “Yeah, we have to be sure,” the other two beasts agreed.

The woman nodded and lifted her finger. She walked towards Littleflower, emitting a pink light.

Pang!

Before her finger touched Littleflower, a swordlight came out from the boy and extinguished the pink light “It’s real…” Before the woman could even say it, the other three beasts were incredibly excited.

The woman moved her hand, and then, the little boy’s body floated over to her. The woman held Littleflower like it was the most precious thing in the world. Her hands were trembling.

“The Holy Child is back! We have hope once more!”

The roars echoed ceaselessly through the night. It was hard to tell if it was excitement or sadness.
