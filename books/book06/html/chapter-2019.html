<p>Han Sen was going crazy, having to dig through the sand with his
tongue for the job. Han Sen could withstand a lot, but Dream
Beast’s ability to read his mind was particularly annoying.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought of many different ways in which he might be able
to protect his thoughts from the mind-reading ability, but nothing
seemed to work.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave those methods a few tries each, risking punishment.
Before long, though, he noticed that the whole mind-reading thing
wasn’t based on hearing his precise thoughts. The creature would
get an idea of what Han Sen was thinking about, then guess the
rest.</p>
<p>That made Han Sen feel a bit better. If Dream Beast could read
the details of everything in Han Sen’s brain, many secrets would be
revealed.</p>
<p>Because of all this testing, however, Han Sen was punished many
times. The length of time he was supposed to work with Dream Beast
was extended from three months to thirteen months.</p>
<p>After half a month of hard work, Han Sen was given the
opportunity to meet someone.</p>
<p>When he saw Yun Suyi, Han Sen felt as if he had been in jail for
decades. With someone coming to visit him, he almost cried.</p>
<p>“Han Sen? What happened to you?” Yun Suyi looked at Han Sen in
confusion.</p>
<p>“I am fine. Sand has gotten into my eyes, that’s all.” Han Sen
acted like a man, trying to play things cool.</p>
<p>At times, Han Sen would go to ridiculous lengths to save
face.</p>
<p>“Right, well, why have you come to see me?” Han Sen asked Yun
Suyi after he gained control of himself.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi unstrapped a box she had attached to her waist. She
opened it and passed it to Han Sen. “I used the knifeskills you
taught me to win this King class weapon called Blood Feather Knife.
I got it for beating Angia. Half of it is yours, so I have brought
it here for you to take a look at.”</p>
<p>You won the knife. It’s yours. Besides, I have Ghost Teeth
Knife. I don’t require any more,” Han Sen said, but he still took a
look at the blade, anyway.</p>
<p>You are right. You own half of the knife, but I use it,” Yun
Suyi said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“This is quite good.” Han Sen stroked the body of Blood Feather
Knife, and then went on to say, “It is a good knife. It doesn’t
seem as strong as my Ghost Teeth Knife, but the abilities aren’t
compatible with my Teeth Knife stuff anyway. It seems to be very
good for something like Under the Sky.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stroked the blade, and then something burned the tips of
his fingers. He jumped, then looked at the blade more closely.</p>
<p>His fingers had been burned by the bloodmark on the blade. The
blood-red stain was fairly obvious against the white of the
blade.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi explained, “Blood Feather Knife was made from a deified
feather of a Feather Alpha. Before it was complete, however, a
deified xenogeneic came to take it. The xenogeneic was injured, and
the Blood Feather Knife was stained with its blood. The blood
couldn’t be rinsed off the blade, and because of this, the knife
was unable to be deified. It had to settle for being King
class.”</p>
<p>“The Feather Alpha couldn’t wipe the blood off?” Han Sen reached
out his finger and touched the blood markings.</p>
<p>“If it could be wiped off, it wouldn’t be there. And I doubt the
knife would ever have been offered as a gift,” Yun Suyi said.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. His finger touched the blood mark, and there was
that burning feeling again. The crystallized blood in his body
started to melt in response to the heat.</p>
<p>Han Sen pressed his finger to the mark more firmly and cast the
Blood-Pulse Sutra. He felt a trace of blood-tinged air follow his
finger and enter his body.</p>
<p>The blood in Han Sen’s finger touched the bloody air. It was
like fire meeting gasoline. It was going to burn with a flash.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked and happy. All it took was a tiny bit of
blood air to make his blood boil. If Han Sen could absorb all the
blood on the blade, his Blood-Pulse Sutra might be able to reach
Earl status.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Yun Suyi saw Han Sen freeze on the spot, and she
got a little worried. “Han Sen? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated, unsure of what he would need to tell her.</p>
<p>Women were very caring. Seeing Han Sen’s face, Yun Suyi gently
said, “If you need anything, you can tell me. I will help you, if I
am able to.”</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated, and he said, “Suyi, can I play with this
knife for a bit?”</p>
<p>“I thought it was something big. You own this knife, too, so
just take it,” Yun Suyi told him firmly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so happy. He took out his Ghost Teeth Knife and
passed it over to Yun Suyi. “I am taking your Blood Feather Knife
for a bit, so in the meantime, use this Ghost Teeth Knife.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi blushed. She seemed to fall into deep thought, but she
still accepted the knife. She held it uncomfortably and said,
“Okay. I will use this for now.”</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t had anyone to talk to on the island, and he
wanted to continue speaking with Yun Suyi, but Dream Beast reminded
him of his need to collect ten gemstones. If he didn’t, he’d suffer
nightmares forever.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to send Yun Suyi away so that he could return to the
water and collect gemstones with his tongue.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t learn much, but he did craft a skill called Sword
Tongue. It wasn’t powerful, and it was actually really gentle. If
it wasn’t, he wouldn’t have been able to use his tongue to dig
through the sand.</p>
<p>Finding ten gemstones was hard that day, and after he handed
them over, he was tired. Still, he did not let himself rest.</p>
<p>Han Sen took out the Blood Feather Knife from the box he was
given. Then, he placed it on his knees. He touched the mark and
cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He felt a blood air rise from the
blade.</p>
<p>But it was very slow. Han Sen cast it for a while, and he only
took the blood air that was on the surface.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought for a bit, then dripped a drop of his crystal
blood onto the mark on the blade. The crystal blood melted into the
mark and merged with it. You couldn’t see the blood anymore.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He felt the blood air burst
out of the mark. It went into his body, and when it did, his
crystal blood boiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his body was going to be evaporated like
steam. It took seven hours for a portion of the blood air to be
refined.</p>
<p>“This is scary, for just a little blood air to be so strong.
Perhaps a few of these will take my Blood-Pulse Sutra up to Earl
status.” Han Sen was delighted.</p>
<p>After that, before Han Sen went back to work, he used a drop of
his crystal blood on the bloodmark again. After he worked, he’d
come and collect that blood. The blood had the energy of the
xenogeneic, and Han Sen could refine it for hours.</p>
