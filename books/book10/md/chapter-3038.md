“It really is Evil Lotus God’s god temple. Why does this world have the Evil Lotus God’s god temple? What is the difference between the god temples and their existence in both worlds?” Han Sen thought.

Mister Yang had told him that each city in the universe’s kingdoms had a god temple, and the god temples had existed first. The human cities were built around the god temples.

The god temples of this world had incredible powers. They protected the human cities and gave humans impressive Blood-Pulse powers.

While Han Sen pondered things, he saw a commoner queuing ahead of him. Under the gaze of the soldiers, he was allowed entry into the temple. When he was in front of the Evil Lotus God’s god statue, he kneeled on the floor and prayed to the God Spirit. He looked very sincere while doing it.

That commoner was just a teenage boy. He prayed and got up. He went in front of the statue, picked up a dagger from the table, and nicked his finger with the blade. He placed a drop of his blood before a purple stone stove. He nervously watched the purple stone stove.

After a while, the stone stove had no changes. The young man was very hopeful at first. Over time, that hope was depleted. His body shivered and shook. His legs went so soft that he almost collapsed onto the floor.

“Impossible. No way I don’t have God Spirit blood… This must be a mistake… This must be a mistake…” The young man sounded crazed. He then brought the dagger up and cut his hand multiple times. He left every drop of blood fall upon the stove. The blood went everywhere.

The purple stone stove still displayed no reaction to the claret. The young man’s brain did not seem to be clear. He cut his wrist and severed all the veins and arteries he could. It made the blood in his body erupt across the stove like a spring. “I will have God Spirit Blood-Pulse… I must have…” The young man’s eyes turned red. His face was full of fear. He stared at the stone stove.

The stove appeared to be a dead object. In the end, the young man bled dry and fell to the ground. He showed no more motion.

The stove was just a stove. The young man could not hold it any longer. He fell to the ground. He dropped into a coma due to the blood loss. All the while, his blood continued to gush. Everyone had seen this happen, but no one seemed surprised. They were all numb to events like this. They cared little for the young

man.

The young man, who was in a coma, was taken away from the god temple by the soldiers. There were as carefree as if they were moving a dead dog. They threw him in the corner on the floor. No one seemed to whether or he was dead or alive.

The second person to enter the temple was a lady wearing many layers of clothing. She seemed afraid. Her body shook as she entered the god temple, and her head was like a nomadic traveler glancing all around. She was different from the young man. A few family members supporting her entry were outside. They were outside the god temple waving at her. After a while, she mustered the courage to approach the altar. She was just like the young man in that she kneeled before the Evil Lotus God’s god statue. She took out a needle, bit her finger, and poked it. She let a drop of blood fall upon the purple stove.

After the lady let a drop of blood fall, it did not take long for the purple stone stove to glow with god light. The purple light arose from the stone stove. It was like a purple mist. It generated some purple lotus flower lights atop the stone stove.

The lady saw the purple flower lotus light’s shadow and was happy. She cried. Her parents and family members outside were delighted too. They kneeled and expressed major thanks to Evil Lotus God.

The purple flower light left the stone stove and landed on the lady’s forehead. It went in like spring water. A purple flower light symbol was on her forehead. It quickly disappeared.

“Congratulations. You have Evil Lotus God’s blood pulse.” A very cold-looking soldier suddenly smiled. He politely sent the lady out, unlike what had happened with the young man.

“Mister Yang, the lady received the Evil Lotus blood pulse.” Han Sen asked Mister Yang, “What is the level of Ancient God City?”

Mister Yang replied, “God Temples have Destroyed class, Disaster class, Annihilation class, and Reboot class. There are four levels. The higher level the god temple is, the stronger the God Spirit Blood-Pulse they impart. Evil Lotus God is a Destroyed class God Spirit. The God Spirit scene is the lowest level. Evil Lotus God Shadow is a low-level God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Only by doing this can a person go on the path of the gene egg. They earn possibilities and chances. You need that to be regarded as a noble.”

After that Mister Yang sighed and said, “This does not seem to be difficult, but most humans cannot go through this stage. It is like heaven and hell.”

Han Sen nodded, but he looked at the lady. Although she had the Evil Lotus God’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse, her body did not exhibit any changes. Her power did not increase.

The God Spirit Blood-Pulse was like being given a key. It had nothing to do with human strength. The gene eggs and gene races determined a human’s strength. Han Sen saw an old man with grey hair walk into the temple. He was curious and asked, “Why are there old men that are now only taking the Blood-Pulse open test?”

Mister Yang had a strange look as he said, “All of the god temples have different god powers. The people selected might be different in each. If someone did not get the approval of a God Spirit in Evil Lotus God’s god temple, they can go to another god temple and try again. The chance is still slim. Most God Spirits have similar requirements. There is not much difference between them.”

Han Sen watched for a while. Aside from the lady earlier, a few other humans had entered. None of them earned the God Spirit Blood-Pulse.

“Back then, Qin Xiu did not seem to earn a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Wan’er gave him the God Spirit Blood-Pulse. In this world, it seems that you cannot practice without a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. This sounds like a very sad thing.” Han Sen had been watching. He did not understand what the connection between God Spirit Blood-Pulse and human practicing was.

Mister Yang saw Han Sen start to queue. He asked with much shock, “Mister, what are you doing?”

“This is a rare chance,” Han Sen said with a laugh. “I would like to give it a go.”

“You…” Mister Yang wished to say something more, but he immediately pulled his words back.

After queuing for a while, there was an exciting noise. A man was so happy that he screamed. His blood revealed two purple lotus flowers on the stove

“I want to see Evil Lotus God’s god power and see what sort of reaction it has to my blood,” Han Sen thought.

In the plaza, Peaceful was watching all of this. She saw Han Sen queue and appeared surprised. She laughed and said, “I had no idea how to investigate him, but he has gone to the god temple to test. That just helped me.”
