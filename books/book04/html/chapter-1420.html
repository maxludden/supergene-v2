      “Let No God handle him; we will proceed onwards, to the shelter.” Ruin
      Emperor coldly said, and commanded the rest of his subordinates to avoid
      Xie Qing King and head for the human shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Spirits! Are you going to betray the treaty established with The King?!”
      a disdainful voice bellowed across the landscape. And then, many others
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      A blue dinosaur, a knight wreathed with lightning, a lady formed of water,
      and a furry critter that looked like a snowball approached, alongside many
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      A holy-looking rhino was also headed out, and upon it sat a woman. She was
      the one speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman bid for Queen to ascend the rhino, which prompted the creature
      to bestow a healing light upon her. Then, she was as fit as she hadn’t
      been dealt a scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The King may have established a deal with Han Sen, but we signed no such
      treaty,” Ruin Emperor coldly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why waste time with talk? Their elites are here. Kill them and take back
      what is rightfully ours, and let these low-lives know who is the real
      boss.” A big dragon roared in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the army of creatures and spirits began racing towards the shelter
      in unison. Emperors and super creatures went, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land was blanketed by the coming forces, as an endless bastion of
      creatures roared in their charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorn Queen spawned countless vines to lash, impale, and choke the legions
      that ran forward relentlessly. The ground was dyed red with the blood of
      her victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry Bone King brought out his heart bone and began playing the instrument.
      All around, the hearts of the enemies exploded inside their chests as they
      heard the rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water Fairy became a tidal wave of spooky proportions. It did not soak or
      drown the enemies it came across; instead, it stuck to them like jelly,
      then sucked them dry until they scattered like dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blue Dinosaur was a lot less fancy, but just as brutal. He swung his tail
      to crush entire battalions, scooping many up so that he could munch on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baby Ghost, Qing Jun, and Rock Giant rushed forward to do combat, as well.
      And as they did, trails of blood marked their wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly, the spirits came forward to fight Dry Bone King and the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dry Bone King, I have longed to do battle with you. You and me, one on
      one; now is the time we decide which of us is stronger!” A king spirit
      came before him, barking at Dry Bone King with a hammer in each hand. The
      spirit beat the hammers together, and the hammers unleashed a rain of
      thunderbolts which all came bearing down on Dry Bone King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry Bone King froze, and beat the heart bone instrument to summon an
      invisible power to repel the thunder dragon power.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      When the forces struck each other, no sound could be heard. Their clashes
      operated on a frequency that was too high-pitched for anyone there to
      discern.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the shockwaves kicked up were so grand they rattled the earth. Dust,
      soil, mud, and blood were thrown into the air.
    </p>
    <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
    <p>
      While the two of those drummers fought, no creatures could go near them,
      as they destroyed everything. Some creatures around were too slow to leave
      their proximity, and were immediately killed. The ground shook and the
      calls of thunder were frightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Water Fairy, how about taking on me and my water powers?” A female spirit
      appeared to challenge her, casting a sky river towards Water Fairy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rock Giant, let us see if the strength of a mighty creature can compete
      with the power of a spirit. Face me!” a giant spirit said, creating a big
      hole in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruin Emperor, meanwhile, was flying towards the woman atop the Holy Rhino.
      But Purple Emperor cut him off before he could reach her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You dare lay your fingers on me?!” Ruin Emperor had the ability to trap
      and stifle the powers of anything that came into contact with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purple Emperor laughed, swung his purple sword towards Ruin Emperor and
      said, “Why would I not dare?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruin Emperor’s face then swiftly changed, not daring to accept the hit to
      be delivered by Purple Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purple Emperor was fully grown now, and that hit he was to deliver would
      break hell and kill Ruin Emperor for good. So, even Ruin Emperor with his
      Ruin powers would not dare risk getting hit by that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight below continued to rage on, and Queen, having fully recovered,
      wished to rejoin the battle. Luo Lan merely frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a force to be reckoned with, and they could take on any
      indivdual emperor, but there was just too many for them to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry Bone King and Water Fairy were not emperors yet, either; there was
      little they could do to fight and repel the oncoming hordes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Holy Rhino could issue torrents of healing at a consistent rate,
      it still wasn’t enough to keep all their forces healthy and fighting. At
      least they weren’t going to lose swiftly, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many emperors and spirits headed for Zero now, too. They still
      wanted her dead, but she was able to mow them down with her red beams of
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Falsified-Sky powers could also destroy the spirit stones of the
      spirits she slew, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the heir of Godslayer Luo! Even he failed to kill me; do you really
      think a weakling daughter of his, like you, can kill me?” A spirit had
      come prepared. When another spirit was killed, an emperor came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emperor was holding a mirror, and Zero moved forward with her Bone
      Dagger. With that mirror, the emperor was able to block her Falsified-Sky
      powers and she was unable to kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are not strong enough to break my Ten-Life Mirror,” Ten-Life Emperor
      said with disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zero frowned, but did not relent. After she re-stabilized herself, she
      lashed out at the emperor once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ten-Life Emperor is dealing with Godslayer Luo’s heir. In the meantime,
      focus on felling Holy Rhino and the woman atop it!” A command was issued,
      and the majority of the remaining king spirits and emperors turned their
      attention to the rhino.
