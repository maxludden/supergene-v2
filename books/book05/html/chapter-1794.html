<h3>Chapter 1794</h3>

<p>Han Sen frowned, but he didn’t have much of an opinion about
Mister Ji breaking promises.</p>
<p>Mister Ji and Yisha’s purposes were similar, so that did make
them competitors. It was to be expected that they would fight and
trick each other when co-operating.</p>
<p>The reason Han Sen frowned, however, was because of Yisha. He
thought she had agreed too quickly to the idea of luring the Chaos
there, and that she herself was planning to betray them. If they
left now, they might lose an advantage.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was still in thought, a noise came from further
into the oasis. From where they were hiding, they could see Yisha
was running towards them with haste.</p>
<p>Yisha was incredibly fast, but she didn’t look to be too
concerned or rushed. Several arrows flew through the air right past
her. It was a terrifying scene for Han Sen to watch.</p>
<p>Her abilities of movement were not inferior to Han Sen’s own
Dongxuan Movements.</p>
<p>Not far behind Yisha, four Chaos were flapping their wings in
pursuit They had bows, and they were repeatedly firing arrows down
at her. Their power and speed were scary, as well. Inside Demon
Grave, Han Sen was probably much slower than they were.</p>
<p>The Chaos looked just like the artistic renditions he had
previously seen. They were clad in silver armor, and they possessed
butterfly wings. Their bows were forged from wood or sturdy
vines.</p>
<p>Yisha was able to avoid the four of them as she ran back to the
oasis. She hadn’t been dealt an injury, which was rather amazing.
When Yisha ran into the oasis, she followed the current plan and
went for the grapevine.</p>
<p>There were a lot of vines there, and visibility was severely
limited. The Chaos flew down to the ground and began making their
way through the vines.</p>
<p>The backs of their wings were weird. When they were open, they
were open wider than a man with his arms stretched out. When they
closed, they threaded together to look like a cape.</p>
<p>The four Chaos were next to them now. Han Sen looked towards
Mister Ji, who was looking back at him, shaking his head. He was
telling Han Sen not to do anything.</p>
<p>The four Chaos did not notice Han Sen or Mister Ji’s lurking
presences. But after they had passed, Mister Ji signaled for Han
Sen to go to where the Chaos had initially come from.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Mister Ji out of the oasis, but not long after
they left, they heard an angry shriek from behind. The four Chaos
suddenly appeared, coming right for them.</p>
<p>Mister Ji and Han Sen’s hearts jumped. There had been no
fighting in the oasis, and yet, the monsters were now coming right
for them. Yisha was nowhere to be seen, either. That was weird.</p>
<p>They did not know how Yisha had gotten rid of the Chaos, but the
four creatures had obviously reversed direction. They were clearly
coming for Han Sen and Mister Ji now. The pair couldn’t spend much
time thinking it over, though, and so they focused on trying to
run. While they might not have been able to outrun the creatures,
they couldn’t just stand around doing nothing.</p>
<p>After running a few steps, Han Sen quickly realized that they
couldn’t escape this predicament He shouted at Mister Ji and said,
“Run back to the oasis. We can’t proceed like this!”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Mister Ji agreed, and he quickly turned around.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around, too. He wanted to return to the oasis.
There would be foliage and other things that could be used to block
and confuse the creatures.</p>
<p>Han Sen ran for a while, but Mister Ji did not come back. He
kept on running the other way, using Han Sen to get rid of the
Chaos.</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed silent, though, and he did not turn around. He
kept going back towards the oasis. The Chaos were moving incredibly
fast, and Han Sen had been running for a while, hoping to breach
the oasis from another side. All of a sudden, though, he slid to a
stop.</p>
<p>Many arrows came flying forward. Han Sen quickly employed
Heavenly Go and his Dongxuan Movements. As he bobbed to evade each
arrow, he continued heading for the oasis.</p>
<p>The four Chaos had been unable to shoot Han Sen, so they instead
drew their swords and swooped closer. They wanted to stop Han Sen
from entering.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t use his Pirate Bone Sword, though. A xenogeneic
weapon like that would be weaker in such a place. Using it here
would be a great waste, and if it ended up getting broken, that’d
be terrible.</p>
<p>Amidst Han Sen’s dodging, he decided to try to pick up the
wooden arrows that had been fired at him. He threw them back at two
of the Chaos and rolled. Then, he picked up another two wooden
arrows. He threw those at the other two.</p>
<p>The Chaos chopped the approaching arrows down with their wooden
swords and continued after Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed more wooden arrows, using them as melee weapons
to deflect incoming sword strikes.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The sword hit his arrows with devasting force, and Han Sen
stumbled back with bleeding hands. His chest ached and he coughed
up a little blood. Before Han Sen landed, a Chaos was running at
him again with its sword drawn. It wanted to cut Han Sen in two
while he was still in the air.</p>
<p>But Han Sen moved like a bird and avoided the strike. He threw a
wooden arrow toward the two Chaos that were running at him. The two
Chaos swung their swords to cut the arrow down, but suddenly, the
arrow moved low and went past them.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Drillhead could be of benefit since he was using
the arrows at such short-range. But the speed and skill of the two
that came against him now were too much. They dodged the arrow that
had come right before their throats.</p>
<p>“These guys are hard to deal with!” Han Sen thought in his heart
He didn’t stop moving, though. And while those two dealt with the
arrow, he went to face the last Chaos ahead.</p>
<p>That Chaos was a woman. Her wooden sword was not heavy like
those of the other three. She swung her sword like it was a banyan
branch. A multitude of shadows flashed through the air toward Han
Sen, like a net ready to snare him.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not hesitate. If the three Chaos caught up,
escape would be incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Like a ghost, Han Sen headed towards the net with his horn arrow
in hand.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The Viscount rank horn arrow was struck by the wooden sword and
broken. But Han Sen used this chance to escape the sword net And
before he had time to feel sad over his loss, he was headed for the
oasis.</p>
<p>The four Chaos continued shouting angrily, but none were able to
stop Han Sen. And in the midst of the oasis, it was easy for him to
hide. After a few more dodges, he was able to race into the grape
vines.</p>
