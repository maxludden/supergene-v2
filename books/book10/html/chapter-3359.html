<p>“If the old leader of the God Chaos Party was the fairy White
King spoke about, it means that a long, long time ago, the old
leader had already managed to break through the main and the
reverse universes. She had managed to gain access to the geno
universe… Wait…” Han Sen’s brain suddenly lit up as a scary thought
crossed his mind.</p>
<p>“If I say that the God Chaos Party’s leader was a creature that
came from the geno universe…” Han Sen thought the idea he had just
come up with was rather mad. Then again, it was not something that
could be deemed impossible either.</p>
<p>After all, he did not have any facts to confirm his guesses. So,
he stopped thinking about it.</p>
<p>Where the God Chaos Party Leader came from did not seem to
matter too much. Now, Han Sen only wanted to know what gourd seed’s
purpose was and how it would benefit Bao’er. He did not know if it
would be good or bad for her.</p>
<p>Big sky demon saw the book as well, but she merely started
turning its pages gently. As for grabbing the book, that was
something she did not dare do. She was still scared. Although it
was just a statue in that room, she did not want to show any
disrespect.</p>
<p>Big sky demon carefully went around the bed. She started
searching around. She did not search too precisely. Big sky demon
did not go rifling through all she saw. She just observed what she
could.</p>
<p>There was quite a lot of stuff in the hall. There was a bronze
stove, bronze pot, bronze statue, and an instrument. There were
bookshelves and bamboo scrolls. There was a great deal of many
things. Big sky demon looked at them all, but she did not touch any
of them.</p>
<p>When big sky demon saw one thing in particular, her body started
to shiver. She lost her voice as she screamed, “Demon Heart
Stove!”</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to take a peek. He had a gander
at the object that made big sky demon freak out and start shaking
like a madman. It was a seven-inch-wide black metal stove.</p>
<p>The stove was semi-circular and adorned with floral patterns. It
was black. It was unknown what it might have been made of. There
were patterns of mysterious flowers, and it was releasing white
smoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unable to tell what was so great about this thing.
By comparison, big sky demon was really thrilled by it. She was
shaking a lot as she inched her way closer to the object that she
had declared to be a Demon Heart Stove.</p>
<p>She looked very hesitant to approach it. Her hands slowly
reached forward. Han Sen could tell she was making a difficult
decision, but she could not fight back the temptation. She held the
Demon Heart Stove.</p>
<p>“Little Daughter, you are back.” When the Demon Heart Stove was
lifted, a female’s voice was heard in the hall. It sounded lively
and elegant.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>Big sky demon stood still. The Demon Heart Stove she clutched
fell to the ground. She peered behind her with a look of disbelief.
She turned her eyes to the jade statue.</p>
<p>The jade statue was across the bed. It still appeared to be a
stone, but the eyes possessed a life force. The face had a life
force too. It was like the statue was alive. It was smiling at big
sky demon.</p>
<p>“Mister… Mister Leader…” Big Sky Demon jumped in front of the
jade statue and started kneeling before it. She grabbed the hand of
the jade statue but was too crazed to speak words.</p>
<p>“Little Daughter, do not do this. This is one of the last
remnants of my soul. If you are too excited and extinguish this
last bit of my soul, I will be unable to speak to you.” The jade
statue raised its hand and stroked Big Sky Demon’s hair like a
mother who loved her child.</p>
<p>“Mister, can you really not come back?” Big sky demon was always
very flirty and renowned for playing and making fools out of
everyone. She was now wholly different. She was like a little girl
looking at the statue with watery eyes. It was as if she was
praying for an answer.</p>
<p>“Maybe. I am just a shred of a soul, so there are many things I
do not know,” the jade statue said with a sigh. It then asked big
sky demon, “Little Daughter, have you seen my child?”</p>
<p>“I have seen her,” big sky demon said. “She is great and
beautiful. She is like you. She has an incredible array of talents
and has managed to achieve all your grace. In the entire universe,
I do not doubt there are none better than her.”</p>
<p>“Being good might not be a good thing. I would much prefer her
to become an ordinary child and lead a simple life.” When the jade
statue heard big sky demon’s words, she looked weird. She was happy
and proud, but she was also worried.</p>
<p>“Mister, are you worried the geno hall will not accept our
Little Master? Do not worry. If I have guessed things correctly,
the new God Hall Leader knows the identity of Master Bao’er. He has
not tried to do anything to Master Bao’er. Ergo, I do not think you
need to worry too much about it.”</p>
<p>“The child’s name is Bao’er,” the jade statue said softly. It
shone with a motherly light.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is correct,” big sky demon said. “A mixed human took
her as his own and gave her that name.”</p>
<p>“Has that person been treating Bao’er nicely?” the jade statue
asked.</p>
<p>“Good. Very good. He has been treating Master Bao’er like a real
daughter. Master Bao’er loves him very much as well. That is why I
have made no effort to take her away from him.” Big sky demon’s
answers were at least making Han Sen feel a whole lot better.</p>
<p>“That is good to hear.” The jade statue sighed. “It is good if
Master Bao’er is like a normal child. We will not have to worry
about her too much.”</p>
<p>“Mister, what do you mean?” Big sky demon looked at the jade
statue with confusion.</p>
<p>The jade statue sighed. “Bao’er’s body has his genes. No matter
how much the God Spirits of the geno hall hate me, for his sake,
they will not do anything to Bao’er. I do not worry about
them.”</p>
<p>“Are you worried about the God Chaos Party harming the little
master?” Big sky demon enquired.</p>
<p>The jade statue shook her head. “The God Chaos Party has many
elites. Most of them are ambitious, but they are mostly proud and
old. Even Ancient Devil and Bury Path God are too focused on
obtaining the seat of the leader. They care nothing for my
child.”</p>
<p>After pausing, the jade statue’s face looked cocky and proud.
She then said, “With the genes my child has, in this universe, very
few people can hurt her.”</p>
<p>“In that case, what are you worried about?” Big sky demon looked
at the jade statue with confusion.</p>
<p>Aside from the God Chaos Party and the geno hall, she could not
think who might want to harm Bao’er.</p>
<p>“I am worried about a person.” The jade statue went silent. A
while later, she said, “Only that person will be able to hurt
Bao’er. Even if he does not hurt Bao’er pre-emptively, Bao’er will
still have to face him. That is Bao’er’s destiny. She will be
unable to escape this.</p>
<p>“But why? Who is this?” Big sky demon asked with shock. This was
going much further than she expected it to.</p>
<p>“Human Alpha.” The jade statue spoke out these two words very
slowly.</p>
<p>Big sky demon froze. She had never heard of a human with that
name before. Judging from the meaning of the name, there was every
chance it was an alpha of the human race.</p>
<p>According to big sky demon’s knowledge of humans, they did not
have an alpha. In the universe of kingdoms, humans had their own
ancestors that were not the same people.</p>
<p>The jade statue seemed to already know what was now worrying big
sky demon, so she said, “He might not be using that name. Perhaps
he has already reincarnated. I do not know what his name might be
now. No matter how he reincarnates or how great his talent is,
strong or weak, if that person can use my gene prototype armor,
that is the person we are looking for.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard all of that, his heart jumped. A name jumped
into his mind. “Qin Xiu!”</p>
