<p>Han Sen had stopped Bao’er from attacking, but Bury Path God’s
power had hit him hard. Although he used power to resist the impact
of his fall, he still felt as if his bones were hurting something
fierce.</p>
<p>“Dust Sky’s substance chains are so weird,” Han Sen said with a
look of seriousness. “Even Super Spank power is unable to break
them. They would only end up absorbed too. There is likely only one
option to break one of these substance chains.”</p>
<p>Dust Sky’s tai chi substance was like a main and reverse. It was
like two powers combined. The power of the Dongxuan Sutra’s power
only came from the geno universe. It did not really work on the tai
chi substance. To break Dust Sky’s substance chains, he needed the
main and reverse powers combined to do so.</p>
<p>Blood Pulse-Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra combined together to
create a Break World power. That was not great for breaking rules,
and they only focused on a living creature’s power. It would not
work on Dusk Sky’s rule powers. If Han Sen wanted to break Dust
Sky’s substance chains, he had to figure out how to reverse the
Dongxuan Sutra. That way, he could get a Break World power composed
of its main and reverse powers.</p>
<p>Han Sen had yet to make a reverse version of the Dongxuan Sutra.
He did not have a gene race that could practice the reverse
version. Therefore, he had to risk his own body to force the
reversal of the Dongxuan Sutra.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Dongxuan Sutra still had geno armaments. Han
Sen planned on using the geno armaments to cast the main Dongxuan
Sutra. The success rate of reversing the Dongxuan Sutra was low if
he used his own body for it. It was also dangerous. At this rate,
no matter how small the chances of success were, he had no other
choice but to try.</p>
<p>He did not have time to think about how to reverse the Dongxuan
Sutra correctly. He roughly used it in reverse. He suddenly felt as
if his body was given a jolting shock. It felt as if his entire
form was being ripped to shreds.</p>
<p>Han Sen was risking his life to cast the reverse version of
Dongxuan Sutra. That was happening while Bury Path God tried to
tear Wan’er’s soul out through her skull. While Wan’er was enduring
her pain, Han Sen felt his Sea of Soul rattle with a raging
message.</p>
<p>The raging message was strong, but it was different to the
feelings given from the black crystal armor. The black crystal
armor never really did much, and it never really reacted to things.
There were some odd instances it did. Whenever that happened, it
was usually mild. Han Sen had never felt it rage like this
before.</p>
<p>Han Sen had used the black crystal armor to evolve the xuan holy
turtle. Now, the black crystal armor’s power had suddenly reversed.
It no longer provided energy to the xuan holy turtle for the
purposes of evolving it. Instead, it madly absorbed the xuan holy
turtle’s energy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the xuan holy turtle was sucked dry by the black
crystal armor. It turned into dust and vanished. The black crystal
armor revealed itself, eliciting the feelings of a demon god.</p>
<p>This kind of feeling was different to the black crystal armor
Han Sen was familiar with. This feeling was strange and gave him a
sense of familiarity.</p>
<p>“This familiar feeling is… World King God…” Han Sen quickly
understood this familiar feeling and where it came from.</p>
<p>Within that feeling, there was the sense that it was very
similar to the World King God, but it wasn’t the same.</p>
<p>“Does this mean the black crystal armor has Qin Xiu’s will?” Han
Sen’s face changed. He did not think the black crystal armor
belonged to Qin Xiu anyway. The black crystal armor’s style was a
lot more feminine. Han Sen used to feel the presence when it was
activated. That presence was calm and soft, so it felt like a
woman’s presence. It was completely different to the overbearing
feeling given by Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>Han Sen could only guess that Qin Xiu’s will or soul had, for
some reason, entered the black crystal armor.</p>
<p>The black crystal armor emerged from Han Sen’s Sea of Soul. It
had the presence of a demon. It turned and looked at Han Sen,
coldly saying, “It looks like when I am sleeping, you are the one
who owns it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body ran the Dongxuan Sutra in reverse. He could not
spare time talking to him. The black crystal armor was clearly not
interested in talking about it with Han Sen either.</p>
<p>He only said that and vanished. “Is that it?” Bury Path God was
taking Wan’er’s soul away. He suddenly felt something scary coming.
When he heard the voice, his face changed.</p>
<p>Bury Path Sky stared at the black crystal armor and coldly said,
“Qin Xiu, you are still alive.”</p>
<p>“Big Brother!” Wan’er shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>“Wan’er, it’s OK now. Your big brother is here now.” Qin Xiu’s
voice was so soft. Although it was a set of armor that did not have
any emotion, it felt like it could make people feel its
softness.</p>
<p>When Qin Xiu looked at Bury Path God, his voice sounded
incredibly cold as he said, “Bury Path God, get your dirty hands
off her.”</p>
<p>Bury Path God looked at him with disdain. He said, “Qin Xiu, it
looks like you have been away from the universe of kingdoms for too
long. You seem to have forgotten who the owner is here.”</p>
<p>“For as long as I, Qin Xiu, live, there is only one boss,” Qin
Xiu coldly said.</p>
<p>“You are still so ignorant but being ignorant is very funny to
see. It is good that you did not die. According to the terms of our
contract, I helped you enter the other world. In return, you said
you would have to break the 33 skies for me.” Bury Path Sky grabbed
Wan’er’s head and said, “Now, it is time for you and your sister to
pay the price.”</p>
<p>“I always stay true to my word,” Qin Xiu said. “When I said I
was going to help you break through the 3 skies, of course, I was
going to hold up my end of the bargain.” “It is good that you are
going to do what we agreed upon,” Bury Path God coldly looked at
Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at Bury Path God and coldly said, “Of course, I
will, but our deal is not yet done. You dared to hurt Wan’er. What
are we going to do about it?” “I am the best in the 33 skies. So,
what if I hurt her?” Bury Path God spoke with gross disdain.</p>
<p>“So, what?” Qin Xiu laughed. He reached out his hand and
performed a gesture in which he flipped his hand over.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Bury Path God, who was grabbing Wan’er, looked as if
he had been crushed by a mountain. He was sinking and falling into
space. His body fell onto a planet. The ground broke beneath his
feet.</p>
<p>Bury Path God was half-kneeling on the ground. He looked
absolutely terrible. He made a sky-shocking, angry roar. A shocking
rainbow exploded like a volcanic eruption. It was like the whole
world was going to go down with him.</p>
<p>No matter how frightening his body was, he could not lift up the
weight that made him kneel. He gnashed his teeth and made loud
noises, but he could not raise his head at all.</p>
<p>The God Chaos Party headquarters were absolutely silent. They
knew how powerful Bury Path God was. He was someone scary who had
survived a rebooting of a universe. Now, Qin Xiu had only flipped
his hand to suppress their leader. He was unable to lift his legs.
How scary was that?</p>
<p>“Is he really Qin Xiu? He did not used to be that scary.” An
elder who had also survived the rebooting looked shocked.</p>
<p>No one answered him. The God Chaos Party was dead silent.</p>
<p>“Big Brother!” Wan’er leaped into Qin Xiu’s arms. Her body was
so weak that she was almost unable to float through space.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu held onto Wan’er and stroked her hair. “Wan’er, I am
here. You do not have to be afraid. No one will be able to hurt you
anymore. You should go to sleep. When you wake up, everything will
be fine.” After that, Qin Xiu’s hands brushed by Wan’er’s eyes to
close them. She looked relaxed as she went to sleep without any
more worries.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was holding Wan’er, who was now fast asleep. He looked
at Bury Path God and coldly said, “The God Chaos Party has elites
as leaders. From now on, I, Qin Xiu, will be the leader of the God
Chaos Party. Bury Path God, do you obey your new master?”.</p>
<p>“You do not have what it takes.” Bury Path God’s body looked as
if his sleeping willpower had awoken. A scary power exploded.</p>
