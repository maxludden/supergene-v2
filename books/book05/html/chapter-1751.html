<h2>Strange Scene</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1751</h3>

<p>After being called for the first questioning, Han Sen was left
alone by the Feathers.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger had been so scared. He didn’t dare meet-up with Han
Sen again, in fear that the Feathers would suspect collusion. He
wasn’t going to snitch on Han Sen, as he was still very fond of
him. It was just a sensitive matter, and one that he couldn’t do
anything about.</p>
<p>He was not allowed to leave Gran City, so any news concerning
xenogeneics in the area was pointless. There were no xenogeneics in
the city, only existed beyond its borders.</p>
<p>Han Sen spent his time practicing the Dongxuan Sutra, hoping to
generate its geno armor.</p>
<p>Due to Jadeskin not having any further progression available,
Han Sen could not practice it. If he wanted it to continue, he’d
have to forge something first, but he didn’t have the time to do
that.</p>
<p>Han Sen also searched for information regarding the Nine Life
Cat on the internet. All he could learn was based on myth, and
there was no mention about whether or not such a race existed. And
where they originally lived, he was not told. If Han Sen wanted to
locate the Nine-Life Cat, he didn’t know where to start So, Han Sen
chose to focus on leveling up, first.</p>
<p>Han Sen could deal with Barons, no sweat. He was quite a high
level in the western Gran City, but when compared to the universe
at large, he was still rather weak.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew he most certainly could not deal with the Feather
called Xina.</p>
<p>It was time for food, and Qiao was looking particularly tired
that day. She didn’t say a word. She couldn’t hunt xenogeneics, and
it was taking its toll.</p>
<p>As she ate, the doorbell rang. The auntie opened the door, and
Lan Se came strolling in.</p>
<p>“Qiao, be careful. Do not go outside,” Lan Se quickly said to
Qiao, coming right in.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Qiao raised her head to look at Lan Se, and
she asked in confusion.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bao’er looked at Lan Se, unsure what was
happening.</p>
<p>“A great many outsiders have come to Gran City. They don’t look
like they’re of a normal race, so something must be going on,” Lan
Se said.</p>
<p>“It sounds to me as if something big is going to happen soon. I
am curious why two small Feathers would visit this backwater city.
They tried to steal our xenogeneic and got killed for it It’s all
too weird. What is going on these days?” Qiao quietly said.</p>
<p>“No matter what it is, it’s definitely not something we can take
part in. My supervisor ordered us not to provoke them. If something
happened, I’m afraid our entire department won’t be able to stop it
So, it’s best to stay home,” Lan Se said.</p>
<p>Qiao was looking more and more disheartened, and she said, “Han
Sen can’t leave town now, anyway. We can’t do anything.”</p>
<p>After Lan Se left, Han Sen retreated into thought. He didn’t
know what had happened to prompt a visit from so many outsiders,
either.</p>
<p>“It is a shame I don’t have my usual intel. I have no clue about
what is going on. Maybe there is something I can get out of it,
though,” Han Sen thought to himself, wondering if he could grab an
outsider and ask.</p>
<p>But thinking of that female Feather Xina, Han Sen quickly
discarded the idea. If she knew he was up to something, it wouldn’t
bode well.</p>
<p>Two days later, when Lan Se returned again, she looked terrible.
She warned Qiao and Han Sen not to go out if it wasn’t absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>Qiao asked about what was happening, and Lan Se told them of a
strange scene unfolding in Gran City. Many people were dying.</p>
<p>In an abandoned mine on the west side, a big hole had opened. It
seemed bottomless. At night, however, there was the sound of a
crying woman. And from that hole, a light would shine.</p>
<p>Many people were drawn there to take a look, but those who
visited the place at night never returned. No bodies had been
recovered, either.</p>
<p>It was only safe to go there during the daytime, when there was
no curious light and no crying woman.</p>
<p>The security department sent a drone down into the hole, and for
the first few hundred meters, there was only stone to see. But if
the drone went deeper than a thousand meters, it would also
disappear and be lost to recovery.</p>
<p>The supervisor had given orders to evacuate the place. The
officers were warning residents to stay far away from the
place.</p>
<p>The outsiders in the city had shown great interest in that
place. They all showed up there now, mainly. Very infrequently were
they seen scouring the city.</p>
<p>Two days later, more strange things were reported to have
happened. The buildings near the hole suddenly collapsed, and all
the scrap metal in the rubble was dragged into the hole.</p>
<p>Two days after again, even stranger things occurred. The cars
around, the billboards, and everything else made of metal was drawn
into that hole.</p>
<p>The western end of Gran City, even portions that were rather far
from the hole, were affected by this. Pots and pans, knives and
forks, whatever metal items there were, were drawn to the hole. It
was like they were being pulled away by a magnet. The suction
wasn’t very strong, but it caused panic in the city.</p>
<p>Han Sen was curious about the black hole, but he couldn’t figure
out how he might go and see it.</p>
<p>In the world full of darkness, Littleflower was sitting on a
bronze throne. There was a table before him, laden with fruit</p>
<p>“Holy Child, try this. It takes thirty thousand years to grow,
and another thirty thousand years to mature. And it also takes
thirty thousand to prepare the fruit. It tastes extra sweet.” A red
beast was trying to feed Littleflower fruit.</p>
<p>Littleflower looked at the red fruit and seemed depressed. He
said, “Jade King, I cannot eat. Can you help me?”</p>
<p>“You have to eat. You are growing up, so it is fine to eat a
lot. And there is also an Empty Fruit that has been growing for the
past billion years for you. There is also the Dragon Saliva fruit.”
An evil-looking woman peeled the fruit, setting it down next to
Littleflower. She smiled.</p>
<p>“Ah, Auntie. I cannot eat anymore.” Littleflower burped, and
looked to be in pain as he rubbed his belly.</p>
<p>“If you cannot eat, then exercise. Eat again once you have
digested what you’ve currently got. Old Vulture, it is your turn to
teach him,” Auntie Mei spoke to a bird.</p>
<p>“Holy Child, let us begin.” Old Vulture flapped his wings and
brought Littleflower to a plaza. He placed him down on the floor.
Then, his black feathers turned into a dark rain of arrows, firing
at the child.</p>
<p>Littleflower held his belly as he dodged the strikes. He looked
very depressed.</p>
