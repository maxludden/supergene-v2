<p>Han Sen was not in a rush to chase after Steel Scene. He threw a
punch toward Lu San Zhi.</p>
<p>Lu San Zhi was already heavily injured. He was unable to block
the strike. With all of the guards and workers there, Han Sen was
still able to kill him with one strike via his blood dragon flying
into the sky weird scene.</p>
<p>The blood dragon flying into the sky weird scene was a very
overbearing gene combine skill. The blood god dragon was still in
juvenile mode, but it was still very strong. It was able to kill
every opponent that stood in its way. If the blood god dragon
reached ultimate mode, Han Sen could not fathom how scary of a
creature it would become.</p>
<p>Many guards and workers were terrified in Steel Manor. Ice Snow
City was far away from Jade Wall City. Teleporters were required to
go there.</p>
<p>Jade Wall City was connected with that planet, and it was the
base of operations for the king’s guard. No one had ever dared to
stir up trouble there before.</p>
<p>Now, someone was doing just that. He had gone to Steel Manor and
made a god-blood noble like Steel Scene escape into his god temple.
How scary was Han Sen? They were not able to imagine it.</p>
<p>The guards and workers knew they were unable to fight, but they
still went to tackle Han Sen. No one chose to run away. The Qin
Kingdom was different from the other six kingdoms. Once upon a
time, the Qin Kingdom had almost conquered the entire universe.
When Qin Xiu vanished, it became weaker and was almost destroyed by
another kingdom.</p>
<p>After that, the Big Qin Kingdom established a system of laws
that the previous kingdom’s era did not have. A
reward-and-punishment system was put in place. It made the Qin
Kingdom go from being bad to strong. In the river of time, it was
unknown how many kingdoms had risen and fallen, but the Qin Kingdom
was still developing. It had become one of the seven big kingdoms.
Its law was one of its greatest accomplishments.</p>
<p>The laws of the Qin Kingdom were far from perfect. The nobles
had many special authorities. Compared to the other kingdoms, it
was a special case. No matter if a person was a commoner or a
noble, if a person spoke, there were laws. They were proud of the
laws. Even the current was always challenged by his subordinates
due to the law system.</p>
<p>The Qin Kingdom’s laws had a nice side, but there was a cruel
side. If the guards and workers had decided to run off, they would
not have been the only ones punished. Their families also would
have been punished. It was hard to fathom that kind of cruelty.</p>
<p>Many people preferred dying to having their families killed.
Therefore, they expected to die in this battle.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood that. He also did not want to have needless
amounts of blood on his hands. After he killed Lu San Zhi, the big
dragon on his fists roared. It blasted a path toward the Ice Snow
God Temple.</p>
<p>The 3,000 sets of steel armor could not block the blood dragon
flying into the sky weird scene’s overbearing power. They tried
blocking ahead of him, but it blasted a path through all of those
guards and workers. No one was able to stand before him and
prohibit his advance.</p>
<p>Steel Scene had already escaped and retreated into Ice Snow God
Temple. He wiped the blood from his face and donned a murderous
look.</p>
<p>The Steel family were all god-blood nobles, and three
generations of that family had been in charge of protecting Jade
Wall City. They were the generals of the king’s guard. Their
authority was very high. They had never been humiliated like this
before. Now, someone was coming after him and beating him.</p>
<p>Steel Scene was very angry. He wanted to kill Han Sen. After he
went to the god temple, he cut open his hand and let the blood drip
onto the stone stove on the god altar. He kneeled before Ice Snow
Goddess and prayed. He activated his ice snow God Spirit
Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>Ice Snow Goddess’s statue was like a crystal made of jade or
some fairy from a cold palace. White veils obscured her face. No
one was able to clearly see her face.</p>
<p>Only her eyes showed, which made people feel her holiness.
People never dared to stare. It was like setting their eyes on her
was blasphemy.</p>
<p>Steel Scene’s body had ice and snow air rising from it. It was
like fire shooting into the sky. The god stove emitted an icy fire.
That statue looked as if it was being summoned into existence. It
reacted with Steel Scene and the god stove. It released scary ice
and snow air.</p>
<p>Invisible light slowly showed up on the god statue. It was like
an ice snow goddess was emerging from a godly place. It had
infinite power surging through it. The whole of the Ice Snow God
Temple was frozen because of the power. Everything had a layer of
ice. Even the air appeared to be frozen. Feeling that scary
presence, Steel Scene was very happy. He raised his head and looked
upon the god statue. The Ice Snow Goddess’s light was clear. It was
above the god stove. It was like it was looking down on
everyone.</p>
<p>Steel Scene quickly kowtowed before Ice Snow Goddess and
implored, “Steel family’s ninth generation’s Sun Steel Scene, I beg
for you to combine with me and defeat an enemy,”</p>
<p>Ice Snow Goddess had granted the Steel family a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. She was the guardian of the Steel family, as well as a
partner to the Steel family. As a matter of fact, Ice Snow Goddess
was more like the god that the Steel family prayed to. Aside from
the first generation, when the Steel family’s alpha was given
approval by Ice Snow Goddess, other family members had to make a
request if they wanted to combine with Ice Snow Goddess. They were
not able to control it.</p>
<p>“According to the ancient contract, I grant you unlimited god
power until the world ends,” a cold, godly voice said. Ice Snow
Goddess’s light descended on Steel Scene.</p>
<p>Ice Snow Goddess’s God Spirit body turned into ice light snow
air. It went into Steel Scene’s head. He accepted the invasion of
scary power. He stood up and released a cold flame.</p>
<p>Han Sen entered the Ice Snow God Temple. He saw Steel Scene had
combined with Ice Snow Goddess.</p>
<p>Steel Scene stood in front of the god altar. His head had an icy
flame. A God Spirit, which looked like ice light, had ascended. He
wore icy armor. A crystal-looking snow crown was on his head.</p>
<p>Steel Scene heard the sound of Han Sen entering. He turned
around and looked at the door. When he saw Han Sen, he quickly
became murderous. He stared at Han Sen and madly said, “You only
have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, yet you act so cocky. Today, I will
let you know who was chosen by a god. I will let you see the real
person who was chosen by a god. The Qin Kingdom’s laws will not be
able to deal with you, and I cannot have you. You must live. You
must live to watch me break your Blood-Pulse and skin you alive.”
Steel Scene bit his teeth as he spoke. He was very angry.
Throughout the Steel family’s nine generations, they had never been
humiliated before. He could not accept that slander. If he did not
rip Han Sen apart, the Steel family would be embarrassed. How could
he stand before Jade Wall City like that?</p>
<p>He was the leader of the king’s guard. If he could not protect
his home, how was he supposed to protect Jade Wall City?</p>
<p>Steel Scene was furious, but he felt Ice Snow Goddess’s power on
him deplete. It was strange. The ice armor and crown melted
away.</p>
<p>The Ice Snow Goddess, which had almost finished the combination
process, quickly escaped his body. She floated above the altar.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Steel Scene was shocked. He looked at the shadow
of the Ice Snow Goddess upon the altar. In the Steel family’s
history, this had never happened before.</p>
<p>Ice Snow Goddess did not answer. She did not even look at him.
She flew to the ground and walked before Han Sen. She bowed and
lowered her head to him. “Greetings, Mister, I am Ice Snow
Goddess.”</p>
