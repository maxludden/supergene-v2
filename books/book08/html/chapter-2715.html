<h2>Gru’s Invitation</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2715</h3>

<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s eyes brightened with a thought. “I don’t
have access to the creatures of the sanctuary, but there are
xenogeneics within range. If I grab one and use it to test the
crystal, it might yield the same results.”</p>
<p>Once Han Sen decided what to do, he didn’t have to go far to
test his theory. He would just grab a King class Star Beetle from
the Star Tree.</p>
<p>Han Sen arrived at the Star Tree a short time later, but after
half a day of searching, he failed to find a single Star Beetle.
Since Star Beetles were no longer an option, Han Sen tried to
decide where else he might look.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Star Beetles aren’t back yet,” he murmured to
himself. “I guess I will forget about continuing my search for
them.”</p>
<p>Han Sen jerked his head up as he noticed a presence approaching
the Star Tree. When the distant figure drew closer, he recognized
that it was Gru from the Extreme King.</p>
<p>“This is the Star Tree. Without the leader’s permission, you
cannot enter here,” Han Sen said, blocking Gru’s passage.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen didn’t actually have to warn the man. There was
a seal around the Star Tree already. If any creature entered the
area without permission, an alarm would be triggered.</p>
<p>“I was looking for you at Underworld Lake,” Gru answered. “I
couldn’t find you there, so I thought you might be here. It looks
like I was correct.”</p>
<p>“Why have you come looking for me?” Han Sen asked, keeping his
face carefully neutral.</p>
<p>There was a deep-seated grudge between him and the Extreme King.
If an Extreme King like Gru had come looking for him, that was
reason enough for him to be wary.</p>
<p>Gru smiled. “Please don’t misunderstand me. I mean no harm. My
people do have a grudge with you, but not all of us think it is a
matter that must be resolved with bloodshed.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew instantly what Gru meant. There were many factions
within the Extreme King. The strongest faction was the Bai
family—the group led by King Bai. There was also the Bao faction,
which Han Sen had recently become familiar with. They were from
King Bao’s bloodline. Although they were no longer true royalty,
the Bao family still had a lot of influence over the hearts and
minds of the Extreme King. There were other groups in addition to
those two noble factions, as well. The political situation within
the Extreme King was quite complicated, and being an outsider, Han
Sen had never been able to fully grasp the way things worked
there.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know which faction Gru belonged to, but it
sounded as if his party had little interest in troubling Han Sen.
Or at the very least, they weren’t interested in actively starting
a conflict.</p>
<p>“What is it, then?” Han Sen had almost killed Gru in the
silkworm bout. He didn’t think Gru would be generous enough to
forget about all that and come over for a nice conversation.</p>
<p>Gru looked serious as he said, “I have found a lone primitive
deified. I’m not confident in my ability to kill it by myself, so I
was hoping we could kill it together.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound like a good idea,” Han Sen said after some
hesitation.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no trust between the two men. And on top of
that, they had been enemies the last time they met. Even if they
were friendly with each other, it was always difficult for two
people to decide how to split the loot obtained from slaying a
deified creature.</p>
<p>Gru could see what Han Sen was worrying about, and so he said,
“You might not believe me, but I truly mean you no harm. I actually
admire you, truth be told. That’s why I am inviting you to slay a
xenogeneic with me. I can’t do it myself, and I would like to see
your knife skills again. I want to learn from you. In regards to
the loot, that’s no cause for concern. Whatever rewards we obtain,
we can split them evenly between us. Half and half.”</p>
<p>Han Sen gazed at Gru without speaking. He was still
hesitating.</p>
<p>There were outliers like Gru among the Extreme King, people who
truly weren’t bothered by who Han Sen was or the things he had
done. However, Han Sen had no way of finding out if Gru truly felt
that way. This might be some secret ploy for revenge. If he went
with Gru, he might be walking into a trap. After spending some more
time thinking about it, Han Sen decided to reject Gru’s offer. “I’m
sorry, but I have other things to do. I can’t go and hunt
xenogeneics with you.”</p>
<p>Gru looked disappointed, but he understood what Han Sen was
worried about. He nodded and said, “Then I won’t try to force you
to join me. If you decide that you want to hunt a xenogeneic, you
can always come and find me.”</p>
<p>After watching Gru take his leave, Han Sen pulled out a map of
Outer Sky. The entirety of Outer Sky was far too large to be
represented by such a small map, so only a small part of the domain
had been drawn. It included the living quarters of the Very High,
the Star Tree, and Underworld Lake. Those were places Han Sen was
already familiar with.</p>
<p>There were some markings on it that Han Sen had never visited,
though. They referred to places where scary xenogeneics could be
found.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the map for a while. He found a place close to
the Star Tree that was called Full Moon River. He decided to go
there to grab a King class xenogeneic to test the black
crystal.</p>
<p>He had briefly considered swallowing the black crystal to test
it on himself, but he had quickly concluded taking such a rash
action would be foolish.</p>
<p>There were many scary xenogeneics in Outer Sky, but places that
were close to the living spaces of the Very High only had
xenogeneics that were King class and below. Full Moon River was one
such place. There were no deifieds there, but the river region did
contain many Kings. One of them would be perfect for Han Sen to
capture and use as a test subject.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew in over Full Moon River, examining the area from
high in the sky. The nearby terrain rolled in a series of low-lying
hills that spread far away from the river.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just arrived at the Full Moon River when he saw
a rhino xenogeneic standing atop a cliff. The snow-white creature
was staring down the ravine. Han Sen couldn’t tell what it was
looking for.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed the beast’s gaze, but there were only clouds
down below. They were too thick for anything to be seen through
them.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was wondering what was going on, he saw some
movement within the clouds. A new xenogeneic, which looked like
some strange hybrid of a fish and a snake, flew out of the
clouds.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic was like a giant snake with horns on its head. It
didn’t have any claws, but wings spread from its back. It was a
very odd-looking creature. When it flew out of the clouds, it
screamed at the rhino that was on the cliff.</p>
<p>The rhino and the flying snake were soon fighting on the
cliffside. Han Sen could see that neither of them was very strong.
They were just second or third tier Kings. This fight wouldn’t be
very interesting to watch. He planned to wait until one was injured
before he picked one and conducted his test.</p>
<p>But after Han Sen watched them for a while, he was given a
shock.</p>
<p>The rhino’s skin was super thick, and it had the power to
petrify. It was so hard that it was like nothing Han Sen had ever
seen at that level. But the weird snake’s area power was also a
surprise.</p>
<p>The weird snake was also white. Its body wasn’t made out of the
jade-like material that composed the rhino, but it glowed with some
sort of blurry light. The light formed a large seal around it.</p>
<p>Within that seal, regardless of how much damage the rhino dealt
to it, the snake could heal all wounds. In fact, its injuries
closed so quickly that Han Sen could barely track the healing power
with his eyes.</p>
<p>“There is an area power that heals?” Han Sen murmured to
himself. That sort of area power was rare.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, why are you here?” Han Sen was continuing to focus on
the fight when, out of the corner of his eye, he saw someone flying
toward him. The figure was waving to him from afar. It was Gru,
whom he had just turned away earlier.</p>
<p>“I’m here on business. Why are you here?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“The deified xenogeneic I mentioned is around here. Since you
said you were busy, I thought I would go and try to take it down
myself. I didn’t expect to meet you here, though. What a
coincidence.” Gru smiled.</p>
