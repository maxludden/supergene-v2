<p>In the ice bunker’s testing room, Han Sen looked weird.</p>
<p>“About that, Teacher Han, can that really make me control blue
blood power?” Han Sen stood atop an ice platform with one leg. He
raised his hands to balance himself out. He looked like an old
chicken standing. He had been doing this for more than 10 hours
now. Han Yufei forced him to stand like that the entire time. She
did not allow him to do anything else. She hadn’t injected him with
any geno fluids or anything of the sort either. She hadn’t taught
him a new geno art, which made Han Sen very suspicious.</p>
<p>“Is this not enough? In that case, I should add some more,” Han
Yufei replied. She placed an apple on Han Sen’s head. She lifted
her black-framed glasses and squinted her eyes. “Control your body.
Keep it from moving.”</p>
<p>“Teacher Han, is this really going to work?” Han Sen wondered.
He thought Han Yufei was playing with him. If standing there
allowed him to control the blue blood power, why would she need
high-class research apparatus? Sacred Leader’s many years of
research appeared to be going to waste.</p>
<p>Han Yufei coldly asked, “Do you know what still means?”</p>
<p>Han Sen said, “I have learned many skills to train my patience.
The geno arts I have practiced can enable me to control my own
skills. I am confident about this.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Yufei was holding a thin and long stick. She
pointed at Han Sen’s chest and poked it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was very still. It was like a mountain. He did
not move.</p>
<p>Han Yufei pulled the stick back and asked Han Sen, “Did you feel
anything with those two pokes?”</p>
<p>“Pain,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“Anything else?” Han Yufei asked.</p>
<p>“What else could I possibly feel?” Han Sen was confused.</p>
<p>Han Yufei was holding her stick. She knocked Han Sen’s chest
with it.</p>
<p>“So, you do not understand your body. You cannot even describe
your feelings. Creatures of a high-level have bodily functions that
are complicated. They have many systems inside them. Pain is just a
simple feeling, but there are more changes and layers to it. You
did not use your feelings to feel it. When the stick goes down, the
clothes and your skin hit each other. When it goes against your
skin, and when your muscles cave in and bounce back and your cells
hurt, the small veins break. Did you really feel all that?”</p>
<p>Han Sen gulped his saliva. Although he controlled every inch of
his muscles perfectly with the Dongxuan Aura, looking at himself
and feeling himself was something he never bothered to do.</p>
<p>“Use your heart to feel your body’s small feelings,” Han Yufei
seriously said. “Make your body become absolutely still. If you can
do that, it will be the time you can control the blue blood.”</p>
<p>Han Sen started to believe Han Yufei, so he seriously asked,
“What does being absolutely still mean?”</p>
<p>“You make your body’s organs stop running,” Han Yufei explained.
“Everything stops. That will be you becoming absolutely still.”</p>
<p>“If my body completely shuts down, that means I am dead,” Han
Sen said with a frown. Although making his heart stop jumping and
blood stop flowing was not difficult for Han Sen, if his body’s
functions completely shut down, that meant he was dead.</p>
<p>“Stopping does not mean dying. Becoming absolutely just means
that your body becomes absolutely still. It does not mean your
lifeforce is still. I told you that you wouldn’t understand. You
need to feel it. When your heart stops and your body is as still as
a mirror, that means you have succeeded.” Han Yufei used her stick
to smack Han Sen’s butt and said, “Keep practicing. You do not have
much time.”</p>
<p>Han Sen used his heart to feel that strike. When the stick hit
his clothes, they pressed down on his hair. It made the hair rub
against his skin. It gave him an itch. He then felt the clothes and
skin rub each other. Next, he felt his skin and his vessels feel
the pain.</p>
<p>When the pain appeared, the blood inside was pressed. It made
him feel swollen. It was clearly in Han Sen’s brain. That
complicated feeling could not be described in one simple word
called “pain.”</p>
<p>Han Yufei walked to her seat and sat down. She spoke to Dragon
Lady and said, “You are very good at hitting people.” “I am only
good at making food,” Dragon Lady quietly said.</p>
<p>“Treat him like a slab of pork and go cook him.” Han Yufei
crossed her long, pretty legs and drank some tea as she spoke.</p>
<p>“What if I cooked it?” Dragon Lady asked.</p>
<p>“If his body, which has Sacred blood, is so easily cooked, then
I can only say he deserved it,” Han Yufei said.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady did not say anything. She walked over to Han Sen and
raised her hands. Her hands held two knives. The one on the left
was curved like a crescent moon, and the other was like half a
moon.</p>
<p>One of those two knives was for cutting through bone. The other
was to slice meat. For a chef, every blade had a different use.</p>
<p>“Hey, you guys cannot be serious.” Han Sen looked at Dragon Lady
approaching him without the smallest flicker of emotion. He felt a
chill.</p>
<p>His body was very strong, but she had Ancient God King blood.
She was already a true god and not weak. If the knives were to come
down, a very strong body would not be able to withstand the
strike.</p>
<p>“Of course, I am serious. The body is yours, but feelings cannot
be triggered on their own. You must have some other power outside
to affect your body. When your body reacts, you can really
understand your body. It is like a dumb kid that never went outside
and never experienced gambling or drinking. He has never
experienced what is good and what is bad.” Han Yufei tried to
slightly explain it. Han Sen felt as if what Han Yufei was trying
to tell him made sense, but the description was weird.</p>
<p>“Take his clothes off first in case he makes them dirty,” Han
Yufei said to Dragon Lady, who was right next to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady did not speak. She waved a knife and cut open the
blue robe he was wearing. The robe slid down. The knife made a few
“katcha” sounds. Han Sen’s clothes were cut. They all fell to the
floor.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed he only had his underwear left and yelled, “That
is enough… That is enough…”</p>
<p>Dragon Lady looked at Han Yufei. Han Yufei did not raise her
head as she asked, “When you are cooking pork, do you leave the
cloth on it?”</p>
<p>“No,” Dragon Lady answered. She waved her knife and Han Sen’s
underwear fell off.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder why this is a body that is combined with Sacred
blood. Not bad,” Han Yufei squinted her eyes to admire Han Sen’s
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to say something, but the bone-cutting knife in
Dragon Lady’s left hand stabbed into his body. It made him take a
deep breath. It hurt. His eyelids were quivering. He almost
screamed.</p>
<p>“Do not move,” Han Yufei said without emotion. “Use your heart
to feel your body.”</p>
