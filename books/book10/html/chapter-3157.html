<p>When it came to dealing with positive and negative skills, the biggest problem was striking a fine balance. The power of the Xuan Yellow Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra had to be perfectly balanced if they were to be merged. That was integral. In the universe of kingdoms, Han Sen was unable to use the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power unless he broke the rules of suppression that dictated the world. Breaking the rules was the only way he could use of Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>

<p>Even so, in a situation in which one power received support from the rules of the world and the other was repelled by the powers of the world, wanting to strike a perfect balance between the two powers was extraordinarily difficult.</p>

<p>Because of God’s warning, Han Sen did not want to destroy the rules of the world. That had become obvious. Thus, his careful practice wasn’t yielding many results.</p>

<p>While Han Sen was practicing a servant of the Feng family came running up to him and informed him about the peculiar guest. “Mister Han, I believe there is a Mister called Rock that wants to see you. He told me that he wishes to talk about some business exchange with you or something like that.”</p>

<p>“Bring him to the conference room,” Han Sen quietly said. When Han Sen went to the conference room, he saw a man waiting there.</p>

<p>That man was wearing a black suit. His entire body and image were strikingly tidy. His suit did not have any wrinkles. His shoes were as polished as the surface of a mirror. Atop his head was a black top hat. When he looked at the face beneath the brim of the top hat, the most impressive thing to see was two mustaches.</p>

<p>People who had a beard usually were dirty and wild. This man had two little black mustaches that made people think they were suitable on his face. Without those two little mustaches, he would have looked less manly.</p>

<p>With those two little mustaches, the man was very attractive and mature. His eyes were as black as the night. It gave the man a charm and allure that was difficult to describe.</p>

<p>When Han Sen looked at the man, he had to confess that his first impression was him being a man who left a good impression.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mister Han. I am Rocky Dee. It is nice to meet you.” The man saw Han Sen walk in, so he stood up. He took off his top hat and brought his other hand forward to shake with him.</p>

<p>He was very polite. Being appreciative of his manners, Han Sen saw no reason to reject a nice, friendly handshake. Therefore, he merrily shook Rocky Dee’s hand.</p>

<p>He could not help but immediately remark how Rocky Dee was such a gentleman when it came to the art of shaking hands. His touch on Han Sen’s hands was very gentle, and the shake was graceful. He shook Han Sen’s hands softly and let go. Han Sen let Rocky Dee sit down before asking, “So, why you have come all this way looking for little old me?”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee replied, “Mister Han, it has come to our attention that you recently killed Decapitation Queen of my God Chaos Party. It is because of this villainous act that the leader has asked me to come here in search of compensation.”</p>

<p>“Oh? What sort of compensation should I give you?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>

<p>He was not shocked because Rocky Dee was from God Chaos Party, as there were weirder things than that. It was really strange to know that Rocky Dee had simply come looking for him in such a fashion.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee seriously said, “There is a saying that if you take a life, you pay back with life. If you owe someone money, you pay them back with money. The God Chaos Party has been fair. You killed Decapitation Queen, so we lost a good member. We hope you, Mister Han, can join the God Chaos Party to replace her position and call things even.”</p>

<p>“That sounds fair, but I am not interested in joining the God Chaos Party,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee was not aggravated by the rejection. He maintained his elegance and smiled. “That is okay. If you do not think that will work, I have another suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Tell me.” Han Sen looked at Rocky Dee with interest.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee looked sincere as he said, “If you keep working for the party, it will be hard for you. Decapitation Queen was one of our core members. She cannot have died for nothing. So, I have a way to resolve this. You must do three things for the God Chaos Party. Accomplish these tasks, and we will call things even. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“What three tasks do you have in mind?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee said, “I don’t know yet. But do not worry, the God Chaos Party will never force someone to do something impossible. It will be something within your capabilities.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, I never agree to things I don’t know the details of,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee dimly looked at Han Sen and asked, “Does that mean you are not planning to compensate us for what you owe?”</p>

<p>“I owe people many things. If I was to pay everyone back, I would die many times over. How could I still be alive?” Han Sen did not plan on agreeing. He just nodded.</p>

<p>“I hope you rethink this decision. If you change your mind, call this number. This number will work before midnight.” Rocky Dee gave Han Sen a card and said, “Excuse me.”</p>

<p>After all that, Rocky Dee put his top hat back on, patted his clothes down, and exited the room.</p>

<p>“Be polite first and then be mean. This God Chaos Party is interesting.” Han Sen looked at the card.</p>

<p>The card was made of black metal. Rocky Dee’s name was written on it. There was a number on the back, and below, there were a few words. It said, “God Chaos Party’s Minister of Foreign Affairs.”</p>

<p>He turned the metal card over. There were no words on the backside. There was just the symbol of a clown.</p>

<p>When Han Sen saw the symbol, it looked familiar. He had seen that somewhere before, but he did not remember where.</p>

<p>The clown symbol was dark red. It looked as if it was jumping or running. Its face was turned 90 degrees, so it was looking forward.</p>

<p>Atop its head was a clown hat. The clown’s eyes were like moons. Its lips were up. It had a weird smile that made people feel rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought he had seen this clown symbol before. He was certain of it.</p>

<p>As he held the card, he tried to remember where he saw it. After a while of brainstorming, he recalled where he had last seen that symbol.</p>

<p>In the beginning, he, Exquisite, and Li Keer had entered a crystallizer laboratory in the core area. He had spent some time there with the big and small Crocodile Gods.</p>

<p>It was there that he discovered many crystal cans the crystallizers used for their tests. It was there Han Sen saw the remains of an arm. It was on that arm there was the tattoo of a clown.</p>

<p>“No. It was not just similar. It was the same. I remember the size was almost similar. Is that just a coincidence?” Han Sen thought it was weird. He looked at the clown symbol as he receded into deep contemplation.</p>

<p>He remembered the arm and bones had some text. The content stated, “M67 test subject has mutated. The test results are unknown. Number 7586 core created god plan failed.” It was some information like that.</p>
