      Guardian Spirit looked at Golden Growler in shock, and it was obvious he
      was thinking about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dragon Lady, you try as well,” Han Sen said to her. He didn’t have much
      hope she’d be successful, but he did hope he’d be able to take a few of
      the armors back with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he also summoned Little Angel. If Golden Growler had been
      able to catalyze that reaction with the armor, there was a chance Little
      Angel could do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Golden, try to fetch the others,” Han Sen asked Golden Growler, feeling
      greedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden Growler, though, was unable to gain the approval of the others.
      Perhaps he was only able to forge a connection with the golden armor, or
      perhaps it was only possible for him to take one away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Little Angel moved to claim an armor, though, a geno armor came to
      her. It went flying off the wall, carried by a holy light The holy light
      was immediately absorbed by Little Angel’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s not fair! How does that happen?” Han Sen looked at Little Angel’s
      holy light. It had become entwined with the geno armor she was now
      wearing. With the increased volume of holy light all around her, she
      looked even more angelic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady was just as unfortunate as Han Sen. She tried many of the geno
      armors, but failed each and every time. But just as it looked as if she
      was going to fail as many times as he had, Dragon Lady touched one armor
      in specific. It burst into flames and blended into her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Damn! This sucks. Why can’t I have them? This is impossible.” Han Sen
      wanted to try touching the geno armor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results were the same, though. No matter how hard Han Sen tried, he
      could not get the approval necessary to take the armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guardian Spirit looked at Golden Growler, Little Angel, and Dragon Lady,
      and spoke. “Roar’s geno armor, Marily’s armor, and Imir’s armor. Not bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen just looked depressed. He comforted himself by saying, “These
      armors must have belonged to the losers of the crew. That’s okay; I
      wouldn’t want them anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go. This is a hopeless place. Do not come back.” Guardian Spirit began
      speaking again with his creepy voice.
    </p>
    <p>“Are you a crystallizer?” Han Sen asked Guardian Spirit.</p>
    <p>
      “I am dead. It does not matter who I was.” After he said that, the gates
      of the Hero’s Spirit Hall suddenly opened. Then, a strong force of suction
      pulled them all the way out of there.
    </p>
    <p>Crash!</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and the others were dropped to the ground. When they stood back
      up, they were on the plain they had reached before smashing through the
      wall that led to the hidden place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen stood up and touched the wall again. It was a cold rock, and
      nothing more. They could no longer get back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen flew up and over the mountain. He realized with shock that the
      mountain was situated right atop the plain. There was only grass beyond
      it, and there were no ruins, tablets, or a Hero’s Spirit Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it wasn’t for Golden Growler still wearing his geno armor, Han Sen
      would have believed that entire sequence to be some bizarre dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now unable to locate Blood Dog and the ruins, which meant
      leveling up Dragon Lady had been a failed venture. Fortunately, she’d get
      another chance in the near future, and there was no need to rush it too
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the fact she had obtained a geno armor made up for that. It may have
      been a little weary-looking, but it was a great find all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after leaving the ruins, the glow of the geno armors vanished. It
      seemed as if they had lost their powers. They couldn’t be summoned in the
      general areas of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen tried to clear his mind and think about these matters seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ruin must not have originated in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, and Han
      Sen believed it must have belonged to the Fifth Sanctuary that existed in
      the Alliance’s universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something must have occurred in the Alliance’s universe, in which many
      things were destroyed. Similar to whatever had made a mess of Stay Up
      Late’s control room. The same fate must have befallen the stone tablets
      and Hero’s Spirit Hall. They must have been scattered across the
      sanctuaries. The Valley of Time might very well have been one of those
      places, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What happened there?” Han Sen did not have much information to go off of,
      though, so an absolute solution was not obtainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the shelter, Han Sen now wished to return to the Alliance. But he
      overheard Cheap Sheep and Green Cow in the midst of a discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I really want to take a look! It must be scary and exciting at the same
      time.” The sheepish character sounded rather hyped.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brother Sheep, where did Death Goddess come from? She killed one of the
      ten Son of God’s, Illusion Emperor. If she had joined Divinity’s Bout,
      perhaps she could have fought against Dollar.” Green Cow moo’d.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She couldn’t fight against Dollar, win, and obtain first place. Second
      place, sure. But I really can’t believe she managed to kill Illusion
      Emperor with just one arrow. Her power must have been greater than Armored
      Man’s,” Sheep said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It does not matter how strong she is; she is alone. Her killing Illusion
      Emperor prompted the folk of Illusion to rally all sorts of elites to
      unify and kill her. I have heard they hired two super elite alphas,” Green
      Cow said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep nodded. “Illusion knows a lot of people. Their alpha is
      begging other alphas for help, and they will get it. But even if they
      didn’t get the assistance of the other alphas, they’d be sent some sort of
      help. And I actually heard Illusion Elder found a way to kill her. If she
      doesn’t relent, she is going to die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If she knew to relent, she wouldn’t have been so bold as to tackle
      Illusion the way she did. She provoked the emperor and killed him. She is
      strong to be able to kill him, but the alpha did not come out to fight
      her. And now, after all this time, he has a found a way to do it and has
      thus asked so many elites to rally so that they can all kill her
      together,” Green Cow sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a shame we are too weak to participate. She could probably kill us
      with a mean stare. Still, I’d like to go and watch. It’ll take ten
      thousand years to witness another event like this unfold.” Cheap Sheep
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed Han Sen, and while they did have good stuff to eat, they
      were simply born too weak. They only had gold geno cores, and they had yet
      to reach gemstone class.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cheap Sheep, where will the Illusion alpha plan to kill Death Goddess?”
      Han Sen walked out and asked the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought this entire thing sounded slightly weird. After Death Goddess
      was born, she did not know she was the Sacred alpha’s heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the people in Sacred should have recognized her. She had been out and
      about for a long time, and yet, strangely, the folk from Sacred had not
      gone out in search of her. That was strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boss, it’ll be happening near Sunset Valley. The whole Fourth God’s
      Sanctuary should know, as many elites were invited by Illusion to go
      there,” Cheap Sheep quickly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow said, “That Death Goddess is way too cocky. She knows they are
      going to surround her there, and yet she hasn’t changed course. She is
      going to die.”
