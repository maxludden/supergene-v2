  "Sister, is the warframe force you're going to join called Daphne?" Han Sen looked at the information AI displayed incredulously.

"Daphne? We're supposed to go to the royal warframe force." Wang Mengmeng looked to the display without doubt and was also shocked by the information.

It clearly said that Han Sen was assigned to the cookhouse of Warship Daphne.

"So strange. Did they make a mistake?" Wang Mengmeng became anxious and dialed a number with her comlink. Shortly, Wang Mengmeng had an odd look on her face.

"Who did this?" Han Sen asked calmly.

The information displayed was very weird. It did not tell him about the exact location or even the number of the troops. All he knew was that he was going to serve at the cookhouse of a warship called Daphne.

A major who graduated from a military school was assigned to a cookhouse. That was rare but possible. However, it was only possible for the several top warships in the Alliance, which did not include Daphne.

Han Sen would not believe it if no one had tempered his assignment.

"I don't know. The connections I used were not able to do anything. Your assignment was decided by the central AI. No one could change it without top authority." Wang Mengmeng suddenly stared her eyes wide and looked at him, "Brother, did you ask anyone to do this?"

"If it were me, I would not have asked you who it was." Han Sen pondered and asked, "Is it possible for me to find out who did this?"

Wang Mengmeng shook her head, looking confused, and said, "We do not have enough authority to access that information. However, only a few people would be able to do this."

"Is it possible that Starry Group was behind it?" Han Sen asked again.

"That is unlikely. Although the Nings had some influence in the military, they would not have such high authority. And we would be able to know it if it were them," Wang Mengmeng shook her head and said.

"Then there is no need to think about it. I'm okay with any post. If someone wanted me to go there, I'll go have a look." Han Sen had a relaxed attitude about it, since he would not be able to resist someone who could pull this anyway. In addition, the authorities of the Alliance were always law-abiding. He did not worry that anyone would harm him.

"Even the cookhouse needs a major. I wonder what kind of place Daphne is." Han Sen even felt expectant.

He still had three months before registering at his assigned post. Han Sen planned to utilize the period of time to max out his super geno points. It would be ideal if he could evolve before serving in the military. Fortunately, Han Sen was only three sacred-blood geno points away from maxing out, thanks to the meat Lin Beifeng provided him with.

During the three months, Han Sen could choose to stay in Blackhawk or go home. The roommates of 304 had a last supper with Wang Mengmeng and her friends.

Everyone was feeling a bit sentimental. In the end, they went to a holographic karaoke. Shi Zhikang sang a song called "The Brother Who Shared My Bunkbed," which made the girls wet their eyes.

"Brothers, our time had just begun. On the way to conquer the universe, we will meet again. When we see each other, I hope you will still remember my face, because everywhere else of my body would be decorated with medals…" Zhang Yang jumped on the table and exclaimed in the microphone.

All Han Sen remembered was that he had a lot to drink and so did everyone else. In the end they hugged each other, shouting and jumping, singing the song called "My Future Is Not a Dream." Han Sen did not remember much other than that.

Although he was able to stay sober using Jadeskin, Han Sen chose not to do that. Sometimes, he did not need to be sober in life, and this was one of those times.

I know my future is not a dream

I care for each minute

My future is not a dream

My heart beats with hope

I know my future is not a dream

I care for each minute

My future is not a dream

My heart beats with hope

…

When Han Sen left Blackhawk, he did not tell any of his friends, but walked out of the gate alone. Looking back to the place where he had studied and lived for four years. Even Han Sen felt emotional.

The sadness of leaving and the eagerness of reuniting with his family made it hard to tell whether he was happy or sad.

"My life has just begun…" Han Sen turned and left, walking into the space harbor and boarded the spaceship that was going to take him back home.

There was no place like home. Han Sen felt the saying was so true, as the days he spent at home were the most comfortable in years.

Eating and chatting with his mother and sister, watching games with Zhang Danfeng, Han Sen felt on top of the world. There were some people in the world that could still be the most intimate ones in his life despite the longest separation.

Initially, Han Sen was worried that the Nings would look for trouble, but they did nothing. Han Sen had been using the aqua reaper to watch Ning Yue and had some ideas about what the Nings were doing. After learning about the relationship between Han Sen and Instructor Han, the entire clan were surprised. They only did some investigation and forbade anyone to mess with the Hans.

Han Sen was very curious what Instructor Han did back in the days to make the Nings terrified of him until now.

Thirteen sacred-blood evolvers were not easy to cultivate even for a large corporation such as Starry Group. They must have spent a lot of money and effort on it.

The disappearance of thirteen good fighters did not even make the Nings retaliate. They even asked everyone to avoid conflicts with Han Sen, which made Han Sen feel quite surprised.

However, Han Sen also felt more at ease. At least he did not need to worry about the safety of his family when he hunted super creatures in God's Sanctuary.

The first target was naturally the fire bird on the snow mountain. Before leaving, Han Sen still made a lot of preparation. He had to max out his super geno points as much as possible before registering at Daphne, which would take more than just the fire bird.

"Little birdie, here I come." Han Sen set out on his way riding the golden growler, feeling quite excited.

When there was no one around, Han Sen commanded golden growler to turn into its largest form and run at full speed. Han Sen could not even begin to describe how fast it was. Each step it took would bring Han Sen 50 feet closer to his destination. Han Sen felt the golden growler was some kind of ancient monster.

With the golden growler, Han Sen was confident that he could hunt a lot of super creatures within three months. Otherwise, it would take him a lot of time to just travel.
