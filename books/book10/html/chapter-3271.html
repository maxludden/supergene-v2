<p>Seeing Zhao Ning’er turned into a white god bird. As she
approached the gene egg, she suddenly saw a knife air rise up not
too far from the coast. It suddenly slashed in front of Bury Path
God to almost hit the gene egg.</p>
<p>Bury Path God looked into the sky and put the gene egg away. His
other hand became a fist that was thrown forward in a punch to hit
the sword air.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The punching power hit the sword air. Bury Path God’s body was
shaken backward. The power created a shockwave. It created a large
wave in the sea like chains.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er was now a white god bird, and the clarity of her
actions was improved. She flew toward Zhao Qiu Yi.</p>
<p>Zhao Qiu Yi was both shocked and happy. She looked to where the
sword air had come from. She saw a man arrive via the beach. It was
Han Sen, who she had previously let go.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, how dare you come back!” Bury Path God pulled his fist
back. He looked at Han Sen as he spoke. “I never left, so I am not
coming back.” Han Sen continued stepping forward. His sword air
became more and more powerful. His sword mind became stronger with
every step closer he took.</p>
<p>Bury Path God did not move. He looked at Zhao Ning’er, who had
become a white god bird. He said, “If you did not leave, then
stay.”</p>
<p>After that, Bury Path God exploded. The gene egg in his right
hand glowed. It was like a sun shining brightly through the sky and
across the earth. The god bird shadow of the gene egg exploded. One
bird sound shocked the sky and the ground.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er had almost reached Zhao Qiu Yi’s position through
flight. When she heard that bird sound, though, her body shook. She
was unable to control herself. She flapped her wings and flew
toward the gene egg again. Han Sen frowned. He moved 10 fingers and
became a sword air, messily headed for Bury Path God.</p>
<p>“No one can stop her from becoming a Break World beast,” Bury
Path God coldly said. The space around him started to fall. When
Han Sen’s sword air came close, it got stuck in it. It became
buried in the fallen space. Nothing could be done about it.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er, who was a white god bird, flew very fast. Seeing
she was about to reach the gene egg that looked like a glowing sun,
Zhao Qiu Yi looked antsy and angry. She did not care for her own
well-being as she raced into the sky after her sister. She was not
as fast as Zhao Ning’er, who had now transformed to become a white
god bird. She was unable to catch up with her.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Bury Path God. He drew his Inch Grey Sword.
Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power gathered atop the blade of the
Inch Grey Sword. The sword was like a light as it was wielded.</p>
<p>The sword light went across the space in front of Bury Path God.
The fallen space was cut open by the sword light. Bury Path God’s
body flickered. Although he was able to dodge the sword light, the
clothes across his chest were given a long swipe. It revealed his
naked chest and the slight brush of a sword that had swept across
it.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder why this is the old leader’s sword.” Bury Path
God’s face did not change. He complimented the Inch Grey Sword, but
he never talked about Han Sen’s sword skills. It was as if Han Sen
was not worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care for the snub. He grabbed Zhao Ning’er, who
was now a white god bird, and pulled her away.</p>
<p>Bury Path God extended one of his fingers to stroke the wound
across his chest. His wound was healed by that finger as if he had
simply zipped his skin up.</p>
<p>Bury Path God said, “You are not bad. It is a shame she already
has the mark of the God Chaos Party. No one will be able to prevent
her from becoming a Break World beast.” He placed the gene egg out
in front of him.</p>
<p>The gene egg’s light became dimmer. Han Sen saw that the fire
inside the gene egg was like a burning white candle.</p>
<p>Because of the burning, the white candle itself had almost
completely gone away. With Bury Path God’s power, the little bit of
candle left was burnt. The gene egg’s flame was put out. At the
same time, Zhao Ning’er, who had been grabbed by Han Sen and had a
white god bird body, collapsed. She turned into white dots and flew
toward the gene egg. Han Sen frowned. He could not stop anything
from happening.</p>
<p>When the white dots went into the gene egg, the gene egg lit up.
The white light generated a god bird that looked like a
phoenix.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The god bird was formed. The gene egg’s crystal-like shell was
shattered. A white god bird phoenix flew out of it, spreading its
wings. Its presence was very scary.</p>
<p>The sound of a bird ripped space. Scary shockwaves went across
the planet. Everything that touched the shockwave became dust. Even
the sea turned into a sea of sand.</p>
<p>“It worked!” Bury Path God was happy about that. He reached out
his hand and grabbed the neck of the white god bird. When Bury Path
God tightened his hands, the body of the white god bird burned. It
changed, giving it the head of a harp.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, it is your lucky day. You have been able to witness
the birth of a Break World beast. I will let you try this asking
heart phoenix head harp.” Bury Path God held the phoenix head harp.
He placed his fingers on the strings and started to play it.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>The sonic powers came out from the harp. The harp only produced
one sound. In Han Sen’s ears, it was like countless God Spirits
were screaming at him.</p>
<p>“Does God exist? Is Han Jinzhi my great-grandad? What does Qin
Xiu want?” The voice was his. It was interrogations from the
deepest reaches of his soul. The many questions Han Sen wanted
answered did not even have an answer. The questions and desires
were dredged up by the godly sounds. They echoed through his head
like thunder. It was getting louder and louder. It was almost
enough to make him deaf.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed he could no longer move. He was turning to dust.
His skin started to look like sand.</p>
<p>The power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra could not prohibit his body
from changing.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Dongxuan Sutra to change the rules of the
power. He was barely able to block the sonic power. He could not
stop the sounds of the harp.</p>
<p>The sounds of the harp tortured his heart. They kept corroding
his heart. They corroded the Dongxuan Sutra.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew this was not because the Dongxuan Sutra was weak.
It was just that his Break World powers weren’t enough. His
Dongxuan Sutra had only just managed to break the world. The
phoenix head harp’s power was above the Break World materialization
and level. It was a higher level than a demon god sword. It was two
levels higher than the Dongxuan Sutra.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Sutra could usually go against something higher
than it. It could temporarily block the phoenix sound, so it was
already powerful “A Break World beast is so strong when it becomes
a Break World weapon. A Break World beast has only just been
created, yet the power is like a level-three elite. If…” Bury Path
God’s eyes looked excited. He looked at Han Sen, suffering in his
enduring of the harp’s power. It prompted Bury Path God to coldly
say, “Dying at the hands of a Break World weapon means you are
lucky, so just die!”</p>
<p>While he was talking, Bury Path God played his harp again.</p>
<p>This time, he plucked more than just one string. He plucked a
few of them. Scary shockwaves went everywhere, covering the sky and
ground around Han Sen.</p>
