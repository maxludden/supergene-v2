    <p>
      &#8220;Wait a second.&#8221; Han Sen commanded the group to stop, summoned
      the golden rock worm king, and commanded it to fly into the gates of the
      shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Very soon, the golden rock worm king returned. The message brought back to
      Han Sen was that there was nothing in the spirit shelter, not a single
      creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nothing?&#8221; Han Sen frowned slightly. The situation was clearly
      out of his expectation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The group marched toward the architecture and looked around vigilantly.
      However, they found nothing. It was as if the entire spirit shelter was
      empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having reached the destination smoothly, Han Sen pushed open the gates and
      walked into the hall that looked like a palace. Indeed, there was a spirit
      stone with an alluring glow set between the eyebrows of a huge statue of
      deity.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Spirit stone!&#8221; Xu You and other young men became excited. As
      long as the spirit stone was destroyed, the spirit would be dead no matter
      where it was. However, before they even walked to the spirit stone, a
      figure suddenly appeared from the side of the room. It was an elegant
      woman dressed like a priest, holding an ice staff in her hand. It was the
      same aristocrat spirit that Han Sen had seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Attention,&#8221; yelled Uncle Qing and summoned his beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Actually, even without Uncle Qing&#8217;s waring, everyone had already
      summoned their beast souls and looked around vigilantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit looked at the group of people, smiled coldly, and raised the
      staff in her hand. Light suddenly covered her body, turning her into an
      aristocrat fighter in ice armor with red patterns. The staff turned into
      an ice spear.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Roar!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Almost immediately, all sorts of creatures came to the empty castle.
      Hundreds and thousands of ice-armored beasts and other creatures besieged
      the hall, throwing themselves at the intruders.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go deeper and destroy the spirit stone,&#8221; Uncle Qing exclaimed
      and charged the statue of deity.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, before he made a move, a dozen creatures suddenly appeared from
      behind the statue, each of them a mutant creature. There were huge snow
      wolf and bears, as well as dark bats and all sorts of birds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those mutant creatures completely blocked the path toward the statue.
      Also, they were led by the aristocrat spirit. Even Uncle Qing was shocked
      and stopped, finding it impossible to destroy the spirit stone directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Groups of creatures had flooded into the hall from outside. Although they
      were all primitive creatures, they were so huge in number that even if the
      group of people wanted to kill their way out, it would take them a long
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, they were in the spirit shelter and the gates had been
      closed. There was no way for them to go back even if they wanted to.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Human, you will regret that you stole my pet.&#8221; The cold face
      of the spirits was emotionless. She pointed at Han Sen with her ice spear.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that sentence, the ice-armored beasts flooded into the hall and
      threw themselves at the group of people with no fear for death.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the mutant creatures did not seem to be attacking. All they were
      doing was to protect the statue of deity. Clearly, they were trying to
      weaken the group using endless primitive creatures first.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit herself walked to Han Sen with her ice spear in hand, wanting
      to kill Han Sen with her own hands to get her revenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone else looked pale. They were trapped in this place. They could not
      run away or destroy the spirit stone. It seemed that they were in a dead
      end, and there was no hope of survival.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s rush out. Maybe there is still a chance,&#8221; Zhu
      Ting said loudly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You guard the door, and I will go for the spirit stone,&#8221; Han
      Sen said and walked to the spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone else lost their calm. With a dozen mutant creatures guarding the
      statue of deity, they could not approach it with all the people available,
      let alone Han Sen himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen had already gone toward the statue of deity. Other people
      had to block the door to the hall first, fighting the endless ice-armored
      beasts.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there were so many creatures out there that there was no way they
      could hold up for a long time. Even if the creatures were willing to be
      killed by them, their hands would still get tired.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not seem to be worried about the situation at all. He walked
      to the spirit and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re very smart, I could even call
      you sly. You have successfully lured us into the trap you have set
      up.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit curled her lips and looked content. She said coldly, &quot;The
      moment you decided to go against me, your death has been certain.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Unfortunately, there is one thing you did wrong,&#8221; Han Sen
      continued to say as he walked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is it?&#8221; Unexpectedly, the spirit asked with her brows
      knitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You should not let me come this far. Your favorite trap is your
      biggest mistake.&#8221; Han Sen quickly rushed to the huge statue of deity
      with the spirit stone like a tornado.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit sneered and swept her ice spear at Han Sen, trying to stop him.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen did not lower his speed at all. He used great strength
      with his legs yet put his upper body horizontal. Running forward but
      almost lying on the ground, Han Sen dodged the attack from the spirit in a
      weird pose and continued toward the statue at a high speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mutant creatures roared loud and threw themselves at Han Sen like
      demons from hell.
