“Is it a male or a female?” Han Sen looked at the Flower God in the video. It looked somewhat like a very gorgeous human, but a flower rose from its head. This flower was a violet.

“It is a male. In the Flower Gods, both the men and women look very beautiful. Don’t think that Violet is weak because of his beauty, however. He is actually very strong. He isn’t simple-minded or easily influenced. I have contacted him before, and he is a tricky guy to negotiate with,” Xie Qing King said.

“If he was easy to push around, I doubt the Flower Gods would let him deal with such important matters. After all, this decision will be a pivotal part of the Flower Gods becoming a higher race. If they fail, their entire race could be destroyed. They need to be careful with such matters.” Han Sen paused and then asked, “Which race do the Flower Gods wish to replace?”

“I don’t know yet. The Flower Gods are being very careful, and they don’t leak information easily. Judging from what others have guessed, they would likely seek to take out the Tree Men that are next to them. The Flower Gods and the Tree Men have been in conflict for a long time, so they are already enemies. Furthermore, the Tree Men have been doing poorly in recent times. It has been a few hundred years since they had a deified in their race. They aren’t exactly a powerful high race. They would be one of the easier races to knock down a peg. There are a few other targets, too…” Xie Qing King brought up all the information he had on the subject.

“Do these high races not have any allies?” Han Sen asked, tapping his lip in thought.

“Yes, but because they aren’t very strong, people don’t take them seriously. Plus, the Flower Gods have connections with the Ancient God. If they want to fight, it’s unlikely that others would interfere.” Xie Qing King pointed out more information about Violet. He then pointed at the man’s image and said, “Now, this guy is the key that we need. All we need to do is convince him, and then, we will be partnered with the Flower Gods and earn half of Space Garden.”

Xie Qing King smiled at Han Sen and said, “The crystallizers aren’t thought of as a strong race. I don’t think the Flower Gods will worry too much about you completely overpowering them. And then, all you need to do is use your power to impress Violet.”

“Why don’t you go there on your own?” Han Sen didn’t seem satisfied.

“I wanted to go, but I’m not deified yet,” Xie Qing King confessed hopelessly. He opened his palms.

“So, sometimes there are things you can’t do yourself?” Han Sen laughed.

Xie Qing King stared back at Han Sen and said, “It isn’t that I can’t. It’s that I can’t do it YET.”

Han Sen stayed on Xie Qing King’s planet for a few days. The environment wasn’t too shabby. It was almost like heaven. If it was a peaceful period, it wouldn’t be a bad choice to retire there for good.

Every day, Han Sen used the Four Sheep Cube to access God’s Farm. He was hoping to see Wan’er and God’s Knife again. But even though a lot of time had passed, Han Sen had yet to see them again.

It was strange. Han Sen was initially worried that if he used the Four Sheep Cube, he would be thrown back to the Very High. But now he noticed that no matter where he was, he would travel to God’s Farm and then return to where he last used the cube.

With things like that, it also meant he had no way of returning to the bottle world. If the Very High went to visit him, they would learn that he had escaped.

In fact, Han Sen’s escape had already been discovered. A Very High elder had planned to give Han Sen another full body checkup, but when he went into the bottle world, he was unable to find Han Sen.

This surprised the Very High a lot. Han Sen had escaped from their alpha hall without anyone noticing. As far as they were concerned, this was very bad.

But the Very High now believed someone must have helped Han Sen. Otherwise, how could he have escaped? Exquisite was initially their prime suspect, since she had done it once before. But after a thorough investigation, they realized that it couldn’t have been Exquisite.

After confirming that it wasn’t Exquisite, matters became more complicated. They believed there was a traitor in the Very High that their investigation had failed to uncover.

“He really escaped.” Exquisite was more shocked than any of the other Very High. She hadn’t believed Han Sen when he insisted that he would get out on his own. But a short time after she had last seen him, Han Sen had done as he promised. This was quite unbelievable.

Han Sen had been imprisoned by the Very High, the top race in the universe. Not even true god elites could escape from the alpha hall once they were trapped there. She couldn’t imagine how Han Sen had managed to do what he had done.

The Very High tried to predict where Han Sen might go, and they used some special geno arts of deduction, but they were unable to catch his trail. They hadn’t the faintest trace of a clue as to where he had fled. That made the Very High even more certain that there was a traitor in their midst. If there wasn’t a traitor, Han Sen would have been tracked down by now, they believed.

Han Sen, in the meantime, had just been introduced to Violet of the Flower Gods. The guy looked just as he had in the hologram. The man was so pretty that he could make a country fall.

But a pretty face like that didn’t influence Han Sen much. He felt like Violet was too soft, and it gave him the impression that the man was actually a toxic snake. Soft on the exterior, but filled to the brim with evil and poison.

“The prettier the snake is, the more toxic it is. I wonder how dangerous this Violet truly is?” Han Sen wondered to himself.

“You said Violet hosted a banquet and invited many deified elites from all sorts of races? What does that mean?” Han Sen lowered his voice to ask Xie Qing King next to him.

“I don’t know.” Xie Qing King fell silent, and then he said, “Maybe he wants to put the cooperation up as an auction, and have deified elites compete with each other. See who comes up with the highest price and what-not.”

“No way. That would be ridiculous. This decision will decide the fate of the whole race of the Flower Gods. They can’t host an auction for something this serious unless the people in charge of the Flower Gods are absolutely nuts.” Han Sen shook his head.

“In that case, I don’t know. Aside from that, I can’t really think of a reason that they would bring so many deified elites together. Contacting them via private means would be more beneficial.” Xie Qing King really didn’t understand much about politics.

Han Sen looked around. He saw a few people he already knew. There was Dragon One from the Dragons, and Dia Robber from the Destroyed. Bai Wanjie from the Extreme King. Even Lone Bamboo was there. And there were many other deified elites Han Sen did not know.

“It looks like the Space Garden is a juicy morsel for a lot of races.” There were so many competitors, Han Sen didn’t think he would be the one to be contracted.

“These big races are like hungry wolves circling prey. The Flower King might not want to cooperate with them. We still stand a chance.” Although Xie Qing King said that, seeing people like that all around, he knew how important the Space Garden was to everyone. It had exceeded his expectations, and he knew it wouldn’t be an easy prize to win.
