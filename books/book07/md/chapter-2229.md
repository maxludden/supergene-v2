“If you hadn’t talked, I would have thought that we might die, but now I am pretty sure I won’t die by walking along this Way of Life and Death,” Han Sen spoke with certainty.

“Young man, talk is cheap. If you are as certain as you say you are, then come and tread the path for yourself.” The old woman looked at him with disdain.

“Sure.” Han Sen, after saying it, immediately took his first steps along the Way of Life and Death.

Han Sen was not there to prove the old woman wrong, and neither was he there to provide comfort and aid to Bai Wei. All he wanted to do was feel the powers that permeated the Way of Life and Death. A power like that was rare to witness, even for those that were deified. So, there would not be many opportunities for him to experience the feelings of such a power. Han Sen wanted to feel what it was like to feel that which plagued the Way of Life and Death.

If the spell that had been put upon the Way of Life and Death was genuine, then it would not be something so simple as manipulated time. If it was just the power of time, then the speed would be one-way and fixed. Every creature had a different lifespan, so there was no way each step added a certain amount of time that would only bring them to their death upon reaching the end. Only the cause of life and death could have that effect. Going forward took you to your demise, whereas going backwards assured life. If Han Sen could have the taste of that power, it would be a remarkable thing for him to have.

“Brother, this is way too risky.” Han Yan tugged at Han Sen’s arm and made her concern known. Although Han Yan knew Han Sen’s judgment was likely correct, this was a matter that concerned her family. It was only natural for her to be as afraid as she was.

“It’s okay. I’m only going to take a look.” Han Sen touched Han Yan on her head, blinked, and then he approached the staircase.

Bao’er wished to follow Han Sen, but he passed her to Han Yan. He proceeded alone.

When he committed to his first step on the stone staircase, he ran Dongxuan Aura and used his Purple-Eye Butterfly. With them, he watched his body change.

“I was correct; it is similar to Falsified-Sky Sutra, but somehow it’s different. There is another cause of power.” While Han Sen kept his Dongxuan Aura and his Purple-Eye Butterfly running, Han Sen was able to see many almost transparent substances get chained within him.

Every step Han Sen took saw more and more of those substance chains chain him up. Han Sen knew that the path he walked along was not just a simple illusion. It was a scary power that had been left behind by a wondrous deified being.

Han Sen kept walking up, and as he went, his body kept changing. From his young self, he became middle-aged. And from his middle-aged self, he soon became old. The scariest thing was how he felt his own lifespan and time remaining decrease.

The creatures outside the sanctuaries could not see what remained of their lifespan, but those that lived in the sanctuaries could always see it.

Han Sen had a lifespan of a thousand years, and according to the rate of aging right now, the last step would bring him down to the figure of zero years remaining. Han Sen retreated just a little, and when he did that, he felt his lifespan increase again. It really was a path that was true to its name of the Way of Life and Death. Han Sen really admired Undying Bird now. A strong power like this was something that deserved admiration.

Han Sen used all the Purple-Eye Butterfly’s power to try and get a read, but try as he might, everything was still a mystery. He could not analyze the enigmatic cause power. He was disappointed, but he still continued to ascend.

The more he walked, the stronger the cause power felt. Han Sen saw it clearer and clearer. Han Sen did not stop, and he thought to himself. He eventually reached Bai Wei’s position. He was very old right now, just like Bai Wei. The mere act of talking was enough to make him gasp.

“This is none of your business. Why have you walked up here?” Bai Wei looked at Han Sen with a complicated expression. She did not know if he was trying to be a hero or not.

“I just wanted to prove a little theory I have. It has nothing to do with you, either.” Han Sen said that, and then he continued walking up the stairs.

Han Sen felt as if he were tremendously old right now. He felt as if he were losing his power, too. Every single step he now took was incredibly tiring.

Bai Wei looked at Han Sen’s back as he went, and her feelings were wrought with complication.

Han Sen walked another step. There were only two more remaining. Han Sen did not hesitate, though. He took a deep breath and walked one more step. Then he stopped.

He looked at his lifespan, which had ticked down to only one remaining. Normally, a person would die after taking the last step.

“Undying Bird has a very strong cause power,” Han Sen said coldly. He really did admire Undying Bird right now.

The old woman squinted her eyes. “I did not expect you would have knowledge regarding this to know that this is cause power and not a simple time power.”

“It is a shame I was not able to see Undying Bird while she was alive… I really wish I had been able to… cough cough…” Han Sen was serious about what he said. An elite like that was not someone who would be easy to meet.

If he was able to see the Undying Bird use that mysterious cause power, perhaps he would be able to learn something from it, so Han Sen thought it was a grand shame that he couldn’t see Undying Bird use it. The substance chains he saw now were too blurry, and he couldn’t learn anything from them.

“If you know how strong it is, does that mean you are going to walk the final step?” the old woman smiled at Han Sen. It was difficult to imagine what she might be thinking.

“Of course I want to come,” Han Sen surely said, but due to the fact that he was so old, he did not sound very confident. If anything, he sounded like he was going to die.

“Oh, you are saying Undying Bird’s power cannot kill you?” The old woman looked at Han Sen with a complete lack of emotion.

“She can kill me, but not through these stairs,” Han Sen said.

“If that is what you think, then take the last step.” The old woman smiled at Han Sen.

Han Yan and the others looked at Han Sen nervously. If he walked the next step and it worked like all the rest did, then Han Sen was going to die.

Han Sen said so himself, too, that the steps were not displaying an illusion. This was a real cause power he was contending with. Han Yan knew cause powers were scary, too. Cause powers could kill, and they did not have to make people bleed to kill them.

Bai Wei looked at Han Sen’s back and displayed a very complicated emotion. Bai Wei knew Han Sen knew who she was. She thought Han Sen was doing this to get her attention or at least make a good impression of himself. She had seen many people do this on her behalf before, but Han Sen had gone all the way to the final step, and he was ready to make the next move. She had greatly misjudged Han Sen’s character.

In a moment that separates life and death, who can remain fearless? To even know that completing this path might not lead to death, who would be so willing to risk their life?

Not even Bai Wei herself made the dare. She looked at Han Sen with a complicated expression and thought, “Is he going to take the final step? Is he confident? Or is this all a guess?”

As everyone watched, Han Sen raised his legs and readied himself to bring them down on the final step.

The old woman looked strange, and Han Yan forgot to breathe.

Huangfu Jing looked calm, but she frowned. She thought to herself, “What makes him so certain that he won’t die by ascending the stairs?”

She knew Han Sen was not the sort of person who was willing to risk his life on a whim. If he dared to go all the way up, then he must have somehow known he wouldn’t die.

As everyone watched, one of Han Sen’s legs took the final step. He used the last ounce of his power to bring the second leg up to meet the first. He stood up there right next to the dead animal from before.

Boom!

The whole stair lit up. A transparent fire blazed across the step. It was like a very large bonfire.
