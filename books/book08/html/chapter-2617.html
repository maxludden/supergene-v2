<p>Sky Palace Leader nodded to the Tenth Elder. “If I’m correct,
then it is what you’re thinking. I cannot believe it was in Sky
Palace all along. It was right under my nose.”</p>
<p>“This… is it possible?” Yun Changkong’s voice trembled. He
stared at Han Yan’s jade box.</p>
<p>The jade box gleamed in the light. There weren’t many adornments
or engravings on it; it was a simple box, with no markings or
patterns to identify it. Many Sky Palace elites wouldn’t have been
able to tell what it was.</p>
<p>“Old Yun, you should explain what is inside that jade box,” the
Sixth Elder couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong looked at Sky Palace Leader, who nodded. Yun
Changkong’s expression was difficult to read as he said, “You guys
know about the Eleventh Leader, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Eleventh Leader was a Sky Palace genius. Everyone
knows about him. He was the strongest elite in Sky Palace that
entered the geno hall.” Sixth Elder rolled his eyes, but then his
eyes widened and his face lost its color. “Is this jade box related
to the Eleventh Leader?”</p>
<p>Yun Changkong nodded and said, “You guys should remember the
records that were created before the Eleventh Leader went into the
geno hall. He left behind words.”</p>
<p>“The sword that will go to the luckiest person!” many elders
shouted at the same moment. Everyone’s eyes opened wide. They
stared at the jade box Han Yan was holding.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong nodded solemnly. “The Eleventh Leader’s sword
skills were so fierce. He was like a god. He was a swordmaster from
a family of swordsmen, and his talents brought him great strength.
The Eleventh Leader’s sword skills were remarkable, even from a
young age. He practiced with swords at the age of three years old.
His swordmind reached the level of deified before he was twenty
years old. He became the leader of Sky Palace before he was
deified. When our race was in crisis, he destroyed traitors and
battled enemies. Back then, even all the deified elders listened to
him so they could make Sky Palace the best it could be. We have
been stable for a billion years because of him. Referring to his
lifetime as the Sky’s ‘Golden Age’ isn’t even enough to describe
him. He was the one who left the inscription near Sky Pond that
reads ‘Outer Sky.””</p>
<p>“Special people do special things. The Eleventh Leader’s sword
skills weren’t passed on to anyone else in Sky Palace. He didn’t
educate a single student. Before he went to the geno hall, he said,
‘Fate will search the universe, and the sword will be given to the
luckiest person.’ But no one has ever figured out who that luckiest
person might be. Until now, no one has found any sign of the
Eleventh Leader’s sword skills. But people always knew he left his
sword around somewhere. Many people have searched for that treasure
across the universe, but they always came up empty-handed,” Yun
Changkong said. He stared at Han Yan’s jade box.</p>
<p>“How do you know the jade box contains the Eleventh Leader’s
sword skills?” the Sixth Elder asked with confusion.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong had a wry smile as he answered, “This jade box is
made from Outer World Jade. It only exists in Sky Palace. It is so
rare that no one else could have this much of it. Even if someone
had some, they wouldn’t come here and drop their Outer World Jade
in the Sky Pond. Aside from our leaders, who else could do
this?”</p>
<p>“There have been many leaders here over the years. How do you
know this belongs to the Eleventh Leader?” the Sixth Elder asked.
He was still confused.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong pointed at the white elephant who was fast asleep
near the Sky Pond. “Don’t you remember what the Eleventh Leader’s
mount was?”</p>
<p>“I have heard it was a Hitting Sky Elephant… but I thought the
Hitting Sky Elephant disappeared when the Eleventh Leader went to
the geno hall.” When he realized what he was saying, the Sixth
Elder trailed off in astonishment. His eyes opened wide as he
looked at Han Yan’s jade box. He screamed, “Is that really the
Eleventh Leader’s sword skill?”</p>
<p>“We should open it and find out,” Sky Palace Leader said.</p>
<p>“Let me open it,” the Sixth Elder said merrily. He walked close
to Han Yan and tried to grab the box.</p>
<p>Before his hands could even touch the jade box, he felt a strong
power come from behind. It sucked him backward.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Sixth Elder flew back through the air and slammed into the
stone inscribed with the words Outer Sky. His face was almost
crushed against the hard surface.</p>
<p>The white elephant near the pond had only moved his nose an
inch. He didn’t open his eyes. He was still sleeping.</p>
<p>When Yun Changkong saw the other elder’s shaken expression, he
chuckled and said, “Brother Six, you are in too much of a rush.
Think about the Eleventh Leader’s personality. He wouldn’t allow
just anyone to open his box.”</p>
<p>The Sixth Elder stood up slowly, wincing in pain as he moved. He
stared at the white elephant, but he didn’t make any aggressive
moves.</p>
<p>If the white elephant was the Eleventh Leader’s mount, it would
be stronger than a normal deified creature.</p>
<p>“Han Yan, open the box,” Sky Palace Leader told Han Yan.</p>
<p>Han Yan looked at Han Sen, and Han Sen nodded for her to do as
she was told. Han Yan felt as if she had gotten quite lucky. This
seemed to be a very rare opportunity that she had received, and
maybe the Eleventh Leader had left behind great resources. If that
was true, perhaps she wouldn’t have to struggle so much to level
up.Han Yan held the jade box. It wasn’t locked, so she lifted the
lid and opened the jade box. A shadow flew out. It was in the shape
of a gentleman.</p>
<p>His age would be difficult to guess, but he appeared to be
rather young. He gave off an aura of someone who carried a great
burden, however.</p>
<p>“It looks like you guys never thought I’d leave this behind at
the bottom of Sky Pond. But don’t worry. After all, you guys are my
descendants. I wouldn’t expect you to guess how my mind worked.
Right now, whoever is in charge of Sky Palace needs to listen to
me. The luckiest person, the person the white elephant selected, is
the one who will receive my sword skills. Only that person can get
what is inside this box. If anyone goes against this will of mine,
bad luck will fall upon them. It is quite funny… I bet many
creatures are looking all over the universe for this. I wonder
which of the Sky was this lucky…” After saying that, the shadow
disappeared. No one knew where it went.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader and the others looked strange. The legends
said that the Eleventh Leader was a very heroic and smart man. They
did not expect him to be such a… well, such a kid. It looked like
he was quite the prankster.</p>
<p>“Old Elder, you are so unreliable. The white elephant chose a
person who wasn’t even one of the Sky. She is just a foreign
student.” Sky Palace Leader felt so depressed that he didn’t know
what to say.</p>
<p>According to the Eleventh Leader’s words, the sword skills had
to be given to Han Yan. The most secret skills of Sky Palace were
about to be hers. If they didn’t give the skills to her, that would
mean they were betraying the will and direction of the Eleventh
Leader. That decision would reflect poorly upon them.</p>
<p>The most important thing, however, was the fact that the
Eleventh Leader’s mount was still there. The white elephant was
bound to intervene if they tried to take the knowledge away from
Han Yan.</p>
<p>All the elders of Sky Palace looked confused. None of them said
a word.</p>
