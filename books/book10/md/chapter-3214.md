  In the darkness, a gold shadow was quaking. It was becoming brighter too. Within a few seconds, Wan’er was able to walk right out of that dark. She effortlessly strolled out of the painting

“No… Impossible…” The painting’s god face changed. His face was full of shock. Before the universe rebooted, he had been the strongest elite. Even members of the God Chaos Party were afraid of him.

Although he did not reach the last step and become a Reboot class, he was not like an ordinary Annihilation God Spirit either.

After the universe rebooted, Annihilation God Spirits were weakened. Nothing had been able to compete with him. The painting god was still able to fight an Annihilation God Spirit, he wasn’t certain whether he would win or lose.

Facing a human, his power was not working. That was incomprehensible. He was different from ordinary God Spirits. He did just have god power. After he had fallen, he combined with the God Chaos Party’s secret skills and used a god power to break worlds. Thus, he had strong and scary powers.

If things were not like that, he would not have dared to say he could fight Annihilation God Spirits.

Yet, power like that could not hurt a human woman. How would one tell a man like that to stay calm and not be surprised?

Wan’er emerged from the darkness. She looked at the painting god. Her expression was cold. It was like she had no focus.

She raised her hand and waved at the painting god. It was like she was slashing around a knife.

The painting god’s expression changed. He clutched his wooden cane and used ink to block. It was like he was blocking an invisible knife.

Katcha!

The gold light flashed in space. The painting god and his cane were slashed in half. The painting on the wall was cut in half too.

Qin Jing Zhen and the others watched the painting god get killed with ease. His body dissolved in a golden light. They were all too shocked to say a single word.

He was very scary and had protected many things for the Qin Kingdom. Now, he had been killed with one hit from a woman. It was so shocking that it could not be described.

That was especially true about people like Qin Jing Zhen, who knew about the painting god. He was even more shocked than the others. The history of the Qin family had many records about the painting god.

Back in the day, the Zhao, Wei, and Han kingdoms had reunited to try and siege Jade Wall City. The place was going to fall. The scary old man in the painting had waved his finger, immediately eliminating the generals of the three kingdoms. They simply died out in space. He had saved the Qin Kingdom from falling

There was another time when many officers of the Qin Kingdom had revolted. They almost managed to kill a very young Qin Kingdom king. The queen visited the temple with the young boy and prayed for the alpha’s assistance.

The traitors surrounded the alpha temple. Many of them were elites who could shock the sky. The Qin Kingdom was going to change its name.

The old man from the painting revealed himself. He waved his cane in the drawing and had a few dozen elites immediately destroyed. It saved the Qin family’s bloodline.

A god like that was murdered by a woman. How could Qin Jing Zhen not be afraid?

“Leave! Leave the alpha temple!” Qin Jing Zhen could not care for much now. He commanded everyone to abandon the temple. It was no longer about whether or not the Qin Kingdom would suffer many big losses. It was all about ensuring their survival.

Han Sen was running too. The power Wan’er used to kill the painting god was not something he could repel. He asked himself to confirm it, and he told himself he couldn’t. The Wan’ers from two universes had combined. The power was so strong that one could not imagine what it was like. Han Sen thought that even if God Hall Leader fought her, he would not be able to win.

The officers and royals outside were unaware of what was happening inside. They saw the priests and servants emerge while protecting a terrible-looking Qin Jing Zhen.

“Open the temple’s bai sema!” Qin Jing Zhen was in the middle of a crisis, but he was not in a panic. He gave the order without issue.

The area around the alpha temple flickered. Many strange beasts revealed themselves. The shadows of those beasts were like dragons, but they weren’t dragons. There were nine of them. The heads and tails of nine weird beasts connected to create a giant orb of light that bubbled around the alpha temple.

Katcha!

A gold light flashed. It was like a knife used to punish the gods. The shadows of the nine weird beasts that had composed the shield were gone. The gold light was not stopping there. It continued to attack. Wan’er made a big crack in the man-made planet. She went into space and slashed down on Jade Wall City’s castle to create a big hole in it.

The whole of Jade Wall City shook after the strike. Fortunately, the man-made planet only had officers on it. Ordinary people weren’t there. Otherwise, that attack would have killed many people.

The scary elites from the palace protected Qin Jing Zhen as they escaped the alpha temple. Han Sen took Bao’er with them as they left. He was fairly certain that Wan’er did not remember anything. She had become the emotionless blonde lady who was not restricted by anything.

Even the Super God Spirit mode was not restrained. Han Sen could not find a way to restrict the blonde Wan’er.

He flew away, but he did not get far. Han Sen looked terrible. Wan’er did not go after Qin Jing Zhen. He did not know when, but she suddenly appeared behind him. “Holy crap! What is this?” Han Sen was shocked. He could not pretend anymore. No one noticed him do it, but he summoned the Sky God Crown. He used the Sky God Crown to pull Bao’er into the God of Wealth Temple with him.

The God of Wealth Temple was in the Gold Crystal System. It was many systems away from Jade Wall City. Wan’er should not have been able to follow.

Han Sen had only just entered the God of Wealth Temple when Wan’er’s body appeared before the God of Wealth Temple.

“I cannot be that unlucky!” Han Sen’s face turned ashen.

Decapitation Queen appeared inside God of Wealth Temple. Clutching her guillotine, she shouted at Wan’er, “How ignorant! How dare you come to the God of Wealth Temple!” “Decapitation Queen, stand down!” Han Sen had a cold sweat. Decapitation Queen was strong, but before Wan’er, her power was nothing Han Sen was afraid Wan’er would kill her with one hit. Perhaps she would have been struck down so hard that her god base would not recover. It was too late for Han Sen to say anything. Wan’er moved her hand. It was a simple strike.

Seeing the gold fire come before Decapitation Queen, Han Sen was too late to save her.

Bzzt!

Time seemed to have stopped. Even the gold flame on Wan’er stopped. At that moment, a body went up and pulled Decapitation Queen back.

The gold flame burst into the sky and was extinguished in space. It had enough force to destroy many of the planets around there. Space was suddenly filled with countless lights.

Han Sen thought it was too close, but Moment God helped. If she hadn’t, Decapitation Queen would have been killed.

His Super God Spirit mode had a killing God Spirit power. Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit mode might have had a similar thing, so he did not want to risk it.

Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He took Bao’er, who looked like herself again, to teleport away from God of Wealth Temple.

Moment God’s time power did not affect Wan’er much. Although they had been helped, Han Sen did not want to fight Wan’er. He had to lead her away to avoid her destroying the god temple.
