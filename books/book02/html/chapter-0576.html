    <p>
      As more and more time elapsed, the chilled air within Han Sen was becoming
      stronger and stronger. His cells were moving, but it felt as if they were
      turning into crystals.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, the Dongxue Sutra started running, and a strange feeling
      compelled Han Sen to stop his practice ofJadeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face looked ghastly. He was excited to try to combine the
      frost air with his own cells and unlock his first gene lock. But not after
      he started the Dongxue Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Could it be that these two skills contradict each other?&#8221; Han
      Sen was a little annoyed. If these two skills could not co-exist together,
      it ran the possibility of them frying his mind and turning him crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox watched Han Sen wake up, and when he did, it ran towards
      his legs to rub against them. His foul mood made him push the silver fox
      away in irritation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the silver fox&#8217;s pitiable face, Han Sen&#8217;s heart was
      given a shock. He pulled out a small mirror that had been prepared for
      beetle night. Looking at himself in the reflection, he did not notice
      anything strange.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen castJadeskin, he felt the chill rise. Although it
      wasn&#8217;t as scary as Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s, it still made some water
      turn into ice. If this was normal, Han Sen would be glad, but when he
      looked at himself in the mirror again, he saw cold sweat dotting his
      forehead. He could clearly see in the mirror how his eyes were starting to
      turn a faint shade of red. While it wasn&#8217;t stark and obvious to see,
      a good look would reveal the encroaching color.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought that his eyes were starting to look like those of the Xue
      family; cold, callous, and cruel.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh my days! What the hell is this skill? This is not right.
      Normally, I would never kick silver fox away, and I wouldn&#8217;t be so
      moody. Can that crappyJadeskin really change someone&#8217;s
      personality?&#8221; The more Han Sen thought about it, the more annoyed he
      got. He thought about breaking the mirror, and he started to fear
      something had truly gone wrong with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      He immediately cancelled his training ofJadeskin and cast the Dongxue
      Sutra. He retreated into a state of meditation, which woke up his cells
      and generated a sweet, pleasing fragrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The frosty air was chased out by the pleasant smell, out and away from his
      cells. This generated a white fog around Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was a beginner of the Dongxue Sutra and he had yet to complete the
      first tier. It could not rivalJadeskin, and that was proven with the
      entire hour it took to expunge the frosty power that had gathered inside
      his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued to sit on the snow, and he repeatedly cast Dongxue
      Sutra. The silver fox was sitting down near Han Sen as well, surveying the
      area with serious vigilance. He didn&#8217;t move an inch.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sky became clogged with dreary clouds, and a blizzard began to form
      all around. Han Sen was soon buried in the snow, and it wasn&#8217;t long
      until he represented the image of a snowman.
    </p>

    <p>
      The body of the silver fox supported no snow, however. It just maintained
      its position, awaiting its master&#8217;s next move.
    </p>

    <p>
      It snowed all day and all night and still, neither Han Sen nor the silver
      fox moved. The snow on Han Sen turned to ice, releasing frosted air
      beneath the sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whoa! That is a beautiful little fox.&#8221; Not too far from them,
      the voice of a woman sounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Liu Qing, don&#8217;t be fooled by its appearance! No matter how
      cute a creature may look, it is most likely a cruel and despicable monster
      on the inside. I have never seen a creature such as this before and
      therefore, more than ever, we should be careful!&#8221; A man&#8217;s
      voice followed.
    </p>

    <p>
      A man and woman trudged through the field of snow, inching closer and
      closer in the direction of the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman noticed the silver fox didn&#8217;t move a single inch, and it
      continued to just sit there. Next to it was a snowman. With unexpected
      surprise, she said, &#8220;Oh, and there is a snowman! The little fox
      keeps looking at it. Do you think maybe that it built the snowman?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Your imagination knows no bounds. Tell me, how might a fox build a
      snowman? Obviously, that has to be the creation of someone else here. But
      I will admit that it is a bit strange. Why would the fox just sit there
      and not move?&#8221; The man was becoming more curious, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let me go check it out. Perhaps it is frozen.&#8221; The woman
      secretly wanted to touch the fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man quickly pulled her back, saying, &#8220;Careful! That thing could
      be luring us closer, for all we know! It could be a trap. We should just
      run up there and smack it with our swords; problem solved, danger
      averted.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After this, he summoned a beast soul sword and started running towards the
      silver fox, waving the sword as he went. When the man brought his sword
      down to strike his target, he hit nothing. The snowman next to the silver
      fox moved.
    </p>

    <p>
      An icy hand reached out, using its middle finger and index finger to stop
      the fall of the blade.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only noise that sounded was a quick katcha, and the blade of the beast
      soul sword was cleanly cut in two by those two fingers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man and woman were shocked, and so they quickly retreated. Then, they
      saw the snowman begin to crumble. A human shadow emerged, grabbed the fox,
      and ran off. Within two seconds, they had completely disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fox fairy!&#8221; the woman screamed.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What fox fairy? That was just a humanoid creature,&#8221; the man
      said, with his face depleted of color.
    </p>

    <p>
      They hadn&#8217;t seen Han Sen&#8217;s face clearly, only the shape and
      shadow of a man grabbing the fox and running off.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah, a fox fairy that shapeshifted into a human.&#8221; The woman
      could not escape her belief of it being a fox fairy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless, the man and woman did not believe what they had seen was a
      human. But who could blame them? Why would any man be buried under
      snowfall and remain like a snowman, only to emerge, grab a fox, and
      quickly sprint away without leaving a single footprint? Ordinary humans
      wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing!
    </p>

    <p>
      Quickly, a rumor spread that a humanoid fox fairy creature lived out on
      the ice fields. A lot of strong people began looking for it, but to no
      avail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, meanwhile, had returned to the Crystal Palace with the silver
      fox. He tried runningJadeskin again, ue to having now removed the frosty
      power he had absorbed from Xue Yi Kuang. Using it now, his body no longer
      felt chilled, and he instead became nice and cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he was running the skill, he looked into his mirror carefully. Seeing
      nothing out of the ordinary, his tension finally eased.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now, despite the lack of frosty air, theJadeskin still felt different
      than it did before. While it was running, his brain felt chilled. His mind
      and perception, however, became sharper.
    </p>

    <p>
      The longer he ran theJadeskin, the more calm he felt. It seemed as if
      nothing could affect his emotions right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is strange. There must be something wrong. The Xue
      family&#8217;sJadeskin must have some sort of problem.&#8221; This made
      Han Sen remember the speech Xue Yi Yang gave at the exchange event, which
      pertained to another skill called Ice Heart. It was a Qi Gong that was
      supposed to calm your emotions and put them to rest. People said that
      everyone in the Xue family had learnt Ice Heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      But every Xue family member Han Sen had met possessed an angry
      personality, and this made him think that this Ice Heart had a problem.
