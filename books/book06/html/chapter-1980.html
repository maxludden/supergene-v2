	<p>There was no need for Han Sen to fight anymore. The purple smoke was spreading quickly across the ant queen,
		ripping its wounds apart and sending blood spewing out of it like a burst dam.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was too lazy to wait, though. He slashed again and cut the heavily-injured ant queen’s head clean off.
	</p>

	<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Jade Ant Queen: xenogeneic gene found.”</p>

	<p>There was an announcement, and it made Han Sen very happy. “It really is a mutant xenogeneic!”</p>

	<p>The Jade Ants did not back off just because the ant queen was killed. They all came rushing at Han Sen like
		kamikazes.</p>

	<p>Han Sen gave Spell back her body, and she quickly got to firing rockets at the droves. Meanwhile, Han Sen went on
		to finish off the rest of the Earls himself.</p>

	<p>After many more ants were killed, the rest decided to return to their abode below the stone.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not seek to pursue the fight. He harvested the bodies of the ant queen and the eight Earls. He also
		collected many Viscount xenogeneic genes.</p>

	<p>Yu Jing saw Han Sen picking up all those xenogeneic genes and felt depressed. He had to comfort himself by
		saying, “It is lucky I can at least get half of those jade fruits. This guy is scary, and he is nothing like the
		stories people tell about him. He doesn’t seem like the sort of fellow who would need to be carried into Sky
		Palace. I should have totally fought for a greater share of this haul.”</p>

	<p>There were fourteen jade fruits on the tree. Han Sen and Yu Jing each took half. Han Sen received seven, and then
		he asked Yu Jing what benefit they could provide.</p>

	<p>“Brother Han, how about we co-operate in Xuanyuan Cave and kill more xenogeneics together. We can split the
		gatherings in your favor, sixty-forty. I guess I could settle for seventy-thirty. Eighty-twenty is a
		possibility, too. You should think about it!”</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not continue his hunt in Xuanyuan Cave. He took his spoils and left. He flew the legless crane back
		to his island.</p>

	<p>Right then, he wanted to find out the purpose of mutant xenogeneic genes. He did not need to do any more hunting
		at this point.</p>

	<p>He gave a few Viscount Jade Ant bodies to the legless crane. He didn’t collect the xenogeneic genes inside the
		bodies, either. The crane was able to gobble them all up.</p>

	<p>The legless crane happily swallowed the first, and it made a grateful noise to Han Sen as it ate.</p>

	<p>Han Sen went to the stone house and pulled the bodies out. He cut open the ant queen’s body and picked up a piece
		of flesh that looked like jade.</p>

	<p>That meat was transparent, and not unlike shrimp. Something gold shone from it, and looking into the gold light,
		you could see it was the face of the ant queen.</p>

	<p>“Earl Genes insufficient. Cannot refine mutant xenogeneic genes.”</p>

	<p>As Han Sen held the ant queen’s xenogeneic gene, he received the same announcement.</p>

	<p>“I have nine Earl genes. And here there are eight Earl class Jade Ants. I don’t know if that’ll be enough.” Han
		Sen cut open the eight Earl ants and picked up the xenogeneic genes within.</p>

	<p>Han Sen gave the ant queen’s body, and the bodies of the others, to the legless crane for food. Bubble was Han
		Sen’s only other companion right now, so there was nothing else he could feed.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had an Earl pet beast soul and seven Viscount beast souls, but he did not fancy feeding them at all.
		Having a pet in Sky Palace would not be something you could easily hide. If others discovered that he possessed
		one, explaining that might be difficult.</p>

	<p>Jade Ant xenogeneic genes were like a fist-sized cut of meat. After Han Sen melted them down, it was like a
		barbecue. The oil sizzled, and he sprinkled it with salt and pepper. It tasted better than barbecued lamb.</p>

	<p>“Earl Genes +1”</p>

	<p>After eating a piece of the ant meat, Han Sen felt very alive. He was energized, and he felt as if he could have
		sex ten times in one night.</p>

	<p>After eating four pieces of that meat, his belly was bloated. The meal was very filling.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not want to wait before eating the rest, though, so he switched on Consume and quickly digested the
		ants that were in his stomach. By the time he was done, he had finished all eight slabs of ant meat.</p>

	<p>In total, Han Sen now had seventeen Earl genes. But when he picked up the ant queen’s mutant genes, it still said
		he did not have enough Earl genes.</p>

	<p>“How many Earl genes do I need? I can’t figure out the number.” Han Sen felt depressed, but it was almost time
		for White Jade Jing to open again. He did not have time to venture into the cave just yet, so he’d think about
		what to do once he returned from White Jade Jing.</p>

	<p>Practicing in White Jade Jing was the most important thing he could do right now. He had three geno arts that
		needed to play catch-up and reach Earl status, so White Jade Jing was very important. It was why Yisha had sent
		him here, after all.</p>

	<p>Of course, Yisha had sent him there only intending for him to level up The Story of Genes to Earl status. And
		that was something he had already accomplished.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, are you here?” The day White Jade Jing opened, someone was calling for Han Sen before he had woken up.
	</p>

	<p>The voice was Yun Suyi’s. Han Sen went to brush his teeth, then opened the door. Yun Suyi was wearing a white
		dress, and she was standing just outside the door. The cut of the dress showed off her attractive legs.</p>

	<p>“White Jade Jing is opening today. Let’s go.” Yun Suyi blinked at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Yeah,” Han Sen answered. He turned to wake up the legless crane that was snoozing beneath the tree.</p>

	<p>“Let’s take my Jade Wing Tiger. It is faster,” Yun Suyi said.</p>

	<p>“Sure.” Han Sen nodded, letting the legless crane continue to sleep.</p>

	<p>Han Sen sat behind her, and the Jade Wing Tiger flew towards White Jade Jing.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, you are a student of Knife Queen. You must surely know many knife skills. I’ve learned a few, but I
		fear there is something amiss. If you ever have the time, could you teach me a thing or two?” Yun Suyi turned
		around and smiled at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>“I can’t teach you, but we can practice together,” Han Sen said.</p>

	<p>“Okay, then. After White Jade Jing closes, I will take you over to my place.” Yun Suyi smiled in a flirty way.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen and Yun Suyi went to the White Jade Building, and they split up when they reached the fourth floor. Yun
		Suyi said she’d wait for Han Sen.</p>

	<p>This time, Han Sen stopped on the sixth floor. He had decided to practice there this time. He had to practice his
		other geno arts, and he did not know if his body could withstand the Jade Air of the seventh floor without using
		Petrify.</p>

	<p>But the sixth floor was full of students. It filled up soon after, and people were everywhere.</p>

	<p>“Brother Han, you are here!” Yu Jing walked in and saw Han Sen, then went over to sit down beside him.</p>
