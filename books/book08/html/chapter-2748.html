<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Han Sen raised the Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze right in front of himself. It deflected the lightning that was
about to touch down on him.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had underestimated how scary that lightning truly
was. The lightning couldn’t harm the shield, but when the lightning
exploded, it cast a net of electricity that reached behind and
ensnared Han Sen, who was hiding behind the shield.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was able to activate the power within the shield, he
could enable its true protection, which would provide 360 degrees
of cover. But right now, Han Sen could only use the shield like an
ordinary piece of metal. He couldn’t activate its power. He could
only shield himself from the power that was coming for him from the
front.</p>
<p>The lightning again wracked Han Sen’s body. He shook more
violently than a lady twerking as hard as she could.</p>
<p>“This is eight lifetimes of bad luck.” Han Sen moaned a lot as
he continued to spasm. The electric eel was a powerful foe, there
was no doubt about that. And Han Sen could barely scratch the
creature, despite using everything he could against it. The numbing
power of that lightning simply ignored his attacks and defense.
While it didn’t seem capable of killing him, it hurt like hell. It
also severely decreased his performance in battle.</p>
<p>The electric eel seemed to know that its lightning attacks were
working against Han Sen. It wasn’t stingy with its attacks, as it
kept launching salvos of electric bolts. Han Sen couldn’t block the
lightning, and he couldn’t dodge it either. He simply didn’t have
the time to teleport away, and so he couldn’t dodge a single
lightning bolt. He could only use the shield to block the lightning
now and again. Every time he got electrified, he would twitch and
convulse violently. It was like his body had installed an electric
motor that made him shake super-fast.</p>
<p>“Just because I’ve been keeping my temper in check, you think
you can treat me like a Hello Kitty when I’m actually a tiger?” Han
Sen thought in rage. His jaw tightened, and The Story of Genes
armor appeared around him. It activated a solidifying power that
let Han Sen run crazily fast.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Another bolt of lightning struck the Medusa’s shield. The bolt
exploded with a crackle of electricity, but Han Sen’s body was
shielded.</p>
<p>This time, the lightning was unable to reach Han Sen’s
vulnerable flesh. Han Sen’s Forever Solid power made the Spell
armor and his body invulnerable to change. Electricity couldn’t
spread through his armor and flesh, so no paralytic effect would
linger on him.</p>
<p>“Now it’s my turn to show off.” Han Sen lifted his shield and
Ghost Teeth Knife. He pushed back the electric eel’s lightning and
moved forward, looking for a chance to slash the electric eel.</p>
<p>The electric eel’s power was stronger than Han Sen’s demonic
strength. But luckily, Han Sen’s shield took most of the attack.
The lightning that exploded couldn’t harm Han Sen, who was still
under the influence of Forever Solid.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knife airs couldn’t do anything to the electric eel.
The electric eel broke each one of his strikes with ease. The man
and the eel seemed to have reached a stalemate. One of them was
looking for a chance to use his knife light, while another spewed
countless bolts of lightning. They made the sea around them churn
and slosh, the water forming whirlpools and powerful eddies as they
fought. Much of the water was vaporized, even.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen caught yet another barrage of lightning on his shield,
and the impact pushed his body back ten meters. This was the
hundredth time Han Sen had been pushed back thus far.</p>
<p>“It looks like I have to get a deified knife. Ghost Teeth Knife
is just King class. Using it to fight a deified is demonstrating
that it clearly no longer has the strength to compete at my level,”
Han Sen thought sadly when he saw the cracks that were slowly
spreading along Ghost Teeth Knife’s blade.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been using that knife for a long time, so it was sad
to see it get broken like this.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Han Sen shouted. He thrust forward with Ghost Teeth
Knife, unleashing a knife light that seemed to encompass all of
space. The raging knife lights converged into a scary knife stream
that was headed for the electric eel.</p>
<p>The electric eel’s electric substance chains exploded out from
its body in a writhing cloud. The endless stream of knife lights
was like a flood. After fighting for a while, the knife lights
finally broke through the electric net. Han Sen’s attack went
forward to strike the scales of the villain.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s hailstorm of attacks slammed into the eel, each impact
giving off a metallic shriek. A few thousand knife lights tested
their might against the hard scales of the electric eel. They
finally drew blood, which seeped out from the wound in a steady
stream.</p>
<p>The electric eel squealed in pain, and it swung its tail. It
became a flash of lightning as it escaped. Han Sen didn’t even move
for a split second; he was too stunned by the creature’s speed. Not
even his Apollo wings would be enough to catch up with the eel.</p>
<p>“You want to run? Escaping me won’t be so easy. You ate my prey,
and you’re going to have to cough up a lot of interest when you pay
that debt.” Han Sen cast teleport and quickly followed it.</p>
<p>The electric eel’s lightning was so powerful that Han Sen’s
teleportation abilities almost weren’t enough to follow it. He
wasn’t going to be able to close the gap between them.</p>
<p>“Let us see how long you can keep this up for,” Han Sen angrily
muttered. He summoned his Dongxuan Armor to replace the Spell armor
he had been wearing. The Dongxuan Armor connected with the entire
universe, allowing him to continually pull power from the universe
itself. That meant that Han Sen’s energy reserves were essentially
infinite. He never had to worry about how much energy things an
activity of technique would cost. He could keep using teleportation
techniques without the fear of exhaustion. Teleporting generally a
lot of energy, but it wouldn’t tire him out now.</p>
<p>After the Dongxuan Sutra became deified, it heightened his
connection with the universe and provided him with even more power.
As long as he wore the Dongxuan Armor, his body was practically a
generator with an infinite amount of gas. He didn’t have to worry
about how much power he used. Even high level deified elites that
were deadlier than Han Sen would lose if things boiled down to a
comparison of energy reserves.</p>
<p>The electric eel didn’t know how strong Han Sen was, so it kept
trying to use its electricity to swim away as fast as possible. Its
electric skills were geno arts that cost a lot of energy, and after
Han Sen chased the beast for half the day, he could sense that it
was starting to slow.</p>
<p>“Run! You keep on running. If you compare your endurance with
mine, you are sure to lose. Even if I let you run for three days, I
can still keep up. This isn’t the first time that I’ve chased the
blood trail of weakening prey,” Han Sen said, feeling rather
cocky.</p>
<p>While he was thinking, he saw a bolt of lightning in front of
him. The electric eel headed into an underwater coral forest and
disappeared.</p>
<p>The coral forest was stately and beautiful. All of the coral was
ten meters high, and it glowed softly, like some ancient, mystic
shrine.</p>
<p>“You think I will be unable to find you if you’re hiding?” Han
Sen curled his lips in a disdainful sneer. He used his Dongxuan
Area to search the entirety of the coral forest.</p>
<p>After his Dongxuan Area became deified, the radius had expanded.
He could now spread his senses over tens of thousands of miles of
the blood coral forest.</p>
<p>With such a wide search range, Han Sen was confident he could
discover even tiny minnows, let alone a giant electric eel.</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s Dongxuan Area covered the whole blood coral
forest, he was given a shock. His senses didn’t seem capable of
penetrating the blood coral forest.</p>
<p>“Weird. What is so special about all of this blood coral? It is
stopping me from using the Dongxuan Area to search for the eel. The
coral itself cannot be special, surely. The forest is so large that
each piece of coral must be worth less than a head of Chinese
cabbage.” Han Sen looked at the blood coral forest with shock.</p>
