	<p>The woman seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. She smiled at Han Sen, but she did not say anything. Quietly,
		she continued eating her meal.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought that the woman was definitely a suspicious character, but he could not be sure if she was the
		traitor of the Destroyed or not.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought of something, but a Dragon man was already approaching his table. He sat down next to Han Sen,
		then looked at Zero and the rest of the girls. “Marquise Han, I have heard that one of your female Marquises
		used one arrow to almost completely obliterate Barr. That is a most impressive feat. I must wonder which of your
		companions were able to do such a thing? Could you tell me?”</p>

	<p>When the Dragon man spoke, the whole restaurant became deathly quiet. Everyone turned to look at their table.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at the Dragon man with a quizzical expression. He had obviously been sent to verify and confirm
		the identity of Han Sen’s companions. Han Sen wasn’t surprised by this, but it was strange how a connection was
		drawn via the attack on Barr.</p>

	<p>When Barr heard the Dragon man speak, he did not move. Obviously, Barr had to be afraid of the figure.</p>

	<p>If the man next to Han Sen was able to stay Barr’s hand through fear, though, then he had to be someone of
		profound notoriety.</p>

	<p>Han Sen kept his gaze on the Dragon man. “This is my daughter Han Meng’er. Those two are my sisters. And this is
		Flower King’s daughter from Narrow Moon. Her name is Qing Li. As for this Feather friend, I must admit I do not
		know her.” Han Sen introduced the rest on his table, but he didn’t mention Little Silver or Little Star.</p>

	<p>After the Dragon man heard what he said, he turned his eyes to the Feather woman. He looked at her and asked,</p>

	<p>“Where have you come from? What business brings you here?”</p>

	<p>The Dragon man’s behavior made Han Sen certain that the Destroyed traitor was in-fact a woman. Either that, or
		the traitor at least had the ability to present themselves as a woman. If this was not the case, then the Dragon
		man would have been sure to ask for the identity of Little Silver and Little Star. His interest remained fixed
		on the women, though. His sudden focus on the Feather woman made it very obvious. Han Sen didn’t think he was
		even bothering to hide it.</p>

	<p>The Feather woman smiled and looked at the Dragon man. “I know of you, Dragon Six. Your title is Toxic Dragon Old
		Six. And while you are a Dragon Duke, I don’t have to answer your questions. This place does not belong to the
		Dragon.”</p>

	<p>Toxic Dragon Old Six froze. He looked at the Feather woman and smiled. “If you know who I am, then you must be
		aware of what I can do. You should spare yourself the trouble and cooperate. I would not like to destroy a
		woman.”</p>

	<p>But that Feather paid no mind to Toxic Dragon Old Six’s threat. She smiled and said, “If I am the person you are
		looking for, killing me wouldn’t get you what you want. And if I am not the correct person, and you did kill me,
		you won’t get what you want and people will become suspicious. They will think that perhaps you were the one
		that took it. I don’t think there is any sound reason for you to kill me here. So, why should I cooperate with
		you? I might be mistaken, of course. Are you cruel enough to slay me right here? If that is the case, then so be
		it.”</p>

	<p>After that, the Feather woman elegantly returned to eating her dish. She totally ignored the simmering anger of
		Toxic Dragon Old Six.</p>

	<p>The muscles in the Dragon’s jaw tightened, and he laughed darkly. “I won’t kill you. There are ten thousand ways
		to make you wish you were dead. That is what I am going to do to you.”</p>

	<p>After that, Toxic Dragon Old Six’s dragon hand clutched a dragon knife. He slowly moved to grab the woman’s head.
	</p>

	<p>But the Feather woman kept eating as if she hadn’t seen it coming. Either that, or she was willing to concede.
		She ignored Toxic Dragon Old Six’s hand completely.</p>

	<p>“Dragon Six, this is where you eat. This isn’t where you shit. Even if she was the traitor of the Destroyed, you
		should allow us, the Destroyed, to do this ourselves. This is none of your business,” a Destroyed Duke said
		coldly.</p>

	<p>When Dragon Six heard that intrusion, his hand stilled. He looked at the Destroyed Duke and grinned. “You want to
		get me mad and goad me into killing her, just so everyone turns their attention to me? Good idea, but I’m not
		that stupid.”</p>

	<p>After that, Toxic Dragon Old Six returned his gaze to the Feather woman. He lowered his hand, got up, and
		returned to sit with the rest of the Dragon.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was entertained. Whether or not the woman was the Destroyed traitor, she was a powerful character. If she
		wasn’t, she couldn’t have remained so chill.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could see that Dragon Six wasn’t going to kill her right there, but she was very calm. And it only took
		her a few sentences to talk down suspicions of her identity. She made people uncertain of what to do with her.
		She seemed rather dangerous, but it brought an air of balance to her character. There were not many people that
		were able to do such a thing.Read comics on our ReadReadNovelFull.live</p>

	<p>There were too many suspicious things about her, though. Even if she didn’t say anything more, she was still
		attracting every eye in the establishment. But no one would do anything to her before they figured this out.
		There were too many factions present with too much at stake.</p>

	<p>“I am full. I appreciate you allowing me to sit here. I believe we will meet again.” The Feather woman smiled at
		Han Sen, then she got up and went upstairs. She was living there.</p>

	<p>“Powerful woman. Might she really be the traitor?” Qing Li pursed her lips.</p>

	<p>“Who knows? Maybe she is. Maybe she isn’t.” Han Sen looked around him, and he noticed all the other races were
		staring at them.</p>

	<p>That woman had established a connection between him and her. And because they were suspicious about her, the
		association made them suspicious about him and his own companions.</p>

	<p>After eating, Han Sen took his companions outside. He noticed that every elite was now gathered in Steel City.
		The whole town was locked down. You could only get in, and you could not get out. Apparently, the authorities
		believed that the traitor was indeed located somewhere in Steel City.</p>

	<p>That was a fairly sensible conclusion, or at least, Han Sen thought so. The only place to hide on Planet Sodi was
		in its sole city, and finding the traitor amongst the hordes of Marquises there would be a very trying task.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen had to wonder why the traitor had selected Planet Sodi. And he pondered what the traitor’s escape
		plan might be.</p>

	<p>If the traitor was really there, the person might be very difficult to locate. Of course, it was only a matter of
		time. They would find the traitor, sooner or later. And if the traitor came here, she had to have been prepared.
		And if the traitor was prepared, then she had to have an escape plan. Han Sen could not think of a way in which
		he might manage that, though.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was giving the matter a lot of thought because he now wanted the Destroyed Bible for himself. If he was
		able to find the traitor before everyone else, he could take it without anyone noticing. He could throw it back
		into the sanctuaries, and that way, no one would ever find it. It would remain hidden even if people thought he
		was the culprit.</p>

	<p>But right now, not even Han Sen knew who the traitor was. He did not know if the traitor had brought the
		Destroyed Bible with them, either.</p>
