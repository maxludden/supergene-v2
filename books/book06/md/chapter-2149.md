The Guardian Spiders did not look as if they could spin silk, but the claws on the ends of their legs were sharper than any knife. Not even the armor of a Marquise fighter could withstand blows from those.

When the red spider emerged from the statue’s mouth, it flew towards the battlers in an instant. Six of its blade-like appendages came swiping down towards the intruders.

Yuya commanded the fighters to split up and scatter a little, and once clear of the spider’s attack, they closed back in to surround the arachnid. They lifted their swords and struck the spider in perfect sync. But it was to no avail, as their swords simply bounced off with a loud clanging noise. They couldn’t even scratch its body.

“That big guy has to be a Duke!” Yunyi shouted.

Yuya nodded in agreement, then drew his own sword. Yunyi then ordered all of the Sky Palace students to strike a single spot on the spider. All their powers came against the creature like a rapid river. The target they had selected was its mouth. They managed to break its jaw, and when that occurred, the spider fell to the ground.

After a few more attacks, Han Sen and the others managed to bring an end to the wicked fiend. Because of their formation, however, Han Sen was unable to get in the last hit.

After the red spider died, no more Guardian Spiders emerged to attack them. They quickly mopped up the last of the Guardian Spiders on the field.

No one from Sky Palace was injured, but a few more of the Demon had gotten torn up. Furthermore, it was Sky Palace that took care of the red spider.

“It looks like I need to hurry up and bring Ning Yue here. I hope that he can develop here,” Han Sen thought to himself.

“Weird. With the power of the three races working together to kill the spiders, this should not have been that hard. Why are there loads of dead Buddhas and Dragons here, and why wasn’t there a single dead spider amongst them upon our entry?” Yunyi looked over one of the spider bodies and frowned.

“It’s because we didn’t touch the spiders.” A voice resonated across the path from someplace at the back of the palace. Dragon Eight appeared with a few of the Dragon and Buddha in tow. There was no sign of the Destroyed, however.

Things suddenly became very tense. The Sky Palace students readied themselves for a fight, but the Buddha and the Dragons all seemed injured. There had been some serious fighting, from the looks of things.

“Do not worry. We are not your enemies now,” Dragon Nine said from behind Dragon Eight.

“Dragon Eight, what do you mean?” Kahn couldn’t see Dragon Nine, and so he asked Dragon Eight.

Dragon Eight cdmly said, “The Destroyed tricked us. They were familiar with this place already, and they knew some o its secrets. They lured us to dangerous parts of the city and got many of us killed. The Destroyed then went deeper into the palace, and we have no idea what they are trying to accomplish.”

“Amitabha! And whatever it is they are planning, it doesn’t look good to us. The Destroyed don’t seem to want us to get out of here alive and let others know what transpired here,” a Buddha Marquise said.

“Are you saying the giant city is in some way related to the Destroyed? I thought the Breakskies were the original inhabitants,” Kahn said skeptically.

“When we reached the back of the palace, we came across a statue with three heads and six arms. It was the exact depiction of the Destroyed. If our assumptions are correct, the Destroyed might once have been part of the Breakskies,” Dragon Eight said.

“If that’s true, then we’re in serious trouble. We cannot leave the planet, and the Destroyed will try to kill us all in order to keep their secrets. They aren’t going to let us leave,” Yunyi said.

Suddenly, a strange voice boomed through the hall. “You guys are right! Don’t even think about getting out alive. Since you’re here, why not die here?”

The voice startled everyone. They looked around for a minute before they realized that it was actually the statue that was talking.

As the metal statue spoke, its body began to move. The statue was previously in a sitting position, but when it stood up, its head broke through the ceiling. It swung a fist and cleared away half of the roof.

Seeing the giant fist continuing down towards them, everyone moved to evade it. But the fist wasn’t the real threat; when the roof above them was broken open, the dragonfly-looking xenogeneics swarmed down through the opening.

The entire place fell into chaos. The metal statue punched a few more times, and the palace was almost entirely demolished.

Han Sen and the others tried slashing the metal statue, but the attacks barely scratched it. They decided to fall back from the palace through the cracks that had formed. But there were many dragonfly xenogeneics buzzing through the air now, and that made their escape more difficult.

While they were sprinting away, more explosions came from the ruins. Many giant metal statues rose out of the destruction and turned in their direction. Han Sen noticed that one of the metal statues was at least a thousand meters tall. It had three heads and six arms, and it looked exactly like a Destroyed.

The four races were all in extreme danger. The metal xenogeneics hounded them relentlessly. The metal statues were scary, too, as their strength was equivalent to a King.

The metal statue that chased Han Sen opened its mouth wide and spat out fire like a geyser of hell’s flames.

Not too far away, there was an extra-evil looking blue giant A godlight shone from its chest, casting a fifty-meter-long beam that destroyed everything that it touched.

The other giants released their own powers. Their eyes were shining red, and they were all headed for Han Sen and the others.

The teams all started to feel their hope dwindle. Although there were many strong Marquises around them, at the end of the day, they were just Marquises. They could not fight the giant metal statues.

Plus, there were metal dragonfly xenogeneics all about. They wouldn’t even have a chance to escape.

“Come over here!” Han Sen realized that fighting would be useless, so he quickly gathered all the Sky Palace people to him. Yuya echoed Han Sen’s command to all the members through the swordmark, in case they did not hear Han Sen’s voice amidst the chaos.

Many of the Sky Palace students came to Han Sen. When Kahn saw this, he brought his few remaining Demons over as well.

Dragon Eight and the Buddha followed, too. They tightened their formation and annihilated the nearby dragonfly xenogeneics, but that hellfire-like power was on its way, and many other powers were coming for them, too. Escaping seemed impossible.

*Boom!*

The metal statue’s fire engulfed them, but it did not incinerate them. Instead, a blue Bai Sema suddenly appeared. Han Sen and his people were inside it, shielded from the scary fires.

When the fire touched the blue Bai Sema, the fire shattered. And then, the power of the other statues hit the Bai Sema. They exerted all their strength, but it was for naught. They could not break the Bai Sema.

A dozen scary metal statues surrounded them. They loomed over the Bai Sema like hungry demons, staring at Han Sen and the other Marquises inside.
