<p>“Sacred Leader made a wish?” Han Sen looked at the woman with
shock.</p>
<p>The woman shook her head. “No. Sacred Leader was a very
self-confident person. If he wanted to achieve immortality, he
would find it by himself. He wouldn’t make a wish to another
creature.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t speak. He listened to the woman, hanging on every
word. After so long spent searching, he was finally touching the
center of this mystery.</p>
<p>The woman sighed and said, “Sacred Leader didn’t want to make a
wish. Instead, he wanted to kill God. But no matter what power he
tried to use, he couldn’t damage God. He couldn’t even ruffle that
being’s clothing. You can’t imagine how shocked Sacred Leader was.
He ruled practically the entire universe, and yet, he couldn’t deal
a speck of damage to this creature claiming to be God.”</p>
<p>“But this self-proclaimed God was also restricted by some sort
of power. He couldn’t kill Sacred Leader either. But after that
encounter, Sacred Leader poured all his strength into finding out
what sort of creature that God was. Many things happened, and in
the end, Sacred Leader did manage to kill one.”</p>
<p>“What? Sacred Leader killed a god?” Han Sen asked, his voice
going hoarse as his throat tightened.</p>
<p>The woman shook her head. “It wasn’t really a god. It was more
of a statue. It was like a statue that was controlled by God.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about that God inside Destiny’s Tower. It was a
statue, more of a representation than an actual god like King
Jun.</p>
<p>“After destroying the statue, Sacred Leader conducted some
tests. He discovered, to his shock, that his lifespan had increased
when he absorbed some power from the statue. Sacred Leader became
incredibly excited. And he thought, ‘If killing a statue of God
added that much to my lifespan, what would happen if I killed a
real one?'”</p>
<p>The woman smiled. “And so Sacred Leader continued researching
how he might kill God. But after his statue was destroyed, that God
hated him and wanted him dead. Sacred Leader was unable to kill
God, but God was also unable to kill Sacred Leader. They were
fighting indirectly, so to speak. When the time came for Sacred
Leader to actually battle God, all of us were incredibly excited.
And yet, at the same time, that began the period of our greatest
suffering.”</p>
<p>Saying this, the woman sighed. “Not all the members of Sacred
shared Sacred Leader’s vision. When he fought with God, Sacred
Leader’s family, friends, subordinates, and even spouses, all
betrayed him for God. And they put Sacred Leader in a difficult
position.”</p>
<p>“Sacred Leader’s research of The Story of Genes was at a dead
end. No one could practice The Story of Genes, so there was no
Super Gene that could threaten God. And by then, Sacred Leader’s
lifespan had come to an end.”</p>
<p>“And then God destroyed Sacred and killed Sacred Leader?” Han
Sen asked.</p>
<p>The woman shook her head. “I don’t know. Before that happened, I
was already entombed in Two World Mountain. By that time, Sacred
Leader had lost everyone. Sacred was unable to hold itself
together, so its collapse was only a matter of time.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard this, he sighed. “Sacred Leader was so
strong, but not even he could defeat God?”</p>
<p>“That isn’t quite accurate. But, at the very least, he let us
know that God can be resisted,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Right. So, why were you sealed inside Two World Mountain?” Han
Sen actually wanted to ask if she had also been tempted by God and
made a wish, but he quickly decided not to.</p>
<p>The woman’s face changed. With a stony face, she said, “That’s
none of your business. I’ve paid my debt in full now. I’ve told you
everything, so you can leave.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he thought, “This woman was encased
in the stone of Two World Mountain. It must have something to do
with the demon spirit. That woman carved into the Sea Demon Car has
to be her.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had these ideas rattling in his head, but he didn’t try
to confirm them. He told her, “I have known you for so long, but I
don’t know your name.”</p>
<p>The woman looked at Han Sen. “What are you hanging around for?
Get lost.”</p>
<p>There was nothing Han Sen could say to that, so he left the
dragon boat. When he turned around to look at the woman, the dragon
boat had soared into space and disappeared. Where she went, he had
no idea.</p>
<p>“Even in Sacred Leader’s, people were already fighting against
these things claiming to be God. But it does seem as if God wins
every time.” Han Sen closed his eyes and continued to think, “When
Sacred was destroyed, did Sacred Leader die? The sanctuaries were a
place for the Sacred Leader to research immortal spirits. The
crystallizers later adopted the realm. Why didn’t any other races
take over the sanctuaries? Why were the crystallizers the only ones
who could? Did the crystallizers know the secrets of the
sanctuaries? Maybe. The woman said that the crystallizers were
tests and that they were very smart. They must have known a few of
Sacred’s secrets, for sure.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about this, and then, his eyes brightened. “That
should mean that the crystallizers continued Sacred Leader’s
research. But what exactly was it that the Sacred Leader
researched? Spirits, beast souls, xenogeneics? The crystallizers
didn’t seem to know exactly what they were doing. Their bodies were
too weak, so they probably wanted to use the sanctuaries to make
their bodies stronger. But Sacred Leader’s research couldn’t have
been for such a simple purpose.”</p>
<p>“I have learned so much. I now know the beginning and the end of
the story. All I am missing are some of the details regarding the
middle. And I also know more about The Story of Genes now, so that
should come in handy for my practice.” Han Sen felt a lot of
relief, and he thought he was close to getting all the answers he
needed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around until he figured out where he was, and
then he started heading back to the white whale. He had to get back
to Bao’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen soon realized the Tianxia System was way too big.
Sticking to one direction was nearly impossible, and there were
clouds everywhere he looked. He couldn’t even see where he was
going.</p>
<p>While he was trying to decide which way to head, he saw the
shape of a few shadows. Several King class people were flying
through the clouds.</p>
<p>“Barr!” Han Sen was shocked when he saw this shadow. It was
Barr.</p>
<p>But Barr wasn’t with Dia Robber this time. There were people of
many different races with him.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” When Barr saw Han Sen, he looked ecstatic. Everyone
sped up to reach Han Sen.</p>
<p>Seeing their faces, Han Sen immediately knew they were coming
after him. There was a ninety percent chance they were after him
for the Extreme King’s bounty.</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated. He activated his Wanjie Rubix Cube and
connected his video stream with the Treasure Identifier Elder.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I have been looking for you for so long!” Barr rushed
towards Han Sen, pulled out his knife, and slashed.</p>
