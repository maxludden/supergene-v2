<p>Han Sen could not hear what everyone was saying, but he did not
care.</p>
<p>After Wang Yuhang conceded, Han Sen thought his fight in the top
eight to reach the top four would not start for a while. That was
because his first two fights had ended blisteringly quickly. The
real fights between others probably wouldn’t be ending any time
soon.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang had only just left, yet an invisible wall came
falling down. Clearly, the fights on the other side already had a
victor determined.</p>
<p>“Is that Qin Xiu?” Han Sen was shocked. To be able to enter a
fight faster than him, the only one he could think of being able to
do that was Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw the person enter the arena, he was
disappointed. He was more disappointed than when he was when he saw
Wang Yuhang.</p>
<p>His opponent for deciding the victor moving from the top eight
to the top four was Ning Yue, another friend of his from Space
Garden.</p>
<p>Ning Yue was the sort of person who always maintained a low
profile, but he had already beaten two powerful sky leaders. He had
already reached the top eight, which suggested he was a supremely
scary opponent. But not many people knew about him. Not many
creatures paid attention to the way he leveled up and advanced.</p>
<p>“It is another human. Where did that human come from? To be able
to reach the top eight suggests he is quite a scary fellow.”</p>
<p>“Is he going to concede as well?”</p>
<p>“No way. Han Sen’s luck cannot be that great.”</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, people ravenously discussed this
new character. They had no clue who Ning Yue was. Without the geno
tablet fights, they would never have known who Ning Yue was.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ning Yue and asked, “Ning Yue, are you
interested in a spar?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was actually curious about how strong Ning Yue was at
this point.</p>
<p>Ning Yue shook his head. “You and I will fight, but not right
now. After you beat Qin Xiu, you and I will fight.”</p>
<p>When they heard Qin Xiu say that, the people of the universe of
kingdoms felt their hearts turn cold. Clearly, Ning Yue was going
to concede too.</p>
<p>Some of the human elites were so jealous that they went crazy.
“Who is this Han Sen? He has won three whole fights without
fighting! These are the sort of geno tablet fights even I could
take part in. I bet you I would win too!”</p>
<p>“It is all because of the fact he is famous. He is an
Annihilation-class main god. He is the God of Wealth. Anyone in
their right mind would treat him with respect and cut him some
slack. Otherwise, why else would Wang Yuhang and Ning Yue happily
concede before him?”</p>
<p>“You are right. Who would not want something better for their
heirs? Being friends with the God of Wealth can give you the chance
of inheriting the God of Wealth blood. I would do a favor like that
for sure.”</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, there were lots of jealous people.
In the geno universe, different elites of different races had lots
of different opinions. They thought Ning Yue was right to
concede.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Ning Yue. Despite seeming like a soft person, he
was in fact a very proud man. He did not want to fight Han Sen this
time.</p>
<p>Ning Yue, who often wore green clothes, left the 33 skies. He
conceded, but he still left with a proud look as if he had been a
winner.</p>
<p>Han Sen successfully reached the top four. He was one of the top
four.</p>
<p>Although many nobles in the universe of kingdoms thought Han Sen
had been playing too many tricks, they could only watch Han Sen
win, rank up, and be unable to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Qin Xiu did not reach the top four yet. He had two
more matches he had to get through. So, Han Sen stayed in his arena
and waited for the top four fighters to be decided on.</p>
<p>On the battleground, many race elites watched Qin Xiu
keenly.</p>
<p>They thought Qin Xiu would be the first person to reach the top
four. Now, Qin Xiu had not reached the top four, which made them
all feel strange.</p>
<p>As they looked in his direction, what they saw gave them all a
shock.</p>
<p>A Break World elite could not help but cry aloud, “Another
human! There are so many humans in the geno tablet fights!”</p>
<p>In his top eight to get to the top-four battle, Qin Xiu’s
opponent was a human too. That person’s geno tablet name was Human
King. It was those two words.</p>
<p>When Qin Xiu looked at Human King, he had a strange expression.
He did not strike immediately. He stared at Human King and tried to
look at something within him.</p>
<p>“Qin Xiu, we meet again.” Human King said hello to Qin Xiu as if
he was meeting an old friend after a long period of time.</p>
<p>“World King God.” Qin Xiu frowned and looked at Human King as he
spoke.</p>
<p>Human King shook his head. “You should be able to discern that I
am not World King God.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked into Human King’s eyes and asked, “In that case,
do you mind telling me who you are?”</p>
<p>Human King remained stoic. He did not seem antagonized by this,
so he continued to speak coldly. “I am Human King. I am the alpha
of the humans of the sanctuaries.”</p>
<p>“I see. World King God used my body to create many interesting
things.” Qin Xiu squinted his eyes as he peered at Human King.</p>
<p>“It is interesting, but I am human,” Human King said with a
smile.</p>
<p>“Not really,” Qin Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You being human or not does not depend on the genes you have,
but whether or not you are here.” Human King pointed at his own
heart.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at Human King coldly. “Do you not know where it
comes from?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you gave it up, so now it is mine,” Human King
said.</p>
<p>“I let it belong to you,” Qin Xiu said. “That is why it is
yours.”</p>
<p>“What if you were to not allow that?” Human King looked at Qin
Xiu with interest.</p>
<p>“Taking it back will not be difficult,” Qin Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You can certainly try.” What Human King said declared Qin Xiu
as a definitive enemy. He did not fall back.</p>
<p>“I was going to let you live because of World King God, but it
is a shame,” Qin Xiu said. He then raised his hands. He tried to
grab Human King.</p>
<p>That hand was like Bury Path God’s hand. It sucked everything in
the world. The whole world was in his hands.</p>
<p>Human King’s body could not block the scary force of suction. He
was drawn into Qin Xiu’s hands.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was going to do to Human King what he had done to Bury
Path God. Just as Human King was going to get sucked into Qin Xiu’s
hand, his body, which had been minimized, suddenly expanded. It
went back to looking like normal. His hand went against Qin Xiu’s
hand. The 10 fingers on his hands completely stuck to the opposing
hand.</p>
<p>Next, an even more shocking thing happened. No one thought Human
King possessed the power necessary to fight Qin Xiu. When their two
hands touched each other, the one who shouted was actually Qin
Xiu.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s black crystal armor had some white light coming out of
it. It was like a lot of silk was coming out of Human King.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” In the geno hall, God Hall Leader stood up
with shock. He looked at Human King with confusion.</p>
<p>Anyone could tell that Qin Xiu’s power was being absorbed by
Human King. Normal people could not tell the power contained spirit
power.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader knew that to be sucked by Human King like this,
Qin Xiu’s body and soul were going to be consumed.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu tried to escape Human King’s hand. He was strong, but
the more power he cast, the more his power was absorbed. It was
like Qin Xiu’s power now belonged to his opponent. Human King took
Qin Xiu’s power and became even stronger.</p>
<p>“I see now.” God Hall Leader watched this for a while. He then
noticed something that surprised him.</p>
