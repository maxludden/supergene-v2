<h2>Not Really Nice Skill</h2>

<p>Han Sen was disappointed. Yan Bei Fei’s knife mind was not bad,
but there was still a distance between it and the universe of
kingdom’s truly top-class elites.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei suddenly stopped unleashing his knife skills. He
stopped attacking Han Sen and held a knife up to the sky.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei looked at Han Sen and asked, “Do you use a
knife?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not use a skill. Yan Bei Fei was a swordsman, so his
keen senses noticed something.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked like he was complimenting him. Although Yan Bei
Fei’s skills were not something supreme, the potential was still
there inside him. He would have plenty of time to improve in the
future.</p>
<p>“Not bad,” Han Sen said with a nod. “You seem to know a thing or
two.”</p>
<p>“Regarding knife skills, I am not as good as you. I lost this
fight.” Yan Bei Fei said that, but he still went on to say, “But
this is a fight I must win. Therefore, I apologize.”</p>
<p>After that, Yan Bei Fei’s body was ablaze with a space-ripping
power. The wings of a blackbird arose behind him.</p>
<p>“Who is Dollar? How was he able to force Yan Bei Fei to use the
noble Yan family’s rare gene race, rip space nine-rob Yan.” The
nobles of the Yan Kingdom saw Yan Bei Fei’s body look weird. It
gave them all a shock.</p>
<p>The rip space nine-rob Yan was a gene race of the Yan Kingdom’s
royal ancestors. It had been living for a few dozen generations,
but it had yet to reach ultimate mode. It still only had an adult
body.</p>
<p>It was incredibly hard for rare gene races to evolve. Even with
a lot of resources, success was not always guaranteed. That was the
case with this rip space nine-rob Yan. Throughout its entire life,
it had to endure nine robberies to reach ultimate mode. The Yan
Kingdom did not have many generations. It had only experienced
eight sky robberies. As such, it had failed to reach ultimate
mode.</p>
<p>Even so, since competitors in the god fights could not combine
with a God Spirit in the god fights, it was the biggest amount of
power he could muster.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Every kingdom had God Spirit gene races. In an event like the
god fights, no one dared to use one. It would have also exposed the
potential trump cards of a kingdom and likely result in other
kingdoms trying to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Therefore, of the gene races that could take part, the strongest
potential gene race was a rare gene race with an ultimate body. The
rip space nine-rob Yan was almost that strong.</p>
<p>If it were a normal fight, Yan Bei Fei would have rather lost
than use the rip space nine-rob Yan. This time, he needed to help
Yan Dan. No matter what it took, he was not going to lose. The
moment he finished combining with the rip space nine-rob Yan, Yan
Bei Fei’s entire body was like a god in the sky. Every move he made
was able to tear through space. It carried a powerful space power.
Han Sen looked at Yan Bei Fei and coldly said, “That is nothing. A
gene race is an extension of one’s power. Bring out your best
power!” “As you wish. I will try my best this time.” Yan Bei Fei
slowly put the Flying Yan knife back into its scabbard. He touched
the handle again.</p>
<p>Time appeared to freeze. Space was frozen too. When Yan Bei Fei
drew the knife, space looked like it had been ripped by his strike.
He carried an incredible speed and power as he slashed toward Han
Sen.</p>
<p>The knife, which ripped through space, was like a teleportation
strike. Ordinary humans were unable to dodge something like that.
It was a shame that Han Sen was not a normal human. He was
excellent when it came to teleporting, and he had fought against
elites that could infinitely teleport. A power like that was
something people believe resulted in a one-hit kill. To him, it was
not going to be as effective as the Yan Return.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. He raised his right hand and used his palm like
a knife. He moved his body. He was going to go against Yan Bei
Fei’s rip space knife air.</p>
<p>Like a fleeting shadow, Han Sen and Yan Bei Fei suddenly had
their backs facing each other. Ordinary people had not been able to
see what happened.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei slowly turned around. He asked Han Sen, “What was
that knife skill?”</p>
<p>“It was just a random wave. It was not a knife skill.” After Han
Sen said that, he did not look back at Yan Bei Fei. He merely
walked to the exit.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei’s chest gushed blood. Several knife marks appeared
across his shoulders and all the way down to his belly. They dyed
his armor red. His body fell out of the space battleground.</p>
<p>The nobles and young people of the Yan Kingdom watching the
fight went silent. No one believed that after using the ultimate
gene race rip space nine-rob Yan, the very famous Flying Yan
Swordsman of the Yan Kingdom was killed with one hit.</p>
<p>“Very good, but not really a knife skill. I am afraid this
person’s knife skills are too rare.” Zhuo Dong Lai looked at Han
Sen with a strange sort of stare. He looked as if he was ready to
fight.</p>
<p>He was supposed to just watch Yan Bei Fei. He did not expect to
witness this turn of events.</p>
<p>“Go and dig me up some information on this. Find out where the
God of Wealth Temple lies.” Yan Dan looked calm as he made his
commands. In his eyes, the zest for murder blazed.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei was not born from the same mother, but their
relationship was like that of real brothers. He was going to avenge
Yan Bei Fei’s death no matter what it took.</p>
<p>“Dan, I could not help you this time.” Yan Bei Fei was shaky as
he walked out of the screen of light. He was covered in blood, but
he was not dead.</p>
<p>“Brother Two, you are not dead!” Yan Dan was as much shocked as
he was happy. He quickly ran forward to hold Yan Bei Fei. “That
person kept me alive,” Yan Bei Fei said. “That guy is certainly
mysterious. My knife skills were like child’s play in front of him.
You will have to be careful when you encounter him.” He then passed
out in Yan Dan’s arms.</p>
<p>Yan Dan shouted, “Hurry! Get a doctor to heal Brother Two!”</p>
<p>Because it was just the beginning, no one thought Yan Bei Fei
would lose. Not many people believed the fight would be that
exciting. Aside from the nobles of the Yan Kingdom who focused on
Yan Bei Fei, very few people watched that fight.</p>
<p>People quickly noticed that Yan Bei Fei had been kicked out in
the first round. It shocked everyone. When they looked at Yan Bei
Fei’s opponent, their faces were frozen. The names Dollar and God
of Wealth were too strange for them to comprehend.</p>
<p>In the Yan Kingdom, those two names had become famous. No one
knew the names before, but now everyone did.</p>
<p>That was especially true about Dollar. When the Yan Kingdom’s
nobles and civilians talked about what happened, their teeth felt
itchy.</p>
<p>Killing people was just having heads strewn across the floor.
Yan Bei Fei lost. When Han Sen said that it was just a random wave
and not a knife skill, it humiliated the people of the Yan Kingdom.
They thought Han Sen had deliberately humiliated Yan Bei Fei.</p>
<p>They did not know that Han Sen really did randomly wave. He did
not employ any knife skill. Han Sen was merely being honest.</p>
<p>In this world, what hurt people the most was the truth. So the
people of the Yan Kingdom hated Han Sen to the bone. They wanted
his next opponent to teach him a lesson. They wanted him to get
stepped on and humiliated.</p>
<p>No matter what, the people of the Yan Kingdom remembered Dollar
and God of Wealth. It was like sharp knives had been used to carve
those names in their hearts. They could not forget this, even if
they wanted to. It was a bloody humiliation.</p>
