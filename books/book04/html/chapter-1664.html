    <p>
      Han Sen looked glum. He had been keeping an eye on the entire shelter, and
      Bone Witch died under his watch. What’s more, he couldn’t even tell how.
      Although he had been drinking tea with Han Menger and Bao’er, Dongxuan
      Aura was on the whole time. It was surveying everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw Bone Witch clearly. She had been watching from atop the tower,
      and as she was on her patrol, she simply died. There had been no warning
      signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Han Sen did not witness any external power come to kill Bone Witch. It
      was like she had suddenly died of old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng arrived at the tower, and she didn’t look too happy, either.
      She had been watching the shelter as well. She had no idea how Bone Witch
      died, and that made her even angrier than Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen and Lin Feng came running, but they did not speak when they saw the
      body. This had exceeded everyone’s expectations, and no one could tell how
      Bone Witch had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Sky Mirror was there, and if Bone Witch had been hurt by anything,
      she should have respawned at the mirror. But there she was, undeniably
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>Everyone in the shelter was now very afraid.</p>
    <p>
      They thought that with the mirror in their shelter, they had no reason to
      fear death. But now that the mirror had lost its effectiveness, their
      nerves started to creep up on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that they did not seem to have the mirror’s protection, many creatures
      were very scared when they thought about the elites that were coming for
      them. They thought that their days were numbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They buried Bone Witch’s body, and then Han Sen called for a gathering
      where every key figure of the shelter had to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Queen, you and Lin Feng should return to the Alliance. I will call you
      back when things are resolved,” Han Sen spoke to the humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen shook her head, and Wang Yuhang said angrily, “Little Han, who do
      you think we are?! Do you think we are the sort of people who leech off
      others and run off at the first sight of danger?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng patted Wang Yuhang on the shoulder, and added, “Calm down, Little
      Uncle. You know that is not what he was implying.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Lin Feng spoke directly to Han Sen. “This situation is grim.
      We don’t know how they managed to get Bone Witch, but there are certain
      predictions we can make.”
    </p>
    <p>“What is there to predict?” Tang Zhenliu did not understand.</p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng smiled and said, “The situation seems dire, but if you were an
      enemy that could kill others randomly and at will… Would you go for a
      simple guard? It means that there is a limit to the enemy’s power. This
      foe is unable to kill anyone they wish to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe he wants to play catch? Maybe he just wants to scare us to death?”
      Tang Zhenliu said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. From Blacksteel Wolf to Bone Witch, the truth is, the creatures that
      have died aren’t very important. If I was the enemy, I’d go after someone
      like Cheap Sheep or Green Cow,” Jing Jiwu said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why us? Why not kill you first?” Cheap Sheep and Green Cow fired back
      angrily at Jing Jiwu.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is because you are Han Sen’s right and left hands. You two are
      integral. If they wanted Han Sen to die of fright, they’d at least go for
      you two first,” Jing Jiwu said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cheap Sheep and Green Cow heard this, they patted their chests.
      “Right! They don’t kill important people like us. That must mean the
      enemy’s power is limited.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A few people around the table smiled. Even though Cheap Sheep and Green
      Cow were very important members of the shelter, they were probably the
      easiest to kill. That was what Jing Jiwu was saying. If they weren’t dead
      yet, it meant the enemy did have a limit and could not kill any they
      desired to.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We need to find out how this enemy is killing our people. We also need to
      learn what this limit is.” Lin Feng thought for a minute, then said,
      “There are no leads for us to follow now, so we’ll have to wait and keep
      our eyes out for something.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What if someone else dies and we still can’t learn anything new?” Cheap
      Sheep felt quite worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If many people die, we may not be able to see how they are killed, but
      more info can lead to better predictions,” Lin Feng said.
    </p>
    <p>“What kind of method is that?!” Cheap Sheep exclaimed.</p>
    <p>“Do you have any better ideas?” Jing Jiwu looked at Cheap Sheep.</p>
    <p>
      The sheep stopped talking. Even Han Sen and Gu Qingcheng hadn’t been able
      to find out how Bone Witch had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng and the others did not want to go to the Alliance. Han Sen spoke
      to them about changing the patrols slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, when there was no killing, Han Sen brought Bao’er with him on
      patrol. When he saw Cheap Sheep and Green Cow, he almost jumped out of his
      skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were covered in yellow paper. The pieces of
      paper were charms with words scribbled upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charms were planted on their heads, bums, and every bodily crevice.
      Green Cow even had one that looked like a skirt. It was very obvious.
    </p>
    <p>“Where did you get these from?” Han Sen asked with surprise.</p>
    <p>
      “Boss, we asked Wang Yuhang to buy them for us. Apparently, it cost quite
      a bit. He said they had been blessed by a god. They can keep us safe and
      prevent evil from ever touching us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have lucky charms, too. If you wear them, your fortune increases. Even
      if we end up in a battle, I am sure we will be the last to fall. I bought
      this for you, Boss. You should wear it”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow spoke with mystic tones in their voices. Cheap
      Sheep moved forward to present the charm to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not know what to say, though. Wang Yuhang had obviously
      scammed a lot of money out of Cheap Sheep and Green Cow.
    </p>
    <p>“Thanks a lot.” Han Sen took the bag that they offered.</p>
    <p>
      “You are our boss. We don’t want anything bad happening to you,” Cheap
      Sheep said.
    </p>
    <p>“We will live until the very end,” Green Cow said.</p>
    <p>“We will all live,” Han Sen said, and placed the charm in a bag.</p>
    <p>
      Then, Cheap Sheep said, “Boss, you need to hang it on your chest. Let me
      do it for you. And I also got this charm for Bao’er.” As Cheap Sheep
      spoke, Han Sen looked increasingly glum. He looked beyond the walls of the
      shelter and heard a bell ring.
