  After the purple copper sword said that, she thought, “That member of the soldiers will be absorbed by me. Even if I lose, you will not get anything. But I, Asura, will not lose.”

“Interesting. I do not know what sort of method you are referring to.” Han Sen was interested. He did not want the little girl to die, but he did not want to be her weapon for all time. Perhaps the purple copper sword’s method was able to help him take the soul mark away from the little girl’s soul.

“After we find out which of us is the victor, I will tell you the method,” the purple copper sword said.

“Sure.” Han Sen asked, “How would you like to bet?”

When the purple copper sword realized that Han Sen had fallen for her bait, she went ahead to say, “Your body is so strong. I believe you are very confident in that as well.”

“I am that confident.” Han Sen was not holding back. His Jadeskin had a 60% Break World rate. Even Qin Xiu’s clone sword was unable to damage him. That alone showed just how strong he was.

The purple copper sword suggested, “In that case, how about you and I suffer the same power attack? We will see which one of us loses.”

“A power attack cannot be done by us attacking each other.” Han Sen thought what the purple copper sword said was not right, so he frowned.

“Smart.” The purple copper sword laughed. “The 33 skies are quite amazing. Many mysterious creatures are roaming the realm, and there are countless mysterious weapons scattered across Soldier Weapon Sky in particular. In the past few days, I was able to find a scary weapon. Its power is very scary. I believe it could destroy everything. You and I should use that for the foundation of our bet. Under its power attacks, we should see which of us will end up falling back first. Are you up for that?”

Han Sen knew the purple copper sword was quite an obscene person. The purple copper sword was not too dissimilar to himself. They would do anything to win. For the sword to so quickly agree to another bet meant there had to be a ploy at play. There was a conspiracy to uncover.

“I want to see what that weapon is first.” Han Sen did not dare agree to the sword’s terms.

The purple copper sword was quick to answer. “Okay. Come with me.”

The purple copper sword started to fly. She flew in a direction of Soldier Weapon Sky.

Upon seeing the purple copper sword fly, the girl had something cross her mind. She grabbed ahold of the black jian. In the next second, the jian started to fly and follow the purple copper sword. Han Sen carried the girl along as he followed after the purple copper sword.

“Little Black, where are you going?” The little girl was carried by the big jian. She knew Han Sen could not answer her, but she asked him anyway.

The jian and a sword flew fast, but they flew for half a day until the purple copper sword finally found a place to land.

Han Sen saw the ground was at the cusp of a valley. He saw a giant hammer. It was grey and black. It looked as if it had been made of iron. It looked very heavy.

It looked mighty enough to crush an entire building even if it were to merely touch it. He couldn’t imagine what might happen if it was swung properly.

That scary and big hammer was sitting there in the valley. It made the valley look like a little hole. It was very intimidating.

The purple copper sword did not get close to the hammer. It flew to the nearby spear. The sword struck the spear, and the spear broke in half. Half the spear flew toward the big hammer.

Pang!

The spear was still 300 feet away from the hammer. Suddenly, an invisible power shook it into dust.

“That is a very powerful shaking power,” Han Sen said while looking at the big hammer.

The purple copper sword looked cocky. “This big hammer has a scary shaking power. Do you think you are strong enough to go in there with me?”

“Whoever chickens out is a loser, right?” Han Sen coldly asked.

“Yes,” the purple copper sword replied.

“In that case, you and I can go in together.” Han Sen quickly agreed. He took the girl with him as he approached the hammer.

“OK.” The purple copper sword was happy that Han Sen had agreed. “The big hammer’s shaking power is not enough to break that jian’s body, but the shaking power will keep adding up to become stronger and stronger. The longer it stays there, the greater the shaking power will become. With that continuous buildup of power, it is only a matter of time before your body fails. Do not forget you are also carrying a member of the soldiers.”

A jian and a sword flew toward the big hammer. Even though they were 300 hundred feet away from the big hammer, the jian and sword started to shake. An uncontrollable buzzing noise sounded. Even vortexes were visible in the space around them. Space was twisted by that shaking power.

When that shaking power was there, Han Sen’s body had an ice-jade shield. He kept himself and the girl in it to filter the shaking power away.

The purple copper sword did not use any power. It used its body to fight against the shaking power. The purple copper sword’s sword body kept quivering, resulting in the generation of sword buzzing sounds.

That shaking power was very unique. It was like a shockwave that came wave by wave. The shockwave kept getting bigger and bigger.

When the shaking power was activated, it did not feel difficult to fight back. When the shaking power continuously built up, the shaking frequency and amount were more.

Jadeskin’s structure was very tight. With that shaking power, however, gaps were forming.

The ice-jade shield blocked Qin Xiu’s clone attacks, but it also started to have gaps. While the shaking continued, those marks became more obvious.

“That’s a very powerful shaking power.” Han Sen complimented it, but he was not at all surprised. He used a beehive structure in the ice-jade shield. He stabilized the ice-jade shield to reduce the effectiveness of the shaking power on the ice-jade shield.

Of course, after using the beehive structure, the shaking power could not affect the ice-jade shield much.

The purple copper sword saw that and coldly laughed. “If you think you can block the shaking power like that, you are too naive. This big hammer has more than just shaking power. It has only just started.”

It drew Han Sen there because it knew it could win. The purple copper sword moved and flew to the big hammer.
