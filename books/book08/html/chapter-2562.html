<p>The bronze furnace refused to go forward, so Han Sen had no
choice but to leave it behind. He went on ahead with Li Keer and
Exquisite.</p>
<p>The bronze furnace continued to spit out fire behind Han Sen,
creating a sentence that read, “Don’t go. There is danger!”</p>
<p>Han Sen asked the bronze furnace what the danger was, but it
didn’t elaborate. All it did was continue to warn Han Sen of some
danger, and that he should stay away from there.</p>
<p>“You wait for me here.” Han Sen didn’t think there was any
reason that he should be afraid; there were few creatures in the
core area that could threaten him these days.</p>
<p>The three of them kept flying. The bronze furnace was too
reluctant to follow them.</p>
<p>After a short while of flight, the three of them saw a
xenogeneic soaring through space. As soon as they noticed the
xenogeneic, the creature noticed them, too. It roared and flew over
to them.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic growled like a crocodile, but it looked to have
been built out of red metal. Bat-like metal wings spread from the
creature’s back, and it flew very quickly.</p>
<p>Lights gleamed across the edges of its metallic body as it cast
an area. Metal chains appeared within that area, shooting out and
binding anything that moved.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were tied down by those metal chains. Han
Sen struggled and noticed that the metal chains were so strong,
they were too hard for even him to break them.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his strength, but suddenly, there was a flash.
The creature was cut in half, and the chains that bound them
vanished.</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” Exquisite said coldly. Then, she flew over to the
King xenogeneic and dug out its xenogeneic gene.</p>
<p>“Lady Exquisite is quite strong,” Han Sen complimented.</p>
<p>The hit earlier was nothing short of perfection. It happened so
fast that Han Sen hadn’t even seen what skill she unleashed to
destroy that xenogeneic. Her skills were strong, there was no doubt
of that.</p>
<p>But it made Han Sen curious. It had been a long time since he’d
stayed in Sky Palace, but he had never heard of Li Keer or
Exquisite in the time he spent there. With their powers, there was
no way he could have avoided hearing stories about them.</p>
<p>Exquisite, with an absence of emotion, said, “That was an
ordinary space cutting skill.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said nothing. Space geno arts were difficult
to practice. Exquisite made it sound as if the skill was nothing
extraordinary, but Han Sen knew she was just acting.</p>
<p>“We’ve just arrived, and already we’ve encountered a King
xenogeneic. We are lucky. We should be able to earn a lot from this
trip,” Li Keer said.</p>
<p>“Are the xenogeneics around here the same as that one?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. These xenogeneics are called Chain Demon Crocodiles. They
rule this area. There are many Marquises and Dukes here. Kings and
half-deifieds, also. There is a legendary crocodile god here, as
well, but we have never seen it,” Li Keer answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. Then, the three of them proceeded. There were
many Chain Demon Crocodiles in the nearby asteroids. Crocodiles
began to emerge from the asteroid belts, and while Han Sen examined
the creatures, Exquisite was already moving.</p>
<p>Exquisite immediately flew over to the Chain Demon Crocodiles,
her white clothes trailing behind her. There were tens of thousands
of them, but most of them were low level. Han Sen didn’t see a
single King class crocodile in their midst.</p>
<p>Just as Exquisite was about to reach the hordes of demon
crocodiles, her body suddenly vanished from sight. The geno art
used by Exquisite was familiar to Han Sen. She had teleported.</p>
<p>But Exquisite’s proficiency with teleportation abilities had
already reached Space Teleportation. She was able to cross great
distances with the skill. Han Sen was unable to see her amidst the
crocodile group.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Han Sen heard a squeal. Then,
Exquisite’s body appeared before them again. In her hand, she held
a xenogeneic gene that was shaped like a metal cogwheel. It was the
same xenogeneic gene that could be found in the King class
crocodiles.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. There was only one King there. Killing these
lower-level ones is pointless,” Exquisite said. Then, she flew
away.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched Exquisite leave. He thought of something, and a
smile crossed his face. Then he followed.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if Exquisite was deliberately stealing the
King xenogeneics, but if this was to continue, Exquisite was going
to kill all the Kings. If that happened, this trip would have been
a waste of time.</p>
<p>“The Sky can be so scary. I’ve never heard of Exquisite before,
but she is so strong.” Han Sen then got to thinking about how he
might steal the demon crocodiles from beneath her nose.</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s speed, any crocodiles below King class had no
hope of chasing after them. They would be left in the dust.</p>
<p>“The giant planet up ahead has loads of demon crocodiles. Should
we go there?” Li Keer pointed at the planet as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Han Sen nodded. If there were lots of crocodile Kings,
then he wouldn’t have to fight against Exquisite for the kills.</p>
<p>“This planet is like a white dwarf. Its temperature and gravity
are scary, so be careful,” Li Keer warned them.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the dark red planet and was shocked. Compared
to ordinary stars, white dwarfs were very small.</p>
<p>But this white dwarf up ahead was very large. It looked like it
would take forever for them to fly to it unless they used Space
Teleportation. Luckily, though, the core area’s space wasn’t like
ordinary space. There wasn’t a lot of space between the planets
like there was in the Alliance.</p>
<p>They entered the orbit of their destination, and Han Sen felt
the heat immediately start to burn his body. A powerful force of
gravity was pulling him down.</p>
<p>“This gravity is very strong.” Han Sen was shocked. Even with
his level of power, he could still feel the effects of that
gravity. The mass of that planet was unimaginable.</p>
<p>While it was an annoyance, Han Sen could still fly with that
amount of gravity. As he dropped toward the planet, he felt like
the powerful forces acting on him were slowing down everything
around him. Even Break Space Teleportation was really slow now.</p>
<p>Quickly, Han Sen discovered two Chain Demon Crocodiles lying on
the planet’s surface. This made Han Sen very happy, because the two
Chain Demon Crocodiles were Kings. They had dark red metal armor
that looked very intimidating.</p>
<p>“Are the demon crocodiles on this planet King class?” Han Sen
thought it was possible. The planet’s temperature and gravity were
scary, after all. Ordinary demon crocodiles probably couldn’t
survive such conditions.</p>
<p>If Duke demon crocodiles went to the surface, they probably
wouldn’t even be able to move there. The scary gravity would
probably crush them, not to mention the insane temperatures that
would likely melt their bodies.</p>
