	<p>Han Sen believed going up against Six Paths’ Life Sword would be difficult. After all, Life Sword resided at the
		heart of Six Paths. It was his essence. If you took away the limitations of skills, all he had left was
		primitive drive.</p>

	<p>Six Paths’ sword skills, when cast, were something scary to behold.</p>

	<p>This would be the sixth sword skill, and it was the only one from the set Han Sen had heard about, but not
		actually seen in action.</p>

	<p>It wasn’t that Six Paths did not want to show it to Han Sen, it was just that Life Sword was something of a
		personal achievement to learn. It was pointless to simply see it.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen knew it was strong. He just didn’t know how strong. And now that he could see it, he was getting a
		feel for its power. It wasn’t as threatening as Blood Sword, though.</p>

	<p>A battle that was based on reactions and strength was something Han Sen was good at. That was what he did before
		he amassed an array of hyper geno arts, after all.</p>

	<p>Six Paths had learned a lot, but Han Sen’s combat abilities weren’t anything modest. He also had the advantage of
		the Dongxuan Aura. It would be an advantage that lent itself to any of his fights.</p>

	<p>Seeing Dollar suppressing Six Paths, the audience was all in shock.</p>

	<p>Han Sen kept flicking his fingers until Six Paths inevitably had to fall back. He couldn’t fight him.</p>

	<p>The fingers of his opponent were so sharp. The Six Paths Sword was soon delivered a deep scratch.</p>

	<p>“Scary. Too scary! Who is this Dollar?”</p>

	<p>“Dollar is good! This is the rhythm to beating Six Paths.”</p>

	<p>“Strong! He is strong! He is my idol!”</p>

	<p>Some of the demigods who weren’t as talented hadn’t been able to tell what they were seeing before, but this bit
		was plain for all to understand. Six Paths had been suppressed by his opponent and couldn’t fight back.</p>

	<p>Seeing Six Paths incur more wounds across his body, Sacred Emperor frowned. “Is Six Paths Emperor going to lose?”
	</p>

	<p>Gu Qingcheng’s expression was complicated. “It looks like Six Paths is going to lose.”</p>

	<p>But Han Sen did not think this. Six Paths had used all six of his sword skills and had ended up suppressed, yes,
		but Han Sen didn’t think it was going to be an easy win.</p>

	<p>Six Paths’ eyes were still brimming with clarity and the fire of combat.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was doing something that was akin to damming a river with mud, or throwing rocks onto a spreading fire.
		It seemed useful, but there was that constant worry that it was only a matter of time before the containment was
		rendered useless in a sudden outburst of power that been held back and built up.</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew he couldn’t stop. He attacked faster and faster with the desire to kill Six Paths before the sudden
		frenzy could manifest.</p>

	<p>Blood was spilling and bones were breaking. Six Paths’ wounds were getting worse, but despite all that, his eyes
		shone brighter.</p>

	<p>The moment Six Paths relaxed his body, Han Sen felt as if he had just gone eye-to-eye with a viper. He stumbled
		back with goosebumps. He looked at Six Paths, who was covered in blood and still standing.</p>

	<p>Six Paths was still clutching his sword, but the tip was low against the ground. The swordminds were all gone,
		and he looked like someone who had forgotten how to use the blade.</p>

	<p>“Thank you. Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to reach this step.” Six Paths looked at Han Sen with
		excitement.</p>

	<p>Han Sen just looked back at Six Paths without saying anything. The spirit still looked like an ordinary person,
		but there was a sudden aura of danger. Han Sen hadn’t felt this level of danger before.</p>

	<p>“As a reward, please accept my final sword.” Six Paths said this right before lifting Six Paths Sword.</p>

	<p>When he raised that sword, it felt as if all the power in the world was now coming down on Han Sen. It was as if
		the sword was at the center of the universe, and everything existed around it.</p>

	<p>“Six Paths in one?” Han Sen looked surprised.</p>

	<p>Heart Sword was about wielder’s true self. Sky Sword was about the sky and the earth. Sonic Sword was about the
		acoustical powers. Spirit was about the spirit. Blood Sword was all about living. Life Sword was about
		existence.</p>

	<p>When they all combined into one, it made Six Paths become a part of the world itself. Like a true swordmaster,
		his sword became the center of the world.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The power he had gathered up was too much, and the unbreakable arena was actually shattered. The sword created a
		giant crater in the ground, as the previously standing Six Paths was lifted into the air to float above the
		ground. The entire power was gathered there.</p>

	<p>The audience was in shock. They noticed that all their powers had been magnetized towards Six Paths. It felt as
		if they themselves were going to be processed into the sword he wielded.</p>

	<p>Some of the audience quickly cast skills to prevent power leakage, but many of the weaker beings were unable to
		do this, and they found their energy stolen and pulled into the sword.</p>

	<p>The strong spirits could stop this from happening naturally. But that had to be possible; otherwise, none would
		have been able to watch the match.</p>

	<p>“Six Paths is becoming a god!” Outer Sky leader looked at Six Paths like an unrivaled swordmaster.</p>

	<p>Many of the other elites were shocked, too. “After this fight, Six Paths is sure to become a god very soon.”</p>

	<p>“I can’t believe he is breaking through now. Six Paths is on the verge of becoming a god. Dollar is in trouble.”
		Gu Qingcheng looked glum.</p>

	<p>Tang Zhenliu looked to be in shock, and he couldn’t even find the words to speak. Simply seeing it all through
		the Martial Hall’s tablet was enough to make him feel suffocated.</p>

	<p>“I am the sword. The sword is me. A sword can traverse six paths and become one.” When Six Paths pointed his
		sword to the sky, his power had reached maximum capacity. The way he spoke made it sound as if he was a god, and
		it frightened all those who listened. Creatures that had weak minds were already prepared to obey him, as if he
		truly was a god.</p>

	<p>Creatures with strong wills could feel the pressure, as well, and they felt as if they wanted to throw up because
		of it.</p>

	<p>After that, Six Paths swung his sword. A swordlight was cast through the arena, covering it in its entirety. All
		in its proximity were swallowed.</p>

	<p>In that moment, Six Paths was like a god that could not be beaten. Everyone believed that it was now the end.</p>
