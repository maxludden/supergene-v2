<p>Exquisite didn’t answer, and the two of them continued on toward
the heavenly land.</p>
<p>Flocks of phoenixes flew overhead, and holy springs were
suspended in the air, surrounded by clouds. Giant dragons walked
majestically across the ground, which was covered with many strange
flowers and rich green grass. There were many rare animals, too.
There were strange and exotic things everywhere that Han Sen
looked.</p>
<p>Within seconds of landing, Han Sen had seen three deified
xenogeneics. One of them was a deified plant.</p>
<p>“This is so scary… I understand now why the Very High are
regarded as the greatest race in the universe. There are so many
resources here. The mighty Extreme King have far less than this…
No… They can’t even be compared. Put side by side with the Very
High, the Extreme King would look like a group of hobos.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was in too much shock to speak. Countless powerful
xenogeneics were roaming about. And in the nearby forest, deified
xenogeneics were everywhere.</p>
<p>Still aboard Equisite’s ship, they flew onward for tens of
thousands of miles. There were countless deified xenogeneics
nearby, but they had yet to encounter any of the Very High.</p>
<p>“Ever since our race found this place in ancient times, our
elders have been bringing interesting xenogeneics here. After god
knows how many billions of years, this is what has become of the
place. But my people reproduce very slowly. There are only two
hundred of us left now, and we cannot use the vast majority of the
resources that we have gathered over the ages. However, the
creatures we have collected breed and breed; they are the fruits of
our labor,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>SO</p>
<p>Han Sen understood why the Very High could make so many deified
elites now. This place was like an organic treasury. With the
resources available, creating deified elites would be easy.</p>
<p>Bao’er was lying comfortably on the floor of the ship, looking
around at the weird flowers and strange grasses. They didn’t look
special, but Han Sen knew Bao’er. He could tell she was prepared to
take action.</p>
<p>The small boat continued to fly forward. After a while, Han Sen
started to think that there was a problem with the flow of time in
this place. He couldn’t accurately determine how much time had
passed since he first saw land.</p>
<p>Their ship was drawing close to some cloud-covered mountains,
and when they came within range, Han Sen finally saw that the
mountains held a collection of palaces. They had been built into
and around the mountains, fitting perfectly between them. Faintly
obscured by the haze of the clouds, it was like a picture of
heaven.</p>
<p>When the ship landed at the foot of the mountains, Han Sen
noticed a stone staircase. It led all the way up to the stone
palace at the mountain’s peak. There was a Very High man descending
the steps.</p>
<p>“Exquisite, you have returned!”</p>
<p>Perhaps there was such a thing as a place where the grass was
greener, for being born in such a heavenly environment seemed to
breed people gracious enough to befit it.</p>
<p>“Second Brother.” Exquisite stepped off the ship and bowed
before the man.</p>
<p>The man waved his hand, signaling for her to refrain from such
politeness. He looked at Han Sen and saw Bao’er sitting on his
shoulder. He frowned. “Third Sister, why have you brought two
people? Which one is your silkworm?”</p>
<p>“He is Han Sen. I selected him. That is his daughter. He had to
bring her with him because there was no one else willing to look
after her in his absence,” Exquisite explained.</p>
<p>The man nodded and stopped looking at Han Sen and Bao’er. He
told Exquisite, “Go. The altar is ready. We may complete the
contracts now.”</p>
<p>Exquisite nodded and told Han Sen, “You guys follow me. Don’t
stray too far.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He stepped off the ship. As soon as he left the
boarding ramp, his body felt as if it was being crushed by a
mountain. He moved a bit slower than usual.</p>
<p>“The environment of Outer Sky is different from that of the
outside universe. You’ll just have to get used to it,” Exquisite
told Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He remained silent and followed Exquisite up the
grand staircase. He glanced around.</p>
<p>“Sister, you could have chosen Lone Bamboo of the Sky. Why did
you pick a crystallizer? Crystallizer bodies are unremarkable. They
cannot amount to much…” the man said to Exquisite as they ascended
the steps. He certainly didn’t beat around the bush.</p>
<p>“Why does this guy not look like one of the Very High?” Han Sen
wondered as he inspected the man. The man’s insult hadn’t bothered
him.</p>
<p>The fellow looked different from Li Keer, Bixi, and Exquisite.
He looked fairly average, in truth. He didn’t appear to be as cold
as the other Very High that Han Sen had encountered so far.</p>
<p>Exquisite said something non-committal, clearly not interested
in the conversation.</p>
<p>The four of them reached the halfway point on their journey up
the mountain. There, they found a stone pavilion residing on a
stone platform. The stone pavilion’s name was written as “Half-Life
Fate.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what it meant, but another man soon
approached. He waved his hand at Han Sen and said, “You’ve come
here to be Exquisite’s silkworm? According to the rules of the Very
High, only someone with a nine armor talent is eligible to sign the
contract. Allow me to test you.”</p>
<p>The man didn’t seem to know Han Sen had already been tested. He
walked him to the pavilion and opened a stone canister that was
cradled by a stone table. When the lid was removed, Han Sen could
see another God Spirit Touch lying inside the canister.</p>
<p>“Give the God Spirit Touch a drop of your blood and wait for the
results.” The man pointed at the God Spirit Touch for Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Second Brother, there is no need to test him. Brother Bixi has
already tested him with a God Spirit Touch. He has an armor talent
figure of eleven. He is more than suitable to be a silkworm,”
Exquisite said.“An eleven armor talent? He’s just a crystallizer.
He cannot have an eleven armor talent. You’re joking with us,
surely. Or did Bixi make a mistake? The meager talents of
crystallizers aside, even we of the Very High very rarely produce
offspring with an armor talent of eleven… So he still needs to
undergo this test. I don’t want a mistaken test result to delay
this process.” The man’s mouth was like a machine gun as he kept
talking.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t bother paying attention to the man’s rambling. He
approached the stone canister and lifted the middle finger of his
right hand. He squeezed out a drop of blood and gave it to the God
Spirit’s Touch.</p>
<p>Exquisite’s eyes locked on the God Spirit Touch. Despite what
she had said earlier, she did want to find out if the test
conducted before was legitimate. Saying Han Sen had an eleven armor
talent still seemed ludicrous, so a second test was warranted.</p>
<p>The man stared at the God Spirit Touch, too. He didn’t believe a
crystallizer could have an eleven armor talent. He thought
something must have happened when Bixi tested Han Sen, and that was
why the result was incorrect.</p>
<p>They all stared at the God Spirit Touch intensely. But after the
God Spirit Touch consumed the blood, it stopped moving. They kept
watching for some time, but the creature remained completely still.
It didn’t even shed a single shell.</p>
<p>Exquisite was surprised, and the men thought this was strange.
No matter how bad a crystallizer was, there was no way the bug
wouldn’t discard a single shell.</p>
<p>“Weird. Is there a problem with the God Spirit Touch?” The man
reached out a finger and brushed it against the God Spirit Touch’s
head. His face twisted with confusion as he said, “There’s nothing
wrong with the creature. It is just the same as before. How could
this happen?”</p>
<p>“Feed him another drop of blood,” the man told Han Sen after he
examined the God Spirit Touch.Han Sen didn’t know what to make of
this turn of events. He did just as he was instructed and squeezed
out another droplet of blood to feed the God Spirit Touch.</p>
