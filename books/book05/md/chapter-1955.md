  Han Sen initially didn’t want Little Seven to participate in the battle body races, but when he heard what they could win if Little Seven achieved first place, he changed his mind. It was a battle body fluid synthesized by the Meka themselves.

Battle body fluid could level Little Seven up. It could turn Baron battle bodies into Viscounts. For the Meka, this was great.

Mach offered Han Sen a very good deal, and Little Seven showed interest in giving it a shot. So, Han Sen agreed to participate.

He signed a contract with Mach. If Little Seven achieved a good result, he could even gain shares in Mach’s company. The better Little Seven did, the more shares Han Sen would receive.

If he earned first place in the Baron team, they could gain a forty percent share of the business.

Mach helped Little Seven sign up. He got the permit to join very quickly, and Han Sen took Little Seven to take part in a few of the early matches.

The other young Meka Barons could not compete with Little Seven. He kept winning over and over, which made him ecstatic. He began to draw the attention of important members of the audience.

Inside a Meka King’s palace, Clear Sea King and a Meka King were watching the Baron battle body races.

“Amitabha! Making this trade will require a lot of effort on your part,” Clear Sea King said to the Meka King.

That King looked like a giant bear. And while it munched on food, it responded, “It’s fine. If you have enough Galaxy Sand, we can give you as many babies as you want.”

Clear Sea King watched the match without expression. “Galaxy Sand is not a problem, but I need some good Meka children. There are a few babies here I really like, so please help me acquire them.”

“Some of the young ones who have joined the matches are from big families. I can try to get some of the other ones, but the prices?” Battle King stopped talking, but his meaning was obvious.

“I will give you ten times as much Galaxy Sand as we discussed. What do you think?” Clear Sea King said calmly, pointing out the competitors that he wanted.

“The ones you have chosen are very talented Meka babies. If you are not famous, you can’t…” Battle King looked glum.

“I will give you twenty times the Galaxy Sand. This is a serious offer,” Clear Sea King said simply.

“Okay, good. Then it is a deal.” Battle King agreed.

“Hopefully we can conclude this trade quickly and take those babies back to the Buddha,” Clear Sea King said. He looked at the Meka babies in the match, paying particular focus to Little Seven, who was ravenously chowing down on some fruit.

Little Seven was doing very well in the Baron tier. He had managed to reach the top ten. Other Baron Meka’s didn’t stand a chance against him.

Little Seven kept winning and winning, and his renown soon started to spread. He quickly became a Meka superstar.

He ate a geno fruit every time he competed, which was something others soon came to notice, as well.

Shortly after, the sales in Mach’s shop started to rise. It delighted him.

But many people came to Mach’s store to simply ask about Little Seven, too. He was worried about this, and so he told Han Sen about it. But even without Mach mentioning it, Han Sen could feel things going that way.

There were eyes all over him and Little Seven. It seemed reasonable given the fame that Little Seven had gained, but Han Sen still felt that something was amiss. There were people watching him 24/7, and their methods of observation were too secretive. They were not low-class Nobles, either; they had to be Earls, at least.

If Han Sen did not have his powerful Dongxuan Sutra, he’d have never noticed that they were observing him.

“Who are these guys?” Han Sen wondered, but then an idea crossed his mind.

At night, Han Sen took to the streets. He disappeared in the mall.

After a while, a Meka walked around and around in the mall. He looked terrible.

“Weird. I thought he was here. How did he just disappear?” the Meka said to himself. He then reported what had happened through a communicator. He walked around the mall again, to confirm that Han Sen and Little Seven were nowhere to be found. Then, he left the mall.

Han Sen came out from a corner, wearing his Dongxuan Armor. Even his energy had changed.

He followed the Meka to a giant building, then watched the Meka enter.

“Isn’t that the building that Clear Sea King went into? Are they involved? Have they discovered my true identity?” Han Sen thought to himself.

But that would have been impossible. If Clear Sea King had discovered that Little Seven’s owner was Han Sen, he would have attacked already. There would have been no need for him to wait.

It seemed obvious to Han Sen that their target was Little Seven.

Han Sen couldn’t go in, but he could sneakily send in Little Invisible. If Little Invisible could snoop around inside, he would work like an invisible camera. The only downside was his inability to record voices.

Han Sen spoke to Little Invisible and placed him on the floor. The colors on its body changed to mimic the ground underfoot. Then, it vanished.

Little Invisible’s camouflage was strong. Not even King class people would notice he was around. Han Sen still worried, of course, so he waited outside the building. If something happened, Han Sen would use Red Mist King to go save him.

Luckily, these fears didn’t come to fruition. After a few hours of waiting, something landed on his shoulder. It was Little Invisible.

Han Sen brought Little Invisible back to Mach’s shop. He went to his room and sat down with Little Invisible.

“Little Invisible, what did you see?” Han Sen asked.

Little Invisible’s color started to change. It was like watching a show. It displayed the palace. After Han Sen watched was revealed, his face got all gloomy. Now he knew why they had their eyes on Little Seven.

Little Invisible had shown Han Sen many imprisoned Meka babies. Some of them had done quite well in the races.

“Meka have a complicated blood lineage. Sometimes, they sell out their own. But I cannot believe a King class elite would merrily sell off their own kind like that. Clear Sea King is here to buy them, but for what purpose?” Han Sen wondered.
