<p>“That outsider really made the geno tree chime?” In a manager’s
office of Black Gold Group, Hardman asked his subordinates in
shock.</p>
<p>Those subordinates of Black Gold Group had been the two behind
him in the test.</p>
<p>“I promise it’s the truth. I heard it,” a subordinate quickly
answered.</p>
<p>“Do you know who he is and where he lives?” Hardman asked.</p>
<p>Beings that could make the flowers ring had a fifty percent
chance of evolving. If Han Sen became a Noble, he’d become quite
the hot character. Black Gold Group needed someone like that. If
they were able to recruit him, it’d be very good for Hardman.</p>
<p>“I am not sure, but I do know that he was in the company of Lan
Se. And when they left, he even traveled in Lan Se’s car. For
obvious reasons, I could not follow,” the subordinate said.</p>
<p>“Someone Officer Lan knows? That should be easy.” Hardman let
his subordinate finish and then dialed a number. He was calling the
security department.</p>
<p>Not long after, Hardman had acquired Han Sen’s information.</p>
<p>“An outsider accidentally entered here? One from a nameless
race? He made the flowers ring? This is a great opportunity.” After
Hardman read the profile, he stood up and continued, “Prepare a car
for me. I am going to the graveyard.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was currently in the security room, learning the
language. With his level of intelligence, he was able to start
speaking the language in a mere few days. He might not have been
fluent, but Old Ku could at least understand all that he was trying
to say.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he would just have to make simple conversation,
but he wished to learn more information off the internet. This
required him to learn more of the language.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s communicator rang with Old Ku’s voice. “Han Sen,
someone called. He says he is the manager of Black Gold Group and
he is looking for you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the CCTV images and saw that there was a black
cat-eared man standing outside the graveyard. He had dressed up
rather nicely.</p>
<p>Han Sen was confused. He didn’t know anyone here, so why would
some manager come looking for him?</p>
<p>He knew he couldn’t escape this sort of rendezvous, and if
something was going to happen, he would prepare to face it rather
than shy away. So, he got up to go and meet with Hardman.</p>
<p>“You are Mister Han Sen? It is nice to make your acquaintance. I
am the manager for Black Gold Group. My name is Hardman. This is my
card.” Hardman seemed to be quite the humble sort, as he gave his
card out with both hands.</p>
<p>Han Sen accepted it. He could read the simple stuff of the Kate
language, and he was indeed the manager of Black Gold Group.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking for me?” Han Sen asked Hardman, looking
right at him.</p>
<p>Hardman quickly responded by saying, “I want to invite you to
join Black Gold Group. I want you to become a member of our hunting
team. Black Gold Group is a powerful entity on Planet Kate, and
we’ll give you a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what the man was saying, but he had not had
the time to investigate the factions of the planet yet. He wasn’t
familiar with who or what the Black Gold Group stood for.</p>
<p>But Han Sen knew that in this universe, many companies had their
own hunting groups. Many were tasked solely with the hunting of
xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Those groups didn’t always include Nobles, and many were
composed entirely of common warriors. They were often referred to
as pawns.</p>
<p>Hardman wanted to use a lot of money to buy Han Sen’s
co-operation and have him as a core member.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not have a geno armor or a geno weapon yet.
Hardman already wanted to sign a contract with him and provide him
money and resources to help his ascension. That way, when Han Sen
did generate a geno armor or geno weapon, they’d sign another
contract that would make him a proper member of the hunting
team.</p>
<p>It looked like the team was looking to pre-order Han Sen before
he hit the market. They wanted to buy into the prospect of his
future. They were planning ahead.</p>
<p>If Han Sen managed to generate a geno weapon, Hardman would pay
him even more money. If Han Sen could not generate a geno weapon,
the contract would be pointless to sign. He’d still be bound, and
he wouldn’t be paid as much.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not interested in opportunistic contracts like that,
but there was one condition that made Han Sen change his mind and
end up signing it</p>
<p>Hardman promised Han Sen he would not be observed in his work,
and he would earn his citizenship. For an outsider, having those
would make life much easier.</p>
<p>And when he became a member, at least he’d still get a lot of
money and resources. It sorted out all of Han Sen’s problems, and
it was especially great that he did not have to work.</p>
<p>If Han Sen generated a geno weapon and jointed a hunting group,
things wouldn’t be all that bad. It would actually be a good thing
to follow those with greater experience and see what battling the
xenogeneic was actually like.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only been a grave watcher for ten days, and two
years later, Hardman had completed all the paperwork and necessary
procedures. He gave Han Sen the best possible living quarters in
the base. He also gave Han Sen a geno fluid that would help him
generate a geno weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen lived in the Black Gold Hunting Base for the next four
months, and every day, he’d spend some time soaking himself in geno
fluid. The Story of Genes was showing a promise of leveling up.</p>
<p>The Kate laws and contracts required Han Sen to undergo
observation when leveling up. People like Han Sen, who made the
flowers ring, had every chance of becoming xenogeneic. So, they had
to be watched until the process was over.</p>
<p>Planet Kate sent people over to conduct the study on Han Sen.
Hei Xun and Lan Se were amongst them.</p>
