      “If you’ve always had this power, why did you pretend to be so weak?” Han
      Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon shook her head. “I never really pretended, but I had a way to
      increase the strength of my Elysian Umbrella. It can temporarily possess
      the strength of a super geno core. That time is quite limited, so I saved
      it until I got to the main battleground. I would have preferred to die out
      there rather than use it before reaching this point. I am appreciative to
      you and Zhuo Donglai for bringing me here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t say anything in return. He hadn’t minded helping her at the
      time, but the fact she had been lying to him all along made him angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon wanted to say something more, but Han Sen’s missing geno core
      lit up. A door of light appeared in front of him, indicating it was his
      turn to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are a human that cannot respawn. There are so many elites here; if I
      were you, I wouldn’t join a pointless fight such as this.” Elysian Moon
      looked at Han Sen and offered advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t like pointless fights. You’re right about that. That’s why I need
      to get the God geno core; to nullify the pointlessness of my current
      participation,” Han Sen said coldly. He walked into the open doorway and
      then appeared out in the arena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon said to herself, “I’m sorry, but I have to get the God geno
      core no matter the cost.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Elysian Moon turned to look at the arena. His opponent was Red
      Dragon. She frowned. “Red Dragon is better than an emperor. It looks like
      Han Sen had bad luck. If he ever hopes to win this battle, it’ll cost him
      a lot. That’s good, though. I’d hate to end up being forced to suck him
      into my umbrella.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw Red Dragon, and Red Dragon saw him. They froze, and then Red
      Dragon bore a wry smile. “It’s bad luck for me to meet you again in my
      first round.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen smiled and did not say anything. Red Dragon shook his head and
      went on to say, “I was probably going to lose, anyway. I suppose it isn’t
      all that shameful to lose against Sky Sword, of all opponents.”
    </p>
    <p>After that, Red Dragon decided to concede and exit the battleground.</p>
    <p>
      Red Dragon was like an emperor. He was a very famous individual amongst
      the spirits. Everyone was shocked to see him not even bother to fight, and
      simply concede right away. As shock swept the audience, everyone wondered
      who his opponent had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon was shocked, too. It surprised her a great deal that Red
      Dragon had conceded like that. She had no idea what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen walked back out of the light door and sat back down in his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn’t going to say anything to her, so Elysian Moon asked, “Why did
      Red Dragon concede?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe I’m just lucky? Or perhaps he thought I was too handsome, and he
      didn’t want to scar my beauty?” Han Sen smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon didn’t believe that, of course. Although Red Dragon was an
      emperor, he wasn’t the strongest. As such, she didn’t dwell on it too
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many elites entering the arena to fight after that. Regardless
      of whether they were creatures or spirits, each one of them was very
      powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Six Paths entered the arena, Elysian Moon’s face changed. “Six Paths
      Emperor is here?!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You said you were going to win. Does his presence here matter?” Han Sen
      mocked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Six Paths is different. He doesn’t have a super geno core, but he has the
      body of an emperor. Now not even I am able to guarantee a win.” Elysian
      Moon spoke with grave sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen licked his lips but did not respond. Elysian Moon was evil, but
      she wasn’t a fighter. Even if she had a super geno core, he didn’t think
      she had the fighting talent to back it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that didn’t just apply to her fighting Six Paths. Han Sen wagered she
      wouldn’t win, even if the two of them had to battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn’t matter how strong a super geno core was; the wielder himself had
      to be powerful. Elysian Moon was not super class in body, and she wasn’t
      much of a fighter. She couldn’t depend on the strength of the super
      Elysian Umbrella entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many creatures were able to enter the main battleground, and after a
      few more hours passed, the first round was over. The second round would
      begin soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures that were defeated could not fight again, as they were
      disqualified. The winner of each previous fight were the ones who could go
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon was up for the next fight again. Her umbrella was incredibly
      strong, and she was able to suck the super creature she went up against
      into her weapon as she did before. The image of that same super creature
      then blazed across the top of the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>“Who is that female spirit? She is so strong!”</p>
    <p>
      “If I am not wrong, she has the Elysian powers. The Elysium used to be the
      best in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Elysium were once that strong? Why have I not heard of them for many
      years?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Back then, there was a horrible battle. Many old families went into
      hiding, and Elysium was one of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think it is either Six Paths or this Elysium spirit that will get the
      God geno core.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m just here to watch, more than anything. I know I don’t stand a
      chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s scary. That super creature heir, with a gemstone geno core, was
      defeated by the umbrella so easily. Can Six Paths really beat her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I end up facing her, I’ll just concede. Who knows if I can respawn at
      my spirit stone if I end up getting sucked into that umbrella?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was discussing Elysian Moon’s performance, having all been
      shocked by her display of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, Han Sen was up again. When he saw his next opponent, he
      was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is happening today? Another one I already beat?” Han Sen licked his
      lips. It was Xu Mi, who was frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the audience saw Han Sen and Xu Mi, the excitement across the stadium
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was the human who had made Red Dragon concede. Xu Mi was the son
      of two emperors. He was very talented and extremely famous amongst the
      spirits. Now that they were to square-off, everyone was ecstatic for the
      prospect of an exciting battle.
    </p>
    <p>“I wonder which one of them is stronger?”</p>
    <p>
      “Xu Mi for sure. He’s the heir of two emperors. I’ve heard his powers are
      abhorrently strong. His gemstone geno core allows him to do battle with
      super creatures.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why are so many elites appearing here at once? It is difficult to
      determine who will end up obtaining the God geno core.”
