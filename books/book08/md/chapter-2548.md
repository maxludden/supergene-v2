  The armored man vanished from Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon’s vision. Then, he reappeared in front of Han Sen. His striking fist approached Han Sen’s belly. Just as the armored man’s fist was about to hit Han Sen, Han Sen’s body suddenly disappeared. He reappeared elsewhere. His fast escape was a product of the teleportation abilities he had been practicing.

Without a moment’s hesitation, the armored man threw another punch. And with it, his body vanished just like last time. He appeared in front of Han Sen.

Han Sen’s body blinked away again to avoid the incoming fist of the armored man.

The two of them kept flashing across the expanse of space, moving too fast for ordinary eyesight to follow. It was like they could be in the sky at one point and on the ground in the next.

Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon moved to help Han Sen, but he told them, “Stay back… you guys cannot evade his attacks. Use your power to protect yourselves, and don’t leave any of your weaknesses exposed.”

Upon hearing him, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon stopped in their tracks. They watched Han Sen and the man in black armor do battle. Elysian Moon opened the paper umbrella in her hands. A swordlight flashed from the surface of the umbrella, then expanded to envelop the two of them. Just as Han Sen wanted, it left no weaknesses exposed.

“That man in armor isn’t using teleportation abilities,” Gu Qingcheng said with certainty, as she observed the battlefield ahead of her.

Elysian Moon nodded seriously. “It isn’t teleportation. It’s more like… It’s more like…”

“Godslayer Luo.” Gu Qingcheng finished what Elysian Moon was hesitant to say.

That old man was a lone warrior who had once obtained a foothold in the sanctuaries for humanity.

When his power reached the max, the presence he gave off was just like the one they felt from the armored man. He ignored the rules of space to kill his enemies.

“Why does the armored man have Falsified Sky powers? No, wait… that is Sky Demon power. The armored man is a Demon?” Gu Qingcheng wondered aloud.

Han Sen knew the armored man was using Sky Demon powers. He clearly wasn’t using a space-based teleportation talent. Not many powers could repel Sky Demon powers, but thankfully, Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra was one of the few that could.

The armored man’s absolute strikes weren’t difficult for Han Sen to break, but the armored man’s power was undeniably greater than Han Sen’s. And that meant Han Sen couldn’t defeat him.

Han Sen felt a mixture of different emotions when he looked at the armored man. He knew this attacker was different from the Demons they had encountered earlier, but he wasn’t entirely sure what the difference was.

Ji Yang Sheng and a few of the Demon elites watched the fight through a mirror. They appeared to be in shock. Even Ji Yang Sheng was floored by what he was witnessing.

“He is a very powerful guy. He has dodged every attack that the Demon Doll has thrown.” Ji Yang Sheng chewed his lip. That was what he did when he was in thought.

“No wonder Han Sen escaped harm when he was pursued by the Extreme King. He is very scary. He is dodging the attacks of the Sky Demon powers somehow. I wonder what power he has been making use of,” a few Demon elites said, their voices a mixture of admiration and trepidation.

They knew that the Demon Doll’s Sky Demon power ensured that every hit was a successful one unless the enemy possessed the same causal powers. If the enemy didn’t, not even teleportation would let them escape the Demon Doll’s strikes.

Sky Demon abilities were a causal power. Once the Demon Doll locked onto Han Sen, even if Han Sen teleported away, he should still be hit.

Han Sen’s teleportation let him dodge the Demon Doll’s attacks, though. He was obviously using an advanced version of teleportation. And as for what other powers Han Sen was employing, Ji Yang Sheng couldn’t guess. He couldn’t understand what he was witnessing.

“He might be dodging the Demon Doll’s strikes for now, but his efforts are futile. He is slower and weaker than the Demon Doll. We must take him with us today. Our race requires more than just a blessing. Thousands of our people over the next few decades… No, millions of our people over the next few centuries will need what he can provide us,” Ji Yang Sheng declared. In an effort to speed things up, he put more of his power into the purple horn. The purple horn’s mysterious symbols glowed with a purple light.

The powers of blessing Han Sen had displayed made other races take him very seriously. They needed his abilities.

If they could capture Han Sen, they wouldn’t hand him over to the Extreme King. They would lock him up for themselves and force him to bless their children and grandchildren.

The mysterious symbols on the purple horn lit up further. And then, the armored man who had been struggling to capture Han Sen suddenly stopped. His body suddenly enlarged.

The muscles of the mystery man grew, and the black armor began to swell. It had to morph in order to fit the bulging muscles. It highlighted their ridiculous size all too well.

A dark purple presence intensified within that armor. It made the armored man look like a demon from hell. His eyes were purple like lightning.

“This… this is Shura Change.” Han Sen looked at the armored man in shock. He whispered the words hoarsely.

He finally knew why the armored man’s presence felt different from the other Demons. They looked so similar, but Han Sen could feel that this guy was more like a shura from the Alliance’s universe. His power, however, was obviously some variant of Sky Demon power. That was what made him look just like one of the Demon. It was very difficult to tell the difference, and so Han Sen hadn’t caught on until now.

Once he used Shura Change, the shura’s presence became heavier. Now, Han Sen was finally getting a better sense of what was happening.

“Why is there a shura here? I never brought a shura to the geno universe. Unless he is one of the shuras that come out of the coffin in the Shura’s Graveyard… He… Could he be one of the shura kings?” Han Sen looked at the Demon-like armored man with a conflicted expression. And as he did, Han Sen kept thinking.

The armored man didn’t stop to think through things like Han Sen had. After he finished changing, his purple lightning-like eyes peered at Han Sen. Then, the muscular creature threw a punch toward Han Sen.

Han Sen dodged the attack of the armored man, but when he teleported away, the armored man appeared in front of him. Purple flames burst to life around the man’s fist as it slammed into Han Sen’s stomach.

Pang!

When that fist connected, Han Sen’s body shot away like a raging fireball. He flew into a nearby asteroid. He went through it and many more, cleaving a line through space.

Before Han Sen could stop, the armored man appeared in front of him and punched him again. Once more, he was sent flying.

Blergh!

Han Sen spat out some blood. He kept falling, and he couldn’t even teleport away.
