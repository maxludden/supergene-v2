<h3>Chapter 1748</h3>

<p>As the blue crystal tentacle reached for the male Feather, a
golden light shone down. It was a gold arrow, perforating the
crystal tentacle.</p>
<p>This golden arrow was different from the others. A strange power
carried it down with the force of a drillhead. It drilled right
into the tentacle, until half of its shaft was driven in.</p>
<p>When the tentacle was frozen after the attack, the male Feather
reached for the creature’s head. He drew his golden lance and
shoved it right in.</p>
<p>The Feather then pulled back on his lance, and he picked up the
entire beast with it. The beast eventually fell back down into 什le
Black River, creating a crater.</p>
<p>The monster was still alive, struggling for life, but it was
heavily damaged. The two Feathers were able to finish it off
quickly.</p>
<p>Hardman and Guris were done for, though. The tentacles had
already tightened around the two Kate men, breaking their armor and
bones. Their bodies were disfigured and torn.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned, even though he was used to witnessing
death.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger was saved, fortunately. He came out of the river,
looking back at their dead bodies. His expression seemed
saddened.</p>
<p>The female Feather flew over to the dead xenogeneic, pulled out
a knife, and cut off the blue crystal tentacle.</p>
<p>The male Feather came right before Han Sen, instead. He asked
coldly, “I told you to get in the water. Did you not hear me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at him but didn’t speak. Mister Tiger swiftly
came over, though, saying, “Sir, he wasn’t disobeying your order.
It is all because the baby is here. He is afraid of bringing her
harm.”</p>
<p>“Right,” the male Feather said darkly. He pulled out his lance
and pointed it at Bao’er, who was perched on Han Sen’s shoulder,
and growled, “Let me teach you how to be the lesser race that you
are. You will never hesitate again.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was so angry. He turned around and used his Rhino Horn
Dagger to knock the lance away.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The dagger and the lance sparked in their collision, and the two
wielders stumbled back.</p>
<p>The male Feather’s face changed. Mister Tiger and the female
Feather looked at the pair in shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen had geno armor. He was regarded as no more than a
commoner. He wasn’t even a Noble, so it was strange that he had
enough strength to knock back a Feather.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a grudge against you, so why are you doing this?”
Han Sen calmly asked, as he clutched the Rhino Horn Dagger.</p>
<p>The male Feather hummed in growing anger. “Just because you have
some modicum of power, it doesn’t mean you can disobey a Feather.
And if I don’t kill you right now, how can I assert rule and
superiority?”</p>
<p>After that, the male Feather swung his golden lance and tried to
strike Han Sen down. He was using all his power in a bid to kill
the upstart pest.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained calm. After the last hit, he could guess what
was coming.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have a geno weapon, but after his blood leveled
up to become xenogeneic, he had the right amount of strength to
challenge the Feather. His body’s power was no worse than the
Feather’s.</p>
<p>Seeing the lance descending toward his chest, Han Sen merely
stepped to the side to dodge the strike. Then he stepped right near
the male Feather, raised his dagger, and pressed it against the
Feather’s neck.</p>
<p>The male Feather was in shock. He could not believe he had given
Han Sen the opportunity to get so close. He’d be unable to block
the dagger now. Han Sen’s move was way too good. It was beyond his
wildest expectations.</p>
<p>The Feather felt as if he had suddenly gone up against someone
who wasn’t an ordinary human. He seemed superior to all else in his
race.</p>
<p>A gold arrow suddenly flew towards Han Sen, aimed at his temple.
The female Feather wanted to get him away and save her
companion.</p>
<p>The dagger in Han Sen’s hand did not move, though. All he did
was swing his head back and forth to catch the arrow with his
teeth. Then, he used the dagger to slit the Feather’s throat.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s crystal blood melted within his vessels, filling him
like lava. The vessels twisted and contorted like snakes. The
additional power was enough to drive the dagger deeper through the
neck, completely decapitating the Feather. The sheer force of the
blow sent the head up into the sky.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger and the female Feather looked on in absolute shock.
No one could believe that a commoner, with only geno armor, could
manage to kill a Feather Baron. Especially since two Feathers had
been present He was too f*cking fast.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger opened his mouth. He thought he was dreaming.</p>
<p>“How dare you kill a Feather!” the female Feather screamed, then
fired another arrow at Han Sen. All those golden arrows were
nothing more than raindrops to him, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still biting the first arrow, and electricity surged
through his eyes. He dodged each and every arrow, nearing her with
his dagger raised. He looked at her with murder.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already slain one, so it was not as if he could
leave a witness. If the other Feathers knew what had happened,</p>
<p>he wouldn’t be able to stay where he was or in any nearby
system, for that matter.</p>
<p>The female Feather was confident in her arrows, but despite the
storm of attacks she released, they couldn’t strike Han Sen
once.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was as fast as a snake. The female Feather was
unable to predict where he would move next, and she missed each and
every shot.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen only ten meters away from her, the female Feather
flapped her wings with the desire to escape from him. Han Sen
lifted his dagger and flew up with her, though. She was the only
thing in his eyes, right now.</p>
<p>“Damn!” The female Feather flapped her wings and flew, all the
while firing her arrows.</p>
<p>Baron-class power was not enough to fly when there was gravity,
so Baron Feathers needed their wings to fly through the air.</p>
<p>When the Feather saw Han Sen trying to fly after her, she
thought he must have had a death wish.</p>
<p>And when the rain of arrows came down towards Han Sen, he
suddenly began acting like a strange bird. He flew strangely,
pulling himself up through the air. He dodged each and every arrow
until he was right before the female Feather.</p>
<p>The female feather was enraged. She pulled out her longsword in
an attempt to block his dagger, and when the weapons collided, the
female Feather felt a huge force come against her. It blasted the
longsword out of her hands. The dagger didn’t stop, though, and it
went right for her neck.</p>
<p>The arm that was holding the dagger turned red. The vessels
inside looked like crystals as the blood inside boiled, pumping
power into the dagger.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The dagger slashed across the female Feather’s throat. A gold
light came out from the neck to block the raging hit</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. A feather necklace suddenly appeared on the
Feather’s neck. It was hanging low against her chest, shining with
a golden light It was that gold feather pendant that had blocked
Han Sen’s strike.</p>
