      “Come and hit me, you dumb*ss!” Wang Yuhang ran, shaking his *ss
      vigorously as he went. Many creatures were behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked risky, but Wang Yuhang could run like mad. He may have been
      dealt a number of injuries, but none of the wounds put him in critical
      status.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen’s beautiful legs were swinging to chop foes like axes. They managed
      to cut a sacred-blood creature in half with a combined chop, spraying
      blood across her limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more creatures, like maddened tigers, came leaping towards Queen, who
      was now starting to show signs of exhaustion. But she disappeared, and the
      two creatures ended up jumping into each other. When Queen showed up
      again, she was beside them. With hands like blades, she sliced both of
      their heads off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen was like a killing machine. The Ghost Slash technique Han Sen had
      invented was even scarier when she used it, due to her natural dexterity
      with the time and space elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng was colored gold, and he looked almost like a Buddha. Jing Jiwu’s
      powers were slightly weird, and they were used in tandem with Lin Feng’s.
      If he threw a punch, an enemy would get trapped and become unable to move,
      letting Lin Feng finish it off. Through their co-operation, they were an
      unstoppable force that produced even more blood for the field.
    </p>
    <p>A super creature came with a roar, interrupting their killing spree.</p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon’s Elysian Umbrella opened, and every time that occurred, a
      new creature was sucked onto its surface. It was very strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Star was too tame, though. It didn’t even fight. All it did was use
      Starsea Travel to run around and avoid all damage, due to it not being
      able to get hit
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Silver stood atop Little Star, as Little Star navigated the field.
      The furry creature cast many bolts of silver lightning to electrify the
      enemies below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few super creatures tried going after Little Star, but they couldn’t get
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was also on top of Little Star. She kept looking around, as if in
      search of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever Little Fairy flew, a blizzard accompanied her. Many flying
      creatures were frozen in the air, and they fell to the ground and
      shattered like hailstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng’s face was cold. Her sword skills were powerful, but she was
      unable to hit Elder Yin. He was like bubblegum. Whenever you attacked, he
      fell back. Whenever he attacked, you fell back. His skills were very
      powerful, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Menger kept on firing arrows, as well. They kept on getting attracted
      to the Horn Beast Alpha’s horn. Many explosions were created between the
      two, but a victor did not yet seem decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was running in between a dozen elites that hounded him. Even
      though he wasn’t afraid of taking on large numbers alone, he still felt a
      lot of pressure now.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of his enemies were powerful, and Ancient Devil kept breathing down
      his neck, making him feel much worse. He was still making use of Bulwark
      Umbrella and Overbearing Shield to block the attacks that came his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulwark Umbrella’s surface had a small crack running across it, but
      Overbearing Shield was wreathed with far more. It looked as if it’d break
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was using his Fallen Slaughter body and butterfly wings to dodge
      an attack of an elder. He shouted to Sacred’s leader, “Hey, look at who is
      in the Ancient Sky Mirror!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred’s leader turned around to look at the mirror, and in that big
      mirror, Goddess was visible. She looked terrible.
    </p>
    <p>“Let her go!” Sacred’s leader roared.</p>
    <p>
      “Sacred, if you don’t leave now, I will kill her,” Han Sen said coldly as
      he dodged attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you touch one hair on her head, I’ll make you… PANG!” Before Sacred’s
      leader finished, the noise of an explosion sounded. Goddess exploded,
      becoming nothing more than a bloody mist across the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m going to kill you!” Sacred’s leader’s eyes turned red, and he became
      incredibly angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was so cold, and his face didn’t change. As he continued his
      fight, he coldly said, “Elder Mo He, if you keep moving, two of your
      people will suffer the same fate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will kill you today!” Elder Mo He gritted his teeth. He didn’t fall
      back, and he simply attacked even harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s heart jumped, and then, the two people that belonged to Mo He
      exploded. They became a source of energy for the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen kept on killing the others, because he didn’t think the alphas
      would leave. Those were their kids he was now killing, but they had many
      children. They weren’t going to fall back on account of two lost ones,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t killing their children just to make them mad, though. He
      was hoping to take advantage of their emotions, but that aside, Ancient
      Sky Mirror required a lot of energy to keep reviving his teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many elders were enraged by the actions of Han Sen. They were able to
      maintain their powers, but their usage was now emotional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen grabbed hold of the raw emotions he could and weaved his way
      through the elites. He was like a fish that was swimming upstream. It was
      a difficult situation to be in, but it was at least a little better.
    </p>
    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil threw his palm against Overbearing Shield. It reversed the
      power back onto Ancient Devil, but it didn’t succeed in hurting him. And
      the shield itself wasn’t able to fully sustain the shock. The shield ended
      up breaking while it was still attached to Han Sen’s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made Han Sen feel terrible. Ancient Devil was near Han Sen now, and
      he was a far more dangerous threat than the others were. But try as he
      might, Han Sen could not figure out a way in which he could rid himself of
      Ancient Devil. Ancient Devil was a powerful nemesis, but the white and
      unassuming donkey he rode was also a tricky fiend. Han Sen couldn’t figure
      out a way to deal with the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inferno Skeleton Emperor could now feel Ancient Devil’s presence from
      inside Destiny’s Tower, and this made him a little nutty again. He kept on
      slamming the locks, wanting to fight Ancient Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen wasn’t willing to let him go free. And more than anything, Han
      Sen didn’t want to expose the fact that he himself was Dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was invincible in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, but the Alliance had
      organizations Han Sen would not be able to deal with. If people figured
      out Han Sen was Dollar, there was sure to be big trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as all this occurred, in a base somewhere in the Alliance, a black
      tiger creature came to the man that looked like God. “Sir, they have
      started their operation. They are attacking Han Sen and Shadow Shelter,”
      the black tiger said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good. Let us start, then.” The officer spoke coldly, but he looked
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I will travel to Han Manor,” the black tiger said quietly. With his
      black geno armor to veil himself, he went to see the Han family.
