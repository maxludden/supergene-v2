    <p>
      &#8220;Look silver fox! I&#8217;m so poor. It&#8217;s already hard enough
      for me to look after myself. I haven&#8217;t got enough food, I
      can&#8217;t keep warm, and now I need to take care of you, despite the
      fact that you eat so much? It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like the fact
      that you eat, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but you want everyone else to get
      their fill, too, don&#8217;t you? How about you help us catch a few fish.
      If you do that, we can help you cook it. It&#8217;d be nice if you chipped
      in, so how about it? Does that sound good?&#8221; Han Sen smiled in his
      attempt to discuss matters with the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero gave Han Sen a disdainful look. The way she looked at him was as if
      she had just witnessed him trying to abduct a young girl.
    </p>

    <p>The silver fox tilted its head, looking at Han Sen in a confused way.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fish&#8230; over there&#8230; you&#8230; grab it&#8230; we&#8230;
      cook it!&#8221; Han Sen pointed at the fish swimming past the Crystal
      Palace&#8217;s windows, making wild gestures with his hands and legs to
      try to get the silver fox to understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when the silver fox looked towards the windows, it just reverted its
      gaze back to Han Sen. Then it walked underneath Han Sen and used its tail
      to hook his leg, rubbing its head as it frequently did.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Geez, you are the child of a super creature. Have some dignity! It
      is obscene for something so fierce to act so cute. This world is cruel,
      and you must master your abilities of combat if you wish to survive. Do
      you understand?&#8221; Han Sen was now trying to lecture the silver fox.
      He pointed at the windows once more and said, &#8220;Go! Catch me a fish
      or you&#8217;re not having any food tonight.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox&#8217;s face continued to look innocent. It quietly whined
      to itself as it carried on rubbing its face against Han Sen&#8217;s legs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not long after, Han Sen gave up. With a hopeless expression, he picked up
      the silver fox and said, &#8220;Another useless thing I have to take care
      of.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, Han Sen had an idea. Although he couldn&#8217;t command the
      silver fox to hunt, and his previous attempt to kill sacred-blood
      creatures under the sea had failed, a new idea struck him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s okay not to hunt! I just need to bring you to the spirit
      shelter. If I did that, wouldn&#8217;t all the creatures start running
      off? That means I could reach the Spirit Hall with ease. The only thing I
      am not sure of is whether the spirits will run off, as well. But if they
      did, I could pick up the spirit stones for free. Ha! I am such a
      genius.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s face smiled like a radiant flower, as he
      thought of how he might easily obtain numerous spirit stones with little
      to no trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come, my cute little silver fox. I have cooked you a fish fillet.
      Would you like to try some?&#8221; Han Sen was still super happy. After
      his bright idea, he leapt into the sea and caught a fair number of fish to
      cook for the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the silver fox eat the fish fillet slowly, the way Han Sen smiled
      hid his eyes beneath numerous layers of creases. He said, &#8220;Good boy!
      Good boy! Eat more and more. When you are full, let&#8217;s get to
      work.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hunted a few more mutant creatures on the seabed and the haul was
      good enough to last a month. Then he drove the Crystal Palace back to the
      ice fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      After they were back on land, Han Sen grabbed the silver fox and ran
      towards the royal shelter. They arrived in no time at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      The royal shelter was now standing before them, and numerous creatures
      were walking in and around its exterior. Han Sen took another look at the
      silver fox in his hands and quietly whispered, &#8220;This is the moment
      of truth.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuing to hold the silver fox in his arms, he resumed his run towards
      the royal shelter. Just as he had hoped, all the creatures ran away at his
      approach. Not a single creature attempted to bar his passage, quickly
      fleeing before he even got close.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haha! I am going to be rich.&#8221; Han Sen, upon entering the
      royal shelter, smirked at the absence of a single creature there. He
      wondered where they all might have gone, but then hastily ventured towards
      the Spirit Hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      He entered the Spirit Hall without any trouble. But much to his dismay, he
      saw that the Twin Spirit continued to stand firm where it should have
      been. It didn&#8217;t run off as he had expected it to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the silver-haired lady and blonde-haired lady pick up their swords,
      Han Sen summoned his beast soul armor and glyph. He then summoned his
      Purple-Copper Ancient Sword and Silver-Eye Ice Snake King Sword.
    </p>

    <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The Twin Spirit&#8217;s swords came upon Han Sen like a hard rain. The
      silver sword and golden sword crossed each other, as if they were trying
      to trap him in a net of blades.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what surprised Han Sen the most was the fact that their sword skills
      were accelerating more and more. They were getting faster and faster, with
      each hit being heavier and heavier. He felt as if he couldn&#8217;t hold
      out much longer.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The silver-haired lady dealt Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder a blow which drew
      blood. Fortunately, it was not in a critical spot and so the damage
      wasn&#8217;t severe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew that he had not perfected his Dual-blade skill yet, and that
      it still possessed a few flaws. But right now, there was nothing else he
      could do. He battled the Twin Spirit for half an hour, and after receiving
      a few more hits, managed to summon his wings and fly away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Twin Spirit was unable to fly, and the other creatures of the shelter
      would not dare approach Han Sen, for he still had the silver fox in his
      company. So they just watched Han Sen fly away.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back!&#8221; Han Sen shouted at the Twin Spirit as he
      escaped to the skies.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are such a heartless fox. I give you nice food every day,
      treating you as I would treat my very own son. You saw me get injured,
      didn&#8217;t you? So, how come you didn&#8217;t help me out? You
      white-eyed fox!&#8221; Han Sen was gasping as he spoke to the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      He thought that if he was injured by the Twin Spirit, the silver fox would
      be enraged enough to leap into the fray and protect its master. But all it
      did was stay perched on Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder, not moving an inch.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was behaving as if it didn&#8217;t see or hear anything. It
      did, however, lick his wounds after the escape, like it did once before.
      Almost immediately after the silver fox&#8217;s application of its saliva,
      the wounds cleared up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was frustrated, but he wasn&#8217;t mad at the silver fox. Seeing
      it care for his injuries, he smiled at the silver fox and rubbed its head.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen wasn&#8217;t walking away empty-handed. No matter how often he
      practiced his Dual skill, he had been unable to perfect it. It was
      designed to deal with the Twin Spirit especially, and if he hadn&#8217;t
      been able to at least test it out with them, there was no real telling
      whether or not it could be perfected as the ideal skill to go against
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had also discovered that he could run into royal shelters with no
      trouble at all. He could walk into this particular one and battle the Twin
      Spirit whenever he desired. If he came back here a few times, every now
      and then, he could finally master his Dual skill and beat the Twin Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fine. If I can&#8217;t get it right the first time, I&#8217;ll be
      sure to get it right by the tenth. And if it&#8217;s still not mastered by
      then, I&#8217;ll go there a hundred times.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart
      was hyped, and after taking a break to restore his health and energy, he
      ran back to the royal shelter with the silver fox in hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every time Han Sen battled the Twin Spirit, he lost. But during each
      fight, Han Sen&#8217;s Dual-blade skill would improve in some way or
      another.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this, Han Sen continued to harass the Twin Spirit in such a way, but
      still, the spirit did not dare leave the Spirit Hall. They were afraid Han
      Sen would run in and take the spirit stone if they weren&#8217;t around to
      protect it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was getting better and better, and he went to the royal shelter at
      least once every two days. Whenever he was losing, he&#8217;d escape to
      heal, mull over why he lost, and make amends to any area of his expertise
      or skill that he could to improve upon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen believed that if things continued in such a way, his Dual-blade
      skill would rival the Twin Spirit in under a month.
