<p>Han Sen knew with a single glance that he was looking at a deified creature. It was nothing like the black, mountainous sea conch.</p>

<p>Han Sen grabbed the blood kirin and turned to run, but it was too late. A rainbow-like aura covered the sea around him.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt like his body was stuck to the ground, and he was unable to move. Many rainbow-colored substance chains were rising through the water to bind him.</p>

<p>“D*mn it! Why is there a deified creature here? This is bad.” Han Sen activated his super god spirit body without hesitation.</p>

<p>His body immediately became transparent. He shone so brightly that the colorful substance chains heading toward Han Sen suddenly lost their target.</p>

<p>Rather than attempting to fight back, Han Sen’s first reaction was to lift the blood kirin and run away as fast as he could. Even the weakest deified would be more than a match for Han Sen.</p>

<p>The rainbow crystal sea conch wasn’t as powerful as Ancient Water God, but it still wasn’t something Han Sen could fight against.</p>

<p>If Han Sen became King class, perhaps there was a chance he could fight off a deified. But right now, Han Sen was just a Duke. He needed some outside help just to fight a half-deified being; fighting a deified would be suicide.</p>

<p>A half-deified was like an incredibly powerful King, but deifieds were on a different level entirely.</p>

<p>The rainbow crystal sea conch saw Han Sen traveling freely through its substance chains, and it rocked back in apparent shock. Its crystal body flashed, and the substance chains turned into rainbow-colored glass. The glass surged up around Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen poured all of his power into his super god spirit body, running his technique as hard as he could. The weird power was injected into the blood kirin, and the blood kirin’s body became similarly transparent. Under the force of Han Sen’s will, the blood kirin’s body also adopted the qualities of super god spirit mode.</p>

<p>Han Sen lifted the blood kirin higher and hit the rainbow glass. They shot through it like ghosts, the glass wisping around them as if it wasn’t even there. The rainbow glass was unable to stop Han Sen and his super god spirit body.</p>

<p>But the super god spirit body had a time limit. Han Sen was carrying the blood kirin as he fled, and that cost him even more energy. After they escaped the rainbow glass, Han Sen ran back in the direction he had come.</p>

<p>The rainbow crystal sea conch managed to catch up. Countless substance chains rose from the ground and continued their attempts to capture Han Sen. He brushed right through them at first, but after a while, he was unable to sustain the power requirements of the super god spirit body. Every time he passed through the rainbow glass, it cost him a lot of energy.</p>

<p>When Han Sen hit the next pane of rainbow glass, he felt as if he had thrust himself into sticky liquid. It was difficult to wiggle his way through.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew that this was the sign that he was losing his super god spirit body. If this continued, his super god spirit body would entirely fail. He would be unable to break the substance chain glass with his power.</p>

<p>“What do I do? Do I have to jump into the sanctuary? If I go back to the sanctuary, the blood kirin will die…” Han Sen thought rapidly, but he couldn’t come up with a solution to his predicament.</p>

<p>The deified xenogeneic’s speed would make escape virtually impossible. Han Sen used all of his strength, but it was useless before that absolute power and speed.</p>

<p>Super god spirit body’s ability to make him invincible was the sole reason he hadn’t been trapped.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s heart was burning. He knew he could escape to the sanctuaries, but his greatest worry lay in the blood kirin. Han Sen carried the blood kirin’s bleeding body, and luckily, his super god spirit mode had lent some of its strength to the blood kirin. Han Sen’s power killed the small, black sea conches and made the blood kirin feel better.</p>

<p>But now, the two large sea conches were still a serious problem. One was a King with a powerful King area, and the other was a genuine deified xenogeneic. Even if he used his super god spirit body to attack them, he wouldn’t be able to save the blood kirin.</p>

<p>In Underwater Town, Bao’er was eating lunch with Lan Haixin. Halfway through her dessert, Bao’er’s face paled. She suddenly leaped off her chair.</p>

<p>“Bao’er, what is it?” Lan Haixin looked at Bao’er with confusion.</p>

<p>“Stomach ache. I have to go to the bathroom,” Bao’er said, then left the room with the little red bird in tow.</p>

<p>“This kid…” Lan Haixin shook her head and smiled. She looked so happy. She had really come to love Bao’er, and she even kept Bao’er in her room with her at night. They were like real sisters.</p>

<p>Bao’er ran to the garden and bit her finger. She let a droplet of blood fall on the little red bird’s forehead, and she said, “Little red bird, my stupid father is in trouble. My blood will guide you to him. Go and save him.”</p>

<p>After that, Bao’er threw the little red bird upward. The little red bird flapped its wings and became a red light. Then, it disappeared from the town.</p>

<p>Han Sen was still holding on, but his super god spirit body was flickering. It was almost gone, and it could disappear completely at any second.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s body struck the rainbow glass again, and now, it was as if he was striking leather. Han Sen gritted his teeth and pushed forward, but he was squashed out.</p>

<p>The super god spirit body couldn’t hold on any longer. Han Sen fell out of that mode and returned to being a human composed of ordinary flesh again.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried to use the super god spirit body’s remaining power to attack the sea conch, but it wasn’t that useful.</p>

<p>The super god spirit body buffed Han Sen quite a bit. It could ignore the defenses of creatures and attack things directly. Even so, attacking a beast that was two levels above him was pointless.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Another pane of rainbow glass fell. It was going to cover Han Sen and the blood kirin, and so Han Sen tried punching it. His fist was lit by Kingese, but he was unable to fracture the rainbow glass.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept punching the glass, and the sounds of the blows echoed over the seafloor. Han Sen’s bones were about to break and his fists were bleeding, but he couldn’t break the rainbow glass.</p>

<p>The power of Super Spank struck the substance chains of the rainbow glass, but even that was bounced back. Super Spank could find a single link of the chain that was weak enough to break.</p>

<p>The blood kirin fell on the ground, looking to be in a really dire condition. It was still able to release horrid screams as it tried to struggle back to its feet and fight against the rainbow glass alongside Han Sen. But after a few tries, it collapsed again with blood spewing from its mouth.</p>

<p>The black stone sea conch moved alongside the rainbow crystal sea conch. They were moving slowly. Two sea conches climbed atop the rainbow glass, looking at Han Sen and the blood kirin through its transparent surface.</p>

<p>The black sea conch’s eyes looked very human. They glared at Han Sen with disdain.</p>

<p>The rainbow crystal sea conch looked at Han Sen with its dreamy eyes. And then, the rainbow glass surrounding Han Sen began to shrink. It was squeezing Han Sen and the blood kirin together.</p>
