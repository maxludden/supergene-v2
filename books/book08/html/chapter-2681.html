<h2>Back to Deified</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2681</h3>

<p>“It must be the Demon Fruit… The Demon Fruit is working! Is
Shale going to become deified right in front of us?” Li Xue Cheng
merrily proclaimed.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen was thrilled as well. “Now I understand. Shale knew
that the silkworm fights were going to start, but he decided to eat
the Demon Fruit anyway. He hoped to use the pressure of a
challenging silkworm fight to accelerate his growth and activate
the dormant Demon Fruit power that resided in his body. During his
fight with Han Sen, the Demon Fruit inside him has slowly been
refined. Now, it must have all been absorbed. It will make him
deified in the middle of this very fight.”</p>
<p>“Shale is really leveling up to deified? There will be no more
debating which of the two will emerge victorious now. It will be
impossible for Han Sen to defeat a deified Shale.” Li Xue Cheng had
been quivering with fear earlier, but now his quaking was due to
unbridled glee.</p>
<p>This silkworm fight had been a non-stop rollercoaster of
emotions for the two men. Li Xue Cheng’s emotions had gone up and
down so much that he had thought his heart was going to leap out of
his chest.</p>
<p>The fires around Shale’s body turned black. Black symbols were
appearing across him, as if they were being carved into his exposed
skin. A frightening presence was emanating from the symbols.
Shale’s power began to generate substance chains.</p>
<p>“Back to deified once more?” Han Sen frowned. He wasn’t blind.
He could see that Shale’s power was changing.</p>
<p>Shale tipped his head back and roared to the sky, and the power
of his substance chains exploded. His previously golden hair was
suddenly dyed pitch black.</p>
<p>Shale used to look like a gold lion. Now his body had shrunk,
but his muscles looked more solid and powerful than ever. It was
like every cell in his body had filled up with an unimaginably
grand power.</p>
<p>The new, black-haired Shale didn’t look as wild. He looked
mysterious and alien. The black symbols were visible all across his
face, and black flames quivered across his body. He looked like
some sort of demon lion from hell.</p>
<p>“He has returned to deified.” Li Keer’s face looked
sickened.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter how talented or strong Han Sen was; he couldn’t
defeat a deified Shale. After all, deifieds were completely
different from all other ranks beneath them. They were as different
as the sky and the ground.</p>
<p>“Shale must have planned from the beginning to use this fight to
become deified again. He wanted to use Han Sen as his whetstone,”
Exquisite said glumly, then sighed. She understood the truth behind
it all now.</p>
<p>“That was excellent planning on Shale’s part,” Li Keer said with
a grunt. “He ate the Demon Fruit before the silkworm fight. If no
one presented him with a serious challenge, he could secure first
place. If he did find someone who could stand up to him, he could
refine the Demon Fruit and return to being deified and still secure
first place and all the spoils. He is a very smart man, I will
confess.”</p>
<p>Exquisite shook her head. “But again, it isn’t that simple. A
normal person would struggle to become deified again whether or not
they refined the Demon Fruit. Shale was able to become deified
because his talent was that exceptional. This may not have been his
plan at all.”</p>
<p>“No matter what his reasoning was, these are the results,” Li
Keer said in frustration.</p>
<p>Qiyu Elder and Open Sky Elder both looked very ill. And the Very
High people who had placed big bets on Han Sen looked just as
bad.</p>
<p>They thought they had seen a sound hope of victory, but it was
all gone now. Since the moment Shale became deified, their hopes
and dreams were squashed. Their hearts fell to the bottom of the
blackest abyss, and they couldn’t see the light of hope
anymore.</p>
<p>“I apologize. I tried to control my power, but I was unable to
suppress it. I have now returned to deified class.” Shale ceased
attacking. He felt guilty about what had happened.</p>
<p>What he said made everyone watching want to cough up blood. Many
creatures wanted nothing more than to become deified, and Shale had
been doing his best not to. That was quite upsetting.</p>
<p>If anyone else had said this, they might have sounded cocky. But
Shale was renowned for his honesty, and he certainly wasn’t putting
on an act. He had genuinely tried to suppress his power, but he
ended up becoming deified anyway. He had wanted to finish this
fight as a half-deified.</p>
<p>But fighting Han Sen had required too much from him. He had no
choice but to use his full power to fight, and so he was unable to
hold back the energy of the refined Demon Fruit. Once that dam of
power broke loose, he had become deified.</p>
<p>“There is no need to apologize. Your level is a part of your
power.” Han Sen didn’t think it was shameful for someone to fight
against an opponent of a lower level. If someone had a higher
level, they must have earned it.</p>
<p>“Today’s fight won’t count. I will wait until you become
deified, and then we will fight again,” Shale said, looking at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“This fight isn’t finished yet,” Han Sen responded, his face
unchanged.</p>
<p>Shale shook his head. “Although I don’t want to win while you
are at a lower level, I still need this first place. So, I’m sorry.
We should abandon this battle for now.”</p>
<p>“There is no need to apologize. Didn’t I just say our fight
hasn’t ended yet? If you can win, then it was because you were
better than me. But in order to decide that, we must first fight
and see who the victor truly is.” Han Sen gazed at Shale calmly. He
didn’t look very emotional.</p>
<p>When Liyu Zhen heard Han Sen say this, he coldly laughed and
said, “This Han Sen really doesn’t know his place. Shale has given
him plenty of opportunities to bow out gracefully, and he even
offered to leave this place together. That meant he would give Han
Sen second place. But still, the brat insists on fighting. If he
gets kicked out right now, he definitely won’t end up in second
place, either.”</p>
<p>Li Keer, Exquisite, and all the other Very High thought Han
Sen’s response had been too cocky. He should have accepted second
place instead of losing now.</p>
<p>But in contrast to their own thoughts, Li Keer and Exquisite
didn’t detect any fear within Han Sen. Instead, they felt an
overwhelming sensation of calm and confidence in him.</p>
<p>There was no need to be angry. There was no need to hate. There
was no need to blame fate or the people around him. This powerful,
placid confidence was something only superior people could
possess.</p>
<p>“But now Han Sen is a ridiculously dire situation. Why is he
still this confident?” Exquisite and Li Keer thought that Han Sen
had no reason to be so self-assured, but his confidence was so
strong that it affected them anyway. They began to feel like they
should trust in Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Come on. Keep going. I will fight you. Whether I win or lose, I
will walk out of here alone,” Han Sen said calmly as he looked at
Shale.</p>
<p>“Yes, this is how it should be.” Shale’s eyes flared with
excitement. He looked at Han Sen as if he was looking at his
favorite piece of art.</p>
<p>Perhaps Han Sen’s power wasn’t as strong as Shale’s, but Shale
wouldn’t underestimate him. The substance chains around him
exploded madly. He was like some leonine power of darkness that had
crawled up from the depths.</p>
<p>“Because of the respect I have for you, I will fight with all my
power.” Shale’s voice was like thunder as he swung his fist at Han
Sen.</p>
