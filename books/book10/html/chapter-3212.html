<p>Han Sen kept thinking. Whenever Wan’er reached the geno universe
and her gold power showed up, she would become exhausted. Han Sen
believed it was her body that had the problem. Now that he was able
to think about it some more, he started to believe it was similar
to what he was going through. The geno universe restricted all
powers that did not belong there.</p>
<p>Wan’er’s body needed to have her gold power restricted if her
body was to recover.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode did not get along well with her
power. It restricted her reverse Super God Spirit mode power. It
made her body normal again.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still confused about something. After Wan’er was
reborn, her body should have belonged to the race of the Witch.
They were from the geno universe. Even if she was restricted by the
geno universe, why did she have the powers of her past life?</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly came up with one possibility for this conundrum.
Perhaps the body of the Witch Wan’er did not actually belong to her
in the first place. It might have come from Qin Xiu, who went to
that world.</p>
<p>After thinking about this some more, Han Sen did not think that
could be accurate either. Qin Xiu’s gene race was World King God.
His power should have been similar to the World King God’s power
for him to combine with World King God and break the world.</p>
<p>His Super God Spirit mode power was not World King God’s power.
Han Sen thought it was weird. He could not understand it right now,
but there was one thing he knew for certain. The blonde lady he was
looking at was truly Wan’er, and she was probably combined with the
two Wan’er’s from both universes.</p>
<p>“Does that mean when World King God put me and Wan’er into the
tunnel that bridged the two worlds, it was supposed to just pull
the Witch Wan’er and combine her with the Wan’er of her past life
to revive Wan’er?” Han Sen was shocked. He could not be certain his
guess was correct.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body’s Super God Spirit mode was restricted by the
rules of the world. Now, Wan’er’s body power had become very strong
because the Wan’er from two worlds had combined. Han Sen could feel
his Super God Spirit mode had been severely restricted.</p>
<p>Even though he was a fair distance away from Wan’er, he could
barely feel his body and Super God Spirit mode power.</p>
<p>“If this Wan’er wants to kill someone, who in this world can
hope to stop her?” Han Sen felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood that the Super God Spirit mode was very
scary. When he could use it without its imposed limits, he could
fight Break World elites. He could even beat the low-level Break
World elites.</p>
<p>Now, Wan’er’s power dwarfed Han Sen’s power. After all, the
power of Wan’er from both worlds had been combined into one. Her
power had become the power of two people. This effect was not so
simple as one plus one equals two.</p>
<p>The current power Wan’er wielded made Han Sen’s heart shake.</p>
<p>At this time, Wan’er’s eyes opened to reveal gold pupils that
shone like a pair of suns.</p>
<p>Her eyes were very pretty, but they lacked warmth. Therefore,
her eyes looked cold.</p>
<p>“Alpha Princess, my surname is Qin…” Qin Jing Zhen had everyone
bow before the blonde lady. He hoped to receive her Blood-Pulse
blessing. Han Sen knew things were going to get worse. With
Wan’er’s situation being what it was, she would be just like the
blonde Wan’er. She would not recognize anyone.</p>
<p>In the past, Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode was able to cancel
Wan’er’s power. Now, it had been so long, and his Super God Spirit
mode power was being suppressed. Wan’er’s gold power was affected a
bit, but it could still explode. Han Sen wondered if he had the
power to stop Wan’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen prayed to himself, “I hope things won’t go as bad as I
think they might. I hope Qin Xiu is not as bad as I thought.”</p>
<p>For people like Han Sen, they had a knack for having their
greatest fears come true. It was not like he had a special feature.
It was just that he was able to perceive things for how they truly
were. If he thought something might happen, there was a high chance
he was right.</p>
<p>Wan’er floated in the air. Her blonde hair dropped. She was like
a god looking down on Qin Jing Zhen from a lofty place. She still
looked very cold. Qin Jing Zhen sensed something was really wrong.
His face changed. He could not help but retreat as many guards and
priests moved to protect him and Qin Bai.</p>
<p>Wan’er finally moved. Suddenly, she came right before Qin Bai.
She was so fast that the very powerful guards could not even see
how she moved.</p>
<p>Seeing Wan’er grab Qin Bai’s head, the other guards and priests
had yet to react. Only Qin Jing Zhen, who was next to Qin Bai,
noticed. His body mustered a scary power. He summoned a
thunder-like, destroying-the-world type power as he threw a punch
at Wan’er’s hands.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to confess he had underestimated the king. Ordinary
kings were usually busy with business affairs, so they never
practiced their combat to extreme levels.</p>
<p>Although the humans of the Qin Kingdom borrowed power from the
outside, if they did not have enough innate power or will, it was
hard to command a powerful God Spirit Blood-Pulse and gene races
well.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s power was not weak. Han Sen could tell he had
practiced hard.</p>
<p>He had not reached a Break World level, but he was a rare type
of person in the realm of humans. The punch he threw must have had
the power of Decapitation Queen.</p>
<p>Wan’er’s hand did not look very strong. It did not look like it
wielded any power. It was just that her hand was burning with a
gold flame.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>When Qin Jing Zhen’s punch touched down on Wan’er’s hand, the
king’s entire body flew away like a broken kite. As he descended,
he coughed up a lot of blood. His overbearing punch was swallowed
the moment it came into contact with the golden light. There was
not a single drop or dot left of it. It did not even make a
sound.</p>
<p>“My King!” the main priest screamed. He flew over and caught Qin
Jing Zhen’s body, but he also spat out blood. He hit a wall with
Qin Jing Zhen.</p>
<p>Wan’er’s hand still moved to grab Qin Bai’s head. Qin Bai was
frozen in place. He had never seen this before. He had never seen
his proud father ever be reduced to such trouble</p>
<p>A body flashed. Han Sen held Qin Bai and retreated like a
shadow.</p>
<p>No matter how much of an asshole Qin Bai was, he had always been
nice to Han Sen. Thus, Han Sen did not want to watch the boy get
killed right in front of him.</p>
<p>At the same time, the painting on the wall of the Destiny Well
chamber began to glow. The old man in the drawing had a god light.
He walked out of the painting like a god. He stood in front of
Wan’er.</p>
<p>The old man still held his black cane. His body brimmed with a
god light as he looked at Wan’er and said, “I promised to protect
this temple. No matter what you are, you cannot kill here.”</p>
