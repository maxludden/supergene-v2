Yisha hated Han Sen. Her power was amassing, building in strength. The purple flame broke through the enforced limit of Demon Grave. The power in her body was increasing.

But breaking through the power limit did not mean the suppression of Demon Grave was ineffective. Yisha’s power was too strong, so she broke past a limit She was crossing a line that allowed her to use a power that was not supposed to be in play there. Only elites like Yisha, who were halfway to becoming a god, had the power to do this. Not even an average King class could accomplish the same thing.

Because Yisha was only half-deified, she could not completely ignore the supposed limitations of Demon Grave. Her dramatic flare of power wasn’t actually as big of an improvement as it seemed. Still, she could ignore enough of Demon Grave’s suppression to raise her power to that of a Viscount.

Forcing her body to wield power like this was a definite strain. Even if she didn’t fight, simply holding the power would damage her.

If Han Sen hadn’t forced her hand, she would never have done this. But she was a Sword Queen, and she couldn’t idly accept what Han Sen was doing. So, she decided to kill him where he was, regardless of what it cost her.

Yisha was afraid Han Sen would steal the scabbard. And that was why she had been holding off, but now that it was inside the statue, nothing would happen. If she killed Han Sen, she could take the scabbard whenever she wanted. Now, without hesitation, she was happily unleashing her power.

Although she could only raise the power of a Viscount, that was enough. Yisha was holding her saw-knife. She didn’t swing it, but a purple flame was crawling atop it.

Han Sen was holding his Steel Centaur Shield, ready to withstand whatever attack came next. Suddenly, a sharp pain struck his arm. His flesh was exploding.

The wound on his arm was coming undone. Within a second, his entire arm was ripped open, revealing his white bones. The tear was spreading across his entire body.

Han Sen was shocked. If this continued, it would only take a few seconds for his entire body to be torn apart.

“You thought the teeth’s power was that slow? That was only because it was suppressed by Demon Grave. That was why it was so weak earlier. How dare you make me mad! Today is the day you die.” Yisha looked cold, as her purple flames increased.

Han Sen’s wounds were being ripped up faster as a purple mist moved along his flesh and muscles. It was scary to see. “Fuck! That’s nasty!” Han Sen shouted in his heart. He didn’t hesitate, as a red light suddenly appeared. It came right out of his genes, wrapping up his entire body.

Because the Dongxuan Armor had wrapped up Han Sen’s body, you could not tell the differences below its surfaces. But inside his armor, his body was changing. He began to look like he was made of red metal. He was becoming transparent, and a powerful presence was growing within him.

His super god body was activated. The tears in his arm stopped spreading, and the wounds that were covered by a purple aura were doused in white light. The purple air began to dissipate, and his wounds were starting to heal.

Han Sen felt as if his previously-suppressed body was no longer limited. Power coursed through his body, rumbling like a river.

Yisha looked at the white light overwhelming Han Sen’s arm and felt the scary presence he exuded. Her face changed and she said, “You… you’ve touched the deified door?”

Han Sen did not answer. He pulled out a gold bow and a white bone arrow. The white light entered the arrow, activating a slumbering power. The bone arrow shivered to life, and a white light came out of it

“The Archangel Bone Arrow? How?!” Yisha was shocked. She was not shocked about the presence of the arrow itself, even though it had been made from the bones of a King Feather. It had King power.

Normally, an enemy of King class power was no concern for Yisha. She wagered she could block it. But inside Demon Grave, she had damaged her own body to achieve the power of a Viscount Yet the Archangel Bone Arrow had the same power that it would on the outside. It was not affected, so it was scary.

Retrieving the scabbard was no longer Yisha’s highest priority, so she flew away from the statue and departed the lake.

An Archangel Bone Arrow with full power was not something she could trifle with.

Buzz!

Han Sen moved his finger and fired the bone arrow. It reached Yisha’s chest the instant it left the string. She couldn’t evade that projectile.

Yisha was a deified elite. Even though her powers were suppressed, her reaction was still quite fast. She lifted the saw knife in front of her chest, and the bone arrow hit the blade.

The holy light raged with the intensity of a volcano. It exploded against the knife when the arrow came into contact with it. And a katcha noise quickly followed. The saw-knife that was still a bit powerful in there, made of an unknown material, suddenly broke. The bone arrow plunged into her chest and rocketed out of her back. It went through another dozen grapevines before its flight was halted.

Blergh!

Yisha coughed up blood: a huge hole had been blown through her heart. She was not dead, though. She was still gathering up power. She ran into the grapevines and disappeared.

Han Sen wished to give chase, but his body was feeling weak. He exited super god spirit mode, as he could only use it for a limited time.

“What a scary woman! She didn’t die.” Han Sen sighed, giving up on pursuing her.

Han Sen turned around and looked at the forehead of the statue and the scabbard within. He grabbed the part that was sticking out slightly and tried yanking it out.

When Han Sen pulled on it, it refused to budge. After a few more pulls, it still didn’t come free.
