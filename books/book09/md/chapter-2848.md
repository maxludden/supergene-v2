  "You being dead and me being alive is the best gamble to bet on," Yisha coldly said. A jade, crystal-looking Teeth Knife was brewing in her hands. It quickly came flying at Han Sen.

The purple knife air became a roaring, swallowing, evil ghost. It slashed toward Han Sen.

Han Sen smiled. He used the scabbard in his hands like a knife and thrust it forward.

But Han Sen did not use Teeth Knife power. He only used pure power to slash toward Yisha's teeth knife.

Pang!

The two powers collided in space. The purple, evil, ghost-looking knife air was being cut open by the scabbard in Han Sen's hand. The purple air was like some dragonfly that vanished in the air.

"You have really reached larva class," Han Sen said. "With that kind of practice, you are better than the old Rebate alpha."

Yisha seemed to know her attack would do nothing against Dollar. She used the teeth knife, which only God knew what kind of beast's teeth it was composed of, and made some weird kind of powerful movement.

It wasn't actually the teeth knife moving. It was the space around that was moving.

Teeth knife power did not leak out. It had been kept at a very low profile, which made the energy around go toward the teeth knife.

The teeth knife, which looked like crystal or jade, was suddenly dyed and turned a deep purple. It was like an evil ghost fang that had emerged from hell.

This kind of power movement is kind of like teeth power, but it is also kind of different. What kind of power is this? Han Sen was shocked, but he quickly realized what sort of power it was. The teeth knife itself has just reached deified class, and Yisha is only larva class. The second part must have been a modification of her own. This must be the teeth knife she has modified. I wonder what the difference is between this teeth knife and the teeth knife from the past.

Han Sen was not in a rush to strike. He wanted to know what the knife skill was that Yisha had modified through teeth knife. He wanted to know the sort of power it possessed.

Yisha's stared at Han Sen with an invasive look. The teeth knife movement in her hand was becoming weaker, but the color was becoming deeper per. The purple looked so deep that it almost appeared black.

Han Sen's heart felt a little bit scared. It was the reaction one had when sensing one was in danger. It made Han Sen's face more serious looking.

"I thought you wanted to bet, so let's bet if you are going to live under the strike of my knife," Yisha said. The teeth knife in her hand, which looked like an evil ghost fang, was lifted above her head. She immediately slashed toward Han Sen.

Han Sen saw a line of knife airs teleporting in front of him. Their substance chains were thinner than a hair by 100%. Normal people could not see it. One could not see the knife air.

Han Sen's heart was shocked by this. Anywhere a knife air went, there was space fabric tear. It was scarier than a space element, space-cutting skill.

The knife air came fast. Han Sen had no time to hesitate. He generated power with the scabbard and struck toward the silk-looking knife air.

It was silent. The scabbard's sturdiness was comparative to a deified treasure, but it was suddenly broken by the thin knife air. The scary knife air still kept coming toward Han Sen's body.

His body made a quick reaction. He flashed, and the scary knife air went right past his shoulder. The armor on his shoulder and a piece of his flesh were taken away.

The knife air kept expanding. Wherever the knife air went, the purple spread. It was like ink in water. It was slowly dyeing everything around.

Space was not water. It could not be dyed, but that scary purple ripped through space and kept on tearing it.

"Since when did teeth power become this scary? It can continuously rip space?" Upon seeing space continue to rip, many deifieds were shocked.

"That is not pure teeth power. It has combined with some kind of cutting-element power. Even Dollar was unable to withstand that sharp power. It looks like Knife Queen has practiced teeth power so much that it has reached a whole new level. The strength of that power is no worse than the most destructive geno arts in the whole universe." Sky Palace Leader stroked his beard. He was feeling pleased, so he smiled.

He admired Yisha. He even wanted Yisha to become his student. Although something happened to stop her from becoming his student, he was not being cheap with his praises of her.

It did not matter what happened before. Since Yisha brought the Rebate to Sky Palace, he treated Yisha like a proper student. Otherwise, no matter how talented Yisha was, she could not have leveled up this much in such a short amount of time.

"Scary teeth knife. From now on, this could be one of the best geno arts in the universe," Second Uncle Bai Buyi said.

Space was being ripped. The wound on Han Sen's shoulder was also being ripped. With the strength of his xenogeneic body, it was not quick. Still, he was being ripped slowly but surely. Purple was spreading across his wounds, making his wounds split up further inch by inch. It was like a demon, hell, ghost mouth opening.

"That is very powerful knife air, but if you think this kind of knife air can kill me, you have underestimated me. I am Dollar." Han Sen did not move. The wound on his shoulder suddenly went still. It was as if it had frozen. It stopped spreading. It was like the wound and the knife air had been frozen stiff.

Han Sen forcefully stopped the universal cogwheel's spin. It made the wound on his body stop, but his power was not enough to wholly reverse the spin of the universal cogwheel. So, the wound did not go away.

"If one slash won't work, I will just have to perform another cut." Yisha's voice was cold as ice. She slashed forward with her teeth knife again.

There was no defense involved. She used her aggressive knife skills, and that was all. It was a very mad knife skill that only attacked people. In fact, she did not even have to defend. With teeth knife's new scary and destructive powers, it could rip up every substance. If she was able to get a hit on her enemy and kill the enemy, that was already the best defense.

Han Sen held the broken scabbard and presented a wry smile. He thought, She does not even want the scabbard! She is trying to kill me!

Han Sen was ready to raise the scabbard again, but he noticed something was wrong. Where the scabbard had broken, a weird light flashed from inside.

What's going on? The knife air was near him. Han Sen did not have the time to look at what had happened with the scabbard. While he was dodging, he dodged the knife light.

The moment Han Sen evaded the knife air, Yisha's teeth knife was like a purple bolt of lightning. It slashed and crossed where he had been, but the knife air that had generated in space was like a purple bolt of lightning that did not disappear. It did not just stay in space. It kept ripping. Suddenly, a large parcel of space was doused in purple. It was like a purple spider web in space.
