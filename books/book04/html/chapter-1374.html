      “Why wouldn’t you want your Blood Legion relic back?” Han Sen asked with a
      frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian’s face turned dour, and he returned the question with one of
      his own. “Tell me: are you Han Jinzhi’s heir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My great-grandfather is Han Jinzhi, but not the one from the Blueblood
      Special Forces,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>Nan Litian frowned, as if he was thinking of something.</p>
    <p>
      “Is he really not the heir of Han Jinzhi?” Nan Litian murmured to himself.
      He paused before addressing himself once more, saying, “But if he wasn’t,
      why would he have the relic? And there’s no way he could carry that on
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You still didn’t tell me why only my family wants it,” Han Sen said,
      thinking his enemy’s self-narration was a little creepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It doesn’t matter, if you’re not Han Jinzhi’s heir. But you know my
      identity, and that is a transgression that does not allow me the pleasure
      of letting you live. You must die for this,” Nan Litian said, summoning a
      dagger he could try to cut Han Sen with, on the adjacent flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both trapped like mummies, and there was nothing Han Sen could
      do to dodge. He only had his Demon Heart Ring, his Crystal Egg, and his
      Bulwark Umbrella. He summoned the umbrella to block the mind-controlled
      dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dagger flew against the umbrella, and it could not break the
      established defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian summoned his green sword then, and had it propped to take aim
      at Han Sen’s throat. Han Sen did not have the time to reposition the
      umbrella to block the green sword that was now coming for him, and he was
      left exposed to its attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Super Spank, he tried to pull and unfurl the vines that had wrapped
      him up. Unfortunately, no matter what he tried, the plant did not budge.
      He then believed it to be a sacred-blood tree, but that didn’t mean much
      right now, given the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the sword come for him, only one viable option remained for Han Sen
      to try. He activated super king spirit, in the hopes it would provide
      enough of a boost in power to free him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s body, his eyes, and his hair all turned white, the latter
      growing extremely long. It floated menacingly all around him, as if he was
      underwater. But before Han Sen used his strength to tear off the vines and
      bring ruin to the flower that had trapped him, they decided to let him go
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Han Sen believed it to be an act of self-defense, not wanting to
      let itself get hurt when it detected the power he now wielded. But then,
      the vines that had encased him moved over to the sword that was alarmingly
      close to decapitating him, and tangled it up. It had done so to protect
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s going on?” Han Sen thought this was extremely strange. A tree that
      had gone to lengths to wrap them both up was something he believed to be
      hostile.
    </p>
    <p>The flower then created a platform for Han Sen to step on.</p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian looked on in shock, unable to believe a powerful geno plant
      would side with Han Sen, as it was doing now,
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you have the aura of a spirit? And… why do you smell like a
      creature?! What… are you?” Nan Litian had never seen anything like this
      before. He was well and truly flabbergasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at his super king spirit body now, and he saw how it
      propagated the sense of him being both a creature and a spirit. The sense
      of countless different creatures filled him up, many of which were ones
      that not even Han Sen himself could recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s thoughts suddenly turned to the name super king spirit.
      Ordinarily, a level that was higher than a king spirit was dubbed emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term super was a tier-definition given to creatures. It wasn’t until
      now that Han Sen realized it could harness the power and aura of a
      creature, as much as a spirit. The spirit in the title of this form was
      more likely a general term, a synonym for energy, soul, or essence. It
      didn’t exclusively mean he became an actual spirit, of the sanctuary’s
      definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who I am does not matter. Due to your repeated attempts of murder, your
      life is forfeit unto me.” Han Sen walked back towards Nan Litian,
      harnessing and manipulating the shock his nemesis had just experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Han Sen’s feet, the flower continued to generate platforms for him
      to walk upon. More and more platforms came as swiftly as Han Sen moved,
      forming a perfectly safe walkway for him to tread. They guided him to Nan
      Litian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen came before his foe and asked, “Who are you in Blood Legion? What
      are you regarded as?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian, who was still trapped, said, “I am a successor of Li Hen.”
    </p>
    <p>“Are you one of the thirteen?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      Although Nan Litian was strong, Han Sen did not think he was as strong as
      God’s Retribution.
    </p>
    <p>“I am not him; I merely carry his torch,” Nan Litian rushed to speak.</p>
    <p>
      “Is there a difference?” Han Sen didn’t know too much about how Blood
      Legion worked, so it was a legitimate question.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You need the purest blood to become one of the thirteen, and I don’t have
      it,” Nan Litian answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen suddenly heard a noise. Turning to look at where it had come from,
      he saw Bao’er riding Red Pony, coming his way.
    </p>
    <p>Red Pony had delivered Bao’er to Han Sen safely, it seemed.</p>
    <p>
      Not wanting the bulls to hurt them, in case those wild creatures sought to
      give them the same treatment, Han Sen leaped down to meet with them on the
      ground of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dad!” Bao’er jumped into Han Sen’s arms as soon as she could. Red Pony
      had Han Sen’s Gold Dragon Lock clipped to its behind. Han Sen wondered
      why, then realized that it had dragged the black unicorn here on Han Sen’s
      behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was delighted, not expecting Red Pony to be so kind as to do that
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Pony dropped the Gold Dragon Lock to the ground so Han Sen could take
      it back. When Han Sen examined the state of the black unicorn, he wagered
      it must have tried to wrestle its way free. The binding ropes of the lock
      had dug deeply into the creature’s flesh. It was a ghastly sight.
