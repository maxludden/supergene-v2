  Han Sen, Wang Yuhang, and Li Xinglun sat in a triangular formation in an ice cave. They placed the fist-sized Life Geno essence in the middle.

Wang Yuhang gulped, asking, "Is this really a Life Geno essence?"

Li Xinglun could not believe what they had accomplished this day, and so he said, "Did we really kill a super creature? Are we the first to ever do so in the Second God's Sanctuary?"

"Bossman, are you going to sell the Life Geno essence? According to the contract I signed with you, I should receive a 30% cut of the proceeds. If you want, I'll pay you the additional 70% and purchase it off you entirely," Wang Yuhang asked, looking at Han Sen.

From the contract that they had signed, it stated that Han Sen was to receive 50%, Wang Yuhang was to receive 30%, and Li Xinglun was to receive 20%.

If Han Sen decided that he didn't want it, what happened with the Life Geno essence next fell to Wang Yuhang.

"Of course I want it; I want super geno points," Han Sen replied succinctly. There was no way he was going to pass up such a treasure.

Wang Yuhang coughed and said, "Bossman, from what I have heard, after the Ji family obtained their own Life Geno essence, no progress was made. They tried everything they could, but they were unable to obtain super geno points. If you return with this in your possession, it will most likely yield the same result. If you want, sell it to me. Or foregoing that, provide it to me and the Wang estate. We can investigate its secrets on your behalf and see if we can learn how to obtain super geno points from the Life Geno essence."

"The Ji family's Life Geno essence was never consumed?" Han Sen was surprised to hear this. He had assumed that Ji Qing had eaten the Life Geno essence a long time ago. He did not expect that they were still investigating how to obtain super geno points from the artifact, and couldn't simply eat it straight away.

"Yes, they have tried a great many different ways of eating it but they were all to no avail. The Life Geno essence is like obsidian. It cannot be hewn in two, burnt, or drowned," Wang Yuhang said.

Li Xinglun then chimed in to say, "It is, indeed. I hacked into the Ji family's system and perused their records. They have tried countless different methods, but they were all hopeless. They're at their wits end, trying to figure out how they might gain super geno points. They even called upon professionals from the Alliance, but that was futile, too. Zero progress has been made. That is most likely why the Alliance has yet to make an announcement about the super creature and super geno points."

"Did they try swallowing it?" Han Sen asked.

"They did. It was useless swallowing it, as well. It came out whole and was not digested in the slightest," Li Xinglun said.

Han Sen frowned when he heard this. This was different than what he knew about super geno points. He had just licked it and swallowed it whole. Why was Ji Qing's different?

But it was not impossible. After all, the other two he had managed to collect here in the Second God's Sanctuary were inedible, too. They were different than the one he managed to get in the First God's Sanctuary.

"If the Ji family's Life Geno essence is unedible, then that is quite interesting," Han Sen thought to himself. He believed there had to be a problem somewhere.

"Bossman, consider it! Lend it to me and the Wang family will do their best to investigate it. I promise you; the moment a discovery is made, you will be the first to know!" Wang Yuhang said.

"This is my first time getting a Life Geno essence, as well. How about you let me investigate it first? The share you deserve; do you want it now or next time?" Han Sen did not want to give it to the Wang family for research. But, if he really couldn't figure out how to consume the item, then he might have to reconsider.

"Save it for next time," Wang Yuhang and Li Xinglun replied, simultaneously.

They didn't have any particular lack of finance, so they weren't willing to give up their share for money. And so, they decided to save it for next time.

Han Sen brought the frosty bear's Life Geno essence back to research. This Life Geno essence was cold, and a striking opposite to the Fire-Scale T-rex's Life Geno essence. But because Han Sen had Jadeskin, he was not afraid of its cold aura.

Han Sen was in his room. As he held it in his hands, he repeatedly licked it. But no matter how many times he tried, nothing happened. He licked and licked, but it did not melt.

"I still can't eat it. What gives? What must I do to make this essence become super geno points?" Han Sen held onto the Life Geno essence, continuing to observe it. "Is it like those western fantasy stories? Perhaps these are the cores of beasts? Do I have to practice the same element to absorb it?"

Whilst holding onto the icy crystal, Han Sen began running Jadeskin. He once absorbed Xue Yikuang's frosted air. If he needed the same element to absorb the Life Geno essence, then could the cold air of the crystal be absorbed by Jadeskin?

But no matter how many times or ways Han Sen tried casting Jadeskin, there was no reaction. It couldn't be absorbed or refined or anything. Nothing would happen.

"This is strange. For what reason is it like this? If the Ji family were unable to figure out this Life Geno essence, does that mean the First God's Sanctuary and Second God's Sanctuary are the same? But if so, how was I able to eat a Life Geno essence whilst I was in the First God's Sanctuary? And why can Ji Qing not eat one, despite being in the First God's Sanctuary, too?" Han Sen just couldn't wrap his head around it.

Han Sen now really wanted people in the First God's Sanctuary to kill more super creatures, so he could find out whether or not others in the First God's Sanctuary could eat a Life Geno essence.

Han Sen was researching the Life Geno essence, and the rumor of him potentially slaying a super creature began to spread. After all, there were many witnesses. And there were many factions privy to the knowledge of the existence of super creatures. They were starting to believe what Han Sen had killed was a super creature of the Second God's Sanctuary.

"Han Sen is a special man." When the Wang family heard of this through Wang Yuhang, they were rightfully shocked.

"Mister Han's child is special indeed. He has only been in the Second God's Sanctuary for just over a year. He actually killed a super creature there..." The Ning family heard this news, too. And they immediately took it as fact that Han Sen was the child of Han Jingzhi.

"The Ji family came forward first, damn it!" The Ji family's competitors heard the news, believing Han Sen belonged to the Ji family.

And the Ji family members were confused. They did not know what to make of the situation. Ji Yanran's boyfriend did not have a background of any particular renown, or any important ties. Some people in the Ji family did not like Han Sen very much, but now there was a rumor making the rounds that he had killed a super creature in the Second God's Sanctuary.

At first, the Ji family did not believe it. After all, the Ji family had spent on a lot on providing Ji Qing what she needed to slay a super creature. They hired three hundred elite evolvers to help Ji Qing kill a super creature in the First God's Sanctuary. It was a big price to pay to hunt a creature.

And the rumor also stated that Han Sen pretty much took care of the super creature solo. And it was a super creature of the Second God's Sanctuary, too; it was difficult to believe.
