<h2>First Battle With a Xenogeneic</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1722</h3>

<p>Han Sen recognized what he was seeing. Judging from its
appearance, it was a Kate.</p>
<p>It looked like a human, but it had cat ears and a cat tail, too.
That meant it was a Kate.</p>
<p>But it was different from the other Kate people that Han Sen had
seen. It had no geno armor, and its nails were half a foot long.
They were like swords, and they shone with a fluorescent blue
color. The eyes of the creature were glowing red, as well.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic did not stop after rushing past Han Sen and Suo
Tu, and it went straight for Long. Its hands, each bearing five
dagger-like nails, flashed toward Long’s head.</p>
<p>It was too fast, and Long didn’t have time to dodge the strike.
He shouted, lifted his shield, and blocked the attack.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The sharp nails obliterated the shield and pierced straight into
his geno armor and skin, leaving him with five lacerations that
bled profusely. Fortunately, the shield had absorbed most of the
damage, and the hits he had taken were not half as bad as what they
could have been.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the xenogeneic went right for another
soldier. That soldier had been in too much shock and had forgotten
to dodge. His legs trembled as the xenogeneic approached, right
until the moment the creature annihilated his head and painted the
surroundings with his brain.</p>
<p>“Fall back! Fall back!” The leader fired his gun at the
xenogeneic.</p>
<p>When the bullets hit the foe, they crackled against him like
fireworks. They didn’t even break the skin, though.</p>
<p>“Report! Xenogeneic discovered in the south-west” The leader
barked his report into his phone, all the while shooting at the
enemy.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic didn’t even seem to notice the bullets. He just
jumped back towards Long, who had only just gotten back on his
feet.</p>
<p>Long’s face turned white. It was too late for him to dodge, and
he had no shield. He lifted his sword and brought it down toward
the xenogeneic’s hand.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic’s hand grabbed the sword. The creature gently
pressed on it, and it shattered. The creature’s other hand was
moving forward to grab Long’s head, though.</p>
<p>There was nowhere Long could run, and he abandoned all hope. He
fell back, wanting to escape, but he was far slower than the
xenogeneic. Dodging was a futile endeavor.</p>
<p>Just as the hand was coming down to plant itself on Long’s face,
a fist wrapped in black armor appeared above him. It punched the
xenogeneic right on its temple, knocking the creature away.</p>
<p>The punch did not hurt the xenogeneic, but it freed Long. And
when he turned to look at the savior-fist, he noticed it was the
doing of none other than Han Sen.</p>
<p>Long looked at Han Sen with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised by what he had done, too. He had gathered
up all the strength of his Spell geno armor to deliver that punch.
He punched the xenogeneic’s head, but all it had done was knock the
creature off-balance for a few steps. The geno armor wasn’t
comparable to the xenogeneic.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic looked at Han Sen and then jumped towards him. It
was so fast, it was like a shadow.</p>
<p>“Run!” Suo Tu picked up Long and shouted at Han Sen. Han Sen
could not outrun their foe, though.</p>
<p>Not that Han Sen planned on running. He was very calm and
confident, and his steps were as gentle as the slithering of a
snake. He lowered himself into a beautiful fighting form.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic’s power was stronger than Han Sen’s, but that did
not mean he could not rival it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power and speed were nothing compared to what could be
achieved in the geno universe, but his combat skills were the
best.</p>
<p>Han Sen pushed his movement to the max, making his body bob and
weave, left and right. No one could predict where he was going.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic tried to jump and catch Han Sen, but it couldn’t
lay a finger on him.</p>
<p>Suo Tu and the team were frozen in shock at the spectacle.
Although the creature was only a step behind Han Sen, he was not at
all frightened. Each of his movements was made with absolute
composure and calm, and he managed to avoid the xenogeneic’s
attacks each and every time. It was rather difficult to
believe.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s speed was not too far off Suo Tu’s, but it was still
quite slow compared to the xenogeneic. But he could dodge the
xenogeneic’s attack all the same, and the xenogeneic couldn’t even
scrape his armor. It was very surprising.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his abilities of prediction and judgment to lead
the enemy north.</p>
<p>Han Sen wouldn’t be able to kill the vile thing with his own
power, so he wanted to draw it to Mister Tiger. Perhaps the Noble
could get rid of it.</p>
<p>The soldiers had cameras, and when Han Sen’s group was attacked,
those at CIC could view the situation.</p>
<p>“Damn! There are two xenogeneics. What do we do? Mister Tiger is
already dealing with one, and we can’t deal with the other. We
should have invited Mister Allan.” Commander Guris’ forehead was
sweating.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. There’s a soldier leading the xenogeneic at
eleven o’clock,” a moderator shouted.</p>
<p>The commander could not believe that “No way! How can an
ordinary soldier do that?”</p>
<p>When he saw it clearly, he was shocked. The soldier’s body was
moving left and right, and you could see that he was not scared. He
was intimidating to watch.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic was chasing the man, unable to hurt him. The
soldier was evidently leading it in a particular direction.</p>
<p>“Who is that soldier?” Commander Guris was frozen in awe. Han
Sen was like an artist. He had never before seen someone move with
such grace and dexterity.</p>
<p>“Sir, his name is Han Sen. He is the outsider Hardman brought
in,” the moderator said.</p>
<p>“The outsider that was able to make the flowers chime but failed
to become a Noble?” Commander Guris mumbled to himself. Then, his
face changed. He grabbed the phone and said, “Don’t draw the
xenogeneic to eleven o’ clock, do you hear me? Answer me!”</p>
<p>Mister Tiger was already fighting a xenogeneic, and if another
one joined the fight, he’d be in danger. If that occurred, the
operation would be over.</p>
