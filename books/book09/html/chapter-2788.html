<h2>Big Fire Burns the Flowers</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2788</h3>

<p>They were still wildly powerful. As they went, their bodies kept
changing. They had become extremely strong. When Bai Wanjie
unleashed his power against a Flower God, he could only send them
flying. The Flower Gods were never slow in catching up.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie, who was a deified elite, was the only one who could
do that. The others from the Extreme King were doing even worse.
There weren’t many of the Extreme King following Bai Wanjie. Most
of them looked to be riddled with injuries. It appeared as if many
had been killed.</p>
<p>The girl Han Sen had spoken to before made strange movements.
She was able to move perfectly when the Flower Gods chased her, and
she was able to avoid taking damage from the fiends.</p>
<p>Since they were not able to kill the Flower Gods, Bai Wanjie and
the others could only flee. They did not have time to fight them
face-to-face.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have much reason to be interested in their
struggle. Plus, they were people from the Extreme King. Han Sen and
the Extreme King had a deep-seated grudge with each other. Han Sen
considered himself nice enough for not making things worse for
them. Either way, he was certainly not going to make an effort to
rescue the Extreme King’s crown prince.</p>
<p>When Bai Wanjie and the others walked past them, a few of the
Flower Gods noticed Han Sen and Xie Qing King, then went to
them.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie and the girl saw Xie Qing King and Han Sen, but they
did not bring the Flower Gods to them on purpose.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie did not believe people could kill those Flower Gods,
so he did not expect Han Sen would be able to do much of anything.
They didn’t draw the Flower Gods to them on purpose. When the few
Flower Gods noticed Han Sen and Xie Qing King, they went after
them.</p>
<p>The girl shouted in Han Sen’s direction. “Why are you frozen
there? Hurry up and run!”</p>
<p>She had just finished shouting when she saw Han Sen throw a
punch toward one of the Flower Gods. She could not help but shout,
“Is this guy crazy? If he is trapped here and has a burden, he
cannot even hope to escape!”</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>While the girl was thinking, Han Sen’s fist powered into the
face of one of the Flower Gods. The strong power blasted the Flower
God a few hundred feet away. It broke through many trees before
collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>“That power is unbelievable!” The girl was shocked. Han Sen’s
punch was far stronger than what Bai Wanjie was able to do, which
surprised her a great deal.</p>
<p>“Even if he is strong, it is futile. The Flower Gods can never
die… Never…” The girl was frozen. Her eyes were opened wide in
sheer disbelief.</p>
<p>The Flower God that had been punched away by Han Sen was burning
with a white flame.</p>
<p>The Flower Gods had been fighting against them for a while. They
knew the bodies of the Flower Gods were obscenely strong. Even if
they were hurt, they quickly recovered. They did not seem to know
the meaning of pain.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie had used many different geno arts to punch them away.
He had done this several times. All the different powers used
hadn’t been effective on them. He had not been able to make a
single one scream.</p>
<p>Now, the Flower God was screaming and rolling around on fire. It
squealed like a pig getting slaughtered.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the other Flower Gods were not content to sit still.
Han Sen’s body was like a swimming dragon. He punched each of the
Flower Gods once. Within the blink of an eye, they all fell on the
floor.</p>
<p>It was different from the Flower Gods Bai Wanjie had knocked to
the ground. The Flower Gods Han Sen punched down were unable to get
back up. They were all writhing around on the floor, burning due to
the pain inflicted by the fire. It made Bai Wanjie and the others
feel very weird.</p>
<p>The scorching white flame was burning them, but the bodies of
the Flower Gods did not look to be incinerated. Either way, the
flowers atop their heads were rendered little more than ash. When
the flowers were gone, so too was the fire. The few Flower Gods
fell to the ground without any energy. They stopped screaming. They
refused to get up and continue their assault.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie and the others sensed that the presence of those
bodies had been weakened. They were not deified anymore. They were
only King class at best.</p>
<p>“What is that fire?” the girl asked with surprise. Clearly, Han
Sen’s power was the right remedy for sorting out those Flower
Gods.</p>
<p>“Thank you for helping me out.” Bai Wanjie brought his people
over to see Han Sen. He drew the final few leftover Flower Gods
over, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly dropped all of the Flower Gods onto the ground.
Again, they writhed around in pain due to the fire.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that, the Extreme King people were shocked. They had
been chased by the Flower Gods for a long time and run out of
options. They thought they would for sure bite it in the end. After
all, many people already had.</p>
<p>The monsters, which had once been thought invulnerable, were
killed by Han Sen with ease. They could scarcely believe it.</p>
<p>That was especially true for the Extreme King girl. She looked
at Han Sen weirdly, as if they did not know each other.</p>
<p>“You are welcome, My Crown Prince,” Xie Qing King said with a
smile. “We are all trapped here, and so it is only right that we
help each other out.”</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie thanked Xie Qing King again. He looked at Han Sen and
said, “I wonder what your name is.”</p>
<p>“San Mu,” Han Sen coldly answered, but he did not look at Bai
Wanjie.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie had no idea who he was. It seemed as if he really
wanted to ally with Han Sen as he went on to profusely compliment
him. Han Sen just ignored him completely. He didn’t say a word
back.</p>
<p>“San Mu is always like this. Please, do not mind him, Mister
Crown Prince.” Xie Qing King looked down at the Flower Gods without
their flowers. They were not dead. They eventually staggered up to
their feet.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie and the others from the Extreme King were going to
kill them, but the Flower Gods walked in front of Han Sen and
kneeled. They said, “Thank you for saving us! Please show us mercy
and save the rest of our people.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak. He looked at Xie Qing King nearby.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King cleared his throat and replied, “We can save you,
but what can you reward us with?”</p>
<p>“If you two are willing to save our endangered people, we are
willing to share the Space Garden,” an old Flower God said.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King smiled and said, “I don’t like sharing
things.”</p>
<p>The faces of the Flower Gods changed. They understood what Xie
Qing King meant.</p>
<p>“If you guys can save my people, the whole of the Flower God
race will be willing to serve you.” It was still the old Flower God
doing the talking.</p>
<p>“Do you stay true to your word?” Xie Qing King looked the old
man up and down.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am the leader of the Flower Gods,” the old man said with
a sigh.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Xie Qing King looked at each other. They sensed how
happy they both were. They had broken their shoes, unable to find
what they were looking for. Now, they had achieved it all with
ease.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie wanted the Flower Gods, but he did not know who Han
Sen was, and he was surprised by Han Sen’s strange power. He did
not dare fight him. He just watched Xie Qing King claiming the
Flower Gods.</p>
