      “Help me, Little Star.” Han Sen saw Little Silver and Bao’er sitting on
      the back of Little Star, and nothing seemed to be happening to them. As
      for Little Star, it didn’t seem to be affected by that pulling force at
      all. It was floating in the sky, relaxed. Han Sen called for Little Star’s
      attention, and at the same time, he pulled back his power and stopped
      fighting that pulling force. Instead, he dived.
    </p>
    <p>Splash!</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen fell into the lake. Unexpectedly, the fluorescent lake water
      wasn’t cold at all, but warm like a hot spring, which was very
      comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, that powerful pulling force didn’t give Han Sen a chance to
      actually enjoy the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Re-engaging his power, Han Sen fought that terrific gravity-like power and
      grabbed a hold of Xu Mi. He then threw Xu Mi into the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Star turned its body in the sky and caught Xu Mi with its tail,
      putting him on its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then dived into the water like a dragon, and he swam toward Lin
      Feng and Jing Jiwu who were still sinking. He then threw them out of the
      water one by one.
    </p>
    <p>Little Star then flew toward them, putting both of them on its back.</p>
    <p>
      He then found Dragon Chef, and after throwing her out of the water, Han
      Sen was about to rush out himself. However, he felt that something was
      binding his feet, and a horrifying force was dragging him down deeper into
      the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used his God’s geno core and bloodthirsty ant king power at the
      same time, yet they couldn’t resist that powerful pulling force, and he
      was being dragged into the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      “G<em>dd</em>mn it”, there’s definitely something down there! Han Sen was
      shocked. The God’s geno core, together with bloodthirsty ant king and Han
      Sen’s own body, made Han Sen as powerful as ordinary super creatures, or
      perhaps even stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But those forces combined weren’t a match for the force in the water. It
      kept dragging Han Sen down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen tried to fight it, but that didn’t work very well. He wanted to
      see what was dragging him down, but he could only see spots of light
      beneath him. Other than those, nothing was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt that something had bound his feet, so he focused on that. He
      summoned his Split-Knife and slashed toward whatever was trapping his feet
      After slashing several times, he couldn’t find anything to cut. The force
      trapping him didn’t show any sign of relieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was completely shocked. Split-Knife was able to easily kill super
      creatures, so if something was actually binding his feet, he should’ve cut
      it already. However, he didn’t slash anything, yet he still felt that his
      feet were trapped, which kind of confused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t have time to think about it now. The force was getting
      stronger and stronger, and it was pulling him down relentlessly. Han Sen
      was already over a thousand feet deep in the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t know what was down there. Perhaps there was a giant bloody
      mouth waiting for him at the bottom, waiting to eat and swallow him.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen entered super king spirit mode immediately.</p>
    <p>
      Before Han Sen could take further action, he felt the force at his feet
      relax, and the power binding his ankles disappeared. He couldn’t feel that
      pulling force anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t have the mental capacity to wonder why that force suddenly
      disappeared. He summoned all his courage and rushed forward, and without
      the pulling force, Han Sen successfully flew out of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he breached the surface, Han Sen deactivated the super king spirit
      mode, already as he didn’t want Xu Mi and the others to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen appear from the lake, Little Star chuffed in joy and rushed
      toward Han Sen, putting him on its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What happened? Why did it take you so long to come out? Did you see
      anything down there?” the Dragon Lady Chef asked Han Sen curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had saved all of them, so naturally, he had the power to get out
      himself, which was why they didn’t think of anything else. They thought
      that Han Sen found something down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen smiled. “I didn’t find anything. After I pushed you guys out,
      something trapped my feet, and my strength couldn’t resist the power of
      that thing. I kept sinking, and thank God, I got rid of it and got away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone heard what Han Sen said, and they all looked at Han Sen’s feet.
      Everyone was dazed by what they had just seen, and they all looked at Han
      Sen in a weird way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, I can’t believe you have such a weird habit.” Jing Jiwu looked
      at Han Sen, seeming confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are you talking about? Han Sen was dazed. He then looked down at his
      feet and found himself equally surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of nowhere, Han Sen had a shoe on one of his feet. Han Sen was sure
      that it was definitely not his shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen came to Wind Song Desert, he had been wearing a beast soul
      armor, but he hadn’t worn any shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, he was still wearing the armor, and the fighting boots were
      attached to the armor. How was it possible that he was wearing a shoe?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was indeed a shoe on his left foot, and it was a
      high-heeled shoe that belonged to a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoe looked fabulous, and it was comparable with the shoes of luxury
      brands, if not better. With Han Sen wearing the shoe, it made Han Sen’s
      big foot look a bit delicate.
    </p>
    <p>Even weirder, the shoe was made of crystal, and so was the heel.</p>
    <p>
      “Please trust me, this is not my shoe. I’m not Cinderella. Why I am even
      wearing this?” Han Sen asked while lifting his foot, trying to get the
      shoe off.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the shoe seemed to be attached to his foot, and it was impervious
      to Han Sen’s attempts to pull it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you still trying to deny that this is your shoe? If it’s not your
      shoe, why does it fit your foot so well? Don’t deny it anymore,
      Cinderella. Go back and marry your prince”, said Jing Jiwu.
    </p>
    <p>
      “F*ck Cinderella. Even if I am a character in the fairy tale, I’m the
      prince.” Han Sen took out his Split-Knife and stabbed the crystal shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed by a sharp sound, the Split-Knife bounced up, and there wasn’t
      even a white scar on the crystal heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was shocked after seeing that. Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu had both
      seen Han Sen kill Blood Bone Demon with his Split-Knife, and it was a
      blade that could easily cut a super creature in half.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it didn’t leave even a mark on the shoe. It was shocking, and Lin
      Feng and the others were now worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is your foot? Does anything feel wrong?” Lin Feng asked, staring at
      the crystal heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I feel wrong everywhere now” , said Han Sen, bummed. He wasn’t actually
      hurt, but he was indeed deeply upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal heel was on his left foot, but the foot felt fine. He didn’t
      even feel like he was wearing a shoe; otherwise, he would’ve noticed the
      shoe before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought of it, and he missed a heartbeat. He then said, “Was this
      crystal shoe the thing that was dragging me down while I was in the
      water?”
