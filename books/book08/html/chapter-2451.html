<h2>First-Person Perspective</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2451</h3>

<p>Taking out the Wanjie Rubix Cube, he used it in accordance with
the instructions given to him by Fang Qing Yu. He made contact with
Fang Qing Yu’s step-father and streamed the video over to him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Treasure Identifier Elder, Mister Qing Yu’s signal is off. What
do we do? The video we have is about to run out, and every station
is waiting for more. If there is no more content, we won’t earn a
penny. Our money will be gone, and we will have to pay fines for
breaking the contract.” Cold sweat was gathering on Kevin’s
forehead. Looking like an ant being held over boiling water, he
looked over to the Treasure Identifier Elder.</p>
<p>This plan was secret. They couldn’t reveal the content. They
signed a contract with different media platforms of the various
high races, purchasing air time for their video footage.</p>
<p>Those media sources had rigid requirements for the content they
put out, however. If the Thousand Treasures group couldn’t put out
the content in time, they were going to lose money.</p>
<p>The Treasure Identifier Elder’s phone was ringing constantly.
There was no need for him to look at it, because he already knew
that it was his business partners that were calling.</p>
<p>The plan had failed. He would lose his savings, which was an
acceptable loss, but there were many other people that were going
to go bankrupt with him. And that wasn’t even what he was worried
about the most.</p>
<p>“Qing Yu must know how important it is to keep the video
running, but the communication has come to an end. Is he…” The
Treasure Identifier Elder’s face was shifting through a variety of
emotions.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Wanjie Rubix Cube lit up. A new video was being
streamed from Fang Qing Yu’s Rubix cube.</p>
<p>“There he is, and there’s the fight! Quick! Record all of this
footage and get it processed immediately…” Kevin was so excited
that he was screaming the instructions.</p>
<p>“This video is… How is he filming from that perspective?” The
Treasure Identifier Elder stared at the video with wide eyes.</p>
<p>The video showed the fight with the demon spirit, but it seemed
to be filmed from a first-person perspective. It was like the
person filming was the same person who was fighting the demon
spirit. Every detail was crystal clear.</p>
<p>Normal people couldn’t have made any sense of the raw footage;
to them, it would only have looked like blurring shapes and
blinding flashes of light.</p>
<p>The video stream of the Wanjie Rubix Cube was recorded by
special equipment, and the Thousand Treasures team edited it
carefully before releasing it through their media sources. They
slowed it down by an order of magnitude; otherwise, most people
wouldn’t have had any idea what was going on. Only someone like the
Treasure Identifier Elder himself could watch the raw footage and
understand what was actually happening.</p>
<p>“That Han Sen has bad luck! He hid inside the Tianxia System and
kidnapped a few people to pull his boat. Then, he met a guy with a
Wanjie Rubix Cube. Now, the Extreme King know where he is, and he
won’t be able to escape.”</p>
<p>“Huh, they ran into a group of cloud beasts… Why did the video
shut off?”</p>
<p>“It’s back now! What the hell? The Extreme King are fighting the
cloud beasts… Holy shit! That’s the Sea Demon Car! The Sea Demon
Car is opening…”</p>
<p>“Oh, d*mn… Why is it gone?”</p>
<p>All the media channels were playing the videos the Treasure
Identifier Elder was producing, all at the same time. The display
drew the attention of many viewers.</p>
<p>Because equipment inside the Tianxia System was usually affected
by the magnetic storms, most films that came from the system were
basically unwatchable. Capturing the Sea Demon Car on film would be
even more difficult. Every race was drawn by this new showcase, and
viewership figures skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Many different races populated the geno universe, and most races
had at least a billion members. Some of the bigger races had tens
of billions. The viewership figures ascended to a frightening sum
in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>But the moment that the Sea Demon Car opened, the video went
dark. All of the viewers watching became furious at the tease, and
it made them want to smash their viewing devices.</p>
<p>Because the video had been cut-off before, though, they hoped it
would come back and they could continue to watch.</p>
<p>But then, some words appeared on the blank screen. “This content
is now only accessible on a paid channel. Please enter the paid
channel to view the secrets of the Sea Demon Car and the fate of
the Extreme King. This is being streamed live from a massive battle
in the Tianxia System. And this program is brought to you by the
Hammer… Use the xenogeneic treasures of the Hammer to live a good
life.”</p>
<p>“Motherf*cking Hammer!”</p>
<p>“Those money-hungry b*stards…”</p>
<p>Everyone across the geno universe was upset about being baited
into purchasing a paid channel, but still, many nobles accepted it.
They paid to watch the video and immediately switched to the new
channel. They didn’t want to miss a single second of the
action.</p>
<p>This was the first time the Sea Demon Car had been shown in such
clarity and detail. Many people would have spent vast amounts of
money for any scrap of information they could find on the elusive
xenogeneic, but now they only had to spend a small amount for an
entire video focused on the creature.</p>
<p>It was worth it. It was way too worth it. Real elites couldn’t
care less about the cost of a single inexpensive video.</p>
<p>Even ordinary people could afford to watch. The paid channel
cost about as much as a pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p>When they entered the paid mode, they saw the demon spirit exit
the Sea Demon Car. Then the creature blew up the black beetle ship
and engaged Bao Qin directly.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! The demon spirit is strong.”</p>
<p>“Overwhelming. It is scary!”</p>
<p>“So that’s what the creature inside the Sea Demon Car looks
like. It isn’t very physically large, but it’s still quite scary to
watch.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s going on? This perspective makes it look like
someone is filming and fighting the demon spirit at the same time.
Is Bao Qin filming this?”</p>
<p>“It must be Bao Qin. Who else could film from such a
perspective?”</p>
<p>“Are the Extreme King in some sort of economic crisis? He is a
deified elite of the Extreme King, and he needs to earn money by
streaming? And he added some motherf*cking sponsor and advert. How
desperately do they want to earn money?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that! It isn’t easy to become a deified elite. While
they are strong, they still require resources.”</p>
<p>Conversations about the video raged everywhere, and most people
seemed to be complaining about Bao Qin’s behavior. The Extreme King
themselves were quite shocked, and they weren’t sure about what was
going on, either. They didn’t know why Bao Qin would stream this
video of a battle and allow the media of all the different races to
broadcast it.</p>
<p>A first-person perspective fight was incredibly exciting for
viewers. Their blood boiled as they watched. This was a deified
fight, which wasn’t something that usually allowed spectators.</p>
<p>If they had been anywhere near this fight in real life, they
would have run away. They wouldn’t have the guts to stay and watch
two godly beings fight. And even if they were ballsy enough to stay
and watch, they wouldn’t have been able to see much anyway.</p>
<p>These videos had been edited by professionals, allowing ordinary
people to understand what was going on. It also let them see just
how powerful deified beings could be.</p>
<p>Han Sen was watching the fight through Bao Qin’s eyes. And to
him, it looked even crazier.</p>
<p>The demon spirit was like dust on the wind. Its body was very
light, and even Bao Qin’s eyes and speed could barely keep track of
the xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Bao Qin struck repeatedly, but he only hit the places where the
demon spirit had just been.</p>
<p>If not for the harp in Bao Qin’s hand, he would have already
been killed by the demon spirit’s fist. Luckily for him, his harp
was able to weaken the demon spirit’s speed and power.</p>
