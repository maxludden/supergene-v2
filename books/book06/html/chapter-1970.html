<p>Yun Suyi stopped practicing and opened her eyes. The Jade Air
was no longer coming from the walls, so she looked around to see if
Han Sen was around. He wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Why hasn’t Brother Crane brought Han Sen down? Are they on the
fourth floor, maybe?” Yun Suyi wondered as she made her way up to
the fourth floor.</p>
<p>There was no sign of Han Sen on the fourth floor. Yun Suyi
frowned and turned back toward the stairs, intending to search the
fifth floor next. But Han Sen, Thousand Feather Crane, Yun Sushang,
and First Day were coming down from there.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi quickly moved towards them, glaring at Han Sen, “I told
you to come down when I left, but you were too stubborn. Great.
Now, Brother Crane and First Day have had to waste their time
bringing you down. The Jade Air is only released once a week.
You’ll have to wait another seven days now.”</p>
<p>Yun Sushang tugged at Yun Suyi and said, “Suyi, it’s not like
that.”</p>
<p>“What is not like that?” Yun Suyi asked with obvious
confusion.</p>
<p>First Day said, “Mister Han leveled up to Earl on the seventh
floor. We have come down together, now that the Jade Air has come
to an end.”</p>
<p>When Yu Suyi heard that, her eyes widened. She looked at Han Sen
with utter disbelief. “You really stayed on the seventh floor and
became an Earl?”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He wasn’t going to hide his power.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi sensed Han Sen’s energy. She was at a loss, and while
she opened her mouth, she didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>It was unheard of for a Viscount to withstand the Jade Air of
the seventh floor and become an Earl. It beggared belief.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We can talk more later.” Thousand Feather Crane led
the way out of the White Jade Building.</p>
<p>White Jade Building would erupt twice in a day, and then it
would go dormant for another six days. Han Sen broke through with
The Story of Genes on the first day, so he didn’t care about
anything else. He hadn’t discovered the secret of the White Jade
Building, but he would fine to wait until the following week.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just happy that he had gotten Spell to Earl
class.</p>
<p>When they said goodbye, Yun Sushang stopped Han Sen and said,
“Han Sen, Brother Crane and I are going to Xuanyuan Cave in two
days. If you have the time, you can come along.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t oppose my participation, I would like to come,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>They set up a time to meet, and then Thousand Feather Crane gave
Han Sen a ride back to his floating island.</p>
<p>“In Sky Palace, it would be ideal to obtain a flying mount. It
would be much more convenient for you, even if you cannot fly
yourself,” Thousand Feather Crane said as he took Han Sen back.</p>
<p>“Where do I find a flying mount? Can I buy one outside Sky
Palace?” Han Sen thought that if they would let him bring in a
xenogeneic, he could summon Little Star.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane shook his head. “No creature from the
outside can enter here, but we have a xenogeneic island to grow
them. You can buy a flying mount from there. If it is merely for
traveling, even a Baron class will do. It won’t cost much, but it
would be better if you invested in one that was Viscount.”</p>
<p>Han Sen asked for the location of that xenogeneic island, and
then Thousand Feather Crane left.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to his room and summoned Spell, who had just
leveled up. He wanted to see how she had changed.</p>
<p>Spell appeared in her womanly form. She flew into Han Sen’s hand
and became a white sniper rifle.</p>
<p>When Han Sen used his mind, the white sniper changed. It became
a white-metal weapon that looked like a rocket launcher.</p>
<p>“Damn! It has a fourth stage. Each one is better than the last.”
Han Sen was so happy.</p>
<p>But Han Sen could not test out its power in the stone house, so
he put it away. He cast a spirit light and created a spell that had
power in it.</p>
<p>“I’ll find a place to try the rocket launcher later. What does
this spell power do?” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>After resting for some time, Han Sen planned on going to review
the rules of Sky Palace. He didn’t want to unwittingly break a
rule.</p>
<p>He had no flying mount, so he used his own power to soar.
Fortunately, he was Earl class. Spell’s power was very strong as a
result, and it was enough to carry Han Sen to the floating island
that possessed the tablet.</p>
<p>Han Sen read the rules and tried to memorize them.</p>
<p>Wherever he went, knowing the rules was always important to him.
Knowing the rules meant he could behave. And when he met new
people, he wouldn’t be seen as an enemy. Knowing the rules
sometimes meant he could receive unexpected help.</p>
<p>There were many rules in Sky Palace. Although Han Sen could
remember them all, he still took his time to memorize each one.</p>
<p>He looked around a little, and then, a xenogeneic that looked
like a tiger landed in front of Han Sen. Yun Suyi was on its back,
and she jumped down before him.</p>
<p>“Suyi, are you here to read the rules?” Han Sen asked her.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi smiled and said, “I was born in Sky Palace, and I have
read the rules many times. Still, I get punished. I could recite
each one with my eyes closed, so there’s no need for me to read
this thing.”</p>
<p>That means you have come looking for me?” Han Sen looked around.
There was no one else there except for him.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi nodded and said, “My sister knows you do not have a
flying mount, so I am taking you to buy one. The Yun family is good
at growing xenogeneics, and so we have a shop on the xenogeneic
island. I can give you a discount.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Yun Suyi seemed to be rather excited.</p>
<p>“Please wait a little while; I haven’t finished the rules yet.”
Han Sen went back to reading the rules scrawled upon the
tablet.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi waited, noticing how carefully Han Sen was reading
them.</p>
<p>“Is he for real? I am waiting right here, and he’s still
concentrating entirely on reading the tablet?” Yun Suyi waited for
a while, and Han Sen continued to read. She felt depressed.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of the Tenth Elder. Many men wished to get
close to her, but Han Sen was ignoring her, and paying attention to
stupid rules instead. He was so focused, it was like he was reading
through a powerful geno art.</p>
<p>If Yun Sushang hadn’t asked her to be nice, Yun Suyi would have
left already.</p>
<p>A while later, Han Sen finished reading. Then, Yun Suyi jumped
atop the flying tiger. She smiled at Han Sen. “I am taking you to
the xenogeneic island now. You should follow!”</p>
<p>After that, Yun Suyi patted the tiger. Then, the tiger spread
its wings and flew into the clouds. It was very fast.</p>
<p>“I waited so long for you, so now you can suffer a little,” Yun
Suyi thought with a grin. She’d purposefully left before Han Sen
could get on the mount.</p>
