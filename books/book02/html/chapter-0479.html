    <p>
      Because of the huge accident during the exploration of this Crystallizer
      ruin, Daphne was asked to go back immediately. It was yet to be determined
      whether they would be punished.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the two advanced crystals that Han Sen brought back were
      submitted to the Alliance by Ji Yanran, which excused her from potential
      sanction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being a cookhouse soldier, Han Sen was too unimportant to be liable, so he
      was fine as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Corn, come over here.&#8221; Sitting in his bed, Han Sen was
      reading a book when he found the uniform beetle was fighting it out with a
      table leg, trying to knock it over with its horn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, it was so weak that it could not shake the table at all.
      Han Sen exclaimed at it, but the unicorn beetle did not understand him,
      still working hard to fight the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come back!&#8221; Although Han Sen knew the unicorn beetle could
      not understand him, he was too lazy to get out of bed, so he shouted at
      the beetle again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unicorn beetle did not mind him. However, its body was suddenly
      captured by something and started to float toward Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah!&#8221; Han Sen looked at the unicorn beetle in surprise. As he
      changed his thoughts, the unicorn beetle suddenly lost the support and
      fell from the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was completely shocked. He tried to focus his mind again on the
      unicorn beetle, and very soon, it floated again, flying wobbly toward him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen caught the unicorn beetle with his hand and felt overjoyed. Then
      he tried to focus his attention on other smaller objects like cups.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, it turned out he could move some smaller objects with his mind. He
      could make a cup within a range of about 6 feet float. If the object was
      more far away, it would be beyond his power. Also, he could not lift
      anything heavy with his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Han Sen was very excited. Later, however, he discovered that
      this ability was almost useless. The distance requirement was stringent,
      and the actual force he could use was too weak. It was almost impossible
      to be used in a fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The red crystal seemed to have given my brain some revolutionary
      development. Now I could even use my mind to move things. However, it is
      still so weak that it is not very useful.&#8221; Han Sen soon lost
      interest in his newly gained ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, another benefit that the red crystal brought him made Han Sen
      jump with joy. When Han Sen started to learn the ancient language again
      after he came back, he found his memory and understanding much better and
      his progress much faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of the accident in the last mission, everyone on Daphne was
      forbidden to enter God&#8217;s Sanctuary or use the Skynet. Han Sen had to
      learn the ancient language all the time. Because his brain had been
      enhanced, he had made tremendous progress in understanding the ancient
      language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he was still unable to understand the majority of Dongxuan Sutra,
      Han Sen now understood a part that was easier to read.
    </p>

    <p>
      This part was a technique that represented a kind of footwork. Simply by
      going forward, backward, left, right, and sideways, one could produce
      endless interesting combinations. It showed how the Tao produced one; one
      produced two; two produced three; and three produced all things.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, from Han Sen&#8217;s perspective, this technique written in
      Dongxuan Sutra was somewhat similar to the kiting skills of Queen. Han Sen
      only learned some superficial techniques from Queen and did not learn it
      systematically. However, after reading this part in Dongxuan Sutra, Han
      Sen was thrilled because he had some epiphanies that he had never imagined
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more he read, the more fascinating he found Dongxuan Sutra. Only such
      a small technique represented plenty knowledge, which made Han Sen look
      forward to reading the main part of the Dongxuan Sutra even more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had more and more notes as he read. However, it was a bit boring
      for him to practice alone. Han Sen decided to fight someone else to test
      whether what he was thinking was correct.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because of the ban on Daphne, there was no way he could use the
      Skynet. Naturally, he could not login to the Gladiator platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was, however, another way. Han Sen used the holographic trainer to
      connect to the virtual camp of the military, which allowed him to spar
      with other soldiers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not bother to think of other names and still used the ID name
      A Soldier on Warship in the virtual camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen&#8217;s rank was major, he was still a newbie in the
      virtual camp and had to gain experience from fighting to upgrade.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen chose a random match and was soon matched with a captain.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen checked his opponent out and found it was a tall woman who had
      used the face blur function. Her ID was Ms. Perfume.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same time, in the teleport station of Planet Roca, Qin Xuan was
      also using the holographic trainer to login to the virtual camp, and her
      ID name was Ms. Perfume.
    </p>

    <p>
      Checking the ID name of her opponent, Qin Xuan was surprised because the
      name became quite famous among soldiers after the video of Seven Kill was
      released.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, she looked at the record of her opponent and found he was a
      newbie with no win and no loss, so she thought the name should just be a
      coincidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not imagine that he would be matched with Qin Xuan, and Qin
      Xuan would never expect to be paired with Han Sen. The two old friends
      went into the contest without knowing anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan had great luck, at least much better than Han Sen. After she
      evolved to Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, she was randomly assigned to a
      large shelter that had already been occupied by humans. There were
      millions of humans in the shelter, among which many were strong evolvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were also lots of people working for the special squad, with many
      talents as well. After Qin Xuan arrived, she gained a large supply of meat
      and had already filled her ordinary, primitive, and mutant geno points.
      With some sacred geno points gained, she had managed to break a hundred in
      fitness after two years, definitely one of the top evolvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that her opponent was just a newbie, Qin Xuan did not pay much
      attention to him. She thought she should be able to finish up pretty fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after the fight began, it was completely unexpected for her. She
      turned from calm to angry to sullen, almost crying in the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan was someone who had seen great talents of various types. However,
      it was the first time she had encountered such an opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Soldier on Warship did not attack at all, dodging her attacks all the
      time. However, when she had used all she got, she still failed to hit her
      opponent. In addition, to her dismay, she was forced into a dead-end by
      her opponent without her noticing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously, her opponent could have ended the fight with one move, but he
      did not choose to do that. His toying with her was simply an insult to Qin
      Xuan.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You will regret this.&#8221; Qin Xuan bit her lips, upset. She then
      used Atomic Fission and the hyper geno art called Thunder Knife that she
      had newly learned as an evolver.
