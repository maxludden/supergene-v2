	<p>“Dad!” Bao’er saw Han Sen and immediately ran up to him.</p>

	<p>“Bao’er, let’s go.” Han Sen picked up Bao’er and readied himself to leave Burning Red Sky. Before they could
		leave, many space tunnels opened in Burning Red Sky. They looked similar to black holes. Many scary creatures
		were coming through the black holes.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, we meet again.” A weird voice sounded. Han Sen saw Shoot Shadow of the God Chaos Party emerge from a
		black hole. The people accompanying him a few of God Chaos Party’s elders. One of them was Rocky Dee, with whom
		Han Sen was already quite familiar.</p>

	<p>Han Sen ignored Shoot Shadow’s presence. He grabbed Bao’er and used his identity as the Burning Red Sky’s leader
		to leave Burning Red Sky. He soon heard a scary beast make a roaring noise. The whole of Burning Red Sky started
		to shake and shiver. Space seemed all wrong. Han Sen was unable to leave Burning Red Sky. A Break World beast
		that looked like a real dragon entered the place from a warp in space. Wherever it went, space was twisted. Its
		giant body appeared in Burning Red Sky. Its presence affected the entire space of Burning Red Sky, trapping it
		and everything else in there.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, you should just die. You have been able to prompt the whole God Chaos Party to send out this many
		elites, so be proud. Your death will be a noble one.” Shoot Shadow looked at Han Sen with an expression of pride
		smearing his face.</p>

	<p>“I might not be the one that ends up dead,” Han Sen said while putting Bao’er down.</p>

	<p>“If it isn’t you, are you suggesting it will be me?” Shoot Shadow laughed as if it was a funny joke.</p>

	<p>“Yes, it will be you.” Shoot Shadow had only just finished speaking when he heard a cold sound come from behind.
	</p>

	<p>Shoot Shadow obviously wanted to turn around and see who it was, but a paper knife came swinging down. His vision
		started to roll as his head flew into the sky. His dead face had an expression of disbelief.</p>

	<p>The other God Chaos Party elders looked shocked. They saw Rocky Dee murder Shoot Shadow.</p>

	<p>“Mister, allow me to handle this. Han Sen, you take the master ahead and leave first.” Rocky Dee put his right
		hand against his chest as he bowed before Han Sen. He then turned around and faced all the creatures with his
		paper knife.</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew Rocky Dee was not bowing to him. It was the black crystal armor he had on. He was bowing to the
		leader of the God Chaos Party.</p>

	<p>He knew Rocky Dee would probably end up dead, but Han Sen was in a weakened condition. Even if he fought
		alongside Rocky Dee, he would probably end up dying with him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He picked up Bao’er and used the last of his power to break space and leave.</p>

	<p>The scary Break World beast that looked like a real dragon roared. It was trying to consume Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Almost at the same time, many Break World beasts rushed there too.</p>

	<p>Rocky Dee’s eyes looked cold. His hands opened. Paper appeared like snowflakes. His 10 fingers became pairs of
		scissors. They crossed each other. The paper looked like a blizzard as he made loads many silhouettes.</p>

	<p>The silhouettes turned into many scary creatures that could battle with the Break World beasts. They blocked most
		of the advancing Break World beasts.</p>

	<p>A God Chaos Party elder coldly questioned Rocky Dee. “Rocky Dee, how dare you become an enemy of the leader! Do
		you even know what you are doing?”</p>

	<p>Rocky Dee’s lips were crooked at a very disdainful angle. In his eyes, there was only one leader for the God
		Chaos Party—Chaos.</p>

	<p>After that, Rocky Dee swung his paper knife and went straight to the Break World beasts that were rushing in like
		a mad tide.</p>

	<p>“If you want to die, I cannot help you.” The God Chaos Party elder looked cold as he waved his hands. Many more
		Break World beasts came charging at Rocky Dee.</p>

	<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He did not look at the fight that was behind him. Even though he did not look back, he
		could imagine what it looked like.</p>

	<p>“Out of the way!” Han Sen gathered the last of his strength to throw a punch at the real dragon-looking Break
		World beast. With the skills of his Super Spank, a powerful power broke the Break World beast’s massive body.
		His punch punctured the fiend and created a big and bloody hole in its chest.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used that impact crater to cut through the Break World beast’s body and escape the 33 skies.</p>

	<p>Sky King was helping Qin Xiu, who was a son of the 33 skies. The 33 skies were no longer a safe place for Han Sen
		to be in. He would only be able to survive if he got out of the 33 skies.</p>

	<p>Before Han Sen was able to get out of Burning Red Sky, a body suddenly blocked his way.</p>

	<p>“I am one of the four kings of the God Chaos Party, Itchy! I will be taking your life.” The shadow came before
		him. Time felt as if it stopped before that man.</p>

	<p>Han Sen shockingly noticed his body seemed to be moving despite nothing around him changing. It was like all of
		space was frozen around him.</p>

	<p>The voice of Chaos started to speak in Han Sen’s mind. “That is a time element Break World creature. Its Break
		World rate is almost 100%. Only by using a geno prototype armor can you make a Break World creature like that.”
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt glum. His power was almost all drained. He did not have the juice needed to deal with a top-class
		Break World beast.</p>

	<p>“Time is like my needle,” Itchy coldly said. “Thousands of years of time reside in my fingers. Your time in
		existence will be erased by my hands. You will vanish from the river of time.”</p>

	<p>He waved his fingers.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt as if time around him was freezing. It was as if he had fallen into a place where time did not
		advance, and everything remained still.</p>

	<p>Suddenly, Han Sen felt space become lively again. Things started to move.</p>

	<p>“What is going on?” Han Sen was shocked. He suddenly heard a voice.</p>

	<p>“Do you want to play with time? You are very far from being able to! Before me, no one else can control time!” A
		long shadow appeared out of the river of time.</p>

	<p>It seemed very slow, but it was very fast. The shadow walked past Han Sen. Wherever she went, the frozen time
		returned to its ordinary flow. It was like a river of ice was being melted.</p>

	<p>“Moment God!” Han Sen looked at the proud shadow. He was shocked.</p>

	<p>This Moment God was not the one in the God of Wealth Temple. This was the Moment God that was one of the 12
		Annihilation-class God Spirits. Han Sen would have never guessed that Moment God would show up now, seemingly
		with a desire to aid him.</p>

	<p>“What are you looking at? Do you want me to throw you into an endless time loop?” Moment God did not look back or
		look at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>“Thank you.” Han Sen did not know why Moment God had shown up to help him, but now was not the time to talk. He
		picked Bao’er up and left.</p>

	<p>“Stop!” Itchy looked dim. He wanted to stop Han Sen. When he moved, Moment God stopped him.</p>

	<p>“Do not die yet,” Moment God said. “I am the one that is supposed to kill you.”</p>
