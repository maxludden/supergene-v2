<p>Han Sen was shocked. He looked at his hand. It had a purple
light shining on it. A small, purple flower revealed itself.</p>
<p>“It is the Otherside Flower.” Han Sen looked at the little
purple flower. It had 13 petals. There were no more and no less.
This was the small, purple flower Han Sen had seen before.</p>
<p>As Han Sen wondered why the Otherside Flower was appearing on
his hand, he saw one of the thirteen petals fall off. It floated
onto Wan’er’s forehead. It was like a spring sun that was melting
the snow. It slowly melted into her forehead.</p>
<p>A moment later, the petal melted. Wan’er’s forehead was covered
with a purple, misty light.</p>
<p>As this occurred, the Otherside Flower that was on Han Sen’s
hand vanished. It was like it had melted into his hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart was rattled. He looked at the purple, misty
light covering Qin Wan’er. Her eyes moved a little. It looked as if
she was going to wake up.</p>
<p>When the purple, misty light grew dimmer, Qin Wan’er’s blonde
hair turned black. She suddenly became the black-haired Wan’er Han
Sen used to know.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Qin Wan’er opened her eyes, which were black. They were
clear and full of life. They were like black gems without any
dirt.</p>
<p>“Big Brother!” Qin Wan’er looked at Han Sen. She looked to be in
shock. She sat up and opened her arms to jump at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was confused. Wan’er previously mistook him for a big
brother because Qin Xiu’s black crystal armor was inside his Sea of
Soul.</p>
<p>Now, the black crystal armor was gone. Why would Wan’er still be
calling him her big brother?</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>Wan’er was unable to touch Han Sen’s body. Her hands went right
through him. She fell on the floor.</p>
<p>“Big Brother, what happened to you?” Qin Wan’er dragged herself
off the floor. She tried to grab Han Sen’s body many times, but she
was unable to. Every time she tried, her grasp went right through
him.</p>
<p>“It looks like Qin Wan’er is similar to Bao’er. They can see me,
but they cannot touch me.” Han Sen sighed. He looked at Qin Wan’er
and asked, “You know that I am not your big brother, right?”</p>
<p>Qin Wan’er was shocked by his words. She nodded, but then shook
her head. “I know you are not Brother Qin Xiu, but I still think
you are already my big brother.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart felt warm. He wanted to touch Qin Wan’er’s hair,
but his hands kept going through her.</p>
<p>“I can accept you as my little sister.” Han Sen withdrew his
hand and presented a warm smile.</p>
<p>“Great, but what is wrong with you, Big Brother?” Qin Wan’er
still wanted to reach her hands out and touch Han Sen, but she was
unable to feel any part of him.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. My body has a small problem. That’s all.
Everything will be fine soon.” Han Sen did not want to say too much
about it. He casually asked, “Do you know where Qin Xiu went?”</p>
<p>Qin Wan’er shook her head. “I remember Qin Xiu brought me here,
and then I fell asleep. After I opened my eyes, I saw you.”</p>
<p>“It was worth keeping you with me for so long.” Han Sen felt
better after hearing all of that. When Qin Wan’er referred to Qin
Xiu, she referred to him by his name, Qin Xiu. Whenever she
referred to Han Sen, she referred to him as a big brother. It made
them sound closer.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Qin Wan’er. It was unknown what was happening
to her. It was unknown how many memories she had.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched her look at him. Qin Wan’er seemed to understand
something. She lowered her head and said, “I am Wan’er of the
Witch. I am the Wan’er from the Qin Kingdom. Will that make you
hate me?”</p>
<p>“Why would I hate you? For as long as you think of me as a big
brother, I will be your big brother forever.” Han Sen fondly looked
at Wan’er. He patted his chest to double-down on certifying his
words.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew this all looked and sounded a bit childish, but he
preferred to be childish than being blown to bits. He did not want
to think too much about this matter.</p>
<p>“Big Brother!” Wan’er was very happy. She reached out her hands
to keep trying to grab Han Sen’s neck, but she was unable to grab
anything.</p>
<p>“You should rest here. If there is a chance for me to take you
back, I will.” Han Sen was not exactly safe where he was. Even if
Wan’er could go along with him, he knew he shouldn’t take her away
right now. This was probably the safest place for her to be for
now.</p>
<p>“OK.” Wan’er politely nodded.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved his hands. He bid farewell to Wan’er and departed
the old tower.</p>
<p>Since Qin Xiu was not there, there was no reason for Han Sen to
stay in the tower. He wanted to see if he could travel through the
33 skies and reach the geno universe.</p>
<p>If Wan’er was able to see him, perhaps Ling’er and Littleflower
would be able to see him too. He really wanted to go and see his
son and daughter.</p>
<p>From ancient times, no one had ever been as strong as Han Sen or
able to travel through the 33 skies. Even God Spirits with a spirit
body required a god temple and geno hall power to reach the geno
universe.</p>
<p>The 33 skies was a really odd place. It had many incredible and
mysterious places. Even Han Sen was surprised by what he saw there.
Fortunately, his spirit body did not have to touch a single speck
of dust. No form of power was able to repel or keep him down. If
that wasn’t the case, even if he was in peak physical condition,
Han Sen thought he would not have been able to make his way through
the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Some of the creatures that lived in the 33 skies gave Han Sen
goosebumps.</p>
<p>In one sky, Han Sen saw a type of ant. The ants were small like
ordinary ants. They had wings and flew so fast.</p>
<p>A group of these ants became like a black storm. Even if a Break
World gene race tried to run away from them, if they weren’t
careful, they’d be devoured in a short amount of time. Not even a
single bone would have remained.</p>
<p>The life form of the flying ants was very weird. Although they
were individual entities, in a group, they shared the same
presence. The more flying ants there were, the more powerful they
were.</p>
<p>In another sky, Han Sen saw a giant vine that went through the
ground. The giant vine had many gene races and Break World-class
existences occupying it. Those gene races were not very scary, but
the big vine was extremely terrifying. Even with the Break World
race gene races that lived on the stalk, the big vine was
shockingly powerful.</p>
<p>It was very a powerful existence. There were many such things in
the 33 skies. The higher Han Sen went, the scarier and weirder the
creatures became.</p>
<p>“Weird. Outer Sky is above the 33 skies. How can the 33 skies
have so many scary gene races, yet there are none in Outer Sky?” It
made Han Sen wonder if Outer Sky really was above the 33 skies.</p>
<p>“The 33 skies are quite scary. Not even Qin Xiu is able to punch
through them in a short amount of time. Now, I know a lot more
about the 33 skies. If I can recover my true body, perhaps I will
be able to beat Qin Xiu and become better than him.” Han Sen did
not want the 33 skies to break. That would be very bad for the geno
universe.</p>
<p>Compared to the creatures in the universe of kingdoms, the
creatures of the geno universe were like flowers in a greenhouse.
They were trapped in the greenhouse to grow, unable to experience
storms. There were not many Break World elites there.</p>
<p>“This is the last sky.” Han Sen looked into the sky. A spirit
light was flying up. Han Sen entered the last layer of the 33
skies.</p>
