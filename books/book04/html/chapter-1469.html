      “What’s going on? You and I both have a silver geno core?” Han Sen looked
      at the green-clothed woman with surprise. This geno core storage looked
      very different.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you, this geno core storage has received some modifications. We’re
      in a different sort of Geno Battleground, and in here, any and all geno
      core levels can gather. Your silver geno core will be brutally murdered
      here, though.” The woman slightly raised her lips.
    </p>
    <p>“What is your geno core’s level?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
    <p>
      “Mine is gemstone. I only need a little bit more juice to level it up to
      super.” The woman sounded cocky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was able to predict this state of affairs, though. Her fitness was
      similar to his, so it was very likely she had a gemstone geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not step out of the teleporter, though. He wanted to go back
      with his umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had finished the task of waking up the holy child, so Gu Qingcheng had
      no reason to want him dead. If he returned and spoke to her, perhaps he’d
      be allowed to leave Elysium Shelter now. If she really wasn’t going to let
      him, he’d come right back.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen noticed the teleporter wasn’t doing anything. It was like it
      had been broken, refusing to send him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t waste your time. You can’t get out unless you find the Geno Core
      Tablet. Unfortunately, the Geno Core Tablet is near a dangerous place.
      Many elites like camping there, so they can kill any who try to leave,”
      the woman said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>“That’s bothersome.” Han Sen frowned.</p>
    <p>
      The woman smiled. “Now do you regret not listening to me, when I told you
      it was time for us to run?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen laughed, looked right at her, and said, “Well, now that we’re
      partners, for the time being, how about you tell me your name? I can’t
      keep calling you, you, you, you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pah! Who would think of partnering up with such a wimp? If your geno core
      wasn’t such a low level, I’d just kill you and take it for myself. It’s
      not even worth the effort,” the green-clothed woman said, then kept
      walking.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen didn’t take offense, so he just followed after her.</p>
    <p>
      If she truly wanted Han Sen dead, he wagered she wouldn’t have exited the
      stone right as Ghost Moon was about to kill him. It also took a while for
      Han Sen to teleport in. She had obviously waited, and if she cared that
      little about him, she could’ve been long gone by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Even if we’re not partners, I should still know your name. It’s horrible
      to keep calling you, you, you.” Han Sen stopped by her side and turned
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>“Elysian Moon,” the woman said with a wintry tone.</p>
    <p>
      “Elysian Moon? That’s a very good name. It’s as bright as the
      black-perched comfort the moon provides.” Han Sen smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green-clothed woman just stared at him. “It’s Elysian. It still bears
      an association to the Elysium.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Elysian Moon. Elysian Moon.” Han Sen said it twice. “That sounds similar
      to Ghost Moon.”
    </p>
    <p>“She copied my name, but we’re nothing alike.” Elysian Moon smirked.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen continued following her. It sounded as if she didn’t like Han Sen,
      but she still seemed content to walk alongside him. She was a very
      different person now, not like the quiet person who originally inhabited
      the painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continued to speak as they walked, but Elysian Moon spent the entire
      time mocking Han Sen. Repeatedly, he had to just laugh it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed over a mountain, then stopped, looking at each other. Elysian
      Moon turned to look over a nearby valley. “Come on out! If you wish to
      kill us, cowardly assassination from the shadows is a bad idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As her voice echoed back out of the valley, the heavy sound of footsteps
      followed it out, bouncing off the gulches of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw a minotaur, decked out in heavy armor. It had a ruby spear, and
      its eyes were red, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a Geno Battle Soul,” Elysian Moon said, finger pointing at the
      minotaur.
    </p>
    <p>“What is a Geno Battle Soul?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “The creatures that occupy the Geno Battleground count as geno cores
      themselves. Killing them will strengthen your own.” Elysian Moon paused.
      “But Geno Battle Souls are rare, and they’re always at least gold level.
      This one, however, looks gemstone class. Killing it is sure to increase my
      geno core.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon swung her umbrella and rushed forward to engage the minotaur.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The umbrella and the spear collided against one-another, instigating a
      fearsome mixture of terrifying power that generated shockwaves. The
      impacts tore apart the ground, leaving them fighting in a deep crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next second, Elysian Moon opened her umbrella. As it spun in her
      hands, a phantom force of suction began to pull the minotaur towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minotaur tried to resist and pull itself away, but it was unable to
      get free. It was vacuumed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the minotaur was sucked inside, she stopped spinning her umbrella.
      Han Sen saw the umbrella, and on it, he now saw the picture of a heavy
      armor-clad minotaur. It looked disturbingly alive.
    </p>
    <p>No. It really was alive.</p>
    <p>
      “So powerful. If she used that ability when we last fought, perhaps I
      could have suffered the same fate as the minotaur.” Han Sen was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s heart sank, and he again thought to himself, “It is an umbrella
      geno core, but why can mine only offer protection? I hope it has developed
      some new abilities, now that it has reached silver.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at his umbrella, which was now a silver core. There didn’t
      seem to be any changes, and its color was still standard black.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen eyed the geno core, more footsteps began to resonate from the
      valley. It wasn’t just one minotaur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps were rapid, and it sounded as if there were thousands of the
      creatures. This was confirmed when they saw many more pouring out of the
      valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Didn’t you say Geno Battle Souls are rare? What do you call this?!” Han
      Sen’s face changed. No matter how strong he was, he couldn’t face an
      entire army of those minotaurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s just what I heard off another spirit.” Even Elysian Moon looked
      disheartened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen turned around and started to run. Elysian Moon followed, and she
      was just as quick as him. The minotaurs were all wielding ruby spears as
      they gave chase.
