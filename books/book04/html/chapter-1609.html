    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      Before Han Sen ran inside the glass palace, the crystal shoe on his foot
      slipped off and went flying forward of its own volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      From inside the glass palace, another shoe came out. It was the same type.
      Han Sen had been wearing a left-foot shoe, but the one he saw now was
      right-footed. They were a pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair of Crystal Shoes met each other at the gate. Together again, they
      began to dance. It was like an invisible dancer was wearing them, prancing
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Shoe had departed Han Sen’s foot now, though, which meant he
      was free. Without wasting a moment, he turned around and ran outside the
      shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more creatures were coming in now, freeing the elites to approach and
      prohibit his escape. Many elites were coming toward him. Even without
      Outer Sky King there, Han Sen was in a lot of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing all this, he was still able to remain calm. Negative thoughts
      weren’t going to help him out in such a situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like Han Sen’s swordmind, the more danger he was in, the more talents
      and opportunities were available for use. His desire to live would only be
      stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing all the elites approaching, Han Sen’s mind was very clear. He used
      Dongxuan Aura to watch their every step. Combining his Split-Blade with
      his movement and body, Han Sen began an incredible show.
    </p>
    <p>Fallen Slaughter unleashed tremendous power and used it methodically.</p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t just Han Sen’s own power, either. The elites of Outer Sky
      contributed to Han Sen’s power, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground was the board and everything else was the chess pieces upon it.
      That was where something like Heavenly Go could come into its own. He
      could use his own power and the power of others. Everything was a chess
      piece, and even the enemies could become his pawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dongxuan Sutra’s abilities made him a big cheater. He could see
      through the minds of the enemy and learn their thought-process to know how
      they would move.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong layout, combined with his ability to predict and the powers he
      obtained from transforming, in addition to his natural sword skills, put
      him into a weird mode of operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outer Sky Shelter had so many elites surrounding Han Sen, but he noticed
      they were all fighting individually. It wasn’t a cooperative effort on
      their part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their companions could not help each other, and sometimes they even got in
      each other’s way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao, however, did not participate in the fight, All she did was watch.
      Han Sen seemed like he was invisible, and she watched him rush amongst the
      elites who had no chance of stopping him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was like a real trickster demon. Everyone was getting played by
      him. The thoughts and emotions they displayed were just fuel for Han Sen
      to use. The army was nothing but sand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen swung his sword, utilizing his nightmarish body. To the Outer Sky
      elites, this was a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My King! Please kill the enemy.” Someone finally asked Outer Sky King to
      join the fray and kill Han Sen. There were so many of them, and yet they
      were unable to stop him themselves. It was only a matter of time before he
      escaped the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outer Sky King looked at Han Sen and wanted to fight, but he couldn’t find
      the opportunity to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t as if Han Sen’s sword skills were strong, though. All this was
      because every time he walked, he’d appear beside an elite. Outer Sky King
      couldn’t find the chance to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fall back!” Outer Sky King said with a deep voice. It was an admittance
      that Fallen Slaughter really was a powerful enemy. He wasn’t a reckless
      foe like he used to be. Outer Sky King could not even strike right now,
      lest he cut down one of his own people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outer Sky King had never found himself in a situation such as this before.
      He had faced many strong opponents in the past, but there had never been
      anything like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elites didn’t like falling back, but they respected Outer Sky King.
      They obeyed his command and retreated, each giving Han Sen an angry look.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many elites had been unable to take down one outsider, and they had all
      been fighting in a frenzy. It was humiliating.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everyone parted, Outer Sky King was given the chance to throw a fist.
      It felt like the dimension was concentrated, and the fist soon arrived
      directly before Han Sen’s face. His heart was calm, though, and at that
      moment, the fist was the whole world. Han Sen brought his Split-Blade up
      in a simple swing, without anything fancy about the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, it was like the sky itself had been sundered. The concentration
      of power was gone. Han Sen jumped into the air and landed outside the
      gate. Outer Sky King stumbled back half a step before recovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone in Outer Sky was shocked. They had never seen Outer Sky King be
      knocked back like that before. It was an unbelievable thing to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, something even more unbelievable happened outside of the gate.
      Fallen Slaughter’s body disappeared, and all that was left behind was the
      image of a human standing tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man standing there was Han Sen. His body could not remain transformed
      Fallen Slaughter forever. If he continued, his entire body would break, so
      he had to cancel it
    </p>
    <p>
      The elites of Outer Sky were in shock. It was a human that had been
      fighting Outer Sky King, and they couldn’t accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It really is Han Sen!” Yu Miao shouted. She thought it might have been,
      but she hadn’t allowed herself to fully believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The human she had not cared about could actually fight Outer Sky elites
      with ease, and he had managed to escape the shelter despite being wholly
      surrounded. He had made the entirety of Outer Sky look as if it was
      nothing. Not many people could do something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is the power of Outer Sky Shelter?” Han Sen laughed and flew into
      the sky. Then he disappeared. Only the echo of his laugh remained.
