    <p>
      The white tiger with six ears and Metal Demon looked ill. They preferred
      to share the shelter with a weak human than accept the cruel rulership of
      a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were confident in tackling the one that had first confronted
      them, they had not expected him to have backup on the way. Their presence
      there now scared them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What’s more, the reinforcements had entered the hall through its only
      exit. They had to fight, no matter what. Even if they sought to flee,
      they’d have to battle their way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll spare your lives if you subject yourselves to my will and accept me
      as your new master. And as for you…” The spirit turned his head to address
      Han Sen now, and he said, “Well, I can’t grant you the same generosity.
      Humans must die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re getting ahead of yourself, don’t you think? You’re already talking
      as if you own us.” Han Sen smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but your delicate, petty existence rests in the mighty palm of my
      hand.” The spirit drew his blue greatsword and pointed it at Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deal is unchanged. You two take on Tall and Small, and I’ll get the
      big cheese.” Han Sen issued a command and immediately cast a gold beam of
      light towards the advancing spirit.
    </p>
    <p>The blonde spirit swung his greatsword at the beam.</p>
    <p>
      Six-Ear and Metal Demon, still allied with Han Sen, did as ordered. They
      both went to engage the two spirits that had come to support their master.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not think Han Sen could beat the spirit, though. In fact, they
      were planning on fleeing. All they hoped was that Han Sen had what it took
      to occupy their primary enemy long enough so they could escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tall and Small both smiled, like ghastly twins. They swung their hammers
      with alarming ferocity, ruining the scape of the hall in their bids to
      make jelly out of the creatures that tried for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with each shockwave came a debilitating effect the creatures were
      unable to avoid or withstand. Like the momentarily disturbed surface of a
      gentle pond, a pulsing ring flowed out from each strike. When those
      shockwaves reached the creatures, their movements slowed and made them
      more susceptible to being hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures looked at Han Sen whenever they could, hoping he could
      continue keeping their enemy busy.
    </p>
    <p>But when they saw what he had done, they were in utter shock.</p>
    <p>
      The blonde spirit had been tied up by a golden cord, like a strung hunk of
      pork. With a horn he swiveled in-hand, he was casually approaching the
      spirit. Shortly after, that same horn was plunged deep into the blonde
      spirit’s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tall and Small caught a glimpse of what had just transpired in the short
      amount of time they had spent in combat, and they quickly suffered a pang
      of shock mixed with a dollop of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned around, wishing to run. Since they were no longer swinging
      their hammers to slow down their opponents, the two creatures were able to
      chase after and nip at their behinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen up, you primitive screwhead. Lesson number one: know who you’re
      dealing with before you start swinging that puny little sword of yours
      around,” Han Sen callously said, as he slowly and excruciatingly pushed
      the horn deeper into the blonde spirit’s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit was in too much pain to respond, and he died swiftly after. His
      entire body shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew it was not over yet, though. The spirit wasn’t completely
      dead, and there was a large chance he’d return as soon as he had mustered
      his courage back to try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the tiger and roboman creature, Han Sen did not go after them and
      the enemies they were hounding down. Instead, he immediately called for
      Moment Queen to claim the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, the place was rebooted and fully operational once more.
      There were still others in the shelter who had not vied for ownership, and
      they eagerly awaited learning who the new master would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the two creatures were unable to catch up with Tall and
      Small. They returned to the spirit hall shortly after, empty-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you hold up your end of the bargain?” Metal Demon asked Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they made the deal, they hadn’t realized Han Sen was strong enough to
      so easily slay the blonde spirit like he had. As such, they wanted to
      treat him with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course. The mine and the garden are yours, but you two are now
      responsible for the well-being of the shelter, as much as I,” Han Sen
      said.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen did not mind having two mutant class allies by his side.</p>
    <p>
      “Of course. And if the spirits dare show their face again, we’ll be here
      to fend them off.” The two creatures were incredibly happy, as they had
      become unsure whether or not Han Sen would stay true to the deal they had
      struck. If he did not, with the strength he possessed, there’d be little
      they could do to change his mind, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way Han Sen had killed that spirit made them almost afraid to interact
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then had a discussion on how best to proceed in controlling the
      shelter, and how it should be operated. The others in the courtyards were
      worried about what would become of them, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      They still did not know who the new master was, and most of them were
      leaning towards escape. If a powerful spirit had taken over, they could
      all kiss their freedom goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>The person with the most worry there, however, was another human.</p>
    <p>
      There was another demigod there, and his name was Su Mianhua. He was a
      professor of genetics in the Alliance. When he came to the Fourth God’s
      Sanctuary, he was fortuitous enough to spawn nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian found him and knew who he was. Shortly after, he was led to the
      shelter, where he was granted accommodation. He had even been provided
      much free flesh to level up at a greater pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not all peachy. Su Mianhua had been imprisoned in the shelter
      and not even allowed to return to the Alliance. He had been forced to
      remain inside the shelter to do research on Nan Litian’s behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Su Mianhua knew Nan Litian often went out to murder creatures for the sole
      purpose of getting him to do more research. But while the requirement to
      do research had been forced upon him, over time, he had grown to enjoy it.
      It became a hobby of sorts, and he was really into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technology in the sanctuaries was fairly primitive, but he had made
      grand advancements in the time he had spent there. He needed more time and
      more materials, though. He had run low on supplies recently, so he was
      quite interested in whether or not a new leader would tolerate his hobby.
      If the new owner was a creature, there’d be a high chance he would be
      killed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the many years of research, while he had collected many geno points,
      he had done no combat training. He would be hopeless in a fight, so if he
      was cast out of the shelter, it’d be as good as a death sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the spirits and creatures stared at the spirit hall, ready for the
      announcement of who their next leader was.
