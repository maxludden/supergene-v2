<h2>Showing of Tusk</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1827</h3>

<p>Yisha told Han Sen he had to prove himself if he wished to
obtain more resources. So, Han Sen wanted this opportunity to show
off. Now that this man had willingly delivered himself on a
platter, Han Sen wasn’t going to let this chance slip away.</p>
<p>The man, who was named Gauss, looked at Han Sen angrily. If Han
Sen had been using the Earl horse knife, he assuredly wouldn’t have
been as enraged as he was now.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wasn’t using the horse knife, and neither was he
using the knife he had been keeping with him. He just picked up a
random blade off the ground. It was insulting, and that only fueled
Gauss’ anger.</p>
<p>“I want to see how cocky you can get.” Gauss brought out his own
pirate knife. It was just a little bit shiny.</p>
<p>That was a Viscount weapon. He had managed to find it after the
fourth rain. He was just a Baron, though, and he couldn’t make use
of all its power. Still, the knife itself had a grand sharpness to
it. With Han Sen now making use of an unranked knife, it’d likely
crumble and break if the two knives collided.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t really care, though. He swung his knife and
thought it was pretty great for what it was. It was stable to
wield, and it was definitely the sort of knife you’d use for
chopping.</p>
<p>“Why are you standing there? I thought you were going to teach
me a lesson. Come on!” Han Sen said to Gauss.</p>
<p>Gauss’ face looked grim. Without saying a word, he stepped
forward and tried to attack Han Sen. The pirate knife came like a
shadow, trying to ensnare Han Sen like a net</p>
<p>Gauss’ knife skills were good. The power and speed showed off a
high level of experience.</p>
<p>His technique was no weaker than Teeth Knife, as well. Teeth
Knife was not just focused on prowess, though. It was the technique
itself, and how it revolved around that teeth power, that made it
stand out.</p>
<p>But Gauss was going after Han Sen. Han Sen might have looked
young, but he was like an ancient beast Han Sen’s skill and
experiences could not be remotely compared to what Gauss had
endured in his lifetime.</p>
<p>The scary thing was that they were both Barons, yet Han Sen’s
fitness was far higher than Gauss’ or any other Baron’s. There
might have been some who were as strong as Han Sen, but they didn’t
belong to the Rebate. No Rebate Baron had that level of power.</p>
<p>Seeing Gauss’ knife net coming down to land on him, Han Sen
stepped forward. He held up his knife and let the net fall onto
it.</p>
<p>Gauss was shocked. His skill was called Shadow Knife, and rather
than creating a real net, it made illusions. Many shadows fell from
the sky, but one of them would be lethal.</p>
<p>Normal people would not be able to tell which was the real
shadow and which were fake, so most would retreat and attempt to
block. This was the first time he had seen someone so willing to
come against it where they stood. You would need a lot of
confidence to stick to your guns like that</p>
<p>And all the shadows Han Sen bumped into were illusions, too. He
somehow avoided the real knife.</p>
<p>“How did he know where my real blade was?” Gauss was shocked. He
moved his body with the desire of striking again.</p>
<p>But it was too late. The others watched as Han Sen leaped
through the net, raced over to Gauss, and drew his knife like a
cobra strike.</p>
<p>The sides of Gauss’ neck had fanged cuts in them, as if he had
actually been bitten by a snake. Blood seeped out of the bite
marks.</p>
<p>Gauss held onto his neck as he stumbled back. His face turned
pale.</p>
<p>The woman that accompanied him looked shocked. She couldn’t use
Teeth Knife herself, but she recognized it. Han Sen was using Tusk.
All it took was one meager strike to heavily damage Gauss.</p>
<p>In Narrow Moon, Gauss had to be in the top five of his class.
His Shadow Knife was not as good as Teeth Knife, but it was still
fairly infamous. Gauss also had a Viscount weapon, and the woman
struggled to believe he had been unable to block Han Sen’s
attack.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave.” Gauss stared at Han Sen as he clutched his
bleeding neck. He turned to leave.</p>
<p>He knew if Han Sen had attacked any deeper, he’d have been a
dead man.</p>
<p>When Gauss had left, Black Steel turned to Han Sen. “When you
fought me, you didn’t use all your power.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you doing the same?” Han Sen smiled and dropped the
knife back on the ground. He went on to say, “Let’s go. We should
see if we can find a better knife. The knife rain itself will be
harder to deal with than those people were. It’ll be terrible if I
don’t get a good one. Oh, and if you can, could you teach me how to
identify knives?”</p>
<p>“No.” Black Steel refused. Then he walked forward to continue
their search for a decent knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders and followed Black Steel. He saw
the weapons all about and noticed that they didn’t radiate any
power. All he could see was that they each looked different.</p>
<p>Black Steel hailed from a family of blacksmiths. Before the
sixth round, though, he found a Viscount weapon.</p>
<p>Black Steel gifted the Leaf Knife to Han Sen. When Han Sen held
it, he thought it felt different from the others. The texture was
different.</p>
<p>In a hall that looked palatial, a Rebate man slowly approached
and looked at Knife Queen. “Why take a student like that?</p>
<p>That’s not very you.”</p>
<p>“Moon-Wheel King, why should you care about which student I
accept?” Yisha responded evenly.</p>
<p>Moon-Wheel King smiled. “You don’t have to answer to me on what
students you accept, but you gave out resources that belonged to
the Rebate. For this, you must provide an explanation.”</p>
<p>“Is my student not worthy of a spot in the space tunnel?” Yisha
said.</p>
<p>“Your student might be worth hundreds of slots, but he is an
outsider. Things aren’t so simple. Do you really want to raise
him?” Moon-Wheel King asked.</p>
<p>“That is my business. Don’t worry about it.” Yisha looked
cold.</p>
<p>“I just want to remind you of our rules. Don’t forget them. No
one controls the entire race. Not you. Not I,” Moon-Wheel King said
slowly.</p>
<p>“I know better than you do. There’s no need for you to remind
me.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Moon-Wheel King smiled and then left.</p>
<p>Seeing him leave, Yisha frowned. The things he said could not
have been just him talking. Other kings must have been whispering
in his ear; otherwise, he wouldn’t have bothered coming.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, it is all down to you now, and how far you can go.”
Yisha sighed.</p>
<p>Even now, Yisha was not entirely sure whether or not she should
commit to developing Han Sen.</p>
