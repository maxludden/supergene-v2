    <p>
      The legion of snakes had gathered all around the mystic peach tree. Han
      Sen also saw the black bear and its cub there. A blue beast and a crane of
      sorts were there, as well. Every creature he had encountered at the tree
      the last time, minus the bone elephant, were here at the tree once again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s arrival was not without trouble, however. His coming led
      to unrest with the pink snake and its legion. And indeed, the legion of
      snakes did not disperse with the silver fox&#8217;s coming. As Han Sen
      arrived, all of the snakes lifted their heads, as if to warn Han Sen not
      to tread any closer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pink snake was sat upon the titanboa as it once did. It stared at Han
      Sen with cold, poisonous eyes; it was evident it had not forgotten who he
      was.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for some reason, the pink snake avoided Han Sen and did not attack.
      This behavior surprised him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black cub on the other hand, looked delighted to see Han Sen. In
      surprise, it ran out to Han Sen&#8217;s feet, ignoring the legion of
      snakes. With a little observation, Han Sen noticed that the cub had grown
      in size since the last time it met. It had grown up fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the cub reached Han Sen, it ran in circles and sniffed around him.
      Then, it signaled for Han Sen to sit next to the big bear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, taking a look at the peach tree, noticed that there weren&#8217;t
      any peaches on it yet. He watched it for a while, but then, after some
      time, noticed two peaches manifest between the green leaves. They were
      about the size of ostrich eggs. The peaches were red on the bottom and
      pale on the top; they looked as if they were moments away from ripening.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Such a giant tree only produced two peaches?&#8221; Han Sen looked
      to his left and right, and indeed, the mystic peach tree had only produced
      two peaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      One was hanging at the tip of the twig and the other was a little further
      up.
    </p>

    <p>
      The super creatures that had gathered there, all looked up at the peaches.
      The little angel and the silver fox were almost as powerful as the two
      bears, in comparison. Han Sen alone, could almost equate to the power of
      the silver fox and he wagered he could beat at least two super creatures
      to the punch of nabbing the peaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then took a look at his competition; pink snake, blue beast,
      crane, little bear and big bear. There were five super creatures, and
      against the legion of snakes there, it&#8217;d be difficult to take the
      peaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen went near the big bear, which sat away from the peach tree.
      Strangely enough, none of the super creatures sought to go close to the
      tree. They circled it, almost as if there was a radius they had to be
      outside of.
    </p>

    <p>
      This confused Han Sen. Seeing two peaches on the tree, with one at the end
      of the twig and the other a little above, they both shone like a fruit
      from heaven&#8217;s very own orchard. They emitted a pleasant smell, a
      smell even nicer than the smell of the peach flowers.
    </p>

    <p>
      But despite the tantalizing prospect of the peaches being right there for
      the taking, no creature dared make a move. It was like they weren&#8217;t
      in a rush to take them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black bear was lying on the ground of the Peach Forest, but it looked
      up, seemingly focused on the two peaches. But look is all it did, and it
      most certainly did not appear ready to take them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pink snake and the blue beast looked the same way. The crane was
      perched on a nearby peach tree, but still away from the mystic giant tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cub continued to circle Han Sen but then stopped to stare at the
      silver fox that was resting on Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder. It seemed really
      interested in the creature, as it couldn&#8217;t stop staring.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Strange. Those peaches are going to ripen, so why are they keeping
      their distance? Shouldn&#8217;t they each be vying for it right now?
      Aren&#8217;t they afraid of someone else stealing it?&#8221; Han Sen
      stared at the mystic peach tree and began to feel as if something was
      wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      He used Jadeskin to unlock his gene lock and heighten his senses. Although
      he did not have the eighth sense yet, his senses and perceptions still
      exceeded that of the super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used his new sensory functions to inspect the peach tree and his
      face looked horrified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the use of his heightened senses, he noticed there was something
      wrong with the mystic peach tree. On the tree there was something really
      small, but it was something alive that moved around. In fact, there were
      many of them, and they were moving all over. When observing the twig that
      held the peaches, Han Sen could see them crawling around like ants. Just
      seeing it made his head itch.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bugs? Why are there so many strange bugs on the tree?&#8221; Han
      Sen was shocked. The bugs were so small, yet the tree was huge. They dug
      underneath the bark of the tree and with average eyesight, you could not
      tell they were there through simple observation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it wasn&#8217;t for Han Sen&#8217;s sense, he wouldn&#8217;t have
      noticed their presence even if he went to stand directly in front of the
      tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are those bugs? Even the super creatures are avoiding them.
      They don&#8217;t even dare to go close.&#8221; Han Sen frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was positive the last time he was here at the tree, there were no
      bugs. Otherwise, he&#8217;d have known about them coming here.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was practicing Dongxuan Sutra for a long time beneath the boughs of
      that great tree, so there was no way he had managed to avoid sensing them
      during that time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Strange. Where did all these bugs come from? There is no way they
      can be super creatures, can they? But why are the super creatures scared
      of them? And why do they avoid going near the tree?&#8221; Han Sen mulled
      the peculiar situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then remembered the time he got Princess Yin Yang. She informed
      Han Sen about the nature of the sacred-blood class Silver Beetle mother.
      Perhaps the bugs weren&#8217;t all too different to the silver beetle. She
      explained that the smaller silver beetles were little more than weapons,
      created by the mother. They weren&#8217;t actual living creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      If these bugs were able to make the super creatures that scared, the
      mother of the bugs may have been a super creature, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If this is true; that&#8217;s bad news. A super creature that can
      produce countless smaller insects will be a terrifying foe. I shudder at
      the thought!&#8221; Han Sen then sensed the ground, but his abilities were
      still a little limited as he had yet to fully unlock the eighth sense.
      Therefore, he could not find out what was going on beneath the earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unable to ascertain where the mother might be, Han Sen returned his gaze
      to the smaller bugs on the tree. They were inside the bark, eating it.
      Although they did not eat much, it was still a shocker to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mystic peach tree was something sacred. It was something that even the
      super creatures greatly admired. It was a surprise to see these bugs eat
      and desecrate it like so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, being unable to figure out what the bugs were, was just like the
      bears now. He remained motionless, staring at the tree, not daring to get
      close. They just waited until it was ripe.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few days later, the peach on the upper reaches of the twig, had already
      turned jade. Strangely, it emitted a red mist. A holy presence emerged
      from the peach like jade, as well. The scent was carried by the wind,
      coating the next few hundred miles with its pleasing fragrance.
