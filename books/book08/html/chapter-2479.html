<h2>Tianxia’s Power</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2479</h3>

<p>Han Sen was getting chased by the unicorn Kings. The herd of
unicorns was fleeing as fast as they could, so he couldn’t use his
eye ability to escape. He frowned.</p>
<p>The gold unicorn King pursued Han Sen relentlessly. The beast
clearly wanted to end him.</p>
<p>“You won’t treat me with any respect unless I show my teeth,
huh?” Han Sen thought angrily. He gathered up all the power he had,
then he lifted the Thunder God Spike and thrust it toward the gold
unicorn’s fusiform area.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The area and the Thunder God Spike clashed against each other,
unleashing a scary fountain of sparks. The impact ripped the fabric
of space. Han Sen felt as if his arms were about to be shaken
loose, and his entire body was pushed back by the force of that
fearsome power.</p>
<p>Han Sen held tightly to the Thunder God Spike. His Jadeskin
power was running at max capacity, but it still wasn’t enough to
repel the gold unicorn’s power.</p>
<p>Han Sen used all the might he could muster, and it felt like he
was pulling power all the way from his toenails! The Blood-Pulse
Sutra was boiling inside Han Sen’s body, and his blood roared
through his veins like a runaway train.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a force shook Han Sen from the inside out. He could
sense an invisible cogwheel in front of him. His body was the
center of the cogwheel—the big red cogwheel.</p>
<p>“The Blood-Pulse Sutra is going to become King class!” Han Sen
was shocked. He hadn’t expected the Blood-Pulse Sutra to level up
without an enormous amount of conscious effort on Han Sen’s
part.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s self-cogwheel started to spin. It did so
in unison with other cogwheels of the universe. Because Han Sen’s
body was in motion, he couldn’t open the universal core hall’s
door.</p>
<p>But after the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s self-cogwheel moved, Han Sen
noticed something strange.</p>
<p>The other self-cogwheels that Han Sen had spun could push the
universal cogwheels around them. Jadeskin’s cogwheel could push
seven, and the Dongxuan Sutra’s cogwheel could push many.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra, though, couldn’t push any of the nearby
universal cogwheels. Somehow, though, Han Sen still sensed that
many universal cogwheels were connected to it.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t understand what was going on, and he had no idea
what the area power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra might be. When he
activated his Mutant Blood Area, no actual area powers were
emitted.</p>
<p>And yet, his fitness increased a lot. Fighting the unicorn Kings
wasn’t all that difficult for him now. And he was now moving
quickly enough to evade their attacks.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen spun the Thunder God Spike in his hand and jabbed it
into the gold unicorn’s area. Then Han Sen leaped up, dodging
another unicorn’s laser light.</p>
<p>Lando’s Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo was getting brighter. The scary
purple dragon air rising from the tattoo was condensing into
substance chains. It became a giant purple dragon upon Lando’s
body.</p>
<p>The Tianxia Unicorn’s face looked grim. The rainbow colors in
its eyes flashed repeatedly, as if the universe was dying and being
reborn inside them.</p>
<p>Lando roared, and a giant purple dragon shook everything around
them. It looked as if he was going to swallow the entire world.</p>
<p>The light in the Tianxia Unicorn’s eyes deepened, combining
until all the colors had mixed into a uniform grey. The grey light
shot out, heading for the raging purple dragon.</p>
<p>When the grey light and giant purple dragon collided, the whole
world seemed to go quiet. The powers collided in near silence, and
for a moment, nothing seemed to happen. A small vortex appeared
between them, then began to expand, growing until it was exerting a
powerful drag on everything in sight. It was like space itself was
falling into an abyss.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the unicorn Kings were still engaged in battle when
Han Sen felt the vortex pulling him toward Lando and the Tianxia
Unicorn.</p>
<p>And Han Sen wasn’t the only one affected. The unicorn Kings, the
fleeing unicorn herd, and even the clouds around them were all
being sucked into the vortex. Once they fell inside, they
vanished.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast his own powers, but he couldn’t fight off that
force of suction that was dragging him in. Not even a half-deified
King unicorn could escape it, so the chances of Han Sen escaping it
were nil.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was about to be sucked into the dark swirl, Han
Sen prepared to return to the sanctuary. Just before he activated
his power, though, he felt someone grab his arm and pull him back
from the abyss.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his head and saw that it was Lando who had
grabbed him.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the sound of something breaking. Under the
tremendous power of the vortex, the invisible walls composed of
substance chains started to crumble. The walls shattered like glass
and began to fall into the abyss.</p>
<p>“Go!” Lando shouted. The arm that was holding Han Sen swung as
Lando hurled Han Sen away from the vortex. In the next second, Han
Sen found himself thousands of miles away, and he was still
flying.</p>
<p>As he flew back, Han Sen heard a distant shout. The grey light
inside the Tianxia Unicorn looked like a laser that could destroy
the whole universe. It was being fired at Lando again.</p>
<p>A dragon roar shook space itself, and Lando’s whole body became
a giant purple dragon that struck the grey light.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched as the grey light pierced straight through the
giant dragon body. The huge form suddenly dissolved into purple
smoke.</p>
<p>Lando’s body was sent flying, still trailing streamers of that
smoke. His body was twitching spasmodically. He was dying.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He thought Lando had thrown him away
because the man believed he could defeat the Tianxia Unicorn. But
now, it seemed as if that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>“Why is he doing this? He doesn’t seem like the sort of guy who
would care about the lives of others. Why would he save me moments
before losing?” Han Sen kept thinking about it, but he was unable
to understand.</p>
<p>“Why should I care? He has nothing to do with me, anyway.” Han
Sen summoned his power and added to the force of Lando’s throw,
boosting himself away from there.</p>
<p>Lando’s body was floating amidst the clouds. The light of the
Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo grew faint. It required a lifeforce to
remain active.</p>
<p>Lando’s lifeforce was fading. He couldn’t support the Demon Hell
Dragon Tattoo any longer, and the tattoo fell from his body.</p>
<p>“In the end, I still couldn’t attain that last step.” Lando
could see the Tianxia Unicorn coming for him. He could see the
unicorn’s eyes glowing grey. A powerful grey beam came from its
eyes. Lando looked so calm, though, and it was as if he didn’t care
whether he lived or died. It was as if he wouldn’t feel any pain…
and he wouldn’t.</p>
<p>He quietly closed his eyes, peacefully waiting for that final
moment to come. To him, death would be a sweet relief.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The grey beam broke the sky, but it didn’t break Lando’s body.
Something tightened around Lando’s arms. Someone had suddenly
pulled him away. The grey beam went right by his body and into the
sky, missing him entirely. The power roared past him, an incredible
display of strength.</p>
