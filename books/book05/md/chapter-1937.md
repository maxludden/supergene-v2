Han Sen walked around a bit, but he didn’t catch sight of God’s Retribution again.

“Maybe my eyes are going funny.” Han Sen shook his head, then went to find a place in the Buddha city to stay.

The city was made of gold, and even the ground was paved with it. It was rather intimidating in its splendor. There were statues of the Buddha everywhere, and their presence made Han Sen feel uncomfortable.

“I wonder when Yisha will show up again?” Han Sen waited for another two days, and still didn’t see her. He was getting impatient now.

People in the city were starting to talk about Burning Lamp Alpha’s upcoming speech quite a bit now. No race was prohibited from hearing the speech, and anyone of any status could go.

“It is no wonder she said it does not matter if I hear it or not. Since the speech will address everyone, surely nothing unique or valuable will be said. Everyone will know whatever he says,” Han Sen was thinking as he approached a Buddha statue.

He was walking on a famous Buddha Path. It was a straight road that led straight to the Burning Lamp Alpha’s palace. The way was ten meters wide, adorned with three thousand gold Buddhas fencing it.

The rumors said that every Buddha represented a world. Three thousand Buddhas meant there were three thousand worlds. There was a geno art of the Buddha that was called Three Thousand Worlds. It was derived from the three thousand Buddhas of that path.

Han Sen didn’t believe the stories, though. But he had nothing better to do with his time, and so he decided to come and take a look. Perhaps he’d be able to learn a thing or two.

Because Burning Lamp Alpha would give a speech, many outsiders were there, just like Han Sen. They were all accompanied by Magic of their own.

Bubble began bouncing up and down, wild with excitement.

The intelligence of the Magic grew slowly, and their personalities were rather simple. They weren’t complex beings. Reaching the level of intelligence of the one that mimicked the shape of Yisha would take a few decades. It also took a lot of energy for that to happen.

The three thousand Buddha statues were all unique, and not one of them was a copy of another. Han Sen came to take a look to kill some time.

When he walked past two hundred Buddhas, he saw Speechless and a few of the other outsiders there. None of them appeared to be low-ranked. Speechless had probably guided them there so they could take a look at the Buddhas.

Han Sen took a closer look and was surprised. All those outsiders were of a different race. One of them was a Feather.

The Feathers had been removed from the hall of higher races, and they were hardly ever seen outside of Holy Heaven nowadays. It was nothing small to see a Feather here.

Han Sen did not recognize that Feather, though. But amongst them was one person that Han Sen knew. And that was Hai’er of Pirate. She, too, was in the Buddha city.

“It looks like everyone is taking this heaven business seriously. I wonder what’s so good about it, and what resides in their heaven? I don’t know what Yisha was thinking when she decided not to explain anything. Am I not her student?

Or did she just get kicked in the head by a donkey?” Han Sen felt depressed.

Luckily, Hai’er would only recognize Han Sen if he was wearing his Dongxuan armor. That would be the face of Dollar. If she knew who he was, she might very well have tried to attack him then and there.

Aside from Han Sen, there was also a man with a cow’s head. He looked like a minotaur. He was not of the Kao, but Han Sen thought he was the same race as the fellow he had encountered during various Rebate events.

There were three others there, too. One of them had a head that grew like a dragonfly. There was one with three faces and six arms, and the other was a Gana man. He had the snake lower body and all.

They were all unique. Han Sen could not tell how strong they all were, but they all looked very different.

Han Sen stopped looking at them and returned his gaze to the statues around him. Han Sen really didn’t want to see Hai’er, in case she somehow identified him.

“Buddha Lady, on this trip to heaven, how many people can reach the other side?” The Gana man addressed Speechless.

“There are many geniuses here, so many should be able to reach the other side. You are each an elite of your respective races, with unique talents. If you have a strong will, you will make it,” Speechless said.

The cowhead man grunted and said, “Maybe not. This heaven has opened many times, and fewer than ten finish it each time. I am sure there is some limit to the number of those who can make it. And the more elites there are, the harder it will be.”

“Amitabha!” Speechless spoke the Buddha catchphrase, and then she said, “Sig Earl, you think too much. There are no enforced limitations. If you can walk through heaven, you will.”

The Gana man emotionlessly looked at the cowhead man and said, “Sig, if you are so afraid, you do not have to go.” “Goode, what are you saying?” The cowhead man ran towards the Gana in rage, breathing fire out of his nose.

“Calm down. This is the Buddha’s Path; you cannot make so much noise here.” Speechless stepped between the two.

Hai’er and the guy with three faces and six arms did not speak. They were merely watching.

Sig and Goode did not look as if they would continue the feud, and they simply ignored each other after that.

Speechless kept guiding them forward, showing off the three thousand Buddhas. When they came near Han Sen, Han Sen turned away from them. He didn’t want to get involved.

She only saw his back, but Speechless recognized Han Sen. Her expression became strange, and she pretended she hadn’t noticed him. She continued her tour of the three thousand Buddhas.

Seeing them walk away, Han Sen felt much relief. But before he could completely relax, Hai’er walked back towards Han Sen.

Han Sen was shocked. “Did she see something?”

Han Sen was not afraid of her, but he couldn’t risk his identity of Dollar being exposed. It’d cause big trouble with Yisha.

Hai’er walked right up to Han Sen and looked him over. Han Sen kept looking at the Buddha and ignored her.

Han Sen decided that, if she did notice something, he’d deny whatever she said. He’d deny no matter what.

Hai’er put her hand on Han Sen’s shoulder and spoke quietly into his ear. She said, “Are you romantically involved with Speechless?”

Han Sen was shocked. He certainly hadn’t expected Hai’er to say that. So, he just looked at her and pretended he didn’t know what she meant.
