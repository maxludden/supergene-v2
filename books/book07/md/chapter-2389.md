  Han Sen started to pull back to say something, but he saw Fox Queen’s tail begin to wave back and forth. Afterimages of the tail became substance chains, and it suddenly looked as if there were nine tails swinging in the air. The tails swept up and around Fox Queen and Han Sen, trapping them inside it like a cage.

Fox Queen’s eyes flashed silver, and strange silver symbols flared to life across her snow-white skin. They looked like tattoos, not on her skin but inside it.

At the same time, power that gushed like spring water rushed between Fox Queen’s lips and straight into Han Sen’s mouth.

A cool air surged through Han Sen’s body. His cells felt as if they had been thoroughly cleansed by a mountain spring.

Once that cool power blended into Han Sen’s cells, his body underwent some peculiar changes. A perfume that he could barely smell wafted from his body, its fragrance tickling the tip of his nose.

“I have given you the secret Fox technique. Your body now possesses the Nine Spin Fox power. If you follow my will and use the Nine Spin Fox Perfume skill, you can temporarily wield the powers of a Fox.” Fox Queen’s lips remained locked with Han Sen’s, but her voice sounded in Han Sen’s head.

Han Sen nodded slightly. Following Fox Queen’s will, he let the power course through him.

Fox Queen sent more and more of that power into Han Sen’s body. Han Sen got the power running, and it began to build. The perfume grew stronger and stronger. It felt as if Han Sen was swimming in a sea of flowers.

Shortly after, the perfume in Han Sen’s body became lighter until it disappeared, and he could no longer smell it at all. A minute later, the perfume was coming back.

The scent kept cycling between strong and light, and it did this nine times. Fox Queen’s power inside Han Sen had become very strong, and it combined with Han Sen’s body.

A very light silver symbol appeared on Han Sen’s skin. It looked similar to the symbols on Fox Queen, but it wasn’t as lustrous as those. Han Sen’s symbol was quite dull, by comparison.

Upon seeing the silver flower symbol appear on Han Sen, Fox Queen felt incredibly happy.

She had thought that Han Sen didn’t have any Fox blood, so she only expected him to absorb around twenty percent of the power she poured into the Nine Spin Fox Perfume.

But for some reason, Han Sen had been able to absorb every ounce of the Nine Spin Fox Perfume energy she had sent to him. Because of this, the Fox marking had appeared on his skin. Fox Queen was surprised, to say the least.

“Weird. Does his body contain some sort of Fox blood or something? How is he capable of supporting a Fox symbol?” Fox Queen was confused.

But after a second or so, Fox Queen made a decision. She had originally planned to stop the skill here, but instead, she kept it running.

The silver markings on Fox Queen’s skin continued to expand. The symbols slowly connected with each other, forming a nine-tailed silver fox upon her back.

That symbol was so strange. It was like a living fox lying across Fox Queen’s pale skin. It had small silver eyes, and they peered right at Han Sen.

The more power Fox Queen gave Han Sen, the brighter his silver pattern became. The silver symbols flashed continually, and just like Fox Queen’s, they started to connect. They soon started to resemble a nine-tailed fox that shone like burnished silver.

Han Sen felt as if all the energy inside him was rushing crazily around his body. He felt like a wild horse without its reins. Things were slipping out of his control.

“Fox Queen, stop! I cannot take it anymore.” Han Sen spoke to Fox Queen through his will.

Fox Queen ignored him. Her arms were wrapped around Han Sen’s neck, and her legs tightened around his waist. They were still kissing as silver substance chains thrust deep into Han Sen’s body.

“Fox Queen! What are you doing?” Han Sen demanded with his will. His face hardened as he began to struggle against her, but Fox Queen’s power was able to keep his suppressed.

Fox Queen finally responded. She smiled. She didn’t move her lips, but her voice played inside Han Sen’s ears all the same. “I never thought this body of yours possessed such extraordinary talent. You can generate the Fox markings. I have used all my Nine Spin Fox Perfume to help you, so that your body can naturally become a Nine Spin Fox Body. It will be great for you, and it will allow you to control the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror far more easily.”

“Fox Queen, do you really think I am three years old?” Han Sen growled through his will.

Fox Queen’s smile widened. “My good brother, why don’t you just do as you are told? I will not treat you poorly.”

As Fox Queen’s words echoed through Han Sen’s head, a silver substance chain drifted into Han Sen’s mouth. Han Sen’s Nine Spin Fox power was becoming stronger and stronger.

The power was almost out of Han Sen’s control. It followed Fox Queen’s will, running amok inside his body. The nine-tailed silver fox symbol on Han Sen’s skin brightened, and it looked as if it was going to come alive.

Now Han Sen was certain that Fox Queen wasn’t trying to give him a technique; she was attempting to gain control of his body.

Fox Queen wouldn’t admit to that, of course. She ignored Han Sen’s attempts to reason with her as she continued pouring her power inside him.

Just as Han Sen believed, Fox Queen was trying to refine Han Sen’s body into a Nine Spin Fox clone. If she did that, she would be able to control Han Sen completely. There would be no need for the precariousness of cooperation. She could save herself the trouble by controlling him directly.

This idea had come to her suddenly. She hadn’t expected Han Sen’s body to be capable of generating a fox symbol. What she said, in the beginning, wasn’t all a lie.

Han Sen understood Fox Queen, and he had never really trusted her anyway. It didn’t matter if she was telling the truth or not, though; he had a plan of his own.

If Fox Queen had just been honest and given Han Sen a new ability as she promised, he would have been disappointed. If she had done that, she wouldn’t have given Han Sen enough power to fulfill his plan.

Han Sen wanted to use Fox Queen’s power to push his self-universe cogwheel. That way, he could reach King class.

This was a big risk. But compared to attempting to subjugate someone else’s power in the midst of a fight, this was far easier.

Power that had been summoned for combat would be far more destructive. Guiding it into his body without destroying himself wouldn’t be easy. Controlling it with enough precision to move the self-universe cogwheel would be even harder.

But now, Fox Queen was sending her power directly into Han Sen’s body, and the power wasn’t intended to harm him. That saved him so much trouble. Han Sen knew this was the best chance he would get to borrow deified power.

When Han Sen felt that the necessary amount of energy had built up within him, he didn’t hesitate. He engaged his Dongxuan Sutra. He wanted to use that power to push his self-universe cogwheel.

Fox Queen felt something suddenly shift within Han Sen’s body. She realized what Han Sen was trying to do, and she chuckled deep in her throat.

“How ridiculous! Your weak powers cannot divert powers like mine.”
