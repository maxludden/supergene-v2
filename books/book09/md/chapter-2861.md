Deep Abyss Knight was a xenogeneic. He had an armored knight upper body and the lower body of an octopus. Many black, metal tentacles wriggled around his lower body. It was like he had a weird shadow. Even the space around him was twisted.

Han Sen had watched the Deep Abyss Knight fight before. He knew that the Deep Abyss Knight was a dark element xenogeneic. He could release very strong and corrosive dark powers. His defensive attributes were very high. If a xenogeneic of the same level attacked his armor, one would be able to break it.

Regarding his metallic tentacles, even if they were cut off, replacements grew almost instantly. So, attacking the tentacles was pointless. One had to break the armor or body to succeed.

Han Sen was holding the Return Empty Scabbard. It counted as half a god personality armament. Although it was man-made, it was not as powerful as a real god personality armament. Still, it was a treasure that was close to true god class.

Although Han Sen wanted to hurry and play chess, Han Sen did not underestimate Deep Abyss Knight. He still stayed vigilant.

Han Sen’s xenogeneic mode was almost invincible, but there were many xenogeneics in the universe. They all had unbelievable powers. If Han Sen encountered a strange power and fell into its tricks, he would pay the price with his life. This was not a joke.

The intelligence of most xenogeneics was not too high. Even if it was high, they would be low when it came to their emotional intelligence. Han Sen and the xenogeneic had nothing to talk about, so Han Sen gathered up power via his Return Empty Scabbard and attacked.

The knife was pure power, but his xenogeneic power amplified its strength to a force that exceeded true god class. A butterfly xenogeneic at the same level stood no chance of trying to withstand Han Sen’s power.

The Return Empty Scabbard had its own power to deal too. If an ordinary butterfly xenogeneic was struck by Han Sen, it would end up dead or injured.

The Deep Abyss Knight was very cold. His eyes were like black holes. They were so deep that it was like they could absorb light.

He did not dodge. The Deep Abyss Knight crossed his arms across his chest. He was not planning on moving an inch. When the Return Empty Scabbard got closer, the tentacles below his body moved. They were going for Han Sen’s Return Empty Scabbard.

The tentacles struck the Return Empty Scabbard, but not a single sound was made. The tentacles silently wrapped up the Return Empty Scabbard. The suckers below the tentacles started to suck the Return Empty Scabbard.

Han Sen’s expression changed. From what he had seen before, he knew the Deep Abyss Knight was strong, but he couldn’t have such a strong power. He used one tentacle to block his Return Empty Scabbard’s slash. With a power like that, Han Sen believed Deep Abyss Knight was a true god class.

Han Sen’s eyes looked cold. He was holding the Return Empty Scabbard. He tried to pull it back. He saw the Return Empty Scabbard flash with a purple light. No matter how hard Han Sen tried, the Return Empty Scabbard did not move. It was sucked onto the tentacles.

The Deep Abyss Knight’s arms were still crossed across his chest. He coldly looked at Han Sen with a face of utter disdain and said, “Stupid creature.”

Following his words, purple and black flames surged out of the Deep Abyss Knight’s body. His entire body was like a demon crawling out of purgatory. The tentacles holding the scabbard swung. They pulled on Han Sen and the scabbard. At the same time, other tentacles were wrapping up his body.

Han Sen was shocked. He had to let the scabbard go. He quickly stumbled back and evaded the attacks of the lashing tentacles.

“How is that possible? How did the Deep Abyss Knight’s power become so much stronger?” Han Sen asked with a frown. If he did not know the geno god list fights could have people swapping position, he would have started wondering whether or not it was the same Deep Abyss Knight he had seen before. Its power was certainly different.

It was not just Han Sen that was confused. Many elites who knew Deep Abyss Knight were also in shock.

“Since when did the Deep Abyss Knight become so strong? With his power now, it does not look like a dark element only.” The woman in Sky Palace was shocked.

“It is weird.” Sky Palace Leader frowned.

In the Very High, Exquisite and Li Keer watched the scene. They thought it was strange too. Li Keer said, “I thought Deep Abyss Knight was a dark element being. Why is this dark knight suddenly different? Will Dollar lose?”

“It looks like Deep Abyss Knight is stronger than Dollar,” Exquisite coldly said. “Just one skill has disarmed him. He took his treasure scabbard. I am afraid Dollar is going to lose this round.”

When Li Keer heard that, she felt terrible. Although she had been unsuccessful in making Dollar her silkworm, she still did not want Dollar to lose.

On Empty Mountain, the green-haired beast looked confused. “Weird. Why is that Deep Abyss Knight so strong. I fought Deep Abyss Knight once, and he was not that strong.”

The woman nearby coldly looked at Deep Abyss Knight and said, “In this world, whatever monster shows up, it does not matter. Little Mountain Leader will defeat them. Empty Mountain will once again be back on top.”

“You are right,” the green-haired beast said with a cocky look. “Little Mountain Leader’s power is almost as good as the old mountain leader. Swallowing a true god is not difficult for it. Whether it’s Deep Abyss Knight or Dollar, whoever stands in Little Mountain Leader’s way will end up dead.”

When Yisha saw that the Return Empty Scabbard had been stolen by Deep Abyss Knight, she frowned. “What is Dollar doing?”

In the Extreme King garden, God stroked his jaw and said to himself, “Was my hint not clear enough? He used Sky Armor God’s rib bone to attack Sky Armor God. That is just giving up the ghost. You just gave the god personality back. With Sky Armor God’s personality, I do not think he will take the god personality and run.”

Deep Abyss Knight swung his tentacles and brought the scabbard next to him. Then, he let go of his arm. He used his right arm to grab the Return Empty Scabbard. His eyes flashed with a weird light.

Han Sen frowned and looked at Deep Abyss Knight. He felt there was something wrong. Deep Abyss Knight was releasing a presence that felt the same as the Return Empty Scabbard.

Deep Abyss Knight stroked the Return Empty Scabbard. He felt extremely happy. His happiness could not be described. “My god personality has finally been returned.”

After Deep Abyss Knight performed that action, the Return Empty Scabbard’s light became brighter and brighter. It looked like the flames on Deep Abyss Knight were connecting. They released a light that blew into the sky.

At this time, even the elites who were watching could tell what was happening. Deep Abyss Knight did not have strong enough power to cause a reaction with the scabbard that would result in it exploding so powerfully.

“This is true god class power,” the woman said with shock. “Did Deep Abyss Knight become a true god?”

“No, that is not a true god. He is not the real Deep Abyss Knight.” Sky Palace Leader’s eyes were icy. He said, “He is a God Spirit that descended.”
