  Han Sen saw something descend from the sky. It was a man in green clothing. A fairly ordinary looking Sky.

That man’s approach wasn’t ominous like the Dragon was, and he rode down atop a swallow mount. The bird was a pretty black and white, but it was definitely a little too small. The Sky man occupied all of its back, and he had to stand precariously on it.

The swallow looked tired. It flew before Han Sen, allowing the green-clothed man to nod at him. Then, it landed.

The swallow flew away in a rush, as if it was actually fleeing. The green-clothed man spoke to the escaping swallow, saying, “Thank you for bringing me here. I will return the favor some day!”

When the swallow heard what he said, it started flying away even faster. It flew as fast and far as it could. Eventually, it disappeared from sight.

“Greetings. I am Yu Shanxin. For my sake, give Han Sen a break. I will take whatever punishment you have reserved for him. I won’t fight back, and I will accept whatever you deal out until you are satisfied.” The green-clothed man stood in front of Han Sen with a gleeful smile.

Dragon One looked at the green-clothed man, and he said coldly, “Yu Shanxin, is Sky Palace really going to accept the punishment on his behalf?”

Yu Shanxin nodded seriously. “Han Sen is Knife Queen’s student. She requested that Sky Palace take care of him. I need to see him returned safely. If we didn’t do this, then… I am not sure how I would even begin to explain things. It will ruin the reputation of Sky Palace. You must understand my reasoning.”

The students of Knife Queen are that important? So important that they can freely kill as many of the Dragon as they please?” Dragon One coldly looked at Yu Shanxin.

The Dragon are a higher race. The Dragon are important enough. How about this? A life for a life. I will pay on his behalf. If you want to kill me, then just come at me,” Yu Shanxin said, lowering his head.

Han Sen was shocked by this, and he quickly said, “I did this. This has nothing to do with Sky Palace.”

Yu Shanxin smiled at Han Sen, and then he shook his head. “When you entered Sky Palace, you were automatically made one of our ranks. Furthermore, the leader is the one that instructed you to go to the Ancient God space. Whatever you do is a responsibility of ours.”

Han Sen wished to say something, but Yu Shanxin stopped him.

“Fine. Yu Shanxin, if you want to shoulder his debt, then take my finger. If you survive, you may live. And then I will consider our debt settled.” Dragon One looked at Yu Shanxin.

“Thank you, Mister Dragon. I will be forever thankful,” Yu Shanxin said gratefully.

“If you survive the touch of my finger, only then can you say thank you.” After that, Dragon One pointed his finger at Yu Shanxin’s forehead.

That finger looked as if it could poke through the entire galaxy. Time and space collapsed around it, and everything vanished around that finger.

Han Sen, who was standing behind Yu Shanxin, felt as if his body was going to be perforated. It felt as if Dragon One’s finger could turn everything to dust. But Yu Shanxin remained unmoved. He did not raise his hand, and he let Dragon One point that finger at his forehead.

Han Sen was shocked. “Is that guy really going to die for me? I can’t accept a favor like this.”

The next second, Han Sen saw the finger that could destroy the world get pointed at Yu Shanxin. No power came out from it, though. It looked as if Dragon One’s finger only poked the man, and that was that.

“Thank you for letting me live,” Yu Shanxin showed true appreciation as he bowed.

Dragon One looked at Yu Shanxin without expression. “It is no wonder you are the one who broke through Sky Palace. Godslayer Yu, who carried the Blood Coffin to Outer Sky, I promise you that the Dragon’s grudge with Han Sen has been erased.”

After that, Dragon One went back to his carriage. The ten beasts resumed pulling it, and it eventually disappeared. “Thank you for saving my life,” Han Sen said quickly. He owed this man a great deal.

Yu Shanxin waved his hand and said, “You represented Sky Palace in your trip to the Ancient God space. What transpired there was not your fault. Sky Palace will not allow anything ill to befall you. You deserved the bailout, so there is no need to thank me.”

After that, Yu Shanxin waved his hand again and a black and white swallow flew down from the mountains. It did so upside-down. It reached his hands and could not fly away.

“Since you brought me here, you might as well take me back,” Yu Shanxin said, stepping atop the swallow. He stood on one foot, and the swallow took him away.

“Hey, I’m still here!” Han Sen’s eyes were open wide. He realized he was still surrounded by the Dragon, and that Yu Shanxin was now gone.

“Sorry, please excuse me.” Han Sen gulped, then squeezed his way through the Dragon xenogeneics and nobles.

They looked at Han Sen with anger, as if they wanted to eat him, but now no one dared to touch him.

Han Sen made his way through the scary xenogeneics and nobles, and it was lucky that he had a strong will. Ordinary Marquises would have felt their legs shaking as they walked past.

“You are powerful. You got Yu Shanxin to save you.” After Han Sen walked through, Xius appeared by his side. She sat down on a stone and spoke to him.

“Is Master Yu famous?” Han Sen asked.

“You are a member of Sky Palace. Do you not know Godslayer Yu Shanxin?” Xius looked at Han Sen with surprise. “Godslayer? He looked like a nice chap. Why would he have such a title?” Han Sen asked.

Xius looked at him strangely, and she said, “Godslayer Yu was his true name. Yu Shanxin is actually what he named himself. There are many elites in this universe, but there is only one who was brave enough to dare storming Sky Palace.”

“He is a member of Sky Palace? That makes no sense. You just said that he stormed it,” Han Sen said with a chuckle.

Xius realized that Han Sen really did not know anything about the man, and so she explained, “Yu Shanxin’s teacher was set up by his schoolmates and executed for the crime of treason. It was a pointless death. Yu Shanxin brought his teacher’s coffin back to Sky Palace, but someone stopped him. He was maddened by this, and so he stormed in. He beat the ten elders, and he got so far into Sky Palace that he was able to meet with the leader. He wanted to make things right.”

“Anyone who was involved in his teacher’s death was killed. He killed many in Sky Palace, all alone. Even the coffin itself was dyed red. After doing all that, Godslayer Yu became quite famous. I am not sure why he changed his name to Yu Shanxin, though.”
