<p>“Old Liar, I am hungry.” On the streets, there was a pretty
little girl who looked like a doll. She was pulling the sleeves of
the old man next to her. Her eyes were wide open as she looked at
him. She made sure to make herself appear extra pitiable.</p>
<p>Her face looked like she was starving, and she had a lack of
clothes. It was like she was abused. It made others want to take
pity on her and cry when they heard the stories she told. The
corners of the old man’s eyes twitched. A half a day ago, Bao’er
ate the most expensive meal in the most expensive restaurant and
had emptied his wallet of every penny it contained. Even he was
starting to believe it. He wanted to smack his mouth and curse
himself for being useless. He could not even raise a little girl
well.</p>
<p>“My little kid, ever since you’ve been with me, your mouth has
not stopped moving,” the old man depressingly said. “With the way
you eat, even if there was a mountain of gold and a mountain of
silver, it’d be eaten by you. How did that Han Sen used to raise
you?”</p>
<p>“Dad would not let me starve. If you are saying you cannot
afford to take care of me, I am going back.” Bao’er looked grumpy.
She turned around, ready to leave. “Little kid, I concede. I will
take you someplace nice to eat,” the old man said while dragging
Bao’er with him.</p>
<p>“Old Liar, don’t you dare try and lie to me.” Bao’er squinted at
the old man.</p>
<p>“I would lie to everyone else, yes, but you?” the old man asked.
“You just need to wait here for a bit. I will take you to eat
something very nice and spicy. You can eat whatever you want there.
I promise you you’ll be full.” “You are very nice, Old Granddad.”
Bao’er smiled a lot. She held the old man’s hand and behaved very
cutely.</p>
<p>“This girl… It does not make sense. How could she have been
raised to this age… How did that bastard Han Sen grow you so big?”
The old man was speechless.</p>
<p>“By the way, Old Liar, I thought you ran out of money.” Bao’er
looked at the old man and blinked as she spoke to him. “Eating food
does not require money all the time.” Bao’er was holding a flag
while he walked across the street. He went searching for something.
Not long later, he bent over and picked up a stone that was sharp
and fist-sized.</p>
<p>He pulled Bao’er along as he kept walking. When they came to a
T-junction, he looked to his left and right. He then put the sharp
stone on the corner that turned.</p>
<p>Bao’er blinked and asked, “Can we get money to eat this
way?”</p>
<p>“Of course, tasty stuff will come here right now,” the old man
said. He pulled Bao’er forward to walk with him. Not long later,
they stopped near the street. He put down the flag and placed a
yellow cloth on the ground. He pulled out a chair and sat on the
cloth. He closed his eyes and rested.</p>
<p>“Old Liar, is this going to work?” Bao’er waited for a while,
but nothing tasty appeared.</p>
<p>“Do not rush. It is on its merry way.” The old man’s eyes did
not open. He looked calm as he spoke to her.</p>
<p>After a while, the street suddenly had chickens flying and dogs
jumping. They saw a guy riding a gold, big crab gene race. It was
skittering around the street, making the street all dirty.</p>
<p>Seeing this big, gold crab that looked like a tank come close to
them, the old man’s eyes and lips suddenly became very thin. He
then blew out air and made a strange noise. When the big gold crab
heard that sound, its crazy moving body came to a halt. The person
atop the beast looked rather excited. The gold, big crab came to a
stop. It was a sudden one, so the man was thrown right off. It
looked like a dog eating shit. His head went in front of the
fortune-teller old man with a shock.</p>
<p>The old man looked at the young man who had fallen with his ass
sticking up and said, “Old man, I have seen your forehead go dark.
Did your head suffer a stroke of misfortune? Today, you will be
suffering a curse.”</p>
<p>The young man picked himself up off the ground. He wiped the
blood off his nose, looked at the old man, and coldly said, “Old
man, how dare you to start talking to me. Do you have any idea who
I am?”</p>
<p>After that, the young man reached out his hand to punch the old
man. The old man did not move. He coldly said, “If I am not
mistaken, you just experienced changes that can make a sad man very
happy. You have an opportunity before you.”</p>
<p>When the young man heard that, he was shocked. The fist that was
going to strike out was lowered.</p>
<p>“Old man, who sent you here? How could you know everything about
me?” The young man stared at the fortune-telling old man and
checked him out.</p>
<p>The fortune-telling old man shook his head. “I do want to save
people, but people are always so ignorant. Never mind.”</p>
<p>After that, the fortune-telling old man picked up his shop. He
took the little girl with him as he left. In the meantime, he said
to himself, “God is jealous of geniuses. What a shame…”</p>
<p>“Hang on, what did you mean, old man? At least, tell me.
Otherwise, I am going to break your old teeth. Then, you will never
talk crap again.” The young man reached out his hand and stopped
the two from leaving.</p>
<p>The fortune-telling old man sighed and said, “I am afraid you
will not believe me even if I do tell you. How about this? I will
give you one tidbit. You do not have to pay for it. If it is
useful, it will be a pleasure of mine. If it is not useful, neither
of us loses a thing.”</p>
<p>After that, the old man took out a rope and gave it to the young
man.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The young man accepted the rope with
suspicion. It seemed to be an ordinary rope. It was less than 9
feet long with small threading.</p>
<p>If it was not for the fortune-telling man telling him what
happened, with that young man’s attitude, he would have hanged the
old man with the rope. The old man said, “Put the rope around your
waist and put the other on the gene race. Then, you will find
out.”</p>
<p>“Fine. I will see what you are up to. If this is a waste of
time, I am going to come back and break your stupid mouth. Someone
come here and keep an eye on this old man.” Because of what the
young man shouted, a few big men appeared. They prohibited the old
man and the young girl from leaving.</p>
<p>“I have stuff to do. If it does not work, when I come back, you
are very dad.” After the young man said that, he jumped atop the
crab’s back. Following the instructions given to him by the old
man, he tied one end of the rope to his waist and the other end
onto the gold crab. He took the crab and sought to leave.</p>
<p>“Hang on. Pull the rope one foot and seven inches shorter.” The
fortune-telling old man stopped the young man.</p>
<p>The young man did not really believe him. No matter what
happened today, no one would have been able to see it. There was no
way for others to know. The fortune-telling old man spoke
correctly, which had made him scared. It was hard to believe, which
was why he thought he should give it a go.</p>
<p>The young man pulled the rope shorter and thought, “After I am
done, if this stupid rope does not do anything, I am going to break
his mouth.”</p>
<p>Just as he just tied up the rope, the gold crab turned around
and started to spin extremely fast. The young man fell from the
crab’s back. The young man’s eyes opened wide. He saw himself
almost fall on the ground. His waist felt tight. He was only half a
foot away from the ground hanging by the rope.</p>
<p>The young man had a closer look. He quickly broke out into a
cold sweat. There was a sharp rock five inches away from his left
eye. If the rope had not pulled him when he fell, he could have
been blinded.</p>
<p>He thought about the consequences of the rope. The young man’s
legs went soft. He had a cold sweat. He felt like it was too
close.</p>
<p>A few young men surrounded the old man and girl. Many people saw
this. The young man, who had gone around the corner, had come back.
He was running and screaming, “Old Fairy… Old Fairy… Old Fairy you
are like a god…”</p>
