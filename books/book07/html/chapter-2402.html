<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He didn’t mind hearing about deifieds,
but he really did mind hearing the word “God.”</p>
<p>This sensitivity came from his time in the sanctuaries. Since he
first entered the sanctuaries, he had come to despise the word
“God.” Even hearing it would put him in a bad mood for a long
time.</p>
<p>Especially when it came to the events with the Seventh Team.
They had really affected Han Sen.</p>
<p>“This guy cannot be the god that claims to grant wishes, can
he?” Han Sen stared at the man who sat atop the stone platform, and
he really thought that this man had to be the one he had heard so
much about.</p>
<p>Plus, the black crystal armor’s reaction made Han Sen much more
alarmed.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of any of the Extreme King dying in this
Destiny’s Tower. People claim to learn a lot from their time in the
tower. No matter what is said about this place, there is never a
hint of something fatal residing inside. Otherwise, with so many
people having already entered this place, at least one of them
should have died,” Han Sen thought to himself. “No wonder each of
the Extreme King learns something different inside the tower,
though. There is no geno art here. There is just this living
god.”</p>
<p>Han Sen froze, and he didn’t answer. The man asked again, “Young
man, do you believe that God exists in this world?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen answered with certainty. But inside, he thought,
“Of course, I believe. Han’s big brother is Dollar God.”</p>
<p>The man nodded, and he went on to say, “If I told you I was God,
would you believe me?”</p>
<p>“I would,” Han Sen said, feigning cooperation. He wanted that
man to keep talking. After all the time Han Sen had spent tracking
down bits and pieces of this man’s exploits, he badly wanted to
know what the man’s true goal was, or where he might have come
from.</p>
<p>The man didn’t seem impressed or concerned by Han Sen’s answer,
though. His expression hadn’t changed, and he still smiled. “It is
a fated meeting that you have come here to speak with me. I can
fulfill one wish for you. You can say whatever you want, as it
should be something deep in your heart. You only have one chance.
No matter what you say, it will be fulfilled. But you cannot change
what you wish for.”</p>
<p>“This guy is just like King Qun,” Han Sen chuckled darkly in his
heart. He looked at the man.</p>
<p>“I can make any wish?” Han Sen asked, looking at the man.</p>
<p>“Any wish that you desire. God can do anything,” the man said
calmly.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned, and he didn’t speak. Making a wish seemed like
a simple process, but there were many traps. Each member of the
Seventh Team from the Alliance had made a wish, but before the end,
each one of them had regretted their wish. Something disastrous
that they never expected had befallen them.</p>
<p>For instance, Han Sen could wish for a lot of money. God would
set up an accident and drop a lot of money right into his lap.
Things would seem great, until it eventually came out that the
money had belonged to a psychotic killer. While Han Sen would
indeed be the recipient of great fortune for a time, he would
eventually be killed by that psychotic killer.</p>
<p>God was supposed to be an abstract concept. Once people made
their wishes to God, they were supposed to move on with their
lives, not linger in the moment.</p>
<p>If people really thought that God was a person who granted
wishes like this man, it would be very dangerous.</p>
<p>If someone believed in God, then they believed that God was a
real force in the world. Every action he took would have
ramifications in the world. He wouldn’t just be able to make
something out of nothing.</p>
<p>So, whatever wish a person made should be something that already
existed inside the universe someplace. These items would, of
course, have a pre-established connection to the universe. Any rare
item that someone wished for would be deeply associated with the
workings of the world.</p>
<p>Han Sen used to think that, if God really existed and he could
really fulfill wishes, then he might be a special sort of lifeform
that had Causal powers.</p>
<p>A person had to wish for something they wanted, but the
consequences of the item might befall the wisher. So, the rarer the
item was, the greater the consequences could be. The price that had
to be paid could be huge.</p>
<p>If a person wished for ten thousand dollars, and that ten
thousand dollars were with a mother who wanted to heal her ailing
son, and that ten thousand dollars were then given to the wisher,
the son would die from lack of treatment. That death and that
mother’s hatred would end up on the wisher.</p>
<p>If the wisher was greedy and wished for one million dollars, the
wish might hurt one hundred lives. The wisher would be hated by a
hundred families. Having one hundred different families seeking
revenge against you would be a high price to pay.</p>
<p>Those were just Han Sen’s predictions and guesses, though. They
might not have actually been true, but according to what happened
to the Seventh Team, the guesses were in the realm of
possibilities.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if someone wished for immortality or a return
to their youth; every wish had its price. That price also took away
the governance of a person’s own life and death. Perhaps it was
because there were too many consequences, but sometimes, not even
death brought freedom from the consequences of a wish. They would
have to continue their miserable existence to pay back the
debt.</p>
<p>“If this theory is correct, then everyone who entered this
Destiny’s Tower should have paid a price. But I haven’t heard of
any misfortunes among the people who have come here. Why?” Han Sen
frowned.</p>
<p>The guy that was claiming to be God noticed Han Sen’s continued
silence. He smiled and said, “You can think about what you wish to
want to make. There are forty-eight God pictures. They all have my
will in them. You can go and take a look. Perhaps they will help
you decide. That will be the first gift I give you. When you have
thought of the wish you seek to make, come to me and I will make it
come true.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t leave. He looked at the man and asked, “If I make
a wish, do I have to pay something back in made?”</p>
<p>The man continued smiling and said, “You will.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised that the man answered. He had thought the
self-proclaimed God wouldn’t admit this, even if asked. Han Sen
immediately followed up his question.</p>
<p>“What do I need to give you?”</p>
<p>The man looked at Han Sen and didn’t answer the question. “You
are not the first person to ask me this question. And you surely
won’t be the last. I can answer you, but if I answer, you must make
a wish. Do you agree?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought for a brief moment, and then said seriously, “I
agree.”</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, “The wish you make will be fulfilled,
and that is because it is what you deserve.”</p>
<p>“It is what I deserve? If I want a hundred wives, that means the
wives will already have been my wives? What sense does that make?”
Han Sen was frozen. What the man said was something Han Sen
couldn’t accept, but when he thought about it some more, his breath
caught. He now knew why the man would say this.</p>
<p>What the man had said was reversed. If you tried to understand
it in reverse, then the sentence made sense. But the Causal
relationship reversed it.</p>
