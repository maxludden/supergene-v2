“Okay, you can go.” The leader of Sky Palace waved his hand, indicating Han Sen could leave.

Cough cough. “Mister Leader, you are so powerful. With a flick of your fingers, you can inhibit all my movements. That is impressive.” Han Sen’s feet did not move.

It felt as if his body was carrying a mountain. He could barely stand.

Sky Palace leader squinted his eyes, looked at Han Sen, and said, “This is my reward for you. If you do not leave, I will reward you more.”

Han Sen turned around and departed, swearing to God he would never come and see that man again.

“Fuck! What is this reward? I did a great service to these people. It’d be fine if they didn’t want to reward me, but making me feed horses? I don’t want to feed your f*cking horses.” After Han Sen left Sky Palace, he repeatedly swore in his heart.

Walking out of Sky Palace made Han Sen all sweaty. He did not know what geno art was being used on him, but it felt like he was bearing a great weight on his back. He could withstand it, but he was not able to run. All he could do was walk.

“What is it? What did the leader give you?” Thousand Feather Crane asked, coming forward eagerly.

“Let’s not talk about it. When my master was in Sky Palace, did she offend the leader in some way?” Han Sen thought that it must be Yisha’s fault that he was being treated so poorly.

“Why do you ask that? The leader loved her the most. He took her as a student, so everyone knows that,” Thousand Feather Crane said.

That is strange. If my master was that loved, then why did he not reward me? He used a weird geno art to suppress my body, and he’s now making me feed his horses.” Han Sen frowned, and then went on to say, “Is he really mad that he could not take me on as a student, perhaps?”

“What happened?” Thousand Feather Crane asked.

Han Sen told him his story. Thousand Feather Crane heard it all, and when the story was finished, his mouth had fallen wide open. He looked at Han Sen as if he had just seen a ghost.

“Don’t you think that this is a little much?” Han Sen also thought to himself, “I only complained in my mind, so why is he going this far?”

Thousand Feather Crane gave Han Sen a strange look. “You are lucky. The geno art you were put under is Sky Heart Lock. It is a part of the Textless Book. King classes can barely make use of it, and they often end up damaged. If they did not have the right blood, they wouldn’t even try to use it. It is difficult to find someone that knows about Textless Book and sacrifices. The leader has used it twice on you, and not even Lone Bamboo was subjected to that.”

Han Sen felt his eyebrows rise. “Really?”

“Of course. Sky Heart Lock is no secret here. It locks down your body, and you have to use your own power to break free. Do it, and your fitness and air can increase. You know how important the basics are. You can do this to become stronger, and it won’t affect your leveling up progress. Many people would actually enjoy that. You’ve received it twice, and here you are complaining. It makes me want to hit you.” Thousand Feather Crane looked jealous.

Han Sen looked at him strangely and said, “What about feeding the horses? That can’t be good.”

“If I am correct, the horse you’ll be feeding is the Dream Beast. I cannot tell you if that is good or bad, though,” Thousand Feather Crane said, after a moment of thought.

While they were talking, a butler-like man approached. He bowed to Han Sen and said, “Brother Han, the leader has requested that I take you to Dream Island. You will have to work for Dream Beast for three months. Can you go now or must you pack?”

“Brother, can I go tomorrow?” Han Sen asked.

“Sure, I’ll pick you up tomorrow.” The man smiled.

“Thanks a lot.” Han Sen turned back to Thousand Feather Crane and said, “Old Crane, find me a way to get back to Jade Island. With my weight, the legless crane cannot carry me.”

Thousand Feather Crane laughed and said, “Don’t worry, the lock is only clamping down on your body. It hasn’t increased your weight. Your mount won_t suffer because of it.__

Han Sen had no choice but to believe him. He climbed atop the crane with his heavy body. The crane felt nothing, and it took off into flight as it usually did.

The bird had eaten many pieces of high class xenogeneic meat. It was really strong, and it was flying a little faster than it had in the beginning.

Its speed had only increased a little, though. Its wings were still injured, and so it couldn’t fly entirely straight. It couldn’t go too fast.

When Han Sen was back at little Jade Island, he used all kinds of powers to try to remove the lock that had been placed upon him. Aside from using super god spirit mode, he tried everything at his disposal and failed to unlock it.

Han Sen had no choice now but to pack. The next day, the butler took him to Dream Island.

Han Sen did not know much about Dream Beast. He knew it was a deified xenogeneic, though, and Lone Bamboo had endured the nightmares given to him by this creature.

“Is that old man going to make the Dream Beast give me ten thousand nightmares? I don’t want to experience those things. My life is a happy story. There is no need for tragedy,” Han Sen thought with fright.

It took Lone Bamboo ten years to wake up. Even if Han Sen was stronger, it’d still take a few years. And by then, Ling’er wouldn’t even know who her father was. That would be sad.

“No, no! I cannot have a nightmare. I need to talk to that old man again.” Han Sen turned around, wanting to leave.

But then, all of a sudden, a gravelly, monstrous voice said from behind him, “Who said you could leave?”

Han Sen’s body froze stiff. He slowly turned back around, and at the center of a mirror-like lake, a white unicorn-like creature was emerging.

It might have been the greatest xenogeneic Han Sen had ever seen, but when he looked into its eyes, Han Sen felt chills roll through him. Looking at the creature did not make him feel good.

The dreamy blue eyes, however, were smiling. Even so, they gave him goosebumps.

“Ahaha. Mister Dream… The leader sent me here to check on whether or not you need anything. If there is something you require, I will report it to the leader and bring it here,” Han Sen said quickly. He thought he should get out now.

“I see. There is something I need. Come here.” The Dream Beast stepped onto the grass, smiling at Han Sen.
