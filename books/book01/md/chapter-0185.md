  Han Sen did not have time to explain to Wang Dongling. He summoned his mutant three-eyed beast mount and called Wang Mengmeng, "Mengmeng, let’s go."

Han Sen had seen what the sacred-blood fox king could do, and these black-feathered beasts might also have a king like that. Constantly seeing them around gave him a bad feeling. Since he had taken Wang Mengmeng here, he needed to be responsible for the safety, not to mention the trust she placed in him.

"Sister, let’s go together?" Wang Mengmeng summoned her big white bear, and asked Haungfu Pingqing.

Huangfu nodded and summoned her mount, following the two.

Wang Dongling had to summon his mount and follow them. He murmured, "Just a few black-feathered beasts. What’s to be afraid about?"

Han Sen simply ignored him, and guarded Wang Mengmeng run at full speed. Half an hour later, the sky darkened.

It was day time and in a desert, but the sun was suddenly gone. The black-feathered beasts rushed toward them like bats.

The four were filled with aghast. This group was even bigger than last time. They must be more than ten thousand. Among them many had wings like iron, which indicated they were mutant.

Among the black-feathered beasts, there was a red one over nine feet long and its wingspan more than 60 feet roaring and snapping.

In its roar, the horrifying black-feathered beasts were like soldiers, launching organized attacks at them.

"A scared-blood black-feathered beast!" Huangfu cried.

Wang Dongling's face was grim. He summoned beast soul armor, his white wings and a pair of beast soul knives, throwing himself at the black-feathered beasts. He seemed to plan to get rid of the black-feathered beast king first.

But Han Sen put away his mutant mount and jumped on the big white bear’s back. He shouted, "Mengmeng, to the southeast cliff."

Wang Mengmeng rode the big white bear at full speed over there. Standing on the bear’s back, Han Sen summoned his horn bow and mutant black stinger arrows, aiming at the black-feathered beasts.

Huangfu did not expect Han Sen to act so decisively. She threw a glance at Wang Dongling who was in the center of the beasts and urged her mount to follow Han Sen and Wang Mengmeng. In the mean time, she summoned beast soul bow and arrows, and turned back to shoot at the beasts from time to time. Her archery skills were truly great, and she had more than one beast soul arrows. With her mount carrying her at full speed, she managed to shoot seven beast soul arrows at the same time, killing the seven black-feathered beasts closest to her.

Han Sen did not mind her. Whenever there was a black-feathered beast coming close, he would simple whack it with her horn bow. With the geno points he had, he had unparalleled strength. Although the bow was no blade, it was still sacred-blood and blew the black-feathered beasts away instantaneously. None could approach the white bear.

Huangfu’s mount had great speed and kept up with the white bear, sharing the protection from Han Sen. At least she did not need to worry about beasts on his side.

Wang Dongling regretted immediately after flying among the black-feathered beasts. There were simply too many of them, groups of mutant black-feathered beasts surrounded him, leaving him no chance to approach the sacred-blood one. His situation was highly risky.

Although he had a pair of knives and was using them to the extreme, he could not block the black-feathered beasts coming at him in all directions. One got a chance and bit on his unprotected thigh.

"Ouch!" Wang Dongling screamed and kicked the beast away, turning around to run.

But the group of mutant black-feathered beasts would never let him go easily. Flapping their iron wings, they snapped at him and he was stuck in a bloody fight. Soon his skin was ripped apart everywhere and blood was welling.

At this time, Han Sen and Wang Mengmeng had rushed to the cliff which was more than 60 feet tall, standing aloof in the sand like a yellow cake.

"The bastards are too fast. We can’t run away. Let’s fight them here." At a corner, Han Sen carried Wang Mengmeng and jumped down from the big white bear’s back. He turned his back to the cliff and stood in front of Wang Mengmeng. Having summoned a black chopper, he slashed at a black-feathered beast coming at them, cutting it in half.

This was one of the two mutant beast souls he gained from Gu Ming. It was called the Beast Chopper and was much more useful in a melee like this than lighter weapons.

Huangfu Pingqing also jumped off her mount and came next to Han Sen and summoned a pair of daggers, fighting off the black-feathered beasts. She knew that if they fought as a team, there might be a chance for them to survive, whereas she would be doomed if fighting alone.

But even if they were against the rock and did not need to worry about attacks coming from behind, Huangfu still felt her hearting racing. She regretted taking the risk alone. Wang Dongling had some strength, but no brain, and was by no means helpful.

"Ah!" Wang Dongling’s screamed and screamed, making the three’s hearts sink.

But they did not have much energy to think about him, as they could barely deal with the overwhelming black-feathered beasts.

Blood soon colored the rocks and sand on the ground red. The bodies of the black-feathered beasts almost buried Han Sen and the girls, limiting their space of movements.

Bang!

Suddenly a bloody body fell from above in front of the three. It was a headless body, and looked like it belonged to Wang Dongling.

And in the sky, the black-feathered beast king was grabbing the head of Wang Dongling, and let out a cry of triumph.

The scene sent a chill down Huangfu’s spine. Her face became grim as she felt doomed.
