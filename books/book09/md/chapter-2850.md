The history of the Return Empty Scabbard was something special. It was a bone torn from the body of Sky Armor God.

Back then, only a very few core superiors knew that the rib bone of Sky Armor God was actually his god's personality. It was not a complete god's personality though. Only a part of it had been cut out as Sky Armor God escaped, so the rib bone was not a complete god's personality. There was no sign of a god's sadness manifesting afterward either. If the god's personality had been cut out of the man completely, and a god's sadness showed up, Knife King would've become super famous all around the universe.

Since only a part of the rib bone was cut, Knife King knew he had injured his enemy a lot. Je was an elite who could go to the geno hall. Unfortunately, he succumbed and died to sickness.

Sky Armor God was damaged because of this. After the god's personality was damaged, it took him many years to recover. When he returned to the Extreme King, the Extreme King was not controlled by him anymore. Under Knife King's training, there were a few more true god class elites in the race. Sky Armor God was unable to find the right opportunity to allow him to dominate the race again. Thus, he used a trick with the god doll inside Destiny's Tower. He tried to make the Extreme King fall under his command again.

Han Sen had destroyed the god doll. Because Han Jinzhi was in the middle of that mess, Sky Armor God thought it was Empty God who had destroyed his god doll. So, he harbored a hatred for Empty God too.

Sky Armor God had been looking for that rib bone Knife King had cut off, but he had never been able to find where it was.

The people of the Extreme King knew that Knife King had turned the rib bone into a scabbard for Knife King to store his Return Empty Knife. When Knife King passed, the Return Empty Knife remained. The Return Empty Scabbard, however, was missing. The Extreme King searched for it for a while, but they could not find out where the Return Empty Scabbard had gone.

They would never have thought the Return Empty Scabbard was hidden inside another scabbard or that it was in the possession of an outsider.

Inside a temple, Sky Armor God opened his eyes. He stared at the Return Empty Scabbard Han Sen was holding. "My rib bone. It has been so many years. I have finally found you. It is now the time to get you back."

After a while, Sky Armor God looked away from the Return Empty Scabbard. He looked at Han Sen and coldly said, "He is just a larva class xenogeneic. I just need to possess someone else in the universe. It will be easy to kill him that way."

Sky Armor God frowned and said, "He is in the geno god list now. If he leaves the geno god list, I cannot find out where he comes from."

He went silent. Sky Armor God looked at the geno god list's matchups. He saw Dollar and Knife Queen's names together. He looked lower and saw Han Sen's next match was against a butterfly deified xenogeneic that was famous.

"If things are this way, I will get my rib bone back through the geno god list." Sky Armor God stared at Han Sen and the Return Empty Scabbard.

Han Sen did not know where the Return Empty Scabbard came from, but the presence that came from the Return Empty Scabbard sure felt similar to the presence of Sky Vine Radish and Evil Lotus God's spirit gene.

Han Sen thought, Weird. Is this scabbard made from the material of god spirit's god personality? I don't think the Rebate alpha had that sort of money.

"It is no wonder the alpha took the scabbard so seriously," Yisha said with a frown. She did not strike again. "The scabbard is that mysterious. The power of the scabbard seems to go against the teeth knife power. Even my modified teeth knife is restricted by this scabbard."

Teeth power was being suppressed by the scabbard. Yisha's fighting power was reduced. Beating Dollar would be harder now.

Han Sen looked at Yisha and knew what she was thinking about. He smiled and said, "It looks like your power is being restricted by the scabbard."

"So what?" Yisha raised her eyebrows. Her hands generated another mass of teeth power. She raised it and pointed it at Han Sen. She was not going to give up. She was going to keep fighting.

Suddenly, Han Sen's movements shocked everyone in the audience. He flipped his hands over and threw the scabbard to Yisha. The scabbard flew right to her and landed on Yisha's teeth knife.

All the audience was in shock. Even if they did not know what the Return Empty Scabbard was, they were all able to tell that it was a powerful treasure. It was able to restrict Knife Queen's scary knife air. Dollar had casually thrown the Return Empty Scabbard to her. It was hard to understand.

Even Yisha was shocked by this move. She stared at Han Sen and asked, "What is that supposed to mean?"

Dollar had a scabbard that could put a lid on her powers. He could have easily won with it, so he did not have to be this nice.

"Such knife skills are impressive," Han Sen said with a smile. "If you were to lose on behalf of a scabbard, it would be a shame. It does not matter if I win. I will lend you the scabbard for now. Next time I defeat you, I will take it back."

"Holy crap! This guy is too cocky. How can he play like this?"

"This is insane. He seems to have forgotten that Knife Queen was attacking him a lot earlier."

"You guys don't know anything. He is obviously hitting on her. That Dollar must have a crush on Knife Queen. Otherwise, why would he give the scabbard to Knife Queen so easily? He might not be able to defeat Knife Queen. Even if he could, Knife Queen could leave the battleground with the scabbard. He would be powerless to stop her."

"Judging from what you are saying, I believe it makes sense. How dare he flirt with his opponent in the geno god list. This guy is really daring."

"Actually... He is quite handsome... If a deified elite did this to me, I would marry him."

"Stop dreaming. Why would a deified elite want someone like you?"

...

Every spirit was talking. Yisha coldly stared at Han Sen for a while. She did not say anything. She slowly brought out teeth knife.

Knife air was like silk. It was cutting the sky and breaking the ground.

Yisha's power was stronger than before. Even Yisha was surprised. The power of the scabbard was enough to restrict her teeth power. In her hands, it was able to boost the teeth power output.

By just holding the scabbard, Yisha's teeth knife received a strong boost.

Back then, the Rebate alpha came into possession of the Return Empty Scabbard by accident. She never learned the secret of the Return Empty Scabbard, but she was able to understand the knife mind inside the scabbard. With it, she created teeth powers and teeth knife.

The origin of teeth powers came from the Return Empty Scabbard. Now, Yisha had the Return Empty Scabbard. She was like a tiger that had been given wings, but the teeth power's effect was a few times stronger.

If she was able to understand the Return Empty Scabbard's power, she would improve a lot.

"Oh, no. Oh, no. This kid Dollar was too cocky. Knife Queen has the scabbard's help. Her power is much stronger now. She might be able to beat a butterfly elite like this. Dollar has suffered bad luck..." Wang Yuhang was happy.

"It was because he was trying to hit on women during the god fights. He deserves it," Tang Zhenliu said with a smile. He really envied it. "What is this? It should be me, Old Tang hitting on girls. Right now, Dollar is stealing all the thunder. No, I must become deified. In the next geno god list fight, I am going to flirt with more than a few deified xenogeneic ladies..."
