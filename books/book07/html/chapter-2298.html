<h2>Deified Speed</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2298</h3>

<p>There were many things that couldn’t be truly understood by
merely reading a book; instead, they had to be figured out by each
individual. The teachings of the Xuan Men were this sort of
knowledge.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned to find a few people that could research the
Xuan Men information on his behalf and determine what content might
be suitable for humans to learn. He also wanted to establish a
special school in the Alliance that would teach the Xuan Men
techniques to other humans. He wanted to pass on the knowledge and
expand the lineage of the Xuan Men.</p>
<p>It was just as Mister White had said: if one or two people in
every ten million were able to follow the righteous path of Xuan
Men, then that would be enough.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Ji Yanran expressed an interest in the subject.
Han Sen quickly turned the project over to her.</p>
<p>But Ji Yanran didn’t do as Han Sen hoped. Instead of building a
school for the purpose of teaching the Xuan Men philosophy, she
opened up a Martial Hall. In it, she would start by teaching the
Xuan Men martial arts, whereas the philosophies of the Xuan Men way
would be taught at a later time.</p>
<p>“No one will treasure something that is earned very easily. And
the Xuan Men way of thinking is not suitable for everyone. It
requires too much heart. By teaching them this way, the
philosophies are likely to be accepted by more people,” Ji Yanran
explained.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran’s line of thinking made sense to Han Sen. He had only
learned the secret techniques of the Xuan Men, anyway. He didn’t
actually understand the core concepts of the Xuan Men way himself.
Potential students would have absolutely no experience with the
Xuan Men techniques going in, so it would likely be a waste of time
for them to learn. Not many people would ever be able to understand
this stuff.</p>
<p>“If we can’t even start a school, do you really think your
Martial Hall will work?” Han Sen asked, purely to be contrary.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran laughed. “This will be easy. We only need your big
face for an advertisement, and our doors will be swarmed with
upper-class socialites begging to sign up. They only need to hear
that these techniques were practiced by the great Han Sen. I wager
they’d fight to the death and use any trick in the book to get
their kids accepted into our Martial Hall.”</p>
<p>“Mister White’s intention was to see the Xuan Men expanded. If
you approach things like this, you are only serving the needs of
the upper-class.” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran laughed and said, “Don’t worry. Over the years, most
ideas start with high society. Once an idea has been accepted by
the wealthy and powerful, it is more easily disseminated to the
lower class. This is especially true when it comes to the ideals of
the Xuan Men. In ancient times, famous philosophers and scholars
would embark on lengthy journeys to convince people of all
different societal levels of their ideals. Now, we just need time
and advertisements.”</p>
<p>“Honey, don’t work yourself to the bone. You should bring on
some added help.” Han Sen could not be bothered to help her
himself, of course. If she was willing to shoulder the
responsibility, then that was fine with him.</p>
<p>The box Han Sen had taken from Holy Town was locked, so he
couldn’t open it. He had tried to pry it open in many different
ways, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>Even Yisha’s power had been insufficient to break the jade stone
box. Because Han Sen hadn’t been able to find out what was inside,
he put the box away for the moment.</p>
<p>Instead, he turned his attention to the bone needle. It was the
one Han Sen took from the palace maze. There were twelve drops of
deified blood still inside it. They represented twelve different
deified blood pulses.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not use them. First, he wanted to research them.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen’s body still contained more Ghost Bone power
than he could use, he currently had no need for the energy that the
deified blood pulses offered.</p>
<p>He pondered the blood pulses for a while, and he eventually
decided to have a drop anyway.</p>
<p>Han Sen chose to consume the drop he had retrieved from the
Blood Demon. It was of the blood element. He wanted to see if it
might help his Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted the bone needle above his chest. And then, he
thrust it into his heart.</p>

<p>The bone needle pierced right through his heart, and a drop of
deified blood spilled into him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was about to begin refining the deified blood when he
suddenly heard an announcement play in his head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Successful infusion of deified gene. Deified gene +1. Deified
progress is 1/100.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that announcement, Han Sen felt a scary power explode in
his heart and sweep into every corner of his body. His cells
shuddered as the new power surged through him, and he began to
change.</p>
<p>His body felt like he was shedding, sloughing off layer upon
layer of old cells. This entire process lasted a whole day before
coming to an end. Trails of a black substance littered the floor,
like the flaky remains of a dead snake. It looked quite scary.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked. He did not know what “deified progress”
meant.</p>
<p>“Are deified genes different from the genes that come before?
What does ‘deified progress’ mean? Does this mean I will be deified
once the number reaches a hundred? I can achieve deified status
without maxing out any other genes?” Han Sen could not figure out
what was going on.</p>
<p>Han Sen studied himself after receiving his one deified gene.
His body had changed. It was like his genes had all improved. What
hadn’t improved, though, was his fitness. It was still at the level
of a Duke.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to refine another deified drop of blood. The
process was exactly the same. Han Sen’s body changed again, and he
received an additional deified gene point. His deified progress
became 2/100. His fitness did not increase much.</p>
<p>But if he was able to earn deified genes, that meant it was a
power that humans could accept. That relaxed many of Han Sen’s
worries, and he absorbed the rest of the deified blood.</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, Han Sen refined his deified blood. His
deified progress became 12/100, and after the refining process, his
fitness increased by quite a bit.</p>
<p>But strangely, Han Sen didn’t gain any special blood pulse
powers after receiving the deified blood pulses.</p>
<p>“Where can I get more deified genes? Once I reach one hundred, I
guess I’ll be able to find out what it does,” Han Sen thought to
himself. It would be too difficult to kill deified beings by
himself, though. At his current strength, it was an impossible
task.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that the little red bird ate my Sun Raven. If it
hadn’t, I could have given it a try. Perhaps I could eat the flesh
of deified creatures,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Thinking about the little red bird, Han Sen checked on the egg
inside the bird’s nest again. Han Sen was shocked. A number of
weird substance chains had appeared from the nest and were drilling
into the red egg. The red color of the egg was shining brightly, as
if it was being consumed by a red fire.</p>
