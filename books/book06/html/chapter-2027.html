<p>The group saw Han Sen and approached him. One of them was a
Buddha, and one of them had purple horns. He was a Demon.</p>
<p>The others were comprised of different races. In total, there
were six of them.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! Mister Han, I cannot believe we have met here once
again.” The Buddha, seeing Han Sen, looked murderous. “I didn’t
expect to see you guys here, either.” Han Sen sat where he was, not
moving. He wanted to rest some more.</p>
<p>You are Han Sen?” The man of the Demon looked at Han Sen with
interest.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked back at the man, guessing he was the Sharon that
Hai’er had told him so much about. Unlike Lone Bamboo, Sharon was a
born genius. He was far better than those of the same level, and he
had apparently never failed at anything.</p>
<p>He had learned all of his geno arts quickly, and he had also
been known to improve techniques and skills. That was why he was so
good.</p>
<p>Sharon was a rare person who possessed two geno arts. He had
studied the Demon’s Sky-Demon Sutra and another mysterious geno
art. He had been buffed twice, so he really was quite strong.</p>
<p>According to Hai’er, he made a gamble with every opponent that
was of the same level. He had never lost once. He was expected to
become deified, one day.</p>
<p>“Not bad. I am Han Sen. Who are you?” Han Sen asked, looking at
Sharon. He didn’t care if it was Sharon or not, he just wanted to
keep up the small talk so he could rest.</p>
<p>“I am Sharon of the Demon,” Sharon answered.</p>
<p>The Buddha next to Han Sen then said, “Mister Han, it looks like
you’ve just been through a big fight. Is there an Ancient God
statue nearby?”</p>
<p>“So what if there is?” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“Did you get the Beginning of Ancient God?” The people’s eyes
went bright as they kept checking Han Sen out.</p>
<p>“If I got it, would I still be here?” Han Sen lifted his lips
and gave the Buddha a disdainful look.</p>
<p>“I see. Then let’s go for a walk,” the Buddha said to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Why would I lead you?” Han Sen asked icily.</p>
<p>“That is not up to you to decide!” shouted a member of their
party. It had six legs, and its steel-like hands reached out to
grab Han Sen.</p>
<p>Green smoke rose from its hand and formed into a big claw. It
was going to sink the claw into Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move, though. He waited until the green claw had
almost reached him, and then he pulled out Blood Feather Knife and
swung it at the green claw.</p>
<p>The six-legged person shot the knife a dismissive glance. He was
a Marquise, so he didn’t take the Earl class Han Sen seriously. He
was still going to press forward with his attack with the green
claw.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The power put into the Blood Feather Knife was sufficient to lop
the green claw off. And it didn’t end there. The knife went forward
to strike the six-legged creature directly.</p>
<p>The six-legged creature did not expect an Earl to be that
powerful. It was too late for him to try to dodge the strike now.
And then, his body was cut through at the waist. It went all the
way, lopping him in two. It didn’t immediately kill him, though,
and he kept screaming from the ground until the Teeth powers
finished him off.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. No one underestimated Han Sen now, and
they all looked at him with caution.</p>
<p>But they didn’t fall back. Instead, the rest spread out to
encircle Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Teeth Knife is strong,” Sharon complimented.</p>
<p>“Killing a yahoo like that is nothing,” Han Sen said
expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Mister Sharon, there is no use in talking with him. Let’s take
him down,” the Buddha said.</p>
<p>Sharon did not move, however. He smiled and said, “I have heard
Han Sen killed Seven Spirit while in your heaven. Infinite Buddha,
you should not get involved.”</p>
<p>“He is such a horrible person. We should kill him without a
second thought,” Infinite Buddha said.</p>
<p>“It is still wrong to pawn off your work on others. Perhaps you
should end this yourself. What do you guys think?” Han Sen looked
at the other creatures.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” A few of them nodded.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha’s face changed, but only for a second. And then,
he said the Buddha catchphrase. “Amitabha! Then I will do it.”</p>
<p>After that, Infinite Buddha threw a slap towards Han Sen. A
bunch of stars came out of his hand, flying towards Han Sen like a
renegade solar system.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Blood Feather Knife still, and he used Tusk to
fight the incoming stars. But when the knife air hit the stars, it
was like it actually entered space and disappeared into the void.
Nothing was able to hurt the stars.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Infinite Buddha was not as famous as Seven
Spirit, but his skills were good. He shouldn’t have underestimated
the power of those stars that possessed space energy.</p>
<p>The stars landed on Han Sen, and he still hadn’t moved. He used
Blood Feather Knife to draw a circle. The star power was sucked
into it.</p>
<p>And then, Han Sen flipped over his hands. The circle drawn by
the knife expelled the stars, launching them back towards Infinite
Buddha. That was his reversing technique.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha’s face changed. He shouted and summoned a lotus
beneath his feet. He dodged the knife circle with stars, while
throwing more stars back at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat on a rock and drew some knife circles with his
knife. He used Infinite Buddha’s attacks to fight back.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha used a whole host of geno arts, but nothing he
did seemed able to break Han Sen’s knife circle. He could not even
make Han Sen move from the spot.</p>
<p>“What a powerful Teeth Knife. No wonder it is a cherished
technique of the Rebate. Fighting the Marquise Infinite Buddha as
an Earl? That is scary,” said one of the creatures that was
preventing Han Sen from escaping. It couldn’t help but compliment
his finesse.</p>
<p>Sharon shook his head and said, Teeth Knife is not scary. It is
Han Sen who is.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Teeth Knife is strong. Amongst the Rebate, only Knife
Queen can practice Teeth Knife to the same level. Han Sen is an
outsider to them, and yet he learned a Rebate exclusive skill to
that proficiency. That makes him a scary guy,” said a woman with
dragon horns and black wings.</p>
<p>Infinite Buddha realized that he was unable to kill Han Sen,
despite Han Sen’s obvious exhaustion. He looked enraged. His body
started to glow, then transform into gold.</p>
<p>It was not like Seven Spirit’s four-faced eight-armed Buddha
gold body. He was like an angry King Kong, with stars all around
him.</p>
