    <p>
      Han Sen carefully inspected Xue Yi Yang, not knowing whether he had
      learned. If you were to search people with smooth skin, you&#8217;d find
      that many people&#8217;s skin was like ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seemed as if the people who learned Qi Gong all had skin that appeared
      particularly smooth. That made Han Sen feel more secure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to ask around about the Xue family, but before he could,
      the speech began. Everyone fell quiet, and Han Sen had to swallow his
      questions and turn his attention to the stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first woman who came out to talk was called Lin Wei Wei. He could not
      tell her age, but she looked so elegant that his eyes felt refreshed just
      from looking at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her whole body was like silky jade, and even her hair possessed a halo of
      sparkling cleanliness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Third-World View she spoke of was a classic in Qi Gong. It was
      supposed to be a proper speech, but all she did was stand on stage and
      discuss her own opinions on the subject. She did not even read out the
      sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had never learnt the Third-World View, but hearing Lin Wei
      Wei&#8217;s explanation of the sutra made him happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason why Han Sen could not understand the Dongxuan Sutra was because
      he could not decipher a certain section that was composed of an abstruse
      lexicon. It was extremely difficult to read.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, Lin Wei Wei&#8217;s speech provided comments and explanations
      on the Qi Gong. After Han Sen heard what she had to say, he felt that he
      understood it far better. He was captivated by her talk, and so he perked
      his ears, eager to catch every single word.
    </p>

    <p>
      The events on stage were unlike what he had expected. Ji Yanran had told
      him that Qi Gong started with the legend of the timeline of the seven
      emperors but ended with the Qin timeline. After Qin, no one was quite sure
      why Qi Gong began failing.
    </p>

    <p>
      After it was found again in the God Sanctuary, Qi Gong returned to be
      something well-known.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because it was just some ancient book and codex like the Dongxuan Sutra,
      its contents were incredibly difficult to decipher. Han Sen thought that
      the Qi Gong they spoke about was equally difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after hearing the speech, he noticed the Third-World View Lin Wei Wei
      spoke of had already been translated to the language used by the Alliance.
      It also related well to modern science, and to the God Sanctuary. Even
      people who could not speak or read ancient texts could understand what she
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen had never learnt the Third-World View, hearing her
      comments about the Qi Gong was incredibly beneficial for him. It was
      better than learning the ancient language outright.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was enamored by the proceedings on-stage. According to what Lin
      Wei Wei said, Qi Gong was just another hyper geno art. It just
      wasn&#8217;t like the ordinary types, being designed for humans to
      maximize the potential of their genes instead. It was a hyper geno art
      that could absorb the power of the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core principle of the Qi Gong was allowing a person&#8217;s body to
      absorb and become a vessel for the powers of the universe. It strengthened
      an individual&#8217;s genes.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to recent theories, it took a fitness level of 300 and obtaining
      the status of a Celestial Being to form the baseline of Qi Gong
      requirements. To break through Qi Gong was to break through the fabric of
      your genes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The entrance of the Qi Gong, to use a genetic systematic term, was a
      sudden change in the gene lock. To reach the level of a Celestial Being
      meant an individual had managed to open their gene lock. If you opened a
      gene lock, your genes would take a great leap in evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some Qi Gong, however, you did not need to become a Celestial Being
      before training how to open the gene lock. Very few people would have the
      talent to do this, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      But even if you could not open the gene lock before ascending to the level
      of a Celestial Being, learning Qi Gong was still a way in which you could
      refine your genes. After you opened the gene lock, the changes within your
      genes would be even greater.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Lin Wei Wei concluded her talk about Third-World View, Han Sen was
      still eager to hear more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran noticed how intently Han Sen had paid attention to the speech
      and asked, &#8220;Have you learnt Third-World View?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Han Sen replied.</p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran thought he had couldn&#8217;t have learned it before because
      Third-World View was a Qi Gong codex that was exclusive to the four
      families. It was only natural that he didn&#8217;t know about it. But if
      this was the case, why had he been so focused on the speech?
    </p>

    <p>
      After Lin Wei Wei, it was time for Xue Yi Yang to give his speech. He went
      on stage and began to talk about Ice Heart, a subject which he could
      discuss with great thoroughness. Through a combination of modern science
      and a shelter gene system, Han Sen was able to learn a great deal about
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Ice Heart seemed quite familiar. After hearing Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s
      speech, although Han Sen did not fully learn Ice Heart, his understanding
      of it had undoubtedly reached another level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had not expected the exchange event to be so beneficial to his
      understanding of so many things. The words of their speeches and the
      content of the Dongxuan Sutra flooded his mind. There were many sections
      he had not previously been able to understand, but now did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart was burning; and he wished he could start learning
      Dongxuan Sutra right away. But he continued to patiently and intently
      listen to what was being said on-stage. Perhaps there was even more he
      could learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      A total of thirteen people would give speeches out of the four families.
      Each would make a speech each day for three days. This meant 39 Qi
      Gong&#8217;s learned greatly through the speeches on-stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, each individual&#8217;s commentary and personal review
      colored each on-stage discussion. None of them touched upon the original
      codexes and how to learn them. It would be impossible to learn the codexes
      only through hearing them speak. But the special terms and knowledge that
      comprized Qi Gong is what fascinated Han Sen the most.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Ji Yanran felt it strange that Han Sen was so interested in the
      discussions, it made her happy, all the same. It was nice to see Han Sen
      so engrossed in learning Qi Gong, as it would make it easier for him to
      learn the Ji family&#8217;s Qi Gong in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      The three days of speeches were over far too quickly for Han Sen, and
      although he had learned a fair bit, the speeches hadn&#8217;t gone deep
      enough for his complete satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen retired to take another look at the Dongxuan Sutra, he
      noticed that the speakers had spoken little more than a basic page of the
      sutra. But that was enough for Han Sen to understand the basic fundaments
      of the sutra, and he now understood how to get started with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by the end of the speeches, there was still a lot he did not
      understand and could no longer enquire about, which made him feel
      disappointed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen understood that the people present were only the youngest of
      the four families, so their levels could not be all that high. So their
      own understanding would also be quite limited. Still, he was grateful for
      the benefits he had received, and this was surprising.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dongxue Sutra, I can finally learn it! Although I have only got the
      basics, according to what they have been saying, I should now be able to
      learn how to open the gene lock. The only thing I don&#8217;t know is how
      long it&#8217;ll take for me to get started.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart
      was fixated with the Dongxue Sutra&#8217;s codex basics, his breath almost
      panting, his heart pumped faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Originally, Han Sen had thought the Dongxue Sutra would be really
      difficult to get to grips with. After all, the Qi Gong Lin Wei Wei talked
      about could only open three or four gene locks, but the Dongxue Sutra
      provided ten different entrances. According to the current theory, that
      meant it could open ten gene locks. The difference between the two was
      highly significant.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for the time it usually took to learn these things, Han Sen&#8217;s
      beginning was off to a good start.
