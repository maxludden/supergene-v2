  A bolt of lightning struck through the air. It looked like the sky and the earth were torn in two. All the weapons in the sky were like storms. They had the power to destroy the sky and the earth. Suddenly, they all started to rain down.

Qin Bai was so shocked that he screamed. He held his head and hid behind Thousand Mile Reach.

Thousand Mile Reach developed a wry smile. He did not generate a power to defend them from the weapon rain that could destroy the sky and the earth.

In the next second, the rain of weapons started to hit the ground. They pierced through their bodies, but they did not get hurt. It was like a sky full of screams, explosions, cries, and wails. It created a symphony from hell.

Han Sen and the others saw that the area around them was like a Shura battleground. Countless life forces were killed by the scary weapons. The sky and the earth had been broken by the weapons. The mountains and rivers were cut flat. The life forces dried up, and blood flowed in the river. The sky and the earth were in chaos.

“The legends claim that the Soldier Knife Sky used to be an old arena,” Thousand Mile Reach said. “There was an old god that came to this place to reveal his power. He killed many creatures that dared to disrespect God Spirits. He destroyed the sky and the earth. Because he was so horrible, some marks persist in the air as scars. They still exist now, even after all that time. So, whenever it rains, this is the sort of scene that is witnessed.”

Although he knew it was just a fable, the scene that destroyed the sky and the earth was very scary. There were certainly gods involved. People knew it was just an illusion, but their hearts still felt scorned.

It was pointless for Qin Bai to hide behind Thousand Mile Reach. The impact on his heart was something he alone had to absorb.

Qin Bai looked bad. He almost coughed up blood. He did not expect to see a scene that could break someone’s mind like that. He held his head and cried, “Han Sen save me!”

Han Sen sighed and said, “Mister Crown Prince, there are things other people cannot help you with. You must face these alone. I have a skill here. If you copy it, you should feel better.”

After Han Sen said that, he read a skill to Qin Bai that could soothe his mind. His voice was not too strong, but it was able to be heard over the battleground and other somber acoustics. His voice went into Qin Bai’s ear, enabling him to hear it all.

Qin Bai held his head and shouted, “I feel terrible! How am I supposed to learn anything like this? Hurry up and find a way!” Before reading it out again, Han Sen said, “Because it is this hard for you to endure, that is why you must learn. You need to learn this to accept it. Aside from that, no one can help you. I believe you can do this.”

Qin Bai’s legs shook. His face went pale. He felt as if the blood in his chest was madly rumbling. He was only able to focus on his heart. He gritted his teeth and tried to remember what Han Sen had said. He used the method to soothe his mind and fight against the terribly powerful impact that was damaging the sky and the earth.

Qin Bai was not dumb. In fact, he was very smart. Since he always wanted to play, he never bothered to learn much. Now that he had no choice, he learned really fast. He managed to learn some good things in a short amount of time. Although he still couldn’t fight against a god in an illusion, he still felt much better.

He had tasted something sweet. Now, Qin Bai was doing everything in adherence to what Han Sen had told him. Not long later, the illusion was gone. Qin Bai’s shaking legs went soft. He dropped to the ground in a sitting position.

“Han Sen, your skill works, but it is not too useful. Is there another one?” Qin Bai complained.

“No,” Han Sen said with a smile. “If you think it is useless, it is because you have only just learned it. In a while, it really will become useful.”

“Mister Han is correct,” Thousand Mile Reach said. “Mister Crown Prince, you should practice it some more. In Soldier Knife Sky, there are always some old battle scenes. Sometimes, they can last hours.”

When Qin Bai heard that, his face turned bitter. “If I knew that, I would not have come along. Han Sen, you tricked me.”

Han Sen loudly laughed. “It is kind of difficult, but don’t you also think it is rather interesting? You have always lived in the palace and never seen things like this. When you go back home, if the officers say you are ignorant and young, you can ask them if they have ever been to the Soldier Knife Sky. After that, ask them who is more ignorant.”

When Qin Bai heard that, his face turned bright. He was sick and tired of hearing people call him young and ignorant. Whenever he made a mistake or wanted to do something, the officers would tell Qin Jinzhen. The word they most often used was “ignorant.”

After hearing those two words, Qin Bai felt like punching a wall. In its totality, what Han Sen had same made sense. “Those officers eat weal and wearing nice clothes at home all day,” Qin Bai madly said. “And me? I have been to this dangerous place. They would not dare to call me young or ignorant after these trials.”

Han Sen knew no that matter how much Qin Bai went through, the officers would still call him ignorant and young. There was a difference between being really ignorant and not actually being ignorant. It was always good to experience something new.

“Han Sen, hurry up and tell me more about the skill that I must practice.” Qin Bai couldn’t wait before asking for more.

Although when Qin Bai did things his interest did not last long, in the Soldier Knife Sky, he knew he absolutely had to. Otherwise, if this scene happened again, he would have to suffer again. In fact, most ordinary people were like Qin Bai. If they were not pushed into a corner, they would never notice the true strength they had inside them.

This was why traveling was better than studying books. By studying books, one could get lazy. One could not be lazy on a trip. When one encountered trials and issues, one had no choice but to sort them out. If one did not overcome one’s problems, the punishment would quickly ensue.

Han Sen kept slowly teaching the skill to Qin Bai. The skill was not a geno art. It was just a skill to reinforce one’s mind. It could work in any world.

Qin Bai tried his hardest to learn it this time. Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen nodded. They thought the king had made the right choice. If Qin Bai had not been given the chance to experience all this, he would have never become someone mature and suited to the palace.

He was not like ordinary princes. He was the king’s only son. Qin Jinzhen only had him for a son. There was no pressure, so the whole palace favored him. He had never been tricked, so his development had been slow.

They admired Han Sen, too. No matter if it was the weapon-watching skill or teaching Qin Bai the god-staring skill now, it was all so weird. As they listened to him speak, they learned it too.

Jia Shi Zhen weirdly looked at Han Sen and thought, “Who is this person? What he has learned is like a sky man.”

They had walked a hundred miles when Jian Bu Gu pointed forward and said, “The sword I recall is over there. I cannot believe it is still around.”

Everyone looked to where his finger indicated. They saw an empty grove in the forest of swords. Weapons were everywhere in that realm. For a few dozen miles, the place was empty. No other weapons were seen.

Han Sen glanced at the empty space. A sword was in the center of it.
