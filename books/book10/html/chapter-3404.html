<p>“Perhaps not.” Han Sen coldly dropped his two words and did not
elaborate.</p>
<p>Moment God’s needle and the needle of the sky clock were madly
spinning in reverse. The reversal of time was becoming scarier and
scarier. If an ordinary Break World beast were there, beyond being
turned back into an egg, they would probably be taken back to a
time before their mother was even born and disappear into
space.</p>
<p>“This is a pure time power fight,” an elite watching the fight
said. “It is a real god fight. I wonder which one of them has the
supreme command of time. I suppose we will receive the answer when
the fight is over.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Human King, who had become the leader of the
25th sky, watched the fight. All of the Blood Legion members were
taken to the 25th sky.</p>
<p>A Blood Legion member saw the two of them standing in the flow
of reversed time. It was unclear which one of them had an
advantage, so he said, “Leader, look at Han Sen and Moment God.
Which would you say has the superior command of time power?”</p>
<p>Human King’s eyes were like water, but they looked really shiny
as he said, “It is too early to tell which of the two is winning or
losing. They have not truly tried to show off the full breadth of
their powers yet.”</p>
<p>“They are already such scary time powers. Is that not all of
their power? Are they still hiding some of their powers?” The
members looked at Han Sen and Moment God in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I do not know what kind of power Han Sen is hiding, but Moment
God has yet to use her sub-god power,” Human King said. “She has
not tried her best yet.”</p>
<p>“The two of them are scary. Is this going to trouble our plan?”
An old member looked worried.</p>
<p>“Powerful power might not be our resistance. Perhaps it will end
up being our help.” Human King was not worried. In fact, he
actually smiled.</p>
<p>The group of Blood Legion members and students were all looking
at one another. They knew Human King was confident about being able
to control the geno tablet, but their opponents were very strong.
They thought they would suffer great trouble. They could not think
how something like this would end up helping them.</p>
<p>If Human King was not speaking, the members could not ask
anything. Therefore, all they could do was watch.</p>
<p>The speed of time’s reversal was becoming faster and faster. The
sky clock’s three needles were almost gone. Moment God’s needle was
spinning too.</p>
<p>In the reversal of time, neither of them was moving. They just
looked at each other from afar, weathering the corrosion of
time.</p>
<p>“Moment God’s time god body is not as strong as Han Sen’s body
and its reversal power,” Bury Path God said with shock. He was
currently in Dust Sky.</p>
<p>“What makes you say that?” an elder of the God Chaos Party asked
with some moderate confusion. From what he saw, the powers of
Moment God and Han Sen should have been even. Neither of the two
had displayed any flaws in their performances.</p>
<p>“Look at Moment God’s god clothing,” Bury Path God said.</p>
<p>After Bury Path God said that, all the members of the God Chaos
Party looked at Moment God and her god clothing. The god clothes
were dreamy. It was like they were perfect.</p>
<p>The god clothing looked very holy. It released a shiny god
light. Most elders were not able to discern any problems with
it.</p>
<p>“Bury Path God, is there a problem with the god clothing?” a God
Chaos Party member asked. “Forgive me for being so dumb, but I do
not see an issue with the god clothing.”</p>
<p>The other God Chaos Party members did not ask anything, but they
still looked at Bury Path God with confusion. Clearly, they did not
see the problem with the clothes either.</p>
<p>“Do you not see it?” Bury Path God coldly asked. “The god
clothes are newer than before.”</p>
<p>“Newer?” The people went for a closer look, but they did not see
any difference.</p>
<p>Seeing that they did not spot the issue, Bury Path God said, “If
you guys have a proper look at Moment God’s god clothes, you should
see her god clothes are cleaner. That proves there is a problem.
The time-reversal is working on her clothes. Look at Han Sen. His
clothes have not had any changes. If Moment God does not have any
other powers, this is a fight Han Sen is sure to win.”</p>
<p>The other God Chaos Party members did not think there was an
issue with newer or older clothes, but if Bury Path God had said
there was, they did not think he was incorrect.</p>
<p>“Then, according to the vice president’s opinion, is Han Sen
going to be the victor in this fight?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“Perhaps not. They still haven’t used their true powers yet. It
is too soon to determine which of the two will be a victor.” Bury
Path God squinted his eyes and said to himself. “There should be
time.”</p>
<p>Bury Path God had only just said this when Moment God’s eyes
looked frozen. Her god light blew up and exploded into the sky like
a light shadow rising up from her body.</p>
<p>It was a giant shadow that looked like a dragon. It was just a
shadow. It was not solid. Even so, it made people feel very afraid
of it.</p>
<p>One of its eyes was like a sun, whereas the other was eerily
reminiscent of a moon. The sun and the moon looked like wheels as
they spun. Time was flying. When the sun and moon dragon revealed
itself, Moment God’s time power became even scarier. The needle,
which had already reached a maximum speed, moved even faster.</p>
<p>“This is an Annihilation-class wild sun moon god dragon. It is
the same as Moment God in that it wields a time element. With the
buffing of the sun moon god dragon, Moment God’s time power will be
stronger. That is the benefit of being a main god.” King Qin was
very worried. He did not know if Han Sen, who ruled the God of
Wealth Temple, could fight Moment God, who was a main god.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not bother summoning a sub-god for a boon. Moment
God’s body wielded an even scarier shadow. Another sub-god buffing
power landed. It was a jade cicada. It screamed. One of its wings
displayed an old word that read “spring,” and the other wing had a
word that meant “autumn.”</p>
<p>“It is a spring autumn cicada. It is another time-element wild
god.” Many of the elites watching the fight were in shock, but this
was not the end. Moment God kept flashing with scary lights. Many
light shadows appeared. They were all powerful time wild gods.
There were 10 of them. Each of the god shadows was as strong as the
sun moon god dragon.</p>
<p>As the 10 sub-gods’ powerful powers buffed Moment God, it made
her power stronger. It made the time power scarier.</p>
<p>The needle was spinning fast. It was moving faster than the sky
clock. It became a main reverse power.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>The reversal of time suddenly went forward. Everything in the
reverse time went back to normal, including the stone clocks. Time
Sky’s stone clocks were shaking because of the reverse power. All
of the stone clock powers were being reversed.</p>
