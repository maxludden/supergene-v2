<h2>Taking It All for Himself</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2108</h3>

<p>I refuse to believe that this shield of his cannot be broken!”
Andola fumed. He continued using his Judgment Angel Light to attack
the blue shield.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood where he was, allowing the rebirthing powers to
cleanse him. He looked as blissful as if a pretty woman was giving
him an excellent massage. He was very relaxed.</p>
<p>Fairy Feather elder and the others wanted to rip Han Sen’s ugly
face off.</p>
<p>But the brothers’ Judgment Angel Light could not even make the
blue shield tremble, let alone make a dent. Han Sen’s shield had
encased the entire angel statue. The rebirthing powers that came
flowing out of the vase all headed towards Han Sen. There was
nothing the brothers Angela and Andola could do.</p>
<p>Rebirthing powers flowed into the Spell armor continuously. The
symbols across the Spell armor brightened, shrouding Han Sen in a
holy light. He was like a sun within the Demon Bug Bai Sema.</p>
<p>Angela and Andola continued to attack the Demon Bug Bai Sema,
but nothing they tried worked. The shield did not even shake.</p>
<p>When Fairy Feather elder and the others saw the rebirthing
powers go into Han Sen, their hearts bled. No matter how much they
hated Han Sen, there was little they could do. They could only
watch the heartrending show.</p>
<p>When Han Sen refused to remove the shield, it became apparent
that he wanted all the power for himself. Fairy Feather shouted
furiously, “Take it! Take it! Yeah, so much rebirthing power will
push you into going primal. You won’t be able to cope, and you’ll
have to restart from the beginning.”</p>
<p>There really was so much rebirthing power. There was enough
there to satisfy the rebirthing needs of two Dukes. What he was
thinking was correct.</p>
<p>Fairy Feather wasn’t the only one thinking this, either. Most
Feathers were of the same mind. Han Sen had absorbed so much
rebirthing powers, it’d likely reset his geno armaments and turn
the dial back to zero.</p>
<p>But as more and more power came gushing into the Spell armor,
what they expected didn’t seem to occur. The Spell armor just
continued to glow and nothing more.</p>
<p>Half of the rebirthing powers had emerged now, and all of them
had been taken by Han Sen. Not even a Duke should have been able to
withstand that amount of energy. He should have gone primal by
now.</p>
<p>But Han Sen still stood calmly in the light, with nothing
distressing occurring.</p>
<p>Angela and Andola ceased attacking. They just stood there,
watching Han Sen absorb every rebirthing power. They looked
extremely awkward. The Pool of Rebirth had already started, so they
would have to wait for all of this to be over before they could
leave the altar.</p>
<p>The whole race of the Feathers were embarrassed. They did not
speak, and some of them had to slink away.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace envoys, on the other hand, spoke merrily amongst
themselves. They spoke about how much rebirthing power Han Sen
might need to level up.</p>
<p>As time went by, fewer and fewer winged eggs were being released
from the vase. Han Sen’s Spell armor was getting even brighter, but
it did not look like it was going to become a Marquise.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that much power would level up his Spell armor,
but as the rebirthing power trickled off, the armor didn’t seem
ready to reach a higher tier.</p>
<p>“Oh no! So much energy and yet Spell still isn’t going to become
a Marquise?” Han Sen felt depressed.</p>
<p>The Feathers were in even more shock than Han Sen about this,
though. Han Sen was going to absorb all of that rebirthing power,
and yet he wasn’t going to level up. His geno armament wasn’t
reborn, either. It was hard to imagine how he had managed to absorb
so much power without being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>When the last rebirthing power exited the vase, the liquid
energy ceased its discharge, too. Then, the altar started to
dim.</p>
<p>Han Sen absorbed the last rebirthing power, and Spell looked
like an armor built from the sun. It was so bright you could hardly
look at it. But despite that, it had not reached Marquise
class.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew there was no hope of accomplishing that here. And
now he realized just how difficult it was to level up The Story of
Genes. That geno art required a mountain of treasure. Poor people
could never hope to learn it. Even rich people would go bankrupt
trying to meet its demands.</p>
<p>The Pool of Rebirth stopped running and the crystal pillar
became dim. Han Sen had been the one to absorb every rebirthing
power, and the brothers had been denied a single one.</p>
<p>“So what if he took all that power? After all that power
absorption, he still cannot become a Marquise. No matter how hard
he tries, he’ll never become deified! I doubt he’ll even reach King
class. He is just a waste of resources.” Words like these were
exactly how the Feathers tried to comfort themselves.</p>
<p>But even so, they could not deny how surprising the Demon Bug
Bai Sema had been.</p>
<p>Even with the brothers combining their Judgment Angel Light,
they could not make the shield rattle. They wondered if a King
class elite could hope to break it.</p>
<p>“What treasure was that shield? Why was it so strong?”</p>
<p>“It looks like only Kings can break that shield. I cannot
believe this treasure fell into the hands of an Earl.”</p>
<p>“I bet Knife Queen or Sky Palace leader lent it to him. How
could an Earl like him obtain such a powerful treasure?”</p>
<p>“With this treasure, he could do anything in this universe.”
“It’s a shame this treasure is in the hands of scum.”</p>
<p>No matter how much the Feathers complained, they could not
change the facts of the matter. They could not obtain a single
ounce of power from that Pool of Rebirth session. Sky Palace had
only occupied one slot of the three, and in doing so, claimed every
single rebirthing power.</p>
<p>Sky Palace had two more spots to use, and if they sent someone
else like Han Sen, that would mean they’d be getting the equivalent
of nine sessions instead of the three they were allocated.</p>
<p>But despite their bitterness, there was nothing the Feathers
could do about it. They had to gnash their teeth and swallow their
pride.</p>
<p>The envoys continued their discussions with Holy Heaven, so Han
Sen did not see the point in hanging around now. He left Holy
Heaven to return to Sky Palace where he could absorb the Jade
Spirits.</p>
<p>The Story of Genes was hopeless to level up, and not even Han
Sen was confident in whether it could one day become deified. It
took an extreme amount of power just to become Marquise, so god
knew how much it would take to become deified.</p>
