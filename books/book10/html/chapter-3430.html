<p>“There are only four people who can walk this path and take this
step. Even if I am not encountering Qin Xiu in this round, I am
bound to meet him eventually. The next round I will probably
encounter Qin Xiu.” Han Sen did not care which opponent he was
going to encounter.</p>
<p>Seeing the area open up ahead of him, he watched a person emerge
from the clouds. Han Sen was shocked by who it was.</p>
<p>The person’s body glowed with a god light. He was like a sun in
the sky. He was a God Spirit, but Han Sen could not recall this God
Spirit. He was more than a little surprised.</p>
<p>“Weird. I have met the 12 Annihilation main gods and God Hall
Leader, so why have I never seen this person before?” Han Sen
checked out the God Spirit.. His brain quickly jumped to think,
“Even if the 12 Annihilation-class God Spirits wanted to take part
in the geno tablet fights and were able to reach the top four, this
nameless God Spirit is the one that made the effort to do so. This
is so weird.”</p>
<p>The God Spirits were different from ordinary creatures. They
relied on their god temples and god bases. The levels and strength
of a God Spirit correlated with the god temple and god base they
possessed. Their powers would be higher. It was hard to believe
such a nameless God Spirit had been able to walk this far.</p>
<p>This God Spirit was a man. He looked pretty, but his body was
very big. He was so perfect that one could not nit-pick the
smallest of flaws. Not even men could find anything bad to say
about him.</p>
<p>“Are you a God Spirit from the geno hall?” Han Sen wondered if
that God Spirit was a wild god. Otherwise, it would not make sense
that he had been able to make this step.</p>
<p>The God Spirit nodded and said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>This answer surprised Han Sen. Han Sen asked, “What is your god
title?”</p>
<p>“I am just an unknown, small God Spirit,” the God Spirit said
with a smile. “I am of the lowest tier, just a small
Destroyed-class God Spirit. If I tell you my title, I am afraid you
will never have heard of it before.”</p>
<p>“If you do not tell me, how am I supposed to know if I have
never heard it before or have?” Han Sen was smiling too, but he
thought, “Just a Destroyed-class God Spirit? If so, how has he been
able to reach the top four?”</p>
<p>The God Spirit stopped resisting and provided his name. “My name
is Crape Myrtle. Have you heard about me before, Mister
Dollar?”</p>
<p>Han Sen ransacked his memory, but he could not remember ever
hearing this name before. He had never heard of a God Spirit
parading around with this sort of title.</p>
<p>“From now on, I will remember this name,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle smiled. His smile was like a warm spring sun that
could make people drown in an intoxicating haze. “You are welcome,
Mister Dollar. To be able to fight you is going to be a great
pleasure for me. Please, teach me a thing or two in our
engagement.”</p>
<p>After Crape Myrtle said, the creatures of the two universes
sighed. After watching Han Sen’s last three supposed fights, and
with Crape Myrtle calling him a mister, they no longer worried
about Crape Myrtle giving up like Wang Yuhang and the others.</p>
<p>“I say, Han Sen’s luck is not always so good then, is it? It is
about time he did something for real.”</p>
<p>“Is Crape Myrtle really a Destroyed-class God Spirit? Surely a
Destroyed-class God Spirit cannot be strong enough to reach the top
four. Has he merely been as lucky as Han Sen with all of his rivals
giving up?”</p>
<p>People weren’t only just interested in Han Sen now. They were
interested in the Crape Myrtle, who was a God Spirit they had never
heard of before.</p>
<p>“I do not think I will be able to teach you much, but I will do
my best.” Han Sen performed an appreciative gesture and allowed
Crape Myrtle to attack first.</p>
<p>“In that case, you better watch out, Mister Dollar,” Crape
Myrtle said as a godly power arose around him. A sky full of stars
was born, and it covered the whole arena.</p>
<p>In the 33 skies, there was no sun, no stars, and no moon. Now,
it was flickering. When Han Sen had a closer look, he was given a
shock. The star was not something thick that was made from god
powers. It was a real planet. The planet was so lively that it
looked like there were lots of lifeforms living there.</p>
<p>“Using god powers to make space is impressive. This guy cannot
simply be a Destroyed-class God Spirit,” Han Sen shockingly
thought.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle still had not attacked, so Han Sen’s powers had not
been triggered. He could not check out the planet properly, but it
was just that his foe was exuding a presence that was greater than
a Destroyed-class God Spirit.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle said, “Mister Dollar, watch this. My skill is
called Star Chess Cloth.” A sky full of stars changed to become
something alive.</p>
<p>A sky full of starlight crossed each other and went for Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Thousands of stars combined, and Han Sen’s powers were
activated. Han Sen was most surprised about his eyes when his
powers were triggered. He could not see where the flaws of the
stars were.</p>
<p>Every star had a different element and type of starlight. Out of
the tens of thousands of planets, there were no two planets that
had a starlight element that was the same. It was like all of space
was starlight, and it was combining all the elements of the
universe.</p>
<p>Starlight substances of tens of thousands of different elements
combined. It was like the complete rules of the universe. There
weren’t any flaws, and there was not anything missing.</p>
<p>“If there are no flaws, then power can break it.” Han Sen’s eyes
froze. His hands gathered up power. He lifted a star and planned on
hitting the starlight.</p>
<p>Amidst the endless starlight, it touched Han Sen’s hands and
made him suffer a shock. The starlight that seemed so scary did not
have any power. It touched down on his hand like a normal light
shining on his hand. It made his hands look purple and red, but
they were not destructive.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked because he had just found out that the
scary, powerful starlight did not have power. It was immune to his
body. The starlight had no power. It was like a shadow.</p>
<p>It did not matter if Han Sen could not tell, but this time, his
body had been tricked by the light shadow. His powers were
activated. This was the first time this had happened to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Even Demon Alpha, Asura, and other elites like that could not
trick Han Sen’s body, but Crape Myrtle was able to do it. This was
scary.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen looked at Crape Myrtle. He did not
believe Crape Myrtle was just a Destroyed-class God Spirit. The
universe could not have a powerful Destroyed-class God Spirit like
that. Even if there was, it would be an Annihilation class one
already.</p>
<p>“Mister Dollar is so forgetful,” Crape Myrtle said. “My name is
Crape Myrtle.” He then flashed with a god light and said, “Pay
attention, Mister Dollar. My skill is called Star Change.”</p>
<p>When the god light of Crape Myrtle’s body changed, a sky full of
stars started to change too. It rained down starlight that had been
created by a thousand stars.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not end up rushing just because of his misjudgment.
He did not want to be reckless. He raised his hand and reached for
the star. He discovered that the star did not have any power. It
was still just an empty shadow.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle kept using many different skills. He used seven.
None of them seemed to contain power. He used seven shadow skills
that did not do anything, and they tricked Han Sen’s body seven
times.</p>
