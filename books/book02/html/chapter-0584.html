    <p>
      &#8220;Watching Dollar battle is so boring. I want to watch Han Sen battle
      Yi Dongmu; two assassins fighting each other would be pretty fun!&#8221;
      Tang Zhenliu sat on his sofa rewatching the video of Yi Dongmu and
      Dollar&#8217;s final battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A battle between two assassins would be too fatal,&#8221; Lin Feng
      said quietly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s why it would be exciting! But those two don&#8217;t
      have a grudge with each other, so the chance of them fighting would be
      pretty low. It is a shame, though.&#8221; Tang Zhenliu felt remorseful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two people that Tang Zhenliu spoke about were in the shelter, one
      meter apart.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am going to hunt a red-scale dragon. Do you want to come?&#8221;
      Yi Dongmu looked at Han Sen and asked.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;That is too dangerous.&#8221; Han Sen blinked.</p>

    <p>
      The red-scale dragon that Yi Dongmu mentioned was a powerful sacred-blood
      creature. Even with the powers they both possessed, it would be an
      incredibly difficult fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is dangerous; that is why I am going.&#8221; Yi Dongmu turned to
      leave as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Han Sen knew that Yi Dongmu&#8217;s
      spirit had been crushed. He didn&#8217;t say much, he just followed Yi
      Dongmu to the slopes of a particularly snowy mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu killed the creatures along the way in one hit. Seeing him angry
      like that, Han Sen began to believe it may have been better if he had
      thrown the match and lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Yi Dongmu was really powerful, and if it wasn&#8217;t for Han
      Sen&#8217;s constant practice of wind strike with him, he most likely
      would not have been able to block the skill. The win didn&#8217;t feel
      entirely clean, and it made Han Sen feel a little ashamed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before long, they both reached the cap of the mountain where the red-scale
      dragon was said to reside. From afar, they saw a creature that looked like
      a T-rex on the slopes of the mountain, curled up and sleeping in the snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because it had not yet been given a name, it was Yi Dongmu who called it
      &#8220;red-scale dragon.&#8221; According to him, the power and speed of
      the creature were incredibly high. And even with sacred-blood weaponry,
      its scales would be extremely difficult to penetrate. He had come here
      twice before attempting to kill it, but had failed both times.
    </p>

    <p>
      But today, Yi Dongmu had clearly resolved not to be beaten again. He was
      going to kill it, no matter what it took.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu summoned his beast soul daggers and ran towards the red-scale
      dragon. He was shouting all the way, and it gave Han Sen a cold sweat.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Geez, you are an assassin. What is wrong with you, running in with
      a battle cry like some brutish warrior?!&#8221; Han Sen felt deflated, but
      still, he summoned his silver-eye ice snake king sword and ancient mascot
      sword and ran to the other side of the red-scale dragon, which was now
      rising from its slumber.
    </p>

    <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Yi Dongmu&#8217;s weapons were slashing the red-scale dragon
      with ardent ferocity, but their strikes only left shallow scratches in the
      dragon&#8217;s scales. The creature was unharmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The red-scale dragon was like a mechanical truck that kept sprinting up
      and down the slopes of that mountain. It was so fast and fierce that Yi
      Dongmu and Han Sen could only dodge again and again, unable to get in hits
      from the front.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You go draw its attention!&#8221; Yi Dongmu barked the order at Han
      Sen before running behind the red-scale dragon.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you draw its attention?!&#8221; Han Sen felt
      frustrated, but he still waved his two blades to hack at the red-scale
      dragon&#8217;s legs. He managed to obtain the red-scale dragon&#8217;s
      attention, and with a capped aggro, was promptly chased all over the
      mountainside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu found the perfect opening and managed to leap onto its head from
      behind. He repeatedly stabbed the creature in its neck, the only spot that
      wasn&#8217;t plated in thick scales.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The red-scale dragon thundered its agony. It shook its head and threw Yi
      Dongmu down into the snow. Then the red-scales of the dragon burst into
      flames. As they seared in fire, the scales turned to crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes, it&#8217;s turning Berzerk! Run!&#8221; Han Sen
      yelled, and then started running away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Yi Dongmu&#8217;s mood was foul, he wasn&#8217;t stupid. He
      joined Han Sen and ran as fast as his legs could carry him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the red-scale dragon was furious. It chased them over the mountains
      and valleys for over one hundred miles before they finally lost the
      monster on their heels.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu and Han Sen felt as if their legs were ready to snap by the time
      they outran their pursuer. Gasping in unison, they collapsed to the ground
      for respite.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, Yi Dongmu said, &#8220;You are going to attack the royal
      shelter?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Han Sen looked at Yi Dongmu and then continued,
      &#8220;You want to join me?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Be careful of Qi Xiuwen.&#8221; After Yi Dongmu issued his warning,
      he got up and turned to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen remained sitting in the snow. He shook his head and said, &#8220;I
      don&#8217;t know if Qi Xiuwen convinced Li Xinglunand and Philip to join
      me yet, but I have to take down that royal shelter as soon as I possibly
      can.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen remained unconcerned about Qi Xiuwen. With the silver fox around
      him most of the time, he knew no evolver could cause him great harm; no
      one across the ice fields, at least. Before the terrifying power of the
      silver fox, all conspiracies would be useless against him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then got up but noticed something moving in the snow up ahead. He
      stayed as still as he could, trying to figure out what he had just seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      He saw something move around in the snow, and after a while, a big white
      turtle came out from under the powdery snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The turtle was pretty large. After it emerged from the snow, it poked its
      head about to look around. It seemed to be searching for something.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched the turtle from a good distance, but he could see where it
      had come from. Behind it there was an ice cave that appeared to have been
      flooded. The surface of the water was mostly ice, and it was dressed in
      thick snow, so it took a decent pair of eyes to see it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big turtle wasn&#8217;t looking for Han Sen, and after it walked
      around in a few circles, it returned to the cave it had emerged from. It
      then dipped its head into the water. Whether it was drinking or not
      remained to be seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      A while later, the turtle pulled its head back and simply looked into the
      ice cave. Han Sen thought it was a strange sight, so he sat back down and
      continued his observation in greater comfort. After some time had passed,
      another turtle came out of the water in the cave.
    </p>

    <p>
      But compared to the first turtle, this turtle was much smaller. It was
      like a small rice bowl. After this small turtle exited the water, many
      more followed. At final count, nine turtles came out of the water of the
      ice cave.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, who was hiding in the snow, opened his eyes wide and said,
      &#8220;These cannot be the babies of the big turtle, right?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was aware that it was a difficult task for creatures to breed. He
      had only ever seen a Golden Growler, an Old Turtle, and an Obsidian Dragon
      give birth, and their litters were incredibly small, usually singular.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet this big turtle had eight baby turtles behind it. If they were its
      children, those numbers were crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the eight turtles came out to join the big turtle, the big turtle
      led them down to a wide basin below the snow-cloaked mountain. Watching
      the trail of turtles take off on their little adventure, Han Sen could not
      help but admire them and think they were rather cute.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know the details of the snow turtles he had just seen and
      could not tell what tier of monster they could be considered. So, all he
      did was hide in the snow and watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the big turtle reached the basin below the mountain, it used its
      claws to dig into the snow. Han Sen watched as it slowly unearthed red
      mushrooms. Then, when the smaller turtles arrived, they each happily
      started eating their bounty of food.
