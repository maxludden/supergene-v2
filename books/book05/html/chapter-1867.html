<h2>You Make This Difficult</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1867</h3>

<p>The Moon God Festival had become boring. The young ones went to
the Moon God Palace to accept their blessings, but they were only
able to raise up to the thirty-six moons, individually.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be a number of extreme pride, but now it
seemed rather pathetic. Once they had seen the true Moon God
blessing, their own Moon God blessings seemed almost fake.</p>
<p>This wasn’t because they were neither good nor lucky; that had
nothing to do with it. But without the Moon God appearing, no
matter how lucky or strong you were, you did not possess the true
blessing.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Jadeskin had its origins in the Frost Sutra. It had a
connection to the Moon God, which was why he received the blessings
he did. It didn’t actually have anything to do with Han Sen’s luck
or strength.</p>
<p>Before long, the Moon God Festival came to an end. Han Sen,
receiving the Marquise armor he had come for, was overwhelmed with
sheer delight.</p>
<p>The festival had now finished, but Han Sen’s performance had
swiftly become a hot topic. Everyone knew about what had
transpired. Inside the meeting hall in the Full Moon Offices, a few
of the elderly and the kings of Narrow Moon had assembled.</p>
<p>Frowning and looking upset, Yisha said, “Why can’t we give Han
Sen a spot in the Moon Garden? Is he not talented enough? Or is my
student simply not qualified?”</p>
<p>The elders did not speak. Neither did they dare look directly at
Yisha.</p>
<p>Night River King said, “It is not because we do not want to,
it’s simply because the Rebate’s law only permits the acceptance of
a Rebate.”</p>
<p>“I don’t recall the Moon Garden ever having such a rule. Didn’t
they once accept an outsider, back in the era long ago?” Yisha said
emotionlessly.</p>
<p>After that, the faces of the elders and elites all changed.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King groaned and said, “Queen, you know what happened
to the last outsider, don’t you? If he is not of the same race, he
is different. It does not matter how talented or lucky he is, the
fact remains that he will never be a Rebate.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Haven’t you heard the story of the mother Rebate raising a
baby wolf, only to be killed by her child once it had grown up?”
Night River King said.</p>
<p>“Queen, you should really understand what we are telling you. If
your student was one of the Rebate, we’d give you as many slots as
you are able to take.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. You should take another student if you do not approve.
We’ll give your next a slot, for sure.”</p>
<p>The elders and the elites tried convincing each other not to
give Han Sen a spot in the Moon Garden. Yisha frowned. She was
Knife Queen, yes, but she was not a dictator that could orchestrate
every working of their society. Without the approval of the elders,
she would be unable to provide a spot for Han Sen in the Moon
Garden.</p>
<p>Moon Garden was a training organization that belonged to the
Rebate. Everyone who got in had the possibility of becoming a
deified elite, or at least a champion.</p>
<p>Of course, they hadn’t produced any deified elites in a while.
But there were many general elites. Even Knife Queen herself had
gone through the training offered there. Out of all the kings
present, only Moon Wheel King that had secured such prestige
without having first spent time in Moon Garden.</p>
<p>Entering Moon Garden meant you’d be able to enjoy all the
resources available to the Rebate. Making Han Sen a Duke would be
difficult, but it was fortunate that with Yisha’s support, it
wouldn’t be too problematic.</p>
<p>It was simply a shame that Han Sen was not one of the Rebate.
She had tried to secure him a spot in Moon Garden, but no matter
how she pleaded, his acceptance would not be approved.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to Planet Blade. He waited for half a day for
Yisha to finally arrive and meet with him.</p>
<p>Yisha had just returned from Full Moon Office, and meeting with
him now was her next order of business.</p>
<p>“Queen, did you enjoy my performance?” Han Sen bowed.</p>
<p>Yisha sighed at Han Sen and said, “Han Sen, your performance
puts me in a difficult situation.”</p>
<p>“Why? Did I perform poorly?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“No! In fact, it was too good. Let me ask you, how did you get
the Teeth power?” Yisha asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“It is because I practiced it. Teeth power is similar to the
powers of Ghost Teeth Knife. I used Ghost Teeth Knife to practice
every day, and somehow, through that, I happened to learn it.” Han
Sen stayed very calm when she asked about this.</p>
<p>No one would be able to find out the truth, so he exerted
confidence in his answers. Yisha didn’t look suspicious, either.
She knew such things might be impossible to explain, anyway.</p>
<p>“How is your practice with The Story of Genes coming along?”
Yisha asked him.</p>
<p>“It’s going rather slowly,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>This was true. When Han Sen leveled up his The Story of Genes,
it had indeed gone very slow. He did not know how long it might
take to make him a Viscount with that.</p>
<p>Yisha pulled out a bottle and gave it to Han Sen. “This bottle
contains xenogeneic materials gathered from Viscount class
xenogeneics. It is a geno fluid, and it should be good in leveling
you up and bringing you up to the class of Viscount. Eat ten grams
of this every ten days. And when you do, immediately cast The Story
of Genes. Once you have finished, come along and get some
more.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much!” Han Sen was so happy, and he thought to
himself, “My performance really was good. Look at this, I’ve
received some goodies already!”</p>
<p>“Now, you get going. You’ve still got to develop Planet Eclipse,
in addition to all the training you have before you.” Yisha waved
and let Han Sen go.</p>
<p>The geno fluid, if it was used by a Baron, it could make him a
Viscount. It could possibly make two Viscounts.</p>
<p>But when used on Han Sen, Yisha knew it probably wouldn’t be as
effective. Instead, it would only help him inch his way closer to
the threshold. It wouldn’t be enough for him to level up
completely.</p>
<p>“We will see how he behaves,” Yisha thought to herself in her
heart.</p>
<p>Back on Planet Eclipse, Han Sen was not in a rush to drink that
geno fluid. In fact, he was keen to research the geno art he had
learned while inside Moon God Palace first and foremost.</p>
<p>Jadeskin was a geno art from the sanctuaries. This was something
that quite similar. It was like the geno universe counterpart of
Jadeskin. They did not have a connection, but with Han Sen’s prior
knowledge of Jadeskin, it should make practice of that geno art
fairly easy.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on practicing it, though. He still wanted
to focus on Jadeskin. He just wanted to absorb the essence of the
other and assimilate it with Jadeskin, while he continued on with
his original art.</p>
<p>Now that Han Sen could unleash power, he had to be able to
gather up spirit successfully. If he did that, he could evolve his
xenogeneic bones and become an Earl.</p>
<p>Like Earl Gao Ji: that man’s spirit had been a green dragon.</p>
<p>Judging from the way that geno art was practiced, it must have
had a special technique that allowed for the gathering of spirit.
Absorbing light element treasures would allow for easier gatherings
of spirit.</p>
