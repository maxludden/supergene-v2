<h2>Returning to Narrow-Moon</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2166</h3>

<p>Han Sen sat on a ship departing Sky Palace, bound for Narrow
Moon. He hadn’t been allowed to take half of the ocean mountain
with him, but the Sky Palace leader permitted him to keep a bunch
of ocean stones.</p>
<p>Han Sen would usually take a public passenger ship, but on this
day, he was riding a cargo ship. Loading it with ocean stones took
a while, and the people of Sky Palace who passed by couldn’t help
but stare at the bounty.</p>
<p>Students usually took items and gear with them when they left
Sky Palace, but they had never before seen a student embark on a
cargo ship fully stocked with ocean stones.</p>
<p>The stones weren’t close to half of the mountain Han Sen had
sundered, but it was more than enough masonry to build an entirely
new base. Because of that, Han Sen was quite satisfied.</p>
<p>The story of Han Sen destroying the ocean mountain quickly
spread to each and every corner of Sky Palace. The Sky Palace
leader and the elders quickly came to investigate what had
happened, and they supposedly learned that the ocean mountain
already had a crack. The incredible results weren’t because of Han
Sen’s raw strength. Instead, Han Sen had taken advantage of an
existing fault.</p>
<p>Even so, the tale of Han Sen sundering the entirety of ocean
mountain was a popular one. It was a frequently discussed topic,
and it would soon become a legend.</p>
<p>Many years later, when students departed Sky Palace, they would
leave their names or a mark of their presence by scrawling them
onto half of a floating mountain. It was easy to imagine them
asking what had happened to make it like so.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace people would sound very proud when answering,
telling the newbies how someone had once managed to cut the ocean
mountain in half.</p>
<p>Han Sen and that half of an ocean mountain became something for
the history books of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew ocean mountain hadn’t been previously cracked,
though. It split open because of the stone bug residing within.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen was breaking the ocean mountain, the situation
had been too messy for him to get a look at it, and as a result, he
hadn’t actually seen the stone bug with his own eyes. And although
he tried to use his Dongxuan Aura to find where it had gotten to,
it had vanished. It was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“I wonder what the level of that strange creature was. Perhaps
it was deified?” As Han Sen thought about this, Bao’er suddenly
summoned her little gourd.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that was odd. Bao’er rarely summoned her gourd
willy-nilly, and he hadn’t a clue why she had summoned it now, all
of a sudden.</p>
<p>Amidst Han Sen’s confusion, Bao’er shook her gourd. She slapped
its bottom, and when she did, something fell out of it and landed
on the table.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw it, and when he did, he was both surprised and
happy. A stone bug that looked an awful lot like a silkworm flopped
out of the gourd. It was the one that had resided inside ocean
mountain.</p>
<p>“No wonder I was unable to see the stone bug. Bao’er had taken
it.” Han Sen watched Bao’er curiously poke the body of the stone
bug.</p>
<p>The stone bug raised its body, but it did not have any limbs,
and Bao’er’s fingers kept it constantly moving. It couldn’t resist
the push of her fingers.</p>
<p>That was unexpected.</p>
<p>That stone bug had produced the stone mountain, but despite
that, it did not seem to be all that powerful. By the looks of
things, it did not even have the strength of a Baron.</p>
<p>“Planet Eclipse has an active volcano. Maybe I can throw this
thing into it, and see if it can generate more ocean stones,” Han
Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Bao’er was still playing with the stone bug. While she did, Han
Sen went to find more information on ocean stones and the stone
bugs that produced them.</p>
<p>The biggest place that stored ocean stones was Purgatory Rock
Sea. It was a strange xenogeneic space that was composed almost
entirely of lava. Sometimes islands would appear in the midst of
the lava, and those islands were composed of ocean stones.</p>
<p>But Purgatory Rock Sea had many fire xenogeneics to contend
with, too. Many of the xenogeneics were King class, and some were
even deified. Going there in pursuit of ocean stones was a
dangerous job. The death rate for those that went there was very
high.</p>
<p>Ordinary people would only be able to find bits of pre-shattered
ocean stones. Only deified elites could bring back a whole
mountain’s worth, like the one Sky Palace had possessed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to learn much about the ocean stones, but
surprisingly, he was unable to learn anything about the stone bugs.
It seemed as if no one knew how ocean stones were created. No one
had seen one of those stone bugs before.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a look at the ocean stone bug. After Bao’er annoyed
it for a while, it stopped moving and played dead. It realized that
the more it resisted, the happier Bao’er would become.</p>
<p>After it decided to stop moving, Bao’er’s interest in the
creature quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the stone bug closely. Its body was like grey
rock. It felt warm to the touch, and that was it.</p>
<p>Its lifeforce was not very strong, so Han Sen was unsure how it
had managed to break the ocean mountain as it had.</p>
<p>Han Sen let Bao’er put the stone bug back in the gourd. He was
going to experiment more with it once he visited the volcano. If he
took the critter to an environment like that, something might
happen.</p>
<p>The ship was guarded by a number of Sky Palace’s elites. Han Sen
was delivered back to Narrow Moon safely, with the ship packed to
the gills with ocean stones.</p>
<p>On a primal planet covered with many cruel creatures, a man
stood holding a knife. All the creatures that went by him were
killed. No bones were left after their death, as the knife consumed
them whole.</p>
<p>That knife was strange. It was made from bone and shaped like
some creature’s spine. The knife was serrated like teeth, and it
was around two meters long. But when the man swung it, it killed
any cruel creature that it came against, and all of the beast’s
flesh would be absorbed into that bone knife. The blade appeared
more and more bloody as the creatures died.</p>
<p>The man that gripped that bone knife looked a little strange, as
well. His head had three faces like a Destroyed. But he only had
one pair of arms, and those three faces looked very different from
a Destroyed.</p>
<p>The average Destroyed had one bird head in the center, with the
faces of a man and woman on either side. But this man’s three faces
all looked like men. The center face was emotionless. The left one
looked like a ghost, and the right one looked handsome.</p>
<p>The man kept killing, his expressions never looking bored or
annoyed. Countless lives were harvested by his bone knife, but his
emotions did not change once.</p>
<p>While the man was killing, his beautiful face looked up to the
sky. A ship breached the atmosphere and came down to land near
him.</p>
<p>A robot departed the ship and walked in front of the man.</p>
<p>“Barr, someone is willing to offer you a high sum to kill Knife
Queen’s student. Will you accept this contract?” The robot made
some electronic noises.</p>
<p>“You know the rules.” The man named Barr continued to kill as he
spoke. He cut a creature in half with his bone knife right then and
there. The teeth-life blade went on to munch on the body, and
eventually the knife swallowed it up.</p>
<p>The bone knife looked even stronger after that. Its red color
had grown even darker.</p>
<p>“This video should be sufficient. I assure you that this target
is worth your time.” The robot proceeded to display a video of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Barr watched it, and he was attracted by what he saw. A short
time later, his eyes flashed and he said, “I will accept this
task.”</p>
