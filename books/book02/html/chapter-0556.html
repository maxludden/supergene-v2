    <p>
      Han Sen returned to his room and began studying the five-page copy of
      Jade-Sun Force. With his knowledge of ancient lexicon, he had little
      trouble in deciphering the text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The characters were archaic, and the content of the hyper geno art was
      rich; overall, it seemed like a good skill to strengthen one&#8217;s
      kidneys.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he continued to stare at the parchments, they emanated a mystical aura.
      As Han Sen studied them, he felt that he was understanding more and more
      about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The closer Han Sen looked, the more his understanding and perception of
      that enigmatic aura clarified.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is what the Jade-Sun Force is. It&#8217;s not as disgusting as
      Zhu Ting said. It isn&#8217;t unlike the Heresy Mantra, though that one
      strengthens a person&#8217;s heart. Instead, Jade-Sun Force just
      strengthens your kidneys.&#8221; Han Sen finished reading and came to this
      conclusion with much surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen became ever more surprised when he realized how good this skill
      actually was. It was definitely a skill that wasn&#8217;t easily
      attainable and which could be greatly sought after. But why had Zhu Ting
      give it to him with such little resistance?
    </p>

    <p>
      From the way Han Sen saw it, Jade-Sun Force wasn&#8217;t far off the
      Heresy Mantra. If strengthening your heart was meant to strengthen your
      force and amplify your powers, then strengthening your kidney was like
      upgrading your power storage tank.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your kidneys were not upgraded with Jade-Sun Force, it would be like
      using coal to produce fire and warmth. It was effective, but not
      efficient; it wasn&#8217;t a clean burn, either. But if you were to
      upgrade your kidneys, it would be like using a clean-burning gas like
      propane; effective, efficient and longer-lasting. The improvements were
      huge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, it was like using regular fuel to try propel a rocket into
      space. Once he was was strengthened, Han Sen suspected he&#8217;d be able
      to learn a wider variety of skills, and to use them more effectively than
      ever. His stamina and strength would reach a whole new level.
    </p>

    <p>
      If all this was correct, Han Sen&#8217;s combat abilities would be greater
      than ever, and his peak-performance duration during prolonged fights would
      almost without equal. In the past, it had been determined that to be among
      the best, you had to be able to remain unexhausted of any amount of power
      for up to two hours. But by strengthening your kidneys in this way, he
      believed he could fight at maximum capacity for 24 hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was wary, however; he was suspicious of why Zhu Ting would so
      casually present him such a significant skill. Had he realized the full
      extent of this skill beforehand, he would have gladly traded more Berserk
      beast souls to get his hands on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then guessed that Zhu Ting must have already learnt the Jade-Sun
      Force himself. It was likely that many others had learnt it too, before it
      had somehow fallen into Zhu Ting&#8217;s lap. But when they learnt it, it
      wasn&#8217;t as efficient, and it only worked to slightly increase their
      typical strength, alongside their outstanding capabilities. This was most
      likely due to their lesser understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Truly understanding the entire texture and richness of the words on those
      parchments was a talent only possessed by a few. Han Sen was able to
      understand the full extent of the hyper geno art, first, because his brain
      had been combined with Blood Crystal. This had already led to a natural
      increase in abilities of perception. But the second reason rested in his
      recent understanding of the Dongxue Sutra. His manner of perceiving and
      thinking was clearer, and so, reading the copy of the Jade-Sun Force
      provided him the greater subtext that had been missed by so many others.
    </p>

    <p>
      For ordinary people, the power bestowed upon them through Jade-Sun Force
      was weak and unsubstantial. Their perception was too limited to glean the
      small differences that separated what they learnt and what Han Sen could
      learn. Put simply, they couldn&#8217;t understand Jade-Sun Force.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen practiced Jade-Sun Force a few times, he felt his kidneys
      vibrate like warm stones. He felt as if there were two little stoves
      alight inside, energizing him. He felt like he wouldn&#8217;t need any
      rest, even if he was to run for three days and nights.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is a great skill. After I master it, I would have no problem
      battling ten creatures, all at once.&#8221; Han Sen was in a great mood.
    </p>

    <p>
      But perfecting Jade-Sun Force was sure to take a long time, and Han Sen
      wasn&#8217;t in a rush. He was still wondering how he might slay the
      silver-eye ice snake king, after all. If he lacked two sacred-blood
      swords, an infinite amount of stamina wouldn&#8217;t matter against the
      Twin Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, Han Sen was in control of the Blackgod Shelter now. Although the
      elites of their former master were not under his direct command, they
      still secretly listened to Dong Lin and not Han Sen. But if it was for the
      slaying of a sacred-blood creature, they would definitely come along.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen carefully looked at the list of elites belonging to the Blackgod
      Shelter, and hand-picked ten people to join him on his quest to slay the
      silver-eye ice snake king.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Boss, we tried hunting the silver-eye ice snake king once before
      with Blackgod. We didn&#8217;t succeed, as it was far too difficult. In
      the domain of that wretched creature, the efficiency of our powers was
      dampened and subdued. To be surrounded by snakes is no small task - it is
      wickedly dangerous.&#8221; A few of the elites that had accompanied
      Blackgod in the hunt had their faces contort with fear as they heard Han
      Sen&#8217;s plan to venture there and slay the beast. They attempted to
      change his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have already made my decision. Stop the chatter and follow my
      commands,&#8221; Han Sen responded coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this, some of the elites lost hope. Dong Lin and Han Sen had already
      come to an agreement, so for this task, those who had been selected had no
      choice but to accompany him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen brought ten people with him to Ice Snake Valley. They had
      cartographic documents with them, so they had little trouble navigating
      through the snow to get to where they wanted to be. They all reached their
      destination in fine health.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was said to be an ice valley, but in reality the location appeared more
      like a Glacier Grand Canyon, where colossal rifts in the frost-bitten
      grounds had parted to form narrow basins, and where snow could collect in
      dangerous amounts. If you were to fall into it, you would be sure to be
      submerged in the snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the snow fields they now treaded, movement from beneath the snow could
      be seen. It was movement from a silver white ice snake, tunneling forward
      like a rabid earthworm.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ice snakes were white, with eyes of deadly silver. When they were
      submerged in the piles of snow, they were camouflaged and nearly
      impossible to see. If one didn&#8217;t pay close attention, they&#8217;d
      never see them before it was too late.
    </p>

    <p>
      They did not know how many ice snakes populated this perilous canyon, and
      that if any of the creatures bit you, you would be immediately paralyzed
      with frostbite. A well-armed person might be able to withstand the bite of
      an ordinary ice snake, but if they were to be bitten by a mutant variant,
      it wouldn&#8217;t matter if their fitness level was over 100. Succumbing
      to such a bite would freeze you in no time at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those ten evolvers were over 100, but their great talents did little to
      stave off their fear. They did their best to delay and drag out the
      venture there, taking their time as if their life depended on it – because
      it did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen noticed this, but wasn&#8217;t upset. Instead, he smiled and said,
      &quot;Well, how about this? You don&#8217;t have to risk your lives and
      enter the valley. I will go alone to draw out the silver-eye ice snake
      king. I will lure it all the way here, so that we can fight it together,
      free from the intrusions of the other snakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good, good, good!&#8221; The elites all nodded in delighted
      agreement. They didn&#8217;t want to set foot in that valley at all. The
      dangers there were too much for them. And if Han Sen went in alone, it
      wouldn&#8217;t be their fault if he died.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But there is something I must tell you first; if I draw out the
      silver-eye ice snake king, and someone decides to flee, do not blame me
      for being cruel in my response to your desertion. Even Dong Lin will be
      unable to help out any cowards that run.&#8221; Han Sen eyed each of them
      coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      In response, one of the evolvers said, &#8220;Do not worry, Boss. We
      aren&#8217;t like that. We will do our best to help you slay it.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Though his mouth said that, his heart felt something else. Like the rest,
      he believed that if Han Sen truly ventured there alone, he wouldn&#8217;t
      be coming back.
