<h2>Blood-Pulse Level Up</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2255</h3>

<p>Although he was leveling up, the blood kirin was still being
very careful in its approach. Even so, Han Sen was able to detect
its coming. Consequentally, Han Sen looked cold. He wondered
whether or not he should summon the Demon Bug King Bai Sema and
holler for Fox Queen.</p>
<p>The reason for Han Sen leveling up there, instead of the palace,
was because he did not actually want Fox Queen to see him ascend in
rank.</p>
<p>He did not think the blood kirin would dare get so close, due to
the current time not being the usual time it would emerge from the
lotus mountaintop. So right now, it was likely not a dangerous
time.</p>
<p>But the blood kirin had indeed emerged, and it had bravely made
the climb there.</p>
<p>Observing it be all sneaky, though, Han Sen chose not to do
anything. He remained still in his inspection of it.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was being more careful the closer to the peak it
got. It looked terrified.</p>
<p>When it was only a few hundred meters away, the blood kirin took
cover behind a rock. It peeked at Han Sen, but it did not come any
closer.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept up the process of leveling up to Duke, all the
while watching that blood kirin. If it did something, he really
would have to call for Fox Queen and make use of his Demon Bug King
Bai Sema.</p>
<p>But all the blood kirin did was watch. It kept looking Han Sen’s
way, but it did not approach.</p>
<p>Han Sen believed it was too afraid, and so, he kept his focus on
the leveling up process.</p>
<p>The blood inside him was boiling and his heart thumped like
thunder. It was like a machine. His heartbeat was throbbing like a
drum.</p>
<p>When the heart pumped, it made the blood inside him spin. The
temperature of his blood rose.</p>
<p>Seeing it reach a critical point, Han Sen did not have the time
to watch the blood kirin. So, he summoned his Demon Bug King Bai
Sema to commit to the final push.</p>
<p>Han Sen was like a bloodman. The blood seeped out of his skin,
spreading all over. It hardened to create layers of blood
crystals.</p>
<p>That was not because something awry had happened with Han Sen’s
leveling up process. The blood that was coming out was like the
skin of a snake. It was him releasing his old blood, to be replaced
by a newer blood that possessed a strange power. When the blood was
exchanged, that power inside him increased.</p>
<p>The body was wrapped up in that old blood, and it made Han Sen
look like a bloodstone. He sat where he was, unmoving. His body was
drowning in an ecstatic feeling.</p>
<p>Leveling up his Blood-Pulse Sutra to the rank of Duke was a
smooth and prolonged process. It was not a sudden change. The
blood, from being Marquise, became Duke. And eventually, the
leveling up process was over. And Han Sen was now Duke again.</p>
<p>Han Sen came out from an empty mind. His face felt wet. He
opened his eyes and he was shocked. He saw a red tongue lick his
face. The blood kirin was there.</p>
<p>“How did it come inside… the Demon Bug King Bai Sema did not
work…” Han Sen was shocked, and so he stumbled back. But that kirin
followed him. It remained next to him, as Han Sen’s speed was
slower than it.</p>
<p>The blood kirin did not release any power, though. Again, it
just licked Han Sen with its tongue. Han Sen was terrified, and he
realized the blood kirin was licking his old blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood where he was, afraid of inciting the blood kirin’s
wrath. It was so close, and if it was made angry, then Han Sen
would have no chance of escaping. He would have to make use of his
super god spirit mode.</p>
<p>Luckily, the kirin did not have ire. It only wished to lick Han
Sen. It licked away the old blood that was around his body, and it
looked as if it was enjoying it. It was as if it was eating an ice
cream.</p>
<p>“This guy likes blood. It’s not going to finish drinking my old
blood and then develop a hankering for my new blood, is it?” Han
Sen thought to himself, as he eyed the Demon Bug King Bai Sema.</p>
<p>The Demon Bug King Bai Sema was not broken, but Han Sen expected
that. If the Demon Bug King Bai Sema had been attacked, Han Sen
would have noticed. It would not have just allowed the blood kirin
to rush right in.</p>
<p>Now, the Demon Bug King Bai Sema was in perfect condition, and
yet, the blood kirin was inside it. That confused Han Sen.</p>
<p>Ever since Han Sen possessed the Demon Bug King Bai Sema, he had
never before encountered an opposing power that could breach the
item’s shield without actually breaking through. Not even Little
Star’s Starsea Travel could work against it.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking about this, the blood kirin finished
licking up all his old blood. It then stared at Han Sen while it
licked its lips.</p>
<p>“Eating all my old blood, and then wanting some fresh blood,
too, huh?” Han Sen gathered his strength and readied himself for a
fight.</p>
<p>But all the blood kirin did was look at him. Eventually, it
turned around and returned to the lotus mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen froze and thought to himself, “What is wrong with that
guy?”</p>
<p>After the blood rain was gone, Han Sen did not see the blood
kirin appear again. That made Han Sen think it to be very strange.
It was no longer absorbing blood and bone airs.</p>
<p>“Did my old blood fill it up?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Han Sen did not see the blood kirin
again. But he did not care much for its absence.</p>
<p>Even with the Blood-Pulse Sutra becoming Duke, Han Sen did not
think he would be able to defeat the blood kirin in combat whilst
in White Bone Big Hell. And Han Sen had yet to figure out how the
blood kirin had managed to get through his Demon Bug King Bai
Sema.</p>
<p>After Han Sen investigated the Duke class Blood-Pulse Sutra, he
wanted to learn what element it was associated with. And he wanted
to know if his dual-element ability could bypass its
restrictions.</p>
<p>After opening the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s element, Han Sen’s fitness
was greatly increased. It was not as effective as Jadeskin, but it
was not all bad.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there was nothing else special about it. And
that factoid depressed Han Sen a little. He felt that the
Blood-Pulse Sutra possessed a strange power, but he could not make
use of it because he did not know how to make use of it.</p>
<p>It was like a human’s organ. Humans now knew where they were and
what they did, but before technology had been developed, they did
not know what they did.</p>
<p>“This power will not only be available for the children, will
it?” Han Sen felt depressed, and so he decided to ask the members
of Blood Legion and learn more about what Blood-Pulse Sutra. It
would be a waste to reserve it only for the act of making
babies.</p>
<p>Jadeskin and Blood-Pulse Sutra’s two elements were both quite
strong. Han Sen calculated he had a chance to break the
restrictions.</p>
<p>But to ensure it would work, Han Sen decided to help Little
Angel become Duke first. With Little Angel’s power, it should go
swimmingly.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was imbued with a lot of Ghost Bone power, and if
he was to give some to Little Angel, it would be far easier for her
to become Duke. But while Han Sen was in the midst of doing that,
he realized Little Angel went against the Ghost Bone power. She was
unable to absorb it.</p>
