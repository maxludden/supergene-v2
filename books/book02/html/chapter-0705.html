    <p>
      &#8220;Is he really that strong?&#8221; Fang Mingquan asked Hua Ping with
      a look of disbelief.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a wry smile, Hua Ping said, &#8220;You know the Alliance created a
      forfeit guide, for the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary&#8217;s
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout, yes?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I know. It contains a record of all the most powerful spirits
      that have participated in Divinity&#8217;s Bout. If they encounter a
      spirit on that list, they are advised to immediately forfeit to avoid
      being killed,&#8221; Fang Mingquan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Light Son of God is one of those. He has only taken part in
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout once, so there was a lack of information about him
      at the time. A human with an unlocked gene lock was pitted against him. He
      was one of the top evolvers of all time, and he was a very famous man. He
      had many sacred-blood beast souls, strong hyper arts—the works. But the
      Light Son of God killed him in a single hit.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping shook his head and continued his explanation. &#8220;I have been
      too presumptuous. No human is powerful enough to become a Son of God. You
      need more than luck on your side to do that. I advise that you inform your
      friend of this wretched development. Tell him he can continue fighting for
      now, but he must pull out before the final battle. If he doesn&#8217;t,
      the Light Son of God won&#8217;t even allow him the opportunity to
      concede.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan was getting an idea of how bad things might get, but he had
      no way of contacting the elusive Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan thought his best bet for informing Dollar would be posting a
      news article about it. If he did that, there was at least a chance Dollar
      might see it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout continued. Today, everyone would have to fight five
      times. Dollar had another three spirits to go against; the other two were
      human.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen beat down the two humans and slew the three spirits with ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Powerful. He is so powerful. He might very well be the strongest
      evolver in history. With such power, I cannot imagine&#8230;&#8221; Hua
      Ping was very excited, but a pang of woe nagged at him from behind. Dollar
      was practically only one step away from being a Son of God, but he feared
      what might happen to him if he tried to take it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The better Dollar performed, the sorrier Hua Ping became. By the end, he
      couldn&#8217;t bear to watch Dollar fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Someone so excellent was soon to be stopped, right before earning the
      title and becoming one of the ten Son of God&#8217;s. He had no clue the
      next time humanity might have a similar opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan, on the other hand, was thrilled and excited. Although he
      wasn&#8217;t wholly clear on when Dollar joined the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, he suspected it hadn&#8217;t been more than a few years.
      Ascending at such a sharp trajectory, it was difficult for him to gauge
      his power correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Fang Mingquan and Hua Ping were both still worried. If they
      couldn&#8217;t contact Dollar, and he ended up facing off against the
      Light Son of God, things would go very bad, very quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He has read the forfeit guide, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Fang
      Mingquan pondered aloud. He was sure that Dollar had, but he was still
      prepared to go back and make a broadcast about the show. He hoped it was
      would be popular enough to let Dollar know how powerful the Light Son of
      God truly was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Too many fights were taking place at the same time, so people tended to
      just watch their family members or at least the people they cared for.
    </p>

    <p>So, for this reason, very few people paid attention to Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      A few people did come over to see, and although they were blown away when
      witnessing his power, it wasn&#8217;t enough to attract others over.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan decided to return to the Alliance and start a broadcast
      about Divinity&#8217;s Bout. In particular, he wanted to talk about the
      five matches Dollar had already taken part in. He also wished to speak
      about the opponents he was going to face-off against in the future; the
      Light Son of God, in particular. He wanted to deliver plenty of
      information about that spirit, and what the spirit had done in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      This broadcast was almost like radio. There were no pictures of the event
      and it only featured Fang Mingquan discussing Divinity&#8217;s Bout,
      alongside a rough map he had drawn up. Despite this, it drew a lot of
      attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollar is here? And he&#8217;s taking part in Divinity&#8217;s
      Bout!?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollar only became an evolver a few years ago; he&#8217;s taking
      part in Divinity&#8217;s Bout already?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy crap! Black-Gold&#8217;s hammer was smashed into smithereens
      by Dollar&#8217;s fist? And he then proceeded to kill the spirit with a
      single punch? Are you yanking our chain? I remember the previous
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout, in which my friend went up against Black-Gold. He
      had unlocked his gene lock and yet despite that, he was immediately struck
      by the hammer three times and was at the precipice of death before he
      could be dragged out in forfeit.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Dollar rocks!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go watch Dollar battle.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go support Dollar tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If Dollar is there, I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If the analysis is true, though&#8230; poor Dollar. He&#8217;ll be
      stopped in his tracks one step away from the top.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why do you guys assume he can keep on winning? Let&#8217;s just see
      if he can beat the rest of the spirits and humans first.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That Dollar is BS. His previous record was only landing as the
      tenth Son of God in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. And he only competed
      there once.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah! Dollar is a scrub out here in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary. The Light of God will crush him with his finger.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is the point of fighting, if it&#8217;s all down to luck? If
      he didn&#8217;t face-off against the Light Son of God, and become one of
      the top ten, he&#8217;d still be killed by the other Son of God&#8217;s.
      He is sidewalk litter against them; trash kicked to the side on the
      pavement.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With the luck you guys are talking about, I could be a Son of God.
      I could join and be lucky enough not to face-off against any strong foe
      and then POW! I&#8217;ll be a Son of God.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      Dollar&#8217;s participation in Divinity&#8217;s Bout was the catalyst for
      a great schism in the Alliance. A great debate had begun, and many people
      rooted for Dollar. They wanted him to become the first human Son of God in
      history.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there were many people who did not believe Dollar could make it and
      beat the Light Son of God in the process. People with sense were more
      likely to advise Dollar to give up the fight, lest he be killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many professionals had analyzed Dollar&#8217;s Divinity&#8217;s Bout. They
      thought his luck had been pretty good thus far. Every fight seemed to be
      an easy one, apart from the upcoming Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other humans who took part in the holy battles would be out a few
      rounds before Dollar, as the spirits they met were too powerful for them
      and they had to quit.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Dollar&#8217;s luck stopped there. Even if he went ahead and beat the
      next few spirits coming up, he would most likely withdraw before going up
      against the Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was what most professionals assumed Han Sen would do. As things were,
      they did not believe any human had what it took to go against the Light
      Son of God and win.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were some really crude and offensive professionals, however. Many of
      them firmly believed Han Sen would stumble and fall long before he reached
      the Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      And of course, there were some who believed Fang Mingquan was making stuff
      up or at least exaggerating the truth in a bid to increase viewership.
      They did not believe Dollar could break Black-Gold&#8217;s hammer with a
      single hit. After much research and analysis, they theoretically proved
      Dollar lacked sufficient power to do such a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless, the whole Alliance was talking about the event, and everyone
      seemed to have a theory of their own. And on the second day of
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout, the stadium was packed to the gills with attending
      spectators. Humanity&#8217;s interest in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary&#8217;s Divinity&#8217;s Bout had suddenly been reinvigorated.
