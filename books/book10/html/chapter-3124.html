<h2>Ghost Starlight Land</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3124</h3>

<p>Although he had the reverse version of the Cold Sutra, Han Sen
did not combine with a gene race for the Cold Sutra. Therefore, he
could not practice it.</p>
<p>“If the Cold Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra can be reversed, will I
be able to reverse The Story of Genes and Dongxuan Sutra?” Han Sen
wondered.</p>
<p>At this time, Han Sen did not have the time to do that. He
needed gene races. It wasn’t just the Cast God Court that required
gene races. If he wanted to reverse geno arts, he needed gene
races.</p>
<p>“If Gold Crystal System has a rare gene race, that would be
awesome. With Cast Gold Court’s method of making a rare gene race
breakthrough, I wonder how strong it might be if it could be
combined with a reverse geno art?” Han Sen could not help but let
his imagination run wild.</p>
<p>Even if the Gold Crystal System had a rare gene race, there was
no guarantee he could find one.</p>
<p>“If I can beat the big sky demon to an egg, perhaps it will go
well with the reversed Cold Sutra.” Han Sen thought about the big
sky demon.</p>
<p>The big sky demon was too ghostly. She was always coming and
going. Han Sen never knew where she was. The chance of turning the
big sky demon into an egg was lower than digging up a god
pulse.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy were still encased in ice. Han Sen used
Jadeskin to remove the Cold Sutra’s power on them. They woke up.
When Bald Guy came to, he was shocked. He asked, “Who was that
woman? She was so scary! Fortunately, you were here, Han Sen. If
you weren’t here, it would have ended up very poorly for us. Did
you kill her?”.</p>
<p>“I am not her enemy,” Han Sen said with a shrug of his
shoulders. “She ran off.”</p>
<p>Night God No Moon had two sets of memories. In each life, she
had reached the top of the world. She had combined ordinary and
reverse powers into break world power. To achieve that, two
universes were required. It would have been hard to find a creature
stronger than her.</p>
<p>“Even you could not beat her?” Bald Guy was shocked. His neck
shivered.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu looked at Han Sen strangely. Han Sen and Bald Guy did
not know who Night God No Moon was, but she did.</p>
<p>It was a legend just below Qin Xiu, but Night God No Moon was
not as famous as Qin Xiu. That was because Night God No Moon had
not become the Qin Kingdom’s king. She was merely a teacher.</p>
<p>In the Qin Kingdom, there were a few women grand teachers. Night
God No Moon was one who was not as famous. Thus, she had not
appeared to be too special.</p>
<p>In Night God No Moon’s era, the Qin Kingdom had turned to a
system of law. The king then was called the alpha king. He was the
first king. Li Bing Yu had seen the records of Wu Wei Dao Palace.
She read a classified file about Night God No Moon. That woman
teacher was the one who started the changes in the Qin Kingdom. She
was integral to the process of the waning kingdom reclaiming its
former glory.</p>
<p>Back then, Night God No Moon took advantage of Wu Wei Dao
Palace. Although it was not as bad as being kicked out of the Qin
Kingdom, they were restricted. While Night God No Moon was around,
the Wu Wei Dao Palace was unable to do anything in the Qin Kingdom.
Night God No Moon basically had used them.</p>
<p>Considering a character like that from a legend, and Han Sen
turning out just fine, it made sense that Night God No Moon had
departed. If it wasn’t like that, it would have turned out quite
scary.</p>
<p>“Bald Guy, stop talking. Hurry up and find the land pulse. It is
best if we can find a high-class gene race land pulse.” Han Sen was
impassioned about finding new gene races.</p>
<p>“Dig! We will be digging, and we have to dig hard.” Bald Guy was
emboldened. Han Sen had sorted out a scary woman, so Bald Guy did
not think there was anything more to be afraid of.</p>
<p>Bald Guy had been worried about digging up an extremely scary
land pulse, especially one they could not have dealt with. After
the last ordeal, Bald Guy knew Han Sen was stronger than he had
imagined. Since Han Sen said what he had, there was nothing more to
be afraid of.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We should go deeper into the Gold Crystal System.
This place doesn’t seem to have a high chance of getting us a rare
gene race. Let’s go hunt ourselves something bigger.” Bald Guy
gnashed his teeth. Han Sen was speechless. If he knew the chances
of getting a god-class gene race here were low, why were they even
there in the first place?</p>
<p>Still, it was fortunate Bald Guy had decided to go there. If
they had not stopped there, Han Sen would have missed the chance of
encountering Night God No Moon. Bald Guy summoned the God Wind
Dragon and took Han Sen and Li Bing Yu away from the planet. They
went deeper into the Gold Crystal System.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu quickly realized that Bald Guy was rather useful.
Earlier, she had not thought highly of him. She had not thought he
understood land pulses. It had actually been because he was afraid
of going to Ghost Starlight Land.</p>
<p>Normally, big land pulses were followed by scary weird scenes.
No one could have blamed Bald Guy for not wanting to go. Bald Guy
led Han Sen to one of the seven places. Ghost Starlight Land was
one of them.</p>
<p>The God Wind Dragon had yet to get close to the planet when they
saw a group of flying gene race knights patrolling the outskirts of
the planet. They were not letting anyone get close to the planet.
Clearly, someone rather important had already laid claim to the
zone.</p>
<p>When Bald Guy saw them from afar, his face instantly changed.
“That is Sky King’s Sky Wing Knights. We should just go somewhere
else.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard about Sky King before. He was one of the kings
who had a different surname. He was one of the ones with authority.
He was a highly valuable asset to the Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>Of course, Sky King was famous because he and his people were
nobles through heritage. They had an Annihilation class god temple.
Every generation was blessed by the Annihilation God Spirit.</p>
<p>The Gold Crystal System was massive, so there was no reason for
Han Sen to start a rivalry with Sky King. He was just going to
follow Bald Guy and leave.</p>
<p>They hadn’t gone in a new direction for long when they suddenly
heard a scary beast sound come from behind. The three of them
looked back. They saw the planet, which was surrounded by Sky Wing
Knights, burst with light. The gold god light fired into the sky.
The planet, which had a rocky terrain, was suddenly turning into an
ocean of lava. The entire planet was like a newborn sun. Its
temperature was getting higher and higher.</p>
<p>The scariest part was that there was a green sprout within the
burning lava sea. It was growing large vines amid the fire. It
quickly developed into a giant vine that was hundreds of miles
long. It was still growing fast.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, wood element plants or gene races were afraid of
fire, but it was like this giant vine was absorbing fire to
grow.</p>
<p>The planet was burning, and the vine was growing swiftly. Not
long later, it was around 10,000 miles long. It looked like a green
monster resting atop lava.</p>
<p>The Sky Wing Knights on that planet came flying away from it.
Many of them were melting from the lava’s high temperature. Not
even their bodies remained intact. The knights able to escape felt
relieved. Suddenly, vines from somewhere else shot out of the lava
and grabbed them. It was shockingly fast. The vines were like a
nest of wild snakes. After wrapping up their bodies, the vines
pulled them down into the sea of lava. They cried horridly in the
lava sea.</p>
