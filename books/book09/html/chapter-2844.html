<h2>Scapegoat</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2844</h3>

<p>“A time and space real super god body with Huangfu Jing’s
personal super strong attack powers makes her a killing queen-kind
of existence.” Han Sen could not help but compliment her.</p>
<p>“Interesting time and space movement talents. Since when have
crystallizers been so talented?” God squinted and looked at Huangfu
Jing exiting the stage with elegance.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He did not say anything. He knew the
more he said, the more he would expose.</p>
<p>It was unknown it was deliberate, but God asked Han Sen, “What
do you think?”</p>
<p>“That is an interesting talent, but primitive deified level is
too low,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>
<p>“It does not matter the level of an interesting creature,” God
harshly replied. “Even if someone becomes true god, boring people
are still boring.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but I am not interested in any other creature,” Han
Sen said. “I just want to know if I can get into the top 100 to
claim the rewards on offer.”</p>
<p>“You must work harder,” God said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Do you not see me working hard?” Han Sen picked up a hunk of
flesh from the Ink Feather God Bird. It was freshly cooked. He
inserted it into his mouth. He used Consume to refine it. He was
also waiting for the third match of the geno god list to start.</p>
<p>“Consume is the geno art of the Consume Ants. It is weird that
you can make use of Consume and eat xenogeneic genes to evolve.
That evolution power is very rare in the universe.” God looked at
Han Sen with interest.</p>
<p>“You can have a slice if you want,” Han Sen said with a
smile.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will not deny the offer.” Han Sen had only said
it for fun, but God really wanted to try some out. God picked up
some ink feather god bird meat and started to chew it. Its mouth
and hands were full of grease. “It tastes so good.”</p>
<p>Han Sen could not be bothered talking to God. When he saw the
people in the third match, he felt compelled to throw up the ink
feather bird god meat he had just eaten.</p>
<p>Space Garden… Sword Fairy… Han Sen was thinking about who might
use that name. Aside from Gu Qingcheng, there was no other.</p>
<p>Of course, not long later, Gu Qingcheng, who was wearing green
clothes, appeared on the space battleground. She floated in like a
fairy. Her opponent was a deified of the Extreme King. The great
coincidence here was that the Extreme King deified was also using a
sword, but it was a greatsword.</p>
<p>“Huh, it is her.” Upon seeing Gu Qingcheng, God was shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew God knew Gu Qingcheng, but he still asked, “What?
Do you know her? Is she famous?”</p>
<p>“She is a very interesting spirit,” God said with a smile. “She
is one of the very few that did not make a wish before me. I did
not expect she would show up here. This will be interesting, to say
the least.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, It must not be incorrect. This God is the God
the seventh team encountered.</p>
<p>When many spirits in the universe heard the words “Space
Garden,” they became excited.</p>
<p>“More deified creatures are joining from Space Garden.”</p>
<p>“In the past, the Flower Gods did not have deifieds. Why are
there two deified showing up now?”</p>
<p>Creatures that did not know what happened started asking around.
It was not long before they learned that Han Sen had taken over
Space Garden.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder Space Garden suddenly has so many deified
creatures. It is God’s Daddy who is there.”</p>
<p>“Godfather Han Sen is so strong. The power to make deified
creatures is invincible.”</p>
<p>“Barr and Queen are so strong. It looks like deified creatures
that are blessed by Han Sen are stronger than ordinary deified
creatures.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is just a coincidence. Let’s see how this Sword
Fairy performs first. There is no way that all the creatures Han
Sen blessed to become deified are stronger than usual.”</p>
<p>“Who knows? But I think Godfather Han is very powerful. He can
randomly create so many deified creatures.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid this match will not be an easy one to win. After
all, the opponent is an Extreme King deified.”</p>
<p>People had just finished talking when Gu Qingcheng revealed the
sword in her hands. She swung it and slashed toward the Extreme
King deified elite.</p>
<p>“Good timing!” the Extreme King deified coldly shouted. He
raised the greatsword as substance chains arose like the tide. They
were coming straight for Gu Qingcheng.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng’s swordlight strangely flashed through space.
Ordinary creatures were unable to see what happened. That Extreme
King deified’s chest was delivered a massive wound that exposed his
ribs. One saw a large lesion on his organs. God blood spilled like
rain. Suddenly, the face of the Extreme King deified looked
shocked. He did not let Gu Qingcheng slash again. He was quick to
concede and escape the space battleground.</p>
<p>“You took my hit and did not die. You are not bad,” Gu Qingcheng
coldly said. She put her sword away and flew out of the space
battleground.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! One slash to defeat an Extreme King deified… That is
too powerful.”</p>
<p>“This Sword Fairy is too cool. Her sword skills are so
overbearing.”</p>
<p>“Godfather Han is so strong. The deified creatures he blessed
are better and better.”</p>
<p>“I do not know how many deified creatures Godfather Han has
created, but if this keeps going, the universe is going to be
conquered by him.”</p>
<p>“Han Sen that asshole! What kind of power does he possess? How
can he make so many deified creatures that easily? How can they all
be so brutal?”</p>
<p>“You will all find a way to enter Space Garden. Capture Han Sen,
no matter the cost.”</p>
<p>Not just ordinary creatures were like this. Even the leaders of
high races had red eyes. They wanted to go to Space Garden, capture
Han Sen, and force him to make their people deified.</p>
<p>In Space Garden, Qin Xuan was worried. She said, “Han Sen always
wants us to keep a low profile. With you guys joining like that,
won’t it cause trouble?”</p>
<p>Little Uncle Wang Yuhang laughed and said, “Don’t worry. Brother
King told people Han Sen was in Space Garden. Little Sen will be
the scapegoat. It will be fine.”</p>
<p>“Ha!” Gu Qingcheng had only just returned when she heard Wang
Yuhang speak. She could not help herself from laughing.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King laughed and said, “In the future, Space Garden is
going to become so famous. Of course, we are going to use this
opportunity to improve the reputation of Space Garden and get a
reputation for San Mu too. He will be happy.”</p>
<p>“I know, right?” Bao’er was holding a big piece of fruit. She
was eating. She totally agreed and kept nodding, she clearly just
wanted to see chaos more than anything. She did not want to be
bored.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen could not be happy. The first three rounds had
three humans, including himself. That was a bit over-the-top.</p>
<p>Did God notice something and deliberately set up these matches?
Han Sen looked at God, who was eating meat. There was nothing
really suspicious about God’s behavior, so he denied the thought. I
do not think so. Otherwise, God would not have been so surprised
when he saw Gu Qingcheng. Perhaps it really was just a coincidence.
Maybe there are only those two from Space Garden joining.</p>
<p>Thinking about this possibility, Han Sen felt worse. He knew he
had reminded them many times to maintain an extremely low
profile.</p>
<p>Thinking about the personalities of those people, none of them
knew what it meant to keep a low profile. Also, Space Garden had
many resources for them. They were leveling up much faster now, so
there was no way Han Sen could keep them quiet.</p>
<p>God bless me. Please do not let these monsters find out they are
human. Han Sen still did not know he had become the scapegoat of
Space Garden, which was now overwhelmed with deifieds.</p>
