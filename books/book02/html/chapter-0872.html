    <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

    <p>
      Son of Fate&#8217;s body was supremely fast. His hands attacked Han Sen
      from each and every angle, and although he was able to block each strike,
      it was remarkable to acknowledge that Son of Fate was only using his
      fists. The force that collided with Han Sen&#8217;s Flaming Rex Spike was
      greater than the average super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to get a better reading of his
      opponent&#8217;s lifeforce. What he could see was a mess. The energy
      didn&#8217;t flow with any cohesion, and the power he had seemed to have
      come from the blood he had absorbed.
    </p>

    <p>Even dongxuan aura was unable to simulate powers such as that.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not bad! You are able to block all of my attacks; that can only
      mean your blood must be a sweet nectar. I&#8217;m looking forward to my
      first sip, boy.&#8221; Son of Fate&#8217;s face was consumed with greed or
      lust, eyeing Han Sen with the beady eyes of a snake. And just like one, he
      liked his lips with his forked tongue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Fate&#8217;s movements were incredibly odd. He didn&#8217;t quite
      seem human, as he had the ability to rotate his head
      one-hundred-and-eighty degrees.
    </p>

    <p>Pss!</p>

    <p>
      A nail clipped by the side of Han Sen&#8217;s neck, drawing blood. Son of
      Fate, at a strange angle, ravenously gorged on the blood that dripped from
      his finger. With a weird smile, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s too
      delicious!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could not explain the smile. The best he could compare it to was a
      starving wolf coming across a fresh carcass.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Son of Fate cracked the air, reaching his nails out for Han Sen&#8217;s
      heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      With his dongxuan movements, Han Sen was able to dodge. He then asked his
      foe a question, &#8220;Can I ask you why you believe me to be from Blood
      Legion? I am honest when I tell you I am not.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haha! Honest, come on, you cannot deny it. You smell like one,
      plain and simple.&#8221; Son of Fate was like an impish demon, twisting
      and rotating his body and limbs in a grotesque fashion, an acrobatic feat
      no human could ever hope to perform. His hands kept reaching out for Han
      Sen&#8217;s neck as he went.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was able to dodge each attempted strike, and as he did, he pulled
      out his nine-life cat necklace. Then he asked, &#8220;Is this what you
      smell?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      When Son of Fate saw the necklace, he froze. His black eyes stared at the
      nine-life cat necklace as he began to shiver.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Relic&#8230; hahaha! The Blood King watches over me, guiding me to
      its finding.&#8221; He spoke with a tone that was a mixture of both joy
      and grief. It was creepy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at his face, and understood what he meant. The relic he
      needed was the necklace Han Sen had always carried.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why would great grandpa possess a relic from Blood Legion?&#8221;
      Han Sen knew where the necklace came from, but instead of this providing
      clarity, it only confused him more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to ask something, but Son of Fate attacked like an enraged,
      toxic snake in a bid to snatch the nine-life cat necklace away from Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this a relic belonging to Blood Legion? What does it do? And why
      are you here?!&#8221; Han Sen kept on dodging as he fired his questions,
      hoping this encounter could elucidate certain things and provide the
      answers he has long sought.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Son of Fate ignored his questions, and his eyes suggested he was
      fixated on the necklace and the necklace alone. His whole body was getting
      red in excitement, and it was clear that his power was growing alongside
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could see his blood beginning to boil and burn, increasing his
      strength. His desire for the necklace was driving him insane, like a devil
      straight from hell.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nails were swung with greater vigor, and one swing nicked Han
      Sen&#8217;s face. Son of Fate licked every droplet of blood he had managed
      to steal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Answer my questions!&#8221; Han Sen coldly looked at Son of Fate,
      acknowledging how powerful his opponent was.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen did not care. Right now, he wanted answers more than anything,
      and that was what he was determined to get. Nothing would stop him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Your fate is to be a sacrifice to me. There is no need for you to
      know anything else. Simmer down, boy.&#8221; Son of Fate&#8217;s eyes were
      still full of greed, and his face twitched with a lust for murder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stopped dodging his attacks and instead swung his fist towards
      him.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      A giant bolt of lightning was discharged between them both, deafeningly
      loud.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sonic-Thunder Punch was unable to mess up his opponent&#8217;s lifeforce,
      due to his energy already being messed up.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the thunder power was effective in semi-paralyzing his enemy, slowing
      him down considerably.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s body expanded, growing to become a three-meter-tall silver
      ape. The strong arm picked Son of Fate up into the air, by grabbing him by
      the head.
    </p>

    <p>Pang! Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, still clutching his head, drove his body into the ground, again
      and again.
    </p>

    <p>
      He pummeled him in this way countless times, and when he was done, there
      was a deep hole in the earth in the shape of Son of Fate&#8217;s body.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen threw him back down into the pit and smacked him in the head.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The power created an even deeper hole, with Son of Fate inside. His skull
      had been cracked open, and his body was twisted in a lurid fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen picked him up once more and threw a punch into his face. The nose
      was pulverized into jelly, right before the body was launched into the air
      like a cannonball. He broke many trees on his descent, before he was
      brought to a stop.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Can you answer my questions now, Son of Fate?&#8221; Han Sen stood
      in front of his beaten opponent, whose body was twisted and mashed in a
      ghastly state. No longer did Son of Fate have the wild, crazy-eyed
      momentum that drove him earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible! Impossible! Humans in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary
      should not have such power.&#8221; Son of God&#8217;s face was broken
      beyond recognition, but he had not been killed and could still muster
      words for speak. Still, his body had been broken completely, and he was
      unable to move. With obvious shock, he looked at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let me ask you something; in Blood Legion, is there a man called
      Han Jingzhi?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Son of Fate, who was dazed.
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked ready to say something, but then, it was as if he saw something
      terrifying. His pupils shrank.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible! Impossible!&#8221; Son of Fate looked as if he had seen
      a ghost, and his body began to tremble and convulse. Then, nothing. He
      froze in place, slumped on the ground.
