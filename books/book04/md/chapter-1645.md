  When Han Sen left the arena, much of the audience had yet to react. Everything had occurred so quickly, their minds were having trouble processing it.

They had expected a shocking battle, but not like that. And it ended very abruptly.

People did not know about the changes that had taken place in Han Sen’s body and Destiny’s Tower. They had only seen Han Sen summon a metal tower to crush the Armored Man, then absorb him.

“That was scary. Dollar is the scariest. An elite like Armored Man was completely suppressed!”

“Who said geno cores couldn’t beat strength? It does not matter how strong you are, you can get absorbed.”

“Dollar is too strong. He is invincible!”

“What was that tower geno core? It was so strong.”

The battle had ended a while ago by this point, but everyone was still discussing the fight between Dollar and the Armored Man. The tower geno core was the center of many discussions, as well.

Many super elites thought the tower was Destiny’s Tower, but according to the legend, it should have gone along with its master in ascension to the Fifth Sanctuary.

Humans didn’t care about where the tower came from, though. Everyone simply concerned themselves with the fight between Dollar and Armored Man. It had led to Dollar being titled the strongest human to ever exist.

Han Sen did not have time to dwell on these matters, though. He was currently standing inside Destiny’s Tower and looking at Armored Man, who was now trapped on one of the pedestals.

Armored Man yelled at him, but no matter how much he tried, he could not escape the space shield. Hissing and cursing were all he could accomplish.

“I’m going to kill you!” Armored Man repeated that more than a few times.

“Answer my questions and I might let you go.” Han Sen looked at him, and then asked, “Who are you? What is your relation to the master of Destiny’s Tower?”



Armored Man simply ignored Han Sen. He kept repeating the same few words over and over, as if he was a loon.

Han Sen asked a few more questions, but there was no change in response. So Han Sen decided to let him be until he calmed down. He could return to ask him questions another time.

Han Sen was very curious about the Armored Man and the Headless Rockman in the tower.

Since Armored Man disappeared after his fight with Han Sen and did not finish any other matches, people believed he had been killed. It made them all fear Dollar even more. So, no one dared fight Han Sen in the next few matches. They were afraid of his tower.

Even spirits that were able to respawn did not want to take a risk. It was okay being killed, but finding themselves trapped inside the tower would be the most terrifying situation they could think of.

After advancing through the top-ten Son of God’s, Dollar ended up at the lofty number-one position. Furthermore, it was Han Sen’s very first number-one Son of God position achieved in a Divinity’s Bout.

He had joined a couple Divinity’s Bouts before, but for various reasons, he was always unable to reach first place.

Everyone was in agreement that Dollar was the most powerful being to exist in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

When Han Sen finished the Divinity’s Bout, he entered the Martial Hall to receive his reward.

The tenth Son of God had one randomized chance of a random item. It might have been a beast soul, a geno weapon, or a geno core. What they received was all down to pure luck.

Han Sen was interested in what other rewards he might now be fortunate enough to receive. He was interested in the God’s Baptism.

Han Sen placed his hand on the Martial Hall’s tablet. It began to glow, and then an item was revealed. It then began to flash through different items, making Han Sen’s eyes go all funny.



“What reward should I accept?” Han Sen wanted to borrow some luck off God, but there was nothing there he truly wanted.

In the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, he was practically invincible. There was no point in getting a super beast soul, as all he could do with that was sell it off or give it to a friend.

The same applied to geno cores and geno armors. What Han Sen wanted to do was ascend to the Fifth Sanctuary and see if he could go back to the Alliance.

“Received one pet beast soul geno core.”

When the light stopped, Han Sen froze.

“Pet beast soul geno core? What is that?” Han Sen was surprised, seeing what his reward had been.

Beast souls were beast souls, and geno cores were geno cores. A pet beast soul was a pet beast soul, by this logic.

On the tablet, Han Sen could now see a glowing orb. It became a shining light that entered Han Sen’s Sea of Soul. Little Angel saw it and flew right over to it. She grabbed the orb and swallowed it.

Little Angel’s holy light began to show unsteadiness, but it calmed down after a while. And when it did, Little Angel looked different. Han Sen reviewed her information, though, and he couldn’t see any changes. She seemed the same.

But now was not the time to investigate Little Angel. He needed to receive his second reward; something Han Sen believed to be rather important.

Han Sen put his hand on the Martial Hall’s tablet again. The tablet then revealed a slit, which Han Sen’s hand fell into. Han Sen was familiar with this, as it was what led him to the arena. He wasn’t afraid of this process, and so he immediately went inside.

After he traveled through the tablet this time, though, he was not taken to the arena. He was taken to a tunnel. The path was tubular, as if he was traversing a pipe. It was three meters long, and it appeared to have been made of flawless, seamless crystal.

Han Sen, seeing the way ahead, was shocked. The crystal looked like that of the crystallizer’s Main Control Room.

“Is the sanctuary related to the crystallizers?” Han Sen frowned and walked forward. There were glowing lights residing within the crystal walls. The lights were like tangible feathers, bathing Han Sen, and melting into him like snowflakes.

Han Sen felt a surge of electricity course through him and get discharged. He did not feel stronger, and he didn’t feel as if he had been purified. He wasn’t quite sure what the purpose of those lights was.

The passage was long, at least ten thousand meters from one end to the other. At the very end of it, Han Sen found a large door. Before he could open it, though, it opened itself automatically. There was a room beyond it.

Han Sen looked into the room, and when he did, his eyes opened wide.
