<p>Londo&#8217;s cow feet were still being corroded. It seemed as if his cow feet were going to melt off.</p>

<p>Evil Lotus moved his hand. A knife light flashed by. He cut off Londo&#8217;s cow feet. Everyone watched the cow feet melt into liquid.</p>

<p>Losing his cow feet was not much for a deified like Londo, but the pain made him turn pale. His forehead was dripping with sweat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister God, what is this red liquid? How can it corrode a god body?&#8221; Second Uncle asked with a frown.</p>

<p>The reason he asked was not that he wanted to know what the liquid was. It was because he did not want to keep digging.</p>

<p>They were digging into the houses of true god xenogeneics in the middle of a large battlefield. If he kept digging, it was hard to imagine what more dangers they would end up finding.</p>

<p>Evil Lotus coldly said, &#8220;That is the Holy Kirin&#8217;s blood. It has pure and true gene powers. They can combine with any gene. If any creature&#8217;s gene touches the blood of the Holy Kirin, it will be absorbed. Even true god class deifieds do not dare touch the body of the Holy Kirin. Now, seeing the holy blood here, I can confirm that the Holy Kirin really did die here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy Kirin&#8217;s gene power is so powerful,&#8221; Second Uncle said. &#8220;It can still consume the genes of other creatures even after it died. If we cannot touch the blood, how do we keep on digging?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evil Lotus saw the soil that possessed the red liquid. After a pause, he quietly said, &#8220;Well, dig someplace else. Just try to avoid the Kirin blood as best as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although no one wanted to dig anymore, they had no choice if Evil Lotus was forcing them. They just changed their digging location and went along with what they were told to do.</p>

<p>They did not dare to dig near the gate anymore. Fortunately, the East Holy Garden was a big open garden. If this was before, there would have been a bai sema guarding it. Now, East Holy Garden had become a ruin. There were no more bai sema there. People were able to just walk right into the garden. Evil Lotus selected a spot for Han Sen and the others to keep digging.</p>

<p>This time, the place they were digging was a palace with visible soil. It was unknown how tall the palace was. They could only see the corridor. The rest was buried in the sand.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought, Evil Lotus&#8217;s power is stronger than Second Uncle&#8217;s, but he does not dare to dig. He is clearly scared of Holy Kirin. The phoenix feather and phoenix flame were capable of killing Sky Vine Radish. So, it looks like true god elites can battle gods. But there is still something amiss.</p>

<p>Second Uncle and the others were worried as they dug up the sand. They were staying focused. After digging a few dozen feet, they only saw the top of the palace. God knew how many floors there were. As they kept digging, they found more red sand down below. It had clearly been tainted by the Kirin blood.</p>

<p>Second Uncle and the others stopped digging. They did not dare continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister God, there is Kirin blood here too,&#8221; Second Uncle politely said. &#8220;Should we change where we dig?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evil Lotus nodded. So, they changed their position. After changing places a few times and digging a few dozen few down, they again saw more of the red sand. It was like the whole bottom of the East Holy Garden had the Holy Kirin blood.</p>

<p>Evil Lotus' face turned gloomy. Second Uncle said, &#8220;Mister God, Holy Kirin must have died in East Holy Garden. Now, East Holy Garden is full of Holy Kirin&#8217;s blood. Even if we are willing to keep digging, we cannot dig out the Holy Kirin&#8217;s body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you cannot dig it out, then there is only one way,&#8221; Evil Lotus coldly said. &#8220;Open the top of the palace&#8217;s corridor and see what is inside it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone thought they could stop digging, but they still had to continue. Now, they were digging into a house instead of soil.</p>

<p>This palace was made of stone, and it was extremely hard. Second Uncle used all his power to strike it, but and he only left a crack. Everyone kept pounding it for a few dozen hours. Eventually, they broke a hole in the palace&#8217;s top.</p>

<p>Looking down through the hole, they saw that the palace was still fine. They saw many drawings and statues around.</p>

<p>&#8220;You. Go in and take a look.&#8221; Evil Lotus pointed at Londo.</p>

<p>Clearly, Evil Lotus was afraid that the palace had been booby-trapped. He did not dare to go first.</p>

<p>Londo was hesitant, but he had to listen to the command. He reluctantly went in via the hole. Everyone watched Londo land in the palace. Nothing weird happened, so they felt relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no traps or tricks in the palace.&#8221; Londo walked back and forth in the palace a few times. He did not discover anything. Evil Lotus felt safe enough to enter the palace.</p>

<p>The wall of the palace was engraved with the images of all kinds of animals, and the statues in the hall were shaped like Kirins. They were statues of the Kirin in all kinds of shapes and sizes on both sides of the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kirin statue does not look like it was carved. It looks like pottery.&#8221; Bao Qin looked at one of the Kirin statues, which was 6 feet high.</p>

<p>Second Uncle squatted in front of a broken Kirin statue. He picked up a piece, looked at it, and said, &#8220;It is pottery.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he was talking, Second Uncle used some strength to break the pottery piece. He frowned and said, &#8220;Weird. Why does the Holy Kirin have so many Kirin statues made of pottery? The material of the pottery seems quite average. It is not as hard as the sand outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evil Lotus looked around the palace. Inside the three-layered palace, he did not find anything else. Every floor had many Kirin statues made of pottery. It seemed as if the palace had been used to store pottery.</p>

<p>As he looked at the Kirin statues, Meng Lie said, &#8220;Holy Kirin would not just put some useless pottery here. Maybe there is something special about the pottery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s break some pottery and find out if there is anything inside,&#8221; Evil Lotus said to Meng Lie.</p>

<p>Meng Lie wanted to smack himself in the head. He should not have spoken so much. He was used to being with Fourth Uncle, so he often spoke whatever came to mind. He did not expect this.</p>

<p>Although he did not want to take such a risk, with Evil Lotus' stare, Meng Lie chose to break a small Kirin pottery statue. It was around half the size of the average human. He generated a gold light to strike the pottery from afar.</p>

<p>The pottery broke. It was weak and fragile, just like ordinary pottery pieces.</p>

<p>Everyone was startled and fell back. They were all afraid something might jump out of the pottery. They quickly realized that the pottery was empty. There was nothing contained inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing.&#8221; Under orders from Evil Lotus, Meng Lie broke another two Kirin statues. They were just as empty. There was nothing inside them.</p>

<p>Everyone looked at Evil Lotus to await his judgment. Evil Lotus&#8217;s face changed. His exposed hair and skin were burning like mad. A red light was glowing.</p>
