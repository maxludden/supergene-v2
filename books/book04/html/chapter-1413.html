      “Are you insinuating that the entire human race originated in the
      sanctuaries?” Han Sen screamed and felt his voice crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is the secret Blood Legion has harbored since our founding.” Mister
      Li said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s in the Fifth Sanctuary?” Han Sen asked, as what Mister Li said was
      too shocking. He wanted answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li shook his head and answered, “That is what we all wish to know.
      Whether it will eventually become common knowledge is uncertain, but
      become a god yourself and you’re sure to find out.”
    </p>
    <p>“Then who is Han Jinzhi? What happened with him?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li smiled and said, “He’s just… a liar. I thought he possessed the
      power necessary to help me locate the relic, but he didn’t help me. He
      wreaked havoc amongst the legion, stole my map, and took the relic for
      himself. Evidently, he then gave it to you.”
    </p>
    <p>Everything Mister Li was telling Han Sen shocked him.</p>
    <p>
      The Qi Gong Master Han Jinzhi was a liar who had managed to trick the
      entirety of Blood Legion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen tried to collect all the intel he had gathered thus far in his
      head, and he tried to organize the whole story by laying it all out on a
      table in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans were beings originating from the sanctuaries, the place where Blood
      Legion had been created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Asura, the being that created Blood Legion became a god, then somehow
      went to the Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asura created the shura, whereas humans reproduced more humans. Another
      chapter of the Blood Legion organization was also formed in the Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baby Ghost was a member of Blood Legion in the sanctuaries, whereas Mister
      Li was a member of the Alliance chapter of Blood Legion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans were unable to return to the sanctuaries for the longest time,
      leaving behind a grand portion of their history there. When technological
      advancements reached a certain point, humans were able to teleport in and
      out of the sanctuaries as they pleased and explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen met the self-proclaimed leader earlier, the shadow could have
      been a reflection of the person before he became a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought the vat of knowledge he had learned from Mister Li was
      quite unbelievable, but not entirely implausible. That meant the people he
      saw before were ancient humans.
    </p>
    <p>It was no wonder the shadow kept referring to Han Sen as his child.</p>
    <p>
      And Han Sen did not know why Mister Li required the relic. It was entirely
      possible, after seeing the power he had just exhibited, that the man had
      wanted the relic to become a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hired the Qi Gong Master Han Jinzhi to help him locate the relic,
      perhaps because he could not do this by himself. But Han Jinzhi tricked
      the entirety of Blood Legion and even took the map for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought Han Jinzhi had procured the map himself, and he had merely
      asked Uncle Bug for assistance in locating the relic and Life Door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought something had to be wrong with this tale, and he had more
      to ask Mister Li, so he asked, “Did Han Jinzhi join before or after the
      discovery of the sanctuaries?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li looked at him with disdain and said, “If Han Jinzhi didn’t steal
      our research, how would the Alliance have created teleporters? The
      Alliance was merely lucky to have crystallizer technology.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Jinzhi was in the seventh team, the place they supposedly
      ventured to was the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technology had not yet matured, however, and the realm they ended up
      in might have been the Fifth Sanctuary. They could have ended up there
      right off the bat, completely unaware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not sure what happened there exactly, but from what he had
      gathered, the people in that team had been tricked by a being or a deity
      that referred to itself as God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Jinzhi must have known about the sanctuaries he was trying to access,
      but Han Sen couldn’t help but wonder why the man had made a wish. He
      didn’t understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he wanted answers for everything, Han Sen knew he’d have one more
      destination to reach: the Fifth Sanctuary. Once he got there, he knew
      everything would become clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was this shelter once occupied by the leader who later went on to become
      a god?” Han Sen asked Mister Li.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li nodded and then spoke with pride in his voice. “This was indeed
      the leader’s shelter. Only his children can access this place, and not
      even a god could enter if he had no affiliation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, pondering these revelations, then thought of something. He
      wondered why the heirs of Asura were unable to enter the sanctuaries. He
      also wanted to know how a god could be damaged and allow itself to be
      killed by Asura in the Third God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could not be 100% percent certain he was being told the truth
      concerning these matters, but these pieces of the puzzle fit the
      information he had previously gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the relic?” Han Sen asked, looking up at the Nine-Life Cat that
      was still perched upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That would be a geno core belonging to our ancestor, who’s name I
      admittedly do not know. It was formed after he became a god.” Mister Li
      turned his bloodshot eyes over to the Nine-Life Cat and went on to say,
      “And that is the guardian creature of the shelter. I am not sure of its
      association with that ancestor, but I am well aware the geno core looks
      just like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to ask even more, but Mister Li gave him a queer smile. He
      said, “Time’s up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s face changed. He knew what was happening, and so he threw a
      punch towards Mister Li.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the hit could land, the coffin began to shine with a bright light
      as the lid removed itself. Then, Mister Li hopped inside with the last of
      his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I am reborn, I will rise as a god!” Mister Li’s voice rang out as
      the lid of the sarcophagus closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen gripped the lid and tried to pull it away, but no matter how hard
      he pulled, it would not budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Save your strength; that is a relic belonging to God. None can open it if
      it does not want to be opened.”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen suddenly heard the Nine-Life Cat begin to talk.</p>
