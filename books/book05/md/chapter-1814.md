  Han Sen ran forward and looked back. There was nothing behind him.

When he looked at his shoulder, he saw nothing there. He felt as if something was sitting there, but he just couldn’t see it.

Suddenly, the colors on Han Sen’s shoulder became blurry. He saw that a creature, like a chameleon, had just appeared.

And then, the colors began to shift again. The creature was blending back into its environment. Even at such a close distance, Han Sen couldn’t see it anymore.

“Surely it can’t have come out of that weird ball,” Han Sen thought.

Although the little creature had only just appeared, it looked like a straight-up monster. It was simply small, that was all. It was around the size of a man’s hand. And now, Han Sen had an answer for why the ball was no longer in the pool. The creature could change color to avoid being seen.

The little thing’s color changed again. It went to his right shoulder, changed color, and disappeared again.

“That is so powerful. It is practically invisible,” Han Sen thought, as he watched the little thing change its colors. It was so close to him, and yet, Han Sen could not see it at all.

“Did you come out of the ball?” Han Sen asked. He wasn’t sure if the creature could hear him. But it seemed as if it did. It revealed itself, nodded, and then disappeared again.

Han Sen was no longer worried. It was certainly not a hostile creature. So, he went ahead and exited the circular chamber. “Oh no!” Han Sen noticed that both Yisha and Hawk Wing, whom he had knocked out, were gone.

The cocoon had apparently risen into the air again, and there were many paths to the outside available. The whole cocoon was glowing.

Han Sen would have liked to leave the same way he had entered, but the white liquid under the bridge had started to rage. It was like a fountain, hosing the entirety of the cocoon.

A hole appeared in the top of the cocoon, and a white pillar suddenly descended through it. It caught Han Sen’s body and pushed him back through the air, heading downwards out of the cocoon.

When he exited, the group of monsters came running towards Han Sen. They surrounded him. The little monster walked directly before Han Sen and looked at him.

The little thing on Han Sen’s shoulder revealed itself before jumping into the little monster’s hands. The little monster was so happy as it held the little creature up to the sky. It roared.

The group of monsters also roared alongside him. It was like a cult, all singing praise.

Not long after, the noise quietened and silence returned. The little monster commanded another monster to collect Han Sen. Han Sen understood how they worked now, so he decided to hop on top of the monster.

He had realized by now that he wouldn’t be able to find Yisha and Hawk Wing.

Han Sen was glad that he had managed to loot Hawk Wing’s body while he was unconscious, though. He hadn’t lost too much when Hawk Wing had run off. But Han Sen did not know if the items he had retrieved were worth it. He’d inspect them all and come to a conclusion later.

The monster started walking back, but they weren’t sending Han Sen to the Chaos. They actually went deeper into the desert.

“Hey, where are you taking me?” Han Sen’s heart sank. All he wanted to do right about now was leave. The possibility of Yisha finding him outside of Demon Grave was no laughing matter.

The monsters ignored his question. They ran for a whole day through the desert until they reached an oasis.

The oasis was even bigger than the one where the Chaos lived. The fruit there were in abundance, and every vine held clusters of the fruit

The monster put him down, and then the little monster pointed at the fruit and pointed at Han Sen.

“Are you saying these fruits are mine, and I can take whatever I want?” Han Sen was so happy.

Han Sen saw a xenogeneic fruit amidst the rest, and he realized there must have been many of them there. If he could take as much as he wanted to, he could receive a lot

The little monster nodded, and so Han Sen picked up an apple that looked like a diamond. He also took a banana that looked like yellow jade. There was even a ruby dragonfruit.

Seeing Han Sen grab so many in such a short time, the monster was given a cold sweat. He bit Han Sen by the armor and pulled him to another area.

“Why are you bringing me to this well? I’m not thirsty. Let me take some more!” Han Sen was carrying a sack full of xenogeneic fruit He sounded so greedy.

The little monster’s eyelids twitched, right before he pushed Han Sen into the well.

“It’s fine if you don’t want me to take anymore, but you didn’t have to push me into this well!” Han Sen felt depressed, finding his body in the water.

Fortunately, the little monster had only pushed him and not hurt him. Han Sen started to swim out, but he then noticed something odd. The well had vanished, and he was now in a lake nestled between two mountains.

“What is this place? And why am I here?” Han Sen was shocked as he looked up at the sky.

It was nighttime, and there were two moons in the sky. Han Sen now realized he was back on Planet Kate.

“I did not know Demon Grave had a teleporter. Those guys were pretty nice.” Han Sen was so happy. He no longer had to worry about Yisha ambushing him when he exited Demon Grave.

“Being nice always gives me a reward. Let me eat some fruit to celebrate.” Han Sen opened the sack and was quickly given a shock. The chameleon was sitting in the middle of all the fruit, and Han Sen hadn’t a clue when the little creature had managed to sneak inside.

“Damn! You sneaked out?” Han Sen asked as he picked the thing up.

The little thing did not reply. It simply changed its color and disappeared.

Far away, in the middle of the desert in Demon Grave, a bunch of monsters were roaring. It was as if that noise was going to sunder the skies.

“I can’t send you back now. I can’t go back to Demon Grave. If you have no qualm with that, then you can come with me. But what should I name you?” Han Sen receded into thought. After a lengthy amount of time passed, he said, “How about I call you Sicko? That name is cool.”

The transparent thing suddenly became red, and spikes covered its skin. Its nose was breathing faster than usual.

“Uh…you don’t like it? Let’s think of another name then, Little Homy Thing. How about Mister Chameleon? Horny Demon? Horny Wolf? Horny Dragon? Transformer?”
