<p>At that moment, the Sky Palace students felt as if giant
boulders had been lifted from their shoulders. They breathed deep
sighs of relief.</p>
<p>Han Sen was the best in the Sky Palace, but Exquisite faced him
calmly. For some time, Han Sen hadn’t been able to harm a single
hair on her head. The woman had stood against his attacks, as
steady as a mountain. Seeing Han Sen’s attacks fail had crushed the
Sky Palace students and prevented them from breathing. It made them
think Exquisite was a god that couldn’t be beaten.</p>
<p>But then, Han Sen’s knife was able to cut Exquisite’s clothing.
Seeing that small victory calmed the anxious audience.</p>
<p>“Continue,” Exquisite said. She waved her sleeves, and the Teeth
power was extinguished like someone had tossed a bucket of water
over a campfire. Han Sen waved his hand again, using Fang to attack
Exquisite. This time, he used even more power and speed.</p>
<p>Exquisite finally moved, but she only took half a step. That was
enough for Han Sen’s Fang to go wide and miss her. Even so, it
didn’t look as if she was going to fight back.</p>
<p>Han Sen pushed himself to release even more power, making the
next move a few times stronger than the last. He used his Teeth
Knife once again. Exquisite’s feet moved gracefully, lightly
sliding her to the side and letting her dodge every Teeth Knife
attack Han Sen launched. Han Sen’s Teeth Knife was unable to touch
Exquisite’s clothes a second time.</p>
<p>“Although Han Sen’s speed can break through the effect that
Exquisite is casting on the arena, he cannot catch up to her. This
isn’t a good situation for Han Sen to be in. Han Sen needs to
overcome both the skill she is using and her own innate speed,”
Thousand Feather Crane said, as he understood Han Sen’s
situation.</p>
<p>“Very High powers are so scary. It’s like they’re cheating. The
whole universe is helping her,” Yun Suyi said with depression.</p>
<p>“Of course. Otherwise, the Very High wouldn’t have become the
best race, would they? Even born-deified Ancient Gods envy their
power,” Lone Bamboo said.</p>
<p>As this was going on, Sky Palace Leader observed Han Sen with
great interest. He smiled and said, “The Very High are known for
their strength. To fight against the Very High is to fight against
the whole universe, in a sense. Although Exquisite’s level is low
and she cannot change the universe much, any of her other peers
would be at a severe disadvantage against her. Unless you are one
or two tiers higher than the Very High, it is difficult to fight
them. How Han Sen seeks to deal with this will be interesting.”</p>
<p>“You think Han Sen actually stands a chance in this fight?” the
woman asked in shock. She turned to the Sky Palace Leader with a
quizzical expression on her face. “I thought you always liked him,
too,” Sky Palace Leader said.</p>
<p>“I liked him because of his powers of blessing and the deified
weapons he wields. His talent isn’t bad. It’s probably better than
those of anyone else on his level, but his skill alone won’t be
enough to deal with the Very High. I’m not saying that Han Sen is
weak; it’s just that the Very High are too strong,” the woman
said.</p>
<p>“And yet, maybe this will work out for Han Sen anyway,” the Sky
Palace Leader said thoughtfully as he watched Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast another strike with Teeth Knife. Then, he stopped
attacking.</p>
<p>“What other geno arts do you have? Use them,” Exquisite
commanded. She still wanted to see more of Han Sen’s powers, so she
didn’t attack yet.</p>
<p>As the Sky Palace students watched Exquisite, it was as if they
were looking at a Valkyrie that couldn’t be defeated. Once again,
she had become untouchable.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t intimidated, though. He had seen Exquisite slave
away as a maid to the crocodile gods, so he couldn’t think of her
as some unbeatable creature.</p>
<p>Plus, Exquisite’s power didn’t seem entirely unbreakable to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Many Sky Palace students froze as they looked at Han Sen. If
they were in his shoes, they knew how desperate they would feel.
They wouldn’t even be able to ruffle Exquisite’s clothes. They just
wanted to know if Han Sen had a sufficient amount of power to break
Exquisite. If he was unable to break her, and Exquisite unleashed a
strike, she would only need that one skill to beat Han Sen. After
all, the universe was strengthening her might. It was hard to
imagine how crippling that strike might be.</p>
<p>Han Sen swung his hands and spoke to Exquisite. “I’ve finished
warming up. Now we begin.”</p>
<p>“Holy shit! Warming up? That was just him stretching?”</p>
<p>“Brother Han… this bluffing of yours is a bit too much.”</p>
<p>“Haha! Brother Han is Brother Han. His bluffing is so
fresh.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had been using power that only the best ninth-tier Kings
could match. There was no way that he had been holding back the
majority of his strength.</p>
<p>But even so, the Sky Palace students began to grow a little
excited again. When they looked at Exquisite, she no longer seemed
quite as untouchable as she had before.</p>
<p>When Exquisite had first turned on her Very High Eye, her
emotions seemed to disappear. She had seemed perfectly calm since
then, but now she frowned.</p>
<p>“This guy’s poker face is too good…” The Sky Palace Leader
wanted to laugh.</p>
<p>“He’s just like you when you were young,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“When I was young, I was really strong. I didn’t pretend like he
is,” the Sky Palace Leader immediately corrected her.</p>
<p>The woman rolled her eyes at him. She didn’t say anything
further, but scorn seemed to drip off of her.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace Leader was very smart, and he stopped talking.
After all, that woman knew everything about his past. “Since we’re
done practicing, let us begin,” Exquisite said very calmly. She had
only shown her emotions for the tiniest moment, and what Han Sen
said didn’t affect her much.</p>
<p>Very High’s Forget Love was no joke. Exquisite’s level with it
was low, but a deified Very High could watch her husband and
children be humiliated and killed in front of her without feeling a
single thing. “Then you must look closely.” Han Sen slowly raised
his right hand. He clenched his fingers together to make a
fist.</p>
<p>Everyone could see Han Sen preparing to unleash a punch, but he
suddenly stopped. “Have you heard the old saying?” “What saying?”
Exquisite asked.</p>
<p>“I am the greatest of my league,” Han Sen said. He said each
word slowly.</p>
<p>“No.” Exquisite knew what Han Sen meant, but her expression
never wavered. Actions spoke a lot louder than words.</p>
<p>When the Sky Palace students heard him, they thought this was
too much. But judging from Han Sen’s situation, it wasn’t too
much.</p>
<p>“Then you should learn it now.” Han Sen swung his fist.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body tore through the fabric of space, disappearing
from everyone’s vision. When he appeared again, he punched
Exquisite square in the face. Exquisite’s nose fountained blood as
her body was sent soaring away. She crashed into the sealing of the
arena with such force that even the protective shielding
shimmered.</p>
<p>As this happened, all of Sky Palace fell silent. The students
were so silent that they could have heard a rat fart.</p>
