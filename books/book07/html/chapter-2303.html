<p>“Bai Wuchang has a strange personality, so Father never planned
on letting him succeed to the throne. He still loves him dearly, of
course. Bai Wuchang is the only one who has never recruited guards
for fighting, but Father still provides him resources in order to
level up,” Bai Wei said.</p>
<p>“He takes care of him that much? Won’t the other sons and
daughter get jealous?” Han Sen asked with shock.</p>
<p>“They are more than just jealous, but none of them can do
anything about it. Father is indeed biased toward Bai Wuchang, and
he is the son of the empress. The crown prince is his big brother
from the same parents. Even though he was just a student of a
national teacher, others have to think very carefully before
risking a fight with him,” Bai Wei said.</p>
<p>“Who is the national teacher?” Han Sen did not know much about
the internal workings of Extreme King society.</p>
<p>“His name is Gu Yuan.” When Bai Wei said the name, she lowered
her voice. It looked as if talking about him made her
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You’ll hear more about him later. Anyway, just don’t accept Bai
Wuchang’s challenge no matter what you do,” Bai Wei said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t plan on fighting him, anyway.” Han Sen shrugged and
laughed. There was no way he was going to accept a challenge that
had been presented to him in that fashion. It would just be a waste
of time.</p>
<p>Bai Wei sighed and said, “That’s good. I’ve finished all the
paperwork, so let’s go.”</p>
<p>As they left the space station and headed down towards The Grave
of Soldiers and Kings, a woman sat in the control room, watching
Han Sen and Bai Wei through a camera feed.</p>
<p>The woman was extremely pretty. Just seeing her sitting there
was enough to bring people a feeling of happiness.</p>
<p>She might not have been as beautiful as women like Fox Queen,
but she looked so cold and so smart. It was impressive. It was like
everything in the world was reflected in her lake-like eyes.</p>
<p>The space station’s captain stood next to the woman. He leaned
over her and said in a flirty voice, “Miss Mirror, you can tell me
anything. I will do whatever it is you wish.”</p>
<p>“I just want to stay here quietly. Can I, captain?” the woman
answered with a smile.</p>
<p>“Of course… of course… What are you guys waiting for? Get out!
Hurry, hurry! Move faster!” The captain quickly kicked out every
worker that was present in the control room.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror, is there anything else?” After the captain kicked
out all the workers, he stood in front of the woman, smiling
obsequiously.</p>
<p>The woman only looked at the captain’s smile. She did not say
anything.</p>
<p>The captain’s face fell slightly as he registered what she meant
by this. He walked back towards the door, smiled, and bowed.
“Please rest, Miss Mirror. I will stop disturbing you…”</p>
<p>After he went out the door, the captain carefully shut it behind
him without making the slightest sound. He did not want to disturb
the woman.</p>
<p>The woman was the only one left in the control room. She sat
there elegantly, but she was too focused to look casual. She was
the prime example of what it was to look like a woman.</p>
<p>“Bai Wei, Bai Wei; why are you doing this?” The woman looked at
Bai Wei who was headed to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings. She
sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>Not long after, the woman turned her attention to Han Sen, who
was traveling alongside Bai Wei.</p>
<p>After a while, she spoke to herself. “Narrow Moon’s Knife Queen
finally took a student. He practiced in Sky Palace for a few years.
He returned to Narrow Moon when he became a Marquise, and then he
became a back-up knight for the Ice Blue Knights in the systems of
chaos. He received a deified feather from Kong Fei. His
circumstances have been favorable, but he has poor potential. The
crystallizers are a lowly race that rely on the powers of others.
Their own powers are weak, and their genes are no good. It is
difficult for them to become deified. It may feel nice for Bai Wei
to have someone with her, but using him as a Royal Guard will be
way too much effort for the lackluster returns.”</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Bai Wei to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings. The
entire planet was a graveyard, and headstones sprouted from the
ground everywhere they looked.</p>
<p>But what was buried in the earth were not creatures or beings;
they were xenogeneic weapons.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t really interested in those xenogeneic weapons. He
already had a deified Thunder God Spike and his Ghost Teeth Knife.
He really wasn’t interested in ordinary treasure weapons.</p>
<p>He would much rather find a deified-class beast soul.</p>
<p>Xenogeneic weaponry like the deified-class Thunder God Spike
wasn’t very useful for Han Sen. Instead of attacking, it could only
leave a paralytic effect on a King or a half-deified being, and
that was about it.</p>
<p>And if the Thunder God Spike wasn’t wielded by a King class
elite, its effects would be dramatically weakened.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others landed on the plaza of The Grave of
Soldiers and Kings. Nine bronze grave beasts lined each side of the
plaza. The moment Han Sen stepped onto the plaza, the eighteen
bronze beasts came alive.</p>
<p>They didn’t look as if they were going to attack Han Sen and Bai
Wei, though. They opened their mouths, then each of the beasts spat
a weapon out onto the plaza.</p>
<p>The eighteen weapons were each different, and they all sat in
front of their respective grave beast.</p>
<p>Bai Wei was in battle mode already, and she said to Han Sen,
“Each of these weapons will attack us once. We have to use our
power to repel each strike. If we do that, we will be qualified to
enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings to collect a weapon. We
aren’t allowed to use any xenogeneic treasures. If we do, it is
counted as a failure.”</p>
<p>As Bai Wei spoke, a lance gathered up a frightening amount of
power. A black flame wreathed the weapon, as if a fiery demon was
holding the lance. It came thrusting at Han Sen and Bai Wei.</p>
<p>“I will block the first nine attacks, while you block the last
nine attacks,” Bai Wei said, preparing the intercept the lance’s
attack.</p>
<p>But Han Sen stepped forward in front of Bai Wei, smiled, and
said, “Let me go first. When I cannot hold on anymore, you can take
over with your attack.”</p>
<p>As the lance flew toward them like a demonic dragon, Han Sen
summoned Jadeskin. He threw his fist against the tip of the
lance.</p>
<p>The woman in the control room frowned as she saw Han Sen send a
punch toward the lance. “The eighteen-weapon test isn’t solely for
testing the power of the royal children. It also teaches them that
different powers require unique responses. That is the only way to
pass the test. Han Sen is just fighting fire with fire. Even if he
manages to destroy the lance’s attack, his own power will be
damaged, too. When he tries to withstand the attacks of the other
weapons, the strain will become harder and harder for him. He is
strong, but he lacks a brain. A reckless man like this, well, I
have no idea how he managed to earn the same title as Lone
Bamboo.”</p>
<p>As the woman’s attention flicked back to the screen, Han Sen’s
fist had already collided with the demonic dragon lance’s tip. The
fist and the spike came against each other.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Under the force of that punch, the demonic dragon’s body was
crushed. It became dust, scattering everywhere.</p>
