<p>Han Sen searched for a few more days, but he didn’t find any goodies. However, in that time, Han Sen’s Crystal Furnace reached beginner level. After all, it was a geno art for crystallizer children. It wasn’t very difficult to come to grips with. And having crystal blood made it even easier to learn.</p>

<p>Humans were the offspring of crystallizers, so crystallizer geno arts were quite compatible with human physiology. It only took Han Sen a few days to learn the geno art, and he produced some good results to boot. Now, Han Sen was able to eat twenty to thirty King xenogeneic genes a day. And that was just at the beginner level of Crystal Furnace. If Consume, Big Destroyed, and Crystal Furnace all reached peak performance, he calculated that he could eat at least 110 xenogeneic genes a day.</p>

<p>“Crystal Furnace isn’t bad. I need to teach it to Bao’er and Ling’er, too.” When Han Sen thought about his baby daughters, it felt as if he took an arrow to the heart.</p>

<p>But escaping the fortress wouldn’t be easy. In the past, he would have tried to escape using his super god body. Because Wan’er was in his Destiny’s Tower, however, he couldn’t use his super god body for very long. Making his escape would take longer than he could maintain his invincible form.</p>

<p>Han Sen sat down and rested. He brought out one of his Alliance beverages and had a couple of sips. But after he did, the little Crocodile God ran over to him and stared at the bottle of wine. It seemed very curious.</p>

<p>Han Sen raised an eyebrow. He pulled out a cup and poured some wine for the small Crocodile God.</p>

<p>This time, the little crocodile didn’t smack the cup away with its tail. It rolled out its tongue and tentatively approached the cup.</p>

<p>Han Sen was so happy. At first he thought that the little crocodile enjoyed drinking, but instead, the Crocodile God used its tongue to lift the cup and splash itself with the contents.</p>

<p>Its scales were very high in temperature. The creature had tried to lower the heat of its scales, but when the wine touched its body, the liquid flashed into steam.</p>

<p>The small Crocodile God looked unsatisfied. So, it used its tongue to snatch the entire bottle of wine this time. It upended the bottle over itself.</p>

<p>As he watched the wonderful wine boil away, Han Sen’s heart ached. It was a bottle of the wine that Ji Yanran had prepared for him. It was a century-old, and it could no longer be purchased anywhere. It was a very rare item.</p>

<p>But the small Crocodile God seemed to really enjoy it, and its body reeked of alcohol.</p>

<p>The little Crocodile God made an inquisitive rumbling noise as Han Sen mourned the loss of his wine. It turned out that the crocodile wanted more.</p>

<p>“I don’t have any more wine. If you want, I can go back and get you some more,” Han Sen offered to the small Crocodile God.</p>

<p>The little creature nodded and gave a low roar, as if it was hurrying Han Sen to go and fetch the wine.</p>

<p>“You will let me go back? If that’s true, then I will leave.” Han Sen didn’t really believe that the creature would let him go so easily.</p>

<p>If people left the core area, they would return to the same spot that they had left. Unless they never entered the core area again, they’d be trapped.</p>

<p>But Han Sen was different. Because he had four self-cogwheels, he could show up in four different locations. He didn’t need to return to this location. If he could leave, he would be set free.</p>

<p>The small Crocodile God hurried him to leave and bring back wine. So, Han Sen generated the power to open the door to the core hall. He said to the small Crocodile God, “I really am going.”</p>

<p>The core hall’s door was open, and the small Crocodile God made no effort to stop him. And neither did the big Crocodile God. For all intents and purposes, he had permission to leave.</p>

<p>Han Sen was so happy. He hadn’t thought that he would ever be able to leave that place so easily. So, he quickly hurried through the hall’s door.</p>

<p>The small Crocodile God made no effort to stop him, and so Han Sen successfully managed to leave the core area. He returned to the safety of the white whale. His exit was so smooth that he could barely believe it.</p>

<p>“Dad, you were gone for so long. Next time you go on such a long trip, can you take me with you?” Bao’er jumped into Han Sen’s arms.</p>

<p>“You can’t go to that place.” Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>Han Sen couldn’t take people or creatures there, and even if he could, he wouldn’t dare do it.</p>

<p>If a child entered the core area, they would have to be King class. And that meant people, upon seeing a small child enter, would go crazy.</p>

<p>Seeing Bao’er’s smile, Han Sen’s heart felt warm. He used Glasses to analyze Bao’er’s genes.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t want to find out how much potential Bao’er had. He wanted to know what Bao’er’s race was. Bao’er’s race had always been a mystery, so maybe the glasses could help to resolve it once and for all.</p>

<p>The data scan of the glasses kept scrolling. A while went by, and the analysis cycled on and on. It gave Han Sen a bad feeling.</p>

<p>“Lack of data… Cannot analyze… Cannot analyze…” When Han Sen heard those words, he was disappointed.</p>

<p>But no matter what race Bao’er was, Han Sen didn’t care. As far as he was concerned, she was his genuine daughter.</p>

<p>Han Sen was going to let Glasses stop, but then he heard a voice. “Analysis complete. The genes are unstable. Gene level cannot be confirmed. Gene potential cannot be confirmed. You are her parent.”</p>

<p>“Shit! This thing really is for kids. It isn’t reliable,” Han Sen thought in annoyance. After half a day of waiting, that was the result he got.</p>

<p>Han Sen used Glasses to look at everyone on the white whale. Aside from Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng, who came from the sanctuaries, the others were analyzed in great detail and with an impressive amount of accuracy.</p>

<p>Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng had the same results as Han Sen. Their genes were unstable, and they couldn’t be analyzed.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried using Glasses to analyze the little red bird. He didn’t have much hope for success, but he was presented with something interesting.</p>

<p>Target: Phoenix (51%) and Fish-bird (49%) female</p>

<p>Gene class: Original Deified</p>

<p>Gene potential: 10 stars</p>

<p>There were many detailed pieces of information being analyzed, and it all shocked Han Sen. He hadn’t expected the little red bird’s blood to be that powerful. Its 10-star gene potential practically guaranteed that it would become a true god.</p>

<p>“His gene blood is that strong?” Han Sen curiously asked Glasses.</p>

<p>Glasses answered, “Phoenixes and fish-birds are true gods. It has the blood of both, and while its growth speed might be slow, there is a high chance it can become a true god. Its chances of failure are practically zero, but it will require a lot of materials to become a true god. It has a higher chance than a creature that is born purely a phoenix or a fish-bird.”</p>

<p>After Han Sen heard this, he closed his eyes in exhaustion for a long moment. He had been growing the little red bird all this time, and upon hearing this, he now knew he would have to gather a lot more resources for the bird in the future.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the others in the white whale and assumed that the information on them was accurate. Then, he looked at Wan’er who was asleep in Destiny’s Tower.</p>

<p>Glasses had to run longer for her than it did for the little red bird, but only one word was presented as a result: Sacred.</p>

<p>There was nothing more than that. It analyzed the race, but the only result was a name. There were no details or other content.</p>
