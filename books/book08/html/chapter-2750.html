<h2>Powerful Slashing and Killing</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2750</h3>

<p>The part of it that Han Sen could see was only about the size of
a kitchen table. Han Sen couldn’t tell what it was, but the
creativity of humans could be rather amazing. Han Sen had already
been thinking about the true god dragon, so when he saw the glowing
object, his heart leaped. His brain flashed with an idea. “No
matter which way you look at it, this thing looks like a giant
dragon scale. This cannot be the body of the legendary true god
class evil dragon, can it?”</p>
<p>After the electric eel ate the blood coral, it continued to
twist and convulse. Its body was growing redder and redder.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you while you are sick! This is a nifty opportunity.”
Han Sen stopped hesitating. While the electric eel was still
writhing in pain, Han Sen began to generate power using Ghost Teeth
Knife. He teleported next to the electric eel, aimed at the beast’s
belly, and unleashed his swing.</p>
<p>The electric eel was in too much pain, and it had no chance of
protecting itself. Han Sen’s knife stabbed toward the creature’s
belly, but the blade only left a small mark across the red scales.
It didn’t harm the electric eel too much, but the eel was already
thrashing so badly that it almost whacked Han Sen with its
tail.</p>
<p>Holding his shield up to protect himself, Han Sen stabbed the
creature a few more times. He cut a small wound into its stomach.
In response, the electric eel’s tail slapped Han Sen’s shield,
sending him flying a few hundred meters.</p>
<p>When Han Sen teleported back, the wounds he had inflicted were
being healed. They were healing so fast that he watched them seal
back up.</p>
<p>“Ghost Teeth Knife really is useless now. I really have to find
myself a deified knife at some point. The Buddha stole my knife
blank, and I heard a while back that it got refined into a deified
treasure. If I have the chance, I’m going to get my knife blank
back,” Han Sen thought to himself. Now that Ghost Teeth Knife was
no longer useful for combat, he would have to rectify this
situation sooner or later.</p>
<p>Now that the electric eel had consumed the blood coral, its body
had grown stronger. Its healing power had also intensified. Even
Ghost Teeth Knife’s ripping power couldn’t stop the wounds from
healing. It was a very strong foe to contend with.</p>
<p>But at this time, the electric eel was also in incredible
duress. It continued to writhe around on the sea bed, and it didn’t
have time to deal with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“If I let it continue to change without killing it, I won’t
stand a chance later,” Han Sen thought to himself. He made up his
mind, and a weird shockwave of power emerged from his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body changed fast. Ordinarily, the Dongxuan Armor and
his Spell armor couldn’t be used at the same time. However, when
Han Sen and Spell combined to become a xenogeneic together, their
powers were fused into one. Not just those two powers, either. The
Blood-Pulse Sutra and Jadeskin were also a part of the furious
mix.</p>
<p>The four powers combined in a special way, making fundamental
changes throughout Han Sen’s body. He was now releasing a presence
like a xenogeneic. His body looked like the dark form of some
ruthless demon.</p>
<p>It combined coldness and passion, holiness and evil, weirdness
and beauty. It was a disturbing, chaotic scene. It was completely
different from how Han Sen usually operated.</p>
<p>At that moment, Han Sen no longer looked like a human. He looked
like a cold and heartless xenogeneic demon king.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked impassively at the electric eel that was
twitching with pain. In his hand, he clutched Ghost Teeth Knife. It
seemed to have been infected by his weird power. The purple and
black colors of the knife became a pitch-black flame. Even the
knife air darkened to black.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted his Ghost Teeth Knife, and he could feel that the
energy within him was now incredibly strong. Four types of battle
bodies had merged into one, forming a xenogeneic battle body. Han
Sen’s battle power had become an inferno.</p>
<p>“I wonder if this xenogeneic battle body’s power is enough to
kill the electric eel now. If it can’t, that would be rather
annoying,” Han Sen thought idly. He slashed toward the electric eel
that was writhing around in pain.</p>
<p>With that xenogeneic battle body’s boon of power, Ghost Teeth
Knife’s black flame roared to insane heights. It carried a scary
knife air to slash across the electric eel’s belly.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The diamond-like scales and hardened flesh of the electric eel
were ripped open by Ghost Teeth Knife. Han Sen’s knife sank inside
the beast, all the way to the hilt.</p>
<p>Han Sen was delighted by this result. He lifted his knife and
slashed the foe again. He cut the creature’s belly open from one
end to the other. The blood and internal organs spilled out all
over the sea floor.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic transmutation deified killed: Space Electric Eel.
Deified xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Space Electric Eel beast
soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had never expected to kill the electric eel with such
ease. He looked at the Ghost Teeth Knife in his hand in shock.</p>
<p>When he shook off his shock, Han Sen was crazily happy. His
xenogeneic battle body was far more powerful than he thought it
could be. He had killed a transmutation deified xenogeneic with
ease.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect my xenogeneic battle body to be so strong. Such
a scary power. I’m afraid it might be as strong as when I use super
god spirit body.” Han Sen was filled with unfiltered joy at the
thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen retreated a little, allowing the blood to drain out of
the electric eel’s carcass for a while. Once the blood had drained,
he could get a better look inside the electric eel’s belly. In
addition to the creature’s organs, the weird blood coral was still
inside the eel.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mind might have been playing tricks on him, but the
weird blood coral now looked even more like a dragon. The details
were more defined than they had been. As he examined, Han Sen
halfway expected the thing to open its eyes and fly away.</p>
<p>Patterns were etched across the coral now, although Han Sen had
no idea how they had gotten there. Perhaps the stomach acid of the
electric eel had made them. Regardless, the patterns made the coral
look even more like a dragon scale.</p>
<p>“This thing looks a bit evil. If the electric eel hadn’t eaten
this thing, I would have killed it so easily.” As Han Sen examined
the blood coral, he started to feel that something was wrong.</p>
<p>The blood of a deified creature wouldn’t blend into the sea
water. It should sink to the bottom and pool there. However, Han
Sen saw no blood pooling on the sea floor around him. Even the
organs that fell out of the carcass were now clean, devoid of even
a speck of blood.</p>
<p>“Where did all the god blood go?” Han Sen stared at the blood
coral that looked like a real dragon. The red light was growing
brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>“This thing can’t be alive, can it?” Han Sen watched the blood
coral warily, but it sank to the bottom without showing much of a
reaction.</p>
<p>He watched it for a while, but the chunk of blood coral didn’t
move. Then, Han Sen gathered up his power and grabbed the blood
coral. He thought it would react when he touched it, but he picked
the item up with ease. It was like an ordinary, living chunk of
coral.</p>
<p>He examined it thoroughly, but it continued to sit silently in
his palms, just as he would expect from an ordinary chunk of coral.
He put it aside and swam into the hole it had made in the sea
floor.</p>
<p>“If the evil dragon’s body is really down here, I’m going to be
mega-rich,” Han Sen thought to himself as he descended into the
hole.</p>
