<p>“I can’t control it much longer. It’s going to kill you. Run!”
the little girl said, the panic in her voice growing.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the little girl holding that knife. Her hands
continued to bleed profusely. As her blood continued to flow the
blade, the sharp knife’s presence faded a little. It wasn’t gone,
though. The knife’s aura was still there, pressing out against the
little girl’s hand. It moaned gently. Han Sen knew that if the
little girl stopped giving it blood, the knife would immediately go
after him again.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave then. Can you tell me how to exit this planet? And
also, what is your name?” Han Sen knew that if he stayed, he would
only be causing the little girl more pain. He crouched down as he
prepared to leap up into the sky.</p>
<p>The little girl shook her head. “I don’t know. You just need to
get away from here, as far as you possibly can.”</p>
<p>“Fine. What is your name, though?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Gu Wan’er. You should leave now. Get as far away from here as
you can, and don’t come back until I am gone,” the little girl
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was ready to leave, but when he heard her name, his body
went completely still. He looked at the little girl in shock, and
he asked her, “Your name is Gu Wan’er? Do you know Lone
Bamboo?”</p>
<p>Han Sen remembered that Lone Bamboo had once mentioned his
little sister was called Wan’er because Pray to God was taken away
by God. It was an incident that the man was never able to let
go.</p>
<p>If Han Sen remembered things correctly, Lone Bamboo’s sister was
around ten years old when she was taken away. It had been many
years since then, so Gu Wan’er should have been a grown-up. Finding
her in a child’s body was quite the surprise.</p>
<p>“You… you know my big brother…” A sudden smile bloomed over Gu
Wan’er’s face as she looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I know him. We are good friends. Why are you here? What is this
place?” Han Sen glanced at Wan’er’s sharp knife, then walked closer
to her.</p>
<p>He could have simply left if they were strangers. Now that he
knew this little girl was Lone Bamboo’s sister, though, he couldn’t
just leave.</p>
<p>“This is God’s Farm. It is like a buffet for God’s Knife. God
brought me here to take care of the knife…” Gu Wan’er explained.
Then she quickly asked, “Is my big brother okay?”</p>
<p>Although Gu Wan’er’s explanation had been brief, Han Sen
understood. She had been taken by God and brought her there. God
had then given her this sharp knife and put her in charge of
feeding it.</p>
<p>God’s Knife ate by feasting on the blood of creatures. This
place was called God’s Farm, but it was one of many. Many similar
planets were in this system, and Gu Wan’er had to follow a precise
schedule. She took the blade to each planet at the right time,
allowing God’s Knife to feed on a variety of different types of
blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen could immediately see that there were gaps in what Gu
Wan’er was telling him. She was hiding something.</p>
<p>“Aside from the blood of those xenogeneics, it also requires
your blood, right?” Han Sen asked, looking directly at Gu
Wan’er.</p>
<p>Gu Wan’er hesitated and forced a smile. “Yes. I have to feed it
some of my blood every day. But do not worry. I have an immortal
body. When I sleep, my body recovers. That is fine with me. But
about my brother, is he doing fine? If you leave this place, can
you not tell him you saw me?”</p>
<p>“No.” Han Sen looked terrible.</p>
<p>Although Gu Wan’er spoke with little concern for herself, Han
Sen knew that God had done something very cruel. God had brought Gu
Wan’er here and given her an immortal body so she could use her
blood to feed the knife. There was nothing godly about this knife.
It was more like a depraved vampire.</p>
<p>Gu Wan’er had been made a slave who was forced to sacrifice her
own blood. Every day, she needed to offer the demon her blood
without rest. She couldn’t even die.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by no? What happened to my brother? God
promised me that if I helped him raise the knife, he would let my
brother go on to live a good life…” Gu Wan’er paled, and she spoke
more rapidly.</p>
<p>Her body was so small, and it was obvious that she didn’t have
much blood to give. She had been bleeding for too long, and her
body couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t there, the world means nothing to him.” Han Sen
walked in front of Gu Wan’er, and he reached his hand out to the
sharp knife. “Give me the knife.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no. You should leave now. It will kill you…” Gu Wan’er
stepped back.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that Gu Wan’er wasn’t lying. When he first sensed
the knife, he knew it was a ruthless weapon. That was why Han Sen
had originally intended to leave. He didn’t want to put himself at
risk.</p>
<p>But now that he knew that Lone Bamboo’s sister was right here,
and she was being tortured, he couldn’t just turn his back on her
and leave her to her fate. He had to try and help, no matter the
cost. He was hoping to take Gu Wan’er away.</p>
<p>“It can’t kill me.” Moving fast, Han Sen slapped Gu Wan’er’s
hands away from the knife. He stole the blood-sucking knife and
clutched it in his hands.</p>
<p>Gu Wan’er’s eyes widened when she saw that she was no longer
holding the knife. She said, “Give it back to me quickly! This is
God’s Knife. It is so scary, and it will kill you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored Gu Wan’er. He continued holding the knife by its
handle, and he observed the blade carefully. Without Gu Wan’er’s
blood, the crimson color of the metal was starting to fade. The
demon-like shadow rose again. It was like a beast that would
merrily feast on anyone it could. It turned to look at Han Sen. The
blade began to tremble in his hands.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the sharp knife realized that Han Sen was holding it, a
flash of bloody light shone around it. Han Sen’s power was
insufficient to maintain a grip on the knife, and it flew out of
his hands.</p>
<p>The demon shadow of the knife formed a body out of bloody
flames. Its shape was roughly humanoid, but it seemed to be
wreathed in fire. It rattled and shook as it held the sharp knife.
The red, ghostly eyes peered at Han Sen as if it wanted nothing
more than to dine on his blood.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>The bloody shadow moved. The sharp knife tore through space,
carrying a bloody presence with it as it tried to attack Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill him!” Gu Wan’er shouted. She stepped in front of Han
Sen, spreading her arms.</p>
<p>Before the sharp knife got close enough to touch her, Han Sen
grabbed the little girl and spun her around him. He threw a punch
toward the sharp knife and said, “Remember; no matter when or
where, girls should stay behind men and be protected. Don’t try to
get in the way of the man. You’ll just get him hurt.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>While he was talking, the fist and the sharp knife struck each
other. The bloody flame danced madly as the punching power was
shattered. The resulting shockwave tore into the field around them,
forming a giant crater.</p>
<p>The nearby sheep were affected, too. The explosion washed over
them, reducing them to a bloody mist.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t fall back, but he felt something tear in his
chest. He felt the urge to cough up a little blood, but he
swallowed it back down.</p>
<p>The knife roared, sounding like some terrible beast issuing a
challenge. The next second, all four of Han Sen’s geno arts
activated within his body. He combined with Spell, and he entered
his xenogeneic battle body mode.</p>
