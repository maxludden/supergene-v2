<h2>Dongxuan Area</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2393</h3>

<p>“Dollar! I will defeat you today.” After that declaration, a
punch came right for Han Sen. Cloaked in Dragon Eight’s gold King
area, the enormous power of that punch became a roaring gold
dragon, ready to consume Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Let me try my Dongxuan Area power,” Han Sen thought, his heart
leaping. He opened his invisible Dongxuan Area, and all of a
sudden, the whole world around Han Sen was now composed of an
infinite number of spinning cogwheels.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see his opponent’s draconic punch and area power.
They came from Dragon Eight’s self-universe cogwheel, which exerted
force on some universal cogwheels around it to generate more
power.</p>
<p>Within the radius of the Dongxuan Area, Han Sen could feel
Dragon Eight’s ability to affect the universal cogwheels. The
Dongxuan Area could affect them, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted his hand and focused his mind.</p>
<p>When Han Sen pushed forward, it wasn’t to affect Dragon Eight;
instead, he used his Dongxuan Area to control the nearby cogwheels
that were in motion.</p>
<p>The universal cogwheels that had been under Dragon Eight’s
control suddenly came to a complete stop.</p>
<p>In that instant, something unbelievable happened. Dragon Eight’s
gold King area and dragon punch lost their power.</p>
<p>It was an oddly embarrassing moment for Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>It was like an actor filming a special-effects based fight
scene. The fight looked amazing with the special effects, but
halfway through the video, the special effects had vanished. Dragon
Eight was left hanging awkwardly in the air. A cruel punch had been
sent toward Han Sen, but when the power in the attack vanished,
Dragon Eight’s actual fist was still one hundred meters away from
Han Sen, and so nothing happened.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight couldn’t believe his eyes, and so he threw another
punch. No power was produced.</p>
<p>“No… This is impossible… Why can’t I use my area and my power?”
Dragon Eight stared at Han Sen, stupefied.</p>
<p>Dragon One and the other Dragon Kings were similarly
dumbfounded. They couldn’t see the invisible Dongxuan Area. They
had simply seen Han Sen wave his hand, and then Dragon Eight’s area
and power vanished. It was very scary.</p>
<p>Han Sen was pleased beyond words. The Dongxuan Area could
control every universal cogwheel in its radius. That meant that
unless the enemy was stronger than Han Sen, Han Sen could easily
control his every cogwheel. Any power that came into contact with
the Dongxuan Area would be dismissed.</p>
<p>Of course, if the enemy was stronger than Han Sen and kept using
their power to push against the cogwheels Han Sen was trying to
gain control of, the Dongxuan Area wouldn’t work as well.</p>
<p>But even if the enemy’s power was stronger than Han Sen’s, the
Dongxuan Area could still be quite effective. It could make the
cogwheels spin slower, at least. It could even make a cogwheel
accelerate, if there was cause for that.</p>
<p>Ordinary area powers could only affect the universal cogwheels
that immediately connected to the self-universe cogwheel, but the
Dongxuan Area could affect all of the cogwheels within its radius.
That was why the Dongxuan Area was so scary.</p>
<p>And it didn’t simply destroy the power that the enemy had
attempted to wield. It had an additional function.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted his fist and threw a punch toward Dragon Eight,
who was still thoroughly dazed from the disappearance of his
attack.</p>
<p>A giant metal dragon launched from Han Sen’s fist and thundered
toward Dragon Eight, mouth open. It was just like the punch Dragon
Eight himself had tried to deliver.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen how the punch affected the universal cogwheels,
so in order to simulate the punch, he just had to replicate the
movement of the cogwheels.</p>
<p>The simulation wasn’t exactly the same, because the energy of
the punch originated from Han Sen’s self-universe cogwheel instead
of Dragon Eight’s. That meant that the core power of the attack was
different.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>“A gold dragon punch… How is that possible…?” Dragon Eight was
frozen, and so he forgot to dodge. The blow sent him flying, blood
spraying from his mouth in a long stream.</p>
<p>For Dragon One and the others, their surprise was turning into
horror. That punch was Dragon Eight’s own skill merged with a
Dragon secret called the Dragon Punch technique. It was a unique
skill, but Han Sen had copied it and turned it back on his opponent
in seconds. That was terrifying.</p>
<p>“No wonder you were called the universe’s number one Marquise.
Even at King class, you are still this strong,” Dragon One said to
Han Sen as he picked up the injured Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>“I am flattered. If there’s nothing else to be done here, I will
take my leave,” Han Sen said and then turned to leave.</p>
<p>Dragon One raised his hand and stopped Han Sen. He said, “We
found some core xenogeneics. Two of them are half-deified. Are you
interested?”</p>
<p>“How would the resources be split?” Han Sen asked Dragon
One.</p>
<p>The universal core area had many core xenogeneics. They were
King class at the very least, but the xenogeneic genes they yielded
were very special. Core genes could provide a powerful boost to
one’s King area. Many Kings sought those core genes in order to
level up their area.</p>
<p>Han Sen was interested. There were nine tiers he needed to
climb, and then he would need to reset after that. Currently, Han
Sen was only on the first tier. Climbing the levels one by one
would be a difficult thing to do. If he could level up using core
xenogeneic genes, it would be much easier.</p>
<p>“It is a very large group of core xenogeneics,” Dragon One said.
“Those two half-deified xenogeneics are very scary. I can deal with
one, but I cannot take down two. If you can keep one busy, I will
give you fifty percent of the reward.”</p>
<p>“Boss… isn’t fifty percent a bit too much?” a King Dragon
quickly said.</p>
<p>Dragon One waved his hand. “It isn’t too much. No one else among
us can kite the other half-deified core xenogeneic. We have no
chance of killing the group without that being done, though. Either
we make this deal, or none of us get anything. He would deserve
fifty percent.”</p>
<p>Dragon One turned back to Han Sen. “What do you think?”</p>
<p>“It sounds good, as long as I’m only kiting that one
half-deified xenogeneic. Let’s go get it done, then,” Han Sen
answered, accepting their terms. This was his first time inside the
universal core area, so he wasn’t really familiar with the place.
Hanging out with the Dragons wasn’t a bad start.</p>
<p>“It’s a deal.” Dragon One quickly agreed and signed a contract
with Han Sen.</p>
<p>Together, they all flew into the sky. As they traveled, Dragon
Eight asked, “Dollar, what tier have you reached?”</p>
<p>Dragon One and the others all perked up their ears to listen.
They had been curious about this since they saw him fight. With Han
Sen’s performance, they were guessing that he had to be at least
fifth-tier. Some suspected he was ninth-tier; otherwise, how could
he have destroyed Dragon Eight as he had?</p>
<p>“Tier One.” Han Sen didn’t feel the need to hide his rank. After
all, they would have to fight together. If he used his King area
for a long time, it might become apparent that he only had a single
tier. Lying about it now would serve no purpose.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Han Sen’s answer, Dragon Eight jerked in the air as
if he had hit a patch of turbulence. His face had gone slack.</p>
<p>“You’re a first-tier King?” Dragon One and the others looked at
Han Sen, trying to keep their expressions neutral. After that, they
didn’t want to talk anymore.</p>
