  Han Sen used his hands to rub it. It was like the black line was under the skin. He was unable to rub it away.

Bald Guy pointed at Bao’er and screamed, “Bao’er’s neck has it too!”

Han Sen frowned. He looked at Bao’er’s snow-white neck and noticed there was a black line.

In fact, it was not just Bao’er who had it. They soon noticed that all four of them had somehow developed a strange black line.

Li Bing Yu looked terrible. “If I am correct, this black line is the legendary break head wire.”

“What is the break head wire?” Han Sen and Bald Guy looked at Li Bing Yu. Li Bing Yu looked at Bald Guy and said, “Bald Guy, you are a student of Mister Wei. You must have heard the legend of Qi Kingdom’s Mister Tian Kuang.” She did not answer the original question.

“I have. Three hundred years ago, the Qin Kingdom’s Big Mister Tian was very famous. He dug up many god pulses that shocked the sky. He was greater than my teacher today. He is like the first mister of all the seven kingdoms.” Bald Guy nodded and said to Li Bing Yu. “There are many legendary stories about Mister Tian. Which one are you referring to?”

“The last one,” Li Bing Yu said.

Bald Guy was surprised. “The last one? Is that the legend about Mister Tian bringing his students to dig a big land pulse and never returning? No one was able to learn about what happened to him. The hundreds of students he took with him vanished too. Is that the story?”

“Yes, that one,” Li Bing Yu said with a nod.

“What is so special about it? Mister Tian had a mysterious god pulse and summoned his students to go dig up the god pulse together. They did not return.” Bald Guy looked at Li Bing Yu with confusion. He was not sure why she had brought it up.

Li Bing Yu had a wry smile. “That is just one version of the legend. I have heard another version. The legends say Mister Tian took a few hundred students to that god pulse, and they dug there day and night. The soil became weird. It was dark red and difficult to dig into. They dug for seven days and seven nights. After all that time, they were only able to dig nine feet deep. At that time, they dug up something that was like a green, stone tile.”

Bald Guy had never heard this version of the story before. Just like Han Sen, he raised his ears to listen to Li Bing Yu speak.

Li Bing Yu went on to say, “Mister Tian and the other students felt weird. When they dug the land pulse, it was on a lifeless planet. Why would there be a stone tile there? So, they kept digging down. They soon found an old, broken building deep in the earth. The walls were all demolished. It was unknown how it had been buried underground. They excavated the entire building to get a better look. They saw a stone sign near the front door. Four words were written on it: Broken Head God Temple.”

After hearing her tale, Bald Guy did not believe her words. “God temples are undying. Even the ultimate elites of the seven kingdoms cannot destroy a god temple. How could one end up broken and buried underground? This must be a prank.”

“That is what Mister Tian said. Everyone thought so too. The temple had no statue. They thought it was a god temple replica built through human hands. Plus, the location of that god pulse was below the Broken Head God Temple, so they had to remove the god temple to keep digging down. The next day, after they had removed the Broken Head God Temple, everyone’s neck had a small, black line.” When Li Bing Yu said that, her voice started to change.

Bald Guy felt a chill run down his spine. He reached his hand up to stroke his neck.

Li Bing Yu went on to say, “That black line did not hurt or itch. There was nothing inherently weird about it. Mister Tian did not know what happened. He thought of many ways to try to remove it, but he could not find any success. Scary things started to happen the next day. While they were asleep, a few of the students had their heads chopped off. The black line defined the precise point they were decapitated. After that, if anyone fell asleep, their heads were mysteriously cut off.”

“Mister Tian made students watch other students sleep. The students did not dare sleep, but humans are humans, and humans have to sleep eventually. No matter how strong they are, it’s a need. In the end, they could not help but fall asleep. The students were said to have seen a very strange scene. When a student fell asleep, the black line fell off. It was like someone had used an ax to cut it. Blood went everywhere, but the students who watched this did not see anything.”

“Mister Tian used every method he could to stop it. He was unable to find out what caused the black line to manifest. In the end, he had to let one of the students who could not stay awake fall asleep. He then scraped away the skin so he’d lose the skin but survive. Who would have been able to know that the black line did not actually exist on their skin? It was deep inside the flesh and bones. To skin the skin was entirely useless. Eventually, the student’s head was chopped off while he slept.”

“If things are like that, anyone who falls asleep will lose their head and die. They were able to avoid sleep for 10 days or half a month. Some even lasted one or two months, but humans cannot avoid sleep forever. Like the others, as soon as they fell asleep, death came. In the end, Mister Tian and his students fell to the same fate. They all died through decapitation. The black lines on their neck were given the title ‘break head wire.””

After hearing all of that, Bald Guy felt a chill. He forced a smile and said, “That is just a legend. If Mister Tian and the others were all killed, then how was their story about the broken head wire preserved? Who lived to tell the tale? Plus, we did not find the Broken Head Temple. The black lines on our necks cannot be the break head wire.” “I hope that is the case, but this is too similar to the legend of the break head wire,” Li Bing Yu seriously said. She was obviously not meaning any of this as a joke. Han Sen frowned and said, “The riders that died before did not have their heads cut off, and their necks did not bear black lines.”

“Yeah, and we didn’t unearth a god temple,” Bald Guy said with a trembling voice. “We did not break a god temple either, so how could we have possibly provoked Break Head God?” His hands kept rubbing the black line on his neck, unable to erase the mark.

Han Sen did not believe in karma regarding things like that. It was obvious that some power was around. It was just very weird the power could make them develop a black line.

Li Bing Yu sighed. “Even if it is not the break head wire, it will still be big trouble for us. If it wasn’t, Bald Guy’s repel evil rhino should have worked.”

“It doesn’t matter,” Bald Guy said while gulping his saliva. “We should think about going back first. I will allow my teacher to examine it. He is old, so perhaps he knows what the black line is.”

While he was talking, Bald Guy suddenly screamed. He held his neck as the black line on his neck started to bleed.

Bald Guy clutched his burning neck, and he screamed with fear, “Holy shit! I thought a beheading only comes while you are asleep!”
