<p>“There are a lot of resources to be earned from Outer Sky
xenogeneics, but they are very dangerous for ordinary students to
obtain. This house will keep any deified xenogeneic from
approaching within one thousand miles. It is hard to say what will
become of you if you leave that radius, however. If you are out by
yourself and encounter danger, I’m afraid I won’t be able to save
you in time. So, if you want to go hunting for some reason, we
should go together,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>“What kind of primitive deified xenogeneics around here can I
hunt?” Han Sen asked. Since he was there, anyway, he wanted to
acquire more deified resources.</p>
<p>“They are everywhere. Our people haven’t raised them on purpose,
but the creatures have multiplied on their own over the years. They
don’t bother the homes of the Very High, but they can travel freely
wherever else they wish to go. So, when you leave the designated
safe zones, you must be wary wherever you tread. There are larvae
and even butterfly xenogeneics to be found. A creature like that
could end your life by exhaling in your direction,” Exquisite
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was stunned. “I thought there were resources I could
take freely. Why are they that dangerous to obtain?”</p>
<p>“If you want resources, you don’t have to go and hunt them
yourself. Our race has stockpiles for your enjoyment,” Exquisite
said. She now spoke in a different tone of voice as she looked at
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What have they got for me?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” Exquisite said simply. She led Han Sen out of the
garden. But this time, Exquisite didn’t use her little ship. She
put her hand on Han Sen’s shoulder, and all of a sudden, a space
teleportation trick teleported them god-knew-how-far.</p>
<p>When they came out on the other side, Exquisite didn’t release
her grip on him. She used her teleportation ability again. She did
this a dozen times before they came to a stop.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw beads of sweat on her forehead, and on top of that,
her face was flushed red. It had cost her a lot of strength to
bring him so far on a whim.</p>
<p>“We are here,” Exquisite said, looking forward.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed her gaze. An odd lake lay before them. The lake
was full of clouds rather than water.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that the surface of the lake might merely have
been obscured by a deep mist, but when he looked down, he realized
he couldn’t peer through the fog. Despite the strength of Han Sen’s
vision, he couldn’t see anything deeper than ten meters. But all
ten of those meters were clouds and nothing more. There was no sign
of water within that hanging mist. And something that shimmered was
moving within the vapor.</p>
<p>“This lake is called Underworld Lake because Outer Sky resides
between the real world and the anti-matter world. It is sometimes
said that this lake is a connecting point between the real world
and the anti-matter world, a way for us to access the anti-matter
world. I don’t know if that is true,” Exquisite explained, as she
pointed towards the strange lake.</p>
<p>“No one has gone diving here before?” Han Sen asked with
curiosity.</p>
<p>He had heard the various theories of anti-matter worlds, but
what he had heard was merely hearsay. He didn’t know if any of the
rumors were true.</p>
<p>“People have gone in before, but the people who go down—no
matter how strong they are—never return. They are never seen
again,” Exquisite said, her voice emotionless.</p>
<p>“Then why are we here? You aren’t going to make me go down
there, are you?” Han Sen looked at Exquisite, slightly alarmed.</p>
<p>Exquisite laughed and said, “No. Of course not. Although the
Underworld Lake can be dangerous, it is perfectly safe as long as
you don’t go inside. You can, however, do things like go fishing.
If you get lucky, you might pull something sweet from there.”</p>
<p>“We can fish in the clouds? What can we fish for? I thought you
said this is connected with the anti-material world. Is the
anti-material world occupied by fish and shrimp, or something?” Han
Sen asked, raising an eyebrow at Exquisite.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Exquisite pulled out a spool of silk-like
wire and pushed it into Han Sen’s hands. “Over the next few days,
you should take a load off and fish here. Once you catch something,
it will be easier for you to understand what is going on.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the spool of silk and noticed that the line
was as thin as a hair. It looked grey. It wasn’t as shiny as actual
silk. In fact, it looked fairly dull.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to examine the thread. This entire situation
was strange. She hadn’t given him a fishing rod, and there wasn’t
even a hook on the line. Not even Jiang Tai Gong would excel with
such primitive tools. Although that guy hadn’t had a hook for his
line, he had a proper rod, at least. Han Sen had been given
nothing. All he had was a wire.</p>
<p>“There is no fish hook, and neither is there any bait. How am I
supposed to fish out anything with this?” Han Sen asked, looking
skeptically at Exquisite. But she must have had her reasons for
giving him such a tool.</p>
<p>“Put some of your blood on it and give it a try,” Exquisite
instructed.</p>
<p>Han Sen put a drop of his blood onto the wire and thought to
himself, “Is this the Very High or an enclave of vampires?
Everything here requires blood!”</p>
<p>Exquisite could sense what Han Sen was thinking, and so she
blinked and said, “Actually, it doesn’t really require blood. It
just needs your genes, in one form or another. Blood is the
easiest, so…”</p>
<p>Han Sen found himself speechless, but he wasn’t in the mood to
argue with her. The line absorbed Han Sen’s blood. And then, it
jerked and flew up out of his hand. The line nestled itself amidst
Han Sen’s hair, then disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He realized that there was now a single
strand of silver in his hair. It was the silk he had just
received.</p>
<p>But now, the piece of silk seemed to be connected to Han Sen’s
mind. The silk obeyed any mental instructions that Han Sen gave it.
It could be as long or as short as he commanded it to. It was as if
it was alive.</p>
<p>“What is this thing?” Han Sen asked, turning to Exquisite once
more.</p>
<p>“It is a xenogeneic treasure called Underworld Silk,” Exquisite
explained. “It is made of cloud silk essence from Underworld Lake.
There are no tiers of this item, and you cannot attack with it. Its
fitness isn’t high, either. Even an ordinary person could rip it
with ease. But it is the only thing that can return from the
Underworld Lake. You can use it to fish in Underworld Lake.”“Then
why am I using my blood for fish bait?” Han Sen wasn’t happy.
Exquisite was explaining things a bit at a time instead of telling
him everything upfront. Han Sen wasn’t a big fan of that.</p>
<p>“You don’t need bait. Your genes are a part of the Underworld
Silk now. Your presence is in it now, and that presence is your
bait.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Exquisite went on to say, “I still have things to
do, and I’m needed elsewhere for a while. Until I come back, I
expect you to be fishing here. Don’t go too far from this place.
There are far too many xenogeneics in this area. They won’t come to
the shores of the Underworld Lake, so remaining here is the safest
place for you.”</p>
<p>“I would like to fish, too,” Bao’er said. She stared directly at
Exquisite as she spoke.</p>
<p>“We only have one of these Underworld Silks to spare. I will
bring you another one next time,” Exquisite said to Bao’er. Before
Han Sen could say anything, she used her space teleportation and
vanished.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. The Underworld Silk lengthened
stretching past his hand and down to his feet. It snaked its way
down into the Underworld Lake.</p>
<p>“Can I really fish something out of there?” Han Sen looked at
the strand of Underworld Silk that had now disappeared quietly into
the Underworld Lake. Han Sen had serious doubts about this.</p>
