    <p>
      From inside the silver fox&#8217;s charred body, a gold light burst forth.
      The strength of the light gradually increased, and the brighter it got,
      the darker its body became.
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon after, the silver fox&#8217;s body was like smoldering charcoal, with
      veins of red running along its black body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, dark clouds reappeared, shadowing the land once more. A black
      bolt of thunder struck the now-black fox.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>The silver fox&#8217;s body cracked.</p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      Another black bolt came from the sky, and this happened a multitude of
      times. After the ninth occurrence, the clouds departed as quickly as they
      had come.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      A white lightning cloud then appeared in the sky, erupting with more bolts
      of thunder. They were all aimed at the silver fox&#8217;s breaking body.
    </p>

    <p>
      After striking the fox nine more times, this cloud also disappeared from
      wherever it came from.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, the same thing happened again and again with six other clouds.
      Strangely, they were all of a different color. There were green, red,
      purple, blue, gold, and silver clouds, all in all. Each cloud hit the
      silver fox with a thunderbolt nine times. And with each strike, the silver
      fox&#8217;s body became stronger.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, on the final strike, the silver fox&#8217;s body was broken into
      pieces. Its flesh had hardened, only to shatter like bits of glass. Only
      its skeleton remained.
    </p>

    <p>The bones were shining with lightning.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Another lightning bolt streaked across the sky. But this was like a
      pillar, heading directly downwards as if to crush the silver fox&#8217;s
      motionless bones.
    </p>

    <p>Howl!</p>

    <p>
      The silver fox finally made a sound, but beneath the light of that holy
      pillar, the flesh of its prior composition began to return.
    </p>

    <p>
      The howl it made was sad enough to break someone&#8217;s heart. When the
      fox first shattered, it did not make a noise, but it did when being
      rebornâ€”the pain must have been far more excruciating.
    </p>

    <p>
      More and more lightning flashed across its rebirthing body, and slowly,
      the silver fox&#8217;s new appearance was revealed. It was like a silver
      lightning fox, and now, it was bearing the crushing weight of the pillar
      of light.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver lightning of the fox was like a fire, and when the silver fox
      howled, the fire pushed up against the pillar.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The area was consumed by a grand discharge of electricity. Han Sen and the
      three-tailed fox had to move a great distance away and watch the
      transformation from afar.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Perhaps it was because there was too much lightning, but half of Thunder
      Mountain collapsed.
    </p>

    <p>
      And amidst the ruin and rubble, the silver fox howled again. The silver
      lightning sundered the light pillar and went even further, lighting up the
      entire sky.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The silver lightning broke the sky, literally cracking it open. Inside the
      cracks, Han Sen saw many strange things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw a palace, and strange flora. He even saw a tree with an angel
      perched on one of its branches.
    </p>

    <p>
      From inside those cracks, a phantom force of pressure burst forth to push
      him down on the ground. His power still wasn&#8217;t at a high enough
      level to resist that pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Howl! The silver fox looked at Han Sen and called out to him. Han Sen
      looked at the silver fox and their eyes locked onto each other. From what
      Han Sen could see in the silver fox&#8217;s eyes, it was conflicted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought the silver fox was going to summon the gate to the Third
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary like the holy rhino or Empty Witch had.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it didn&#8217;t take long for that assumption to change. The silver
      fox hadn&#8217;t summoned a spirit; instead, it had forced open a crack
      between both sanctuaries to force his way beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      Howl! The silver fox looked up to the sky and the cracks began to reduce
      in size. Then, it looked back to Han Sen as if it was going to miss him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Silver, go! I&#8217;ll find you; we&#8217;ll be together
      again real soon.&#8221; Han Sen did his best to stand up, but could not.
      He gathered all the power he could to generate sonic-thunder powers.
    </p>

    <p>But even with that power, however, he could not make a squeak.</p>

    <p>
      The silver fox had evolved, and if it remained in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, its body would be tainted and end up in a far worse state than
      it currently was. It would have to leave this place before the cracks
      closed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen wanted to go with it, it was impossible for him to even
      budge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Howl! The silver fox yelped in the direction of its master once more, and
      as it inched itself towards the cracks, it made sure to keep looking back
      at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will look for you soon, Little Silver. Wait for me!&#8221; Han
      Sen witnessed the cracks beginning to seal, and so he spoke aloud one last
      time to the silver fox that looked back at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox nodded, and then it turned back to face the portal. Its
      body morphed into silver lightning and was drawn inside.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The crack closed shut, and the pressure that had forced Han Sen to the
      ground vanished. Still, he did not immediately get back on his feet. His
      heart had been dealt a blow he had almost never had to deal with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ever since he watched the birth of Little Silver, he had spent most of his
      time alongside it. It was a genuine companion, and now that it was gone,
      it hurt. Han Sen vowed to do whatever it took to find the silver fox
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary was a massive, sprawling place. It was
      largely unexplored, and human development was slow there. Unless he was
      tremendously lucky, Han Sen feared it might take years for the two to
      reunite.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fuck! I know I shouldn&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ll find him no matter
      where he ends up. I&#8217;ll cut down anyone or anything that tries to
      stop me from reuniting with him.&#8221; Han Sen was going to consider this
      an oath; a vow he would swear to uphold. Looking up to the sky, he
      shouted, &#8220;Little Silver, hold on! I&#8217;m going to look after you,
      no matter what it takes!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After cheering himself up, he returned to the nearest human shelter and
      went back to the Alliance. In accordance with the contract, he returned
      half of the Angel Gene Fluid to Angel Gene. He wouldn&#8217;t play nice
      with those people, ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      But before he hit the road again, he spoke to his mother and informed her
      of his plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was going to give her most of his beast souls and the super
      creatures he had claimed. It would have been even better if she could go
      to Moment Shelter, for if she did, he could move on to the Third
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary without worry.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you visit the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary, do not let the
      spirits know that you have an association with the Luo family,&#8221; Luo
      Lan said calmly after hearing his plans.
