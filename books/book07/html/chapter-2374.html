<p>“Elder… why?” Lan Haixin looked at the old Siren woman with
utter disbelief. Her voice trembled.</p>
<p>“Why?” The old Siren woman’s face was twisted. She gritted her
teeth and said, “I want to know why, too. I want to know why I am
so talented, and yet, not a single Siren was able to appreciate my
accomplishments. Is it because I don’t have the blood of the holy
virgin? Is that why that b*tch became the holy virgin instead? If a
traitor like that was able to become the holy virgin, why couldn’t
I?”</p>
<p>“I waited many years for that b*tch to die, but they let you—a
girl who didn’t even have pure blood—become the holy virgin
instead. I want to know why they never considered giving me the
chance. I’m so smart. No one amongst the Siren could do the things
that I’ve done. But just because I don’t have a drop of the holy
virgin’s blood, I have to be considered a mere commoner? In this
world, there’s no point in asking ‘why.’ Things only belong to you
if you fight for them.” The old Siren woman gave a twisted
laugh.</p>
<p>“Now, I finally have this chance. If the Sirens aren’t willing
to accept me, then I will destroy this entire race. I will offer my
blood to the Siren Bottle and conjure a new race, one which will
worship me as their alpha.”</p>
<p>“Because of that, you are willing to kill off the last of our
kind?” Lan Haixin looked very sad.</p>
<p>“They are nothing. As long as I have the Siren Bottle, I can be
deified. I can create a race of my own.” The old Siren woman
sounded a little crazy.</p>
<p>“You don’t have the holy virgin blood. You cannot control the
Siren Bottle. All you have done is for nothing.” Lan Haixin looked
unspeakably sad.</p>
<p>The old Siren woman laughed. “You will just have to thank that
b*tch, then. She wanted her hybrid son to claim the holy bottle.
She built this Crystal Palace and the blood altar here and made a
deal with you. She did all of this for his benefit. She only used
you for your blood. With this altar, the Siren blood, and the
refinement of the holy bottle, I can control it. Even without the
holy virgin’s blood.”</p>
<p>“I suffered much humiliation when I was young, but I sided with
that b<em>tch. I did everything I could to earn her trust. I almost
died multiple times during my service to her. Even my son died for
her. I sacrificed so much to gain her faith. Now, I’m the only one
who can wield this technique. That b</em>tch would’ve never
imagined I was scheming to betray her. She never knew I was the one
that killed her. She couldn’t even tell her secret to her hybrid
son. Now, everything belongs to me. I will be the next race’s
alpha.” After saying this, the old Siren woman laughed like mad.
She seemed utterly self-assured.</p>
<p>“You seem to have forgotten I’m still here.” Han Sen looked at
that old Siren woman with pride.</p>
<p>The old Siren woman’s smile vanished as she looked at Han Sen.
“You aren’t bad. You must be as devious as that b*tch to have
hidden things for so long. Your own plan was decent, but you are
still too young, and you ended up killing all the Siren. What a
shame. Now, the blood altar’s process has begun, and the holy
bottle is in the midst of being refined. Although it cannot be
fully used yet, I only need to borrow a little of its power to kill
both you and the blood kirin.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that you are completely without holy virgin
blood. How can you use the holly bottle’s power without it?” Han
Sen asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen had guessed the old Siren woman’s plan a while ago, but
he hadn’t killed her yet because he wanted the Siren Bottle, as
well.</p>
<p>He had the same problem as the old Siren woman. He had the
Original Water King Body, but he didn’t have the holy virgin blood.
The holy bottle wouldn’t accept him as its master.</p>
<p>And this wasn’t just because Han Sen had replaced Bai Yi,
either. Even Bai Yi’s mother didn’t believe the young prince would
be able to make use of the bottle. So, she set up the blood altar.
She needed a blood sacrifice so that Bai Yi could control the Siren
Bottle, but that should still be impossible for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to know the old Siren woman’s plan. She must have
some method for controlling the Siren Bottle. So, he didn’t yet
strike her down.</p>
<p>“It is okay. Soon, you will believe. I’m going to use both of
you hybrids as a sacrifice. Then, I will be able to control the
Siren Bottle and create a race of my own. I will be the alpha and
leader of it!” the old Siren woman said. She walked towards the
altar and picked up the Siren Bottle. Obsession was etched deep
into the lines of her face.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin used her area power in a bid to stop the old woman,
but as soon as Lan Haixin moved onto the altar, the altar’s rainbow
light bounced her back. She was unable to access that zone.</p>
<p>The old Siren woman lifted the bottle and laughed. “That cheap
b*tch wasn’t at my level, but she was still better than the two of
you. You two hybrids will die today.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the old Siren woman with interest and said,
“You’re going to kill me? Aren’t you afraid that the Extreme King
will hunt you down?”</p>
<p>The old Siren woman grinned and looked at him with disdain. “I
watched Bai Yi grow up. Aside from that b*tch, no one else
understood him more than I. You are not Bai Yi. I don’t know how
you did what you did… Perhaps it was a similar skill to Consume?
But regardless, your ability to open the Crystal Palace door proves
that you refined the hybrid Bai Yi’s blood. I get your blood and
give you to King Bai. He will appreciate that, I think. I can get
the Siren Bottle and receive King Bai’s reward. I must say, God
seems to be on my side… Haha!”</p>
<p>Lan Haixin looked at Han Sen with proper shock. She had never
realized the Bai Yi in front of her was a fake.</p>
<p>But she never thought someone would be brave enough to disguise
themselves as a prince of the Extreme King, either.</p>
<p>Instead of denying the accusation, Han Sen admitted it. He stood
silently and watched the old Siren woman. Her hands were glowing.
Power was coming out of her hands and flowing into the Siren
Bottle.</p>
<p>The Siren Bottle’s wings were like the faces of Siren women.
They looked alive. Their eyes shone with light, and blue waves
rippled across them. They made sad sniffling noises like an
instrument was playing.</p>
<p>Not long after, a waterdrop arose inside the bottle.</p>
<p>The old Siren woman happily grabbed the drop and put it into her
mouth. Her body began to glow and change.</p>
<p>Rainbow-color light rinsed over her, and the old Siren woman’s
tree bark-like face changed. Her age and wrinkles disappeared, and
she became an eighteen-year-old girl with skin that was smooth and
white.</p>
<p>Her fish scales looked transparent and crystal, and they glowed
with rainbow light. Her entire body had been completely renewed,
and her presence changed along with it.</p>
