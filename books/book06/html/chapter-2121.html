<h2>The Name of Dollar</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2121</h3>

<p>Dragon Eight tried to force himself to get up, but the figure on
the coin was displaying a mighty number eight. His hands trembled
in exertion as he attempted to rise, but nothing came of it. He
couldn’t get up.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight’s dragon fire was burning like a bonfire, but try
as he might to rise, he just couldn’t get back on his feet.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>The number on the coin was now an almighty nine. Dragon Eight
couldn’t hold the force back anymore. His hands were pressed into
stones that buckled under the weight and crumbled, leaving him to
slowly sink into the earth.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight roared and cut off half of his own head again.</p>
<p>His body was free for a sparse few moments, but the coin
appeared back on his forehead in precisely the same spot in less
than a second.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>There was a loud noise, and Dragon Eight’s body slammed back
into the ground.</p>
<p>All of the people and creatures watching this horrid spectacle
were frozen. The elites of the Dragon were dismayed at Dollar’s
chilling performance.</p>
<p>When the coin’s number ticked over to ten, Dragon Eight could no
longer resist. He collapsed and let his body sink into the earth
without restraint. Gritting his teeth, Dragon Eight tore up the
sheet of paper. With a body contorted under the tremendous
pressure, he left the Geno Being Scroll in defeat.</p>
<p>The fight came to an end, but when all was done, no one was sure
how to describe what they had just witnessed.</p>
<p>No one had ever heard of a “human,” and what was that geno art?
An unknown name had suddenly shot to stardom faster than the speed
of light.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen did not tell anyone the geno art’s name, it was
commonly referred to as Dollar.</p>
<p>“Dollar is awesome! It was even able to pin down Dragon
Eight!”</p>
<p>“Dollar is incredible! His body is as strong as a Dragon’s. It’s
rare to see a performance like that even amongst the higher
races.”</p>
<p>“Human? What is this race? I’ve tried to do some research, but I
haven’t found anything about their origin.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t find anything about them, either. Did he make them
up?”</p>
<p>“He might have, but that does not discredit how strong Dollar
himself really is.”</p>
<p>If he keeps winning like this, he is sure to go up against Lone
Bamboo of the Sky. Now that will be a show to watch!’</p>
<p>Everyone in the universe was raving about the human Dollar and
his Dollar. But two women in particular were gritting their
teeth.</p>
<p>“Dollar! You are finally here.” Yisha’s face turned dark. She
had sought Dollar for the longest time, but since their last
encounter, she had found no trace of him. Dollar was now
participating in the Geno Being Scroll, but where he was joining
from, she hadn’t a clue.</p>
<p>In that universe, the Geno Being Scroll could be entered from
anywhere.</p>
<p>The other person who hated Dollar was called Hai’er. She wanted
her revenge on him. She had used the resources of the Pirates to
learn of his whereabouts, but she had come up empty.</p>
<p>These two women ground their teeth. It was torture to watch
Dollar merrily waltz his way through every opponent he encountered
in the Geno Being Scroll. And on top of that, there was nothing
they could do about it.</p>
<p>Yisha’s next opponent was sure to be in bad luck. She was on a
King class battlefield, whereas Dollar was on a Marquise
battlefield. They couldn’t fight no matter how much she wanted to,
but all that pent-up rage had to go somewhere. And that meant her
next combatant would be the unfortunate recipient.</p>
<p>The poor King that went up against Yisha was swiftly wrecked. He
couldn’t fight back in the least. If he hadn’t ripped up the paper
quickly, it’d have been a fairly brutal murder.</p>
<p>“F*ck you! It’s just a ranked match. You don’t need to hit that
hard!” The King cradled his battered body and started to fancy some
revenge himself.</p>
<p>Dollar became incredibly famous. The title of Human Dollar was
one of much renown now, and it wasn’t just the Marquises that were
interested in him. Because of how mysterious Dollar was, people
became all the more fascinated with his geno art.</p>
<p>The contestants who knew they would have to face Dollar
researched his geno art even more frantically than the rest.</p>
<p>If they couldn’t find a way to counter Dollar, they knew that
they’d lose in a most spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>Every race sent a researcher to watch Dollar’s fights. They
desperately wanted to discover a way in which they might deal with
a hostile Dollar. Every time a new geno art was discovered, such
things would take place. The pursuit of knowledge was always
ongoing.</p>
<p>But the geno arts usually researched were King class or deified
geno arts. Lower tier geno arts rarely drew much attention. Dollar
was cast by a Marquise, so it was strange for so many people to
invest time in researching it.</p>
<p>The reason why every race focused on Dollar was because Dollar
was able to suppress even the Dragon’s Evilbreaker powers. It also
seemed as if it could keep growing in strength. Those two points
were enough to draw the attention of every race.</p>
<p>And this was only a Marquise’s use of it. They worried about
what could be achieved if a King or deified person used it. Just
thinking about that was enough to give such dreamers a chill.</p>
<p>If they could not find a way to overcome Dollar, the Kings would
never feel safe.</p>
<p>But after the fight with Dragon Eight, no other opponent had
been able to get Han Sen to cast Dollar.</p>
<p>Han Sen beat them all with simple strength. It was something
that came as a grand disappointment to those who wished to research
Dollar in finer detail.</p>
<p>Littleflower came against his next opponent, and it was a white
tiger. Littleflower swung his fist, and when the little fist was
going to come into contact with the white tiger’s face, he
disappeared and appeared behind the tiger. The fist was driven in
the direction of the tiger’s bum.</p>
<p>Seeing the fist on its way to smack its butt, the tiger’s body
blurred. Littleflower punched through the tiger, revealing it to be
little more than a shadow.</p>
<p>Behind Littleflower, the tiger bared its teeth in a savage grin.
Its claws were like lightning, soaring to strike Littleflower’s
skin. But in the next second, the white tiger’s smile froze. When
it touched Littleflower, the boy’s body was revealed to be a
shadow, too.</p>
<p>Another Littleflower appeared to the left of the tiger. He
kicked the creature in the belly.</p>
<p>The white tiger disappeared the moment Littleflower’s foot came
into contact with its belly. The two of them then flashed and
flashed between each other around the mountain. They disappeared
and reappeared continuously, making spectators dizzy.</p>
<p>“He really is from Sacred! He can fight the white tiger’s
teleportation.” The dog-faced elder standing in the desert
frowned.</p>
