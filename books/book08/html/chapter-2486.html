<p>Kiek’s magnetic area wasn’t the strongest King area in the
Extreme King, but he was still a member of the third-highest race
in the universe. His Magnet King Body was nothing to take lightly,
especially since he was half-deified. Normal King class xenogeneics
were unable to walk under the influence of his magnetic area.</p>
<p>Bao’er was just a kid, and she was somehow ignoring Kiek’s
magnetic area. That surprised him a lot.</p>
<p>He hesitated, then raised a palm. A black magnetic light
appeared in his hand. He wanted to attack Bao’er who was still
driving the white whale.</p>
<p>“Mister… please… I beg you… don’t hurt her.”</p>
<p>As Kiek was about to launch the magnetic light at Bao’er, a
woman suddenly stood up. Straining against the might of the
magnetic area, she stood before Bao’er and spoke with a trembling
voice.</p>
<p>“You can move inside my magnetic area? You aren’t bad.” Kiek
stared at her. He decided that he would need to get rid of her
first. But the woman suddenly kneeled on the floor and bowed before
him.</p>
<p>“Please don’t kill me!” she pleaded from her knees. “Please, let
us go! We are just useless women. We can’t stop whatever it is you
want to do. Please let us go as easily as you would release a
fart.”</p>
<p>Ning Yue kept begging, all the while repeatedly banging her head
on the ground.</p>
<p>“Leave if you don’t want to die,” Kiek told her in a hard voice.
He was quite famous in the Extreme King, and he wouldn’t bother
killing a woman if she was behaving like this.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, yes. We will leave now!” Ning Yue got up and started
to pull Bao’er away with her.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The magnetic light hit Ning Yue in the face. Ning Yue was sent
flying.</p>
<p>The powerful magnetic force drug Ning Yue across the ship and
flung her into one of the ship’s walls. Her face smacked into the
wall and stuck to it. She couldn’t pull herself away.</p>
<p>“You can leave by yourself. She stays.” Kiek cast another
magnetic light toward Bao’er.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Somehow, Ning Yue had reappeared in front of Bao’er. She crossed
her arms to block the magnet this time, and the sudden weight made
her arms feel so heavy. They were sucked straight down to the
floor. Her face smacked into the floor, and her mouth twisted.</p>
<p>“Mister, please let her go! She’s just a kid, and I promised Han
Sen I would protect his child.” Ning Yue was lying on the floor in
an awkward position. She cried freely, snot and tears running down
her face.</p>
<p>“It looks as if you really do want to die,” Kiek grunted,
generating a magnetic light in his fist.</p>
<p>Ning Yue’s pants suddenly became hot, and a puddle appeared on
the floor. She had peed herself.</p>
<p>When Kiek smelled the urine, he frowned. He might get his hands
dirty if he killed a woman like this. Ignoring Ning Yue, he turned
his attention back to Bao’er again. The magnetic light in his hands
was so bright that it was like a black sun.</p>
<p>Bao’er was still operating the white whale, guiding it to fight
the Extreme King knights outside. She acted as if she had yet to
see Kiek there.</p>
<p>Kiek’s lips pressed into a thin line, and he prepared to throw
the magnetic light at Bao’er. Ning Yue was pressed against the
floor with her limbs shaking, but she still managed to crawl toward
Kiek. When she was near his feet, she begged, “Mister, please let
us go. We won’t get in the way of whatever you want to do! And I
can do anything for you…”</p>
<p>“Get lost, you dirty b*tch!” Kiek kicked Ning Yue in the face,
the force of the blow sending her flying.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Ning Yue hit the airship’s wall, her face covered in blood. Her
entire body was stuck to the wall, keeping her from falling.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to die, then shut the hell up! If you don’t,
I’ll kill you. You’re disturbing my work,” Kiek snarled. He stared
at Bao’er again and tried to launch another magnetic light.</p>
<p>“I want you to stop!” Ning Yue’s voice was shaking as if she was
on the verge of bursting into tears.</p>
<p>Kiek glanced at her struggling form, but she couldn’t free
herself from the wall. The magnetic force had her pinned to the
wall like a slab of meat.</p>
<p>Ignoring Ning Yue, he sent the magnetic light in his hands
toward Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Stop! I told you to stop!” Ning Yue screamed with fear. Her
body managed to tear through the magnetic power, and she leaped in
front of Bao’er to take the black sun-like light.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The scary magnetic light landed on Ning Yue, and in the next
instant, her body crashed to the floor like a crumbling mountain.
Her limbs were held down by an iron grip, all crushed and
broken-looking.</p>
<p>Kiek ignored her. He continued summoning his magnetic power.</p>
<p>“Stop, I’m begging you! Don’t hurt her… I promised Han Sen I
would take care of his daughter! I made him a promise…” Ning Yue
wept helplessly from her place on the floor.</p>
<p>Seeing that Kiek was going to cast that magnetic light at
Bao’er, Ning Yue struggled with the urge to get up. But she had
been hit by the magnetic forces three times. The force was now too
strong for her to overcome.</p>
<p>Kiek cast another sun-like magnetic light at Bao’er.</p>
<p>“I told you to stop!” Ning Yue shrieked, looking at the magnetic
light that was flying toward Bao’er. Her shaking body erupted with
green flames that wrapped her up in a shroud of fire.</p>
<p>In those green flames, Ning Yue’s eyes suddenly calmed. His face
and body regained their masculine shape. He looked like a man
again.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu and the pirates on the floor stared at Ning Yue
with wide eyes. They thought Ning Yue was a chickenhearted and
useless woman. But suddenly, she had just become a man. And the
green fire around him burned and wisped in an unsettling way.</p>
<p>“I told you to stop! Are you deaf?” Ning Yue thundered, his eyes
crystal clear. His face still had the dried tracks of tears and
snot. His female garments had started to burst at the seams as he
became bigger, but he still looked gentle and soft.</p>
<p>“You dare to play tricks on someone like me? You’re dead!”
Kiek’s hand gathered up a black light. It became a black magnetic
knife that came for Ning Yue.</p>
<p>Ning Yue looked calm and composed, and his hands held a green
sword. When Kiek swung his black magnetic knife there, Ning Yue’s
body was attracted to it. He flew for the magnetic knife.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The moment Ning Yue was sucked into the black magnetic knife, he
waved his little green sword. A green sword light shot by, sending
Kiek’s head and half of his magnetic knife soaring through the
air.</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>Kiek’s headless body crumpled to the ground. Fang Qing Yu and
the others were frozen.</p>
<p>“Ah!” On the other side, the green flames on Ning Yue’s body had
vanished. His little green sword was on the floor, and his body
returned to a feminine shape again. When she saw that headless
body, Ning Yue held her face and started to scream. She looked so
scared, and she frantically stepped away from the corpse.</p>
