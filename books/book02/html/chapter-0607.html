    <p>
      There was a giant creature swimming across the sea, which almost resembled
      a moving island.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing it, Han Sen and Queen did not even dare to breathe, and they
      steered the whale in another direction to avoid it. With the silver fox
      onboard, the only creatures they were likely to meet would be insanely
      powerful ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two had been lost at sea for half a month, and this was the second
      time they had seen a creature like this. Fortunately, the creatures never
      paid them heed and would instead continue in the direction they were
      headed.
    </p>

    <p>
      They waited until the giant creature was out of sight and let out long
      sighs. After another half day, Han Sen suddenly saw something green on the
      horizon. It could have been an island, he thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We are saved! There is an island in the distance. Even if there is
      no one there, we could at least find some real food. All this time adrift,
      all we have been drinking is fish blood. I&#8217;m getting sick of
      it!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen looked happy at this news, too. The entire time they had been on the
      back of the whale, they had been eating fish meat and drinking fish blood,
      and she too was starting to hate it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the image of green drew nearer and nearer, it revealed itself to indeed
      be an island of sorts. The hills were quite steep, but they were short,
      and it was decorated with much foliage.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were no tall trees on the island, but there were many berry bushes.
      The berries they contained looked like delicious little grapes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen summoned her wings and flew over to take a look. The island
      wasn&#8217;t too big, and it didn&#8217;t seem to be populated with any
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both feeling confident about their new-found parcel of land, they
      disembarked and climbed onto the island. Han Sen looked at the red berries
      and thought to himself, &#8220;These berries can&#8217;t be like those red
      mushrooms, can they?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen had already ventured inland. After a brief search, she found a pond
      hidden among the hills. The prospect of fresh water excited her very much.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you looking at?&#8221; Queen noticed Han Sen squatting
      near the bushes. She furrowed her eyebrows.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am wondering whether or not I can eat these things. I am getting
      tired of eating fish meat, and I am keen to eat something fresh like
      this,&#8221; Han Sen answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t randomly eat stuff. Let&#8217;s stick to the
      fish,&#8221; Queen told him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although she was sick of fish meat, as well, not all plants in the world
      were safe for human consumption. The berries did look delicious, but who
      knew whether or not they&#8217;d cause problems if eaten?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I think they&#8217;re okay. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;d be okay for us
      to eat them.&#8221; Han Sen continued to observe the berries, and from the
      knowledge he had received from Professor Sun, he was sure they would be
      fine to eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen ignored Han Sen and simply returned to the sea to catch more fish.
      She was happy enough to be able to cook the fish meat, and doing that was
      certainly better than risking the consumption of curious, unknown berries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen was sure they would be okay to eat, he didn&#8217;t take
      any.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had a question burning in his mind. Why did the berries, while
      edible, grow in such abundance on the island? And why were they wholly
      untouched?
    </p>

    <p>
      While they were out at sea, they saw many birds flying overhead. And yet,
      there was nothing in the remote vicinity of this island. This made Han Sen
      believe something was wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen fought back the desire to try out the berries, and decided to take
      a stroll around the island, find out what he could, and see if he could
      witness anything strange about the place they had ended up on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The island wasn&#8217;t too large, and a regular human could walk around
      it in half a day. With Han Sen atop Golden Growler, combined with his
      abilities, it didn&#8217;t take him long to scope out the place.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the island wasn&#8217;t too big, the hills inland were strange. The
      rocky hills were not too high, standing at about twenty meters tall, and
      from afar, one could mistake them for overgrown pineapples. The weirdest
      thing was how identical each hill was to the next.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen climbed a hill and looked around. On the tallest hill, he caught
      sight of a lotus-looking plant.
    </p>

    <p>
      It looked like an ordinary lotus, with seven leaves and a bud at the
      center. It was also pure white.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen frowned. Lotuses tended to grow in water, or at least in very
      moist soil. He had never seen one grow on a hill before, which made him
      question whether it was really a lotus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing as it was just a plant, Han Sen didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d have
      anything to be afraid of. Carrying the silver fox, he decided to ascend
      the hill. Upon reaching the top, he took a proper gander at the
      seven-leaved flower.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking a closer look, Han Sen confirmed that it was indeed a lotus. Its
      snow-white petals were all folded around the fist-sized lotus cup inside.
      This was different than the usual green ones, as this cup was snow white
      on the inside, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was semi-transparent, and there were many red seeds on the inside.
      However, it wasn&#8217;t very big, which indicated it wasn&#8217;t fully
      mature yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen continued to observe it, the silver fox jumped out of his arms.
      It used its own nose to sniff the lotus and blinked as a human would.
      Then, it curiously circled the lotus as if inspecting the flower. After a
      while, the silver fox decided to lie down next to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Silver fox, do you care to tell me what that means?&#8221; Han Sen
      asked, while looking at the silver fox with a puzzled expression. If the
      silver fox wanted to eat something, he&#8217;d usually gobble it down
      without a second thought. He had never waited for his food before.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox&#8217;s face suggested that it did want to eat the plant,
      but the fox continued to just lie down next to it. Han Sen wasn&#8217;t
      sure what it was thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you want to wait until it is ripe?&#8221; Han Sen thought of
      this possibility and asked the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the silver fox could not reply. All it did was squint with its eyes
      and continue lying there. It was almost as if it were guarding the lotus
      plant, like a watchdog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw smoke rising near the oceanside, which told him Queen had
      already gathered some fish and was most likely cooking it. When he reached
      down to grab the silver fox, it bolted out of the way as if it
      didn&#8217;t want to leave. It then sat down, unmoving.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Even if you want to wait until it is ripe, it could take a while.
      No one is fighting for it, so let&#8217;s go eat some food and come
      back.&#8221; Han Sen comforted the silver fox and tried to grab him again.
    </p>

    <p>
      But again, the silver fox refused to budge. He had no intention of leaving
      the lotus and seemed resolute in his decision to guard the plant.
    </p>

    <p>
      With nothing he could do about it, Han Sen decided to walk back to the
      oceanside. As he made his way back, he thought to himself, &#8220;That
      lotus must be some good stuff. Otherwise, why would he be so stubborn and
      stay there? He is rather picky when it comes to food.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t let the silver fox take it all for himself! I bet
      he is waiting for the lotus seeds. Otherwise, he&#8217;d have munched it
      all at first sight. What other reason could there be for him to stay there
      and wait? Hmm, but how can I take them away from the silver fox? If the
      silver fox decides to fight me, how can I expect to look after it in the
      future?&#8221; Many different thoughts and questions now plagued Han
      Sen&#8217;s mind, and he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was refusing to leave that spot, and it was going to wait
      until the seeds were ripe. Stealing food from it would be a difficult
      thing.
