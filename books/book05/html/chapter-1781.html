<p>Stay Up Late shook his head and bowed before the beast,
apologizing. “I appreciate the offer, but no thank you.”</p>
<p>The beast, hearing Stay Up Late reject the offer, stopped
talking. He moved his body and flew up into space. He disappeared
into the cosmos.</p>
<p>Stay Up Late and Han Sen continued their travel, meeting many
more powerful creatures as they went. They all wanted to buy the
feathers or at least have the pair join their tribes. Each and
every single offer was rejected by the duo, however.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed. All the elites sought to buy the white
feather he possessed, but none invited him into their tribe. It
seemed all such offers were exclusively reserved for Stay Up
Late.</p>
<p>As they walked, they met five different race elites. After that,
no more interrupted their journey.</p>
<p>It was not as if no one else was interested in the white
feathers; it was just that those five represented the biggest
factions and had drummed up the biggest offerings. There was no
point in any other races making an offer, as whatever they could
muster would not be enough to rival the big five.</p>
<p>The rain still hadn’t stopped. After walking half a day, they
found an abandoned house they could seek refuge and shelter in.</p>
<p>But as soon as they entered, Han Sen’s eyes opened wide. A beast
that was red, that looked like both a fox and a cat, was lying
across a crummy table. It was staring right at the two as they
entered.</p>
<p>“Great! It’s you, Old Cat, you *sshole. How dare you show
yourself to me again! I’m going to skin you alive.” Han Sen was
immediately enraged, and he threw a punch towards Old Cat’s face.
As the fist traveled, he yelled, “Where’s Littleflower!”</p>
<p>Old Cat teleported to the rafters in the ceiling, smiled, and
said, “Littleflower is being looked after very well. Do not
worry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry my *ss! Bring me Littleflower.” Han Sen jumped up
and tried chasing after Old Cat.</p>
<p>Old Cat was too quick, though, and he disappeared once again.
When he appeared, he leaped atop the table again. Slowly, he went
on to say, “I took him away for his own benefit. It’s good for him.
You can’t even look after yourself, so how do you think you could
take care of Littleflower? How can you expect him to grow
naturally?”</p>
<p>“That is my family’s business! Not yours!” Han Sen kept on
chasing after Old Cat as he spoke.</p>
<p>Old Cat’s body kept flashing, as Han Sen’s fist kept failing to
touch him.</p>
<p>“Haha! I felt sorry to see someone so special and great have
their potential buried. Now, he is living well. Perhaps it’ll only
take another eight years before he becomes a king. There’s every
chance he could become a god. He could become a deity like Kong Fei
did. You are a father; you should support what’s best for him! You
shouldn’t limit his potential and hold him back.” Old Cat was
obviously trying to convince Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I will take care of my own son. You better give him back, or
I’ll skin you alive right here!” Han Sen angrily said.</p>
<p>“Littleflower cannot come back just yet. But I can show you
this.” Old Cat threw an item at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a look, and noticed it was a communicator. There was
a video feed already linked, and on it, he could see
Littleflower.</p>
<p>“Auntie Mei, I really can’t eat anymore. Can you help me eat
this fruit?” Han Sen put off his idea of killing Old Cat and held
the communicator close. He stared at Littleflower intently.</p>
<p>That was mainly because he knew his abilities were actually
worse than Old Cat’s. Killing the cat would be impossible with his
current strength. Thus, the continued chase was pointless.</p>
<p>The video was obviously a series of snippets, with many
sequences that had been trimmed and stuffed together to give Han
Sen a picture of what day-to-day life was like for his son.
Littleflower was definitely eating a lot each day, and a beautiful
woman and three monsters took their time to train with the boy
diligently.</p>
<p>Han Sen could tell they were teaching Littleflower some skills,
and that Littleflower was improving quickly. Each day, his
abilities grew.</p>
<p>“How does that look? If you kept Littleflower close to you, he
wouldn’t benefit from any of this. He wouldn’t get the training and
strength he needs. You should be thanking me.” Old Cat spoke with a
cocky tone.</p>
<p>“To hell with thanking you! I am warning you, right now! Give me
Littleflower; otherwise, I’m not done with you.” Han Sen, still
looking at the video, threw a punch towards Old Cat.</p>
<p>Han Sen really hated what Old Cat had done, and he could only
catch a glimpse of his son through the video. He wanted his son
next to him, and nowhere else.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you just be nice?” Old Cat looked depressed.</p>
<p>“Could you stop swinging for a minute! I have come here to
discuss serious business.” Old Cat kept dodging as he said,
“Littleflower wants to learn sword skills. He needs a shortsword,
and that feather can craft one that is perfect for him.”</p>
<p>“F*ck you.” Han Sen didn’t wait until Old Cat finished talking
before trying to punch him again.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the *ssholes wouldn’t just give him the video out
of kindness. All Old Cat wanted was Kong Fei’s feather. Stay Up
Late said, “Old Cat, if you take me to see Littleflower, I will
give you the feather.”</p>
<p>When he said that, Old Cat and Han Sen were both shocked.</p>
<p>The five elites had offered so many deals, and yet Stay Up Late
hadn’t spared a second thought of accepting any. Now, to see
Littleflower, he was willing to give up the priceless feather. It
was an extremely touching moment.</p>
<p>Old Cat shouted, “See? This is what you call a real man. And who
are you? A father, supposedly.”</p>
<p>After that, Old Cat walked up to Stay Up Late and smiled. “It’s
not that I do not wish to take you, but ordinary people… When they
go there, they cannot survive. I wouldn’t have brought Littleflower
if I didn’t know he was special. So, how about you just give me the
feather, and I will pass it along to Littleflower?”</p>
<p>“Unless I get to properly see Littleflower, I won’t spare it
another thought,” Stay Up Late said calmly.</p>
<p>Old Cat felt depressed. “How do I make you guys believe what I’m
doing is for the good of Littleflower? If anyone could go,</p>
<p>I’d have taken you both there already.”</p>
<p>“I can’t see Littleflower, so nothing changes.” Han Sen stopped.
He stopped chasing Old Cat because he was unable to catch him.</p>
<p>Old Cat sighed and said, “It’s fine if you choose not to give me
the feathers. I’ll find another way, but I’ll tell you right now
that you are both so weak. Carrying those feathers is like carrying
ticking time bombs. If you don’t give them to me, I suggest you get
rid of them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe anyone will come and steal them.” Han Sen
lifted his lips.</p>
<p>“They are afraid of Kong Fei, so of course they haven’t tried to
steal the feathers yet. But some creatures will be more reckless
than the beings you have encountered so far,” Old Cat said. He
looked up at Stay Up Late and said, “I say Beast Area is a great
choice. You’d be fine there, and you can keep the deified feather.
And, you can find a home with that faction.”</p>
<p>“And about you…” Old Cat stared at Han Sen with a look of
remorse.</p>
