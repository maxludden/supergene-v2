    <p>
      The spectators all froze in their seats. The Light Son of God was getting
      pummeled by Han Sen over and over, until he was black and blue from head
      to toe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Left-punch, right-punch, elbow-strike, knee-strike—the Light Son of God
      was like a punching bag, getting attacked without reprieve. His face was a
      sordid, disfigured mess.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sound of beaten flesh and rattled bones was almost sinister, and
      hearing it shocked all those who watched and listened. People
      couldn&#8217;t believe the Light Son of God could ever be treated so
      poorly and have such a wretched day.
    </p>

    <p>
      But amongst all these hits, there was one thing Han Sen could not do; he
      could not break the Light Son of God&#8217;s bones. The bodies of super
      spirits were too strong, and even the Light Son of God—who had no
      prioritization of vitality—had unbreakable bones.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can&#8217;t kill me, you pitiable human. You can&#8217;t kill a
      Son of God. Once your energy has depleted, I am going to make you suffer
      my wrath and end you!&#8221; The Light Son of God was seething with rage,
      and he gritted his teeth to spitefully curse his opponent aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had been drawn to Han Sen by a strange force. Despite all he tried, he
      could not break away and create distance between himself and Han Sen. All
      he could do was suffer the repeated blows. The punches he had received
      were innumerable, and his pretty face was now a maimed wreck. His heart
      only wanted one thing right then, and that was to kill Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he was stripped of all strength, and he could not use his hands to
      utilize his great speed and power as he did before. In such close-quarter
      combat, he was unable to compete with Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Light Son of God was aware that humans did not possess an infinite
      amount of energy, and using such exhaustive powers to restrain and pummel
      him was sure to be taxing for the caster. Once Han Sen&#8217;s energy had
      depleted, he would fight back and destroy his assaulter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not care what hostile words the Light Son of God spoke, and he
      just continued casting his Elephant-Disc Punch all across the
      spirit&#8217;s body—his head, especially.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am going to kill you! I am going to kill you!&#8221; the Light
      Son of God screamed in a frenzy. He wished he could tear Han Sen apart, as
      his face had devolved into a hideous hodgepodge of bruises and blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;ll get the chance to,&#8221; Han Sen
      replied, coldly. Han Sen pushed the energy in his right arm to the max,
      and elephants trumpeted and stampeded all about his body. A primitive,
      beastly power now energized his fist; it was like God himself was going to
      smite his enemy with all his might.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      That horrible fist rocketed into the Light Son of God&#8217;s face,
      shattering his skull. Blood and brain matter sprayed everywhere while the
      rotten, headless corpse was still propped up by Han Sen&#8217;s other
      hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen first began punching the Light Son of God&#8217;s head, he
      used Yin Force and Elephant-Disc Punch. To finish his foe off, he used
      Elephant-Rex Strike. It detonated the Yin Force that had built up inside
      his enemy&#8217;s head, causing it to explode from the inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside the battlefield was all quiet. It was like the audience had turned
      to stone upon seeing the headless corpse in front of Han Sen. They could
      not believe Han Sen had overcome the odds and beaten the Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      The body of the Light Son of God began to disintegrate into sparkles, as
      he was returned to his spirit stone. Han Sen exited the Divinity&#8217;s
      Bout battleground and returned to the Crystal Palace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen collapsed and hit the floor. He had exhausted far too much power
      over the course of that fight. Jade-Sun Force and Long Live could sustain
      him for a long time, but when he drew too much power at once, it took a
      long while for to recover.
    </p>

    <p>
      He didn&#8217;t only use Elephant-Rex Strike this time; he simulated the
      energy flows of multiple creatures. With such a large energy output, in
      addition to the damage he had already sustained, it was a miracle that he
      lasted as long as he did.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it wasn&#8217;t for the reward of becoming one of the ten Son of
      God&#8217;s, Han Sen would not have held on as long as he did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, even though the Light Son of God&#8217;s speed was
      frightening, his body was not as tough as a super creature&#8217;s. This
      was what allowed Han Sen to finish him off in the way he did.
    </p>

    <p>
      But beating the Light Son of God was largely because of his usage of the
      gourd&#8217;s energy flow. He initially thought the energy flow was
      useless, but the opposite turned out to be true.
    </p>

    <p>
      He never expected the suction of the gourd&#8217;s energy could draw the
      Light Son of God towards him. Although it didn&#8217;t totally restrain
      his body, it lowered the Light Son of God&#8217;s speed enough for Han Sen
      to keep up. If it wasn&#8217;t for this, Han Sen would most likely not
      have been able to defeat him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t ever want to struggle through a fight like that
      again.&#8221; Han Sen continued to lie on the floor, as his entire body
      rocked with pain. He couldn&#8217;t even muster the strength to move his
      fingers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero approached, holding the silver fox in her arms. Zero tried to heal
      the wounds he had sustained, while the silver fox used its tongue to lick
      the greater traumas he had incurred.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quietly, Han Sen recovered. The Alliance, on the other hand, was busy.
      Dollar had just beaten the Light Son of God and earned a position amongst
      the ten Son of God&#8217;s. This made him the first human Son of God in
      recorded history. For humanity to be able to achieve something as big as
      this, it was no small topic. People were going crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the news organizations reported Dollar&#8217;s victory over the Light
      Son of God, and his earning a position as a Son of God. Each and every one
      gushed praise over his heroism.
    </p>

    <p>
      The night after, Dollar&#8217;s name became synonymous with the word
      &#8220;hero.&#8221; The fight between Dollar and the Light Son of God was
      on the tip of everyone&#8217;s tongue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollar is too strong! He is the first Son of God in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I still can&#8217;t believe he did it. Dollar actually beat the
      Light Son of God.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It was brutal! He blew the Light Son of God&#8217;s head
      off.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There are no other gods, following Dollar. To assert a position as
      a Son of God is a staggering achievement, and the First God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary&#8217;s Divinity&#8217;s Bout does not offer half the
      challenge.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This Dollar isn&#8217;t too bad. After all these years, it has been
      nice to have ourselves a Son of God.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy!&#8221;</p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      Ordinary people were more than pleased over Dollar&#8217;s simple victory,
      whereas those in the Alliance were dying to find out where he might be.
      His performance was terrifying, especially the manner in which he killed
      the Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without a doubt, Dollar had managed to absorb a Life Geno essence. All
      they would have to do to learn his secrets was track him down. But their
      investigations all led to dead ends, and they were unable to find the
      elusive figure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s doppelganger remained in the Goddess Shelter while he
      rested and recovered in the Crystal Palace, waiting for Divinity&#8217;s
      Bout to end.
    </p>

    <p>
      He decided to never join another Divinity&#8217;s Bout. With his current
      level of power, fighting super spirits was still a difficult and dangerous
      affair. Beating the Light Son of God was solely because of his usage of
      the gourd&#8217;s energy flow, and if he had not done that, he could never
      have managed to beat him.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he had gone up against a super spirit that focused on vitality instead,
      he would never have managed to break through its defense.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first ten rewards were randomized. He didn&#8217;t need to fight and
      achieve a higher place, for the chance of earning an even better reward.
      Gunning for first place would be impossible, as things were right now,
      anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dollar was a household name and super famous across the entire Alliance
      now. Although the fights could not be recorded, someone animated a
      recreation of the battle. It was only three minutes long, but it became
      the most watched video for a whole week.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of people were inspired by the battle to create video games of it,
      too.
