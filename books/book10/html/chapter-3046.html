<p>The white-clothed young man reacted quickly. He went behind Han
Sen and grabbed him by the clothes.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to throw the landlord’s stupid son away since
they did not know each other. He did not know if the young man was
a good guy or a bad guy, and he did not want to be his meat
shield.</p>
<p>The beautiful, angel-like woman broke space and arrived. She did
not seem to care much about anything. She pointed at Han Sen with a
long sword. Scary thunder rolled through the sky and broke space.
It was obviously trying to blow Han Sen and the white-clothed young
man behind him into charcoal.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to start any trouble, but he was not going
to allow others to bully him. Thus, he threw a punch at the
lightning coming from space.</p>
<p>Peaceful was next to them. She shouted, “Careful! She has
combined with the god class gene race Big Space Thunder God Eagle!
Big Space Thunder God can destroy everything and travel a thousand
miles! Do not underestimate it!”</p>
<p>The lightning came too quickly. Before Peaceful could finish,
Han Sen’s fist had already smacked the scary lightning.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The electric light exploded. Han Sen blew up the scary
lightning. It flickered in the sky. It did not hurt Han Sen, and it
was not sent into the white-clothed young man’s body.</p>
<p>Peaceful’s mouth opened wide. She could not even close her
mouth. Going against Big Space God Thunder with his body and not
being harmed was incredible. It was beyond what she could have ever
believed.</p>
<p>The beautiful lady in the sky also looked shocked, but it was
just for one moment. In the next second, she started swinging her
long sword. Many Big Space God Lightning came striking down at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“This world really does still possess elites.” Han Sen’s fist
felt a bit numb. Although the lightning could not hurt him, it made
him feel bad.</p>
<p>Seeing more thunder break space and come, Han Sen waved his fist
back to welcome them. With one punch after another, he broke the
incoming lightning. Sparks exploded everywhere. It was like a god
battle shower with thunder and sparks.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Mister Yang and Peaceful were frozen. Mister
Yang thought Han Sen was not a human. Peaceful looked at Han Sen as
if she was not watching a real person.</p>
<p>From his position behind Han Sen, the white-clothed young man
looked happy. After hiding behind Han Sen’s strong body, he felt as
if there was nothing to be afraid of in the entire world. He
shouted, “Han Sen, don’t you like maids? Go get that powerful
woman! I will have her and Peaceful be your maids!”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard him say that, he thought it was rather funny
and ridiculous. Han Sen could have any girl he wanted, but he never
really got obsessed with women.</p>
<p>Besides, he could just beat that angelic, beautiful woman. He
did not need the young man to grant him anything.</p>
<p>Peaceful, who was next to them, looked worse than Han Sen. That
landlord’s stupid still remembered that.</p>
<p>Han Sen blocked a dozen lightning strikes. It looked as if his
hands were going to end up swollen by the electricity. He saw that
the beautiful lady was not ceasing her relentless discharge. He
thought it was going to be a bad situation if things carried on
that way. He jumped up and flew toward the angelic, beautiful
woman.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no choice. His body was getting repelled by the
world. He was no longer able to fly, so he had to jump. The faster
he jumped, the more power he used. That meant he felt even more
restrictions.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was like a cannon firing into the sky. The pretty
woman flapped her wings. Like lightning, she ascended to fly at a
higher altitude. Han Sen grabbed nothing and fell back to the
ground.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman did not wait for him to land. She waved her
long sword without emotion. Her body was like lightning. Her sword
was like a bolt of bullying electricity. Her body flickered amid
the lightning, which was like a sharp sword crossing. It was all
wreathed to take care of Han Sen.</p>
<p>“This woman is insane! She hasn’t said a word, yet she has come
here to try and kill us. She is just like the landlord’s stupid
son.” Han Sen felt depressed. He could not use strength in the air,
and he could not dodge her attacks. The lightning ahead was fine,
but Han Sen couldn’t block the lightning in the back. When the
thunder hit his back, it made his body shake. It was like he was
delivered a lashing from a whip.</p>
<p>Although that power could not harm his body, it did not feel
good.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. Even with the world repelling his power, it was
still stronger than what that mad woman possessed. Still, she had
flying and thunder powers. Han Sen was unable to touch her. He was
being forced into getting beat.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was feeling depressed, Small Cat, who was in his
arms, sweetly meowed. Then, Han Sen saw a red light flicker within
Small Cat. A red light went into his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his body was suddenly delivered a warm power
that surged throughout him. In the next second, the power roared
through his body. It made Han Sen unable to hold anything. He
roared into the sky. “Meow!”</p>
<p>After that cat voice shocked the sky and earth, Han Sen’s head
grew red cat ears. He also grew a fluffy cat tail behind him. Even
his eyes were red like Small Cat’s.</p>
<p>“He finally used a xenogeneic gene!” Peaceful looked frozen. She
looked at Han Sen, wanting to know what xenogeneic gene the
almighty Han Sen was using.</p>
<p>Mister Yang’s mouth opened wide. It was like he had an egg stuck
in his throat and could not scream or swallow. His face looked
extremely weird.</p>
<p>“No… That is impossible… Isn’t he a gene race… How can a gene
race transform because of a gene race?” Mister Yang’s head was too
cluttered with thoughts to think straight.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the pretty lady, who looked like thunder. Some
weird power was filling up in his eyes. It made his eyes look very
red.</p>
<p>That pretty woman saw Han Sen combine with a gene race and
transform. Her thunder power grew more powerful. She clutched a
long sword in her hands and slashed at Han Sen. The thunder
gathered up like a weird bird. It came slashing in front of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes flashed red. He fired out two red lights. He blew
up the thunder eagle. The red light did not seem to stop. It was
like a laser shooting into the sky.</p>
<p>Flowers were everywhere. The two red lights pierced through the
woman’s body. She screamed and madly looked at Han Sen. She flapped
her wings and became a bolt of lightning to escape. Suddenly, she
was in the clouds and gone.</p>
<p>After Han Sen’s eyes fired out light, it felt as if the weird
power in his body was decreasing. He could not shoot out a second
light.</p>
<p>The woman was gone, and the power inside Han Sen was gone as
well. It turned into a red light that came out of him. It gathered
up and looked like Small Cat again.</p>
<p>Now, Small Cat looked very weak. Its young claws grabbed Han
Sen’s clothes. It sounded very tired as it let out a “Meow.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was delighted. He cuddled Small Cat and complimented it.
“Not bad. Not bad. Claiming you was not such a bad idea after all.
You are much better than that Old Cat asshole.”</p>
<p>“It looks like I can use this world’s power.” Han Sen checked
out Small Cat’s body and knew that it was just a little weak. He
stopped worrying and felt happier. He thought he was unable to use
gene races, but that no longer seemed to be the case.</p>
