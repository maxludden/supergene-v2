<p>He did not find anything weird on him, so Han Sen chose to ignore it. He was trying to remember The Story of Genes.</p>

<p>In the past, Han Sen relied solely on his own power until he remembered everything that man had said. It was like he had copied and pasted the words into his mind. He did not really research the meaning behind his words though.</p>

<p>Now that he did start thinking about it, he realized The Story of Genes the Dao student mentioned had a lot of mistakes in it. A lot of what he said was about the research, involved predictions, and so on.</p>

<p>Han Sen read it all at once and realized the student did not actually study The Story of Genes. If he had studied it, the mistakes would not have existed. Han Sen believed it was just a research paper and not really a bunch of statements that came through via someone practicing the skill.</p>

<p>“Did that Dao member really mean it was research by calling it research? Did he not actually practice The Story of Genes?” Han Sen looked weird.</p>

<p>After thinking about it some more, Han Sen understood something important.</p>

<p>“The Story of Genes is too taxing on the human body. No matter how strong that Dao student was, he was just a human from the original times. The evolution level of his genes was not going to reach the requirements necessary to actually practice and find success with The Story of Genes. Therefore, all he was able to do was research it.”</p>

<p>Han Sen continued to think, “Someone in the Dao party must have practiced with The Story of Genes. After all, the black crystal armor is a sacred item that belonged to Dao. Someone must have used the black crystal armor to create The Story of Genes.”</p>

<p>Although that reverse The Story of Genes had a lot of mistakes in it, it still helped Han Sen a little. Going down a muddy road was better than no road.</p>

<p>“What a shame. I am already a pure body spirit. Aside from spirits powers, no powers can work on my body. I also cannot practice The Story of Genes anymore. Otherwise, I could try to put what I’ve just learned to the test.”</p>

<p>Han Sen was disappointed. He was hoping to find a way to sort out his spirit body. So far, he had yet to find a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>He did not want to waste any time. He decided on flying to the 33 skies. If he was unable to sort out his spirit body, he might as well investigate and find out precisely what Qin Xiu was up to.</p>

<p>It was unknown if it was because of the spirit body, but Han Sen could no longer rip space. He only needed to think about where he wanted to go and would appear there. With this neat method of travel, he thought about Soldier Knife Sky and appeared there.</p>

<p>Han Sen noticed that he no longer had to go to the God Chaos Party by breaking a tunnel in space. His spirit body was able to go through the 33 skies barrier. He was not stopped.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the sky powers will affect my spirit body?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. His spirit body floated on through, going through layer after layer of the skies. He eventually reached Dust Sky.</p>

<p>In Dust Sky, any power was weakened. Even a God Spirit would become a common creature in such a place.</p>

<p>Back in the day, Han Sen had fought there and been put at a dire disadvantage. Now, with his spirit body appearing there, he was not affected. It was like the powers of Dust Sky no longer existed.</p>

<p>“That means I can use this spirit body to go through the 33 skies and reach the geno universe…” Han Sen was pretty excited about this concept. After thinking about it some more, he felt depressed.</p>

<p>“Even if I do go through the 33 skies and reach the old universe, so what? No one will be able to see me. It does not matter if I return or not.” Han Sen felt very troubled.</p>

<p>“I should just go and take a look at what Qin Xiu is doing first.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. It took him to the next sky.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, Han Sen had already asked big sky demon for the old tower’s location there. In just a few more thoughts, he was already brought before the 17th sky’s old tower.</p>

<p>That sky was where Qin Xiu lived. Big sky demon had said that aside from Qin Xiu, no member of the God Chaos Party was allowed to visit there.</p>

<p>“My spirit body is pretty nifty when it comes to traveling. There is nothing in this world that stops me from getting to where I need and want to go.” Han Sen spoke in a self-deprecating manner to mock himself.</p>

<p>The old tower was sealed tight. Han Sen came before it and went right through the front door. What he saw next surprised him. The first floor of the old tower was very empty. There were four walls and some metal boxes that looked like sarcophaguses for mummies. Han Sen calculated there were 11 metal boxes.</p>

<p>He did not see Qin Xiu, but he was curious about the metal boxes. He flew over to the metal boxes. His spirit body was not inhibited, so he was able to fly right into them.</p>

<p>After going into the metal boxes, Han Sen was surprised by what he saw. A pair of red eyes were staring at him like a ghost.</p>

<p>Han Sen had a closer look. He noticed that the eyes were not staring at him. They were just looking straight ahead.</p>

<p>There was a creature inside, but he had no idea what it was supposed to be. Its body had many layers of a white substance. It was more like snakeskin. It was unknown what the creature might have looked like on the inside. Its eyes had two holes. The eyes were red. It was like the creature was enduring unimaginable pain and suffering.</p>

<p>Han Sen figured it was likely one of Qin Xiu’s life soul test subjects. He was not interested in trying to find out what precisely that white stuff was either.</p>

<p>After flying out of the metal box, Han Sen entered a few more metal boxes to see what was inside of them. Every metal box had a test subject that was molting or peeling in a horrid fashion.</p>

<p>He teleported to the second floor of the old tower. Everything there was precisely the same. There were many more of those metal boxes.</p>

<p>Han Sen flew up layer by layer. The image of each chamber was similar. Some layers had many metal boxes, whereas other floors only had a few metal boxes.</p>

<p>He went all the way up to the 10th floor. He saw a crystal stand and Wan’er, who was blonde, wearing a white robe. She was fast asleep on a crystal bed. She looked very sweet as she slept.</p>

<p>“Weird. This place is already the old tower’s top. Why is Qin Xiu not here? I thought Qin Xiu spent all of his time practicing in the old tower.” Han Sen looked around some more, but he could find no hide nor hair of Qin Xiu. He thought something had to be wrong.</p>

<p>“If Qin Xiu is not in the tower, where is he?” Han Sen thought with a frown. He could not think of a reason as to why this could be.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I can touch Wan’er?” Han Sen reached his hand out to see if he could touch Wan’er’s hair, but his hand went through her scalp. He could not feel a thing.</p>

<p>Han Sen was disappointed. Wan’er had a reverse Super God Spirit mode, yet their bodies could not interact. His spirit body was very weird.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept going back and forth around the old tower. The place was not as mysterious as he thought it might be. On top of that, Qin Xiu was not even there.</p>

<p>“Although Wan’er has been revived, she did not seem to remember all the time we spent together. There is an 80% to 90% chance that this revived Wan’er only remembers what happened in the Qin Kingdom. What a shame that is.” Han Sen looked at Wan’er and sighed.</p>

<p>If the Wan’er with a nice will still existed, perhaps she might have been able to affect Qin Xiu. She might have been able to convince Qin Xiu to not be so overbearing.</p>

<p>“It is such a shame that I have no way to bring your will back,” Han Sen thought. If he had the power needed, he would make the nice Wan’er wake up. That would be the real Wan’er.</p>

<p>While Han Sen was thinking, he realized his hand was flickering with a purple light.</p>
