<h2>Teacher Han</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2143</h3>

<p>Over the course of the past few days, in which Four Season Duke
attended the lectures given by Han Sen, he had selected a seat
closer and closer to the stage each time. And on this day, he had
snagged himself a front row seat.</p>
<p>When he stood up, everyone turned to look at him.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the Yun sisters were profusely
worried, hoping nothing awful was going to happen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had noticed Four Season Duke’s presence two days prior
to this confrontation, but he hadn’t paid the man a second’s heed.
Now that Four Season Duke was standing up, though, Han Sen gave the
man his full attention.</p>
<p>Teacher Han, I have listened to your lessons on Suppress Evil
punches over the past few days. And I must confess, I have learned
a lot. That being said, I have questions concerning your
techniques. Perhaps you can perform a punch for me, and then answer
a few questions I have?” Four Season Duke spoke with a guise of
complete sincerity.</p>
<p>After that, many students seemed to freeze in place. Thousand
Feather Crane and the Yun sisters stared at Four Season Duke as if
they had just seen a ghost.</p>
<p>Four Season Duke wasn’t mocking him, though. Based on the way he
referred to Han Sen as Teacher Han, he wasn’t pretending to be in
awe of Han Sen. He was speaking as a teacher to a peer.</p>
<p>Because of Four Season Duke’s rank, the fact that he referred to
Han Sen as a teacher was a seal of his approval. It was to show
that he actually had some respect for Han Sen. Since he was a Duke
while Han Sen was still a Marquise, he could have just referred to
Han Sen by his full name and not by the title.</p>
<p>Many of the Sky Palace students, seeing Four Season Duke ask so
sincerely, thought they were dreaming. With Four Season Duke’s rank
and fame, it was impressive for him to make a request of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>After Four Season Duke left Han Sen’s lectures every day, he had
started practicing when he went home. He was a professional with
Suppress Evil, and he knew more about the skill than ordinary
people. Because of that, he could see deeper into the essence of
the Suppress Evil punches.</p>
<p>After a few days of avid research, Four Season Duke learned many
things he had not noticed before. And that had brought him to
actually admire Han Sen.</p>
<p>Since this was the final day of Han Sen’s lessons, he couldn’t
stop himself from requesting that Han Sen perform the punch
himself. He wanted to know the feelings that could be elicited from
Han Sen’s performance of a Suppress Evil punch.</p>
<p>People couldn’t blame him for wanting to know this, of course.
He was a Duke. He could not go to the Hidden Path Cave himself to
look at the seventy-two original gene kill spells. If he was able
to understand the feelings of the kill spells from a Suppress Evil
punch, it’d be great for his own practice and further
advancement.</p>
<p>“Ah, you are too polite. If you are interested in my lame
talents, then I will perform them for you. If I can improve, please
advise me on what I could do to better myself.” Han Sen had planned
to show off the punch on the last day, anyway. This way, he could
do Four Season Duke a favor as well.</p>
<p>Four Season Duke was happy to hear this, and so he said, “No. I
only want to learn from you. I have no ulterior motive.”</p>
<p>Han Sen said no more. He simply nodded. He went on stage and
said, “In ten days, I have taught six punches. Today, I will
demonstrate them for you. Please observe. Perhaps they can be of
assistance to you.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen began casting Ghost Star Punch. Then, he
performed the skills one after another.</p>
<p>Han Sen had learned seventy-two Suppress Evil punches following
the seventy-two original gene kill spells. Every punch carried the
meaning of a kill spell. As Han Sen performed the six that he had
promised, it felt as if the kill spell had come alive. The kill air
gave people a frightful chill. That feeling disturbed their minds,
even.</p>
<p>Whenever Han Sen launched a punch, he was like a beast breaking
a river. One skill had one meaning. Han Sen showed six punching
skills to them. It was like six scary beasts trying to suppress the
earth itself. In people’s eyes, Han Sen was no longer a human. He
was six wild beasts.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace students were jittery with excitement by the time
he finished. Four Season Duke looked as if he was drunk, for when
Han Sen finished his performance, the Duke was totally frozen in
place. It was like he had been drowned in the feelings of the fist
techniques.</p>
<p>“So that was Teacher Han’s six-fist-technique. That must have
saved me sixty years of practice. I am lucky!” Four Season Duke
bowed before Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Four Season Duke, you are too kind!” Han Sen bowed back.</p>
<p>After that, the Suppress Evil punch became famous across all of
Sky Palace. It was taken to the Sky Path Garden, and it was
modified. It swiftly became one of the must-have skills of Sky
Palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s reputation was glowing even brighter than before. And
because he had created the Suppress Evil punch, he was handsomely
rewarded.</p>
<p>After that, Four Season Duke regularly visited Jade Island to
practice Suppress Evil alongside Han Sen. Han Sen taught him the
seventy-two Suppress Evil punches, and Han Sen was able to learn
much about Suppress Evil from Four Season Duke, as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Suppress Evil punch was a very efficient method. It
allowed students to learn Suppress Evil fast, but if someone wanted
to master the skill, they would need the experience someone like
Four Season Duke had.</p>
<p>Han Sen learned a great deal from Four Season Duke, and he grew
to really admire the man. This was a teacher that did true research
the hard way. He was genuinely worthy of all that respect.</p>
<p>Four Season Duke admired Han Sen’s Suppress Evil punch, too.
Whenever he taught Suppress Evil, he began using Suppress Evil
punches to allow his students to understand things easier.</p>
<p>“Does Han Sen ever do things that are boring or mundane? He is a
wonder with everything he does.” When the Sky Palace leader said
this, he smiled.</p>
<p>“Only Kings can go into Hidden Path Cave. When visiting the
seventy-two original gene kill spells, they can become
half-deified. No one is interested in it after this, and if they
fail, they cannot perform the seventy-two punching skills as well
as Han Sen, either. Only Han Sen can do what he does. He made
Suppress Evil easier to learn, though. The students don’t need to
spend as much time studying it. While it may be considered as
corner-cutting, it’s undeniably a good method.” The black-masked
woman went on to say, “And I heard that when Lone Bamboo saw Han
Sen’s Suppress Evil punch, he requested his own visit to Hidden
Path Cave? That is surprising.”</p>
<p>Sky Palace leader nodded, and he said, “Lone Bamboo has been
there for half a month. He won’t be back for another year, I
suspect. But there is trouble on Metal World.”</p>
<p>The masked woman had a wry smile. “If we knew that we were on
the cusp of discovering Metal World, we wouldn’t have allowed Lone
Bamboo to enter just yet. Now that he is focusing on the cave, it
is not suitable to disrupt him and send him to Metal World.”</p>
<p>“I can’t think of a Marquise aside from Lone Bamboo that can do
this task for us,” Sky Palace leader said.</p>
<p>The masked woman laughed and said, “If Han Sen is the reason
Lone Bamboo went into the Hidden Path Cave, then Han Sen should be
the one to do what Lone Bamboo was supposed to. We should have him
go to Metal World.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a good idea. He isn’t a Marquise yet,” the Sky
Palace leader said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“And yet he even killed Dragon Nine? You can use him as a
Marquise. And he needs the resources. This is a perfectly viable
opportunity.” The masked woman laughed again.</p>
