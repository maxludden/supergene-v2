<h2>Breaking Point</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2969</h3>

<p>Xie Qing King asked, “Did you notice that the God Spirit that
defeated you looked like Moment Queen?”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. “I am starting to think the spirits inside the
sanctuaries are partially created from the God Spirits of God
Spirits.”</p>
<p>Xie Qing King’s eyes turned bright as he said, “I think so too.
If that is true, is there a God Spirit that looks like me?”</p>
<p>“What? Are you going to have a reunion with him?” Wang Yuhang
asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“I am going to beat him,” Xie Qing King seriously said. “I will
not allow another me to exist in this world.”</p>
<p>“Ha! If that God Spirit is as strong as the one that beat Han
Sen, you will be killed.” Wang Yuhang was not being very
supportive.</p>
<p>“You can’t say that, but it is a shame that I am not a true
god,” Xie Qing King said while stretching. “It is pointless for me
to think of achieving that victory any time soon.”</p>
<p>After they said that, it reminded Han Sen of something.</p>
<p>The creatures in the universe that evolved to that level seemed
to be as far as they could take themselves. All of the creatures
were only capable of becoming true god and no higher. There was no
room for improvement.</p>
<p>If one wanted to become stronger, one had to practice all kinds
of geno arts to increase their geno arts. It was either that or get
their hands on special treasures and god personality armaments.
That was the only way to improve one’s battle power.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt that even though he had changed to xenogeneic mode,
his pure power was still worse than Moment God. Unless he had the
buffs of powerful treasures and a god personality armament, he
would be unable to fight her face-to-face.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Little Angel who was near him. “People say
they must be away when they drive the car ahead. When the flowers
go dim, you can find the village. Now, I do not have the power to
level up, and God Spirit genes cannot be absorbed. Maybe other
people cannot level up, but maybe I stand a chance.”</p>
<p>Little Angel’s face was pretty and calm. When she was not in the
battle angel mode, one couldn’t tell she was actually very
powerful.</p>
<p>“Little Angel has just become primitive now. If she becomes a
true god and combines herself with me, she can probably strengthen
my fitness by a considerable amount. With all her tricks involved,
it might be what I need to tackle Moment God.” Han Sen made his
mind up. He was going to help Little Angel become true god.</p>
<p>If he was able to get Xie Qing King, Wang Yuhang, Huangfu Jing,
and others to true god class, that would help as well. That was
especially true of Moment Queen. If she reached true god class,
that would be of great service.</p>
<p>Leveling up to true god class cost a lot of energy, but Han Sen
needed to save Golden Growler as soon as possible. Raising one true
god would be hard enough. He did not have the time to build a big
enough stockpile of resources to get everyone to true god.</p>
<p>“Resources. Resources. Resources. I need resources. Space
Garden’s resources are only sufficient for bringing someone to
primitive class. To keep leveling up, we need more resources than
what Space Garden can provide. Where can I get more resources?” Han
Sen kept thinking. If he wanted more resources, he would have to
fight for some. Aside from that, there did not seem to be another
valid option.</p>
<p>“Whose resources should I take?” The first thing Han Sen thought
to plunder were the spoils of the Extreme King’s territory.</p>
<p>The Very High had a lot of power, and there were a lot of elites
there. Going to Outer Sky would not be very easy.</p>
<p>The Ancient God always saw the dragon heads and never the tails.
They did not have many resources stored. Taking Ancient God’s
resources was pointless.</p>
<p>As for Sky Palace, it was full of elites. Han Yan was practicing
in Sky Palace, and Yisha was in Sky Palace. He could not go rob Sky
Palace of all of its resources. That was the main reason he let Sky
Palace’s first seat go.</p>
<p>“Once again, that leaves the Extreme King.” Han Sen kept
thinking about it. He pondered deeply about how he should go about
it.</p>
<p>He did not think he could just kill the Extreme King. The
Extreme King had been in operation for many years. There were lots
of elites in that race, but they also had countless troves of
treasure. Even if Han Sen used his Holy Kirin and was not afraid of
fighting them one-on-one, he was not strong enough to fight the
entire Extreme King race.</p>
<p>While Han Sen wondered about how he should start stealing
resources from the Extreme King, he saw the god palace be
approached by a scary creature in space.</p>
<p>The god temple the creature went to was at the bottom of the god
palace. It was like the thunder god that was eaten by Ghost Car. It
was just a destroyed class God Spirit.</p>
<p>Even so, it was difficult to determine if the scary creature
could defeat the God Spirit. In the end, it did not manage to kill
it. It was almost killed by the God Spirit. When it broke its legs,
it made a hurried departure from the god temple.</p>
<p>While Wang Yuhang and the others dispersed, Han Sen took Ancient
Abyss Grandmaster out of Destiny’s Tower and locked him up in
Purgatory Heaven that Zero managed.</p>
<p>In Purgatory Heaven, Han Sen looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster
and asked, “Grandmaster, can you answer a few questions?”</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was like an old monk meditating. After
a while, he opened his eyes and coldly replied, “What difference
does it make if I give you answers or not?”</p>
<p>“If your answers satisfy me, perhaps I will let you live,” Han
Sen said.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster shook his head. “I know a lot of your
secrets now. If I were you, I would not let you live at all.”</p>
<p>“Grandmaster is very smart. I won’t let you leave, but I can
have you live here temporarily, right?” Han Sen laughed and said,
“With Grandmaster’s tricks, perhaps one day you will find a way to
escape.”</p>
<p>“You are right. If I live, there might be a chance of that
happening.” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster seemed to be very accepting
of this. He raised his head and said, “One question for a 10-year
extension of my life.”</p>
<p>“Sure, but you need to answer at least 10 of my questions,” Han
Sen said. “If you cannot answer the question, the deal is
void.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster quickly answered.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Han Sen asked, “What do you know
about the Nine-Defense Palace?”</p>
<p>“Do you mean about the spirits?” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster
coldly replied.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen was delighted. He did not expect Ancient Abyss
Grandmaster to know about the spirits there.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was silent a moment before saying, “I
actually don’t know much. I only know that when Sacred was
destroyed, Mister Alpha obtained Sacred Leader’s research. A part
of it was about spirits. There was, of course, Nine-Defense Palace.
The matters about Nine-Defense Palace are articles of knowledge
only the king and future kings are eligible to learn. I only know a
little. I only know that Mister Alpha wanted to use spirits to
create a powerful weapon. It would have likely been a holy spirit
similar to the Holy Kirin.”</p>
<p>“Did it pan out?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss looked at Han Sen and asked, “Is that your second
question?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“I think so,” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster said. “The king had a
treasure that lasted a long time, but no others have seen it.
Everyone who saw that treasure is now dead. In the history of the
Extreme King, a few disasters were corrected solely by the
existence of that treasure. I think that it was a weapon the
Extreme King used spirits to create.”</p>
