<p>Yang Zikun did not ask Han Sen to meet in God&#8217;s Sanctuary, but managed to get Han Sen out of Blackhawk and took him to a private club.</p>

<p>Han Sen had little faith in the so-called closed-door military training at this point. Those with means could always open the doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister, you did not go through all this trouble just to drink with me, right?&#8221; Sitting on the couch, Han Sen asked Yang Zikun who was sitting opposite him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother, today I asked you to come both to learn boomerang skills from you and to ask for a favor.&#8221; Yang Zikun was very polite to Han Sen. Since Han Sen beat him at boomerang, Yang Zikun had thought of Han Sen as a master.</p>

<p>Yang Zikun had spent a lot of time practicing butterfly boomerang recently, but the effect was not ideal. He had asked a lot of masters to gain a bit progress. However, if he wanted to reach Han Sen&#8217;s level, it would take him years of hard work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Business first. You can learn boomerang from me anytime. I have a fair rate for tutoring,&#8221; Han Sen smiled and said.</p>

<p>Yang Zikun gave him a thumbs-up and said, &#8220;Great. I love how direct you are. I&#8217;ll be straightforward with you then. I&#8217;ve asked you to come today because I need some sacred-blood beast souls and wonder if I can purchase some in Steel Armor Shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sacred-blood beast souls are rare. Too many people need them, yet too few want to sell. Even if someone was to evolve and sell part of their sacred-blood beast souls, those beast souls would most likely be reserved in advance. You should know that very well,&#8221; Han Sen pondered and said.</p>

<p>When Qin Xuan evolved, she only kept two sacred-blood beast souls with her to enter Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Her other beast souls were reserved long before they went to an auction.</p>

<p>Those who had purchased her sacred-blood beast souls were probably extremely wealthy people like Yang Zikun, Yuan and Qing. After they got their hands on the sacred-blood beast souls, it was highly unlikely that they would sell them again. These people normally chose to bring all the sacred-blood beast souls with them when they became evolvers.</p>

<p>Although the sacred-blood beast souls from First God&#8217;s Sanctuary would not be considered strong in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, in the early stage, they could still be helpful.</p>

<p>That was one of the reasons why the sacred-blood beast souls were so rare in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is easy, I will not need to ask for your help, brother.&#8221; Yang Zikun turned on the holographic video, and the image of a person appeared.</p>

<p>The clip was pre-recorded. That person summoned his beast souls one by one and introduced them.</p>

<p>After showing the clip, Yang Zikun showed Han Sen and another clip that was similar to the first one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother, I want to trade with you for sacred-blood beast souls. I can offer you beast souls or warframes. This private club is specialized in beast soul dealing. You can have a look at the clips. If you have a certain beast soul in mind, I can trade with you. Most people here are not from Steel Armor Shelter,&#8221; said Yang Zikun.</p>

<p>Han Sen&#8217;s eyes lit up. He asked, &#8220;Does this private club also deal beast souls from Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yang Zikun was puzzled and explained to Han Sen, &#8220;That is possible. But most deals are conducted in the same phase. It would be harder to exchange across different phases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to exchange sacred-blood beast souls in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary for sacred-blood beast souls in the second, what would that be like?&#8221; Han Sen asked. His family was doing well financially, but he had hoped to gain some sacred-blood beast souls for his mother to guarantee her safety in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary was not like the first. It was extremely risky and even the shelters were not 100% safe.</p>

<p>Creatures would attack shelters in large groups in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, which was different from the First.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wanted to trade, that&#8217;s okay. But it depends on what kind of beast souls you have. Normally speaking, three sacred-blood beast souls from First God&#8217;s Sanctuary could be used to trade for one sacred-blood beast soul in the second. After all, it is much more difficult to gain a sacred-blood beast soul in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary,&#8221; explained Yang Zikun briefly.</p>

<p>Han Sen pondered for a while and said to Yang Zikun, &#8220;I do have some sacred-blood beast souls on hand, but I am not interested in anything else but the sacred-blood beast souls in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. And the trade must be conducted in Sapphire Shelter of Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yang Zikun looked at Han Sen and asked, &#8220;Brother, do you have any requirement for the types of beast souls you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would prefer beast soul armor, followed by beast soul mount and beast soul wings.&#8221; Han Sen wanted to get some beast souls that could keep his mother safe.</p>

<p>When he evolved and entered Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, it would be easy for him to get beast souls and meat for his mother. The most important thing was to keep his mother alive.</p>

<p>Although Luo Sulan was located in a large human shelter and all she did was killing ordinary creatures and primitive creatures at most, it was hard to say what would happen in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Many human shelters be destroyed overnight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a minute.&#8221; Yang Zikun checked his comlink and dialed a number. A man of about sixty years old appeared in the holographic image.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young master.&#8221; The man bowed to Yang Zikun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Xu, could you check for me how many sacred-blood beast souls we could use in Sapphire Shelter of Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary?&#8221; Asked Yang Zikun.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, young master. I will report to you when I have the information.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yang Zikun turned off his comlink and said to Han Sen with a smile, &#8220;Brother, let&#8217;s see if anything interests you. If there is something you like, then we will continue our discussion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen nodded and admired Yang Zikun&#8217;s masterful manner. Indeed, Yang Zikun was the grandson of a demigod. Although he was still young, he treated everyone gracefully.</p>

<p>Shortly, Mr. Xu knocked on the door in person and showed a video clip to Yang Zikun, while explaining, &#8220;Currently, we have three sacred-blood beast souls that we can use in Sapphire shelter. One is…&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had explained everything, Mr. Xu stepped back and waited for Yang Zikun to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother, what do you think?&#8221; Yang Zikun asked Han Sen.</p>

<p>Mr. Xu looked at Han Sen in surprise. He knew very well Yang Zikun&#8217;s character and thought Han Sen must be someone important so that Yang Zikun will treat him this way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very interested in the sacred-blood armor and sacred-blood mount. I have three sacred-blood beast souls that I want to use to exchange for those two. Do you think that&#8217;s doable?&#8221; Han Sen pondered and asked.</p>
