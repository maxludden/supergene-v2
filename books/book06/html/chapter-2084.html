<h2>Ten Thousand Gourds Moving Together</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2084</h3>

<p>Han Sen hesitated, wondering if he should keep going. The gourds
were having a very strong reaction, and he was afraid something
might happen.</p>
<p>But since he was already out on the vine, going back didn’t seem
like a good idea. He had to press on with Bao’er.</p>
<p>The movement of the gourd vines was shocking all of Sky Palace.
The Sky Palace leader, who was in the middle of practice, opened
his eyes. The nobles and the elders watched the shaking gourd vine
via their own means. Even the Dream Beast woke up from his slumber
to look at Bao’er, who was being carried on Han Sen’s chest.</p>
<p>In the tower of a jade city, a green-clothed man stood alone. He
watched the gourd vine and looked surprised.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace gourd vine was a deified plant. Even if a deified
elite came, it wouldn’t have that reaction unless the elite was a
hostile.</p>
<p>But now, it was having such a drastic reaction to Han Sen and
his child. Something like this had never occurred before. “What is
this? What’s happening to the gourd vine?” Yun Suyi asked with
confusion.</p>
<p>No one could answer her question, though. So, Yun Suyi continued
to watch in shock as Han Sen and his daughter crossed the
madly-shaking gourd vine.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gourd that was as big as a stove began to shine. A
sword-light came out of the gourd and went straight for Bao’er, who
was in Han Sen’s arms.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thrilled. This was not like the first time, where he
had no clue about anything that was going on. He knew the gourd had
approved of her, and it had given her a holy gourd sword air to
practice swords with.</p>
<p>When Han Sen had walked across it the first time, the gourds
shook, but they did not give him anything.</p>
<p>A lady with a black mask, next to Sky Palace leader, said in
surprise, “It seems as if Han Sen’s daughter is a natural. She has
managed to trigger the holy gourd’s sword air. She really has the
talent. This is most fortuitous for the prestige of Sky
Palace.”</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader nodded, but he did not say anything. He
felt as if the gourd had moved too much, and that was nothing
normal.</p>
<p>The elders stared with stunned expressions.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder she is Han Sen’s daughter. She can trigger the
holy gourd sword air. She will achieve many great feats with a
sword.”</p>
<p>“Han is strong, and he has a daughter that can trigger the holy
gourd sword air. The leader will consider him even more important
now.”</p>
<p>“But it is a shame that her genes are not stable, just like Han
Sen’s. Her core genes are similar to his own. It will be difficult
for her to practice.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if she will ever become deified, but being a King
would be amazing enough. That’s a rare feat.”</p>
<p>While everyone discussed this, the holy gourd sword air touched
down on Bao’er’s forehead. It surrounded Bao’er, making her glow
with a holy sword air.</p>
<p>Then another gourd lit up. A holy gourd knife air was coming
straight at Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Look! Another gourd has been triggered. This time it is a knife
air. She is talented with knives, too?” the black-masked woman
asked in utter disbelief.</p>
<p>It was rare to trigger two gourds with different holy airs,
which meant Bao’er had great talent with knives and swords. She
could learn with those much faster than an ordinary creature.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is a knife and sword master, and it seems his daughter
is just as proficient. Genes are very important.”</p>
<p>“It is a shame that Han Sen is not a genuine student of ours.
These two could earn a lot of glory for us.”</p>
<p>“They are not our family, but the connection between the leader
and Knife Queen make it close enough.”</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s daughter has no master, and Han Sen has only been a
member for a short while. Can his daughter still enter Sky
Palace?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but the leader took Lone Bamboo as a student. He cannot
take on any more. I don’t know who her master will end up
being.”</p>
<p>“With this talent, no elder would reject the prospect of
accepting her as a student.”</p>
<p>“Not bad. Not bad. This child is talented. She has talent with
swords and knives. She will become very strong in the future.” A
King with a white beard laughed.</p>
<p>Another King nodded. “This girl is good, but her talent is
different from my own powers. If we were more compatible, I would
take her as my student.”</p>
<p>An elder laughed and said, “It is a shame she is not of the Sky.
Otherwise, I would take her as a student. She may be talented, but
she is still a crystallizer. Her genes are unstable. For her,
gaining strength will require far more effort than usual.”</p>
<p>As everyone discussed all this, the gourd vine shone again. A
gourd spat out even more holy air.</p>
<p>That holy air had lightning in it. When it reached Bao’er, it
was like she was getting thunderstruck.</p>
<p>The observers were frozen upon seeing this. They spoke to
themselves, saying, “She has talent with thunder, too? How powerful
is she?”</p>
<p>Before they could wrap their minds around what they were seeing,
more lights came out of the gourd vine. Whenever Han Sen and Bao’er
moved, all the gourds spat out holy air at Bao’er’s forehead.</p>
<p>There was gold, wood, water, fire, earth, knife, sword, lance,
spear, trident, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, sun, moon, and
galaxy.</p>
<p>All those holy airs swirled around the pair on the vine, masking
the entire path in a holy aura. The gourds were shining so bright,
they lit up the entirety of Sky Palace. The holy airs hovered
around Bao’er, waiting for their chance to land on her.</p>
<p>Frozen. Everyone was frozen. The elders, the leader, and Dream
Beast stood as still as statues. The whole of Sky Palace was silent
and unmoving.</p>
<p>Ever since Sky Palace was established, many geniuses had walked
the Sky Road. There were some deified ones, but even those only
acquired holy airs from a couple of gourds.</p>
<p>When ordinary geniuses went past, they’d be extremely lucky just
to receive one.</p>
<p>But now, all those holy gourd airs were queuing up to give
Bao’er what they had. They were like dumplings being thrown at
Bao’er’s forehead. Bao’er’s body was full of holy air. She was like
a fog, but becoming solid.</p>
<p>“Am I dreaming?” one of the Kings mumbled. He watched the holy
airs twirl around Bao’er like a tornado. He couldn’t close his
mouth.</p>
