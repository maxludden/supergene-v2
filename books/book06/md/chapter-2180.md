  Han Sen raised his head and saw a Feather woman standing beside him. She had blue eyes and blonde hair. Her snow- white wings were very attractive, and the gorgeous curves of her body were difficult to look away from.

Han Sen looked around and noticed that all the tables were taken. There weren’t many empty seats in the establishment.

Barr was occupying a table all by his lonesome, but no one wished to sit with him.

“As you please,” Han Sen said casually. Then he proceeded to ignore the Feather woman’s presence as he went back to scoffing down his meal.

Something seemed to be very wrong. The atmosphere of the place held a subtle tension, and he had the sneaking suspicion that something awry was on the verge of happening. He planned to stay there and watch whatever event was about to unfold.

The Feather woman ordered something to eat, but she didn’t talk much. She just sat where she was quietly, and when the meal came, she began eating without making a sound.

Many creatures came into the restaurant, but there were no more tables for them. They filtered through the building, looking for a spot to sit near someone else of the same race. When someone couldn’t find a seat, they stood by the wall instead of leaving.

Finally, a Duke with the head of a bull arrived. He and a few of his kind moved over to the Extreme King woman’s table. They didn’t say anything, and they just reached for chairs.

Han Sen knew that what happened next would be entertaining.

“Get lost,” the Extreme King woman barked before the bull-headed men had settled themselves.

“Young one, don’t be so cocky. That won’t turn out well for you,” the bull-headed Duke looked on her coldly. He had no intention of heeding the Extreme King’s warning. He smiled as he pulled out a seat for himself.

“D*mn it,” Han Sen sighed. He knew those bull-headed people were brainless. Even if the Duke didn’t know that she belonged to Extreme King, he should have known something was off when he saw one woman sitting by herself while every other table was packed to the gills with other people. And on top of asking for a seat, he dared to provoke her with harsh words.

As the bull-headed Duke sat down, the woman moved her arm. Before the bull-headed man realized what had happened, he had been sent flying.

Pang!

The Duke’s airborne flight sent him crashing through a wall. He flew out of the hotel’s restaurant and skidded across the ground. He struggled to get back to his feet, and blood spilled out of his mouth.

Everyone looked at the Extreme King woman in shock. The other bull-headed men in her proximity lurched back in fright, then started to run off. They picked up the injured bull-headed Duke and fled without saying a word.

Although the bull-headed Duke was not a real elite, a minor slap from the woman had almost killed him. She obviously possessed a disturbing amount of power.

Qing Li sat down and quietly told Han Sen, “Right now, every race is thinking that the traitor is hiding someplace in Steel City. They are checking around everywhere in the hopes of finding him. The bull-heads and the Destroyed seem to have a connection, too. If I am guessing correctly, they were sent here to test that woman. No one expected the woman to be so strong, and so they’re wondering if she is the traitor.”

“Do you know where the traitor comes from?” Han Sen asked.

Qing Li thought for a moment. “The one that betrayed the Destroyed isn’t actually one of the Destroyed himself. He was an outsider that joined them. The Destroyed did not say which race the person belongs to, so we have no clue who it might be. According to our investigation, the traitor’s race has yet to be determined. And there’s a good chance that the traitor can shapeshift into any race.”

After that, Qing Li looked at the Feather woman. Her eyes narrowed slightly in suspicion.

Han Sen nodded and asked, “Do you know what treasure the traitor stole?”

Qing Li nodded and said, “There is some news, but I’m not sure whether or not it is the truth. It looks like the traitor stole a deified treasure called the Destroyed Bible. That is why the Destroyed are so on edge. They really need to find that traitor and reclaim the Destroyed Bible. All the races are looking for the treasure as well. That is why the situation has become so complicated.”

“Where did this nugget of information come from?” Han Sen looked at her queerly.

“No one knows the original source, but the topic is being discussed everywhere.” Qing Li looked confused, and then she went on to ask Han Sen, “Do you think it isn’t true?”

Han Sen shrugged. “I’m just wondering. Maybe the traitor released the news himself, hoping to stir up all this chaos. That might be the way he has managed to survive. Otherwise, something so secretive wouldn’t have spread so quickly. This is just a guess, of course. I don’t really know much of anything.”

Han Sen paused, and then went on to ask, “What is the Destroyed Bible? It sounds like a geno art. Why is it considered a treasure, instead?”

Qing Li looked at Han Sen in surprise. “You’ve never heard of the Destroyed Bible? It’s a Destroyed treasure. The story goes that when the Destroyed alpha died, his xenogeneic gene became a deified treasure. And it also contains the Destroyed alpha’s powers. Inheriting that power is very difficult, however. No one can really understand it, so they can’t make use of the Destroyed Bible’s power.

Even so, the Destroyed Bible is still their most important treasure. They cherish it because it represents their race as a whole. So, the Destroyed really want the Destroyed Bible back. They won’t allow any other race to take it.”

Han Sen didn’t speak, but to himself, he was thinking, “A deified treasure sounds valuable indeed. Especially if it carries the power of a Destroyed alpha. It is no wonder that everyone seems to be after it. Even I fancy poking around for it now. But with that being said, anyone who takes it would find much ire directed at them by the Destroyed.”

Han Sen noticed that the Destroyed Marquises and Dukes were staring at Zero, Han Meng’er, Little Angel, and the Feather woman. Their eyes were intent.

Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he thought to himself, “Did they find out that the traitor that stole the Destroyed Bible was not a man, but in fact… a woman?”

And then, Han Sen looked at the Feather woman. If the traitor was a woman, then the Feather woman really did seem suspicious. She was all alone, after all.

As he looked at her, Han Sen became more and more intrigued. The woman’s presence seemed like an ordinary Feather Marquise on the surface, but when Han Sen scanned her with his Dongxuan Aura, her aura seemed like nothing more than a disguise. That woman’s presence actually ran really deep. It possessed a depth Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura could not even reach.

“Is she the real traitor of the Destroyed?” Han Sen guessed.
