<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A white light exploded amidst the horde of ants. A mushroom
cloud was generated, and it rocked the entire cavern.</p>
<p>Announcements played in Han Sen’s head, over and over, countless
times. Han Sen heard himself receive two Jade Ant beast souls. They
slid into his Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>“Awesome!” Han Sen felt great. He hadn’t felt like this in a
long time.</p>
<p>The Sky fellow stopped and stared in shock. He was frozen by
what he had just witnessed.</p>
<p>Spell fired another rocket, and it landed amidst the Jade Ants.
Countless more died, and roasted corpses were scattered all
about.</p>
<p>“Damn! Your gear is powerful.” The man came running back. He
looked at Spell as he spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. It’s strong, but I’m also just lucky,” Han Sen
said smarmily.</p>
<p>Spell required three seconds to generate a rocket after each
use, but after firing three or four of them consecutively, the Jade
Ants that were still alive retreated back into the tunnel and did
not return.</p>
<p>The guy didn’t object to what Han Sen said. He thought it made
fine sense. But he still looked at Spell with hefty interest, and
said, “My name is Yu Jing. What is yours?”</p>
<p>“Han Sen,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>You are the Han Sen that was carried into Sky Palace by Uncle
Crane?” Yu Jing asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders. What could he say?</p>
<p>You look different from the stories I’ve heard, and your geno
armament is strong,” Yu Jing said.</p>
<p>“I see you are an Earl, so why are you calling Thousand Feather
Crane an uncle?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Yu Jing smiled. “Uncle Crane is a student of the tenth leader. I
am the sixth elder’s student’s student. I’m more like a grandson,
to be honest. At the very least, I should call him uncle.”</p>
<p>After that, Yu Jing went on to say, “Han Sen, are you interested
in co-operating with me?”</p>
<p>“No,” Han Sen said immediately.</p>
<p>Yu Jing was disappointed. After a while, he said, “Don’t you at
least want to hear my proposal?”</p>
<p>“No thanks,” Han Sen said. Then he walked towards the Jade Ants
that were killed. He was going to collect their xenogeneic
genes.</p>
<p>Yu Jing understood, but his face turned red. He couldn’t keep
himself from explaining, so he said, “Brother Han, it isn’t like
that! I can deal with Viscount Jade Ants. The reason I ran was
because there is an Earl inside there, and it is a mutant ant
queen. So, I had to run!”</p>
<p>“A mutant ant queen?” When Han Sen heard this, his eyes opened
wide.</p>
<p>Han Sen had received Xuanyuan Dragon’s xenogeneic gene, but he
had been unable to absorb it. He wanted to understand what the
difference between ordinary genes and mutated genes were. If he
could get his hands on an Earl mutant gene, he might just be able
to figure it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was unlucky! I found a jade fruit tree, and just as I
was about to claim some jade fruit for myself, I was started to see
a Jade Ant nest right next to it. I was unable to collect the
fruit, and I almost died. I used everything I had—every item I
owned—to keep myself alive. I lost everything on this excursion.”
Yu Jing sighed.</p>
<p>And then, Yu Jing suddenly smiled at Han Sen. “Brother, I think
you are so strong. You must be a hero! Why don’t you and I go
collect the jade fruit and split the haul between us?”</p>
<p>“No offense, but why can’t I just go there by myself right now?”
Han Sen smiled at Yu Jing.</p>
<p>Yu Jing smiled, but it quivered with a touch of nervousness. He
responded, “Brother Han, you have only been in Sky Palace for a few
days! You don’t know much about Xuanyuan Cave, do you? Although
Xuanyuan Island does not look big from the outside, it is very
large on the inside. Even if you were down here for a whole year,
you wouldn’t be able to explore every nook and cranny of this
realm. The cave system is complex, too, so you’d likely find
yourself lost. Without me, it is highly unlikely that you’ll find
the fruit within the next few months of searching. Do you really
want to waste your time in such a fashion?”</p>
<p>“That makes sense. Okay, we’ll split the haul of fruit in half,”
Han Sen said as he dug through the corpses of the Jade Ants.</p>
<p>The rocket had been too powerful, and the Jade Ants were only
Viscounts. Most had been blown to smithereens, to such an extent
that the xenogeneic genes were utterly annihilated. When he was
done, Han Sen had only been able to collect a dozen xenogeneic
genes.</p>
<p>Yu Jing was so happy to hear this, and he said, “Brother Han,
you won’t regret co-operating with me! Can your geno armament
destroy an Earl Jade Ant?”</p>
<p>Han Sen searched around for a few more Jade Ants that had not
been destroyed, and then went in search for the jade fruit tree
with Yu Jing.</p>
<p>Truthfully, Han Sen’s goal in this venture was not anything that
rested on the boughs of the tree. Any fruit he collected would be a
decent bonus. What he wanted to do the most was kill that Jade Ant
Queen.</p>
<p>Yu Jing was not lying. The jade fruit tree’s location was
well-hidden. They traversed a number of complex tunnels for over an
hour before finding it. The tree was behind a hidden alcove and
cave.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, do you see the rock beside the tree? That is the
exit of the ant nest. If we get too close, the ants will come
pouring out. I examined it earlier, and there were at least eight
Earl Jade Ants. There was also an ant queen. What are you going to
do?” Yu Jing looked worried. He was afraid Han Sen would back
out.</p>
<p>“We have a deal, don’t we? We split the haul of fruit in half,
and the Jade Ant xenogeneic genes are for me,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Yu Jing immediately said, “Yes. It does not matter who kills it;
you can have the xenogeneic genes.”</p>
<p>Yu Jing said that, but inside he thought, “The Mutant Jade Ant
Queen? That thing is as strong as a Marquise. With seven or eight
Earls alongside it, and the other ants too, I think you’ll end up
running off without laying claim to a single xenogeneic gene.”</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s the deal then. You go over there,” Han Sen said
coldly.</p>
<p>“I go? How?” Yu Jing asked with shock.</p>
<p>“Walk there. You can fly or crawl, if you so prefer. Just go
over and draw those ants out.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Draw them out? Your plan is to draw them out, kill them, and
collect the fruit?” Yu Jing looked at Han Sen queerly.</p>
<p>“Do you have a better idea?” Han Sen smiled at Yu Jing.</p>
<p>It was easy for Han Sen to collect jade fruit. With Han Sen’s
rabbit shoes, he could pick the tree clean before the ants even
emerged.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wasn’t there for just the fruit. Picking it and then
leaving was not on the agenda.</p>
