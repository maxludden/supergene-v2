<p>“They are my personal guards,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>So far, they only had Deep Blue Viscount’s word that the lotus
roots could suppress the mark. Until it was confirmed, Han Sen
wasn’t willing to let Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng take any
risks.</p>
<p>Captain Wood frowned and said, “This is dangerous. It is best to
get this done as soon as possible. You should get over there and
start digging.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Captain Wood and said, “In that case, why
don’t you guys go and dig, as well? You are guards, too, isn’t that
right?”</p>
<p>“How dare you! You cannot compare us to them!” exclaimed an
infuriated Marquise.</p>
<p>Captain Wood looked at Han Sen darkly and said, “They are
guards, but they have a different master.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood Captain Wood, but he didn’t change his mind
about anything. He said, “It is different, but I think mine are
more important than you are. Dig it up if you want, but I will
distribute the work of my people how I choose to.”</p>
<p>Captain Wood looked glum, but Black Steel chimed in to say,
“Captain Wood, this is Han Sen’s place. And they are indeed his
people to command. Please watch your tone.”</p>
<p>“Little Master, we are responsible for this. This is about the
safety of the Rebate and Narrow Moon as a whole. I have to take
charge of this situation,” Captain Wood coldly said. He didn’t care
too much for Black Steel, either.</p>
<p>But Black Steel then frowned, and he said, “Captain Wood, this
entire operation is my responsibility.”</p>
<p>“Master says that you still too young. When this is a matter
that concerns the entire Rebate, I am to be the one who takes care
of it. Please understand this.” Captain Wood bowed down in respect
to Black Steel, but he obviously wasn’t willing to relinquish his
authority in this scenario.</p>
<p>“If things are indeed like that, then we will go our separate
ways.” Han Sen then took off, going in a different direction.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do things however I say we’re going to do them.
Without my explicit order, no one here works alone. If they do, I
will kill them.” Captain Wood spoke, as the Marquise swooped
forward to block Han Sen’s passage.</p>
<p>“Wood Duke!” Black Steel looked extremely grim.</p>
<p>“Please forgive me, Little Master. This is an important time.”
Captain Wood and a few of the Marquise bowed to Black Steel. But
even so, they still held their knives to Han Sen.</p>
<p>You guys stay here and do not run off. Otherwdse, don’t blame me
for what happens next.” Because of Black Steel, Captain Wood did
not force Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng to dig.</p>
<p>The flowers were soft, and the excavation work was not
difficult. The Barons were able to dig up a lot of lotus roots.
They were as white as jade and as thick as a baby’s arm. The
dusting of dirt that remained on them made them look strong and
nutritious.</p>
<p>When the lotuses were handed up, Captain Wood pointed at them
and asked Deep Blue Viscount, “Were these the lotus roots that you
ate?”</p>
<p>“Yep, these are the ones.” Deep Blue Viscount nodded.</p>
<p>“You! Come here and eat this,” Deep Blue Viscount told one of
the Barons. He cut off a small slice of the root for him to
eat.</p>
<p>The Baron was shocked and scared at the same time. He was the
only one who had been given permission to eat it, and yet he
hesitated.</p>
<p>“Eat!” Captain Wood coldly looked at the Baron. The Baron
stopped hesitating and did as requested; he started to eat the
piece of root.</p>
<p>The lotus root was very crunchy, and a pleasant scent wafted
from it.</p>
<p>The Baron took a small bite at first. No one knew if it was
working, but it didn’t seem to be hurting the Baron, either.</p>
<p>He finished it off with a big bite.</p>
<p>The other Nobles looked at him. Nothing happened after he ate
it, and the egg mark was still present.</p>
<p>Captain Wood kept his eyes fixed on the Baron, and after a
while, the Baron’s face turned green. It looked like the Baron was
freezing. He held himself, shaking and shivering. “Cold! I am so
cold!”</p>
<p>“Deep Blue Viscount, what is going on?” Captain Wood looked at
Deep Blue Viscount.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount looked happy, though. And he explained, “Yes,
this is it. When I first ate it, I felt cold, too. He’ll be fine in
a second, you’ll see.”</p>
<p>“How long precisely?” Captain Wood asked.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have any way of recording time when I first ate it.
Maybe ten minutes?” Deep Blue Viscount said, after a minute of
thought.</p>
<p>Captain Wood did not say anything more, and he just waited for
the results.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the Baron’s chill began to subside, and he
started to look better. The egg shape on his forehead became
lighter. It had become just a mere shading on his forehead now.</p>
<p>Hurry and dig the rest of them up!” Captain Wood chided
them.</p>
<p>A group of Barons dug the roots out for two hours, and when they
were done, they managed to collect a thousand kilograms of the
stuff. Captain Wood took some, and gave the rest to the Barons. He
didn’t let them eat it just yet, though.</p>
<p>“Mister Wood, can I have some of the lotus now, please?” Deep
Blue Viscount carefully asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, there are many of them. Once this is done, you are
free to have them. Now, take me to where Chiron Earl found the
egg,” Captain Wood said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount’s face changed. He didn’t want to go, but he
had to lead.</p>
<p>“This guy is here for an ulterior purpose. He is not just here
to remove the threat of the Ravens on our heads.” Gu Qingcheng
moved her lips to speak quietly. Only Han Sen heard her say it.</p>
<p>Han Sen sucked at whispering, so he just nodded in response. He
could tell Captain Wood had not come here for the lotuses. He was
taking the operation far too seriously, and it was obvious that the
object of their pursuit was something bigger.</p>
<p>“They take their orders from Black-Moon King. If this item is
that precious, why didn’t he come here himself? Or is it really
just because it isn’t that important, after all?” Xie Qing King
said.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King was the master of whispering. Only Han Sen and Gu
Qingcheng could hear what he had said.</p>
<p>“It looks like little tricks like that are useful,” Han Sen felt
depressed. He hadn’t learned anything about the powers of sound. If
he had, he might not have had to be a mute in that situation.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng said, “No, it’s the opposite. Black-Moon King not
coming means the item is worth even more than we can imagine. If he
came, other kings would notice and pay attention to what is
happening here. This is Narrow Moon, and it would be suspicious for
him to come to Planet Eclipse. Why would he go to Han Sen’s planet?
If other kings found out about his venture here, he might not be
able to claim the item he desires.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Xie Qing King nodded, thinking what she said had made
perfect sense. Then he said, “What is the item?”</p>
<p>“We need to ask Captain Wood. He is the only one who knows
something about what we’re doing. Black Steel doesn’t know what’s
going on, and neither do the four Marquise,” Gu Qingcheng said
quietly.</p>
