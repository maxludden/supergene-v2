    <p>
      Seeing that woman, who was as cold as a monarch, Han Sen did not move. His
      very heart had been rocked with surprise and he thought to himself,
      &#8220;This is too much of a Dollarcidence. Despite the countless other
      humans and spirits here, I am put against her?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen looked at Han Sen, then kicked towards him with her long legs like
      the throw of an axe. Queen did not care who her opponent was; she had no
      idea she was up against Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen waved his fist, and after doing so, Queen&#8217;s face
      changed. Her legs canceled their attack and pulled to the side in evasion.
      When she neared Han Sen, she raised her fist and attempted to punch him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen raised his elbow and pushed away Queen&#8217;s incoming fist, as
      his left hand swung towards her waist.
    </p>

    <p>
      They both engaged in very close-quarter combat. Their attacks,
      deflections, dodges, and parries came thick and fast, and the eyes of the
      audience could barely follow the speed at which they fought. By the time
      they could admire one move, another ten had been performed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crowd became cross-eyed, and it was like they were witnessing the
      fight of two rabid monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who is this woman? She is so cool; she can actually go toe-to-toe
      with Dollar!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I did not expect to ever see a woman evolver be so powerful.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This woman is amazing. Her body and general appearance are divine,
      and her strength is incredible.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;She is like a goddess. This Huangfu Jing&#8230; she cannot be from
      the Ares Martial Hall&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      Many evolvers did not know who Queen was, but witnessing this fight, they
      quickly started to admire her.
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the people who knew Queen, they were more surprised that Dollar
      was able to fight her. Queen was a master of close-quarter combat. She was
      regarded as nearly invincible by her peers, in part due to her knowledge
      of Heavenly Go. The combination of Heavenly Go and superb close-quarter
      combat abilities made most fights a breeze for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, people were surprised Dollar was able to fight Queen. The
      punching skills Han Sen used surprised people even more, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Can Elephant-Disc Punch beat Heavenly Go?&#8221; Many people had
      recognized Han Sen&#8217;s skill, Elephant-Disc Punch. After all, it was a
      fairly common hyper geno art. Of course, they never expected the skill
      could stand up to Heavenly Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before this day, if someone had been told Elephant-Disc Punch could
      compete with Heavenly Go, they&#8217;d have been laughed out of the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there he was; Han Sen was using Elephant-Disc Punch to repel
      Queen&#8217;s Heavenly Go with no sign of being at a disadvantage. And
      now, people began to think Heavenly Go wasn&#8217;t as effective as they
      had previously been led to believe.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy crap! Dollar is using Elephant-Disc Punch; I know this skill
      myself! Why can&#8217;t I use it as good as him?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah, if he can use that skill to this level of effectiveness, he
      might as well be a god.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      It didn&#8217;t take long for people to recognize the skill Han Sen used
      was Elephant-Disc Punch. After all, it was very common and many people had
      learnt it due to the affordability of A-class hyper geno arts. It was
      frequently considered a must-have skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it shocked them to see Dollar cast the very same skill with such a
      terrifying amount of power.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have known Elephant-Disc Punch for many years; how have I been
      unable to notice how much power this skill can actually discharge?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Skills are still dependent on their caster, mind you. In
      Dollar&#8217;s hand, it is like an invincible hand of death. In your
      hand&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is a shame I can&#8217;t record these fights. If I could,
      I&#8217;d watch them over and over in an attempt to learn Dollar&#8217;s
      trick.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s strange. Is Dollar really using the same Elephant-Disc
      Punch you and I use? It looks similar, yes&#8230; but it has a certain
      element of strangeness to it.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t just the ordinary folk who viewed this skill with such
      bewilderment. Wang Yuhang was just as shocked as the rest. Everyone knew
      the battle between Queen and Dollar would be quite the spectacle, but no
      one expected Dollar would be able to repel Heavenly Go with such a common
      skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this guy human? How can he do this?&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s
      eyes were opened wide.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollar is Dollar. The word &#8216;freaking awesome&#8217; is what
      we can use,&#8221; Teng Zhen Liu said in praise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Teng, that&#8217;s two words.&#8221; The comrade beside him
      looked at Teng Zhen Liu, confused.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He is awesome, awesome is him. The word freaking can be ignored, so
      it&#8217;s just one word,&#8221; said Teng Zhen Liu.
    </p>

    <p>The comrade acknowledged that with a sudden, &#8220;Ah, I see.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Queen was shocked just as much. She knew exactly what kind of skill
      Elephant-Disc Punch was, despite not having learnt it herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was shocked to see her opponent using such a regular skill and still
      keeping up with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Queen was Queen, and she didn&#8217;t let the surprise put her at a
      disadvantage. She didn&#8217;t care about which skill he used against her,
      all she wanted to do was win.
    </p>

    <p>
      This fight was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. It amazed each
      and every spectator, and even Hua Ping. When he saw the name Huangfu Jing,
      he only expected it to be an ordinary human. As such, he cared little for
      the fight&#8217;s potential significance.
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not expect Huangfu Jing to be a person of such strength, let alone
      that she would come the closest to matching Dollar&#8217;s power so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping thought Dollar was the strongest evolver in existence, but he
      never expected there to be a woman who could achieve such power.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is good. So, after all this time, humanity hasn&#8217;t been
      resting on its laurels. The younger generation has followed in the
      footsteps of their predecessors, taking the abilities of their forefathers
      forward with greater strength. They are stepping up, and it now seems more
      possible than ever for humanity to claim a pedestal and be deemed a Son of
      God.&#8221; Hua Ping was overjoyed to see so many excellent young people
      stepping up to the plate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fan Mingquan was excited to see this, as well. He didn&#8217;t know such a
      powerful female existed, and that she could do so well in combat against
      Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>His fists were like an elephant and hers were like a battle axe.</p>

    <p>
      The fight between Han Sen and Queen looked nuts, and it didn&#8217;t seem
      like either one had a clear advantage. The audience was so thrilled, they
      wished they could take part.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen admired Queen. He didn&#8217;t use all his energy as he did while
      casting Elephant-Rex Strike, but he used the most he could with
      Elephant-Disc Punch. He was able to suppress Queen well-enough, but he
      could not beat her.
    </p>

    <p>
      This woman&#8217;s Heavenly Go was already at a scary level, so unless Han
      Sen had much greater strength and speed, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to beat
      her outright.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew he could not beat her, if he maintained this status quo. The
      best he could hope for right now was Queen exhausting all her energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he fought for his life, Han Sen might win. But he didn&#8217;t want to
      kill her, nor did he want to spend too much energy. So, Han Sen suddenly
      stopped. He let Queen&#8217;s battle-axe leg, which was currently being
      driven at his head, carry on its approach and did not dodge.
