<p>Bao Ying stayed in the garden for some time. She read about manners to Han Sen, but it was more like she was reading a book.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt a little strange about it. No matter how strong the Extreme King was, he did not think they were strong enough to use deified elites for a maid. A maid like Bao Ying was being treated as a usual servant.</p>

<p>Plus, Bao Ying must have come from Bao King&#8217;s faction. If that was true, there was no way she was a mere maid. Although Bao King&#8217;s faction did not control the government, no matter what happened, the deifieds of Bao King&#8217;s faction would never be treated so poorly as to be made lowly maids and waiters.</p>

<p>It seems as if people like Bao Ying have a big story behind them. Han Sen was not interested in Bao Ying&#8217;s secrets. He kept her there because there might be a time when he needed people to read him stories about the Extreme King.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Han Sen was in the dark. He did not know who was who and knew there would be many weird things there.</p>

<p>Han Sen wanted to find a chance to ask Bai King. He wanted to precisely know what the Nine-Defense Palace was, but he had completely eaten the Black Demon Ape&#8217;s body. During that time, he had not been able to see hide nor hair of Bai King.</p>

<p>If he does not explain it, he cannot take it out on me for eating all of his xenogeneics. Han Sen was unable to see Bai King, so he went back to the Nine-Defense Palace. He was planning to kill more deified xenogeneics there to fill up his deified gene tallies to reach larvae class.</p>

<p>After going back to the Nine-Defense Palace, he returned to the last door he visited. He went back to the place where there were lots of palaces.</p>

<p>He skipped a few of the palaces in front of him. He started from number 0006. The next few palaces were empty. They were empty up to palace 0013. Han Sen found a xenogeneic inside there that was locked up.</p>

<p>This time, the palace contained more than one xenogeneic. Han Sen saw four xenogeneics that were exactly the same. They were all locked up in the same palace.</p>

<p>It was a xenogeneic that looked like a dog and a wolf. Its body had shiny blue fur, but its eyes were red. Han Sen had only just entered the palace when the four xenogeneics revealed their fangs and angrily barked at Han Sen.</p>

<p>The substance chains on their bodies lit up, but the powers of the palace quickly suppressed them. They only looked mean, and that was it.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw that they did not possess much power. They were only primitive, so he quit hesitating and summoned his beast souls. He fired at one of the blue fur wolves.</p>

<p>The sharp arrow pierced through the blue-furred wolves' head and instantly killed it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Xenogeneic Deified Hunted. Sky Star Wolf: Xenogeneic Deified Gene Found. Obtained Sky Star Wolf Deified Beast Soul.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Han Sen heard the announcement in his head. He received a beast soul out of his latest kill, and it overjoyed him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why the Extreme King&#8217;s king brings the xenogeneics here. Some of them are strong, and some of them are weak. They are all different. There are no standardized rules between them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the other three Sky Star Wolves that barked at him and fired an arrow at each of them. He killed his second Sky Star Wolf.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Xenogeneic Deified Hunted. Sky Star Wolf: Xenogeneic Deified Gene Found. Obtained Sky Star Wolf Deified Beast Soul.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another beast soul? Today, I am lucky. I have received two deified beast souls. Han Sen felt so lucky that he could not believe it.</p>

<p>When Han Sen fired at the third Sky Star Wolf, he received another deified beast soul.</p>

<p>Holy shit! What is going on? My luck is so strong today. I keep getting deified beast souls. This is harder than winning the lottery. The last one surely won&#8217;t give me another beast soul. While Han Sen was thinking, he fired an arrow at the last Sky Star Wolf.</p>

<p>In the next moment, he was unable to believe what he heard. He received another deified beast soul.</p>

<p>Oh, my god! What has happened today? Did I just use up all the luck I will have for the rest of my life in this one day? After thinking that, Han Sen went to examine the Sky Star Wolf&#8217;s beast souls.</p>

<div class="tables">
	<table class="beast">
		<tr>
			<th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
		</tr><tr>
			<td>Deified Class Sky Star Wolf</td>
			<td>(Glyph)</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<th class="note" colspan="2">Note: Broken</th>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<!-- Deified beast soul Sky Star Wolf: glyph-type (broken) -->
</div> 

<p>Han Sen took a look at them. The four Sky Star Wolf beast souls were all broken glyph beast souls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four broken beast souls. I do not know if I can make a complete beast soul out of them,&#8221; Han Sen said to himself. But those four Sky Star Wolf beast souls were able to be combined.</p>

<p>Four blue lights melded. They quickly came together to create a giant, scary Sky Star Wolf. Its presence was much stronger.</p>

<p>Holy shit! They really can be combined! Han Sen was frozen. He hastily had a look at the Sky Star Wolf&#8217;s information after it combined.</p>

<div class="tables">
	<table class="beast">
		<tr>
			<th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
		</tr><tr>
			<td>Deified Class Sky Star Wolf</td>
			<td>(Glyph)</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<th class="note" colspan="2">Note: Broken</th>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<!-- Deified beast soul Sky Star Wolf: glyph-type (broken) -->
</div> 

<p>Why is it still broken? Han Sen felt strange, so he hesitated. He summoned the Sky Star Wolf beast soul.</p>

<p>He immediately saw the shape of a blue and angry wolf manifest. It started to become a tattoo of a wolf on Han Sen&#8217;s body. It made his whole back gleam with the tattoo of a cruel and menacing blue wolf.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt his body possess a lot of scary power. It was as if he had been connected to the sky and the stars. It was like every star in the universe had a connection to him.</p>

<p>This is an extremely powerful power! Han Sen felt the power of his body madly increase. The tattoo&#8217;s power was more than when he used his Peacock King soul clothing, Six Core Snake Bow, and Red Blood Demon shapeshifting beast soul.</p>

<p>Weird. The power of the Sky Star Wolf beast soul is so strong. It must have reached the transmutation level. No, it could already be larva level. But the Sky Star Wolf power is not strong. It is a weaker fiend for the primitive class, but the beast souls they give are so strong because four of them were able to combine. Han Sen was shocked.</p>

<p>That means broken beast souls can be combined. So, Tianxia Peacock King beast souls should be able to be combined too. But where do I find another Tianxia Peacock King beast soul? Han Sen thought the chances of getting another Tianxia Peacock King beast soul were too low.</p>

<p>The four Sky Star Wolf xenogeneic genes provided Han Sen enough to eat for a while. Plus, he had received Sky Star Wolf beast souls. Han Sen was quite happy.</p>

<p>Han Sen took the four wolf bodies back to the palace with him. He had only just reached the garden when he saw Bao Ying there waiting for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bao Ying, you do not have to work that hard,&#8221; Han Sen said with a laugh.</p>

<p>Bao Ying shook her head and said, &#8220;Mister Holy Baby, I am here to say goodbye to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Does the queen want you back?&#8221; Han Sen raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Bao Ying shook her head. &#8220;Han Sen killed an Extreme King deified in the Real Old System. The king is so angry that he sent a few deifieds to the Real Old System to kill Han Sen. I am one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Han Sen&#8230; He killed an Extreme King deified in Real Old System?&#8221; Han Sen was frozen. He was right there and had never heard of the Real Old System before. How could he kill an Extreme King deified elite there?&quot;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you might not understand. This Han Sen is a rival of the Extreme King. I have heard the Very High are in search of him as well.&#8221; Bao Ying explained what had happened to him.</p>

<p>Han Sen&#8217;s face got a lot more excited the more he heard. Whatever Bao Ying told him, though, he had never done.</p>
