<p>Back in the geno universe, Ling’er sat upon a stool in Space
Garden. She placed her hands up against her jaw to cradle it and
stared up into the sky to daydream. “Little Ling’er, did you miss
Brother Yuhang?” A man approached her with a smile on his face. He
smiled at Ling’er.</p>
<p>“Grandad Yuhang! You have come back so quickly.” Ling’er looked
at Wang Yuhang with surprise.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang’s face looked dim. “I told you that you should call
me Brother Yuhang. You are still calling me a grandad. Am I really
that old?”</p>
<p>“But they say my father called you an uncle,” Ling’er said with
a blink of her eyes.</p>
<p>“We are not related, so it does not matter,” Wang Yuhang said.
“Our relationship has nothing to do with them. You should just keep
calling me Brother Yuhang.” “By the way, is Littleflower here?
Where is he?” Wang Yuhang asked. “Brother Littleflower is with Big
Sister Meng’er, Big Sister Zero, and Big Sister Little Sky,”
Ling’er explained. “They have gone to Outer Sky. They heard Mirror
Lake has something new going on there.”</p>
<p>“That is fantastic that they found something new,” Wang Yuhang
said as he rubbed his fists. “I cannot wait to go to the
anti-material world. I want to see how Han Sen is doing.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Wang Yuhang readied himself to leave Space
Garden. He was going to go to Mirror Lake. After taking two steps,
a hand grabbed his sleeves.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yuhang, can you take me to Outer Sky? I want to go
see Mirror Lake as well.” Ling’er looked at Wang Yuhang with a
pity-filled face.</p>
<p>“No way,” Wang Yuhang said with a shake of his head. “You are
too small. It is too dangerous for you to go over there.” He did
not want to take this princess to such a place.</p>
<p>If something happened to her, all the creatures of Space Garden
would want to bite a chunk out of him.</p>
<p>“Brother Yuhang, are you not going to bring me?” Ling’er looked
at Wang Yuhang with sadness in her eyes and blinked.</p>
<p>“Cough. Cough. I really am busy. I don’t have the time for that.
Now, please put me down.” Wang Yuhang struggled with his words and
his body. Nothing he tried could help him escape. It was like an
invisible rope had tied him up.</p>
<p>“Take me or stay here and play with me,” Ling’er said with a
smile.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang looked angry and asked, “Little Ling’er, how could
you do something like this to me? I am your grandad, Yuhang. Did
your mother not teach you to respect your elders? Ling’er is
supposed to be a good child, so stop messing about and put me
down.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my mother taught me to respect elders, but you said you
are Brother Yuhang and not Grandad Yuhang,” Ling’er said as she
blinked her eyes.</p>
<p>“Fine! Fine! Fine! I will play with you. What would you like to
play? Big Brother Yuhang is going to play.” Wang Yuhang was very
angry, but he could not fight back. He had to blame himself for
being stupid earlier. “Let’s play your favorite game, Little Six,
shall we?” Ling’er clapped her hands. The Six-Ear Macaque came
running over. It ran right in front of her.</p>
<p>After hearing Ling’er’s words, the Six-Ear Macaque’s eyes were
bright as it looked at Wang Yuhang</p>
<p>“What do you want? Don’t come any closer!” Wang Yuhang looked at
the Six-Ear Macaque, which did not look nice. It felt as if
something was wrong. He felt very bad.</p>
<p>Not many people were at Outer Sky’s Mirror Lake, but a giant
laboratory had been built there.</p>
<p>Many people were seriously examining the screen inside the
building. Many people were controlling all sorts of tools.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King could not help but ask, “Sister Yufei, what is
going on here?” She did not understand all the data streams and
what the machines were doing.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Mirror Lake had been exhibiting many
weird events. The whole Outer Sky was affected.</p>
<p>The Very High had been unable to find out why. They asked the
elites of Space Garden to help out. That was why Han Yufei had
built a lab near Mirror Lake. In fact, across the whole of Space
Garden, only Han Yufei was good at this. Everyone else was
useless.</p>
<p>Han Yufei kept looking at the data and said, “Judging from the
data and the information I am receiving, over the past three
months, the anti-material movements of Mirror Lake have become
stronger. The anti-material springs are going off more often. It
used to be once every four or five days. Now, it is happening two
or three times a day.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Xie Qing King asked.</p>
<p>“According to the data, there are two possibilities. One
possibility is that the anti-material world is undergoing some
weird changes. The buffer zone between the two worlds has been
impacted, so that is why there have been these changes.” Han Yufei
paused. She looked excited as she went on to say, “One possibility
is that there is a power breaking the barrier between the two near
Mirror Lake.”</p>
<p>When everyone heard that, their faces changed. Someone happily
asked, “Is Big Brother coming back from the anti-material
world?”</p>
<p>Han Yufei shook her head. “According to the information given to
us by the Very High, this movement already existed, but it was weak
and did not affect anywhere else in Outer Sky. Therefore, no one
gave it any attention. I am sure that it has not been going on just
in the past few years. So, it probably isn’t Han Sen.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean those creatures in the anti-material world are
going to try and break through Mirror Lake and enter our world?”
Xie Qing King asked with shock.</p>
<p>“So far, that is the most plausible theory,” Han Yufei replied.
“If the veil is broken, what might happen?” Xie Qing King asked
with a serious look of concern.</p>
<p>“I do not know,” Han Yufei said with her eyes glowing. “The one
thing I do know for sure is that when the two worlds are connected,
we can feel the power of the two worlds straight away. Perhaps we
can be our race’s elite Tai Yi and have the two world powers to
become break world elites.”</p>
<p>Xie Qing King’s eyes glistened as he asked Han Yufei, “What kind
of power is a Break World power?”</p>
<p>Ever since the geno hall battle, the geno universe had undergone
many big changes. All the resources grew like crazy. Many people
were able to level up and develop at a much faster rate. Xie Qing
King had already reached the max god level. He could not go any
higher.</p>
<p>He also did not want to be a God Spirit, so he stopped, unable
to improve himself any further.</p>
<p>“I have not reached that level yet, so I do not know the proper
details.” Han Yufei seemed to grow more excited as she said, “I
only know that putting the main and second world powers into one,
for the Witch, was something only Tai Yi managed to achieve. The
reason why achieving Break World is hard is because we cannot feel
the powers of the other world. If Mirror Lake is broken, we will be
able to immediately feel the powers of the anti-material. That
means breaking the world will be much easier.”</p>
