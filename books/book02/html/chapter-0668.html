    <p>
      Hui Haifeng accepted Han Sen&#8217;s friend request. He sent a message,
      asking, &#8220;What was that skill called?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen contemplated his answer for a minute, and then replied,
      &#8220;Elephant-Rex Strike.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wasn&#8217;t very talented when it came to naming things. For this
      name, he used the most basic of naming-rules. He took one word from each
      component of the skill; one word from the Flaming Rex Spike and one word
      from the bone elephant, whose power he had simulated.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That was a very good Elephant-Rex Strike. It really does have the
      power of an elephant and T-rex.&#8221; Hui Haifeng then went on to ask,
      &#8220;Are you an old soldier?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221; Han Sen had been in the army for a year, so he
      thought that qualified for an &#8220;old soldier.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Poor Han Sen, he didn&#8217;t know the true meaning of &#8220;old
      soldier.&#8221; With Hui Haifeng already suspecting he may have been one,
      this &#8220;confirmation&#8221; led to no further suspicions on his
      behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you want to practice with that strange weapon of yours?&#8221;
      Hui Haifeng asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I do. I managed to get my hands on this berserk sacred-blood
      beast soul, and I want to become proficient with it. Unfortunately, I have
      been unable to find or formulate the correct skills to go with it,&#8221;
      Han Sen answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Berserk sacred-blood weapon, you say? That is lucky. It&#8217;s a
      unique weapon, so perhaps you can create your own special skills for it.
      Come, let us practice once more!&#8221; Hui Haifeng invited Han Sen into
      another match.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, I appreciate it. But I cannot do this again. That
      Elephant-Rex Strike cost me my entire reserve of energy, and I can&#8217;t
      convoke it all back so easily. My bones are pretty brittle right
      now,&#8221; Han Sen said. Although things weren&#8217;t as bad as he made
      them out to be, he was pretty drained. He would be at a disadvantage right
      from the start, so there was no way it would yield decent training
      results.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;ve added each other as friends now. If
      you ever want to train, just hit me up,&#8221; Hui Haifeng happily
      responded.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sure to. Thanks a lot,&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We are battle-buddies; you are welcome. I am interested in your
      weapon,&#8221; Hui Haifeng said.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen exited the virtual training camp, his mind kept drifting off
      to the bone elephant&#8217;s Qi Gong.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the Dongxuan Sutra could simulate elements of a Qi Gong, did that mean
      he could simulate the Qi Gong of the black bear, silver fox, or even the
      weird gourd he owned?
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking of this, Han Sen was pretty excited at the prospect. The bone
      elephant&#8217;s energy possessed a raw, wretchedly kinetic power. He
      wondered what might occur if he were to simulate the Qi Gong of other
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I simulate the silver fox&#8217;s energy, does that mean I would
      be able to cast lightning?&#8221; Han Sen was leaping at the thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it worked as he had theorized, Han Sen believed that he had just hit
      the jackpot. If he could simulate the Qi Gong of the children of super
      creatures, he could do whatever he wanted. He would become indestructible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amidst this excitement, he tried to simulate the silver fox&#8217;s Qi
      Gong. Although he could feel his power increase under the simulation, no
      lightning manifested.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Strange. Where&#8217;s the lightning? If I can simulate it,
      where&#8217;s the snap and crackle of electricity?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen thought about it, he came up with an idea. &#8220;It must be
      because I haven&#8217;t finished the first tier of the Dongxuan Sutra.
      Perhaps I cannot summon elemental powers because I have not unlocked the
      first gene lock.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it was just a guess, it was most likely the truth. Therefore, Han
      Sen&#8217;s desire to finish the first tier of the Dongxuan Sutra
      increased. And he hoped to do it so he could see whether or not he could
      summon elemental powers once it was done.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen&#8217;s Dongxuan Sutra had reached some sort of soft cap.
      After the rapid acceleration he had gained during his time underneath the
      peach tree, not much progress had been made since. If he could get over
      his current slump, he might be able to break the first tier.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The peach flower&#8217;s smell increased my progress with the
      Dongxuan Sutra by a lot. If I can nab one of the peaches from that tree,
      perhaps I can unlock the first tier.&#8221; Han Sen was now deep in
      thought, pondering that wondrous tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      But thinking about it further, it would take another few months before
      peaches started to bloom there. It&#8217;d be a while before he could eat
      one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen rested the following day and later met up with Hui Haifeng again
      in the training camp. Han Sen asked him if he was available to help him
      train, and Hui Haifeng quickly agreed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gathered a great many ideas from his observations of Hui
      Haifeng&#8217;s skills, but his spear skills required the support of a
      hyper geno art and therefore, Han Sen could not copy the skills fully.
      Still, he was able to make great changes to the Toxic-Dragon Drill. Its
      power was far more pronounced than what it was previously, and it suited
      the Flaming Rex Spike far better than it previously did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the next few days, Han Sen spent his time practicing with his rex
      spike and honing his skills with it. But now, he thought it was time to
      ask around and follow up on leads for locating a solo super creature. For
      this, there were a few preparations he wanted to take care of first.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen fed a black crystal to the Deadeye Peacock, it&#8217;d take a
      month for the evolution process to complete. He believed its strength
      would be delivered a great boon, however. The bolts he fired would be
      faster and stronger, and prove to be of great aid in his future hunting of
      super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen exited the virtual camp, his communicator rang. It was a
      strange number that was dialing him; one which made him furrow his
      eyebrows. It was a communicator given to him by the military. Ordinary
      people could not call it, so whoever was calling him had to be from the
      inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      He accepted the call and the image displayed gave Han Sen a shock; it was
      Li Xinglun.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why are you looking at me with such surprise? I am a high-level
      hacker, and breaking your defensive systems is easy-peasy lemon-squeezy.
      Finding your information was effortless,&#8221; Li Xinglun said, with a
      smug expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then you should know that these calls are monitored, yes?&#8221;
      Han Sen responded, with a wry smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If that concerned me, what kind of hacker would I be? Don&#8217;t
      worry; no one can see us talking. No one will even know you were on your
      communicator,&#8221; Li Xinglun said, with much confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can look for me in the shelter, so why are you going to such
      lengths just to talk with me?&#8221; Han Shen shrugged his shoulders, not
      comfortable doing something that was against the law.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen believed that if you kept your nose out of trouble, then no
      trouble would come to you. Illegal deeds were never wholly invisible, and
      there was always a trace that could be followed up on. Li Xinglun had
      never seen a better hacker.
    </p>

    <p>Therefore, he believed himself to be the best.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m contacting you because it&#8217;s an emergency. You
      haven&#8217;t been in the shelter for the past few days, so this was the
      only way I was able to get in touch with you,&#8221; Li Xinglun explained.
    </p>

    <p>
      But seeing his expression, it didn&#8217;t seem to be one of any
      particular concern. Han Sen didn&#8217;t quite believe it was an emergency
      that prompted this unexpected call. Hacking military systems just seemed
      like a normal thing for Li Xinglun to do, and he was in the mood to chat
      with Han Sen without the fear of others being aware.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, what happened?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have unlocked a gene lock!&#8221; Li Xinglun proclaimed, as he
      poked his own nose.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Congratulations. So?&#8221; Han Sen gave Li Xinglun a strange look,
      unable to believe the quirky fellow had hacked military systems just to
      tell him this.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I heard you have created a team to hunt down super creatures, and I
      would like to join. I know where one can be found,&#8221; Li Xinglun said.
