  Han Sen ignored the big sky demon. Although he was very tempted by her offer, if the big sky demon wanted to encourage him to murder, it was not so easy.

It seemed as if she could feel the object of Han Sen’s gaze. The little girl, standing next to Feng Fei Fei, looked his way. She looked at Han Sen, and the two shared a stare.

The little girl appeared shocked. She looked confused. There was a sprinkle of confusion in her beautiful eyes. After a second, the little girl ran from the crowd. She ran toward Han Sen.

Everyone’s focus was still fixed on Feng Fei Fei. No one noticed the behavior of the little girl. She quickly raced over to Han Sen and checked him out. With confusion, she asked, “Big Brother, have we met?”

Han Sen’s eyes turned very blurry. He was sure the little girl was Xiang Yin reborn.

Xiang Yin was one of Ancient Devil’s eight generals. Han Sen saw her fly in the sanctuaries, and he made a promise that they would meet again. When Han Sen ascended to the next sanctuary, he was unable to find her. He did not expect she had been reborn instead.

Han Sen looked at the little girl and replied, “No. My name is Han Sen. What is your name?”

“Feng Fei Fei is my auntie. My name is Feng Yin Yin. You can call me Little Yin.” Feng Yin Yin saw Han Sen and somehow thought he was very nice. She felt as if she wanted to get closer to him.

“You can call me San Mu,” Han Sen said.

“San Mu? Come over here. Let me show you something good.” Han Sen was no stranger to Feng Yin Yin’s voice. She pulled Han Sen by the hand and took him to a castle.

Han Sen did not decline. Bald Guy was shocked by this. He did not expect Feng Fei Fei’s niece would get along with Han Sen so well. He stood up too.

Everyone was focusing on Feng Fei Fei. No one else noticed them leave. Feng Yin Yin took Han Sen and Bald Guy through a hallway. They quickly reached a garden.

There was an old tree in the garden. The tree had many bells on it. They were like flowers, and they were like fruit. There were no leaves. When the wind blew, the tree sounded like a ringtone with rhythm. It was not too loud. It made people feel happy to hear it. Bald Guy was shocked. He pointed at the gently glowing old tree and asked, “Is that the legendary old bell god tree? Is it the legendary top-class sonic gene race?”

Feng Yin Yin laughed and nodded. “Yes, it is the old bell god tree, but it is an adult. It cannot be tamed. We moved it here to shower it with the old bell god sounds. That way, we can get sonic powers.”

After that, Feng Yin Yin pulled Han Sen to sit on the grass beneath the tree. She closed her eyes. “My auntie really loves this tree. She won’t let anyone get close, but she loves me more than anything. Only I am allowed to come here, so please don’t tell anyone that you came near here.”

“Of course.” Han Sen patted his chest.

“By the way, San Mu, where do you live? How can I find you?” Feng Yin Yin asked Han Sen.

“I have not been in the capital long. I have not yet found a stable place to live. This is my phone number. If you want to find me, you should call this number.” Han Sen gave Feng Yin Yin his phone number.

“In that case, you can stay in my house,” Feng Yin Yin happily said.

If someone else had said that, Han Sen would have rejected without thinking. But this was Feng Yin Yin, so it was hard for him to refuse. In fact, he very much wanted to talk to Feng Yin Yin more. Looking at her was more than enough.

Bald Guy looked at Han Sen weirdly and thought, “Is this guy secretly a pedophile?”

A purple-clothed woman sneakily walked out of the party. She went to a corner of the castle where no one was nearby. She sat alone in the dark.

“The things you guys wanted are here,” the purple-clothed woman said. She was like a thief, handing something over to someone.

“What took you so long?” The person in the dark accepted the item.

The purple-clothed woman said, “Feng Fei Fei is being careful. If it wasn’t a bit messy in the celebration, I would not have been able to get it. Where is my stuff?”

In the dark, the man gave the purple-clothed woman a box. He then stood up and left.

The purple-clothed woman saw the box and closed it. She carefully put it away. She felt excited and said, “With this god-class sky voice one hundred spirit bird egg, I, Si Tu Ya, will be better than Feng Fei Fei. With Feng Fei Fei’s death, there will be a slot for a new singer.”

After the man in the dark left the castle, he went back to Gong Shu Manor. The man was Gong Shu Zhi’s old servant.

“Master, I have Feng Fei Fei’s hair.” The old servant took out a strand of hair. It was contained in a glass bottle. He carefully placed it down in front of Gong Shu Zhi.

“Very good. I have finally got it.” Gong Shu Zhi picked up the hair. He looked murderous.

The God Spirit Blood-Pulse mark was flickering on Gong Shu Zhi’s forehead. A black shadow appeared in front of him. It was a bronze statue that was around the same height as the average human.

It had hair and limbs, but it did not have a face. It looked vintage and weird.

“With this hair, I can activate the si ming demon race’s power. She loves her birthday parties, so I want this little b*tch to die in front of everyone.” Gong Shu Zhi gnashed his teeth. He put the hair on the bronze statue’s empty face.

The bronze statue suddenly flickered with a weird, green light. It absorbed the hair. At the same time, the bronze statue changed. It started to display a face.

If one looked closely, one would realize the face looked like Feng Fei Fei’s.

It was not just her face. Even the body of the bronze statue started to change. Not long later, it turned into Feng Fei Fei.

“Good. Si Tu Ya did not lie to us. She got us Feng Fei Fei’s hair.” Gong Shu Zhi looked very excited. He stared at the si ming demon race, which looked just like Feng Fei Fei. His voice squeezed out from between clenched teeth. “My son, you hold on for a bit longer. The woman you liked will be keeping your company very soon.”

When Gong Shu Zhi spoke, the eyes of the bronze statue turned red. It was so spooky and weird. It was like a demon.

Feng Fei Fei noticed Feng Yin Yin was gone, so she looked for her. It was her birthday, but it was Feng Yin Yin’s birthday the next day. After midnight, it would be Feng Yin Yin’s birthday. So, she spent every birthday with Feng Yin Yin. After twelve, she would give Feng Yin Yin her

gift.

It was already almost midnight, and Feng Yin Yin was gone. Feng Fei Fei sent people to find her, but they were unable to locate her. So, she went looking for her herself.

Feng Yin Yin was in the backyard. Aside from here, there were another two people. One of them was Han Sen, who Feng Fei Fei really despised.
