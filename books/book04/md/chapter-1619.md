  “Did you go to the Alliance automatically after you entered the Fifth Sanctuary?” Han Sen couldn’t believe what he had just heard, but he couldn’t think of any other possible explanations.

Han Yufei nodded his head and then shook it “To be exact, this universe is the Fifth Sanctuary.”

Han Sen looked at Han Yufei in horror as it was completely out of his imagination. The universe was the Fifth God’s Sanctuary. It was stunning.

Humans always thought of the sanctuaries as independent realities, and they never imagined that the universe they were living in was actually a part of the sanctuaries.

Han Sen struggled to believe it, even though Han Yufei had just told him plainly.

“I know it’s kind of unbelievable, but it’s the truth. After I rose to the Fifth Sanctuary, I came to this universe. This universe is the origin of humans. It is the start, and it is also the end,” said Han Yufei calmly.

“If all the creatures who rise to the Fifth Sanctuary are living in the universe, why have we never seen them?” asked Han Sen.

“It’s kind of different than you’re imagining. The creatures who enter the Fifth Sanctuary experience radical changes when they get promoted, and the process reshapes their entire bodies. It’s like incarnation, giving you superior genes and body, and you might also gain the ability to condense a geno armor with your body. Until they can condense a geno armor, and the so-called Gods aren’t too powerful because of the reorganization of their bodies. Right after they enter the Fifth Sanctuary, some Gods might not even rival demigods. Once they condense geno armors, however, it’s a totally different story.”

When the topic turned to armors, Han Yufei stopped and said, “What you’ve seized from Tina was the geno armor left by the previous Chairman. I haven’t condensed my geno armor yet, and it will take another year or two. The previous Chairman told me that I would understand everything then.”

“Why didn’t he tell you the truth directly?” Han Sen asked, frowning.

“I also wanted to know why he didn’t just tell me.” Han Yufei shrugged his shoulders. He stood up and said, “It’ll only take a year or two, and soon I’ll know everything. Then everything will end.”

He then tapped Han Sen’s shoulders. “Take care of your mom and sister. I’ve seen Littleflower, and he’s very cute. Hopefully, I can get to play with Littleflower after everything is done.”

After finishing, Han Yufei stared at Han Sen for a while, then he turned to leave.

“Dad…” Han Sen yelled at Han Yufei’s back, but he didn’t know what to say. There seemed to be a million words stuck at his mouth, and he couldn’t say anything.

Before he left, Han Yufei turned around and said, “Oh, right. The previous Chairman said that it’s important to have a solid foundation. That’s related to the level of your geno armor, and it determines your fate as well. No matter what, improve your power as much as possible before entering the Fifth Sanctuary so that your genes will be more complete.”

If what Han Sen’s dad said was true, the human ancestor should have been a God, and humans should be the descendants of God. Why were humans so weak that their inborn genes couldn’t even rival the shura race?

The shura were also descendants, but their inborn genes were only a bit stronger than those of humans. They couldn’t rival people like Tina at all.

And besides, what kind of organization was God? Why did it value Han Jingzhi this much? What was the place that the seventh team had gone to? What would happen after someone condensed a geno armor? All the questions were making Han Sen wonder.

For what it was worth, Han Sen now knew that his father was still safe and sound, so he felt more relieved.

“If I can condense a geno armor, I’ll be able to know the truth. It won’t take a long time.” Han Sen was thinking in his heart.

After getting back home, Han Sen went back to absorbing the Life Geno Essence, and his super geno points maxed out after more than a month.

His geno points were all maxed out now, and all his geno cores had reached gemstone level. Now he just needed to practice until they reached super level.

However, it would take much more than that to enter the Fifth Sanctuary. Han Yufei told Han Sen that he needed to break physical space and go through some special space. He would only be able to enter the universe after withstanding the training of that special space.

Han Sen was reaching the limits of what he could achieve with his current methods of training. Apparently, it wasn’t that easy to get to super level. Han Sen knew that he needed more battles or a turning point so that he could take another step forward.

He didn’t have any room to improve his geno points anymore, so Han Sen tested all four of his geno cores, and all of them reached the peak of the ranking system.

However, after achieving first rank, Han Sen couldn’t immediately move his geno cores to the super level, so he couldn’t get off the ranking either. When he was testing them, all four of the geno cores were in the ranking at the same time.

Based on the ranking of the Geno Core Storage, the Crystal Core was surpassed by the other three geno cores, which meant that it was the weakest of all four geno cores based on the system’s ranking.

When the other three geno cores were tested, none of them could surpass each other. He wasn’t sure if that was because there were all at the same level or because the gaps between them were negligible.

Then he used the Crystal Core as a jumping board, and all four geno cores reached first place and were reinforced nine times.

Han Sen hadn’t been in the sanctuary in a very long time. He could get the practice he needed in the universe, and he got to spend more time with his family.

Until one day, the martial halls of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary opened at the same time, and an announcement was made for the start of the Divinity’s Bout.

Divinity’s Bout in the Fourth Sanctuary attracted very little attention in the human race. After all, only a few human beings could become demigods. However, for those in the top-tier circle, it was a major event.

Whoever achieved first place in the Divinity’s Bout would earn the title Son of God, and he would be baptized by God.

Han Sen was very interested in that too. He wanted to fight top-tier demigod creatures to accelerate his own development, and he also wanted to know what baptism by God meant.

He signed up for Divinity’s Bout without hesitation, but he didn’t use his own name. Instead, he used the name “Dollar.”

“I’ll give it my best, and hopefully, I can win first place.” Han Sen wasn’t sure whether he could get first place or not; after all, his geno cores hadn’t reached super level yet.
