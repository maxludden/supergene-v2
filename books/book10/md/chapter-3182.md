  Han Sen’s hands fought the Flying Yan Spears. He did not have any more power to endure the arrow Yan Dan had fired. When the arrow left its cradling string, it was hidden by empty power. He could not see where the arrow went.

The arrow’s power looked like it was touching Han Sen’s body, but it wasn’t actually touching him. It crushed his skin downward. It was about to puncture his skin, but Han Sen’s body had already reacted. He slightly leaned to the side of the arrow.

Han Sen’s body was able to endure the power of the arrow. Unfortunately, his entire body’s power was focused on combatting the Flying Yan Spears. If his body was hit, it would likely break the balance he had struck. Therefore, Han Sen did not opt to immediately tackle the arrow.

“Let’s see how many times you can dodge.” Yan Dan drew his bow again. The rain of arrows he fired at Han Sen was something akin to a meteor shower. It was like they could block every possible angle Han Sen could turn.

Feng Yin Yin was very worried. She clenched her hands tightly. She put her hands atop her chest as if she was praying for Han Sen’s safety.

Bao’er was different. She looked like she didn’t care at all. She just sipped on a carton of juice.

Han Sen did not move. He kept using his combination of Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra to put into the Flying Yan Spears. The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power was blood inherited. The Xuan Yellow Sutra’s power could force a return to origin. The positive and negative, those two powers combined, could create a remarkable chemical reaction. The powers that could break the world were related to the Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra, but they were completely different.

The breaking world powers kept invading the Flying Yan Spears. Han Sen clearly felt that the Flying Yan Spears were exhibiting some changes. Those changes made him start to feel there was some weird connection between him and the Flying Yan Spears.

It was now a very critical moment. Han Sen did not have the time to take care of anything else. He let his body go and used his power to handle the Flying Yan Spears.

Han Sen was quite scary when he focused on the fight, but it would have been scarier if he had not put any effort into it.

His body moved amid the arrows. It was like his body had no measure of weight. Many scary, invisible arrows landed on him. They might have pushed against his body, but none of them were able to perforate him. No matter how cruel and scary that power was, it could not damage Han Sen. His body’s touch and reflective power was very granular in its detail. Any type of movement could react to it.

The humans of the universe were all frozen. They used the powers of gene races to fight, so they had never seen anything like this before. The fact that he was able to push his self-battle power to this level was frightening.

After this fight, many humans started to focus on self-battle power practice. Although they might never reach Han Sen’s level, it made the humans of the universe of kingdoms strive to improve their inner power. Overall, it brought them up to a higher tier.

Yan Dan frowned slightly. He coldly said, “No matter how fast your body is, I do not believe you will be able to dodge all of my powers.”

Yan Dan’s body moved. It was like a shadow surrounding Han Sen, and it was moving fast. The bow in Yan Dan’s hands kept firing as he went. The rain of arrows came from four sides and eight directions.

Yet, Yan Dan did not dare get too close to his enemy. He knew he could not compete with the scary self-battle body power. He did not dare fight Han Sen face to face. In fact, Han Sen cared very little about Yan Dan. He was in a critical moment when it came to fighting the Flying Yan Spears. He felt as if he improved once more, he could break the core powers of the Flying Yan Spears. By doing that, the tide would be turned.

Even Han Sen’s heart was not moved during this fight. He had already pushed his body to the max. It made him able to move swiftly and smoothly amid the rain of arrows as easily as if it was a walk in the park.

“Traveling by 10,000 flowers and bushes without a single leaf touching him… Dollar’s body battle power is terrifying.” Sky King could not help but compliment what he was witnessing.

In the geno hall, the hall’s leader and 12 God Spirits watched the battle unfold with their heads held low. They saw Han Sen having a chill stroll in the midst of an invisible rain of arrows.

“Han Sen’s battle body power has reached the max,” a God Spirit said with a sigh. “I do not think any one of us will be able to beat him here.”

“This power is not unchangeable,” Empty God coldly said. “Even if his body’s battle power does not allow him to lose, it does not mean his body is invincible.”

“So, what? His body is better than that of a God Spirit. He is invincible. Do you really think there is a power in this world that can stop him?” Another God Spirit did not agree with Empty God’s assessment.

“Even if he is invincible, he still has to play by the rules,” Empty God coldly said. “The Break World Power can hurt him, and my power can affect him too.”

“I have faith in Dollar. Perhaps he really can reach that step.”

“Hardly. Qin Xiu wanted to reach that level too, but he failed. Do you guys believe Qin Xiu was weaker than Han Sen is right now? Qin Xiu achieved an invincible body, but even he still failed.”

The 12 high-level God Spirits continued their discussions. Meanwhile, the hall leader only smiled and continued to watch the fight between Han Sen and Yan Dan unfold. He said nothing.

Yan Dan used many tricks, but he was unable to harm Han Sen’s body. Over time, the power of the Flying Yan Spears grew steadily weaker. Many people knew Yan Dan’s power was fading. He did not stand a chance. When Dollar completely controlled the Flying Yan Spears, Yan Dan would lose.

Yan Dan did not look disappointed. He was still holding his bow but had stopped firing arrows. He looked at Han Sen and smiled. “You are a very powerful person. It is a shame the people around you might not be as strong as you are. I am counting down the time until Rocky Dee arrives.”

When Han Sen heard those words, he immediately frowned.

“The time is now.” Yan Dan suddenly moved his bow. Many arrows suddenly fired.

In Jade Wall City’s Feng family castle, a man and a woman arrived at the castle’s door. The man was wearing a top hat and three-piece suit. He had a very thick, big, black beard. He was holding a beautiful cane.

The woman looked like a maid, but her head had a dragon horn.

The castle’s guards walked before them and asked, “Do you need something?”

Rocky Dee continued walking ahead as if the guards did not exist.

The guards tried to stop him, but the dragon lady’s eyes froze. The guards felt as if they had been stared at by a big dragon. They were filled with a terrifying fear of the big, scary dragon. Their bodies were pushed to the ground. Their limbs were spread out across the floor. They were unable to move.

“Han Sen, no matter how strong you become, you are a human with weaknesses. Therefore, you can only lose.” Rocky Dee squinted his eyes as he held the cane. He was going inside the Feng family castle.

Feng Fei Fei, Feng Yin Yin, and the others were all there watching the god fights when they heard the guards scream. They hurried out to have a look. They saw Rocky Dee and the dragon maid coming. Their faces immediately changed.

Han Sen had told them about Rocky Dee. They recognized who this character was because Rocky Dee’s shape and appearance were very easy to remember.
