  Because they were unable to nab the treasure inside, Six Paths and God’s Retribution also planned on leaving. Little Fairy did, too, despite her reluctance to abandon the treasure.

Just in case they got lost again, Han Sen allowed Starsea Beast to guide them back to where they had been before they encountered the flowers.

Starsea Beast went back through the glacier mountains, returning to where they came from, back when they first saw the God’s Corpse Bugs. Fortunately, there were no more of the creatures to be seen. Perhaps they returned to the ice.

“It’s safe now. I should go. Whoever gets the treasure, it’ll be done so through their own work.” God’s Retribution quickly took his leave.

Han Sen thought it was suspicious he left. It made him wonder whether or not the man could practice the secret skill.

But that had to be impossible. Even if he was able to practice it, without Starsea Beast’s powers, it would be very difficult to return to the tower.

After all, Starsea Beast went there in a straight line. God’s Retribution would have to traverse many mountains if he did not have a creature like that. Walking back to the tower would take a very long time, provided he could even relocate it once again.

Six Paths also bid his departure. They usually preferred working alone, and they were never very fond of sharing treasure with others. Han Sen decided to let Starsea Beast rest for a while so it could recover its energy. Then, they resumed their journey to the Godlight Tunnel.

There were many strange places in God’s Ruin, but very few creatures. Aside from the God’s Corpse Bugs and the Ice Seahorses, they hadn’t seen anything else.

“There’s a rocky mountain up ahead. This has to be right. This is where the tunnel is!” Little Fairy, who was up front, began to shout excitedly.

Han Sen was sitting on Little Star’s back. He looked forward and saw a few grey mountains resting between two glaciers. It looked to be where the tunnel was said to reside.

Starsea Beast moved his legs quickly in a frantic rush to get there. But before they could reach that rocky mountain, they encountered many creatures.

Han Sen looked at them all closely, and that was when he froze. He had managed to catch sight of the angelic-looking woman and the cheap dog that was her pet.

As he continued to look around, Han Sen also caught sight of Yu Miao and Yu Xuan. It looked as if they had brought companions along with them, to keep them protected in their journey to God’s Ruin.

Much to his surprise, Han Sen saw another familiar face aside from Yu Miao and Goddess. It was Little Jade Lion King; the creature he had met in the geno core storage on more than one occasion.

They weren’t very strong, but the biggest problem was the sheer number of gemstone class creatures they had brought with them. They were all as strong as Goddess and Yu Miao herself.

The reactions and facial expressions of each of them were different when they saw Han Sen.

Yu Miao and Goddess frowned, not expecting to see him there. Little Jade Lion King didn’t think much of him, as he had yet to realize that Han Sen was the owner of Crystal Core.

“What are you doing here?” Yu Xuan asked Han Sen.

He thought Han Sen’s soul was damaged beyond repair, so he didn’t take the human seriously.

“I’m here for the Godlight Tunnel. I don’t see another reason why I’d have come.” Han Sen squinted his eyes, examining each of the creatures around him.

They had a few dozen spirits and creatures following them. Han Sen calculated whether or not he could destroy them all and kill his favored targets: Goddess, the dog, Yu Miao, and Yu Xuan.

Goddess and her dog would his primary targets. They were both creatures, too; if they died, they died.

If Han Sen killed Yu Miao and Yu Xuan, they’d respawn. But murdering them would still feel good, even if it wasn’t permanent.

Han Sen looked at the creatures behind Goddess, and that was when he saw a familiar human face. It gave him a shock.

“Why is she here?” Han Sen saw Queen Huangfu Jing.

When he returned to the Alliance, he had learned Queen was a demigod. But she herself never returned to the Alliance, so he wondered what might have happened to her.

He would never have guessed that Queen had ended up in Sacred Shelter with Goddess and was now accompanying her to God’s Ruin.

Queen recognized Han Sen, but she didn’t show any expression of it. Perhaps she didn’t want to cause any trouble by showing it.

Han Sen didn’t know if Queen was trapped by a contract or not, so he didn’t show he recognized her, either. He didn’t want them to hold her hostage and use her to threaten him.

Even more surprising, when he looked even further into the lot there, he saw someone else he recognized. It was Tang Zhenliu. He was standing behind a spirit that was behind Yu Miao.

They were both the same. They held their acknowledgments to avoid causing a scene, but they were definitely worried.

Yu Miao, having just been insulted by Han Sen, looked grim. He responded unpleasantly, “Do you think the Godlight Tunnel is a place just anyone can enter, if they so please? Outer Sky owns it now. Give me a gemstone geno core, if you want to enter.”

Before Han Sen replied, Little Jade Lion said, “What do you mean the tunnel is owned by Outer Sky? This is ours! It belongs to Lion Mountain.”

“What are you both talking about? Sacred is the true master of the Godlight Tunnel. Gods are sacred, and so are we!” The cheap dog next to Goddess muttered.

Now Han Sen knew why they were all stuck on the outside, with none having entered. That was because each of the three factions wanted to assert ownership and start a tollbooth.

Around the mountain, there were a number of other creatures and spirits watching. They didn’t belong to any renowned faction, just like Han Sen. Most seemed to have come in a party of three or so.

“You guys are so selfish. You want to claim the Godlight Tunnel for yourselves? Aren’t you afraid of offending the countless spirits and creatures that simply want access?” A lone spirit spoke in an annoyed tone, having been prohibited entry.

“If you don’t agree with me, then perhaps you’d like to taste my Lionheart Stamp? If you can withstand a stamping, I’ll let you in.” Little Jade Lion was not afraid, and he went ahead to summon his Lionheart Stamp geno core.

Han Sen, when seeing the geno core, frowned. It was not his self geno core. It was very powerful, and it was definitely super class.

Now, Han Sen knew that anyone could bring a super geno core in, as long as it wasn’t their self geno core. You wouldn’t be allowed in if your self geno core was super.

It seemed that the lion wasn’t the only one playing by these rules, either. Goddess and Yu Miao must have brought supers of their own, too.
