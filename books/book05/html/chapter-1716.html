<p>“This is Planet Kate. So, where can I find Feathers to collect
these bones and then give them to you?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Old Cat lifted his lips and said, “Even if there are Feathers
about, you wouldn’t stand a chance against them. If you’re looking
to harvest their bones, you think too highly of yourself. The one
you killed in that lab was some under-developed retard. That
doesn’t even count as a Feather. That was rubbish. Do you actually
think they are all like that?”</p>
<p>“If you knew they are that powerful, why would you ask me to
kill them?” Han Sen knew his power wasn’t that high, compared to
the breadth of the geno universe.</p>
<p>Old Cat looked at Han Sen and said, “I didn’t ask you to kill
them, but you are the one who wants to go back, yes? I can’t throw
my life away in the pursuit of helping you, you know.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t reply, but the Old Cat went on to say, “You don’t
have to go back, either. Even if I did help you return, what if you
were simply pulled back here, anyway? Do you really think
generating a geno armor will allow you to escape Big Silence
system? Many Nobles have died there. Yes, even if you have a geno
weapon, you can still die. You are doing good right now as you are,
and following me is the best course of action and the best card you
have to play.”</p>
<p>“Aside from the bones of Feathers, is there anything else you’ll
take?” Han Sen didn’t respond to what Old Cat had just said. “Yeah.
I want a Xenogeneic gene,” Old Cat swiftly answered.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Old Cat brought out the jade organ he had pulled from the weird
bug creature. He held it up with a flourish, as if he had pulled it
out of thin air. “Look. This is a xenogeneic gene. Your bone is
one, too. You will only find these on a mutated creature. Of
course, the body parts can be different, as it all depends on how
they were mutated. But the bottom line is the same: kill them, and
then find these inside the bodies.”</p>
<p>“Where can I find them?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic genes can be found inside every race.” Old Cat
looked like he was smiling, but he wasn’t. “So, at this point,
you’ve learned that geno armors and geno weapons are
different.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. Old Cat went on to say, “In this geno universe,
creatures can generate geno armor. Some are lucky enough to be
chosen, and when they generate their geno armor, they can evolve
into two different things. They can create geno weapons or mutate
their bodies.”</p>
<p>Han Sen quietly said, “That means the mutated are the same level
as geno weapons, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Whether a creature is xenogeneic or has a geno weapon, it
will have super gene powers. If you don’t have either of those, you
can’t hurt them. You should just focus on generating a geno armor,
and see if further down the line you can generate a geno weapon.
Without a geno weapon, there is little you can do. And of course,
there is always the possibility you end up xenogeneic. But the
biggest problem is that as a xenogeneic develops, they lose sense
and become hostile and murderous.” Old Cat laughed.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t ask a question about that, thinking it was
pointless. Without geno armor, he wouldn’t be able to kill a
xenogeneic anyway.</p>
<p>His biggest help right now was the Northern King Glove. That was
a geno weapon, but it didn’t quite belong to him. He couldn’t use
it as well as the Nobles could use their naturally developed
ones.</p>
<p>“What do those words mean?” Han Sen pointed to the grave of Han
Jinzhi.</p>
<p>Old Cat looked and said, “The biggest liar in the universe, Han
Jinzhi.”</p>
<p>After reading it, Old Cat found it interesting, laughed, and
said, “What an ostentatious epitaph.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it is a human buried here?” Han Sen asked Old
Cat.</p>
<p>Old Cat shook his head and said, “I don’t think so. Not many
people can leave the sanctuaries. I would say this is most likely a
crystallizer.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe that Both the name and the epitaph
sounded like Han Jinzhi.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not dig up a grave, though. He wasn’t afraid of
doing some excavation, but this was not the Alliance. If the people
of Planet Kate found out, he’d probably be sent to jail.</p>
<p>And when creatures died here, they were cremated. There were
only ashes, so there wouldn’t be anything to see.</p>
<p>Old Cat encouraged him to generate a geno armor with some haste.
If he had a geno weapon, he could kill a xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Before Old Cat left, Han Sen asked how he might contact the cat
in the future. The cat responded he’d come back himself sometime,
but he left no details on how he could be found.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on practicing, and he kept trying to understand
more about Planet Kate and the geno universe.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was an internet system. It wasn’t as good as
the Alliance’s network, but it could send messages. Han Sen was
able to learn some of their language, and he was soon learning
quite a bit about the place.</p>
<p>Because the xenogeneic always wanted to kill, the universe was
in some danger. And you could never tell when someone was going to
become one of them. But once someone became xenogeneic, they grew
much stronger. Unless Nobles came to help, people with geno armors
would be shredded.</p>
<p>He learned that the society there had really come to admire
Nobles, too. To the commoners, they were true royalty. They were
protectors, in a way.</p>
<p>There were different classes of Nobles, too. There were Dukes,
Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons. The xenogeneic had ranks,
as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen only found these titles on the internet, and he was so
far unable to learn the differences between them. But there was one
thing Han Sen knew for sure. If he encountered a xenogeneic before
he generated a geno armor, he’d be killed.</p>
<p>“It looks like I need to generate a geno armor quickly.” Han Sen
worked as a grave watcher, but practiced his The Story of Genes,
Dongxuan Sutra, and Blood-PUIse Sutra whenever he could. Most of
his energy was exhausted on The Story of Genes, though. It was the
fastest to practice with, so it would be the easiest way for him to
generate a geno armor.</p>
