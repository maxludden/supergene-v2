  This was a voice Han Sen was no stranger to. In the past, Ancient God’s Water God attacked the geno hall. The master of this voice suppressed the assault.

When Golden Growler attacked the geno hall, the master of that voice appeared there as well.

Han Sen peered through the god light. He saw a woman standing there. Under the 10,000 race lamps, it made her look very holy and pure. It was like the entire world should obey that figure.

Han Sen looked at the goddess and asked, “Are you talking to me?”

The goddess smiled. “Aside from you and the geno hall, are there any other creatures around?”

“I do not think I am familiar with you.” Han Sen looked at the goddess and asked, “Why are you waiting for me?”

“You know I am an unclean goddess,” the goddess coldly said. “How could you not know who I am?”

Han Sen was shocked. “I am afraid there might have been a misunderstanding. I have never seen you before. How am I supposed to know whether or not you’re pure?”

“If there is no light, there is no darkness. Light and dark are two sides of the same coin. Light God is not holy. Did you not say something like that before?” The goddess looked as if she was smiling, but she wasn’t smiling.

“Are you Light Goddess?” Han Sen now knew the identity of the goddess. He developed a wry smile. It was always awkward for a person to find out someone was talking about them behind their back and confront them.

“According to what you have just said, you can call me Dark Goddess,” Light Goddess emotionlessly said.

“Light and dark is a necessary component of the universe. I cannot deny that.” Han Sen felt as if he was not very good at explaining things. He coughed and changed the subject. “I want to see the leader of this hall. Is he in today?”

After that, Han Sen tried peeking into the hall. Aside from the 10,000 race lanterns, there was nothing else to see. He did not know if God Hall Leader was in there or not.

“He is not in,” Light Goddess said. “For this year in the universe, I am the one tasked with protecting the geno hall. If you want to see him, I recommend that you come back another time.”

Han Sen thought Light Goddess was a trustworthy person. If God Hall Leader knew he was there, he would have come. Otherwise, unless the God Hall Leader did not want to see him, he would have been the one to go there.

If God Hall Leader really did not want to see him, it was pointless even if he insisted.

“If God Hall Leader is not here, might it be possible for me to ask for your help.” Han Sen had to take a step back.

“Your body has already become a spirit. You are like an empty spirit. Aside from reincarnating, you cannot become human again. If you want, I can send you through the geno hall to reincarnate.” Light Goddess clearly understood why Han Sen had come to see her. So, she was honest with him.

“If I reincarnate, can I still keep the memories of my past life?” Han Sen asked.

“That is impossible,” Light Goddess replied with certainty.

If Han Sen could not keep his memories, he did not want to reincarnate. To be reborn with an empty soul was not far off from dying.

“Is there any other way?” Han Sen quietly asked.

“Yes.” That surprised Han Sen. Light Goddess’s answer was spoken with strong confidence.

“If you are saying there is another way, then why did you just tell me there was no other way a moment ago?” Han Sen thought, but he did not actually say it out loud.

After all, Han Sen needed her help. He couldn’t offend her.

Light Goddess seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. She coldly said, “I said there was no other way aside from reincarnating if you wanted to be a human again. When I tell you there is another way, there is another way. It just means you won’t be a human.”

“Not be human? Do you want me to be a God Spirit?” Han Sen’s heart jumped.

Light Goddess nodded and said, “Yeah. You have a pure spirit body. Aside from reincarnating, you cannot be a human again. You can, however, become a God Spirit.”

“What is the difference between a God Spirit and my current shape?” Han Sen frowned.

“Of course, there is a difference,” Light Goddess said. “Right now, aside from your situation that involves your past memories, you are like an empty spirit. Before you reincarnate, you will not have a connection to this world. You cannot touch anything that exists here, and no one can hear or see you. According to the theory, you are still alive, but your current status is not all that different from you being dead. If you want to become a God Spirit, you can make a god base. With a god base, you can make a god body again. If you do that, you will become someone like me.”

“This might be a silly thing to ask, but if I become a God Spirit, what level of God Spirit will I become?” Han Sen squinted his eyes as he peered at Light Goddess.

Light Goddess did not hesitate to answer. “You are the master of the God of Wealth Temple. You can use the God of Wealth Temple to become a god. You will be the 13th Annihilation-class main god.”

“After I become a God Spirit, what will I need to do?” Han Sen did not want to become a God Spirit.

He was just a common man. He wanted the life of a commoner. He did not want to sit in a god temple all day.

“You must protect the geno hall and keep the universe in order,” Light Goddess answered.

“If I become a real God Spirit, can I choose not to do that?” Han Sen asked.

“Yeah.” Light Goddess’s answer made Han Sen a happy chap, but Light Goddess added, “But Annihilation main gods are different than the average God Spirit. If the geno hall is destroyed, your god bases will be destroyed. If you do not mind that happening, then you will not have to do anything.”

Han Sen suddenly thought about the Sky God Crown he already had. He thought about how becoming the master of the God of Wealth Temple was one grand setup for this.

He looked at Light Goddess, turned around, and ran.

If he was to become a God Spirit, he could live. That solution was not any better than his current condition.

Light Goddess saw Han Sen leave in a hurry. She was shocked by this sudden change, but she did not want to stop him from escaping. In a short amount of time, he was gone.

The geno hall’s doors closed. The spirits going there like mad returned to normal.

Light Goddess walked to an altar. She placed a right on her chest and bowed before the leader of the geno hall. “Mister, it is just as you said. Han Sen did choose to leave. If you were so sure about this, do you think he is going to do that?”

“No matter how small the chance is, a chance is a chance,” God Hall Leader said with a smile. “It is better than no chance.”

“Spirits have existed here for 10 million years, but no one has been this shocking before. If he can fight against Qin Xiu, you have to know that Qin Xiu is…” Light Goddess had to stop talking. She sounded as if she had just misspoken. She lowered her head and apologized.

“His spirit is normal,” God Hall Leader coldly said. “It was always normal. But in this life, he has a chance to not be normal.”
