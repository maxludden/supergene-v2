<h3>Chapter 1944</h3>

<p>Seven Spirit sprinted toward Han Sen. He wanted to slay Han Sen
as soon as he fell. But Han Sen only dipped a little, then
immediately sprang back to his feet. His speed did not diminish,
either, as he kept on running forward.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit’s brow furrowed. He wielded his wooden gong with a
thousand Buddha hands.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The sound of thunder rumbled in Han Sen’s heart, like it could
annihilate the spirit of any being.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was not affected, and he continued running. In the
times between Seven Spirit’s use of his thousand Buddha hands, Han
Sen was able to increase the distance that separated the two.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit frowned harder. He channeled all his power into his
legs so he could focus on catching back up to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Due to Han Sen’s provocation, Seven Spirit had cast the scariest
powers he had. It had cost him a lot of energy, and the distance
between the two was quite large now. He didn’t want to risk
exhausting more of his strength.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s speed was a boon of the rabbit shoes. Beast souls had
their own power, and they didn’t tax Han Sen’s own energy reserves.
As a result, he’d never have to slow down.</p>
<p>They both kept running across the desert. Seven Spirit kept
trying to attack Han Sen, but Han Sen was able to evade each and
every strike. Han Sen’s opponent was unable to damage him in the
slightest.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was hit by the Buddha’s sonic attack, he had been
injured. Fortunately, he had practiced sonic hyper geno arts in the
past. He was no stranger to what they could do. When Seven Spirit
attacked the second time, he used Yin Yang Blast to reverse some of
the Buddha’s sonic power that was bearing down on his Marquise
armor.</p>
<p>It made it look as if he was not affected by the Buddha’s second
sonic attack. His Marquise armor, however, was full of cracks. He
had indeed been injured. Still, Han Sen was able to hold on. And
with his speed not slowing down, Seven Spirit believed Han Sen had
not been damaged by the Buddha’s sonic attack.</p>
<p>If Seven Spirit struck the wooden gong more, Han Sen wouldn’t be
able to withstand it.</p>
<p>“This guy is annoying. It is lucky that I am able to understand
a bit of the reach of his strength.” Han Sen used his rabbit shoes
to keep on running.</p>
<p>Han Sen had nothing else to do right now, and so he had to keep
on doing this. Seven Spirit was using all his power to chase Han
Sen, and Han Sen didn’t think he could continue doing this
indefinitely.</p>
<p>“I am going to tire you out! I’m not afraid of you, because I
have a beast soul.” Han Sen gritted his teeth and ran. He was going
to compete with Seven Spirits with stamina, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit was pledged to do the same. He couldn’t kill Han
Sen, and his marks were useless. He didn’t attack, and so he
preserved his energy for the purpose of running.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit did not think Han Sen, who was a Viscount, could
keep up that speed for long. He had a plan.</p>
<p>If Han Sen kept running like that, the noise of Heaven would
bear down louder and louder. Seven Spirit had a Buddha geno art
that granted him a strong resistance to the noise. He did not think
Han Sen could last as long as he would under the power of those
sounds.</p>
<p>Once Han Sen was controlled by the music, Seven Spirit would
have Han Sen’s life under his thumb.</p>
<p>When Seven Spirit stopped talking, Han Sen decided to provoke
him some more. He hoped his nemesis would be angered into attacking
again, exhausting more of his energy.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit did not say anything. He did not attack, and he
just kept chasing. Looking at Seven Spirit’s eyes, he seemed like
the devil. His entire body carried a bad aura.</p>
<p>While Han Sen ran, he saw a few shadows ahead. When he drew
nearer, he noticed it was Luo Ji and a few others.</p>
<p>Han Sen ran to Luo Ji and shouted, “Mister Ji, help! Seven
Spirit wants to kill me.”</p>
<p>When Luo Ji heard Han Sen, his own face changed. He then
shouted, “Run!”</p>
<p>They all ran without hesitation. In Luo Ji’s heart, he yelled,
“Han Sen is an *sshole who’s going to get me killed!”</p>
<p>Luo Ji’s brain responded quickly to this. He knew what was going
on here.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit wanted to kill Knife Queen’s student. If Knife
Queen knew about this, the Buddha and the Rebate would suffer a big
divide. If anyone saw Seven Spirit chasing Han Sen, they might be
killed.</p>
<p>Luo Ji ran fast, but when he turned around, he saw Han Sen was
next to him. Luo Ji couldn’t outrun him. Luo Ji shouted, “You
*sshole! We have no grudge with you. Why bring us harm?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought to himself, “You did the same to me in Demon’s
Grave; this is you getting your just deserts.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had his rabbit shoes, so he was able to run faster than
Luo Ji. When Han Sen was about to pass them by, he leaped over
their heads.</p>
<p>Luo Ji knew he could not let him pass. If he did, Seven Spirit
would reach him first, and Luo Ji and his people would be
killed.</p>
<p>Luo Ji shouted, “Block him!”</p>
<p>After that, he drew his knife out and tried to cut Han Sen. The
knife came at Han Sen like a demon. The black smoke lurched toward
Han Sen, and it made onlookers think there’d be no way for him to
block it.</p>
<p>The Demons around Luo Ji tried to attack Han Sen, too. They had
not practiced Sky Demon Sutra, and neither did they have Sky Demon
powers. All they used were geno arts.</p>
<p>But they were all Earls. And there was a Marquise in their
midst. When they attacked, they did so with grand strength.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move, and the Sky Demon powers hit Han Sen. So
did the others, with their scary attacks. Han Sen’s body exploded
like a water balloon.</p>
<p>Above their heads, though, Han Sen’s body reappeared. He flew
right over them like a bolt of light. What they had attacked was
one of Han Sen’s clones. He produced it from his Moon skills.</p>
<p>“Split up!” Luo Ji could not prevent Han Sen’s advance, so he
barked the command and ran. Each Demon went off in a different
direction.</p>
<p>Han Sen, seeing Luo Ji respond so quickly, thought he was
something of a genius. But even so, he was as evil as an old fox.
Han Sen was hoping the crew could buy him some time, but that
looked like it might be unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>They all ran their separate ways, and Seven Spirit Buddha was
unable to catch up to kill them all. There was no point in killing
them, and he appeared to be letting them go.</p>
<p>What happened next shocked Han Sen, though. Seven Spirit shone
with gold. His body became golden, and he expanded three meters in
every direction. Each side of his head grew an extra face, and his
body sprouted an additional six arms.</p>
<p>He had eight arms and four faces. He looked like a weird Buddha
statue.</p>
<p>“This guy is a xenogeneic!” Han Sen’s face changed, and he knew
what he was going to do.</p>
