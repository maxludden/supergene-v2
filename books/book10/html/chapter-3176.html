<p>“Although Zhuo Donglai did not combine with an Annihilation God
Spirit, every sword light power is like an Annihilation God
Spirit’s attack. This scary power is so shocking. No wonder the Wu
Wei Dao Palace Alpha once used the purple mist holy clothes to
strike down a kingdom with a single sword hit. It was so
overbearing, so how does Han Sen hope to compete against it?” Sky
King squinted his eyes as if he was watching a movie.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee sighed and said, “Back then, the Wu Wei Dao Palace
Alpha really was a genius who shocked the world. Even our leader
made sure to avoid him. It is a shame that he chose not to join my
God Chaos Party. If he had, I could have guaranteed him the chance
to become someone really big.” Everyone had their will stolen by
that beautiful sword. They felt as if they could not beat it.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the scary sword mind coming for him, but he was not
afraid. He used his finger like a sword and pointed it at Zhuo
Donglai’s attacks, all of which were headed for this direction.</p>
<p>No sword air shook the sky. He did not muster a powerful sword
light. It was like he was gently threading a needle. He did not
even try to compare his might with Zhuo Donglai’s sword skills,
which were shaking the sky.</p>
<p>When Han Sen thrust forward, the entire audience’s heart brimmed
with shock. They all felt as if the knives were striking their
hearts and perforating them. Some people felt terrible about it, so
they fell back. Many people coughed out blood in awe of the sight.
Even though the powerful elites had calm hearts, they looked
shocked.</p>
<p>This was the spirit sword skill Han Sen had learned from Six
Paths Emperor. The spirit sword skill was not a spirit body sword
skill. It was a sword skill that went straight to one’s heart.</p>
<p>This was a sword skill that depended on one’s heart and will.
The sword pointed straight to the heart. If one’s heart was lacking
in some way, it would be harmed by the sword. This skill had a
name, but it meant nothing. It had a spirit, but it was not
solid.</p>
<p>The spirit sword did not have the power to harm anyone, but
people who were struck by the spirit sword skill would make
themselves their enemy.</p>
<p>Zhuo Donglai looked at Han Sen’s sword, which was coming for
him. It was like he had suddenly fallen into the grasp of a
terrible nightmare. His mind was flooded with all sorts of weird
scenes. The guard he had on his will was lost. The strongest purple
air coming from the mist was broken. It simply vanished.</p>
<p>“What kind of evil sword skill was that?” The nobles of the
seven kingdoms were as much scared as they were shocked. They did
not understand what kind of power Han Sen had just used to enable
such a weird effect on his opponent.</p>
<p>They always thought the actual power was the base. They forgot
about the power they had inside them. Not many people saw how truly
amazing Han Sen’s skill was.</p>
<p>Only some top-class elites had been able to witness the granular
details of Han Sen’s sword skill. They could not help but
compliment him profusely, comparing him to a god when it came to
his prowess with a blade.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and looked at Zhuo Donglai. Because the spirit
sword skill was powerful, he did not think Zhuo Donglai would be
defeated by the spirit sword skill so easily. He felt as if there
was another reason for Zhuo Donglai being broken.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some god light appeared in space, and a light came
down after. It landed on Zhuo Donglai and made his body possess
some strange blue light. It was like some power was being pulled
away from his body. “Blood-Pulse is taken…” Yan Bei Fei let out a
long sigh.</p>
<p>By now, everyone was able to understand what had happened. The
God Spirit Blood-Pulse that a God Spirit had given to Zhuo Donglai
was being taken away. The God Spirit Blood-Pulse was leaving him.
The blue lights, which kept shining on him, gradually wore away the
gracious image of power that was once Zhuo Donglai. It was like the
man’s life force was slowly escaping him. He was sort of like a
dead person.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As Zhuo Donglai’s God Spirit Blood – Pulse faded, his purple
mist holy clothes were snatched from his body.</p>
<p>To the humans of the universe of kingdoms, the God Spirit
Blood-Pulse was the base in which to control gene races. Now, Zhuo
Donglai’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse had been taken back. The purple
mist holy clothes, which was a rare gene race, were no longer bound
to him. They had been set free.</p>
<p>Sky Group Leader looked happy about it. The elder on his side
looked happy too. He said, “The purple mist holy clothes are now
free. They will return to the pool. When Little Brother goes into
the pool, you and I can help him. Little Brother will be protected
by the gene race. Then, he can carry on the legacy of the Sky
Group.”</p>
<p>Sky Group Leader wanted to force Zhuo Donglai out. It was not
just because he wanted him to quit fighting for the Sky Group
Leader position. The most important reason was for him to obtain
the purple mist holy clothes for himself.</p>
<p>Without actual power, even if the Sky Group Leader forced his
son to take on the mantle of being the next Sky Group Leader, he
would not be there for long.</p>
<p>If he could get aid from the purple mist holy clothes, the Sky
Group Leader’s seat was solidified.</p>
<p>Sky Group Leader had been planning this for a long time. If the
purple mist holy clothes returned to the pool, he had a secret
skill and treasure to bolster his son’s power. Even though he had
wasted his life and all his efforts, he wanted a future for his
son.</p>
<p>Although Sky Group Leader felt guilty about Zhuo Donglai, the
nature of a real bloodline and an old body and heart still ensured
he would do all that he could for his son.</p>
<p>What made Sky Group Leader and the old man feel weird was the
fact that the purple mist holy clothes left Zhuo Donglai’s body but
did not return to the pool. It floated in front of Zhuo Donglai as
if it was looking at Zhuo Donglai. The purple mist flickered like a
robe of cloth made of sky mist.</p>
<p>A man and some clothes were floating. The man was old like dry
grass. The clothes were shining with a misty light. The scene was
very weird. Zhuo Donglai ‘s God Spirit Blood-Pulse had been taken
away, and the mysterious light disappeared into space.</p>
<p>Zhu Donglai had lost all the power he once had. He no longer
looked like a god. His long purple hair had no more purple mist.
His black hair was gone too. His long hair had become white. It was
like he had grown old overnight.</p>
<p>Seeing a powerful and pretty man reduced to that drove many
women and ladies to feel sorry for him. It made the waterworks come
on. They sobbed for their loss.</p>
<p>Many powerful elites felt it was a great shame. They could no
longer watch a rare, talented person like that come to such an end.
“Sky Group Leader, this guy is too much.” In Wu Wei Dao Palace,
some people felt extremely sorry for Zhuo Donglai, but that was Sky
Group’s business. Even if they wanted to exact vengeance, they were
not able to.</p>
<p>At this time, the purple mist holy clothes continued to float
with a purple mist. It was like a God Spirit was descending. It was
releasing an endless holy presence of purple mist.</p>
<p>“Are the purple mist holy clothes going to return to the pool?”
Sky Group Leader felt terrible about this too. When he saw the
purple mist holy clothes rise, he felt excited again.</p>
<p>In the next second, Sky Group Leader’s eyes opened wide. He
looked on in utter disbelief.</p>
<p>The purple mist holy clothes descended onto Zhuo Donglai, whose
hair was now totally white. They draped and clothed him again like
a godly robe. Purple air endlessly covered the sky, making Zhuo
Donglai’s body brim with purple air. His presence recovered
quickly. He was like some god who had just woken up from a long
slumber.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? Impossible… Zhuo Donglai no longer has a
God Spirit Blood-Pulse. How can the purple mist holy clothes still
select him? That is unbelievable…” Sky Group Leader stood up. He
stared at the purple mist holy clothes and Zhuo Donglai in utter
disbelief.</p>
