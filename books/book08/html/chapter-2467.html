<h2>Punch Seal King</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2467</h3>

<p>Although Barr was a hybrid of the Destroyed, his talents were
scarier than most of the full-blooded Destroyed. On top of that, he
was practically immortal. As long as his cells were not completely
eradicated, he could be reborn through his remaining genes. And
each time his body was obliterated, he came back stronger. He was
sort of like a cockroach that never died.</p>
<p>Barr had already killed many half-deified people who were
stronger than him on paper. Han Sen had battled him once before,
but he was unable to finish the maniac off.</p>
<p>After the Treasure Identifier Elder received the video, the
stream was distributed across all media stations. He played the
video for all to see.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a livestream, though. It had been modified by Treasure
Identifier Elder and his team before it was played across all the
broadcasting networks. There was a bit of a delay so it could be
processed, but most people considered it a livestream anyway.</p>
<p>Considering the content that the Thousand Treasures had
delivered with their two most recent broadcasts, most of the
broadcasting networks gave the Treasure Identifier Elder air time
immediately.</p>
<p>There had been amazing viewership numbers for the past two
broadcasts, so this video didn’t need to go through the normal
approval process. In moments, the broadcast was playing on screens
throughout the geno universe.</p>
<p>“Tago Geno Fluid—it makes you strong like the Tago! Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the first broadcasting station in the Tianxia
System. Here is the video of Han Sen’s capture.”</p>
<p>The show that was on air suddenly stopped. Many people were
angry, but when they saw what was playing now, their eyes widened
and locked on the screen.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Barr from the Destroyed? And Shadow from the Storm?
And look, there is Thunder from Thundersnake. They’ve surrounded
Han Sen.”</p>
<p>“He deserves it. He was streaming with the Wanjie Rubix Cube
when he fled. He deserves to die.”</p>
<p>“Barr is going up to him… so powerful. No wonder Barr is so
famous. The power in his strikes can destroy small planets.”</p>
<p>“What do you know? That’s called the ‘Destroyed godlight.’ If
you get caught in a beam of that light, you or any other creature
would just die.”</p>
<p>“You guys don’t know shit. The Destroyed godlight isn’t Barr’s
strongest move. The amazing thing about Barr is his immortal body.
He can’t be killed. Even if Han Sen does defeat Barr, Barr won’t
stop coming. Plus, other elites are there as well. Han Sen won’t
get away today.”</p>
<p>Everyone was watching and discussing the content. Barr was the
most famous member of the hunting party, but the other Kings were
very good too.</p>
<p>Especially Shadow and Thunder. They belonged to some of the less
famous higher races. Still, as individuals, they weren’t weak. They
could easily compete with the best geniuses of most races.</p>
<p>Plus, Shadow and Thunder were half-deified. That was one step
greater than Barr, so in terms of power, they exceeded him.</p>
<p>While everyone watched this, Barr’s bone knife suddenly lunged
towards Han Sen’s head. A scary Destroyed knifelight shot forward
to strike Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen jerked to the side, dodging the thrust of the bone knife
and throwing a punch into Barr’s chest.</p>
<p>“Good hit!” Barr shouted. He then threw his left fist collide
with Han Sen’s.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Two fists struck each other, releasing a powerful shockwave. The
clouds rose and washed away, as if they had transformed into a
tsunami.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t budge, but Barr was sent flying. When he came to
a stop ten meters away, his face changed. Some sort of ice was
spreading over his fist, and it moved up his arms to cover his
entire body.</p>
<p>Barr opened his mouth to shout, but his body became a block of
ice before he had the chance. Inside the ice, Barr was in that
angry, roaring position. He could make no noise, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen shot past Barr, not even sparing a glance at his frozen
opponents. He went after the other Kings.</p>
<p>Shadow, who was of the Storm race, came at Han Sen first. Her
body was like a typhoon as she surged toward Han Sen. He couldn’t
even make out her body within the chaos.</p>
<p>A scary storm was coming for Han Sen’s body. The wind of that
storm was like a flurry of sharp weapons that could shred the
fabric of space.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was cut to pieces within seconds.</p>
<p>“Is that all it took to bring Han Sen down?” Shadow emerged from
her artificial typhoon, and after seeing Han Sen’s body in bloody
bits, she laughed darkly.</p>
<p>The next second, though, Shadow froze. Han Sen’s shattered body
disappeared into thin air. Shadow knew that was bad, but the
realization came too late. Han Sen’s face appeared in front of her,
and he threw a punch into her belly.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The punch that slammed into Shadow’s stomach sent her soaring
through the air. Although she had the protection of wind, she was
still frozen solid by Han Sen’s ice. Before her descent was
complete, she was an ice sculpture.</p>
<p>Thunder’s jaw went slack when he saw what had happened, but he
didn’t slow his approach. When he got close enough to Han Sen, he
used his King area.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning boomed and struck in the immediate
proximity, covering all corners of the area. Han Sen was suddenly
surrounded by a furious storm, and his body was drowning amidst the
thunder.</p>
<p>Pure attacking areas were the easiest to deal with, but they
were also the hardest to deal with.</p>
<p>Pure physical attacks were easy enough if you could block them,
but if they were used against someone who was weak to their
element, they could be extremely deadly. There was no middle ground
against something like this. Inside the radius of that area, there
was nowhere to run. Han Sen could only use his own body to fight
back what came his way.</p>
<p>“That thunder area isn’t the strongest I’ve seen, but Thunder
himself is half-deified. Han Sen, on the other hand, has only just
become a King. He can’t have moved beyond the first or second
tiers. Han Sen won’t last long within an area that powerful,” a
King said, as he watched the video.</p>
<p>After he said that, though, a hole was torn straight through the
thunder area. Han Sen came out from that ocean of electricity with
lightning snapping and crackling all around him. It didn’t touch
his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding a spike of lightning. He ran in front of
Thunder and tried to stab him with the spike.</p>
<p>Thunder was holding a spiral of electricity. He lifted the bolt
of pure lightning to collide with Han Sen. But when the lightning
touched Han Sen, it looked as if the lightning itself had actually
been electrified. He almost dropped the lightning spiral.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s left hand punched Thunder in the chest. Thunder was
immediately sent flying. His body quickly became another icy statue
like the others.</p>
<p>In minutes, Barr, Shadow, and Thunder—three King elites—had been
frozen stiff by Han Sen. They were all shocked.</p>
<p>The two other Kings who had come after Han Sen were shocked, as
well. They were eighth or ninth-tier Kings. They weren’t as
talented as Barr, or half-deified like Shadow and Thunder. If those
three powerful people had already been frozen by Han Sen, they
wouldn’t dare compound their mistake by trying to fight Han Sen
themselves.</p>
<p>They turned around to run, but it was too late. Han Sen flashed
by them. Both of the areas emitted by those Kings were broken, and
they were turned into ice statues just like Barr and the
others.</p>
