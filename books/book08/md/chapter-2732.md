  Bzzt!

Before they could figure out what was happening, a shadow rose from the spring water. A watery manifestation of an old, giant beast appeared.

The beast was enormous and prehistorically scary. It had two heads, and four wings spread from its back. The moment it appeared, it roared to the sky. The deafening noise of its roar echoed throughout the hall.

“A two-headed demon dragon? Why are we seeing one of these old monsters? The crystallizer’s bloodline can’t have any links to a two-headed demon dragon.” Li Chun Qiu stared at the creature he was seeing in shock. His head was filled to the brim with questions.

Before he could find any answers to those questions, the image of the two-headed demon dragon disappeared. A second later, another creature rose from the pool.

Its shape was huge but elegant, like some ancient bird from legend. It flapped its wings as it rose from the water. It flew around the Good Fortune Pool and released a hawklike cry.

“God phoenix…” Li Chun Qiu had practiced the Very High Sense to an extreme degree, but his face was still turning white. He could no longer keep his heart calm.

Han Sen hadn’t triggered one vision; he had activated two. It was difficult to believe.

The two-headed demon dragon and the god phoenix were old xenogeneics. Their bloodlines had long since gone extinct, and it would be difficult to find any trace of them left in the universe. Even if some remnant of their presence lingered in the universe, surely it wouldn’t be found in a crystallizer, of all beings.

Li Chun Qiu couldn’t imagine how Han Sen had been able to trigger the visions of those two majestic xenogeneics, but whatever was happening obviously wasn’t finished yet. When the image of the god phoenix faded, the Good Fortune Pool was still being rocked by wave after wave. Another image appeared.

Shale was frozen now. He had the bloodline of the Lion, and it had been incredibly lucky that he was able to trigger the Lionhead Lion vision in the Good Fortune Pool.

Han Sen was just a crystallizer, but he had managed to trigger three visions of old creatures. It was hard to believe that their eyes weren’t playing tricks on them.

Even more frightening was the fact that the visions kept appearing. The xenogeneics were appearing casually one after another, as if this was a daily occurrence. It made the skies above the Good Fortune Pool look like a zoo.

Li Chun Qiu and Shale stood before the pool, frozen in place. They stared at the unfolding visions, stupefied. Their brains weren’t functioning anymore.

They couldn’t form logical thoughts about what they were seeing. They couldn’t imagine why the Good Fortune Pool was displaying so many grand visions. These creatures couldn’t have been related to the crystallizer inside the pool. How could they all be showing up because of Han Sen, who was from a weak race?

Han Sen didn’t have any idea what was going on, either. His deified genes had reached 100 now. After his god body evolved, the visions appeared deep in the Good Fortune Pool, then rushed past him and vanished over his head. Each time, Han Sen felt something strange in his body get peeled away.

There was a phantom sensation deep within Han Sen, one that he could barely even sense. He felt something peeling away inside him, but it didn’t seem to affect him. And when those weird visions appeared, they made the gene powers in his body purer. The changes within him accelerated.

Han Sen could only think in his heart, “The creatures in the sanctuaries were crafted from the xenogeneic blood of those in the universe, and I ate a lot of creature flesh in my time there. I claimed their genes to make myself stronger. Maybe it’s their blood that is being affected on some level. My time in the sanctuaries left some remnants of those creatures’ blood genes. When the god body evolves, it triggers those small gene messages. Is that how these weird visions are appearing?”

Han Sen thought that his guess sounded reasonable, but he didn’t know if it was the truth. He didn’t have time to confirm the validity of this theory, either. As he reached the end of this train of thought, his body had reached the most important moment of evolution. He didn’t have time for anything else.

Changes began to flow through Han Sen’s flesh, flipping his world on its head. It was like every cell within him was being reborn. It made his body become as pure as a newborn baby’s. There was nothing about him that wasn’t new and clean.

But Han Sen didn’t hear his god body finish evolving. His body stopped evolving, and the four geno arts inside him started to run.

The Blood-Pulse Sutra, the Dongxuan Sutra, Jadeskin, and The Story of Genes; those four geno arts were running inside Han Sen’s body at the same time. His mouth went dry in shock.

There were many aspects of these four geno arts that were the same. If they ran simultaneously, there could be a conflict. It might even mess up his qi. In a worst-case scenario, Han Sen’s body might even collapse.

But despite his worries, the four geno arts ran smoothly on their own, and Han Sen’s body seemed unaffected. There was no conflict or clashes between them.

The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Jadeskin were xenogeneic powers. They affected the cells of his entire body. The changes they wrought on Han Sen were thorough and strange.

But the focus and purpose of the two skills were different from each other. Although both of them affected Han Sen’s cells, the Blood-Pulse Sutra had a heightened focus on one’s blood and organs. Jadeskin directed its power into a person’s bones.

Under the influence of those two powers, Han Sen’s whole body was unleashing its deified potential. Many illusory substance chains were forming across Han Sen’s body.

The Dongxuan Sutra and The Story of Genes were the powers of gene armaments. They affected Han Sen’s body, but the biggest changes came from the armaments themselves.

The Dongxuan Armor and Spell changed quickly, releasing substance chains as they did.

These two substance chains were clearly different from one another. The substance chains of the Dongxuan Armor were black. The formation of each link in the chain was very complicated, as if the chain represented every law of nature that governed the universe.

Spell’s substance chain was white. Somehow, it seemed to be completely independent of the rules of the universe. It existed on its own, devoid of any attachment that might weigh it down. Aside from Spell’s connection with Han Sen, it was like it was outside the universe.

As the four geno arts kept changing, Han Sen’s body started to change, too. His body became a xenogeneic gene. He looked like a scary, humanoid xenogeneic.

Just as the four geno arts were about to finish evolving, when he was about to become deified, he suddenly felt the power of the four geno arts overtake his body. It created a conflict.

Pff!

Han Sen coughed up blood. The cells of his whole body were crushed under the conflicting force of four different powers. He could barely withstand the pressure, and his power twisted painfully. The four powers that had almost become deified were now gone. The substance chains that had almost formed had now collapsed.
