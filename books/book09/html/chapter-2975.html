<p>Yet, Human King knew about Littleflower, and he knew a lot about
him. Nine-Life Cat represented Blood Legion and was a mascot for
them. It made Han Sen start to think of many things.</p>
<p>Human King weirdly looked at Han Sen asked, “Do you want to know
about the relationship between me and Old Cat?”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded but did not say anything.</p>
<p>Human King laughed to himself. “To be honest with you, I am just
like you. We are the failures that were abandoned by Old Cat.”</p>
<p>“I do not understand what you mean,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Old Cat was the guardian of the sanctuaries,” Human King coldly
said. “Without his help, do you think the crystallizers would have
been able to hide in the sanctuaries for good? I even wondered
that. With the crystallizers sharing Qin Xiu’s blood and escaping
to the sanctuaries to do all kinds of research, everything that
happened involved Old Cat and Qin Xiu. Perhaps it was Qin Xiu who
was trying to find his heir.”</p>
<p>After that, Human King looked at Han Sen. He went on to say,
“You and I are the failures Old Cat has been watching over the
years. He gave up. Only your son Littleflower was approved by Old
Cat. He became Qin Xiu’s heir.”</p>
<p>Han Sen now understood what Human King meant. Simply said, Human
King was just like him. They had Old Cat’s help and attention, but
they were not selected by him.</p>
<p>Human King squinted his eyes as he peered at Han Sen. It looked
like he was smiling, but he was not smiling. “You should not think
that being an ancestor of Qin Xiu is a good thing. It is actually
the opposite. If Qin Xiu dared to choose my son as an ancestor, I
would do all in my power to rip him apart and destroy all that
remained of his petty factions.”</p>
<p>What Human King said was something Han Sen was in total
agreement with, but he still wanted to know why Human King felt
that way. Therefore, he asked, “Why?”</p>
<p>“He took my son and sent my son to die,” Human King coldly said.
“That is enough of a reason for me to kill his entire family 10,000
times over.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying Qin Xiu’s plan would not work?” Han Sen quietly
asked. He understood what that meant.</p>
<p>“If he succeeded, Sacred would not be what it is today.” Human
King looked at Han Sen. “Don’t you have the holy spirit of that
Kirin Qin Xiu made? What do you think of that Kirin’s holy spirit
power?”</p>
<p>“It is very strong,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Really?” Human King’s smile grew deeper. “You should use that
holy Kirin spirit that you said is very strong to strike me as hard
as you can. I want to see how strong Qin Xiu’s stuff is.”</p>
<p>“Sure, if you don’t mind that.” Han Sen pulled out his cause
karma knife and summoned the holy Kirin’s holy spirit on it.</p>
<p>The Kirin’s holy spirit possessed a blade. It was possible for
it to be anything, as long as it was a weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to know how strong Human King was, so he was not
going to deny Human King’s request. He also knew Human King had
suggested this as a way for him to gauge Han Sen’s strength. So,
there was no use denying him.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Human King. The holy light on the blade was
strong. It was like a demon flame that flickered.</p>
<p>Human King was still sitting on the throne. He observed Han Sen
and his knife with interest.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry…” Han Sen slashed Human King like mad. The knife
light was like some laser that could split a world. It came right
before Human King.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Human King did not move. Even his face remained the same. He
continued to sit where he was. Somehow, his hand appeared beneath
the knife. His middle finger and index finger captured Han Sen’s
cause karma knife. That scary knife light was immediately broken by
his very powerful fingers.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s expression changed. Although he had not used all of
his strength with that slash, it was still at about 70%. Despite
that, the holy Kirin’s scary power was able to kill a top-class
true god xenogeneic. It could not, however, beat Human King’s two
fingers.</p>
<p>Human King let his fingers go and looked at Han Sen. “You are
being too polite. If it was me, I would strike as hard as I
could.”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen was able to say anything, Human King asked, “What
do you think of my power?”</p>
<p>“It’s very strong.” Han Sen used only those words to describe it
because he could not yet gauge just how strong he was.</p>
<p>“My power is still not as strong as Qin Xiu. Considering the
thing Qin Xiu wanted to do back then, do you think this holy
spirit, which Qin Xiu himself did not know if it was a success or
not, was something he could do? In the end, the heir he selected
was just a test. They were lab rats whose sole purpose was for
testing.” Human King spoke with a look of disdain.</p>
<p>“Hang on… Why is your power…” Han Sen felt Human King’s power
was better than most people at true god class. He felt as if he was
no weaker than Moment God.</p>
<p>“Why are my powers stronger than a true god?” Human King laughed
and looked at Han Sen. “You should know the answer. Because Qin Xiu
had blue blood genes, for humans to be better than a sky full of
races, you need what it takes to battle God Spirits. If you are
willing to, I can make you a member of the blue bloods. For you, it
means you can become stronger. You would be much stronger than you
are now. You might end up as strong as Qin Xiu was back then.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak. He silently rejected Human King’s offer.
That offer seemed tempting, but there were many things he wished to
figure out first.</p>
<p>If blue-blood genes were that powerful, Qin Xiu would not
lose.</p>
<p>Thinking about that from a different perspective, if Qin Xiu
thought his blood could overcome God Spirits, why did he not seek
to continue his bloodline?</p>
<p>Even if he could not make babies, with Sacred’s technology, they
could copy the genes of Qin Xiu. That would not have been difficult
to do.</p>
<p>Yet, Qin Xiu had not done that, and there had to be a reason for
it.</p>
<p>“Telling me all these secrets cannot be the sole purpose for
seeking me out. What do you want me to do for you?” Han Sen still
had not figured out why Human King had called him there.</p>
<p>“You do not have to do anything for me,” Human King coldly said.
“You are human. Your sons and daughters are humans. So, my child,
no matter whether you are willing to or not, you and I will be the
same. Go against the God Spirits and do whatever you think it is we
must do. There is no need for me to request anything.”</p>
<p>Han Sen still did not understand. Due to the fact Qin Xiu wanted
to destroy god palaces and kill God Spirits, the God Spirits wanted
to erase Qin Xiu’s bloodline.</p>
<p>That logic seemed to make sense, but Han Sen thought there was a
problem somewhere. He just couldn’t figure out what the problem
was.</p>
<p>“I asked you here to remind you, my child, that you cannot trust
Qin Xiu. You cannot rely on the relics of his past. Maintain your
crystallizer identity. No matter what happens, tell no one about
your true identity. You need to do that to live longer and have
more chances.” Human King looked serious.</p>
