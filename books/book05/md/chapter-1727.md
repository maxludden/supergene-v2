  A train’s horn cracked the air, while powerful aircraft flew through the sky above.

Han Sen was a little confused when it came to Kate technology. You could see old steam trains, but you could also see nuclear-fueled aircraft. Some people even rode creatures on the street.

It was bewildering to witness the great mix of technology that co-existed.

Han Sen scoured the internet to learn more about Kate’s history. He knew Kate wasn’t very well-developed because they had been invaded a few times, and much of their technology was leftover from other cultures. That was one of the primary factors that contributed to the mix of different technologies.

The Kate people had only had their liberty for a few dozen years. It wasn’t too long ago that they had been ruled by outsiders.

Qiao’s red ladybug car came to a stop before the abandoned factory. Qiao and Lan Se’s faces darkened.

A big truck was parked in front of the factory, and a few aircraft circled the airspace. It looked like someone had beaten them there.

“It’s Black Gold Group.” Qiao saw the symbol on the truck and frowned.

Lan Se frowned and said, “Weird. Why are they here? No one else should know, except for the members of security.”

Qiao looked disappointed and said, “With Black Gold’s power, it’s not a surprise they can grab information like this.”

As they discussed this, two people dismounted an armored truck and approached them.

Han Sen noticed that the approaching figures weren’t strangers. It was Hardman and his secretary, Lena.

Hardman walked to the car and knocked on the window.

Qiao rolled the windows down, and with a smug and boastful face, Hardman immediately said, “Qiao, are you interested in the xenogeneic here? It is a shame you are late.”

After that, Hardman glanced at Han Sen but did not say anything.

“It looks like you haven’t got what you came for, though. That means it isn’t too late. Sorry, we’re in a rush. Can’t talk.” Qiao started up the car and drove past the truck.

Hardman didn’t try to stop them. He just looked at the car and laughed. “They are for real! Qiao really thinks that Han Sen has what it takes to kill a xenogeneic?”

“Like she said; they are in a rush. Desperate people will do anything.” Lena laughed, too.

Hardman shook his head and returned to the armored truck. Guris was inside commanding the operation.

Lan Se observed the soldiers situated all around, and her heart sank. “It looks like we won’t have the slightest chance. Black Gold employs far too many soldiers. He’ll find it before we will.”

“Maybe they won’t, and maybe it’s a good thing.” Qiao’s eyes went bright, and she sped up. “Sit tight. We are going to find the xenogeneic.”

The car kicked up dust while speeding ahead.

“How does Qiao know where to go?” Lena asked in surprise. She watched the car through Black Gold’s cameras.

“Qiao is a smart woman. Although I tried to position my soldiers to mislead her, she still found it. They used us to find the xenogeneic,” Guris said.

Hardman said coldly, “It’s fine. Let them go first. Tell Mister Tiger to wait outside instead of going in.”

Guris frowned and said, “Manager Hard, it would be great to get an easy kill. But Qiao and Han Sen aren’t a threat that we should take simply.”

“Commander Guris, you worry too much. Even if we gave them the xenogeneic on a platter, they wouldn’t be able to kill it. Let them be our pawns to lure out this xenogeneic. It is better not to sacrifice our own soldiers,” Lena said.

“Do what I say. With Mister Tiger here, the xenogeneic will not reveal itself. It is better to let them die than our soldiers,” Hardman said.

Guris did not respond any further. He relayed the plan to the team and Mister Tiger.

“Qiao, are you certain this is the way? The people of Black Gold aren’t over here.” Lan Se scanned the surroundings quickly.

“It must be here. Their little sham isn’t fooling me.” Qiao also looked around, while picking up even more speed. The car was leaving huge clouds of dust behind them.

Aside from the abandoned factories in the area, there was a closed mine. They drove the car inside.

Pang!

They had only just driven in when a loud noise sounded above them. The ceiling was caving in, almost crushing the back of the car.

Qiao and Lan Se were in the front of the car. They pushed their doors open and scrambled out. They looked up and saw a silver-haired, three-meter tall ape dropping down on the roof of the car. It jumped up and down repeatedly, crushing the ladybug car. The fuel tank eventually ruptured and exploded, but the explosion didn’t even singe the beast’s fur.

Qiao and Lan Se were incredibly worried about Han Sen, because he was still in the back of the car. And amidst the attack, they had no idea what had happened to him.

“Good stomping. Let Mister Tiger strike!” Hardman had watched what occurred through a drone’s camera. He was laughing his head off.

“Mister Tiger, we have a lock on the target. You can go now!” Guris told Mister Tiger.

They confirmed the big, silver ape was inside the mine. A few soldiers had gone there previously to scope the place out, but all contact with them had been lost. They had yet to be found.

Now Han Sen had done them a favor by luring the xenogeneic into action. And now that it was in their sights, Mister Tiger was running over. He was only a mile away.

Hardman was still laughing, watching the battlefield. He loved nothing more than taking advantage of the work of others.

Qiao and Lan Se then saw Han Sen exit what was left of the car. That brought them a feeling of safety. Seeing him emerge in one piece was quite relieving

The silver ape saw Han Sen and grabbed hold of the wreckage of the car. He threw it at Han Sen.

Han Sen moved quickly, evading the car. The car flipped end over end until it was stopped by a warehouse, which promptly collapsed.

The silver ape roared and jumped towards Han Sen with blinding speed.

Han Sen went forward, going right for the ape. His eyes were calm like well water.

The Rhino Horn Dagger was in his hand, but he didn’t unsheathe it His right hand grasped the handle as he went for the ape.

“Kid, this is my prey!” Mister Tiger was already in the mine, sounding excited.
