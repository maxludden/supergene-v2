	<p>As the blue crystal tentacle reached for the male Feather, a golden light shone down. It was a gold arrow,
		perforating the crystal tentacle.</p>

	<p>This golden arrow was different from the others. A strange power carried it down with the force of a drillhead.
		It drilled right into the tentacle, until half of its shaft was driven in.</p>

	<p>When the tentacle was frozen after the attack, the male Feather reached for the creature’s head. He drew his
		golden lance and shoved it right in.</p>

	<p>The Feather then pulled back on his lance, and he picked up the entire beast with it. The beast eventually fell
		back down into 什le Black River, creating a crater.</p>

	<p>The monster was still alive, struggling for life, but it was heavily damaged. The two Feathers were able to
		finish it off quickly.</p>

	<p>Hardman and Guris were done for, though. The tentacles had already tightened around the two Kate men, breaking
		their armor and bones. Their bodies were disfigured and torn.</p>

	<p>Han Sen frowned, even though he was used to witnessing death.</p>

	<p>Mister Tiger was saved, fortunately. He came out of the river, looking back at their dead bodies. His expression
		seemed saddened.</p>

	<p>The female Feather flew over to the dead xenogeneic, pulled out a knife, and cut off the blue crystal tentacle.
	</p>

	<p>The male Feather came right before Han Sen, instead. He asked coldly, “I told you to get in the water. Did you
		not hear me?”</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at him but didn’t speak. Mister Tiger swiftly came over, though, saying, “Sir, he wasn’t
		disobeying your order. It is all because the baby is here. He is afraid of bringing her harm.”</p>

	<p>“Right,” the male Feather said darkly. He pulled out his lance and pointed it at Bao’er, who was perched on Han
		Sen’s shoulder, and growled, “Let me teach you how to be the lesser race that you are. You will never hesitate
		again.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen was so angry. He turned around and used his Rhino Horn Dagger to knock the lance away.</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>The dagger and the lance sparked in their collision, and the two wielders stumbled back.</p>

	<p>The male Feather’s face changed. Mister Tiger and the female Feather looked at the pair in shock.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had geno armor. He was regarded as no more than a commoner. He wasn’t even a Noble, so it was strange
		that he had enough strength to knock back a Feather.</p>

	<p>“We don’t have a grudge against you, so why are you doing this?” Han Sen calmly asked, as he clutched the Rhino
		Horn Dagger.</p>

	<p>The male Feather hummed in growing anger. “Just because you have some modicum of power, it doesn’t mean you can
		disobey a Feather. And if I don’t kill you right now, how can I assert rule and superiority?”</p>

	<p>After that, the male Feather swung his golden lance and tried to strike Han Sen down. He was using all his power
		in a bid to kill the upstart pest.</p>

	<p>Han Sen remained calm. After the last hit, he could guess what was coming.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t have a geno weapon, but after his blood leveled up to become xenogeneic, he had the right amount
		of strength to challenge the Feather. His body’s power was no worse than the Feather’s.</p>

	<p>Seeing the lance descending toward his chest, Han Sen merely stepped to the side to dodge the strike. Then he
		stepped right near the male Feather, raised his dagger, and pressed it against the Feather’s neck.</p>

	<p>The male Feather was in shock. He could not believe he had given Han Sen the opportunity to get so close. He’d be
		unable to block the dagger now. Han Sen’s move was way too good. It was beyond his wildest expectations.</p>

	<p>The Feather felt as if he had suddenly gone up against someone who wasn’t an ordinary human. He seemed superior
		to all else in his race.</p>

	<p>A gold arrow suddenly flew towards Han Sen, aimed at his temple. The female Feather wanted to get him away and
		save her companion.</p>

	<p>The dagger in Han Sen’s hand did not move, though. All he did was swing his head back and forth to catch the
		arrow with his teeth. Then, he used the dagger to slit the Feather’s throat.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s crystal blood melted within his vessels, filling him like lava. The vessels twisted and contorted like
		snakes. The additional power was enough to drive the dagger deeper through the neck, completely decapitating the
		Feather. The sheer force of the blow sent the head up into the sky.</p>

	<p>Mister Tiger and the female Feather looked on in absolute shock. No one could believe that a commoner, with only
		geno armor, could manage to kill a Feather Baron. Especially since two Feathers had been present He was too
		f*cking fast.</p>

	<p>Mister Tiger opened his mouth. He thought he was dreaming.</p>

	<p>“How dare you kill a Feather!” the female Feather screamed, then fired another arrow at Han Sen. All those golden
		arrows were nothing more than raindrops to him, though.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was still biting the first arrow, and electricity surged through his eyes. He dodged each and every
		arrow, nearing her with his dagger raised. He looked at her with murder.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had already slain one, so it was not as if he could leave a witness. If the other Feathers knew what had
		happened,</p>

	<p>he wouldn’t be able to stay where he was or in any nearby system, for that matter.</p>

	<p>The female Feather was confident in her arrows, but despite the storm of attacks she released, they couldn’t
		strike Han Sen once.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body was as fast as a snake. The female Feather was unable to predict where he would move next, and she
		missed each and every shot.</p>

	<p>Seeing Han Sen only ten meters away from her, the female Feather flapped her wings with the desire to escape from
		him. Han Sen lifted his dagger and flew up with her, though. She was the only thing in his eyes, right now.</p>

	<p>“Damn!” The female Feather flapped her wings and flew, all the while firing her arrows.</p>

	<p>Baron-class power was not enough to fly when there was gravity, so Baron Feathers needed their wings to fly
		through the air.</p>

	<p>When the Feather saw Han Sen trying to fly after her, she thought he must have had a death wish.</p>

	<p>And when the rain of arrows came down towards Han Sen, he suddenly began acting like a strange bird. He flew
		strangely, pulling himself up through the air. He dodged each and every arrow until he was right before the
		female Feather.</p>

	<p>The female feather was enraged. She pulled out her longsword in an attempt to block his dagger, and when the
		weapons collided, the female Feather felt a huge force come against her. It blasted the longsword out of her
		hands. The dagger didn’t stop, though, and it went right for her neck.</p>

	<p>The arm that was holding the dagger turned red. The vessels inside looked like crystals as the blood inside
		boiled, pumping power into the dagger.</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>The dagger slashed across the female Feather’s throat. A gold light came out from the neck to block the raging
		hit</p>

	<p>Han Sen frowned. A feather necklace suddenly appeared on the Feather’s neck. It was hanging low against her
		chest, shining with a golden light It was that gold feather pendant that had blocked Han Sen’s strike.</p>
