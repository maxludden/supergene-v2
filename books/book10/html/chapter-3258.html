<p>When she saw the first drop of blood going in and getting closer
to the ice jade evil lady’s forehead, Tian Jing’s heart rate
started to rise.</p>
<p>As time went by, the drop of blood was able to touch the skin of
the ice jade evil lady’s forehead. It enabled Tian Jing to see the
blood and ice jade evil lady’s skin combine. It formed a strange
connection.</p>
<p>“I did it… I got the ice jade evil lady…” Tian Jing felt the
connection grow deeper. She was excited. She realized she had just
earned this super unique gene race.</p>
<p>Although she was excited, Tian Jing felt her heart suddenly
ache. She coughed up blood as the connection with the ice jade evil
lady was suddenly severed.</p>
<p>“How could that happen? It succeeded. How could it be? Is my
nine-Yin rare pulse not Yin and cold enough?” Tian Jing asked aloud
while opening her eyes. She saw half of her blood blend into the
ice jade evil lady’s skin and then get thrown away from the ice
jade evil lady’s forehead. Suddenly, it was cast out of the gene
egg, speckling the white snow of the snowy mountain.</p>
<p>As Tian Jing wondered why this was happening, the ice egg moved.
It started to roll down the hill.</p>
<p>Tian Jing did not know what had just happened. She pondered why
the ice egg was so willing to move. It was far too weird.</p>
<p>Tian Jing forced the blood that was in her chest to not spill
and steeled herself to run down the mountain to get to a point that
was below the rolling ice egg.</p>
<p>The ice egg did not roll quickly. When it reached the halfway
point of the hill, she saw someone approach the ice mountain.</p>
<p>The man’s face was quite manly, but he was very pretty. He was
so pretty that many women would feel ashamed of themselves. Judging
from his face, Tian Jing could not really apply a name to the
person. Seeing a little girl and a small cat on the man’s
shoulders, Tian Jing was suddenly able to realize the beautiful man
was no other than Han Sen. He was supposedly in the throes of the
bad power.</p>
<p>“He really did dare to come here,” Tian Jing said with
shock.</p>
<p>The closer they were to the snow mountain, the more affected the
man should have been. Han Sen was already very close to the snow
mountain. According to the old leader, when a man reached there,
they should have become a complete woman.</p>
<p>Despite being way too handsome right now, Han Sen’s face was
distinctly in possession of the Yang power that defined men. He was
not a complete woman.</p>
<p>“Did the ice egg move for him?” Tian Jing had that wretched idea
in her head.</p>
<p>Tian Jing had to swiftly deny it. The ice jade evil lady could
only be claimed by a woman with a cold Yin Blood-Pulse. Han Sen was
not a woman. He did not have the Yin cold Blood-Pulse. He could not
take command of the ice jade evil lady, so how could he make the
ice egg leave the ice mountain?</p>
<p>Tian Jing saw that the ice egg was indeed flying straight toward
Han Sen. When Han Sen almost reached the snow mountain, the ice egg
was only nine feet away from him. It was flying to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Impossible… This is impossible…” Tian Jing could not believe
this had just happened. The ice jade evil lady should not have been
moving toward a man. It was bewildering for her to even entertain
the thought. She did not think it was possible.</p>
<p>Yet, the ice egg had indeed come to a standstill before Han Sen.
It was one outstretched arm’s distance away from him.</p>
<p>“Is this the ice jade evil lady?” Han Sen looked at the ice egg
in front of him with shock. He could guess what was inside the ice
egg, but he was just wondering why the ice jade evil lady gene egg
would fall from the mountain and roll in front of him.</p>
<p>He delayed doing anything for a long time. He used the combined
powers provided by Spell, which made him no longer feel what the
bad powers could do to him. Since it had been so long, he thought
Tian Jing would have already claimed the ice jade evil lady by now.
He had only gone there now to test his luck.</p>
<p>Who would have guessed there was this weird scene? The ice jade
evil lady egg fell down the mountain and rolled right to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out his hand and put it on the ice egg. He
wanted to see if it was a real gene egg. When his fingertip just
touched the ice egg, he touched the center of the egg to make
cracks develop across the surface like spider webs. They kept
spreading across the ice egg.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The ice egg broke. Ice light went everywhere like a sky full of
stars. Within that ice light, the ice jade evil lady’s body
appeared.</p>
<p>Her white clothes were like snow. Her hair was like ice and
silk. Her skin was snow white. She was so pretty. One could imagine
people suffocating in her presence. Everything was so amazing to
behold and witness. Han Sen looked upon the ice jade evil lady. The
ice jade evil lady’s half-closed eyes were now fully open. Her eyes
were like cold gemstones peering back at Han Sen. “Give me a drop
of your blood,” the ice jade evil lady said to him. Her voice was
so clear that it was like water running by Han Sen’s ears.</p>
<p>When Tian Jing heard that from the position far behind, she was
frozen stiff. It was as if she had been struck by a bolt of
lightning. “Why would I give you a drop of my blood?” Han Sen
looked at the ice jade evil lady with interest. She was nothing
normal, that was for sure. Ordinary gene races could not compare to
her. Even for rare gene races, this creature was rare.</p>
<p>It was very rare for rare gene races to be born with such
incredible intelligence.</p>
<p>“Because you want me to become your gene race,” the ice jade
evil lady coldly said. “Isn’t that enough of a reason?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It is enough.” Han Sen looked at the ice jade evil lady.
He nodded and put out his finger. He squeezed out a drop of
blood.</p>
<p>The ice jade evil lady reached out for Han Sen’s blood. She
carefully took the droplet and applied it to her forehead. The
blood went inside her. A red dot formed on the ice jade evil lady’s
forehead. It made the ice jade evil lady’s body glow with a strange
god light. “How is that possible?” Tian Jing thought she must have
been having a nightmare. The ice jade evil lady was going forward
to ask a man to take her as his gene race. How tough was this to
believe? It had her flip a lid and throw the world she knew on its
head.</p>
<p>“I thought only pure women would be approved by the ice jade
evil lady. I thought when men got close to the ice jade evil lady,
only bad things would come to pass. I thought only a woman with an
extreme Yin and extremely cold Blood – Pulse would be the one
allowed to claim the ice jade evil lady.” Tian Jing’s head was
riddled with a thousand questions, but she had no answers for any
of them.</p>
<p>As Tian Jing was watching this unfold, the ice jade evil lady
became an ice light. She went into Han Sen’s soul, becoming a gene
race for Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Annihilation God Spirit gene race claimed: ice jade evil
lady.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head played that familiar announcement. It gave him a
shock. “What is this ice jade evil lady? Right of the bat, she is a
born God Spirit gene race that is Annihilation class.”</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly went to check out the information he had on the
ice jade evil lady and recognized her progress was juvenile. Even
so, her level put her as an Annihilation God Spirit gene race.</p>
