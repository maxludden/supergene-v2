  “Where is the human?” Fallen Slaughter looked around, but there were no humans about.

“Over there!” Qing Ya called out, pointing in a specific direction.

Fallen Slaughter looked to where Qing Ya was pointing. He was aiming at a canyon, but it didn’t seem as if there would be any humans there.

“What is that place?” Fallen Slaughter frowned. He wasn’t angry at Qing Ya, and he didn’t think the human would try to trick him like some lowlife creature. The man had teleportation abilities, after all.

“I can already sense his presence. He should be here soon”, Qing Ya said, looking at the canyon.

Fallen Slaughter said nothing more. He looked at the canyon, and after a while, he began to feel a lifeforce approaching. Before long, he saw the figure of a human running toward them.

“He is Han Sen.” Qing Ya pointed at Han Sen, who had now emerged from the valley.

“Good. Fallen Slaughter’s eyes fixed themselves on Han Sen. His body rippled with dark fire as a limitless cascade of flames wreathed his hands. He sent a major blast flying towards Han Sen, who was emerging from the valley.

The power was carried by black smoke, and it resembled a demonic-looking dragon flying through the air. The attack filled the entire canyon, for Fallen Slaughter wanted Han Sen to be blown to smithereens in a single strike. One hit, no further problems.

His target was just a human, so Fallen Slaughter did not think much of him. Truth be told, he cared little for spirits or creatures, either. As an elite creature of the dark element, he was practically at the top of the food chain.

If that strike landed, even the mightiest of super creatures would end up crippled.

Han Sen just kept moving steadily out of the valley, however. He saw the demonic blast headed his way like a demon with its maw gaping open, and he thought to himself, “What horrible creature’s territory lies up ahead? This is annoying.”

But Han Sen did not have much time to think, as he was not in super king spirit mode anymore. Lately, he’d mostly just been using his super king spirit as a disguise.

The test Lin Feng did before, although it couldn’t save Han Sen, made him realize one thing: power still worked on him, he just couldn’t change direction. So, when the demonic blast came, Han Sen flapped his wings and threw a punch at it.

That punch was not aimed at going against the blast; he used the Yin Yang Blast technique to bounce himself into the air and avoid it.

Han Sen stepped atop the demonic blast, which then came below him. The blast struck the creatures that were in pursuit of him.

Boom!

The boom of the explosion as the power unleashed flattened the valley on both sides.

Fallen Slaughter bounced back a few hundred meters through the air. Blood dripped from his mouth, and he looked shocked. He did not know of anyone who could go up against his power and not wind up damaged.

He looked to the valley and his face changed. The group of horrible creatures now looked like a horde of zombies swarming toward him. They all seemed to be disturbingly powerful.

Although the creatures would be unable to deal damage to Fallen Slaughter individually, there were too many of the fiends to ignore.

Fallen Slaughter could definitely take on three of them. It’d be a struggle if there were five. And it’d be flat-out impossible if there were ten. But there was more than that; there were a few dozen of them. And the sight of that mass actually made him frightened.

The scary creatures had managed to block Fallen Slaughter’s strike. They were enraged, believing he was helping Han Sen. And all the horrible powers and geno cores were now descending upon him.

Han Sen ran before Fallen Slaughter and swung the Split-Blade towards him.

Fallen Slaughter believed the creatures were actually there to back Han Sen up. He was scared, and he didn’t dare fight the human. Instead, he dodged Han Sen’s attack and took off running.

His speed was much slower than Han Sen’s, however, because he was a creature that focused on strength. He was still able to dodge, though, and he kept doing so as he tried to escape. He just couldn’t gain a lead due to the differences in speed, and Han Sen always winded up behind him.

The attacks from the creatures behind also ended up falling on Fallen Slaughter.

Fallen Slaughter roared madly as the demonic aura of his body fired on all cylinders. His body changed into black metal like some ancient demon.

Boom!

Two horrible forces collided, and Fallen Slaughter found himself flying away. The more powerful creatures were merely stunned. Blood was drawn from the weaker ones, however.

Fallen Slaughter had already proven himself a good fighter, almost countering all those creatures by himself.

After all, all the wretched creatures there were being reinforced by the Black Horn Dragon. Fallen Slaughter had proven himself incredibly powerful by not being killed by their long-distance strike.

Han Sen continued running forward. He saw Fallen Slaughter falling towards him, though, as his body cracked and streaming with blood. He looked heavily injured.

Then Han Sen had a greedy thought next He swung his blade at the falling Fallen Slaughter and struck his back.

Split-Blade was powerful, and it had a high rank for a super geno core. But when the blade hit Fallen Slaughter, it was only able to make an incision that was three inches deep.

Fallen Slaughter flew away again after the second hit, though. Han Sen felt depressed that the blade hadn’t killed the creature. He thought he might be able to at least earn a beast soul.

But when the Fallen Slaughter flew away, he was flying towards the creatures.

The horrible creatures had already hit him twice, and now they were very angry. They went to attack him again without any hesitation.

Boom!

Fallen Slaughter was stunned. He tried to block, but the attack was stronger than ever. His body almost shattered under the impact, and he ended up soaring across the sky like a meteor.

While Han Sen was still depressed, he saw Fallen Slaughter flying his way. It made him a very happy guy.

He stabbed Fallen Slaughter with all the strength he was able to muster.

Katcha!

Poor Fallen Slaughter was unable to figure out what had happened and what was going on. He was being tossed between two parties like a beachball. Before he could wrap his mind around what was happening, Han Sen lopped his head off.
