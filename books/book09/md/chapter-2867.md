  Han Sen thought he would have trouble getting into the top 100, but his opponent gave up. His enemy did not appear on the space battleground for their fight. Han Sen realized that killing Sky Armor God had created an interesting effect. Before figuring out who he was, even top class deified elites feared him.

Just like this round, the opponent was the top class. It was a true god class xenogeneic that was very powerful. Even he did not dare go to the space battleground to fight. These people are overestimating my abilities. But that is good. It saves me a lot of trouble. Han Sen departed the space battleground. After entering the top 100 rounds, the modes of fighting had changed. The matches were no longer simple deathmatches.

The mode of the top 100 round fights made Han Sen complain to God. “Your ranking fights are too childish. How can you choose what rank you are?”

It was no wonder Han Sen complained. The top 100 mode of fighting was strange. Every creature in the top 100 list could choose what rank they wanted to be. Each rank could only be chosen by one creature. It did not depend on who was stronger. It was all about speed. If one was fast enough, one could end up being in the top place.

When Han Sen looked at the matches, things seemed even more unreasonable. After picking a rank, every person chose the rank they wished to challenge.

If one was on the 100 list and wanted first place, one could go straight to challenge the being in first place. That challenge could only be done once. If one failed, one could not challenge any other rank. No matter how strong one was, one would still be in 100th place. Han Sen looked at God and said, “If you do this, then whoever selects first place will accept the challenges of many other creatures. For the spots that no one wants, they would not even have to have a single fight.”

“You do not understand,” God said with a smile. “That is why it is interesting. You should think about what rank you want to be. If you want to be first, just tell me. I can bend the rules for you and put you in first place.” “Thanks, but no thanks. I do not want to get ranked.” Han Sen was considering which rank he should select.

Now that he had thought about it, there were skills involved that depended on which rank he selected. Even the ones that could take first place would think about whether or not they should actually choose it. If they kept getting ganged up on, they could lose. The creatures that were just average and not top class had a better chance of getting a higher spot, which would not be outstanding. Han Sen planned to choose a spot that was not too high so it would not be outstanding. Although Han Sen’s power was not bad, and he had a god personality armament, the ones that could get into the top 100 were all true god deified. None of them would be easy to beat.

There were people like Very High Leader and Sky Palace Leader. Even if they did not have a god personality armament, they could wield true god weaponry. The

Han Sen’s target was to reach the top 100. Now, he had what he wanted. He did not plan on reaching first place.

With the reward of the ranks, the top 10 must be the most popular. God only knows how many creatures actually want them. When the list is revealed, the top 10 will be bosses. It will only be me there, who is easy to bully. I bet people will want to challenge me. The top 10 is not good for me. Han Sen watched for a while. He thought somewhere around 20 would be great.

At around 20, true gods would not like that. They would not challenge those places, and the weaker sorts would not select that ranking. Han Sen could probably select a ranking there.

At around 20, he was able to sit back and watch the fireworks. He would even have a chance to challenge the higher ranks. If he lost, rank 20 would not be so bad.

Han Sen planned on choosing a rank somewhere around 20. The best spot was 22. If he was unable to choose it, he would choose one of the others inside the 20s.

As he waited to choose his rank, Han Sen had a screen in front of him. There were 100 squares labeled one to 100. The very top had a countdown. After the timer was up, they could start taking their spot and see who got which rank first. Han Sen This God is so boring. Even a fight needs you to take rank. When the countdown was up, Han Sen clicked on the number 22 tile. When Han Sen was going to select number 22, the number 22 tile became red. Someone had already taken it.

Han Sen quickly checked out which number in the 20s was still available. He could only hear cha-cha-cha, as all the 20s became red. From 11 to 40, all the positions had been taken.

But there were still positions in the top 10 and lower that had yet to be taken.

Higher or lower? Han Sen hesitated a little. He heard “cha-cha-cha.” Most of the squares turned red. There were only three more numbers behind 95 left.

Holy shit! This is too fast. Is this a mother*cking garage sale? Han Sen felt depressed.

There was no point in choosing after 95. The rewards were similar. No one would challenge that spot, so Han Sen chose the highest one out of the last three numbers. He selected 98.

Before he raised his hand, 98 and 99 were gone. There were only 100 left.

I can challenge someone once. I will choose 100.” Han Sen selected the 100th square.

After confirming his position, Han Sen looked at the rankings. He noticed the one in the highest place was Golden Growler. Very High Leader was second. Lou Lie was third. Demon Alpha was fourth. A xenogeneic called Seeking Perfume Beast was fifth. Ancient God’s Ancient Sacrifice God was sixth. Extreme King’s Bai Wuchang was seventh. A xenogeneic called Empty Dragon King was eight. A xenogeneic was ninth.

Han Sen discovered the top 100 were mostly xenogeneics. The famous races of the universe were actually quite rare.

Han Sen looked through it all the way to 81. He then saw the name Zhang Xuandao.

“Sky Palace Leader is very humble. He chose such a low rank.” Han Sen was speechless. Thinking about Sky Palace Leader’s personality, it was not too strange that he had chosen that.

Han Sen looked down. When he saw number 84, he was shocked. Burning Lamp. He cannot be the Burning Lamp Alpha from the Buddha, can he? How did he get into the top 100? Han Sen was a bit surprised. As far as he knew, Burning Lamp Alpha was deified but just larva class. There was no way he had managed to get into the top 100.
