  The elites of every race knew this fight was going to end soon. Han Sen conceding was the only outcome. There was no way he could escape the attack of Sky Armor God. He could only be killed.

Sky Armor God wanted to hurry things up and be able to refine the god personality. He did not have the mood to drag this out and play games with Han Sen. Therefore, he unleashed his attack. Han Sen did not want to lose and quit the space battleground. He had been observing this for so long. Even though he had no idea what Sky Armor God’s limit was, he knew for sure that after Deep Abyss Knight combined with Sky Armor God, the body still had some of Deep Abyss Knight’s power. After combining the god personality, Deep Abyss Knight’s body was also reinforced. It was able to reach true god class. Currently, Sky Armor God was just a true god class creature. Achieving victory was not out of the question. Seeing the ripping sky and knife light in front of him, Han Sen put out his hand. A green bone lance appeared in it. He thrust it forward against the knife light.

“He is trying too hard. No matter how strong a butterfly class fighter is, he cannot fight a god spirit.” The woman in Sky Palace frowned as she spoke. Many others had the same worry. No matter how they viewed this, they all agreed that he was trying too hard.

When the spear hit the knife light, people were shocked to find out the lance light was able to pierce through the knife light. It looked like the northern lights. The body and lance teleported in front of Sky Armor God. It was being thrust into Sky Armor God’s arm that was holding the scabbard. Sky Armor God did not expect that would happen. It was too late for him to stop. He used the armor of his arm to block.

Katcha!

Sky Armor God paid the price because of his pride and ignorance. The green light pierced through the armor and drilled into him. The entire head of the lance was being thrust through. It penetrated Sky Armor God’s gauntlet and arm.

Sky Armor God was in pain. He could not hold the scabbard tightly. Han Sen was able to grab it back. His body was in extreme shock, so he started to stumble back.

Seeing Sky Armor God’s arm with god blood bleeding out of it, even Sky Palace Leader and Bai King were incredibly shocked. They could not help but look at Han Sen’s Sky Radish Bone Lance. “It is a god personality armament.” Sky Armor God looked ill. He stared at the Sky Radish Bone Lance in Han Sen’s hands. In the wound on his arm, green saplings were starting to grow. This was different from Han Sen killing a xenogeneic with one hit. The saplings on Sky Armor God’s arm were growing slowly. They began as little green leaves. It looks like gods cannot completely withstand the power of a god personality armament. Han Sen made his mind up. As long as he was able to hurt the god, he had nothing to be afraid of.

“God personality armament…” Throughout the universe, many ancient and hidden elites heard Sky Armor God say those words. They were instantly in shock.

People who knew what a god personality armament also knew how difficult it was to gain a god personality armament. “It cannot be a real god personality armament,” the Sky Palace woman said with surprise. “With Dollar’s level, he does not have the power to enter the geno hall. How could he have a god personality armament?” “If the god spirit said it was a god personality armament, that is what it is. This Dollar is becoming more and more interesting,” Sky Palace Leader said while squinting his eyes. He was checking out Han Sen and the Sky Radish God Lance.

“Interesting.” Lou Lie stared at Han Sen with fire in his eyes. “A god personality armament?” Bai King looked weird. It was difficult to tell what he was thinking “How is that possible?” asked the green-haired beast. “That cannot be a real god personality armament.” In a dark corner of the world, Old Vulture and Auntie Mei had strange expressions on their faces. “Could that truly be a real god personality armament? Did Dollar enter the geno hall and kill a god spirit?”

Auntie Mei looked at Old Vulture and asked, “Have you guys seen that god personality armament? Was it left by that guy?”

“I do not think so,” old Vulture said while shaking his head. “There has never been a lance like this before.”

“If it was not from before, did he really go to the geno hall, kill a god spirit, and run? That is impossible.” Auntie Mei shook her head.

Suddenly, all the elites in the universe were staring at the Sky Radish God Lance. Their faces kept changing.

“No matter how you get your hands on a god personality armament or who you are, you must die today!” Sky Armor God stared at Han Sen. The mood to kill was almost tangible.

The purple-black flames on him were getting stronger. The saplings had only just shown up, but the flames made them stop growing. Even the scabbard in Han Sen’s hand was struggling. It wanted to fly back to Sky Armor God. Han Sen used significant strength to suppress the scabbard, which did not fly to Sky Armor God.

Boom!

Sky Armor God’s fire was like the eruption of a volcano. With that wash of power, the metal armor melted into iron juice. It was dripping across his body like a meteor shower through space that was falling.

The tentacles were dancing. Sky Armor God was coming for Han Sen. After the armor on his body slowly melted off, it revealed a powerful and naked chest. Many bones could be seen on his chest, giving him the appearance of a skeleton. The skeleton was like a purple crystal. It was startlingly clear, but it was getting deeper. It looked like the material to make a Return Empty Scabbard. Quickly, a purple outside bone armor was floating on Sky Armor God’s chest. It protected his chest.

The bone armor looked exactly like two purple ribs together. There were seven rib bones on each side. It looked very symmetric, but the left side was missing one bone.

“This guy really is Sky Armor God!” When the people of the Extreme King saw the missing rib bone on the outside skeleton armor, they were able to confirm Sky Armor God’s identity. It made them all gnash their teeth.

It looks like the scabbard is made from this outside bone armor’s rib bones. Can one rib bone have that effect? If we cut both sides of the rib bone… Han Sen squinted his eyes and stared at Sky Armor God. He was not afraid of Sky Armor God exploding with power.

Bzzt!

Han Sen kept trying to suppress Return Empty Scabbard, which had a power that could not be imagined. It escaped Han Sen’s hand and flew to Sky Armor God.

Han Sen opened the palms of his hand. His hands had a wound that revealed the bones within the flesh. They were there because of the Return Empty Scabbard’s escape. Very powerful power! Han Sen thought. The Return Empty Scabbard flew back to Sky Armor God. It landed on the broken bones. It was now like another rib bone. It lined up on the armor of the outside skeleton. The broken parts were connecting, slowly becoming a part of the skeleton armor.

The scabbard bone looked a bit different than the other rib bones. After all, it had been made into a scabbard. Its original look was hard to maintain.

“Blasphemy to a god spirit. Die!” Sky Armor God appeared like a god as he looked at Han Sen. His body surged with a scary presence. The bone armor was bright. It was like it was connecting to all of space. The god’s sounds were like thunder.

“Oh, my days… What is going on…” Many creatures who did not know the truth were frozen. Sky Armor God released pressure. Even the people outside the battleground felt uncomfortable. Their foreheads developed a cold sweat.

The weaker creatures with smaller hearts were paralyzed on the floor.
