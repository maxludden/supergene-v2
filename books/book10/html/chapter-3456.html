<h2>Pressure</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3456</h3>

<p>Qin Xiu brought everyone pressure, and he was much scarier than
Human King. When Qin Xiu brought back his body, there was no
killing behavior and or anything soft. That scariness was silent,
and it was spreading. It made Huangfu Jing, Lin Feng, and the
others feel cold without being cold. Their bodies were quaking
incessantly.</p>
<p>Bao’er had not said a word ever since Qin Xiu returned. She
looked at Chaos, Han Ling’er, and the others. She drank Qin Xiu’s
blood without hesitation.</p>
<p>When she drank the blood, it was like Bao’er’s gold light was
gas being ignited. It was burning with fire, and it was burning
strong.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s body was in some gold and bright light. She kept
growing up. Her five-year-old body was growing up very fast. She
went from being a small kid to a teen, and from being a teen to
becoming a full-blown young lady. Her pupils and long hair turned
gold. She was wrapped up by a gold and crystal set of armor. She
rather looked like a Valkyrie, so cold and high-level.</p>
<p>That gold flame looked like it could destroy all the rules and
orders of the world. One could not see through it. One could only
see a high-class, gold shadow standing there.</p>
<p>Bao’er reached out her hand. Chaos, who was currently frozen in
space, was pulled by her. She pushed towards Space Garden, sending
Chaos back there.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu did not stop Bao’er from doing that. He merely watched
her in total silence.</p>
<p>“I am sorry you had to wait so long, but now we can start
fighting.” Bao’er and her gold eyes looked at Qin Xiu. She spoke
her words slowly, word by word.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu did not speak. He casually stood aloft in space. He
reached out his hand and raised it as if he was inviting Bao’er to
strike.</p>
<p>Bao’er gnashed her teeth. She was not going to play nice. She
used her hand like a knife and unleashed a strike at Qin Xiu. With
that knife, the sky and the ground seemed to be drawn by the knife.
That was Han Sen’s Under the Sky Knife skill.</p>
<p>“That is Han Sen’s Under the Sky Knife skill. You have learned
it quite well. Your proficiency with it is remarkably deep, but you
are lacking some of its presence since you are only just a girl. A
knife skill like this does not suit you.” Qin Xiu reached out the
hand. It seemed normal. It did not have any power, but it broke
Bao’er’s knife skill. Bao’er failed to cast it. She had to swap her
skill.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s knife skill changed. It was now like a fang that could
crush everything. She was casting another one of Han Sen’s skills
that was called Teeth Knife.</p>
<p>“This knife skills is, admittedly, rather interesting. It is
awfully evil too. It does not go well with your power element or
mind though.” When Qin Xiu waved his hand, he ended up breaking
Bao’er’s skill. Bao’er had only used her attack halfway before it
was shattered. She already had to swap skills.</p>
<p>Bao’er quickly cast another 10 skills in sequence, but Qin Xiu
managed to break each one of them. No skill she used actually
worked against him. Many of them had to be changed out halfway.</p>
<p>“This skill is not bad, but it is simply not strong enough. You
could be a lot crueler than this… This skill should be faster… This
skill cannot be done too fast. You have to be slow with it…” Qin
Xiu casually used one hand to break Bao’er’s skills completely, one
by one. He even pointed out every mistake Bao’er made in the
casting.</p>
<p>The fight between Qin Xiu and Bao’er was more like a senior
teaching a junior than a deathmatch.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu only broke her skills. He did not attack her. He just
broke all of her skills. Even though Bao’er had reached
Universe-class to be on par with Qin Xiu, it still looked as if
there was a big difference between the pair. It was like a child
competing with an adult.</p>
<p>“What does Qin Xiu want to do?” Light Goddess was confused by
his behavior.</p>
<p>Anyone could tell that Qin Xiu was trying to help Bao’er boost
her power. With Bao’er’s talents and potential, it was known that
if she was to make a mistake, she would never make it again. But
Qin Xiu did not kill her. He only broke her attacks and went no
further, and that was something that could make Bao’er
stronger.</p>
<p>“What a crazy and ignorant guy,” Moment God coldly said. “He
could just end the fight, but he has made his opponent stronger to
win.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s confidence was completely different from Human King’s,
but this kind of fearless confidence made people feel more hopeless
and scared than ever.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle was a bit nervous about it all. He looked in the
direction of the evolution wall and quietly said to himself,
“Bao’er is just a kid, and she has always been taken care of by Han
Sen. Her mind is still not very strong. I am afraid only Han Sen, a
man who can fully control his body, can fight Qin Xiu in his
current state. Han Sen needs to hurry up. Any longer, and he will
be too late.”</p>
<p>Bao’er followed Han Sen all the time. Han Sen never hid anything
from Bao’er. Aside from a few geno arts that needed to be started
from the very beginning, Bao’er knew them all save for a handful.
So, Bao’er could use almost all of the geno arts Han Sen had
learned.</p>
<p>The geno arts known by Huangfu Jing and the others could also be
used by Bao’er, and she could perform them just as well. Even the
geno arts owned by Moment God and other God Spirits could be used
by Bao’er easily.</p>
<p>In front of Qin Xiu, it did not matter what the skill was. It
could be broken with ease. So far, Bao’er could not use a complete
skill set. She could not even make Qin Xiu move an inch.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing, Lin Feng, Tang Zhenliu, Qin Xuan, and the others
did not go and join the fight, but they did watch Bao’er fight Qin
Xiu. It made them sweat to watch. When Bao’er used their skills to
fight Qin Xiu, he broke each performance completely. If Qin Xiu
wanted to murder Bao’er, she would have been killed many times over
by now.</p>
<p>They never thought their skills could possess such horrible
flaws that they would be damaged like that. In the past, they
thought it might have been their powers that were not strong
enough. Now, they realized it was actually their skills possessing
flaws that were the issue. After training with them for so many
years, it was by mere luck that they were still alive.</p>
<p>Although Bao’er had millions of skills at her disposal, it was
only a matter of time before she ran out. Even though she was
really talented, she was feeling quite upset.</p>
<p>Everyone had said she was the only one who could battle Qin Xiu.
Now that she was really fighting Qin Xiu, she could really grasp
just how terrible of a foe he was.</p>
<p>They were both Universe-class beings now, but Qin Xiu before her
was like a god. It did not seem like he was a person who could be
defeated.</p>
<p>“Are you going to give up now? You are everyone’s hope, are you
not? Your mother, the God Chaos Party Leader, is waiting for you to
beat me. Your friends and family are waiting for you to kill me.
Are you going to disappoint them all?” Qin Xiu seemed to see
through what Bao’er was thinking. After saying this, he finally
made a move.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu unleashed his first strike, but his attack was like he
was copying what Bao’er had just done before. All the skills were
used in the precise way Bao’er used them.</p>
<p>What depressed Bao’er the most was that when she was using the
same skills before, Qin Xiu broke them easily.</p>
<p>Now, when Qin Xiu used them the same way, she used Qin Xiu’s
ways to break the skills but could not break them.</p>
<p>Bao’er felt as if her body was suffocating under so much
pressure. Being suppressed by Qin Xiu, she started to retreat. But
there wasn’t much space for her to fall back to.</p>
