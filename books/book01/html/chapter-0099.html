<p>Han Sen realized how large the population of the Alliance was and how large First God’s Sanctuary was when he entered Chosen Martial Ring.</p>

<p>Every shelter had about 100,000 people like Steel Armor Shelter. And everyone in Chosen Martial Ring now was the champion of their own shelter. The stands were almost filled with at least 100,000 champions, which meant there were at least 100,000 shelters in First God’s Sanctuary. It was a dizzying figure indeed.</p>

<p>After humans entered the interstellar era, they had conquered lots of habitable planets and had been thriving. Now the human kind was so huge that only Shuras could compete.</p>

<p>Among the champions of all shelters, Dollar was the most famous one, in addition to the Chosen from last year.</p>

<p>That video of Dollar fighting golden-horned Shura was so viral that all mainstream media had covered it, so Dollar had become a household name in the Alliance.</p>

<p>Many people were curiously looking at Han Sen, as they wondered how Dollar really was.</p>

<p>But it was mostly just curiosity. They had all watched the video starring Han Sen. Although the storyline was impressive, Dollar didn’t really show much strength at that time.</p>

<p>His sacred-blood beast souls were great but he himself not so much. Han Sen at that time would be very far behind among the champions of all shelters.</p>

<p>After all, these people were one in a hundred thousand with great physiques and advanced beast souls. It hadn’t been long since Han Sen fought the Shura, so no one believed he could have made much progress. People mostly just wondered about him and didn’t treat him as a fierce rival.</p>

<p>When the channel into Chosen Martial Ring was closed, the match list finally appeared on the sacred stele.</p>

<p>The names on the list were the ones the champions left on the martial steles. Han Sen quickly searched the list for &#8220;Dollar&#8221; and he found it very soon. The word stood out to him for some reason and others had found their own names as well.</p>

<p>In this contest among the champions, a one-on-one model was adopted and the winner of the two would enter the next round, so the list was like a pyramid. Han Sen was relieved to see both Tang Zhenliu and Lin Feng were arranged far from him and there was no chance they would meet before top 10. Han Sen scanned the list again and another name caught his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yi Dongmu, he used his real name?&#8221; Han Sen saw the name Yi Dongmu and followed his path. He was suddenly startled.</p>

<p>If Yi and he could both win all the way, they would fight for the chance to become the Chosen. So in order for Han Sen to gain the sacred-blood beast soul, he must beat Yi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tang Zhenliu was afraid of Yi, while I was the one who met him. Yi Dongmu, your luck is no good. If Tang didn’t come to me, I might lose to you. But now it’s different. Maybe I am chosen,&#8221; Han Sen thought happily. Perhaps others would be afraid of Yi, but he was confident he could beat Yi after watching the videos.</p>

<p>Chosen Martial Ring was divided into a thousand stages stacked on top of one another. Each time a thousand pairs could fight at the same time. Han Sen was in a late match so he went to see other matches first, especially the one Yi was in. He had to know how much better Yi was getting compared to his performance in the videos.</p>

<p>Yi Dongmu’s match in this round was also rather late. Han Sen watched a few matches and was surprised as no one was to be taken lightly in this contest.</p>

<p>He also watched Tang Zhenliu&#8217;s first match. His opponent stood no chance under his fierce broadsword skills. After Tang shapeshifted, his opponent was barely fighting back. Tang’s techniques and strength were both outstanding in the contest.</p>

<p>Lin Feng whom Han Sen was paying even more attention to also won his match, while Han Sen didn’t really understand the way he won. His opponent was a nobody, but Lin Feng only won by a narrow margin.</p>

<p>Han Sen could even imagine that in the reports next day, Lin Feng’s opponent would be described as &#8220;had a glorious failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for some reason, Lin Feng made Han Sen feel more threatened than Tang did.</p>

<p>Finally, it was Yi Dongmu’s turn. He was not well-known at the moment. Although he was the grandson of Senator Yi, only a few people knew he was in the contest. After all, this was his first contest.</p>

<p>However, his opponent was a celebrity who ranked number 10 last time, nicknamed &#8220;Dragon Swordsman.&#8221; Dragon Swordsman was very handsome and had great sword skills. With lots of female fans in the Alliance, he enjoyed great popularity among all the Chosen.</p>

<p>Dragon Swordsman’s match was naturally high-profile. A lot of people thought that he had a chance of being top 3 this year and all the girls were cheering for him. Few paid attention to Yi Dongmu, his opponent.</p>

<p>But ten seconds from the match started, everyone was shocked. Before Dragon Swordsman drew his sword, Yi Dongmu’s knife had cut his throat.</p>

<p>Watching Dragon Swordsman clutching his own neck in pain and collapsing, the audience were silent. His female fans were covered in tears with hands on their mouths, not accepting what they saw.</p>

<p>One of the Chosen last year, Dragon Swordsman was killed in his first match. That would sure become the headline next morning. This was all it took for Yi to be known throughout the Alliance.</p>

<p>Han Sen was calm. Although Yi had made some progress, the well-born kid still did not understand the essence of assassination.</p>
