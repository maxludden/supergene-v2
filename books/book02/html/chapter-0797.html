    <p>
      Han Sen was fuming. He was the master of stealing easy kills from others,
      but now, someone had attempted to do the same thing to him. It was
      infuriating. In silence, Han Sen blitzed through the sky in pursuit of the
      tiger. The little angel and the big monster also went after it, and in the
      big monster&#8217;s wake, giant craters remained as the soil was upturned,
      mud was flung, rocks were smashed and trees were crushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, there was no human shelter in the vicinity and neither would
      there be in the lands ahead. If even a royal shelter was to be in the
      rampaging behemoth&#8217;s track, it&#8217;d be flattened within seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was the slowest of them all. He was in the back, and the distance
      that separated them only increased the further they went. The little angel
      and big monster were both faster than him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth and simulated Light Son of God&#8217;s energy
      flow; with this, his speed increased by a vast amount. Through this, he
      was just about able to catch up and not get left behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black tiger was an extremely menacing creature to look at. Despite
      carrying such a large monster, it was able to continue its flight west and
      outpace them all without any trouble, whatsoever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen chased after the black tiger for four days straight, and neither
      of the creatures slowed down. Han Sen himself was unable to excuse the
      misdeed committed by the tiger, and with a burst of energy, swore to the
      high heaven he would catch up with the tiger and deliver its just
      desserts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big monster felt the same. Gripped in the fearsome talons of the
      tiger&#8217;s paws, its baby repeatedly cried out for aid over the course
      of their flight. The baby&#8217;s perseverance had to be admired, and it
      was no wonder why it was a second-generation super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Devil-Eye Spiders had a weak vitality, and if they were the ones snatched,
      they&#8217;d have died a long time ago. There was no way they&#8217;d
      remain alive, let alone muster the effort of screeching for help.
    </p>

    <p>
      But despite all their most valiant efforts, none were able to catch up
      with the black tiger. And by now, it had been eight days. Their flight had
      gone on so long and far, they had exited the San Dao River region.
      Treacherous mountain ranges are what lay in the distant lands ahead, ones
      which the black tiger was not hesitant to fly into once nearing them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked ahead and stopped. Amidst all the mountains that were
      connected, there was one purple mountain that stuck out like a sore thumb.
      The black tiger landed on its slopes and dragged the small monster up with
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purple mountain was a strange one, indeed. It was very tall and its
      peak rested somewhere above the clouds. On this peak was what looked like
      a palace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen witnessed the black tiger land there, and suspected things were
      only going to take a turn for the worse. For a spirit shelter to have a
      monster as wild as that, it wouldn&#8217;t merely be a royal class one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen recalled the little angel, while the big monster went on ahead. It
      seemed as if it was willing to do whatever it took if it meant securing
      the safety of its child.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purple palace appeared semi-transparent, as its appearance was masked
      and unmasked at the whims and travel of clouds. The black tiger raced its
      way to the top.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purple palace&#8217;s double-doors opened as if they were automatic,
      and with the squirming, screeching monster in its clutches, the tiger ran
      inside. Once it was beyond them, the doors closed and locked the big
      monster outside.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big monster was not willing to stop there, however. With its goliath
      body, it threw itself against the gates repeatedly, in a bid to bring it
      down.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big monster had a width of one hundred meters, and it was at least
      fifty meters tall. But in the shadow of that door, it didn&#8217;t appear
      so grand. They were of comparable height.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The giant monster&#8217;s body used all its strength in hitting the door,
      and each thud echoed far and wide. But despite its efforts, the stone
      gates did not budge a single inch. The monster&#8217;s wretched power was
      nothing in comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
      The monster used so much strength in each push, it fell backward a few
      times after every throw of itself. It would scream aloud after each failed
      attempt, and then try once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing happened. The stone gate was firmly sealed and no matter how much
      strength was exerted, the big monster was unable to break down the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all these hits, the monster had begun to bleed. And still, the door
      remained closed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked while watching this. The powerful monster must have
      been a super creature, and he suspected most second-generation sorts would
      be unable to kill him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet this one door, despite receiving the monster&#8217;s absolute might,
      was unwilling to submit. It remained sealed, and Han Sen suspected it was
      a testament to the strength of whatever master waited inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen frowned and flew back up into the sky, keen to take an aerial view
      of the site and see what creatures were inside the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      But while he was airborne, the sight was entirely shrouded by mist. Unable
      to get a good look, Han Sen felt his heart sink somewhat.
    </p>

    <p>
      With his eyesight and abilities of perception, he should have had no issue
      piercing the clouds with his vision. Strangely, he was unable to see
      anything. The clouds themselves were quite curious, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his devil-eye mask and ran the Devil-Eye Spider&#8217;s
      energy flow. Keenly, he looked back at the shelter once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen couldn&#8217;t quite make out what was in there, he was
      able to espy the presence of a few flames that looked like lifeforces.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;One, two, three, four, five.&#8221; Han Sen counted at least five
      super creatures inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, that was only what Han Sen was able to see. He couldn&#8217;t
      be sure whether or not there were any more inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Perhaps I will indeed have to just give up this pursuit.&#8221; Han
      Sen gritted his teeth, hating his own suggestion. It was fairly obvious
      he&#8217;d be unable to deal with all the super creatures inside there,
      but he still did not want to just pack up and leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t easy trying to locate and secure a second-generation super
      creature, so it was fairly bad for it just to be taken away from him in
      the manner it was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, screw it. I&#8217;m going to risk it. Let&#8217;s see just how
      powerful this super spirit shelter really is! Even if I&#8217;m too weak,
      they&#8217;ll be unable to kill me. If I can&#8217;t get back the prey I
      worked so hard to nab, I&#8217;m going to mess this place up!&#8221;
      Clenching his jaw, Han Sen ran towards the purple door.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big monster and Han Sen considered each other friends for the time
      being, and Han Sen was willing to try to help open the door for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they both got inside, it might actually be possible for the big monster
      to take on two super creatures all by itself. If Han Sen performed better,
      the prospect of earning a few more easy kills for himself would be
      delightful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the chances of this happening were slim, he was happy enough just
      to raise a little hell for the shelter as payback.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ran before the gate, as the giant monster did its best to get it
      open. While the door remained undamaged, it was coated in the battered
      monster&#8217;s blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and tried fitting it where the seam
      for the double doors should be. As the rex spike drilled into the door,
      countless sparks illuminated the area. But still, despite his efforts, the
      doors couldn&#8217;t be opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not a single chip of the door was broken away, either. And now, Han Sen
      was beginning to think it was too difficult.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The big monster, seeing that Han Sen was unable to open the door, hit it
      once more. Its mouth spat out blood, and it screamed in pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is not going to work. Even if we barge in now, we&#8217;ll be
      half dead. Death would be all but certain upon our entry.&#8221; Han Sen
      gritted his teeth and flew into the shelter from above.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shelter was veiled in cloud, and he couldn&#8217;t see a single thing.
      But right now, in his state of mind, he cared little. Han Sen was going to
      fly in, try to open the door from the inside, and let the big monster in.
