<h2>Violent Explosion</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2160</h3>

<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Yuya and the others were fighting hard when they heard an
explosion echo from afar. There was a light blooming among all
those xenogeneics.</p>
<p>The swarm of xenogeneics all started to churn, as if they were
super nervous.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There was another explosion, and its sound made the Marquises’
ears hurt. A mushroom cloud rose visibly over the landscape this
time. The shockwave spread, and swathes of the dragonflies were
blown into nothing but bits.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Many more mushroom clouds exploded amidst the army of
xenogeneics that had descended upon them. Great numbers of the
dragonflies were destroyed, and the ensuing vacuum sucked living
dragonflies back into the wreckage.</p>
<p>A red shadow emerged from the dust and haze. It looked like a
man holding a rocket launcher, and again and again, rockets leaped
out of the cylindrical launcher. Everything in sight was being
blown to pieces.</p>
<p>Rockets exploded continually, creating mushroom clouds. The
metal ground and the dragonflies were being sundered in equal
measure, as bodies and metallic chunks were strewn across the
region in a mind-blowing display of carnage.</p>
<p>Over the wreckage and corpses drifted fire, smoke, and dust. The
red shadow was like a crazy killer. It moved forward steadily as it
fired rockets, reducing the whole place to ruin and rubble.</p>
<p>On the shoulders of that crazy red shadow was what looked like a
six-year-old girl. She seemed curious, and she kept looking around.
Her calm expression was a ridiculously stark contrast to the
insanity of the explosions destroying everything around them.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” Yuya and the Sky Palace students, upon seeing the
shape of the body more clearly, began to cheer.</p>
<p>They thought Han Sen had been murdered by the white Metal Beast,
which had appeared to single him out. But instead of being killed,
he showed up when they needed help the most.</p>
<p>Seeing that Han Sen’s rockets could blow up both Marquise and
Duke xenogeneics, it was obvious that his power had increased in
the time they had spent apart. It appeared to them as if he must
have reached Marquise class. Otherwise, there was no way he could
have brought harm to those beings.</p>
<p>Han Sen had intended to rejoin the Sky Palace team when the
storm ceased, as he wanted to remain in the cave and drink as much
of that metal xenogeneic fluid as he could. But the Sky Palace
students were in danger, and so he decided he had no choice but to
leave the metal city.</p>
<p>“This guy. Did he just become a Marquise?” When Dragon Nine saw
the strength of those rockets, he froze up stiff. He could not
believe a Marquise could possess such power.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight was shocked, as well. He wouldn’t even dare to try
to withstand one of those rockets, even with his gold dragon body
active. It was really difficult to believe that a Marquise
possessed such power. And on top of all that, the attacks were
long-range and area of effect. They weren’t single-target attacks
only.</p>
<p>Seeing the Dukes that Han Sen was knocking out of the sky,
Kahn’s face looked ashen. “What frightening power. And it’s coming
from the body of someone that is only a Marquise? If he had become
a Marquise sooner, perhaps he could have fought against Dollar and
Lone Bamboo.”</p>
<p>“What is his geno art? What makes him so powerful and scary?
Across the whole universe, I am afraid that Mister Han has to have
the most impressive geno art by a wide margin. Not even Dollar or
Lone Bamboo would be able to fight him,” a Buddha Marquise
whispered in awe.</p>
<p>Everyone listening actually agreed with what the Buddha Marquise
had said. That power was something they had never expected to see
from a Marquise. Even if Dragon Eight used his Evilbreaker Dragon
powers to summon his maximum strength, it wouldn’t compare to the
power of each of those rockets.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about this, though, was the attack being an
area of effect. The power was so strong, it was difficult to
believe it all came from a Marquise.</p>
<p>Under Han Sen’s attacks, the fearless xenogeneics started to
shake and shiver. Han Sen was like a walking cannon, merrily
killing each and every xenogeneic he could see. Even Dukes were
being blown up with ease, all by the might of those explosions.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The whole ground trembled. The xenogeneics were squealing. The
explosions were sounding from everywhere across the land.</p>
<p>If there was ever a matter a rocket could not solve, he’d just
use another.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen held his rocket launcher like a minigun. He kept firing
at the swarm, and the shockwaves and clouds melted the xenogeneics
in the throttling haze.</p>
<p>“Marquise Xenogeneic Hunted…”</p>
<p>The killing announcements kept overlapping. It was all mixed up,
and Han Sen couldn’t properly discern what was being said.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just the power he had gained when Spell became a
Marquise. This was Han Sen’s power combined with the Break Six
Skies art he had just learned.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power was scary, there was no doubt. He was definitely
the best out of all the Marquises now. And the impacts he could
deliver via Break Six Skies could enable him to kill everything
that was coming at him. He felt as if he could destroy a galactic
warship.</p>
<p>When Spell became a Marquise, Han Sen had nothing to do. So, he
spent the remainder of his free time researching Break Six Skies.
His Dongxuan Sutra and deified spectacles made Break Six Skies
incredibly simple for him to learn.</p>
<p>Han Sen used a couple of tricks of his own, too. Not even he
could handle the full extent of Break Six Skies at close range, so
he infused their powers with Spell’s projectiles. Firing them from
a distance would not hurt him.</p>
<p>So, this was the perfect marriage. The rockets and the bullets
had the power of Break Six Skies. Although Han Sen had only learned
the first tier, his rocket launcher was already very strong.</p>
<p>Not even a Duke could withstand it. The rocket’s power
suppressed the whole xenogeneic army.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight and Yuya moved to help Han Sen, but they soon
stopped. They just stood back and admired Han Sen’s handiwork.</p>
<p>Ruins, bodies, and smoke were all that was left in his wake. The
whole xenogeneic host had been blown to pieces by Han Sen. He gave
an evil chuckle.</p>
<p>Everything around Han Sen was exploding. Everyone was thinking,
“This guy has destroyed more than those f*cking Destroyed did. It’s
like he is one of the Destroyed!”</p>
<p>The xenogeneics were running now. The whole place was like a
graveyard in the middle of hell itself.</p>
<p>Han Sen held his rocket launcher casually, the little girl still
perched upon his shoulder. He approached the Marquises from the
ruins. Dragon Eight and the others felt a large chill strike them.
They couldn’t help but stumble backward.</p>
<p>Yuya, are you okay?” Han Sen asked, looking over the fighters
assembled before him.</p>
<p>“No… Yes. I mean, we are okay.” Yuya was too shocked to answer
him appropriately. His brain had lagged for a moment, but it slowly
started to function again, now that he had been asked a
question.</p>
<p>“Teacher Han, your geno art is too cool!” White Real blurted out
without any self-consciousness.</p>
<p>“That was awesome!”</p>
<p>“This skill is invincible!”</p>
<p>“He blew up Dukes! This is crazy.”</p>
<p>“If Teacher Han is a Marquise, Dollar won’t be considered the
number one Marquise anymore. That’s for sure.”</p>
<p>All the students spoke about this happily. They all referred to
Han Sen with the teacher title, as all the explosions had been
incredibly impressive. They admired him too much to speak as if
they were on the same level.</p>
