<p>“That should be more than enough, I should think,” Han Sen said
with a nod. He was still thinking about the fight he had just
endured against that xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought his fighting power was decent at this point, but
that xenogeneic had completely suppressed him in every way
imaginable. Aside from the power gap between them, there were also
important differences in the ways that the two of them fought.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it some more, he realized he had been
completely suppressed. He had lost in the most embarrassing way
possible.</p>
<p>“It was just a doppelganger, and yet, it had such a scary amount
of power. I wonder how strong its true self is, then?” Han Sen
wondered to himself.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer looked at each other. They had played Han
Sen perfectly, and now they could barely suppress their
laughter.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know that the doppelganger he battled was
different from most other doppelgangers. It was kind of like a
child of the true god xenogeneic. Although its power was indeed
primitive class, the battle experience it possessed—and its skill
and will—were top-notch. Han Sen was the only person who would
struggle to defeat such a beast; even most deifieds would lose
badly against this opponent.</p>
<p>“Let him lose a few more times against it. Let’s wear him down a
bit,” Li Keer smiled and thought to herself.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s wounds recovered quickly. To aid his self-recovery
power, Li Keer and Exquisite provided him with a geno fluid
produced from xenogeneic genes. It was very good for healing one’s
physical wounds. With the combination of those two powers, every
speck of damage had disappeared within seven or eight hours.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Han Sen went to the Jail Demon Hall to
do battle against the xenogeneic. He came up with many different
plans to bring the creature down, but every attempt was
useless.</p>
<p>The longest Han Sen was able to last inside was two minutes.
Once he was done, he had to teleport away. If he hadn’t, he would
have been killed.</p>
<p>He would only be given a sliver of time to cast his knife airs.
Even when he used Under the Sky, it seemed to do nothing to the
xenogeneic. Not only did he fail to kill it, but he couldn’t
inflict a single wound on his foe.</p>
<p>“It really is too strong.” Han Sen couldn’t help but compliment
how frighteningly powerful his latest xenogeneic opponent really
was. But despite his repeated defeats, he never thought about
giving up. As soon as his body recovered, he went back to the Jail
Demon Hall to fight. He was determined to find a way to kill
it.</p>
<p>But every time he went there, he would leave disappointed. The
xenogeneic was too strong to be predictable, and so Han Sen
couldn’t figure out the creature’s patterns and use those to
manipulate it, either.</p>
<p>The more Han Sen went, the more Li Keer and Exquisite started to
worry. They had only wanted to get rid of some of Han Sen’s pride.
They wanted to use that xenogeneic to wear down his resolve.</p>
<p>But if he kept going on like this, and he eventually broke down
completely, they would have a destroyed silkworm on their
hands.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they hadn’t sensed any sign that Han Sen was about
to give up. Although he kept losing, after each failure, he would
just start thinking about how he might defeat the beast the next
time he did battle. His entire mind seemed devoted to coming up
with ways to defeat the fiend. He never wasted brain power on
thinking about anything else.</p>
<p>That made Exquisite and Li Keer feel a little safer with what
they were doing. They just hoped that the time limit would pass
soon. Then, Han Sen would have no choice but to give up. It
wouldn’t destroy too much of his confidence, they predicted.</p>
<p>“No… that still won’t work.” Han Sen failed again. He dragged
his body, which was riddled with slashes and puncture wounds, out
of the Jail Demon Hall. He shook his head.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer weren’t there. Because Han Sen now spent
his entire days either fighting or healing, they stopped hanging
around after the first few days. It was dull. They would
occasionally come back to feel how Han Sen felt during the fight,
but not all of the time.</p>
<p>Also, due to the fact that Han Sen kept losing, they were only
learning how to deal with failure. That didn’t help them much.
Because there wasn’t much else for them to learn, they stopped
focusing on his thoughts as much.</p>
<p>“It looks like taking down that xenogeneic won’t be easy. Hey
wait, it’s almost time to meet up with Mister White! I need to go
to the core area.” Han Sen thought about the Xuan Yellow Sutra, and
he realized it was time for him to take a break from fighting.</p>
<p>When he saw Li Keer again, Han Sen mentioned his need to visit
the core area again. Li Keer hastily agreed to his request.</p>
<p>She and Exquisite had grown worried about Han Sen’s constant
fighting in the Jail Demon Hall. They were worried that being
defeated endlessly might do too much damage to his confidence. Now
that Han Sen had expressed a desire to go to the core area, they
thought it was a best-case scenario.</p>
<p>Li Keer took Han Sen back to the oasis so he could enter the
core area.</p>
<p>Of course, Gu Qingcheng was there at the place they were
supposed to meet. When he saw Gu Qingcheng there, Han Sen couldn’t
wait to ask, “Okay, what did you learn? Did you receive news from
Mister White?”</p>
<p>“This is what Mister White asked me to give you.” Gu Qingcheng
passed a notebook to Han Sen, alongside the original version of the
Xuan Yellow Sutra.</p>
<p>Han Sen accepted them and put away the Xuan Yellow Sutra. He
opened up the notebook to have a look. The pages were filled with
an elegant script, which had clearly been written by hand. The
notebook had a hundred pages, and almost all of them contained
notes. There were only two or three pages that were empty. Clearly,
Mister White had put a lot of effort into this.</p>
<p>“Mister White really is so nice.” There weren’t many people who
were as kind as Mister White, Han Sen decided. He was the sort of
person who did impressive things and achieved a lot. He was no
common man.</p>
<p>Instead of leaving the core area, Han Sen remained there to read
Mister White’s notebook. He didn’t want Li Keer and Exquisite
looking over his shoulder as he studied, metaphorically
speaking.</p>
<p>The content of the notebook was a detailed analysis of the Xuan
Yellow Sutra. It also had notes on the problems it might cause and
the aftermath of using it.</p>
<p>As Han Sen read through the content of the notebook, he learned
a great deal. And not just about the Xuan Yellow Sutra, either. He
began to understand the Dongxuan Sutra and the Blood-Pulse Sutra to
a higher level.</p>
<p>“Mister White is a real grandmaster. Compared to him, I am just
a peasant with some good luck and a bit of motivation,” Han Sen
murmured, shaking his head as he closed the notebook.</p>
<p>Actually, Han Sen’s compliment wasn’t strictly accurate.
Everyone’s path to study was different. Mister White had focused on
acquiring knowledge. He knew so much, which put him on a higher
plane than Han Sen when it came to intellectual pursuits. But then
again, Han Sen wasn’t the sort of person who focused on amassing
huge amounts of knowledge, so it wasn’t strange that Mister White
outmatched him in that area. Comparing the two men in such a
singular way wasn’t very fair.</p>
<p>Han Sen memorized everything that was written in the notebook,
but he didn’t want to destroy it. After all, Mister White put in
the time and effort to write it all out by hand.</p>
<p>“Take this back to Planet Eclipse and ask Zero to hide it.” Han
Sen gave the notebook to Gu Qingcheng so she could take it
back.</p>
<p>After Gu Qingcheng left, Han Sen tried to digest the content of
the notebook. The more he thought about it, the more shaken he
felt. Based on what Mister White had described, if Han Sen finished
practicing the Xuan Yellow Sutra, it would become a very scary
power.</p>
<p>“Is it really possible to reverse Blood-Pulse?” Han Sen was
shocked. If what Mister White told him about the Xuan Yellow Sutra
was accurate, it was terrifying.</p>
