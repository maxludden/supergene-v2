    <p>
      The vortex was so strong. Han Sen tried his hardest to resist, but he was
      still being pulled towards the umbrella. He was going to be sucked inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures and spirits saw Han Sen unable to resist, and they felt it
      was a great shame. A great swordmaster of spectacular skill was going to
      die before his prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as they watched Han Sen about to get sucked into the umbrella, he
      disappeared in the blink of an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone thought he had been pulled inside, but he hadn’t. He reappeared
      right next to Elysian Moon, with his sword poised to cut deep into Elysian
      Moon’s throat.
    </p>
    <p>“What happened?! How did he escape?”</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t see it.”</p>
    <p>
      No one knew how Han Sen had pried himself away from the suction of the
      Elysian Umbrella, and even Elysian Moon herself was surprised. She had no
      clue how he had slipped out of her pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon gritted her teeth and spun her umbrella. She stumbled back in
      a hasty retreat, aimed the umbrella at her enemy, and tried to suck him in
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another flash, Han Sen had appeared directly next to Elysian Moon,
      behind the umbrella. With its face not pointing towards him, he couldn’t
      get sucked inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that everyone noticed the dimensions of space around Han Sen
      had become somewhat distorted and warped. It was like he was able to
      teleport directly towards his opponent, and the umbrella had been rendered
      useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is he employing the powers of time and space? Does Sky Sword have a rare
      time and space elemental attunement?” A spirit, upon recognizing Han Sen’s
      amazing power, found himself in complete awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time or space alone was rare to see, but to have both of them together was
      far beyond that. It was rarer than winning the lottery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the history of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, only a small handful of
      creatures and spirits had possessed both the powers of Time and Space.
      Dollarcidentally, they also happened to be the strongest known.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen was not naturally talented in both of these. His Time and
      Space element came from the spirit geno points he received in the Third
      God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might not have been as effective as those who were naturally talented
      with such boons, but he could still briefly teleport through space with
      Ghost Slash.
    </p>
    <p>
      This short-distance blink could not take Han Sen a distance further than
      one meter, and while it would have been ineffective against those who had
      only Space but were all-natural, it was enough for him to evade the
      suction of the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ghost Slash wasn’t enough for him to wholly escape the suction,
      truthfully. It was because Han Sen’s body was not strong enough, and he
      had yet to reach super class. As such, Ghost Slash was not enough to
      compete against the umbrella completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Han Sen’s observational skills, though, he was able to tell the
      vortex sat on the surface of the umbrella, and the suction power was
      strongest towards the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Elysian Moon used her umbrella, she’d point the center directly
      at her enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to prove whether or not his theory was correct, so, when
      the umbrella was facing him, he shifted his position to its side, and only
      allowed the side of the vortex to grip him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt a strong power pulling on him, yes, but the teleportation
      ability of Ghost Slash allowed him to easily escape that manner of
      suction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Han Sen had witnessed this, he knew the umbrella couldn’t deal
      with everything. This flaw would allow Han Sen to keep on top of it. Han
      Sen could see now that Elysian Moon was no greater than Xu Mi. A little
      bit stronger, maybe, but that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xu Mi’s sword was small, and it had a limited range. Therefore, Han Sen
      was able to dodge fairly easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon’s Elysian Umbrella had a longer and wider range, and it was
      therefore just a little harder to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not get annoyed easily when he fought, so he patiently
      side-stepped around, staying mobile to avoid the center of the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon noticed that Han Sen’s teleportation ability was rather weak,
      though. She swung her umbrella, trying to grab Han Sen with the vortex’s
      center-point. If she was able to do this, her umbrella would have enough
      grunt to pull and finish Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she suddenly made a mistake. She shouldn’t have let Han Sen get close,
      for he was able to keep on getting near after that. He was at her side, he
      was behind her. Elysian Moon was able to respond and keep away, but she
      had no clue where he’d appear next. She was unable to target him the way
      she wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suction at the brim of the vortex would hardly snag Han Sen, and it
      was impossible to catch him and draw him into the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits watched the scene with weird feelings. All they could see was
      a child holding a gun, firing willy-nilly, failing to hit the man that was
      next to her.
    </p>
    <p>It made them think they were watching an adult play with a kid.</p>
    <p>
      Of course, they knew they weren’t playing. And if Han Sen made a mistake,
      he’d surely die. But for reasons unbeknownst to themselves, they weren’t
      worried for Han Sen. They knew he wouldn’t fail or miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon was getting annoyed. She was unable to point the center of
      the umbrella at Han Sen, and the human’s sword was slowly pushing her
      towards the edge of the arena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Elysian Moon stopped and did not allow Han Sen to push her any
      further. She turned and ran straight to the wall of the arena by her own
      volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why Han Sen could fight was because of his strange movements,
      and his constant reappearances around her. She couldn’t use the center to
      aim at Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she went up against the wall, Han Sen would be unable to use this same
      tactic to avoid her, and she’d be able to beat him with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits and creatures acknowledged what she was going to do, and for
      this, they now started to worry about Han Sen. If she put her back against
      the wall, Han Sen would be unable to attack her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon was currently ten meters away from the wall. If she reached
      it, Han Sen would lose. But for her, in the heat of that moment, it felt
      like a great distance away. All she had to do was take two steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      That simple dash felt like an impossible mission for her to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra and Ghost Slash. When he teleported, he
      started to attack a strange spot. It was like he was deliberately missing
      her. But when Han Sen moved, and she moved, it suddenly looked as if he
      was targeting her in a weak spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon was right in front of the wall, but she felt as if there was
      a countless number of barricades and corners she had to traverse to get
      there. She had to turn to move forward, lest she crash like a car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barricades were Han Sen and his sword. Elysian Moon was still using
      her Elysian Umbrella, but she was unable to hurt him. She was being
      controlled by Han Sen like a puppet on strings. She couldn’t get close to
      the wall, and it now felt as if she was moving further from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These sword skills are like those of a god!” Red Dragon couldn’t help but
      blurt out a compliment.
