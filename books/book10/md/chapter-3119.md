  “You’ve been talking a lot, but you have yet to tell us where we can dig up the gene egg.” Han Sen did not understand anything about the light abyss, and he had never heard of Tian Shan. He just wanted to know where he could find a gene egg Bald Guy laughed. “There’s no need to rush proceedings. Although the formation is similar, in this world, it is impossible to have two God Spirit Blood-Pulses that are completely the same. Even if they were similar, there would be differences. You need to calculate the granular details. We should go forward. If we reach an area where there might be a gene egg, I will be able to tell.”

Han Sen was able to tell the man was very smart. He was clever but not truly excellent. He could not locate a gene egg via discerning the God Spirit Blood – Pulse’s direction. He could only discover one when it was within his proximity.

Even so, he was better at it than Han Sen. Thus, he had to listen to him.

The God Wind Dragon was headed deeper into the Gold Crystal System. They traveled past many planets. Bald Guy said passed every single one of them until the fourth day of their journey. It was then that Bald Guy’s eyes turned bright. He looked toward a planet and said, “That planet has a high-class gene egg

on it.”

Han Sen looked in that direction and saw a lifeless planet covered in rocks and dust. There was also a large crater on it, which had been left behind by a meteorite.

At this time, the rocks and dust were shining like gems. They were almost glowing.

Han Sen had seen many varieties of this kind of planet the past four days. He was not able to tell what was so special about this planet.

Bald Guy steered the God Wind Dragon in the direction of the planet. He commanded it to fly low and look around. Not long later, he happily said, “This cannot be an incorrect judgment. This place must have a gene egg.”

Although this God Spirit Blood-Pulse was scary, since it had just formed, the gene race inside the God Spirit Blood-Pulse had yet to hatch. They did not need to worry.

The biggest danger they faced was the other humans there to dig up the gene eggs and gene races that already existed.

Such a scary God Spirit Blood-Pulse had been born. If there was a gene race that already lived there, and they had consumed many gene eggs, they could have evolved terribly.

But this was a lifeless planet. No one was able to see a gene race, so they did not have to worry.

As to the presence of other humans, Han Sen had yet to spot anyone else. After the three of them came to a halt, they started digging in the area Bald Guy marked.

After digging under a stone for three feet, they saw a white light gene egg. It was the size of a basketball. It was like a snow-white jade.

Bald Guy happily grabbed the gene egg. After looking at it, he determined that he could not identify what sort of gene egg it was. “Although I do not know which species this is, judging from its look and presence, it’s not a low-class gene race. It should be at least a marquise-class gene race. We should keep digging. This land pulse should contain more than one gene egg.” After saying that, Bald Guy put the gene eggs aside to keep digging. Just as Bald Guy had said, they found four gene eggs from the land pulse. They all looked to be the same kind.

Bald Guy kept two from the haul. Han Sen and Li Bing Yu each received one.

The three of them remained on the planet searching for land pulses and digging gene eggs. It really was a super God Spirit Blood-Pulse. There were many land pulses and gene eggs. It only took them half a day to find four land pulses. They dug up a dozen gene eggs. Unfortunately, they were only marquise and duke class. Although their levels were not too low, and they were likely worth quite a bit, they were of no use to Han Sen.

In the meantime, many humans riding gene races flew through the skies. Most of them left when laying eyes on the God Wind Dragon.

The God Wind Dragons’ ultimate body was quite intimidating. It made Bald Guy’s cockiness increase.

Han Sen and Li Bing Yu followed Bald Guy. They all managed to dig up a trove of gene eggs. Bald Guy kept leading the God Wind Dragon to locate land pulses. After finding a land pulse, he gave it to Han Sen and Li Bing Yu and continued the search. The three of them worked together quite well. Han Sen did not think there was a problem, but Li Bing Yu felt scorned. “This Bald Guy is very good at bluffing, but his God Spirit Blood-Pulse knowledge is fairly average. The Gold Crystal System really is a place like a light abyss, but the Gold Crystal System itself is made of seven planets. It has a seven-star fighting formation, which affects the light abyss formation. It will become a ghost star light formation. Once in that formation, there are only seven real places that can yield a god-class gene egg. This planet is not one of seven planets with seven stars.”

Li Bing Yu was quite knowledgeable about land pulses. She also had deeply investigated God Spirit Blood-Pulse skills. Although she was not as great as Mister Wei, she was better than Bald Guy, who had only learned half of what she knew.

“How do I lure Han Sen to the real seven planets?” Li Bing Yu followed Han Sen. Her primary purpose was not for digging up a gene egg.

She wanted to know how strong Han Sen’s power truly was. Although everyone claimed he murdered Steel Scene in the Ice Snow God Temple, it was seemingly just a legend. No one had actually witnessed what Han Sen was really like.

Bald Guy seemed hurried as he rode the God Wind Dragon to where Han Sen was. He shouted at Han Sen, who was in the middle of digging, “Old Han, stop digging! You should come here! I found something good!”

“I have almost finished here,” Han Sen said while he kept digging. “I can go there later.”

Bald Guy jumped down and pulled Han Sen with him. He dragged him out of the hole and said, “What are you digging for? I found a land pulse that can shock the sky. It might have a god-class gene egg. Let’s forget about this one. We can come back later.”

After that, Bald Guy pulled Han Sen onto the God Wind Dragon. He invited Li Bing Yu along for the ride. They flew toward a mountain that had high and low spots. Li Bing Yu thought, “I’ll be damned if they can find a god-class gene egg here.”

The God Wind Dragon flew to the upper part of the small, stone mountain. Bald Guy looked at the stone mountain’s position and said, “Look at what is over there.”

Han Sen and Li Bing Yu went toward where Bald Guy pointed. They saw the little stone mountain had an old tree at its center.

Han Sen did not know any land pulse skills, and he could not feel the presence of the old tree, but he knew that the old tree must have been very special.

This was a planet without life, so this was not just any old tree. Even bacteria were unable to live there, so how could an old tree be growing?

Han Sen had a closer look. The old tree had a lot of fruit on it. The branches bloomed with pink flowers. It was like a plum tree.

The entire Gold Crystal System was affected by the God Spirit Blood – Pulse’s weird light, but the old tree did not shine.

It was like an ordinary tree. It was full of flowers. Although it looked very average, it was strange for this ordinary plum tree to be where it was.
