<h2>Night Ghost Betrayal</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2095</h3>

<p>The whole base was infested with Night Ghosts. Han Sen and Lone
Bamboo were trapped. If they wanted to escape, they would have to
fight and kill their way through the host of Night Ghosts.</p>
<p>But there were thousands of them, and there were more than a
thousand Dukes. Han Sen and Lone Bamboo had only just become
Marquises, and they were carrying an injured man between them. It
would not be easy for the three of them to escape. Han Sen looked
up at the Night Ghosts that were looking down at them like hungry
tigers. Then he turned to her, emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“Sleepless Duke, do you know what will happen if the Night
Ghosts betray Sky Palace?”</p>
<p>“Ha! We will go and join the Demon, anyway. Sky Palace will not
be able to do anything,” Sleepless Duke snarled.</p>
<p>“It makes sense that Marquise Kahn is here, then. It has always
been your plot to betray Sky Palace!” Han Sen looked at Kahn next,
and he asked, “But I don’t understand. If you were planning to join
Demon, why bother getting us involved?”</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke grunted and said, “That it was merely an
accident. We planned to use these living creatures to turn all our
warriors into Dukes. Then we’d have the strength to smash through
Sky Palace’s defenses. We did not expect one to run out and rouse
the attention of the Observation Department.”</p>
<p>“With the power you wield, you could have easily killed a
wounded man.” Han Sen looked at the man who was badly wounded. Kahn
and Sleepless Duke should have been able to defeat him. With the
injuries he had sustained, there was no way he could have fought
off so many Night Ghosts.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke did not answer, but the man laughed and said, “I
controlled the lives of those creatures. She wants me dead, but she
doesn’t want those other creatures to die. That is why I am still
alive.”</p>
<p>“I told you to give those creatures up! Kill him and go to the
Demon. If you had listened to me, none of this would have
happened,” Kahn told Sleepless Duke.</p>
<p>“Without these creatures, my people would not be able to become
Dukes. God knows how many of our people would have been killed
breaking through those defenses. I had no choice in this matter,”
Sleepless Duke said.</p>
<p>“So, you planned all this? All for us to be the ones that killed
him?” Now Han Sen knew the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>“Something like that. But I did not expect the two of you to
come here together.” Sleepless Duke coldly went on to say, “But it
does not matter now. Since it has come to this, we cannot fall
back. You can all go to hell!”</p>
<p>After that, Sleepless Duke screamed. The horde of Night Ghosts
flapped their wings like demons and came racing down to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo let the man go, thrusting the three of them into a
horrendous battle.</p>
<p>The power and speed of the Night Ghosts were terrifying in the
dark. It was no wonder why they were good at fighting. They were
high level, and they had strong wills. The Duke Night Ghosts were a
serious threat.</p>
<p>Bao’er was sitting on Han Sen’s shoulder, observing Han Sen’s
fighting with curiosity.</p>
<p>Instead of participating in the battle, Kahn merely watched Han
Sen from afar. “Han Sen, you are a powerful being to defeat Sharon.
I would have liked the opportunity to kill you myself. I did not
expect you would come here. That is disappointing.”</p>
<p>“Disappointing? What?” Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and
teleported in front of Kahn. Then, he slashed towards him.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Kahn’s demon knife came up to block. The impact sent them both
wobbling back. Neither attack did anything.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was immediately surrounded by Night Ghosts. It was a
very dangerous position to be in.</p>
<p>“It is disappointing that you’ll die here today, and I will be
robbed of the chance of killing you myself in a one-on-one. It is a
shame whenever people like you and Lone Bamboo have to die this
way.” Kahn sighed.</p>
<p>“In that case, you won’t be disappointed. We will fight,” Han
Sen said.</p>
<p>“It is a shame, but I do not see how you plan on surviving. The
Night Ghosts are good in the dark. It wouldn’t matter if you and
Lone Bamboo had a clone army of yourselves; on Planet Night Ghost,
you would still be destroyed,” Kahn said.</p>
<p>“Maybe not.” Han Sen teleported away from the attacks of the
Night Ghosts. And then, he spoke to Sleepless Duke. “Sleepless
Duke, there is still time for you to reverse this mistake. The
Night Ghosts can still be allowed to live. If you continue down
this path, all of the Night Ghosts in this universe will be wiped
out. Do you want your daughter Li Duo and the rest of your people
to die with you?”</p>
<p>“I would rather die than remain a prisoner. Whoever gets in the
way of us becoming free will die,” Sleepless Duke shrieked. She
flapped her wings and came at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen petrified his body and stomped the ground, unleashing a
shockwave of petrification. But the Night Ghosts around him did not
petrify. This shocked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Do not waste your energy. The only thing that can defeat the
Night Ghosts is light. Petrify won’t work on them! Their bodies
aren’t made of flesh, so they won’t be petrified!” Kahn smiled.</p>
<p>If the Night Ghosts weren’t so excellent, the Demons wouldn’t
have spent so much time trying to recruit them.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. The Night Ghosts were harder to handle than he
thought.</p>
<p>Things were going badly for Lone Bamboo and the injured man.
They were holding on, but they couldn’t escape in their current
condition. They would die the moment they became exhausted.</p>
<p>“Come to me!” Han Sen shouted at Lone Bamboo and the man.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo heard that, and his jade sword began to shine. The
Night Ghosts near Han Sen backed away.</p>
<p>The man exploded with blue light as he came running towards Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved his Ghost Teeth Knife. The Night Ghosts that he
had cut suddenly found their wounds cracking and widening.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke screamed and leaped at Han Sen. Han Sen
teleported away to evade her.</p>
<p>The three of them stood together, back-to-back, as the Night
Ghosts came at them from all sides. Ghost airs were everywhere. It
looked as if they had gone on a trip to hell itself.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo and the man wanted to start killing their attackers
in earnest, but Han Sen stopped them. A blue light came out of his
body, covering the three of them.</p>
<p>The blue light became a giant, translucent eggshell. It encased
them.</p>
<p>Powerful ghost airs were everywhere as countless ghost claws
came against the translucent eggshell. The impacts made squeaky
noises, and Han Sen could feel each blow as a sort of pressure.</p>
<p>But when those ghost airs broke, the translucent shield was
unmoved. It did not even vibrate.</p>
