<p>“Use your power to help me put out the flames that wreathe me or
break the half-burned candle,” Han Sen said to Zhao Ning’er.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er immediately turned into a phoenix head harp. She
plucked her strings and made the asking heart sounds go to the
half-burned candle, but the powerful harp sounds went through the
candle and assaulting fire. Mirror Moon was not impacted in the
least.</p>
<p>Han Sen, who was already very weak, was affected by the harp
sounds. “Don’t move!” Han Sen immediately shouted. After this hit,
he knew Zhao Ning’er’s asking heart sounds were useless against the
candles. If this carried on, she would hurt him.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out his Sky God Crown. He used his God of Wealth
identity to go to the God of Wealth Temple.</p>
<p>Han Sen was instantly sent back. He took off the Sky God
Crown.</p>
<p>The fire almost incinerated the God of Wealth Temple. If Han Sen
had not left there quickly, the entire temple would have been
burned to the ground. Han Sen kept cycling through his inventory.
They were all useless. Han Sen threw them all on the ground. There
was one thing Han Sen pulled out that made him stop all motion.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out a weird gene egg. The gene egg was half white
and half black. There was a white dot inside the black part and a
black dot inside the white part. It was the Ultimate Egg Han Sen
had recently come into possession of.</p>
<p>Han Sen had brought out many items. Even the Inch Grey Sword did
nothing to damage the fire. When that Ultimate Egg touched the
fire, there was a change.</p>
<p>Han Sen clearly felt that the Ultimate Egg had something that
resembled a heartbeat. The black and white tai chi symbol on it was
spinning Han Sen was like a drowning person gripping onto the
lifesaving rope as best as he could. He did not move. He just held
the gene egg and hoped that Ultimate Egg would save him and allow
him to live.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Egg reacted, but it was unable to help Han Sen out
of the situation he was in. The tai chi symbol spun slowly. It did
not fight or absorb the fire.</p>
<p>Han Sen put his power inside the Ultimate Egg. The Ultimate Egg
still felt useless. Even the Super God Spirit mode could not prompt
a reaction from it.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen was really weak. As a result, his Super God Spirit
mode was much weaker.</p>
<p>“If this continues, death is the only way forward. Let’s see
what happens, shall we?” Han Sen swallowed the Ultimate Egg. It
went into his belly.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have much hope, but he did not want to lie down
there and do nothing. To stay there and burn to death was
pointless.</p>
<p>When the Ultimate Egg entered his body, it displayed a magical
power. It went all over Han Sen’s body. The Ultimate Egg was in the
center of his body. His Super God Spirit mode was flipped by the
Ultimate Egg. It went from white to gold like a rising sun.</p>
<p>That gold power was something Han Sen was very familiar with.
The blonde Qin Wan’er had shown this off many times. This power
went against Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode to produce a reverse
Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body power was reversed by the Ultimate Egg. It became
a reverse Super God Spirit mode. The white Super God Spirit mode
was replaced by gold, and it was becoming brighter.</p>
<p>Previously, the Super God Spirit mode was restricted by the
universe. Now, it had just become a reverse Super God Spirit mode.
There were no more restrictions to inhibit him. Han Sen’s body felt
a whole lot more relaxed.</p>
<p>“Can the Ultimate Egg reverse Super God Spirit mode?” Han Sen
was shocked and happy. Han Sen now understood why some people had
bad luck after getting the Ultimate Egg. Ordinary people’s bodies
could not accept the reverse power that was suppressed by the
universe.</p>
<p>Even if they did not swallow the Ultimate Egg as Han Sen did,
carrying it around would affect them. To get restricted by the
universe led to unfortunate things, which was fairly normal to
see.</p>
<p>Although the Ultimate Egg was not that simple, seeing how it
could reverse a power, one could understand how cursed of an item
it was.</p>
<p>“Who was the Wu Wei Dao Alpha? Was he really born with this
Ultimate Egg?” Han Sen was shocked as he wondered about that
mystery.</p>
<p>The reverse Super God Spirit mode was different from the
ordinary Super God Spirit mode. Each of them was the opposite of
the other.</p>
<p>The Super God Spirit mode was a soft power. When Han Sen’s body
became a spirit, it gave his body an invincible power. He was not
hurt by any type of power.</p>
<p>In the universe, not many powers could hurt him. Not many powers
could hurt him in his Super God Spirit mode form. Destroying the
Super God Spirit mode was an even harder task.</p>
<p>The reverse Super God Spirit mode was different. Han Sen felt
that the reverse Super God Spirit mode possessed some type of
suction force. It pulled Han Sen’s body into a vortex.</p>
<p>Initially, he was wreathed in the fires of the Mirror Moon
candle. Now, he had been sucked into the reverse Super God Spirit
mode. Even the half-burned candle was sucked in.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon was sucked into Han Sen’s brain, where it still
burned. Han Sen’s body was filled with fire.</p>
<p>Before, Han Sen was like a burning fire man. Now, he was a human
glass bottle that had a fire burning within.</p>
<p>It made Han Sen feel even worse. The reverse Super God Spirit
mode consumed Mirror Moon and its fire, but it could not melt it.
It was melting in the fire, and it was melting fast.</p>
<p>“Even though the Super God Spirit mode has become a reverse
Super God Spirit mode, the mass has not changed. I still cannot
fight the Mirror Moon fire.” Han Sen was disappointed. The reverse
Super God Spirit mode was still unable to save his life.</p>
<p>While Han Sen wallowed in that disappointment, the Ultimate Egg
exhibited more changes. The reverse Super God Spirit mode was
turning into a Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s gold Super God Spirit mode became white again. The
difference was that Mirror Moon was burning inside him.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Li looked at Han Sen with shock. They
did not know what was going on. They had watched Han Sen become
gold and then become white.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he was being played by the Ultimate Egg. The
guy before them was able to keep reversing his power. It was like
Yin and Yang. To him, it was something that was easy to toy with.
Han Sen sometimes had the reverse Super God Spirit mode. Other
times, he had the main Super God Spirit mode. They kept changing.
It was like they were playing wheel of fortune.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in a terrible state. He was heavily injured, and his
powers were weak. He had been burned by the fire for an extremely
long time now. He was going to die.</p>
<p>He had been played by the Ultimate Egg, and it was taking Han
Sen’s life too. His resistance against the damage was failing.</p>
<p>The existence of the Ultimate Egg did not help Han Sen. It
actually put him in more danger.</p>
<p>Within that danger, Han Sen gleamed a faint strand of hope.</p>
<p>“If the Super God Spirit mode can break the world, maybe I will
have the chance of living…” The Ultimate Egg had disturbed Han
Sen’s power. It made him lose his power. At the same time, Han Sen
felt the reverse Super God Spirit mode and understood how he might
reverse things. For him, this was a chance.</p>
