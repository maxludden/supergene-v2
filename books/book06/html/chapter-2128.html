<p>“Alu-Alu-Alu!”</p>
<p>The insane storm of punches was difficult to comprehend. Xie
Qing King’s eyes gleamed with a fiery silver. The silver punches he
threw were indestructible. Odoga had a snowflake’s chance in trying
to repel those wild hits headed his way.</p>
<p>Odoga waved his six arms to protect himself as light, dark, and
chaos powers worked together in an attempt to devastate Xie Qing
King.</p>
<p>But the raging Xie Qing King cared little for what his opponent
was attempting to do. His fists were the ones in control now, and
there was only one thing they wanted to do: attack. He wanted to
pulverize Odoga, to pound him so hard that he’d be
indistinguishable from the mud of the ground. Ignoring Odoga’s
attack, he went forward and allowed himself to be hit.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King and Odoga were both fully committed to the
assault, though. The cruelest and bloodiest fight of the Geno Being
Scroll was only just beginning.</p>
<p>Odoga’s six fists, with scary powers, came raging at Xie Qing
King. And as this occurred, Xie Qing King used his own power to
repeatedly pummel Odoga.</p>
<p>Armor was broken, flesh was tom, blood was spraying; the two of
them were using the most primal and primitive methods to fight with
each other.</p>
<p>Odoga’s six fists had the advantage, unfortunately. But this did
not at all mean that Xie Qing King, who only had a natural pair of
fists, was weak. And the more damage he incurred, the stronger he
became.</p>
<p>His fists moved like lightning, and the shadows they cast were
of spilling blood and breaking bone.</p>
<p>Odoga raged and screamed at his unrelenting opponent. His body
was severely wounded by the wrath of his nemesis, and he couldn’t
help but let out a shout due to the insufferable pain.</p>
<p>Both of them were accumulating wounds. Blood sprayed through the
air like flower petals, but neither showed a sign of backing off.
Their repeated strikes only looked to be getting crazier and
crazier.</p>
<p>“Oh God! This is no longer a competition. This is a
bloodbath!”</p>
<p>This is far too cruel. This is far too violent.”</p>
<p>“Ha… Ha… This is what a real fight should be like. Oh, I love
this!”</p>
<p>“This is rather interesting, I must confess. It’s more
satisfying to watch such a raw fight.”</p>
<p>“F*ck yeah! Kill him. Go on!”</p>
<p>The audience was ravenous for more. The violence of the fight
drew an insatiable bloodlust from them, driving their excitement
The adrenaline levels of the audience were through the roof.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Odoga and Xie Qing King flew away from each other. One of them
crashed into a mountainside, whereas the other dropped into an open
field.</p>
<p>They were both severely injured. Odoga’s six arms had all been
broken. Some of them had been tom off completely, whereas others
hung on by the thread of their tendons. Only two were still
completely attached, but even they were sorely injured.</p>
<p>The three faces were swollen and distended, and one eye had been
squelched. Blood was soaking the Earl’s entire form.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King was not faring much better than his foe. His legs
had been broken, his right shoulder had been dislocated, both of
his eyes had been shattered, and all of his ribs had been snapped
or cracked. With the amount of blood soaking him, there was only
one thing you could call him: a blood man.</p>
<p>But Xie Qing King’s lifeforce, despite all that, was none the
weaker. In fact, its glow had increased. He picked himself up from
the soil pit and shone with a silver light. That light enveloped
his entire body like a hungry fire.</p>
<p>Odoga looked gloomy, by comparison. After lifting himself up on
the field, he generated a power. Light and dark energies gathered
at the knuckles of his fists, giving each of them a swirling
mixture of black and white lights.</p>
<p>As Odoga’s power increased, the black and white powers were like
taichi. A strange power was keeping them both in perfect
balance.</p>
<p>Seeing Odoga and Xie Qing King collecting their strength, the
audience knew that whatever was next would be it. Their final
strikes were coming.</p>
<p>With the condition the two of them were in, generating that much
power meant that it had to be the final attack.</p>
<p>You are strong, but you are still weaker than me. You may
concede now, if you want to live.” Odoga’s fist, channeling all
that energy, was reaching max capacity as he spoke.</p>
<p>The scary powers made everything around him vibrate. The
dimension of the space he occupied seemed to distort and twist
under the black and white powers he carried.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, but I am afraid that I do not know what you are
getting at. My vocabulary seems to be lacking a few words, and I
think what you’ve just said may be among the missing ones.” Blood
streamed from Xie Qing King’s eyes. He had a strange smile, and a
silver flame propelled him forward.</p>
<p>“Light, dark, and chaos. Together, they are the most stable
elements one could ever hope to possess. They combine together to
create the Destroyed Light. It is the most powerful godlight in the
entire geno universe. When this strike falls upon you, you will be
nothing more than a memory. I like you, truth be told, and I would
favor the prospect of allowing you to live and not killing you.
Furthermore, if you pledge to join the Destroyed, I will allow you
to win,” Odoga slowly said.</p>
<p>“The only way I can allow myself to win is if I annihilate every
enemy that stands in my way. Show me everything you’ve got. Don’t
hold back, and come and fight me,” Xie Qing King said. His silver
flame was like the final swell of a volcano ready to erupt.</p>
<p>“If you want to die, then so be it.” Odoga’s power exploded. The
attack his fist unleashed came soaring over to Xie Qing King.</p>
<p>Black and white powers blended together. It looked as if it
could obliterate anything in its path as it headed toward Xie Qing
King. Everything that came into contact with that swirling power
would likely be destroyed.</p>
<p>Just the shockwave of that power was enough to tear up the land
for miles around and sunder the skies into ruin.</p>
<p>“The last Xie Qing cannon.” The armor on Xie Qing King’s body
shattered under the swelling of his own power. He stood upon the
battlefield with his upper body naked, bearing an evil grin. His
eyes were bleeding, and while he could not see, he could still
sense the location of his opponent. His punch was unleashed, headed
for the godlight possessed by the Destroyed man.</p>
<p>The silver fist became an orb of light. It came forward to
strike the black and white powers simultaneously.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The two scary powers collided with each other, and what resulted
was akin to the detonation of a hydrogen bomb. The giant explosion
looked like a sun going supernova, consuming everything in its
proximity. It was too bright for anyone to actually see anything
inside it, though.</p>
<p>When the lights finally dimmed, a giant chasm was all that
remained. Inside that deep crater, one person was left standing.
The other person writhed around on the ground, struggling to get
up.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King looked at Odoga trying to get up off of the
ground. Slicking back his silver hair, he coldly said, “You are
strong, but you are weaker than I. And since you now seem to
understand my power, I will spare your life. Go back, practice for
a few hundred years, and then get back to me. Perhaps by then you
will stand a 0.0001 percent chance of defeating me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be back.” Odoga could not get up. He ripped up his paper
and disappeared from the field of battle.</p>
<p>“I am invincible, no matter where I go!” Xie Qing King ran his
fingers through his hair and disappeared from that corner of the
dimension.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>As soon as Xie Qing King was teleported back out of the Geno
Being Scroll, his injured body collapsed. The will to win and the
accompanying adrenaline were the only things that had kept him
going.</p>
