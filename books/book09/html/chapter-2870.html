<p>While Han Sen was worried about Golden Growler, Golden Growler
suddenly opened his mouth. This time, it did not bite in the
direction of Very High Leader.</p>
<p>Golden Growler’s mouth exuded a gold light. Golden lights came
out like a hose. Inside that golden light, something else
appeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the corner of the golden substance. It had some
carvings that were both beautiful and weird. When that thing
emerged, Han Sen clearly saw it was a door coming out of Golden
Growler’s mouth.</p>
<p>The door looked as if it was made of gold. It was hundreds of
feet tall. The door had some weird and mysterious flower symbols.
It made people feel scared and have a desire to obey with a
magnitude that could not be described. Han Sen did not understand
what those flower symbols were like, but the beast head on the door
was something Han Sen recognized. It was Golden Growler’s face.</p>
<p>The golden door was surrounded by a golden halo. One could not
see the door frame. The strangest thing about it was that no matter
which angle one looked at it from, one only saw the front face of
the door. It was like that golden door did not have a back, or its
back was blended into the backdrop of space. It was like it was
from a different world.</p>
<p>“Why did Golden Growler’s belly have a golden door inside it?”
Han Sen felt weird. He did not know what the golden door did.</p>
<p>Very High Leader frowned as he looked at the golden door. He did
not know what it was either.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“Weird. The growlers are always so violent. I have never heard
of one using a treasure before, but Golden Growler is using a
treasure. What does this golden door do?”</p>
<p>Every creature was discussing its presence. No one had ever seen
this golden door before. They were unable to come up with a
suitable conclusion. Even the higher races, such as the Extreme
King and Very High, could only stare at that door in wonder. They
wanted to know what the door did.</p>
<p>Dong! When Golden Growler growled, the door’s ring was shaken
open. It made a deep sound like a hammer.</p>
<p>When the door ring was hit open, the golden door made a katcha
sound and opened up a little. Gold light spilled from the slightly
ajar door.</p>
<p>Everybody’s eyes were opened wide. They stared at the ajar door,
desperate to see what was inside.</p>
<p>The golden door opened slowly. The gap was only enough for a
fist. So far, people could only see golden light. Before they could
figure it out or see what lay beyond, they suddenly heard Very High
Leader make a weird sound. “This is…” Very High Leader stared at
the golden door. His expression immediately changed. In the next
moment, Very High Leader’s body had some weird power that spread
like the tide.</p>
<p>Everybody thought Very High Leader was going to fight back, but
Very High Leader moved his body. He ripped space and exited the
space battleground.</p>
<p>The whole universe was dead silent. No one believed Very High
Leader was willing to concede and leave the geno god list.</p>
<p>“Holy crap… What is this golden door? The door did not even open
and yet, Very High Leader was scared away.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I want to know more about that golden door.”</p>
<p>“That is so depressing. Very High Leader quit too fast. Even if
he decided to leave, he should have waited until the door was
opened to let us see what lay beyond it.”</p>
<p>Everyone was both shocked and depressed. After Very High Leader
was gone, Golden Growler opened his mouth and put the golden door
away. No one knew what was inside the golden door.</p>
<p>“Huh, that old man was smart,” the green-haired beast said with
a smile. He looked cocky. “Little Mountain Leader is
invincible.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was confused. He did not see what was inside the golden
door. What could have scared Very High Leader away? “Interesting.”
God looked at Golden Growler with interest and that was all. Han
Sen was disappointed to not hear his explanation.</p>
<p>That fight made Golden Growler and the golden door’s name
explode across the universe. Just opening it ajar was enough to
scare away Very High Leader was immensely terrifying.</p>
<p>After this fight, Golden Growler was already the first rank in
the geno god list. No one was really able to dethrone him.</p>
<p>In fact, no one dared to challenge Golden Growler. He had scared
off Very High Leader, so that performance was too scary. As some
people looked for Very High Leader to request an explanation on
what happened, Very High Leader only answered, “Right now, the
universe does not have a creature that can fight Golden
Growler.”</p>
<p>After he said that, Golden Growler’s title increased even more.
It made other creatures even more scared of him. No one dared to
challenge Golden Growler.</p>
<p>The top rank was supposed to be very popular and competitive,
but it was now cold. the rankings below it had become more popular.
Han Sen a shock was shocked by the fact that Lou Lie was ranked
third. He challenged Demon Alpha, who was in fourth. This
lower-level challenge made people drop their glasses. Everybody was
excited about this fight. Lou Lie was a very mysterious character.
He was the biggest black horse, aside from Dollar, in the geno god
list fights. Demon Alpha’s killing of Dragon One shocked the whole
universe. The two of them fighting made everyone concerned.</p>
<p>Lou Lie must be in Blood Legion. Why is he challenging Demon
Alpha? Are the people of Blood Legion suspicious about Demon Alpha
and the shura people? Are they trying to find out who Demon Alpha
is? Han Sen kept thinking. There was only one possibility.
Otherwise, he would not have to lower his level.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he could see something in this fight, but Demon
Alpha did not even respond to the challenge. He merely gave up. The
funnier thing was that after Demon Alpha gave up, his rank
increased. She went from fourth to third. The winner, Lou Lie, was
made fourth.</p>
<p>“Your rules are so unscientific.” Han Sen was a bit speechless
as he looked at God drinking his tea and chilling.</p>
<p>God smiled and asked, “Isn’t it interesting?”</p>
<p>The challenges had been going on, but the rankings did not
change much. That was especially true of the top 10. There were not
many changes there. Han Sen was watching them for six days. One of
the top 10 dropped out, but the other nine remained in the top 10.
Some of their positions changed. Han Sen waited many days, but no
one seemed to challenge Burning Lamp. He was depressed, but then he
saw the space battleground flicker with light. Burning Lamp and
another name appeared. Someone is challenging Burning Lamp. Han Sen
was delighted. He looked at the space battleground and saw Burning
Lamp enter the space battleground. Han Sen did not see him wielding
a knife.</p>
<p>Another shape took form in the space battleground too. It was
the one above Han Sen. It was number 99. It was a deified
xenogeneic called Pluto Peacock.</p>
