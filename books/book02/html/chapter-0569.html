    <p>
      While Son of Heaven was still in shock, he saw the Snow Charmer raise her
      lance again. A flaming bird of fire soared through the sky, looking like a
      phoenix, raining fire down on the battlefield.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah! It&#8217;s an aura-type beast soul. How does that work?&#8221;
      The look on Son of Heaven&#8217;s face was bleak. An aura-type beast soul
      employed area-of-effect techniques best designed to go against groups of
      opponents. It was something sought after by numerous parties and shelters.
      He was in disbelief at the sight of an aura-type beast soul being used by
      a royal spirit. Even worse, the radius of the attack seemed significant,
      which might have suggested it was a sacred-blood aura-type beast soul. The
      color drained from his face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven&#8217;s assessment was incorrect, however. The range of a
      Desert Bird&#8217;s aura was no different than the Second Shelter&#8217;s
      sacred-blood beast soul; the difference between the two was in power.
      Still, it was an intimidating attack and its efficiency was still quite
      remarkable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Demon had been totally restrained by the attack, and no matter what
      beast soul it had or at what quality, it could not overcome the Snow
      Charmer&#8217;s bombardment. They were both royal spirits, yet the Demon
      could not compete with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even without the Desert Bird, the double Berserk armor and glyph would
      have proven too much for the Demon to breach.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Snow Charmer paid no heed to the fruitless attacks of the Demon and
      traded them for a significant blow to her opponent&#8217;s weak point. In
      reaction to the critical hit, the Demon fell backwards, screaming in
      agony.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too strong. This is sick!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I had those beast souls, I&#8217;d be that strong, too.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is no longer an arena, it&#8217;s a showcase of one&#8217;s
      richness!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yep, the Snow Charmer&#8217;s owner is too freaking rich!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I may not know who that person is, but I didn&#8217;t think they
      could get sicker than Son of Heaven.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s like two fairies competing, in that it has nothing to do
      with us.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>â€¦</p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven couldn&#8217;t stop his face from twisting and contorting as
      he viewed the battle. After a while, he ordered his Demon to throw in the
      towel. Acknowledging his opponent&#8217;s victory, he felt extremely
      depressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If she killed the Demon, every sacred-blood beast soul he possessed would
      be gone. Even someone like Son of Heaven could not incur such a
      significant financial blow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bring him to me. I want to see who this person is.&#8221; Son of
      Heaven gritted his teeth. From what had just happened, he felt humiliated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhang Xiang quickly went in search of Han Sen and when he found him, said,
      &#8220;Mister Han, the boss wants to see you!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhang Xiang did not dare refer to Han Sen as &#8220;brother,&#8221;
      anymore. The performance of the Snow Charmer had well and truly rattled
      him. He knew that Han Sen was an extraordinary character and could not
      possibly be any lower in status than Son of Heaven himself. He now felt
      the need to refer to him more appropriately.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Son of Heaven?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Zhang Xiang and quietly
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Zhang Xiang replied.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then casually said, &#8220;If he wants to see me, then tell him to
      come down and meet me. I don&#8217;t have the time or interest to go up
      there.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But&#8230; Mister Han, please, wait here for a moment.&#8221; Zhang
      Xiang, having received his permission for an audience with him, ran off to
      inform Son of Heaven.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fine, I will go and see who you are.&#8221; After Son of Heaven
      heard what he had said. He suppressed the anger he felt in his heart and
      followed Zhang Xiang back down to Han Sen&#8217;s room.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment he pushed the door open and laid eyes upon Han Sen, he
      stiffened as if he had just suffered petrification. He just stood in the
      door frame and did not move.
    </p>

    <p>
      He could not believe that the Snow Charmer&#8217;s owner was Han Sen. He
      could not believe that Han Sen, who had only just gained access to the
      Second Shelter, had already amassed such a fortune.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How is this possible?&#8221; Son of Heaven&#8217;s face was a
      mixture of conflicting emotions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhang Xiang was standing behind Son of Heaven, looking at him with shock.
      He was used to seeing Son of Heaven as cocky and intimidating, but this
      was the first time he had ever seen him show restraint.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Does he not dare to go inside fully? God, what happened? Who is
      that man named Han? He seems to have stricken fear into Son of Heaven
      himself!&#8221; Zhang Xiang thought, looking upon Son of Heaven&#8217;s
      face but misunderstanding him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven was not afraid of Han Sen, it was just that Ning&#8217;s
      family avoided Han Jing and they had issued a decree stating no member of
      the Ning family could have any contact or conflict with Han Sen. So, when
      Son of Heaven saw Han Sen, he was crippled with shock and was unsure of
      what to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not dare throw Han Sen out, but he knew that he couldn&#8217;t be
      friends with him, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you want to see me? What are you standing there for;
      aren&#8217;t you going to say your bit?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Son of
      Heaven with amused confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You. Why have you come here?&#8221; Son of Heaven wasn&#8217;t
      exactly sure what to say. He had never bowed to anyone else before, and he
      wasn&#8217;t used to showing modesty or courtesy. An unexpected meeting
      such as this made Son of Heaven uncomfortable, and it clashed with the way
      he generally presented himself to others.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I heard there was a sacred-blood beast soul up for grabs here at
      the arena, so I came to take it. Can I have the Four-Winged Thunderbird
      now?&#8221; Han Sen smiled wryly as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven&#8217;s eyebrows jumped as he looked at Han Sen, and then
      said emotionlessly, &#8220;Zhang Xiang, give him the Four-Winged
      Thunderbird.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhang Xiang had never seen Son of Heaven behave like this before. He was
      flabbergasted, but he nodded and then went to retrieve and deliver the
      Four-Winged Thunderbird to its new, rightful owner.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, there it is. Well, I have what I came for. I should get going
      now, perhaps I&#8217;ll see you around.&#8221; Han Sen took the beast soul
      and prepared to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      Son of Heaven&#8217;s face looked quite ghastly, and he moved his lips as
      if to say something, but then stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen left the Demon shelter almost immediately. The human shelters were
      well-developed around here, but it made it more difficult to kill
      creatures here than on the ice fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were too many people. If you weren&#8217;t attacking a spirit
      shelter, you&#8217;d most likely end up competing against others for the
      kills of the local creatures. The greater resources a place had, the more
      people it would attract. It was unavoidable, really.
    </p>

    <p>Back in the Crystal Palace, Han Sen teleported to the Alliance.</p>

    <p>
      Now that he had both swords, he just needed to perfect the Dual-blade
      skill itself. After that was done, he could finally tackle the spirit
      shelter he wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the Alliance, he stuck to refining the Dual sword skill each and
      every day. He practiced and practiced to ensure that he could master it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because beast souls couldn&#8217;t be used on Skynet, Han Sen stuck to
      practicing in the training room. At the same time, he was trying to
      perfect his wielding of the Silver-Eye Ice Snake King sword and
      Purple-Copper Ancient Mascot Beast sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie wasn&#8217;t particularly thrilled about Han Sen occupying the only
      high-class training room all the time, because that was the only room that
      had artificial gravity.
    </p>

    <p>
      To have gravity support, you had to visit the gravity chamber. But the
      things that you were able to do in such chambers were quite limited, and
      those places were too restrictive to train freely. For this, Annie was
      quite upset.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Annie arrived that day, she saw that the high-class training room was
      still in use. She bit her lip and went to the control room. She wanted to
      take a look at what Han Sen was doing in there. If he was training in
      there, then she&#8217;d let him be, but if he wasn&#8217;t, she was
      determined to kick him out.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a guard of Ji Yanran, Annie had great authority. Quickly, she obtained
      the tape of footage from the training room and took a look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Training a sword skill?&#8221; Annie saw Han Sen in the video
      training with two beast soul swords.
