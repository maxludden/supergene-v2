<h2>Getting Sword</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3238</h3>

<p>Qin Yuan had the Demon God Sword. The presence of the sword was
like a demon god air that was tearing through the rules of
creation. It was like no power was able to dull the sharpness of
the sword.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had seen Break World powers
become solid. It meant Han Sen’s Break World power had not become a
solid level yet.</p>
<p>Concerning the Break World scales, one could certainly tell Qin
Yuan was a whole level stronger than Han Sen.</p>
<p>The Break World level did not truly determine if power was
stronger or weaker. Han Sen calmly looked at Qin Yuan and his Demon
God Sword. The Dongxuan Sutra was used to break the world
again.</p>
<p>The whole universe’s most basic level was in front of Han Sen.
The world Han Sen saw now was different from what people and their
ordinary eyes saw.</p>
<p>The Demon God Sword was a heavy black sword. It was ridiculously
heavy, but its power was truly shocking.</p>
<p>If this was an ordinary person going against it, all they would
see was a black and overbearing sword. The sword air, which was
like the flames from a demon god, was on the heavy sword.</p>
<p>In Han Sen’s eyes, it was different. From what Han Sen saw, the
heavy sword was made of some sort of weird substance chain. It was
different from the substances around the place. It just didn’t
match.</p>
<p>From what Han Sen sensed, the Demon God Sword did not just exist
alone. It had a strong tie with Qin Yuan’s body. The two of them
had many connections and ties, all of which one could not see with
one’s eyes.</p>
<p>“It looks like the reason Break World power can become solid is
for using the Break World power to build your own rules. It is
fighting the rules right now. With the solid part as its base, it
will be stronger than using Break World powers. You won’t get
suppressed by the rules of the universe easily either.” Han Sen now
understood the benefits of Break World powers becoming solid.</p>
<p>“Demon God Pierce Through the Heart Sword.” Qin Yuan’s eyes
looked cold. He waved his Demon God Sword. The heavy sword moved in
an amazing way that ignored the fabric of space. It pierced right
through Han Sen’s heart.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body reacted. For some reason, after dodging, the
Demon God Sword had still managed to perforate his chest.</p>
<p>The sword pierced through Han Sen’s muscles and bones. It
pierced right through his heart. The back of the sword plunged
through to emerge from his back. While Qin Yuan clutched his sword,
he coldly said, “It is just like I told you. Even if you have the
ability to fight something that can take you up to the sky, today
was the day you die. You die here and now.” He made it sound as if
this was meant to be and there was no need to worry about it.</p>
<p>“Is this your Break World power? Can it pierce through one’s
heart?” Han Sen stood in space and lowered his head. He tried to
look at the Demon God Sword in his chest.</p>
<p>IO</p>
<p>“Not bad.” Qin Yuan proudly said, “It does not just puncture
one’s heart. If I want to, I can have this sword pierce through
anywhere on your body. Even a God Spirit cannot dodge the power of
my Demon God Sword.” “It’s such a scary power,” Han Sen said. “If
people like you were still living in this world, I would be afraid
your opponents would be very busy.”</p>
<p>“My enemies do not need to eat or sleep because they are already
all dead,” Qin Yuan said. He pulled the Demon God Sword out of Han
Sen’s chest.</p>
<p>“I do not want to be a dead man. Therefore, I must kill you.”
Han Sen reached out a hand. He clutched the blade of the Demon God
Sword.</p>
<p>“Hmph.” Qin Yuan did not believe what Han Sen had just told him.
The power of the Demon God Sword could slash through everything. It
was one of the strongest materials in the world. Nothing was able
to block how sharp the Demon God Sword was.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the blade. He only needed to pull it and the
blade would be broken.</p>
<p>Qin Yuan’s attempt to pull it back failed. The Demon God Sword
couldn’t be moved. It made Qin Yuan frown. He gathered up more
power to pull the sword back.</p>
<p>The Demon God Sword still failed to move. It was like it was
buried amidst a tangle of roots. It made Qin Yuan’s face change. He
looked at Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the sword in his hand. The part he was
holding onto was looking red, and the red color was still
spreading. It was like the veins buried beneath the skin were now
starting to show. The Demon God Sword’s body had veins spread
across it. Han Sen’s hand, which was holding onto it, was at the
center.</p>
<p>Qin Yuan felt rather unsafe. He tried his best to pull the Demon
God Sword back. He tried his hardest, but the Demon God Sword still
wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>Qin Yuan was even more scared because he was the one who
generated the Demon God Sword. Now, he felt his power in the Demon
God Sword was blocked. It was like a pipe that was clogged and
blocked through concrete.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the sword with a face that did not change.
His eyes, however, flashed with the colors of the rainbow. The
blood power in his hands kept going into the Demon God Sword.</p>
<p>Previously, Han Sen had only wanted to use the Dongxuan Sutra’s
power to fight Qin Yuan, but the power of the Demon God Sword
struck Han Sen and activated the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power. It
enabled him to block the Demon God Sword’s power.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had used the Dongxuan Sutra and
Blood-Pulse Sutra, two Break World powers, together. With those two
Break World powers, Han Sen learned something amazing.</p>
<p>The Break World power of the Dongxuan Sutra enabled him to
change the rules. The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s Break World power enabled
things to be returned to their origin. When the two powers applied
their magic to the Demon God Sword, Han Sen noticed he was able to
use the Dongxuan Sutra to slash the connection between the Demon
God Sword and Qin Yuan. The Blood-Pulse Sutra, meanwhile, could
make the Demon God Sword return to its origin. It was like it was
being reborn and was no longer controlled by the whims of Qin
Yuan.</p>
<p>Because the Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra had only
achieved their Break World powers, their level was not that high.
Therefore, modifying the Demon God Sword was not something that
could be done in a hurry. Now, only the section Han Sen was holding
was modified. Other areas of the sword were still being modified,
just at a much slower pace.</p>
<p>Even so, the power of the Demon God Sword was useless to Han
Sen. Qin Yuan wanted to use the Demon God Sword’s power to cut Han
Sen’s hand, but that was impossible.</p>
<p>Plus, the humans of the universe of kingdoms did not practice.
They all depended on outside powers. A solid Break World weapon was
generated. That meant people put many powers into their Break World
weapons.</p>
<p>Now, a Break World weapon was not working. Qin Yuan had lost
half of his power</p>
<p>Since Qin Yuan had lost half of his power, competing via
strength seemed unlikely. Even in his best period of time, he could
not fight Han Sen with power.</p>
<p>Qin Yuan shouted loudly. He used a power that was kind of like
drinking milk. The Demon God Sword, which was still in Han Sen’s
hand, could not be moved. The red veins went all over the Demon God
Sword.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>When the Demon God Sword was fully red, it shook away Qin Yuan’s
hands. Qin Yuan shockingly looked at the Demon God Sword that was
in Han Sen’s chest. He could not believe the Demon God Sword he
generated could no longer be controlled by him. It even ended up
shirking his hand away.</p>
