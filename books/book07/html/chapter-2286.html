<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen was about to say something, but a scary sound cut him
off. And then, the white whale suddenly flipped and started to
sink.</p>
<p>Many forces of horrible powers lashed the white whale, and each
strike was like the crack of thunder.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the big white whale was pretty solid. The
shockwaves of combat coming from Yisha and Fox Queen were not
enough to break the hull. But even so, the impacts were driving it
deeper into the sea.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The whale shook under their feet as if it had just hit
something, and after that, they heard the sound of something large
being destroyed. Then, there was only silence. The white whale was
no longer being tossed about.</p>
<p>Looking out the white whale’s eyes, they couldn’t see anything
except seawater and piles of rock. It looked as if the big white
whale had been crushed under an enormous pile of rubble far below
the surface.</p>
<p>The sea around them was swirling like mad. Even though they were
far enough underwater that they could hear the fight overhead, they
still saw occasional shockwaves rolling through the water. The
turbulence had, however, slowed down a lot. The white whale was now
buried by the stone, and it could no longer move. That made Han Sen
feel better, at least.</p>
<p>“This white whale is a machine!” Crime looked around the control
room in shock. The revelation had obviously caught him off
guard.</p>
<p>Mister White was also looking about the big white whale with
interest.</p>
<p>Big King Bell, who wasn’t the original owner, had been able to
control the big white whale. Han Sen figured that Mister White
probably could as well.</p>
<p>Anyone could control a machine like that, as long as it wasn’t
locked down. It should work on essentially the same principles as
any other machine.</p>
<p>“Don’t move it!” Mister White shouted, just as Han Sen was about
to move the skeleton on the command chair.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped and waited as Mister White and Crime came to the
control deck.</p>
<p>“What have you learned, Mister White?” Han Sen asked
politely.</p>
<p>Mister White looked at the skeleton and said, “If I understand
the situation correctly, this skeleton is the key that makes it
possible to control the white whale.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He had previously watched Big King Bell
jump around on the platform, but he didn’t think much of it since
the bell was able to control the white whale.</p>
<p>But Han Sen now saw the thing he had missed earlier. Big King
Bell must have used the white whale for a long time, but the bell
had never moved the skeleton. There must have been a reason for
that.</p>
<p>“Mister White, where do you think this technology came from?”
Han Sen asked Mister White.</p>
<p>Mister White shook his head. “This is the first time I have ever
come across something like this. I don’t know how to control it,
either.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Mister White looked at the skeleton and said,
“But judging from its clothing, this person must have been
connected to the control systems. His remains must be the key to
controlling this entire machine. I cannot tell what might happen if
we were to remove them.”</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the skeleton’s clothes and started thinking.
The skeleton’s uniform was silver and black, and aside from the
head, the entire body was wrapped up tight.</p>
<p>It wore a transparent mask that was connected to the uniform.
There was no visible seam.</p>
<p>Han Sen spent some time observing it, and although he couldn’t
find a connection between the chair and the uniform, he thought the
uniform and the white whale must have been linked somehow.</p>
<p>Han Sen activated the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine the
uniform, the platform, and the chair.</p>
<p>There were many powerful relics that the Purple-Eye Butterfly
could tell Han Sen very little about. But if the item in question
was some sort of technology, the Purple-Eye Butterfly was
incredibly useful in revealing how it had been made and what its
purpose was.</p>
<p>When the Purple-Eye Butterfly rewound, Han Sen could see the
entire process of the white whale’s creation. What he witnessed
gave Han Sen quite the surprise.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the white whale was one of the most powerful
technologies to ever exist in the entire universe. The process of
creating it had been very complicated. It was even harder to build
than a deified weapon.</p>
<p>It was doubtlessly so complicated because there was a lot of
science involved. Every problem that arose with each individual
part of the machine had to be solved through science.</p>
<p>If Han Sen could analyze every facet of the white whale’s
technology, leveling up the Alliance’s technological advancement
would be easy.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the most shocking thing, either. As Han Sen watched
the construction of the white whale, he saw the shadow of the
beetle.</p>
<p>Although the white whale was more advanced than the beetle, the
concept of their creation was similar. The white whale was just on
a whole new level. The technology of the white whale, in every
possible way, far exceeded that of the beetle. Every detail was
better than the beetle’s, too.</p>
<p>“Is this crystallizer technology?” Han Sen wondered in shock.
The more he saw of the big white whale, the more accurate his guess
seemed to be.</p>
<p>“Was the technology of the crystallizers ever this good? Could
they make machines of a deified level? That’s a very frightening
idea,” Han Sen mused.</p>
<p>That would explain why the crystallizers challenged a higher
race despite lacking deified elites of their own. Having such
technology probably gave them the confidence to start a fight for a
lantern.</p>
<p>In the end, however, their arrogance and hubris had led to their
failure and downfall. As a result, the race was almost entirely
destroyed.</p>
<p>“What a shame. If the crystallizers had challenged a less
powerful higher race, they could have definitely claimed a lantern.
And then, they would have developed even further. They would
probably have become one of the top races in the universe.” Han Sen
sighed.</p>
<p>But Han Sen then realized that if the crystallizers had become a
higher race, they would have continued to develop their technology.
They wouldn’t have wanted to change their genes and blood pulse.
They might never have experimented with their genes, and if that
was so, humans would never have come into existence.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you still have the relic, right?” Mister White asked
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking me this?” Han Sen looked at Mister
White.</p>
<p>Mister White smiled and said, “I left a trace so that you could
follow us, and that means I wish to continue our venture of
cooperation. Before one of those two wins the fight above us, we
should explore the holy town.”</p>
<p>“What made you think I’d catch up with you?” Han Sen asked
Mister White with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Because I believe in you,” Mister White said gently.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared back at Mister White. Han Sen hadn’t believed
that the two of them were very close, but Mister White had just
claimed to have an unbelievable amount of faith in him. He gazed
into Mister White’s eyes and acknowledged the sincerity within
them. This wasn’t just another bargain for Mister White.</p>
<p>But for some reason, when Han Sen looked deep into Mister
White’s eyes, he had a familiar feeling. It was as if they had
already met a long time ago.</p>
