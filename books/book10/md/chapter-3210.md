  There was fear in the young lady’s eyes, but she still listened to the priest and went toward the Destiny Well. At this time, the blood spring in the Destiny Well was almost gone. The priest shouted at the girl, “Do not be afraid! Just use the same method that I have always taught you! It will be fine!”

“Yes,” the young lady replied. She walked in front of the Destiny Well and brandished her sacrificial knife. She drew it across her wrist to leak her blood into the well.

The wound was deceptively small. While a preliminary examination of the wound would have revealed that it was not very big, quite a lot of blood was drawn. There was so much red blood flowing that it could be compared to a faucet that would not close. With blood gushing out of her, the young lady let it all pour into the murky waters of the Destiny Well.

It was a strange scene. When the lady’s blood touched the well water, the well water coming out started going back in. Han Sen had been intensely watching the young lady, but he did not notice anything special about her. She did not show any sign of possessing a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, and she did not have a gene race. She was just a commoner.

“If that wasn’t a Blood-Pulse belonging to the Qin family and she does not have a high-class God Spirit Blood-Pulse, why would they use this girl for the blood sacrifice?” Han Sen wondered. While the girl bled, the Destiny Well returned to normal. The wound was not large, but as all that blood spilled out of her, it was not too long before the young lady’s face started to look pale.

Suddenly, the chains of the well made a “wa-la, wa-la” noise. The broken black chains again came out of the Destiny Well like a pair of lashing, toxic snakes. They gripped the young lady’s injured hand. The young lady was pulled toward the Destiny Well. Qin Jing Zhen and the priest were shocked. The priest shouted at the young lady, “Hurry! Bring the chain up! If you get pulled down, you will die!”

The young lady gnashed her teeth and yanked the chain. She used two hands to pull it. Because the chains were so heavy and she had lost so much blood, it was difficult for her to pull.

The wounds on her wrist were still bleeding. They dripped on the black chains, dyeing them red.

Han Sen was confused. He did not know why they let this one girl pull it. After all, the Qin Kingdom had many elites. Was no one else going to help her?

Qin Jing Zhen watched the girl pull the chain inch by inch. He was shocked as he said, “Many kings of the Qin Kingdom cannot pull this chain. They can’t even pull them an inch. This girl does not have any power, yet she can pull it. It really is just as the legends say. The alpha has indeed blessed us with a desire for the Qin Kingdom to grow.”

The priest looked excited. “The Qin Kingdom has had so many Yin years, Yin months, Yin days, and Yin time ladies that have been born. Never have they proven themselves useful until today. Now, there is no waste. Whatever the alpha king left behind must be important.”

Han Sen heard them speak and understood that not every girl could do what she was doing. The Qin Kingdom had many of these young ladies, but only now was one being used.

Because pulling the chain was so hard, the young lady’s wounds were leaking even more. Her face went paler as time went by.

It was all very strange. The more she bled, the lighter the chain became and the more of the chain she was able to pull.

The Destiny Well made some metallic sounds. It sounded as if something metal had struck the wall. It sounded as if the item was almost up to the surface.

Everyone went to look at the well, wanting to know what the Qin Kingdom’s alpha had left behind inside the well.

As she pulled, there was a “dong” sound. Something struck the well. The girl pulled it, but she failed. The chain was heavy.

“Pull harder! You must pull it out!” the priest quickly yelled. He would have loved to help the girl pull it out.

Unfortunately, the alpha said only the girls born in a Yin year, Yin month, and Yin day, and at a Yin time could pull the chain out of the well. If anyone else touched the chain, whatever resided inside the Destiny Well would remain buried in there for all of time and never be revealed.

The priest knew a lot of things, but he would not dare help her. He just had to nervously wait on the side.

Qin Jing Zhen was nervous too. Although he did not exhibit any changes, his hands were clasped into a fist. He was not as calm as he looked.

Qin Bai was curious. He stuck his head out to look into the Destiny Well. From where he stood, he could not see what was inside the Destiny Well.

The young lady kept bleeding and trying to pull. She knew if she did not pull that thing up fast, the bleeding would kill her.

The young lady kept biting so hard that she was going to bleed. The chain finally moved again. She pulled it about two feet higher. The chain reached the end. The other side of the chain looked as if it was tied to a ring. The ring was made of black metal. It did not look gold, silver, bronze, or iron. It was unknown what kind of metal it was. It was strangely heavy.

The young lady kept pulling what was below the metal ring. It was a metal box.

Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes looked bright. He was a king, but he looked very excited. The thing inside the box might have been what it would take to reunite the Qin Kingdom, so it was hard for him not to feel excited.

The young lady almost couldn’t hold it. She had no God Spirit Blood-Pulse or the aid of a gene race. She used her natural strength to pull the chain. Plus, she had bled so much. If her will was not as stable as it was, she would have let it go and slipped into a coma.

The girl was bleeding from her mouth. She kept pulling the chain while stumbling back. She pulled part of the metal box out of the Destiny Well.

From what they saw, the height of the box was surprising. Its width was three feet, but it was at least four feet high. The bottom of the box still could not be seen.

Han Sen thought this was weird. He thought it was a box, but the box was very tall. If he looked at it horizontally, it was rectangular.

“Why does this box look like a strange coffin?” Han Sen thought.

Boom! Boom!

While Han Sen was thinking, the box was pulled out by the girl. It was outside of the well.

Everyone now saw what the box looked like. It was a box made from black metal. It was not a square, and there were no adornments on it.

As they looked at it, they saw it was six feet long and three feet wide. Han Sen thought it looked like a weird metal coffin.
