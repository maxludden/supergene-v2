	<p>“Where are the gene races?” Han Sen saw the skinning hide, but he did not see any of the gene races that were
		said to be protecting it.</p>

	<p>“If you can see that far, look toward the skinning hide’s grassy heart person’s face,” Bald Guy said.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked and noticed something weird. He thought the grassy heart person had a face. When he looked closer,
		he realized it wasn’t actually a face. It was a red butterfly that had weird markings. The butterfly was lying
		on the grassy person’s face. The pattern on its back resembled eyes. Its body was like a little person’s nose.
	</p>

	<p>Mister God One went on to say, “The skinning hide looks weird, but it is still some kind of grass. The grass
		heart looks a bit like a child, but it is not actually a child. It does not have facial structures like eyes or
		noses. In fact, what is on the grassy person’s face is a gene race that is called a blood eye butterfly.
		Ordinarily, the blood eye butterfly is marquise class. That level wouldn’t be too hard to deal with. If there
		was a boss blood eye butterfly around, we’d be tussling with a duke-class one. If there is a blood eye butterfly
		king, it would be king class.”</p>

	<p>“Even a king-class blood eye butterfly wouldn’t be hard for you to deal with.” Han Sen did not believe Mister God
		One was unable to deal with a king-class gene race.</p>

	<p>Mister God One presented a wry smile. “You overestimate me. The level of the blood eye butterfly is not high, but
		it can punch above its weight. If there are similar powers to fight back, even a god-class gene race might be
		beaten by it.” “Oh, what power is that?” Han Sen asked with curiosity. Mister God One looked at Bald Guy and
		said, “Brother Xia is a student of Mister Wei. He is better in that department than me. Let’s allow Brother Xia
		to explain things to us.”</p>

	<p>Bald Guy was not shy. He said it straight. “The blood eye butterfly is very weird. Its name contains the word
		‘eye,’ but it does not have any eye powers. It is a toxic element gene race. Its body can release toxic powers
		that can make others fall into an illusion. If it touches your skin or is breathed in by your mouth or nose, it
		can make you hallucinate. People tend to die during those hallucinations. The illusion-creating toxic powder is
		not what is most important about this beast. You just need a gene race that is powerful enough to combine with
		or use a gene race that can protect you. Do that, and you will not get infected by the toxic powder.”</p>

	<p>After pausing, Bald Guy went on to say, “The butterfly wings have patterns like eyes. They have a special ability
		that enables them to detect the approach of enemies. If that happens, the butterfly’s eye patterns release a red
		light. It might not look strong, as it looks like a red firefly, but if you see the red light, even god-class
		gene races might end up hallucinating.”</p>

	<p>“What if you don’t see it?” Han Sen asked.</p>

	<p>“It doesn’t work, even if you don’t look at it,” Bald Guy replied. “Did I not say the blood eye butterfly is not
		an eye gene race? It is toxic, and the red light is toxic. Even if you close your eyes and the red light touches
		you, you will still end up hallucinating. Against ordinary blood eye butterflies, you will be fine. if there is
		a king-class blood eye butterfly, even a god-class gene race might end up defeated.”</p>

	<p>While they were talking, a big snake was going down the mountain. It was as thick as a barrel. It reached the
		platform.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was seeing what Bald Guy had described. The eye patterns on the blood eye butterfly’s back flickered. It
		was like the grass person was opening and closing their eyes.</p>

	<p>The big snake looked very powerful. It opened its mouth, wanting to eat the skinning hide. Before the snake’s
		mouth could touch the skinning hide, it stopped.</p>

	<p>Han Sen watched a crazy scene unfold. The big snake went completely mad. It began eating its own body, using its
		mouth to eat its tail. Half of his body was inside itself. It created a snake ring. It looked very weird.</p>

	<p>Bzzt!</p>

	<p>A sky full of red butterflies fluttered. It was like a cloud of blood going into the non-moving big snake. A
		moment later, the big snake only had bones left.</p>

	<p>With the blood eye butterfly’s power, the leftover bones were tossed off the mountain. Han Sen looked down the
		mountain. The peacock king’s eyes were flickering. They peered through the mist of the mountain. He saw the
		bottom of the mountain possess a large mound of bones. Who knew how many gene races had been eaten and thrown
		down there by the blood eye butterfly?</p>

	<p>“That is a very powerful blood eye butterfly.” Han Sen had to compliment it.</p>

	<p>Mister God One said, “From what I have seen, in this group of blood eyes, there is a king. It might be a mutant
		king class.”</p>

	<p>“Really?” Bald Guy asked with shock.</p>

	<p>Mister God One presented a wry smile and said, “I am not going to lie. I have a toxic removal toad gene race at
		my disposal. This gene race is only king class, but it is very effective against toxic gene powers. I thought I
		could use this gene race to remove the blood eye butterfly, but who would have known there was a mutant
		king-class blood eye butterfly? It almost died there. That was why I asked for Han Sen’s help.”</p>

	<p>“The toxic removal toad gene uses a skill called toxic removal shield,” Bald Guy said with a nod. “It can break
		all kinds of toxic gene skills, but it cannot block the toxins unleashed by a king-class blood eye butterfly.
		There might be a mutant butterfly king.”</p>

	<p>Mister God One looked at Han Sen and said, “I heard Brother Han has a blood ghost spirit that can remove all
		toxins and debilitations. We will most surely require Han Sen’s aid.”</p>

	<p>“In that case, let me give it a go.” Han Sen put Bao’er aside. He summoned the blood ghost spirit and combined
		with it. After he combined with the gold wing peacock king, his evil-looking body looked to possess a blood
		aura. He looked even eviler. He was like some evil and handsome demon that had emerged from hell.</p>

	<p>With the strength of Han Sen’s body, he should have been able to be immune to the blood eye butterfly. Mister God
		One and the others were there with him. He did not want to make himself look too almighty.</p>

	<p>“You guys wait for me here. I will be right back.” After saying that, Han Sen flapped his wings and flew toward
		the skinning hide platform.</p>

	<p>In an instant, Han Sen landed on the platform. He saw the blood eye butterfly atop the skinning hide. The
		butterfly wing’s eye patterns shone. It was like many small red lanterns were glowing with a weird crimson
		light.</p>

	<p>The red lights did nothing to Han Sen. It was not able to invade the blood air from blood ghost spirit.</p>

	<p>Han Sen saw a lot of red dust scatter in the air. It had to have been the toxic powder from the blood eye
		butterfly that could cause hallucinations.</p>

	<p>To Han Sen, the toxic powder was practically useless. Han Sen landed on the platform. Suddenly, there was a sky
		full of butterflies. Amidst all of those blood eye butterflies, Han Sen saw one blood eye butterfly that was
		stranger than the rest.</p>

	<p>The blood eye butterflies were the same size. It was unknown if they were marquise or duke class. Aside from
		their powers being different, their appearances were the same.</p>

	<p>This blood eye butterfly was different. It was about the same size as the other blood eye butterflies, but it was
		purple.</p>

	<p>“That should be the mutant blood eye butterfly,” Han Sen thought.</p>
