<h2>Blood Kirin’s Movemen</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2261</h3>

<p>Han Sen spent another two weeks in the White Bone Hell. The
blood kirin came down from its mountain to absorb blood bone air
every day, and during such times, Han Sen got to interact with it
very closely.</p>
<p>The blood kirin had initially seemed like a cruel beast, but it
wasn’t showing any animosity toward Han Sen now, which made him
curious. The most probable cause for the blood kirin’s change in
behavior, he figured, was the blood kirin having tasted his
blood.</p>
<p>That had only transpired once, though. The blood kirin had
consumed Han Sen’s old blood as he leveled up, but he had no plans
to feed the beast with his blood again.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra had become Duke, and Han Sen continued to
fuse his blood with the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. His connection
with the Drum progressed by leaps and bounds. Now, he was able to
use the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum without Bao’er’s help. That made
things quite a bit easier.</p>
<p>That day, after the blood kirin absorbed more of the blood bone
air, it roared at Han Sen. Then, it turned around and returned to
the lotus mountain. When it saw that Han Sen wasn’t following, the
beast turned around and roared at him again.</p>
<p>Han Sen realized the blood kirin was inviting him to the lotus
mountain. Han Sen followed after the creature without hesitation.
If he was being invited to enter the blood kirin’s lair, it might
signify that the blood kirin was growing more comfortable with
him.</p>
<p>He followed the blood kirin to the lotus mountaintop. Most of
the blood rain had drained off of the peak, but some of the runoff
had collected into a small pond. Vines lay in tangles around the
pond, and Han Sen spotted blood pears hanging off of them.</p>
<p>The blood kirin jumped into the blood pond and made a grunting
noise at Han Sen, inviting him to enter.</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated this time, but he still followed the blood
kirin in. Based on his experience with his other pets, he had
learned that showering with a pet was a great way to strengthen his
bond with them.</p>
<p>Han Sen was planning to begin scrubbing the blood kirin’s
scales, but the blood kirin did something instead. It put its head
in the water and dived in deep.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared after the creature in surprise. It was obvious
now that the blood kirin hadn’t just invited him in for a simple
shower. He quickly used his Dongxuan Aura to follow the blood
kirin.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen trailing along behind, the blood kirin dived
in deeper.</p>
<p>The blood pond was only a thousand meters deep.</p>
<p>They both reached the bottom fairly quickly, where the blood
kirin disappeared into a tunnel that had been dug through the white
bones.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to follow the creature. He was curious, not
knowing exactly what the blood kirin wanted.</p>
<p>The blood kirin led the way. It followed the white bone tunnel
and soon splashed out of the blood water.</p>
<p>As his head broke the surface of the blood water, Han Sen
noticed that they had emerged into a giant white bone cave. Before
him lay the corpse of a giant, black xenogeneic.</p>
<p>The black kirin was as big as a mountain. However, its head had
been sundered, and its belly had been split open. It had been dead
for many years, and while the body might not have rotted, the air
had dried it into a husk.</p>
<p>“This must be the blood kirin’s mother. It doesn’t look very
much like the blood kirin, though. Perhaps the blood bone air it
has absorbed has simply changed its genes dramatically,” Han Sen
thought to himself.</p>
<p>The blood kirin leaped onto the mountain-sized body of the black
kirin. It then grunted at Han Sen, as if it was asking him to join
it.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew in the air, but he didn’t dare set his feet upon
the back of the black kirin. Although the blood kirin had called
him up, stepping on its mother’s corpse didn’t seem like an
appropriate thing to do.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw the corpse from above, he noticed something
glinting in the black flesh. There was a weapon embedded in the
black kirin’s back.</p>
<p>He couldn’t get a good look at the weapon, as only the handle
was protruding from the body. The rest of it was lodged deep within
the corpse of the black kirin.</p>
<p>Fox Queen had said that the blood kirin belonged to a no-name
race, but seeing that black kirin, Han Sen didn’t think that was
true.</p>
<p>The other creatures had all turned into bones. Some of the bones
had decayed into little more than dust, but that black kirin’s body
was still mostly complete. This point alone made it seem like
something special.</p>
<p>And the curious xenogeneic still had a weapon lodged inside it.
It certainly added to the dead creature’s mystique.</p>
<p>Han Sen carefully examined what he could see of the weapon. The
handle was only two feet long, which was definitely too small for a
greatsword. But for a smaller sword, the handle would probably have
been too long.</p>
<p>The handle gleamed silver, and there was a weird symbol engraved
across it. Han Sen was unsure what the symbol meant, but he
hypothesized that it could be a meaningless adornment.</p>
<p>All he knew for certain was that the weapon hadn’t belonged to
General Ghost Bone. The weapon lacked the aura and presence that
General Ghost Bone carried with him.</p>
<p>The blood kirin made some barking noises at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned, unsure what the blood kirin wanted.</p>
<p>The blood kirin, seeing Han Sen’s lack of understanding, tried
to grasp the weapon with its claws. But when it touched the silver
handle, silver lightning arced around the handle and into the blood
kirin. With a blinding flash, the blood kirin’s body was
electrified and blasted down onto the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen was frozen. The blood kirin was a force to be reckoned
with. It was a powerful half-deified xenogeneic, the son of White
Bone Big Hell. If it had been tossed back so simply, then the power
of the weapon must have been unimaginable.</p>
<p>The blood kirin picked itself up off the ground. It didn’t look
particularly injured, but its legs moved a little shakily from the
shock it had just received.</p>
<p>The blood kirin leaped back atop the black kirin. Then it made
that barking noise as Han Sen again.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen knew what it was suggesting. “You want me to help
you remove that weapon?”</p>
<p>The blood kirin nodded. It then made more encouraging noises to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have a good feeling about this. Despite its
power, the blood kirin had just been sorely electrified by the
lodged armament. Han Sen was just a Duke, so there was a chance
that the electricity might kill him.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and approached the weapon embedded in
the black kirin’s back. He wasn’t confident in his ability to pull
the weapon out, but if he didn’t at least try, then all the time he
had spent building a relationship with the blood kirin would go to
waste.</p>
<p>“Even if it doesn’t work, I have to give it a shot. Getting
shocked is better than making the blood kirin mad,” Han Sen thought
to himself. He summoned his King class Galaxy Lobster armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t want to be killed by lightning that not even the
blood kirin could withstand.</p>
<p>Landing on the black kirin’s back, Han Sen gazed at the silver
handle. Then, he looked back at the blood kirin. The blood kirin
looked very excited. Han Sen took a deep breath and slowly reached
for the silver handle.</p>
