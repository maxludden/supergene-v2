<h3>Chapter 2578</h3>

<p>If it wasn’t for the small Crocodile God’s body having a high
mass that made it tougher than the average deified xenogeneic, it
would have been ripped to shreds by the Six Core God Snake.</p>
<p>It was a shame the small Crocodile God was so young. Its body
wasn’t strong enough to completely repel the damage done to it by
the Six Core God Snake’s space powers. More and more wounds
appeared on its body as time went by. The small Crocodile God was
so scared that it looked like the creature was about to wet
itself.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake kept using its space substance chains to
lash the small Crocodile God’s body. It eventually got tired of
doing this, and so it just opened its mouth. Its scary fangs came
bearing down on the small Crocodile God.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God’s small eyes widened in terror. Tears
fell as it desperately tried to wiggle its way out of the snake’s
grasp. But under the restrictions imposed by the substance chains,
the little creature had no hope of running. The Six Core God
Snake’s fangs were going to slice into him.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cold metal light appeared, slamming into one of the
Six Core God Snake’s green cogwheels. The Six Core Snake God
screamed in agony.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God saw a giant metal pillar thrust its way
through the eye-like cogwheel. Han Sen was behind that metal
pillar, and he punched the back of the metal pillar continuously to
drive it in deeper.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God was as happy as it was shocked. The Six
Core God Snake shuddered with every blow. It was in pain. The space
substance chains that had bound the small Crocodile God loosened.
The small Crocodile God’s black light shone, and it managed to
escape from the grip of the substance chains.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to pummel the back end of the Sky God Pillar.
He had stolen that deified treasure from the Extreme King. He
couldn’t use all his power, but his attacks so far seemed to be
effective. He shoved the pillar into the cogwheel until the
cogwheel cracked. With the Sky God Pillar lodged inside, the
cogwheel could no longer spin.</p>
<p>It was a shame that Han Sen wasn’t deified. Otherwise, with his
deified power combined with the Sky God Pillar, his blows could
simply shatter the Six Core God Snake’s cogwheels.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake lowered its head and caught sight of Han
Sen. It roared with rage. Its body unleashed several substance
chains that looked like snakes. They flew straight for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Each space substance chain seemed to tear the fabric of space as
it came. It was like a space cutting skill. If Han Sen’s body was
unable to withstand one of those space cuts, he would be ripped
apart by the power of the chains.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t plan on trying to avoid the lashing, though. His
body shone with gold light, and a collection of gold, robotic
plates of armor formed around him. He turned into the Gold Robot
General.</p>
<p>The space substance chains came against the gold robot armor,
slicing into the surface of the metal armor. It was like many
invisible knives were trying to drive through the armor. Sparks
erupted across the surface of the gold armor like fireworks.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen’s gold armor was so hard, the space substance
chains were unable to completely cut through it.</p>
<p>Han Sen shoved the gold general’s speed to the max, and
streamers of golden energy spewed out of the armor’s metal pipes.
It was like a pair of golden wings were spreading from the armor on
Han Sen’s back.</p>
<p>The gold general drew back an arm as far as it would go, then
threw a punch forward like a volcano erupting. The punch landed on
the back of the Sky God Pillar.</p>
<p>The Sky God Pillar was driven forward by the impact of the
golden general’s fist. A loud cracking sound came from the Six Core
God Snake’s cogwheel. The cogwheel was completely shattered by the
Sky God Pillar, and the pillar pierced through the Six Core God
Snake’s neck.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake shrieked in pain and swung its tail
against Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the tail coming, but he couldn’t avoid it. The tail
seemed to cast shadows all through space. He couldn’t see it
clearly, and it crashed against his gold general armor.</p>
<p>The gold general was hit, and Han Sen was sent flying away like
a star. He slammed into a giant planet, and the power of his fall
poisoned the planet with radiation. A shockwave covered half the
planet.</p>
<p>Mountains fell and the ground was lifted. The rocks rolled like
waves. Half of the planet suddenly looked like the end of the
world.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake didn’t stop there. It hurtled forward,
straight for the planet where its enemy had landed. Countless space
substance chains coiled around the snake as it headed for the gold
general who was down on the planet.</p>
<p>“Small Crocodile God… what are you waiting for? Gravity area!”
Han Sen shouted.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God was still frozen, but hearing Han Sen’s
voice shook him out of his shock. He cast his gravity substance
chains, generating a black shield that covered the Six Core God
Snake. Under the influence of that power, the snake accelerated
like an asteroid as it fell to the planet’s surface.</p>
<p>Still in the gold armor, Han Sen stood up. He stomped on the
ground and used his gold energy. The gold energy started to run out
of the pipes in a stream, then a river. It was like a thruster pack
that lifted the gold general into the sky. It was headed for the
falling Six Core God Snake.</p>
<p>Han Sen guided the gold general, using it to gather up power
inside his fist. A powerful gold godlight manifested across it. Han
Sen’s fist flashed forward, battering the Sky God Pillar that was
still attached to the Six Core God Snake’s neck.</p>
<p>The Sky God Pillar punched straight through the body of the Six
Core God Snake. Even the gold general itself ended up ripping
through the snake’s body.</p>
<p>The gold general slowed to a stop. Still holding onto the giant
Sky God Pillar, Han Sen turned and looked back at the Six Core God
Snake. The force of gravity was still making it fall toward the
planet.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake hit the planet with a force that was
scarier than Han Sen’s descent. This was definitely not that
planet’s lucky day. It had taken two scary hits in a row, and now,
it looked completely destroyed.</p>
<p>“Nice job, small Crocodile God. Keep applying gravity to that
fiend!” Han Sen shouted as he piloted the gold general down to
press the Sky God Pillar against the Six Core God Snake.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake was severely limited by the incredible
force weighing down on it. The creature’s movements were incredibly
slow, and it was completely unable to dodge the gold general’s
attacks.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake shrieked strangely. Countless space
substance chains opened like a chrysanthemum, then came for Han
Sen. They stretched forward to hold him off, trying to keep him
from directly approaching the Six Core God Snake.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face didn’t change, and he didn’t dodge, He pushed the
power of the gold general to the max as he headed for the Six Core
God Snake.</p>
<p>As countless space substance chains tangled around the gold
general, Han Sen shouted. He used the gold general to toss the Sky
God Pillar in front of himself, and then, there was a burst of gold
energy. A punch that was prettier than the sun came forth to strike
the back of the Sky God Pillar.</p>
<p>The Sky God Pillar became a pillar of light. Every part of the
pillar shone as it tore through the planet’s atmosphere and slammed
into another cogwheel. The Six Core God Snake had been unable to
run.</p>
<p>The Six Core God Snake was restrained by the small Crocodile
God’s gravity substance chains, and so it couldn’t even jerk to the
side to avoid the strike. Another cogwheel core snapped in half
under the force of the blow. The pillar pinned the beast to the
planet as it screamed in pain.</p>
<p>The space substance chains broke, shattering into a million
pieces as the snake thrashed. Han Sen used the gold general to jump
past the falling remnants of the substance chains. He was headed
for the Six Core God Snake that was pinned to the planet.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God roared happily.</p>
