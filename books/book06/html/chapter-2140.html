<h3>Chapter 2140</h3>

<p>Han Sen finished absorbing the Jade Spirits, and the White Jade
Jing closed. So, Han Sen quickly abandoned the White Jade Building
and went to Dream Island to pick up Bao’er. Before Han Sen went to
Holy Heaven, he sent Bao’er to Dream Island. Under the ardent
protection of the Dream Beast, no one would even think about
bothering her.</p>
<p>“Dad!” Upon seeing Han Sen, Bao’er leaped into his arms.</p>
<p>After thanking Dream Beast for keeping her safe, Han Sen took
Bao’er to Jade Island.</p>
<p>“Yisha used to say Sky Palace would help me reach Marquise. But
it is so difficult to get The Story of Genes to Marquise tier.
After I do become Marquise, how am I supposed to find the necessary
resources to reach Duke, and then King?” The Story of Genes was
really starting to give Han Sen a headache these days. It took far
too much work and resources to keep upgrading The Story of Genes,
and on top of that, he had yet to see what power it actually
provided.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the midst of plotting out his future course when
he heard someone shouting his name from just beyond the borders of
his little island. The Yun sisters and Thousand Feather Crane had
come to see him.</p>
<p>Han Sen welcomed them over to a table that was sitting next to
an old tree. There, he told them all to sit down.</p>
<p>“I was going to visit you guys, as a matter of fact. But look!
You guys came to see me, instead,” Han Sen said, as he started to
serve each of them some tea.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi smiled and said, “We didn’t come here of our own
volition. We are here delivering word from my father. You do not
have much time left.”</p>
<p>“Not much time left with what?” Han Sen was surprised to hear
this.</p>
<p>“It is time that you have to teach in the training ground,” Yun
Sushang smiled.</p>
<p>“I see! I would have forgotten if you did not come to tell me. I
will go first thing in the morning.” Han Sen now remembered that he
had intended to teach a while ago, but events beyond his control
had taken him away from Sky Palace. He had put this off for an
entire year, and he still owed the ten days of teaching.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, what are you going to teach?” Thousand Feather
Crane asked.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about Suppress Evil,” Han Sen said. If he was
able to teach Suppress Evil, that would probably be the best
option.</p>
<p>You are going to talk about Suppress Evil?” Thousand Feather
Crane and the others were shocked to hear this.</p>
<p>“Is that a bad idea? Am I not allowed to talk about it or
something?” Han Sen asked, with a visible look of confusion.</p>
<p>“Of course you are allowed to talk about it, but…” Thousand
Feather Crane did not continue. It seemed as if he wanted to avoid
saying something hurtful.</p>
<p>Instead, Yun Suyi continued on his behalf, saying, “But Suppress
Evil is very difficult to teach. And there is already a teacher
that speaks about Suppress Evil. On top of that, he is very good
with it, as well.”</p>
<p>“Is he a King class elite?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“No. He is a Duke from Rui Beast. His talent lies in Suppress
Evil powers, so his Suppress Evil is—quite naturally— greater than
that of others. There aren’t many people that are as good as him
when it comes to that skill. As a result, the elders generally
allow him to lead discussions on Suppress Evil,” Thousand Feather
Crane said.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will talk about something else.” Han Sen was
troubled now. He did not have an alternative he could think of
teaching.</p>
<p>Han Sen had many geno arts, but they were all secret. He
shouldn’t really be teaching those to others, and without them, he
hadn’t a clue of what he should lecture on.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, we will attend your lessons tomorrow.” Before
Thousand Feather Crane and the others left, they made plans to meet
up with Han Sen at the training grounds the next day.</p>
<p>Han Sen still didn’t know what he should teach, though. He was
planning to ask the Sky Palace people what they wished to hear
about.</p>
<p>When the students of Sky Palace heard that Han Sen was finally
going to fulfill his teaching requirement, many people who weren’t
planning on going changed their minds. Even the Feathers such as
Angia came to listen. They wanted to see what Han Sen could teach
them.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought Bao’er onto the stage alongside him. He saw many
students down in front. There was quite the audience, and there
weren’t enough seats to house them all. Many people were relegated
to standing.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were referred to as the knife and sword
masters, and the residents of Sky Palace were very interested in
Han Sen’s geno arts. It wasn’t just the lower level sorts that had
come to listen to Han Sen that day either, as many Marquises
attended as well.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the Yun sisters had managed to claim
some front row seats for themselves. Han Sen nodded at them, as if
he was saying hello. Since he was a teacher on stage, and it was a
little inappropriate for him to greet others in such a fashion.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, what are you teaching?” Yu Jing shouted
boisterously from the front row.</p>
<p>“What would you like to hear about? If there is anything in
particular, I will consider your requests,” Han Sen asked. He hoped
someone in the audience would have a good idea.</p>
<p>“Swordskills! We want to hear about swordskills!”</p>
<p>“Why swordskills? Knifeskills for sure! Brother Han has been
taught by two legends.” “Why don’t you teach us both, since you are
called the knife and sword master.”</p>
<p>Many of the students started to fight amongst themselves. There
were too many differing opinions, which wasn’t helping Han Sen make
a decision at all.</p>
<p>“I have a suggestion. If it is possible, do you think you could
teach us Suppress Evil?” Yu Jing’s voice was so loud, his call
managed to drown out all the others.</p>
<p>“What is the point of listening to that? We have heard about it
too many times, and it is simply way too hard to practice.” Many
more students fought to have their say once again.</p>
<p>Many students wished to practice Suppress Evil, but the
technique really was notoriously difficult to become proficient
with. It was a geno art that took a very long time to learn.
Studying it was almost too difficult.</p>
<p>“Suppress Evil is a nice suggestion.” As everyone was in the
middle of arguing with each other, a cold voice resonated through
the air.</p>
<p>It wasn’t loud, but everyone heard it. And to top it off, it was
familiar.</p>
<p>Everyone looked toward the voice, and the speaker was revealed
to be none other than Lone Bamboo. He was standing at the edge of
the hall.</p>
<p>Yu Jing had looked rather embarrassed when everyone shouted down
his suggestion, but now he was very excited and he said, “Look!
Even Brother Lone Bamboo wants to hear about Suppress Evil. I would
like to let Brother Han teach us about Suppress Evil, too.”</p>
<p>Yep. Suppress Evil sounds good.”</p>
<p>“I have heard many lectures concerning Suppress Evil. If it is
coming from Brother Han, however, it must be unique. Let us all now
listen to Suppress Evil.”</p>
<p>“Even Brother Lone Bamboo wishes to hear about Han Sen’s
Suppress Evil. It must be very different. Let’s do it!”</p>
<p>The students that were all arguing now suddenly agreed with each
other. They wished to hear about Han Sen’s Suppress Evil.</p>
<p>After the nightmares, Lone Bamboo never came to the training
grounds to listen to the lectures. Now that Lone Bamboo was there
to listen to Han Sen’s Suppress Evil, everyone thought that Han
Sen’s Suppress Evil had to be something special. They really wanted
to hear about it now.</p>
<p>Seeing everyone clamoring to hear about Suppress Evil, Han Sen
found himself quietly saying, “Okay, I will teach</p>
<p>Suppress Evil. But my proficiency with it is nothing special.
Just listen and do not take it too seriously. What I’m about to say
is just some advice.”</p>
