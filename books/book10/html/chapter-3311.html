<h3>Chapter 3311</h3>

<p>Han Sen clutched his Inch Grey Sword and swung it at the jade
sword. He broke the jade sword. He did not stop. He started to
attack the black jade statue.</p>
<p>The black jade statue’s eyes had an evil light flicker. The jade
sword on its waist came out from the scabbard. One sword sound
shocked the sky and the ground. It was like a jade pillar-like
sword light was breaking the sky. It went toward Han Sen’s Inch
Grey Sword.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Under the sheer, unrelenting force of Han Sen’s sword, the jade
sword and black jade statue were sliced in half. It suddenly made
many Break World creatures fall back. The whole of the five cities
and 12 buildings froze.</p>
<p>When Han Sen grabbed the black jade crystal, an announcement
played in his head. “Hunted Break World beast: Black king. Got
black king beast soul. Found Break World gene.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mind did not turn to focus on the Break World gene. He
used all of the power in his sword to kill the black king. He used
Dongxuan Aura and felt more strong presences were emerging from
White Jade Jing like the black king. And worse than that, many of
them were far more frightening. Han Sen did not dare underestimate
any potential foes.</p>
<p>Han Sen was avoiding them, and the scary Break World creatures
of the White Jade Jing were avoiding him too. After Han Sen managed
to kill the black king in a single strike, the Break World beasts
outside feared him. No more Break World beasts dared to emerge from
White Jade Jing.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power alone stopped White Jade Jing and its scary
creatures. It enabled the Sky Palace students to retreat in
safety.</p>
<p>A Sky Palace elder was soaked in blood. He had a broken arm.
Before he left, he put his arm against his chest and performed the
gesture of a bow to Han Sen.</p>
<p>No one said a word. Many of the Sky Palace elites merely walked
away quietly. They were not afraid to die while fighting, but the
Sky Palace students could not die there. They had to protect the
students and ensure they were able to leave safely and live.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not dare leave. He stood in front of the 12
buildings of the five cities. Countless numbers of scary creatures
were being produced, but they would not step out of White Jade
Jing.</p>
<p>Still, Break World beasts were all around. The Break World
beasts from White Jade Jing had brought Sky Palace a lot of
trouble.</p>
<p>“Ancient Devil is right. With my power alone, no matter how many
Break World beasts I kill, I cannot protect all my family and
friends. I cannot save the world.” Han Sen could not think of a
better way to deal with all this. If he left, the scary monsters of
White Jade Jing would keep coming. More and more people would be
killed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly saw a sky full of holy light explode. A giant
gourd vine broke space. The holy gourds on it were glowing. They
killed the Break World beasts around.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched Sky Palace Leader stand atop the vine. It looked
as if he had managed to tame it. Perhaps the holy vine had restored
its original will, so it was no longer affected by the life soul
now.</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy. The holy vine was indeed special. It was
nothing compared to the Break World beasts. It had the protection
of the Sky Palace Leader. The Sky Palace students would live on
this day.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I am taking them to go back. Can you hold the line?”
Sky Palace Leader’s voice sounded. He was able to tell Han Sen was
not doing so well.</p>
<p>“I am here,” Han Sen coldly said. “You have my sword. None of
them will make it through. You guys just keep going.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! Well said. Let’s go.” Sky Palace Leader stroked the
holy vine. The countless gourds on the holy vine glowed with holy
light. It protected Sky Palace’s ships and battleships as they flew
out and departed the realm.</p>
<p>White Jade Jing’s many beasts roared to the sky. They were all
jumping, wanting to get out of there.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding his sword. He was standing firm outside
White Jade Jing all alone. No Break World beasts were bold enough
to take a step forward. They just kept roaring where they were.</p>
<p>A woman with white clothes stained with blood was next to Sky
Palace Leader. She looked at Han Sen, who looked strange next to
White Jade Jing, and said, “I can’t believe there would come a day
the Sky only survived because of his actions.”</p>
<p>“That is what is so amazing about life,” Sky Palace Leader said.
“You never expect what happens next.”</p>
<p>“From what I usually see, that is not something explicitly
nice.” The woman looked at the many dead Sky Palace students. After
the fight, Sky Palace was pretty much destroyed. Even so, its
people had mostly survived.</p>
<p>“The world has changed. We will have to change with it. If we do
not want to die in silence, then we must explode. The Sky never shy
away from the concept of a challenge. I am sure the Sky Palace
students will emerge stronger from enduring future hardships. They
will be able to rule the world again.” Sky Palace Leader changed
his tone. “But right now, we need to focus on staying alive.”</p>
<p>The large and small ships were protected by the holy vine as
they started to fly. All of the Sky quietly looked toward White
Jade Jing.</p>
<p>There were the mysterious 12 buildings and five cities. There
were many Break World beasts there, and a man was standing in front
of White Jade Jing. There was also the man’s sword.</p>
<p>“Sister, he is back.” Yun Suyi was tugging Yun Sushang’s
sleeves. When they peered at Han Sen’s back, the two blushed.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang sighed. It was great Han Sen had managed to save Sky
Palace, but that meant Yun Suyi would not soon forget Han Sen.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane clenched his fists and said, “We must
work harder. One day, we can reclaim Sky Palace and White Jade Jing
through the strength of our own power.”</p>
<p>“Yes. One day, we will take back Sky Palace,” the Sky students
all solemnly vowed. Even so, they all felt sad.</p>
<p>That was the day they all lost their homes.</p>
<p>Things like this were happening everywhere in the universe. Only
one place remained quiet like dead water.</p>
<p>In a dark red planet, Blood Legion and its many members and
Human King were peering at the black hole in the sky.</p>
<p>“The main and reverse worlds have developed a crack. It appears
Qin Xiu is making his move. This is a stellar chance for us.” Human
King flickered with a weird light.</p>
<p>“Mister Leader, do we do it now?” a member asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, we do it now. The bridging tunnel has been opened.
This is the age of chaos. Our best chance of doing it is now.”
Human King stood up. He led the Blood Legion members to the black
hole.</p>
<p>In the realm of the Demon, one person was in the black hole. It
was the Demon known as Demon Alpha. The black hole Demon Alpha was
in had already been there before the other black holes had
appeared.</p>
<p>The Demon Alpha did not have a reaction when the black hole
showed up. Her face did not have a single emotion. She silently
looked at the life soul coming out from the black hole.</p>
<p>One life soul came to the planet of the Demons. Demon Alpha
waved her hand as if to carry fate. She killed the life soul.</p>
<p>“Seeing the spirits before me, is it one of the Asura?” Demon
Alpha coldly looked at the life soul that was gone. She looked
disdainful.</p>
