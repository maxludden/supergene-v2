    <p>
      Han Sen looked at all the beast souls he owned and finally had his eyes on
      the blood snail beast soul. It was a super pet armor, but it was no longer
      that effective in front of a sacred-blood creature in Second God’s
      Sanctuary. Han Sen decided to try the black crystal on it as an
      experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The super beast souls were all surrounding the black crystal, while the
      archangel had lost her interest in it. Han Sen could not tell whether it
      was because the black crystal was no longer useful to her, or that she had
      not transformed yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Han Sen’s command, the blood snail quickly moved to the black crystal
      with joy, swallowing it entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similar to the angel, light started to form a cocoon that wrapped the
      blood snail up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was in no hurry. It was obvious that feeding a beast soul was much
      faster than feeding a creature. In the case of the angel, it did not take
      long. For the blood snail, it should take probably a month.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had significant expectation. If what he thought was real, that
      would be fantastic.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the ice cave, the berserk ice-armored beast that Yang Manli took back
      made quite a splash among the old-timers.
    </p>

    <p>
      An evolver who had just entered Second God’s Sanctuary was able to kill a
      berserk ice-armored beast, which was simply unbelievable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people were saying how impressive the young people nowadays were,
      while others thought it was just good luck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli did not explain anything. Even if she said that Han Sen killed
      the berserk beast with one punch, these people would not believe it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Actually, no one would believe a fresh evolver could kill a berserk
      ice-armored beast with just one punch. Even a sacred evolver could not
      achieve that.
    </p>

    <p>
      As people were still talking about Han Sen and the berserk ice-armored
      beast, they heard loud noises that sounded like an earthquake.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did the creatures find this place and come here to attack
      us?&#8221; Many people were shocked, going close to the teleport device,
      ready to leave God’s Sanctuary in case of any danger.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, the rumbles stopped. They heard a voice shouting,
      &#8220;Manli, give me a hand.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli clearly could tell that it was Han Sen’s voice. She quickly
      walked outside the ice cave. Others were also wondering what was
      happening, so some of them also followed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they came out of the ice cave, all of them stared their eyes wide.
      They could not believe what they were seeing and their jaws almost dropped
      to the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      A golden lion that looked like a small hill was carrying piles of bodies
      of ice-armored beasts and other mutant creatures such as giant snow wolf
      and ice bear.
    </p>

    <p>
      On top of the bodies stood a young figure. It was Han Sen who disregarded
      people’s advice and went hunting alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen… Brother… These are all yours?&#8221; Xu You asked with his
      voice trembling. This was so hard to believe that he could not register
      the fact even though he had rubbed his eyes hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone else had almost the same reaction. Many of them had been here for
      more than a decade, but none of them had witnessed so many gains. In
      addition, there were even bodies of mutant creatures.
    </p>

    <p>Many of them felt unreal like Xu You, feeling they were in a dream.</p>

    <p>
      Otherwise, how could there be so many bodies of creatures? And how could
      there be such a gigantic amount?
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli looked at Han Sen with a weird look, feeling complicated
      inside. She just said that Han Sen couldn’t take down the spirit shelter,
      but he returned with so many bodies of even mutant creatures in such a
      short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe he really conquered the spirit shelter? Yang Manli looked at Han Sen
      and did not know what to think.
    </p>

    <p>
      The young man who she used to despise had grown so fast that he had fully
      exceeded her expectation and even comprehension.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can say that.&#8221; Han Sen told them about how he encountered
      the sacred-blood snow spider, evil-blooded condor, monster of tentacles,
      and aristocrats spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, he was telling them the adapted version, in which he only
      witnessed a fight between the four and grabbed some gains when they were
      all seriously injured.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Look, this is the bird leg of that blackbird bitten off by another
      creature. Unfortunately, it still ran away, so I only have this
      leg.&#8221; Han Sen raised the bird leg that was the leftover of the
      archangel, as if he was showing off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone looked to Han Sen admiringly, saying that Han Sen was so lucky
      that he collected so many bodies of ice-armored beasts and mutant
      creatures and even a sacred-blood bird leg. Lady luck was really looking
      after him.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one suspected what Han Sen said. Some people had been here for decades,
      and many of them had seen the snow spider and the blackbird. Some people
      had even seen the aristocrats spirit. For someone who just came here to
      know these details, Han Sen must have seen them with his own eyes,
      otherwise how could he possibly know?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, such luck.&#8221; Xu You looked at the piles of bodies
      lustfully. &#8220;What do you plan to do with these? You can’t eat all of
      them make yourself. How about you sell some of them to us? And we can give
      you a good price.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As Xu You said it, everyone’s eyes were focused on Han Sen. These people
      had a lot more desire toward the meat of creatures than ordinary guys,
      especially for those mutant creatures. Many people had been so excited
      that their eyes turned red, wanting to take a bite right away.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, of course they’re for sale,&#8221; Han Sen said assertively.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I’ll give you a hundred thousand for an ice-armored beast.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;One hundred and fifty thousand…&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen just gave his answer, many people were starting to shout price
      already. The scene looked like a bunch of rich people who did not know how
      to spend their money, waving their checks at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am going to sell these creatures, but only to the insiders. If
      anyone else wanted to buy them, they have to double the price. Also, I
      only accept Saint Hall licenses and geno solutions beyond A-Class,&#8221;
      said Han Sen quietly. He did not bring all the meat back just to gain some
      money.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, would you mean?&#8221; Everyone was dazed, and Xu You
      asked eventually.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am going to set up a gang. Whoever in the gang could purchase
      meat with the insider price, and they can also use their points,&#8221;
      Han Sen said casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, he would definitely conquer the spirit shelter. It would
      take more than just himself to rule the spirit shelter, because he could
      not stay there all the time. He would rather recruit every master fighter
      at this place to follow him and guard the spirit shelter for him. This
      way, in the future, no matter how many people were teleported to this
      place, they had to follow his order.
