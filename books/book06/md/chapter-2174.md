Han Sen and company walked across Sodi for several hundred miles, and in that distance, he was unable to kill a single xenogeneic. There were too many Dukes and Marquises already taking advantage of the planet’s offerings. Han Sen saw many Dukes and Marquises fighting and killing xenogeneics before he could reach them. No one was leaving Han Sen a single xenogeneic to fight himself. And if Han Sen drew close to the others, they’d stare him down as if they were ready to start a fight if he took another step.

Han Sen walked forward, hoping to head deeper into the mountains. Han Sen was at the foot of the rise when Qing Li and a number of other Rebates approached. “Han Sen, are you here to kill xenogeneics? Well, I don’t think you’ll be able to.”

“I’m just taking a look around.” Han Sen coughed.

Qing Li lifted her lips. “We have been walking across these mountains for over half the day, and we haven’t been able to locate a single xenogeneic. Those b*stards down there are going to kill them all before we get a chance to.”

The few Rebates of Duke and Marquise class looked tired. Everyone was using the excuse of finding the traitor to exploit the Six Star xenogeneic space. And because of that, the Rebate were losing so much.

But they had to relent and allow this due to the pressure that the Destroyed were putting on them. If that powerful race hadn’t been leaning on them so heavily, the Rebate would have never let them in.

As the two were speaking, however, someone else approached. It was a group of the Destroyed. Most of them were Marquises, but the leader of the bunch was a Duke.

That team of Destroyed were out in pursuit of the traitor. But when they saw Han Sen, they immediately looked hostile.

That was because in Metal World, Han Sen had taken the effort to protect the other races. The Destroyed there, however, had been completely wiped out. And after those events, no other race was very fond of the Destroyed. Their reputation had taken a tumble, and they had paid a high price. That was why they were not fond of Han Sen.

But still, they did not actually try to attack him. They just looked at him with distaste. They were still in territory that belonged to the Rebate, after all, and they weren’t arrogant enough to fight him there.

Just as the Destroyed were about to leave, the face of the Duke leader changed. He shouted at the mountains, “Barr!”

Han Sen and the others looked in the direction that he had called. They saw a man with bone armor. He was carrying a bone knife that was around two meters long on his shoulder.

“That is one of the Destroyed?” Han Sen asked, looking at Barr with a quizzical expression.

Barr had three faces, but he did not have the traditional six arms. His three faces were different than those of the Destroyed, as well. The three faces were all masculine.

Qing Li’s face changed, and she quietly said, “Do not provoke him. He is, for lack of a better word, abnormal amongst the Destroyed.”

“What is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen quietly asked.

Qing Li quickly explained, “He is a mix between one of the Destroyed and someone of another race. He is very talented, but also very cruel. The Destroyed love violence, but even they call him by the name of Born Destroyer. See how scary he is?”

A Rebate Duke quickly told Han Sen, “Let’s go. We cannot provoke him. He is also a part-time hitman, and he’s killed geniuses that belong to all races. Many powerful people have died by his hand. To me, it sounds like you might be in danger.”

Han Sen frowned, but he did not move. He had noticed that Barr was already coming after him. Barr’s energy had already locked onto him, and he couldn’t run.

Han Meng’er felt Barr’s focus on Han Sen, as well. She stepped in front of Han Sen and summoned her Death Goddess bow. She pulled its string, and a black beam arrow manifested. The arrow tip was trained on Barr.

“Are you crazy? Put the bow down!” Seeing Han Meng’er lift a bow and aim it at Barr, Qing Li and the others started to freak out.

A person like Barr would merrily murder someone if they were only suffering a bad mood. Han Meng’er was now pointing her loaded bow at him, so they imagined it to be something of a death wish.

The group of Destroyed were coldly smiling at them. But even though they were of the same race as Barr, there was an element of fear in their faces. They didn’t want much contact with Barr, either. And now, one of Han Sen’s people was aiming a bow at him.

The few Destroyed started to backtrack a little, so they could comfortably watch the show that was about to unfold. It seemed as if a killing fest was about to begin.

Han Meng’er did not put the bow down. She coldly watched Barr approach, and as she did, her bow gathered up more power.

She was only a Marquise, and Barr was a Duke. But Barr was hostile to Han Sen, and so she wouldn’t back down.

“Han Sen, tell her to stand down!” a Rebate Duke next to Qing Li said.

“There is no need,” Han Sen said coldly.

The bow in Han Meng’er’s hand was fully-charged. Without a moment of hesitation, she fired at Barr.

The arrow had been created from a formless swirl of black smoke, and it became almost impossible to see as it flashed towards Barr. It flew near him, ready to perforate his heart.

Everyone was shocked. They thought Han Meng’er was incredibly brave to take the first shot at Barr.

The Rebate Dukes didn’t dare say a single word, though. They were afraid Barr would go crazy on them all. So, the Duke pulled on Qing Li and the others to leave. They wanted to get as far away from Han Meng’er and Han Sen as possible, so they could avoid getting involved in their dispute.

The Destroyed stepped back even more, as well. They were still smiling coldly. They looked at Han Meng’er as if she was a dead woman.

Barr was not only a cruel fellow. The others did not know much about him, but the Destroyed most certainly did.

He had been given the title of Born Destroyer by the leader of the Destroyed himself. He was the strongest out of all of the Destroyed.

If Barr had been a pure-blood Destroyed, his talent would have most certainly given him the opportunity to become the next leader of the whole Destroyed race.

Although Barr had not received much support from the Destroyed, he still did far better than most others of the Destroyed. Especially those of the same level as he was. And because he loved killing, his name was deeply associated with cruelty. He was also more famous than most Kings of the Destroyed because of all this, too.

Barr had once slain a Dragon Duke. Dragon One pursued him across a dozen systems in retaliation, but he managed to get away. While he was running away, he killed many Dragon Dukes and Marquises, too. That made the Dragon look really bad, and it gave Barr’s notoriety an enormous boost.

Dragon One was a King, but he failed to chase down a Duke. And Barr had killed many of the Dragon. That was why he became famous.

Barr saw Han Meng’er’s arrow come right for him, but the speed he used to approach had not changed. He did not use the bone knife slung behind his shoulder. Instead, he reached out his hand to grab the arrow.
