<h2>Dongxuan Breakthrough</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2134</h3>

<p>As his Sky eye grew stronger, Evil Eye put Han Sen under even
greater duress. While Han Sen was able to endure it for the moment,
he wouldn’t forever; it was only a matter of time before his hands
snapped. They had now been shredded down to the bone, after
all.</p>
<p>Evil Eye looked excited. The purple light of his four evil eyes
was shining, and his speed and power at greater and greater
outputs. He was dying to bring an end to the man that had the
audacity to fight him so successfully.</p>
<p>The audience could tell Dollar was not faring too well. His
power and speed were low. Even if his abilities could miraculously
catch up to Evil Eye’s, there was every chance that his body had
already taken too much damage.</p>
<p>“It is time for a winner to be declared.” One of the spectating
elites sighed and looked disheartened.</p>
<p>Dollar’s performance had not been any inferior to Evil Eye’s. He
was just an ordinary Marquise, while Evil Eye was an old monster
that—by all rights—should not have been allowed to compete with the
others. They shouldn’t have bracketed him in with the other
Marquises. It wasn’t fair.</p>
<p>Dollar should have been extremely proud that’d he’d fought as
well as he had.</p>
<p>The Nobles and the Kings thought it was a great shame, and many
people naturally sympathized with the underdog. In the match
between Dollar and Evil Eye, they were rooting for Dollar. He was
the weaker of the two, yet he fought with endearing courage. And
so, the hearts of many Kings and Dukes went out in support of
Dollar.</p>
<p>But now, the situation was obvious. Although Dollar was a
genius, his body was still far weaker than the monster he had been
pitted against: Evil Eye.</p>
<p>In this battle of bodies, he had lost.</p>
<p>As everyone sighed glumly, Evil Eye felt a sudden pang of worry.
There was something off about Han Sen.</p>
<p>That worry made him want to kill Han Sen even more. He wanted
Han Sen dead, so he could get this fear over with.</p>
<p>Han Sen was suppressed and his fists were bleeding. The bones of
his hands looked ready to give up.</p>
<p>But on the inside, Han Sen was feeling quite different. He was
actually rather excited. The Dongxuan Aura was undergoing its final
changes. The process of leveling up to Marquise would be complete
any second now.</p>
<p>“Weird.” In Sky Palace, the leader watched Han Sen fight with a
strange expression.</p>
<p>“What is weird?” asked the woman with a black mask.</p>
<p>“Dollar is going to breakthrough,” the Sky Palace leader
said.</p>
<p>“Breakthrough? I don’t think it’s possible to level up inside
the Geno Being Scroll. Even if he did become a Duke, he would still
be suppressed by the rules that bind him there. He would only
complete an ascension after having departed the Geno Being Scroll.
This has happened before, so why are you suddenly acting so
surprised?” The black-masked woman frowned.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader shook his head. “The strange thing is that
I don’t think he’s leveling up to become a Duke.”</p>
<p>The masked woman looked shocked. She said, “You mean Dollar has
two talents? He has two geno armaments? And you mean to suggest
that the other one is becoming a Marquise from the rank of
Earl?”</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader nodded and said, “It certainly looks that
way.”</p>
<p>The masked woman was dumbfounded. “Double talents? And one of
his skills can fight Evil Eye in this manner? Is he also a reborn
monster?”</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader did not say anything more. Silently, he
watched the fight continue.</p>
<p>Most Nobles hadn’t caught on to what was happening; only elites
like the Sky Palace leader had a grasp of the situation.</p>
<p>“Interesting. He has two talents.” Yisha sat on her throne,
drinking wine as she watched Dollar fight. She looked angry.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp Alpha frowned and spoke to himself. “Double
talents. And one of his skills is so strong already? Who is this
human? It cannot be a race that has just entered, can it?”</p>
<p>Everyone was focusing on this fight now. Most of the Nobles
thought the battle had already been settled, and only a few elites
could see the simmering change going on beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Evil Eye was starting to look ill. He could see what was
happening to Han Sen, but there was nothing he could do to stop
it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the middle of that crazy fight, Han Sen’s body beamed with
sudden power. The audience couldn’t see that power with their eyes,
but they could see the changes happening in Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen’s face filled with relief, as though he had
set aside some mountainous burden that he had been forced to
shoulder. His entire body glowed, as if he had been reborn.</p>
<p>Evil Eye’s attacks suddenly seemed weaker. It felt as if the
storm upon Han Sen had been reduced to a few waterdrops. He could
no longer stop Han Sen, who stood absolutely still.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s presence had been suppressed, but now it was unleashed
in full. It made Evil Eye squirm, and all of his instincts screamed
that he was in danger.</p>
<p>“What is this? Dollar had a breakthrough? I thought you weren’t
able to level up in the Geno Being Scroll?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be a new level. The Geno Being Scroll denies the
ability to level up.”</p>
<p>“No, he is definitely leveling up. Is Dollar cheating? How can
he level up in the Geno Being Scroll?”</p>
<p>“Damn! Does this guy have the Geno Being Scroll’s favor? Has he
been given the exclusive permission to level up here? Even if he
wins, he’ll win as a Duke. He won’t win the Marquise crown.”</p>
<p>“That’s cheating!”</p>
<p>The whole world was shocked by what they saw. They weren’t quite
sure what to think about this, as it all looked too fake. He had
leveled up inside the Geno Being Scroll.</p>
<p>“No, he’s not a Duke. It’s a double talent… He has a double
talent… And his other talent has become Marquise.”</p>
<p>“Shit… This can’t happen…”</p>
<p>“Fuck! Really? Dollar has two talents? And he’s only been using
one to fight Evil Eye all day?”</p>
<p>“Crazy! Crazy! This world is crazy!”</p>
<p>“Fuck! Another monster. And I was just feeling bad for him.”</p>
<p>The revelation that Dollar had two talents swept through the
audience like a tidal wave. His other talent was only just leveling
up now. Many of the Nobles weren’t quite sure what to say.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Aura suddenly grew small. The world looked weird
through Han Sen’s eyes. In the next second, he lifted his
finger.</p>
<p>Evil Eye roared and rushed forward. His purple flame was burning
like mad, and he was gathering as much power as he possibly could
to go against Han Sen. But as the two closed on each other, Han Sen
suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>In that moment when Han Sen went past Evil Eye, he appeared
behind him and without injury.</p>
<p>Evil Eye was standing with his back to Han Sen, and he didn’t
have enough time to turn. His eyes widened.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The white and purple armor shattered. In the space of a second,
it was all reduced to dust. And as Evil Eye’s helmet vanished, the
world saw his real face.</p>
