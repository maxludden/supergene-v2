<h2>A Rod</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1812</h3>

<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen walked right up to the crystal
sphere.</p>
<p>The bridge led to the very top of the crystal sphere, and when
Han Sen reached the end, he noticed there was an entrance at its
top. The orb’s interior was hollow. It was like a football
stadium.</p>
<p>He could see Hawk Wing and Yisha conducting battle in there.
What shocked Han Sen the most was that Hawk Wing— who always seem
so indecisive and reckless——was fighting Yisha and not showing
signs of losing.</p>
<p>“Even I didn’t see that coming. He’s a powerful guy.” Han Sen
was shocked that Hawk Wing’s powers were no less than Yisha’s.</p>
<p>His hands were like hooks, striking against Yisha’s hands that
wielded Teeth power. The Teeth powers were unable to break his
hands.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe the champion of Sky Bird entered Demon Grave
and pretended to be little more than a noob. I am surprised you
endured such self-humiliation for so long!” Yisha laughed
coldly.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing hummed and said, “Hum! I am one of the Twelve Skies in
Beast Area. What can you say about yourself? The Rebate Knife Queen
that pretends to be nobody.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that great to be one of the Twelve Skies. You’ll be
qualified if Twelve Skies come together.” Yisha sounded
disdainful.</p>
<p>“If we were outside Demon Grave right now, I would not be as
proficient as you. After all, you are half-deified. But this is
Demon Grave, so what matter is it what you are? Take that deified
title away, and you and I are practically the same.” Hawk Wing
hummed coldly.</p>
<p>“Really?” Yisha stared directly into Hawk Wing’s eyes as her
knife-wielding hands started to become furious.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked away from the pair for a bit, to get a better
look at the surroundings.</p>
<p>That place was like a circular stadium. There was a crystal
platform, and above it, there was a crystal hallway to get down to
the center.</p>
<p>The pipes there ran with white liquid. And a lot of the pipes
ran to the white juice at the center of the pool. He did not know
where the pool connected to, and even though vast amounts of the
white stuff were being pumped in, the level did not rise.</p>
<p>There was nothing else inside the sphere. Hawk Wing and Yisha
were fighting each other near the pool, prohibiting each other from
getting close to it.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing’s movements were strong. They weren’t too different
from Han Sen’s phoenix movements. He had wings, of course. That was
different from Han Sen, who had to use strength.</p>
<p>Overall, though, Hawk Wing’s focus was on speed. That was also
different from Han Sen, who had the abilities of prediction and
formation.</p>
<p>He was very fast, though. And with his hook-like claws, Yisha
could do very little.</p>
<p>If this was a real fight, Hawk Wing could not beat Yisha. But
Hawk Wing wasn’t looking to kill her outright. He just wanted to
open a window of opportunity that would allow him to reach the pool
without interference.</p>
<p>That worried Yisha a lot. Her movements were good, but her speed
was a little worse than Hawk Wing’s. If she missed, Hawk Wing could
fall into the pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen was peeping at the pair from the outside, not yet daring
to enter. They were two opponents that would be difficult to deal
with. He planned to wait outside, and maybe sneakily nab an easy
kill if one became available.</p>
<p>As Han Sen watched them, something moved in his pocket. Then,
that soft ball jumped out of it. It started to spin around on the
ground, before rolling into the crystal sphere by its own
volition.</p>
<p>The ball looked sticky, and it traced the walls down. It seemed
to be following the pipes towards the pool.</p>
<p>Yisha and Hawk Wing were intently focused on each other, so they
didn’t notice anything else enter. That aside, they wouldn’t dare
think a pingpong ball-like object would come rolling in like
that.</p>
<p>And with the pipes obscuring their view of it, the ball was able
to roll all the way down and enter the pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought something might happen if the ball entered the
pool, but everything was quiet after it entered. The pool was still
the same.</p>
<p>Yisha and Hawk Wing were fighting harder than ever. Because they
were slowly running out of stamina, their fighting abilities had
become weaker after the duration of their combat.</p>
<p>Now you could tell who was truly better. Yisha’s power was
weaker, but her skills had not wavered over time. She wasn’t making
any mistakes.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing’s skills weren’t as good as Yisha’s, but he was weaker
now than he had been earlier. Furthermore, his movements now were a
bit twisted. His missteps were too small to be considered real
mistakes, but they were there nonetheless. Yisha was taking
advantage of that.</p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>With those advantages, Yisha took the opportunity to take a hack
at his shoulder. Hawk Wing’s face changed, and he wished to fall
back. But it was too late.</p>
<p>His shoulder had a two-centimeter cut, and it only hurt the
skin.</p>
<p>But that was enough, and the wound continued to expand and bring
blood with it.</p>
<p>“The Teeth power is too cruel. When you fight someone with that
power, you really can’t afford to get hurt in the slightest.
Otherwise, you are dead.” Han Sen complimented her in his head, but
he was really happy he had managed to learn Teeth power.</p>
<p>“Knife Queen, d*mn you!” Hawk Wing flapped his wings and tried
to fly towards the exit, with the speed and straightness of an
arrow.</p>
<p>He was too fast, and Yisha could not stop him.</p>
<p>Demon Grave suppressed powers a lot When Hawk Wing was further
away, the effectiveness of the wound would be weaker.</p>
<p>Hawk Wing flew out of the exit with a disheartened feeling. It
would have been difficult to get the treasure regardless, but Knife
Queen had pretended to be a woman called Yisha. It was all his bad
luck.</p>
<p>As he thought of this, he felt a pain in his head. He felt as if
he had been struck by a rod. He saw stars as he fell to the
ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed his body and kept him from falling. He couldn’t
make any noise.</p>
<p>Yisha’s attention was now focused on the pool. When she walked
in front of it, she looked excited.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not hesitate, and he too now snuck into the sphere.
He was headed for Yisha, and as he came up behind her, he had his
scabbard ready to give her a whack.</p>
<p>Assaulting a half-deified elite on the outside would have been
impossible. But here, her senses were weaker. This would not be a
difficult attack to pull off.</p>
<p>The champion Hawk Wing had been knocked out by Han Sen, and that
had been quite easy.</p>
