“The relic was left behind by Bai Yi’s mother. Why didn’t she just give it to Bai Yi? She didn’t even tell Bai Yi about its location, but she gave it to an outsider like Lan Haixin. Was Bai Yi’s mother some patriot who valued the good of the Siren above all?” Han Sen thought something was wrong about this situation.

The old Siren woman looked at Han Sen, who had frozen on the spot. Ignoring what Lan Haixin had said, she barked in a rougher tone, “My Prince, neither your blood nor the holy virgin’s blood is pure. Even if you knew where the relic was, without the holy virgin’s blood, you wouldn’t be able to activate the relic. The last holy virgin kept the relic from you because of your stubbornness. She was worried you’d hurt yourself with it.”

Han Sen coldly grunted and said, “How was I supposed to know, if she didn’t want to give me the relic, anyway?

Lan Haixin was annoyed. “You harbor suspicions about your own mother? It would be shameful to have you as a son. I feel so sorry for her, putting all that effort into raising you.”

The old Siren woman said, “My Prince, you worry too much. If the last holy virgin didn’t want you to have the relic, why did she program the Crystal Palace to require your blood to open? She was worried that you would rush to claim the relic, come here alone, and get hurt by it. Now, you can claim the relic with the holy virgin Lan. By combining both of your blood together, you should be able to activate the relic. There will be no risk that way. This is what the last holy virgin wanted.”

“Using blood again? I’m not really Bai Yi. Can my blood open the Crystal Palace?” Han Sen felt depressed, and then he thought to himself, “Maybe the programming of the Crystal Palace focuses on the Original Water King Body. I will have to give it a try, at least. If that doesn’t work, then I can tell them that I haven’t fully overtaken Han Sen’s body, and that I still have some genes to bring into submission. I can tell them I will come back another time to try. I need to stall this for as long as possible.”

Once Han Sen had thought of a plan, he walked up to the Crystal Palace’s door. His right eye’s Purple-Eye Butterfly was spinning fast as he examined the crystal door ahead of him.

The crystal door was ten meters tall, and it looked very powerful. There was a blurry halo around it, and it was filled with the colors of the rainbow. It looked rather magical.

It was a double door, and each side held the depiction of a female Siren. This palace had obviously been left behind by the Siren, as the stylings were very distinctive.

Han Sen knew that he couldn’t just drop some blood on the door and expect it to open. There must have been some sort of system involved, and that was what Han Sen was looking for.

With the aid of his Purple-Eye Butterfly, Han Sen found a special place upon the door.

Both sides of the door featured the engraving of a Siren woman, and the two women’s arms were folded into each other. All four hands came together to clutch a crystal bottle. The crystal bottle was at the center of the door.

The style of the crystal bottle made Han Sen frown, because it reminded him of the Crystal God Conch’s sheets of glass.

The crystal bottle was like a carving. At the center of the bottle was a small hole. If he wasn’t paying close attention, he wouldn’t have noticed it.

But with his Purple-Eye Butterfly, Han Sen could see how the bottle had been made.

Han Sen walked right before the door. He raised his hand to the carving of the crystal bottle, and as he drew closer, he used the Original Water King Body to transform his hand into water.

His fingers brushed the hole, and some water separated from his fingers to drip into it. Then Han Sen pulled his hand back and took a step in retreat. He watched the Crystal Palace’s door.

From the reaction given by Lan Haixin and the others, Han Sen knew he had done it correctly. But he was still being careful. He considered what he might say if he was unable to open the Crystal Palace’s door.

Katcha-cha!

As Han Sen was rapidly preparing an explanation, the Crystal Palace’s door produced a sharp noise. It split in two and opened inwards.

Lan Haixin and the other Sirens grinned widely, ecstatic. Han Sen was secretly surprised. “I was able to open it?”

Han Sen had actually been hoping that his attempt to open it would fail. Success meant that his unsettled feelings were still going to hang around. The closer he was to the Crystal Palace, the more disturbed he felt.

The door opened, revealing everything inside the Crystal Palace. Beyond the big door was a golden hall that had also been made of crystal. At the end of the hall was an altar. A small crystal bottle stood on the altar’s platform. Something that looked like a rainbow swirled blurrily inside it. The sight was quite mysterious.

Lan Haixin and the others were dying to get into the hall.

Han Sen hesitated for a moment, but he ultimately decided to walk inside with them. With the little red bird there, he and Bao’er should be safe.

Lilly was scared, and she stayed by Han Sen’s side. Han Sen walked slowly, and he kept observing Lan Haixin and the others. They hadn’t encountered any danger yet.

The entire hall was very peaceful. Lan Haixin and the others stood in front of the altar. The old Siren woman stared at the little bottle on its platform when she suddenly said, “Yes, yes! This is our relic, the Siren Bottle… Our race can rise from the ashes once more!”

After that, her excitement broke into crying. Full of tears, she repeatedly bowed before the bottle.

All of the Siren started to bow, copying the old Siren woman. Even Lan Haixin lowered herself before the Siren Bottle.

Han Sen wasn’t in the mood to participate. He just sat atop the blood kirin and stared at the bottle.

The bottle was around the size of a man’s hand. The bottle was very tall, and two wings of glass flared out from its sides. The two wings of the bottle featured the faces of Siren women. The bottle was small, but the work was very delicate. The two Siren women looked almost alive, as if real people were smiling on it.

The bottle was lovely, with a halo around it and a rainbow glowing from inside. It looked holy, almost sacred. However, whenever Han Sen looked at the bottle, it felt sinister to him.

“Bai Yi, you and I can claim the holy bottle now,” Lan Haixin said to Han Sen, but she remained standing in front of the platform.

Han Sen frowned. The Siren bottle was good stuff, clearly. His Purple-Eye Butterfly could tell him that much. The Purple-Eye Butterfly couldn’t analyze the bottle, so it had to be some sort of deified treasure.

But the evil presence of the Siren Bottle made Han Sen feel afraid. He didn’t want to take the risk of claiming it.

Seeing that Han Sen was still standing back, Lan Haixin frowned and said, “Haven’t you always wanted this relic? Why are you backing out now?”

Han Sen smiled and said, “Of course I want this relic, but I’ve never seen it before. Are you sure this is the right one?”
