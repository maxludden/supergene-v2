    <p>
      After chatting with Professor Xu for a long while, Han Sen felt he was
      inspired. The materials he got from Professor Xu were also a great help to
      him. For the things that he couldn&#8217;t understand before, he had
      managed to perceive them after reading Professor Xu&#8217;s materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, when he read Dongxuan Sutra again, he had many new
      understandings. Although there were still places that he did not
      understand, he had a more profound grasp of the text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, there were too many technical terminologies about
      cultivation in Dongxuan Sutra. Because it was written a long time ago, Han
      Sen still felt difficult to understand and translate everything with what
      he had learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after reading the materials and asking Professor Xu some
      questions, Han Sen had some new gain and translated another technique.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason that Han Sen was able to do that was that he had read Yin Yang
      Sutra, which Yin Yang Blast was based on.
    </p>

    <p>
      This technique in Dongxuan Sutra was focused on the yin force, which had a
      lot of similarity with the Yin Yang Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, obviously the technique was better. If he could practice well, he
      could make his force to penetrate a large object. It was a bit
      exaggerating to say he could hit the bull behind the mountain, but it
      would not be difficult for him to penetrate through a steel plate of
      several feet thick.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was a big fan of the yin force, so he practiced according to the
      technique recorded in the Sutra. If he was able to reach that level, in
      the future, he could hit the inner organs of the creature when he met one
      and did not need to break their tough skin and bones.
    </p>

    <p>
      After several days, Han Sen felt he had already been able to use the yin
      force better. Originally, he could only penetrate 3 to 4 inches, but now
      he could penetrate 1 foot already.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This sutra is indeed a great book. It deserves to be called the
      very best secret technique of a strong man. If I could learn the true
      content, it should be even much better than Jadeskin.&#8221; Han Sen
      wanted to translate the entire text right away, but he cannot rush. If he
      practiced before he understood, there might be danger and risk. There is
      no geno solution designed for Dongxuan sutra, so he might hurt himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he had rested for more than ten days, eating golden crab every day in
      the shelter, he had eventually finished eating the crab and gained seven
      sacred geno points. Currently, Han Sen had twenty-eight sacred geno
      points.

    <p>
      Checking his progress, Han Sen felt the number was quite good for someone
      who had entered Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary for less than a year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, Han Sen&#8217;s fitness index had definitely passed a hundred
      and twenty. It took a test for him to find out the exact number. Anyway,
      he was much stronger than Tiger of Blueblood in the past now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen estimated that when he maxed out on all four types of geno points,
      he should be able to reach a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty.
      He wondered how strong the super creatures of Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary
      were and whether he would be able to hunt them by then.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was too early to think about that at this point. The most important
      thing for him was to fill up his sacred geno points. As for mutant geno
      points, Han Sen was not that worried, because there were a lot of mutant
      geno points in the ocean. If he had patience, it would be easy for him to
      fill up the mutant geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in order to kill a sacred-blood creature in the ocean, it would
      take a lot of work. Human&#8217;s ability to fight would be reduced
      greatly in the water and they cannot breathe in the water. To fight a sea
      creature on the same level as him, even Han Sen was scared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once he had an accident in deep ocean, there was no way for him to run.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will go kill the berserk gargoyle first.&#8221; Han Sen entered
      God&#8217;s sanctuary again, making up his mind to go to the nest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sacred-blood beast souls were still very attractive in Han Sen&#8217;s
      eyes. In addition, the beast souls from the eggs were normally very good
      and of rare types.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, before Han Sen even left the Goddess Shelter, Zhu Ting found him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Captain, I heard you have several berserk mutant beast souls in the
      ones you brought back?&#8221; Zhu Ting grinned and asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There are two. What? You want them?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Zhu
      Ting, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, yes. Name your price.&#8221; Zhu Ting nodded quickly. A
      berserk mutant beast soul could even have similar abilities to
      sacred-blood beast souls. Of course Zhu Ting wanted something like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      In such damned place, if he had a berserk mutant beast soul, he could have
      a much better life because it would be easy for him to kill anything but
      sacred-blood creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Easy, you have Seven Twists to trade,&#8221; Han Sen smiled and
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting suddenly had a long face and said, &#8220;brother, you
      don&#8217;t understand. I do not dare to give you Seven Twists, otherwise
      the Chen&#8217;s will never forgive me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then I have no way to help you. Just purchase them from Yang
      Manli,&#8221; Han Sen said, looking helpless.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, her price is incredibly high. Except for those who are rich, no
      one has that kind of money.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting was depressed. If he had that kind of money, he wouldn&#8217;t go
      to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, Han Sen told Yang Manli that there was no rush to sell the
      berserk mutant beast souls, which was why Yang Manli&#8217;s price was
      high. He was just trying to show off the power of Goddess Gang and did not
      plan to sell for real.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, if someone were really willing to pay a high price, Yang Manli
      would not turn it down.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I could not help you with that.&#8221; Han Sen patted Zhu Ting on
      his shoulder and left the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting looked at Han Sen, puzzled. He did not understand how Han Sen was
      able to get so many nice stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen spent much less time than him in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
      However, in less than one year, at such a bad Place, Han Sen had even sold
      berserk mutant beast souls, which was astonishing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting gritted his teeth and decided to purchase the berserk violent ape
      at first. He only had enough money to buy this one because of the high
      price Yang Manli gave.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, when Zhu Ting found Yang Manli, Yang Manli told him that not only
      berserk mutant beast souls, even mutant beast souls were sold out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dammit. So many rich people.&#8221; Zhu Ting regretted that he did
      not buy violent ape when he could, and now he did not even have the
      chance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It seems that I must have a conversation with Han Sen. He must have
      better beast souls. Maybe that item could make him give me some better
      beast souls,&#8221; Zhu Ting muttered to himself.
