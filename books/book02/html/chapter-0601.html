    <p>
      Han Sen ascended the cliff wall a dozen meters or so, and in a few more
      steps, he would reach the lizard-creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had secretly activated his gene lock, and with it, he could sense
      the creature&#8217;s desire to turn around. When it did, he also had the
      foresight to know the creature would extend its tongue. In the next
      second, the lizard shot out its long, red, spiky tongue towards him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being able to tell what was coming felt amazing. Han Sen felt as if he
      could predict everything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen leapt away from the cliffside. Borrowing strength from the air, he
      dodged the giant, toxic-looking tongue and returned to the cliffside near
      the creature. Unsheathing his silver sword, he quickly chopped its head
      off.
    </p>

    <p>
      This result even surpassed his own expectation, as the head quickly
      dislodged from the creature and fell to the ground. His sword went through
      it like a hot knife through butter, and it was enough to make Han Sen
      question whether or not it was actually a sacred-blood creature.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Sacred-Blood Creature Hunted: Mountain Lizard. The Beast Soul Was
        Not Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount Of
        Sacred Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      But the voice confirmed what Zhu Ting had told him, that it was indeed a
      sacred-blood creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was chuffed. He now knew for sure that having unlocked his gene
      lock, his base power had increased by a dizzying amount, not just his
      abilities of perception.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, even sacred-blood creatures could be killed with little to no
      effort. This was powerful power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting, who remained at the bottom, continued looking up as if he was
      frozen. He did not say a word. Even he was shocked at how easy it was for
      Han Sen to slay the sacred-blood creature.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The mountain lizard now fell to the ground, as did Han Sen. Quickly, Zhu
      Ting sprang to help pick his master up. But then he said, &#8220;You
      asshole. I asked you to help me out and weaken the fiend; I didn&#8217;t
      ask you to kill it! Did you get the beast soul?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was careless. Sometimes I don&#8217;t know my own strength.
      I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221; Han Sen gave a wry smile while he
      apologized, and then he continued, &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t get the beast
      soul; really! How about I make it up to you by finding another
      sacred-blood beast soul, eh? I&#8217;ll weaken it and let you get in the
      final hit. Does that sound okay?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhu Ting calmed down after hearing that, but he still had to double-check.
      So he asked, &#8220;But you really didn&#8217;t get the beast soul?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I, Han Sen, in the name of the deities that command our existence,
      swear a proclamation that I did not receive a beast soul. If I did, smite
      me, oh heavenly beings!&#8221; Han Sen jovially said aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What kind of oath is that? Do you think I&#8217;ll believe that?
      Few people actually die from swearing such a thing. Swear again, and this
      time, say that you will never ever have a wife!&#8221; Zhu Ting said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did as he requested and said it, which comforted him fully. They
      then hauled the mountain lizard&#8217;s body onto a summoned mount and
      decided to return to the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Honestly, though; how have you achieved what you have? You have
      only been in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary for less than a year, yet
      you have grown so much and achieved so many things. You haven&#8217;t
      unlocked your gene lock, have you?&#8221; On his way back, Zhu Ting
      watched Han Sen with fervent curiosity. Now, he couldn&#8217;t help but
      ask.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Opening a gene lock is not that hard,&#8221; Han Sen told him,
      without blinking. Zhu Ting wasn&#8217;t sure if what he had said was a
      confirmation, but he chose to believe that he had indeed. After all, Han
      Sen had been in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary for a way too short a
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the shelter, Han Sen returned to his room to see a woman reclining
      on a chair reading his books.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he could only see her shadow from the doorway, Han Sen already
      knew that it was Queen. Her body was far too special, and its beauty was
      difficult not to recognize.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not expect Queen to receive word and come to see him so soon.
      It looked as if she was taking his inclusion within her team as a serious
      thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Pingqing said you are willing to join my team?&#8221; Queen put
      down her book and turned around to look at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221; Han Sen nodded.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What made you change your mind so soon?&#8221; Queen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve had it rattling around my head for the past few days,
      and with my sacred geno points almost being at max capacity, I thought
      this would be a good time for me to find out if there are any creatures
      above the sacred-blood class. So, yes, after giving it much thought, I
      have decided to join you,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You won&#8217;t be tagging along to watch, you know. You will have
      to obey my command. These creatures are extremely dangerous, and those who
      have unlocked their gene lock can still perish in the blink of an eye.
      Especially you. So, when the team is fighting, you must adhere to my
      orders and leave that lone wolf nonsense behind,&#8221; Queen told him
      with a stern face.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know that.&#8221; Han Sen nodded. He then said, &#8220;But there
      is something I would like to tell you. My pet has this special ability
      that causes creatures of the surrounding area to fall back. I am not sure
      if it will have the same effect on these super creatures, and what&#8217;s
      more, my pet cannot attack creatures.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I already guessed it made creatures flee, but I had expected it to
      fight back. The former ability is what I value the most, anyway,&#8221;
      Queen said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Wait, so that&#8217;s all you want?&#8221; Han Sen froze.</p>

    <p>
      Queen then told him, &#8220;There are a lot of creatures around this
      powerful one we have set our sights on. Although we are not afraid of
      them, fighting them alongside this bigger super creature would prove too
      much of a hassle. Not to mention dangerous. With your pet in tow, we would
      not have to worry about the others, which would allow us all to focus on
      the primary target.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Now Han Sen knew why Queen wanted his presence so badly.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You sort things out here this night. Tomorrow, you can come with
      me. I&#8217;m only passing through today, so I thought I&#8217;d stop by.
      For attacking a powerful creature, I already have a plan in motion. When
      you come with me, however, you&#8217;ll have to meet and greet the team.
      If they have no objection, we&#8217;ll have no problem making you a
      member,&#8221; Queen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wait, so you aren&#8217;t the absolute decider?&#8221; Han Sen
      frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;When I created this team, we established a rule. For the acceptance
      of a new team member, a unanimous vote must take place. Although I am the
      team&#8217;s leader, I cannot override this rule.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      The next day, Han Sen arranged for others to deal with the shelter&#8217;s
      business in his time away, and with the silver fox in hand, followed Queen
      out of the Icefield.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the silver fox in their company, they were not hassled by any
      intervening creatures, and before long, they arrived at the oceanside.
      There, Queen summoned a whale for a ship and rode it alongside Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was quite amazing, as no creatures of the sea decided to
      harass them there, either. This seemed to satisfy Queen, as she now looked
      at the silver fox with greater kindness.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen couldn&#8217;t enjoy the same treatment, for she had not
      spoken to him once for the duration of their journey together. And the way
      she looked at him was cold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen understood that she was still angry with him over what happened
      that day. Knowing his place, and acknowledging the need to give her space,
      he avoided talking with her in fear of increasing the tension between
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      They sailed across the sea for two days before they caught sight of a
      black island on the horizon. Queen beelined for it, clearly marking it as
      her destination.
