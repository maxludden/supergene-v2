	<p>“Help me, Little Star.” Han Sen saw Little Silver and Bao’er sitting on the back of Little Star, and nothing
		seemed to be happening to them. As for Little Star, it didn’t seem to be affected by that pulling force at all.
		It was floating in the sky, relaxed. Han Sen called for Little Star’s attention, and at the same time, he pulled
		back his power and stopped fighting that pulling force. Instead, he dived.</p>

	<p><em>Splash!</em></p>

	<p>Han Sen fell into the lake. Unexpectedly, the fluorescent lake water wasn’t cold at all, but warm like a hot
		spring, which was very comfortable.</p>

	<p>However, that powerful pulling force didn’t give Han Sen a chance to actually enjoy the sensation.</p>

	<p>Re-engaging his power, Han Sen fought that terrific gravity-like power and grabbed a hold of Xu Mi. He then threw
		Xu Mi into the sky.</p>

	<p>Little Star turned its body in the sky and caught Xu Mi with its tail, putting him on its back.</p>

	<p>Han Sen then dived into the water like a dragon, and he swam toward Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu who were still
		sinking. He then threw them out of the water one by one.</p>

	<p>Little Star then flew toward them, putting both of them on its back.</p>

	<p>He then found Dragon Chef, and after throwing her out of the water, Han Sen was about to rush out himself.
		However, he felt that something was binding his feet, and a horrifying force was dragging him down deeper into
		the water.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used his God’s geno core and bloodthirsty ant king power at the same time, yet they couldn’t resist that
		powerful pulling force, and he was being dragged into the lake.</p>

	<p>“G<em>dd</em>mn it”, there’s definitely something down there! Han Sen was shocked. The God’s geno core, together
		with bloodthirsty ant king and Han Sen’s own body, made Han Sen as powerful as ordinary super creatures, or
		perhaps even stronger.</p>

	<p>But those forces combined weren’t a match for the force in the water. It kept dragging Han Sen down.</p>

	<p>Han Sen tried to fight it, but that didn’t work very well. He wanted to see what was dragging him down, but he
		could only see spots of light beneath him. Other than those, nothing was visible.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt that something had bound his feet, so he focused on that. He summoned his Split-Knife and slashed
		toward whatever was trapping his feet After slashing several times, he couldn’t find anything to cut. The force
		trapping him didn’t show any sign of relieving.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was completely shocked. Split-Knife was able to easily kill super creatures, so if something was actually
		binding his feet, he should’ve cut it already. However, he didn’t slash anything, yet he still felt that his
		feet were trapped, which kind of confused him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t have time to think about it now. The force was getting stronger and stronger, and it was pulling
		him down relentlessly. Han Sen was already over a thousand feet deep in the lake.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t know what was down there. Perhaps there was a giant bloody mouth waiting for him at the bottom,
		waiting to eat and swallow him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen entered super king spirit mode immediately.</p>

	<p>Before Han Sen could take further action, he felt the force at his feet relax, and the power binding his ankles
		disappeared. He couldn’t feel that pulling force anymore.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t have the mental capacity to wonder why that force suddenly disappeared. He summoned all his
		courage and rushed forward, and without the pulling force, Han Sen successfully flew out of the lake.</p>

	<p>As he breached the surface, Han Sen deactivated the super king spirit mode, already as he didn’t want Xu Mi and
		the others to see it.</p>

	<p>Seeing Han Sen appear from the lake, Little Star chuffed in joy and rushed toward Han Sen, putting him on its
		back.</p>

	<p>“What happened? Why did it take you so long to come out? Did you see anything down there?” the Dragon Lady Chef
		asked Han Sen curiously.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had saved all of them, so naturally, he had the power to get out himself, which was why they didn’t think
		of anything else. They thought that Han Sen found something down there.</p>

	<p>Han Sen smiled. “I didn’t find anything. After I pushed you guys out, something trapped my feet, and my strength
		couldn’t resist the power of that thing. I kept sinking, and thank God, I got rid of it and got away.”</p>

	<p>Everyone heard what Han Sen said, and they all looked at Han Sen’s feet. Everyone was dazed by what they had just
		seen, and they all looked at Han Sen in a weird way.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, I can’t believe you have such a weird habit.” Jing Jiwu looked at Han Sen, seeming confused.</p>

	<p>What are you talking about? Han Sen was dazed. He then looked down at his feet and found himself equally
		surprised.</p>

	<p>Out of nowhere, Han Sen had a shoe on one of his feet. Han Sen was sure that it was definitely not his shoe.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen came to Wind Song Desert, he had been wearing a beast soul armor, but he hadn’t worn any shoes.</p>

	<p>Besides, he was still wearing the armor, and the fighting boots were attached to the armor. How was it possible
		that he was wearing a shoe?</p>

	<p>However, there was indeed a shoe on his left foot, and it was a high-heeled shoe that belonged to a woman.</p>

	<p>The shoe looked fabulous, and it was comparable with the shoes of luxury brands, if not better. With Han Sen
		wearing the shoe, it made Han Sen’s big foot look a bit delicate.</p>

	<p>Even weirder, the shoe was made of crystal, and so was the heel.</p>

	<p>“Please trust me, this is not my shoe. I’m not Cinderella. Why I am even wearing this?” Han Sen asked while
		lifting his foot, trying to get the shoe off.</p>

	<p>However, the shoe seemed to be attached to his foot, and it was impervious to Han Sen’s attempts to pull it off.
	</p>

	<p>“Are you still trying to deny that this is your shoe? If it’s not your shoe, why does it fit your foot so well?
		Don’t deny it anymore, Cinderella. Go back and marry your prince”, said Jing Jiwu.</p>

	<p>“F*ck Cinderella. Even if I am a character in the fairy tale, I’m the prince.” Han Sen took out his Split-Knife
		and stabbed the crystal shoe.</p>

	<p>Followed by a sharp sound, the Split-Knife bounced up, and there wasn’t even a white scar on the crystal heel.
	</p>

	<p>Everyone was shocked after seeing that. Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu had both seen Han Sen kill Blood Bone Demon with
		his Split-Knife, and it was a blade that could easily cut a super creature in half.</p>

	<p>However, it didn’t leave even a mark on the shoe. It was shocking, and Lin Feng and the others were now worried.
	</p>

	<p>“How is your foot? Does anything feel wrong?” Lin Feng asked, staring at the crystal heel.</p>

	<p>“I feel wrong everywhere now” , said Han Sen, bummed. He wasn’t actually hurt, but he was indeed deeply upset.
	</p>

	<p>The crystal heel was on his left foot, but the foot felt fine. He didn’t even feel like he was wearing a shoe;
		otherwise, he would’ve noticed the shoe before.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought of it, and he missed a heartbeat. He then said, “Was this crystal shoe the thing that was
		dragging me down while I was in the water?”</p>
