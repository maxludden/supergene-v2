<h2>Shadow Toxic Bee Enclave</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2203</h3>

<p>Han Sen took Huangfu Jing back with him to Planet Eclipse. She
had just earned her own Jade Drum, and since she was worried about
being ambushed while out-and-about, she wanted to stay there for
some time. She would wait until things settled down before moving
on.</p>
<p>Sonic Butterfly King had learned where Han Sen came from, but it
would be pointless to go after Han Sen when he was already so far
behind. He managed to get in touch with people to block Han Sen’s
way, but they were unable to find him, either. So, eventually,
Sonic Butterfly King decided to give up.</p>
<p>After all, they couldn’t go into Narrow Moon to find him. They
couldn’t risk offending the Rebate.</p>
<p>On his way back, Han Sen dropped a few droplets of his own blood
onto the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. He hoped to earn the Jade Drum’s
approval gradually.</p>
<p>In Planet Eclipse’s base, people were in the middle of practice
when a sudden report was received. Someone came running in, telling
them of an army of xenogeneics converging on their position.</p>
<p>Han Meng’er, Zero, Little Angel, and Han Yan went out to take a
look. There, they found a mountain that was swarmed with what
appeared to be red clouds. The clouds were heading toward the base
so quickly that they’d arrive in only a little while.</p>
<p>The red clouds weren’t clouds, of course. They were swarms of
red bees that were each the size of a dog. They were very powerful,
and the sight made Han Yan frown. “When did Planet Eclipse come to
possess xenogeneics such as this? I have never seen them
before.”</p>
<p>As this occurred, Night River King was watching Planet Eclipse’s
base. His expression looked venomous, and he said, “Shadow Queen
Bees are special xenogeneics that come from Planet Queen Bee. They
are only Dukes, but they sure breed quickly. If there’s enough
food, she can make lower-level Shadow Bees. But that primary Shadow
Queen a mutant Duke xenogeneic. Aside from being able to produce
Shadow Bees like the rest, the mutant Shadow Queen Bee can also
produce Duke Shadow Bees. The Queen didn’t have much time, and it
has only produced two thus far, but that should be enough to deal
with Han Sen’s base.”</p>
<p>“Shadow Queen Bees eat the flesh of enemies and place their eggs
inside the carcasses. Ah, when Han Sen returns and sees all this,
the look on his face will be so sweet…” Night River King gritted
his teeth.</p>
<p>Night River King wasn’t worried about the consequences. A Shadow
Queen Bee was one of the xenogeneics that escaped from the cargo
ship. It would look like an accident, and no one would know that it
was his fault.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen believed it was him, there was nothing he could
do but make wild accusations. Night River King wanted this, though.
He wanted Han Sen to hate him. It would be painful for Han Sen to
know he couldn’t do anything about that seething hatred.</p>
<p>“This is the beginning of making me your enemy,” Night River
King spat. He really loathed Han Sen.</p>
<p>The Shadow Bees appeared like wisps of red clouds under the
command of the two Dukes in charge of the army. They raced towards
the base. Night River King was prepared to enjoy the fight, but a
blue shield suddenly appeared. It enveloped the entire base and
shielded it.</p>
<p>The red clouds of Shadow Bees came down like a barrage against
the blue shields, but a mere touch sent them blasting back. Even
the two Duke Shadow Bees up front were unable to get through.</p>
<p>Night River King’s jaw tightened. He felt a little frustrated
about the result, as he hadn’t expected Han Sen to leave his blue
shield treasure in the base.</p>
<p>Night River King thought Han Sen would carry a defensive item
such as that everywhere he went. If he knew Han Sen hadn’t taken it
with him, he wouldn’t have concocted the grand scheme to attack
Planet Eclipse. If Han Sen didn’t have the shield, fighting him
one-on-one would be far easier.</p>
<p>There was no point in wasting time on regret, though. The Shadow
Bees were unable to break the shield.</p>
<p>The Shadow Bees fired a toxic substance from their nasty
stingers. They were like red lights as they splashed across the
blue shield. They did nothing to harm the composition of the
shield, though.</p>
<p>Although the shield was weakened by the fact that it had to
protect the entire base, it would still be very difficult for
Marquises and Dukes to break it down.</p>
<p>As Night River King wrestled with various ideas, the blue shield
suddenly disappeared. The bees outside came racing in.</p>
<p>“Did it fail because the shield’s user didn’t have enough
strength?” Night River King wondered. “Could the user not keep the
shield raised?”</p>
<p>Soon after, Night River King realized that his assumption hadn’t
been quite right. When a fair number of those Shadow Bees came
racing in, the shield was raised once more. Most of the Shadow Bees
were still on the outside, but a decent chunk had made it in.</p>
<p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>
<p>Black arrows began flying beneath the shield. Not long after, a
dozen of the Shadow Bees on the inside were slain.</p>
<p>And then, a group of Kate appeared. They began gathering the
bodies of the Shadow Bees inside the base.</p>
<p>Night River King’s eyes began to twitch. His plan hadn’t worked,
and he had just given Planet Eclipse a massive number of free
xenogeneics. He wished he could go in there himself and destroy
what Han Sen had built.</p>
<p>When the Kate kids brought the Shadow Bee bodies back into the
base, the shield disappeared again. It reappeared a millisecond
later, shutting off another section of the Shadow Bee army.</p>
<p>Night River King laughed. One of the Shadow Bees inside was a
Duke. The others were just Marquises. No matter how strong they
were, no one there could slay a Duke Shadow Bee.</p>
<p>Night River King was already imagining how the Duke Shadow Bee
would slaughter them all when suddenly, a black arrow came at the
Duke Shadow Bee.</p>
<p>The Duke Shadow Bee reacted quickly, far more quickly than any
Marquise Shadow Bee could have managed. As the black arrow rose
toward it, the bee’s stinger lit up and fired a toxic squirt at the
arrow.</p>
<p>The toxic juice sprayed toward the arrow, and the arrow suddenly
sank. It adjusted its course to duck under the toxic juice, then it
rose against and punched through Duke Shadow Bee’s body with great
speed.</p>
<p>The Shadow Bee was shining red. When the arrow pierced its body,
the arrow came to a stop.</p>
<p>“It isn’t easy to kill a Duke Shadow Bee.” Night River King
laughed mockingly.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the arrow entered the Shadow Bee’s body, it was trapped
inside. But then, a scary explosion occurred within the Duke Shadow
Bee’s body.</p>
<p>The red light shattered, and a gaping hole was torn in its side.
It was heavily injured, and it fell to struggle on the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Another arrow was fired at it. It pierced through the Shadow Bee
via the already-dealt wound. The creature’s head then blew up,
bringing a swift end to the Duke Shadow Bee.</p>
<p>While that happened, the rest of the Marquise Shadow Bees were
dealt with by Han Yan.</p>
<p>“How is this possible? That woman is just a Marquise, and yet
she can so simply kill a Duke Shadow Bee? This is impossible! She
is Han Sen’s blood, but since when have crystallizers ever been
that strong?” Night River King was incredibly angry, and he
couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
