<p>As the white light shone brighter and brighter in the dark, it
became impossible to miss. Many deified elites noticed its
presence, and their faces were all drawn in shock.</p>
<p>As he watched through a video screen, Ji Yang Sheng noticed the
white dot. The white dot was too small, though. It didn’t
necessarily mean that Barr was deified yet, so he wasn’t sure what
it meant.</p>
<p>“A substance chain… That is a substance chain! Barr is going to
become deified…” Moldo, who was next to him, saw the white dot. His
face warped, and he could barely believe his eyes.</p>
<p>“What? What did you say, Mr. Moldo?” Ji Yang Sheng thought he
might have heard that incorrectly. So, he asked Mister Moldo to
repeat what he had said.</p>
<p>Before Moldo could reply, Ji Yang Sheng was answered in an
unmistakable way.</p>
<p>That white dot grew quickly, and the black Destroyed power
became white all of a sudden. It was like fire as it wreathed
around Barr’s body.</p>
<p>Only Barr’s black bones remained, but those bones were now
becoming white. And that white Destroyed power started to rebuild
his flesh.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Before Barr could emerge from that white Destroyed power, the
fabric of space seemed to twist and tear. It was like the universe
was falling apart. Barr’s body fell into that space and
vanished.</p>
<p>When Barr disappeared, the scary collapse of space stopped.</p>
<p>“What is going on? I don’t think Barr had finished changing. Why
did he vanish?” Many people were confused by what they saw. They
didn’t know why space had seemed to collapse around Barr.</p>
<p>“He became deified. The core area doesn’t allow deified elites
to enter. Once he became deified, he had to be kicked out of the
core,” said someone who understood.</p>
<p>“Barr… became deified…” Ji Yang Sheng was shocked. And then, he
felt so annoyed and jealous. If he had paid the two thousand genes
that had been requested of him, he was the one who would be deified
right now.</p>
<p>“Really? Barr became deified?” Someone in the audience didn’t
believe what they had just witnessed.</p>
<p>“He is deified? This has to be a hoax. Come on, are you telling
me Han Sen made another deified?”</p>
<p>“Does anyone mind explaining to me how this could happen?”</p>
<p>“He is God’s Daddy. That’s why, and this is further evidence. He
really can do this.”</p>
<p>“Two thousand King xenogeneic genes? You only need two thousand
King xenogeneic genes to be made deified? This world has gone mad.
Or am I the one that has been driven insane? Since when did
deifieds become so cheap?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the whole universe seemed to go crazy. Everyone
that looked at Han Sen no longer saw a person. They saw a god
statue that people could make wishes before. They all wanted to go
before him and bow, hoping to have their foreheads touched and be
made deified.</p>
<p>“Barr really became deified?” The Sixth Uncle stared at his
screen with a gaping mouth. He struggled to close it. Up until Han
Sen departed the core area, he looked strange.</p>
<p>“It will be easy enough for us to find out if Barr really did
become deified. All we have to do is send someone over to the
Destroyed and learn the truth right from the horse’s mouth,” Meng
Lie said.</p>
<p>Every race leader was doing the same thing as the Extreme King.
They wanted to learn about Barr’s condition. Barr didn’t remain
hidden for long, though. He stood before everyone, not hiding the
power he received by becoming deified.</p>
<p>“He really did become deified.” There was no doubt about it now.
Every person of the higher races looked at Han Sen as if he was
mad. Everyone was waving their xenogeneic genes, hoping they could
draw Han Sen out to bless them.</p>
<p>Two thousand xenogeneic genes was a high number, but compared to
being a deified, it was nothing. It was peanuts. Exchanging two
thousand King xenogeneic genes to become a deified was more than
worth it.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was willing to give more blessings, every high race
would pay for blessings until they bankrupted themselves.</p>
<p>Arthur had watched Barr become deified. He was so happy about
the result. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes had been handed out
in return for a deified Barr. This was so f*cking worth it.</p>
<p>Even Dia Robber was surprised. He thought Han Sen’s blessing
would only reinforce Barr’s genes. He hadn’t expected Barr to
become a deified straight away.</p>
<p>“This man is too scary.” Dia Robber wasn’t that surprised about
Barr becoming deified, though. He was worried more than
anything.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Dia Robber feeling this way, either. Many elites
of the higher race were scared of Han Sen. This was a fear that
they had never experienced before.</p>
<p>A King class being was manufacturing deified beings. It was
almost too shocking to believe. He was able to take the whole
universe and flip it on its head.</p>
<p>Ordinary Kings and nobles didn’t think much of it, though. They
just thought what Han Sen had done was something of a miracle.</p>
<p>“Mr. Godfather is too strong, but I don’t have two thousand King
class genes. Maybe if I did, I would ask him to bless me so I could
become deified.”</p>
<p>“Two thousand xenogeneic genes are far beyond what I have. Would
he take women, instead? I would pay with my body if I could.”</p>
<p>“Stop dreaming. Look in the mirror. Are you as pretty as those
two women the Godfather has?”</p>
<p>“Fuck! He has all the good stuff, and he has sick power. He even
has insanely pretty women. He has it all.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was randomly bestowed this Godfather title. Before, many
people referred to Han Sen as God’s Daddy. But that title was a
secret one, and not something they would refer to him as in
public.</p>
<p>After this event, though, the Godfather title became quite
common. It made him sound like a clergyman, but it didn’t mean
that.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng was the most depressed of all now, though. He had
pulled the rickshaw for Han Sen for a very long time. He even gave
him five hundred King class xenogeneic genes. He received nothing
in return. Instead, Barr was made deified.</p>
<p>If God gave Ji Yang Sheng the chance to do things over, he would
tell Han Sen, “Yes, I will give them to you.”</p>
<p>If he had known that Han Sen could really make people deified,
he would have been willing to pay more than two thousand King
xenogeneic genes. He would have been willing to pay double that
sum.</p>
<p>The only issue was that no one had believed Han Sen could make
others deified before this. After all, it did sound a little
ridiculous.</p>
<p>When Han Sen entered the core area, the Kings of every race came
out and shocked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Teacher Han, I brought you two thousand King xenogeneic genes.
If you are willing to bless me, I will give them to you.”</p>
<p>“Get lost! What is this about two thousand King xenogeneic
genes? You are being that cheap before the Godfather? I have 2500
King class xenogeneic genes. I should be blessed first.”</p>
<p>“I have 3000…”</p>
<p>Even Ji Yang Sheng had brought two thousand King class
xenogeneic genes to Han Sen, but when he saw how busy things were,
he didn’t fancy his chances. He felt so sad.</p>
