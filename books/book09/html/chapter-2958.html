<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was waiting for Auntie Mei and the
others to get rid of Han Sen in the astral instrument’s realm. Not
long later, he saw the zone disappear. With its removal, a body
fell out.</p>
<p>When he had a closer look, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was
shocked. He could not believe what he was seeing.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the astral instrument. He was standing in
the hall. Old Vulture, the eyeless beast, and Auntie Mei were
bloody and lying on the floor. They all looked terribly
injured.</p>
<p>This was very shocking. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster did not say
anything. He wanted to leave the hall and escape into the
darkness.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster, are you going to leave without saying goodbye?”
Han Sen suddenly appeared in front of Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. He
prohibited Ancient Abyss Grandmaster from following the path he had
chosen to depart by.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster knew it was futile to say anything. He
had to go through this to live. He shook his body. Suddenly, eight
of his clones appeared. They went in eight different
directions.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He could not tell which one was the true
Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. The eight clones shared the same
presence as Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. All of them looked as if
they shared the same body.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster, there is no rush to leave,” Han Sen coldly said.
His body flashed. He took out his cause karma knife. He slashed out
eight knife lights. They were slashing toward Grandmaster’s eight
clones.</p>
<p>The knife was still the same knife. The knife skill was still
the same knife skill. Because Han Sen’s true god power made him
much stronger than before, he could slash eight times. Eight knife
lights almost slashed eight clones instantly.</p>
<p>Seven clones were destroyed. Only one clone had a turtle shield
that blocked Han Sen’s strike.</p>
<p>The teeth power hit the turtle shield. It created a deep mark.
It almost broke the shield. The powerful strength hit the shield,
and Ancient Abyss Grandmaster went flying. He was spilling
blood.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The turtle shield was cut in half. Although one slash did not
break it, with the teeth power’s ripping power, the turtle shield
had been broken.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was in space. He dropped the broken
turtle shield and quickly went flying into the darkness. He was
like lightning or a weird bird. He used a borrowing strength skill.
Han Sen’s slash power became the fuel for his escape.</p>
<p>“Very good Ancient Abyss Grandmaster.” Han Sen had to compliment
him. After all, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was a worthy grandmaster
for the Extreme King.</p>
<p>“If you seek to leave this place now, you have underestimated
me.” Han Sen used the astral instrument that he had just recently
possessed. Suddenly, the sky was full of starlight. He put Ancient
Abyss Grandmaster into its realm.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster, thank you for your astral instrument. If you
didn’t do this, you could have escaped.” Han Sen looked at Ancient
Abyss Grandmaster and smiled.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster had a wry smile as he said, “If I knew
you were this strong, you could have easily dealt with the fish
bird and eyeless demon. Then, I would not have had to do what I
did.”</p>
<p>“So what are you planning to do now?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Upon hearing him, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster looked at him in
shock and asked, “Does that mean you are not going to kill me?”</p>
<p>“That is what you need to ask yourself,” Han Sen coldly
said.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster quietly asked.</p>
<p>“You and everything you know.” Han Sen had a lot of questions
about the Extreme King. The most likely people that could answer
him were either the grandmaster or Bai King.</p>
<p>“I do not know much. I just do everything the king commands me
to do.” While he was talking, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster’s hands
suddenly flipped. A weird coin appeared in his hands. When he
flipped his hands, the coin twisted space and dropped his body in
space.</p>
<p>“See you later, Brother Han!” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster’s voice
came from that space as his body vanished.</p>
<p>“Did I approve of your departure?” Han Sen saw Ancient Abyss
Grandmaster disappear in space, so he summoned his pistols and
fired at the twisted space.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The space exploded. That twisted space was frozen. Ancient Abyss
Grandmaster was stuck in space. He could not totally go into space,
but he could not drop out of the space either. He could no longer
do anything. He was stuck inside that portal.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster’s expression changed. He had a true
god ying-yang space coin. It was able to locate a direction. He
needed to use the ying-yang space coin to teleport wherever he
chose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, using the ying-yang space coin took time. He
spoke to Han Sen so he could set it up.</p>
<p>When the ying-yang space coin activated, even the space powers
and time powers could not stop sending him back. Yet Han Sen’s
power froze the entire portal. It was hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster knew he was unable to run, so he
immediately said, “Ask me whatever it is you wish to know. If I
know, I will tell you everything.”</p>
<p>“Grandmaster is so smart. You have so many tricks. I will not
dare to ask you stuff here.” Han Sen raised his hand. A metal tower
appeared. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was stuck with Forever Solid
power. He was about to be taken into Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster wanted to fight back, but Han Sen shot
him once more. He could not move, so he was sucked into Destiny’s
Tower.</p>
<p>Seeing Ancient Abyss Grandmaster trapped on the seventh floor of
Destiny’s Tower, Han Sen put away the astral instrument and
returned to the holy palace’s plaza.</p>
<p>Old Vulture, the eyeless big beast, and Auntie Mei were in front
of the hall. They looked at Han Sen weirdly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in a rush to get to Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, so he
ignored them. He did not expect their wounds to have healed in such
a short amount of time. They were almost fully recovered. It was no
wonder why they were true god xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked through the holy palace and asked the three of
them, “Where is Littleflower?”</p>
<p>“Littleflower really isn’t at the palace. Old Cat took him to
the sanctuaries to harvest genes.” Auntie Mei answered Han Sen’s
question. Her attitude was a bit different from before. Her answers
were different too.</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen coldly asked. He kept walking.</p>
<p>“We told you Littleflower is not here!” the eyeless big beast
screamed. “What else do you seek to do?”</p>
<p>“What do I want to do? I thought I told you ages ago.” Han Sen
kept walking. He raised his cause karma knife. He brought the knife
above his head and slashed it down. Scary knife air was rushing
through the hall. “Today, I will tear down the holy palace.”</p>
