<h2>Killing the Siren Elder</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2375</h3>

<p>“The Crystal God Conch became deified because of that Siren
Bottle.” Han Sen looked at the Siren Elder. She didn’t look old
anymore. It looked as if she had returned to being a young
woman.</p>
<p>The Siren Elder swung her fishtail, and waves surged out behind
her as she swam away from the blood altar and went toward Han Sen
and Lan Haixin. She laughed haughtily. “As long as I possess the
holy bottle, anything I desire is within my grasp.”</p>
<p>After that, the Siren Elder waved her hand. A rainbow light
fired at Han Sen and Lan Haixin. Her powers were now very different
than her original abilities, and her attack was similar to the
blurry rainbow lights that were visible inside the Siren
Bottle.</p>
<p>The blurry rainbow lights came down, transforming into crystal
bottles around Han Sen and the others to trap them.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen the Crystal God Conch use an almost identical
power, and now he knew for sure that the power had come from the
Siren Bottle.</p>
<p>But the Siren Elder was weaker than the Crystal God Conch had
been. She generated a substance chain power, but it was very weak.
It wasn’t solid like the Crystal God Conch’s substance chains.</p>
<p>“It looks like she can’t really control the power of the Siren
Bottle, but how did the Crystal God Conch wield the Siren Bottle’s
power so well? It couldn’t have activated the Siren Bottle. And it
didn’t have the Siren blood necessary to perform the sacrifice,
either,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin’s power struck the crystal bottle, but the attempt
was futile. Her attack struck the surface of the bottle with King
class power, but it wasn’t enough to even rattle it on the
spot.</p>
<p>“Haha! It is useless! This is the Siren Bottle’s power… Allow me
to take your blood so that I may use it on the Siren Bottle. When I
control it in its entirety, I will achieve even more power, and
then I can start my own race that will exist all across the
universe. I will become an alpha!” A maniacal grin split the Siren
Elder’s face, and the rainbow colors that enshrouded her became
even brighter.</p>
<p>The glass bottle grew smaller as the Siren Elder applied
pressure to it. She wanted to squash the people inside it.</p>
<p>“Little red bird.” Han Sen understood how the Siren Elder was
making use of the Siren Bottle, but he didn’t hesitate to summon
the little red bird.</p>
<p>The little red bird fluttered over to Bao’er’s shoulder, then it
hopped onto Han Sen’s finger and chirped at him.</p>
<p>“We’re about done here. Get rid of this old hag, but leave her
final few breaths to me. I want to finish her off myself,” Han Sen
commanded the little red bird.</p>
<p>The Siren Elder looked as if she had heard a funny joke, and she
laughed. “This isn’t the end yet, and you are already going
crazy.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The words had barely left the Siren Elder’s mouth when the
little red bird took flight. Flames began to lick around her body
as she rose from Han Sen’s finger. Suddenly, the little red bird
turned into a gold fire phoenix.</p>
<p>The phoenix wings gave a couple of powerful beats, raising
swathes of fire that charred the walls of the glass bottle. The
substance chains that composed the crystal walls were like paper.
The flames danced across them, and they were incinerated into ashes
in a flash.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Siren Elder’s power is far inferior to the
Crystal God Conch’s. This is like a fake deified’s power,” Han Sen
thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Dei–deified xenogeneic… No… Impossible!” The Siren Elder’s eyes
were wide, filled with utter disbelief at what she saw.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin couldn’t believe it, either. She stared in amazement
at the little red bird that had turned into a fire phoenix.</p>
<p>The two Sirens were familiar with the little red bird already,
as Bao’er played with the creature every day. And she especially
liked to bully it. Lan Haixin sometimes felt sorry for the little
thing, but it had never seemed to mind getting bullied by Bao’er.
It continued to follow her at all times.</p>
<p>That little red bird was actually a deified xenogeneic. The
thought was mind-boggling.</p>
<p>But the truth couldn’t be denied. The fire phoenix that the
little red bird had turned into was now flying towards the old
Siren woman. And when it reached her, it spat out a golden
fireball.</p>
<p>The Siren Elder screamed, her voice thrumming weirdly around
them. Her body was shining, and that light became a glass bottle
that tried to encase the little red bird, but it turned to dust the
instant it came close to those fires. The flames lashed wildly
towards the Siren Elder.</p>
<p>The Siren Elder was unable to dodge. She gathered up her angelic
god light to block the attacks with her hands, but when her hands
touched the fire, they started to burn. And then, her whole body
was aflame.</p>
<p>“Argh, no! This is impossible! I want to be an alpha… I want to
receive this holy bottle…” the Siren Elder screamed angrily as the
cruel fire consumed her. Not long after, her burned body was turned
to ash.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t a real deified power, huh? It looks like her
methods were riddled with flaws. Bai Yi and Lan Haixin’s blood have
to be combined to control the Siren Bottle.” Han Sen pulled out his
Ghost Teeth Knife. He walked forward and cut off the dying Siren
Elder’s head.</p>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Siren Lady. Mutant xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen killed the Siren Elder, the fire continued to
burn. The Siren Elder’s body turned into ash. A blue gem that must
have been her xenogeneic gene sat amidst the grey.</p>
<p>“But I didn’t get her beast soul!” Han Sen grabbed the gem and
held it in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen placed the blue gem into his chest pocket, then
approached the altar.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen tried going to the altar, but the blurry rainbow stopped
him short.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He simulated the Siren Elder, but he still
couldn’t access the altar.</p>
<p>Lan Haixin bit her lips and said, “It looks like you have wasted
your efforts here. You won’t be able to get the holy bottle, after
all.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored her. She looked at the Siren Bottle for a while
and suddenly said, “It is you, right? The Sirens’ final holy
virgin, Bai Yi’s mom?”</p>
<p>“You are a clever kid.” A woman’s voice came out of the Siren
Bottle. The blurry rainbow in the bottle came into focus, turning
into a beautiful Siren woman who hung at the entrance.</p>
<p>She had white ears and white scales. Her skin looked like jade,
and it was even smoother than Han Sen’s Jadeskin.</p>
<p>Her hair was long and black, and it reached down to her waist.
Her eyes were like obsidian. Her face was very attractive, and a
soft smile warmed her expression.</p>
<p>“Ho… Holy Virgin…” Lan Haixin stared at the woman by the Siren
Bottle in shock. She didn’t know how to compose herself at that
moment.</p>
<p>All the things she thought could never happen had transpired in
such an incredibly short time. Lan Haixin felt like her entire
lifetime hadn’t contained as many unexpected twists as the last ten
minutes.</p>
