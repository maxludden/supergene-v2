<p>Aside from that, Han Sen felt no changes occurring within his
body. His Dongxuan Armor’s power wasn’t locked or limited.</p>
<p>When the fire went out, the Dongxuan Armor had turned into a
white, semi-transparent crystal. It looked like a dream, like
something that couldn’t possibly exist in the real world.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes suddenly widened. He generated his Dongxuan Sutra
power and realized his dongxuan power was activated. With it, he
could harness white phoenix fires.</p>
<p>“Now that you have the phoenix flame’s power, you can make
effective use of the phoenix feather,” the phoenix said with a
smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t overjoyed by this, though. His Dongxuan Sutra was
already fine, but now his armor was linked to the god phoenix
flame. If he used his Dongxuan Armor, it would trigger the phoenix
fire.</p>
<p>That seemed like a good thing at first thought. The phoenix
fires was a high-class power that most people would admire, but it
simply wasn’t Han Sen’s forte. If the phoenix had placed its
phoenix flames on the Dongxuan Armor, it wasn’t likely that the
fire’s only function was allowing Han Sen to use the phoenix
feather.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen immediately thought this, he didn’t say
anything to the phoenix.</p>
<p>“Go. If you can bring back that baby phoenix, I will allow your
people to live here, protected by our race,” the phoenix
promised.</p>
<p>“This place is a smoldering wasteland. Who would want to live
here?” Han Sen thought to himself. The conditions that the phoenix
had wrought on the land around it didn’t seem to be all that
inviting.</p>
<p>It seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking, though. The
phoenix continued, explaining, “This is where the phoenix race
started. Now, only I am left. I don’t really need much space
anymore. If you can bring that baby phoenix back to me, I will
allow you to make use of a million miles. You may cultivate it
however you see fit, and if an enemy shows up, I promise to help
you chase them away.”</p>
<p>After that, the phoenix looked across the burned world and said,
“After bad things reach their lowest point, good things then tend
to rise. This is an incinerated land, but it isn’t a dead realm. It
can yield benefits beyond your wildest dreams.”</p>
<p>“What kind of benefits?” Han Sen couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“Only the dying can live. Death comes first so that newborns can
grow. This xenogeneic space has extremely potent powers of life.
Any creature, whether it is a plant, animal, or xenogeneic, will
grow better here than they would in the outside world,” the phoenix
said.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I feel anything special about this place?” Han Sen
didn’t believe what the phoenix said because he couldn’t feel
anything strange going on inside him. He couldn’t detect the
lifeforce in this xenogeneic space doing anything that the phoenix
had just described.</p>
<p>“Do you have any seeds?” the phoenix asked, looking at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“I don’t have seeds, but I do have a small plant.” Han Sen
brought out a cactus from Destiny’s Tower in a glass pot.</p>
<p>“Put it in the soil,” the phoenix said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was confused. He took the cactus out of the pot and
planted it in the soil.</p>
<p>Then, a miracle happened. The cactus had been the size of a
fist, but as Han Sen watched, it began to grow. A second later, it
was the size of a football. And it was still growing.</p>
<p>“Any creature that can absorb this extreme living power can grow
quickly, just like this plant you have planted. Beneath the extreme
living power, a being can develop very fast and reach the max of
what one’s genes can support. There is only one extreme living land
in the universe, and it is here. It belongs to the phoenixes. There
is no other in the universe,” the phoenix said with a cocky
look.</p>
<p>As the phoenix spoke, the cactus that Han Sen had planted
reached the size of a barrel. And still, it continued to grow. It
shocked Han Sen a great deal. He couldn’t even explain how
staggering this was.</p>
<p>“Does all the land in this place have power similar to what I’m
seeing here?” Han Sen asked, looking at the phoenix in wonder. He
knew what that meant. If any creature could grow that rapidly in a
certain location, it almost suggested that the area was a glitch.
It went against the laws of nature.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the phoenix said with a nod.</p>
<p>Han Sen was speechless. He was so happy to hear that he might be
allowed to enter a xenogeneic space as profound as that. It would
be a great boon for the development of humans.</p>
<p>Plus, he would have a true god phoenix to protect the race.
Humans in this universe would be as safe as Tarzan. Aside from the
three higher races, no one could even attempt to assault the
territory protected by the phoenix. Now, Han Sen was seriously
considering handing over the little red bird.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Mr. Phoenix. I’m going to try my best to locate
the baby phoenix. I will bring it to you.” Han Sen licked his lips
as he spoke.</p>
<p>The phoenix was happy with Han Sen’s performance thus far, and
it didn’t keep him. It told Han Sen that when he located the baby
phoenix, he simply needed to return and ring the black-steel bell.
Then, the phoenix would come to pick up Han Sen and the baby
phoenix.</p>
<p>Han Sen collected his phoenix feather and left that nirvana. He
was so tempted by the phoenix’s offer that he thought to himself,
“It is a shame that the little red bird is a mix. If the phoenix
isn’t fond of it, this might turn bad. I shouldn’t risk it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen decided that he wouldn’t bring the little red bird
there, after all. After departing from the xenogeneic space, he
traveled a great many leagues away.</p>
<p>“The Very High don’t know that I have escaped, but I’m not going
back to Sky Palace. In case the Very High have already found out, I
should delay the news for as long as I can,” Han Sen thought for a
while. He was now planning to go back to the God Area to hunt
deified xenogeneics for a while. That way, he could max out his
deified gene tallies.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t dare stay near the nirvana. He contacted Xie
Qing King and made plans to live with him for a while.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King immediately agreed to Han Sen’s request. He gave
out orders to send ships to collect Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to pick me up. I just need to know if it is safe
where you are. I’m in trouble, and my identity can’t be exposed,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King was chewing on a big cigar. With a pleased look,
he said, “A while ago, I bought a system that was part of the Sky
Music Area. There are two planets with life, and the views aren’t
bad. I bought them to use as a vacation home. You should consider
living there. The Sky Music Area is part of the Thousand Treasures.
They are in charge of defense and security. Unless there is a
universal war, I doubt any petty thieves would risk trying to break
in.”</p>
<p>“Holy crap. Do you earn that much money from writing comics?”
Han Sen’s eyes were wide open. Xie Qing King had bought an entire
system to use as a vacation spot. It was too ridiculous to
believe.</p>
<p>“Call me Teacher Xie. I am the most famous author with the
best-selling books ever. The books have millions of fans across
millions of races across the entire universe…” Xie Qing King said
lazily, waving his cigar.</p>
<p>“Teacher Xie, does your comic studio need any extra hands?” Han
Sen was practically drooling. It sounded like easy money.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we don’t need people like you who don’t have active
imaginations. There’s also the fact that you’re very stingy.” Xie
Qing King obviously wasn’t mincing his words when it came to
insulting Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was rendered speechless. His personality was certainly
rooted in reality, but he didn’t lack imagination.</p>
<p>Still, Han Sen had to admit that he had no artistic
capabilities. Shaking his head, he struck an agreement with Xie
Qing King and went to the man’s vacation planet.</p>
