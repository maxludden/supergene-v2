<p>“What is wrong with that guy? Has he been locked up for so long that he wants to die?” Han Sen wondered.</p>

<p>But seeing Armored Man’s face, he didn’t look quite crazy.</p>

<p>Ancient Devil’s palm was getting heavier, and Han Sen couldn’t think of a way to repel it. So, he used his Bulwark Umbrella to brace against it.</p>

<p>Seeing Ancient Devil’s incoming attack, Han Sen thought to himself, “Armored Man seems to have gone crazy right after Ancient Devil decided to attack me. Is there a connection between the two?”</p>

<p>Bulwark Umbrella blocked Ancient Devil’s move. Then Han Sen spoke to his Sea of Soul, which was rolling with thunder. “Are you related to Ancient Devil?”</p>

<p>Armored Man, who had thus far refused to talk to Han Sen, was enraged. He exclaimed, “If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t be like this! Let me out; I want to kill him.”</p>

<p>After that, Armored Man kept thrashing about. He didn’t care for his wounds, he just desperately wanted to get loose, get free, and get out.</p>

<p>“Then tell me; what is your grudge with Ancient Devil?” Han Sen needed to hear more of the story than that.</p>

<p>Armored Man was unable to get free. He gritted his teeth. “I am a born-emperor created by Ancient Devil! I was in the chimenea, refining for eternity.”</p>

<p>The tone of voice was one that possessed intense hatred. It was obvious that he wanted to skin his enemy alive.</p>

<p>Han Sen was surprised, though. He wasn’t a terribly trusting individual, but Gu Qingcheng told him Armored Man’s powers were the work of a Qi Gong Master. But now, Armored Man was saying that he had been imprisoned inside the chimenea by Ancient Devil. Both stories were vastly different.</p>

<p>Ancient Devil did not look like a human Qi Gong Master, so why would he have an immortal chimenea? He couldn’t use Qi Gong.</p>

<p>“Weird. How was Ancient Devil able to imprison you? He didn’t kill you. He just made you stronger. And he even let you out. Why would you create trouble for him?” Han Sen didn’t believe him.</p>

<p>Armored Man roared, “He didn’t let me go! He just didn’t know I’d grow that much! He didn’t know I’d become strong enough to slay his guardian.”</p>

<p>Han Sen’s heart then jumped, and he asked, “Is Headless Rockman a guardian belonging to Ancient Devil?”</p>

<p>“No. Headless Rockman was damaged by Ancient Devil himself; it is why he was like that,” Armored Man answered.</p>

<p>That surprised Han Sen. He went on to ask, “Who is the Headless Rockman, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Armored Man replied. “Ancient Devil wanted Destiny’s Tower. He turned the owner of the tower into the Headless Rockman, but he was still unable to take the tower. I became strong once I was released, and I did my best to defeat Headless Rockman. I didn’t want Destiny’s Tower to be lost, either. Somehow, you managed to come into its possession.”</p>

<p>Han Sen then got to mulling what he had been told and determining whether or not Armored Man was telling the truth. Ancient Devil was an even scarier figure, if so.</p>

<p>Ancient Devil had already caused a lot of trouble in the Third God’s Sanctuary, and he had killed the master of Destiny’s Tower in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. He also created Armored Man. Trying to comprehend what his true goals might have been was a baffling endeavor.</p>

<p>While Han Sen thought this over, Armored Man was still as desperate as ever. He kept roaring and thrashing around. He said, “Let me out; I’m going to kill him!”</p>

<p>“Calm down. Ancient Devil is strong, and you are still injured. If I let you out, you won’t be able to defeat him. Wait until I find the right opportunity; once I have, I’ll free you.” Han Sen did not let him out.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not trust Armored Man, and he had used Dollar’s identity when capturing him. If he let him out, it would expose Han Sen as Dollar to everyone.</p>

<p>But Armored Man would not give up. He kept on thrashing about. It didn’t concern Han Sen much, though, as there was no chance of him getting free despite the effort.</p>

<p>Ancient Devil could not finish-off Han Sen, so he ultimately decided to leave.</p>

<p>“It looks like we have come to a draw today, so there is no point in us fighting. I implore you to consider handing Goddess back over. If you need me, just shout to me outside the gates.” After that, Ancient Devil rode the white donkey away.</p>

<p>Han Sen could not stop the white donkey, so he just let them go. There’d be no point giving chase.</p>

<p>Seeing Ancient Devil leave, Han Sen felt strange. Ancient Devil hadn’t used all his strength, and yet he was already leaving. That was surprising.</p>

<p>After Ancient Devil left, he went to meet up with Sacred’s leader and a few others.</p>

<p>“Leader, I am sorry. I was unable to kill Skysword and rescue Goddess.” Ancient Devil sighed.</p>

<p>“I am grateful you were willing to help, and it’s okay if you were unable to kill him. With your Ancient Devil power, you can just kill one creature every day. It won’t take long,” Sacred’s Leader said.</p>

<p>“Unless he kills Skysword, selecting targets will be difficult. But if he kills Skysword immediately, the Ancient Sky Mirror</p>

<p>would be useless and he wouldn’t have this much trouble,” Ghost Eagle Emperor said.</p>

<p>Elder Yin said, “It was Illusion Elder’s mistake. He did not kill Death Goddess, and he allowed Skysword to take the Ancient Sky Mirror. If he hadn’t, we would have already wiped out Skysword.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry; we will soon seize the shelter and kill Skysword,” Sacred’s leader said.</p>

<p>“It will be difficult. We cannot kill Skysword, and we cannot use the Ancient Sky Mirror. Ancient Devil killing one creature a day would still take forever because they have so many there,” Elder Yin coldly said.</p>

<p>Ancient Devil looked very upset, and he said, “To be honest, my Ancient Devil power can only take down the weaker creatures. People like Skysword? I can’t do much from a distance.”</p>

<p>Hearing Ancient Devil say this, they felt relieved. If Ancient Devil said his power could kill anyone from any distance, they would be very afraid.</p>

<p>“Kill as many as you can, anyway. We’ll find another way soon,” Sacred’s leader said.</p>

<p>“But it won’t be difficult to kill Skysword. My power is just not enough to break through that umbrella-looking geno core. If everyone helped, we could break it easily,” Ancient Devil said.</p>

<p>“Ancient Devil Emperor, he has the Ancient Sky Mirror. Even if we broke the umbrella and killed him, he could just respawn,” Ghost Eagle Emperor said.</p>

<p>“My Ancient Devil power can’t just kill someone like that, but I can still circumvent the mirror if I kill him myself. I can kill him,’ Ancient Devil said coldly.</p>

<p>“We can try it. If we co-operate, we will destroy the umbrella easily,” Ghost Eagle Emperor said.</p>
