    <p>
      One of the creatures was clad in steel armor, and it wielded a greatsword
      shrouded in green light. It was the armored phantom that Moment Queen once
      had authority over. Now, it was doing battle with a black skeleton. It
      wielded a weapon that looked like a bone itself, or some sort of horn. It
      wasn&#8217;t easy to discern what it was at first glance, but it viciously
      fought against the armored phantom. When the strange weapon in the
      skeleton&#8217;s hand collided with the phantom&#8217;s greatsword, it
      wasn&#8217;t damaged. Evidently, it was far tougher than Han Sen&#8217;s
      Flaming Rex Spike.
    </p>

    <p>
      The armored phantom saw Han Sen from afar and ran off, abandoning its
      fight against the skeleton. It didn&#8217;t stop, and it just ran and ran
      until it was out of sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skeleton had never seen Han Sen before, so it wasn&#8217;t aware of
      the power he possessed. It ran towards Han Sen with its weapon raised,
      aiming to clobber its new target over the head.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel appeared in front of Han Sen, and her transparent
      greatsword was swung to assail the bony fiend. The creature&#8217;s attack
      was so hard that she was knocked back two meters. Having its first
      attempted attack blocked, the skeleton didn&#8217;t waste any time
      switching targets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not go to help the little angel, and he just stood there
      watching its energy flow. Much to his delight, he learnt that it was a
      second-generation super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after watching for a while, he felt bored. The powers of a
      second-generation super creature no longer thrilled him, and aside from
      their element and how they were used, they all seemed to be the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      After learning many second-generation super creature energy flows, he
      started to realize how most were useless to him. His strongest skill was
      Sonic-Thunder Punch now, and the combination of those two elements proved
      far more effective than the energy flows he had learnt from any other
      second-generation super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew the reason for this, however; he was in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary. The energy flows he could simulate were all the
      same, and only allowed for a power that did not exceed the unlocking of
      the first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he entered the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary, he could most likely
      simulate the power of super creatures that had unlocked seven of their
      gene locks. Something like that was sure to be extraordinarily powerful,
      and worthy of getting excited about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s Dongxuan Sutra was a super Qi Gong, but the extent of its
      power was capped like every other skill here. Just like Jadeskin, only one
      of its gene locks could be opened. The usage of both of those skills were
      different, yes; but the power of both were practically the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question of which Qi Gong was stronger would all be down to how many
      gene locks could be opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      He would have to go to the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary to unravel and
      grasp the full power of the Dongxuan Sutra. No matter how many skills and
      powers he could simulate, it did not matter much if they were all capped
      to a single gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dongxuan Sutra could only simulate the energy flow an opponent had. They
      couldn&#8217;t be upgraded, so it was unnecessary for him to learn each
      and every one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen believed the most useful energy flows he had learnt were
      Sonic-Thunder Punch and Aero; but he also believed the energy flow of the
      armored phantom was sure to be up there with his best. Light Son of
      God&#8217;s energy flow was also quite useful, taking into account the
      incredible speed boost it gave him.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in regards to Moment Queen&#8217;s energy flow, although he could
      simulate it, his body couldn&#8217;t handle the ability of teleportation.
      Using it was sure to result in suicide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once his fitness was higher, he&#8217;d be keen to try it out, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skeleton continued to fight the little angel, so Han Sen summoned
      Moment Queen so that she might help her kill it. But the skeleton was
      cunning, and when it saw Moment Queen coming towards it, it quickly dug
      underground to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel drove her sword a few meters deep into the earth, but hit
      nothing. Its flight was a success, and she had no idea where it had now
      gone to.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Never mind, then. Let&#8217;s just go find the Empty Vine.&#8221;
      Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to scan the ground below, and
      couldn&#8217;t find a trace of the skeleton either. It appeared to be long
      gone now.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen continued walking, and when he saw the Empty Vine, he froze.</p>

    <p>
      He thought it&#8217;d just be a vine that had writhed its way up a craggy
      cliff face. But when he saw it, he felt as if he had never been so wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vine was massive. It was like a grand pillar, wreathed around itself.
      It extended upwards like a tower towards heaven. It was so high, its top
      pierced the clouds above, obscuring how tall it truly was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw it from afar, and he noticed something else. The armored
      phantom was climbing it, and not far below it, the black skeleton had
      resurfaced and was chasing it up.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were going at a hurried pace, and before long, they had both passed
      through the lofty clouds.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is the Empty Vine? That&#8217;s a big vine. How much fruit
      grows there? Do you think we&#8217;ll have to fight for the fruit?&#8221;
      Han Sen asked, while looking at the leaves and flowers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If each flower bore one fruit, the amount that would grow would seem
      limitless. And if so, there&#8217;d be no need for anyone or anything to
      fight to obtain one. He believed a thousand creatures could eat their fill
      without hassle, if that was true.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is only the vine&#8217;s root,&#8221; Moment Queen said
      coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Root? Since when do roots grows leaves and flowers?&#8221; Han Sen
      looked at her with an unconvinced face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen continued walking towards the vine, and as she went, she
      said, &#8220;This is the root of the Empty Vine. As we climb, you will
      eventually see the vine pierce through a floating island that rests above
      the sea of clouds. Above the island is the true body of the vine and the
      life it bears. The fruit will ripen soon, so we best hurry.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen nodded and followed Moment Queen over to the Empty Vine. The vine
      was like a fried dough twist, that extended all the way up to the clouds
      high above. It was wide enough to drive a truck up its side, presuming the
      truck did not answer to gravity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his Golden Growler and rode up, seeing as there was so
      much space.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was an interesting experience, and after climbing a few hundred meters,
      the view of the lands below was rather magnificent.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Moment, how long until the fruit ripens? Do you think the
      Devil-Blood King is here yet?&#8221; Han Sen enquired, as he ascended.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It should be ready in about two days, but it wouldn&#8217;t
      surprise me if the Devil-Blood King has already arrived and taken over the
      best vantage points on the floating island,&#8221; Moment Queen explained.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If there is another two days to go, what is the rush? Let us climb
      slowly.&#8221; While Han Sen said this, he suddenly heard a bird.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen turned and looked, and he saw a black-flame phoenix shoot through
      the clouds from the south.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the black-flame phoenix from the Black Desert? If
      that thing was willing to fly all this way here, I wonder how many other
      creatures are there up top?&#8221; Han Sen suddenly thought of something
      else, as well. &#8220;If the black-phoenix is here, I wonder if the green
      kirin is here, too?&#8221;
    </p>
