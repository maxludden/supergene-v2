    <p>
      Lately, Han Sen&#8217;s life had seemed to be going smoothly. He managed
      to collect a lot of taxes from people at the Blackgod Shelter,
      successfully commanded evolvers to hunt for him, and had been given the
      opportunity to visit the royal shelter as much as he pleased to train
      against his ultimate foe; the days had become relaxing and stress-free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s life was going well. Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s life was not
      going well. He had traveled 10,000 miles to the ice fields before noticing
      Han Sen was the current owner of the Blackgod Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang was not averse to crowds of people, but if he were to spook
      Han Sen away, that would be bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      So Xue Yi Kuang had been patiently waiting for his moment. He collected as
      much information on Han Sen as he could, before moving in to kill him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, Han Sen was leaving the Blackgod Shelter to go to the royal shelter
      and further train his Dual skill with the Twin Spirit. This time, however,
      as Han Sen was running across the ice fields, the silver fox raised its
      head in a peculiar manner. The hairs of its silver coat of fur stood on
      their ends and its drowsy eyes were perked and wide awake. The silver fox
      looked in the direction of a giant glacier not too far away from them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen patted the alerted silver fox&#8217;s head to calm it down, but he
      was aware of what it had been looking at. As he stroked the fox, Han Sen
      started looking at the nearby glacier.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Come on out, friend,&#8221; Han Sen gently called out.</p>

    <p>
      From behind the glacier, Xue Yi Kuang, who was clad in all-white clothing,
      emerged. His strong body was not something people were likely to forget,
      and his skin was transparent like ice. It was even more delicate than the
      skin of a woman. Combined with his grisly figure, it was a striking
      juxtaposition.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Xue Yi Kuang?&#8221; Han Sen frowned as he looked at him. At the
      exchange event, he caught sight of Xue Yi Kuang, but he had assumed that
      he lacked the high-profile his brother Xue Yi Yang did. He didn&#8217;t
      come on stage to give a speech, but nevertheless, Han Sen remembered him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang did not respond. He merely raised his fist and started
      running towards Han Sen. He was over ten meters away from Han Sen, but in
      one step, he had already appeared in front of him. Han Sen watched his
      crystal-like fist and observed the frosted aura that surrounded it.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned the silver-snake sword and brought it down on the
      incoming fist. Following the strike, Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s fist was not
      even bleeding. Han Sen took a few steps back, his sword ringing from the
      mighty slash as if it had been brought down on rock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang still did not say anything. His fists were like a blizzard,
      furiously thrashing towards Han Sen. Every punch was loaded with the power
      to kill a man, and the ferocity at which they were coming was frightening
      to witness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was holding two swords now, and he decided to put his Dual skill
      into action against his new nemesis. Rapidly, swords and fists repeatedly
      clashed against each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s icy fists were difficult to damage with a blade, and
      Han Sen&#8217;s swords continued to ring and cry with each strike. Han Sen
      was surprised and worried.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is everyone in the Xue family a madman? If a person has a
      difference of opinion, why not talk about the issue? Staying silent,
      raising fists, and seeking to kill is barbaric. This guy is freaking
      insane!&#8221; Han Sen did not have the time to talk, but these thoughts
      raced through his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s fisting skills were too cruel. Even with Han
      Sen&#8217;s level of sword skills, he was being suppressed. He had to rely
      on his Dongxue Sutra to keep up with Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s pace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang was a far better fighter than Xue Yi Yang. Han Sen was
      putting all his effort into the fight, but it was proving barely enough to
      keep him alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a blizzard passed through, Xue Yi Kuang fell back. The snowstorm
      disappeared as quickly as it appeared. Then, Xue Yi Kuang stood where he
      was and said, &#8220;You really are something. You are able to block my
      blizzard skill?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Xue Yi Kuang, I hold nothing against you. What is this all
      about?&#8221; Han Sen furrowed his brow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Pah! I don&#8217;t need a reason to kill anyone. If I want to kill,
      I will kill; it&#8217;s that simple.&#8221; Xue Yi Kuang looked at Han Sen
      with proud eyes. &#8220;But you, you really are something. You are strong
      enough to make me useJadeskin.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Jadeskin isn&#8217;t that great,&#8221; Han Sen spoke with a
      disdainful face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s eyes went cold. He laughed and slowly approached Han
      Sen. With every step, the frosty aura around him increased, his skin
      crystallized even further, and the endless chill that encompassed him grew
      thicker. He was looking more and more like an ice man.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now they stood three meters apart. Han Sen could already feel the cold air
      emanating from Xue Yi Kuang. Han Sen was surprised, wondering why
      theJadeskin that belonged to the Xue family could emit frosted air whereas
      his couldn&#8217;t.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang was getting closer and closer, and his entire image looked
      frozen. Han Sen imagined every cell of his foe&#8217;s being was now ice.
      He was like a veritable ice demon.
    </p>

    <p>
      But even though Han Sen was in the process of learning the sameJadeskin,
      he was actually starting to feel cold. He felt as if there was frost
      building up inside him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In this world, few evolvers can open their gene locks. Today, you
      should relish that which the tapestry of fortune has bestowed upon you;
      the opportunity of death by my first tier ofJadeskin.&#8221; Xue Yi
      Kuang&#8217;s eyes were so cold as he spoke. When he resumed his punching,
      it felt as if the air itself was going to solidify.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tried to take a step back, but the fist was too quick and he was
      unable to dodge it effectively. So, he used his Mascot Beast sword to
      fight back.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The fist collided with the sword, and a horrible force of icy power burst
      forth from Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s fist. Within a moment, the Mascot Beast
      sword was wholly consumed by ice, and as if it was a living parasite or
      infection, it frantically weaved a course down the sword to Han Sen
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s fingers were the first to feel the assault of this
      spiteful ice, and he could feel the pulsing of his blood slow down as if
      it were about to freeze.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was frightened, and he abandoned his sword to fall back.
      Unfortunately, his fingers remained numb, and they did not obey his
      wishes. It was like they did not belong to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was fortunate that he had learntJadeskin. Making use of it, the feel of
      his fingers returned and the fright of frostbite diminished.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s going on? Xue Yi Kuang has only learnt the first tier
      ofJadeskin, but that is what I have learnt, as well. How has he managed to
      open his first gene lock and unleash such power while I cannot?&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s face looked grave when he stared upon Xue Yi Kuang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang observed Han Sen&#8217;s fingers contact the ice of his power
      but was curious as to why they did not die. He lifted his eyebrows sharply
      and moved to attack Han Sen once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang had unlocked the first gene lock, and this provided a
      wholehearted boost to his power and speed, and particularly to the
      strength of his ice. His only limit was his body, since he couldn&#8217;t
      consume the whole power of the first gene lock. He couldn&#8217;t draw
      upon such energy from his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      If someone touched his body, they would be frostbitten; even a
      sacred-blood weapon, would be affected, such as Han Sen&#8217;s sword. The
      number of evolvers with such scary amounts of power was extremely low.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and his Snow-Lady then combined into one. His heart was beating
      like mad, and his kidneys were in hyperdrive for the formulation of
      energy. His legs had received an incredible boost to their speed, and Han
      Sen managed to bob and weave his way past every incoming fist.
    </p>

    <p>
      That day in the exchange event, Han Sen heard that a talented evolver
      could unlock their first gene lock before they became a surpasser. Because
      they lacked the correct fitness level required to fully unlock it, people
      like that were practically indestructible.
