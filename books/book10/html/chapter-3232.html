<p>When Han Sen went back to the Qin Kingdom and Feng family
castle, it was only four days later.</p>
<p>He heard that the Chu Kingdom’s border had a scary ice god pulse
manifest, and so the concept tempted him quite a bit.</p>
<p>His Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra were already able to
break the world. The Story of Genes could manifest Spell. He did
not need more power, but his Jadeskin was lacking. It required a
rare gene race to reverse the power of his body. The Chu Kingdom
had a super ice god pulse show up. Perhaps there was a chance of a
rare ice gene race showing up.</p>
<p>Jadeskin was not completely an ice element, but one ice gene
race for its body was likely enough. So, Han Sen wanted to go to
the ice fields.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “After Qin Xiu took control of the God Chaos
Party, the God Chaos Party has not tried to do anything
attention-drawing. I am afraid things will end up as God Hall
Leader said. He has not gained complete control of the black
crystal armor, and that is why he is worried. In these times,
nothing explicitly bad should happen.”</p>
<p>“Mister Han, the king wants you to go and visit him.” Before Han
Sen could move, Qin Jing Zhen’s officer arrived at the Feng family
castle to deliver a decree issued by the king.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it and decided on following the officer to
go and see the king.</p>
<p>When Wan’er was revived, Qin Jing Zhen ended up getting attacked
by her. The wounds he had received were quite bad. Han Sen had not
seen the king since that happened, so he was keen on learning about
what happened to the man.</p>
<p>When Han Sen next saw Qin Jing Zhen, he frowned.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen was a powerful elite. When he saw him, he was
totally fine. Upon seeing him now, he looked pale. His eyes looked
tired. It seemed as if he was still sick.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a closer look. He sighed and said, “I did not expect
Qin Jing Zhen’s wounds to be even worse than I thought. I am afraid
he will not live long.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen smiled. He pointed at the chair and said to Han
Sen, “Please sit, Mister Han.”</p>
<p>“My King, why have you sought me out?” Han Sen asked. With the
condition Qin Jing Zhen’s body was in, he was not going to be asked
there for a casual, mid-day chat.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen sighed and said, “Mister, you are a miracle man. I
am sure you can tell that I am going to die soon.”</p>
<p>“If you trust me, I can check your body over and maybe help you
out,” Han Sen said. “While I may not be able to save your life
forever, I can possibly make your life last a bit longer.”</p>
<p>In front of the Qin Kingdom’s king, other people would have
watched their words and spoke with great care. Han Sen, however,
was not that worried. “Please, Master,” Qin Jing Zhen said without
any doubt. On any other day, Qin Jing Zhen would not have let any
random person touch his body. This time was different.</p>
<p>The Qin Kingdom had many elites, but no one had been able to do
anything to alleviate his wounds. Even Jian Bu Gu said he could
only live for another year at the most. Qin Jing Zhen was not too
worried about his safety anymore.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen had saved Bai Qin inside the alpha temple and drew
Wan’er away. It made Qin Jing Zhen trust him a bit more. That was
why he was not so worried about letting him help now.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out his finger and placed it on Qin Jing Zhen’s
forehead. He was forced to use his Dongxuan Sutra’s power and
inject it into the ailing man’s body.</p>
<p>The structure of Qin Jing Zhen’s body went into Han Sen’s brain.
All of his cells were dyed with gold light.</p>
<p>The gold light was very bright. Although it was very weak, it
was hard to ignore its existence.</p>
<p>It was Wan’er’s power. It seemed to be very beautiful, but it
was a deadly thing to Qin Jing Zhen.</p>
<p>When the gold light corroded him, Qin Jing Zhen’s gene chains
had become gold. Now, 10% of his gene chains were gold. If this
kept going on, when it reached 30%, Qin Jing Zhen’s body would be
destroyed. He would be a dead man.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen had three powers. Suppressing the spread of the
gold light did not seem to work very well. It was hard to stop the
gold light completely in its tracks. According to the speed of the
gold light, Qin Jing Zhen really had less than a year to live.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled his finger back. He looked at Qin Jing Zhen and
frowned.</p>
<p>“I know my condition,” Qin Jing Zhen said. “You can tell me what
you think without beating around the bush. Be direct.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and said, “According to the examination I have
conducted on your body, if there is no other power to heal you, you
only have one more year to live.” “Teacher Jian said that too,” Qin
Jing Zhen said with a wry smile. “It looks like I really am going
to die this time.” Although he was a king, he could not face his
mortality. Qin Jing Zhen really did not want to die yet.</p>
<p>“Maybe not,” Han Sen said after a brief hesitation.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes immediately grew brighter. He looked at Han
Sen and asked, “Mister Han, do you have a way to fix my
wounds?”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen looked for Han Sen because he thought he now had
hope. This was his final hope. He had consulted with many others.
even the Annihilation God Spirits that protected the Qin family
were unable to do anything for the wounds Qin Jing Zhen had
sustained. Qin Jing Zhen had already given up, but Jian Bu Gu was
the one to suggest seeking out Han Sen and see if he could help him
out.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Han Sen said, “I am not sure I can
completely heal you, but I do have a way to extend your life for
about three to five years. In the time I can give you, perhaps a
more permanent solution can be found.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen developed a wry smile and said, “I would like to
live another three to five years. You might not believe me when I
tell you this, but I am not afraid of death. There is something I
do not want to leave behind unfinished.”</p>
<p>“Is this because of the crown prince?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, you really know me,” Qin Jing Zhen said with a
sigh. “The Qin Kingdom is the greatest kingdom in the universe. It
is very powerful. It is stronger than the other six kingdoms, but
it is also different from the other six kingdoms. The Qin Kingdom
is a kingdom founded on law. The king is the highest. Without a
king, other departments can continue to function. The country will
still operate, but my Bai son is still young. He still wants to
play. For a boy his age to run a country, it would be terrible. I
am afraid he will mess up the fate of the kingdom.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen said it clearly, and Han Sen understood what he
meant. If Qin Bai succeeded his father on the throne, someone might
steal his power and operate the boy like a puppet.</p>
<p>“The Qin Kingdom is in trouble. There are so many problems
facing us. I would like to live a few more years so I can give my
son a safe country.” Qin Jing Zhen looked at Han Sen seriously and
said, “Mister Han, no matter the price I must pay, please let me
live a few years longer. I do not want to die now.”</p>
<p>“I will do what I can. It will not be hard extending your life
for three to five years more, but any longer than that will be
dependent on your body.” Han Sen paused before saying, “The skills
I use will have their effect on you. To use this method, there is a
condition.”</p>
