<p>Han Sen went back to Time Sky. The sky clock had yet to return
to its ordinary shape. It still looked like a gravestone.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the sky clock and said, “The geno tablet
fights are going to start. Shouldn’t you go back to the geno tablet
and be a host now?”</p>
<p>The geno tablet’s voice sounded in Han Sen’s brain. It said,
“You underestimate me. This is just one of my clones. My real
spirit will remain in the geno tablet to host these events.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep possessing the sky clock?” Han Sen asked
with shock.</p>
<p>“If the 32nd sky has a leader, and you want your daughter to
join these fights by becoming a leader, it is only natural for a
trick to be performed,” the geno tablet said with a look of
disdain. “If I was not here, do you really think she could access
the geno tablet?”</p>
<p>“To be honest with you, I would prefer it if Bao’er did not
fight,” Han Sen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“What? Are you afraid of Qin Xiu beating Bao’er and doing harm
to you?” the geno tablet asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and said, “I just do not want to put my
daughter’s life at risk. If it is OK, I would like for these
matters to be resolved another way.”</p>
<p>“You can’t sort it out another way,” the geno tablet said. “The
evolution of your genes is not good enough. Nothing will work, even
if I let you try.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but the geno tablet quickly
said, “Other creatures are coming now. I do not want other
creatures to learn about my existence. You can do that
yourself.”</p>
<p>After that, the geno tablet, which was in its sky clock shape,
docked in Han Sen’s hand. Han Sen dropped it into one of his robe
pockets.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil approached Han Sen and said, “Now, it is your time
to make good on your promise.”</p>
<p>Han Sen pointed at the shining 33 skies and said, “The geno
tablet fight is about to start. Can I sort out your problem after
the fight?”</p>
<p>“Do not worry,” Ancient Devils said. “The 32nd sky has a leader.
The geno tablet fight won’t start for another 10 days. Over the
course of the next 10 days, any creature that comes to the 33 skies
can challenge the old leaders. If they win, they can become the new
leader. They will be permitted to join the geno tablet’s true
bout.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen thought he might be talking crap, but he was
actually saying this to the geno tablet. He wanted to know if the
geno tablet was telling him the truth or not.</p>
<p>“He is right,” the geno tablet answered.</p>
<p>“Ten days. That will give us enough time to do this. If things
go smoothly, we will only require a single day.” Ancient Devil
could not hear or see the geno tablet speak. He spoke directly to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil and asked, “Yeah, but can you
tell me what you want the sky clock for?”</p>
<p>“I can only tell you that I need the sky clock for the power it
has to reverse time,” Ancient Devil said. “I want to make an old
thing young again.”</p>
<p>“If things are truly that way, you can bring that thing to Time
Sky. When the time wheel spins, just pick a time area that has
reverse-spinning needles.” Han Sen could not believe this.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil shook his head. “If things were that easy, I would
not come to Time Sky. That thing is old and unique, so ordinary
powers cannot shift it. Only the reverse time powers of the sky
clock can make this thing younger, and that is only a possibility.
If it does not work, I will have no choice but to find another
way.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I will have to go with you.” Han Sen did not
reject him. He wanted to know what item Ancient Devil was going on
about.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did not object to the company. He left Time Sky
with Han Sen. They went back to the geno universe.</p>
<p>“Are you going to Outer Sky?” Han Sen was shocked. Ancient Devil
took him to a place where the Very High lived. That place was Outer
Sky.</p>
<p>Outer Sky had been claimed by many Break World beasts. Ordinary
creatures were unable to live there anymore. The whole of Outer Sky
had been mutated. It was a vastly different place from what it used
to be before.</p>
<p>Even Han Sen would not dare go into Outer Sky to hunt Break
World beasts.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil nodded and said, “Yes. This very old and unique
item resides in Outer Sky. If you can help me bring it back to
life, our grudge will be over.”</p>
<p>“I said that as long as it does not clash with my principles, I
will be willing to help you.” Han Sen paused for a bit, but he
resumed speaking by saying, “Outer Sky is a big place, and there
are Break World beasts absolutely everywhere. Even if I am not
afraid, this will be troublesome. I do not want to waste too much
time here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, the only reason I am bringing you here is that I
know where it is. I know a way that will take us to it. It will be
on that does not pose trouble.” Ancient Devil looked very
confident.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to follow Ancient Devil to Outer Sky. Ancient Devil
already knew how to get around. He traveled through the forest,
going around and around. The two of them walked for over half a day
without encountering a single beast.</p>
<p>“We are almost there. The thing I am talking about is there.”
Ancient Devil pointed to a spot as he spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a look. He was shocked by what he saw, so he asked,
“Isn’t that Mirror Lake? Is the thing you are talking about in
Mirror Lake?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Ancient Devil quickly confirmed this to be the case.</p>
<p>“Since we are already here, it is about time you tell me all
about what it is you are looking to do,” Han Sen said with a
frown.</p>
<p>“You will learn soon enough. Why are you always in such a rush?”
Ancient Devil still had not told Han Sen what it was about. He
walked over to Mirror Lake, but he was unsure of what he was
looking for.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Mirror Lake connected to the anti-material
world, which was practically the universe of kingdoms. He knew
Outer Sky and the universe of kingdoms had a large wedge between
them. That wedge was the 33 skies. It did not seem as if it would
be possible to fetch an item from the universe of kingdoms from
there.</p>
<p>Even if they were able to fish something up, the stuff in the
universe of kingdoms would be repelled by the geno universe. They
would prove themselves to be useless.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to use items from the geno universe in Mirror
Lake. He had been able to effectively use the Four-Sheep Cube. He
was able to use that quite a lot in the geno universe, and it could
also send people to the universe of kingdoms. That was a bit
scary.</p>
<p>“If Mirror Lake does not connect to the universe of kingdoms,
where does it truly connect to? What is this item Ancient Devil
keeps referring to?” Han Sen was guessing.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil intently peered into the lake’s mist. After a
while, he suddenly jumped in and went straight into the clouds of
Mirror Lake. He told Han Sen, “Follow behind me. Do not lose
me.”</p>
