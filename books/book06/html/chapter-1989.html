<h2>Who He Came Here For?</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1989</h3>

<p>On Sky Path Island, four different classes of people awaited
their exam: Barons, Viscounts, Earls, and Marquises.</p>
<p>The most popular section today would be the Earl examination.
Many Kings and Nobles had gone there, and the stands were very
full. It made the other three look so quiet.</p>
<p>Many Barons and Viscount students went there to watch the exam,
too. They went there for Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not afraid because no one took him seriously,
anyway. Aside from Yu Jing and the people that had made a bet with
him, no one would be anticipating the fight between Han Sen and
Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>When Lone Bamboo arrived, he was given the spotlight. People
kept talking about him, trying to guess why he wished to
participate in the exam. No one could guess the true reason
why.</p>
<p>Many people looked in Lone Bamboo’s direction, which made it
easy for Han Sen to get a glimpse of him, too. When he saw the
man’s face, he looked surprised. He said, “That guy is Lone
Bamboo?”</p>
<p>It was the arrogant man Han Sen had seen on the seventh floor of
the White Jade Building.</p>
<p>Seeing the match roster, Han Sen found that he was one round
behind Lone Bamboo. So, he sat on the sidelines to see what sort of
power Lone Bamboo wielded.</p>
<p>Sky Palace students were strong, so it was no wonder that they
were a famous high race. There were many strong representatives of
the race there, and they all had amazing geno arts.</p>
<p>Han Sen had fun spectating, but not long after, he saw Lone
Bamboo approach the arena.</p>
<p>It was not just Han Sen turning to take a look at Lone Bamboo.
Everyone else was, as well. One corner of the arena became the
center of attention for the entire place.</p>
<p>After a while, an Earl student from Sky Palace came to the
arena. He went straight up to Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>Everyone thought they could watch Lone Bamboo fight, but that
Earl student came before the man and just grabbed his hand. With
much excitement, he said, “Brother Lone Bamboo, I can finally see
you! I have been a fan ever since I was small.”</p>
<p>The supposed fight turned into a meet between a fan and their
greatest idol. After the Earl finished speaking, he forfeited the
fight and left.</p>
<p>“Damn! He can do that?” Han Sen felt depressed.</p>
<p>The people next to Han Sen were even more depressed. Many of
them were angry, even.</p>
<p>“That guy is too obscene! He knew he couldn’t compete against
Lone Bamboo. He did this just so he didn’t have to embarrass
himself.”</p>
<p>“It won’t go on like this, will it? With no one daring to fight
him?’</p>
<p>“It is hard to say. Everyone knows Lone Bamboo’s strength. It
does not matter if they fight or not, but perhaps someone arrogant
enough will think they have the chops to challenge him.”</p>
<p>“Brother Lone Bamboo is so smart. He does not have to fight, and
yet he can still win.”</p>
<p>Not much later, it was Han Sen’s turn for a reveal. He went
towards the arena, but he did not draw much attention. Only a few
people who knew Han Sen, or those that knew he got carried to Sky
Palace, bothered to take a look.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s opponent was called Cool Jade. He was quite good
amongst the Earls, but there were many good ones like that all
across Sky Palace. Being decidedly average, he wasn’t very
well-renown.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi could not help but watch Han Sen’s fight. Yu Jing had
not dared show himself, as he was afraid he’d bump into the guys he
had made the gambit with. If he went, he believed he’d be laughed
at.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi just sat down, and she heard a few men talking.</p>
<p>“Since I’m so bored, I might as well see how strong this Han Sen
is. Yu Jing sure compliments him enough.”</p>
<p>“It does not matter how strong he is. He’s going to lose to Lone
Bamboo, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that just yet. Maybe he will be killed before he even
meets Lone Bamboo!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, haha.”</p>
<p>The few were chatting amongst each other, and it made Yun Suyi
frown. When she was about to confront those voices, someone
suddenly approached and sat down next to her.</p>
<p>“Brother Lone Bamboo?” After Yun Suyi saw who the person was,
she was shocked.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Lone Bamboo, and they were all shocked, too.
Many women looked at him with the most charming faces.</p>
<p>“Why is Lone Bamboo here? Who is he watching?”</p>
<p>“There is nothing worthy of his focus here, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course there isn’t. None of the Earls here are worthy of his
spectating.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he is here to watch a friend?”</p>
<p>“That is possible.”</p>
<p>“Would it be for Yun Suyi?”</p>
<p>“That is possible, too. Yun Suyi’s prettiness and talent are
unequaled across all of Sky Palace. She wouldn’t be an
embarrassment for Lone Bamboo.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi, hearing that, frowned again. She looked at Lone
Bamboo, and he looked down at the arena without any emotion.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi’s heart jumped, and she thought to herself, “Is Lone
Bamboo here for Han Sen?”</p>
<p>There were many fights going on in the arena, and they were all
going on at the same time. It was difficult to determine who he was
watching.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt the stare coming from Lone Bamboo, though. Han Sen
turned to take a look, and he saw Lone Bamboo looking at him. He
thought to himself, “Why is he watching me?”</p>
<p>Cool Jade pulled out his longsword and swung it at Han Sen. The
swordlight possessed a purple mist, and it seemed strong enough to
sunder the ceiling.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned Spell next to him, and he fired his pistols at
Cool Jade.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>The munitions were continuously expelled, and Cool Jade’s
longsword kept swinging around with its purple mist. It blocked a
few bullets, but more hit his body and armor. He flew out of the
ring and conceded defeat.</p>
<p>“Damn! What is that thing? Is that a geno armament?”</p>
<p>“It looks very strong.”</p>
<p>“A geno armament like that is better to watch than the fight
itself.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s victory didn’t draw much attention, ultimately. Some
students were interested in Spell, more than Han Sen himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen put Spell away and left the arena.</p>
<p>Everyone looked back to where Lone Bamboo had been, and they
noticed he had vanished. Yun Suyi, who had been next to him, was
gone, too.</p>
<p>Now people knew they had guessed it right. He had gone there for
Yun Suyi.</p>
