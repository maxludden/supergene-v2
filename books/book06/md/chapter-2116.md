Han Sen didn’t get to see Littleflower fight, so he went to watch others fight instead.

Of the Marquises, he managed to watch Dragon Eight and Lone Bamboo fight. Han Sen wanted to see Evil Eye fight, but he soon learned that all of Evil Eye’s opponents gave up whenever they were pitted against him. No one wished to battle someone that frightening.

Han Sen thought he wouldn’t get to see Evil Eye fighting that day, but much to his surprise, he did. That day, a creature was brave or foolish enough to stay and fight.

That creature had three heads and six arms. It looked like a demon wearing silver armor. Its two lower hands gripped rods, while its other four arms wielded a knife, a sword, an ax, and a stick individually. Each of the beast’s heads was unique. The middle head was that of a bird, while the other two bore demonic faces. The left looked female, whereas the right two looked male. The three heads looked as if they could talk to each other, as well.

The weapons in the creature’s six hands were shining brilliantly against Evil Eye.

The lights were strange, and each sheen was of a different color. It looked like it wielded a variety of different powers. The rod was wood. The knife was gold. The sword was water. The ax was fire. The stick was earth. All five weapons were unleashing light together. It looked as if they worked together in a formation, and when the five powers gathered up, the attack power was given a boost.

Han Sen thought that when the five powers combined, they’d be as strong as his body.

“There are many hidden elites scattered throughout this universe. One elite can combine all these powers? Judging from all of these skills and abilities, there is no doubt he is one of the greatest Marquises out there. That power he has combined is almost as great as my power,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Han Sen looked at the three-headed, six-armed creature’s slip of paper. It said, “Destroyed – Rage Man.” Han Sen realized Destroyed was one of the top five races in the geno hall. That was why this being was so strong.

Han Sen looked at Rage Man’s opponent. He was wearing a purple and white set of armor. The purple bone flowers on the armor were raised from its surface. Han Sen couldn’t see his face, but his body was shaped like a human’s. After being reborn this time, no one knew what race Evil Eye belonged to.

When Rage Man attacked, Evil Eye didn’t fight, but he traveled through the bushes around him like the wind. Rage Man made full use of his power, but he still could not touch Evil Eye.

“Evil Eye, are you merely going to keep dodging?” Rage Man suddenly stopped. His six eyes stared at Evil Eye with a smile.

Evil Eye stood where he was, and when he replied, his voice was toneless. “You are the first creature that has dared to fight me. For that, I will spare your life.”

“The others might be scared of you, but I am not. You can say something like this when I let you survive.” Rage Man looked very angry, and his weapons rattled in his hands.

Around Evil Eye, many lights formed. Five different colors blended together to become one singular albeit giant light. The light trapped Evil Eye in its beam. Power burst out of Rage Man as he tried to squeeze and condense the light around his opponent. He was trying to kill Evil Eye.

Han Sen was surprised. Rage Man’s light skill was similar to Han Sen’s knife silks.

Han Sen’s knife silks could be cast whenever, but Rage Man needed five elements to create his prison. That meant his skill had a restriction, compared to Han Sen’s knife silks that could be used whenever.

Seeing Rage Man able to use power like that, Han Sen knew he was a special person.

“Where are you going to hide now?” Rage Man shouted. The five lights tightened around his enemy, and it looked likely to mince Evil Eye’s body into tiny bits.

Evil Eye was still in the light. He lifted his right hand to press against the light. The people watching expected an amazing fight to unfold. But when Evil Eye’s hand touched the light, the light shattered. The formation of light became a mess of simple beams. It was like a vortex existed on Evil Eye’s hand, pulling them in casually.

Evil Eye collected all those lights in his hand, until a baseball-sized orb of light gathered on his palm. The light looked scarier than it had earlier, like some sort of bomb.

“This… impossible…” Rage Man stuttered. His hardest attack with five elemental powers had been unable to do a speck of damage to Evil Eye. Evil Eye broke it and confiscated the power for himself.

Evil Eye threw the colorful orb of light at Rage Man. It looked like a basic, casual lob, but the light orb warped space as it stormed toward Rage Man. It didn’t even leave Rage Man an opening to dodge.

Rage Man roared. He used his five weapons to gather up another orb of light and fired this newly-created orb back at the light orb that was currently on its way to him.

*Boom!*

Rage Man had done his absolute best to gather up all his power and strike the other light orb with the new one. The two airborne orbs of light exploded as they collided.

Argh!

The results weren’t good for Rage Man, as each of his weapons was immediately destroyed in the chaotic power unleashed against him. Furthermore, his armor shattered, and every single item he was currently carrying was destroyed in the blink of an eye.

However, the strangest thing about all of this was that Rage Man was not injured. Even after he screamed for what he thought would be the last time, he turned out to be fine.

That scary power had only broken his armor and weapons. Every item he possessed was destroyed, but he himself was not injured. He didn’t even have a single singed hair.

Rage Man screamed because he thought he was going to die. He was not injured, and so he just stood where he was. With his mouth agape, his face turned green. He looked embarrassed.

“I told you I wasn’t going to kill you,” Evil Eye said.

Rage Man’s three faces turned green and red. He ripped apart his paper and left the Geno Being Scroll.

“Evil Eye really is Evil Eye! The elite from Destroyed was like a baby before him. They weren’t on the same level.”

“He used Rage Man’s power to defeat him, and somehow managed to do it without hurting him. Evil Eye controls his power like a god.”

“He is supposed to be deified. I don’t know how many times he has been.”

“It looks like there are no others likely to become number one in the Marquise rankings. Rage Man is just as good as Dragon Eight and Lone Bamboo, but if even he was that useless against Evil Eye, no other Marquise stands a chance of beating him.”

“It looks like the occupant for number one is settled.”

“Evil Eye, what a scary man.”

The people that watched the fight were in shock. They greatly admired Evil Eye. He was too good for the others to even be jealous of his talents.
