	<p>Dou Tian Yu’s Jade Demon Punch was so evil and overbearing because a God Spirit Blood-Pulse was an exclusive gene
		race. The power it was able to cast was more normal than an ordinary god-class gene race.</p>

	<p>No matter how overbearing and cruel he was, he was blocked by the red punches. He could not get close to the
		room.</p>

	<p>Everybody was shocked. Dou Tian Yu and the other god-blood nobles used all their powers to attack, but they were
		still blocked outside the door. They were unable to imagine how powerful Han Sen was.</p>

	<p>“Interesting,” Mister God One said. He was standing far away, watching Dou Tian Yu and the red fists fighting. He
		was intrigued.</p>

	<p>Si Tu Ya was shocked. The stronger Han Sen was, the higher the chance to erase the gene race power that was
		claiming Feng Fei Fei’s life. To her, this was terrible news.</p>

	<p>In the room, Han Sen’s purple dragon air and red power were combined into one. He waved one fist to block Dou
		Tian Yu outside the door. Another hand was inside the skin of Feng Fei Fei’s chest. He was pulling out the
		copper wires from her chest.</p>

	<p>All of those copper wires were being pulled out, one by one. The lotus shadow beneath the skin was becoming dim.
		Feng Fei Fei’s red eyes grew dimmer. A bit of clarity returned to her mind.</p>

	<p>“What is he doing?” Feng Fei Fei started to wake up. Her body was surrounded by purple and red lights. Han Sen
		was like a demon god. She was extremely shocked.</p>

	<p>When she realized what was happening, she was even more shocked.</p>

	<p>“A god-blood noble… He is a god-blood noble…” Feng Fei Fei witnessed Han Sen reaching out a fist full of light.
		It kept Dou Tian Yu at bay outside the door. He did not even look at the door. His eyes were observing her chest
		the entire time.</p>

	<p>“Chest.” When Feng Fei Fei thought of that, she blushed. She saw the bronze wires in front of her chest and knew
		he was trying to save her life.</p>

	<p>She felt shy and even more amazed. Han Sen used one hand to keep an elite like Dou Tian Yu at bay and outside the
		door. On top of that, he still had the power to fix the scary and weird power that was trying to claim her life.
		Despite all that, he was doing totally fine. He probably had even more power. That was scary and hard to
		imagine.</p>

	<p>“Who is he? How did he become Little Yin’s friend?” Feng Fei Fei felt very conflicted. Her pretty eyes looked
		weird.</p>

	<p>Outside the door, Dou Tian Yu summoned a God Spirit combination. He put his God Spirit Blood-Pulse to operate at
		max capacity. It made his entire body look like a reborn God Spirit. He glowed with powerful god light. Every
		punch seemed as if it carried a power that could destroy the sky and earth.</p>

	<p>Even so, he was unable to enter the room. It shocked everyone. All they could do was stand back and watch.</p>

	<p>“What is Han Sen? Who is he? How is he able to fight a god-blood noble? Is he a god-blood noble too?”</p>

	<p>“No way. I never heard of a god-blood noble named Han before.”</p>

	<p>“If he is not a god-blood noble, how else is he able to challenge Dou Tian Yu, who has combined with a God
		Spirit?”</p>

	<p>“Whatever happened today has been way too weird. Han Sen is too mysterious.”</p>

	<p>Feng Fei Fei’s voice came from the room. “Little Mister, please stop. Han Sen is helping me with the wound. He
		means no harm. Please, everyone, wait outside. Wait until I am mostly healed, and I will thank everyone again.”
	</p>

	<p>After hearing her voice, Feng Yin Yin was very happy. “Auntie, are you better?”.</p>

	<p>“Little Yin, do not worry. Han Sen is healing me. I should be fine soon.” Feng Fei Fei’s voice came out from the
		room again.</p>

	<p>After she said that, everyone was even more shocked. Han Sen was fighting the Dou Tian Yu and healing Feng Fei
		Fei at the same time. That was unbelievable.</p>

	<p>After hearing all of that, Dou Tian Yu frowned. His eyes burned with a god light, but he did not strike again.
	</p>

	<p>“Mister Han, you are very good. Today is not a good day to fight. Let’s fight another day.” Dou Tian Yu looked at
		the door, turned around, and departed.</p>

	<p>This fight made Han Sen’s name become famous across Jade Wall City. It was not too far-reaching, but it did have
		many superior people feel slightly worried.</p>

	<p>Of course, that was because not many people witnessed all of this with their own two eyes. Whoever heard about
		this thought the rumors had been blown out of proportion and most of it had been made up. Even with a blood
		ghost spirit, he could not have healed Feng Fei Fei and keep the god-blood noble Dou Tian Yu at bay.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen had also given away a mutant eight sound bug egg. He had a Holy Wen White Deer and a blood ghost
		spirit. People were very curious about the identity of that individual, and they made sure to peruse the stock
		in his store. They wanted to see what other gene races Han Sen’s shop sold.</p>

	<p>The results disappointed them. Han Sen’s shop had mutant eight sound bugs for sale, but the prices were too high.
		They were not worth the money they were priced at. Aside from that, there were just some viscount- and
		earl-class gene races. They were rare, but they were not really good stuff. Some strange people bought some rare
		gene eggs from the shop.</p>

	<p>In Gong Shu Manor, Gong Shu Zhi was frozen. He saw the si ming demon race, which looked like Feng Fei Fei,
		releasing black smoke. Suddenly, it no longer resembled Feng Fei Fei. It looked like a faceless bronze statue.
		Gong Shu Zhi’s body shook. He coughed out blood. “Impossible… That is impossible… Who destroyed the si ming
		demon race power?” Gong Shu Zhi’s eyes were full of shock.</p>

	<p>“Master, are you OK?” The old servant picked up Gong Shu Zhi.</p>

	<p>“I am fine. Go and get Si Tu Ya. Ask her what happened.” Gong Shu Zhi pushed the servant away. He gave the order
		in a fit of rage.</p>

	<p>After he said that, Si Tu Ya, who had messy hair and a lot of blood on her face, rushed in. She asked, “Mister,
		is your si ming demon race broken?”</p>

	<p>“What did that bitch Feng Fei Fei do?” Gong Shu Zhi madly asked.</p>

	<p>Si Tu Ya’s face looked like soil. She knew Gong Shu Zhi’s si ming demon race was broken. She told him about Han
		Sen being able to fight Dou Tian Yu while healing Feng Fei Fei at the same time.</p>

	<p>She did not stay and watch Feng Fei Fei come out. In a panic, she ran straight to Gong Shu Zhi.</p>

	<p>Gong Shu Zhi’s expression changed. “Does Han Sen have such power?”</p>

	<p>“Mister, what do we do now?” Si Tu Ya quickly asked. “Feng Fei Fei will not let this go.”</p>

	<p>Gong Shu Zhi’s face kept contorting. A while later, he said, “Do not worry. I have a way for them to be killed
		and not be brought back.”</p>

	<p>“What way is that?” Si Tu Ya asked.</p>

	<p>“Mister Mu always wanted my si ming demon race and a few other gene races. I did not want to make the trade, but
		I have to do it this time.” Gong Shu Zhi had a look of murder in his eyes as he said, “My son is dead. It is
		pointless for me to hold onto these gene races. If Mister Mu can help us, those two assholes will die.”</p>

	<p>“This Mister Mu you speak of, is he the mister that guards Ice Snow God Temple?” Si Tu Ya was shocked and happy.
	</p>

	<p>Gong Shu Zhi said gnashed his teeth and said, “Yes. Regardless if he can beat Dou Tian Yu, against Mister Mu, he
		will die.”</p>
