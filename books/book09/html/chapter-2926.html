<h2>Dog Hybrid</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2926</h3>

<p>The dog-faced man coldly grunted. He took two steps back. He
went behind the stone pillar. There were 10,000 red scale lights
landing on the door. The broken pillar next to the door had a space
swirl generate. The red scale lights landed on it, and it vanished.
It was like it had absorbed the door.</p>
<p>“Very good Sacred. The door is broken and only two pillars
remain, but it can still hold firm against an attack delivered by a
true god creature. It is no wonder why they were the scariest
existence in the universe.” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>The dog-faced man stood behind the stone pillar. While the big
goldfish power was absorbed by the door, he quickly fired another
two arrows. He rapidly fired at the goldfish family.</p>
<p>The big goldfish fired a barrage of bubbles. He did it to
prohibit the flight of the two arrows. The two teeth arrows were
still able to pierce the bubbles and not get caught by them.</p>
<p>The big goldfish was shocked and angry, but it was too late for
it to block.</p>
<p>The big goldfish moved and dodged the two teeth arrows. The
little goldfish was not able to move so quickly. It was going to be
shot in the head.</p>
<p>The teeth arrows were able to damage the big goldfish, but the
little goldfish was only larva class. The arrow was going to pierce
through its head and body.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Seeing the teeth arrow was going to perforate the head of the
small goldfish, a knife suddenly slashed against the teeth arrow.
The teeth arrow flew away. The small goldfish went behind the big
goldfish.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the cause karma knife. He was just standing
there looking at the dog-faced man. He asked, “What is your name?
Who from Sacred are you?”</p>
<p>The dog-faced man should have been a xenogeneic, as well as true
god class. He must have been quite famous in the Sacred
leagues.</p>
<p>“You are just a crystallizer, a servant of Sacred, yet you don’t
know my name.” The dog-faced man grabbed the teeth arrow that had
flown back. His eyes looked very evil. He drew the bowstring again
and aimed at Han Sen.</p>
<p>When the bowstring was pulled, Han Sen felt a huge amount of
power go into that draw. It made people feel very scared. It was
like some toxic snake was ready to launch itself at any second.</p>
<p>As Han Sen stared at the bow, he thought, “This dog-faced man’s
power is average for a true god. He is not as strong as me, but his
bow is a bit weird.”</p>
<p>The dog-faced man smiled. The teeth arrow in his hands was
launched. The teeth arrow disappeared in space. It was like it
could teleport through space to land on Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Ha! You have a death wish.” Upon seeing Han Sen get shot, the
dog-faced man let out a cruel laugh.</p>
<p>In the next second, the dog-faced man saw Han Sen appear in
front of him. The area on Han Sen’s body that had been hit with the
arrow was fading.</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>Han Sen slapped the dog-faced man in the face. The dog-faced man
went flying back against the stone pillar. Han Sen took his bow
away.</p>
<p>“You are very cheap, and your arrow skills are bad. Let me teach
you how to really use a bow.” Han Sen was holding the bow. He
pulled the string back and aimed at the dog-faced man, who was
stumbling back onto his feet and crawling closer.</p>
<p>The dog-faced man wanted to shout so badly, but he saw the arrow
was being aimed at him. He was shocked. The cold sweat that had
developed on his brow was starting to soak his entire body. It was
like someone was strangling him, making it difficult to
breathe.</p>
<p>The dog-faced man had a weird feeling. He felt that if he moved
an inch, the teeth arrow was going to break his brain. So, the
dog-faced man stood where he was and did not dare to move. He
continued to sweat.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? He is just a crystallizer servant… How is
he so powerful…” The dog-faced man was sweating profusely, but he
did not move. He was shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen was getting ready to shoot the dog-faced man when he
suddenly felt the teleporter move. He saw a few people appear at
the teleporter. It was Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the
others.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was shocked to see Han Sen there. They
had not stopped in their journey and had traveled at a blistering
pace. Yet, Han Sen had already reached the Sacred ruin before
them.</p>
<p>Upon seeing more creatures appear, the big goldfish swam toward
Han Sen with the little goldfish. He was looking at them.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster looked at Han Sen and the big
goldfish. He then glanced at the dog-faced man with a bow aiming
right at him. He smiled as he asked, “Han Godfather, what is the
situation here?”</p>
<p>Han Sen said, “I do not know what this xenogeneic is. He was
hiding behind the pillar firing arrows. Give me a minute,
Grandmaster. Let me get rid of this xenogeneic, and I will talk to
you.”</p>
<p>“You are just a crystallizer servant,” the dog-faced man said
while gnashing his teeth. “How dare you say that! If you dare touch
me, my mother will kill you so badly that you won’t even have a
body left to bury.”</p>
<p>“Oh, and who is your mother?” Han Sen looked at the dog-faced
man.</p>
<p>The dog-faced man gnashed his teeth and said, “My mother is Moon
Shadow God. If you touch me, she will rip you to shreds.”</p>
<p>“Moon Shadow God? Does someone like that belong in Sacred? I
have never heard of them before.” Han Sen had a long think about
it. Out of the 10 generals and four Sacred beasts, there was no one
with that name.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster looked surprised. He looked at the
dog-faced man and asked, “Is your mother Moon Shadow God?”</p>
<p>“Yes. My mother is Moon Shadow God. My name is Qige. If you know
how powerful my mother is, then give me back the Dog Crow Bow.
Otherwise, you are all dead.” For someone to know his mother’s
name, it made the dog-faced man very cocky.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. He was not afraid
of anyone. He just wanted to know who Moon Shadow God was.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster smiled and spoke to Han Sen. “Haven’t
you heard about Moon Shadow God? You must have surely heard about
Crow Sky Dog.”</p>
<p>“One of Sacred’s 10 generals?” Han Sen asked. “He is the one
called Crow Sky Dog.”</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster looked at Qige as he said, “Yes. Crow
Sky God was one of Sacred’s generals who guarded the door. Moon
Shadow God was his wife. He was a true god xenogeneic, but they
were not of the same race. Judging from this guy’s face, he does
look like Crow Sky Dog and Moon Shadow God’s hybrid child.”</p>
<p>“You are right. He is the dog hybrid from Crow Sky Dog and Moon
Shadow God.” A voice came out from Sacred’s door. Someone soon
walked out.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, and all the others looked
towards there. They saw the person walk out of the dark. He was
wearing a gold robe. He had white hair and a white beard. He was an
old man, but his bones were very strong. He looked very powerful.
Although he was walking alone, he seemed like a king coming forth.
He was so powerful that one could not describe it.</p>
<p>“Nine Thousand King.” When Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and a few
of the Extreme King deified elite saw the gold-robed elder, their
expressions changed. One of the deified elites screamed.</p>
<p>“I did not expect that in this universe, there are some who
still remember me,” Nine Thousand King coldly said.</p>
