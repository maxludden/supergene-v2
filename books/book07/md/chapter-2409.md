“A very powerful sword.” Han Sen lowered his head and stared at his fist. Despite being imbued with Move Mountain Area, the armor covering his fist had been sliced clean through. His fingers were bleeding. He was just thankful that the bones were undamaged.

The Sword from the Furnace came to strike a second time, but this strike was going to be harder than the last one. The sword moved so fast that Han Sen could barely follow it with his eyes.

Katcha!

Han Sen grabbed the blade of the Sword from the Furnace, which drew more streams of blood from his hands. He kept gripping the blade, though.

The Sword from the Furnace shook as if it was trying to move forward, but Han Sen held on tight and kept the blade still.

The copper furnace’s fire blazed higher. The fire area covered everything again. The Sword from the Furnace absorbed that fire, and the sword grew even more transparent. Its power increased, and it thrust toward Han Sen’s heart again.

The blade sliced deeper into Han Sen’s hands. Blood spilled around the sharp edges of the sword, but even still, Han Sen refused to let go. He resettled his grip on the sword, tightening his hands as he tried to force back the Sword from the Furnace.

The tip of the Sword from the Furnace almost touched Han Sen’s chest. The green crystal blade looked like a venomous snake as it shook and writhed in Han Sen’s hands. It was trying to strike at his heart, but its movements had been restricted.

The copper furnace was rising, drawing in energy from the galaxy all around it as it went. The fire burned higher and hotter. The bronze fire area encompassed everything again.

The Sword from the Furnace absorbed a fire area, and it received a godly boost of power. It unleashed a level of strength that was hard to imagine. It slid forward through Han Sen’s hands, unstoppable.

Katcha!

The sword began slicing through the armor on Han Sen’s chest. He kept trying to push the fierce blade back, but he couldn’t. Blood was now pouring from Han Sen’s hands, and it was only a matter of time before it started cutting into his finger bones.

The blade had sunk five centimeters into Han Sen’s chest at this point, and it was about to touch his heart.

The copper furnace was dancing happily. The fire within it was doing a jig, and the flames took on the shape of a smiling emoji that stared right at Han Sen.

“You are really strong, but this has got to stop,” Han Sen said to the copper furnace, his hands still holding the blade.

The Sword from the Furnace was very strong, but after those first few attacks, the scary power had moved into the Dongxuan Armor. It wouldn’t be as easy for the Sword from the Furnace to pierce through the Dongxuan Armor now.

Katcha!

Han Sen summoned his strength and pushed against the Sword from the Furnace. His grip on the blade should have been tenuous at best, but no matter how much the sword tried to struggle, it couldn’t break free from Han Sen’s clasp.

The copper furnace’s fire blazed furiously again and released another fire area.

The fire area wasn’t dangerous by itself, but it buffed the Sword from the Furnace an alarming amount. Every time the fire area appeared, it made the Sword from the Furnace much stronger. And that buffing capability appeared to be limitless.

Because the Sword from the Furnace grew stronger every time, that meant that the area effect was stackable.

This stackable area was the first Han Sen had seen.

Han Sen’s eyes hardened as he grabbed the Sword from the Furnace. He pulled the sword out of his chest as the fire area suddenly disappeared. Aside from the small fire that still flickered within the copper furnace, there were no other sparks.

Han Sen had been running his Dongxuan Area at max power. It forced the copper furnace’s universal self-cogwheel to stop, extinguishing the fire area.

The copper furnace was shivering. The cogwheels inside the furnace were spinning very quickly, trying to draw enough energy from the space around it to fuel the fire area again. But no matter how fast they spun, the creature couldn’t ignore its area power. It was like trying to strike a wet match.

Unless the opponent was stronger than Han Sen, the Dongxuan Area would force them to use their universal self-cogwheel. If they didn’t, they would have no power inside the Dongxuan Area.

The copper furnace itself wasn’t too strong. It was just a second or third-tier King xenogeneic. But its fire area, when used in concert with the Sword from the Furnace, had incredible power. After a few buffs, the Sword from the Furnace was at least as good as a half-deified being. This was the first time Han Sen had seen this type of xenogeneic.

The copper furnace wanted to spit out some more fire, but no matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t even generate a plume of smoke.

“It’s my turn now.” Holding the Sword from the Furnace in one hand, Han Sen lifted his Core Demon Bug Gun in the other. He fired at the copper furnace like a madman.

Because of the Move Mountain Area, Han Sen’s movement speed was slow. There was no way that he could have attacked the copper furnace by hand at this point, but the Core Demon Bug Gun’s firing speed was unchanged.

Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!

The purple and red beam crashed into the copper furnace, and the creature was sent flying. The furnace collected dents all over its surface as it bounced through the asteroid field.

“Why is this guy so hard?” Han Sen was stunned. He had used his Core Demon Bug Gun to shoot at it for ages. He covered the copper furnace with dents and dings, but he was unable to break it, and the consuming power couldn’t latch onto his enemy.

The copper furnace looked to be in bad shape, but it had only taken minor injuries. It hadn’t sustained any serious harm.

“A third or fourth-tier King xenogeneic has such a weird area? And its body is so hard. This is very strange.” Han Sen frowned.

But Han Sen had come too far to let things go now. He kept using his Core Demon Bug Gun to shoot at the copper furnace, resolving to shoot the thing as much as he needed to in order to break it.

Han Sen’s precise shots continued nailing the furnace. The creature was still flying, but rather than trying to get away from Han Sen, it was coming closer.

The furnace jerked forward like it was riding a rollercoaster in space. The Sword from the Furnace kept struggling within Han Sen’s hand, but it couldn’t shake him loose.

Pang!

Finally, after Han Sen had been shooting for what seemed like forever, one side of the copper furnace took a little too much damage. The purple and red light blew a fist-sized hole in the surface.

The hole wasn’t large, but Han Sen felt instantly relieved. The size wasn’t a problem. If he could pierce it, then he could destroy it.

Han Sen planned to keep on firing, but the copper furnace began to make wheezing, crying sounds. The Dongxuan Area was still locking down all the cogwheels in the nearby space, and no matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t create any more fire areas.

Suddenly, Han Sen heard a deafening metallic shriek. This sound wasn’t coming from the copper furnace, though.

Han Sen raised his head. He turned and saw a giant copper furnace coming toward him. It was as big as a planet, and thousands of swords circled it like a raging river. Every sword looked like the Sword from the Furnace in Han Sen’s hand. They burned with a weird green fire that looked somehow crystalline. As far as Han Sen could see, the galaxy was covered in a stream of swords, and the world became a sea of flashing blades.
