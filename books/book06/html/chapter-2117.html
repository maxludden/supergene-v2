<h2>Fighting Dragon Eigh</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2117</h3>

<p>After having witnessed Evil Eye and Rage Man’s battle, Han Sen
was in shock. It was primarily due to the manner in which Evil Eye
won the fight. Rage Man’s bolt of power had been a combination of
five different elemental energies, and Evil Eye broke it in a way
that was hauntingly reminiscent of Super Spank. The strike had
eliminated the sequence structure of the opponent’s technique and
then gone even further to rebuild it.</p>
<p>“Evil Eye has a power that is extremely similar to the Dongxuan
Sutra. He re御 will be a difficult foe to deal with.” Han Sen
frowned.</p>
<p>He couldn’t learn too much from the fight, though. Someone like
Rage Man couldn’t push Evil Eye hard enough to show what his true
capabilities were.</p>
<p>“We’re going to need someone like Lone Bamboo to go up against
Evil Eye.” Han Sen perused the list to see if that could happen,
but ended up finding an unfortunate factoid. If he and Evil Eye
kept winning their fights, Han Sen would encounter Evil Eye before
Lone Bamboo would. Han Sen wouldn’t be able to watch Lone Bamboo go
up against Evil Eye unless he himself lost to Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>And before he encountered Lone Bamboo, he’d have to deal with
Dragon Eight. He was one of Han Sen’s next opponents.</p>
<p>“This schedule is very bad. Why are all these big baddies being
pitted against me?” Han Sen felt his depression rise. He was not
afraid of his opponents, but he did not want to put too much effort
into winning the competition.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at another tier’s round of bouts. He saw Xie Qing
King doing well with the Earls. But then his heart jumped as he
read Xie Qing King’s name.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King had only put the name Xie Qing down. He hadn’t
written down his race. Han Sen kept scrolling through the Earl list
in worry, but after seeing everyone’s name, he was brought a
modicum of relief. Gu Qingcheng hadn’t written down her name, so
perhaps she had not participated.</p>
<p>If she had joined, with her race being identified as a human,
that would not bode well. There was every chance that the renegade
god would want to hunt her down.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly called Zero. He was afraid their communications
might be monitored, and that was why he didn’t contact Planet
Eclipse directly. With so much going on right now, he’d forgotten
all about this.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Zero about his talk with God’s Retribution. He then
asked Zero to get in touch with Gu Qingcheng and the others, to
inform them not to mention anything about humans that hailed from
the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Han Sen had said this before, but to be safe, he thought it was
best to remind them again.</p>
<p>Zero thought that Xie Qing King was their only companion who had
joined the fights. Not many people liked to participate in bouts
that didn’t offer many benefits. Only Xie Qing King, who loved a
good fight, had joined.</p>
<p>After Han Sen finished a quick fight, he went to watch Xie Qing
King’s combat. Xie Qing King’s geno armament let him draw his
opponent, so he could stand by and watch the enemy fight its own
shadow clone. He did this often, and whenever the enemy was winded
or tired, he would swoop in to finish them with a punch. It was
quite a shocking performance he kept giving, especially for an
Earl.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Yisha fighting, too. That woman was far too violent,
he thought. Her Teeth powers were enough to make the mightiest of
Kings run away. She hadn’t yet encountered anyone half-deified,
though. But at least ordinary Kings wouldn’t be able to defeat
her.</p>
<p>But Han Sen hadn’t managed to see Littleflower, and this boy was
the one person he wished to watch more than any other.
Littleflower’s legacy-building was an ongoing thing, but perhaps it
was because he had yet to fight a strong foe. Perhaps that was the
whole reason he had proven unbeatable thus far.</p>
<p>“My next fight is versus Dragon Eight. I hope it won’t cause me
too much trouble.” Han Sen wasn’t interested in prolonged fights.
He just wanted to get through each engagement as easily as
possible.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fight with Dragon Eight had drawn quite the crowd,
though. Not many people had focused on his last few fights, but
this time, he was going up against the infamous Dragon Eight. Many
races had been investigating Dragon Eight, to gain an advantage in
the rankings for themselves or their heirs. Their focus was always
on Dragon Eight, of course.</p>
<p>Han Sen drew attention when he entered the fight, and someone
realized that he was the same man that had defeated Kahn.</p>
<p>“Who is this human Dollar? He sure doesn’t look feeble.”</p>
<p>“Anyone who could beat Kahn must have some amount of strength.
But while that may be true, he cannot be stronger than Dragon
Eight.”</p>
<p>“Dragon Eight will win this fight. Let’s see how much trouble
Dollar can cause him first, though. If he can at least injure
Dragon Eight or reveal much of his true strength, then Dragon Eight
will be in danger when fighting Lone Bamboo next.”</p>
<p>“It does not matter. Regardless of who wins, Evil Eye will be
first.”</p>
<p>“Our Evil Eye is so strong!”</p>
<p>“Evil Eye is invincible!”</p>
<p>Regardless of a conversation’s subject matter, it eventually
drifted to Evil Eye. In that Geno Being Scroll, Evil Eye received
more attention than any King.</p>
<p>When Han Sen re-entered the Geno Being Scroll, his opponent was
Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked directly at Dragon Eight. He was like all the
other Dragons Han Sen had witnessed before, in that he was
extremely strong and exuded a frightening presence. His lifeforce
looked like a volcano that was in the midst of an eruption. The
Dragons were fearless and confident, and even through their plates
of armor, Han Sen could recognize them in an instant.</p>
<p>Han Sen had fought many Dragons by this point, so he knew much
about them. Dragon Eight sure seemed different from Dragon Nine,
though. He had gold armor that didn’t look too different from the
four-faced, eight-armed buddha soul armor. He didn’t hold a Dragon
spear, though. Instead, he just stood before Han Sen with his
fists.</p>
<p>Both of them wore gold armor. Dragon Eight was three meters
tall, whereas Han Sen was two meters tall. And Han Sen did not have
muscle like Dragon Eight. His figure was quite slim, by
comparison.</p>
<p>And Dragon Eight had those intimidating Dragon wings. It all
made Dragon Eight appear much stronger than Han Sen.</p>
<p>“They are both wearing gold armor, but why does Dragon Eight
look so elegant, whereas Dollar looks practically disheveled?”</p>
<p>“This is Dragon Eight of the Dragon. They naturally possess that
elegant presence. Elites from a smaller place cannot exude the
presence of such nobility.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Now it looks like only one of them is a Noble, and the
other is a cheap knock-off.”</p>
<p>“But that Dollar doesn’t look weak. Perhaps he will be able to
make Dragon Eight sweat and get us more information.”</p>
<p>“I hope he lasts long enough for us to learn something valuable.
When our heirs fight Dragon Eight, it will be far easier for them
to win.”</p>
<p>The Dragons and the Demons that watched the fight weren’t happy.
They had been watching Dollar for some time, and they knew he was a
tough foe.</p>
<p>Especially Dragon Nine and the others. They really worried about
Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>They weren’t worried about Dragon Eight not winning, though.
They were merely worried over the mysterious Dollar and his unknown
capabilities. They did not want to see Dragon Eight get
tricked.</p>
