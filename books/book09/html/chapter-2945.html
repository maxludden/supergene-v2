<p>“The fate monument is not a treasure that can be broken with
brute force.” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster wore a wry smile. “Right
now, I am waiting for my fate to be on the fate monument. If we use
brute force to attack the fate monument, only our fate will be
damaged. If we break the fate monument, our life will be broken
there too. We will die.”</p>
<p>“Is this treasure that magical?” Han Sen looked at the monument
with shock.</p>
<p>“Mister, he is correct,” Nine Thousand King said. “The fate
monument cannot be broken by brute force. If the Holy Kirin was
still around, this monument could be broken. Now, the Holy Kirin is
dead. The fate monument can do stuff by its own will, but maybe we
can break it.”</p>
<p>When hearing Nine Thousand King sound like a slave before Han
Sen, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and Sky Palace’s first seat looked
very strange.</p>
<p>“What way?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King did not answer. He looked at Ancient Abyss
Grandmaster, Sky Palace’s first seat, and the others with
hesitation. Obviously, he did not want them to hear the
solution.</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat looked at him with disdain and coldly
said, “You are just a servant of Sacred. What kind of method or
knowledge can you have? You only want to use the Call of Fate
function of the monument, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King was not going to hide it. He fought back and
replied, “If you know the monument has a Call of Fate, and you are
still trapped here, isn’t your life too cheap?”</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat was not angered by this. He coldly
looked at Nine Thousand King and said, “My life is a very heavy
one. It is 9,818 kilograms heavy. I wonder how heavy your life is.
We can see whose life is cheaper.”</p>
<p>“How dare you!” Nine Thousand King was furious. The eye on his
armor opened. It looked like he was ready to fight.</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat looked at Nine Thousand King coldly. He
was casting a power too.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Nine Thousand King and asked, “Number Nine,
what is Call of Fate?”</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King looked at Sky Palace’s first seat madly. He
then bowed and said, “Mister, Call of Fate is the base power of the
fate monument. It is like a normal creature using gold or stone to
suppress an enemy. If the opponent is more powerful, the
requirement of gold or stone would be greater. You had to be
heavier than the opponent to suppress them under the gold and
stone.”</p>
<p>“The logic of the fate monument is like that, but it suppresses
a soul and not one’s flesh. Ordinary powers cannot escape the fate
monument’s suppression, but souls have weight. We cannot see or
touch it usually. We can’t measure it either, but the fate monument
can measure how heavy your soul is. It uses kilograms to do it.
Without the Holy Kirin controlling it, the fate monument can
suppress souls that are 10,000 kilograms heavy or below. If your
soul is heavier than 10,000 kilograms, you can escape the
suppression of the fate monument. You might even be able to control
the fate monument and become its new master.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this was funny. He laughed out loud as he asked,
“Really? What determines the weight of the soul? Your achievements?
Your talents? Is it your level, maybe?”</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King shook his head. “It has nothing to do with
your achievements, talents, or level. The weight of a soul, for
every creature, is fixed. It is there when you are born. It does
not increase nor decrease. Even some cheap low-life creatures can
have a soul that is 10,000 kilograms. Many true god elite souls
might be as light as a feather.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so what is the effect of the weight of a soul?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” Nine Thousand King quickly said. “The soul
does not affect your talent or your practice. It also does not
affect your lifespan. It does not do anything about your leveling
up either. Aside from affecting the fate monument, I have never
heard of the soul’s weight contributing to anything.”</p>
<p>“That is because you are ignorant.” Sky Palace’s first seat
behaved as if he had a grudge with Nine Thousand King. He looked at
him with disdain.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King’s face looked angry. The green eye on the
armor stared at Sky Palace’s first seat as he said, “So, are you
not ignorant? Then, what is the use of a soul’s weight?”</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat said, “The weight of a soul is the base
of life. If it is light, your life is cheap. If it is heavy, your
life is expensive. It measures your fate. How is that useless?”</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King looked disdained. He coldly said, “You are
exaggerating. According to what you’re saying, the barons and
viscounts that have a 10,000-kilogram soul are more important than
true god creatures.”</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat squinted his eyes. “The weight of life
depends on your level. Commoners like you would never understand
that.”</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King was going to argue with Sky Palace’s first
seat, but Han Sen interrupted them. “How do you begin the Call of
Fate? Is it dangerous?”</p>
<p>“You only need to place a drop of your blood onto the fate
monument, and it will weigh your soul,” Nine Thousand King quickly
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Sky Palace’s first seat, but he said nothing.
Ancient Abyss Grandmaster did not say anything either. He supposed
Nine Thousand King was likely correct.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not try it himself. He received a drop of blood from
the goldfish’s wound and threw it at the fate monument.</p>
<p>That drop of blood was like lava when it hit the fate monument.
It spread like paint in water. The entire monument turned red.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly saw the top of the fate monument spawn four
number zeroes. They started to jump, starting from 0001.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that each number meant one kilogram. Four digits
meant the maximum was 9,999. If it hit 10,000, which was more than
four digits, that meant it reached the maximum of the fate
monument. The fate monument would not be able to suppress the
soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the fate monument number keep jumping and
thought, “This fate monument works just like the law’s eye.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the number on the fate monument would keep
rising. After all, the life of a true god xenogeneic could not be
too light.</p>
<p>The number on the fate monument only reached 26 before stopping.
It did not move anymore.</p>
<p>“Is the big goldfish’s soul only worth 26 kilograms?” Han Sen
was shocked. That was unexpected.</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat said his soul weighed 9,000 kilograms.
The big goldfish was true god too, but it only had 26 kilograms.
The difference was far too staggering.</p>
