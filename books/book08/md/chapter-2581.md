That monster was breathtakingly ugly. It was like a giant worm, but countless hair-like tentacles writhed from the sides of its body. The beast crawled out of the black water, its body still dripping the corrosive liquid of the sea.

When the white tiger saw the monster, its expression changed. It roared to the sky, its mouth stretched wide open. Then, a mushroom rain began to storm down on the big monster.

The mushrooms exploded near the monster, turning into giant spore clouds that hung in the air. Mushrooms began to grow on the heads of the snakes all around the spores.

As the small mushrooms grew, the bodies of the snakes were sucked dry. They collapsed onto the ground like dust.

Fang Qing Yu and the pirates stared at the battle with wide eyes. The pirates were so scared, and they screamed, “If our mushrooms grow big, will they suck us dry, too?”

Everyone was scared, but Han Sen reassured them by saying, “Don’t worry. The mushrooms on our heads are different from the mushrooms plaguing those snakes.”

The crew felt much safer after Han Sen said that, although their nerves continued to rattle.

The ugly monster stood in the center of those spore clouds, and the clouds were heaviest right around the monster’s body. But even so, it didn’t seem to be afflicted with the power-draining mushrooms.

The monster moved onto the island. It ate a lot of mushrooms, and the strange snakes moved with it. The white tiger was unable to do anything to stop them.

The white tiger kept firing its mushroom rain, but that attack only seemed to affect the smaller snakes. It did nothing to that horrendous beast. Furthermore, the monster was so unaffected that it completely ignored the white tiger. It simply dragged its mountainous body toward the mushroom forest. It opened its mouth wide and began gnashing its teeth to bite and chew. It was able to swallow a few acres of forest in no time.

No matter how many mushrooms the island contained, it clearly wouldn’t be enough to sate the hunger of that monster. The white tiger became extremely upset as it watched the enormous beast. The white tiger dug its head into the ground and disappeared.

“No way. It ran away so soon?” Fang Qing Yu and the others hadn’t expected that.

But the next second, the white tiger emerged underneath the monster. Its claws tore into the white tiger’s belly.

For a split second, everyone thought that the white tiger had cleverly gained the upper hand. Then the monster’s silky tentacles moved, reaching down and tying up the white tiger like a zongzi. The white tiger struggled and roared, but it couldn’t escape from the tentacles.

Those tiny tentacles appeared to be alive. They traced the white tiger’s mouth, ears, eyes, and nose. Then the lecherous things began drilling into each orifice. The white tiger began to release horrendous, deafening screams.

Everyone felt a chill while watching it. Their bodies flared with goosebumps. They had seen many people be killed before, and not even watching a person be dismembered would make them flinch. But seeing all those hair-like tentacles drilling into the mouth, ears, eyes, and nostrils of the white tiger was enough to give them a proper chill.

The white tiger kept struggling. It tried to gnaw and bite off the silk-like tentacles, but once the tentacles were bitten free, they could still move of their own volition. They were like worms, drilling into the creature’s body. The sight made people feel itchy.

“Little Red, go and help him!” Han Sen said to the little red bird.

The little red bird flew, and flames bloomed around it. As it departed the white whale, it became a fiery phoenix. Wherever it flew, red flames rose around it and incinerated the snakes in its proximity.

Golden fire shot from the little red bird’s mouth. The fire landed atop the silk-like tentacles and burned them to dust. The white tiger was saved and freed from the bindings that coiled around it.

The monster seemed to be frightened by the fires of the little red bird’s phoenix flame. It stopped eating the mushrooms, spun its body around, and used the eye upon its forehead to stare at the little red bird.

The little red bird screeched loudly. It flapped its wings, sending its phoenix flames raging toward the monster like a firestorm.

The monster’s countless tentacles suddenly wrapped around its body, forming a ball-shaped shell.

The phoenix flames landed atop the newly-formed shell and started to burn through it. But the fire only made it through the outer-layer. There were more layers on the inside.

The fire burned deeper, but the tentacles seemed endless. No amount of burning would be enough, it appeared.

Pang!

The little red bird was happily burning away at the monster when suddenly, a big spear that was like a mountain came out from the rocks beneath. The spear hit the little red bird before it could react and sent the little red bird spinning away amidst of haze of fiery explosions.

Han Sen had a closer look, and he found that the giant spear had been formed from the monster’s smaller tentacles.

After the hit that the little red bird had taken, its fires seemed to be weaker. It screamed in rage. And when it screamed, the strength and vigor of its flames returned. It hurled itself back into the fight with the monster.

The monster moved its silk tentacles, letting them writhe together. Many wings formed around the monster’s body, and those wings began to beat in tandem to make the body of the creature fly very quickly. It was no slower than the little red bird.

The monster and the little red bird chased each other through the air. The silk tentacles on the monster seemed innumerable, and they could take on any shape. They could form shields and weapons if they wished to. The little red bird’s fire could drive back the tentacles for a while, but no lasting damage was ever done.

A lot of the weird snakes were still headed for the island, and the white tiger remained there to deal with them. But there were still too many of them. And it didn’t matter how many were killed, as more and more would show up. They refused to retreat from the island.

“Whoever is King class or above should go out there and help,” Han Sen said. Then, he summoned his peacock king’s soul robe and hastily departed the white whale.

Bao’er jumped onto Han Sen’s shoulder to go with him.

Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon went with him, too. The Extreme King knights and pirates also went out to fight. They knew this was a matter of life and death, and so nobody thought twice about going out there to fight.

Han Sen didn’t go after the horde of snakes, though. He was headed for the little red bird and the monster that were still fighting in the sky. His body glowed like a rainbow as he flew toward the monster.

The monster reacted to his approach incredibly quickly. It continued to fight the little red bird, but it also spawned many more tentacles that formed a shield to stop the corrosion induced by the rainbow light.

While the rainbow light quickly melted through the makeshift shield, the tentacles were able to immediately form a new one. It would continue doing so until the rainbow light cast by Han Sen was finished.

When Han Sen got close to the monster, the tentacles formed a big hammer that tried to strike him. Han Sen looped through the air like a phoenix to avoid the hammer. He cast a rainbow light across his body.

But the rainbow light was blocked by another shield of tentacles. Although the monster was fighting two enemies, it was dealing with Han Sen and the little red bird’s attacks with perfect precision.
