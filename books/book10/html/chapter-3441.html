<p>Human King was sitting in the 33 skies. He had become the owner
of the geno tablet, but the geno tablet was unable to replace the
geno hall to become the leader of the universe. He had to wait
until the geno hall was overthrown.</p>
<p>If there was no geno tablet, even if one beat the geno hall, one
could not become the universe’s controller. Human King had the most
basic fundamentals, so all he required was the last step.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Leader, on becoming the leader of the
universe.” The members of Blood Legion all bowed before Human King
profusely. Countless generations of their people had given up so
much in their long wait for this day. They had created Blood Legion
for this purpose. Now, Human King only required one final step to
become the leader of the universe.</p>
<p>“Mister Leader, when are we going to fight the geno hall?” a
Blood Legion member asked with much excitement.</p>
<p>“There is no rush for that just yet,” Human King said. “Crape
Myrtle destroyed my body. Although what he tried did not work, his
power has made my body combine far slower. It will still take me a
while to completely absorb Qin Xiu’s power for me to complete that
last step.”</p>
<p>“What an obscene man he was!” a member madly proclaimed. “He
should have known he could not ultimately stop you from becoming
the geno tablet’s leader. He has been a right thorn in your
backside. Wait until you walk that last step. Then, you will be
able to kill every last person inside that wretched geno hall!”</p>
<p>“He is my enemy,” Human King said. “Crape Myrtle did not do
anything wrong. After all, we are the ones seeking to overthrow his
rule and usher in the dawn of a new age. It is understandable that
he only wants to stop us from achieving that. Wait until we defeat
the geno hall. If he wants to, I can find a position for him to
work at in the 33 skies. With his power and knowledge, it would
only be a big boon for Blood Legion. Of course, he is a prideful
man. I suspect he would sooner choose death than obey me.”</p>
<p>An old member, with lots of white hair, came forward to bow
before Human King. “You are right. Only doing that can show Blood
Legion is actually quite reasonable. When I control Under the Sky,
I am willing to be the spokesperson. I will convince Crape Myrtle
to join our legion.”</p>
<p>“There is no rush,” Human King said with a squint of his eyes.
“One more thing, we must sort all of this out before we assault
geno hall. Otherwise, there will be trouble.”</p>
<p>“What thing?” All the members looked at Human King with
curiosity. They did not know that, aside from the geno hall, there
could be someone else that might challenge their rule of the
universe.</p>
<p>“Han Sen has a daughter called Bao’er, isn’t that correct?”
Human King looked at God’s Retribution.</p>
<p>God’s Retribution’s heart froze. He bowed and said, “Yes. Han
Sen has a daughter Han Bao’er. Out of all of his children, I would
think she is his favorite one. She is the one who is always around
him. What is it?”</p>
<p>God’s Retribution may have said all of this, but he still felt a
profound worry in his heart. “The leader is asking about Bao’er.
Does he want to do something bad to Han Sen?”</p>
<p>Human King coldly said, “That Han Bao’er has always been around
five years old. She has never grown up, isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is right,” God’s Retribution said with a nod. Even if
he wanted to help Han Sen, he could not lie to his superior. The
things Human King wanted to know about Bao’er were too obvious.</p>
<p>“In that case, it must be right,” Human King said. “We have to
find Han Bao’er. Bring her to me.”</p>
<p>God’s Retribution wondered how he might be able to find out what
it was Human King was looking to do. It was fortunate another
member was willing to enquire out loud. “Mister Leader, why do you
need Han Sen’s child?”</p>
<p>“I do not mean to bring Han Sen any harm. That girl is not Han
Sen’s real daughter anyway. She is the daughter of the last Geno
Hall Leader and the leader of the God Chaos Party. She is a big
threat to Blood Legion’s rule. Therefore, we must take steps to
remove her.” Human King did not hide his intent. He talked about
Bao’er’s history openly next. “Is that who Bao’er is?” Everyone was
shocked after hearing this. They all agreed they should capture
Bao’er.</p>
<p>“You guys still need to adjust to your new powers,” Human King
coldly said. “You do not need to go. God Chaos Party is currently
under my control. Just let them go.”</p>
<p>He did not think anyone would be able to kill Bao’er, but he
needed someone to force Bao’er out of hiding. Only then could
Bao’er be erased.</p>
<p>“You guys should go back now. If there is nothing important you
require of me, do not disturb me. I must focus on working on the
last step.” Human King waved his hand and told everyone to depart.
When all the other members were gone, Human King said to himself.
“If I had not received Qin Xiu’s memories, I would not have known
Han Sen had a daughter like that. That Qin Xiu was so arrogant. He
did not even realize what kind of dangerous being there was out
there. I will not make the mistake he would have. I will have
Bao’er under control long before I achieve control of the geno
hall.”</p>
<p>Human King had access to all of Qin Xiu’s memories. He knew
Bao’er was currently in the sanctuaries. Blood Legion came from the
sanctuaries, but they could never return to the sanctuaries. If
they wanted to capture Bao’er, they would have to do it in Space
Garden and force Bao’er to come out of the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Things in Space Garden were not the best right now, and that was
mainly because Han Sen had gone missing following his battle
against Crape Myrtle. Although Mister White assured everyone that
Han Sen was not dead, people were still worrying a lot about his
welfare.</p>
<p>It seemed calm had returned to the universe. Human King had the
geno tablet. The big fight could be triggered at any second. No one
had the mood to do anything.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, your power is so strong. Why are you still
single? If I was you, I would marry many women. I would go for all
the pretty ones. I would have the prettiest women from the Dragon,
and even from the Sky.” Tang Zhenliu looked at Wang Yuhang with
profound jealousy.</p>
<p>He was practicing with Wang Yuhang. He could not fight Wang
Yuhang though. It was like fighting Wang Yuhang was a big crime.
Wang Yuhang moved his lips, but he did not say anything. He shook
his head. “To get a woman with that power, to me, would be like
getting myself a sex doll. You might like a sex doll, but I do not
like that.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu wished to say something to counter that, but he
suddenly heard a boom. It was like a huge hole had formed in the
sky. The whole of Space Garden tremored.</p>
<p>“Fuck! Who is so ballsy that they have come to meddle with Space
Garden?” Tang Zhenliu was very angry. He looked at the sky and saw
the sky was full of space battleships that were breaking down Space
Garden’s defenses. They were headed for Space Garden.</p>
<p>Many scary creatures were flying next to the ships. There were
some leaders from the 33 skies too. Tang Zhenliu had seen many of
these people before. He recognized that they once belonged to God
Chaos Party.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang’s and Tang Zhenliu’s faces changed. “God Chaos Party
has gone nuts! Why are they attacking Space Garden?”</p>
<p>In Space Garden, Ning Yue, Huangfu Jing, Xie Qing King, Very
High Leader, Sky Palace Leader, and the others all emerged. Many of
the elites looked up at the sky filled with battleships and
frightening creatures. They did not know what was going on.</p>
