<h3>Chapter 3365</h3>

<p>The fire was very unique. Just as it left the Tail Fire Beast’s
mouth, it activated all the fire elements in the universe’s
universal cogwheels. The power of the fire subdued the rules of all
the others. It created an absolute fire rule seal.</p>
<p>This was an absolute Break World power. It was the type of power
only Break World creatures that had a Break World rate over 90%
could use. It was very close to an ultimate aura.</p>
<p>As a sky full of fire descended, all the rules were replaced by
fire rules. The fire scorched the entire world.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on backing down. He used his Jadeskin to
break the world. A mysterious ice-jade marking revealed itself. It
came together to become an ice-jade ball that put Han Sen, Bao’er,
and the two pets inside its protection.</p>
<p>“He has a Break World rate that is only 60%. This fight is going
to lack excitement.” The Break World beasts that watched Han Sen
saw his Break World mark and acknowledged that he was not spawning
an absolute bai sema. They were all coldly laughing at him.</p>
<p>It was just a layer of power. The Tail Fire Beast had a burning
red sky power buff to fuel its strength, and it looked as if the
fight was going to be over very soon.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The fire was like a disaster coming down. It buried Han Sen and
his ice-jade shield with endless streams of fire that seemed able
to bully the world. The whole burning red sky became a purgatory of
fire. Everything was melting.</p>
<p>It was such a scary scene that everyone was shaking. Tail Fire
Beast was like a god beast that managed fire. It made people feel
scared just seeing it.</p>
<p>If it wanted to, it seemed it could cast disasters on a whim and
set the whole world on fire.</p>
<p>In the next second, everyone froze. Amidst that endless
purgatory of fire, there was an icy light. A holy shadow emerged
from the fire. When the shadows disappeared, one could see that the
scorching fire was frozen. It was like an ice statue that looked
like tentacles in the air.</p>
<p>“How is that even possible?” Many Break World beasts were
shocked. They looked at Han Sen with a gaze of disbelief.</p>
<p>A man with a Break World rate of 60% was squaring off against a
foe with a 90% Break World rate. Despite that, the former was using
a weaker element and could repel the fire conjured by Tail Fire
Beast. It was extremely difficult to believe.</p>
<p>Although the Break World rate was not real power, there was a
difference between the combatants’ levels. Furthermore, the
elements were weaker. It was hard to believe something lower could
defeat something higher.</p>
<p>Tail Fire Beast’s pupils became small. It roared madly. The fire
in the burning red sky started to explode. The fire coming to
attack Han Sen raged even more.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked cold. He appeared clean and icy. It was not like
he was a being from Earth. The ice-jade power fought the fire
power. It separated two worlds.</p>
<p>There was only a wall of fire in front of Han Sen. It was a lava
fire.</p>
<p>Behind him was a frozen path of ice and jade.</p>
<p>The two powers with different levels collided. No one could
prove greater than the other, which made time freeze in place.</p>
<p>On a distant planet far away, there was a god temple wrought of
metal. It was near a forest and a river. A woman was sitting atop a
rock on the banks of the river. Her white feet dangled in the
water. She kicked and splashed it merrily.</p>
<p>A man with white hair was not too far from the river. He was
cooking fish on the nice flames of a campfire.</p>
<p>The woman held her jaw and looked up. She saw Tail Fire Beast
battling against Han Sen. She lifted her lips and said, “What a
fool. It has been so long, and he has only practiced Cold Sutra to
this level.”</p>
<p>The white-haired man smiled. “He is a man practicing Cold Sutra.
It is merely lucky he has not been consumed. It is not easy for him
to practice that.”</p>
<p>The woman was not happy. “No matter what body he has, if he took
my Cold Sutra, he must do his best to master it.”</p>
<p>The white-haired man laughed and did not speak. He knew what the
personality of this woman was like. It was not that she was not
enjoying Han Sen’s performance. She just wanted Han Sen to be able
to do better.</p>
<p>“What a fool. It is the Cold Sutra. What did he do with it? He
cannot even put out a small fire. He is making a fool out of me.”
The woman complained again. Even so, when she squinted her eyes, it
looked as if there was a faint smile forming.</p>
<p>The white-haired man asked, “If you hate him that much, why do
you not invite him here? Perhaps you can teach him the true Cold
Sutra.”</p>
<p>The woman shook her head and sighed. “It does not matter
anymore. The water is too polluted. It would be best if we do not
touch it anymore.”</p>
<p>The white-haired man did not respond. After cooking the fish, he
gave it to the woman.</p>
<p>The woman accepted the fish and had a bite. She resumed watching
Han Sen in combat. As she continued to eat, she said, “The Cold
Sutra he practices with is weird. It is different from my Cold
Sutra. Even if he has taken a shortcut, I wonder what it will be
when he practices it at its ultimate level.”</p>
<p>“The same geno arts turn out differently depending on who
practices them,” the white-haired man said. “Plus, men and women
are different. It is normal for this to be different.”</p>
<p>The woman looked at the white-haired man and asked, “So, if he
and I practice to the max, whose Cold Sutra would end up
stronger?”</p>
<p>“Of course, yours would be stronger.” The white-haired man did
not hesitate to respond and looked sincere as he spoke.</p>
<p>The woman puffed from her mouth and rolled her eyes. “You answer
me honestly now. Do not lie.”</p>
<p>The white-haired man laughed and said, “I am speaking the truth.
If it was just a matter of cold power, I think yours would be
better. Regarding interest, I think his modified Cold Sutra might
prove more interesting.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by interesting?” the woman asked. She looked
at the man with confusion. She was not entirely sure what he
meant.</p>
<p>“Unknown things are always interesting due to the infinite
possibilities one can think up,” the white-haired man said. “No one
can see what lies ahead to determine the outcome. Therefore, you
are always made hopeful in seeing the unknown.” The white-haired
man looked weird as he proceeded to say, “Like this.”</p>
<p>When the white-haired man spoke, the burning red sky’s power
exhibited changes. Han Sen’s ice-jade power suddenly lessened. The
ice-jade shield became smaller too.</p>
<p>The stalemate of balance between the two was broken. The crazy
fire came down to cover Han Sen’s holy body.</p>
<p>The creatures watching were shocked. They thought Tail Fire
Beast had taken the advantage and beat Han Sen.</p>
<p>The Break World beasts were so excited that they roared. The
geno universe’s creatures looked terrible. If the geno universe’s
strongest elites lost, they would not stand a chance.</p>
<p>“Are San Mu and Bao’er OK?” Qin Bai asked with worry.</p>
