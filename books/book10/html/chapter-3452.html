<p>Bao’er’s eyes looked cold. The little gold gourd in her hands
was not going away. She coldly shouted, “Mother! Come back!”</p>
<p>Human King felt bad about this. He used rule powers to cloak the
skies and then suddenly felt emptiness. Ji Yanran, who had been
grabbed by him, had been sucked toward the gold little gourd with
the magical spell chain that had kept her in wraps. Human King’s
face changed. Let’s not say this was purely because of Bao’er’s
power, but even Han Littleflower and Han Ling’er had beaten him up
when they co-operated. He turned around, wanting to do nothing more
than escape.</p>
<p>“Are you attempting to escape now? Isn’t that just a bit too
late?” Bao’er grunted coldly. She used the little gourd to shine on
Human King. Space suddenly started to swirl. A gourd was at the
center of the swirl.</p>
<p>Human King gathered up universe power. He was unable to teleport
away. The whole of space, all of its rules and orders, were
disturbed by the presence of that gourd. Human King was unable to
his own rules powers to move and shift things. He used his universe
powers to fight back against the force of suction. No matter what
he tried, he could not escape and fly away from the suck.</p>
<p>“Bad man! Where are you going to go now?” Han Ling’er shouted.
Her body had combined with Han Littleflower’s holy spirit. She was
going toward Human King, who was currently in space.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s little gourd power was weird. Her force of suction only
seemed to work on Human King. It did not affect anyone else. Han
Ling’er was not affected in the slightest, so she ran in front of
Human King and gave him a big punch in the face.</p>
<p>Human King was not capable of beating Ling’er, who had Holy
Spirit Protect keeping her safe. His body was trapped by the godly
force of suction. Nothing he did granted him escape, so Ling’er
punched him in the face.</p>
<p>Human King’s face twisted as his body leaned back. Because he
had been sucked by the little gourd, he could not fly away. He had
to remain precisely where he was. Ling’er was furious. A fist and a
leg were moving. They beat against Human King as if he was a doll.
He moved left and right in response. Bit by bit, the geno prototype
armor shattered more and more as time went by.</p>
<p>Chaos was watching this unfold. She was frozen in sheer
disbelief.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Why is her power no worse than this guy, who
is half a step away from achieving Universe class or perhaps even
better? Is this as far as a mixed human can go?” Chaos thought.
Seeing that his god body was going to shatter, Human King was
becoming very angry. After he consumed Qin Xiu, his power kept
fading. Even the geno god base needed to be avoided. He did not
expect his heirs would provide him with so much trouble. His heart
jumped. Space around started to rumble. It was like there was a
giant space tsunami. The whole of space in Space Garden created big
space movements. Every substance and creature became distorted.
Their bodies all became weird.</p>
<p>The area that had shaking space came out from a giant stone
tablet. It was the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Seeing the geno tablet’s light spell spin, it was like a giant
calculator was calculating something. All of the light symbols kept
flickering across it.</p>
<p>Ever since the geno tablet had appeared, Human King, who had
been restricted, had his spirit light glow brighter. Originally, it
was just his hand that had a spirit body. With the buffing of the
geno tablet, his body and the black crystal armor started to adopt
a spirit-like appearance.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Human King and Han Ling’er punched each other. The former failed
to shake off Han Ling’er, but it was not like before where he was
getting dominated. Bao’er’s face changed. Human King’s body flew
up. He escaped the gourd’s force of suction.</p>
<p>The geno tablet struck the Space Garden. All of Space Garden and
space around looked as if it was under the pressure of the geno
tablet. The creatures that were not yet Break World class were
pushed down onto the ground by the geno tablet’s rule power. They
were unable to move.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er attacked Human King again, but Human King’s spirit
body was able to fight against Han Ling’er’s speed and power. It
was becoming easier and easier to block. He was no longer
suppressed by the violent Han Ling’er.</p>
<p>“Han Ling’er, come back!” Bao’er looked glum as she yelled at
Han Ling’er.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er was very young. When she saw Human King was capable
of blocking her attacks, she became a little scared. She heard
Bao’er calling out to her, which was what prompted her to fall
back.</p>
<p>“I am the leader of the geno tablet. I can suppress the entire
universe. You have some power, but you do not have enough to defeat
the likes of me.” Human King’s body was clad in the broken geno
prototype armor. When he was a spirit, it recovered. It wrapped up
Human King’s body to look like new.</p>
<p>“Human King is using the geno tablet’s power. It looks like he
is going to be able to make that step.” Chaos was watching all of
this unfold from afar. She was primarily concerned about the safety
of Bao’er.</p>
<p>Human King was going to take that step any second now, but
Bao’er only needed some fire. She could not really fight him.</p>
<p>Human King stood in front of the geno tablet as a sky full of
god light protected his god body. People were able to see there
were two bolts of lightning striking each other.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s eyes were filled with gold. She fired two gold lights
at him. With Human King’s vision hitting her lights, two scary
powers exploded between them.</p>
<p>Space collapsed. Time and light collapsed. It created a weird
hole. It looked like it was there, but it was not there. It looked
like a giant, empty hole.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder why this is God Chaos Party and the Geno Hall
Leader’s heir. If you walk that step, I will have to fight you with
my power.” Human King’s long purple hair went straight. It was
flying with the black and grey universe power. The black and grey
universe power started to turn purple.</p>
<p>The geno tablet and Human King’s power shone on each other. They
were covered in purple light. It was like a mysterious tablet from
ancient times was landing there.</p>
<p>When the power of Human King and the geno tablet changed, Human
King’s geno prototype armor became like melting ice. It simply
became juice that was absorbed by Human King’s body. Human King’s
perfect god body was now on display in front of everybody. Every
inch of his body was releasing a mysterious and powerful purple
light. That light did not seem to fit in with the universe’s rules
and order. It made the rules of the universe isolate from his body.
It put Human King’s body in a blur. It did not look real. It was
like a layer of matte glass.</p>
<p>“He walked that step.” Chaos’s heart jumped. Even though she
knew this was going to happen, she was still nervous about it
actually happening</p>
<p>With the old leader’s and her blood, combined with the aid of
the geno tablet, it would be strange if he had not been able to
take that last step.</p>
<p>What made Chaos sad was that Human King had great difficulty
breaking through that step. Yet, Bao’er’s and Ling’er’s suppression
was the catalyst for making him finally make that step. He made
it.</p>
<p>His body was now looking weird. Human King was glowing with a
mysterious and purple light. Bao’er could not help but frown. She
looked at Human King and said to Littleflower, “Littleflower, let
me use your holy spirit.”</p>
