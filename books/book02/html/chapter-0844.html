    <p>
      Han Sen did not want to visit the Qi family himself, so he asked Ji
      Ruozhen to buy the pills for him. He also explained to him the likely
      benefice the pills would provide humanity in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen&#8217;s thoughts aligned with Han Sen&#8217;s own. He had
      convened a family meeting earlier, in the hopes of asking the family
      whether or not they should buy all the pet pills produced by the Qi
      family.
    </p>

    <p>
      But everyone present was keener on the prospects presented by Angel Gene
      Fluid, and they disregarded what Ji Ruozhen told them. He was unable to
      convince the others in the family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen instead used his own money to purchase as many pills as
      possible. Han Sen himself sold everything he did not need, and used the
      money he amassed to buy as much of the Qi family&#8217;s stock of pills as
      he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the Qi family had overstocked, unaware of the promotional blunder
      that was waiting to happen, they were facing bankruptcy. They had spent a
      fortune on ingredients for future production of the pills, but the low
      sales put a large financial strain on the family. To regain as much of
      their capital as possible, they settled for setting the selling price of
      the pills under their production cost and selling at a loss. Now that Ji
      Ruozhen was buying so many, the Qi family was extremely grateful.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, a lot of money was going Angel Gene&#8217;s way instead. Few
      had the money to help the Qi family, especially when competing with Angel
      Gene. The help Ji Ruozhen lent the Qi family was massive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was the one funding most of the purchases, however. Ji Ruozhen
      only stood in to make the transactions and deal with the business. And as
      this was happening, Han Sen spent a lot of time in the sanctuary,
      wondering how he might protect the Jade-Gold Tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      After much deliberation, Han Sen came to the conclusion he would not be
      able to protect it from a siege. Therefore, he thought about striking out
      against the Devil-Blood King first. He wagered the that offense, at a time
      like this, would be the best defense.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not bad. But how are you going to draw the super creatures out of
      the Devil-Blood Shelter?&#8221; Although Moment Queen had faith in the
      plan working, the super creatures were inside the shelter and there was no
      way Han Sen could just wander in. If they couldn&#8217;t be drawn out, any
      preparation they now made would all be for naught.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Drawing them out will not be difficult, provided I can be as
      fleet-of-foot as I need to be.&#8221; Han Sen laughed. He was thinking of
      calling upon Wang Yuhang. To draw super creatures away, he figured they
      would have no choice but to rely on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was fortunate Wang Yuhang had been captured by the Zhao family not too
      long ago. Finding him again in the surrounding regions would be much
      easier now.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he did find Wang Yuhang again, he asked him whether or not he wanted
      to hunt super creatures with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Super creatures? They are naught compared to the strength and zeal
      I command these days. I will lay waste to aught that comes our way!&#8221;
      Wang Yuhang&#8217;s chest was puffed in a display of cockiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised at Wang Yuhang&#8217;s behavior and asked,
      &#8220;Little Uncle, since when did you become so brave?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Teehee! I will not cloak the font of my bravery. See here, this
      remedy I possess?&#8221; As he said this, he pulled a metal box out of his
      pack. Inside it, there were two vials of a certain concoction.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Angel Gene Fluid?&#8221; Han Sen remembered what they looked like.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Teehee! The higher-tier variant, as well. You can cast elemental
      powers like projectiles with these nifty little potions,&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Where did you get it from?&#8221; Han Sen was surprised. They were
      very popular, and many people clamored for them, but with the limited
      amount of blood available for their creation, their stock was low. Wang
      Yuhang was by no means a famous evolver, so the fact that he owned two was
      startling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I bought them. You would be silly to believe the Zhao family would
      grace the magnificence of myself with these, free of charge.&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang put away the vials and continued with a thump of his chest,
      &#8220;So, where is this place you speak of? For whatever monstrous
      devilry challenges you, I shall slay unwaveringly!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, so it&#8217;s good that I can depend on you.&#8221; Han Sen
      smiled. Wang Yuhang was very confident right now, so it was the perfect
      time to bring him to the Devil-Blood Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it were any other day, he would most likely refuse to come. There were
      indeed far too many super creatures residing there, and with his bad luck,
      it&#8217;d cause a number of troubles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Angel Gene Fluid had not only boosted his courage, but when they
      engaged the monsters they&#8217;d fight there, the juice might very well
      save his life.
    </p>

    <p>
      They both traveled north towards the Devil-Blood Shelter. Wang
      Yuhang&#8217;s confidence had yet to waver, and he was visibly firm in the
      comfort provided by his ownership of the Angel Gene Fluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen merely hoped his cockiness would not get the better of him. When
      it came to fighting super creatures, he could still be destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood Shelter was like a castle, and it was smaller than Han Sen
      had imagined it to be. It did look haunted, however. It wasn&#8217;t as
      elegant and holy-looking as Moment Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did you not make mention of a trial of frightening fury? Pah, look
      hither. I, all by my lonesome, will engage this entire eerie estate
      solo!&#8221; After speaking, Wang Yuhang retrieved his injector and
      prepared to inject himself with one vial of the Angel Gene Fluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that the shelter was not too big, he did not believe anything
      powerful could reside within.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen grabbed his hand, however. He said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t stop you
      from killing anything, but I think it would be best if we did some
      reconnaissance first.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fine. I&#8217;ll allow the wretches that reside within a couple
      more minutes to cling to the fleeting, miserable excuses they deem as
      lives.&#8221; Wang Yuhang put away the injector.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen and Wang Yuhang neared the shelter, the latter&#8217;s face
      turned pale. The heroism that had previously driven Wang Yuhang dribbled
      away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Above the Devil-Blood Shelter, a large dragon could be seen flying. A
      strange bird was also up there. There were many vile creatures outside the
      gates, including something like a minotaur.
    </p>

    <p>
      Half an hour later, they had positively identified five different super
      creatures. God knew how many more resided within the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, your opportunity has arrived. Do you want to go out
      there and kill them now?&#8221; Han Sen smiled at Wang Yuhang, whose face
      was still pale.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he heard what Han Sen had asked him, he jumped and said, &#8220;Is it
      my death that you earnestly desire?! The number of creatures there are too
      many, and to attempt an infiltration would be suicide. I am not fond of
      the concept of following you inside merely to die.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We cannot rush in, you are right. But we can draw a few of them
      away. Aren&#8217;t you quite proficient in that?&#8221; Han Sen laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang&#8217;s face turned bitter and he said, &#8220;You are
      well-aware of how unfortunate I can be. If I venture any nearer to this
      sordid hellhole, every monster in the vicinity will lust for my blood and
      come at me like hounds. Think of the variety of grizzly deaths I might end
      up suffering&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you have the Angel Gene Fluid? There is nothing to be
      afraid of,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I spent every last penny I possessed on obtaining these delightful
      solutions, and I bought them so that I might slay super creatures. I
      hadn&#8217;t planned on using them just so I could run away,&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, it won&#8217;t work. So, how about you go and draw
      them out? For any super creature we kill, you&#8217;ll get sixty percent
      of the shares. Of the Life Geno Essences we sell, I&#8217;ll only receive
      forty percent. If there are beast souls, you get first pick.&#8221; Han
      Sen conjured a wide array of different temptations for Wang Yuhang.
      Killing the super creatures was what was most important, and Han Sen did
      not care too much about the rewards.
    </p>

    <p>
      There would likely be more first-generations inside there, anyway. If that
      was the case, Han Sen wouldn&#8217;t mind giving them to Wang Yuhang, at
      all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s eyes suddenly sparkled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;When have I ever lied to you?&#8221; Han Sen said, with a smug and
      righteous look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, I want seventy percent. And all the beast souls we receive will
      be mine,&#8221; Wang Yuhang said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221; Han Sen agreed.</p>
