	<p>He didn’t know when the chimenea had begun spewing icy fire again, but that’s what it was now doing.</p>

	<p>The mouths of the eleven Black Seahorses were shaped like megaphones. They spat out frosty air at the white metal
		tower.</p>

	<p>“Shit! Are those Black Seahorses that cruel? Even if I did steal your little Ice Seahorse, there’s no need to
		freeze him and me together. You guys are crueler than tigers.” Han Sen felt depressed, and he tried to think of
		a way he might escape this predicament.</p>

	<p>The frosty air cropped across Destiny’s Tower, webbing the entirety of its metal structure. Even if Little Star
		used its Starsea powers to escape, Han Sen thought they’d be frozen, anyway.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The glaciers all around were broken by that frosty air. The peaks collapsed, and soon after, the cap of the white
		metal tower came crumbling down with them.</p>

	<p>The deadly flowers had become nothing but icicles under the force of that frosty air. The cold ruined and
		destroyed any powers they possessed. And soon after, the very ground began to tear and come asunder. It was like
		the world was ending.</p>

	<p>The eleven Black Seahorses and their power were too much. The wrath they unleashed could have definitely put them
		in the category of being berserk super creatures.</p>

	<p>“Fuck! They’re trying to kill me. Wait a minute… If they’re using such powerful frosty air, then why don’t I feel
		cold?” Han Sen was shocked when he realized he didn’t feel cold, at all.</p>

	<p>The frosty air froze the glaciers stiff until they broke, but Han Sen was not feeling a thing. The frosty air
		might as well have not even existed.</p>

	<p>“Is it so cold that my brain froze, and now I cannot feel the cold anymore?” Han Sen pinched himself, but he did
		feel pain. His skin was still silky smooth, as well. He definitely wasn’t frozen.</p>

	<p>“What’s going on? Has the white metal tower shielded us from the Black Seahorses’ ice spit?” Amidst Han Sen’s
		shock, he asked himself this question</p>

	<p>The white metal tower was atop an ice mountain. The eleven Black Seahorses had broken the mountain with their
		frosty air. The white tower had been falling, but now, they were no longer feeling any such movement.</p>

	<p>Han Sen quickly returned to the window, and what he saw surprised him.</p>

	<p>The white metal tower hadn’t fallen with the mountain. It was actually hanging in mid-air. A hand was there,
		holding it aloft in the sky.</p>

	<p>It was a giant, rock-like hand. And the huge white tower was being casually held up by this hand. It wasn’t
		taking up the entire hand, either. The tower looked like a toy that just happened to rest in its palm.</p>

	<p>Han Sen followed the hand back to the arm that supported it. The hand was actually connected to a man made of
		rock. A giant rockman. It also just happened to be headless.</p>

	<p>The rockman was sitting between the glaciers with its hand holding the white metal tower aloft. This was the
		headless rockman Han Sen had seen on the first floor of the white tower.</p>

	<p>Now that rockman was shining, and the light it gave off was so bright, it obscured sight of the mountain itself.
		It was a god-like sort of magic.</p>

	<p>“Destiny. Destiny.”</p>

	<p>A really sad voice came from the rockman. It was like he was saying you could not control destiny. Destiny was
		full of unfairness, and it was governed by cruelty.</p>

	<p>Rockman had no head, though, so Han Sen wasn’t sure where the voice was actually coming from. Regardless, it
		boomed like thunder. It made the blood inside his body vibrate so wildly, it felt like it was trying to break
		out.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen looked at the eleven Black Seahorses and the chimenea next, his face changed.</p>

	<p>The Black Seahorses and the chimenea had somehow become gigantic. They were almost as big as the rockman.</p>

	<p>All the Black Seahorses looked like sun-class battleships. And the chimenea looked like an entire planet.</p>

	<p>“Destiny. Destiny. My life is my life. My life is my life. It does not belong to the sky.” Rockman’s voice
		sounded even crazier than it had before. It was spoken with a force that should have been enough to sunder the
		earth. It was like an undying warrior, filled with a zeal for murder.</p>

	<p>“After all these years, do you still not understand?” The chimenea now spoke, and it was a cold voice that came
		from it. It was not loud, but its volume was still greater than the rockman’s. It came into Han Sen’s ear
		without losing a single word.</p>

	<p>That voice was unisex, too. Han Sen couldn’t determine whether or not it was the voice of a woman or a man. But
		what Han Sen could tell was that it was the creature with the armor that was speaking.</p>

	<p>“I won’t understand, even in death.” The rockman had a very loud and angry voice. Its other hand, which was like
		a mountain, came towards the eleven Black Seahorses and the chimenea.</p>

	<p>It felt as if the ground was breaking when that big hand moved. Wherever the big hand went, the entire dimension
		was cracked. It felt like the whole world could be crushed below its might, whenever it struck.</p>

	<p>The eleven Black Seahorses were screaming at it angrily. The megaphone lips that were like the gun emplacements
		on a sun-class battleship spat out frosty air. Their force was enough to impede and stop the movement of the
		stone hand.</p>

	<p>That scary, frosty air made its hand freeze in place. The creatures then generated more ice, to encase it inside.
	</p>

	<p>“You are dead. You should understand that.” The chimenea spoke again with an even colder voice.</p>

	<p>“I won’t. Even if I die.” The rockman sounded very sad, and he continued pushing down. The ice that encased his
		hand was broken and cast away, and the hand resumed its advance. It was going to break the heads of the eleven
		Black Seahorses.</p>

	<p><em>Pop!</em></p>

	<p>The eleven Black Seahorses spilled blood and fell back. Even they could not withstand the rockman’s power.</p>

	<p>“Let it burn to dust.” With that cold voice, the chimenea’s grate was opened. The ice fire came out, and it began
		to rapidly approach the body of the rockman.</p>

	<p>Han Sen now knew that neither the rockman nor the Black Seahorses were coming after him. Still, witnessing such
		wrathful power was very frightening.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had simply come there for treasure. He didn’t expect to encounter such bad luck and stumble into the
		cross-fire of two bosses fighting. Compared to the chimenea and rockman, Han Sen’s power was like a small river
		running into the sea. He was not very effective by comparison.</p>

	<p>Seeing the ice flames come like a river, Han Sen was worried that the tower would be completely destroyed.</p>

	<p>The rockman’s hand that held the tower moved, and the tower flew through the air. It was going towards the
		airborne fire.</p>

	<p>And then, Han Sen saw the frost get absorbed and nullified by the body of the white metal tower. It sucked it up
		clean.</p>
