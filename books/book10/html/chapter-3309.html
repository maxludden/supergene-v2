<p>Knowing they were both OK, Han Sen flashed his body outside of
the base.</p>
<p>He saw a cow-headed monster with demonic wings on its back. It
was attacking the base. Qin Xuan, Zero, Exquisite, and Moment Queen
were attacking the monster that had the head of a cow.</p>
<p>The monster with the cow head kept quaking the earth. No one was
able to block its powerful attacks. The base’s power collapsed.
Many humans, spirits, and young men in the base were hurt.</p>
<p>Of the elites that remained, none of them were good when it came
to defenses. They were not like Lin Feng. They could barely block
the assault of the monster with the head of a cow. Qin Xuan and
Zero were injured.</p>
<p>The young men had never experienced a cataclysm like this
before. No matter how much of a genius they were, when they were
crushed like that, they could only be afraid and cry.</p>
<p>After the monster with the head of a cow shook the ground again,
there was a tsunami of earth and soil. It rose right in the base.
It seemed as if no one was able to put an end to its attacks.</p>
<p>Zero and Moment Goddess attacked from the side. They could not
fight straight on.</p>
<p>A shadow appeared in front of the base. It flicked its finger to
fire a coin that stuck to the cow-headed monster’s forehead. The
monster with the head of a cow fell to the ground. It struggled to
get back up. It was like it had been pushed down with the weight of
a mountain.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” Qin Xuan saw the coin and understood who was
coming.</p>
<p>“Mister Dollar!” The young people were shocked and happy. They
finally saw the person from the legends alive and in the flesh. It
was especially amazing that it happened at such a pivotal moment.
They were extremely happy.</p>
<p>“Take care of our people,” Han Sen said to Zero and Qin Xuan. He
then stepped forward and disappeared into space.</p>
<p>Although Huangfu Jing and Gu Qingcheng were in danger, Han Sen
did not go and save them. From what he was able to see, their
situation was dangerous but not life-threatening. With their
powers, unless the Break World beasts had a death wish, they could
not really kill them.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not worry too much about Space Garden, so he used
Galaxy Teleportation to reach Outer Sky. The situation there was
far worse than it was for Space Garden.</p>
<p>The Very High were working hard to protect the old and weak
people. They were in the middle of their evacuation efforts. Even
so, they were getting attacked by scary Break World beasts, left,
right, and center. Even the body of the Very High Leader was soaked
in blood. The sky went red. One could not tell if that was the
blood of the Break World beasts or the Very High.</p>
<p>Littleflower, Xie Qing King, and the others were all in the
middle of a bad fight. Xie Qing King was badly bleeding silver
blood. One of his arms fell off. His other fist was waving.</p>
<p>Ning Yue’s peacock clothes had a sword light that shocked the
world. He was fighting a Break World beast that looked like a giant
god bird.</p>
<p>“Ning Yue broke the world! It looks like that mysterious little
green sword is better than I could have possibly comprehended.” Han
Sen was a little bit shocked by what he was witnessing, but he did
not think it was entirely right. With Ning Yue’s mind, even without
the little green sword, he would have broken the world sooner
rather than later.</p>
<p>Littleflower fought a few Break World beasts, but his body had
yet to bleed. He looked to be handling things very capably. Even if
he didn’t break the world, Littleflower was still able to suppress
the Break World beasts thanks to his king spirit body, along with
the world king god’s time and space powers.</p>
<p>Han Yan had a sword spirit with her. A sword light was near her.
She was fending off a Break World beast. Her Super God Spirit body
was related to a spirit body, but this was a sword spirit body and
not a body spirit.</p>
<p>There were too many Break World beasts invading Outer Sky. Han
Sen was quickly able to count 20 Break World beasts there. He did
not know how many more Break World beasts were lurking out
there.</p>
<p>Plus, more Break World beasts were emerging from Outer Sky.
There were more and more arriving.</p>
<p>Han Yufei was holding a strange umbrella. She was fighting a
Break World beast. The power of the Break World beast was stronger
than Han Yufei, but it was unable to harm her.</p>
<p>The umbrella transformed into a laser gun. Right after that, it
turned into a shield that fired wires. It looked like her nifty
umbrella was able to become anything and everything. It morphed to
suit the precise situation she required.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched Mister White come out from Outer Sky. With every
step he took, he left a footprint in the sky. He was not fighting
the Break World beasts. Han Sen did not know what he was doing, but
seeing him there made him feel better about the whole
situation.</p>
<p>“With Mister White here, the Very High should be able to
evacuate Outer Sky successfully.” Han Sen noticed Mister White look
his way. He gave him a salute.</p>
<p>Seeing Mister White nod at him, Han Sen knew there would not be
any more issues. He used Galaxy Teleportation to leave.</p>
<p>Not long after Han Sen left, Mister White walked to the edge of
the Outer Sky’s exit. The ground shook. There was a giant light in
space. It locked onto the entirety of space.</p>
<p>The light formation was made from footprints. It sealed the exit
to Outer Sky and blocked the Break World beasts that were in
there.</p>
<p>The Break World beasts in Outer Sky were furious. They tried to
break the formation of light. When they struck the formation of
light, they were unable to attack it. The formation of light
absorbed their powers. It locked up the area even more.</p>
<p>The Very High and many other elites felt a great swathe of
relief. They looked at Mister White with gratitude. There were many
Break World beasts already in Outer Sky. If they all came out, all
the Very High would die. They would not even be permitted to fall
back.</p>
<p>Sky Palace was undergoing chaos too. The holy gourd vine was
dancing. All the gourds were flying and firing beams of holy light
to destroy everything.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the holy gourd light do that. As he did, he knew
they were possessed by life souls. They had combined with a life
soul and were now breaking the world. Seeing this situation made
him frown.</p>
<p>That was not the only terrifying scene in Sky Palace. White Jade
Jing was revealed in space. It was glowing with a god light. The
five cities and 12 towers were also like that. They were surrounded
by holy air. An evil light went into the sky. Many scary Break
World beasts emerged from there.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a Break World beast that looked like a flying sky
demon woman. She carried a mysterious power with her. Wherever she
went, things turned to jade.</p>
<p>The dungeon that held 72 beasts opened, enabling many scary
beasts to come rushing out. Their presences were very scary. They
had all broken the world.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace will be unable to repel this.” Han Sen saw Sky
Palace Leader and many Sky Palace elites battling. They wanted to
evacuate the students of Sky Palace, but there were too many Sky
Palace students. They had many more than the Very High. It was
difficult to evacuate them. Many Sky Palace students were already
dead.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not hesitate. He teleported to the planet where the
Rebate lived and saw Yisha fighting a Break World beast badly. She
was covering the Rebate people as they left.</p>
