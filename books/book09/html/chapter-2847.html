<p>He didn’t see Han Sen, so Holy Pirate was going to leave.
Suddenly, the lady looked in his direction, which shocked Holy
Pirate.</p>
<p>He was very good at hiding his presence. Even true god elites
might not find him, so how was that little girl able to?</p>
<p>It must be just a coincidence. Holy Pirate looked more closely
at her. She was a Sky girl who looked fairly weak. She did not seem
to be deified, so he felt calm. He knew most elites in Sky Palace,
so it was strange that he had no idea who the girl was.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate teleported in front of the girl. He drew a knife and
placed it against her neck. “Do not scream. If you do, I will kill
you.”</p>
<p>If Han Sen were there, he would mourn Holy Pirate’s mistake for
three seconds. Unknowingly, he had dared to threaten God. Not many
creatures in the universe would dare to do something like that.</p>
<p>God gently blinked as it looked at Holy Pirate and asked, “What
do you want?”</p>
<p>“You just need to tell me where I can find Holy Baby. Do that,
and I will spare your life. Otherwise… Ha-ha…” Holy Pirate coldly
laughed. The light blade in his hand was close to God’s skin.</p>
<p>“Do you really want to know where he is?” God looked at Holy
Pirate with shock.</p>
<p>“You better be honest with me,” Holy Pirate coldly said. “It
will benefit us both.”</p>
<p>God looked at Holy Pirate and asked, “Is that really what you
want?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I asked you, so you better respond
fast. If you keep talking crap, I will cut off your tongue.” Holy
Pirate was annoyed. He did not realize that his annoyance was
coming from deep within.</p>
<p>It was a shame Holy Pirate would have never guessed that God was
occupying Han Sen’s private garden. So he did not really think
about it.</p>
<p>The feeling of being a thief made his heart feel really worried
and tense. That is why he felt annoyed.</p>
<p>God smiled and said, “He is in Nine-Defense Palace.”</p>
<p>Holy Pirate thought the little girl was a bit weird. Despite
being in a situation like that, she was actually able to smile. Her
sense of calmness was not like how other creatures would behave at
a time like this.</p>
<p>The girl’s life was already in his hands, and Holy Pirate’s
arrogance had consumed his common sense. He asked, “What is he
doing in Nine-Defense Palace, and when will he be back?”</p>
<p>“He went to Nine-Defense Palace to hunt xenogeneics. He has been
gone for days. I do not know when he will be back, but I should
imagine that it would be rather soon.” God answered the man much
quicker this time.</p>
<p>When Holy Pirate heard the answer, he frowned. He had heard
about Nine-Defense Palace before. The security of that place was
absurdly tight, so it would be more than difficult for him to go
there.</p>
<p>Nine-Defense Palace’s restrictions would not stop him. When he
looked at the deified elites that guarded Nine-Defense Palace, he
knew getting past them would not be easy.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate looked at God as he asked, “Who frequently comes in
here?”</p>
<p>“When Holy Baby is here, the maid will come to teach him manners
every day,” God replied. “Ever since he went to Nine-Defense
Palace, no one else comes.”</p>
<p>Holy Pirate was happy hearing that. “That is great. I will wait
for him to come back. I will not be going to Nine-Defense
Palace.”</p>
<p>Seeing the girl was cooperating and not screaming her head off,
Holy Pirate withdrew his knife. He looked at God, who appeared to
be a girl, and said, “As long as you listen to what I tell you, I
will not hurt you. If you do something bad, do not blame me for
being cruel to you.”</p>
<p>He looked around, but there was nothing particularly special
about the garden. The girl was happy to watch the fights taking
place on the geno god list. Holy Pirate was not interested in
watching the fights. He took out a box of chess and asked the girl,
“Do you know how to play chess?”</p>
<p>“I know a little,” God said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Good. Play chess with me.” Holy Pirate set up the chessboard
while speaking with the girl.</p>
<p>“Sure.” God smiled even more.</p>
<p>In Nine-Defense Palace, Han Sen released a long sigh and
thought, “My deified genes have finally reached 100, but the fourth
round of the god fights is going to start for me soon. I do not
have the time to be a butterfly yet.”</p>
<p>Han Sen exited Nine-Defense Palace and looked up at the geno god
list in space. He looked at his opponent’s name and sighed. I
really don’t want to go against her.</p>
<p>Yisha still didn’t know that Dollar was Han Sen. She really
wanted to beat Dollar and get her scabbard back. Han Sen thought
Yisha might not fight Dollar, but they were being put against each
other in the geno god list. Han Sen could not avoid fighting
her.</p>
<p>“I guess it is good. I need to put an end to this once and for
all.” Han Sen was not going to underestimate Yisha. Her talents
were extremely good. After she joined Sky Palace, she received
significant support from Sky Palace Leader. Her practice had become
exceptional. She even reached the fourth round. One could see how
excellent her power was.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the geno god list. He perused another section
of it. He noticed the people from Space Garden all lost their
matches in the third round. It was not surprising. After all, they
were only primitive deifieds. To be able to win their first two
rounds was not easy. The enemies they encountered in the third
round were at least larva class. For a primitive class, fighting
enemies that were two classes ahead, which was the larva class in
this case, was too much to ask of them.</p>
<p>Golden Growler was still able to prove his strength. In fact,
Golden Growler had proven indestructible. He had reached his fourth
bout. Aside from Ancient Thunder God, at the beginning of each
match, his opponents threw in the towel and gave up. They did not
even enter the space battleground to confront him.</p>
<p>Aside from Golden Growler, Han Sen saw a few familiar names
doing well too. There was Bai Buyi from the Extreme King, Dragon
One from the Dragon, and Zhang Xuandao from Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The Extreme King has many of its deifieds participating in the
god fights, but why did Bai King not take part? Does he not want
the god spirit’s seat? Han Sen thought that was strange. Even Very
High Leader had taken part in the fights. Bai King not showing up
was quite surprising.</p>
<p>The Extreme Kings are one of the three higher races. That
achievement was not something that boiled down to luck. “This Bai
King is so mysterious. I wonder what he is planning.” Han Sen
couldn’t find a reason for this.</p>
<p>Space flickered with light. It was now his turn to fight Yisha.
Han Sen did not hesitate. He transformed into an adult, wore his
armor, and entered the space battleground.</p>
<p>After reaching the space battleground, Han Sen saw Yisha was
still standing in space. Clearly, she was eager to enter the geno
god list’s battleground immediately.</p>
<p>“Dollar, we finally meet again.” Yisha’s eyes looked very sharp.
She stared at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Knife Queen, why are you still hung up over that small
incident?” Han Sen harshly asked.</p>
<p>“I am not going to stop until I die,” Yisha coldly said.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached his hands into the air. A scabbard that looked
to have been made of inky stone appeared in his hands. It was the
scabbard Han Sen had collected from the Demon statue.</p>
<p>Yisha once said that the scabbard was a relic that belonged to
the Rebate. From what Han Sen knew, the alpha of the Rebate was a
woman. The knife mind left behind inside the scabbard belonged to a
man, so Han Sen had been suspicious about her claim.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already learned about the knife mind inside the
scabbard. The scabbard did not mean much to him anymore.</p>
<p>“How about we make a deal? If you win, I will give this back to
you.” Han Sen was holding the scabbard like he was holding a
knife.</p>
