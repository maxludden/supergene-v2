    <p>
      Han Sen brought Six Paths out of the Godlight Tunnel. He examined his
      wounds and noticed he had been injured badly. Fortunately, the body of an
      emperor was strong and his life was not in any danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao took Yu Xuan with her and left. She stared at Han Sen the whole
      time, and her look could be best described as complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, however, Han Sen did not have the time to kill them. And even
      if he did, he realized it would be pointless. If he ever hoped to kill
      them, he’d have to do it so they’d never come back, in a one-and-done
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Little Lion was already showing extreme loyalty to Han Sen. He kept
      on calling him boss, casually, as if he had been born to serve him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since he met Cheap Sheep, he didn’t like being called a boss, so he
      wanted his subordinates to refer to him as chairman, as others often did.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, should we leave now?” Little Fairy was in a rush to ask Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy did not enter the Godlight Tunnel because, according to her,
      she wanted to level up to super entirely by herself. And she hadn’t come
      to God’s Ruin for the tunnel, either. It was all about the relic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leveling up through the tunnel offered different benefits. It was
      difficult to determine which was better, and people were always of a
      different mind in choosing which was the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen brought Bao’er and the others with him. Jade Little Lion wished to
      follow, and so Han Sen did not decline. Having a super creature like that
      by his side could also prove beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Little Lion told the other creatures to remain by the tunnel and
      protect the place. Then, he followed after Han Sen to visit another place
      in God’s Ruin. ( B oxnovel.c om )
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen rode atop Starsea Beast’s back and sometimes brought out an item
      or two to play with. They were the things he brought with him from the
      crystallizer bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he entered the Godlight Tunnel earlier, he felt as if something was
      beckoning him. He lost that sensation when he entered the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he no longer felt it after coming back out, so Han Sen thought the
      item that had pulled his attention had to be one of the items he had
      brought with him. But when Han Sen looked at the items, they all looked
      like women’s things. There was nothing particularly special about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s those Black Seahorses again,” Little Fairy shouted, from her
      position up front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked to the sky. The seahorses were pulling a big chimenea, as
      they always did. But this time, Han Sen was surprised. The flames of the
      object were extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those Black Seahorses keep pulling that black chimenea around the ruin
      constantly. I wonder what they want.” Han Sen was just talking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Little Lion quickly said, “My father came to this ruin himself when
      he was a cub. And he saw the Black Seahorses with a chimenea back then,
      too. He told me not to get too close to them because each one is as strong
      as a super demigod creature.”
    </p>
    <p>“Of course we know they are strong!” Little Fairy lifted her lips.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Jade Little Lion with surprise and said, “Wasn’t White
      Lion King a born-berserk super creature?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Many people believe he was, but that’s not actually true. He leveled up
      to achieve the strength he possesses.” While speaking about White Lion
      King, Jade Little Lion looked proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen nodded and did not say anything. He looked at the Black Seahorses
      pulling the big chimenea. The Black Seahorses eventually slid down the
      side of a mountain and disappeared from sight.
    </p>
    <p>A period of time passed and they had yet to re-emerge.</p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go see what they are doing.” Han Sen was quite interested in the
      chimenea. The big chimenea was too cold to approach normally, but its blue
      fire had now subsided. If he managed to get close enough, he might be able
      to catch a glimpse of what was inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy thought the chimenea was the relic, so she agreed they should
      go and take a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Little Lion looked hesitant, but if Han Sen was going, he knew he’d
      have to go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ( B oxnovel.c om ) The party then went towards where the chimenea had set
      down. The mountain wasn’t the biggest in the ruin, but it was still around
      ten thousand meters high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, there were none of those strange flowers to be wary about.
      They all climbed to the peak with ease, free of any danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the peak, they noticed that behind the mountain was
      another mountain and peak to climb. This mountain went up into the clouds.
      They could actually see the Black Seahorses pulling the chimenea up the
      slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Little Fairy looked at each other, and then they followed
      after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peak was just like a normal glacier poking its head above the clouds.
      They couldn’t see the Black Seahorses once they got there, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent half the day climbing into the clouds, and what they saw was
      quite surprising once they got through. It was a sea of clouds. There were
      so many clouds all about, it was like an idyllic view of heaven. Another
      peak poked its head from out of that cloudy ocean, too. And then, there
      was a giant icy ship floating in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Seahorses pulled the chimenea up to the highest peak, then
      stopped. It was like they were waiting for something.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      Not long after, the chains of the seahorses were opened. The eleven of
      them shouted happily, bobbed quickly down the hill, and then leaped down
      into the clouds. They were like fish having just escaped a net. They swam
      very happily in the sea of clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, a group of Ice Seahorses approached. They were the first
      type of Seahorses that Han Sen’s group had caught a glimpse of back in the
      Frozen Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eleven of Black Seahorses bobbed over to them, obviously keen to meet
      with the Ice Seahorses. The bigger seahorses crossed their necks with the
      necks of the other seahorses, like old couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smaller Ice Seahorses were around them, all swimming happily. They
      were like one big, happy family.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen saw them meet that way, Bao’er looked over at the chimenea
      with curiosity. She jumped out of Han Sen’s arms and ran over to the peak
      it was sitting upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. He wished to call her back, but he didn’t want to
      spook and possibly alert the Black Seahorses. Han Sen was curious about
      the big chimenea, so he followed Bao’er to that same peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy and Jade Little Lion also followed from behind. They all
      snuck up the peak from the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Seahorses were tying up their necks with the necks of the other
      seahorses, and as a result, they were unable to spot them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big chimenea was not lit, and it wasn’t emitting any frosty air.
      Everyone went over to the peak, and Bao’er leaped atop the chimenea. Then,
      she stuffed her head inside the chimney. She looked around with great
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was now right behind her, so he picked Bao’er up. He pulled her
      off the chimenea and then put his own head near the exhaust. He wanted to
      get a look inside the chimenea, too
