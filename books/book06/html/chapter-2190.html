<h2>Taking the Legacy</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2190</h3>

<p>Yisha had been a very special person to the Rebate, so there was
no need to worry about the funeral too much. Narrow Moon performed
the services very well, and all Han Sen had to do was cooperate
with their rituals.</p>
<p>Yisha’s death impacted the Rebate a great deal. It affected them
deeply, in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>As one of the two highest ranked individuals of the Rebate,
Yisha’s death made them far weaker. It also altered the
distribution of benefits and resources that various important
Rebate received.</p>
<p>Due to these changes, the biggest negative ended up impacting
Yisha’s student Han Sen.</p>
<p>When Han Sen went to Night River King to confirm what of Yisha’s
legacy would be left to him, he found himself frowning
continually.</p>
<p>Night River King provided Han Sen with a list, and there were
very few items on that roster with any actual value. Furthermore,
Yisha’s home planet of Planet Blade was taken by the elders.</p>
<p>Han Sen was only allowed to claim Yisha’s personal items and
belongings. Having expected this treatment, though, Han Sen was
prepared to accept the verdict in silence. Now that Yisha was gone,
Han Sen was back to being a proper outsider, and the Rebate
wouldn’t be willing to give anything of theirs to someone like
him.</p>
<p>“Knife was the Cold Palace guardian, but you replaced her. And
now that she is dead, it is down to us to select a new guardian for
Cold Palace. A real one. Thanks for your help in the meantime, but
you can now give us back the tablet. And this is the list featuring
all her legacy items you may claim. You will need to sign it,”
Night River King said coldly, peering right at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Night River King wanted the Cold Palace guardian’s position.
This time, things were going more his way. He would indeed become
the guardian in Han Sen’s stead.</p>
<p>Han Sen met Night River King’s eyes and held out the guardian
tablet.</p>
<p>Night River King stared at the guardian tablet as it was passed
toward him, and his eyes sparkled. The geno art he practiced was
aligned quite well with the boons that the deified toad could
impart. He’d be able to use the ice and moon powers of the deified
toad to become half-deified in only a few centuries.</p>
<p>“I can give you the tablet, and I will sign the form as you
asked, but I have one request to make.” Han Sen did not pass the
tablet to Night River King just yet. As he spoke, he held it
tightly.</p>
<p>“This is a decision from the Full Moon Office. You aren’t out
shopping, kid. You can’t haggle with me for a better deal,” Night
River King said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored Night River King’s jab, and while fiddling with
the tablet, he said, “Planet Blade is where my master used to live.
I hope I will be able to visit Planet Blade during the times that I
miss her. I would like permission to access Planet Blade whenever I
fancy.”</p>
<p>“I cannot permit this. Planet Blade belongs to the elders, and
this is known to the public of Narrow Moon. People cannot just go
there willy-nilly. Not even I can go there without proper
permission,” Night River King said seriously.</p>
<p>Night River King certainly could have provided Han Sen access to
the planet, but he didn’t want to help Han Sen in any way.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak. He merely continued to play with the
tablet. He didn’t sign the paper, either. All he did was smile at
Night River King.</p>
<p>Night River King frowned and retreated into thought for a
moment. “Okay, fine. I will help. I will go and talk to the elders
on your behalf, and I will see if I can get you permission.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need you to talk. I need you to add that permission
onto this list.” Han Sen stared at Night River King icily as he
spoke.</p>
<p>“That is impossible. Don’t push me too far now,” Night River
King growled.</p>
<p>“Without that permission added to this list, you can find
someone else to sign it. But you won’t see my name on it,” Han Sen
said simply.</p>
<p>Night River King looked gloomy, but he didn’t look mad just yet.
He turned to Han Sen and said, “You can only enter Planet Blade.
You cannot touch anything there, then.”</p>
<p>Night River King didn’t want to cause any trouble for himself.
After all, he and the elders had already taken many things that, by
all rights, should have now belonged to Han Sen. If Han Sen didn’t
sign the agreement, that unfairness would get way too much
exposure.</p>
<p>“I only miss her. I do not want to take anything from there,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Night River King amended the list for Han Sen without saying a
word. He provided Han Sen with permission to access Planet Blade
freely. When he was finished, Han Sen signed it. He confirmed his
acceptance of the measly legacy, and then he passed the tablet to
Night River King.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t look at the list. Night River King would only
have given him whatever the Rebate were willing to part with. They
had taken everything they wanted, and they had left what they
didn’t. There was no point in looking at the stuff.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen packing up Yisha’s things, Night River King
laughed inside and thought to himself, “What is the point to get
permission to go to Planet Blade? You will never receive any more
resources from the Rebate.”</p>
<p>Han Sen took Yisha’s legacy items back to Planet Eclipse with
him. He had gained many treasures, but not a single one of them was
King class. The highest were two Duke treasures that weren’t even
useful to him.</p>
<p>The other things were worth nothing, and they would not benefit
him in the least, either.</p>
<p>“Is that all she possessed as a half-deified being?” Han Sen
laughed darkly. He thought the whole of Narrow Moon must have
looted Yisha’s warehouse already. They had only left him with the
meaningless scrap.</p>
<p>Even so, there was nothing Han Sen could do about it. The only
person that could back him up was gone, so there was no way he’d
ever get his hands on those things.</p>
<p>Yisha seemed to have known that, though. And that was why she
told Han Sen to let go.</p>
<p>“I will let go, only if I should. But I will not let go of
anything that belongs to me by right.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the items in storage in his warehouse on Planet
Eclipse. He took out the few useful items, some of which were
things Yisha always made use of.</p>
<p>Yisha’s death had crushed the Rebate, but people like Night
River King had benefitted a great deal from her passing. They were
probably happy about what had happened.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, are we staying here in Narrow Moon?” Ji Qing
asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Of course we are. Planet Eclipse has a fair amount of
resources, and if we were to leave, we’d be allowing others to
benefit.” Han Sen smiled</p>
<p>“But Night River King and the others keep trying to undermine
you. The coming days on Planet Eclipse won’t go well for you,” Ji
Qing said.</p>
<p>“It is hard to say who will have a difficult time and who will
not,” Han Sen murmured, squinting his eyes in thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on leaving Narrow Moon. He didn’t like the
idea of being kicked out; he’d leave on his own terms.</p>
<p>The fifteenth day of the month rolled around, and Night River
King went to Cold Palace for the first time since accepting the
position of Cold Palace guardian. He merrily trekked up to the
stone house and settled himself on the porch as the Cold Palace
guardian.</p>
<p>“With this Cold Palace guardian position, I might become
half-deified in a mere two centuries. I will be able to replace
Knife in Narrow Moon.” Night River King grinned at the thought. He
held the Cold Palace guardian tablet so tightly that his hands
began to shake. He had waited for this opportunity for so long.</p>
<p>Time passed, and midnight came. Night River King looked at the
stone door, waiting for the deified toad to emerge.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Night River King saw a shadow walking across the
mountain. He was shocked. Planet Blade was taken, so no one should
have been wandering around. And on top of that, it was a restricted
area.</p>
