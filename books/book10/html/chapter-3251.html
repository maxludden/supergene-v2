<p>“If I were you, I would not take another step forward,” a voice
bellowed from the sky.</p>
<p>Zhen Xia and the others raised their heads to look. They saw
nine Holy Wen White Deer drawing a carriage. They had just ripped
through space to arrive. They came down and stopped next to Zhen
Xia. The voice came from within the jade carriage.</p>
<p>“Greetings, My Prince. It is fortunate I am not embarrassing
you. I managed to get the ice jade evil lady gene egg.” Zhen Xia
quickly bowed before the carriage. He took out the gene egg and
placed it down before the carriage’s door.</p>
<p>The carriage door opened. A beautiful man, clothed in white, was
sitting inside. A maid made her exit and collected the gene egg.
She presented it to the handsome man.</p>
<p>“The ice jade evil lady gene egg.” Chu Yuan took the gene egg.
He used one hand to hold the gene egg and a finger to break the
gene egg. The shattered ice fell from his hand. It became a green
light and disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhen Xia’s face changed. “Mister, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Chu Yuan looked at Zhen Xia and coldly said, “You have already
done a half-decent service. With your power, you have remained
undercover in Xuan Mi Zong for so long and not been noticed while
also being able to bring back important messages. It is impressive.
You are not bad. You have done some good deeds.”</p>
<p>“Mister, are you saying… Is the gene egg fake?” Zhen Xia’s face
changed.</p>
<p>“If you thought Tian Jing was a person who was dying and got
close to her, you would be a dead man,” Chu Yuan calmly said.</p>
<p>Zhen Xia did not believe him. He looked at Tian Jing, who had
been injured. She was already standing straight. Her weak presence
was fully recovered, and she no longer looked angry.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder you are the Chu Kingdom’s first mister, Chu
Yuan,” Tian Jing coldly said as she wiped the blood away.</p>
<p>Zhen Xia looked awful. He did not expect to have been played by
Tian Jing like this. He apologized to Chu Yuan, saying, “I am
sorry, Mister. This is my mistake. I delayed your business. Please
punish me.”</p>
<p>Chu Yuan was not going to blame Zhen Xia for this. He smiled and
said, “Being tricked by a woman is no big deal. If you have never
been tricked by a woman before, that likely means you are one of
two things. You are either a monk or a useless fool. You have done
well. You surpassed my expectations. When I return to my Chu
family, I will reward you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mister,” Zhen Xia said with a hasty bow.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go back first?” Chu Yuan sat in the jade
carriage. He waved his hand and made Zhen Xia go back a little. He
turned to Tian Jing and asked, “Miss Tian, you are the future
leader of Xuan Mi Zong, are you not? You are in a love triangle,
yet you broke it so quickly. I admire you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliments, Mister Chu.” Tian Jing felt bad,
but she did not make herself look like she was feeling anything
particular.</p>
<p>She knew now was not the time to feel sad about being betrayed.
There was an enemy in front of her. If she did not sort this out,
she and Bao’er were sure to be killed.</p>
<p>Her body’s power increased. A pair of wings appeared behind Tian
Jing. Her hands quickly turned to jade stone. They became Xuan
jade. Chu Yuan was sitting in the carriage watching Tian Jing. He
was not going to stop her. He smiled and said, “The legends claim
the Xuan Mi Zong have a unique skill that is so amazing it is the
most magical gene skill ever. If you are the Xuan Mi Zong’s
inheritor, I suppose you can show us what it is like.”</p>
<p>“I thought about doing that too.” Tian Jing held Bao’er while
her other hand became Xuan jade. She pushed forward. Her hands
produced some waves. Some weird symbols were in the waves. It was
like a door of waves.</p>
<p>When the wavy door appeared, Tian Jing flapped her wings and
held Bao’er. Like lightning, she went toward the wavy door.
Suddenly, the wavy door was gone.</p>
<p>Chu Yuan was sitting in the jade carriage. He had watched
everything happen, including how Tian Jing and Bao’er had
disappeared. His face did not move a muscle.</p>
<p>Zhen Xia was in a panic. He knew how amazing the door technique
was. Traveling through space was not hard, but Tian Jing used all
she had. She probably used the door technique to teleport beyond
the ice fields.</p>
<p>Chu Yuan had claimed he had done well, but Zhen Xia knew he was
being too confident. He had messed the entire ploy up. If Tian Jing
ran again, this would all be for nothing.</p>
<p>“Mister, please allow me to get Tian Jing back so that I may fix
my mistake,” Zhen Xia said with a bow.</p>
<p>Chu Yuan laughed. He shook his fan and coldly said, “I said you
did well, so that means you did well. There is no need to worry
about it. As for Tian Jing, she will be back.”</p>
<p>Tian Jing had used her door technique to traverse space. When
she came out from the door, she noticed there was a jade carriage
that had nine Holy Wen White Deer in front of</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>She looked around and noticed she was still where she had been.
She hadn’t been able to leave the ice fields. She did not even
leave her spot.</p>
<p>Tian Jing’s face changed. Her Xuan jade hand cast many more of
those wavy doors. She held Bao’er and entered each one.</p>
<p>No matter how many times Tian Jing used her door technique, she
appeared before the jade carriage every time. She looked absolutely
awful.</p>
<p>Chu Yuan waved his fan as he said, “Miss Tian, do not keep
wasting your time and effort. Your door technique is great, but it
will not work in my god garden bai sema. You also won’t be able to
form a door to the underworld.”</p>
<p>Tian Jing knew wasting time to use her door technique was
pointless. She looked up into the sky. A holy light was visible for
a hundred miles away. The holy light came from the jade carriage.
It came from Chu Yuan like a holy son.</p>
<p>“The Chu Kingdom’s first mister really is so strong,” Tian Jing
said. Her Xuan jade arm let out flashing waves. The spells cast
were glowing across her arm, making her arm power stronger. When it
reached its maximum, she swung a punch at Chu Yuan.</p>
<p>The waves in front of Tian Jing’s fist turned into a wavy door.
The fist power went in and was gone. In the next second, the wavy
door was behind Chu Yuan. It looked scary with all of its light.
With that distance, not even a God Spirit would have been able to
dodge it. Chu Yuan wasn’t planning on dodging. With a holy light,
which was what he sought to use, he looked like a god. The Xuan
light struck his god light and became nothing. It was not able to
hurt him. It did not even ruffle his clothing.</p>
<p>“Miss Tian, that is enough.” Chu Yuan looked at Tian Jing as she
felt a scary power emerge. Her body was suppressed by nothingness.
Her legs started to shake. She could not withstand the scary
pressure.</p>
<p>Tian Jing used the best of her powers. No matter how she used
them, she could not erase the power of that pressure. Her legs
writhed.</p>
<p>“Chu Yuan is scarier than the legends about him.” Tian Jing was
shocked. She knew things were not going to fare well for her.</p>
