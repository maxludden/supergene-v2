  As everyone watched in confusion, the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace exploded, and something flew out into the air.

“What is that?” Han Sen was shocked. He looked at Yun Suyi, never having heard of anything like this happening before.

“I… I don’t know…” Yun Suyi was just as stunned as the rest. She had never heard of a physical item emerging from the sign that held the words of Sky Palace.

All the rest of the Sky were amazed, as well. The last thing they had expected was for an object to fly out of that sign. They stared at it blankly.

The thing that flew out of the sign looked like an elephant. It was white like jade, but only one foot long. The elephant’s tusks appeared to be made of crystal.

Everyone looked at that small elephant in befuddlement. They had no idea why it had suddenly appeared there.

The defensive systems of Sky Palace were rock-solid. It would be impossible for them to be unaware of a xenogeneic hiding out inside that big sign.

The small white elephant flew over until it was right in front of Han Yan. It then expanded, growing to the size of a mammoth.

Strangely, after the white elephant appeared, the meaning behind the two words of Sky Palace disappeared. The sign went back to normal.

The white elephant reached out its trunk and wrapped it around Han Yan’s body.

Han Sen’s muscles tensed. He thought the white elephant was going to harm his sister, and he leaped forward. After he took a step forward, though, he realized that the white elephant was just lifting her up to sit on its back.

Once Han Yan was astride its back, the white elephant turned around and headed deeper into Sky Palace.

Seeing that the elephant wasn’t a threat, Han Sen felt instantly relieved. But still, he made sure to follow closely behind them. Many Sky elders also hurried forward to examine the strange white elephant as it walked farther into Sky Palace.

It was so weird. No one had known that the Sky Palace sign had a white elephant hiding out in it. The situation was so odd that it was hard to believe.

Even Sky Palace Leader came down for a closer look. He ransacked his mind for an explanation of where the white elephant had come from, but he couldn’t come up with one.

Just by feeling the white elephant’s presence, he could tell that it was a deified creature. A deified creature had been hiding out in that sign, and no one in Sky Palace had known. That was simply embarrassing for the other deifieds inside Sky Palace.

But they knew immediately that the white elephant must have a long history with Sky Palace, so no one tried to attack it. They followed the white elephant, keen to see what it might do.

“Mister Leader, what is this White Elephant?” Han Sen was still worried about Han Yan, and so he asked Sky Palace Leader once the man arrived.

“Don’t worry. I will assure her safety. I won’t allow her to get hurt,” Sky Palace Leader said as he continued to walk.

When Han Sen heard him say that, he relaxed a little, but he still didn’t feel calm. He felt even more worried. That was because it sounded as if not even Sky Palace Leader understood what the white elephant was and where it had come from.

Although this entire scenario sounded a bit unbelievable-in which a deified creature had resided in Sky Palace without anyone knowing about its existence—this was actually happening.

Han Sen gritted his teeth and followed the white elephant. The white elephant showed no sign of being hostile, though. And it was moving forward at a rather slow pace. Han Yan looked down, observing her mount quizzically. While she was surprised to find herself atop its back, she hadn’t been hurt in any way.

“Little Yan, are you okay?” Han Sen asked as he followed the white elephant.

“I’m okay. Is this some sort of induction ceremony for Sky Palace?” Han Yan asked with curiosity.

“Can you get off its back?” Han Sen asked.

“Yes. Do you want me to come down?” Han Yan asked.

“Yes, come down for now,” Han Sen said.

Han Yan flew off of the white elephant’s back. But as soon as she broke contact with the creature, the white elephant’s trunk snatched her and made her sit down again.

The white elephant didn’t hurt her, however. It placed her down gently and resumed its walk.

“Let her sit there for now. I promise not an ounce of harm will befall a single hair on her pretty head,” Sky Palace Leader said with a squint of his eyes.

A white elephant had flown out of the Sky Palace sign. That was mysterious, to say the least. All of the Sky Palace students thought this was amazing, and they were curious about what the white elephant was.

But most of the students were eventually stopped and prohibited from following the white elephant. Only the elders and other leaders of Sky Palace were allowed to follow beyond that point.

The white elephant carried Han Yan through the Sky Palace hall. Then, they came to the gardens of Sky Palace.

This was where the rulers of Sky Palace had lived down through history. Now, it belonged to the man who was walking next to Han Sen. Ordinary people weren’t permitted entry.

Han Sen and the others followed the white elephant in. It was like a natural garden, with mountains and the smell of grass. It was like a fairy’s grove. Rare xenogeneic plants were scattered about here and there. Just the sight of them made Han Sen want to get out his knife and start cutting

The big white elephant carried Han Yan to the back of the garden. They went to a wall with a small pond beside it. The wall had two words that were roughly engraved: “Outer Sky.”

Those two words were jaggedly carved. Even though Han Sen didn’t know much about calligraphy, he knew those words had been written by a young man.

But how could a young man have made an inscription in this place? That was where the rulers of Sky Palace rested. Other people weren’t permitted entry, and they surely couldn’t leave evidence of their presence.

The white elephant walked in front of the mountain wall, then lowered its trunk into the water. As the water swirled around its trunk, the elephant seemed to be feeling around for something.

Everyone looked at the big white elephant, having no idea what it was doing. After a while, the white elephant lifted its trunk from the water. It was holding something. The object was a box made of jade, and it was a foot long. The onlookers glanced at each other, unsure what the appearance of this random box signified.Sky Palace Leader looked at the jade box and frowned. He had an idea of what the box might be, but he wasn’t sure.

The white elephant lifted its trunk and passed the jade box to Han Yan. And then, it lay down next to the pond and closed its eyes. It looked as if it had gone to sleep.

“Han Yan, come over here,” Sky Palace Leader said to Han Yan, who had just received that box.

Han Yan saw Han Sen nodding. So, she got off of the white elephant. This time, the white elephant didn’t respond. It allowed Han Yan to move away with the box in her hands.

“Open the box,” Sky Palace Leader told Han Yan.

“Palace Leader, will there be danger inside the jade box?” Han Sen asked worriedly.

“No.” Sky Palace Leader shook his head, a strange expression on his face.

“Is this…” Yun Changkong’s face changed. He seemed to come to a realization, and he looked at the jade box in astonishment.
