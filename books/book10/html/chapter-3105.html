<h3>Chapter 3105</h3>

<p>“Mister Crown Prince.” Lu San Zhi saw the young man and was
shocked. He quickly jumped off of the male lion and kneeled before
the crown prince.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all of the Thunder Lion Riders did the same and
kneeled. They all bowed before the young man.</p>
<p>the young man did not care for their show. He walked in front of
Han Sen and tugged at his hand. “Han Sen, why did you come to Jade
Wall City and not inform me? If I had not heard about you beating
up Dou Tian Yu at Feng Fei Fei’s party, I would not have known that
you were in Jade Wall City.”</p>
<p>The young man was Qin Kingdom’s crown prince, Qin Bai. He was to
be the successor, the future king of the Qin Kingdom. The king only
had Qin Bai as a son, so it was only natural for him to be the
destined king.</p>
<p>“The kingdom’s palace is not someplace any commoner can go. Even
if I wanted to look for you, I would have been unable to enter.”
Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“I see. That is my mistake. Let’s go to the palace together
now.” Qin Bai pulled Han Sen to leave with him. He was like a big
child.</p>
<p>In fact, he was a child. He was only around 13 years old.
Ordinary kids had fun at that age.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, this guy is involved with hiding Sacrifice
Copper,” Lu San Zhi quickly said. “I need to take him to the king’s
guard’s department for investigation.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean hiding Sacrifice Copper? I want him. Can I
have him?” Qin Bai looked at Lu San Zhi with annoyance.</p>
<p>Lu San Zhi quickly bowed and said, “Please forgive me, Mister
Crown Prince. Sacrifice Copper is important for this kingdom. It is
a matter of the kingdom’s reputation. The kingdom has a rule that
states whoever stores Sacrifice Copper is in big trouble. To hold
more than one kilogram results in execution. There are at least 100
kilograms of Sacrifice Copper here. His entire family should be
slain.”</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>Before Lu San Zhi finished speaking, Qin Bai slapped him across
the face. Lu San Zhi could have dodged the strike, but he did not
dare evade the prince. He didn’t use any power to fight Qin Bai
either. He accepted the slap. His face went red. Five clearly
defined fingerprints were on his cheeks.</p>
<p>“I am doing stuff. Do I need you to teach me?” Qin Bai looked
angry as he stared at him. He had an overbearing face that showed
he was the boss. He was the poster child of a spoiled brat.</p>
<p>The slap made Han Sen happy. Feng Fei Fei was happier too. She
had not suspected that Han Sen had a relation with the crown
prince, Qin Bai.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, the kingdom has its laws, and the family
has family rules. The Sacrifice Copper…” Lu San Zhi did not dare
fight back. He kneeled in front of him, but he did not scurry away.
He still wished to speak.</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>Qin Bai slapped him a second time across his other cheek. This
time, he slapped him even harder. Lu San Zhi’s mouth was full of
blood.</p>
<p>Lu San Zhi opened his mouth, still wishing to speak, but he
could not get a word out before Qin Bai smacked him again. The
things he wanted to say were forbidden by a slap and a face full of
blood.</p>
<p>Qin Bai madly shouted at Lu San Zhi, “This Sacrifice Copper was
put in his house by me! Are you going to kill me too? Are you going
to kill my entire family?”</p>
<p>Lu San Zhi’s face changed. His body shook. His back developed a
cold sweat that soaked into his clothes. He knew the Sacrifice
Copper did not belong to Han Sen or Feng Fei Fei, but he also knew
it did not belong to Qin Bai.</p>
<p>After Qin Bai said that, he did not say anything to the
contrary. To kill the king’s family was not some sort of crime that
the king’s guard leader could commit. Not even a general could
commit a crime like that.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare,” Lu San Zhi said. “I did not know the
Sacrifice Copper belonged to the Crown Prince. Please forgive me.”
He swallowed the blood in his mouth and kowtowed before Qin Bai. He
could not afford to commit a crime like that.</p>
<p>“If you knew you were wrong, then get lost! You are all
useless.” Qin Bai did not even look at Lu San Zhi. He coldly
grunted like a tyrant.</p>
<p>Lu San Zhi was furious. He thought he could capture Han Sen and
Feng Fei Fei in one fell swoop. He thought he could take them back
to the king’s guard department.</p>
<p>He was to return empty-handed. All he had managed to get was a
swollen face. He could not take back the 100 kilograms of Sacrifice
Copper either.</p>
<p>Now, Qin Bai was there, and he took the Sacrifice Copper. There
was no way he could take Han Sen. He bowed before Qin Bai and
ferociously stared at Han Sen. He gathered his Thunder Lion Rider
soldiers and left.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei and the others were as much shocked as they were
delighted. They thought they were going to be killed. Who would
have known that the very famous and spoiled crown prince would
swoop in out of nowhere to protect them all and beat up someone
like Lu San Zhi in front of everyone? They thought it was amazing
Han Sen knew why many people wanted to become king and why everyone
wanted to become a tyrant. Being a tyrant or a bad king was better
than being a good king.</p>
<p>A spoiled crown prince like Qin Bai could do whatever he wanted.
He was allowed to be as spoiled as he wanted to be. He could have
all the goods and not care about how others felt. Still, what Qin
Bai did there made Han Sen and the others very happy. He wouldn’t
mention anything about him being a loser.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are safe now. Please come back to the palace with
me. You are here at a perfect time. You must avenge me.” Qin Bai
tugged at Han Sen with major excitement as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, what happened today is over, but this is
not over,” Han Sen said with a sigh. “I am afraid I cannot come to
the palace with you yet.”</p>
<p>“What else do you need to do? I thought I sorted out the
Sacrifice Copper issue for you. Lu San Zhi won’t dare trouble you
again.” Qin Bai was surprised.</p>
<p>“Lu San Zhi is just a small character that does the bidding of
others. The person that wants me dead is the king’s guard general,
Steel Scene.” Han Sen explained what happened to him.</p>
<p>“Gong Shu Zhi should be dead by now. You should have killed him.
Now, he has run to Steel Scene, who is in Ice Snow City. This is
very bad.” Qin Bai looked troubled.</p>
<p>Although he could do whatever he wanted to with his authority,
it was not as if he was unafraid of things. There were still some
things he feared. Aside from the emperor himself, there were a few
people who frightened him. Qin Bai was scared of a few grand
teachers. They were the only ones who dared to hit him, so he was
afraid of them.</p>
<p>Regarding Steel Scene, he had quite the position in the
hierarchy of the Qin Kingdom. Although he did not know much about
things, he knew how scary that person was. He might not have feared
him, but he would not treat Steel Scene the same way he treated Lu
San Zhi.</p>
<p>He thought about it. Qin Bai suddenly looked quite cocky. He
said, “That is fine. You and Feng Fei Fei can go to the palace with
me. I do not think Steel Scene will try and get at you by going to
the palace.”</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei and the others heard his words. She displayed a wry
smile. A place like a palace was not somewhere a commoner could
waltz in and out of. Even if Qin Bai wanted them to go there, they
could not stay there for long. Otherwise, the other superiors
eventually would have objected to their presence. They might have
even given him a hard time or said things like “They don’t know
anything.’</p>
<p>“Mister Crown Prince, this has to be sorted out sooner or
later,” Han Sen said. “If you keep navigating around the issue, it
only delays what is inevitable. I do not need to go to the palace,
but can I ask you for a favor?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just tell me! If I can help you out, I will definitely do
so.” Qin Bai patted himself on the chest as he spoke.</p>
