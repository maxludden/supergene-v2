  The Dolek was cut in half but did not fall. Both sides of its body started to writhe until they were two smaller-sized Doleks.

"Ha! Ha! A Dolek cannot be killed so easily. Cutting their body means duplicating their numbers."

"Space Garden has never had a deified. It is normal to expect people that come out to have no experience with such things. I bet she has never even heard of a Dolek before. Otherwise, why would she cut open the Dolek's body like that? She did not know that a Dolek's body, when cut open, will split into two. Now, she will be forced to fight two Doleks, and its power won't have been split in half. The two Doleks will have the same power as one, fully composed Dolek. That means she has one more opponent to deal with."

"Yeah. Doleks had the scariest splitting power back in the day. They developed like crazy in the universe. They created many big disasters, and Sky Palace was forced to wipe them out. I cannot believe some have remained, and they have become deified. Encountering an opponent like this is bad luck for Queen."

Huangfu Jing did not move. She saw the Dolek get split in two. She again lifted her long legs and swept them across the Doleks to cut them in half through the waist.

The Doleks that had been split into four from two were smaller again. There were now four Doleks, and they were roaring as they went for Huangfu Jing.

Huangfu Jing was quiet. Her legs were like a blade that kept lashing out. She cut open all of the Doleks before her, and the number of Doleks kept increasing.

"This Queen cannot be saved. Can she not tell that the more Doleks she breaks open, the more Doleks there will be, and the more danger she will be in?"

"What can she do? Back then, Sky Palace sent out butterfly class fire element elites to incinerate the Doleks completely. Obviously, Queen is not fire element. She cannot deal with that many Doleks."

"You are right. Unless there is an elemental weakness to exploit or absolute power to suppress, a deified elite cannot do anything to defeat a Dolek."

Huangfu Jing's legs were like blades. She repeatedly kept slicing the Doleks, and the Doleks continued to grow in number. Their power did not decrease. Her situation was becoming more difficult.

When everyone thought Huangfu Jing was surrounded, and the only path forward was one of loss, people saw her suddenly vanish from her position.

In the next moment, all of the creatures in the world saw a fabulous killing show. Huangfu Jing's body kept flashing through the space battleground. She looked like a killing machine that could teleport. Wherever she went, Dolek bodies kept getting cut open.

The number of Doleks kept increasing. No matter how many Doleks appeared, to Huangfu Jing, it was futile. She kept appearing wherever she wanted. She was able to kill every single Dolek around her.

It was like being in front of a tiger. No matter how big the sheep flock was, it could not harm a tiger. They would all be killed.

"Infinite teleport... There is no time pausing... Even a true god cannot have this power, right?" Dragon Eight was shocked.

"If she does not have that talent, not even a true god can accomplish what she is doing," Dragon One confidently said.

"This Queen, where does she come from? She has a scary and infinite teleportation power and the perfect killing skills of a machine. She is a killing queen born to fight. On the battleground, even if there were millions of armies, they would die if she wanted them to." Ordinary creatures were even more shocked by what they were seeing. With the thrilling performance and stunning appearance of Huangfu Jing, they were blown away.

"What a shame. If she had not encountered a Dolek, with her infinite teleportation skill and perfect killing skills, even if she had met a transmutation deified creature, there would be no chance of her losing." Barr's eyes turned bright. He was thinking about the possibility of himself earning a teleportation power like that. He wondered about using his Destroyed Skill with it. He could be a moving nuke. He could blow himself up wherever he wanted to.

"That is a shame, but I do not think she is one of the Flower Gods," Dia Robber said. He looked at her with confusion.

After thinking a moment, Barr said, "I have heard the Space Garden was taken over by Han Sen. She must be a crystallizer like Han Sen."

"I did not expect there were other geniuses among the crystallizers aside from just Han Sen," Dia Robber replied.

"How could you forget so easily?" Barr asked. "Han Sen has that blessing power. It does not matter how weak the genes of a crystallizer are. After being blessed by him, it is easy for them to become deified." He was one of the people who had been benefitted by Han Sen's blessings. He knew how amazing that skill truly was.

"You are right," Dia Robber said with a nod.

Many people were thinking the same thing as Barr and Dia Robber. They were all thinking about how they might get Han Sen to start blessing their people. If they could, they wanted Han Sen to bless every single one of their people.

It was a shame Han Sen was said to be hiding in Space Garden. Entering Space Garden was nearly impossible. The three high races could not enter there. It was even harder for one of the other races.

Many people wanted to go for Holy Pirate since only he could travel through the universe freely. But Holy Pirate seemed to have disappeared. No one was able to find him.

Huangfu Jing's teleportation killing was beautiful. To the Dolek that could split infinitely, it was not useful. No matter how many times she killed them, there would only be more Doleks created.

Seeing a space full of Doleks everywhere, everyone thought Queen was going to end up losing. It did not matter how many times she used her infinite teleportation technique. She could not win.

Huangfu Jing's body suddenly appeared in the sky. She did not attack the Doleks, which were now like a sea. When everyone thought Queen was going to give up, they saw her body move.

Instantly, many Queen shadows appeared in the sky. It was now like an endless amount of Queens moving forward to attack together. It was like many scary powers working together. It was like a killing machine. It suddenly killed all of the Doleks again and again from pieces to slices, slices to sticks, sticks to dots, and dots to smaller dots. In the end, they just became molecules.

The Doleks had been cut into nothing because of the countless Queens. Everyone was frozen while watching this happen. The Doleks did not resurrect.

"Oh my God, what did I just see?" someone finally screamed.

"They should not have just been shadow doppelgangers, so why do they have a battle power and the same body?"

"What the hell was that?"

Second Uncle Bai Buyi could not help but open his eyes wide and scream, "Time and space power! Another time and space power!"
