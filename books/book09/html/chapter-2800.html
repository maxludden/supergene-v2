<p>The Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was a forbidden place in the
Extreme King’s realm. Even within the Extreme King, not many people
received permission to enter.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie was a crown prince, and he had only just recently
earned the correct permission to go there. Of course, he knew what
the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was, but he did not understand
why Mister White would mention the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye.
What did it have to do with the taming of a xenogeneic?</p>
<p>Mister White was not in a rush as he answered, “This xenogeneic
is very special. It is a xenogeneic that was grown from a plant,
but it has received special treatment. It even has a body. It is a
born-deified with two extreme bodies. Its body structure and
thinking are completely different. That is the reason normal mind
control skills like Mister Yin used are inefficient.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Mister White went on to say, “From what I can
tell, the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye is a true god eye that was
left behind by the second ancestor. It has absolute order power.
Use the absolute order power to govern the xenogeneic’s two extreme
bodies. Then, all you will need is a simple mind-control talent to
control his heart. You will not need anything like Ghost Head
Fall.”</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie looked at Mister White and asked, “Will that really
work?”</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“I am just guessing, but I do not think the truth will differ
much, ” Mister White quietly said. “There is one thing you must
remember, though, Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>“Please tell me.” Bai Wanjie’s looked at Mister White with eyes
as sharp as a sword. It was like he was attempting to see through
his heart.</p>
<p>It was just as Mister White said. The Extreme King’s Overbearing
Eye came from the Extreme King’s second ancestor. It was a true god
eye when he became a true god. It was the best gene the second
ancestor had. It had an unbelievable amount of power.</p>
<p>The second ancestor did not decide on heading to the geno hall.
It left its true god eye with the Extreme King to suppress King
Kingdom’s luck.</p>
<p>That was the very core of King Kingdom’s defensive systems. Its
position was like Sky Palace’s Sky Eye. It was the item to control
and determine the fate of an entire race. It was more important
than any true god item, so it was something they could not afford
to lose.</p>
<p>It was not just Mister White. Anyone who mentioned the Extreme
King’s Overbearing Eye was put on alert. He never wanted anyone to
make use of it.</p>
<p>“While you use the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye to split his
two extreme bodies, do not rush the process, ” Mister White
seriously said. “You need to be careful. Otherwise, something may
backfire. Please remember that, Mister Crown Prince. If you decide
to try this, do not rush it. If you do, there may be a
disaster.”</p>
<p>“Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye is the very core of the Extreme
King’s civilization,” Bai Wanjie said. “I cannot bring any other
creature there. Is there another way?”</p>
<p>Mister White thought for a while and said, “It is not like there
isn’t. I have heard the king has a King’s Book. It can split up
many creatures in the universe. If you use that book, you can
control that spirit.”</p>
<p>“The King’s Book has not been used by my father for a long
time,” Bai Wanjie said. “He will not use it for a small
spirit.”</p>
<p>“Then, there is nothing else I can do.” Mister White bowed and
said, “King’s Kingdom has many elites. Perhaps you can ask others
for a suggestion on what you might be able to do.”</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot, Mister White.” Bai Wanjie sent Mister White
away.</p>
<p>The Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye was very important, so Bai
Wanjie did not believe the man right away. He asked a few other
Extreme King deified elites for their opinions to see if there was
anything they could do to control Han Sen. But it was just like
Mister White said. There was nothing they could do to Han Sen. A
butterfly class being that was good at using mind-control skills
was unable to control Han Sen’s mind.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie asked his uncle to come over. He still could not
control Han Sen, so Mister White told his uncle about Mister
White’s method. “Uncle, do you think Mister White’s method might
actually work?”</p>
<p>“It seems as if it makes sense, but before we try it, I am not
sure it is actually all that useful,” Nan Huai Kang quietly
said.</p>
<p>“Do you think I can give it a go, Uncle?” Bai Wanjie asked.</p>
<p>The more powerful Han Sen was, the greater Bai Wanjie’s desire
for control became. Back in the Space Garden, he saw the green
light shoot into the sky. He thought the person that killed the god
was still inside the Space Garden. Perhaps the god’s personality
was still there in the Space Garden. It made Bai Wanjie want to
claim the Space Garden all the more.</p>
<p>“It could be useful, but the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye is
too important,” Nan Huai Kang said. “In case something happens,
perhaps you should not use this on such a trivial matter. Even if
you were the one to cause a mess with this, not even that would
quell the fury of the king.”</p>
<p>Nan Huai Kang did not know Bai Wanjie wanted the Space Garden.
Aside from the resources of the Space Garden, he also wanted the
god’s personality that everyone else wanted.</p>
<p>Getting the god’s personality meant they could become god
spirits. That was something true god elites could not even achieve.
Bai Wanjie would not miss out on such an opportunity.</p>
<p>After sending Nan Huai Kang away, Bai Wanjie used many methods
and all kinds of torture tools on Han Sen. No matter what he tried,
he could not make Han Sen obey. That made him start to do something
else.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s situation was bad. There was no doubt about that. He
was injured all over. This time, he was getting tortured so much
that his body was in agony. Even so, it was not enough to make him
change his mind. Bai Wanjie was unable to discover a way to break
Han Sen, who was still holding on non-stop. Han Sen was not going
to divulge a thing. He knew Bai Wanjie wanted the Space Garden. He
would not kill him before he found it.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie looked at Han Sen with disdain. After being silent
for so long, he suddenly turned off the supergravity suppression.
He lifted Han Sen and departed the supergravity cabin.</p>
<p>He had thought about it day and night. He could no longer resist
the temptation of the Space Garden and the possibility of finding
the god’s personality. He wanted to take Han Sen to the Extreme
King’s Overbearing Eye and do what Mister White had told him to
do.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen was feeling terrible and thought, Where is Bai
Wanjie taking me to? It looks like Mister White really didn’t
recognize me. Otherwise, he would have reacted. He should have at
least given me a hint if he did.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie carried Han Sen the entire way. They went through
many doors. Han Sen was shocked. He thought, I did not think his
father’s bedroom has this much security. Where is he taking me?</p>
<p>Han Sen was a bit worried. After all, his body had not yet
recovered. He was rather scared.</p>
<p>When Bai Wanjie stopped before a palace, he saw a familiar
statue. That statue was the same as the one he saw in an Extreme
King Pavilion. It was the second leader of the Extreme King.</p>
<p>This statue looked a little different from the statue of the
Extreme King’s second ancestor he saw in the Extreme King Pavilion.
The second ancestor’s statue on this palace’s platform was holding
a scale. It made the whole statue look serious. It looked like
everything had to be fair and square. It looked like a god, but it
did not have the emotion to look at everybody.</p>
