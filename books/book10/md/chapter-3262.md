  The reverse The Story of Gene kept destroying Han Sen’s body. He could no longer endure it. After resting for a while, he went to the garden to chill. Bao’er and Feng Yin Yin were playing chess in the garden. Han Sen watched the two of them play.

Because of Han Sen, Bao’er was very good at playing chess and various card games. By comparison, Feng Yin Yin was very bad. Every match ended poorly for her.

Feng Yin Yin did not care much about whether or not she won or lost. She did not mind losing over and over, which was an attitude Bao’er found to be boring.

“Playing chess with Little Yin is boring.” Bao’er won another round. She yawned and asked, “Why don’t you play with me, Daddy?”

Han Sen was going to agree to a match, but Feng Fei Fei and Bald Guy came strolling into the garden.

“Old Han, my dear Mister Han, you are a bad man this time.” Bald Guy looked friendly as he tried to get closer to Han Sen.

“Why have I been bad this time?” Han Sen asked with confusion.

Bald Guy laughed. “Did you not know that today is the day the Zhao Kingdom’s No. 1 singer, Zhao Ning’er, is having her welcome party. She mentioned you, the Qin Kingdom’s No. 1 swordsman.”

“Does she want to challenge me?” Han Sen calmly picked up his cup and took a sip of tea.

Han Sen had already received information from Rocky Dee that Zhao Ning’er was Qin Xiu’s 19th life soul owner. The reason she came to the Qin Kingdom was for the sole purpose of killing Han Sen. Thus, Han Sen was not surprised by this.

Bald Guy looked weird and smiled. “No, but Zhao Ning’er said she greatly admires you. She wants to marry you and be a nice wife who teaches children. If you want to, she will be waiting for you at the Red Sleeve Building. She wants to spend the night with you, the Qin Kingdom’s big swordsman. Now, the whole of Jade Wall City’s nobles and old antiques are jealous of you.”

“Blergh!” Han Sen almost coughed all of his tea out. He looked at Bald Guy and asked, “Are you joking?”

“Ask Miss Feng if you do not believe me.” Bald Guy looked as if he had been wronged.

Han Sen looked at Feng Fei Fei. She nodded and said, “Although Bald Guy is being a bit ridiculous, Zhao Ning’er did say something like that. I do not know if she really likes you, or if she has an ulterior motive or what. It is just like Bald Guy said. The men in Jade Wall City are going nuts. They know Zhao Ning’er has a problem, but they still want to kill you. You should be careful.”

Han Sen laughed and said, “It is fine. The nobles never liked me anyway. They’ve always wanted to kill me and feed me to the dogs. It does not matter to me. It is not as if they can do anything to me.”

“Old Han, Zhao Ning’er is in Red Sleeve Building. Are you going? She is Zhao Kingdom’s No. 1 singer.”,” Bald Guy had a look of jealousy as he said, “If it was me, I would do whatever it took to get to Red Sleeve Building and see her.”

“Of course, I am going,” Han Sen said with a curl of his lips. “If I do not go, I will be made a scapegoat for no reason.”

“Yes! Zhao Ning’er is so passionate. If you did not go, you would be an animal.” Bald Guy patted Han Sen on the shoulder and prepared to depart.

Bao’er, on the side, took out a notepad and jotted something down.

Han Sen wanted to go to Red Sleeve Building because he wanted to see Zhao Ning’er, who was the 19th test subject. If Qin Xiu let her go there, Zhao Ning’er must have had something special up her sleeve. He would not just send her there to die.

Instead of waiting for Zhao Ning’er to come to him, he might as well strike first while he had the chance. He did not want to bring any further harm to the Feng castle either.

“Old Han, do you want to go together?” Bald Guy happily looked at Han Sen. “They will probably forbid you from entering, so you will only look embarrassing,” Han Sen said with a laugh. “Oh, you are right,” Bald Guy said with a look of jealousy. “Zhao Ning’er only invited you.” Han Sen ignored him. He looked at Feng Fei Fei and asked, “Where is Red Sleeve Building?” Feng Fei Fei looked at Han Sen with shock. “Are you really going?” “To be invited there by a pretty woman, why would I not?” Han Sen asked with a laugh.

“Are all the pretty women outside the castle and not within?” Feng Fei Fei felt jealous, but she still told Han Sen the location of the Red Sleeve Building.

Bao’er continued to clutch her pen, scribbling something down in the notebook.

It was now 10 o’clock. Han Sen said goodbye to Feng Yin Yin and went to the Red Sleeve Building

After a short walk, he saw a person coming. The person sought to bar Han Sen’s way.

“Mister Han, where are you going?” the person asked with a bow.

If people were seemingly nice to you, it was rude to be mean to them. That person was nice, so Han Sen should not have been mean. Therefore, he politely said, “Red Sleeve Building.”

The man’s face changed. He got closer to Han Sen and whispered, “Teacher Han, are you going to see Zhao Ning’er? If you are willing to take me to the Red Sleeve Building to see Zhao Ning’er, I will reward you.” “What kind of reward?” Han Sen looked at the man with interest.

He was 40 years old. He looked like a scholar. He looked fairly decent, but Han Sen did not recall seeing him before.

The man moved closer to Han Sen and whispered, “My name is Zhang Huan. I would not think you have heard this name before, but the Zhang family is quite famous in the Qin Kingdom. We trade in gene eggs and gene races. Treasure Garden is our family’s business. If you were willing to take me to the Red Sleeve Building, any gene egg and gene race in Treasure Garden can be selected by you for free. You can pick one.”

“Do not give me this lame kind of stuff. Give me something real.” Han Sen did not really like Zhang Huan’s offer.

Usually, high-class gene eggs and gene races could not be found on the market. Even if they were, Zhang Huan would have probably hidden all of the high-class gene eggs and gene races. Treasure Garden was something Han Sen had heard of before. It was an old shop in Jade Wall City. It was one of the biggest gene egg and gene race shops around. The others were similar, but the other ones sold more gene races. Treasure Garden sold more gene eggs. His plan had been exposed. Zhang Huan did not mind. He whispered, “Our shop has a dozen god-class gene eggs. If you are willing to, you can go and pick one or two.”

“One rare gene egg. If you have it, then go and grab it. If not, don’t waste my time. I need to go and meet Zhao Ning’er.” Han Sen slapped a ridiculous price on the offer. He wanted the man to leave and stop wasting his time.

“Teacher Han, you are too greedy.” Zhang Huan was frozen. A rare gene egg for one date was too much.

“People are greedy,” Han Sen said with a smile. “I am just greedier than others. No matter how good a gene egg might be, it is just an item. An item swapped for a chance to date her is something I would suspect to be pretty fair.”
