  “How do I get these two guys out of the core area?” Han Sen wondered as he flew behind the small crocodile god and bronze furnace. They looked as if they could kill God himself, and take down Buddha as well if he happened to wander by. If any other xenogeneics got a whiff of them, the terrified creatures would run away as fast as they could. This made Han Sen so happy.

The bronze furnace was getting closer to becoming deified, and the small crocodile god was already very powerful. If he could take them out of the core area, their powers would be very useful.

Over the past year, Han Sen had read through a lot of info regarding the core area. Much of it was classified documents that Sky Palace had compiled. Even so, Han Sen had yet to learn how to bring a core xenogeneic out of the core area.

Unless he killed them and took their core genes, it would be impossible to bring them out.

The small crocodile god wasn’t happy that Han Sen had been gone for so long. After it saw him, it began to roar at Han Sen as if it was chewing him out.

“Look at this,” Han Sen said. He brought out a reconciliation item he had prepared before-hand. It was a pair of sunglasses that was tailored for a crocodile.

The small crocodile was instantly fascinated by the gift of sunglasses. It looked at them with keen curiosity, and it quickly forgot all about telling him off.

Han Sen put the sunglasses on the small crocodile god. Fortunately, it had grown up quite a bit. They weren’t too big, and Han Sen was able to put them on the face of the small crocodile god with ease.

“Cool.” Han Sen looked at the crocodile god, complete with its sunglasses, and gave it a thumbs up.

The small crocodile god looked like a gangster boss now. It had become very intimidating. But the sunglasses also hid the creature’s tiny, beady eyes, which made the small crocodile god much easier to approach.

The small crocodile god seemed to approve of the sunglasses. It looked very cocky with its sunglasses on, and it kept its head tilted up as if it knew how cool it was.

Han Sen wanted to use the small crocodile god’s power to kill deified xenogeneics, but he didn’t know where to begin searching for them. The bronze furnace led the way forward for half the day, but they were only able to find one King class core xenogeneic. They were unable to locate any deified xenogeneics.

Without any deified xenogeneics to kill, Han Sen wasn’t in the mood to carry on. He found an opportunity when the small crocodile god wasn’t looking to slip out of the core area. But as Han Sen stepped through the core hall door, the small crocodile god appeared. It jumped onto his back.

Han Sen reacted too late to stop it from happening, and he was already firmly inside the core hall.

Han Sen thought that the powers of the core hall would keep the small crocodile god from entering. However, when he looked back, he saw that the small crocodile god was still on his shoulder. They were inside the core hall together.

The small crocodile god roared at Han Sen in rage. It seemed to be saying that Han Sen was despicable, and that he was betraying his promises by running away again. Han Sen didn’t pay any attention to the crocodile’s objections. He lowered it from his shoulders and spoke to himself, thinking, “No way. Core xenogeneics shouldn’t be allowed to enter the core hall. This sort of situation had never transpired in countless eons, but now, the small crocodile god just jumped in easily? Was it because of the crystallizer modifications it was subjected

to?”

Han Sen wasn’t sure why the small crocodile was able to enter the core hall, but he didn’t question it. This was an excellent development.

Han Sen held his breath as he looked at the small crocodile god, hoping that he could return to the geno universe with it still in tow. It worked. And that made Han Sen leap for joy.

The small crocodile was in Han Sen’s room. It looked around, intrigued. It was curious about everything it saw.

“I am rich! I can bring creatures out of the core area. This little guy is a deified xenogeneic with a nine-star potential. It could become a true god.” Han Sen was extremely excited, but as he thought about it some more, he became worried.

He had been Dollar when he met the small crocodile god. He had just brought the small crocodile god to Sky Palace, and if Exquisite saw it, she would realize that he was Dollar.

“No, I can’t let the small crocodile god stay here.” Ignoring the small crocodile god’s objections, Han Sen tossed him back into the core area.

The small crocodile god roared at him from the core area. It was clearly upset that Han Sen had sent it back.

Han Sen tried comforting it a little, and he promised that he would bring the small crocodile god out one day. When the small crocodile god finally came into the geno universe, it would receive many gifts. That was the only way Han Sen could get the creature to calm down.

Han Sen tried to bring the bronze furnace into the core hall as well, but it immediately bounced out. So far, the small crocodile god was the only being that could follow him out. “It seems as if the small crocodile god can only follow me out of the core area because of the crystallizer modification tests,” Han Sen thought to himself. He didn’t know where the small crocodile god could be safely kept if he was brought through to the geno universe.

Han Sen couldn’t keep the creature in Sky Palace. It couldn’t stay anywhere that connected to Han Sen. He tried to think of a place that it could stay for a while, but he came up empty. Allowing the small crocodile god to wander across the universe would be a waste of a personal fighter, and Han Sen would fear for its safety.

The universe was a more savage place than the core area. Although the small crocodile god was like a ruler in the core area, in the larger geno universe, there were still plenty of xenogeneics that would be able to kill it.

Han Sen didn’t have any good options at the moment, so he went back to Sky Palace alone.

Han Sen planned on going to his old stomping grounds on Planet Eclipse. Maybe he could contact his little uncle and Xie Qing King to see if they had a place for the small crocodile god. But before he could leave his little jade island, he saw Lone Bamboo coming his way.

“Han Sen, your wounds should be healed by now, yes?” Lone Bamboo asked Han Sen.

“I’m around eighty or ninety percent healed,” Han Sen answered.“That is good enough for me. I’m going to White King City to hunt xenogeneics. Let’s go together,” Lone Bamboo said. “White King City? I don’t have a pass for entry.” Each of the five cities required a specific pass. They couldn’t use one city’s pass to enter another. Han Sen only had the pass that granted him access to Black King City, so he couldn’t enter any of the other four cities.

Lone Bamboo lobbed a pass to Han Sen and said, “Now you have one.”

“Fine. But you should at least tell me what goes on in White King City,” Han Sen said, as he caught the spell and shrugged.

“Let’s talk while we walk,” Lone Bamboo said as he started moving in the direction of the White Jade Jing.

Han Sen followed, and Lone Bamboo began to explain White King City.

It was different from Black King City. White King City had xenogeneics that were King class and above. There were even deified creatures that roamed there. But the xenogeneics that occupied that place were unusual. They were different from the wild xenogeneics that could be found elsewhere. After Lone Bamboo explained White King City to him, Han Sen’s eyes brightened. “What you’re saying is that White King City is like a giant arena? And you need to kill the xenogeneics in an arena to earn their eggs?” Han Sen asked with a look of disbelief.

“It is something like that, yes. If your power is sufficient, you can kill a deified xenogeneic and take the creature’s eggs,” Lone Bamboo confirmed with a nod.

“There is a place that good around here? You should have told me sooner.” Han Sen was so happy.
