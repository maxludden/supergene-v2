<p>“I watched your fight with Moment God. Your body has evolved
sufficiently to make use of the Cold Sutra.” As Moon God spoke, she
checked Han Sen out.</p>
<p>“It is a rather difficult situation to explain. My body does
have a problem though. I can only use the strength I need to use
when I am provoked by adversarial powers. Usually, I am quite
harmless.” Han Sen explained the situation to her.</p>
<p>When Moon God heard what he had to say, she frowned sternly and
continued checking Han Sen out. Eventually, she said, “What you are
saying is that you are stronger when you fight something stronger.
As in, if the enemy is stronger, you will become stronger.”</p>
<p>“I guess that is what I meant.” Han Sen confirmed with a
nod.</p>
<p>“I must confess, that is rather interesting. That means if I put
power onto you, you will become as strong as me.” Moon God squinted
her eyes. It was hard to determine what she was thinking about.</p>
<p>“I am not too sure about that because I do not know how strong I
can become when I encounter strong opponents,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s test your limits to the fullest. I can try
to hit you three times.” Moon God tried this the moment she spoke.
She had only just said that, and she had already used her palms to
attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>That palm was the Ice attack she used before. Moon God’s palm
quickly came near Han Sen, his body immediately became tense. His
skin and bones became ice-jade crystals. He threw a palm out toward
Moon God. The skill he used was like the Ice one Moon God had just
used.</p>
<p>Two hands looked like icy jades, and they were quietly going to
collide with each other. The temperature in the area was falling
fast.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang and Han Yufei retreated for a moment. If they
weren’t fast enough, their bodies would be frozen by the sudden
clash of frosty powers.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s and Moon God’s palms collided. An icy air arose from
their hands. Han Yufei and Wang Yuhang, in much shock, noticed Moon
God’s hands were coated in frost that was spreading all across her
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen, on the other hand, was totally fine. No frost or icy
air was harming him. He looked the same as he always did.</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s ice is better than Sister Moon’s ice.” Han Yufei was
shocked by what she was witnessing, but she was also happy. “If my
child has these sort of genes, I wonder how strong it will be ere
the end.”</p>
<p>Moon God was shocked by this too. She was the one who created
the Cold Sutra. Now, she was at the 100% ceiling of breaking the
world. In that universe, many people were close to breaking the
world but very few could maximize their Break World rate.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s ice was stronger than her Break World ice. Even Moon
God could hardly believe this to be true.</p>
<p>“Let me try my Jade Shatter.” Moon God pulled back her hand. The
palm of her other hand came rushing to strike Han Sen. She reduced
her power output to the smallest so one could not feel the jade
hand possess any power.</p>
<p>Moon God’s Jade Shatter was unleashed, so Han Sen’s body
adjusted. He used the same skill she did. The same Jade Shatter was
returned upon Moon God’s hand. The two white, jade-like hands
palmed together. The power was small, so not much movement was
created. Between the two hands, a fragment of space collapsed.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Moon God’s jade hand was delivered a crack. It was going to
crack, yet Han Sen’s hands were totally fine.</p>
<p>“Even his Jade Shatter power is greater than Sister Moon.” Han
Yufei was well and truly surprised by this.</p>
<p>Moon God was shocked too. She fell back and looked at her hands.
She saw a few small lines. If she kept going, her hand would
undoubtedly be shattered by Han Sen’s countering force.</p>
<p>“Your body is strong. Now, try and endure my Moon Break.” Moon
God frowned. She did not believe Han Sen was able to use her best
power to beat her.</p>
<p>The two hands collided to create a circular shape. The center
had a focal point that was aimed at Han Sen. A scary power gathered
up inside the hand-formed ring.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Han Sen did the same thing. He put his
hands together in a circular shape and aimed at Moon God. There was
a weird power inside his hands now.</p>
<p>A scary power exploded between Han Sen and Moon God. The space
between them was like it was being consumed by an invisible and
quiet monster.</p>
<p>They were 30 feet apart. After that moment, the two of them were
standing next to each other. Their ringed hands combined.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Moon God’s hands were bounced away by some force of power. She
took a few stumbled steps back to try and stabilize her body. She
looked at Han Sen with a look of sheer disbelief. Her mouth could
not utter a single word.</p>
<p>Han Yufei’s pretty eyes were whelmed by surprise. The more
powerful Han Sen’s body was showcased how much stronger her own
child would be.</p>
<p>After a while, Moon God could not help but ask, “What is up with
your body?”</p>
<p>She could not believe Han Sen was able to beat her with what she
was best at. She had never dreamed something like this could be
possible.</p>
<p>“I want to know what happened to my body too.” Han Sen shrugged
his shoulders. He looked as if he had been wronged or
something.</p>
<p>Moon God looked as if she was thinking about something by the
way she now peered at Han Sen. She addressed Han Yufei and said,
“Yufei, you must have done some research on his body. Did you find
anything out? What are the results?”</p>
<p>“I did research his body,” Han Yufei confessed.</p>
<p>“The results! You have to let me see them.” Moon God reached her
hands out.</p>
<p>“Therein is a problem,” Han Yufei said while shaking her head.
“There are no conclusive results.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean there weren’t any conclusive results?” Moon
God asked with a frown.</p>
<p>After thinking a moment, Han Yufei said, “Do not look at me like
that. There really was nothing to be discovered. His genes cannot
be analyzed. I used the most advanced technology and power at my
disposal, but nothing I tried seemed to work. His genes are like
stones that cannot be broken by the mightiest tool. I do not have
the answers we are all looking for. From what I am best able to
tell, the evolution of San Mu’s genes has exceeded even Qin
Xiu.”</p>
<p>“No way,” Moon God said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Han Yufei asked.</p>
<p>“You co-operated with Qin Xiu. You should know his history. He
has a Reboot God Spirit gene. His genes are atop a pyramid. Aside
from Bao’er, not even Tai Yi can compete against him.” Moon God did
not think Han Sen’s genes were as good as Qin Xiu’s.</p>
<p>“I do not think so. With evolution comes an innumerable number
of possibilities. Qin Xiu’s genes are great, but you cannot deny
the possibility that there exists another creature that is greater
than he. Han Sen could seriously be the one.” Han Yufei doubled
down on her own opinion.</p>
<p>Moon God looked at Han Sen weirdly. “There are special occasions
where such a thing can come to pass, but these special occasions
are all based on something. Han Sen does not have the genes of a
past life. All of his evolution came from this life. To become
better than Qin Xiu in such a short amount of time is too
much.”</p>
