<p>Han Sen moved behind Yisha silently, and just as he was about to
hit her over the head, his heart sank.</p>
<p>Yisha had been standing near the pool, looking into it But when
Han Sen silently slipped up to the side of the pool, he saw his
shadow and Yisha’s. She was looking at him with shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and still committed to his attack.
Yisha was able to dodge, though. She frowned and said, “How did you
get here? Even if you did kill Vic, how did you manage to cross the
bridge?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not stop swinging his scabbard at her. He was using
it like a sword, trying to strike her. It would be best to kill her
now, while she was a little worn out</p>
<p>“I walked here. It wasn’t all that difficult.” Han Sen attacked
her, while also saying things to attack her mind.</p>
<p>Yisha wouldn’t be affected by such weak mental attacks, though.
Her movements were still strong and calculated, and mistakes
weren’t going to come easy. But she had just fought Hawk Wing, and
that made her a little frustrated. She was at a disadvantage now,
fighting Han Sen.</p>
<p>Yisha was so angry, and she wondered what bad luck she had
mustered that was now forcing her to compete against Han Sen again.
Every time she was about to get something, Han Sen was there to
ruin things for her.</p>
<p>Her wounds still hadn’t healed from their first encounter, and
she was deprived of quite a bit of her power. She wouldn’t be able
to break through the limitations of Demon Grave, and so, seeing Han
Sen strike harder and harder, she knew she was getting suppressed.
She wasn’t being given a moment to do anything about it.</p>
<p>She did not know why, but Yisha felt as if Han Sen’s sword
skills had improved. He was stronger than he had been in their last
fight. It made the current fight much harder.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because Han Sen’s sword skills had improved, though.
It was because Han Sen had learned some of the Teeth Knife
techniques from the knifemind. And Han Sen was a beginner in Teeth
powers now.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen now understood how Teeth Knife worked. He wouldn’t
be any worse than Yisha right now.</p>
<p>Han Sen was suppressing Yisha quite easily. If Yisha had
abandoned Teeth Knife and used other skills, even less powerful
skills, Han Sen wouldn’t have managed to suppress her so fully.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yisha was going to get hit with the scabbard, a
splash came from the pool of liquid. In that circular pool, the
milky liquid blew up like an erupting volcano. The white juice
lashed across the area in waves.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Yisha were both given a shock. They both retreated,
wanting to dodge the white liquid.</p>
<p>The white liquid was sprayed across the floor, and then, they
realized that the pool had dried up. There wasn’t a single drop of
the liquid left in there.</p>
<p>The pipes that sent the white liquid to the pool were now dry.
There was no more of the white liquid flowing through.</p>
<p>The pool was empty.</p>
<p>“Why is there nothing? Where are the origins of the xenogeneics
researched by the crystallizers?” Yisha’s face changed. It looked
as if she could not accept what she was seeing.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt strange. The ball had just rolled inside, too. So
why was it gone?</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have the time to think this over, though. He
swung the scabbard and tried to finish off Yisha. As Han Sen moved,
he noticed Yisha’s face looked glum. The white liquid was
approaching them as if it were alive.</p>
<p>It was a sight that was very familiar to the two of them. Things
like that had turned Rocks Fall Duke and Vic into xenogeneics.</p>
<p>It had only taken one of the dangerous white columns to
transform Rocks Fall Duke and Vic, but here, there were many. There
had to be a thousand of the wriggling white things. They were like
a horde of monsters, surrounding Han Sen and Yisha.</p>
<p>“Dollar, I will remember you. Do not let me see you outside of
Demon Grave. I wouldn’t be the Knife Queen if I couldn’t kill you
quickly in the normal world,” Yisha said, before trying to
escape.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave yet! If you like me so much, why don’t you just
stay?” Han Sen laughed and slashed forward to block her way.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept attacking her non-stop. Yisha had used up too much
energy, so she couldn’t fight Han Sen. Plus, she didn’t want to
fight. The white liquid was getting so close, and touching a single
drop would be enough to end you.</p>
<p>Xenogeneics themselves weren’t scary. What was scary was
becoming one yourself, especially if you became a mindless killing
machine in the process.</p>
<p>“Why are you still coming after me? If we don’t leave, we will
both become one of those mindless xenogeneics. Do you want to die
with me that much?” Yisha pleaded as much as she was able to as she
continued to dodge.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it quite romantic, to live and die together?” Han Sen’s
sword skills came at her even faster.</p>
<p>He had decided to kill Yisha here. Since she was half-deified,
she could kill Han Sen with the greatest of ease if she managed to
get out He was just a Baron, after all. So, obviously, he did not
want any of that to happen. He had to make sure Yisha did not
escape Demon Grave.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not worried about the white liquid, either. The
liquid itself did not seem interested in Han Sen. So, he was not
worried.</p>
<p>Glancing over their shoulders, Han Sen and Yisha noticed the
wriggling white things racing for them. There was a slight
difference this time, though. Han Sen could tell they were going
for Yisha, and so he stood near her to make it look like the white
things were coming after him too.</p>
<p>Yisha did not yet know Han Sen had no reason to be afraid. And
with Han Sen disrupting her, she felt angry and afraid herself. The
white juice was coming.</p>
<p>“Dollar, I am going to kill you!” Yisha could not escape from
Han Sen, so now she was furious. Her white bunny ears stood up tall
and straight, and her long hair waved. Her entire body wrapped
itself up in a purple flame.</p>
<p>She broke the rules again, as her power increased by several
multiples. She tried to strike Han Sen with her hands, as purple
swordflames blazed.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept moving, trying to dodge that flame. The purple
flame wrapped Yisha up, though, and she managed to disappear and
reappear in front of the sphere’s entrance.</p>
<p>That made Han Sen depressed. He hadn’t realized that he’d made
Yisha angry enough to cast the skill. This time, it was too much
for her, though. Her body was damaged. Even if she left Demon
Grave, her body would be weak for a very long time to come.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to give chase, but he suddenly felt as if someone
had patted his shoulder. Goosebumps flared across his skin.</p>
