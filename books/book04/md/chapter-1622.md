“If Skysword is regretting that he agreed to the challenge, we don’t have to do this.” God-like was smiling, and he sounded scornful.

“No need. Let’s begin,” said Han Sen calmly.

“No wonder you’re Skysword. You’re definitely confident,” God-like complimented Han Sen, then grabbed the Eternal Shield and rushed forward.

White light flowed across the shield, and it flew toward Han Sen like a comet The light on the shield was getting brighter and brighter, and the physical space in front of the shield seemed like it was starting to twist.

Han Sen looked at God-like and his Eternal Shield, but he remained very calm. His physical strength was already at the pinnacle level in the Fourth Sanctuary, and he wasn’t weaker than any of the super creatures or spirits. Though God-like was powerful, not even a berserk super creature was enough to scare Han Sen.

He raised his arm and brought out the Overbearing Shield. It became as tall as a human being and stood in front of Han Sen. Hong!

The Eternal Shield hit the Overbearing Shield, and the powerful shock waves shook the space around them, forming a twisted black hole.

“Mom, do you think Han Sen can win?” Lotus Empress felt kind of anxious. Han Sen had only entered the Fourth Sanctuary a few years earlier than her, so she wasn’t sure if he could defend against such a power.

Before Night Empress answered, she heard a sound of clashing metal. The Eternal Shield hit the Overbearing Shield with terrifying power, but it couldn’t damage the Overbearing Shield. It didn’t even force Han Sen to take any steps back. Instead, the Eternal Shield and God-like bounced back. God-like took four steps back before he could balance himself again, and he was shocked.

“You deserve your reputation, Skysword!” God-like yelled, and the light on the shield got brighter and brighter. He rushed toward the Overbearing Shield again.

The Eternal Shield kept hitting Han Sen’s shield, and it kept bouncing back. It couldn’t make Han Sen move even a little bit.

“I can’t believe Han Sen is already this powerful.” Lotus’s eyes were gleaming.

Night Empress also praised, “I’ve heard about Skysword before, but I can hardly believe that this is him. The rumors about him certainly seem to be true, though. His power is indeed amazing. I would never have imagined that he would already be this powerful after only a decade of being a demigod.”

Night Empress and the others didn’t know that Han Sen had actually been absent from the sanctuary for almost ten years.

Han Sen was just standing there, and his arm shield was hit again and again. Though the Overbearing Shield wasn’t damaged, it couldn’t damage the Eternal Shield of God-like either.

“It seems that my shield’s reflecting power isn’t enough to break the Eternal Shield.” Han Sen looked at his opponent, but he didn’t feel anything. He’d agreed to the competition because he was already well-prepared.



Seeing that the strikes from God-like didn’t do anything to Han Sen, the creatures from Sacred were all dazed.

They all knew how sturdy God-like’s shield was. Even though the Eternal Shield had hit the Overbearing Shield many times, Han Sen’s shield still hadn’t cracked. That meant Han Sen’s shield had to be just as sturdy as the Eternal Shield.

“Are you done?” Han Sen asked, looking at God-like.

“I’ve never stopped you from making attacks. You can do so whenever you want.” God-like was surprised by how solid Han Sen’s shield was, but he wasn’t that worried.

He couldn’t break Han Sen’s defense, but he was still confident in his own Eternal Shield. He was confident that Han Se couldn’t damage his shield, and it would end up in a tie.

Han Sen smiled, and he summoned an object into his hand.

God-like was suddenly anxious. After all, the reputation of Skysword preceded him. Though he had the invincible Eternal Shield, he still couldn’t help being nervous.

He looked at Han Sen’s hands, and he saw that Han Sen was grabbing an object about the size of an egg instead of something sharp.

Even so, God-like didn’t dare underestimate it. He summoned all the power in his body and infused it into the Eternal Shield, and the shield started to shine like a sacred object.

Han Sen was holding his Crystal Core. He took a look at the radiant Eternal Shield. He grabbed the Crystal Core, and he pulled his arm back. And then, he threw the Crystal Core out like a baseball.



The Crystal Core flew between them like lightning, and then it hit the Eternal Shield.

“Hou!” At the same time, God-like yelled as well, and all his power burst out, condensing in the Eternal Shield and making it much more solid.

Everyone stared at the place where the Eternal Shield and the Crystal Core would connect. However, what happened next shocked everyone and made their eyes pop out. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

The Crystal Core hit the Eternal Shield hard, like a china cup hitting an iron plate, and the Crystal Core was smashed into pieces.

Everyone was startled. They originally thought that the object Han Sen threw out would be a powerful one, but nobody had expected it to be immediately smashed, so all of them found it quite unacceptable.

However, after the Crystal Core got smashed, that wasn’t the end of it. A small skeleton climbed out and hit the Eternal Shield with one punch.

God-like was scared again because he didn’t know what the skeleton was. He condensed his power again and used his Eternal Shield to ward off that punch.

What confused God-like was that the punch from the jade skeleton didn’t have much power. When its small fist hit the Eternal Shield, it barely made any sound, and God-like didn’t even feel his shield tremble. The jade skeleton then flew back into Han Sen’s hands.

“I thought that was going to be impressive, but you were just bluffing,” said the giant dragon.

Everyone else thought the same thing that the giant dragon did. They all thought that Han Sen was just bluffing, since the attack didn’t do anything.

“No wonder. After all, this is the Eternal Shield of our leader. Even if Skysword’s shield is impressive, it won’t be able to damage the Eternal Shield,” said another creature, smiling.

However, God-like’s expression suddenly changed, and he made a small squeaking sound. Everyone looked to him and his Eternal Shield.

A jade color was spreading across the surface of the Eternal Shield, and after only a short while, it covered the entire Eternal Shield and turned it into a jade sculpture. It looked completely different from the original Eternal Shield now.

All the mutant creatures from Sacred were stunned because they didn’t know whether the change was good or bad. All the creatures from Night Shelter looked at the Eternal Shield curiously, as they didn’t know what was going on.

As for God-like, his face was already deep red, and his eyes were filled with horror.
