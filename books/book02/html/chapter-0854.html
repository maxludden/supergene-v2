    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The creatures were awoken from their daze. Han Sen didn&#8217;t know which
      monster began roaring first, but after that roar, they all began rushing
      to the peak.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every creature ravenously raced towards the gold light. Each and every
      creature there had an insatiable appetite for the golden fruit borne by
      the Jade-Gold Tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      The energy that consumed the mountain top was like a fountain, and it
      seemed to energize every creature that walked upon its slopes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gritting his teeth, the Devil-Blood King now rushed up the mountain and
      into Moment Shelter. He had come to a decision, and that decision was to
      not give up on the potential treasure that resided within.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike the rest, Han Sen was still quite hesitant. He felt as if something
      bad was still going to happen, so he hadn&#8217;t sent word for Wang
      Yuhang to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned Moment Queen again and asked her, &#8220;Observe the
      situation there and report back to me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen did as she was commanded and went up. At the peak, she was
      able to see the energy that consumed the area. She told Han Sen, &#8220;An
      energy burst like this would suggest something good is being born.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hmm, perhaps we should go take a look.&#8221; Han Sen nodded, but
      still decided against giving Wang Yuhang the signal. Stroking the silver
      fox&#8217;s head, he let Moment Queen lead their way up towards the golden
      light.
    </p>

    <p>
      He traveled through the mist towards Moment Shelter, a place he had come
      to be both fond of and familiar with. There were no visible changes, from
      what he could initially tell. All he could see was that the tree had grown
      to be about one hundred feet tall. It basked in a holy presence, and the
      chests beamed with gold light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, seeing those six chests, was shocked. Before, they looked fairly
      ordinary. Now, they looked different. All six of the golden chest fruits
      were of different sizes, and they were all shaped differently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The combined light of the chests was so bright that looking towards them
      was difficult. But still, each golden chest emanated with a certain scary
      energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crane he had seen before screamed. It flew past Han Sen&#8217;s head
      and collected the golden chest that was the furthest from the ground, and
      then flew away with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big dragon and a four-winged beast quickly flew forward to stop the
      crane and retrieve the chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creatures, seeing the crane grab one of the chests to no ill
      repercussions, began rushing towards the tree in the hope of nabbing the
      rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King brought the silver ape with him to grab a golden
      chest. After retrieving one, they looked to take another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within fifteen minutes, the six golden chests had found new masters. Han
      Sen was too far away, and due to his initial hesitation, he was unable to
      procure one for himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was just the beginning, for even if he did get a chest, escaping
      the ire of the surrounding creatures would be a bigger challenge by far.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shelter was in utter chaos, as creatures battled for ultimate
      possession of the chests. The sounds of combat, the screeches and the
      roars, it was all deafening.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was fire, toxic mists, and thunder being cast out, all into one
      dangerous melting pot of anarchy. It was fortunate Moment Shelter was
      tough, because otherwise, it would&#8217;ve been reduced to nothing but
      rubble.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Should we join the battle and attempt to procure a chest for
      ourselves?&#8221; Moment Queen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We should wait a little longer.&#8221; Han Sen was not yet ready to
      strike. He stared at the Devil-Blood King, who had managed to acquire two
      chests and was still not satisfied. Leading his pets, he went to try and
      steal another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had fought him once before, but he had yet to determine what his
      true strength actually was. Amidst this raging battle, Han Sen believed
      he&#8217;d be able to accurately gauge that strength through observation.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, Han Sen smiled. He could now tell exactly how the
      Devil-Blood King was able to close the gap and eliminate the distance
      separating the two like he had in their previous fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King vanished from sight, and when he reappeared, he
      punched a super creature away and took its chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw this happen many times, and he was now positive the
      Devil-Blood King could not teleport: he traveled through shadows.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King had to stand in a shadow. When he was in a shadow, he
      could melt into the shadow and move freely within. It was as if he was
      traveling through another dimension. He could not get hit, nor could he be
      detected.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s why!&#8221; After managing to observe the
      Devil-Blood King&#8217;s power, Han Sen felt relieved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although that shadow ability was effective, it was not unbreakable. He had
      to be in a dark shadow, not one that was faint. And to move efficiently,
      the shadows had to be connected.
    </p>

    <p>
      All Han Sen would have to do was keep an eye on his shadow and not have it
      connect with anything else. If he did that, the Devil-Blood King could not
      warp around and would instead have to approach him like any other
      combatant.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this shelter had many palaces, and thus many wide and strong shadows
      were cast. That gave the Devil-Blood King a big advantage, and he could
      practically travel freely with that skill. He had already taken three
      chests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because he had taken three gold chests, other creatures focused their
      attention on him now. But the silver ape was a valiant defender of its
      master, and it prevented anything else from getting near.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t allow him to take everything.&#8221; Han Sen, seeing
      the Devil-Blood King become so greedy, became extra happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not going to focus on attacking the Devil-Blood King. Instead,
      he was going to focus on the big ape.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver ape was powerful, that much was clear. Its body was tough, and
      it was surprisingly quick for its size. It didn&#8217;t possess elemental
      powers, but its physical attack strength was through the roof. Its nails
      could tear through a super creature&#8217;s body with ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was clear to Han Sen that other super creatures were unable to touch
      it. Regardless of what element hit it, the worst that happened was a faint
      scorch mark upon its fur. Nothing truly damaged it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I kill that thing first, I rob the Devil-Blood King of its
      muscle,&#8221; Han Sen said to himself, as he watched the violent,
      murderous ape.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was another reason why Han Sen wanted to kill it. The ape was a
      second generation super creature, and he&#8217;d get a mighty reward for
      slaying it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the silver ape was too strong for a prolonged fight, so Han Sen tried
      to think of a way in which he could one-hit kill it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a bit of thinking, Han Sen noticed something strange after it slew a
      dragon with one swipe of its claws. Its invincibility may have been
      overstated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen noticed it was strangely protective of its ears. Whenever a heavy
      attack came its way, it made sure to protect its ears above all else.
    </p>

    <p>The ears looked like silver snails, and were about the size of eggs.</p>
