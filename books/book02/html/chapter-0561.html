    <p>
      The big fluffy tail of the silver fox hooked Han Sen&#8217;s legs, and
      tickled him as it moved up and down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was beginning to realize that the silver fox had no intention of
      causing him harm, so he crouched to hold him. Without resisting, the
      silver fox allowed itself to be picked up in Han Sen&#8217;s arm and
      thoroughly hugged. The fox&#8217;s tail wagged in ecstasy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This silver fox is so strange; I wonder where it came from?&#8221;
      Han Sen held the calm silver fox with a puzzled expression on his face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people had been known to own and keep some creatures, but they were
      usually kept behind bars, imprisoned against their will. More often than
      not, they&#8217;d eventually be killed to be served up as food.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such creatures were known to have wild and varying personalities, but
      there was one common thread that linked most wild monsters together –
      their desire to attack and kill humans on sight. It did not matter how
      humans approached or responded, that&#8217;s what they would do.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this silver fox was showing itself to be the opposite of everything
      Han Sen thought he knew. It was so calm. If Han Sen hadn&#8217;t seen it
      almost kill Yi Dong Mu, he&#8217;d be hard-pressed to believe that the
      fluffy little animal in his arms was a super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      So now Han Sen was in a difficult situation. Although it was docile and
      friendly at this point in time, there was no guarantee it would always be
      like this. If the silver fox turned violent after Han Sen returned home
      with it, it would be a disaster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the ice fields, no one could bear the wrath of a super creature,
      and Han Sen was taken back to the image of the blue seahorse that had
      burned down the Seabed Shelter. That gave him a chill.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t bring it back. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d be able
      to bring it back.&#8221; Han Sen watched the cute silver fox sit lovingly
      in his arms but had to resist. Though it hurt him to do so, he returned it
      to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little fox, it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to bring you
      with me, and if I was on my own I would&#8230; I just can&#8217;t risk
      bringing you back in the presence of others. If something happened, it
      wouldn&#8217;t just be my problem. You should go home,&#8221; Han Sen told
      the silver fox, then turned around and left.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the silver fox didn&#8217;t listen, and continued following and
      mimicking every step Han Sen took. If he stepped forward, it did too. If
      Han Sen stopped, it would too. Han Sen thought about chasing it away, but
      whenever he looked at the creature, it returned a delightfully cute,
      puppy-dog look that melted his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, Han Sen did not dare use force. The silver fox was far
      stronger than he was, and he feared what might happen if he attacked it.
      It was highly likely Han Sen would be the one to suffer the greater
      misfortune.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides, the adorable sight of the silver fox was enough to stay his hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back at the silver fox that refused to be left behind, Han Sen
      picked him up once more. Like a little cat, he dug into Han Sen&#8217;s
      chest and was the cutest thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fine, I will take you to the Crystal Palace. If something happens
      there, at least you won&#8217;t be harming anyone else.&#8221; Han Sen
      brought out his wings, and with the silver fox in his arms, took to the
      skies.
    </p>

    <p>
      He&#8217;d have to hide the silver fox before meeting the evolvers, too.
      The tall tales that might be spun out of this turn of events would be
      dizzying.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll just leave them to wait where they are, then. They are
      the ones that chose not to accompany me, after all. There is no harm in
      leaving them in the freezing cold for a little while longer.&#8221; Han
      Sen clutched the silver fox tightly, as he flew higher and higher to leave
      the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen prepared to fly towards the Ice Lake, he saw a multitude of ice
      snakes jump out from the snow in the ice valley. It was strange – the
      place had been empty before. There was an extra-large ice snake amongst
      them, as well, and his entire body was scaled in silver. It gleamed like
      the snow, and it was 100 meters long. It was a terrible sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The silver-eyed ice snake king?&#8221; Han Sen was shocked. When he
      entered the valley and traversed it earlier, he had caught no sight of it.
      Where did it come from?
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart jumped, and he returned down to the snow valley. But
      when he returned, he saw the snake king and its clan return deep beneath
      the snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose it is because of you.&#8221; Han Sen landed on the snow
      valley, but he could not now glimpse the faintest shadow of an ice snake.
      Even the king itself had disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox remained in Han Sen&#8217;s arms, pretending to be asleep.
      He wasn&#8217;t sure whether it understood what he was saying, or if the
      creature just didn&#8217;t care. Calmly, it just wagged its tail.
    </p>

    <p>
      He flew outside the ice valley again and put the silver fox down on the
      peak of a snowy mountain. Then he saw the ice snakes return to the
      surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You wait for me here, okay?&#8221; Han Sen told the silver fox and
      then flew back towards the valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time, the silver fox didn&#8217;t follow Han Sen; it stood on top of
      the mountain, watching Han Sen descend into the valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was going solo towards the giant pit of snakes, but this time,
      they did not return to below the surface. What&#8217;s more, a legion of
      snakes leapt up and attempted to thwart his airborne descent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The snake king&#8217;s eyes were like braziers of silver light, staring at
      Han Sen. The beast spread open its own wings, and the two horns on its
      head shone like beacons. Like some deadly creature of ancient history, it
      charged towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They really must have escaped due to the silver fox&#8217;s
      presence.&#8221; Han Sen put away his wings and hit the snow with Treading
      Cloud, reverting to his previous attempt to grab the snake king&#8217;s
      attention and draw it to the valley&#8217;s entrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      To go up against such a giant monster, Han Sen lacked the faith to battle
      it on his own. Not to mention the amount of other smaller snakes he would
      have to deal with at the same time. So Han Sen settled for his original
      plan of leading the snake king out and giving the evolvers something to
      do.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter how bad they were, he could at least get them to deal with any
      smaller snakes trying to prevent the slaying of their leader. Although
      they were afraid of them, if he led them out of the valley, the snow
      wouldn&#8217;t be thick enough to cloak them. In such conditions, the
      evolvers could take on the snakes with far greater ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was unsure whether the snake king had been suppressed by the
      presence of a silver fox in recent times because its insane temper was far
      beyond Han Sen&#8217;s expectations. Without reprieve or thought, it
      mindlessly went after Han Sen. Its speed was surprising. With its silver
      wings allowing it to lash, twirl and snap its way through the sky in its
      pursuit of Han Sen, its mouth was perpetually open, ready to gobble up its
      desired prey.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was no sluggard, though, as he dodged the attempted bites with
      ease. The faint trail he left in the snow made a zigzag, however, as he
      kept dodging the snake king and its minions. Before long, he had it made
      it through to outside the snow valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang and the other evolvers outside the valley were still waiting in
      nervous anticipation to see Han Sen return.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s been gone too long. I bet you he was killed by the snake
      king.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;If that were true, how come we have not heard anything?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I bet he didn&#8217;t even see the snake king; the man can&#8217;t
      even fly. To keep running like that, he probably kept attracting more and
      more ice snakes until they overwhelmed him. He probably died before
      reaching the snake king.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What do we do then? Should we continue waiting?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It would probably be best to wait a little longer. If we leave now,
      and he does indeed return, we won&#8217;t be able to explain our
      desertion.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But he&#8217;s been gone for so long. There is no way he&#8217;ll
      be coming back now, after all this time.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Just wait a bit longer; if we&#8217;ve waited this long already,
      what does it matter if we wait a little more? The day is gone, anyway. If
      he doesn&#8217;t return by tomorrow then we can leave.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      While everyone was talking, they suddenly heard movement from the valley.
      When they went to look, all of their mouths dropped to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      They saw Han Sen running like a madman out of the valley, and behind him,
      a monstrous sea of snakes flying, twirling, writhing and slithering after
      him. In the middle, one that looked like a dragon was in the hottest
      pursuit. Its wings were outstretched as it tried to capture Han Sen, and
      each snap missed him only by a second. The insane sight sent their pulses
      racing in fear.
