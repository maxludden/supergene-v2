<p>“Weird. How has his body recovered already?” Han Sen was looking
at Pluto Peacock’s wounds where Burning Lamp came out from. He was
shocked by what he had seen.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp was in the underworld. Now, his body had completely
recovered. The blue-green transparent color was gone.</p>
<p>According to the theory, Burning Lamp was unable to withstand
the underworld god light power. He became part of the underworld.
After he became part of the underworld, he was not a threat to
Pluto Peacock. He was no longer unable to damage Pluto Peacock’s
body.</p>
<p>Now, Burning Lamp had emerged safely. His body had returned to
normal. It was like he had never been injured. If Burning Lamp had
that power all along, he did not have to go through so much trouble
and get swallowed by Pluto Peacock before fighting back. “It looks
like the problem is the knife.” Han Sen looked at the knife as he
spoke to himself.</p>
<p>God, who was near him, continued speaking. “It looks like it has
something to do with the power of the knife. Otherwise, Burning
Lamp would be dead.</p>
<p>“This knife’s power cannot be reverse-cause, can it?” Han Sen
asking after thinking for a moment. “I do not know,” God said.
“More accurately, it might be a consequence of cause. Pluto Peacock
used underworld god light to damage Burning Lamp and later consume
him. Everything that was done to Burning Lamp was the cause. Then,
that knife could absorb the cause power and turn it into his own
power, which could be reversed upon the enemy that created it.”</p>
<p>“If things are like that, then having that knife can make you
invincible,” Han Sen said. “No matter how strong the enemy is, the
knife will absorb its power and cast it back. No matter how strong
the enemy is, you can fight back.” “That is the theory, but first,
you need a body that can withstand such damage. If your body cannot
sustain the damage being dealt, you will be killed before the knife
can absorb all the power and unleash it. It does not matter how
strong the knife is.” God laughed.</p>
<p>“You are right. It is no wonder Burning Lamp can reach the top
100. It all came down to the knife.” Han Sen stared at the knife
with fire in his eyes. He was thinking, “No matter if the knife is
my blood knife blank or not, when I destroy the Buddha Kingdom, I
am taking that knife. With my body’s fitness and that knife, it
might not fare well in the beginning, but I can certainly tackle
true</p>
<p>gods.”</p>
<p>Pluto Peacock was heavily injured. It was so angry that it cast
underworld area again, but it was too injured. The power of the
underworld god area was reduced, and the wounds could not be healed
by the underworld. Burning Lamp used his knife to attack the
creature’s wounds. It made Pluto Peacock very angry, but the wounds
were becoming worse. It had no choice but to quit the battle.
Burning Lamp won the battle.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about the fight that had just ended and sort of
understood how the knife functioned now. “Burning Lamp really is a
tricky man. That knife can attack any second. He waited until Pluto
Peacock swallowed him before attacking. That is a sort of patience
not everyone can have.”</p>
<p>The knife itself would not absorb Burning Lamp’s wounds. It
required activation from Burning Lamp for the power to be
unleashed. That was when the knife absorbed the wounds he had
incurred or the cause power. After all the cause was absorbed,
Burning Lamp’s body would return to normal again like he was never
injured in the first place.</p>
<p>The knife that absorbed the cause power could release an attack
power that was equal to what had previously been dealt.</p>
<p>The knife’s power did seem to have its limitations. One could
not just use it whenever. It required some time to separate it.
Also, Burning Lamp’s body was getting more and more wounds. The
power the knife could release was able to become stronger. That was
why Burning Lamp endured it all the way and enabled himself to be
swallowed by Pluto Peacock. It gave back all the damage to Pluto
Peacock that it was unable to recover from.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp then used the power of the knife. Because the power
that had been absorbed was minimal, it did not deal much damage.
Just like God had said, the more power the body could endure, the
more power the knife was able to release. “This is a f*cking
self-torturing knife. If you do not get hurt, it is not strong. The
more you are hurt, the stronger it becomes. Where did Burning Lamp
get this knife from?” Han Sen could not help but complain.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was evident that Burning Lamp had won the match.
He kept his rank of 84. The ranking of 84 was not really a rank
that others wanted to fight for. Even though Burning Lamp had been
swallowed by his enemy, he was able to come back out alive. It made
the creatures of a lower rank not dare challenge him. After this
fight, no creature dared challenge him anymore. “Never mind, I will
just let him be happy for a bit.” Han Sen did not want to challenge
Burning Lamp either. Rank 84 was too low. Han Sen did not have much
chance to win by challenging the top 10. If he challenged those in
the top 20 to 30, he might have stood a chance. He would have
received many rewards. Thus, Han Sen did not risk wasting time by
challenging Burning Lamp. Plus, Han Sen was planning a trip to
visit the Buddha Kingdom anyway. The more benefits Burning Lamp
received now, the more benefits Han Sen would receive after his
holiday. So, there was no need for him to disrupt Burning Lamp’s
ranking now. From Han Sen’s perspective, Burning Lamp was now
something like an employee of his. “So, who should I challenge?”
Han Sen thought to himself. Although Han Sen really wanted to
challenge Demon Alpha, he knew that even if he used all of his
power, he might not be able to defeat Demon Alpha. He quickly gave
up on the idea. Lou Lie was a member of Blood Legion. Blood Legion
had helped Han Sen out in the universe, so he did not want to hurt
them either. Regarding Very High Leader, unless Han Sen used Super
God Spirit mode, he did not have what it took to fight back. He
also gave up on that idea.</p>
<p>Han Sen again looked at the top 10. None of them were good to
fight. Han Sen also made use of his law eye. Some of them had crime
meters, but their crime meters were not high enough to see them
dead.</p>
<p>Using the law eye against them would not have been an effective
tactic.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept trying to choose. In the end, he looked at a
xenogeneic ranked 25. It was a xenogeneic that looked like an
elephant. Its name was Maha God Elephant.</p>
<p>Its power seemed to be strong, but its primary power was just a
powerful holy light that could heal.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw an Extreme King wanting to challenge him. He used
all sorts of geno arts to attack the Maha God Elephant, but the God
Elephant merely stood where it was without moving. It kept spewing
a holy light. Within that holy light, its body was healed faster
than it was able to be hurt. In the end, the Extreme King fighter
was too tired. He ended up conceding. It was such a powerful
defensive and healing power. Ordinary true gods could not do
anything to it, but it was perfect for Han Sen. He had the Sky Vine
Radish God Lance. Its attack power was the best. There was a very
high chance of it defeating the Maha God Elephant.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was not in a rush. There were a few more days to go
before the challenges ended. Han Sen planned to just sit and watch
for now.The geno god list lights were flickering. Two ranks lit up.
Han Sen glanced at them. One of them was Sky Palace Leader’s Zhang
Xuandao.</p>
