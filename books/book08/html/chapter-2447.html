<h3>Chapter 2447</h3>

<p>The pirates all stood in a line, still chilled and shivering.
They stood meekly before Bao’er, listening attentively as she
scolded them.</p>
<p>“From now on, you guys are the deckhands of the white whale.
You’ll be a cleaner… And you, a servant…” Bao’er gave them jobs,
and the pirates all nodded as they were given assignments. They had
been tamed, and none of them dared to refuse to do as they were
told.</p>
<p>Their eyes sometimes wandered to the little red bird sitting
atop Bao’er’s shoulder, and the sight of it would send another
involuntary shiver through them.</p>
<p>Ten minutes before, the little bird had burned a sixth-tier
Destroyed King to nothing more than charcoal. There was too little
of him left to even be considered cooked meat.</p>
<p>“Brother Fang, you should really leave now. Following me will
only put you in more danger,” Han Sen said to Fang Qing Yu.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu shook his head. “Brother Han, the Tianxia System
isn’t a place a Marquise can make a living. How long do you think I
could survive out there?”</p>
<p>After that, Fang Qing Yu pulled something out of his pocket. He
set it down in front of Han Sen. With a slight smile, he said,
“Brother Han, do you remember this?”</p>
<p>After Han Sen got a good look at what Fang Qing Yu was holding,
he was confused. He didn’t recognize the item.</p>
<p>The item looked like a common, three-by-three, six-sided Rubix
cube. Nine squares occupied each face.</p>
<p>But unlike a normal Rubix cube, each square on this cube
contained a strange image. Each image was like a small painting of
a place that Han Sen had never been before. Some of them showed
starscapes, whereas others showed mountains and rivers. Others
simply showed off rooms or palatial halls.</p>
<p>When Fang Qing Yu looked at Han Sen’s face, he realized that Han
Sen didn’t recognize it. He smiled and said, “This is the Wanjie
Rubix Cube; it is a xenogeneic treasure from the Thousand
Treasures. Everyone who has a Wanjie Rubix Cube can contact others
with a Wanjie Rubix Cube. You can even use video. To simplify this
for you, the Wanjie Rubix Cube is like a phone. But it is a
xenogeneic treasure, so you don’t need a signal. You can
communicate through space without being affected by magnetic
storms.”</p>
<p>“This is a powerful tool. If you have a treasure like this, you
can ask your family or friends to come pick you up, right?” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu smiled wryly. “Brother Han, I’m not showing this to
you so that I can leave. I am a member of the Thousand Treasures
Alliance. Although the Alliance isn’t considered a part of the
Thousand Treasures race, we have the same level of authority as the
Thousand Treasures. My Wanjie Rubix Cube can connect to other
members of the Thousand Treasures. They can see everything I
see.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu quickly waved his hand and said, “Don’t
misunderstand me, Brother Han. The Wanjie Rubix Cubes need to be
activated for others to see my image. Right now, it is not open and
so no one will know anything about what is going on here.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Fang Qing Yu went on to say, “Your battleship is
incredible—it can even travel through the Tianxia System unimpeded.
The Thousand Treasures want every treasure, including rare items in
dangerous places like the Tianxia System. There are so many items
in this system that most people couldn’t tell what is valuable and
what isn’t, but with the Wanjie Rubix Cube, we could send images
back to the Thousand Treasures. They could identify what is worth
taking and what isn’t. If they see something that they want, they
will pay a high price for the items you bring back to them.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “Brother Fang, I’m afraid you don’t
know my situation.”</p>
<p>“I know you are Knife Queen’s student.” Fang Qing Yu looked at
Han Sen with a modicum of confusion.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved his hand to interrupt him. He smiled and said,
“You can use your Wanjie Rubix Cube to contact your Thousand
Treasures friends, and perhaps, they might let you know a thing or
two about me, as well.”</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu looked confused, and so he turned on his Wanjie
Rubix Cube. In one of the squares, another member of the Thousand
Treasures appeared. Fang Qing Yu spoke to him, and his expression
became increasingly apprehensive as the conversation went on.</p>
<p>When the conversation was over, Fang Qing Yue turned and stared
toward Han Sen for a long moment. A while later, he muttered,
“Brother Han, are you not afraid that I will expose your
location?”</p>
<p>“What is there to be afraid of? The Extreme King must already be
in the Tianxia System by now, so it doesn’t really matter,” Han Sen
said with a shrug. “Now you should understand why I don’t want to
bring you along. I cannot do the things you want me to, like
stopping and collecting treasures along the way.”</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu’s eyes brightened as he looked at Han Sen. “If that
is true, you should definitely take me with you.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, I know you only want me off the ship so I don’t
get pulled into this, which was a kind thought. Also, I’m carrying
a Wanjie Rubix Cube. You probably think that if I go with you, I
might expose your location, and the Extreme King might have an
easier time following you,” Fang Qing Yu said.</p>
<p>“I’m glad that you understand,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu shook his head. “But I also think you are
wrong.”</p>
<p>“How so?” Han Sen looked at Fang Qing Yu with interest.</p>
<p>“My presence might expose information about your escape, but
that sort of exposure isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” Fang Qing Yu
said seriously. There was no humor in his expression.</p>
<p>“What does that mean? I really don’t understand,” Han Sen
replied.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu set the Wanjie Rubix Cube in front of Han Sen. “You
can take the Wanjie Rubix Cube, and you can decide whether you want
to turn it on or off. Or you could just throw me off the ship. But
I must tell you that if you allow me to stay, I will expose your
location with the Wanjie Rubix Cube. And I will take loads of
photos.”</p>
<p>“Fang Qing Yu, are you tired of living? Others might be afraid
of the Thousand Treasures, but do you think a guy who disguised
himself as a prince of the Extreme King would care about the life
of some snot-nosed Thousand Treasures member?” Elysian Moon snorted
in derision.</p>
<p>“Keep talking,” Han Sen remained focused on Fang Qing Yu, and he
didn’t seem upset.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Elysian Moon. What I have said makes sense. I’m not
selling Brother Han out.” Fang Qing Yu paused. He looked at Han Sen
and said, “Brother Han, you are escaping to Sky Palace, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen answered immediately. He had never planned to
hide the fact that Sky Palace was his destination. Otherwise, he
wouldn’t have let Miss Mirror know where he was going.</p>
<p>In fact, he wanted everyone to know he was going to Sky
Palace.</p>
<p>“If I’m understanding the situation correctly, Brother Han, you
are going through the Tianxia System to reach the systems of chaos
in order to get to Sky Palace?” Fang Qing Yu asked.</p>
<p>“That is correct.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“In that case, you should let me film this. And do it in HD
quality.” Fang Qing Yu sounded really excited.</p>
