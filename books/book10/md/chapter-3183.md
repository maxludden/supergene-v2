“Who are you people? How dare you come to the Feng family! Are you not afraid of the Qin Kingdom’s law?” Feng Fei Fei was protecting Feng Yin Yin and Bao’er as she shouted at Rocky Dee.

“Beautiful lady, if this was a normal day, I could spend all day discussing the law and other knowledgeable things with you. Alas, today is not a normal day. I have come here for her. Therefore, I am sorry.” Rocky Dee used his cane to point at Bao’er.

Feng Yin Yin protected Bao’er, but the dragon maid stared at her. A scary sort of power suddenly whelmed and suppressed her. It affected Feng Fei Fei too. She and Feng Yin Yin were pinned to the ground and unable to move.

*Boom!*

Fire blazed as a small white fish appeared in front of them. The power of the dragon maid vanished. It was like her power had been burned to a crisp by the fire.

“You can play with the small fish,” Rocky Dee coldly said.

The dragon maid nodded. Her body expanded, tearing the black maid outfit she was wearing. She turned into a black dragon standing on all fours. Everyone in the Feng family’s castle trembled as the dragon’s breath came bearing down on the little flying fish.

The small flying fish spewed white fire that struck the big black dragon’s dragon breath. It created a scene in which neither of the two could win. One white and one black, two different fires, collided and erased each other out.

Rocky Dee circled the battleground and walked toward Bao’er at the back. His face had a gentleman’s smile as he said, “You are a cute little princess. You should not be afraid. Uncle is going to take you to a beautiful castle where you will be a privileged guest there.”

“Really?” Bao’er asked with a weird blink.

“Bao’er, do not trust that man. He is a bad guy.” Feng Yin Yin grabbed Bao’er and retreated.

“I am not exactly a bad guy,” Rocky Dee said with a smile as he started walking toward Bao’er. “That is because I am not human. I am a god. You can call me a bad god or an evil god. One of those two will work. My name is Rocky Dee, and my god title is Paper God.”

“Let’s go.” Feng Fei Fei tried her best to protect them. She wanted to run away with them.

Rocky Dee waved his hands. Two paper pieces flew out of his hands. One of his hands looked like it was a crane holding a cold blade. The two sheets of paper were suddenly cut into two paper persons.

The two paper men stood up. According to their actions, Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin no longer had control of their bodies. They behaved as the paper men did. Unable to do anything about it, they let go of Bao’er and walked to the side.

“Do not worry, you two beautiful ladies,” Rocky Dee said with a smile. “I am an honorable God Spirit. I wouldn’t dare dream of killing a woman. “He walked past both of them and approached Bao’er.

“Beautiful little princess, do you want to come to my castle as an esteemed guest?” Rocky Dee lowered his body to perform a gracious gesture.

“OK,” Bao’er laughed and said with a nod. She put a small hand in Rocky Dee’s hand.

Rocky Dee smiled, but Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin looked as if they were in a desperate rush. Unfortunately, they could not move or speak. They had to watch Bao’er be taken by Rocky Dee to the castle’s door.

“Let go of Lady Bao’er.” A calm voice sounded from in the castle.

Rocky Dee looked back. He saw a middle-aged man holding a tea set going toward them. Judging from his clothing, one was able to tell that he must have been a servant at the castle.

When Rocky Dee saw that person, his eyes froze. He looked at the middle-aged man and called out his name. He did so slowly and word by word.

“Jian… Bu… Gu…”

“Please let Miss Bao’er go.” Jian Bu Gu stepped forward with an expression that did not change.

Rocky Dee was holding Bao’er by the hand. He did not let her go. He smiled and said, “Jian Bu Gu, the oath you made has yet to see you released. So, what? Are you really going to stop me by fighting me? Are you going to break your oath? Or, are you just going to do nothing and watch me walk away?”

Jian Bu Gu coldly said, “I did make an oath. Of course, I will not break it.”

“What is the point of you stepping forward now?” Rocky Dee asked with a lift of his lips. “So, what? Does it matter that you are Jian Bu Gu? A Jian Bu Gu that cannot wield a sword is no better than a gutter rat.”

Jian Bu Gu did not answer. He walked toward Bao’er. He put the tea set in front of Bao’er and said, “Miss Bao’er, this is a gift for you.”

Rocky Dee was scared of Jian Bu Gu, but he did not do anything. He looked at what was on the tea set.

It was a sword. It was a short sword made of wood. It was only one foot long and looked like a toy for children.

Rocky Dee and the others could tell the wooden sword was not a gene race or a sacrifice. It was like an ordinary decoration that had been made from wood.

“What is this?” Bao’er picked up the sword and asked with curiosity.

“This is a wooden sword I always carry around with me,” Jian Bu Gu said. “My father made it for me when I was young. It was a birthday gift.”

“This is so important. I cannot take this from you.” Bao’er shook her head. She wanted to return it to Jian Bu Gu.

Jian Bu Gu put away the tea set and smiled. “Do not worry about it, Miss Bao’er. My father was just an ordinary man who did not have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It did not matter what type of wood or the craftsmanship, the wooden sword he made for me is just a common thing. Please, do not think of it as useless. Take it.”

“I love this gift,” Bao’er said as she held the wooden sword.

Rocky Dee looked at the wooden sword and coldly asked, “Jian Bu Gu, do you think that wooden sword is going to stop me?”

He could not tell what was so amazing about that wooden sword. It was just as Jian Bu Gu said. It was an ordinary wooden sword with nothing remarkable about it. The material and craftsmanship were decidedly average. It seemed that if he wanted to, he could crush it with ease.

“No.” Jian Bu shook his head and said nothing more. He walked away with the tea set in his hands, making no effort to stop Rocky Dee.

Rocky Dee looked weird. After watching Jian Bu Gu return to the garden, he turned his gaze back to Bao’er’s new wooden sword. There was nothing special or powerful about it.

“Princess Bao’er, let’s go.” Rocky Dee was confused. If Jian Bu Gu was not going to fight, then he did not worry. He did not think a wooden sword could do anything much to him.

Bao’er nodded and said to Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin, “Sister Fei Fei and Sister Yin Yin, I will go to his home to play. I will be right back.”

Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin were worried, but they could not move or speak. They could only watch Bao’er hold Rocky Dee’s hand and head for the castle’s gates.

The castle’s gates were twisted by some power. After they went through the gates, they vanished.

The dragon maid still had the form of a big black dragon. She spat out a dragon breath that shook the little fish back a bit. She soon returned to her image of a dragon maid. After that, she fled through the castle’s gates.

When the little flying fish followed, the door into space returned to normal. The little flying fish went outside, but it could no longer see Rocky Dee or the dragon maid.

Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin were given back control of their bodies. When they ran outside of the castle, they could not see Bao’er.
