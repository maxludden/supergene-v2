<p>The next morning, Han Sen was waiting for Huangfu Pingqing in front of the teleport station.</p>

<p>He got a text from the Office of Academic Affairs when he just saw Huangfu Pingqing. In the text, he was asked to attend a training by Situ Qing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry. I have to go.&#8221; Han Sen showed Huangfu Pingqing the text.</p>

<p>Huangfu Pingqing took a look and frowned. &#8220;If this is the Situ Qing that I have heard of, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A vice president of Blackhawk. He used to be an archery coach in the military and had a nickname Nazi&#8230;&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing told something about Situ Qing to Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two years ago, there was a training by him which ended in a couple of days because of the complaints from the students. I didn&#8217;t realize that the school would still allow him to do this. Be careful and our agreement can wait.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing left.</p>

<p>Han Sen did some research on the online school community and got a better idea who Situ Qing was.</p>

<p>Based on the text from the Office of Academic Affairs, Han Sen came to an indoor training facility. When he arrived, he felt that something was off.</p>

<p>In the entire facility, he was the only trainee. The student advisor Situ Xiang and a nice looking, well-dressed middle-aged man were waiting for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Han Sen, this is Coach Situ Qing. From today, he will be training you for a month. You need to study hard under his guidance.&#8221; Situ Xiang patted Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder and left.</p>

<p>Situ Xiang smirked secretly, &#8220;Boy, I&#8217;ll come back and see how miserable you are in a few days. By that time, you will beg me to take you with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen shrugged and came over to Situ Qing.</p>

<p>The coach smiled at Han Sen, &#8220;Han Sen, I&#8217;ve heard about you. You&#8217;re very popular in our school. I heard that you are voted the most desirable date by girls. You have good grades and many talents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You flatter me, coach.&#8221; When talking to Situ Qing, Han Sen maintained the standard stance of a soldier, which he learned during the military training.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean it. I see great potentials in you and believe that you are the hope of our Archery Department. I will do everything I can to teach you everything I know so that you can help revitalize the department.&#8221; Situ Qing patted Han Sen on his shoulder. It seemed he meant everything he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, coach.&#8221; Han Sen stood up straight and said.</p>

<p>Situ Qing smiled and reached his right hand in front of Han Sen. There was a piece of metal of 1 inch by 1 inch. It looked like Z-steel.</p>

<p>Situ Qing&#8217;s hand suddenly gained the color and texture of gold. It was nowhere near human&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p><em>Crack!</em></p>

<p>With a light squeeze, Situ Qing&#8217;s fingers flattened the Z-steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a little gift for you.&#8221; Situ Qing put the piece of Z-steel in Han Sen&#8217;s hand with a smile.</p>

<p>Han Sen understood very well that it was a warning.</p>

<p>But it was indeed impressive. Han Sen could not achieve that so far. He had read about this kind of strength on the Skynet. It was a kind of martial arts that could only be practiced by evolvers. The concept was to change the structure of their body cells and turn them into metal.</p>

<p>Even if Han Sen could get his hands on martial arts like this, his body could not take it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; Han Sen accepted the gift with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright. Here begins our training. We will start with the horse-riding stance. Ordinary people would think that archery relies on the strength of one&#8217;s arms and fingers, which is wrong. Most strength needed in archery comes from the waist and belly. This morning we will practice your core strength with horse-riding stance.&#8221; Situ Qing instructed Han Sen to make the stance and sat down in the chair, watching him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coach, a small request?&#8221; said Han Sen while making the stance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can try. But normally I would not grant anything. And talking would only make it harder. If you fall before lunch, then you will have to do the same thing in the afternoon.&#8221; Situ Qing narrowed his eyes and said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coach, one of my hobbies is black and white boxing. During the training, I&#8217;m not allowed to go on the Skynet, and this is not something I can practice alone. After training, could you join me?&#8221; Han Sen continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Black and white boxing? No need to wait until the training&#8217;s over. We can do it now. I heard that you are rather good at it and gave St. Germain a 0 on our behalf. That was very nice, but after all, it was a competition on the unevolved level. I will give you some guidance now to make sure that you can beat the Alliance Central Military Academy next time.&#8221; Situ Qing was very interested in black and white boxing and no longer required Han Sen to make the horse-riding stance.</p>

<p>Han Sen walked over to Situ Qing with a smile. He had learned from Huangfu Pingqing that although Situ Qing taught archery, his biggest hobby was black and white boxing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on. You attack first. Watch Me and I&#8217;ll teach you how to do defense the right way.&#8221; Situ Qing curled his finger at Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the confident coach and had a strange smile on his face.</p>

<p>When it came to real combat, he could not beat Situ Qing. However, when it came to black and white boxing, strength was not the only factor.</p>

<p>Situ Qing thought highly of himself in black and white boxing due to his decades of practice. Han Sen&#8217;s request pleased him very much.</p>
