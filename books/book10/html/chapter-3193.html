<p>Qin Bai pulled Han Sen away from the doors of the Feng family
castle and asked, “Han Sen, why have you come looking for me?”.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Qin Bai as he asked, “Mister Crown Prince,
have you been to the alpha temple?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I have been there. Every year, when we perform
sacrifices, we have to kneel for half the day. We have to kowtow
and bow. It is all so very annoying.” Qin Bai looked as if he did
not have many fond memories of his trips to the alpha temple. He
looked like he hated the place quite a bit. He strangely asked,
“Why are you asking me about it?” Han Sen laughed and said, “I have
heard there is a very powerful treasure in the alpha temple. Do you
know what it is, Crown Prince?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? How can a place like the alpha
temple have great treasure? It is just a temple with an alpha
statue inside it and a few tools for sacrifices, of course. There
is nothing else there, so why would there be treasure?” Qin Bai
joined the sacrifices every year. He knew what was inside the alpha
temple.</p>
<p>“Aside from these things, are you sure there is nothing?” When
Han Sen heard that, he felt disappointed. If Qin Xiu really had put
Wan’er’s dead body inside the alpha temple, there should have been
some kind of evidence. There couldn’t be nothing at all.</p>
<p>Qin Bai thought for a bit and said, “There are some weird
things, but they are not treasures. For instance, there is a well
there.”</p>
<p>“What kind of well?” Han Sen’s eyes suddenly brightened.</p>
<p>After thinking a moment, Qin Bai said, “The alpha temple has one
main and two sub halls. There are three halls in total. The right
hall features an old well. It is octagon-shaped. The well has the
alpha’s writing on it. He wrote down the word ‘destiny.’ Therefore,
the well is called Destiny Well. People frequently call it the
country well.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Qin Bai looked around and saw that nobody was
around. He quietly told Han Sen, “I have heard that the well can be
quite creepy. There is a chain thicker than an arm on the platform.
The chain leads all the way down the well. I heard that the chains
have locked up a suppressed pulse god beast from the Qin Kingdom. I
heard these stories when I was a young boy. The suppressed pulse
god beast helped the Qin Kingdom suppress luck. It has kept the Qin
Kingdom going for 1,000 autumns and 10,000 generations and made the
kingdom rich forever.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen heard that, he was so happy, he thought, “If
Wan’er’s body is in the alpha temple, it will probably be in the
Destiny</p>
<p>Well.”</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Han Sen told Qin Bai, “I have heard
about the powerful treasure residing inside Destiny Well.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s head shook like a drum. “Impossible! I do not know if
Destiny Well has a suppressed pulse god beast, but that is an odd
place to put treasure. The legends claim that the alpha put the Qin
Kingdom in a very good situation. In the second generation, it was
said the alpha’s son was very naughty. During a sacrifice, he
decided to answer the call of nature right inside Destiny Well.
Afterward, the Qin Kingdom’s fortunes soured. It was bad for many
years. It almost destroyed the kingdom. It was all because of that
incident. As a result, all the kings use this story to educate
their family members. They must not do anything bad to the Destiny
Well. If it was not for having to attend ritual sacrifice, I’d
never visit the alpha temple of my own volition.” Although Qin Bai
was a bit naughty and spoiled, there were limits to his own
tenacity.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are not planning on doing anything in the Destiny
Well, are you? I would advise you to put those thoughts to bed
right now.” Qin Bai looked around and pulled Han Sen into a corner.
He quickly said, “You must not go there. There are very scary
elites guarding there. They are the greatest defenders of the Qin
Kingdom. Even if Jade Wall City was broken, you could not
infiltrate that one zone. Without the permission of my father, not
even I can visit there freely. You are strong, but if you went
there alone, not even you would make it back.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai was sincerely looking out for Han Sen’s best interest.
He would not have told Han Sen the secrets of the temple if he did
not want what was best for him.</p>
<p>“Oh, what kind of scary characters?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Qin Bai shook his head. “I am not entirely sure. That is just
what my father told me. When I have been by Destiny Well, I have
never seen anyone guarding the place. I am fairly sure it is the
truth. What father tells me is never incorrect, and he never lets
me tell anyone else about this stuff. He says that if I ever
encounter a crisis in which I cannot solve and my life is
threatened, all I must do is escape to the alpha temple. Once
there, I can find help and someone to save me.”</p>
<p>Hearing Qin Bai say that, Han Sen was sure there was something
unusual about the alpha temple. Even if it was not Wan’er’s body,
it likely had something important to do with the Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>“The alpha temple has the Qin Kingdom’s strongest guardians. If
I forced entry, it might end up bad for me.” Although Han Sen was
strong, under the suppression of the world’s rules, he was not sure
if he had what it took to fend off the Qin Kingdom if it entirely
turned against him.</p>
<p>“This is giving me a headache.” In Han Sen’s heart, he was
feeling a bit depressed.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, if you really want to look at Destiny Well, I can take
you there during a time of sacrifice,” Qin Bai said. “Outside of
those times, it is not wise to visit.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes looked bright as he asked Qin Bai, “When the next
sacrifice rolls around, can you take me there?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can.” Qin Bai smiled and said, “There will only be
royals, officers, and chosen people that are allowed to go in. If
you would like to enter, you can disguise yourself as my
servant.”</p>
<p>“Are your servants expected to be eunuchs?” Han Sen asked with a
weird look.</p>
<p>“They are eunuchs,” Qin Bai answered with a nod.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to become a eunuch. Aside from that, there
did not seem to be another way to get close to Destiny Well. It was
the only thing he could do.</p>
<p>He told Qin Bai that the next time there was a sacrifice, he
wanted to be taken along. For now, Han Sen gave up on the plans of
infiltrating the Qin Kingdom’s alpha temple.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, Thousand Mile Reach and Teacher Jia have not stopped
being mean to me. My days have been poor. Do you think there is a
way in which they might stop being so mean to me?” Qin Bai looked
at Han Sen as if he was a beacon of hope.</p>
<p>“They are being harsh because they want you to be good,” Han Sen
said with a smile. “You only need to do your homework. Do that, and
you will be fine.”</p>
<p>“You say that like it is easy,” Qin Bai said while he cried.
“There are six teachers and a dozen nannies. There are so many of
them teaching me. I have to learn everything. If I don’t eat or
sleep, it is likely I still wouldn’t learn it all before the day I
die.”</p>
<p>Han Sen pitied Qin Bai. He loved to fool around, but he was born
to a royal family. Furthermore, he was the only successor. He could
tell how much the Qin Kingdom king wanted him to be good before he
ascended.</p>
<p>Normal people would just control how to use gene races. Qin Bai
was the Qin Kingdom’s future king. Controlling gene races was not
enough. There was too much he had to learn.</p>
<p>After thinking a moment, Han Sen had an idea. “How about this? I
have been planning a trip recently. Why don’t you go to the king
and ask for permission to join me on this trip to learn?”</p>
