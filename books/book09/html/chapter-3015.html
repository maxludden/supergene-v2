<p>Han Sen looked at Han Yufei as he said, “If you are willing to
explain, then I should be able to understand.”</p>
<p>Han Yufei was non-committal. She coldly said, “Aside from
Ancient God and God Spirits, the universe’s creatures have a mortal
life. Do you know what determines their lifespan?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it and said, “Different creatures all have
different lengths of life. That is usually determined by their
genes.”</p>
<p>Han Yufei nodded. “Indeed, unless they die by accident.
Otherwise, what affects their lifespan is usually down to what is
in their genes. Different creatures have different genes that
determine the length of their life. But that is not something
absolute. In fact, many other variables can affect a lifespan. For
example, there is cryosleep technology in the universe. That is
very common. It can slow down the renewal of genes and extend one’s
life.” “Cryosleep technology is a stupid idea. When you are frozen,
it is like you are dead. In the meantime, it is totally pointless.
Compared to that, there are high-class time geno arts that can make
your body clock stop so the genes in your body never renew.
Technically, you would be immortal and forever young.”</p>
<p>“Just like you.” Han Sen looked at Han Yufei as he spoke. Han
Yufei had been trapped in Two Worlds Mountain for god knows how
many billions of years, yet she had maintained a youthful image.
She had not died. That must have been a result of time powers.</p>
<p>Han Yufei did not answer Han Sen. She went on to say, “According
to the theory, many creatures can be immortal. In fact, it is not
like that. No matter if normal creatures or true god xenogeneics
have a powerful time power, if they live longer than their gene’s
lifespan, they will die by accident. Before Sacred appeared, that
was very common. Powerful existences, such as true dragons or
phoenixes, no matter how powerful they are or how strong their
lifeforce, will die at some point in time.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the God Spirits take the lifespan of
creatures?” Han Sen’s head flashed. He thought about the God
Spirits stealing one’s lifespan.</p>
<p>Han Yufei nodded and said, “Yes. It is like that. When Sacred
appeared, they forced open the space barrier. They forced the god
palaces to appear and killed god knows how many of the God Spirits
that descended. The god palaces were heavily damaged. After I was
set free, I saw many old antiques that remained alive. Some even
hailed from Sacred’s time. With their current lifespan, they cannot
live much longer. The only explanation is that because of Sacred’s
god fights, there was a flaw in the God Spirit’s control. That is
how they were able to use all methods to live up until now. Before
Sacred, this had never happened.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean killing God Spirits is to obtain immortality?”
Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Although what Han Yufei was saying made sense, Han Sen still
thought there was something amiss.</p>
<p>“Immortality, to me, isn’t what I am looking for, but I don’t
like the feeling of being restricted and calculated. How long I
live is something I should determine. After all, it is my life. The
God Spirits are trying to take those rights away. I am not going to
allow them to succeed. I want them to feel what it feels like to
have their lives in the hands of others.” Han Yufei used her hands
to lift her black-framed glasses as she spoke.</p>
<p>“This woman… She is insane…” Han Sen had to admit Han Yufei was
the scariest woman he had ever met.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly remembered the scroll. Han Yufei’s crime was
committing blasphemy against a God Spirit. Her crime was worse than
God’s Retribution. Now, it was starting to make sense.</p>
<p>Han Sen was pretty sure that in the Sacred era, she must have
conducted tests on the God Spirits. That was probably a crime that
was worse than slaying a God Spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at Han Yufei as he asked, “What about Sacred
Leader? Did he kill gods because of that?”</p>
<p>“That is what he told me, but I do not think that is the real
reason. At the very least, he did not do it just for himself. He
was probably doing it for someone else.” After saying that, Han
Yufei went silent.</p>
<p>“Wan’er?” Han Sen said the name and watched Han Yufei’s
reaction.</p>
<p>Han Yufei looked shocked. She asked, “Do you know Wan’er?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “More than just know her.”</p>
<p>Han Yufei did not wait for Han Sen’s answer. She kept speaking.
“Yes, that was who Sacred Leader loved the most. Sacred Leader’s
reason for killing the gods was probably because of Wan’er.
Otherwise, with his power, avoiding God Spirits to live would not
have been difficult.”</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed Han Yufei’s tone was a bit off. He quickly
asked, “Was Wander Sacred Leader’s real sister?”</p>
<p>“Although Sacred Leader kept saying Wan’er was his real sister,
I know for sure that Wan’er was not his real sister because Wan’er
was not the same race as him,” Han Yufei said with certainty. “How
do you know they are not from the same race?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, Wan’er was one of my people.” Han Yufei lifted her
lips as she spoke. “With the title, she should be calling me
auntie. I watched her grow up. Do you think I am wrong?”</p>
<p>“What? Wan’er is the same race as you? What race do you belong
to?” Han Sen’s eyes opened wide as he looked at Han Yufei. Even
now, he did not know which race Han Yufei belonged</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>“Witch,” Han Yufei said with a sigh. “Our race almost became
extinct a long, long time ago. I don’t think anyone in this
universe has heard our name before. Aside from me, I do not believe
any others are alive. Back then, there were Tai Yi, Qing Jun, and
Purple Fight. Now, they are…”</p>
<p>“Tai Yi? Qing Jun? Purple Fight? Are they all witches?” Han
Sen’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Han Yufei developed a wry smile. “Not anymore. Qing Jun has
become Sky God. He is not a Witch anymore. Purple Fight is dead.
The Purple Fight in Two Worlds Mountain was just his will. As for
Tai Yi, he is missing. I am afraid he might have been killed in the
god fights.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Han Sen felt extremely weird. He had not
expected Wan’er and Han Yufei to come from the same race or to
learn that Qing Jun and Tai Yi were once a Witch.</p>
<p>After the god palaces appeared, Han Sen had been looking for
Qing Jun’s god temple. He wanted to kill him so that he could exact
vengeance. He had searched the entire length of the god palaces and
was unable to locate Qing Jun’s flag. He did not know which god
temple he resided within.</p>
<p>Regarding Tai Yi and the Metal God Temple, Han Sen was not able
to find it. That made Han Sen feel strange.</p>
<p>Han Sen told her about his encounter with Tai Yi and how he
repaired the Metal God Temple, broke space, and departed. He wanted
to know what she might say. After Han Yufei heard that, she looked
shocked. She asked, “Is Tai Yi still alive?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but he fixed Metal God Temple and broke space,” Han Sen
said. “I have not seen Metal God Temple amidst the others since the
god palaces appeared. What is that all about?” Han Yufei laughed.
“Of course, you were unable to find it. The Metal God Temple is the
god temple Sacred tried to recreate. He wanted to replace the
original god temple to become the leader of the universe so they
would not be restricted by the god palaces and geno hall. They
wanted to replace the entirety of the god palaces. Before they
could succeed, Sacred was destroyed, and Metal God Temple was
ruined. I did not know Tai Yi rebooted Metal God Temple.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to say something, but he felt the entire
laboratory start to shake. The ice walls were breaking. Even the
metal was breaking. It was like there was an earthquake.</p>
<p>Some scary presence covered the entire place. Even with Han
Sen’s slowed reaction, he sensed how scary it was.</p>
