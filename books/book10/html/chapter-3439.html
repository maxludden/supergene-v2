<p>“Don’t be too surprised,” God said with a laugh. “I am the Geno Hall Leader. I cannot allow everyone to know I actually joined the geno tablet fights. Finding a doppelganger to stand in for me is not too difficult.”</p>

<p>Han Sen understood that the geno hall and geno tablet’s relationship was like the ruling party and opposition party. The Geno Hall Leader was the real president. Allowing another president to join the election for another party was very inappropriate. “Is Crape Myrtle another one of your names?” Han Sen asked. God shook his head. “No. Crape Myrtle is my real name. It’s just that no one knows that.”</p>

<p>“I say, Big Brother Crape Myrtle, what are you supposed to be doing with me? Why did you pull me into the geno hall now of all times?” Han Sen was not in much of a mood for spending time idle chit-chatting with Crape Myrtle.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle said, “With your power, it might not be enough to beat that person. So, until you can learn how to control your body, I do not recommend that you fight him.”</p>

<p>“If I do not fight, it is Bao’er who will end up fighting him,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>“Therefore, you do not have much time,” Crape Myrtle said. “That is why we must begin now.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Han Sen could guess what was going on, but he did not know precisely what Crape Myrtle was going to do. Crape Myrtle pointed at the jade wall and asked, “Do you know why the universe of kingdoms doesn’t have race lanterns but has god temples, and why the geno universe has race lanterns but no god temples?”</p>

<p>“I would like to know the answer to that,” Han Sen told him.</p>

<p>“Energy transferal comes from Yin and Yang.” Crape Myrtle smiled and said, “In layman’s terms, when you eat a cake, you do not shit out a cake.”</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at Crape Myrtle with a frozen expression. He could not believe a person like Crape Myrtle could speak in such a crude manner.</p>

<p>“Cough! Cough! I once heard this from a very interesting person while I was traveling. It may be very crude, but it does make sense.” Crape Myrtle coughed and went on to say, “The reincarnation of two universal lives are the same. The two universal lives have Yin and Yang. Although Yin and Yang are reverses of each other, it does not have to mean the world is split between Yin and Yang. But if you have to separate it, which universe would you believe to be in?”</p>

<p>After thinking for a moment, Han Sen said, “The geno universe feels a bit more like it is Yin.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?” Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen with interest.</p>

<p>“That is because the geno universe does not have any pure humans,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>“What you are saying is correct,” Crape Myrtle said. “The geno universe is more like Yin, but that is not because there are no humans. It is because life there is more original.”</p>

<p>“Original?” Han Sen did not understand Crape Myrtle.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle did not explain. “I do not have time to explain why I do not have time to explain. You can treat it like life in the universe of kingdoms is covered in human skin. In the geno universe, you have removed the human skin.”</p>

<p>After that, Crape Myrtle pointed at the jade wall and said, “This jade wall has recorded all of the gene races that have become higher races. Of course, it is not just the names of the higher races here. It has recorded the progress of the gene race while growing up. This jade wall is called the evolution wall.”</p>

<p>“You did not just bring me here to tell me about this, did you?” Han Sen looked at the evolution wall as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Your body has evolved differently to every other creature in this universe. That means you have lost your way and now need to forge your own. No one can guide you. You are lost in the wild by your lonesome. I do believe this evolution wall can help you a bit though. It should at least be able to help you understand yourself some more.” After Crape Myrtle said that, he put his hands against the evolution wall.</p>

<p>A lot of text on the evolution wall was lighting up. The text released lots of god music.</p>

<p>Every word had been normal. Now, the words had flesh and bones. They had their own presence. If one looked at them once, one would never forget them. It was like it was not even text and was something that was actually alive.</p>

<p>When Han Sen looked at the Feather, he saw an angel with white wings. When he looked at the word Buddha, he saw a Buddha that looked very serious.</p>

<p>Each word represented the god music of each race. It was not that they really existed. It was just like a stereotype of what was best for each race.</p>

<p>While Han Sen was watching, he saw the evolution wall display some text that was shining like a sun.</p>

<p>Han Sen recognized the word meant Sky. It meant the Sky race. The race of the Sky was an offshoot of the Very High. They looked fairly human-like, but they had the presence of the Sky.</p>

<p>In that prettiness, Han Sen saw a man from the Sky come out of the evolution wall. That man looked like Sky Palace Leader. He rather looked like Yu Shanxin and Lone Bamboo.</p>

<p>This man had all the benefits of the Sky. He was powerful. He was evil. He was stubborn. He was fearless. He carried all of the talents of the sky that Han Sen did not know in the past.</p>

<p>The presence he released made Han Sen feel as if he was superior.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle went on to say, “The evolution wall can create the final mode of a race. Although it is just a theory and does not really exist, all creatures will follow this trace with an accuracy of 90% unless there is ever a strange accident. Otherwise, the race’s final evolution will resemble this.”</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the Sky man and made an educated guessed. He asked, “Is that what happened to the Sky when they became Universe class?”</p>

<p>“No, not really. Across all of history, from ancient times until now, at least 10,000 races have managed to become a higher race. No matter how much you calculate, no one from any of these races has become Universe class. Although they are different races and have different potentials, the way they can reach the highest point is different. Even if they are the greatest race from ancient times, they can only reach the God Chaos Party Leader’s level at best. That is still half a step away from reaching Universe class.” Crape Myrtle looked at the text depicting the Sky and said, “The talent of the Sky, and their potential, is great. After all of these generations of evolution in the Sky, if they can push their potential to the max and ultimately reach that step, even when compared to me, there would not be much of a difference. Of course, right now, the Sky are far away from reaching this level, so all of this is just an assumption.” Han Sen looked at the evolution wall and asked, “Do you want the evolution wall to predict the passage of my evolution?” Crape Myrtle shook his head. With a wry smile, he said, “As a matter of fact, I have already tried. It does not work. The evolution of your genes has gone down a track no other ordinary creature has ever achieved. The power of the evolution wall does not work for your body.”</p>

<p>“In that case, what are you even trying to say?” Han Sen did not understand what Crape Myrtle wanted.</p>

<p>“The evolution wall is useless for you, but it can predict the futures of all the other races,” Crape Myrtle smile at Han Sen and said, “Therefore, it can be useful for you. You should try it. Do not make me wait too long.” Han Sen suddenly felt dizzy. He was sucked into the evolution wall.</p>
