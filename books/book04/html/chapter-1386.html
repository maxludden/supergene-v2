    <p>
      Black Mountain God frowned upon seeing his enemy. All he could see was a
      black shadow, and he could not even make out his opponent’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had also used Dongxuan Aura to hide his entire body, since it had
      reached that level. He could be properly seen if his opponent was
      considerably stronger than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just in case that didn’t work, he was clad in armor. There was always
      the chance his enemy had a geno core that could boost their eyesight, so
      he made sure to wear armor in the event that might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name is Black Mountain God. I hail from Sacred Shelter. Tell me; what
      is your name?” Black Mountain God was unable to see his opponent’s face,
      and neither could he tell whether the shadow was a spirit or creature. The
      fact that he might be a human did not even cross Black Mountain God’s
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to be number one more than anything, and he wasn’t really
      interested in who his enemy was. Unfortunately, Sacred Shelter had told
      him to do what he could to unmask this new rival, and so, he had to at
      least ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen threw the Crystal Egg towards his opponent. It barreled through
      the air, spinning like a bullet as it went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God was surprised, to say the least. He wasn’t expecting
      such haste from his enemy, and with the number one geno core coming right
      for him, he swiftly summoned his Heart Wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a creature, too. If he died then and there, he died then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Heart Wheel’s radius of yellow light was wide. And in that light, the
      Crystal Core was frozen stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both shocked, seeing the egg get stopped still like that. They
      were both expecting more from the number one geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God was especially surprised for this, whereas Han Sen was
      disheartened more than anything. He expected a finer performance,
      considering it had been reinforced nine times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God could not believe it was practically over already. He
      cast his Heart Wheel with even greater strength, confident he had stopped
      the egg for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heart Wheel was one of the best bronze geno cores in the sanctuary, and
      under the light it emitted, the Crystal Core began to melt.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did I become number one with such a garbage geno core?!” Han Sen now
      knew he’d have to get his hands dirty if he wanted to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God couldn’t believe he had destroyed the geno core with
      the power of his Heart Wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was that a Geno Core Storage error? Or am I just fortunate enough to
      wield something that strikes the Crystal Core’s weakspot?” Black Mountain
      God then took off into the air. He had a spring in his step, and he wished
      to melt the egg as much as he could, and reduce it to nothing but dust in
      the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shell was half melted as this occurred. With the light continuing to
      increase in volume, it wouldn’t last. It was sure to be game over very
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to attack Black Mountain God and stop what the Heart Wheel
      was doing. There, he could use his full power, and he was still confident
      he could beat down the winged wretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had come here for revenge, after all. He wasn’t going to lose
      again to a crony of Sacred Shelter, and on top of that, grant them first
      place on the leaderboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, Han Sen suddenly felt as if his Crystal Core was exuding a
      strange power only he could feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, and watching his melting egg continued to fill him
      with a strange sensation. He thought to himself, “The Crystal Core looks
      like an egg, and I’ve even been referring to it as an egg, for the most
      part. What if it actually IS an egg? What if there’s something inside it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could sense it becoming stronger, so he stopped going after Black
      Mountain God and just stared at the Crystal Core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God had no clue what was happening, but he believed it to
      be something swell. He was thrilled with himself, and he giddily cackled,
      “Pah! This is the first rank geno core? Today is the day I become number
      one, for I am going to utterly annihilate this thing. Mwahaha!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen stood atop a decaying, sand-worn tower, watching his precious egg
      melt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the shell that was melting, and Han Sen could now most certainly
      tell there was something powerful residing inside it.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      The eggshell finally began to collapse, and from the spots where parts of
      the shell had fallen to the ground, intense beams of light were shining
      upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s going on? Is something changing? Did I get ahead of myself?” Black
      Mountain God frowned, but he was still fairly certain in his ability to
      beat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The geno core had been sitting in the light for the longest time. It was
      like an ant under a magnifying glass, and he knew it should have been
      destroyed by now. There was definitely something amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God then exerted even more power and strength to destroy
      the egg. He wanted it gone for good, just in case something else was to
      happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      More of the shell began to crumble into nothing beneath that light, and
      the entire composition of it became thinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But eventually, Black Mountain God got his wish. The egg had entirely
      crumbled into nothing of note, and it simply looked like the trampled egg
      of some forgotten creature in the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two combatants looked at the broken egg and noticed a jade-like item
      residing inside it. Strangely, it had no color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, seeing his egg now appear like so. The item inside
      was a skeleton, but it seemed composed, unlike the rest of the egg. It
      almost looked like a Buddha, legs crossed in lotus pose. However, it
      exuded a strange aura. One that was equal parts holiness and genuine evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised seeing this, and he thought to himself, “Did it
      break too soon? Was it supposed to be a Buddha, but only its skeleton has
      been left behind due to the light?”
