<h2>Holy Town</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2287</h3>

<p>That familiar feeling was only present for a single second. When
he looked closely at Mister White again, the man was like a
stranger once more. He no longer seemed like anyone Han Sen already
knew.</p>
<p>Whatever Han Sen might have momentarily felt, Mister White was
of the Extreme King. Han Sen didn’t know much about the Extreme
King, all-in-all, and there was no one amongst them that he was
actually close with. No one would ever claim that Mister White was
a close friend of his, either.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Han Sen considered Mister White’s
suggestion.</p>
<p>To be honest, Mister White’s suggestion greatly tempted Han Sen.
After all, Han Sen wasn’t entirely sure Yisha could defeat Fox
Queen in combat.</p>
<p>And even if Yisha won and continued traveling with him, he would
have to share whatever treasure he found with her.</p>
<p>They had a good relationship, and they were close enough to
practically be considered family. But at the end of the day, their
relationship was still built on the foundation that Yisha had no
clue Han Sen was the almighty Dollar. If Yisha found out that Han
Sen was Dollar, there was no telling what she might do.</p>
<p>After all, Dollar had not been kind to Yisha.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to go ahead and explore the Sacred Leader’s
treasury with Mister White. He didn’t have to plan out everything
in advance. He could betray whoever he needed to whenever he wanted
to. He could take any item he required when the time to do so
arose. If Han Sen needed to leave these two behind, he would do it
without a second thought.</p>
<p>It was a very business-like mindset: they were all striving for
personal benefit, and they would only cooperate when they needed to
use one another.</p>
<p>Han Sen needed Mister White to guide him safely to where the
treasure lay. Mister White needed the relic Han Sen carried. They
were both using each other for their own purposes.</p>
<p>And when Han Sen found the treasure, even if Han Sen didn’t
betray them, it was likely that Crime and Mister White would be the
ones betraying him.</p>
<p>Of course, the most important thing was that Han Sen would be
capable of betraying Mister White. He just couldn’t do that in
front of Fox Queen and Yisha.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time to wait around. If there is a winner of that
battle, neither of us will have the chance to explore that city,”
Mister White said to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen went silent. He looked at Mister White and asked, “You
guys destroyed the fourth checkpoint. Did you find anything
there?”</p>
<p>Han Sen cared about the item in the fourth checkpoint a great
deal. There was a high chance that whatever item was retrieved
there would prove useful when they reached the treasure.</p>
<p>Mister White went silent, then said, “When Fox Queen destroyed
the thirty-six stone pillars there, she found the jade flute inside
the last pillar.”</p>
<p>“That jade flute didn’t belong to Fox Queen originally?” Han Sen
remembered that Fox Queen had been locked inside Ghost Bone’s
palace for the longest time. Han Sen had seen no evidence of the
flute there, so why would she suddenly possess it now? It made
sense that she had gotten it from the fourth checkpoint, but Han
Sen was unable to see how the jade flute connected to the other
checkpoints and the items they had yielded.</p>
<p>Mister White didn’t say anything. He just waited for Han Sen to
make a decision.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking. He used a finger to point at the skeleton
in the chair. “This sea seems special. He dived into this deep sea
with the intent of reaching its holy town. That is how he became
like this in the first place.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Mister White said simply. “That is why we need the
relic you have. It will allow us to reach the holy town
safely.”</p>
<p>“Okay. In that case, we will go and explore the holy town.” Han
Sen made his mind up.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know where the holy town was, but Mister White
obviously did. Han Sen followed him and Crime. They left the white
whale and dove deeper, going so far under the sea that they reached
the deep sea.</p>
<p>The sea waves down there were incredibly strong. Clearly, Fox
Queen and Yisha were still engaged in combat. It would take a long
time for one of them to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried about Yisha’s well-being. With her
abilities, even if she was unable to triumph over Fox Queen, he
didn’t think Fox Queen had what it took to kill Yisha.</p>
<p>And if Fox Queen couldn’t defeat Yisha, then he might as well
head for the holy town.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already learned of a way in which he could
commandeer and pilot the white whale, but he saw no reason to use
it just yet. Perhaps it would prove useful in the future.</p>
<p>With Mister White’s guidance, Han Sen went deeper and deeper.
The further they went, the quieter the sea became. The shockwaves
Yisha and Fox Queen were creating didn’t reach those levels.</p>
<p>“If my calculations are correct, then the Sacred Leader’s
treasure should be someplace inside this trench.” Mister White
pointed to a large underwater trench in front of him.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked down into the trench and saw nothing but
darkness. It was like a bottomless abyss. Even using the power of
the Purple-Eye Butterfly, he still couldn’t see what lurked
within.</p>
<p>Without too much hesitation, though, Mister White and Crime
continued to swim down. Han Sen rode the blood kirin after them.
They all headed into the darkness of the deep trench.</p>
<p>A little ways down, Han Sen felt as if something was amiss. The
stone plate in his pocket started to burn.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out the stone plate, and when he did, the plate
glowed with a holy light. It lit up a small pocket of brightness
amidst the suffocating dark of that place.</p>
<p>“Just as I thought! Only people who have the relic can enter the
place that holds the true treasures of the Sacred Leader.” Mister
White seemed to have expected this, and he eyed the stone plate as
he spoke.</p>
<p>The three of them and the beast continued to venture down. The
water around them was very dark and creepy. No matter how strong
their vision was, they could only see within the small pouch of
light that the stone plate provided them. Everything else was
pitch-black. Nothing else could be seen, as if the entire world had
gone black.</p>
<p>They didn’t know if this was the work of an illusion or not, but
Han Sen could feel countless eyes peering at them from beyond the
black.</p>
<p>Time passed. Han Sen had no clue how deep they had dived by this
point, but the trench was like a bottomless abyss. No matter how
deep they went, there appeared to be no end.</p>
<p>When he looked up, he found that it was pitch-black above him,
too. The light couldn’t penetrate the sea to such depths.</p>
<p>They created small waves in the water as they swam, but there
was no other movement. Yisha and Fox Queen’s fight didn’t reach
them at all anymore.</p>
<p>Because it was too dark there, even the blood kirin started to
feel nervous. It kept releasing quiet moans and groans as it
swam.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his hands to stroke the blood kirin’s neck and
bring it a bit of comfort.</p>
<p>The blood kirin had always been so moody and angry, and telling
him to be quiet would be harder than making him bleed.</p>
<p>Mister White, however, looked calm. Crime was a little nervous,
though. It looked like he was feeling the same fear as the blood
kirin. They felt as if they were being watched by phantom eyes in
the dark.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew for sure that something bad lurked out of sight. If
it wasn’t for his hands holding that relic, their small group would
have already ended up like the master of the white whale.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it looked like a blurry halo appeared around Han Sen’s
feet in the dark. He focused on that little halo.</p>
<p>But the halo was too blurry, and he couldn’t see it clearly.</p>
<p>Mister White and Crime also saw the halo. They looked down and
checked it out.</p>
<p>As their bodies descended, that blurry light became clearer and
larger. When Han Sen finally got a good look at what was in that
halo, he opened his mouth.</p>
