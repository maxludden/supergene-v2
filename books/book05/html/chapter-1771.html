	<p>The wall itself cracked when Hai’er slammed into it. The Pirate Bone Sword in Hai’er’s hands was knocked out of
		her grip.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant threw another punch towards Hai’er. But the girl’s eyes were very round, and she said quietly,
		“Elephant… you really dare hurt me?”</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant’s punch was like that of an elephant’s trunk, and a scary power traveled with it. But when the
		fist came right before Hai’er, he stopped.</p>

	<p>The Zhenyue were strong, and people considered them a higher race. But he had to hold himself in check.</p>

	<p>Abandoned Thief had made them a promise, but there were limits to the protection that promise offered. If Mister
		Elephant took the item from Hai’er, and the Pirates couldn’t say anything.</p>

	<p>If he hurt Hai’er, they wouldn’t let things slide so easily.</p>

	<p>Abandoned Thief had gone on thieving sprees a lot, back in the day. The higher races of the geno hall were
		frightened due to the frequent robbing. Although Abandoned Thief was long gone, the Pirates continued his
		legacy.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant did not know if his actions could be avenged, but he’d rather not find out. After all, thieves
		never failed to keep their promises. Everyone in the universe knew the reputation of the Pirates.</p>

	<p>If Hai’er was important to them, it would risk the entirety of Zhenyue being ruined. He didn’t want to find out
		what might happen if he injured or killed her.</p>

	<p>“No…” Mister Elephant’s face was still directly in front of Hai’er. He started to say something further, but his
		face suddenly changed. He roared, lifted his arms again, and spun around.</p>

	<p>A horn arrow was racing towards his throat.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant threw his fist towards it, but the horn arrow suddenly disappeared. When it appeared again, the
		arrow was directly in front of his chest. The spinning arrow was going to pierce through his armor and drill
		through his flesh.</p>

	<p>Roar! Mister Elephant moved his body, and in that moment, he teleported one foot away. He dodged the evil arrow.
	</p>

	<p>The next second, Mister Elephant’s look of victory was replaced by fear. Another, more silent arrow, was touching
		his belly. The spinning arrow tip managed to pierce through his armor.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant moved his body and tightened his muscles. He released a burst of power, but it was too late. He
		couldn’t dodge the silent arrow.</p>

	<p>The horn arrow wasn’t sharp enough to pierce all the way into his belly. It could, however, break his bones. The
		powerful drilling force shredded muscle and bone. After inserting itself half an inch into his stomach, it
		stopped swirling.</p>

	<p>It was too late to pull it out, though. By the time he had dealt with those two arrows, Hai’er was attacking from
		behind. And although she had dropped the Pirate Bone Sword, she still had a white-fanged dagger, and she swung
		it at Mister Elephant’s back.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant grabbed Hai’er, then tossed her aside.</p>

	<p>He still didn’t want to hurt her.</p>

	<p>In the corner of his eye, though, he managed to catch a glimpse of his other attacker.</p>

	<p>When he saw the person clearly, Mister Elephant was shocked. When he saw the arrow at first, twenty names and
		faces crossed his mind. The face of his true aggressor, however, hadn’t been on the list.</p>

	<p>The person that fired at him was the creature Hai’er had used as bait. He was wearing black armor, and although
		Mister Elephant couldn’t see his face, he remembered the armor.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant always remembered what he saw, and this was not a mistake.</p>

	<p>He didn’t expect that Hai’er’s bait would still be alive at this point. And on top of that, the lesser being had
		come to Old Dragon Rock Mountain and attacked Mister Elephant twice.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant knew that anyone capable of using those arrows was not weak. And yet despite that, he knew that
		this being was merely a Baron.</p>

	<p>It was shocking that a Baron was able to hurt him. If the arrow had been any stronger, he’d have been killed.</p>

	<p>When Mister Elephant threw Hai’er away, Han Sen stepped over to the wall and picked up the Pirate Bone Sword.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had encountered several Viscounts, but Mister Elephant was far stronger than Nicai and Hawei. He was a
		greater foe in every aspect, from strength, to speed, to techniques.</p>

	<p>Hai’er was hit hard, and she was still unable to get up.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant was no longer paying attention to her, though. She was a Pirate, and she was very evil. But she
		was too weak to pose a true threat to him.</p>

	<p>For some reason, Mister Elephant was starting to feel nervous with Han Sen there. Han Sen and Hai’er were both
		Barons, but Han Sen seemed to be the more frightening of the two. Which was particularly notable considering
		that Hai’er was one of the Pirates.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant stared at Han Sen and said coldly, “I didn’t expect you to be a son of the Pirates.”</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant thought Han Sen was a Pirate, too. Otherwise, how else could he have achieved such power? His
		power was not the sort of power one could expect any Baron to possess.</p>

	<p>Even among Barons of the higher races, it was incredibly rare to see someone of that level.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything, though. He was here to kill, and that was that. He had no interest in talking. And
		it wouldn’t be a bad thing if people thought he was a Pirate, either.</p>

	<p>If the Zhenyue went after him, he’d be safer that way</p>

	<p>Han Sen lifted the sword and ran towards Mister Elephant. He ran lightly, moving with grace.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant grunted, and he used the powers of an elephant to tighten and harden his muscles. He could burst
		with energy like that for a while. Mister Elephant did not think he would lose, even to someone of a higher
		race. Since he was a Viscount, there was no way he’d lose to a Baron.</p>

	<p>But when Han Sen struck, Mister Elephant regretted his overconfidence.</p>

	<p>He had heard that an elite swordsman could gather their swordmind. They could cast blasts of air without the
		faintest movement of their sword.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant had seen this before, but only from Dukes that were talented with sword skills and possessed
		powerful sword minds.</p>

	<p>And again, this was just a Baron. But when Han Sen struck, Mister Elephant felt as if his whole world had been
		taken by that sword. The scary swordmind became tangible, and he almost couldn’t breathe.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant did not believe such a swordmind could be created by a Baron.</p>

	<p>He used to know one swordsman that had become a Duke, but not even his swordmind was as good as this Baron’s.</p>
