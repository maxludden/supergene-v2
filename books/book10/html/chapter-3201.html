<h2>Sword Shadow</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3201</h3>

<p>Han Sen clutched the bronze sword. Bao’er, Jia Shi Zhen, Qin
Bai, and Thousand Mile Reach all had their eyes open wide as they
watched him. They kept wondering whether or not Han Sen would end
up being affected by the power of the sword and was going to
repulsively dance like the man before him had done.</p>
<p>Facing a sword that could break the world, Han Sen did not dare
underestimate things. He channeled power into his hands. It was one
main power and one power reversed. The two types of power started
to surge and generate a Break World power. It was directed into the
sword through Han Sen’s hands. The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan
Yellow Sutra created this Break World power. It was able to analyze
the origin of a lifeforce. It could also dissolve and rebuild it.
That was the power it had. It could discern the building blocks of
a creature’s origin with remarkable accuracy.</p>
<p>Although its power was not strong, it was useful to all kinds of
lifeforms.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen placed his hands on the sword, the Break
World power went into the bronze sword. The sword released a scream
that shocked the sky. The sword’s body exploded with a green light.
It blocked Han Sen’s red Break World power, trying to keep it from
entering it.</p>
<p>It was not just that either. A dreamy power was coming out from
the green sword light. It went through Han Sen’s Break World power.
It felt as if electricity was zapping his brain. Some kind of scary
power had forced its way inside him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face quickly changed. The bronze sword’s power was far
stronger than he had expected it to be. It was easily contesting
his Break World power, but Han Sen had the impression that it
wasn’t even using the full breadth of its power. It had the spare
power to release a weird power. It invaded Han Sen’s brain. It
looked as if it was going to control him like Thousand Mile
Reach.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s willpower was stronger than Thousand Mile Reach’s.
Although his brain conjured some strange thoughts, Han Sen was
still able to keep a clamp on his emotions and remain still and
motionless.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to hold the sword while standing strong. He
stood so quietly that he looked like a statue. The sword’s green
light and the red light created a strong contrast that released a
wildly bright volume of light.</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked at Jia Shi Zhen and asked, “Is Han Sen going to
make it and pull through?”</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen shook her head and said, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>They really could not tell which of the two had an advantage.
Power was not the main thing. The real battle was happening in the
fields of their minds. Unless one won, outsiders could not tell
what was happening or going to happen. Han Sen had a heart like
steel, but the mental power from the sword was intense. It was like
an overobsessed girlfriend. Its love was corrosive and toxic. The
mental power it wielded was not all-encompassing, but it was
extraordinarily clingy. No matter how strong Han Sen’s will was, he
still felt as if his mental power was being beaten back by it.</p>
<p>Han Sen furrowed his brows. He did not want to end up like
Thousand Mile Reach, dancing like a horny devil in front of
everyone. He quickly gathered up his power to mentally fight
against the sword. The bronze sword’s power seemed endless. It was
like an unpredictable sea. Han Sen turned his heart into stone. He
was not going to allow anything to invade him. That was how he was
going to go against the bronze sword’s power.</p>
<p>A man and a sword kept fighting. Qin Bai and the others had
their eyes wide open as they stared at the pair. Bao’er was looking
at the sword as if deep thoughts were crossing her mind.</p>
<p>At this point, the bronze sword’s text shone, “One-inch
thinking, then one-inch gray.” The words flickered with a weird
light. As this happened, Han Sen’s face changed. He felt as if the
mental power he had been fighting was changing from a flowing river
into a tsunami that could shake the sky. He felt battered by it. A
strange scene flashed in his brain.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s brain had been overtaken by an illusion. It was one
that displayed what happened when his heart had been broken.</p>
<p>When Han Sen took a closer look at the conjured illusion, he was
shocked. The bronze sword in his illusion had taken on the shape of
a pretty woman. The woman’s eyebrows were like a beautiful
painting. She was so pretty that it did not even seem possible that
she was real.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Gu Qingcheng was the prettiest woman in any
universe and that he would never find someone prettier than her.
Even a real goddess was not prettier than Gu Qincheng.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this woman in the hallucination, Han Sen’s opinion
had been turned on its head. He did not even think Gu Qingcheng
could match the beauty and grace of the woman inside this
illusion.</p>
<p>The prettiness was not what shocked Han Sen. He had seen many
beautiful women. While they were not as pretty as the woman in this
illusion, many pretty women exuded different feelings. Han Sen had
already passed the age of being able to determine who was good and
who was bad by gauging their appearance.</p>
<p>The reason he was shocked was that this woman looked incredibly
familiar. It was like he had seen her somewhere before.</p>
<p>To be accurate, this woman looked like someone Han Sen knew very
well. Her eyebrows and eyes made Han Sen think of someone familiar.
It made Han Sen feel as if he was looking at Bao’er’s face.</p>
<p>Yes, this woman’s eyebrows were very similar to Bao’er’s, but
Bao’er had a pretty face that was cute and adorable. This woman
looked mature and pretty. Her body was not like Bao’er’s, but her
face was certainly reminiscent.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart felt a bit tempted. After seeing her face, Han
Sen was able to calm down and not be overwhelmed by the corrosive
mental powers that assaulted him.</p>
<p>“How could this happen? How could a sword wield a face that is
so familiar? Have I just imagined all this? Did I imagine what
Bao’er’s face will be like after growing up?” Han Sen was shocked,
but he did not think it was possible.</p>
<p>His will was not completely broken yet. He could not have the
heart shadow there. That woman’s face must have been a reflection
from the sword.</p>
<p>The eyebrows of the woman in the image frowned. She looked sad.
It made people want to pity her. The woman looked at Han Sen as if
she was singing and saying, “One-inch thinking, then one-inch
gray.” It was just an illusion, but Han Sen could hear that woman’s
voice loud and clear. The remarkable sound was echoing in his
brain. It kept echoing. It was getting louder.</p>
<p>The sound possessed the feeling of profound loss. As she sang
louder, Han Sen’s will followed the echo. He could not control his
emotions. Before long, he started to cry.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at the woman’s face. Only by doing that could he
see Bao’er’s shadow and not have his will be destroyed.</p>
<p>The echo of his brain was like a crazy wave. It created many
waves in his heart. His heart was under constant attack.</p>
<p>Qin Bai, Jia Shi Zhen, and the others saw that Han Sen was
crying. They felt bad and surprised about it.</p>
<p>“Is Han Sen going to be consumed by that sword?” Qin Bai
nervously asked.</p>
<p>Although he wanted to watch Han Sen dance, he was afraid
something worse had happened to him.</p>
<p>Of course, no one was able to answer him. Jia Shi Zhen and
Thousand Mile Reach had no clue what was going on either.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is not lost,” Jia Shi Zhen said with uncertainty. “He
can last a bit longer.”</p>
