<p>“Little Lover, have you not always tried to get rid of me? Now,
I am injured and cannot possibly fight back. This is the best
chance you have of killing me. Even if you just move a finger, it
will be more than enough for you to kill me.” Although big sky
demon looked terrible, she was still able to put on a smile. Her
jade arms were wrapped around Han Sen’s neck. She was like a little
cat in his arms. Her words were spoken with a sultry drawl.</p>
<p>“Why are you injured?” Han Sen knew how powerful big sky demon
was. Not many beings in this world of kingdoms should have been
able to harm her.</p>
<p>Big sky demon sighed and said, “I underestimated Qin Xiu. I only
wanted to sneak into the 33 skies and see what I could learn about
Qin Xiu there, but he found me. I could hardly make it back. Qin
Xiu is very scary. He is almost like the old leader.”</p>
<p>“What did you find there?” Han Sen asked. “I only snuck in to
the tower to learn more about Qin Xiu, but he almost killed me.
What do you think I was able to find?” Big sky demon could see the
disappointment on Han Sen’s face. She smiled and said, “I saw many
things that are called life souls inside that old tower.”</p>
<p>“How many were there?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“There were so many. I was only able to enter the old tower’s
first floor, but I saw 10 creatures being consumed by fate. I do
not know if there are any more creatures up the tower.” Big sky
demon stopped smiling. She looked extremely serious.</p>
<p>That number was something even Han Sen found to be scary. If
every life soul could be someone scary like Zhao Ning’er, Qin Xiu
would become an unrivaled force of power in the universe. Not even
the God Spirits of the geno hall would be able to fight back.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. People like Zhao Ning’er are very rare amid the
creatures that combine with life souls. So far, Zhao Ning’er is the
only success.”</p>
<p>Big sky demon paused and said, “Qin Xiu uses life souls to make
Break World beasts. If those creatures become Break World beasts,
their bodies will be made solid. They will be more powerful than
Break World elites. This is a method to evolve creatures that does
not make much sense. There are lots of flaws involved with it, so
it is unlikely to be a big success.”</p>
<p>“Solidify Break World powers? In the levels of breaking the
world, what would that be ranked?” Han Sen never figured out what
the levels of breaking the world were.</p>
<p>Big sky demon laughed. “Breaking the worlds does not have
levels. Breaking the world is breaking the world. It is just a term
used to describe controlling the powers from both worlds. The
strength is determined by how much you can control it. Ordinary
Break World people only need 1% to wield Break World powers. That
small amount is still considered enough to break the world. Some
Break World people can understand much more. After breaking the
world, their understanding of the powers from both worlds can reach
around 10%, such as yourself. I would guess that when you first
broke the world, your Break World rate was 15% to 20%.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Han Sen said. “What is all this about it being made
solid?”</p>
<p>“When the Break World rate reaches 30%, it is like water that
becomes ice. It starts to thicken and become solid. That is just a
way of describing it. It is not actually as simple as ice. Solid
Break World powers yield a lot of benefits. The powers are
increased and much stronger than before they were solid. That is
especially true regarding the rules to use power. Once they are
solid, they are more useful. So, making your Break World powers
solid is like a junction.”</p>
<p>Big sky demon paused and went on to say, “There are junctions at
60% and 90%. Reaching 60% is incredibly rare. There were not even
very many people able to do that when the God Chaos Party was
popular. As for reaching 90%, this is even rarer. Since the God
Chaos Party formed, only three vice presidents have reached that
level.”</p>
<p>“Are you telling me Bury Path God has a 90% Break World rate?”
Han Sen did not believe it.</p>
<p>Big sky demon rolled her eyes at Han Sen. “Do you really think
Bury Path God is that weak? That guy is very mysterious. If it was
not in a life-or-death moment, you would never know how strong he
truly was. He does not want to fight you. It is not because you are
so strong. It is more because he does not want to reveal his true
power. Besides, his main target is Qin Xiu, not you.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Han Sen said with a nod. He thought Bury Path God was
powerful. He had not expected Bury Path Sky God to be hiding more
about himself than he revealed.</p>
<p>“After the latest reboots, our Break World rates were weakened
in every way,” big sky demon said. “Now, going back to the popular
Break World rates will not be easy. I think Bury Path God will now
have only reached 90%. Remember, a Break World rate does not equal
one’s battle power. All rates are capable of breaking the world.
Actually, a low Break World rate can often beat high Break World
rates. In a critical moment, it all depends on one’s element and
power. Your Break World rate is not high, but your power is very
strange. You also have more than one Break World power. Even Bury
Path God is afraid of you. That is why he does not want to
fight</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen could not help but ask, “Has anyone been able to reach
100% with their Break World powers?”</p>
<p>Big Sky Demon did not hesitate to respond. “Yes. From what I
know, no matter if it was before the universe was rebooted or now,
only the God Chaos Party’s leader managed to do that.”</p>
<p>“What about Qin Xiu?” That was the person Han Sen was most
concerned about.</p>
<p>“Although he is strong, I think he is lacking something. He only
needs to take one last step, but making that final step is
extremely difficult for him.” Big Sky Demon sighed and said,
“Actually, compared to Qin Xiu, the life soul Break World beasts
are scarier. We are creatures that have practiced all of our lives,
yet it is very difficult for us to break the world. Plus, we only
have Break World rates ranging from 12% to 20%. If the Break World
beasts succeed, they have a 30% Break World rate like Zhao Ning’er.
I bet she is over 60%. Let me tell you, that is very scary.”</p>
<p>“Did you see the fight earlier?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Big sky demon nodded and said, “If I had not seen that fight, I
would not say Break World beasts are scary. Now, Qin Xiu’s skills
haven’t matured. When he can mass-produce those Break World beasts,
that is when the greatest disaster will come.”</p>
<p>Han Sen strangely looked at big sky demon. She had once been a
part of God Chaos Party. Even if her relationship with the God
Chaos Party had soured, she did not need to be this worried.</p>
<p>“Do not look at me like that,” big sky demon said. “The big
universe’s disaster does not matter to me, but it might not be
considered a good thing for you.” “I did not know you cared for me
that much,” Han Sen said with a curl of his lips.</p>
<p>Big sky demon stretched and said, “I can’t help it. It is
because you are Bao’er’s stepfather. It is fine if you die. If
something happened to Bao’er, that might not fare well.”</p>
<p>“Do you know Bao’er?” Han Sen now understood why even though big
sky demon was so strong, she never did anything to him. It was
because big sky demon already knew about Bao’er.</p>
<p>“I know her,” Big Sky Demon confirmed.</p>
<p>“Who is she?” Han Sen really wanted to know who was Bao’er.</p>
<p>“She is Bao’er. You are her stepfather, yet you don’t know her
name.” Big sky demon looked as if she was smiling at Han Sen, but
she wasn’t smiling at him. “You know that is not what I meant.” Han
Sen wanted to know who Bao’er was in her past life. He had always
wondered if Bao’er, in her past life, was the leader of the God
Chaos Party.</p>
<p>“Bao’er is Bao’er,” big sky demon seriously said. “She is
unique. She does not need anyone.” She sounded so serious, but Han
Sen thought her words were a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>“Anyway, do not let any other creatures learn about who Bao’er
really is. If that were to happen, you will be in big trouble. By
the way, I am injured now. If you want to kill me, then kill me. If
you do not want to kill me, then heal me. Your power should be good
at this.” Big sky demon leaned on Han Sen’s shoulder. She lowered
her clothes and revealed the wounds on her bones. She let him do
whatever he wanted to.</p>
