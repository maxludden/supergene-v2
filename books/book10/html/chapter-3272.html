<p>The scary harp sounds were like whips of the soul. They kept
lashing Han Sen’s heart. They interrogated the deepest recesses of
his soul. He could not avoid them.</p>
<p>If his heart was questioned, he was corroded by the asking heart
phoenix head harp’s power. As a result, Han Sen’s body kept turning
into sand. His skin was like sand, wasting away to the wind.</p>
<p>“Han Sen…” Zhao Qiu Yi gathered up power. She wanted to help Han
Sen withstand the scary harp sounds.</p>
<p>When her power touched the harp, it turned into dust. She was
blown away. Even her body was affected. Her snow-white skin looked
like sand, similar to how it was affecting Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked serious. His body and mind were trapped. He could
not use his sword either.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you can still choose to join me right now,” Bury Path
God, who was very high in the God Chaos Party, said. “I can turn
you into the vice-president of the God Chaos Party. You can be
below me but above everyone else. That is a mighty privilege.”</p>
<p>Han Sen started to look relaxed. He looked at Bury Path God and
slowly said, “The leader of the God Chaos Party should be Qin Xiu
right about now.”</p>
<p>“You and I should co-operate. Getting the God Chaos Party back
should not be difficult. I will be the leader, and you will be the
vice-president. Up the sky, down on the ground, in the Yin world,
and in the Yang world, we will be the bosses of all. We won’t
reincarnate, and we will not heed the fickle callings of destiny.
How awesome would that be?” Bury Path God was doing his best to
tempt him.</p>
<p>He did not want to take Han Sen because of his great power. The
most important thing to him was that he knew Han Sen had a special
connection to Qin Xiu and Wan’er. He knew about Qin Xiu, so he
wanted Han Sen for himself to help deal with Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>“You and I can co-operate, but I do not want to be the lesser,”
Han Sen said with a laugh. “I will be the leader, and you will be
one of the goons.”</p>
<p>“It looks like you do not know what the expensive price of life
is.” Bury Path God’s face looked dim. He put his finger on another
string and plucked it. He played more of that wretched music.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body and skin were turning into sand, but he still
looked very calm. Seeing the intense shockwave, his face did not
change. He said to himself, “Ice Jade Evil Lady, it is time you
live up to your promise. I need your power and I need it now.”</p>
<p>“It is useless to call on someone else right about now. Even if
a sky full of God Spirits were here, you would not escape death.
Under the asking heart harp’s sound, you will be rendered nothing
but dust.” Bury Path God raged as he played the harp now. The harp
sounds were coming fast.</p>
<p>An ice jade color was spreading on Han Sen’s body. His black
hair turned into ice. Even his eyes looked crystal like a jade
stone.</p>
<p>His sandy skin looked like crystal now. It was more perfect than
it was before. It was like a jade statue that had walked out from
the ice.</p>
<p>A sky full of harp sounds came, but they were unable to leave a
mark on Han Sen’s jade-like skin. Han Sen and the ice jade evil
lady combined to break the world. He now had the purest body ever.
Not a single speck of dust or dirt marred his image.</p>
<p>It was not just his skin that had become like jade. Even his
heart had become jade. He was utterly flawless. Even facing a sky
full of gods and Buddhas that sought to torture his heart, he would
not hesitate or be led astray.</p>
<p>“You have two different elemental Break World powers.” Bury Path
God frowned and looked at Han Sen. A creature that could practice
Break World powers had likely spent most of its life trying to
reach such a level.</p>
<p>Plus, people were often restricted by their nature. Ordinary
creatures could only break the world with one element. Not many
creatures could break the world with two powers. He was a special
one when it came to Break World elites.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything in response. His body had been
trapped by the sonic power, but he was now able to move. The asking
heart harp’s sound was unable to stop Han Sen’s movements. Wherever
he moved, the things he touched became clean. It was as if all the
dirt had been cleansed.</p>
<p>A short bow and an arrow appeared in Han Sen’s hand. It was the
Flying Yan Spear. He had modified it to become a bow. It was a
weapon Han Sen was very talented with.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Bury Path God. He slowly drew the string of
the bow. He pulled it to the max. He then stopped hesitating. He
let go of his fingers that were holding the bowstring.</p>
<p>The arrow carried a spinning power that tore through all the
rules. It carried a power that was imbued with the essence of Super
Spank. The Dongxuan Sutra broke the basic substances of the
universes and created a scary destructive power.</p>
<p>Bury Path God was shocked. He felt as if he could not dodge that
arrow. Through reflex, he gathered up power and lifted the asking
heart phoenix head harp to block the arrow.</p>
<p>The arrow was unbelievably fast. When the arrow tip almost
struck the asking heart phoenix head harp’s frame, the arrow
disappeared. It was like magic.</p>
<p>Bury Path God’s gaze froze. His body ripped space and fell back.
It was still too late. The black arrow weirdly appeared in his
chest. It pierced through his armor and perforated his chest.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A scary power blew Bury Path God’s body away. He was like a star
falling into the sea. He created a big tsunami. The phoenix head
harp flew away with him. In the air, it looked like a white phoenix
god bird.</p>
<p>Han Sen broke space and went to the bottom of the sea. He saw an
arrow at the bottom of the sea embedded in a rock. Bury Path God
was gone. Torn clothes were under the sea.</p>
<p>“Super Spank power hit his body, but it did not kill him. Bury
Path God is very strong.” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>He knew Bury Path God had departed, so Han Sen left too. He went
to the shore.</p>
<p>Bury Path God had departed. Planet Ning’er returned to normal.
The sea also returned to normalcy as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Zhao Qiu Yi held the Break World beast Zhao Ning’er and cried.
Zhao Ning’er became a white phoenix god bird that cried too.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are the Qin Kingdom’s No. 1 swordsman. You have an
incredible amount of power. You must have a way to help my sister
recover. I beg you to save my sister…” Zhao Qiu Yi kowtowed before
Han Sen the moment she saw him.</p>
<p>Han Sen held her body. He looked at Zhao Ning’er, who was a
Break World beast, and said, “I might be able to turn you back to
normal, but it won’t work 100%. There is only a 20% to 30% chance
you will regain your human form. If this process fails, I do not
know what will happen. Do you still fancy giving it a go?” Zhao
Ning’er could not speak. She made a bird sound and nodded at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“OK, then. Let’s give it a try.” Han Sen did not want to save
Zhao Ning’er because of Zhao Qiu Yi’s repeated begging. He wanted
to know what a Break World beast was and learn if his power could
affect a Break World beast or not.</p>
<p>Han Sen gathered up a Xuan Yellow Sutra power. The Xuan Yellow
Sutra power could turn a gene race back to an egg.</p>
<p>He wondered what would happen if that power hit a Break World
beast. This was his chance to find out.</p>
<p>“Can this power turn Zhao Ning’er back into a human, or will it
turn her into an egg like a gene race? It might not even work at
all.” Han Sen had all these questions run through his mind as he
punched Zhao Ning’er.</p>
