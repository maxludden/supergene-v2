<p>“Han Sen!” Yun Sushang said suddenly.</p>
<p>“Han Sen? What do you mean? Is this connected to Han Sen?”
Thousand Feather Crane looked at Yun Sushang with confusion.</p>
<p>“Did you forget? Han Sen was the first in the exam, and through
it, he received Under the Sky.” Yun Sushang looked strange as she
spoke.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to know what he selected? Only he made the
decision, and I didn’t ask him.” Thousand Feather Crane looked at
Yun Sushang. “How do you know that he selected Under the Sky?”</p>
<p>Yun Sushang gave a wry smile and told him the situation between
Han Sen and Yun Suyi.</p>
<p>When she finished the story, Thousand Feather Crane’s eyes were
wide. “You mean, Han Sen chose Under the Sky because of Yun Suyi?
And he fixed Under the Sky’s flaw in such a short amount of time?
And on top of that, he taught her the corrected version of Under
the Sky? Is such a thing even possible?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t believe it, either. But you can see what she’s
doing, plain as day. There are no flaws in her execution. I can’t
think of another likelihood.” Yun Sushang’s expression looked
disturbed.</p>
<p>“If this is true, then that means Han Sen has performed a great
service for Sky Palace. He has fixed an ancient problem. This guy
is a genius, no doubt. He will be an incredibly important person in
the future.” Thousand Feather Crane complimented him.</p>
<p>“It is hard to say that now. Yun Suyi’s opponent is just Angia,
remember. When she faces a stronger opponent, we will have to see
if there are still flaws in Han Sen’s modifications.” Yun Sushang
retreated into thought for a moment, before going on to say, “When
this ends, we will take Yun Suyi with us to report to father. He
should be able to find out the truth of this.”</p>
<p>As they had their discussion, Angia was in the midst of a
difficult situation.</p>
<p>Angia was far stronger than Yun Suyi. If Yun Suyi’s power was
equivalent to an average human, then Angia was a big and scary
shark. His power could kill Yun Suyi with ease.</p>
<p>But currently, Angia was a shark that had been caught on a hook.
Yun Suyi would add some slack to the cord whenever he struggled, so
he couldn’t use strength to get away.</p>
<p>However, whenever he relaxed a little, the wire would tighten.
Angia could not exercise any of his strengths. The hook continued
to sink deeper into him, and he was getting tangled up even further
by Under the Sky.</p>
<p>“I have lost. Sister Yun is very strong. This must be the Yun
family’s technique that is called Under the Sky. It is fairly
amazing. It is one of the best knifeskills in the world, for sure.”
Angia was smart. He knew he was going to lose, so if he kept
fighting for the sake of it, it’d only be a matter of time before
things took an ugly turn for him. As a result, he chose to concede
and save face.</p>
<p>But he carefully pointed out where Under the Sky came from, and
he only admitted that he lost to Under the Sky. He did not make a
single mention of the fact that it was a skill she had learned from
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Many of the students had never before seen Under the Sky in
action. They only noticed that’s what it was now, after Angia
spoke.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi returned her Ice Knife to its scabbard and said darkly,
“Under the Sky has always had a big flaw that rendered it unusable
in combat. The Under the Sky I used was a variant that was modified
by Han Sen. It corrects the problems of the original. I have not
learned it well, and if I was to estimate, I am at around ten
percent of Han Sen’s proficiency with it.”</p>
<p>After hearing that, all the students of Sky Palace were in
shock. So many people had wished to modify Under the Sky, but no
one had been able to solve the issues plaguing it. It was difficult
to believe Han Sen had sorted it out.</p>
<p>Angia’s face, in the meantime, was turning green and white. Even
a smart guy like him couldn’t think of anything else to</p>
<p>“Can I take the Blood Feather Knife now?” Yun Suyi said, looking
right at Angia.</p>
<p>She was angry that Angia had mocked Han Sen, so she wasn’t going
to be polite.</p>
<p>“Of course. Sister Yun’s knifeskill is strong, and so the knife
is yours.” Angia forced a smile and passed the box to Yun Suyi.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Yun Suyi put away the Blood Feather Knife and left the
arena.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane got up to meet her, and
Yun Sushang asked, “Suyi, is what you said true? Under the Sky’s
flaws have been fixed?”</p>
<p>“Of course it is true.” Yun Suyi nodded.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We are going to have to see our father.” Yun Sushang
pulled Yun Suyi away, and they left Cloud Island. The news that
Under the Sky had been fixed was far too important. She couldn’t
wait around for the event to end before going back.</p>
<p>And furthermore, Yun Suyi had received the Blood Feather Knife,
so the event would soon be over anyway.</p>
<p>The other students started to leave, too. They also wished to
know if Under the Sky had truly been fixed. If that was true, then
Sky Palace had another exclusive knifeskill.</p>
<p>Angia and the other Feathers all looked depressed. No one wished
to say a word.</p>
<p>They wanted to use Han Sen to get famous, but instead, Angia had
been beaten by Han Sen’s student. They were all so upset. It was
far worse than losing to Han Sen directly.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t gain any fame from this, and they couldn’t give
the knife to the third elder as planned. And the biggest problem
was that Yun Suyi had taken the knife without being the slightest
bit impressed. This failure had certainly led to a loss of
reputation.</p>
<p>Despite being unable to beat Yun Suyi, who had learned directly
from Han Sen, Angia had provoked Han Sen multiple times. It’d sound
fairly ridiculous.</p>
<p>He had completely lost, and it filled the Feathers with
frustration. There was nothing they could to discharge their anger,
either. All they could do was swallow it.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe Han Sen concocted a plan like that. I
underestimated him. It looks like that man is not just a fighter,”
Angia said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>He thought Han Sen had planned to use Yun Suyi to fight him all
along, but he was thinking too much, of course. Han Sen had never
spared a thought about how he might deal with Angia.</p>
<p>It was still not over yet, though. Yun Sushang brought Yun Suyi
to meet with Yun Changkong. They told him about Han Sen and Under
the Sky.</p>
<p>“Really? Suyi, show me Han Sen’s modified version.” Yun
Changkong did not believe Han Sen had what it took to fix the
skill. He believed there had to be some sort of problem
remaining.</p>
<p>After all, so many elites had tried and failed to fix it. Han
Sen couldn’t just fix it within a month, even if he was a genius.
But when Yun Changkong witnessed Yun Suyi’s performance, his mouth
dropped wide open.</p>
