  "I don't understand why you're lingering in First God's Sanctuary," said Huangfu Pingqing with a sigh after Son of Heaven left.

"I need to stay for lots of reasons," said Han Sen calmly.

"You must be maxing out on your sacred geno points? Come to Second God's Sanctuary. Everything begins there." Huangfu Pingqing tried to persuade him.

"I still need a lot more sacred geno points. It will probably still take me at least two years," said Han Sen with a smile.

Huangfu Pingqing stared at Han Sen for a moment and said with disappointment, "Believe it or not, I never meant you any harm. Come to Second God's Sanctuary so that you can be truly strong."

"I believe you," Han Sen said, blinking.

Huangfu Pingqing rolled her eyes at him and said, "Do not linger upon any romantic relationships. It would not serve you well. You know what my cousin said about you? He said if you evolve too late, you would not even be worthy of being his enemy, let alone friend."

Huangfu Pingqing thought the reason why Han Sen would not leave First God's Sanctuary was because he had feelings for Wang Mengmeng, which surprisingly annoyed her.

Watching Huangfu Pingqing leave, Han Sen said to himself with a faint smile, "Unworthy of being his enemy? Son of Heaven is so full of shit. I hope he well have the same confidence to say that after I go to Second God's Sanctuary."

Han Sen paid no mind to what Son of Heaven and Huangfu Pingqing had said and continued to eat and drink.

"Brother, this is my last birthday in military school. I don't know if I will have another opportunity to invite you to my birthday party, so…" Wang Mengmeng Said apologetically when she eventually had time to come to Han Sen.

"Whenever you ask me to come, I will come. The next time, you have to remind me it is your birthday, so that I could buy a present for you. You know, I don't have the best memory in the world," said Han Sen with a smile.

"The best present is your presence," Wang Mengmeng said, blushing a little.

"That is very sweet. But I have to give you a gift." Han Sen pondered, wrote something on a napkin and gave it to Wang Mengmeng. He said, "Consider this your birthday present. Sister, happy birthday!"

"Thank you!" Wang Mengmeng started to read the napkin cheerfully.

Both Son of Heaven and Huangfu Pingqing noticed what was happening and wondered what Han Sen had written.

It said: Wang Mengmeng could use this coupon to make one of her wishes come true—Han Sen.

Son of Heaven curled his lips with contempt and left. In his view, it was a cliché to chase after a girl. If it was any other occasion, it might be okay. However, in Wang Mengmeng's birthday party, the fact that this was all Han Sen had to offer showed how incompetent Han Sen was.

Wang Mengmeng was the princess of the Wangs. She could basically have anything in the world, and how could an unevolved person ever fulfill her wish? Han Sen was simply unable to give Wang Mengmeng a satisfactory gift.

"Brother, can I ask for anything?" Wang Mengmeng asked expectantly.

"Anything I can do," Han Sen smiled and said.

"Thank you, brother. This is the best present I have received today." Wang Mengmeng put away the coupon carefully. It seemed she did not plan to use it right away.

After returning to Blackhawk, Han Sen did not go back to the gravity trainer since it was too late. He lay on his bed and browsed the Skynet's using his comlink.

Although he did not care what others said, Han Sen wanted to max out his super geno points and evolve as soon as possible.

There was a lot of information on God's Sanctuary on the Skynet. Han Sen's main focus was the creature activities near Steel Armor Shelter and its neighboring shelters.

It was not easy to fish out useful information on the Skynet. Han Sen had been paying attention to news every day, but did not have much luck.

Suddenly, a post caught Han Sen's attention.

It was posted by someone in Steel Armor Shelter, saying that he had spotted a phoenix in devil Desert.

Since images could not be recorded in God's Sanctuary, the poster with the ID "rainbow man" simply described what the phoenix looked like.

According to his description, the creature was somewhat like the legendary creature. However, all the creatures looking like phoenix were discovered in higher phases. Han Sen had never heard of a phoenix-like creature in First God's Sanctuary.

Many people replied to mock Rainbowman, but Rainbowman insisted that he had seen that creature and described it with more details.

According to Rainbowman, the creature he saw looked like a peacock with golden flames as its flesh and feather.

In addition, Rainbowman said when he spotted the phoenix-like creature, it was resting on a huge tree. When the creature left, Rainbowman went to check the tree and found it was turned into charcoal. There was never any fire, and the tree was still intact. However, the entire tree was carbonized.

Han Sen did not know whether Rainbowman was telling the truth. However, it was a lead and gave him some hope. He replied and asked where Rainbowman had spotted the creature.

Shortly, Rainbowman answered Han Sen and said he was not sure how to describe the location. Indeed, the desert did not have much reference for a clear description. However, Rainbowman said he knew how to find the burnt tree.

Han Sen hesitated and sent Rainbowman a private message, saying he wanted to pay the guy to take him to the tree.

However, Rainbowman did not reply until Han Sen went to bed.

The next morning, Han Sen got up and went to Professor Yan. Last time he brought Jing Jiya with him, whose testing scores interested Professor Yan as Han Sen expected. However, Han Sen was not off the hook and had to check in with Professor Yan once every few days.

Although Han Sen did not want to fake the data, he had to. If his fitness level was published, there must be a ton of troubles, which was the least thing Han Sen needed. All he wanted at this point was to max out on his super geno points.
