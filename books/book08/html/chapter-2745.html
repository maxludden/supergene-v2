<h2>Different Path</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2745</h3>

<p>It was different from Under the Sky. Sit and Forget Sutra was a
completely unique path. Even to Han Sen, who had studied many
different geno arts, this skill was incredibly fresh and amazing.
It was like opening the door to a new world.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer were both stunned and deliriously happy.
They could feel everything Han Sen was learning, and they gained
new insights every time Han Sen understood something.</p>
<p>They were beyond pleased with the incredible capabilities of the
Sit and Forget Sutra. They both practiced the Very High Sense, so
they knew how precious the Sit and Forget Sutra was. At the same
time, they knew how hard it would be to truly learn the Sit and
Forget Sutra.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the Very High who had practiced the
Very High Sense. For them, learning the Sit and Forget Sutra would
be pretty much impossible. Throughout the years, many gifted Very
High would have been incapable of learning this geno art, even if
it was right in front of them.</p>
<p>The alpha had his reasons for not recording the Sit and Forget
Sutra in the historical records of the Very High. If those who had
studied the Very High Sense practiced the Sit and Forget Sutra, the
results would be disastrous for most of them. Unless they had
already surpassed the larva rank and become deified butterflies,
learning the Sit and Forget Sutra might damage them instead of
helping them. So, the alpha didn’t leave his new creation behind.
He drew it on the Ancient Wall, hoping that someday, a Very High
would fulfill the requirements to learn it.</p>
<p>Although the Sit and Forget Sutra was derived from the Very High
Sense, it was far more extreme than its geno art progenitor. Unless
someone could completely understand the Sit and Forget Sutra, the
two geno arts would immediately fall into a devastating
conflict.</p>
<p>The Very High Forget Love still lent the word “Forget” into the
Sit and Forget Sutra. That made this geno art very special.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the Very High Sense was achieving Sky and
Man Combined Together. All practitioners of the Very High Sense
wanted to combine their universes into one, so they could achieve
an understanding of everything between the sky and the ground. They
wanted to control and rule the entire universe.</p>
<p>But the Sit and Forget Sutra was completely different from this.
Its practitioners sought to forget things and themselves. They had
to let go of the universe, the sky, and the ground around them.
Once they had completely abandoned the things that they once held
onto, they could reach an existence that was free of all
constraints.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen had only learned the method for practicing this
new geno art, he wasn’t sure yet what would happen when he used the
skill. In truth, Han Sen and the two women didn’t know exactly what
benefits the Sit and Forget Sutra would offer them.</p>
<p>But one thing Exquisite knew for sure was that if she had
learned the geno art herself instead of receiving Han Sen’s
knowledge second-hand, the Sit and Forget Sutra and the Very High
Sense would have conflicted. She would have been destroyed as the
two geno arts went to war within her.</p>
<p>Learning the Sit and Forget Sutra from one end to the other was
the only way to find out that the Sit and Forget Sutra was the Very
High Sense in reverse. When they were pushed to the max, the two
geno arts became essentially the same.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer continued to learn, and the more they
learned, the more they were shocked by what the alpha had achieved.
If they hadn’t practiced the Very High Sense, they would have been
as high as kites. So high, it couldn’t be described. No one else
could have made this geno art that was called Sit and Forget
Sutra.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the final picture. And after he did, he felt
as if his entire body had leveled up. Everything in the universe
now looked different in his eyes.</p>
<p>Nice things, evil things, love, hatred. Everything suddenly lost
all of its importance. Everything seemed so still and calm that it
couldn’t be described.</p>
<p>He had never known the true face of Lu Mountain, and fate only
resided on that mountain. Humans were always trapped in the throes
of love and hatred. It was because they were part of the game. They
couldn’t escape from it.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen was feeling a bit different about things. It was
like he had disconnected himself from the game. It was like he was
a human looking at a bunch of ants scurrying about far beneath him.
And in between those ants, there was love and there was hatred.
There was life. There was death. There were goodbyes. To Han Sen,
they were just small and insignificant things.</p>
<p>If Han Sen’s Under the Sky mind made him look like a chess
piece, then the one he had gained from the Sit and Forget Sutra
made him the person who was playing the game of chess. He had
jumped off the chessboard. He was now looking down on the fate of
all.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like one of them was right and one of them was wrong.
It was just that his perspective had been altered. Han Sen’s Under
the Sky mind was about being a part of the world. The Sit and
Forget Sutra was looking down at the world from a higher plane. It
was only the path that was different.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen’s level was so much lower than the alpha’s
had been. The alpha had reached the end of his trail, but Han Sen
had only started his a short while ago.</p>
<p>There was no right road, and neither was there a wrong road. But
there was a difference between people. Han Sen wanted to reach the
same level as the alpha, but he knew he had a while to go before he
could reach such heights.</p>
<p>But the alpha’s mind and the Sit and Forget Sutra gave Han Sen a
chance to look through the other man’s eyes for a bit. It was hard
to guess how much of a benefit this would give him.</p>
<p>“After countless eons, the Sit and Forget Sutra has finally been
returned to the Very High. Han Sen, you are the one who did this.
And I assure you, you will be handsomely rewarded.” When Han Sen
looked back, he saw an old man of the Very High. The lanky, bony
old man stood in front of Han Sen, looking so happy as he
spoke.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer saw the pair standing there, and they were
frozen. They quickly turned to Han Sen and said, “Hurry up and
thank the Ninth Uncle.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, elder.” Han Sen bowed. He didn’t think that the
elder’s praise was something to be happy about. At that moment, he
didn’t have any particular feelings about anything in the
world.</p>
<p>The Ninth Uncle wasn’t concerned about Han Sen’s attitude. The
Very High that practiced the Very High Sense cared little for
manners in their world. The Ninth Uncle was a butterfly elite, so
he wasn’t bothered by such petty concerns.</p>
<p>The rebirth of the Sit and Forget Sutra shocked the whole of the
Very High. Many Very High studied the Sit and Forget Sutra. Li Keer
and Exquisite taught it to any who wanted to learn, but most
students were disappointed in the results of their studies. The Sit
and Forget Sutra’s conflict with the Very High Sense was too much.
Unless their minds reached an alpha level, they couldn’t practice
the two geno arts together.</p>
<p>The alpha called himself the highest Very High beneath the
leader. When he had been alive, he had looked through the whole of
the Very High race and failed to find one person with a mind that
was the same as his. So, no one dared to practice the Sit and
Forget Sutra.</p>
<p>When they failed to learn from Li Keer and Exquisite, a few of
the Very High tried to replicate Han Sen’s method by studying the
feelings of the Ancient Wall. However, when they peered into the
Very High eye mark, they couldn’t trigger the mind inside.</p>
<p>Aside from Han Sen, Exquisite, and Li Keer, no one in the Very
High could effectively practice the Sit and Forget Sutra. That made
many of the Very High feel sad.</p>
<p>But Exquisite and Li Keer could practice the Sit and Forget
Sutra, at least, and that was very good for the Very High on the
whole. They were happy.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen was the one who had brought the Sit and Forget
Sutra back to the Very High, he was given many rewards.</p>
<p>When Han Sen received his rewards, he was upset. He thought he
would at least be given some deified xenogeneic genes, or perhaps
some sort of treasure. If he was given a true god item, that would
have been great.</p>
<p>But instead, the Very High gave him a pass that allowed him to
go to the Very High Court.</p>
<p>The Very High Court was a treasury that the Very High used to
store their geno arts. When Han Sen received the spell, he gained
the privileges of a Very High. He had the authority to enter the
Very High Court, and he could practice all sorts of geno arts
there. But to Han Sen, this reward was worse than geno treasures
and xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer sneered when they noticed Han Sen’s
thoughts. He had gotten very lucky, but he didn’t seem to
acknowledge it.</p>
