<p>Heart Connection was a skill that concentrated all of the power
inside one’s body into a single precise point. That power would all
be spent in a single use, and it would take a long time to
recover.</p>
<p>Han Sen had used Heart Connection because he had a way to
recover in a short period of time, if necessary. He wouldn’t have
to wait too long before he could fight again.</p>
<p>However, if Shale was willing to wait for him, then Han Sen
wouldn’t have to use his method of accelerated recovery.</p>
<p>Up until that moment, the three half-deifieds who escaped hadn’t
realized that Han Sen’s power had been exhausted. They regretted
how quickly they had been to flee. They should have immediately
attacked Han Sen again.</p>
<p>The Very High masters of the three half-deified silkworms shook
their heads in dismay.</p>
<p>The Very High selected a silkworm based on three things: talent,
power, and personality. Their personality was difficult to fully
judge, however. The truth of a person’s character was only revealed
during real life and death moments. If the silkworm’s personality
was shown to be poor or weak during the silkworm bouts, there was
every chance that their Very High master might cast them away. That
was the purpose of this battle royale.</p>
<p>Although Gru had lost, the Very High who had signed a contract
with him was happy with his personality. Gru wasn’t going to be
cast out. But the mantis-man and the other three were probably
going to be discarded.</p>
<p>Of course, that was just how things looked at the moment. If the
silkworms worked hard and showed that they really were resilient
and determined people, there was a slim chance of them earning
their masters’ love back. Only the dead mantis-man had no chance of
that.</p>
<p>With Shale sitting nearby, no other silkworm would get close to
Han Sen. He continued casting The Story of Genes to recover his
power. He didn’t do anything else.</p>
<p>The Fox woman approached Shale and glanced at Han Sen, who was
focusing on his geno arts. “Shale, why aren’t you doing
anything?”</p>
<p>“I came to Outer Sky to practice, not to kill,” Shale said
expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten that you’re no longer deified? With the
power he just demonstrated, if you allow him to recover, you might
not win. Are you really willing to risk giving up the Apollo Set?”
the woman said with a blink.</p>
<p>Shale didn’t respond, which prompted the woman to continue. “If
you don’t want to do it, then I will.”</p>
<p>After that, the woman walked up to Han Sen. A strange light
began to glow around her fingers.</p>
<p>“I told him I would protect him for ten hours. If you get any
closer, I will consider you an enemy,” Shale said.</p>
<p>“You will regret this. This universe only progresses by the
strong feeding on the weak. It is survival of the fittest. If you
continue to act like this, you won’t be strong enough to lift the
rest of your race,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Maybe.” Shale didn’t bother arguing.</p>
<p>Seeing that Shale had no intention of arguing with her further,
the woman rolled her eyes and laughed. “Shale, Shale, Shale. You
ate the Demon Fruit and fell from your deified rank. You might not
beat Han Sen, but you still sound so proud. I’m afraid that in this
universe, not many people can be as proud as you.”</p>
<p>Her words could have been either insult or praise, but one thing
was clear; she had pitched her voice loud enough for those watching
the contest to hear.</p>
<p>Many of the Very High hadn’t known that Shale had eaten a Demon
Fruit. They were shocked to hear this.</p>
<p>“Shale ate Demon Fruit?” Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng looked
ill.</p>
<p>The deified Shale was previously considered the strongest
fighter taking part in the silkworm bouts, but if he had eaten a
Demon Fruit and his rank had fallen, there was the very real chance
of him not winning.</p>
<p>“No wonder Open Sky Elder was willing to wager his Open Sky
jewelry. He must have known that Shale ate the Demon Fruit and
received a downgrade,” Li Xue Cheng gnashed his teeth. He pointed
at Shale and screamed, “You idiot! You dropped down to
half-deified, and yet you are still behaving this proudly? Kill him
while he is weak.”</p>
<p>Right now, Li Xue Cheng wanted to grab Shale’s hand and use it
to strike Han Sen down.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen’s face turned green, but then it turned white.
Clearly, there were a lot of sour emotions running through his
heart at that moment.</p>
<p>They almost coughed up blood because of how Shale was behaving.
Exquisite and Li Keer, on the other hand, were delighted. Shale
wasn’t deified anymore, and that increased Han Sen’s chances of
winning. Therefore, things suddenly didn’t seem as hopeless
anymore.</p>
<p>The audience might have been surprised by the news of Shale’s
fallen rank, but for the silkworms in the valley, the revelation
breathed new life into this contest.</p>
<p>In the foothills of the valley, a Very High man squinted. “Shale
ate a Demon Fruit and became half-deified? I thought there was no
hope of reaching first place. I guess now there is.”</p>
<p>In a heartbeat, the Very High man had teleported away and
appeared on the other side of the valley. He popped into existence
next to the three half-deified silkworms that had just been
fighting Han Sen earlier.</p>
<p>“Mo Fang…” When the three of them saw the Very High man, they
were given a shock. Alarmed, they gathered up all their power.</p>
<p>Out of the twelve silkworms, aside from Shale and Han Sen, Mo
Fang could be regarded as the most famous. In fact, some silkworms
were more afraid of Mo Fang than they were of Han Sen and
Shale.</p>
<p>Although Mo Fang was only half-deified, he was one of the Very
High. That fact alone made him unlike any other silkworm.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, guys. I am here to cooperate with you three. I
intend to bring you no harm,” Mo Fang said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Cooperate? You mean against Shale?” one of the Extreme King
asked Mo Fang.</p>
<p>Mo Fang hadn’t joined them until after the woman mentioned that
Shale’s rank had fallen. They could easily guess what he was going
to do.</p>
<p>“Not bad. If Shale was still deified, I would have stood no
chance. But now that he is just half-deified, why don’t we
cooperate and kick him out of the match? Then, we can finish off
the weakened Han Sen,” Mo Fang said.</p>
<p>“Fighting Shale won’t allow us to reach first place in the
fight, though. You will be the one reaping the benefits. Where does
that leave us? Why would we risk our necks for you?” the Aichi
archer asked skeptically.</p>
<p>“Forgive me for speaking so bluntly, but with the power you guys
have, you will likely be the weakest of everyone in this valley.
Aside from the one who quit the match, you three will be fighting
for last place. If you guys are willing to help me, once we are
done, we can continue cooperating. We can knock the other silkworms
out of the valley, so I can become first and you three can occupy
the second, third, and fourth places,” Mo Fang said.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Pleased grins spread across the faces of the
three half-deifieds. They had been cooperating from the beginning
because they already knew their powers were weak.</p>
<p>“Since when would one of the Very High not live up to their
word?” Mo Fang said proudly.</p>
<p>Two of the Extreme King half-deifieds looked at each other, then
one of them turned back to Mo Fang.</p>
<p>“Okay, we’re in.”</p>
<p>If another silkworm had come there asking that they work
together, they would have hesitated. However, Mo Fang was
well-known. Although he was a silkworm, he was one of the Very
High. And being on Very High land, cooperating with him would be
the safest thing to do.</p>
