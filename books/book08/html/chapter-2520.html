<p>“Deified Xenogeneic hunted: Gold Robot General. Xenogeneic gene
found. Obtained Gold Robot General beast soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was thrilled. “I got its beast soul. Am I on a lucky
streak to keep receiving their beast souls these days?”</p>
<p>When the Gold Robot General fell, its gold greatsword dropped
from its loosened grip, too. Dragon One and the others were all
ecstatic. After seeing this, they all ran up to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Bai Wan Jie watched Han Sen from afar, with his face cycling
through a variety of different emotions. The members of his royal
knights were all frozen, and none of them could speak.</p>
<p>The results of the battle were far too surprising. The Gold
Armor General was considered too difficult to kill, and yet Dollar
had single-handedly secured the victory. Watching Han Sen at that
moment was like looking at a god and a demon. It left a really deep
impression in their brains.</p>
<p>“What just happened?”</p>
<p>“That Dollar just soloed the Gold Armor General. Am I seeing
this correctly?”</p>
<p>“It was too f*cking scary. Dollar is too powerful. He just
soloed a deified as a King. Can any of the Extreme King do such a
thing?”</p>
<p>“Even someone else could do this, there’s no way they could do
it as casually as Dollar did. He must be a deified pretending to be
a King.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After the King class audience watched the fight, they were all
left looking shocked.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman looked at Han Sen. Her pretty eyes had
become unreadable as she spoke to herself. “What is up with this
Dollar character? What is his power? Interesting. How interesting.
Is he stronger than Yu Shanxin?”</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, we couldn’t have done this without you…” Dragon
One was so shocked and happy, he wasn’t quite sure what to say. If
not for Dollar, the Dragons would surely have lost everything.
Dollar had managed to pull them out of the fire and secure victory
for them all by himself.</p>
<p>At that moment, Dragon One was only thinking that the one
thousand xenogeneic genes he owed were well worth it.</p>
<p>“When can you pay me the second batch of five hundred xenogeneic
genes?” Han Sen asked, looking at Dragon One. After fulfilling the
work he was tasked to perform, he required his payment.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow… No, give us half an hour. We will deliver them right
away!” Dragon One had come to kill a deified xenogeneic. He
couldn’t have brought them with him. He immediately told his Dragon
subordinates to retrieve the xenogeneic genes that the man was
owed.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, are you interested in striking another deal?”
Dia Robber approached, lowering his voice as he spoke to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “I have things to do. I don’t have
time.”</p>
<p>Dia Robber felt so annoyed. The reason why he let Dragon One ask
Dollar first was that he himself wasn’t confident in Dollar’s
abilities. He wanted to see how strong Dollar was before deciding
to hire him.</p>
<p>But God knew Dollar was insanely strong. After all, he had
practically killed the Gold Armor General all alone. Now that Dia
Robber wanted to hire him and was unsure if he could, he was really
regretting his previous hesitation.</p>
<p>“If you have the time, Brother Dollar, we can discuss payment,”
Dia Robber said hopefully, praying he would still have a chance to
hire Dollar.</p>
<p>“Sure. I will contact you sometime down the line,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen handed the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger back to Dragon
One. The Dragons quickly brought the other five hundred xenogeneic
genes over. Han Sen took the xenogeneic genes back to the core area
hall. Then, he placed them all inside Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>“With one thousand xenogeneic genes, I can max out one King
area, at least.” Han Sen observed the mountain of King xenogeneic
genes he had piled inside his Destiny’s Tower. It gave him a warm
and comforting feeling. He sighed and said, “It is nice to always
have a little in the bank.”</p>
<p>Seeing so many xenogeneic genes all in one place was enough to
make Han Sen start drooling. Then, he suddenly heard Wan’er make
some moaning sounds on a lower floor. When he went to see her, he
saw her eyelids flicker. It looked as if she was going to wake
up.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He went back to the white whale and brought
Wan’er out of Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>Earlier, Han Sen had used his super god spirit to kill the Gold
Robot General. He felt that Wan’er’s effect on him was weaker now.
Her power was no longer canceling his super god spirit straight
away. Han Sen thought that was weird.</p>
<p>Originally, he only wanted to use his super god spirit body to
blind the Gold Robot General’s eyes. He hadn’t known it would last
so long and enable him to do as much as he had.</p>
<p>Now, it seemed as if Wan’er waking up was in some way related to
what had happened.</p>
<p>Wan’er lay on the bed as her eyes slowly opened. When she saw
that Han Sen was there, she suddenly jumped forward. She wrapped
her arms around his neck and curled against his chest like a cat.
She closed her eyes and gleefully said, “Big Brother.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what to do, and he pushed her back a bit. He
had yet to learn why Wan’er was so insistent about calling him “big
brother.” He thought that having her as a sister was something he
would probably remember.</p>
<p>“Ahem, ahem. Wan’er, do you remember your big brother?” As he
said that, even Han Sen thought his choice of words was a bit
strange.</p>
<p>“Of course I recognize my big brother.” Wan’er leaned toward Han
Sen. She closed her eyes as if she was dreaming and said, “I don’t
ever want to be apart from you. I want to be with my big brother
forever.”</p>
<p>“Good Wan’er. Your big brother wants to be with you forever,
too.” Han Sen patted Wan’er on the back like she was a child. And
then he asked, “Do you remember my name?”</p>
<p>“Of course I remember. How could I forget my big brother’s name?
I would never forget my big brother’s name.” Wan’er rubbed her face
against Han Sen’s chest in another feline motion.</p>
<p>“Then, what is my name?” Han Sen asked in a rush.</p>
<p>Wan’er raised her head. She looked at Han Sen with confusion and
said, “Has big brother forgotten his name?”</p>
<p>“Of course I remember my name! I’m testing you.” Han Sen felt as
if he was some kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Han Sen say this, Wan’er’s face started to become
red. It was so pretty, and she was looked like a piece of crystal
that was about to cry. “Big brother doesn’t believe me?”</p>
<p>“Of course I believe you, Wan’er! I am just kidding with you.”
Han Sen felt his resolve soften, and so he opted to try and comfort
her.</p>
<p>Wan’er laughed. She placed her cheek against Han Sen’s chest,
closed her eyes, and said, “I want to be with you like I was
before. I want to just chat and travel with you all around the
universe. But Wan’er feels so tired. I want to sleep a lot.”</p>
<p>Han Sen really wanted to know the name of Wan’er’s big brother,
but he didn’t know how to ask. He was in a rush about it, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if dealing with Wan’er might be harder than
dealing with a deified xenogeneic. Dealing with a deified
xenogeneic might at least give him a chance, but facing Wan’er, he
couldn’t even use his full strength. It would be like punching
cotton.</p>
<p>“Big brother… can we not go back to Sacred? Just the two of us
together, forever… Together, forever,” Wan’er mumbled dreamily, and
her voice became quieter and quieter.</p>
<p>Han Sen froze. “Is she really from Sacred? If she is, then who
is her big brother? Is it someone else from Sacred?”</p>
