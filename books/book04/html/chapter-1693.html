    <p>
      Han Sen put the item in his hand. It was around ten centimeters long, and
      it looked like a bone. But it didn’t feel like a bone; it actually felt
      heavier than metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obscured in a lot of blood, so it was hard to discern its original
      appearance. He wiped it all away to reveal its true form.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was part of a small bone, but it was red and a little purplish. It was
      different from the Feather’s other bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen kept looking around the dead body. Aside from that little bone,
      the rest were white and of the correct weight. They were a little heavier
      than a human’s, but not like the way the purple one was. That was way
      heavier.
    </p>
    <p>“What is this?” Han Sen asked Old Cat, holding out the bone.</p>
    <p>
      The cat looked bored, like he could not even muster the energy to answer.
      “A bone? What else could it be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat didn’t answer him straight, so Han Sen didn’t bother asking him
      again. If the cat wasn’t going to tell him anything, it was pointless
      trying to get answers from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen investigated the bone himself, but he found nothing truly special
      about it. Or at least, he couldn’t at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, he put the bone away and turned to ask the Old Cat, “Old Cat, do you
      know how I can get back to the Alliance?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not want to be there for long. God’s Organization might have
      found his home, he would need to return as soon as he could. There was no
      time to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Find a teleporter in a shelter. You can get back that way,” Old Cat said
      casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I teleport, where will I end up?” Han Sen asked. The teleporter of a
      shelter would send a person back to the point they entered from. But the
      Nine-Life Cat tattoo had pulled him in from nowhere specific. He hadn’t
      used a teleporter, and thus, he didn’t know what would happen to him if he
      used one now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat sighed and said, “It’s hard to tell. You might end up somewhere
      random.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing Old Cat say this, Han Sen’s face fell. Teleporting randomly was
      bad. If he ended up somewhere far from Planet Roca, he couldn’t make it
      home in any short jiffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen asked how he could leave the ruins he was currently in and if
      there were any shelters nearby the cat was aware of. Then, he left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat didn’t want to leave yet, though. He still wanted to unearth more
      items.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen had to go and so he left the ruins via the directions given to
      him by Old Cat. He proceeded to the nearest shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had been in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary for a long time, but he was
      in an area he had never ventured to before. He had only heard Old Cat tell
      him that there was a shelter around. Old Cat had never been there, though,
      and it had been taken over by creatures. To Han Sen, that sounded like a
      super shelter.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen used his Death Armor Swordsman on his way there.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s fitness was ten thousand. Using the super shapeshifting beast
      soul would burden his body. Before, Han Sen wouldn’t have been able to use
      it for very long. But his body had changed after the ascension, and
      shapeshift beast souls did not tax him like they used to.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Black Sky Demon Shelter was around that mountain someplace. Xie Qing King
      frowned and leaned forward. He saw a humanoid creature with black horns.
      “Black God, why are you blocking my way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Xie Qing, I’ve heard you have been cocky.” Black God looked at Xie Qing
      King and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>“That is none of your business,” Xie Qing King said coldly.</p>
    <p>
      Black God laughed and said, “It isn’t any of my business, but you have
      been cocky around my Black Sky Demon Shelter. I will give you a decision
      to make. The first is that you die. The second…”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he finished speaking, Xie Qing King’s body flashed with a silver
      light. He threw a punch towards the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black God was so mad, and the demonic aura he had blasted towards and
      against Xie Qing King’s fist.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The silver light and the demonic force collided, creating an explosion.
      Xie Qing King did not move, but Black God was knocked back ten meters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is no wonder you have such a reputation. You are cocky,” Black God
      said darkly. Then he went on to say, “Since I am here, you can still
      choose to obey me. The choice is yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      With Black God’s booming voice, the entire mountain was shrouded with a
      menacing presence. It became tangible, as many forces started to surround
      Xie Qing King.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In my eyes, there is only one word. And that is: fight.” Xie Qing King’s
      eyes were on fire, and the silver light erupted like a volcano.
    </p>
    <p>His entire body became silver as he ran towards Black God.</p>
    <p>
      Black God grunted. The demonic aura summoned a black geno core sword into
      his hands. He immediately slashed towards Xie Qing King with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demonic force came out like a rippling flash in the air. It looked as
      if it was going to sunder the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xie Qing King clenched his fists and went against the demonic force. Then,
      a silver glove appeared upon his fist
    </p>
    <p>
      They collided in mid-air. The silver light, however, was indestructible.
      The demonic force was easily broken, and the silver glove came down on the
      sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      A katcha noise sounded as the sword snapped easily. Black God was sent
      flying into a nearby mountain, breaking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Kill him!” Black God staggered back from the mountainside, shouting. His
      face was drenched with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six scary presences surrounded Xie Qing King. They were all as strong as
      Black God, and they all started to attack at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silver light was so bright on Xie Qing King’s fist, and the super
      creatures did not dare face it directly. The color of the sky changed, and
      it looked like the end of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black God looked ill. He had brought six super creatures to attack Xie
      Qing King, and while they managed to hurt him, he had managed to hurt them
      back. The seven of them were injured, with one being severely wounded.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Xie Qing King hit Black God and crushed his armor. Black God’s chest caved
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to finish him off, a scary power appeared. Xie Qing
      King heard a cold voice.
    </p>
    <p>“Hurt one of my blood and you are dead!”</p>
