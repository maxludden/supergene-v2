	<p>&#8220;Thank you for the chance.&#8221; Han Sen smiled and threw a punch at the young man.</p>

	<p>The young man looked at Han Sen&#8217;s fist, curled his lips, smiled contemptuously, and countered Han
		Sen&#8217;s strike with his fist.</p>

	<p>With his fitness level as an evolver, he was much stronger than a normal unevolved person. He could bully his
		opponents as he wanted using his advantage in fitness, the satisfaction of which made him linger in the
		unevolved section.</p>

	<p>As long as they did not use those hyper geno arts that only evolvers could practice, there was no way for anyone
		to tell they were evolvers. People would only think that they were strong unevolved persons.</p>

	<p>Seeing the two fists were about to clash, the young man was even more excited. Fist against fist, he could break
		all the bones in his opponent&#8217;s fingers, and sometimes even the entire arm.</p>

	<p>As the two fists were about to bump, Han Sen turned his fist into a claw, twisted the young man&#8217;s wrist,
		and dislocated it. The young man&#8217;s arm was twisted back and had to turn his back to Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Twisting his arm, Han Sen kicked the young man in the knee pits and made him kneel. With one arm controlled by
		Han Sen, the young man could not even stand up, otherwise his entire arm would be wasted.</p>

	<p>As an evolver, the young man did have some remarkable abilities. He quickly hit back and tried to get rid of Han
		Sen&#8217;s hand.</p>

	<p>However, Han Sen had improved his grappling skills tremendously since his combat with Xu Zhu. An evolver with a
		fitness index just above 20 was not comparable to Han Sen at all.</p>

	<p>Han Sen released the young man&#8217;s arm and followed the young man. Putting his arm around the young
		man&#8217;s neck, Han Sen threw his opponent in the air head down.</p>

	<p>As his opponent was falling, Han Sen&#8217;s fists hit the young man&#8217;s body as fast as lightning bolts,
		from the face to the stomach. When the young man was about to touch the ground, Han Sen kicked him in the chest
		with a knee, throwing him into the air again.</p>

	<p>Sweeping up and down, Han Sen&#8217;s legs became a blur, kicking the young man as if he were a punching sack.
		Before the young man landed, his health value was burned up. His body exploded in the air, and he was
		eliminated.</p>

	<p>His friend, the tall, slim guy became dumbstruck, unable to believe that the young man would be kicked to the
		point of explosion by a military school student.</p>

	<p>Even though the students did not know that they were evolvers, he knew very well that it was impossible for his
		friend to lose.</p>

	<p>The students started to cheer and welcomed Han Sen back to the stands as if they were receiving a hero.</p>

	<p>Han Sen stared at the tall, slim young man and asked, &#8220;Do you want to fight me as well?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No need… No need…&#8221; The tall and slim guy became pale, he was not even as good as his friend. Since
		his friend exploded, of course he did not have the nerve to fight Han Sen himself.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why? Didn&#8217;t you enjoy this game very much?&#8221; Han Sen said calmly.</p>

	<p>Feeling nervous, the tall and slim guy exclaimed, &#8220;We are out of form today. Doesn&#8217;t mean we
		won&#8217;t win next time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Will you use your evolver&#8217;s identity to fight next time, or the unevolved?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

	<p>Hearing Han Sen&#8217;s words, the students were dazed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Han Sen, you&#8217;re saying that they are evolvers?&#8221; Shi Zhikang looked at the two young men
		incredulously.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are evolvers?&#8221; All the students were mad at them. Bullying others using false identities was
		simply contemptible.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who is an evolver? Don&#8217;t talk crap here…&#8221; The two young men of course chose to deny being
		evolvers, otherwise they would be in trouble.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Indeed, you have not evolved much,&#8221; said Han Sen casually.</p>

	<p>The two did not speak any more and chose to leave Gladiator.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Han Sen, were they evolvers or not?&#8221; The students were puzzled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;When I went to observe in the evolver section, I have seen them before. But I&#8217;m not so sure if they
		are actually evolvers.&#8221; Han Sen shrugged and made up an excuse.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think they are evolvers, but the scum type. Otherwise they would not have pretended to be an unevolved
		person to bully others.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Garbage.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Shameless.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&quot;Genius, your movements were awesome, especially the last round of kicks. You need to teach us when you have
		time. All the students were impressed by Han Sen. Even scum evolvers were evolvers. It was still difficult for
		an unevolved person to beat them.</p>

	<p>After fighting the students a few rounds and giving them some suggestion, Han Sen entered the evolver section,
		because he was not the least interested in the unevolved opponents.</p>

	<p>As soon as possible he did, he received an invite to fight.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought it was those who had lost to him, but was dumbstruck by the ID name.</p>

	<p>The ID looked very familiar, but it was not the two persons that he had beaten before.</p>

	<p>It was a one-word ID: Queen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had never seen such an ID, but he remembered this name.</p>

	<p>A while back, Huangfu Pingqing had taken him to a restaurant named Queen Restaurant once, which was the property
		of Ares Martial Hall. Han Sen saw an evolver with the nickname Queen there in the restaurant, who destroyed an
		evolver opponent momentarily with incredible skills and power.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Is this the same Queen?&#8221; With some doubt, Han Sen clicked yes and entered a fighting scene.</p>
