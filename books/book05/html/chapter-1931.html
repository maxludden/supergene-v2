<h2>The Moon’s Reflection on Water</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1931</h3>

<p>Han Sen’s desire to perform Moon had little to do with
satisfying Kriman.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought learning Moon was a challenge from Yisha, so he
wanted to prove to Yisha that he was a genius. He didn’t want her
suspicions taking root.</p>
<p>Han Sen wouldn’t have dared to perform Moon before today,
though. After all, he wasn’t smart enough to learn something from a
brief look. He had practiced Moon for quite some time, and he knew
that if he had done it prior to seeing Narrow Moon Knife, the
quality of his performance would not have befitted a genius.</p>
<p>Examining Narrow Moon Knife changed this. That was why Han Sen
was now confident to perform Moon there. He was confident he could
quell Yisha’s fears now.</p>
<p>“Moon?” Rebecca and Du Lishe were shocked; it was Moon Wheel
King’s geno art, and they knew it, too. They had learned it from
Moon Wheel King himself when they were young, and it was something
they were still practicing with.</p>
<p>Kriman coldly laughed and said, “You are daring to practice Moon
in front of Rebecca and Du Lishe? That is hardly appropriate.”</p>
<p>Everyone knew Rebecca and Du Lishe were excellent with the art.
They were surprised that Han Sen had expressed his desire to
perform it.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and ignored Kriman. Then he said, “My teacher
taught me Moon. I have been trying to learn it for some time, but
my understanding of it has failed. I suddenly learned it when I
looked at the knife. I don’t know if this is correct, so please
correct me.”</p>
<p>When everyone heard him say this, they all went quiet. Kriman
swallowed the words he was going to speak, and coldly said, “Okay.
Let’s see how Moon correlates with Narrow Moon Knife.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around and stopped his gaze on the teacup. He
filled the cup up with water, then placed it back down on the
table. Rebecca and the others were watching him, keenly wondering
how he was going to do in his performance of Moon.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave them a swift answer. He pointed to the middle of
the teacup and fired an arrow of light at it.</p>
<p>When the light entered the water, there was no impact. It was
like a reflection of the moon, hovering on the surface of the
water.</p>
<p>“What do you guys think of my Moon?” Han Sen lowered his hands
and smiled.</p>
<p>Kriman laughed mockingly and said, “I thought you learned
something amazing from the knife. The reflection of the moon is
something only a beginner might have learned. You are much worse
than Rebecca and Du Lishe.”</p>
<p>“Then can I take a look at the Moon of the two ladies?” Han Sen
looked at Rebecca and Du Lishe with great interest. Rebecca felt
worried. Du Lishe didn’t hesitate, though, and she simply said’
“Why not?”</p>
<p>After that, Du Lishe filled up her teacup with water. Then, she
looked at Han Sen. “This is just a beginner move on Moon. I was
able to do it by the time I became Viscount. I can generate three
moons, so I am worse than my big sister. Please do not laugh at my
Moon if it is bad.”</p>
<p>“Three lunar reflections? That is much better than one!” Sad
Night looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Du Lishe smiled and did not say anything. She used her right
fingers. Three fingers created three moons upon the surface of the
teacup’s contents.</p>
<p>When the moons entered, no ripples were formed. But those three
moons almost filled up the entire teacup. It looked strange.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I did that poorly.” Du Lishe was actually satisfied with
her performance. She was being cocky, and a little provocative to
Han Sen. Her eyebrows were raised slyly.</p>
<p>“Good! These three moon reflections are great. It is no wonder
you are the heir of Moon Wheel King.” Kriman loudly complimented
her.</p>
<p>Sad Night followed his example, too. He wasn’t bluffing, though.
Du Lishe really had performed exceptionally well.</p>
<p>The people there had all learned Moon, but like Han Sen, they
could only cast one moon. They couldn’t do two. Du Lishe was able
to do three because she had learned the skill directly from Moon
Wheel King.</p>
<p>Sad Night looked at Han Sen strangely. “Genius Han, is that what
you learned from the knife? Perhaps it is best not to compare it to
Du Lishe. Even the rest of us, who didn’t learn from Moon Wheel
King or stare at the knife for half an hour, can still do a
reflection like yours. We didn’t need half an hour.”</p>
<p>“Three moon reflections? This is great. I have learned a lot,”
Han Sen said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>Then, he stood up and told Black Steel, “I have something to do.
I will talk to you later.”</p>
<p>Han Sen said that and left. He didn’t want to interact with
those people. He’d rather practice what he had learned while the
memory was still fresh in his mind.</p>
<p>“I will walk you out,” Black Steel said.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. He didn’t have a good relationship with
the other heirs of Kings, and he didn’t want Black Steel to end up
isolated like he was.</p>
<p>“Running off like that? He sucks.” Kriman smiled.</p>
<p>“Of course. Did you expect him to just let you insult him?”
Someone laughed.</p>
<p>“He deserved it. I don’t like people who keep pretending,”
Kriman said darkly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not in their circle, so it did not affect them too
much. Now, they returned to being happier and more friendly with
each other.</p>
<p>Du Lishe felt really good, too. She had finally shown off in
front of Han Sen with success. She was smiling and smiling, and she
just couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>Rebecca didn’t look so happy, though. She felt as if something
was amiss, but she couldn’t put her fingers on exactly what was
wrong.</p>
<p>As everyone talked, a Viscount accidentally knocked over a geno
fluid and dirtied a seat, so he moved to Han Sen’s seat.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s cup was still there. The Viscount reached for the cup,
wanting to swap it for a new one, but when he just touched the
teacup, his face changed and he screamed, “What the f*ck?!”</p>
<p>As everyone was talking merrily, hearing him scream made
everyone turn to look at him. Kriman laughed and said, “What are
you screaming about?”</p>
<p>“Look! Look at this cup.” The Viscount pointed at the cup and
looked at it strangely.</p>
<p>“What about the cup?” Kriman asked.</p>
<p>“This is Han Sen’s cup. Look closer!” The Viscount did not know
how to explain, so he picked it up and moved it over.</p>
