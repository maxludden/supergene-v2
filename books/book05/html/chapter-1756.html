<h2>Falling Into the Black Hole</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1756</h3>

<p>Han Sen felt as if something was wrong. He stayed outside the
door and just watched.</p>
<p>The Noble that used the hammer to break the door swiftly went
towards the metal vine. He grabbed the lotus and the flower.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t think it would actually be that easy to snatch,
but the lotus and the flower were easily pulled down. The giant
didn’t even have to use much strength.</p>
<p>The four-armed Noble looked delighted with what he had
retrieved, and he quickly tried to put the flower and the lotus
items into his mouth.</p>
<p>But before he was able to do so, the flash of a swordlight came
toward him. A Kate Noble attacked, prompting him to fight back the
aggressor with his hammer.</p>
<p>A mess soon unfolded in the cave, as dozens of Nobles began to
fight amongst themselves. Many just watched, biding their time for
the chance to grab something good.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the wolf-head man still near the center of the
crowd. He didn’t try to take the flower or the lotus, however.
Things weren’t that simple, and he knew it. There was no
confirmation that the flower and the lotus were magnet fruits,
after all.</p>
<p>As Han Sen surveyed the scene, he soon heard the sound of
thunder. He couldn’t hear it clearly because of the fight, but it
was certainly no human noise.</p>
<p>“We’re underground. Where could the thunder be coming from?” Han
Sen frowned, and he did his best to listen. The thunder was
definitely coming from someplace in the cave.</p>
<p>The cave behind the door was only half-natural. It connected to
the bottomless hole, and the thunder sounds were coming from
there.</p>
<p>Dozens of Nobles were knee-deep in battle, and even those that
were staying out of the fray were still distracted by the lotus and
flower. They were trying to keep a close eye on the items.
Therefore, no one else noticed the sounds of thunder.</p>
<p>Soon after, however, the thunder got louder. It sounded like
explosions in the sky, and everyone began to pay heed.</p>
<p>As the others started to wonder where the noise was coming from,
though, it stopped. Everyone was shocked, and even the Nobles who
were still fighting had to quit.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a force of suction began to pull on everyone, as if
someone had just switched on a vacuum. The Nobles inside the door,
and the commoners outside, were all sucked away. They began rolling
in the direction of the hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in shock, and he couldn’t stop himself from being
dragged in that direction, either. He grabbed at the rock floor,
but he was still being pulled away, leaving scratchmarks behind in
the stone.</p>
<p>Everyone started to scream, and almost everyone was sucked down
into the gaping pit. The suction made their descent extremely
quick.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the dark, but even so, he was incredibly calm. He
held onto Bao’er as he looked around. The sky was visible high
above, but he did not know how deep the hole was. He was still
falling.</p>
<p>Down below, Han Sen could make out the presence of a purple
light. It looked similar to the purple mist he had seen during the
nighttime. There was smoke around it</p>
<p>Everyone was falling. Some were crying their eyes out, while
others merely watched like Han Sen was. But none of them could stop
their rapid freefall. They were falling into the darkness.</p>
<p>And then, the sky became like a needle. The purple lights down
below became clearer.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed that in the darkness down there, the purple
light was coming from a purple lotus.</p>
<p>The purple lotus was massive. They all felt like ants before the
massive flower.</p>
<p>The purple lotus opened, and the lotus cup was full. It was like
purple jade, and the seed looked like an amethyst in the
middle.</p>
<p>The lights and the very dimension itself were twisted by the
lotus. You could see the distortions from far away.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was drawn toward the lotus flower, he noticed a lot
of metal items on its surface. There were trucks, steel pipes,
beams, and even helicopters and other sorts of aircraft. There were
also road signs, steel pots, steel pans, even steel cutlery. They
had all been dragged down to land on the purple lotus.</p>
<p>Han Sen also saw the bodies of creatures, with most of them
belonging to the Kate people. There were also individuals from
different races Han Sen could not identify. All of them were
sprawled out across the lotus.</p>
<p>The scariest thing was that the metal and the bodies atop the
flower were starting to melt. It was like they were being instantly
decomposed.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>All the creatures landed on the purple lotus. Some hit the
petals, and some fell on the cup itself. But no matter where they
landed, it was like falling onto a luxurious mattress. Their bodies
did not hurt after the fall, either.</p>
<p>Soon after, even if they weren’t hurt, they were still
magnetized to the lotus. Han Sen tried his best to move, but he
could not shift his leg away from the lotus.</p>
<p>The four-armed Noble swung his hammer, trying to break the petal
that bound him in place. Unfortunately, after one strike, the
hammer itself got stuck, and the man was unable to bring it
back.</p>
<p>Everyone there were like bugs caught in a spider web. Not a
single person could move—not even the Nobles.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not try struggling, though, for he knew such an
endeavor would be pointless. He just started to think about how he
might be able to escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen did find out that Bao’er was unaffected by the suction,
however. She lay down on Han Sen’s shoulder, nice and snug. The
suction didn’t pull him at all.</p>
<p>Bao’er curiously examined the environment, interested in the
lotus flower and the lotus seeds.</p>
<p>“Magnet fruit, this is the real magnet fruit!” As Han Sen was
thinking about why Bao’er was able to move freely, someone started
shouting nearby.</p>
<p>One Noble was standing on his feet, holding the lotus seed in
his hands. It looked as if he hadn’t been affected by the</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around, noticing other people that weren’t
affected, either. Most of them were Nobles, but there were a few
commoners in their midst</p>
<p>“Strange. Why aren’t they affected?” Han Sen looked around and
put away his geno armor. He stopped using his geno</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s body now feeling supremely light, the suction
from the flower was all gone. Han Sen had been freed.</p>
