<p>Han Sen was wandering aimlessly on the streets. He looked
forward and saw a Buddha woman in the midst of a crowd. She was
clad in white robes, and her eyebrows were like those of a painting
as she smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Speechless Buddha Lady?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>“Mister Han! If you want, I can guide you around the Buddha
Kingdom.” Speechless Buddha Lady came before Han Sen and spoke to
him.</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>It was impossible to escape from the Buddha in Buddha Kingdom.
Han Sen had nothing better to do, and she was freely offering to
guide him, so he wasn’t going to say no. And that aside, Speechless
was pretty to look at.</p>
<p>Then please follow me. I won’t let you down.” Speechless smiled
at Han Sen and then started walking.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt strange. There were many people in the city, but it
didn’t seem as if anyone recognized Speechless. He wondered why no
one gave him peculiar looks.</p>
<p>Speechless knew what Han Sen was thinking, though. She smiled
and said, “The Buddha aren’t very interested in celebrity. I rarely
go out with my rank on display.”</p>
<p>“That’s why?” Han Sen nodded, and then asked, “Is there anywhere
special I can visit? I’m sure you know the most interesting
landmarks around here.”</p>
<p>You can call me Speechless, by the way.” Speechless paused and
then said, “I don’t think ordinary relics would interest you, but
there is a Buddha Wall that resides four hundred miles from here.
It is a place that was visited by a half-deified Buddha King. You
should take a look, sir.”</p>
<p>“Call me Han Sen. Being called sir is strange.” Han Sen
smiled.</p>
<p>Speechless Buddha Lady nodded and spoke about the origin of the
Happy Buddha Wall. She spoke well, and she was pretty to boot. It
wasn’t a boring listen.</p>
<p>The Happy Buddha Wall was not created by Happy Buddha King. It
was a student that drew an image of Happy Buddha King across that
wall. That was how it came to be known as Happy Buddha Wall.</p>
<p>Happy Buddha King was a very famous half-deified person, but he
left a long time ago. His name was still commonly heard in the
city, though, and he was a figure that was most well-known.</p>
<p>The student that drew his image was not any ordinary person,
either. He was a legendary fellow.</p>
<p>Out of the higher races, the Buddha society included the most
outsiders. In the Buddha Kingdom, only one percent of its people
were full-blooded Buddha. The rest were outsiders, and many of them
were quite famous.</p>
<p>Some of the famous outsiders were even Kings.</p>
<p>The person that drew Happy Buddha King was an outsider Duke
named Silla. That person admired Happy Buddha King a great deal, so
they wished to draw him a portrait.</p>
<p>There were many different stories. Silla met with Happy Buddha
King ten times with the offer, and each time Silla was rejected.
The eleventh time, however, Happy Buddha King allowed Silla to
proceed. The Happy Buddha Wall was the result.</p>
<p>Before finishing the drawing, Silla practiced for three years
straight in complete isolation. When Silla returned, Silla did so
as a King. Silla eventually went on to become half-deified, as
well.</p>
<p>There was a saying amongst the Buddha: Silla King was a famous
King, but just like Happy Buddha King, history forgot them. All
people now knew was the remnant of the Happy Buddha Wall.</p>
<p>Han Sen liked the story, and when it came to a close, they were
on Sky Cliff. That was where the wall was.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that the place, due to its sacred importance,
would be well-protected. But there was not even a railing, and they
were able to come right before the wall.</p>
<p>The Happy Buddha Wall was drawn on the cliffside. It was at
least ten meters high. It looked rather strange.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Happy Buddha Wall from far away. He
wondered, “I thought this was an image of Happy Buddha King. Why
are there two Buddha’s painted on the wall? Which one is he?”</p>
<p>The wall portrayed a Buddha sitting upon a lotus flower,
smiling. But there was also a Buddha lady next to the Buddha. She
was holding his neck, and they were locked in a kiss.</p>
<p>Speechless smiled and said, “I thought there were a lot of gods
in the beliefs of the Rebate. Happy Buddha King is our lover god.
Happy Buddha King is called Ming King, and the Buddha lady there is
Ming’s wife. They were both deified, and forever together. They
were both called Happy Buddha King.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Han Sen may have said that, but inside, he thought,
“Isn’t this like a combination of two? I thought it was just one
King, but it was in fact a horny old man and his woman.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is sense, and sense is not nothing. Nothing is not
sense. Where the senses are, is where the Buddha are.” Speechless
spoke to Han Sen seriously.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand this. It seems as if I am not suitable
enough for the Buddha.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Speechless smiled and said, “I cannot tell you if this is
suitable for you, but perhaps by looking at the wall, you may learn
a thing or two. When Silla drew this picture, Silla King learned of
what it meant to be happy. The happiness is inside this very wall.
If this is your fate, then you will learn something, also.”</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the Happy Buddha Wall, but could not learn
anything. He gave a wry smile and said, “It seems as if I am not
suitable for the Buddha, as I am unable to glean anything.”</p>
<p>“I have a way for you to see it, but I will have to help you.
Are you willing to try this?” Speechless’ beautiful eyes peered
right through Han Sen.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to help, then of course.” Han Sen
smiled.</p>
<p>“Okay, then look into my eyes. Tell me what it is that you see.”
Speechless smiled at Han Sen, as her eyes began to show some form
of movement.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at her eyes, but her eyes were too pretty. It was
difficult to describe how beautiful they were. They were
crystal-clear, and looking at them made people want to stare in
awe.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt like his vision was becoming sucked into her own.
Within the reflection of her eyes, he clearly saw himself. But the
shadow was so strange, and he saw himself naked. He wore nothing in
front of Speechless Buddha Lady.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he had just been shot in the head. So many
thoughts rushed to his mind all at once, many of which made him
blush.</p>
<p>Speechless’ eyes continued looking at Han Sen. They became
watery, and she looked at Han Sen strangely.</p>
