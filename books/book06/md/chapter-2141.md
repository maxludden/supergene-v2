  “Suppress Evil? This is both the best and worst geno art to consider teaching.” Sky Path Garden’s leader squinted his eyes and looked over the training ground.

“Leader, why do you say that?” White Real asked.

The leader smiled and said, “Suppress Evil is difficult. There are many meanings to glean from the thirty million words contained in its text. It could easily take an entire year to explain a single paragraph. Many people that have practiced it can teach it, but it’s hard because of the sheer breadth of the technique. Talking about one paragraph hardly helps anyone, so the students aren’t likely to learn much.”

After pausing, he went on to say, “The same is true with Four Season Duke from Rui Beast. He teaches Suppress Evil, and he has been learning it for centuries. And even with all that talent, he has only managed to reach its eighth tier. The Sky Palace leader has managed to fulfill all eleven tiers, but he is the only one that has.”

“Only he has been able to do that? There has never been another?” White Real asked.

“Others have done it, but they are few. Aside from the leader, there is one other who occupied the first elder seat. He has been gone for a long time, though. No one knows whether or not he still lives,” the leader said.

Thousand Feather Crane and the Yun sisters, upon hearing that Han Sen had been forced to teach Suppress Evil, looked worried.

They had just reminded Han Sen not to do this, since Four Season Duke usually taught it. He lectured on Suppress Evil every month, and according to his timetable, he would be there teaching again the next day.

If Han Sen’s speech on Suppress Evil was terrible, then the next day, when Four Season Duke taught it, people were going to openly proclaim the Duke to be superior. It wouldn’t do much damage to Han Sen’s reputation in the long run, but it’d still look bad.

But if Han Sen did well enough to embarrass Four Season Duke, that wouldn’t be great either. It was bad to offend a Duke.

So, it did not matter if he taught Suppress Evil with a high proficiency or a low proficiency. He was doomed, either way. That was why they had explicitly told Han Sen to avoid teaching Suppress Evil.

Now that Yu Jing and Lone Bamboo had come forward to request it in particular, Han Sen had no choice but to comply, though.

Han Sen didn’t bother worrying about it. He didn’t know what else he could teach, and he had at least prepared a little with Suppress Evil. So, lackadaisically, he was just going to go forward with that.

The Suppress Evil Han Sen had learned was different from the teachings the average student received with it, however. Ordinary students were required to reach King class before being given access to Hidden Path cave and observing the seventy-two gene kill spells. Before that, their teachings were relegated to the pages of books.

But Han Sen had already observed the seventy-two gene skill spells, and by following those, he learned it with a great deal of proficiency. So, Han Sen had already established the basics and continued on.

Because his audience had studied the skill in such a radically different way, their opinions on the teachings could be wildly different. Han Sen wasn’t planning on teaching in a conventional method, however. He had another way to go about this.

“If everyone wishes to hear about Suppress Evil, I will discuss it and recount my own experiences. Today, I will talk to you all about the Gold Star Punch, one of the seventy-two Suppress Evil punches,” Han Sen said.

“Brother Han, what is a Suppress Evil punch? We haven’t encountered anything like that in our learnings of Suppress Evil,” Yu Jing asked. Han Sen’s first sentence made many people very curious.

Suppress Evil was a very complex geno art, and its power was very unique. The power that fueled it came from within, but it did not correlate with the physical capabilities of your actual body.

Basically, Suppress Evil was similar in some ways to the Purple Eye godlights. It was a special power that was used independently, rather than being combined with some sort of physical strike.

But because Han Sen had studied the original gene kill spells, he knew a lot about how the skill could actually be used. Rather than spending forever talking about the individual elements of the skill, Han Sen was going to start with the finished product; in this case, a punch. Then, the students could reverse-engineer their understanding of the skill from the feelings that the finished product gave them.

Other teachers could take the time to teach about the nitty-gritty details, Han Sen figured. He wasn’t going to do that. He was going to talk about a basic punch that stemmed from the original gene kill spells. And through that punch, the students would learn about the technique at large.

Normal people wouldn’t understand this, but if they practiced the skill and could get to grips with the sensation of the punch, they would understand the meaning of the original gene kill spells.

Practice makes perfect; do something over and over, and you’re bound to get better. Han Sen was well-acquainted with this basic method.

But being basic didn’t mean that it was a bad method. Ordinary students weren’t like Four Season Duke, who had all the time in the world to learn about Suppress Evil. If they wanted to learn it properly, Four Season Duke’s method might take their entire lifetime.

So, Han Sen’s basic method was for the students that did not have as much time to learn Suppress Evil.

If the students wished to learn Suppress Evil, learning a Suppress Evil punch would be good. None of them had seen an original gene kill spell before, but if they practiced and researched it like this, then the entire process was sure to be faster.

The only bad thing about a Suppress Evil punch was the limit that Han Sen himself imposed. Even if the students learned the skills as well as Han Sen, they could only be as good as Han Sen. They couldn’t go any further.

But for most ordinary people, that was enough. Han Sen’s Suppress Evil was at tier eight. If they mastered the punch, they would be equal to the eighth tier of Suppress Evil, as well.

Four Season Duke had practiced Suppress Evil for centuries, and he hadn’t gone any farther than eight tiers either.

“A Suppress Evil punch is a fist technique that I learned from Suppress Evil. Suppress Evil is too big to teach in its entirety, so I will teach you all about a specific technique. I hope this can help everyone further their practices with Suppress Evil,” Han Sen said as an introduction.

Everyone was interested. They had never heard Suppress Evil being spoken of in such a way. It was like they were having a chemistry lesson, and the topic of the day was punches. The two things didn’t really make much sense when combined. There didn’t seem to be a relation between the two, but it still sparked much curiosity.

“If there are no questions, I will teach you all the first technique. It is named Gold Star Punch, and it stems from the seventy-two Suppress Evil punches.” Han Sen taught them his fist skill.

This skill was not particularly difficult. It was just like any fist skill. It took the shape of the original gene kill spells and that was that. However, it had a great deal of depth. In order to master it, a student would have to understand the original gene kill spells inside and out.

Han Sen wanted to teach swordskills, but so many Sky Palace students used swords that there was already a flood of swordskills. He settled on punches instead.
