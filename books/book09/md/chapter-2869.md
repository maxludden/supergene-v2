  “Just using a hand to flip space and changing fate is very powerful.” Han Sen felt a chill while watching this. He was suspicious about this Very High Leader being the person he went back in time to see. The performance gave people different feelings. “The Very High Sense practice Sky and Men Combined Together at an extreme level. It won’t just flip space. It can even swap galaxies, change the sky, and swap the ground. It is not difficult, but no one of the Very High has reached that level before. People can swap a little planet but changing the universe’s power is impossible.” God paused and went on to say, “For the Very High to be able to practice to this level is something very rare to see in their history. Concentrating space into his hands, even god spirits like Sky Armor God could not do something similar.”

“How do we break that power?” Han Sen asked. He had never seen power like this before, so he did not know what to do about it.

“In space, his hands will keep energy flowing,” God casually said. “There are only two ways to get free. One method has you use your fastest speed to travel faster than a galaxy and escape the danger space. The other method is to blow up that space, thus resulting in nothing tying you up.”

Just as God said that, a beast’s roar shocked the sky and shook the universe. In the space that Very High Leader had clutched, Golden Growler was getting bigger.

In the eyes of the audience, the space Very High Leader was holding was just the size of a fist. It was actually an area of space. Golden Growler’s body was getting bigger. It was filling up that whole space. Then, there was a pang sound. A scary gold body blew up the space inside Very High Leader’s hands. It broke out from the palm, becoming an extremely scary giant gold giant beast. The planets next to them were as small as a waterdrop.

Roar!

Golden Growler roared. The whole of the god geno list was shaking. The audience’s hearts were shocked. They felt the roar exhibit an aura of murder and rage. The creatures without any courage felt their legs go weak. They fell. The next second, Golden Growler opened its mouth at Very High Leader. Very High Leader was so tiny next to Golden Growler. There was no way he was going to block the big, scary beast’s attack. Very High Leader’s expression did not change. His hands came together and started spinning. Then, something unbelievable happened.

It was like Golden Growler’s lower body had a spinning wheel. Its body weirdly turned 180 degrees. The big mouth that was going to Very High Leader changed direction.

Golden Growler turned around to bite him again, but Very High Leader spun his hands. Suddenly, the sky and the earth swapped. He and Golden Growler swapped positions in space, enabling Golden Growler’s biting power to miss.

Many creatures watching the fight were frozen, which included Han Sen. This method to swap the sky and change the ground had never been heard of before.

“It is no wonder the Very High is the No. 1 race in the big universe. This method is like God.”

“I would say this is stronger than God. Sky Armor God, who was killed by Dollar, was nothing much. He was not as powerful as Very High Leader.” “Not bad. Not bad. Very High Leader is the strongest person in the universe. That Golden Growler only has invincible giant power. Is he going to be trapped by Very High Leader?” Upon seeing this, Han Sen was very shocked. Very High Leader’s skills were similar to his Dongxuan Area, butt Very High Leader’s power far exceeded his strength. Han Sen was able to learn something from Very High Leader’s skill. Very High Leader being able to do this makes my control of the universal cogwheels more detailed. I should be able to do the same, but his method is obviously supported by a geno art. I do not have a geno art. If I am just going to have to explore this on my own, it will be kind of annoying.

Han Sen felt very conflicted about this. He hoped that Very High Leader would perform this a few more times so he could learn the techniques he needed to.

He also wanted Golden Growler to find a way to break it. Otherwise, being played like that was useless, even if one did have a lot of power.

“To be able to practice Very High Sense to this extreme, Very High Leader is not too bad.” God seemed to admire the spectacle, but that power clearly did not surprise him.

Han Sen’s heart jumped. He looked at God and asked, “Why do I think Very High Leader is more powerful than Sky Armor God. Is it an illusion?”

God laughed. “It is not an illusion. Sky Armor God wanted his god personality back. He forced himself to combine with Deep Abyss Knight, who was only a butterfly. When Sky Armor God combined with him, he forced it to true god class. At the end of the day, Deep Abyss Knight’s body was not enough. Also, Deep Abyss Knight’s abilities were different from Sky Armor God’s. It was hard for Sky Armor God to use all of his power. If he combined the true god class with a body of the same element, it would have been far more difficult for you to win. But talking about real power here, Very High Leader might not be weaker than Sky Armor God. To see which is greater, you would have to wait for Very High Leader to go to the geno hall. He will have to battle Sky Armor God to find out.”

After God said all that, Han Sen felt nervous.

Golden Growler’s body and power looked very mighty. He was almost invincible. He was much stronger than Han Sen and Han Sen’s body now.

Now, he was unable to touch Very High Leader. It did not matter how strong he was. Golden Growler kept trying to consume Very High Leader, who kept using his skills to change the sky and swap the ground. Very High Leader did not move an inch, but Golden Growler was not even able to ruffle his clothing.

Upon seeing this, Zhang Xuandao complimentarily said, “This old man is getting stronger.” “After all, he is Very High Leader,” the woman said. “It is not a surprise to learn he has this sort of power.”

“It looks like this will be his final fight,” Zhang Xuandao said. “Successful or not, he will be going to the geno hall very soon.”

“The Very High have had many people enter the geno hall, but none ever come back,” the woman said. “Do you think he will be able to return?” “If I knew that, I would not be just sitting here. I would have gone to the geno hall and start killing,” Zhang Xuandao sighed and said, “It is a shame that the rules for the top 100 of the geno god list are so weird. I thought I could fight him, but I can only challenge him once. I am afraid I am not going to find out.”

Golden Growler kept attacking uselessly, so he stopped jumping. He stood in space, looked at Very High Leader, and ceased moving.

“You may possess the blood of the growlers, but you cannot win,” Very High Leader coldly said. “Why don’t you concede and quit?” “Why are you waiting? Our Little Mountain Leader never loses.” The green-haired beast was angry. He suddenly thought of something and said, “This Very High Leader is, admittedly, quite good. The way he changes the sky and swaps the ground is rare to see in the universe.”

The woman nearby looked serious. She nodded and said, “The Very High was able to become a high race not just through sheer luck. It looks like Little Mountain Leader has to use that skill. I cannot believe he has to use it in his first fight.
