  They waited the night out together, and on the next day, they returned to Devil-Blood Shelter. But this time, they approached from another side and looked for the perfect opportunity to draw out more super creatures.

Wang Yuhang had only one more vial of Angel Gene Fluid left, so he'd have to use it sparingly. Therefore, Han Sen opted for a more careful route this time, and only aimed to attract one or two powerful super creatures. In the meantime, Wang Yuhang would be sidelined a good distance away, ready for the pull, lest his poor luck ruin Han Sen's precision.

"Little Uncle, any idea on how I can draw them out?" Han Sen crouched low behind a rock, pointing towards a creature that stood along the ramparts of Devil-Blood Shelter.

Han Sen used his devil-eye mask to get a proper look at it. The super creature had the strongest lifeforce he had seen yet, and it could very well have been a second-generation super creature. It was quite far from him, but he didn't dare get any closer. The limited range was what made his dongxuan aura ineffective.

"And for what reason would you select that brute? Why not the golem?" Wang Yuhang asked, looking at the super creature with a confused expression.

The super creature was a silver-white ape. It was a three-meter-tall beast with silver fur. Its muscles were pronounced, glistening like brushed steel. It looked tremendously powerful.

That being said, its body looked clumsy. It moved quickly, with shining eyes. And the ears were weirdly curled, like snails.

"I have a feeling it will drop us a beast soul." Han Sen laughed.

"And might you explain to me how you are able to deduce such a thing?" Wang Yuhang balked, with his eyes wide open. The silver ape didn't look as if it would drop a beast soul, no matter which way he viewed it.

"Do you have any ideas or not?" Han Sen asked.

"To attract Brutus? That shan't be a problem." Wang Yuhang looked around and nodded an affirmative.

"In that case, I will leave it to you." Han Sen, with the silver fox in tow, sneaked away in preparation for their cooperative action.

Wang Yuhang did not use an arrow this time. Instead, he merely came out from the behind the rocks and shouted in the direction of Devil-Blood Shelter, "You there, monkey boy! Over here!"

His call garnered much attention, and the silver-ape looked over in his direction.

Wang Yuhang reached out his arm and presented a fist. Slowly, he lifted his middle finger. In the next second, the thumping of a chest and a frightening roar sounded.

The silver-ape cried out to the sky, and the dragon joined in. Next the golem did, too. They all screamed at their latest intruder with bloodlust. And then there were more.

"Oh my days! This is far too much!" Wang Yuhang was shocked by the sudden additions to his fan club, and he wasted no time in running away. His stinginess was not an issue this time, either, and so he injected himself with the Angel Gene Fluid immediately.

Han Sen saw ten super creatures chasing after Wang Yuhang, and it shocked even him. His eyes stared at his fleeing companion with wide eyes, unsure of whether or not the two would survive whatever battle was about to occur.

Han Sen followed after them in the shadows, and the ten creatures were determined to chase down the rat that was Wang Yuhang. If he needed saving, Han Sen wasn't sure he could do anything for the little uncle this time.

Even Wang Yuhang knew this was too much. With the boons and bonus effects granted by the Angel Gene Fluid, he did not stop running. And as great as his initial advantage was, nothing he did nor anywhere he went shook loose his tail.

When Wang Yuhang was in genuine danger, he would not shout. He knew doing so would be pointless, and he was aware Han Sen was in the vicinity, regardless. He believed shouting would only distract Han Sen and delay his own rescue.

Han Sen followed the pursuit for a while, but soon came to the realization he'd get nowhere by merely continuing to follow. There was no chance for Han Sen to save Wang Yuhang, and there was no possible way he could tackle so many super creatures, all at once.

But as he watched them go, running off as they did, Han Sen suddenly had an idea.

"So many super creatures have run out, the shelter must be empty! Should I try to grab the spirit stone? If I nab Devil-Blood King's spirit stone, this entire situation will resolve itself. If Devil-Blood King opts for suicide, the creatures will become nothing but sand," Han Sen thought.

Han Sen bit down on his teeth and summoned Moment Queen. "Continue following him and ensure he draws them as far away as possible. If he looks as if he's about to keel over and die, save him if you can. Try to the stop the monsters."

"You are going to Devil-Blood Shelter?" Moment Queen was quick to understand Han Sen's plan.

"There's a chance, and I'm going to take it." Han Sen's eyes told her of how sure he was of this plan.

"Then be careful. There are at least five more super creatures inside," Moment Queen informed Han Sen.

"If there are five, I have a chance. I won't have to defeat them, after all. All I have to do is grab that spirit stone." Han Sen nodded reassuringly.

Moment Queen did not say anything further, and she simply took off after Wang Yuhang.

Moment Queen's teleportation abilities could save Wang Yuhang, if the need arose. If he sent Little Angel, the same could not be said. Even though Han Sen needed Moment Queen with him, he still sent her to safeguard Wang Yuhang.

If the creatures returned to the shelter, Moment Queen could use her speed to kite them away again and guarantee Han Sen the time he would need.

Han Sen turned around and ran towards the shelter. He didn't rush inside immediately, however. He used telepathy to communicate with Moment Queen, so he could get a clearer grasp on the situation with Wang Yuhang while he was away.

Generally, there was a finite range in which the super creatures would follow. They wouldn't pursue a random trespasser to the ends of the world, as they were bound to a shelter. But of course, Wang Yuhang was Wang Yuhang, and he had led them for far longer than he should have had to. Two hours later, he was still leading them on.

Wang Yuhang was injured, and the Angel Gene Fluid would soon run out. It was a miracle he hadn't died yet, being chased by ten super creatures.

"Han Sen is going to get me killed!" Wang Yuhang's spirit had been drained of hope. Seeing all the creatures still chasing him, he closed his eyes and readied himself for death.

But then, he was lifted up by an unseen force with great haste. He evaded every super creature's attack and all of a sudden, found himself at a great distance away from his aggressors.

Wang Yuhang was delighted at this sudden happening, and when he looked up, he saw Moment Queen had picked him up by his clothes.

"Continue inspiring their ire," Moment Queen coldly said.

Wang Yuhang had snapped out of his death-ready daze, and in Moment Queen's arms, he turned and shouted towards the creatures, "You turtles! Come and get me; I'm right here. Come and get your Wang Pi√±ata."

Han Sen finally arrived in front of the shelter he sought to infiltrate. Like an arrow, he went straight inside, unwavering.
