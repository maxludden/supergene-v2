<h2>Forming a Stone</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2584</h3>

<p>There was no getting rid of Ning Yue, so Han Sen had to bring
her with him. Gu Qingcheng, Elysian Moon, Bao’er, and the little
red bird also came along. Fang Qing Yu decided to stay behind.</p>
<p>The further into the depths they went, the scarier the wind
became. Whenever the wind blew, not even Gu Qingcheng and Elysian
Moon could keep their balance. They didn’t know why the wind was
becoming so strong as they went deeper.</p>
<p>For there to be so much wind, there had to be a windy exit. But
when he looked down, what was seen was a hellish crack. No air
could escape.</p>
<p>Ning Yue was scared, but she was unaffected. The little green
sword she wielded kept the scary wind from getting close to
her.</p>
<p>“I wonder what that little green sword is? Its abilities are too
scary,” Han Sen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was thinking, the white tiger suddenly disappeared.
It was like it had just vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>“Why has the white tiger disappeared?” Ning Yue shouted in
fear.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could answer, the white tiger was there again. It
rumbled at Han Sen, and while Han Sen was still reeling from the
shock, it disappeared again.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others moved carefully forward and found a hole
in the ground. It dropped almost straight down, which was why it
looked like the white tiger had disappeared.</p>
<p>Due to the angle, Han Sen hadn’t noticed the hole until they
were right on top of it.</p>
<p>They followed the white tiger down, and what they found at the
bottom caught Han Sen by surprise.</p>
<p>It was a jar-shaped cave. They came in from the side, but there
was no other exit. That place was a dead end.</p>
<p>The fact that the cave was a dead end wasn’t what had caught
their attention, though. There was something in the cave.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t recognize the device. Most of it was obscured by
the stone that covered it, and only about one foot of it could be
seen. The device was purple like copper, and there were some
strange symbols carved across it. It looked like the handle of
something, but it wasn’t like the grip of a sword or a knife. That
was because this handle was only as thick as a couple of Han Sen’s
fingers. And even with the little they could see right now, the
group knew that it was too long to be a normal handle.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were still looking at that purple copper
object that was buried by rocks when suddenly, a weird symbol shone
with purple light. And right after, a scary storm came out of the
purple object.</p>
<p>Everyone was blown away by the wind. They bounced around the
cave like rubber balls until the wind escaped through the passage
they had used to enter. The respite afterward allowed them to get
back on their feet.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the little red bird had been left rather disheveled
by the abrupt gust. The wind was far stronger than what they had
experienced before.</p>
<p>The wind was comparatively gentle when it entered the tunnel,
but inside that cave, they were exposed to the full power of the
gusts.</p>
<p>“What is this? How can it be so powerful?” Han Sen looked at the
purple copper object with shock. His eyes were glowing.</p>
<p>“Meow.” The white tiger had walked over to stand next to the
purple copper object. It used a paw to point at the item, and then
it called to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You mean, you want me to get it out of there?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“Meow,” the white tiger said with a nod.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng was staring intently at the purple copper object,
and she made a guess. “Maybe this thing can restrain the monster
outside.”</p>
<p>“Meow.” The white tiger immediately nodded after hearing Gu
Qingcheng speak.</p>
<p>“Is such a thing possible?” Han Sen thought, suddenly excited by
the prospect. He had been trying to think of a way they could deal
with the monster on the island, but he hadn’t yet come up with
anything. If this weapon could be used against their enemies, then
their crisis would be resolved. And Han Sen would receive another
treasure, to boot. This was good.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything, and he went straight up to the
purple copper object. He used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine
it.</p>
<p>The Purple-Eye Butterfly spun around in Han Sen’s eye like four
cherry blossoms. Within Han Sen’s vision, the history of the purple
copper object began to play back like a movie.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. While the Purple-Eye Butterfly was
rewinding, he was able to see what it was. It was a purple copper
jian swordbreaker.</p>
<p>The jian was a very rare weapon. It looked like a sword, but the
blade was square. Rather than having a typical blade, which focused
on sharpness, this weapon was all about strength.</p>
<p>Ordinary jians were used in pairs, so a single jian was
rare.</p>
<p>There was only one weapon here, though. There might have been
another one lying around somewhere, but if so, Han Sen hadn’t seen
it yet.</p>
<p>For some reason, the jian had been left behind in the black sea.
Layers of sediment had accumulated from the black sea, slowly
building up to form the island they were currently inside.</p>
<p>Based on its depth, Han Sen couldn’t help but wonder if the
weapon had somehow drawn the sediment together to make this entire
mushroom island.</p>
<p>But that jian’s weird symbols kept releasing storms, so its
handle was clear of any rock. Furthermore, it had carved out an
entire cave. Based on how well it was hidden, Han Sen had no idea
how the white tiger had found it.</p>
<p>Han Sen then had a weird thought. “That means this island is a
stone inside the Black Hole Spider’s stomach. The spider should
have expelled any substances it couldn’t digest over the years.
Instead, because of this purple copper jian, the substances have
built up into a solid mass. After billions of years, this entire
island has been created.”</p>
<p>“Let me try it,” Elysian Moon said. As Han Sen watched, Elysian
Moon walked over to the purple copper jian. She cast a power and
wrapped her hands around the exposed portion.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Before Elysian Moon applied any strength to her grip, a
frightening gale of wind blasted her body away at lightning speed.
Han Sen and the others didn’t fare much better.</p>
<p>They did not know what the purple copper jian was, but the fact
that it could release such power when no one was even using it was
amazing. Not even the little red bird could withstand the wind it
summoned. This wasn’t an ordinary item, that was for sure.</p>
<p>“It looks like a deified weapon with a wind element. Is there
anyone who is a master of the element of wind?” Gu Qingcheng
said.</p>
<p>Everyone swapped glances with each other. No one there really
focused on wind.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep trying. Maybe we don’t have to be too attuned with
the wind element. If we can’t pull it out, we can remove the rocks
that are surrounding it,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon nodded and drew her paper umbrella. She used it as
a sword and slashed at the rocks atop the purple copper jian. The
tip of the umbrella unleashed a raging swordlight that slammed into
the rock.</p>
<p>That strike was strong enough to cut a hole through an entire
planet, but when the light faded, the rocks weren’t even scratched.
Everyone stared at the undamaged rocks with slack jaws.</p>
