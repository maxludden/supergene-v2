  Inside the cafe, Stay Up Late was wearing his uniform as he researched coffee. He suddenly frowned. He put down his tools and took off his apron and placed them on the counter.

“Stay Up Late, where are you going?” The manager looked at him strangely.

“I’m going to the bathroom, I’ll be right back.” Stay Up Late smiled at the manager, and then walked away.

He walked out the back door, and as soon as he stepped out, he ran straight back towards Han Manor. There, he saw the black tiger doing combat.

The black tiger was about to strike Luo Lan, and Stay Up Late sighed to himself. He said, “This woman doesn’t even have geno armor, and yet she’s that cocky? Humans are so weak. But I promised Han Sen I’d keep his family safe. I’ll have to kill that guy.”

Just as Stay Up Late was about to get closer, he stopped. He looked towards Luo Lan.

Seeing the black tiger going to land a finishing strike on her, Ji Yanran and Zero looked on in shock. A hand had stopped the descent of that paw. The claws were held fast and unable to move.

A strong human body was in front of her now, blocking the tiger.

It was a man. He looked young, but he should have been middle-aged. The man’s face looked like ice, but there was a fire burning in his eyes.

Luo Lan only saw his back, but the moment she saw it, she looked so happy. She was too excited to speak.

“Touch… my… woman… and… die!” The man sounded very cold. His power was like that of a volcano, and he blasted the black tiger away.

The next second, the man disappeared and teleported in front of the descending black tiger.

The black tiger was surprised. He was squaring off against another human, but he had been sent flying while still wearing his geno armor. He was shocked by the power the man wielded.

He used the power of his geno armor and attempted to grab the man, but all of a sudden, he could not move.

Pang! Pang! Pang!

The man’s fists were like a rainstorm as they pelted into the black tiger. The constant sound of impacts chimed with the nonstop strikes at the armor.

The raging fists kept on whacking the armor, and while the armor did not break, his power still penetrated the defense and shook the black tiger within. The black tiger’s organs became twisted, and he continuously choked up blood.

The black tiger’s eyes turned red, and he looked extremely angry. His opponent was just a human, and what’s more, the man wasn’t even wearing geno armor. And that power he wielded could render the safety of the tiger’s armor inert. It was quite scary.

The scarier thing was that he couldn’t move. He kept on submitting to the pummeling.

Katcha!

The black tiger realized that the crazy punching was beginning to crack the geno armor.

“Who are you?” the black tiger wanted to scream. He looked terrified, but he couldn’t make a noise.

Pang!

The black tiger’s geno armor helmet was broken. The fist then came through the shards of helmet that remained, crushing the black tiger’s face. His face, after taking that punch, was a mess. The eyeballs fell from their sockets. The mouth was twisted, and teeth fell out as the creature puked more blood.

Pang! Pang! Pang!

The black tiger was like an airborne punching bag now. The fists kept on punching it as the entire body twisted more and more. Blood spilled like rain, and the bones kept breaking.

Ji Yanran ran over to Zero and Luo Lan and helped get them up. She wanted to take them away, but she was frozen by the sight of that wretched fight.

Stay Up Late looked at the man in the air and was shocked. He said, “He isn’t wearing geno armor, and yet he is so strong. I didn’t expect a human could be as strong as this. If he had a geno armor, he might be qualified.”

“Interesting. What is the relationship between that man and Han Sen? And the woman must be Luo Lan. Does that mean he is Han Sen’s father? Or Luo Lan’s partner?” Stay Up Late continued looking at the man with interest.

“Impossible! Impossible! A human that has no geno armor cannot do this. How is this possible?!” The black tiger was incredibly frightened.

Han Yufei’s eyes looked murderous. He stretched his arm and delivered another punch to the black tiger’s chest. The cracking geno armor t finally shattered. It fell to pieces like shards of broken glass.

Without the armor’s protection, Han Yufei’s fist went right through the black tiger’s chest It cleaved its way through the bones, right into the creature’s heart.

The next second, as the black tiger looked on hopelessly, Han Yufei put another fist into the creature’s chest Then, he ripped the entire body in half with nothing but his bare hands.

The blood and organs fell to the ground with what was left of the battered body. Craters formed where they landed, and the man remained airborne, floating where he had been.

Han Yufei gave Luo Lan a gesture, and then, Luo Lan gestured back with excitement Han Yufei nodded, shook his head, and then disappeared.

“Mom, who is that?” Ji Yanran looked at Luo Lan and thought to herself, “Has she found a new boyfriend? She raised Han Sen and Han Yan alone, she should have a life of her own now.”

“That was Han Sen’s father. That was your father-in-law.” Luo Lan looked at the vanished shadow and seemed disappointed.

“I… I thought he…” Ji Yanran looked at her in disbelief. She spoke half of what she was going to, but thought something was amiss and stopped.

“He had his reasons. Don’t say it out loud,” Luo Lan quietly responded.

As they spoke, someone jumped in front of Ji Yanran. The person reached for Littleflower and gave an evil laugh. The person said, “Officers are predictable. He knew the black tiger would not get the job done, and he knew there was something wrong in the Han family. Han Yufei is not dead, and he is on the god level. He killed the black tiger with his geno armor, so he must be the heir of Han Jinzhi. I am going to take the credit”
