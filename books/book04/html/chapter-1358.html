      Shelters in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary were different than those of the
      Third God’s Sanctuary. Aside from the geno core you could obtain from a
      claimed shelter, an additional geno core could be retrieved from a
      treasure chest if the shelter was previously unclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moment Queen had yet to recover from her injuries, but she was still able
      to control the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, Dragon Lady, and Cheap Sheep visited the vault where the treasure
      chests were supposed to reside. Upon opening the door and giddily stepping
      inside, they were presented with three treasure chests beside each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design of the chests was very different than they had initially
      expected. They weren’t containers; instead, they were more like pedestals
      that extended all the way from the ground and into the ceiling. They
      looked like pillars, that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them was silver, indicating it possessed a silver geno core. The
      other two were bronze, undoubtedly containing bronze geno cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen went straight for the silver pedestal, an action that went
      unopposed. After all, if it wasn’t for him, they might have all died under
      the sinister gaze of the psychotic butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen pressed his hand against the pedestal, and it began to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no button, and the pedestal did not descend under the force of
      Han Sen’s hand; instead, it was an operation performed by Moment Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Atop the pillar was something hovering in a magical light. It was a purple
      ring.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen grabbed the ring and heard an announcement play:</p>
    <p>“Silver Geno Core obtained: Demon Heart Ring.”</p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen reviewed the information that came along with it, he was
      pleasantly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>Demon Heart Ring: Dark Element Geno Core</p>
    <p>
      Dark elemental geno cores were extremely rare, and so were the geno
      points. It was fortunate Han Sen had gathered all that he could in the
      Third God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen left the bronze geno cores for Dragon Lady and, begrudgingly,
      Cheap Sheep. They were of no worth to Han Sen, now that he had a silver
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady received a set of armor, while Cheap Sheep received a mirror.
      The mirror was able to concentrate light and deal damage via the
      reflection—a neat item, but wholly useless for Han Sen to even consider
      stealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen researched the two silver geno cores he had received, and he
      learned that the Butler Doll could petrify opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Demon Heart Ring was able to fortify the heart of its wearer.
      Unfortunately, it came with a trade-off. Its usage would damage the body,
      so Han Sen wouldn’t be able to wear it very long. It was a situational
      item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary, Han Sen decided to return to the Alliance. His mother, Ji Yanran,
      and Little Yan were delighted and greatly relieved to see him again. Han
      Sen contacted his good friends, who all went on to congratulate his
      successful ascension as a demigod, and his ability to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn’t stay there for long, though. He didn’t want to risk an attack on
      his shelter during his absence. Before he was comfortable leaving there
      for a time, he’d have to become much stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even ordinary geno points were able to increase one’s fitness a great
      deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hundred ordinary geno points could increase a person’s fitness level
      by two thousand. One hundred primitive geno points could increase a
      person’s fitness by four thousand. One hundred super geno points could
      increase a person’s fitness by thirty thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen was able to max out his ordinary geno points, he’d have reached
      a fitness figure of ten thousand. Once he got to that point, he could
      fight primitive creatures without much of an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Killing ordinary creatures was not a difficult task for Han Sen, and he
      was able to keep using the egg in his post-return hunting ventures. He was
      able to max out that figure in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s poisonous meat trick hadn’t worked, it also turned out. Whatever
      creature lurked in the deep depths of that pit was still alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep was getting cozy with the prospect of Han Sen being his boss,
      and he accepted the role of being Bao’er’s plaything. The sheep wasn’t the
      strongest of allies one could have, but Han Sen had developed a bit of a
      soft spot for him. He’d feel bad about kicking the sheep out, so he
      allowed him to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one condition for him being allowed to remain in Han Sen’s
      company, though. Cheap Sheep was not allowed to call Han Sen boss. Every
      time Han Sen heard it, a shiver and a chill would strike his spine like
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he maxed out his ordinary geno points, Han Sen decided to follow
      Dragon Lady to the shelter she had once mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Jade Hill did not have many primitive creatures, and they always
      seemed to travel in a group, it was best if they ventured out together as
      one, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady was already in a group, one Han Sen was gladly invited to
      join, given his recent performance. With that group, he was sure to do
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not think himself invincible, and he knew his hyper geno arts
      and geno cores weren’t good enough to face whatever challenge came his
      way, so he thought the prospect of having a few buddies to back him up
      would be a great idea.
    </p>
    <p>Bao’er rode Cheap Sheep as they traveled away from Jade Hill.</p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady was familiar with the region they were headed, so any
      potential hotspots were avoided. She knew the best routes to take, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the fourth day, two meteors streaked across the sky. And then, all
      of a sudden, a blizzard blasted a frightful freeze across the land. It
      made for a terrifying journey, in awful conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They still pushed on, but on their way, they encountered many ordinary
      creatures that had been frozen solid. It was horrifying to see, and so Han
      Sen made sure to keep Jadeskin active and hold Bao’er to ensure her
      warmth. To make matters worse, an avalanche began rumbling down towards
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no! Someone is fighting.” Dragon Lady summoned a transparent bowl to
      shield them from the tide of snow that was descending upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t a second too soon, either. Immediately after she did so, the
      snow buried the bowl completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could not tell how thick the snow was, but it was incredibly cold
      in there.
