“Please stop where you are.”

Han Sen was holding Bao’er while flying through the blizzard when he heard a woman’s voice call out to him. He stopped and looked.

Ever since he had gone to the ice fields via Galaxy Teleportation, he had been on the hunt for land pulses. Unfortunately, he was not very good at looking for pulses. Up until now, he had yet to find anything. He regretted not bringing Mister Yang or Bald Guy along. That would have been great. The people coming toward him were a man and a woman. They were both riding atop a Kirin. Han Sen had noticed their presence a long time ago. He just did not know why they wanted him to stop.

“What is your name, Mister? We are Xuan Mi Zong’s students, Tian Jing and Zhen Xia.” A man and a woman dismounted the jade Kirin. The woman performed a strange hand gesture at Han Sen while she spoke.

“How lucky is that? I am just a nobody. I do not need to tell you my name. What do you two need?” Han Sen did not have much to think about concerning the Xuan Mi Zong. He only knew it was one of the parties in Wu Wei Dao Palace.

Han Sen had already seen Zhuo Dong Lai from the Sky Party. Compared to Zhuo Dong Lai, it was clear to him that these people were far inferior beings.

“Excuse me for asking, but what is your relation to this little girl?” Tian Jing looked inside Han Sen’s cloak and saw Bao’er’s head sticking out of it a bit.

“Has my daughter somehow offended you?” Han Sen thought about it. Bao’er had been with him the entire time. There was no way she would have had the opportunity to go and prank someone.

“Is she really your daughter?” Tian Jing looked at Han Sen and Bao’er with sheer disbelief.

“Yes. Is there a problem?” Han Sen did not know what she was implying.

“Is that a real daughter? Does she share your blood?” Tian Jing asked.

“Of course, she is,” Han Sen said with a frown. “What do you guys want? If there is nothing important for you to tell me, I need to be on my way. There are more important things for me to spend my time doing.” Tian Jing thought for a moment before saying, “I would like to take your daughter as a student. Let her join the Xuan Mi Zong. If you have any conditions about her membership, ask all the questions you want to. If you have a monetary concern, name any sum of money.”

Tian Jing thought Han Sen and Bao’er did not look similar in the least. It was hard to believe they were a real father and daughter. Ergo, she wished to test them.

If he was planning to use a blood sacrifice skill like the evil land pulse masters, they could not resist the temptation and sell the little daughter to her.

After all, blood sacrifice skills only required one little girl. Nothing else was required. Just an ordinary slave girl could get the job done. So, getting a fair price for one little was a tempting prospect.

“Sorry, but I am not selling my daughter,” Han Sen said. He then started moving.

Han Sen thought Tian Jing was a bit too forthwith. She approached him and immediately announced a desire to purchase his daughter. If it was not for Han Sen having a good temper and the woman herself not appearing to be too mean, things would not have ended so nicely. He would have likely beat her up.

“Hang on. I will use this gene race to swap. How about letting your daughter become a student for this?” Zhen Xia stopped Han Sen and summoned a gene race. The gene race looked like a lion. It burned with fire. It melted the snow around. In that snowy place, it was like a burning campfire. It looked very overbearing and weirdly powerful.

“It is a king-class red fire lion,” Zhen Xia said to Han Sen. “If you are willing to let your daughter take up my sister’s offer, it is yours.”

Han Sen frowned. He suddenly heard Bao’er use a voice only the two of them could hear. “Dad, I don’t think you are going to be able to find a land pulse. I think these two people are here looking for a land pulse. Why don’t we follow them and exploit them for resources?”

Han Sen thought this was the right thing to do. Allowing Bao’er to follow them was not a bad idea.

Han Sen coughed and smiled. “If the two of you are so serious about this, then fine. I will let my daughter become this woman’s student. But first thing’s first. Give me the gene race before I give her.”

“That is no problem. We are Xuan Mi Zong students. We would never think of lying to you.” Zhen Xia was very quick to agree. He transferred the red fire lion to Han Sen.

Han Sen took the red fire lion, passed Bao’er to Tian Jing, and said, “Lady, my daughter is in your hands now. It does not matter to me if she wants to be your student.”

Tian Jing looked at Han Sen with disdain. She thought Han Sen was an evil land pulse master who was willing to use a girl to find a land pulse through horrid sacrifice. So, she was not going to behave politely to him.

“Don’t you worry,” Tian Jing coldly said. “You can go now.”

Han Sen was shocked. He asked, “Why should I leave? I am only giving her to you as a student. I am not selling my daughter to you. Why would you think about separating us?”

Tian Jing was speechless. She had never seen someone this obscene before. He sold his daughter and still had the audacity to say something like that.

“We have things to do,” Zhen Xia said with an annoyed look on his face. “We cannot travel with you. If you want to see your daughter again, you can go to Xuan Mi Zong and see her there.”

“OK.” Han Sen felt bad and nodded. He then said to Tian Jing, “My daughter is very naughty. You will have to be careful. Here is my phone number. If you do not want her anymore, just give me a call and I will pick her up in a jiffy.”

“Do not worry. I will take good care of her. I won’t abandon her.” Tian Jing stared at Han Sen. She thought he would never buy Bao’er back.

“Cough! Cough! It is best that way, but you should still keep my number. You never know. It might come in handy one day.” Han Sen wrote his phone number down on a piece of paper and squeezed it into Bao’er’s hands.

“I believe we will never have any contact with you ever again.” Tian Jing did not want to waste any more time with Han Sen. She did not stop getting the phone number, but she put Bao’er atop on the jade Kirin and flew away with Zhen Xia.

“I do not think so,” Han Sen said with a curl of his lips. He then walked off into the storm.

Tian Jing used a warm light to protect Bao’er. She did not want her to get cold. She sounded very caring as she asked, “Little girl, what is your name?”

“Big Sister, my name is Bao’er,” Bao’er said with a blink of her eyes.

“Bao’er, was that person really your dad?” Although Tian Jing was certain Han Sen was an evil land pulse master and wanted to use Bao’er as a blood sacrifice for a land pulse, she still wanted to ask anyway.

“He makes me call him Daddy, but he is not my real father.” Bao’er looked up with pitiable eyes. What Bao’er said was the truth. She wasn’t really born through Han Sen. She came out of a gourd.

In Tian Jing’s ears, those words confirmed that Han Sen was nothing more than an evil land pulse caster.

“He always bullies me and never gives me food.” Bao’er kept crying while she spoke. She looked very pitiable. It was not just Tian Jing whose heart was melting. Even men with iron hearts would have broken down seeing her.

“It is OK, Bao’er. There is no need to worry. Big Sister will look after you from now on. No one will dare try to bully you again. You can eat whatever you want in the future.” As she cradled Bao’er against her bosom, Tian Jing suddenly felt as if she wanted to be a mother.

If Tian Jing knew why Bao’er said Han Sen bullied her, it was because he always won their games. To say she was not allowed to eat was just a reference to her eating too many snacks and being stopped. She wondered what she would think.

From beginning to end, Bao’er had not lied once. It made Tian Jing believe Bao’er was always tortured.
