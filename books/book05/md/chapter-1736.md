  Everyone was in shock. The xenogeneic officer was incredibly hard to deal with already, but now they had a real monster from the outside to contend with.

It wasn’t a low-tier xenogeneic like the ones Han Sen had already dealt with before, either. The sanctuary door led to the Big Silence system. It was where the high-level xenogeneics resided. There were high-tier xenogeneics there, very much like the Dukes. If they entered, there’d be a grand disaster, just like what had occurred to the crystallizers.

Han Sen knew those creatures were somewhat restricted when they were in the sanctuary, and their strength would be limited by the parameters of the place. They’d end up like Old Cat and get flushed away.

Old Cat was a Nine-Life Cat, and it had authority in the sanctuary. There was no need for his power to be suppressed in the sanctuary, but the xenogeneics coming in would.

But the problem was, a xenogeneic could probably get off a few attacks before it was kicked out of the sanctuary. If the xenogeneic was too strong, even those few attacks would be enough to level the entire Alliance.

The moment the xenogeneic came out, it opened its mouth in a roar. But no sound came out; instead, a scary power gathered in its mouth. It was ready to fire.

A black light was getting stronger around the creature. The power created a vortex, generating storms in a multitude of systems.

“It’s over!” Han Sen’s face changed. That xenogeneic was not a Baron or Viscount. It was probably a Marquis, or even a Duke. Regardless, Han Sen knew he could not fight an enemy such as that.

Skills were useless in front of such raw power. That was something that could destroy anything without question.

Stay Up Late’s face looked glum. Everyone thought the monster was way too scary, too, and that it looked indestructible.

“Fuck! I have to try.” Han Sen knew he could not fight it, but he couldn’t just sit around and wait for a wretched end, either. He suddenly turned into a three-meter-tall silver ape. The inscriptions across his geno armor all shone. A sort of power entered his right hand.

Han Sen used his strongest attack on the monster in the sky. He used his Super Spank power.

Xie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and Stay Up Late all used their own strongest attacks, too. They all attacked it together.

All those frightening powers smacked against the beast’s mouth. Han Sen didn’t expect that they would be able to kill it, but destroying the power inside the being’s mouth might be able to deal some decent damage. And releasing that much power might trigger the sanctuary to force the creature out.

This was the only way, and if they couldn’t make it work, they were all dead. No one could take that power and survive.

The overbearing swordlights and the high-tier holy lights and the shocking swordair all converged on the monster’s mouth. They didn’t do anything to the black light, though.

“It’s over!” Han Sen heart trembled, and he broke into a cold sweat.

The others felt hopeless, too. Just like the crystallizers, humanity was now facing an extinction event.

The monster’s mouth opened wider, and the black light whirled faster. The monster lowered its head, ready to spit it all out. Han Sen held onto Litteflower, as his brain repeatedly thought, “Nothing can stop this.”

Suddenly, though, a hand emerged from the shrinking black hole behind the monster. The hand grabbed the xenogeneic beast.

The hand did not look big, but the scary-looking beast shuddered when the hand landed on it. And then, all its blood and flesh started to fly apart. It formed a blood river, as the beast blew into pieces under the grasp of that one small hand.

Everyone was in shock, and extremely happy. They were delighted that the beast’s attack had been thwarted. They were shocked, wondering who the hand might have belonged to. The fact that it had just broken the monster so simply was terrifying.

If the hand’s master was hostile to the sanctuary, they were afraid humans would be wiped out completely.

But the sanctuary gate then shut, and the black hole was only small enough to show the hand. The body couldn’t come in.

Everyone looked at the hand, and then, a voice followed it out. “I did not expect to find someone like this in the sanctuary.

Not bad.”

Han Sen wondered what that might have meant. He saw the hand move, as an invisible power started to suck Littleflower in its direction.

“Littleflower!” Han Sen was shocked. He didn’t care about anything else at that moment, and with his ape body, he jumped at Littleflower. He wanted to stop Littleflower 什om being pulled away by the hand.

But the power was way too strong to deny. It pulled Han Sen into the hand, too.

The hand did not look big, but when they landed on it, they felt as small as ants on the center of its palm.

Before anyone did anything, the hand grabbed them both and pulled back through the black hole. The black hole disappeared then, too.

Ji Yanran almost fainted. Luo Lan and Han Yufei were extremely worried, but there was nothing they could do.

The sanctuary gate was shut, and they could not go out Even if it hadn’t closed, they couldn’t hope to go up against a single finger of that hand.

“Han Sen and Littleflower won’t be killed so simply.” Xie Qing King looked at the sky. “I never expected something so strong could be found here. I too need to get out.”

Everyone had a complicated expression on their faces. Gu Qingcheng approached Zero, though, and said, “Zero, how did you summon Han Sen here? Can you do it again?”

Zero shook her head. “It activated itself, and I can’t control it. I don’t know how to do it again.”

Gu Qingcheng did not respond. She merely lifted her sword Pure and slashed toward Zero’s head.

“What are you doing!?” Everyone was shocked.
