      The professional in the virtual community got stomped on. Everyone
      commented and asked for his opinion on how Dollar effortlessly broke the
      fifth opponent’s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your prediction was accurate, and Dollar really was given a lot of
      trouble—the blood must have taken ages to clean!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blowing up his head in less than a minute must have been really
      difficult”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is worrisome. It was such a big creature, think of all the meat! I
      don’t know if we should bake, grill, or boil it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course, we can actually prepare it in ten different ways. We can fry
      it, stir-fry it, steam it, roast it, deep-fry it, slow-cook it, put it in
      sauce, flamethrower it, nuke it, or just barbecue it”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The professional said Dollar wouldn’t get past the seventh round. This is
      great!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The professional didn’t respond, but after a while, he departed and left
      behind a single note. It said Dollar was guaranteed not to make it past
      the seventh round. It made everyone go crazy once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, all the beings were trying to find out what
      element Dollar was attuned with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sealing power hadn’t worked on him, and he seemed absolutely perfect
      in every way. He had no known flaw. It gave the others who wanted the
      title Son of God a headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many super elites investigated these events, but they could not find
      anything. But they were able to confirm that the pipe Han Sen used was the
      Blow Blood geno core from Drink Blood Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That confirmed the sealing power did not work on Dollar. Blow Blood geno
      core had been sealed, and over the years, none had been able to unseal it.
      Yet, when Dollar had it, he had somehow been able to do just that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now people were able to confirm that the Dollar geno core they had
      witnessed was actually the Dollar geno core on the leaderboard, and it
      belonged to Dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was talking about this, in fervent wonder about who might
      actually be able to stop Dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      People investigated Dollar’s list of battles painstakingly, and aside from
      Aqua Sun Beast, Dollar would go up against Jade Shura on the seventh
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Shura’s performance was outstanding. She hadn’t beaten beat Six Paths
      and Aqua Sun Beast like Han Sen had, but she was great nonetheless.
      Especially since she had Falsified-Sky powers. That was something many
      beings were flat-out afraid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a shame Godslayer Luo hadn’t decided to join in, but nobody dared
      to ask him to compete. Still, that meant the connection between him and
      Jade Shura would to remain a complete mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      People assumed she was the Queen of the Shura, a conclusion drawn from
      both her body shape and name. Still, people did not know why the queen
      possessed the Falsified-Sky powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because her identity made things mysterious, it heightened the allure of
      the seventh match. And all wished to find out which of the two would end
      up stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When calculating the odds from a simple power perspective, the results
      favored Dollar. But Falsified-Sky powers never missed. That power could
      very well kill Dollar in a second flat. Regardless, all the beings were
      extremely excited for the upcoming match.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beings that would later go up against the victor of the match paid
      extra attention to it, as well. It did not matter who won, as long as they
      could learn a thing or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the shura palace, a young shura lady stood next to the Shura Queen.
      If Han Sen saw who this woman was, he’d have been shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was because this shura lady looked just like Zero. She was obviously
      older than Zero, but she was practically the same in all other physical
      aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ming’er, you need to be careful tomorrow. That Dollar is… unusual.” The
      shura queen spoke to the young shura.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mother, do not worry. I will beat him. And I will rise to take first
      place. I will tell everyone that Jade Shura is the greatest of all
      creations.” Yu Ming’er spoke with absolute confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shura Queen laughed. She held her hands and said, “You cannot be
      careless. Our Falsified-Sky powers still possess flaws. Until we obtain
      the second half of the Falsified-Sky Sutra, it will never be perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know. But do not worry. The deal for the next ten years will result in
      me beating Luo Haitang, and then, I will obtain the second half of the
      Falsified-Sky Sutra,” Yu Ming’er said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shura Queen shook her head. She knew her daughter well, and she knew
      the girl wouldn’t listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Shura Queen wasn’t too worried. Yu Ming’er was the most talented
      person in Jade Shura to have learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra. She was so
      strong, and there was no need to be concerned with her safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if she was unable to win, she could still survive whatever came her
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, meanwhile, was investigating something he was holding. After
      killing Aqua Sun Beast, he didn’t get the beast soul. But he did obtain
      the dead body, geno core, and Life Geno Essence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life Geno Essences were now useless for him, and he gave the meat to
      Little Silver and the others. He brought the geno core with him, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      A green jade orb with a weird symbol of light. It contained a strong
      sealing power, that much was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If other people did not have a sealing power, they could not make use of
      the orb. And it was at times like this, the benefit of Han Sen’s
      collection of spirit geno points really showed. Han Sen did not possess
      the power of sealing, but with the sealing spirit geno points, he could
      simulate sealing powers to make use of the orb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orb was useful, and if monsters were touched by the sealing light,
      even a super-class Little Star would end up stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is good stuff.” Han Sen played around with the orb and came to like
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was called the God Orb, but it was not perfect. If Little Star was
      traveling, the God Orb would not be able to shine on him,for example. The
      sealing light could also be blocked by objects, such as shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, even if a shield was deflecting the sealing light, the shield
      itself would end up getting sealed. This applied to armor, as well. If the
      armor was sealed, your body would be locked in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took the God Orb and returned to Divinity’s Bout. The sixth enemy
      conceded, a move prompted by witnessing Aqua Sun Beast’s merciless
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen exited the background and waited for the seventh match. He was
      curious about the Jade Shura.
