<p>“Little Black, are you a Rebate? And your father is a King? How
can you not have Teeth Knife?” There was still a while to go before
the next knife rain came, so Han Sen tried to talk to Black
Steel.</p>
<p>Hearing Han Sen call him Little Black, his eye twitched. He held
back the urge to cut Han Sen down and simply closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“I know you must be the playful sort. I bet you like hitting on
girls or something, to have skipped the years that would have
allowed you to learn Teeth Knife.” Han Sen was curious. Teeth Knife
was so strong, so why was it that Rocks Fall Duke had learned it,
whereas Black Steel hadn’t?</p>
<p>Black Steel’s eyelids twitched. He stared at Han Sen and said,
“Do you think everyone is as lucky as you? Teeth Knife is a Rebate
skill, but not many people have the ability to practice it. Only
six people know it right now, and Queen is the only one that is
capable of mastering it I want to learn from her, but she does not
think I am capable of learning it.”</p>
<p>“You can go and find the other five,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Black Steel hummed and said, “I want to learn from the best If I
can’t learn it from her, I won’t accept it from anyone less. Queen
recommended that I learn another skill, anyway, so I don’t need
Teeth Knife.”</p>
<p>“What is the skill you are learning, then?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Black Steel coldly said, “Cut-Steel Knife.”</p>
<p>“That sounds powerful. Is that the skill you were using?” Han
Sen’s eyes opened wide. He was looking quite shocked.</p>
<p>Black Steel saw Han Sen was only pretending to be shocked, so he
could extract more information, and felt his own eyelids repeatedly
flicker with a twitch. He stood up and focused on getting to the
top of the mountain.</p>
<p>“Little Black, where are you going?” Han Sen asked as he
followed.</p>
<p>“I have a death wish. If you are afraid of dying, then I
recommend that you don’t come any further. When the grave erupts,
you’ll be slaughtered,” Black Steel said coldly. Then, he went
ahead to reach the peak.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe Black Steel was going to die, and he was
quite happy to have finally met someone with a fine temper. He
wasn’t going to let him go off quite so easily.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen followed him up to the peak. It was like a real
volcano there. When Han Sen looked down, it looked like a
meatgrinder beneath him, with a sea of knives all lying together.
They lined up like the layers of teeth within the maws of a
monster. It was a scary sight to see.</p>
<p>At the bottom, there was a red juice. It was lava, presumably.
The weapons appeared to be ticking out from the liquid.</p>
<p>“Little Black, can we find a weapon amidst those? The weapons
are all together, right? So, the good ones should be easier to
find.” Han Sen couldn’t take his eyes off the Knife Grave.</p>
<p>Black Steel coldly said, “If you aren’t afraid of dying, you can
certainly try.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought his life was more important. He wasn’t familiar
with this place, so it was best not to risk it all by trying to
venture in.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking about this, Black Steel was actually
climbing down already.</p>
<p>“Little Black, why are you going down?” Han Sen looked
surprised.</p>
<p>“I am not afraid of dying,” Black Steel said simply. He was
clutching a knife as he made his descent.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to follow. The knives were all crisscrossed, and
the places you could grab onto were just the blades. It was like
you were climbing a knife mountain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, those blades were fairly poor. They were like the
ones that had just fallen in the first rain. And since the dull
knives weren’t currently falling out of the sky, they weren’t
really dangerous.</p>
<p>“Little Black,” Han Sen said, just as he felt the blades start
to shake. The steel juice at the bottom was beginning to bubble and
boil. It looked ready to fly upwards.</p>
<p>Black Steel gave Han Sen a signal to be quiet He stayed silent,
and then the knives and the steel juice became calm.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to copy him and kept on climbing. It seemed like
Black Steel had brought him here just to get him to shut up.</p>
<p>The lower they got, the sharper the knives became. They were
surrounded by knives now, and if the knives started to move, Han
Sen and Black Steel would be turned into pincushions.</p>
<p>Even if the knives didn’t move, Han Sen could imagine the fate
that would await him if he slipped.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was not afraid, and neither was Black Steel. In
reality, he had nothing to be afraid of. He could always fly for a
short time, and here, that would be enough to get him to
safety.</p>
<p>And furthermore, he had the Taurus shield. There was no way that
the blades of a Baron could harm it. Then again, if Han Sen used
the shield, he wasn’t sure if the knives would still want him.</p>
<p>They climbed down quietly, getting closer and closer to the
steel juice. Black Steel had only decided to come here because Han
Sen had asked so many questions. The curiosity of wondering if
there were any knives being born also played a part.</p>
<p>But there had only been one rain, and the good knives wouldn’t
be revealed just yet. Han Sen wasn’t too hopeful.</p>
<p>When he looked at the seething steel juice, he saw a pitch-black
horse knife resting halfway within the liquid. The air was insanely
hot that close to the liquid steel, but the sight still gave Han
Sen the chills. Han Sen was thinking, “That’s a good knife.”</p>
<p>The knife was inside the steel juice. Han Sen tried reaching for
it, but he was short by two arm lengths.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare to move suddenly. If he shifted his weight too
much, it would undoubtedly make the knives move, and the grave
might even erupt at a faster pace. Even if their bodies were built
of steel, they would still be sliced and diced into dust.</p>
<p>Black Steel frowned. He thought the horse knife was a Viscount
class weapon. If he got it now, it would help him reach the seventh
round. It was difficult to find a weapon such as that before the
seventh rain. That knife might even carry him all the way to the
tenth round.</p>
<p>If he gave up now and waited until the eruption, the knife might
end up at a random location several hundred miles away. It’d be
hard to find it.</p>
<p>But there was no way he could reach it Just as Black Steel was
giving up, Han Sen came down next to him and got his attention,
then grabbed his arm.</p>
<p>Black Steel understood what he meant Han Sen wanted to lift him
and let him reach out for the knife.</p>
<p>“Little Black, are you a Rebate? And your father is a King? How
can you not have Teeth Knife?” There was still a while to go before
the next knife rain came, so Han Sen tried to talk to Black
