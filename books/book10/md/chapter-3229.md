  Exquisite sighed and said, “I have still been unsuccessful with Very High Forget Love.”

“Auntie Exquisite, do you know this man?” The Very High young man guard looked at Exquisite strangely.

“Of course, I recognize him,” Exquisite said as she looked at Han Sen. “I did not think there was anyone who would not recognize him.”

“After I came back, I have been witnessing many changes to this place,” Han Sen said with a smile. “This place is almost unrecognizable now. Exquisite, tell me, why are you in Space Garden?”

Seeing Han Sen smile, Exquisite smiled back. She replied, “Yes. In the past two years that you have been gone, many things have happened. The entire universe is not the same as it once was. Compared to Outer Sky, more people seek to practice in Space Garden instead. I am one such person.”

Exquisite was still holding onto something she did not want to outright admit. The reason she went to Space Garden was not that Space Garden was better than Outer Sky. It was because Han Sen was the one who built the place. Yu Wu Shuang and the guards were shocked when they saw Exquisite smile. Even the Very High student did not believe she had that in her.

People like Exquisite, who had already taken their Very High Sense to the max level and had Very High Forget Love, no longer had emotions. They were supposed to be cold all the time. No one had ever seen her behave like this before.

Yu Wu Shuang and the two guards felt very weird. They did not know who that man in front of them was. Whoever he was, he could make Exquisite display a joyful face.

While they were wondering about his identity, a gold shadow flashed out of the city. A gold lion-like, big beast jumped in front of Han Sen.

Yu Wu Shuang and the others were shocked. That gold shadow was not very big, but they knew how scary of a creature it was.

Empty Mountain’s Mountain Leader, the only golden growler in the universe, used to fight side-by-side with Dollar. Now, he was an invincible existence in Space Garden.

Even the Extreme King, Very High, and Sky Palace elites were terrified whenever they laid eyes on golden growler. But they were just some small people.

Golden growler usually occupied a deep, faraway mansion. He spent time with the Han family’s Ling’er. For some reason, he had just come running from outside to jump at the mysterious man. Yu Wu Shuang and the others were shocked.

Golden growler jumped at him. Even an elite of the universe would have been half-dead through simple fear. The guards thought the man was going to be instantly killed.

In the next second, their eyes opened wide. They could not believe what they were seeing.

Golden growler jumped onto the man and put one of its front paws on his shoulder. It started to lick the man in joy, swinging its tail madly. It was like a big dog trying to earn the love of its master.

“Who… Who is this man?” Yu Wu Shuang and the other two people were absolutely confused.

Golden growler showing up had already shocked the elites. Shortly after, an old man excitedly broke space to come and kneel before Han Sen. “Master, you are back.”

Yu Wu Shuang and the two guards felt as if their lives had suddenly been thrown into turmoil and challenge. That man, who called himself Nine Thousand King, had always been difficult. He was always very mean in Space Garden. Aside from Han Fei, Han Ling’er, and a few other Han family members, he had a total lack of respect for everyone.

One time when the Very High Leader visited, Nine Thousand King’s nose was stuck up in the sky. He was completely uncaring for the prestigious guest. It was like he could not be bothered dealing with such a person.

At one point, he was such a scary existence. Now, that man was kneeling profusely before Han Sen. It was hard to imagine.

“Old Nine, there is no need for all this.” Han Sen reached out his hand and lifted Nine Thousand King’s body.

“Master, you are back.” More and more scary creatures appeared. Flower God Leader was very excited.

Tang Zhenliu came running out with a hearty laugh. “Holy shit! Old Han, are you back this soon? We are still planning on breaking down the space barrier to come to fetch you.”

“Mister Dollar, you are back.” Finally, someone shouted Dollar’s name.

Upon hearing that, Yu Wu Shuang was stunned into submission. “Mister Dollar… He is Han Sen, the man who saved the world. He is the master of Space Garden. I thought he died. Can creatures really come back from

hell?”

The whole of Space Garden was bubbling like boiling water. The news spread all over the Very High. Some of the high races quickly received the news about the man who came back from hell.

“Good people do not live for long, and they harm for a thousand years. That is correct.” In the Extreme King, Bai Qin, who had already become king, looked into space and sighed.

“Finally, you are back.” In Blood Legion, Human King looked quiet. He looked as if he was thinking about something.

“How could he come back so quickly? Has he already beaten the system of reincarnation?” Amidst the Demons, the Demon Alpha frowned. She looked confused.

Hearing the news that Han Sen had come back from hell, every elite had a different reaction to the headline. Sky Palace Leader laughed three times and then quietly mumbled, “The bad news is bad.”

Han Sen heard from Tang Zhenliu and the others that Littleflower, Xie Qing King, and the others were already out near Outer Sky’s Mirror Lake. When he asked for details of what was going on there and heard what they had to say, he knew for sure something had changed there.

“Dad.” Ling’er was like a little cat when she jumped into Han Sen’s arms.

“My Little Ling’er, you have become more and more beautiful.” Han Sen collected Ling’er and kissed her on the cheek. He suddenly felt so successful about having a daughter.

“Han Sen, you are back.” Wang Yuhang had tears gushing from his eyes when he saw Han Sen. This was still in the time Ling’er had forced him to remain in Space Garden, which was something that made him feel absolutely wretched.

Seeing Han Sen return, he felt as if he was a farmer that had been suppressed but was now being rescued by the PLA.

“Little Uncle, why do you look so terrible?” Han Sen looked at Wang Yuhang with shock.

Wang Yuhang wanted to tell him what happened and how difficult things had been, but Ling’er was staring at him. He forced a smile and said, “I… I have not slept well recently.” The little red bird flew over too. It did somersaults around Han Sen as if it was searching for something.

“Bao’er could not come back yet,” Han Sen said to the little red bird.

The little red bird felt depressed. It landed atop Ling’er’s head.

Han Sen had no choice. The Sky King Crown only allowed him and him alone to return to the geno universe. On top of that, there was a time limit. He could not bring Bao’er back with him.

When they went to the garden, there were only creatures around who were very close to Han Sen. Tang Zhenliu asked, “Han Sen, how did you get back here from the other side? Is there a way you can get us to access there so we can go in and play?” “This time, I have come back to talk to you about that. If the others have gone to Outer Sky, though, we should go to Outer Sky first.” Han Sen used Galaxy Teleportation to teleport everyone to Outer Sky.

Han Yan and the others had already learned about Han Sen’s return, but they were still very excited to see the man in the flesh.

Han Sen invited Very High Leader and Sky Palace Leader over too. He told them about the God Chaos Party trying to break the 33 skies.

Very High Leader, Sky Palace Leader, and all the other elites did not look so good after hearing about it. According to what Han Sen was telling them, the elites of the universe of kingdoms were far stronger than the elites of the geno universe. If the 33 skies were punched through, bridging the geno universe, a disaster would surely unfold.
