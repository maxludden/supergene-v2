  After leveling up, Queen didn’t walk any further. She said, “My fitness isn’t good enough to proceed. I won’t bother trying to go any further, and I’ll simply wait for you guys here.”

Han Sen could see she was actually able to go forward a little bit more, but chose not to. Han Sen really admired her character, and he imagined Queen’s Heavenly Go must have been fiercer than ever by now.

After the tenth curtain of light, some creatures showed signs of leveling up. But it seemed the chances of them leveling up were low. The ratio was around one in twenty. The others, even if they reached a point where they could no longer go on, were unable to level up.

In order to level up at those stages, you had to be below gemstone class. Those possessing gemstone self geno cores could not have their geno cores ascend to super class.

After the twelfth curtain of light, most of the creatures and spirits stopped. And when they reached the thirteenth, even Yu Xuan had to stop. There was only Yu Miao from Outer Sky Shelter who could keep going.

Yu Miao looked at Han Sen and was shocked. She wasn’t surprised Han Sen could keep going, but the two creatures and the baby in his arms were also able to keep going. That was what surprised her the most.

The creatures that were able to go passed the thirteenth curtain of light were those that were the best of the gemstone tier. The fact that Han Sen’s creatures could keep going was rather shocking to Yu Miao.

Little Lion King was showing even more shock than her. He was able to reach this point because the way creatures leveled up was different than how humans did so.

When the geno cores of humans leveled up, it was dependent on their skills. But that ascension did not greatly affect their bodies. If humans wished to level up their bodies, they had to absorb the genes of creatures.

The way creatures leveled up was different from this, as their geno core and physical strength were both tied to the same scale. When their geno core leveled up, their fitness would go along with it.

So, when creatures leveled up to a gemstone class fitness, that was that. There was no need for them to focus on ways that might increase their body specifically.

Little Lion King’s genes were strong, and his geno core kept rising. He had come from silver to gemstone class, and through this, his body had developed as well. This was different than Queen and Tang Zhenliu. When their geno cores leveled up, their fitness didn’t go with it. This meant they couldn’t go any further.

Little Lion King was satisfied with his current performance, but seeing Little Silver and Starsea Beast travel all that way without breaking a sweat, he thought to himself, “Han Sen is scary. Even his creatures are this good. I don’t know if they can reach the fourteenth, but if they can, they are undoubtedly the greatest heirs of super creatures.”

Han Sen didn’t know this was what Yu Miao and Little Lion King were thinking about. Thus far, he just thought it was strange that Tang Zhenliu and Queen had both leveled up, and he hadn’t yet.

Han Sen had four self geno cores. Three of them were silver, and one of them was gold. Leveling them up should have been easy, but he had reached this point and hadn’t heard a peep out of any of them.

Now, there was only Yu Miao, Little Lion King, Six Paths, and Han Sen left. They were all deep in their own thoughts, with not a single one of them saying a word.

After the fourteenth curtain of light, everyone’s speed slowed down drastically.

The elites there were gemstone class. Through the fourteenth light and onwards, gemstone geno cores could become super.

Yu Miao’s purpose for being here started now, but when she looked at the creatures around Han Sen, she saw they were all able to be there just fine. She was given another shock. “Are the creatures all around him heirs of super creatures? How can they reach this point with such ease?”

Little Lion King confirmed Han Sen was powerful through this, too. If he wasn’t, there was no way he could possess so many scary pet creatures.

Han Sen was not surprised, though. Little Silver had eaten a lot of Lifedrops and his potential was high. He wouldn’t be any weaker than a super creature.

Han Sen was surprised Starsea Beast was able to come all this way, though.

When Han Sen saw Starsea Beast’s body, though, his geno core was only gemstone class. Han Sen thought it was just a sacred-blood creature, but it didn’t seem that way anymore.

The way Starsea Beast could travel through objects was unique, and it was definitely something ordinary scared-blood creatures couldn’t do. Now that he had walked up to this point with ease, it meant he was extremely talented. Leveling up had to be within the beast’s reach.

“Weird. Why was the parent of Starsea Beast only a gemstone class? Was it not little Starsea Beast’s actual parent?” Han Sen guessed.

Starsea Beast wasn’t exerting much strength, but he was still able to keep going. Han Sen was impressed.

Little Silver was sitting upon its head. He hadn’t walked a single step.

But the pressure permeated every corner of the tunnel, so it would have still affected Little Silver. But he appeared unmoved and unchallenged. He wasn’t tired at all, and it made the fox look even more powerful.

Yu Miao wished to fight Han Sen, but the further she went, the harder it would be. She felt as if she wasn’t half as good as Han Sen’s creatures.

When they approached the fifteenth curtain of light, Yu Miao was having difficulty taking every next step. She ground her teeth and kept going, though.

When Yu Miao hit the last bath of light, her body glowed white. Her geno core had managed to level up.

Yu Miao was exuberantly happy now, and she thought to herself, “I should thank Han Sen for giving me the correct motivation. If I was alone, I don’t think I would have reached this far and managed to level up.”

Han Sen looked at Yu Miao. He knew she had now reached super because she was gemstone previously.

Little Lion King felt depressed. After leveling up twice, his body was not showing further changes. He hit the fifteenth light but failed to level up again, and now it felt as if he couldn’t take one more step.

“Now I’m super class, so my power will be the top. I think I’m going to win. Except maybe for Six Paths, I will definitely be walking the furthest,” Yu Miao thought to herself.

Little Silver and Little Star managed to go through the fifteenth light, but they didn’t level up either.
