Boom!

A black smoke burst from Han Sen's body like fire. It instantly incinerated the icy threads that had trapped him. The Flaming Rex Spike in his hand was swung madly towards the remainder, burning more threads into steamy bygones.

"Silver fox, this way!" Han Sen shouted at the silver fox, and it quickly returned to his shoulders. Without delay, Han Sen got back to swinging his rex spike with ferocity at the icy threads. He ran in front of the frozen man and quickly grabbed something out of his pocket. He turned, knocked out more of the threads, and hastily retreated in the direction of the bamboo forest.

The threads still coursed after Han Sen, and regardless of how many he destroyed, more and more were generated by the icy lake. They were endless.

The blazing fire of the Flaming Rex Spike was the perfect countermeasure to obliterating those he could strike down. And fortunately, the Devil Unicorn beast soul was able to withstand the threads he could not react to in time. Without too much trouble, he was able to keep them at bay as he advanced towards the forest.

Once he was inside the bamboo forest, the threads no longer followed, and the stringy, frosty hairs returned to the lake.

"It's lucky I had the Devil Unicorn beast soul. Who knows what might have happened, had I not. Even if I summoned the little angel, I am unsure whether or not she could withstand those things." Han Sen pondered what he had just encountered, as he had no idea what the living ice threads were.

Han Sen looked out towards the lake for a while but nothing seemed disturbed. Then, he lowered his head to take a look at what he was clutching in his hands.

Han Sen had taken a wallet out of the man's pockets, and it had many cards inside. They looked very old, too. They were much bigger than modern cards, and thicker. They weren't as light as the current cards were, where a hundred of them could be folded together and still be really thin.

There were thirty of the cards, and their thickness and number filled up the entire wallet.

"It looks like that man really was over a hundred years old. It's possible that he spawned in a shelter somewhere in the Black Desert, stumbled into this place as I have, and fell prey to the icy threads." Han Sen observed the cards and contemplated the identity and possible story of the frozen man he had found.

They were old cards, and aside from some cards that belonged to a few interstellar banking firms, Han Sen had no idea what the majority of them were for.

Suddenly, Han Sen's pupils went smaller. He found a card which bore a familiar symbol.

"Nine-Life Cat." Han Sen was shocked, not expecting to see this symbol here. That meant this man who had died near the lake may have been a member of their organization.

"It looks like that organization has been around for a long time. Does it really have a connection with Blood Legion?" Han Sen continued to examine the rest of the cards.

Then, Han Sen's eyes stretched wide.

Within the cards was a working license, and on the front was something he saw clearly.

"Secret Service, Team #7. Investigator: Qin Huaizhen"

This working license was the exact same as a relic Han Sen once received after someone died. The only difference being the name.

"Qin Huaizhen... could he be from the Qin family?" Han Sen remembered Qin Xuan once told him she had an elder who worked in the secret service's seventh team.

Han Sen gave a strange look to the man who was sitting near the lake. If he was a member of the Qin family, what may have led him to die all the way out here?

"Wait a minute... is he really dead? He still has a powerful lifeforce swirling inside him. It's not something you can fake, so, is he really dead?" Han Sen looked hopeful while staring at the man.

Han Sen wanted to know what might have happened to the seventh team. If that man really was an elder of the Qin family, and he was still alive, Han Sen was keen to finally learn the truth.

With great interest, Han Sen turned his whole body towards the man on the lake. There was a big chance he was still alive, and cryogenic technology had matured quite a bit even back then. Many people went into cryogenic sleep to be defrosted and awoken sometime in the future. It wasn't a difficult process.

But it required modern technology. Straight-up freezing yourself dealt tremendous damage to the body, and simple defrosting rarely led to survival.

Han Sen did not know if the man could survive after being defrosted. There were no tools readily available for him, and he'd have to bring him back to the Alliance if he wanted to guarantee his survival.

Han Sen thought it over quite a bit, but then settled on returning to the lake. He really wanted to know what had happened to the seventh team, and it looked as if this might be his best and only chance. After all, almost all members of the seventh team had died. Finding one of them who was half-alive was too good of an opportunity to let pass by.

Han Sen emerged from the bamboo forest again, and he was greeted with the sudden reappearance of the icy threads. But to Han Sen, who owned three super creatures, they could do little to stop him.

Han Sen annihilated the threads and arrived at the shore of the lake without trouble. As he went to pick up the man, he suddenly heard the sound of an explosion from the waters of the lake. Amidst the soaking turmoil and tossed water, a jellyfish-like creature arose from the waters.

Under its control, the water of the lake threaded once more and viciously went after Han Sen. In addition to the icy threads, the jellyfish's tentacles now also joined the fray.

With the Flaming Rex Spike and Devil Unicorn, Han Sen was able to withstand and repel the icy threads well enough, but his movement was restricted quite a bit. After slashing a number of threads, however, a crystal tentacle writhed its way around Han Sen to ensnare him.

Han Sen felt his waist drop in temperature as a strong power began to grow and pull him towards the lake.

Han Sen was infuriated, so he raised the rex spike to bring it down on the tentacle. But before he could strike, another tentacle grabbed ahold of his arm.

The silver fox was spitting its bolts of lightning in a raging fury, doing its best to break the grip of the tentacles. But soon after, it too was grabbed. Another tentacle wrapped it up and began dragging it towards the water with its master.

The silver fox's body unleashed as much silver lightning as it could, but still, it wasn't enough to break the hold the tentacle had on it.

"Little angel!" Han Sen, unable to fight back, summoned his adiraid.

The little angel appeared from the sky, swooped down, and with her greatsword, sliced the tentacles that had grabbed ahold of the duo. The jellyfish creature thrashed around in pain, letting out a shrill shriek amidst the chaos.

"Little angel, great work! Go and kill that asshole." Han Sen was extremely happy, and gleefully issued the little angel the order. Then, he swung his rex spike towards the icy threads that had amassed and were coming towards him like a tidal wave.

The little angel's cold face was like that of a goddess. Her blonde, flowing hair danced around as her body broke the air with her attacks. The greatsword slashed countless icy threads, as if she was tearing the seas asunder to get at the jellyfish-like creature.
