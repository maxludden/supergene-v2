To say it was just a small white rat was not right though. Although it was white, it was quite long. It was more like a small weasel.

Han Sen would not be surprised by whatever the creature was. What really surprised Han Sen was that when the little rascal stole his meat to eat, its body possessed wind power. If it did not, it could not have lunged as far as it did.

“But this is Dust Sky. How can there be a creature here that is using wind power to fly?” Han Sen could not think of why this was, but he knew it was pretty freaky.

According to theory, aside from Bury Path God, who was the leader of Dust Sky, no other creature should have been able to use their powers there. Yet, that small white rat was able to.

“Is the power of that small white rat strong enough to break the rules of Dust Sky?” Han Sen could not find out the answer.

Han Sen brought over the rest of the bird meat to cook. Every time he cooked it, Han Sen would turn around and scan the area for a while. Whenever he turned back to see the meat, it would be gone.

The small white rat’s appetite was impressive. It ate all the Gold Wing Big Bird until there was not a morsel left.

Han Sen was not able to eat any of the meat, but he was not angered by that. He was actually quite interested in the situation. That small white rat might have been an opportunity for him to leave Dust Sky.

Han Sen put out the fire, stood up, and left. He wanted to collect more Break World genes before Bury Path God found him. That would be useful for him.

Dust Sky was a very dangerous place, but it was also one of opportunity. The Break World beasts there had been weakened. They would be easy enough to kill.

After walking a dozen miles, Han Sen came across another Break World beast. It was a golem. It was snow-white like jade. Two of its teeth appeared to have been made from silver.

Han Sen did not have to use much strength. In 10 minutes, it was able to break its head.

“Killed Break World beast: White golem. Found Break World gene.”

Han Sen was able to find another snazzy Break World gene, which he quickly threw into his gob. Unfortunately, it only yielded him an extra two Break World genes. It was unknown if the Break World rate of the creature was too low or what.

Han Sen did not continue looking for Break World beasts. He put the golem down and started cooking its nose. It was very delicious.

Han Sen turned around. He noticed the cooked nose was gone.

“That guy followed me after all,” Han Sen thought. He grabbed a few more slices of meat to cook. The results were the same each time. Every time Han Sen turned around, the cooked meat would be gone.

He did not know how the small little rat’s small body was able to eat that much meat.

The golem weighed a few tons, so Han Sen only ended up cooking half of it. Yet, the little rat was able to eat everything Han Sen put more on the fire. Han Sen did not stop cooking until there was only a small part of it left. He decided to move on.

After Han Sen was gone for a while, he came back. He discovered the meat that had been left over was still where he left it. It had not been eaten.

Han Sen thought, “That guy is weird. It does not eat raw meat.”

If that thing did not eat raw meat, there were only two possibilities. It was perhaps a pet owned by others, and that was why it ate cooked meat. A small white rat was not going to cook something for itself.

Of course, the small white rat might have been used to eating raw meat, but Han Sen may have given it a picky mouth. Perhaps that was why it no longer ate raw meat.

Han Sen thought, “If it is the first possibility, that is the right one. In Dust Sky, the only person who can have a pet like that would be Bury Path God.”

He did not stop for long. Han Sen got up and went out to find more Break World beasts. After he found a Break World beast, killed it, cooked as much of it as he could, the small white rat ate all the meat.

After a while, the small white rat did not seem to be afraid. It eventually revealed itself at a distance that was rather close to Han Sen. Every time Han Sen cooked meat, it stared at the food from afar.

When the meat was done, before Han Sen turned around, it came up to eat it. It was like a storm. It was so fast that it was rather unbelievable.

No matter how it ate, its belly did not get bloated. It was like there was a bottomless hole in its tummy.

After eating, the small white rat flew far away. It looked at Han Sen from afar and did not get close to him.

“White-eyed wolf… No… White-eyed rat…” Han Sen was a bit peeved. He wanted to use the power of the small white rat, but the small white rat had eaten seven or eight Break World beasts by this point. Even still, the small white rat did not trust him.

“I should just take it slow.” Han Sen had nothing else to do, so he kept looking for more Break World beasts to kill. He also kept trying to communicate with the small white rat in the hopes it would eventually put its guard down and keep it that way.

Although he had been unable to attract the full confidence of the small white rat, Han Sen’s Break World genes were able to increase by a lot. He had 43 Break World genes. If there were enough Break World beasts for him to kill, perhaps in another 10 days or half a month, his Break World gene tally would be maxed out.

The Break World beasts were not so easy to find. Han Sen was running for half the day, yet he was still unable to find a Break World beast. He did see many ordinary creatures. Han Sen was not interested in the ordinary creatures, so he just kept on walking.

When he went to a little river, Han Sen had a sip of water. Before long, he heard footsteps. He raised his head and saw a familiar face.

“It is you!” The two of them spoke it in tandem. They looked alert and ready to fight.

On the bank of the river, a man was walking down. He was wearing black clothes. He looked very gentle. He looked as if he was very common, but Han Sen knew that there was a scary heart lurking in this commonness

Han Sen looked at the man in front of him and asked, “Ancient Devil, why are you here?”

“Why are you here?” Ancient Devil smiled at Han Sen. He did not retreat like he did last time.

Han Sen’s brain went through countless thoughts. “Did Ancient Devil randomly show up in Dust Sky? Can something like that really happen? After all, he has only just been able to break the world. He does not seem to be able to use the powers from the 33 skies… Wait… The 33 skies are vast. Why did Bury Path God become the leader of Dust Sky while Ancient Devil landed here too?
