    <p>
      Han Sen took the opportunity to run out of the nest. He could still
      vaguely hear the roaring of the raging silver gargoyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The physique of the silver gargoyle was so good that Han Sen could not
      kill it at the moment. However, since he had already learned that there
      was a sacred-blood creature in this place, he could always come back when
      he had enough geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, you are here! Are you okay?&#8221; Zhu Ting was waiting at
      the entrance, looking down from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Luckily, I ran out, but I could not kill that thing,&#8221; Han Sen
      said and started to walk away.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How about me joining Goddess Gang?&#8221; Zhu Ting came up to Han
      Sen and asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you want to, I’ll permit it,&#8221; Han Sen said casually. He
      would keep Zhu Ting around for the moment because he was still thinking
      about Seven Twists of the Chens.
    </p>

    <p>
      After leaving the nest, Han Sen went back to the Alliance and urged Zhu
      Ting to get the geno solutions as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was almost time for Zero to return to the God’s sanctuary, so Han Sen
      thought it was time to conquer the spirit shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, he would like for everyone of Goddess Gang to join the war
      against the spirit shelter. Otherwise, if he went himself, the gang
      members would not appreciate the gains they did not fight for that much.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen was going to make sure he will get the spirit stone in
      the shelter. He did not care about anything else that much.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen returned to Daphne, he finished his own task and looked at
      his future schedule.
    </p>

    <p>In two days, he would join the cooking team to prepare food.</p>

    <p>
      Soldiers could only have food for five days out of a month. Normally, they
      would just take nutrition solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the expert panel was different. They ate every day, so the
      existence of the cookhouse was mainly meant for the expert panel.
    </p>

    <p>
      After resting for two days, reading and training, it was Han Sen’s turn to
      work. Han Sen finally understood that the work of the cookhouse was
      difficult sometimes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those experts and scholars were very picky about what they ate. According
      to the rules, each of them shall have three dishes and one soup per meal,
      and there must be meat.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, several professors in the expert panel could even order their
      own food, which was a privilege that even Ji Yanran and Chen Shoushan did
      not enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of the emphasis the Alliance had placed on Crystallizer ruins,
      these experts and professors enjoyed very high status. Among them, several
      professors were indeed quite knowledgeable about Crystallizer
      civilization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not a great cook, so all he could do was to prepare the raw
      materials and transfer the food to the plates.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You must be the new cookhouse recruit Han Sen? I heard you passed
      Sprint at level 10?&#8221; A young researcher of the expert panel asked
      Han Sen while he was getting his food.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It was because I have seen it before. It’s no big deal,&#8221; Han
      Sen said casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You graduated from Blackhawk?&#8221; The young researcher asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Han Sen slightly frowned and replied. He glanced at the
      young researcher who was about thirty years old and quite good-looking.
      His lips were thin, which gave him a feminine look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not bad. When I was in Alliance Central Military Academy, Blackhawk
      -ranked about one hundred. I wonder how it’s doing now?&#8221; The young
      researcher said quietly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt the guy’s tone was a bit off, squinted and said, &#8220;I’m
      not sure. I did not have many opportunities to see people from Alliance
      Central Military Academy. I was in an archery tournament against that
      school though.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, did you come out of it okay?&#8221; The young researcher said
      contentedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking of tournaments, Alliance Central Military Academy was always the
      top-notch school. Almost in every single item, the school would get at
      least top three, while Blackhawk was not that impressive among the famous
      academies. The two could not even be compared. Naturally, the young
      researcher felt Blackhawk would lose tragically.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It was okay. Alliance Central Military Academy was quite
      impressive, so it took me some effort to get rid of them and gain the
      championship,&#8221; Han Sen said casually. He did not want to be nice to
      people like this.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha ha, if you want to brag, there is still a limit. In what kind of
      tournament can Blackhawk beat Alliance Central Military Academy? Is it a
      bragging contest?&#8221; The reply of the researcher made everyone in the
      expert panel laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
      These researchers mainly came from Alliance Central Military Academy,
      because there were not many academies that had the major of Crystallizer
      ruins research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the professors that focused on Crystallizer culture taught at
      Alliance Central Military Academy, so the experts and professors in the
      expert panel were also mostly affiliated to Alliance Central Military
      Academy.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the graduates of the best military school in the Alliance, they were of
      course arrogant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several researchers from the expert panel had also tried Sprint, but none
      of them passed level X. They all felt quite content when hearing a
      cookhouse soldier passed level X, because they knew Han Sen was familiar
      with the system. There was no way Han Sen was as strong as them.
    </p>

    <p>
      This researcher named Tang Xin was very pissed about this, which was why
      he provoked Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I’m so sorry. I have no idea Alliance Central Military Academy is
      such a big deal. Unfortunately, I have already graduated and could no
      longer participate in the games. Otherwise, I would be easier on them and
      make them look better,&#8221; Han Sen shrugged and said with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen said that, many researchers looked to him. Even several
      professors couldn’t help glancing at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, so you say you beat Alliance Central Military Academy. So,
      tell me, where and when did you do that?&#8221; Tang Xin snorted and said,
      because he did not believe Han Sen at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don’t remember which game, since it’s such a trivial matter for
      me. You could go search my name, and you will probably see it.&#8221; Han
      Sen knocked the spatula on the edge of the plate. &#8220;If you don’t have
      anything else to say, please give way to others. They have to eat as
      well.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Xin was a bit upset. He had always been very proud of the fact that
      he graduated from Alliance Central Military Academy. Han Sen’s treating
      his alma mater lightly irritated him.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, on this warship he could not do anything out of the line. Tang
      Xin gritted his teeth and walked to Professor Li Mingtang, pleading,
      &#8220;Professor, could you look it up for me to see if he was telling the
      truth.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      On Daphne, ordinary people did not have the access to the Skynet. All they
      had was an internal database, which was why Tang Xin asked Professor Li
      Mingtang to look it up for him.
