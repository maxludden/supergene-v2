	<h3>Chapter 2013</h3>

	<p>Angia and his companions had come to Sky Palace because they had to. The rest of the Feather race was depending
		on them to make friends with the Sky.</p>

	<p>They wanted to quickly integrate with the population of Sky Palace so they could be considered natural members.
		When they came there, they brought a lot of treasures to hand out. Blood Feather Knife was one of them.</p>

	<p>But it wasn’t as simple as handing out gifts to the first Sky they met. They weren’t entirely sure how the greedy
		elders of Sky Palace would react when they made their treasures available. And if the Feathers’ goods were
		simply taken from them, it would do little to grow their relationship with the Sky.</p>

	<p>Angia only made the offer to the crowd because Han Sen hadn’t come to the knife event. When he put the Blood
		Feather Knife on display, he had no plan to receive it back.</p>

	<p>Of the Sky students attending the knife event, one of them was the third elder’s son. He was an Earl called Wind
		Nineteen. The third elder used knives, and so his son used knives, too.</p>

	<p>The third elder was in charge of interacting with the Feathers, so the Feathers planned to give the Blood Feather
		Knife to him.</p>

	<p>If they simply handed it to the third elder, though, it might not make much of an impression. He was an elder,
		and it was fair to say he had no lack of King class weapons already. But if Wind Nineteen could win the knife in
		this knife event, it’d make everyone look good. When he received the knife as a prize, it would be far more
		memorable.</p>

	<p>Angia couldn’t just give the knife to Wind Nineteen, but if Wind Nineteen believed he used his own strength to
		win the knife, then the Feathers wouldn’t curry any favor. It had taken a little while for the Feathers to
		devise a plan.</p>

	<p>Angia had to win a few rounds before losing to him. That way, Wind Nineteen would know that he was receiving a
		gift meant for him.</p>

	<p>“Angia, are you serious?” asked a strong man with a cow’s head, his eyes wide.</p>

	<p>Angia smiled and said, “Of course. If any of you can beat me, then you can claim the Blood Feather Knife for
		yourself. That includes you, Brother Cow.”</p>

	<p>“Good! Then what are we waiting for? I am the best when it comes to knives. How about we compare our
		knifeskills?” the cow-head man said, standing up.</p>

	<p>“Yes, please.” Angia smiled and gestured towards the arena.</p>

	<p>The cow-head man was strong, and he was one of the outsider students. He was good with knives and fairly well-
		known amongst the other students. He was also known for being quite grumpy.</p>

	<p>His name was Strong Cow. He was one of the students Angia hired to use knives against him. That way, before Angia
		fought Wind Nineteen, he could show-off his own powers.</p>

	<p>Angia did not mind losing and giving out a gift, but he wanted to become very famous in the process.</p>

	<p>Everyone watched Angia and Strong Cow move to the arena, and they observed the match.</p>

	<p>Strong Cow was over three meters tall, and he was holding a giant horse knife. It was even taller than he was. It
		looked very scary.</p>

	<p>“I am going to begin,” Strong Cow said simply, then slashed towards Angia.</p>

	<p>The giant horse knife was associated with the element of thunder. The knife light was like lighting. It became a
		cowshaped bolt when it came for Angia.</p>

	<p>The thunder-cow roared as it approached, and this was a fine display of Strong Cow’s greatest skill. It was very
		strong, and the elites of the same level would not dare try to block such an attack.</p>

	<p>Everyone now looked at Angia, curious to see how he might react.</p>

	<p>Angia’s white wings were still folded on his back. He was obviously not planning to evade. He was holding a
		common, Earl class jade knife. It was made from Xuan Jade Spirits, so it was nothing particularly special.</p>

	<p>As the thunder cow’s knifelight flashed towards Angia, the power looked as if it could break a mountain.</p>

	<p>Angia smiled. He moved his jade knife and slashed towards Strong Cow’s thunder cow knifelight. The jade knife was
		shining gold. It was like a light from heaven.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>The thunder cow knifelight was cut in half by Angia’s golden light. The gold light did not stop, and it hit the
		horse knife and broke it in half.</p>

	<p>Strong Cow retreated. The gold light was a mere three inches in front of him when it disappeared.</p>

	<p>Everyone was shocked by the display. They could immediately tell that Angia had held back some of his power, too.
		If he had wanted to, the gold light would have cut right through the cow’s face.</p>

	<p>Strong Cow was not a very talented elite, but he was still considered one of the strongest Earls. Thunder Cow
		Roar was powerful, but Angia had just beaten it without issue. Clearly, Angia was a top rank Earl.</p>

	<p>The Feather’s Judgment Knife is special. It is a very strong geno art, and it is said that it can cut through
		anything. I have never seen it before today, though.” Thousand Feather Crane explained what they had just seen
		to Yun Sushang.</p>

	<p>“Brother Crane, do you think you can win?” Yun Sushang frowned.</p>

	<p>“I don’t know. But I’m not good with knives, and that is what they are comparing. So, it is pointless for me to
		participate.” Thousand Feather Crane shook his head.</p>

	<p>Strong Cow lost. The other students hesitated to try. Angia had fought a few bouts before today, but he had never
		proven himself to be that strong before.</p>

	<p>A student who was good at Yin knifeskills wanted to try. He didn’t lose in such a dramatic fashion as Strong Cow,
		but everyone could tell he had been suppressed by Angia.</p>

	<p>No one was able to beat him over the next few rounds of battle. People started to look at Angia differently.</p>

	<p>Not many people in Sky Palace used knives or practiced knifeskills. The few fighters Angia had just defeated
		weren’t really the best Earls. But even so, the fact that Angia kept winning was more than enough to prove his
		power.</p>

	<p>No one dared challenge him, and that included Wind Nineteen.</p>

	<p>Angia knew that Wind Nineteen did not think he could win, so he didn’t do anything about it. He simply went back
		to the stage and said, “Sky Palace has been home to a high race since ancient times. The genes and geno arts
		here greatly surpass those of the Feathers. I have come here in the hopes of learning, and now I have. I am so
		happy.”</p>

	<p>“I have heard Han Sen and Wind Nineteen are the best Earls when it comes to knifeskills. That being said, it
		seems that Brother Han is either busy or is choosing to avoid me. That is very disappointing. Fortunately,
		Brother Wind is here. Do you think you could teach me?” Angia spoke quite politely, but everyone knew he was
		just taking digs at Han Sen. He was suggesting Han Sen was too scared to fight him.</p>

	<p>Angia didn’t say it directly, but Yun Suyi thought this reflected poorly on Han Sen. She felt angry, hearing him
		speak that way.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen didn’t come, but I have learned knifeskills from him! I will fight on his behalf, and I will satisfy
		your desire by proxy.” Yun Suyi, dressed in her white garb, marched straight down to the arena.</p>
