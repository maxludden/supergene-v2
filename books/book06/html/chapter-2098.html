<h2>Invincible Bai Sema</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2098</h3>

<p>The red light tore through the clouds in the sky. It was like a
volcano, erupting without any restraint or signs of ceasing.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace’s future deified elites are now gone. What a shame.”
Kahn looked at the red light in the sky, and then he sighed like it
was something genuinely pitiable.</p>
<p>“But that is how the world should be. Many geniuses die and
become nothing more than dust. The ones that can become deified
aren’t always the strongest; they are the best at surviving. It is
a shame your lives are so short.” Kahn blinked. He looked at the
red light that was about to fade.</p>
<p>The rest of the Night Ghosts fell, then. They had lost too much
blood. They looked shaky, and their strength had left them.</p>
<p>Ten thousand Night Ghosts had heeded Sleepless Duke’s call, but
only four or five thousand were left alive. They were all low on
blood, though, and so they were all much weaker.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke stared at the Blood Demon Spear in her hands,
noting how ordinary the weapon looked after being discharged. She
looked over the remaining Night Ghosts. It would be very difficult
to break through Sky Palace’s defenses and join the Demons now.</p>
<p>“What follows, at least this nightmare is over.” Sleepless Duke
sighed. But just as she was going to return the spear to Kahn, she
froze. Her eyes opened wide, and her body stiffened. She stared up
into the sky.</p>
<p>When the red afterglow of the attack disappeared completely,
Sleepless Duke saw a blue light in the air. It was the same
translucent blue shield.</p>
<p>Despite being struck with the Blood Demon Spear, the blue shield
hadn’t broken. Its surface was still clean, and it didn’t look like
it had been dealt a single speck of damage.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Lone Bamboo, and the man were still inside the shield,
too, looking totally uninjured. They sat comfortably, with clothes
and hair still tidy.</p>
<p>“Impossible…” Kahn’s eyes opened wide in shock as he stared at
the blue shield. He could not believe what his eyes were telling
him.</p>
<p>The Blood Demon Spear was a King class weapon, yet it had failed
to break through a Marquise’s shield. It did not make sense to him.
Even if the shield was a King class or deified weapon, Han Sen’s
limited power should have kept him from using all of its
strength.</p>
<p>It was the same as Sleepless Duke using the Blood Demon Spear;
she had paid an enormous price for her weaker body to cast a King
class power. But Han Sen’s shield had held that power the entire
time, without any sign of strain or sacrifice. It blocked the Blood
Demon Spear without any cost of energy.</p>
<p>This was against how xenogeneic weaponry worked. Even defied
treasures shouldn’t possess power like that.</p>
<p>Kahn had no way of knowing that Han Sen wasn’t using a
xenogeneic treasure, of course. Han Sen was using a beast soul.
They were items that no other being in the geno universe could use.
They were different things entirely.</p>
<p>“It looks like we don’t have to leave now.” Han Sen released the
demon bug’s bai sema. He pulled out Ghost Teeth Knife and flew back
down to Planet Night Ghost on his wings.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo put his jade sword away. His fingers were like
swords now, and they created sword airs. He followed Han Sen back
down.</p>
<p>The Blood Demon Spear’s strike had exhausted all the power the
Night Ghosts had possessed. There was no need for them to run away
now.</p>
<p>When they saw Han Sen and Lone Bamboo coming for Sleepless Duke,
the Night Ghosts wished to stop them. But they had all bled too
much, and their powers had decreased. Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were
like a pair of tigers leaping into a flock of sheep.</p>
<p>The dark purple knife air tore the weakened Night Ghost bodies
apart with Teeth powers.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Night Ghost: xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Night Ghost: xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Night Ghost: xenogeneic gene found.
Obtained Night Ghost beast soul.”</p>
<p>The bodies of the Night Ghosts were sliced to pieces by the
Ghost Teeth Knife. The killing announcements played over and over
in Han Sen’s head as he killed scores of Night Ghosts.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo’s ten fingers were like swords of their own. The
swordlights swept down like a net, slaying every Night Ghost in
front of him.</p>
<p>“Oh no!” Sleepless Duke felt dizzy, and she almost fainted. She
had sacrificed so much for naught, having failed to hurt Han Sen
and Lone Bamboo in the slightest. The Night Ghosts were done
for.</p>
<p>She screamed, and with a mind that had no fear of death, she ran
for Han Sen.</p>
<p>You can handle this.” Han Sen flapped his wings and teleported
past Sleepless Duke. He was going for Kahn, who was in the midst of
making his escape.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke wanted to kill them all, but it was still the
Demon that were behind all this. Han Sen wouldn’t let him get off
scot-free.</p>
<p>Kahn saw Han Sen pursuing him, and while he was fast, he wasn’t
as fast as Han Sen. There was no Marquise alive that was faster
than Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you still have a long way to go. You may have won this
time, but you won’t be so lucky when next we meet,” Kahn promised,
then pulled out a metal box. He threw it ahead of himself.</p>
<p>The metal box was some sort of machine. There were cogwheels
spinning inside it. It became a metal peacock near Kahn’s feet.</p>
<p>“Go!” Kahn commanded the metal peacock. It spread its wings, and
its tail gleamed with green light. It flew away with the speed of a
rocket, and the distance between Kahn and Han Sen quickly
widened.</p>
<p>“Running away won’t be that easy.” Han Sen patted Bao’er, and
Bao’er knew exactly what to do. She picked up her gourd and
summoned the red cloud.</p>
<p>“Red cloud, if you wish to live well, then chase this man. If
you don’t, I’ll lock you up for five hundred years,” Han Sen said,
stepping onto the red cloud with Bao’er.</p>
<p>The red cloud shuddered, but then, the back of the red cloud
released a mist of sorts. It flew off into the sky after Kahn and
the metal bird.</p>
<p>Kahn rode the metal peacock through space, feeling absolutely
terrible. He hadn’t been injured, but the plan with the Night
Ghosts had utterly failed. He would be crushed by his rivals inside
Demon.</p>
<p>He thought about Han Sen’s strange shield that could block the
Blood Demon Spear. It surprised even Kahn.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, I brought the Duke xenogeneic mount Metal Peacock
with me. That was too close,” Kahn thought gladly.</p>
<p>Kahn looked back at Planet Night Ghost, but then his jaw went
slack. Something colorful was coming. When he saw how quickly the
red cloud was approaching him, it seemed like the Duke class Metal
Peacock had stopped moving entirely.</p>
