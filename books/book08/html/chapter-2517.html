<p>“It finally begins.” Bai Wan Jie looked at the people fighting
in space. His eyes gleamed with excitement.</p>
<p>The moment Dragon One and the Gold Armor General appeared, the
Gold Armor General’s saw sword was buzzing. The swordlight flashed
toward them.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The swordlight flew right past them, cutting their bodies in
half. The people who were spectating the battle felt their hearts
run cold.</p>
<p>The next second, they realized that the fighters themselves
hadn’t been slashed in half; the swordlight had only cut through
the shadows that they left behind. Dragon One’s real body had
already moved. He and the others were now standing behind the Gold
Armor General.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time this happened, Dragon One and Dia Robber
used their areas. A dozen areas combined to shield them from the
strong Gold Armor General. It was like they had encased themselves
in dozens of layers of crystal.</p>
<p>The Gold Armor General’s eyes flashed. It moved forward as it
swung its gold greatsword, and the dozen hastily-combined areas
broke like shattered glass. Their protection couldn’t stop the
attacks of the Gold Armor General.</p>
<p>But because Dragon One and the others instantly separated, the
Gold Armor General’s attack was unable to hurt everybody. The
strike swept toward a few of the Kings in the front.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Kings and half-deifieds in the back
gathered up power. All their beams of light struck the body of the
Gold Armor General. The Gold Armor General obviously didn’t intend
to dodge. It allowed those beams of light to strike its armor, and
not even a scorch mark was left in their wake.</p>
<p>The Kings in front had no chance to dodge the creature’s
counterattack. They were struck by the swordlight, but again, their
bodies became shadows. They were teleported away by a half-deified
who was neither one of the Destroyed nor one of the Dragon.</p>
<p>This all seemed to happen slowly, but from start to finish, it
took less than a second. There was a half-deified there that was
well-versed in teleportation techniques, and a half-deified who was
skilled in cloning. They were cooperating together, and they
managed to save the Kings from the Gold Armor General’s attack.</p>
<p>Dragon One and the others surrounded and attacked the Gold Armor
General, but the monster’s gold armor seemed impervious to their
weapons. They were unable to break through its defense, which
rendered their attacks useless.</p>
<p>But as Han Sen watched the fight from a distance, he saw that
there was a strange symbol of light on the Gold Armor General’s
back. Dragon One’s attacks were useless against the Gold Armor
General, but every time he hit the Gold Armor General, that spell
became brighter.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked closer, and he realized what that spell was for.
It was a skill similar to Dollar’s Saving Money. The symbol of
light on the creature’s back would absorb whatever power was used
to attack it. Then, it would transform that power into something it
could use itself.</p>
<p>A dozen elites were continuing to attack the Gold Armor General,
and their efforts were making the spell grow brighter and brighter.
But Han Sen couldn’t see if it was affecting the Gold Armor General
or not.</p>
<p>The Gold Armor General swung its sword, but its attackers stayed
ahead of it with their teleportation and shadows. Dragon One and
the others had yet to be killed.</p>
<p>After a few slashes, the Gold Armor General seemed to be growing
impatient. It stopped swinging its sword. It spun the handle of its
weapon and raised it upward. The creature lifted the sword above
its head.</p>
<p>The gold greatsword’s cogwheels spun, but the saw teeth on the
outer edge of the sword stopped spinning. All of a sudden,
countless raging swordlights were unleashed.</p>
<p>The swordlights came out like a net of lasers, blanketing the
entire sky. Everything below was sliced into pieces.</p>
<p>Countless asteroids were reduced to rubble, and even a small
planet had the misfortune of being caught in the swordlights.
Dragon One and the others found themselves within the radius of
that sword net, too.</p>
<p>Dragon One’s team wasn’t afraid, though. It appeared as if they
knew the Gold Armor General would perform a move like this.</p>
<p>One of the half-deified Dragons moved at the same time the Gold
Armor General did. It used an area to encompass Dragon One and the
others.</p>
<p>The scary substance chains that formed the sword net landed on
Dragon One’s team, but their bodies had become like shadows again.
The sword net slid right through their bodies, and it was unable to
hurt them.</p>
<p>Just as the sword net passed by them, their bodies started to
become solid once more. The half-deified who had just used that
area looked pale, though. A trickle of blood snaked down from his
lips. It appeared as if using an area like that brought harm upon
him.</p>
<p>Dragon One and the others tried to buy time, and so they
attacked Gold Armor General again. The light on the back of the
Gold Armor General was incredibly bright. It was like a small
sun.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman had been watching all the while, and
she nodded thoughtfully. “I’m surprised they found people with
Group Galaxy Teleport, Mirror Doppelganger, and Ghost Shadow. As
long as those three powers are used in concert, they can guarantee
that Dragon One’s people won’t be killed by the Gold Armor General.
They really did come prepared. But these three powers cost a lot of
energy, so they won’t last forever. The Gold Armor General doesn’t
look too angry yet. I think they can last ten minutes, all in all.
I don’t know if they will survive any longer than that.”</p>
<p>Little Butterfly didn’t understand, and so she asked, “Even if
they survive for a short time, won’t this all be rather pointless
if they can’t kill the Gold Armor General?”</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman pointed at the Gold Armor General’s
back. The glowing symbol now looked like a little sun. “This is a
skill of the Dragon. It’s an Evilbreaker spell. When the strength
accumulates to a level, even a deified elite will be affected by
it. It will make them pause for a brief while. And in regards to
how long the Gold General Armor will be stopped, it all depends on
how much power they can gather up in the time they have. I don’t
think its effects will last any longer than one or two
seconds.”</p>
<p>“What is the point in doing all of this to stop Gold Armor
General for a measly two seconds? Their attacks won’t be able to
break Gold Armor General’s armor. It will be pointless if they only
buy themselves two seconds. Even if they had two hours or two days,
it would still be useless.” Little Butterfly still didn’t
understand.</p>
<p>The yellow-clothed woman looked at Han Sen on the battlefield.
“Dragon One must have placed his hopes on Dollar. When Gold Armor
General stops, Dollar will perform the deadly strike. If I am
correct, the item on his waist is a deified treasure of the Dragon.
It is called the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger. If it was used by a
deified, it could easily break through that armor.”</p>
<p>After pausing, the yellow-clothed woman went on to say, “But if
it is used by a King class, it is unlikely that it will puncture
the armor. I bet it can only be used to pierce the Gold Armor
General’s eyes. The eyes must be their target. I cannot be sure if
Dollar can succeed here, though. Even if he can, piercing the eyes
won’t kill the Gold Armor General. Dragon One must have another ace
up his sleeve.”</p>
<p>As she said this, Dragon One and the others reached the end of
their ability to hold on. The two who used Galaxy Teleport and
Mirror Doppelganger were pale, and their bodies were shaking. They
had used these skills ten times, and the radius of the areas they
cast was huge. They were tired, and they could no longer go on.</p>
<p>The half-deified using Ghost Shadow was even worse off. After he
made Dragon One and the others ghosts, he didn’t have enough power
to totally erase the substance chains. The effects would land on
him, and after using three Ghost Shadows, he was bleeding out of
all seven of his holes.</p>
