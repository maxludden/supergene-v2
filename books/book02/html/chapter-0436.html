    <p>
      &#8220;Great job, Colonel.&#8221; After returning to the cookhouse, Han
      Sen gave the fat squad leader a thumbs-up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Great my ass. I asked you to send a nutrition plan. What took you
      so long?&#8221; The fat squad leader said, upset.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;After the captain reviewed the plan, she asked me a few questions.
      Since I’m new here, I know nothing and gave her all the wrong answers,
      which was why it took so long. She even scolded me a little. After that I
      bumped into Colonel Wang. You are such a saver to be there on time…&#8221;
      Han Sen had thought his excuse out for a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do not cross Wang Hou in the future,&#8221; said the fat squad
      leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Colonel.&#8221; Although Han Sen was not afraid of Wang
      Hou, it was a troublesome situation. He was very grateful that the fat
      squad leader took him away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran had told him that everyone on Daphne had a complicated
      background, so he should not take anyone lightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are one of mine, so I will not let anyone else touch you. If
      you need to be disciplined, I’ll be the one to do so.&#8221; The fat squad
      leader hit Han Sen on the back and said, &#8220;Go do your job.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Because it was about three months until they could reach the planet where
      the ruins were, Han Sen swapped a few shifts and applied to enter God’s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time he teleported to God’s Sanctuary, he was still in the ice cave.
      This time, however, there were 7 to 8 people in the ice cave, chatting
      with each other. Xu You was also there.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, what took you so long? Here, I will introduce everyone to
      you.&#8221; Xu You introduced Han Sen to the rest of the group with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe it was because of the difficult living conditions, everyone knew the
      benefit of help each other. The majority of the group were very easy-going
      and easy to talk to.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Genius, you are here as well?&#8221; The young man suddenly
      exclaimed at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are?&#8221; Han Sen regarded the young man and found his face
      did not ring a bell.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My name is Liu Feng. I also graduated from Blackhawk, one year
      before you did. But my grades were just average, so it makes sense that
      you don’t know me,&#8221; Liu Feng smiled and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What genius? Liu Feng, Han Sen is your schoolmate?&#8221; Xu You
      asked in surprise
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Feng told the group about Han Sen’s needs at Blackhawk. He seemed to
      have paid a lot of attention to Han Sen and even knew he graduated with
      the rank of major.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rest of the group looked at Han Sen in surprise. After a long while,
      Xu You lamented, &#8220;I did not realize that you are a graduate of a top
      school and even graduated as a major. You should have a much brighter
      future than this. This place would make it so difficult for you to go any
      further.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not necessarily. As long as we occupy that spirit shelter, we will
      have everything,&#8221; Han Sen smiled and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was teleport device in the spirit shelter, so if they could occupy
      the place, they could turn that into a human shelter. All they needed to
      do was to withstand the attacks from creatures nearby.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Young man, this is much more difficult than that. This is Second
      God’s Sanctuary, not a military school where kids hang. You can really die
      here.&#8221; A middle-aged man in his 40s or 50s curled his lips,
      squatting in the corner. He then said, &#8220;Don’t think that you are
      going to conquer everything because you are somebody in a military school.
      I will give it to you if you hunt any creature back. You don’t even need
      to take the spirit shelter down.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Genius, don’t pay him any mind. He used to be quite talented and
      evolved with sacred geno points maxed out but ended up here and was
      trapped for nearly 20 years. He did not even have many mutant geno points,
      so he had lost the will to fight,&#8221; said Xu You.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked to the middle-aged man, surprised. A sacred evolver twenty
      years ago&#8211;that was much harder to acieve than a sacred evolver
      today, and he must be truly something. Even that kind of person became
      this way, which made Han Sen feel sad. The middle-aged man kept silent
      squatting in the corner, taking one puff after another from the cigarette
      in his hand
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With so many people here, why don’t we go hunting?&#8221; Han Sen
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We are waiting for Uncle Qing. I told you last time, he was the
      strongest among us. If we go together with him, it will be safer. Uncle
      Qing looks after the young. I will introduce you later. You can hunt with
      us today. Right, how come I never saw the girl from the other day? Did she
      give up?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I’m not so sure.&#8221; Han Sen knew he was talking about Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen boarded Daphne, he could no longer use his private comlink
      to contact anyone, so Han Sen had told Zero to enter God’s Sanctuary in
      two months to meet him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not expect to be able to enter God’s Sanctuary so soon, and he
      had no way to tell her to come. So he will have to wait until the agreed
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will walk around myself to get familiar with the environment
      first.&#8221; Han Sen walked outside directly, not planning to hunt
      together with the rest of the group.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he made no efforts, he would not be shared the gains. If he made
      efforts, it would be very suspicious for someone who just evolved to have
      his fitness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, Han Sen decided to hunt on his own, not following the rest of
      the group.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haven’t I told you already? You are not familiar with this place,
      and it’s too dangerous outside. Even if you want to hunt yourself, you
      should follow us for a few times and go along later. Otherwise, it is
      truly too dangerous,&#8221; said Xu You.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, genius. This place is very dangerous,&#8221; Liu Feng also
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew they meant well, but he had his own concerns and did not want
      to waste time on meaningless stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have already looked it up on the Skynet and learned something
      about this place. I will just take a walk and be back in a minute. There
      will be no dangers,&#8221; Han Sen explained casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Xu You was about to say something, the middle-aged man sneered,
      &#8220;He is looking forward to being killed. Why are you stopping him?
      For someone so arrogant, it serves him right to be killed.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not pay him any mind, waved to the rest of the group and
      walked out of the ice cave.
    </p>

    <p>
      The weather was no good this day as well. A snowstorm welcomed Han Sen as
      he walked out of the cave. Han Sen walked toward the spirit shelter in the
      storm. With his ability, it should be easy for him to beat mutant
      creatures and aristocrat spirits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if he could not occupy the spirit shelter for now, it would be nice
      to experience the creatures and spirits in Second God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen was far from the ice cave, he summoned Meowth to run to the
      mountain. Before long, he suddenly heard a beast roar.
    </p>

    <p>
      A white creature with ice-like armor covering its back was growling at Han
      Sen and Meowth.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Is this the ice-armored beast Xu You was talking about?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gazed at the creature which looked a lot like what Xu You had
      described.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was thinking, the ice-armored beast rushed toward Han Sen,
      growling. Its speed was even faster than the sacred-blood beast creatures
      in First God’s Sanctuary.
