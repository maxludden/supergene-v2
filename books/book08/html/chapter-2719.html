<p>“Yes, I am God. I can do anything,” Empty God confirmed, his
face unchanging.</p>
<p>“But my parents told me that this world has no God and that
science is the truth.” Han Sen gave Empty God a look that was very
skeptical.</p>
<p>“In that case, your parents are ignorant.” Empty God looked at
Han Sen and went on to say, “You are a crystallizer. It is no
surprise that you think this way. You learn a thing or two about
how the universe works, and then poof! You think you know it all.
What a foolish bunch of people.”</p>
<p>Empty God clearly thought Han Sen was stupid. He coldly went on,
“You can make any wish you want. You can, for example, wish to
become deified. You can wish for a deified treasure that is of a
very high level. Or you can even wish to become the master of Outer
Sky. I can satisfy your wishes and show you what a real god can
do.”</p>
<p>Han Sen blinked. He looked innocent and said, “I don’t need any
of that stuff.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to be the strongest fighter of your lifetime? Do
you not want to claim the universe for yourself? For me, giving you
such power would be a piece of cake. If you make a wish, I can make
it come true for you,” Empty God said, trying to tempt Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes, but what would I need any of that stuff for?” Han Sen
asked Empty God again, looking confused.</p>
<p>Empty God seemed prepared to answer the same question many
times. “Then you can have anything you want. The pretty women of
every race will become your toys. The elites of every race will
become your slaves. You can be the leader of the entire universe.
The creatures in the universe will obey you and fear you.”</p>
<p>“This sounds pretty lame. I don’t want any of that.” Han Sen
didn’t want to make a wish like that. Not to mention that if he did
make such an expensive request, Empty God would probably pick his
bones clean in taking payment.</p>
<p>“Then, what would you like?” Empty God asked with a frown. This
man in front of him seemed pretty dumb, but the simpleton was
harder to tempt and convince than most.</p>
<p>“I’m very happy with the way I am now, thank you. I don’t need
anything. If you really are God, you should save these wishes and
spend them on the people who are really suffering and require the
help,” Han Sen said to Empty God in the most condescending tone
that he could manage.</p>
<p>He knew that gods like King Jun couldn’t directly attack beings
of the universe, so he wasn’t really afraid of what Empty God could
do to him.</p>
<p>Empty God’s face darkened. Whenever he encountered people of
this universe, he always found a way to make them wish for
something. But on this particular day, he was intent on finding the
geno protoplasm. He wasn’t in the mood to waste time talking to Han
Sen. After staring coldly at Han Sen for a second, he turned away
and ignored Han Sen. He wanted to walk around and see if he could
find a lead on the geno protoplasm.</p>
<p>When he saw Empty God taking his leave, Han Sen suppressed a
sigh of relief. But the black crystal was still keeping his Sea of
Soul and body locked down. It was too soon to be happy, because
Empty God was still around.</p>
<p>“If you are refusing to leave, then I will instead,” Han Sen
thought. He would stay away from the Star Tree until Empty God
decided to leave as well.</p>
<p>But Han Sen hadn’t been flying away from the Star Tree for long
when he saw Empty God appear in front of him again. He was coming
toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Empty God had found no sign of the geno protoplasm anywhere, so
he had come back for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was the only person in the area. If there was geno
protoplasm in the vicinity, Han Sen was the likeliest person to
have seen it. Empty God wasn’t happy about being unable to read Han
Sen’s mind.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face remained expressionless. He kept going forward.
He was neither fast nor slow. He didn’t want Empty God to become
suspicious of him.</p>
<p>When Empty God was near enough that Han Sen could hear him, he
spoke again. “Have you considered my offer? You still have the
chance to make a wish.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t have a wish I want to make right now. You should
go and ask someone else,” Han Sen said. Then, he tried to maneuver
past Empty God.</p>
<p>“I’ve asked you to make a wish, so make a wish. Stop talking
crap!” Empty God’s face looked icy. He waved his hand, tearing a
frightening rip in the fabric of space. Han Sen felt as if the
world was shattering in front of him.</p>
<p>Empty God was a rather foul-tempered individual. At least King
Jun usually tried to trick Han Sen, but Empty God couldn’t even be
bothered to make the effort. He was just trying to blackmail Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t about to let himself be intimidated, though. He
understood the nature and some of the limitations of these
self-proclaimed gods. He wouldn’t be pushed around that easily.</p>
<p>“It seems that you don’t know me very well. It doesn’t matter
how badly you want me to make a wish, because I’m not going to do
it. What can you do to me, huh? If you really are God, you should
be able to kill me pretty easily,” Han Sen growled, his expression
unyielding.</p>
<p>Empty God looked surprised. Tearing space open with his bare
hands should have startled Han Sen out of his wits. Even deifieds
would be shocked speechless by Empty God’s power. But somehow, this
brainless person was wholly unfazed by his display of strength. It
made Empty God unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>If he had been able to attack, Empty God would have slapped Han
Sen to death and stolen his memory. But he couldn’t attack Han Sen
like that. Not in this universe, at least.</p>
<p>“Very good.” Empty God didn’t say another word. He turned and
left, vanishing after a few steps. And then, the broken space
returned to normal.</p>
<p>“These guys really can’t do anything in the geno universe. Maybe
there are certain conditions that render them unable to attack. But
even so, it means I’ll be alright even if all the gods become my
enemies. As long as I don’t make a wish, they can’t do anything to
me,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>But the black crystal armor still hadn’t released the seal on
his body, so Han Sen knew that Empty God hadn’t truly left the
vicinity. Han Sen returned to the Star Tree, but Empty God remained
hidden.</p>
<p>Not long after, Exquisite and Li Keer brought Bao’er with them
to the Star Tree. Han Sen’s stomach sank instantly. Empty God
hadn’t been able to get anything from Han Sen, but the god might
try to collect wishes from the people around Han Sen. Exquisite and
Li Keer would be easier to break.</p>
<p>Han Sen put his worries into the small jade figure so Exquisite
and Li Keer could feel his worries and be wary.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer felt Han Sen’s concern, and so they asked
what was going on. Han Sen told them about meeting Empty God and
advised them to remain wary.</p>
<p>While the three of them were talking, Bao’er climbed up the Star
Tree. She was playing on the surface of a Star Fruit when suddenly,
a man appeared on the branch next to her.</p>
<p>“Little kid, do you want this?” Empty God was holding a
beautiful gem. He smiled at Bao’er and swung the gem around as he
spoke to her.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been right to expect that Empty God would target the
people around him, but he had misjudged which person Empty God
would go after. The god hadn’t chosen Exquisite or Li Keer. He was
aiming for the innocent Bao’er.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at the shining gem in Empty God’s hands. Her eyes
opened wide with surprise.</p>
