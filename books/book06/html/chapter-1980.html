<h2>Killing Ant Queen</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1980</h3>

<p>There was no need for Han Sen to fight anymore. The purple smoke
was spreading quickly across the ant queen, ripping its wounds
apart and sending blood spewing out of it like a burst dam.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too lazy to wait, though. He slashed again and cut
the heavily-injured ant queen’s head clean off.</p>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Jade Ant Queen: xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>There was an announcement, and it made Han Sen very happy. “It
really is a mutant xenogeneic!”</p>
<p>The Jade Ants did not back off just because the ant queen was
killed. They all came rushing at Han Sen like kamikazes.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave Spell back her body, and she quickly got to firing
rockets at the droves. Meanwhile, Han Sen went on to finish off the
rest of the Earls himself.</p>
<p>After many more ants were killed, the rest decided to return to
their abode below the stone.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not seek to pursue the fight. He harvested the
bodies of the ant queen and the eight Earls. He also collected many
Viscount xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>Yu Jing saw Han Sen picking up all those xenogeneic genes and
felt depressed. He had to comfort himself by saying, “It is lucky I
can at least get half of those jade fruits. This guy is scary, and
he is nothing like the stories people tell about him. He doesn’t
seem like the sort of fellow who would need to be carried into Sky
Palace. I should have totally fought for a greater share of this
haul.”</p>
<p>There were fourteen jade fruits on the tree. Han Sen and Yu Jing
each took half. Han Sen received seven, and then he asked Yu Jing
what benefit they could provide.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, how about we co-operate in Xuanyuan Cave and kill
more xenogeneics together. We can split the gatherings in your
favor, sixty-forty. I guess I could settle for seventy-thirty.
Eighty-twenty is a possibility, too. You should think about
it!”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not continue his hunt in Xuanyuan Cave. He took his
spoils and left. He flew the legless crane back to his island.</p>
<p>Right then, he wanted to find out the purpose of mutant
xenogeneic genes. He did not need to do any more hunting at this
point.</p>
<p>He gave a few Viscount Jade Ant bodies to the legless crane. He
didn’t collect the xenogeneic genes inside the bodies, either. The
crane was able to gobble them all up.</p>
<p>The legless crane happily swallowed the first, and it made a
grateful noise to Han Sen as it ate.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to the stone house and pulled the bodies out. He
cut open the ant queen’s body and picked up a piece of flesh that
looked like jade.</p>
<p>That meat was transparent, and not unlike shrimp. Something gold
shone from it, and looking into the gold light, you could see it
was the face of the ant queen.</p>
<p>“Earl Genes insufficient. Cannot refine mutant xenogeneic
genes.”</p>
<p>As Han Sen held the ant queen’s xenogeneic gene, he received the
same announcement.</p>
<p>“I have nine Earl genes. And here there are eight Earl class
Jade Ants. I don’t know if that’ll be enough.” Han Sen cut open the
eight Earl ants and picked up the xenogeneic genes within.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave the ant queen’s body, and the bodies of the others,
to the legless crane for food. Bubble was Han Sen’s only other
companion right now, so there was nothing else he could feed.</p>
<p>Han Sen had an Earl pet beast soul and seven Viscount beast
souls, but he did not fancy feeding them at all. Having a pet in
Sky Palace would not be something you could easily hide. If others
discovered that he possessed one, explaining that might be
difficult.</p>
<p>Jade Ant xenogeneic genes were like a fist-sized cut of meat.
After Han Sen melted them down, it was like a barbecue. The oil
sizzled, and he sprinkled it with salt and pepper. It tasted better
than barbecued lamb.</p>
<p>“Earl Genes +1”</p>
<p>After eating a piece of the ant meat, Han Sen felt very alive.
He was energized, and he felt as if he could have sex ten times in
one night.</p>
<p>After eating four pieces of that meat, his belly was bloated.
The meal was very filling.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to wait before eating the rest, though, so
he switched on Consume and quickly digested the ants that were in
his stomach. By the time he was done, he had finished all eight
slabs of ant meat.</p>
<p>In total, Han Sen now had seventeen Earl genes. But when he
picked up the ant queen’s mutant genes, it still said he did not
have enough Earl genes.</p>
<p>“How many Earl genes do I need? I can’t figure out the number.”
Han Sen felt depressed, but it was almost time for White Jade Jing
to open again. He did not have time to venture into the cave just
yet, so he’d think about what to do once he returned from White
Jade Jing.</p>
<p>Practicing in White Jade Jing was the most important thing he
could do right now. He had three geno arts that needed to play
catch-up and reach Earl status, so White Jade Jing was very
important. It was why Yisha had sent him here, after all.</p>
<p>Of course, Yisha had sent him there only intending for him to
level up The Story of Genes to Earl status. And that was something
he had already accomplished.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, are you here?” The day White Jade Jing opened, someone
was calling for Han Sen before he had woken up.</p>
<p>The voice was Yun Suyi’s. Han Sen went to brush his teeth, then
opened the door. Yun Suyi was wearing a white dress, and she was
standing just outside the door. The cut of the dress showed off her
attractive legs.</p>
<p>“White Jade Jing is opening today. Let’s go.” Yun Suyi blinked
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Yeah,” Han Sen answered. He turned to wake up the legless crane
that was snoozing beneath the tree.</p>
<p>“Let’s take my Jade Wing Tiger. It is faster,” Yun Suyi
said.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Han Sen nodded, letting the legless crane continue to
sleep.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat behind her, and the Jade Wing Tiger flew towards
White Jade Jing.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are a student of Knife Queen. You must surely know
many knife skills. I’ve learned a few, but I fear there is
something amiss. If you ever have the time, could you teach me a
thing or two?” Yun Suyi turned around and smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I can’t teach you, but we can practice together,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“Okay, then. After White Jade Jing closes, I will take you over
to my place.” Yun Suyi smiled in a flirty way.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Yun Suyi went to the White Jade Building, and they
split up when they reached the fourth floor. Yun Suyi said she’d
wait for Han Sen.</p>
<p>This time, Han Sen stopped on the sixth floor. He had decided to
practice there this time. He had to practice his other geno arts,
and he did not know if his body could withstand the Jade Air of the
seventh floor without using Petrify.</p>
<p>But the sixth floor was full of students. It filled up soon
after, and people were everywhere.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, you are here!” Yu Jing walked in and saw Han Sen,
then went over to sit down beside him.</p>
