    <p>
      Meowth that was eating suddenly bristled. It bared its teeth toward the
      direction of the noise and growled fiercely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stared at the direction of the snowcapped mountain, and soon saw a
      creature that looked like a triceratops rushing out from behind the
      mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its horn looked like a silver awl and its skin looked like iron. The
      moment the triceratops came out, Han Sen felt dazed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wondered if Yi Dongmu was dumb. Such a large creature weighed at
      least a dozen tons. It would take more than a year for someone to eat it.
      What use would it be even if he killed it?
    </p>

    <p>
      But then Han Sen thought, Yi Dongmu was probably just trying to gain the
      beast soul. The meat was not that important to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt a bit upset. However, it would not be a waste if he got the
      meat. He would not eat himself, but he could feed Archangel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took Meowth and ran back. He did not need to move a finger anyway.
      With 20% of the meat, he could feed Archangel happily.
    </p>

    <p>
      That triceratops had rushed to the location of the body of the mutant
      creature. Without a pause, it still came toward Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu who was buried in the snow suddenly came out of the pit,
      stabbing his dagger at the stomach of the triceratops.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skin of the triceratops was much thicker than that of the mutant
      creature. The dagger of Yi Dongmu disappeared in the skin of the
      triceratops, yet no blood came out. Only black leather and white fat was
      cut open.
    </p>

    <p>
      The triceratops tried to get rid of Yi Dongmu under its stomach. However,
      Yi Dongmu moved up its body and came to its back like a gecko, stabbing
      its back fiercely.
    </p>

    <p>
      The triceratops roared and stamped like crazy, trying to take Yi Dongmu
      down. However, Yi Dongmu stuck himself so closely to the creature that he
      would not fall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen found a remote spot and sat down, caressing the head of Meowth and
      enjoying his barbecue as well as the performance of Yi Dongmu.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bravo. I will give you 9.9 for this move,&#8221; when seeing an
      excellent move, Han Sen could not help sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu was so upset. The skin of the triceratops was so thick and tough
      that only a little blood came out when he had stabbed the creature
      multiple times.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, the triceratops seemed to have infinite strength.
      Jumping and wiggling, it almost got rid of Yi Dongmu several times. He had
      to hold the creature tied with both hands and stick close to it. There was
      no chance for him to touch the dagger again.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen was enjoying the show, applauding when seeing something
      good, which made Yi Dongmu feel so upset he was about to vomit blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come and help me!&#8221; Yi Dongmu could not last any longer and
      yelled to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is not okay. We had an agreement. You give me 20% of the meat
      and all I need to do is to lure the sacred-blood creature out. I will not
      mind other businesses,&#8221; Han Sen shook his head and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If this creature runs away, you will get nothing,&#8221; Yi Dongmu
      exclaimed again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you want me to make a move, that is fine. However, that way, we
      could not split the meat like this. I must have 60% of the meat. 20% is my
      reward for leading it out. And the other 40% is what I should have for
      collaborating with you to kill it,&#8221; Han Sen counted his fingers and
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;60% is fine. You help me kill it, and you can take 60% of the
      meat.&#8221; Yi Dongmu was in no mood to bargain with Han Sen. His main
      goal was to try to gain the beast soul. The meat was less important.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s a deal.&#8221; Han Sen then stood up, summoned
      his claws and walked toward the triceratops.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Help me to distract it from the side…&#8221; Seeing Han Sen
      approaching, Yi Dongmu quickly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen did not pay any attention to him. He walked directly to
      face the triceratops.
    </p>

    <p>
      The triceratops noticed Han Sen and rushed to him with its eyes red. It
      almost looks like a locomotive at full speed, incredibly scary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was still walking toward the triceratops at a normal speed. The
      moment it was about to clash with the triceratops, Han Sen&#8217;s body
      suddenly leaned back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The triceratops rushed over Han Sen&#8217;s body, Han Sen was lying in the
      gap between its legs. The triceratops went ahead but did not hurt Han Sen
      at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen dusted off the snow on his body and got up. The triceratops
      screamed with blood coming out of its stomach. It wiggled and fell to the
      ground with a thump. It struggled several times but failed to get up
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu jumped off the back of the triceratops, observed the struggling
      creature carefully and saw three marks on its stomach that went through
      its entire body. Obviously, they were left by Han Sen when he brushed by
      the creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu stared at Han Sen for a long while. He did not expect that the
      random person he met was such a master.
    </p>

    <p>
      He knew the impressive figures on the icefield, so he did not pay too much
      attention to Han Sen when he first saw Han Sen. However, Han Sen&#8217;s
      strike made Yi Dongmu feel utterly surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you do not move fast, it will die,&#8221; Han Sen noted Yi
      Dongmu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally speaking, under these circumstances, Han Sen would abide by the
      agreement. Since he had agreed to help Yi Dongmu kill the creature and he
      had 60% of the meat, he did not need to be greedy about the potential
      beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu did not say anything and stabbed his dagger into the jaw of the
      triceratops, ending its life with several strikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether Yi Dongmu had gained a beast soul. However, he did not have any
      special expression after killing the creature. Walking up to Han Sen, he
      said, &#8220;You&#8217;re good.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Just average. I just broke a hundred,&#8221; Han Sen said casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know the locations of some other sacred-blood creatures living
      alone. How about we continue to cooperate in the future?&#8221; Yi Dongmu
      said seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s okay. However, if it were a long-term cooperation, we
      could not split like this,&#8221; Han Sen smiled and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We will split the meat half-and-half. The beast soul will depend on
      our own luck.&#8221; The fact that Yi Dongmu said that showed he reckoned
      that Han Sen was stronger than himself. Otherwise, because he provided the
      location, he should have taken 10% more.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay,&#8221; Han Sen agreed. It would take Han Sen some time to
      find sacred-blood creatures, and he would not necessarily be able to kill
      those creatures alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu will provide him with the location of the sacred-blood creatures
      and he could take half of the gains. There was nothing wrong about that.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s split up the sacred-blood meat first,&#8221; Han Sen
      pointed to the body of the triceratops and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can have all of it. You have poison on the weapon, so the meat
      has already been contaminated. Even if I take it, I will not dare to eat
      it,&#8221; Yi Dongmu said calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you then.&#8221; Han Sen summoned the angel, asking her to
      eat the triceratops up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Humanoid pet? What is the level of it?&#8221; Yi Dongmu stared at
      the Archangel. With his background, he had never got a chance to have a
      humanoid pet.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Sacred-blood,&#8221; Han Sen said casually.</p>
