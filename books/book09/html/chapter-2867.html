<h2>Top 100 List</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2867</h3>

<p>Han Sen thought he would have trouble getting into the top 100,
but his opponent gave up. His enemy did not appear on the space
battleground for their fight. Han Sen realized that killing Sky
Armor God had created an interesting effect. Before figuring out
who he was, even top class deified elites feared him.</p>
<p>Just like this round, the opponent was the top class. It was a
true god class xenogeneic that was very powerful. Even he did not
dare go to the space battleground to fight. These people are
overestimating my abilities. But that is good. It saves me a lot of
trouble. Han Sen departed the space battleground. After entering
the top 100 rounds, the modes of fighting had changed. The matches
were no longer simple deathmatches.</p>
<p>The mode of the top 100 round fights made Han Sen complain to
God. “Your ranking fights are too childish. How can you choose what
rank you are?”</p>
<p>It was no wonder Han Sen complained. The top 100 mode of
fighting was strange. Every creature in the top 100 list could
choose what rank they wanted to be. Each rank could only be chosen
by one creature. It did not depend on who was stronger. It was all
about speed. If one was fast enough, one could end up being in the
top place.</p>
<p>When Han Sen looked at the matches, things seemed even more
unreasonable. After picking a rank, every person chose the rank
they wished to challenge.</p>
<p>If one was on the 100 list and wanted first place, one could go
straight to challenge the being in first place. That challenge
could only be done once. If one failed, one could not challenge any
other rank. No matter how strong one was, one would still be in
100th place. Han Sen looked at God and said, “If you do this, then
whoever selects first place will accept the challenges of many
other creatures. For the spots that no one wants, they would not
even have to have a single fight.”</p>
<p>“You do not understand,” God said with a smile. “That is why it
is interesting. You should think about what rank you want to be. If
you want to be first, just tell me. I can bend the rules for you
and put you in first place.” “Thanks, but no thanks. I do not want
to get ranked.” Han Sen was considering which rank he should
select.</p>
<p>Now that he had thought about it, there were skills involved
that depended on which rank he selected. Even the ones that could
take first place would think about whether or not they should
actually choose it. If they kept getting ganged up on, they could
lose. The creatures that were just average and not top class had a
better chance of getting a higher spot, which would not be
outstanding. Han Sen planned to choose a spot that was not too high
so it would not be outstanding. Although Han Sen’s power was not
bad, and he had a god personality armament, the ones that could get
into the top 100 were all true god deified. None of them would be
easy to beat.</p>
<p>There were people like Very High Leader and Sky Palace Leader.
Even if they did not have a god personality armament, they could
wield true god weaponry. The</p>
<p>Han Sen’s target was to reach the top 100. Now, he had what he
wanted. He did not plan on reaching first place.</p>
<p>With the reward of the ranks, the top 10 must be the most
popular. God only knows how many creatures actually want them. When
the list is revealed, the top 10 will be bosses. It will only be me
there, who is easy to bully. I bet people will want to challenge
me. The top 10 is not good for me. Han Sen watched for a while. He
thought somewhere around 20 would be great.</p>
<p>At around 20, true gods would not like that. They would not
challenge those places, and the weaker sorts would not select that
ranking. Han Sen could probably select a ranking there.</p>
<p>At around 20, he was able to sit back and watch the fireworks.
He would even have a chance to challenge the higher ranks. If he
lost, rank 20 would not be so bad.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned on choosing a rank somewhere around 20. The best
spot was 22. If he was unable to choose it, he would choose one of
the others inside the 20s.</p>
<p>As he waited to choose his rank, Han Sen had a screen in front
of him. There were 100 squares labeled one to 100. The very top had
a countdown. After the timer was up, they could start taking their
spot and see who got which rank first. Han Sen This God is so
boring. Even a fight needs you to take rank. When the countdown was
up, Han Sen clicked on the number 22 tile. When Han Sen was going
to select number 22, the number 22 tile became red. Someone had
already taken it.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly checked out which number in the 20s was still
available. He could only hear cha-cha-cha, as all the 20s became
red. From 11 to 40, all the positions had been taken.</p>
<p>But there were still positions in the top 10 and lower that had
yet to be taken.</p>
<p>Higher or lower? Han Sen hesitated a little. He heard
“cha-cha-cha.” Most of the squares turned red. There were only
three more numbers behind 95 left.</p>
<p>Holy shit! This is too fast. Is this a mother*cking garage sale?
Han Sen felt depressed.</p>
<p>There was no point in choosing after 95. The rewards were
similar. No one would challenge that spot, so Han Sen chose the
highest one out of the last three numbers. He selected 98.</p>
<p>Before he raised his hand, 98 and 99 were gone. There were only
100 left.</p>
<p>I can challenge someone once. I will choose 100.” Han Sen
selected the 100th square.</p>
<p>After confirming his position, Han Sen looked at the rankings.
He noticed the one in the highest place was Golden Growler. Very
High Leader was second. Lou Lie was third. Demon Alpha was fourth.
A xenogeneic called Seeking Perfume Beast was fifth. Ancient God’s
Ancient Sacrifice God was sixth. Extreme King’s Bai Wuchang was
seventh. A xenogeneic called Empty Dragon King was eight. A
xenogeneic was ninth.</p>
<p>Han Sen discovered the top 100 were mostly xenogeneics. The
famous races of the universe were actually quite rare.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked through it all the way to 81. He then saw the
name Zhang Xuandao.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace Leader is very humble. He chose such a low rank.”
Han Sen was speechless. Thinking about Sky Palace Leader’s
personality, it was not too strange that he had chosen that.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked down. When he saw number 84, he was shocked.
Burning Lamp. He cannot be the Burning Lamp Alpha from the Buddha,
can he? How did he get into the top 100? Han Sen was a bit
surprised. As far as he knew, Burning Lamp Alpha was deified but
just larva class. There was no way he had managed to get into the
top 100.</p>
