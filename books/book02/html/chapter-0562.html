    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen draw nearer to the valley&#8217;s exit, Wang Liang hurried
      the group into battle formation. They were ready to fight against the
      snake-king.
    </p>

    <p>
      The party was composed of elite evolvers. Some of them were currently
      serving in the army, whereas some others had retired. Having all shared
      military experience, they were hardened warriors with phenomenal abilities
      in battle. They did not fear the fight to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he had established their formation, Han Sen had just about brought
      the Snake-King and its following of lesser ice-snakes out of the valley.
      Without the deep snow to hide their bodies, however, they all looked like
      colossal foes.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the battle began, Han Sen ceased running. He summoned his ghost-pawed
      claws and started to attack the snake-king.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen dodged the gaping maw of the silver-eye ice snake king, and with
      the ghost-pawed claws, countered to slice off one of its silver scales.
      The snake-king&#8217;s silver flesh was too thick to fully pierce,
      however, and all that was inflicted upon it were three scratch marks. They
      weren&#8217;t proper cuts, and were far from critical, life-threatening
      wounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang and his men then ran towards the gathering of snakes. They
      maintained their formation, though widening to surround the snake-king.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without the cover of the snow, the ordinary and mutant ice-snakes were
      unable to compete with the elites. In a great reckoning, countless
      ice-snakes were slain. As each snake dyed the earth a sickly red, their
      corpses were sent flying with great force.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, the ten evolvers had surrounded the snake-king. The beast was fierce,
      wild and mad. When it lifted its rear, it lashed around to smash numerous
      glaciers. Given how crazy it was, Han Sen and his fellow fighters did not
      dare to fight the creature head-on, face-to-face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Giant creatures were born powerfully, and substantially outperformed
      humans. The silver-eye ice snake king&#8217;s scales were solid, and its
      flesh was thick. Although Han Sen and his party gave the beast a series of
      strong attacks, none seemed likelier to kill the beast than the last.
      Instead, all they did was amplify the snake-king&#8217;s rage to even
      greater degree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the snake-king behaving like a sordid monster from some ancient
      tale, Han Sen felt gloomy. The ghost-pawed claws were too short, and
      didn&#8217;t seem viable to fight a creature as large as that. If he had a
      longer weapon, perhaps then he would stand a chance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, though, Han Sen was glad to have brought along Wang Liang and
      the rest of the elites. Had he not, he didn&#8217;t think he could do
      anything or have the opportunity to fight the snake-king without the
      interference of countless lesser ice-snakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You guys go on ahead; I&#8217;ll take a break,&#8221; Han Sen
      shouted to Wang Liang, as he left the battlefield.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang thought to himself, &#8220;We&#8217;ve come here to help you
      slay the snake-king. We&#8217;re risking our lives enough, and now you run
      off? You are obscene!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As he cursed Han Sen, Wang Liang caught a glimpse of a certain flame. A
      red firebird that looked like a phoenix appeared, drawn from Han
      Sen&#8217;s body. The flames were scorching hot, and they rose high into
      the air. In just a moment, the flames had encircled the entire area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang noticed that his and his party&#8217;s beast soul powers had
      been greatly increased. Though he was surprised, he was very glad and
      said, &#8220;Halo beast soul; and for such a large effective range? I
      wonder if it is a sacred-blood beast soul.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The beast soul powers of everyone else in the party were also greatly
      increased, and it felt to them that the fight had become easier. The
      pressure had most certainly eased up, and they look extremely pleased.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen left the desert bird behind on the battlefield and continued on
      his way, but he made sure to keep his eye on how the others did, as they
      battled the snake-king in his absence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of the ten of them, six of them were using a sacred-blood weapon. Three of
      the six were employing heavy weapons; there was a lance, a great-axe and a
      hammer.
    </p>

    <p>
      These three posed the greatest threat to the snake-king, but still, the
      scales were too hard and they could not damage it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s only a sacred-blood class creature; it cannot be
      indestructible! It must possess a weak point somewhere!&#8221; Han Sen
      watched the snake-king&#8217;s every movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      But no weak point could be found. The silver scales could endure ten
      strikes from the evolvers, and with such defense, there was no need for it
      to move around and protect certain parts of its body. It could bear the
      brunt of any attack.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      An evolver was unable to dodge in time and was struck by the
      snake-king&#8217;s tail. He was sent flying for over ten meters and
      roughly crashed into the ground. He spat blood from his mouth, but the hit
      he had taken was not life-threatening. Quickly, he brought himself back up
      to his feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen jumped back into fray, filling in the spot left by the hurt
      evolver.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Boss! The snake-king&#8217;s scales are too tough. It&#8217;s
      impossible for us to kill it! Why don&#8217;t we retreat and think of
      something else?&#8221; Wang Liang shouted across the battlefield, as he
      continued to engage with the enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      He wasn&#8217;t alone in this suggestion, as others had thought of falling
      back, too. Despite everything they threw at it, nothing seemed to heavily
      wound the snake-king. Their hopes of victory were fleeting, and they were
      getting discouraged.
    </p>

    <p>
      To lose hope was a scary and dangerous thing. If you were weary, or even
      bleeding in a fight, knowing that you were dealing the same amount of
      damage to your enemy meant there was a chance of victory; there was no
      reason to be afraid. But they didn&#8217;t seem to be damaging the
      snake-king and if their hope of victory was slipping away, so too would
      their battle fervor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen however did not respond. He continued to fight the snake-king,
      while paying extra attention to the movements of the enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      He wanted to wait a while longer, so that the poison of the ghost-pawed
      claws might take effect. But there was no change in the snake-king&#8217;s
      behavior, and it didn&#8217;t seem to work. It was as powerful as ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The flesh and bones of the snake-king are tough. Even if I use Yin
      Force, it would probably be useless. Perhaps I could use Yin Force on its
      head and damage its brain?&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he truly attempted striking the snake-king&#8217;s head, this would be
      a perilous move. One mistake would result in a big bite, courtesy of the
      snake-king&#8217;s cavernous mouth. The meter-long, frostbite-primed
      snake-teeth seemed as if they could slice right through and kill you
      before the frostbite could even take effect.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The snake-king twirled, lashing away one more evolver. So powerful was the
      strike that the longsword was wholly bent out of shape. This beast was a
      fearsome thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Boss, we must fall back! We cannot slay this creature.&#8221; A
      voice called out from one of the evolvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen responded, &#8220;Keep fighting! Everybody must obey my commands.
      If any of you choose not to, don&#8217;t bother returning to the shelter.
      Go find Dong Lin and explain your desertion.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wang Liang, move to your left by three meters and attack its left
      side! Zhao Qiang, move right by two meters, forward one meter and strike
      its right-wing!&#8221; Han Sen barked the orders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Liang had little choice but to listen and follow Han Sen&#8217;s
      orders. The two who had been given instructions however weren&#8217;t
      exactly sure what their boss was hoping to achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      The formation they were in was the result of much practice and perfect
      synchronicity between the elite evolvers. Never had they been issued a
      command that altered this formation, and no matter how smart they thought
      Han Sen was, they didn&#8217;t think he could randomly come up with a
      brand-new and better formation; and nor did they want him to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because these changes could result in an accident, it was now down to an
      individual&#8217;s talent; the daily training and practice of blocking,
      dodging and striking were more important than ever. No immediate command
      such as this could put them in a better position than they already were.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was different. The way he viewed things, the men were just
      pawns on a chessboard. His use of the Dongxue Sutra was increasing, and
      this allowed him to control them as if he were a game player.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earlier, when Han Sen had quit the fight for a brief while, he
      didn&#8217;t just stop to observe the beast and try to find its weak
      points. He was also observing the skills and abilities of Wang Liang and
      his people. He had to gain a greater understanding of their powers to be
      able to issue the right commands.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, Wang Liang was forced to listen to Han Sen&#8217;s command
      despite lacking any desire to, but his opinion quickly changed. And so too
      did the opinions of the rest of the party, for when their formation
      changed, their new positions made it considerably easier to fight the
      snake-king. They were all further from danger, and no one received another
      blow from the snake-king.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were beginning to really admire Han Sen. They all used to be
      soldiers, so they were familiar with the qualities and traits that it took
      to be a brilliant commander. But in regards to Han Sen, they had never
      seen someone command others so well, and in such a calm and informal
      manner. It was unbelievable.
