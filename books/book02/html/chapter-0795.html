    <p>
      After the match was over, Han Sen exited the virtual community. He thought
      battling other humans was fairly lame, and all-around boring; he viewed
      competition against the AI to be much more exciting. Until he could
      challenge a surpasser, it was a waste of his time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact that the match was considered boring was something that rocked
      the entire Hand of God community.
    </p>

    <p>
      A legendary, professional player God&#8217;s Third Hand was bullied into
      defeat with a final score of one hundred to nil. It was a shocker.
    </p>

    <p>
      A video of the match circulated virally, as everyone who saw it shared and
      passed it on. No matter who ended up watching it, they were amazed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But no one suspected Win A Girlfriend was cheating, and rightfully so.
      Cheats only allowed someone to speed up, and Han Sen&#8217;s hands were
      actually slower than his opponent&#8217;s.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many Hand of God professionals analyzed the match, since the details of
      the match promised to bring the game into a new era.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, it was entirely believed to be a game of speed. After one
      match, it was revealed to everyone that it could be something more. No
      longer was it about collecting points through speed alone; now it was
      about prediction and foresight. And it was possible to play mind games on
      your opponent, and work to prevent your opponent from collecting their
      points.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new era began, and this match was officially documented as a guide and a
      showcase for players. And so, as it was handed out more and more, it
      became even more widely-known.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people wanted to uncover the identity of the enigmatic Win A
      Girlfriend. Some teams and organizations even placed a bounty for any
      concrete information that could aid in the discovery of who the player
      truly was. But after time elapsed, with no progress in such
      investigations, the trail went cold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen no longer had any interest in playing Hand of God. He decided to
      return to the sanctuary, since the sensing abilities of his dongxuan aura
      were almost on par with his Jadeskin&#8217;s eighth sense. He believed by
      now, he had what it took to overcome Falsified-Sky Sutra, and thus, Han
      Sen wanted to find Luo Yin again. He wanted to see if he could
      well-and-truly beat the Falsified-Sky powers.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Luo Yin was not there, so he reverted back to his original plan—the
      one that led him to encounter Luo Yin in the first place. Han Sen returned
      to the Emerald Lake, in the hope he could find the dinosaurs that had been
      said to reside there—the parent and child.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they did not live together, then Han Sen thought he had a fair chance
      of killing them.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the silver fox had eaten the second-generation Devil-Eye Spider, it
      seemed to have grown up quite a bit. Its energy flow had almost reached
      the same level as the fairy&#8217;s. While these changes occurred on the
      inside, little happened to its exterior. It looked practically the same as
      it always had, so it didn&#8217;t seem as if it was yet an adult.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pulled out the corpse of the silver-winged butterfly, and the
      silver fox&#8217;s eyes began to shine towards it. The silver fox hopped
      onto Han Sen&#8217;s hand in the hopes of swallowing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen suddenly pulled back his hand. He looked at the silver fox and
      said, &#8220;Little Silver, I treat you better than I would my own son. I
      give you everything. If you ever think to betray me, I will never forgive
      you. Do you understand?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox used its head to rub Han Sen, as saliva drooled from its
      mouth into the fabric of his clothes.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen put his hand down, the silver fox leapt off and gobbled up
      the butterfly in a second-flat. Its body seemed to shake and tremble
      afterwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Silver lightning suddenly burst forth from it, like silk. This static silk
      crackled and weaved its way around to encase the silver fox in a silver
      cocoon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to watch the cocoon and took a surprised
      notice of the chaotic energy that swirled inside. It was like a volcano,
      preparing to erupt at any second.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is it finally growing up?&#8221; Han Sen felt relieved. He was
      worried that even after eating the silver butterfly, there&#8217;d be no
      change. If so, Han Sen hadn&#8217;t a clue how much longer it would take.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know how long it would take for the silver fox to finish
      its time inside the cocoon, either, but he didn&#8217;t fancy waiting
      around. So, he stuffed the cocoon inside his pack and resumed his journey
      to the Emerald Lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Emerald Lake sparkled green, and all you could see was the green
      unspoiled surface reflecting the sky above. It was a gorgeous view to
      behold. Upon reaching the lake, Han Sen walked around its length but did
      not find a single super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      He used his dongxuan aura to scan the water. He could only scan up to a
      depth of about ten meters, despite how deep it truly was. As a result, he
      was unable to find anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, have you come here looking for dinosaurs? A bunch of us
      have established a camp and with a fire, and we&#8217;re having a
      barbeque.&#8221; A man appeared and greeted Han Sen, inviting him to join
      in the festivities.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was rare to see a man so passionate and welcoming, so Han Sen did not
      hesitate to oblige and take a seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      They spoke together for some time, and Han Sen learnt the group was a
      bunch of friends that composed a squad. They all knew each other back in
      the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, but they all happened to be sent to the
      same region in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Such an occurrence was
      highly unlikely, and so, they took it as a sign that they should form a
      team. Passing by this lake, they had heard the tales of a dinosaur
      supposedly inhabiting the place. Therefore, they decided to stop for a
      while and scope the place out.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had been camping at the same spot for two days, but alas, they
      hadn&#8217;t seen anything out of the ordinary.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Which squad are you from?&#8221; Liu Yunyi asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My squad is a bit special; it is not appropriate for me to discuss
      their affairs here.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A special team, huh? Has anything interesting hit the airwaves? Is
      there any juicy gossip you can share with us?&#8221; someone else asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as Han Sen was about to tell them a story, he heard watery splashes.
      Suddenly, the glassy surface of the lake was disturbed, and the tide that
      caressed the grassy skirt of the lake began to rise. A wave that was a few
      meters high was generated, and it quickly came in the direction of the
      camp. Under the force of the sudden tsunami, the fire was immediately put
      out and the tents were all ruined.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone, now drenched, looked out towards the lake. They saw something
      with the neck and head of a giraffe emerge from the water. This was much
      bigger than the dinosaur they had previously expected. Its body had to be
      over a hundred meters wide; it was ridiculous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Near the monster, a little version of itself lay. Its body was smaller, at
      only about ten meters wide. They both exited the waters and climbed upon
      the shore
    </p>

    <p>
      At the ghastly sight, Liu Yunyi and his team froze. It was rare to see
      creatures of such goliath proportions inhabiting a sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Boss, should we fight?&#8221; someone asked Liu Yunyi.</p>

    <p>
      Liu Yunyi smiled wryly and muttered, &#8220;Do you have a death wish?
      It&#8217;s huge! Our weapons would only be capable of tickling such a
      fiend. Its tail alone could wipe us out!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As their dialogue unfolded, Han Sen was already running towards the two
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      He used his dongxuan aura to scan them. The big one&#8217;s life force,
      although blurry, was incredibly strong. It was a first-generation super
      creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      The small one&#8217;s energy flow was running strangely, but that aside,
      it was clear. It was a second-generation super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was rare to find a second-generation super creature that was alone, and
      although the big one was beside it, Han Sen didn&#8217;t see a reason why
      he could not kill it.
