<p>“Is it a male or a female?” Han Sen looked at the Flower God in
the video. It looked somewhat like a very gorgeous human, but a
flower rose from its head. This flower was a violet.</p>
<p>“It is a male. In the Flower Gods, both the men and women look
very beautiful. Don’t think that Violet is weak because of his
beauty, however. He is actually very strong. He isn’t simple-minded
or easily influenced. I have contacted him before, and he is a
tricky guy to negotiate with,” Xie Qing King said.</p>
<p>“If he was easy to push around, I doubt the Flower Gods would
let him deal with such important matters. After all, this decision
will be a pivotal part of the Flower Gods becoming a higher race.
If they fail, their entire race could be destroyed. They need to be
careful with such matters.” Han Sen paused and then asked, “Which
race do the Flower Gods wish to replace?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet. The Flower Gods are being very careful, and
they don’t leak information easily. Judging from what others have
guessed, they would likely seek to take out the Tree Men that are
next to them. The Flower Gods and the Tree Men have been in
conflict for a long time, so they are already enemies. Furthermore,
the Tree Men have been doing poorly in recent times. It has been a
few hundred years since they had a deified in their race. They
aren’t exactly a powerful high race. They would be one of the
easier races to knock down a peg. There are a few other targets,
too…” Xie Qing King brought up all the information he had on the
subject.</p>
<p>“Do these high races not have any allies?” Han Sen asked,
tapping his lip in thought.</p>
<p>“Yes, but because they aren’t very strong, people don’t take
them seriously. Plus, the Flower Gods have connections with the
Ancient God. If they want to fight, it’s unlikely that others would
interfere.” Xie Qing King pointed out more information about
Violet. He then pointed at the man’s image and said, “Now, this guy
is the key that we need. All we need to do is convince him, and
then, we will be partnered with the Flower Gods and earn half of
Space Garden.”</p>
<p>Xie Qing King smiled at Han Sen and said, “The crystallizers
aren’t thought of as a strong race. I don’t think the Flower Gods
will worry too much about you completely overpowering them. And
then, all you need to do is use your power to impress Violet.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go there on your own?” Han Sen didn’t seem
satisfied.</p>
<p>“I wanted to go, but I’m not deified yet,” Xie Qing King
confessed hopelessly. He opened his palms.</p>
<p>“So, sometimes there are things you can’t do yourself?” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King stared back at Han Sen and said, “It isn’t that I
can’t. It’s that I can’t do it YET.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed on Xie Qing King’s planet for a few days. The
environment wasn’t too shabby. It was almost like heaven. If it was
a peaceful period, it wouldn’t be a bad choice to retire there for
good.</p>
<p>Every day, Han Sen used the Four Sheep Cube to access God’s
Farm. He was hoping to see Wan’er and God’s Knife again. But even
though a lot of time had passed, Han Sen had yet to see them
again.</p>
<p>It was strange. Han Sen was initially worried that if he used
the Four Sheep Cube, he would be thrown back to the Very High. But
now he noticed that no matter where he was, he would travel to
God’s Farm and then return to where he last used the cube.</p>
<p>With things like that, it also meant he had no way of returning
to the bottle world. If the Very High went to visit him, they would
learn that he had escaped.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen’s escape had already been discovered. A Very
High elder had planned to give Han Sen another full body checkup,
but when he went into the bottle world, he was unable to find Han
Sen.</p>
<p>This surprised the Very High a lot. Han Sen had escaped from
their alpha hall without anyone noticing. As far as they were
concerned, this was very bad.</p>
<p>But the Very High now believed someone must have helped Han Sen.
Otherwise, how could he have escaped? Exquisite was initially their
prime suspect, since she had done it once before. But after a
thorough investigation, they realized that it couldn’t have been
Exquisite.</p>
<p>After confirming that it wasn’t Exquisite, matters became more
complicated. They believed there was a traitor in the Very High
that their investigation had failed to uncover.</p>
<p>“He really escaped.” Exquisite was more shocked than any of the
other Very High. She hadn’t believed Han Sen when he insisted that
he would get out on his own. But a short time after she had last
seen him, Han Sen had done as he promised. This was quite
unbelievable.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been imprisoned by the Very High, the top race in
the universe. Not even true god elites could escape from the alpha
hall once they were trapped there. She couldn’t imagine how Han Sen
had managed to do what he had done.</p>
<p>The Very High tried to predict where Han Sen might go, and they
used some special geno arts of deduction, but they were unable to
catch his trail. They hadn’t the faintest trace of a clue as to
where he had fled. That made the Very High even more certain that
there was a traitor in their midst. If there wasn’t a traitor, Han
Sen would have been tracked down by now, they believed.</p>
<p>Han Sen, in the meantime, had just been introduced to Violet of
the Flower Gods. The guy looked just as he had in the hologram. The
man was so pretty that he could make a country fall.</p>
<p>But a pretty face like that didn’t influence Han Sen much. He
felt like Violet was too soft, and it gave him the impression that
the man was actually a toxic snake. Soft on the exterior, but
filled to the brim with evil and poison.</p>
<p>“The prettier the snake is, the more toxic it is. I wonder how
dangerous this Violet truly is?” Han Sen wondered to himself.</p>
<p>“You said Violet hosted a banquet and invited many deified
elites from all sorts of races? What does that mean?” Han Sen
lowered his voice to ask Xie Qing King next to him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Xie Qing King fell silent, and then he said,
“Maybe he wants to put the cooperation up as an auction, and have
deified elites compete with each other. See who comes up with the
highest price and what-not.”</p>
<p>“No way. That would be ridiculous. This decision will decide the
fate of the whole race of the Flower Gods. They can’t host an
auction for something this serious unless the people in charge of
the Flower Gods are absolutely nuts.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>“In that case, I don’t know. Aside from that, I can’t really
think of a reason that they would bring so many deified elites
together. Contacting them via private means would be more
beneficial.” Xie Qing King really didn’t understand much about
politics.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He saw a few people he already knew.
There was Dragon One from the Dragons, and Dia Robber from the
Destroyed. Bai Wanjie from the Extreme King. Even Lone Bamboo was
there. And there were many other deified elites Han Sen did not
know.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Space Garden is a juicy morsel for a lot of
races.” There were so many competitors, Han Sen didn’t think he
would be the one to be contracted.</p>
<p>“These big races are like hungry wolves circling prey. The
Flower King might not want to cooperate with them. We still stand a
chance.” Although Xie Qing King said that, seeing people like that
all around, he knew how important the Space Garden was to everyone.
It had exceeded his expectations, and he knew it wouldn’t be an
easy prize to win.</p>
