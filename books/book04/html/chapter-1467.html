      The minor issue mentioned by the green-clothed woman was a berserk super
      creature guarding the spirit statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green-clothed woman could send Han Sen to the spirit hall with ease,
      but Han Sen would have to slay the beast in order to grab the stone that
      was embedded in the statue’s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to her, the berserk super creature had resided in the shelter
      since before the Elysium elders perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, the berserk super creature had only become stronger and
      stronger. Its power was immense, and with that thing guarding the spirit
      statue, Han Sen didn’t fancy his chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after inquiring about the berserk super creature’s powers and
      abilities, he wasn’t entirely sure whether or not if he should agree.
    </p>
    <p>“Let me think about it.” Han Sen didn’t reject the offer outright.</p>
    <p>
      “You don’t have much time to dwell on this. When Gu Qingcheng returns,
      this opportunity will be gone,” the woman said.
    </p>
    <p>“Just let me think for a moment.” Han Sen was still not convinced.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was smart. He knew the limits and extent of his own capabilities
      well. He knew squaring-off against a berserk super creature for a spirit
      stone was a fool’s errand for someone of his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way Han Sen would be able to grab the spirit stone was if he
      entered the spirit hall completely undetected and remained out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green-clothed woman did not rush Han Sen to make a decision. “Do you
      know what Gu Qingcheng went to do?”
    </p>
    <p>“Do you know?” Han Sen knew she was being rhetorical.</p>
    <p>
      The woman said, “You have entered the geno core storage, haven’t you? Do
      you know about the geno core battleground?”
    </p>
    <p>“Of course.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
    <p>
      “There are two different types of geno core battlegrounds. You have only
      seen one. There is another type that requires a special geno core storage
      to enter,” the woman explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you saying Gu Qingcheng went to another geno core battleground? What
      is she doing there?” Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman quietly told him, “It is called Geno Battleground, but this one
      is a battleground for combatants to claim the geno cores of others.”
    </p>
    <p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
    <p>
      “The demigods that enter this battleground can kill their opponents and
      claim their geno cores. Geno cores grow quickly in that place, and they
      can level up quite fast,” the green-clothed woman said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s a place like this? How can I get there?” Han Sen asked with
      shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To enter a Geno Battleground, you first need an access point for the geno
      core storage. But it has to be a special geno core storage access point.
      Gu Qingcheng left so she could modify her own geno core storage to allow
      this. When I wake up, she will force me into this battleground and make me
      level up quickly.”
    </p>
    <p>“Does this benefit her in any way?” Han Sen asked quietly.</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know, but you are my priest and you must go with me. There is a
      high chance you will be killed in such a place,” the woman said.
    </p>
    <p>“Why? I think you’re weaker than me.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
    <p>
      The green-clothed woman rebutted, “If I die in there, I can revive via my
      spirit stone. If you die, you die. How’s that for a comparison?”
    </p>
    <p>“I understand.” Han Sen bore a wry smile and shook his head.</p>
    <p>
      “If you don’t want to be forced into the Geno Battleground, this is the
      only way to avoid that. If you take my spirit stone, I will help you
      escape Elysium Shelter,” the woman said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But there is a berserk super creature there. Even if I did grab your
      spirit stone from the statue, getting out would be a different matter
      entirely. When I take the stone, you won’t be able to control the shelter
      anymore. You won’t be able to zap me out, and I’ll have that berserk super
      creature breathing down my neck.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who said I can’t? If I can’t do something that simple, what’s the point
      of me being referred to as a holy child?” The volume of her voice dropped
      then, and she said, “I have an escape route. Grab the stone, and I’ll get
      you out of that hall.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me think about it.” Although Han Sen was tempted, he didn’t entirely
      believe her. They were still practically strangers, and Han Sen didn’t
      know her too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wimp,” the woman said, then stopped talking. Her mood soured, and she
      looked mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen cared little about upsetting her, though. He would rather go to
      the Geno Battleground to level up his geno core than risk his life by
      infiltrating the spirit hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next few days, though, she tried many times to convince Han Sen
      to change his mind and get the spirit stone for her. He eventually ignored
      all mentions of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew Han Sen was not willing to risk this for her, and her attitude
      eventually took a turn. After a while, she ignored him completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gu Qingcheng returned and noticed that Han Sen had actually stayed in
      the garden, she smiled. “You didn’t disappoint me. You really are the heir
      of Han Jinzhi. You two might always lie to others, but you never allow
      yourselves to be tricked, either.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My grandfather is Han Jinzhi, but he was only a small officer. He’s not
      the one you keep referring to.” Han Sen sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had picked up on one thing for sure; something had happened
      between Han Jinzhi and Gu Qingcheng. That was why Gu Qingcheng didn’t like
      Han Sen very much. It probably boiled down to him being a descendant of
      Han Jinzhi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng looked at Han Sen with disdain and said, “Don’t talk crap.
      That old fox might be able to fool others, but I’m the only one he never
      could. You didn’t get tricked by the holy child into doing something
      stupid, however. Not bad.”
    </p>
    <p>“You know she is awake, don’t you?” Han Sen asked Gu Qingcheng.</p>
    <p>
      She nodded and said, “It is best not to believe anything she says.
      Otherwise, you’ll end up dead before you know it, without a clue how it
      came about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, what were you doing while you were away from the shelter?” Han Sen
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Modifying the emperor class geno core storage. I required a rare geno
      component. I was the only one in Elysium Shelter who could retrieve it.”
      Gu Qingcheng actually looked happy. “The geno core storage’s modifications
      should be finished soon. Then, you may enter with the holy child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least the woman in the painting didn’t lie about this,” Han Sen
      thought to himself.
