  Han Sen had already been tempted to do that. After hearing Qin Xiu’s last words, it made him completely give up his fleeting thoughts of actually conceding.

This was what Han Sen’s personality was like. If things went his way, he was a pleasant person to talk to. Qin Xiu’s last words were very threatening, so it made him stop wanting to concede.

“Sorry, I already told you I don’t follow monsters,” Han Sen said. “By the way, that includes you.” “That’s fine. You will follow me sooner or later. First, you must live for that day.” After Qin Xiu said that, he turned around and left.

“Bury Path God, come and guide me around the God Chaos Party. Show me what it’s like these days.” Qin Xiu’s voice went into Bury Path God’s ears. Bury Path God had his freedom again. “Yes.” Bury Path God’s emotions had calmed down completely by now. It was unknown what was going through his mind. He stood up without emotion, followed Qin Xiu, and departed.

“The black crystal armor left me after all.” Han Sen’s face looked weird as he spoke.

The crystal armor had been with him since it was a crystal, and it had helped him out of many jams. Without the black crystal armor, it was like Han Sen would not have come as far as he had.

Unfortunately, anything in life could leave, so Han Sen did not think too much about it. Even still, Han Sen did not plan on leaving the black crystal armor just like that.

“That black crystal armor never belonged to me, but it never belonged to you either, Qin Xiu. You are powerful now, so you can take it away. One day, I am going to take it back.” Han Sen was calm. He stopped thinking about the black crystal armor and all the matters pertaining to Qin Xiu. His body was just like how Qin Xiu said it was. It was not in a good state. He brutally reversed the Dongxuan Sutra. That alone dealt a lot of damage to Han Sen. The so-called reversal was not just about running it in reverse.

It was like the Blood-Pulse Sutra and the Xuan Yellow Sutra. The two of them had differences. They both had their bases, so it was not just a simple case of reversing the opposite to go.

Han Sen had brutally reversed it by mistake. It was because he had been forced to. That was why Han Sen did it.

The reverse Dongxuan Sutra had already damaged him a lot. Now, the power of the Dongxuan Sutra was combined with it. It did not combine, and it had a conflict. It made Han Sen’s body endure significant damage.

The two of the powers were no longer in Han Sen’s control. It was like there was a raging flood that had come about in the breaking of a dam. It was everywhere in his body.

The worst thing about it was that he had been suppressed by Dust Sky. That meant Han Sen’s power had decreased, but the power he had lost had not been decreased. Han Sen could not control this situation.

That was why Qin Xiu had told him that if he had not saved Han Sen, he would have died.

There was one thing Han Sen knew for sure. There was another type of willpower inside the black crystal armor. It was the “her” Qin Xiu had referenced. In the past, it was her will to control the black crystal armor. Qin Xiu should not have been able to know what was going on at that time.

Otherwise, Qin Xiu would have known that Han Sen had taken care of Wan’er for quite some time. With his connection to Wan’er, he would not allow Han Sen to die.

Han Sen knew if he said things like that, there was an 80% to 90% chance that Qin Xiu would have saved his life.

It was a shame that Han Sen was not that type of person. He knew what things were like, but he would never ask for help.

Han Sen held onto the pain his body was suffering, trying to put the two powers back on the right track. His power was too weak. All of the power in his body was going to the lowest point. He could not deal with the two powers that had lost their control.

“Controlling two powers seems impossible. If I use my leftover powers to make a bet, maybe I can separate these two powers. As long as they do not collide with each other, perhaps there is something I can do to soothe things.” Han Sen was not someone who gave up easily. He was trying to find a way to fix these difficulties he was having. Han Sen quickly realized that way did not work. Two powers were all over his body. Even if Han Sen used his leftover power to attack, he could not separate those two powers.

“If there is no going back, I will have no choice but to push on through to the worst possible point and start all over again.” Han Sen was angry. He used the last of his power to do a final push. The two powers were running. Han Sen did not know what would happen, but he knew that those two powers were not going to stop.

The Dongxuan Sutra’s power was scarier than Han Sen had imagined. The primary Dongxuan Sutra power was familiar to him with its most basic rules, and the reverse Dongxuan Sutra created a completely different power.

Because he could not control it, Han Sen still did not know what kind of power it had. Looking at it based on the damage done to his body, it was evidently far scarier than the ordinary Dongxuan Sutra.

Bao’er looked at Han Sen with immense worry. She sensed that Han Sen’s situation was not a favorable one. She did not dare disturb him. She did not want to distract him from the issues he wrestled with.

Han Sen used the last ounce of his power to collect himself. The powers of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, Xuan Yellow Sutra, Jadeskin, and The Story of Genes were used.

Although they were badly weakened, this had already come to pass. He used as much as he could, fighting it in a life-or-death moment.

Suddenly, a weird mark appeared on Han Sen’s body. It was Spell. She wanted to combine with him. It combined with him through the armor mode.

Han Sen’s face, which looked very sharp, appeared softer after combining with Spell. His hair and eyes turned white. His pupils and skin were put under some kind of spell.

He did not know if he was mistaken, but Han Sen felt as if Dust Sky’s power was now having less of an effect on him.

“Xenogeneic mode.” Han Sen gnashed his teeth and entered Xenogeneic mode. This was a mode in which four geno arts could combine into one. Aside from his Super God Spirit mode, that was Han Sen’s strongest form.

Because the Xuan Yellow Sutra had appeared, he had already made his four geno arts unbalanced. Now, because of the Dongxuan Sutra’s loss of balance, the two main and reverse powers collided together. He did not know what that meant for him in xenogeneic mode.

At this point, Han Sen could not worry too much about it. He had to use every power he had to give it a shot.

When Han Sen’s body totally entered Xenogeneic mode, he felt his body’s power explode. It was like the pulses of his body were all exploding. It was like his body had a fireworks party going on inside him.

Even with Han Sen’s tough will, he could not help but shout. He had to express how much pain he was in.

Perhaps it was because Han Sen’s threshold of endurance had reached the max it could go, but his body reacted. He entered Super God Spirit mode, but the pain did not go away because of it. It made him hurt even more.

Han Sen was under Super God Spirit mode now. He had a body of white light. He suddenly heard a crack. He had never experienced something like this in Super God Spirit mode before.
