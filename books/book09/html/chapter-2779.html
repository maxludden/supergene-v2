<p>Han Sen had noticed the same thing. Violet was the only Flower
God they had seen this entire time. The only other people around
them were members of other races. Since being in the Space Garden,
they had yet to see a single other Flower God.</p>
<p>This was the home of the Flower Gods. Even if something had
happened, they still should have been encountering other members of
Violet’s race.</p>
<p>Everyone had warning sirens blaring in their heads. They
followed Violet carefully as they flew through the Space Garden,
but they didn’t see anything dangerous around.</p>
<p>And there was no sign of a battle, either. It looked as if
nothing concerning had actually happened.</p>
<p>But when they reached the highest flower field, what they saw
froze them in place.</p>
<p>They saw many men and women with their bodies buried in the
field. Only half their heads were sticking up above the soil. Each
of them had a flower on their heads. Some of them were peonies, and
some looked like chrysanthemums. Each flower was unique, and they
all looked like they were opening in bloom.</p>
<p>Clearly, the people who looked like carrots in the flower fields
were the missing Flower Gods.</p>
<p>“Violet, what is this?” Bai Wanjie asked Violet.</p>
<p>The Flower Gods buried in the ground were still alive, but they
were as still as half-buried vegetables.</p>
<p>Ever so slowly, their lifeforces seemed to be waning.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to lie to you, Mr. Crown Prince. The whole of the
Flower Gods, myself excluded, are here,” Violet said as he pointed
at the half-buried heads in the field.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie didn’t ask how the Flower Gods had ended up in such a
strange situation. Instead, he asked Violet, “Before you left the
Space Garden, were they already buried this way?”</p>
<p>“You are very smart, Mr. Crown Prince.” Violet nodded and
admitted this to be the case.</p>
<p>“So, when you said that the Flower Gods wanted to become a
higher place, it was all a lie? A trick that you used to lure us
here?” Bai Wanjie asked, staring at Violet.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Violet nodded again. He clearly didn’t intend to hide
anything.</p>
<p>Violet and Bai Wanjie just stared at each other. They didn’t
look away. Violet went on to say, “Although I lied about the cause,
I truly intend to offer you the prize that I promised. If any of
you can save my people, we are willing to sign a contract that will
offer up half of the Space Garden.”</p>
<p>“Is that true?” Everyone’s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>“You guys have seen what has happened to the Flower Gods. Do you
think we have the gall, let alone the power, to break our promise?”
Violet drawled. He wasn’t in a hurry.</p>
<p>“What happened to your people? Can you explain it to us now?”
Bai Wanjie looked at the heads protruding from the flower
fields.</p>
<p>The fields were indescribable. Flower Gods were planted in the
soil as far as the eye could see. There were millions of them. And
with the small flowers rising from each head, they looked so
pretty.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter how pretty they were, though. They were
half-buried in the soil, which made the whole scene rather
disturbing.</p>
<p>Violet was no longer trying to withhold information. For the
first time since they had met him, Violet explained what happened
completely.</p>
<p>The Flower Gods were good at gardening, and they had discovered
the Space Garden long ago. It was a suitable place for many
xenogeneic plants to grow. They thought they had lucked out, but
they soon found out that there was something wrong with the
xenogeneic space.</p>
<p>The leader of the Flower Gods buried himself in the flower
fields, just like Han Sen and the others were seeing now.</p>
<p>The Flower Gods didn’t know why their leader did that, but they
eventually figured out what was going on. They needed to appease
the garden itself. Every once in a while, they would bring
sacrifices to the garden. That way, the garden would no longer mess
with their minds. As long as they kept the garden satisfied, it
wouldn’t force any of the Flower Gods to bury themselves.</p>
<p>But as time went by, the Space Garden seemed to become hungrier.
It required more xenogeneics to support itself. Two months ago, the
sacrifice that they buried in the flower fields was useless. The
Flower God leader and many elites suddenly dug holes in the field
and buried themselves there.</p>
<p>Aside from Violet, every Flower God was now buried there.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you guys bury yourselves as they did?” asked a small
race deified as he looked on Violet with suspicion. Clearly, he
didn’t believe the tale that Violet was spinning.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Only I was okay. I don’t feel any danger. And I
don’t know why this happened. That is why I am begging you all to
save my people. We will never turn back on our word,” Violet said
with a look of seriousness.</p>
<p>“Have you tried digging them out?” a King class elite asked.</p>
<p>That question was kind of pointless. The Flower Gods had been
buried there for a while. Violet must have tried everything
already. Violet would only have contacted outside deifieds if he
had no other choice. He had exhausted all of his options.</p>
<p>“I can’t dig them up. The soil might seem normal, but it is
incredibly durable. You cannot dig through this land, and you might
even hurt the people in the soil,” Violet answered.</p>
<p>One of the elites tried to grab a handful of the soil. The eyes
of everyone watching widened. The Kings, and even the deifieds,
couldn’t summon enough power to rip out a chunk of that turf.</p>
<p>“What kind of soil is this? Why is it so resilient?” a King
class elite asked in shock.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. When they dug the holes to bury themselves, it
didn’t seem that difficult. But when I tried digging them out, I
couldn’t dislodge even a tiny piece of the ground…” Violet
explained the situation to them once.</p>
<p>The elites tried many tests, but each attempt to crack this
puzzle failed. They were unable to free the denizens of the flower
fields.</p>
<p>Many of the elites focused on the task with feverish intensity.
They thought of all kinds of methods, trying to get the half-buried
Flower Gods out. But their efforts accomplished nothing. All of
their attempts were fruitless.</p>
<p>One deified elite even grabbed a Flower God by the head. The
Flower God’s neck almost broke, and he still didn’t move an
inch.</p>
<p>The elites were there to save people, not kill them. So, the
deified elite stopped trying to yank the head out.</p>
<p>“San Mu, what do you think is going on here?” Xie Qing King
turned and asked Han Sen. He didn’t know what to make of the
half-buried Flower Gods.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit creepy, to say the least.” Han Sen squinted slightly
as he spoke. He was checking out those half-buried Flower Gods, but
he seemed to notice something.</p>
<p>“Weird. It’s almost like the entire Space Garden is giving off a
lifeforce… What if the Space Garden itself is a giant creature?”
When Han Sen came up with an answer, it was something that not even
he could believe.</p>
