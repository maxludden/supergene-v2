	<h3>Chapter 2582</h3>

	<p>The monster was like a fighting machine. It could rotate 360 degrees in a moment, and it could release tentacles
		from any part of its body. The tentacles could weave themselves together to create whatever weapon or defense
		best suited the needs of its fight.</p>

	<p>The scariest thing about it was that the tentacles were deified class. And the whole composition of the beast had
		a strong life power. No matter how many times it was struck, it could recompose itself. Facing such an opponent,
		Han Sen and the little red bird weren’t sure what to do.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the bird were attacking the monster together, but they were at a disadvantage.</p>

	<p>“Real deified xenogeneics are scary. Those fake deified xenogeneics in the core area are nothing compared to
		this.” Han Sen was shocked. He couldn’t think of a way in which they could defeat this foe. An idea occurred to
		him, and he summoned his Six Core Snake Bow. He didn’t have any deified arrows for it, so he had to summon a
		King class arrow beast soul. He placed the arrow on the Six Core Snake Bow and pulled the string.</p>

	<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>

	<p>The moment Han Sen let the arrow fly, the Six Core Snake Bow’s six wheels spun. The arrow was imbued with a
		strange power, and it immediately disappeared.</p>

	<p>When the arrow appeared again, it was in front of the monster. It soared right into the eye upon the monster’s
		forehead.</p>

	<p>“The Six Core Snake Bow gives space power to the arrows it shoots!” Han Sen realized with pleasure.</p>

	<p>That meant every arrow the Six Core Snake Bow fired would teleport. That was better than Han Sen’s skill for
		drilling arrows. When people were shot by an arrow from this bow, they wouldn’t be able to trace its path toward
		them.</p>

	<p>Plus, Han Sen was also able to tell that the arrow could tear through the fabric of space. That was the power the
		Six Core Snake Bow could imbue upon the projectiles he used with it.</p>

	<p>The King class beast soul arrow received enough of a buff from the Six Core Snake Bow to pierce through the
		monster’s eye. Half the arrow embedded itself firmly in the eye, and blood sprayed out around it.</p>

	<p>“This is a nice bow,” Han Sen thought happily. The bow’s power was perfect for Han Sen.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen didn’t stay happy for long. Tentacles grew from the injured monster’s eye. The tentacles wrapped
		around the beast soul arrow and removed the power Han Sen had given to the projectile. Then the monster pulled
		out the beast soul arrow and cracked it.</p>

	<p>That injured eye was covered by tentacles and swiftly healed.</p>

	<p>“Is the monster’s entire body made of silk?” Han Sen wondered.</p>

	<p>Quickly, Han Sen’s guess was confirmed. He used his Six Core Snake Bow to strike the monster’s body. The same
		result was achieved. No matter where Han Sen fired, tentacles would appear and patch up the monster in no time
		at all.</p>

	<p>“I believe I can kill you.” Han Sen added his Turtle spell to the arrow in a bid to slow the beast down.</p>

	<p>The Turtle skill was applied to the monster. It managed to make the monster’s body slower, but Han Sen was soon
		surprised to learn that the monster could shed the parts of its body that contained Turtle. That removed the
		effects of the spell from the greater mass of the beast.</p>

	<p>Han Sen tried to apply the Turtle symbol in many different ways, but ultimately, it was ineffective. The monster
		was like a gecko that could keep reproducing its tail. This creature could cut off any part of its body to no
		negative effect.</p>

	<p>“This guy is more disgusting than Barr,” Han Sen said.</p>

	<p>The little red bird and Han Sen didn’t know what to do against the monster. The monster kept using its tentacles
		to form all sorts of different weapons to attack them. Some of its attacks changed weapons unexpectedly at the
		last moment.</p>

	<p>It could make knives, spears, swords, and sticks. It could also make shields and fists. The monster was like an
		invincible killing machine. It was giving Han Sen and the little red bird a headache.</p>

	<p>Gu Qingcheng and the others were helping the white tiger tackle all the smaller snakes, but things weren’t going
		so well for them either. More and more of those weird snakes slithered up onto the island. Their numbers were
		growing. Whenever the defenders killed one snake, two more took its place. Half the island was now wholly
		swarmed by the snakes.</p>

	<p>The white tiger suddenly meowed to the sky. Its cry was directed at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t understand what the white tiger wanted. The white tiger jumped and drilled into the ground. When
		it reappeared, it was one hundred miles away. Then, it called to Han Sen again.</p>

	<p>Han Sen now understood. It wanted Han Sen to follow it.</p>

	<p>Although Han Sen didn’t understand what the white tiger was thinking, he knew that fighting like this was futile.
		Even if he and the little red bird could survive, Fang Qing Yu and the others would likely be killed.</p>

	<p>“Bao’er, you drive! Follow it and let’s go.” Han Sen threw Bao’er into the white whale.</p>

	<p>Bao’er dropped through the air. When the ground came near, she flipped and landed softly upon the white whale.
		She hurried inside and fired it up, then piloted it toward the white tiger.</p>

	<p>Gu Qingcheng and the others fell back to the white whale as well. Han Sen and the little red bird kept fighting
		as they made their retreat. They wouldn’t allow the monster a chance to attack the white whale.</p>

	<p>The group of snakes was like a black ocean beneath the white whale. They destroyed everything in sight. The
		fairytale-like mushroom island was turned into a ruined, rocky crag.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the little red bird flew a great distance away from the monster, but it no longer seemed to be going
		after them. It started to gorge on the mushrooms now that it could do so uninterrupted.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the little red bird no longer provoked it. They flew next to the white whale to protect it. And as
		they did, they all proceeded to follow the white tiger.</p>

	<p>Their situation was a dire one. Food was now going to be a problem. The scariest thing was that the snakes and
		the monster were both issues that they had no idea how to solve.</p>

	<p>The white whale flew over the island. As they moved beyond the snakes, they saw the mushroom forest behind them
		get consumed.</p>

	<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s face grew pale as he looked at one snake among the writhing mass. After eating a lot of
		mushrooms, its body became larger. It swelled to ten times its previous size, and its body started to grow
		tentacles. It was like a smaller version of that goliath monster.</p>

	<p>“They aren’t snakes. They’re baby versions of that big one,” Han Sen and the others now understood. They looked
		quite glum.</p>

	<p>One monster was hard enough to deal with. If they all became monsters, it would be disastrous.</p>

	<p>And as everyone was trying to process the new information, a few more of the snakes grew bigger. They became just
		like the monster that was covered in tentacles. But their auras didn’t reach the horrifying level of the largest
		one just yet. They were King class, most likely, and almost as good as a half-deified.</p>

	<p>“Is this a joke?” one the pirates mumbled in shock.</p>

	<p>No one answered him, and that was because no one knew what it was.</p>

	<p>The white tiger kept running through the mushroom forest, but if the white whale started to lag, it would stop
		and roar up at them. It went back to running when they caught up. It was like it was leading them someplace.</p>
