  Miss Mirror hadn’t thought Han Sen’s mind was strong, and the unexpected depth of his consciousness struck her with confusion.

It was as if she had received a mystery gift, and she had no idea who had delivered it or what it contained. After opening that special parcel, she only found another mystery box inside. She opened it, layer by layer, but there never seemed to be an end.

It didn’t matter if the gift deep inside the layers of the package was good or bad; opening a gift like this would make people angry.

Luckily, Miss Mirror was a very patient person, so she didn’t look annoyed. She peeled open Han Sen’s mind, layer by layer. But after doing this for a while, she still hadn’t found what lay at its center.

Not even God had enough patience to keep searching endlessly like that. After Miss Mirror peeled away all those layers, her inability to find the center was too much. She didn’t like feeling this way.

“I want to see what resides in your mind,” Miss Mirror thought in determination. Gathering herself, she leaned the full weight of her deified mind atop Han Sen’s mind to try to crack it open.

Spring Rain destroyed flowers. Han Sen’s will was like the center of a flower that was being forced open. One by one, the petals fell. But when the place covered by the petals was finally revealed, she found that it was empty.

“It’s only a shell, with nothing on the inside.” Miss Mirror felt rather disappointed.

Minds represented someone’s personality and the way they felt things. Han Sen’s mind was very strong on the outside, but its interior was hollow. Therefore, he couldn’t be considered someone strong.

Miss Mirror wanted to pull her mind back since she was done investigating, but suddenly, she couldn’t.

She had opened Han Sen’s mind using brute force. A normal mind would have been shattered by such an act. There shouldn’t have been left a trace of that mind left.

But Miss Mirror could still detect Han Sen’s mind with her own will. That was unexpected.

The mind moved. Miss Mirror’s eyes lowered, and she looked at all of the petals across the floor. Every petal was like a crystal. They were scattered across the floor, but they weren’t damaged.

The will that Miss Mirror had detected invaded one of the petals, and as it did, Miss Mirror’s eyes widened. She had only wanted to peel away the petals to see what was on the inside. She hadn’t bothered to look at the petals themselves.

The mind entered the petal, and suddenly, that consciousness was like a rolling, storm-shaken sea. It was as wide as a sky and as deep as an ocean. The mind was so rich that Miss Mirror staggered under the detailed sensation of it.

Miss Mirror bent and picked up another petal. The will was like a mountain crashing down. It was like a pillar that held up the sky, never moving.

If she was a novel, this man would be a grand saga.

A man could define himself as a broken, sick, elderly man on his deathbed, or as the warrior who threw himself into the thick of battle when he was young.

People only focused on results. Wins and losses determined all, and rarely did people pay attention to what led up to those places. People often failed to see the desperation and difficult times men have to face frequently. Endurance and bravery abound in the hearts of men.

Everyone fails sometimes, but real men get up and keep going despite their losses. No matter what environment they are in or what happens to their bodies, the only thing that can’t be changed is the wants and desires of their hearts. They want victory, with the determination to win is greater than anything.

Han Sen’s will didn’t have a core because real men have no end. Ambitions grew continually, stretching out beyond the reaches of space and time. Forward. Forward. And forward again until their time of death.

Han Sen wasn’t looking to climb the highest mountains. He wanted to go further and higher. His ambitions had no end. Infinity went on forevermore.

Miss Mirror didn’t see the core of Han Sen’s mind, but every petal was what Han Sen had experienced. There was anger, happiness, sadness, endurance, sensations of sea, and sky, and earth.

Perhaps one single mind didn’t make Han Sen better than Miss Mirror, but by observing all of those petals and understanding them, Miss Mirror couldn’t help but feel awed.

Suddenly, Miss Mirror raised her head. She realized she was trapped inside Han Sen’s mind. His emotions were affecting her mood.

“I cannot stay in a place that bothers my heart,” Miss Mirror said with an implacable face. She summoned her Spring Rain mind, wanting to destroy the mirror where Han Sen had sent his will. She didn’t want her own will to be affected.

Ten thousand petals were destroyed by her mind, but Miss Mirror soon found out that when the petals were destroyed, they fell to the ground like seeds. New flowers then opened.

No matter how Miss Mirror’s mind raged or how she tried to destroy Han Sen’s will, the flowers grew. She couldn’t destroy them, only spread them further.

“Why is this happening?” Miss Mirror wondered, stupefied. She couldn’t remain calm. She couldn’t completely destroy Han Sen’s mind. It was an impossible task.

She was a deified elite. Her mind was one of the strongest in the whole of the Extreme King, and yet she couldn’t deal with Han Sen, who just a meager King. She couldn’t believe what was happening.

“Is his will really this strong?” Miss Mirror examined at her will, where flowers were half-opened. She looked at them strangely.

Ding!

Miss Mirror took a step back. She separated the two Mirror Spirit Eye Rings and looked right at Han Sen.

Miss Mirror discovered that her mind was melting quickly into Han Sen’s body. Seconds later, it was all gone. Even Miss Mirror could no longer feel it. The Mirror Spirit Eye’s mind that had been sent to Han Sen had been extinguished by him.

“Thank you, My Lady.” Han Sen opened his eyes and bowed before Miss Mirror.

Miss Mirror’s Spring Rain mind had allowed Han Sen to learn a lot, and he was very thankful for the opportunity.

When Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen, her expression was inscrutable. She didn’t say anything, and she merely departed.

When she returned to her room, Miss Mirror used many methods to try to erase Han Sen’s influence, but try as she might, she couldn’t. It greatly annoyed Miss Mirror.

“Am I not as good as a mere King?” Miss Mirror chewed her lip and tried to use her mind to erase the flowers that stood for Han Sen’s mind. Her efforts were futile. Those mind flowers had taken a firm root inside her mind. No matter how she tried to destroy them, the roots remained. They could keep growing again and again.

Flowers know the sea. Half-open and half-hidden. Wildflowers kept burning. The wind blew, and the process started again.

Miss Mirror’s crew had been working in the stone fields for five days, and after that time passed, something weird happened. A worker dug up a rock that was the size of a mortar and pestle. A few words were engraved on the side of the rock.

The two Marquises that dug up the rock read the text, and all of a sudden, they became Dukes.

Miss Mirror went out to the stone field with Red Cloud and brought the rock back to camp. After their second day examining the rock, the deified Red Cloud was reduced to King class overnight.
