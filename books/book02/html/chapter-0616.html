    <p>
      The lobster was directly behind Han Sen, with its pincers gnashing for his
      blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew he could no longer dodge, as he couldn&#8217;t afford to
      sacrifice the lead he had gained. If he couldn&#8217;t hold onto it,
      he&#8217;d be dead before he reached the surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      He clutched his chest as his blood boiled in the tension. Han Sen was only
      wearing his Fairy Queen armor, and he knew he couldn&#8217;t risk being
      hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his bird, two meters tall and with four wings, in front
      of him.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      The sacred-blood class Four-Winged Thunderbird was crushed into pieces by
      the lobster&#8217;s pincers. Han Sen used this time to reach the surface,
      summon his wings, and fly off into the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flying forty meters high, he suddenly heard a great splashing sound. The
      giant lobster leapt out of the sea and was now soaring through the air in
      a final bid to grab Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The speed of the berserk sacred-blood wings was not faster than the
      airborne lobster, and it was sure to catch Han Sen as he flew.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, Han Sen&#8217;s legs erupted with an incredible power. He borrowed the
      strength of the air and dashed two meters to the side. The pincer only
      just missed him.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The lobster fell back down, triggering a tsunami of a wave like a meteor
      crashing into the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without hesitating, Han Sen continued to fly higher and higher. The
      lobster swam around for a while, eyeing him, but after realizing it could
      no longer capture its intruder, it grabbed the peacock&#8217;s body and
      returned to the deep sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen flapped her wings with the silver fox in her arms. The silver fox
      didn&#8217;t seem to be doing so well, and looked incredibly week. When
      Han Sen returned to them, it leapt onto his shoulder and stayed there,
      unmoving.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen opened his mouth and coughed up blood. His organs had been damaged
      badly, and he feared it would take a long time to recover after this.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go.&#8221; Han Sen gritted his teeth as he held his chest, which
      pounded with an unbearable pain. He left the area with Queen and when they
      were clear, she summoned the whale so that Han Sen could lie down and
      rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was lying on the big whale&#8217;s back. The silver fox dug its
      head into Han Sen&#8217;s arms. He didn&#8217;t know what it was doing at
      first, but it wasn&#8217;t long before the silver fox pulled out his lotus
      roots. Immediately, the silver fox started chewing one up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Silver fox, you are heartless. I have been grievously wounded, and
      yet you rob me blind.&#8221; Han Sen was disheartened but he
      couldn&#8217;t muster the strength to yell at the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next second, Han Sen was frozen. After the silver fox chewed the lotus
      root, he did not swallow it for himself. Rather, he fed it to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised to see him not eat it for himself. He was feeding
      Han Sen, and it touched him deeply.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he did feel uncomfortable eating food that had been chewed up by his
      pet. He almost thought of rejecting it, but the lotus root had been ground
      into juice and it dribbled into Han Sen&#8217;s mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew he had risked his life to retrieve the lotus roots, so he
      thought it&#8217;d be a waste to spit it out. Without thinking about it
      too much, he accepted it all.
    </p>

    <p>
      After consuming it, he felt a refreshing and rejuvenating aura emanate
      from deep inside his body. The burning pain in his chest felt better and
      his pounding heart relaxed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly ran his Dongxuan Sutra. He absorbed this new, refreshing
      power. His Jadeskin was limited by his fitness level, which meant he could
      only unlock the first tier. Unlocking the second would be impossible
      during his time in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. That was why,
      recently, he had been more focused on improving his Dongxuan Sutra, as
      opposed to his Jadeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dongxuan Sutra had an amazing effect whilst you breathed, wherein the
      metabolism of cells ran quicker. Now, the damaged parts of his body were
      being renewed, and newborn cells replaced the old, harmed ones. It was
      enabling him to recover from his wounds much faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The refreshing air must have had a really effective power. Otherwise, his
      Dongxuan Sutra would not have healed him so well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every bit of his new, refreshed feeling was absorbed by the Dongxuan Sutra
      and his body now looked white and silky. He smelled like a newborn baby;
      he smelled good.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox lay down next to Han Sen, sniffing his master&#8217;s new,
      fresher scent. He seemed to enjoy it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen noticed the two lotus roots and immediately acknowledged where they
      came from. But seeing the silver fox feed Han Sen made her observe him
      with a greater curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earlier, Han Sen was heavily injured. His face looked ill and his skin was
      pale. But now, not long after, his face was looking better. The color of
      his complexion returned and his skin seemed to radiate. It was silky
      smooth, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Your face is white, but it looks a little red. It&#8217;s quite
      special.&#8221; Seeing Han Sen, Queen couldn&#8217;t help but say
      something cheesy. When she looked at Han Sen, she thought this new image
      suited him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face was rather firmly shaped and its structure was sharp.
      It often made him look mad, even when he wasn&#8217;t. But with this new
      smooth skin, it portrayed him in a different light. He gave off a
      different feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen felt a little jealous since she wasn&#8217;t a person who cared much
      about her appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This must be the effect of a hyper geno art. Or is it an effect of
      the lotus root?&#8221; Queen thought to herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, a pleasant fragrance tickled Queen&#8217;s nose. It made
      her feel as if she had eaten life fruit. The pores across her body all
      opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Queen looked at Han Sen with a
      puzzled expression. After she smelled the pleasant scent, the Heavenly Go
      in her body activated. It then seemed to be absorbing the fragrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen felt incredible. She had never guessed there was a smell that could
      trigger Heavenly Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      If she hadn&#8217;t been experiencing it at that moment, even if others
      told her, she would not have believed it to be true.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scariest thing with that smell, however, was how it seemed to be
      improving her Heavenly Go. It had been a long time since she made progress
      with the ability, yet now she was, entirely passively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although she did not know what was going on, she did not let this
      opportunity pass her by. She quickly sat down by Han Sen&#8217;s side and
      started absorbing as much of the smell as she could, to take her Heavenly
      Go even further.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purple light in her body continued to glow, absorbing the fragrance
      that was all around. Eventually, even her purple light seemed to smell
      good.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way Queen presented herself often made her seem cold, but now she
      became prettier to look at. She resembled a fairy, minus all the glitter.
      She looked stunning, like someone no one could ever dare dream of hurting.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lotus roots must have been extremely beneficial to women, and they
      possessed a rather cold trait. Although men benefitted from them, women
      would benefit more.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two lotus roots were most certainly not something ordinary. Their
      medical properties were incredibly strong. Han Sen absorbed them through
      his Dongxuan Sutra, and it helped his training a considerable amount.
