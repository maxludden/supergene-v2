<p>Exquisite sighed and said, “I have still been unsuccessful with
Very High Forget Love.”</p>
<p>“Auntie Exquisite, do you know this man?” The Very High young
man guard looked at Exquisite strangely.</p>
<p>“Of course, I recognize him,” Exquisite said as she looked at
Han Sen. “I did not think there was anyone who would not recognize
him.”</p>
<p>“After I came back, I have been witnessing many changes to this
place,” Han Sen said with a smile. “This place is almost
unrecognizable now. Exquisite, tell me, why are you in Space
Garden?”</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen smile, Exquisite smiled back. She replied, “Yes.
In the past two years that you have been gone, many things have
happened. The entire universe is not the same as it once was.
Compared to Outer Sky, more people seek to practice in Space Garden
instead. I am one such person.”</p>
<p>Exquisite was still holding onto something she did not want to
outright admit. The reason she went to Space Garden was not that
Space Garden was better than Outer Sky. It was because Han Sen was
the one who built the place. Yu Wu Shuang and the guards were
shocked when they saw Exquisite smile. Even the Very High student
did not believe she had that in her.</p>
<p>People like Exquisite, who had already taken their Very High
Sense to the max level and had Very High Forget Love, no longer had
emotions. They were supposed to be cold all the time. No one had
ever seen her behave like this before.</p>
<p>Yu Wu Shuang and the two guards felt very weird. They did not
know who that man in front of them was. Whoever he was, he could
make Exquisite display a joyful face.</p>
<p>While they were wondering about his identity, a gold shadow
flashed out of the city. A gold lion-like, big beast jumped in
front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>Yu Wu Shuang and the others were shocked. That gold shadow was
not very big, but they knew how scary of a creature it was.</p>
<p>Empty Mountain’s Mountain Leader, the only golden growler in the
universe, used to fight side-by-side with Dollar. Now, he was an
invincible existence in Space Garden.</p>
<p>Even the Extreme King, Very High, and Sky Palace elites were
terrified whenever they laid eyes on golden growler. But they were
just some small people.</p>
<p>Golden growler usually occupied a deep, faraway mansion. He
spent time with the Han family’s Ling’er. For some reason, he had
just come running from outside to jump at the mysterious man. Yu Wu
Shuang and the others were shocked.</p>
<p>Golden growler jumped at him. Even an elite of the universe
would have been half-dead through simple fear. The guards thought
the man was going to be instantly killed.</p>
<p>In the next second, their eyes opened wide. They could not
believe what they were seeing.</p>
<p>Golden growler jumped onto the man and put one of its front paws
on his shoulder. It started to lick the man in joy, swinging its
tail madly. It was like a big dog trying to earn the love of its
master.</p>
<p>“Who… Who is this man?” Yu Wu Shuang and the other two people
were absolutely confused.</p>
<p>Golden growler showing up had already shocked the elites.
Shortly after, an old man excitedly broke space to come and kneel
before Han Sen. “Master, you are back.”</p>
<p>Yu Wu Shuang and the two guards felt as if their lives had
suddenly been thrown into turmoil and challenge. That man, who
called himself Nine Thousand King, had always been difficult. He
was always very mean in Space Garden. Aside from Han Fei, Han
Ling’er, and a few other Han family members, he had a total lack of
respect for everyone.</p>
<p>One time when the Very High Leader visited, Nine Thousand King’s
nose was stuck up in the sky. He was completely uncaring for the
prestigious guest. It was like he could not be bothered dealing
with such a person.</p>
<p>At one point, he was such a scary existence. Now, that man was
kneeling profusely before Han Sen. It was hard to imagine.</p>
<p>“Old Nine, there is no need for all this.” Han Sen reached out
his hand and lifted Nine Thousand King’s body.</p>
<p>“Master, you are back.” More and more scary creatures appeared.
Flower God Leader was very excited.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu came running out with a hearty laugh. “Holy shit!
Old Han, are you back this soon? We are still planning on breaking
down the space barrier to come to fetch you.”</p>
<p>“Mister Dollar, you are back.” Finally, someone shouted Dollar’s
name.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Yu Wu Shuang was stunned into submission.
“Mister Dollar… He is Han Sen, the man who saved the world. He is
the master of Space Garden. I thought he died. Can creatures really
come back from</p>
<p>hell?”</p>
<p>The whole of Space Garden was bubbling like boiling water. The
news spread all over the Very High. Some of the high races quickly
received the news about the man who came back from hell.</p>
<p>“Good people do not live for long, and they harm for a thousand
years. That is correct.” In the Extreme King, Bai Qin, who had
already become king, looked into space and sighed.</p>
<p>“Finally, you are back.” In Blood Legion, Human King looked
quiet. He looked as if he was thinking about something.</p>
<p>“How could he come back so quickly? Has he already beaten the
system of reincarnation?” Amidst the Demons, the Demon Alpha
frowned. She looked confused.</p>
<p>Hearing the news that Han Sen had come back from hell, every
elite had a different reaction to the headline. Sky Palace Leader
laughed three times and then quietly mumbled, “The bad news is
bad.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard from Tang Zhenliu and the others that
Littleflower, Xie Qing King, and the others were already out near
Outer Sky’s Mirror Lake. When he asked for details of what was
going on there and heard what they had to say, he knew for sure
something had changed there.</p>
<p>“Dad.” Ling’er was like a little cat when she jumped into Han
Sen’s arms.</p>
<p>“My Little Ling’er, you have become more and more beautiful.”
Han Sen collected Ling’er and kissed her on the cheek. He suddenly
felt so successful about having a daughter.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are back.” Wang Yuhang had tears gushing from his
eyes when he saw Han Sen. This was still in the time Ling’er had
forced him to remain in Space Garden, which was something that made
him feel absolutely wretched.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen return, he felt as if he was a farmer that had
been suppressed but was now being rescued by the PLA.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, why do you look so terrible?” Han Sen looked at
Wang Yuhang with shock.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang wanted to tell him what happened and how difficult
things had been, but Ling’er was staring at him. He forced a smile
and said, “I… I have not slept well recently.” The little red bird
flew over too. It did somersaults around Han Sen as if it was
searching for something.</p>
<p>“Bao’er could not come back yet,” Han Sen said to the little red
bird.</p>
<p>The little red bird felt depressed. It landed atop Ling’er’s
head.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no choice. The Sky King Crown only allowed him and
him alone to return to the geno universe. On top of that, there was
a time limit. He could not bring Bao’er back with him.</p>
<p>When they went to the garden, there were only creatures around
who were very close to Han Sen. Tang Zhenliu asked, “Han Sen, how
did you get back here from the other side? Is there a way you can
get us to access there so we can go in and play?” “This time, I
have come back to talk to you about that. If the others have gone
to Outer Sky, though, we should go to Outer Sky first.” Han Sen
used Galaxy Teleportation to teleport everyone to Outer Sky.</p>
<p>Han Yan and the others had already learned about Han Sen’s
return, but they were still very excited to see the man in the
flesh.</p>
<p>Han Sen invited Very High Leader and Sky Palace Leader over too.
He told them about the God Chaos Party trying to break the 33
skies.</p>
<p>Very High Leader, Sky Palace Leader, and all the other elites
did not look so good after hearing about it. According to what Han
Sen was telling them, the elites of the universe of kingdoms were
far stronger than the elites of the geno universe. If the 33 skies
were punched through, bridging the geno universe, a disaster would
surely unfold.</p>
