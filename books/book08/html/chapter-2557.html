<p>Tang Ming’er had only just entered the sanctuaries, and although her geno arts weren’t bad, her genes hadn’t been reinforced. She was weak, and she couldn’t outrun the giant demon centipede. The centipede caught up within seconds.</p>

<p>Tang Ming’er held Littleflower as she dashed away, but the skies suddenly turned dark. An enormous shadow fell over the ground. Without looking up, she knew the giant demon centipede’s mouth was hanging agape over their heads.</p>

<p>“Why am I this unlucky? Does God envy smart people or something? Or is it because I, Tang Ming’er, am simply too smart?” Tang Ming’er thought to herself. It could be said that her disposition was gloomy, and that was putting it lightly.</p>

<p>Tang Ming’er was still pulling Littleflower’s hands as she ran. Seeing the open mouth of the giant demon centipede drawing close behind her, she threw Littleflower forward.</p>

<p>“Run!” she shouted.</p>

<p>Seeing that scary mouth draw so close, Tang Ming’er felt like she was about to dissolve in fear. After all, she was an underage girl. She kind of looked like Tang Zhenliu, but she had never encountered a near-death experience before. So, she was afraid.</p>

<p>Seeing the giant demon centipede mouth about to eat her, Tang Ming’er’s vision turned blurry. Then, she saw the giant demon centipede’s head hit the ground near her. Soil and grass sprayed everywhere. The creature’s head was inside a crater, and the boy with red lips and white teeth was standing atop the creature’s body.</p>

<p>Tang Ming’er’s eyes opened wide. She stared at the boy upon the giant demon centipede’s head. It was the boy she had been carrying moments before.</p>

<p>“Big Sister, are you okay?” Han Littleflower walked over to Tang Ming’er, looking worried.</p>

<p>Tang Ming’er had no clue how to compose herself. She just stared at Han Littleflower in utter shock. No other response came to mind.</p>

<p>She couldn’t believe this boy, who looked a few years younger than she was herself, was standing on top of a sacred-blood giant demon centipede. He made it look so easy.</p>

<p>“Big Sister, what’s wrong?” Han Littleflower saw that Tang Ming’er had frozen. He thought she was injured. He placed his hands on her forehead, preparing to inject power into her body and see where she might be hurt.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>As this happened, the giant demon centipede struggled to pull its head out of the soil. Tang Ming’er was scared again. She fell back.</p>

<p>“You scared Big Sister! Go apologize.” Han Littleflower turned around and glared at the giant demon centipede.</p>

<p>The giant demon centipede’s body shivered and shook. As Tang Ming’er watched with unbelieving eyes, the giant demon centipede lowered its body. It kept nodding toward Tang Ming’er as if it was begging for forgiveness.</p>

<p>“This… what is going on? Am I dreaming? Is this really the sacred-blood creature known as a giant demon centipede?” Tang Ming’er was frozen.</p>

<p>“Big Sister! Are you okay?” Han Littleflower ran in front of Tang Ming’er again and placed his hands on her forehead.</p>

<p>Tang Ming’er’s face blushed. She fell back and looked at him. “Who are you? No, are you human? Why would a demon centipede listen to you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Han Littleflower, and I am human. Didn’t I already tell you this?” He pointed at the giant demon centipede and said, “He can’t beat me. Of course he listens to me.”</p>

<p>“Han Littleflower… Your surname is Han? Are you related to Uncle Han Sen?” Tang Ming’er quickly asked.</p>

<p>“I’m his son. Have you seen my Dad?” Upon hearing his dad’s name get spoken, Littleflower became immeasurably happy.</p>

<p>“You are Uncle Han’s son? In that case, no wonder you can do this. My grandfather said anything can happen to the Han family, and that is because the Han family is so weird.” Tang Ming’er’s eyes were wide as she said, “I didn’t believe my grandfather’s words. I thought I was a genius, but you are so young and already this strong? What he was saying had to be true.”</p>

<p>“Big Sister, where are you going? I can take you where you need to go,” Han Littleflower said.</p>

<p>“Take me? How would you take me?” Tang Ming’er asked.</p>

<p>Han Littleflower took Tang Ming’er by the hand. He guided her over to the demon centipede’s head. Then, he pulled out a blanket from his bag. He asked Tang Ming’er to sit down on it. He brought out some fruit for her.</p>

<p>As the sun was setting, the giant demon centipede ran across the fields. Atop it was a boy and a young woman. The demon centipede ran fast, but it carefully maintained its stability to avoid disrupting the two it carried. It looked as if it was struggling to do that, though.</p>

<p>If the demon centipede was able to talk, it would probably have been crying something along the lines of, “Gee! Why am I so unlucky?”</p>

<p>Han Sen gulped down another King class xenogeneic gene. He had one hundred King class xenogeneic genes.</p>

<p>“I wonder how soon I’ll be able to become half-deified,” Han Sen mumbled to himself. He wanted to upgrade his Dongxuan Area.</p>

<p>At the same time, in the core area, no one dared to provoke him. He was depending on Consume and Big Destroyed to eat his King xenogeneic genes. His Dongxuan Area had reached the ninth tier. He only needed one more rank to transcend King class and become a half-deified being.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Han Sen was disappointed. Despite having one hundred King genes, his Dongxuan Area was refusing to level up.</p>

<p>“It looks like I need my power to break through the ninth tier and have it all return to one to become half-deified.” Han Sen had already guessed this might happen. Setting aside his disappointment, he used those one hundred King xenogeneic genes to level up Jadeskin instead.</p>

<p>Right now, Han Sen was looking very annoyed. The rate at which he was consuming his amassed genes was far outpacing the speed at which he was able to hunt more creatures and replenish his stock. His reserves were being depleted.</p>

<p>The core area had many King xenogeneics, but the place was so big that it took forever to travel between destinations. It could take him several days to find a single King xenogeneic.</p>

<p>For an ordinary King, that might have been a decent time. But for someone like Han Sen, that wasn’t nearly quick enough. He needed a shortcut.</p>

<p>“No, I must find more King xenogeneic genes,” Han Sen thought to himself. And as he spoke to himself, his mind started to rummage through a trove of different ideas that might enable him to collect vast swathes of King xenogeneic genes all at once.</p>

<p>The fastest way would be to hunt deifieds with Dragon One or someone else again. But if there really was a deified creature about, Han Sen would have preferred to kill it himself. Helping others wouldn’t really be worth it.</p>

<p>As Han Sen thought deeply about this problem, someone came hurrying over. The person moved in front of him to block his way.</p>

<p>“Barr?” When Han Sen saw Barr, he suddenly felt a headache coming on. He wasn’t afraid; he just thought the man was annoying.</p>

<p>“Han Sen, I’m going to lay it down straight for you. I want you to bless me. I can give you anything your heart desires in return for this,” Barr said, upon stopping in front of him.</p>

<p>“Okay. How about two thousand King xenogeneic genes?” Han Sen suggested, staring at Barr.</p>

<p>Barr was taken aback. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes was a big number.</p>
