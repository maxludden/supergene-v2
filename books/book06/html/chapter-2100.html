<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s eyes brightened. It looked as if he knew
what he wanted.</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s leader smiled at Han Sen. “Tell me. Whatever you
need! I see your Master Yisha as a genuine student, and you are my
student by extension. So, shirk any guilt and ask of me whatever
you desire.”</p>
<p>“Leader, I will not ask for much. I recently learned Suppress
Evil. The technique is quite amazing, and I would appreciate it if
you would help me progress further with it. I would like to learn
it faster.” Han Sen bowed.</p>
<p>Sky Palace leader stared at him in silence. He would never have
guessed that Han Sen would request this. This could be either be
very easy or very hard.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader had been asked to teach Suppress Evil to
Han Sen, but how much would Han Sen be able to learn? There were
eleven tiers to Suppress Evil, and many Sky Palace Kings had not
learned them. The Sky Palace leader couldn’t even guess how long it
might take to teach Han Sen this.</p>
<p>But he was the leader, and Han Sen had just asked to be taught a
skill. It would be bad form if he was unable to teach one geno art
to just one student.</p>
<p>Sky Palace leader went silent for a bit, and then said,
“Suppress Evil is a secret skill belonging to Sky Palace. It is
complicated. It is not something you can learn over the course of a
couple days. That being said, there is a riskier method that would
enable you to learn it far faster. Would you like to give it a
try?”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. The Sky Palace leader had put the ball back in
his court. The man said it was risky, but he did not mention how
risky. If Han Sen didn’t agree to the offer, then the blame for not
accepting the teaching would be at his feet.</p>
<p>Of course, if Han Sen agreed, he did not know the dangers he
might be walking into. He didn’t know if he could handle the
risks.</p>
<p>Han Sen went silent a little bit, and then he gritted his teeth.
“I would like to give it a try.”</p>
<p>“Good. You are definitely Yisha’s student. I have faith in you.
Go prepare and look for me on Hidden Path Island.” The Sky Palace
leader then waved his hand to dismiss Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen bowed and departed Sky Palace. On his way, he mulled
over why the leader might be sending him to Hidden Path Island.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Hidden Path Island was a restricted section of Sky
Palace. Without the leader’s permission, no one could go there. As
for what the place contained, he did not know. He’d have to find
out the next day.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not think the leader would put him through too
much harm. At the most, he thought the leader might only make him
endure a little bit of suffering. If accepting a little risk could
truly allow him to skip through five or six tiers of Suppress Evil,
it’d be well worth it.</p>
<p>That geno art was too complicated. If he learned it like normal,
it’d take him a few years to master it.</p>
<p>Before going to Hidden Path Island, Han Sen invited Lone Bamboo,
Thousand Feather Crane, and the Yun sisters for a meet up. He also
tried to find out more about where he was going.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang, hearing the leader would take Han Sen there, was
given a shock.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi immediately said, “Hidden Path Island is not a place
ordinary people can go to. King class elites are only permitted
there when they are on the cusp of leveling up. That place is
extremely dangerous. Many Kings have failed to level up there and
suffered grievous injuries in consequence. I can’t fathom why the
leader might want to take you there.”</p>
<p>The few of them told Han Sen what they knew about Hidden Path
Island. They did not know much, and more than anything, it sounded
as if it was just a place for Kings to level up.</p>
<p>The Kings that entered would either come out half-deified or
half-dead. It was very dangerous, and none had ever been known to
go there without first being King class.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane thought and said, “We don’t have to worry
too much, though. Our leader won’t want to hurt Han Sen. He
obviously has his reasons for bringing Han Sen to such a
place.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this, too. If the Sky Palace leader wanted to
bring him harm, he wouldn’t have to go to this much trouble.</p>
<p>The next morning, Han Sen took Bao’er with him to Hidden Path
Island. Outside the island, he found the Sky Palace leader standing
atop a mountain peak. He smiled and waved, as if he was some sort
of angel.</p>
<p>“Greetings.” Han Sen set the legless crane down on the mountain.
Then, he bowed to the leader.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader waved his hand. “These are the stairs that
lead to Hidden Path Cave. Walk these stairs and see how much you
can learn from them.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He hesitated, blinking down at the stairs.
“Leader, are you not going to teach me?”</p>
<p>“Suppress Evil is an unusual art. Even if you were to listen to
me lecture you, you wouldn’t learn very much. This place is
different, however, and you will understand that when you walk
these stairs. If you are talented enough, you can level up Suppress
Evil quickly. It won’t be too difficult to knock down a few tiers
this way.” The Sky Palace leader smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that this is a place where Kings come to level up. I
am merely an Earl, so I don’t think I have what it takes.” Han Sen
didn’t really want to go into that cave.</p>
<p>“You can back out now, if you wish.” Sky Palace leader bared his
teeth in a grin.</p>
<p>Han Sen clenched his jaw and started to descend the steps. The
steps were circular, and when he looked down, he could not see the
bottom. It was like a spiral that continued down forever into some
abyss.</p>
<p>The endless spiral staircase was dizzying.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked back up and saw the Sky Palace leader smiling at
the exit. Han Sen couldn’t go back now, though. He lowered his head
and kept going. Bao’er sat on his shoulders, curiously looking
around.</p>
<p>There was nothing except for stairs. Han Sen followed the steps
that led down into a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>He did not know how many stairs he had descended when he came to
a stone door. On its frame were a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p>“00001… What does that mean? Are there ten thousand doors up
ahead? What might be beyond those doors?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>As Han Sen wondered this to himself, the stone door opened by
itself.</p>
<p>At the entrance of Hidden Path Cave, there was a woman wearing a
black mask. She appeared next to the leader. The leader looked
inside the cave and spoke to the black-masked woman. This is your
territory. Watch him, and do not allow him to die.”</p>
<p>You brought him here. This is your responsibility. I do not care
about what happens.” The black-masked woman said, then entered
Hidden Path Cave.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader smiled when she turned. He stepped onto a
cloud and left the island to return to the Sky Palace Garden.</p>
