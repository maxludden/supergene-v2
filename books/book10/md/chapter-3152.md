“I am willing to.” Du Ru Lan kowtowed.

“If you are willing to, Decapitation Queen, you should take him to the side hall and test his Blood-Pulse.” Han Sen did not plan on giving Burning Lamp God of Wealth’s blood. He wanted it to be given by Decapitation Queen.

As to what Blood-Pulse he would give to Burning Lamp, that purely depended on his talent. He was willing to take care of him, but he would not force Decapitation Queen to give him a lifetime of Blood-Pulses for him.

When Du Ru Lan heard the God of Wealth statue speak, she was shocked. She watched Decapitation Queen walk to the side hall. After she thanked him, she followed Decapitation Queen.

Du Ru Lan was from a good family. She saw the side hall’s Decapitation Queen statue and knew Decapitation Queen was God of Wealth Temple’s sub-god. She felt disappointed.

The main god of the temple was the strongest. No matter how good the Blood-Pulse was, obeying the sub-god was as good as the main one.

Considering everything that had happened, Du Ru Lan could not really voice a complaint. It was miraculous enough that she was still drawing breath. Beggars could not be choosers.

Decapitation Queen took the little boy to the altar. She placed the boy on it and told him, “If you are willing to obey me, pick up the knife and cut one of your fingers. Place your blood on the god stove.”

“Mister, he is still so young. Let me help him.” Du Ru Lan stood up, ready to help him. Suddenly, she was unable to move. She was kept in place by some scary power. “This is his choice,” Decapitation Queen coldly said.

Du Ru Lan could neither speak nor move. She was looking at her son with a heart that raged like a fire.

The little boy was special. After all that had happened, he had not cried and or shouted. He listened to Decapitation Queen and stood up. He picked up the sacrificial knife from the altar and cut his finger. He let the blood drop onto the god stove.

*Boom!*

A purple and black fire was on the god stove. It turned into demon fire that shocked the sky. The whole side hall was full of a murderous air. Some of the air rushed out into the sky from the guillotine.

Han Sen was in the main hall laughing. “Burning Lamp really is Burning Lamp. Although he has been reborn, he is still very special.”

Thinking of Burning Lamp being able to raise the Buddha from being a no-name race to a race that was full of elites and had almost become a high race, it proved his power was very strong “Mister, Decapitation Queen wants to make a God Spirit deal with him,” Decapitation Queen said while kneeling before the God of Wealth statue. “I want to make him an inheritable Blood-Pulse.”

“Sure.” Han Sen only said that one word.

Decapitation Queen did not hesitate. A purple and black flame arouse on the guillotine and doll. They turned into a scary fire that headed for the little boy.

The little boy’s body was wrapped up by a purple and black flame. His forehead possessed a strange marking that resembled a guillotine. Within that mark, there was another mark that referenced it to be an Annihilation God Spirit.

“Decapitation Queen is an Annihilation God Spirit?” Du Ru Lan was as much shocked as she was happy. She could not believe what she was seeing

A god temple’s sub-god was an Annihilation God Spirit. The main god must have been a supreme existence. She could not imagine how scary it had to be.

“The gods pity us. My child finally has hope.” Du Ru Lan was so happy that she cried.

Han Sen saw the little boy compose a deal with Decapitation Queen. He was now an inheritor of Decapitation Queen’s Blood-Pulse. Han Sen’s face looked weird as he started to think about some strange scenes.

He thought about the little boy growing up to be very kind, just like Burning Lamp Alpha, but his hands would be holding a guillotine, killing countless droves of people. Han Sen thought it would be extremely weird.

In the Feng family’s castle’s little garden, Qin Bai and Bao’er were sitting next to each other while playing chess. “Bao’er, do you know how to play checkers?” Qin Bai cockily asked. “I can teach you how to play it.”

Bao’er looked at him with disdain. She lifted her lips and said, “You learned checkers from my father.”

“Oh, I forgot that,” Qin Bai said with a laugh. “You are Han Sen’s daughter, so how could you not know checkers? That is good. How about we play 300 rounds? I won’t let you win once.”

“You need to keep your promise,” Bao’er said with a smile. “You have to play 300 rounds.” “Of course, you can go first.” Qin Bai sounded very confident.

He loved playing checkers. If he did not need to practice with his sword, he would not mind playing a few rounds.

Bao’er accepted the challenge. She picked up her chess piece and made the first move.

After doing that, Bai Qin thought it was not normal. It felt as if there was a sword air that shocked the sky coming at him. It gave him the feeling that the sky could break.

Qin Bai wanted to scream, but he noticed he was unable to move. He watched the sword air that shocked the sky go into his brain. He peed himself.

Of course, that was not a real sword air. It was just Bao’er’s Heart Sword Path. That sword skill was Six Path King’s sword skill. Han Sen had learned it as well. He had not mastered it, but he used it now and again. Bao’er had learned it from him too.

Now, Bao’er used the Heart Sword skill to simulate the Wavy Sword Skill’s sword mind. She used it to attack Qin Bai’s will to feel the sword skill’s sword mind.

Learning was very hard, especially for people who did not want to learn. It made it much harder.

There was one condition in which people could learn fast and never forget. There was a saying if one failed once, one would learn from the mistakes to get better. It meant the more disadvantages one had, the more one would remember. It did not make a person smarter.

The more it hurt, the easier it was to recall the mistake. Bao’er used that method. She wanted the crown prince to remember the Wavy Sword Mind.

Qin Bai’s tragic life had now begun. He noticed he could no longer scream or move. His body was uncontrollably playing a chess game with Bao’er.

Whenever Bao’er made a move, it would become a scary Wavy Sword Mind attacking him. Even though he knew the sword mind would not kill him, it still made Qin Bai experience a lot of pain.

The sword mind’s pressure was something extremely difficult for most people to endure. The pain from the Heart Sword was not just pain in the body. Qin Bai had to get attacked by that scary sword skill again and again. Every time it happened, it made Qin Bai feel as if he was dying. He felt absolutely awful.

Furthermore, the guards had no idea what was going on. They thought Qin Bai was peacefully playing chess with Bao’er. No one knew Qin Bai was suffering pain that was too unbearable for most humans to endure.

Teacher Jia Yi Zhen was in a good mood. Crown Prince Qin Bai was scared of her. No matter how naughty he was, he always listened to her. He always did her homework seriously.

This time, Qin Bai had not practiced the sword skills. He had left the palace to go and play. Jia Yi Zhen was very worried about the future of the Qin Kingdom.
