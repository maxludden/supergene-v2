  Yan Bei Fei gripped the handle of the knife as his entire body summoned a strange and mysterious aura. His body did not move, but it looked like it was emitting some light. It was like time was coldly fading.

Han Sen was still casually standing where he was. It did not look like he was going to fight. Instead, he just watched Yan Bei Fei with interest.

Ever since he had come to this world, humans mainly used power from the outside. It was rare to witness an elite use their own powers.

Alongside the likes of Jian Bu Gu, Yan Bei Fei had to be a rare elite. He had practiced a knife mind, which was what Han Sen was best at.

Han Sen was interested to see what level Yan Bei Fei’s knife skills were.

Han Sen looked at Yan Bei Fei and thought, “Using gene race powers to practice a knife mind is such a complicated game. This is interesting,” Upon seeing Han Sen not bother to make a move, Yan Bei Fei shouted, “Fight!”

“I will fight when I need to,” Han Sen coldly replied.

After Han Sen said that, the nobles and teenagers from the Yan Kingdom watching Yan Bei Fei were all riled up and angered. They thought Han Sen was very ignorant. Yan Bei Fei had the title of Flying Yan Swordsman. Aside from his knife’s name, Flying Yan, it primarily described how fast he struck. When he thrust the knife out of the scabbard, it always determined the end of someone’s life.

Han Sen wanted Yan Bei Fei to strike first. From what they could tell, he looked like a simpleton with a death wish.

“What a crazy and ignorant man,” a nobleman from the Yan Kingdom said. “He wants Mister Yan to strike first. This man will be slashed, and he will not continue living.”

“How dare he play cocky before Flying Yan Swordsman,” the princes of the Yan Kingdom angrily said. “He must have a death wish.”

Yan Bei Fei was not thinking of things the same way as the nobles of the Yan Kingdom. Although Han Sen was just casually standing where he was, he felt as if he was facing off with a mountain.

Yan Bei Fei knew he had encountered an elite. He had never heard of Dollar before, but he knew he was very strong.

Yan Bei Fei realized that, but he did not fall back. His will for fighting grew stronger. He steeled his will to not feel any fear. It did not matter who his opponent was. He was confident that he would emerge victoriously. If he didn’t, he would lose before things truly got going

The aura around Yan Bei Fei’s body was stronger. When it reached the top, it suddenly disappeared. His presence looked like it was something that used an endless abyss for a stomping ground and made all others unable to find a bottom. Looking at him made one feel as if one had fallen into the abyss.

Yan Bei Fei suddenly moved. The Flying Yan knife rushed out of its scabbard. The knife had no shadow. It was like it vanished in the air.

Zhuo Dong Lai was watching. When he saw Yan Bei Fei’s knife, he complimented him. “Flying Yan moves, and all becomes silent. Heads roll across the floor without knowing what happened. Very good Flying Yan Swordsman. Very good Flying Yan sword skill. The most powerful knife on earth.”

The Yan Kingdom’s nobles complimented him too. They did so despite not knowing what was great about it.

Yan Bei Fei unleashed his strike, but he had been unable to take Han Sen’s head off.

Yan Bei Fei’s knife was very fast. It was so fast that most people could see the knife light. Han Sen saw it, but he did not just watch it. He fell back a little and dodged the Flying Yan knife. “Yan return!” Yan Bei Fei did not feel bad about his knife missing. His knife mind did not relent. It accelerated. At the same time, the Flying Yan knife returned to its scabbard.

His movement created an overbearing, ultimate knife power that came out of Han Sen’s back. It was faster and crueler. It was even more brutal than Yan Bei Fei’s slash. Yan Bei Fei poured his Blood-Pulse, gene race, power, and talent into that knife skill. He planned on using Yan Return for Zhuo Dong Lai, but he felt threatened by Han Sen. He could not help but use the secret skill Yan Return. He wanted to kill his opponent and strike down Han Sen, who was extremely strong.

“Very good Yan Return,” Zhuo Dong Lai said in shock. “It is incredible. If that was me down there, and I did not know this, I would have been hurt.”

Yan Dan had already finished dealing with his opponent. He came back and saw Yan Bei Fei using Yan Return. He frowned.

He remembered Yan Bei Fei’s first opponent was a nameless person. How was he able to push Yan Bei Fei into using Yan Return? He remembered that Yan Bei Fei had only learned that secret murderous skill in the past two years. He never used it on a whim. Only Yan Dan knew that Yan Bei Fei had Yan Return.

Yan Dan thought he would see it when Yan Bei Fei fought Zhuo Dong Lai, but he was seeing it now. It was clear how scared he was.

In the next second, Yan Dan’s shock became something unbelievable. Yan Bei Fei’s opponent made a single dodge to evade Yan Return’s knife air. It seemed to be a very light move. It was as if it was done casually.

Even Zhuo Dong Lai’s face changed. He looked at Han Sen with a strange expression.

Yan Bei Fei shouted. His body was like a mountain, and his knife was like a Flying Yan. Knife air shook the sky and slashed toward Han Sen. Yan Bei Fei kept slashing until the sky and the ground changed color, and the suns and the moons stopped glowing.

Han Sen behaved as if it was nothing special. He moved his feet and traveled through all the knife air that shocked the sky. From top to bottom, he had not used his skills. Yet, Yan Bei Fei’s knife skills had not come close enough to ruffle his sleeves.

“Since when did such a powerful elite enter this universe?” Zhuo Dong Lai was shocked. He looked at Han Sen with eyes that were on fire. Han Sen’s body looked like it was on fire Zhuo Dong Lai wanted to see who this person was.

Yan Dan’s face looked dim. He understood Yan Bei Fei. Yan Bei Fei’s knife was too heavy. Yan Return was his absolute best skill. If those two skills were unable to harm his opponent, he knew who was going to lose.

The people of the Yan Kingdom were shouting. For a nameless, small character to compete against Yan Bei Fei in such a way was too shocking. They could not believe it.

At this time, everyone looked at Yan Bei Fei’s opponent. They did not know who he was. Before this, no one cared who Yan Bei Fei’s opponent was or which God Spirit he belonged to.

Aside from his opponent being some kind of famous elite, they did not think Yan Bei Fei could ever lose. They had only glanced at the roster and seen it was some unknown person. They did not even remember the name of the opponent and God Spirit. After checking it again, they were confused.

“Dollar? God of Wealth? Can someone tell me who this is?”

Even people like Yan Dan and Zhuo Dong Lai were just as confused as everyone else. A competitor could have a random name, and many people used fake names, but the name of a God Spirit could not be faked. They had never heard of this God of Wealth. They also did not know what level they were.

“Does anyone here know which God Spirit God of Wealth is?” Yan Dan looked at his teammates, but they all looked confused too.

“Dollar? God of Wealth? Interesting.” Zhuo Dong Lai looked at Han Sen with great interest.
