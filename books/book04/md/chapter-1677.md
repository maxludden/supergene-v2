Ancient Devil was sitting in lotus position. One hand was pushing against the God’s Door, while the other pushed back at Han Sen’s hand.

“I already have one foot inside the God’s Door. It does not matter how strong you are, you are still an ant compared to the likes of me.” Ancient Devil spoke to Han Sen gently, as if he had already achieved godhood.

But Han Sen didn’t respond, and he just continued adding pressure against Ancient Devil’s hand.

Pang!

A mist of blood clouded the entire area, as Ancient Devil’s arm was suddenly blown into a gory mess. It became dust in the sky, turning into nothing.

Ancient Devil’s face changed. He had gathered up an endless lifeforce, stolen from dozens of elders. He thought he was invincible and ready to become a god, but then his arm was blown off by the human Han Sen.

The scariest thing was Ancient Devil’s sudden inability to regenerate the arm. He could heal other wounds, but not the severed arm. And that added to his fear.

His abilities of physical recovery were quite strong, and definitely as good as a healer dem卜god But his broken arm r咖 to regrow. Han Sen’s powers had to be something special that Ancient Devil had never before seen.

Han Sen was surprised, by comparison. His Super Spank hadn’t undone Ancient Devil’s entire sequence structure. It only managed to break a part of him.

Han Sen thrust his palm forward again, prompting Ancient Devil to pull back the hand he was using to try to open the door. He had to now use that single hand to fight Han Sen.

The skeleton necklace became a black hole. Ancient Devil now wanted Han Sen’s power before he ascended. He wanted Han Sen to become a part of him.

But that, as it turned out, was not a good idea. Han Sen palmed the black hole instead, as Super Spank broke a sequence structure.

Ancient Devil heard a boom, and one of the skulls on the necklace broke and turned to dust. Ancient Devil’s face darkened. He had one hundred and eight skulls. Each one was difficult to refine. Each skull counted for one emperor, too.

When one hundred and eight skulls were strung together, their power increased exponentially. Ancient Devil’s power was something that ought to have been impossible in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

Ancient Devil could not believe his skull orb had been broken. How did that happen?

Han Sen did not give him time to think, though. Instead, he just repeatedly pounded and palmed the black hole. There were many explosions detonating, like a string of atom bombs dropped on it One by one, the sequence structures of the skulls were destroyed.

Ancient Devil trembled. He ignored Han Sen now. He wanted to get through the God’s Door, so he pummeled the stone gate. He wanted to open the door before the black hole disappeared.

The spirits and creatures below were still writhing, and not even the elders would be able to hold on much longer. Their very bodies were decomposing. Lots of demonic auras and wisps came to Ancient Devil, giving him power and providing extra strength.

The God’s Door was rattling. It seemed as if it would be broken by his fist at any moment.

“Almost! Almost there! Almost there!” Ancient Devil looked crazed, with his one arm bashing against the door.

The door rumbled and shook, but he had not managed to open it yet

Gu Qingcheng and the others all watched the spectacle in shock. Their eyes almost popped out of their sockets. If the gate was opened, Han Sen would be sucked inside.

With Ancient Devil’s current situation, it’d only take a few more punches to open the gate completely.

Han Sen had broken around thirty skull orbs. And reaching this figure, he noticed the power of the black hole beginning to wane. Still, it’d be a while before it was totally broken. And it was too late to stop Ancient Devil from opening the door.

“Han Sen, come back! It is too late!” Gu Qingcheng shouted.

Han Sen ignored her calls. He used his palm to break the sequence structure of another two skulls.

There had been one hundred and eight skulls earlier, so breaking just a few was useless.

Pang! Pang!

Ancient Devil threw another two punches, shaking the stone door even more. It looked like it would not be able to withstand Ancient Devil’s powerful strikes much longer.

Ancient Devil squinted his eyes and looked back at Han Sen, whose fist was in front of his body. Then suddenly, the demonic aura exploded. The dying elites were decomposing at an even faster rate, accelerating their wispy travel to Ancient Devil’s fists.

There were more and more demonic wisps coming to his fist, so much so that it almost couldn’t handle the sheer volume of strength. Even the people of Shadow Shelter were shocked by what they saw.

“This is my God’s Door! You will die entering it. If you don’t want to live, then come with me! Witness my ascendance as a god!” After Ancient Devil said that, he threw his most frightening punch yet.

“You are too naive,” Han Sen said quietly. He held a closed Bulwark Umbrella and ventured near the black hole.

Bulwark Umbrella brushed through the sequence structure of the skulls. They broke like spider webs, as seventy of them were reduced to dust.

Han Sen brushed away all the orbs and gathered power into his right fist. The power of Super Spank was now directly before Ancient Devil. He was waiting for the moment when Ancient Devil struck, so he could get him at his most vulnerable.

Ancient Devil’s face went pale, but he had no options at this point. He was now smack-dab in the process of becoming a god. He couldn’t run at a time like this.

He had thrown his fist back at God’s Door one last time, but it was too late to pull it back now. Even if he could, after he saw Han Sen break the skulls, he didn’t think he could block Han Sen’s fist, anyway.

Ancient Devil was so strong, and he still felt hopeless. He couldn’t run.

Han Sen watched Ancient Devil as he was punching.

“Winning!” Gu Qingcheng saw Ancient Devil unable to do anything, and it brought her sheer delight.

But suddenly, a white shadow appeared. The White Donkey had brought with him an invincible power. It came before Ancient Devil and blocked Han Sen’s fist.

The White Donkey brayed at Han Sen with a weird smile, and the sequence structure of its body broke and turned the creature into dust.

Han Sen’s face changed. When he was blocked by the White Donkey in that crucial moment, Ancient Devil’s fist reached God’s Door. There was a big boom and the stone gate shook.

“Don’t open! Don’t open the door!” Gu Qingcheng and the others screamed, watching the door and yelling.

Pang!

The stone door broke and swung open, as the godlight poured out like the illumination of stars. It wrapped up Han Sen and Ancient Devil, pulling them both inside.
