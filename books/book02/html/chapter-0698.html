    <p>
      Fortunately, the ant king was not particularly fast when compared to other
      super creatures. If the ant king had a speed akin to the raven Han Sen
      once encountered, he feared the little angel would have been unable to
      defeat it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched for a while and when the chance arose, the trumpeting of
      elephants fueled a power inside his body. The power surged into the
      Flaming Rex Spike, which swung down onto the ant king.
    </p>

    <p>
      The devil ant king knew Han Sen was attacking, but it was unable to dodge.
      It was not because it was not fast enough, it was because it was
      recovering from blocking another attack that was delivered by the little
      angel. During its recovery, it didn&#8217;t have the energy to deflect Han
      Sen&#8217;s hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s power was far inferior to the devil ant king&#8217;s.
      Normally, he wouldn&#8217;t dare something like this, but he excelled in
      the realm of tactics; deduction and prediction, particularly. He had
      foreseen how the ant king would react, so he committed to this deadly
      strike the exact moment he knew the ant king would not be able to dodge,
      block, or even retaliate.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The Flaming Rex Spike brutally struck the ant king&#8217;s waist. Han Sen
      thought this must have been its weak point.
    </p>

    <p>
      But all that sounded from the strike was the call of beaten metal, and
      that was exactly what it felt like when he hit the ant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Flaming Rex Spike left his hand and spun through the air about ten
      meters away. It hit the cliffside. With such force, Han Sen&#8217;s hands
      were left numb and his arms almost felt as if they were going to break.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the hit was delivered, though, the ant king squealed in agony. There
      was only a shallow indent made in its shell, despite the pain it seemed to
      feel. But Han Sen knew he&#8217;d have to crack the shell somehow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel, however, used this opportunity to make a move of her
      own. She used her greatsword, battering the point Han Sen had dented. On
      the fourth slash, the shell crack a few inches, enough to expose the
      ant&#8217;s white flesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ant king panicked and quickly returned to the tunnel it had emerged
      from, suffering brutally. Han Sen was very weak right now, though. He felt
      as if he could barely stand, let alone chase after it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he unlocked his gene lock with the Dongxuan Sutra and re-simulated
      the bone elephant&#8217;s energy, the Elephant-Rex Strike had become even
      more powerful than it was before. If it hadn&#8217;t been boosted to the
      level it was currently at, he would have been unable to deal the damage he
      did to the ant.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the more powerful the attack was, the more energy it cost. After all,
      his fitness was limited and he couldn&#8217;t dream of being like the bone
      elephant itself, repeatedly unleashing such foul, wretched amounts of
      power on a whim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen estimated he had reached a fitness level of about two hundred by
      now, but the energy costs of that skill were still too draining.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under Han Sen&#8217;s command, the little angel chased the ant king down
      into the pit it had come from. But he also ordered her to return if the
      ant king still proved to be too formidable. He didn&#8217;t want her
      taking any unnecessary risks, and he wanted her to prioritize her own
      safety above all else.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ant king had only been dealt a small amount of damage, and it still
      contained most of its power. It was still stronger than the little angel,
      without question. This was the great boon of being an ant. Few could fight
      one, even if they were on par with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel was not a pet that was based on strength. It was not
      unusual for her to be weaker than the ant, and since she was down in its
      lair, she&#8217;d be at a disadvantage without being outside. In the tiny
      cave she chased it down, she would have limited room to dodge. If it came
      down to a fight of strength versus strength, odds were far in favor of the
      ant winning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel was a balanced pet. Although she had no special elements,
      her strength, speed, vitality, and attack were all above average.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plus, she had the ability to fly. She was a pet that covered almost
      everything. Although she wasn&#8217;t too special, she had no weakness,
      either.
    </p>

    <p>
      A super creature like that was the scariest for a human. With every
      ability being able to crush a human, humans would not have a chance of
      fighting back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned Princess Yin and Princess Yang. He brought them out so
      they could collect the devil ants' corpses, while he dragged his own tired
      body down after the ant king.
    </p>

    <p>
      He still did not feel safe, and he worried that the little angel would
      fight the ant king until she died. It did not matter if she could kill the
      ant king or not; her loss would a grievous one for him. Han Sen
      couldn&#8217;t fathom losing her.
    </p>

    <p>
      He descended a long way into the mountain from the tunnel&#8217;s
      entrance. By the time he got where he needed to be, he had descended four
      hundred meters. From that point, the tunnel widened up into a giant
      cavern. It seemed like a nexus or hub of some sort, for there were many
      other tunnels and passages leading off from this central cavern. As for
      the little angel, she was inside hovering about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the ant king was wounded, it was still incredibly powerful. It
      guarded the cavern well, in battle with the little angel, and there was no
      sign of it losing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, while he was down there, was busy inspecting this cavern he had
      discovered, deep beneath the earth. With great observation, he surmised
      that the entirety of the mountain above had been hollowed out by the ants.
      It was like a massive subterranean kingdom for the ants.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what Han Sen did not understand was that, inside this ant nest, aside
      from this king and the twenty sacred-blood ants he had laid waste to
      earlier, there weren&#8217;t any other ants.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was strange. For a nest this big, there should have been many more
      ants in there. The fact that there was only one ant king was strange, as
      well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did that pangolin eat all the other ants?&#8221; Han Sen suddenly
      recalled the sight of that pangolin, which escaped the pursuit of the
      sacred-blood ants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the reason why the devil ants had chased it with as much fervor as
      they did, was because it had killed the rest of the kingdom&#8217;s ants.
      If this was true, that suggested it was really powerful. It might have
      been a super creature, even.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen wasn&#8217;t too sure of that. Other people could not sense
      it, but after learning the first tier of the Dongxuan Sutra, he was extra
      sensitive to the life forces of creatures he came across.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pangolin&#8217;s life force was a little bit stronger than a
      sacred-blood creature, but not as strong as a super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel was still battling the ant king, but the ant king had
      retreated into a little cave. Its shell was hard enough as it was, and
      with its power, it made it incredibly hard for the little angel to deal it
      damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now, the wound around its waist had already healed. It looked like
      new, as if it hadn&#8217;t been dealt a single hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This ant king is sick. I&#8217;m not even sure if I&#8217;ll be
      able to kill it.&#8221; Han Sen was getting a little depressed, but just
      as he thought of giving up, something else lurked in the dark. The
      pangolin had returned, and it peeped at the battlers from a tunnel, like a
      little thief.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pangolin watched how the little angel and ant king fought as it
      shimmied along the walls of the cavern. Its scales were colored exactly
      like the rock, in a dark green color. Unless he paid close attention,
      he&#8217;d have had a difficult time spotting it, creeping its way up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quickly, the pangolin entered a cave near the ant king and then drilled
      out another cave beside it. After that, it disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched what it was doing with curiosity, and then decided to
      follow it into the tunnel it had just created.
