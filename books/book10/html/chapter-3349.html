<p>In front of an intelligent elite like Ancient Devil, Han Sen was
not planning to lie, even if he did not know how to lie.</p>
<p>Plus, saying something honest would have made Ancient Devil
suspicious.</p>
<p>If Ancient Devil was there for something, and if Han Sen was
there, Ancient Devil might not believe he was there by accident.
Ancient Devil would definitely be suspicious.</p>
<p>“I am here by accident too.” Ancient Devil looked to be devoid
of emotion when he said that.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not see anything strange in Ancient Devil’s face. He
knew it would be hard to glean any information from him, so he
asked, “Last time, regarding the geno tablet, do you not think you
owe me an explanation?”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil laughed. “What explanation? I did not lie to you
about a single thing. Everything I told you was the absolute truth.
Therefore, what can you possibly expect me to explain to you?”</p>
<p>“It looks like you think you are in Dust Sky. My power is
restricted, so I cannot do anything to you.” Han Sen looked at
Ancient Devil as he spoke.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did not hide anything. He nodded and said, “There
is a way. Dust Sky has restricted my power and Break World rate is
not very high. But in Dust Sky, you cannot beat me easily.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?” Han Sen did not believe Ancient Devil. He looked
at Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil waved his hands. “Do not even think about trying
to fight me. Now, we are all in Dust Sky together. If I am found by
Bury Path God, you and I are both going down. After all, the enemy
of my enemy is a friend. Why should we kill each other?”</p>
<p>“That depends on whether or not you are willing to be my
friend,” Han Sen said. He took a step toward Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>His body was not as powerful as usual, but his will and mind
were still there. With Under the Sky will and his power, every step
he took was like a chess game. It made Ancient Devil feel a lot of
pressure.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil’s face changed. He still understood Han Sen. He
knew if that guy wanted to do something, he would go through the
fire and flames to get it. He would not be tricked by mere language
play. Unless he was able to bring out something solid, he would
probably have to end up fighting Han Sen.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen come before him, Ancient Devil made a very deep
smile and asked, “Do you want to know Bury Path God’s secret? It is
a secret that pertains to Dust Sky as well.”</p>
<p>This was what Han Sen wanted to hear. It made Han Sen stop
breathing and walking.</p>
<p>“Tell me.” Han Sen stood still. He coldly looked at Ancient
Devil. His power had not been reduced. He still looked at Ancient
Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil paused and said, “It is actually like Sky King.
Bury Path God bred the creatures in the 33 skies. When Bury Path
God was born, Sky King was already the first spirit in the 33
skies. He was born in Dust Sky.”</p>
<p>“Keep going.” Han Sen was interested in this. He thought, “Of
course. Ancient Devil did not come here by accident.”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil made it sound nice. He went on to say, “Sky King
is the son of the 33 skies, but he is not the biggest spirit in the
33 skies. The real spirit of the 33 skies is Dust Sky’s Bury Path
God. Of the 33 skies, Dust Sky is very unique.”</p>
<p>“What kind of situation are we talking about here?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“According to Mister Leader’s plan with the 33 skies, Dust Sky
is a grave for the 33 skies,” Ancient Devil said. “It is for
burying the spirits that are unable to be reincarnated.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen asked. “What do you mean by them
not being able to be reincarnated? I thought every spirit could
reincarnate after their death.”</p>
<p>“Yes, according to the theory,” Ancient Devil replied. “Some
spirits are so strong that when their bodies perish, their souls do
not die completely. Struggles will have left their marks on it. If
such a spirit entered the cycle of reincarnation, they would be a
glitch in the rules of the world. For a leader, it does not matter
if it is the geno hall or the God Chaos Party, no one wants that to
happen. So, we need a place to sort out these weird spirits. Ergo,
that’s what we have here. We have Dust Sky.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Han Sen let Ancient Devil keep talking.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil became a bit more serious as he said, “When Mister
Leader built the 33 skies, it led to Dust Sky having a spirit,
which was Bury Path God. He became the vice president of the God
Chaos Party. There was then Sky King, Dragon King, Asura, and
others in the 33 skies.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say a word. More than anything, he looked
annoyed. Ancient Devil had said a lot so far, but he hadn’t
actually gotten to the main point.</p>
<p>When Ancient Devil saw Han Sen’s face, he looked uncaring. He
went on to say, “If I have guessed things correctly when the
universe rebooted, Mister Leader buried himself here.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying the body of God Chaos Party’s true leader is
buried in this place?” Han Sen was shocked. He could not find the
gall to believe Ancient Devil’s bold claim.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil nodded. “That is merely what I have guessed. I
haven’t thought of it for long, but Bury Path God became the leader
of Dust Sky. I do not want him to find me. So, I am searching
quietly.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t tell me you have no solid leads.” After making the
effort to get there, Han Sen did not believe Ancient Devil would go
home with nothing.</p>
<p>“Well, funnily enough, I do have some leads. There is a place
not too far from here that looks like the area I am looking for,
but I have been unable to confirm anything just yet.” Ancient Devil
spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Is the place around here?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>If the leader of the God Chaos Party was there, that would be
the real treasure. No one knew what the old leader might have been
carrying.</p>
<p>“On that planet, but I do not know where,” Ancient Devil
said.</p>
<p>“How do you know it is on that planet?” Han Sen looked at
Ancient Devil with a look of zero trust.</p>
<p>“When Bury Path God became the leader, he always occupied that
place,” Ancient Devil seriously said. “From what I was able to
observe, this planet is nothing special.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what he meant. That planet was very normal,
yet Bury Path God always went there. That had to prove there was
something not entirely normal about the place.</p>
<p>“If you are interested, we can co-operate and find the old
leader’s corpse,” Ancient Devil said. “Otherwise, you and I might
be here for a very long time waiting for Bury Path God to return
from the geno tablet. If that happens, we will only end up dead
anyway.”</p>
<p>“Fine. I will work with you again.” Han Sen nodded. On the
inside, he thought, “If this place is the resting place of the God
Chaos Party’s old leader, that means big sky demon might be around.
She seems to know more than Ancient Devil. Perhaps he can contact
her.”</p>
