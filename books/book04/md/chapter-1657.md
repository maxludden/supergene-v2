Surrounding Han Sen never worked. With his Dongxuan movement, he could easily escape any possible entrapment. And in this way, he slipped away and proceeded onwards into Sunset Valley.

Many super elites were going after him, but two of the elders just laughed coldly at Han Sen. They didn’t chase him, and instead, they went after Death Goddess.

Death Goddess’ armor was broken. Her arrows might have been indestructible, but her body wasn’t. She looked to be in terrible condition.

“Has he breached Sunset Valley?” Illusion Elder asked the two elders who were coming toward him.

“He has,” one elder answered.

Illusion Elder smiled grimly. “Good, this is the perfect setup for Death Goddess. Using it on him will work just as well.”

“I will kill Death Goddess and Skysword today. I will shock the entire Fourth God’s Sanctuary,” one elder happily proclaimed.

The three elders invited there by Illusion Elder were all from smaller groups. They were weaker than Illusion Elder, and they were excited to kill someone that strong. The really important elders, like Dark Spirit, were not as easy to invite along.

“Ignore that thought. Let’s just focus on actually killing Death Goddess first.” Illusion Elder rallied the other three elders to attack Death Goddess.

Han Sen was on his way into Sunset Valley. Little Star carried Bao’er and Little Silver through the canyon walls, following after their master. They were deep into the mountains soon enough, and eventually, the elites could not keep track of them.

Due to the numbers that Death Goddess was killing, the super elites kept on coming out of Sunset Valley. Han Sen looked at Ancient Sky Mirror and saw a super creature come out of it.

Han Sen had killed the creature once before, but there it was, coming out of that mirror. Han Sen now knew for certain that the mirror could revive the dead.

But Han Sen had no idea how such a thing would work.

Han Sen also knew that Death Goddess was doing poorly. She wasn’t related to him, but he’d still prefer it if she didn’t die. He moved his Split-Blade in a strike at the mirror.

Han Sen’s slash was obscenely powerful. It was something no creature in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary would underestimate. Split-Blade could tear through the fabric of space, and even break geno cores.

The unleashed swordlight hit the mirror and spread out across it Unfortunately, it brought no harm to the mirror. This gave Han Sen quite the shock.

Han Sen kept on slashing, and as he did, he noticed something rather weird.

Ancient Sky Mirror was a mirror. When Han Sen hit it, it would reflect the image of Han Sen hitting it. The swordlight would connect inside the mirror and outside the mirror.

The strange thing was that the swordlight inside the mirror wasn’t merely a visual reflection. Two powers met inside the mirror and extinguished themselves. And that meant the power Han Sen unleashed would deal no actual damage to the mirror he sought to destroy.

Han Sen changed tactics and attacked the mirror directly with Split-Blade.

Swordlights could be a reflection, but the world inside the mirror was not real. Now that the blade was hitting the mirror, Han Sen thought he could damage it.

But when he struck it, his face changed. His Split-Blade and the mirror Split-Blade reached toward each other. When they struck each other, Han Sen was sent staggering back.

The strike hadn’t hit the mirror; it hit the Split-Blade inside the mirror, and the Split-Blade that came against him possessed the same power he himself had unleashed. The mirror was undamaged, and Han Sen was sent reeling backward.

Han Sen frowned; this was far too weird. No power could deal any damage to the mirror. It didn’t seem likely that he could damage it. Han Sen used a few different elements to attack, but the results were the same. No matter what power he used, it was reflected.

“It’s no wonder the elders didn’t follow me. They knew I’d be unable to break the mirror,” Han Sen thought to himself.

“If I can’t break the mirror, there is only one thing left for me to do.” Han Sen looked murderous. He summoned his God geno core and Overbearing Shield. He brought out the Bloodlust Ant King Glyph and transformed into Fallen Slaughter. Then Han Sen used all that power to hit the monsters trying to come out of the mirror.

There was a loud noise, and a monster that was bigger than two elephants broke under the attack. It bled profusely as it got crushed.

Han Sen looked cold, but Split-Blade did not stop there. He used it against the lance of an incoming spirit and cut through his entire body.

Blood was everywhere, with screaming, too.

All the creatures and spirits that were trying to come through the mirror were now getting stuck inside it. Han Sen killed them, and they respawned.

And those creatures and spirits just kept on respawning, without any of them being able to kill Han Sen before fully exiting the mirror. More and more beings were becoming trapped in the mirror now.

Fewer and fewer enemies attacked Death Goddess, freeing her up. When she killed two of the elders, they respawned at the mirror and ended up trapped. They were unable to rejoin the fray.

Now that they were trapped by Han Sen, they couldn’t leave.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go in tandem with his blade and shield. He trapped two elders and all the other beings in the valley.

Illusion Elder noticed that no one was returning to the fight, and he was confused about what was happening. At that moment, he was killed by Death Goddess. He realized as he died that Han Sen must have blocked the mirror.

The idea of one person holding off a hundred elites was stunning.

“It is no wonder he made it out of Outer Sky Shelter. He is so powerful, not even elders are as good as him.” Illusion Elder and the other elders were all in shock.

They wanted to leave, but they became more and more hopeless. The mirror was too crowded, and there was nothing they could do to fight Han Sen. They kept on getting killed by him.
