	<p>No one would answer Han Sen&#8217;s question. All the people went back into the jungle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Miss, what is this about?&#8221; Han Sen caught up with the woman he saw first and asked.</p>

	<p>The woman said indifferently, &#8220;Now you&#8217;re here, it is like you are sentenced to life. You now have a
		lot of time to discover what this is about.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She soon came back to the jungle like everyone else.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could guess that they probably suffered a ship wreck and ended up here. However, he still wanted to
		figure out where he was. After all, they must have taken a ship here and should have an idea about the location
		of the island and how far it was to the nearest shelter.</p>

	<p>Han Sen quickly followed those people, who did not intend to chase him away either. Very soon, Han Sen followed
		them through the forest and arrived at a cave.</p>

	<p>Inside the cave there were many supplies produced in the Alliance. It was a large cave with bonfire inside, so
		it&#8217;s almost felt like camping.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could tell that these people had been living here for a long time. They were more than a dozen people of
		the same age.</p>

	<p>From Han Sen&#8217;s perspective, these people were about the same age as Qin Xuan. But Qin Xuan only stayed in
		First God&#8217;s Sanctuary for a long time because she wanted to max out her sacred geno points. These people
		obviously did not have the same intention.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Newbie, if you want to stay here, you must obey our rules and do your job. Otherwise we do not have extra
		food to waste on you,&#8221; said a serious guy to Han Sen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There are plenty of creatures in the ocean and on the island, so I think I will be able to feed
		myself,&#8221; Han Sen smiled and said.</p>

	<p>The group watched Han Sen with contempt, as if they had heard something funny. No one spoke though. It was as if
		they didn&#8217;t even deign to mock him.</p>

	<p>The guy&#8217;s continued, &#8220;We are all unfortunate people. Here is a reminder: the Windend Island is full
		of danger. Do not wander around, otherwise you might lose your life.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What kind of danger?&#8221; asked Han Sen in surprise.</p>

	<p>The guy did not speak but a skinny guy next to him cut in, &#8220;There are sacred-blood creatures on the Windend
		Island. Are you able to kill those?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sacred-blood creatures? I did kill a few.&#8221; Han Sen laughed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Boy, you should know who you were bragging to before you brag. Do you know who we are?&#8221; said the
		skinny guy with his lips curled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I would be more than happy to know.&#8221; Han Sen was curious about these people.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have you heard about the special squad?&#8221; asked the skinny guy complacently.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are members of the special squad?&#8221; Han Sen regarded the group in surprise.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not expect to meet people from the same organization on a desolate island.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Since you have heard about the special squad, you must be a well-informed person yourself. You should know
		what we do. And since even we could hardly survive the place, do you know what you should do in the
		future?&#8221; Said the skinny guy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Such a coincidence. I am also in the special squad. I wonder which shelter are you in charge of?&#8221;
		asked Han Sen with a smile.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What? You&#8217;re also a member of the special squad?&#8221; The skinny guy looked to Han Sen in
		surprise.</p>

	<p>Other people were also shocked and seemed to doubt what Han Sen had said. Han Sen did seem quite young. He would
		be 18 years old at most.</p>

	<p>Although the members of the special squad in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary were young, due to the high criteria for
		the members, those who could join were generally over 20, who would have a better geno point count and richer
		experience in God&#8217;s Sanctuary.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My name is Han Sen, head of Steel Armor Special Squad.&#8221; Han Sen told them his identity, which was no
		secret, so there was no point to hide it from them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you kidding me? At your age, you would be lucky to become a member. Head my ass!&#8221; The skinny guy
		smirked and did not believe Han Sen would be the head. He then pointed to the guy who spoke first and told Han
		Sen, &#8220;Boy, see? This is what a head looks like. This is our captain, Fu Shan.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hi, I am Han Sen from Steel Armor Special Squad. Which shelter are you from?&#8221; Han Sen felt lucky to
		meet members from the special squad.</p>

	<p>The skinny guy thought Han Sen was lying and became angry. Before he wanted to say something, Fu Shan stopped
		him.</p>

	<p>Fu Shan looked Han Sen up and down and said, &#8220;As far as I know, the head of Steel Armor Special Squad is
		Qin Xuan, and her deputy is Yang Manli. They&#8217;re both ladies and there is no guy in the leadership. I have
		never heard of the name Han Sen.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You must have been trapped here for more than half a year?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s gaze swept across the
		group.</p>

	<p>&#8220;So what?&#8221; the skinny guy stared at Han Sen and asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No wonder you did not know that Qin Xuan had gone to Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary and I am the new head of
		Steel Armor Special Squad.&#8221; Han Sen smiled and said.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, he did not bring his identity card with him and could not use the Skynet to prove himself either.
	</p>

	<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t just take your word for it. Show us your ID.&#8221; The skinny guy still did not believe
		him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I do not have my ID with me. If you don&#8217;t believe me, I don&#8217;t have a way to persuade
		you.&#8221; Han Sen spread his hands and said, &#8220;There is no point for me to lie to you, so why would I do
		that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The woman whom Han Sen saw first suddenly looked at Han Sen and asked, &#8220;You should know Qin Xuan very well
		then?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Han Sen thought about it and nodded.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then you must know what was behind her left ear?&#8221; The woman asked slowly.</p>

	<p>The whole group was watching Han Sen, awaiting his reply.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If I remember correctly, there is nothing behind Qin Xuan&#8217;s left ear, but a small red birthmark
		behind her right ear,&#8221; said Han Sen casually. He had been in numerous combats with Qin Xuan and knew this
		very well.</p>
