<p>A blonde, purple-eyed woman emerged from beneath the green bushes that cradled the red roses.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t quite look human, and an emerald was embedded in her forehead.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful female spirit.</p>

<p>Her face was stunning to behold. It was cold, but that just amplified her mystique. Regardless of where she was, people would be taken aback by her beauty.</p>

<p>Han Sen was not surprised, but something in particular made him almost leap backwards in shock.</p>

<p>The woman was not wearing any clothes. When she stood up, the fine curve of her booty, and how it led all the way down her long legs, was a sudden, tantalizing sight. It was all on full display.</p>

<p>Han Sen&#8217;s nose was getting hot with a coming nosebleed. Her big breasts and slim waist made her look as if she was straight out of a waifu manga. Humans could not possess such a body shape.</p>

<p>Although the image described might sound ridiculous, she looked natural.</p>

<p>When she emerged from the bushes, she looked cold. And the moment she stepped out, the flowers writhed their way around her to form an armor.</p>

<p>She was like a queen of gardens. She approached the cracks in the earth and removed a rose from her garment of flowers. She snapped the stalk in two and set them alight.</p>

<p>After this, Han Sen realized that it was the stalks of the flowers that were serving as candles.</p>

<p>The stalks caught on fire quickly, and as they burned, a strange fragrance began to emanate. Han Sen thought the bugs would end up returning, but they did not.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought it was odd, and he pondered why the iron bugs did not follow the fragrance as they had previously.</p>

<p>The spirit merely watched the stalk of the flower burn, facing the valley&#8217;s entrance.</p>

<p>Not long after, Han Sen heard a weird noise from someplace else in the valley. Something was flying towards them quickly, and it went for the candle like an arrow.</p>

<p>It was an iron bug. It was a little smaller, but it was darker than the rest. Its shell was black like obsidian.</p>

<p>This bug had grown wings, and it flew extraordinarily fast, completely unlike the others.</p>

<p>This iron bug landed on the stalk and bit into it, with a look of exuberant joy on its face.</p>

<p>The spirit took a step back and merely observed the creature nibbling at the stalk. It didn&#8217;t seem as if she wanted to fight it</p>

<p>&#8220;If the spirit wants to claim that bug, then why doesn&#8217;t she? Is the stalk poisonous, maybe?&#8221; Han Sen thought it queer.</p>

<p>Right then would have been a perfect time to strike, but the spirit withheld any such action. She merely continued to watch the bug merrily munch on its meal.</p>

<p>As Han Sen pondered this, he heard something else come from further down the valley. It was a centipede, one that was entirely red. It ran past the cracks and came for one of the stalks.</p>

<p>The spirit had placed down many stalks prior to this, and thus, there was no conflict. The creatures each had their own.</p>

<p>Not long after, many more bugs arrived. They were of varying shapes and colors; some were black, some were red, and some were green.</p>

<p>The other bugs had come to feed on the stalks, as well. But before long, there were no stalks left, and a fight amongst the bugs started to erupt.</p>

<p>The red centipede was wreathed in flame, and it started to fight a bug with a green shell and eight legs.</p>

<p>The red centipede had the ability to spit fire, but it did not deter the green spider. Without fear, it skittered towards its many-footed foe.</p>

<p>Within seconds, chaos reigned. All the bugs were fighting between each other, none willing to leave the area.</p>

<p>The spirit continued to watch the fight, devoid of all emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are those stalks stimulants?&#8221; Han Sen froze, seeing this. The powers the bugs were unleashing against each other were horrible, something he figured only mutant class monsters could do.</p>

<p>The spirit had played all those mutant class bugs like a fiddle. Han Sen knew he had to treat that spirit with great caution.</p>

<p>The bugs were out of control. Severed limbs and dead bodies lay scattered and strewn across the area, as they attacked each other with wild ferocity.</p>

<p>Watching so many insects die in such a fashion was a terrible sight.</p>

<p>When the battle was over, only the initial iron bug remained alive. A few of its claws had been broken, but that did not prevent it from dining on the leftovers of the battlefield.</p>

<p>As the bug dined on the bodies, its own body began to undergo a change. Its lost limbs recovered.</p>

<p>Colored dots peppered its all-black shell, and it seemed to have even obtained the centipede&#8217;s flame and spider&#8217;s green light.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw the bug claim all those powers for itself and was taken aback.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The iron bug&#8217;s shell cracked, and something seem to emerge from inside its body. Following this, only an empty shell remained.</p>

<p>The newborn iron bug was white. Its body shone like jade. Its eyes were red and its wings were translucent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tchzi Tchzi!&#8221; The newborn iron bug made a couple of sharp noises.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, after all that, the bug evolves?&#8221; The spirit frowned, as she thought to herself. The results were beyond her expectations. The iron bug was the weakest mutant bug, and yet it had somehow survived.</p>

<p>The spirit looked over the iron bug, which now seemed to resemble white jade. Then, she presented a box to the bug, one that had been crafted from vines. A bug emerged from the box.</p>
