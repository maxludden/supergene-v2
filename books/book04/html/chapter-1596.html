    <p>
      Han Sen was horrified. He tried to dodge the attacks from Lin Feng, and at
      the same time, he yelled, “What’s happening, Lin Feng?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew that Lin Feng was controlled, but he didn’t know if only Lin
      Feng’s body was possessed, or if his mind was as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng continued to swing his sword toward Han Sen, and at the same
      time, he said, “My body is under someone else’s control. Go away!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I’ll cut you free.” Han Sen was holding the Bulwark Umbrella in one
      hand and his Taia sword in the other. He struck the bones that were locked
      around Lin Feng.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” Lin Feng suddenly screamed in agony, then he coughed out blood,
      which shocked Han Sen to his very core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was confident about his sword technique; his aim was perfect. Han
      Sen was certain that he slashed the bloody bones, so he couldn’t
      understand why Lin Feng had been injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw that the bloody bones were completely intact, but Lin Feng
      kept coughing up blood. Han Sen realized something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Either flee now or kill me!” Lin Feng told Han Sen through gritted teeth.
      He had realized what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t want to give up like that. He then slashed the bloody bones
      in two different places, but the same thing happened. The bloody bones got
      hit, but Lin Feng was the one who was actually injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bloody bones were transferring all damage done to them straight to Lin
      Feng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t having any sudden inspiration on how to deal with the
      situation. He had to use his Bulwark Umbrella and Taia sword to ward off
      the attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Lin Feng realized that their time was running out, yet Han Sen
      still didn’t have the time to actually fight Lin Feng. Han Sen didn’t know
      much about Lin Feng’s actual fighting power, but he was certainly that Lin
      Feng was incredibly powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Lin Feng was totally under the bloody bones’ control, but he was
      still performing his own blade techniques. Although Lin Feng was only had
      a gemstone geno core, his blade technique shocked Han Sen a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng’s techniques were elegant and mild, but they weren’t visually
      stunning or mysterious. They weren’t like God’s Retribution’s skills,
      which turned complicated into simple, and they weren’t as intricate as Six
      Paths’ abilities. Each of Lin Feng’s moves looked very simple and plain,
      but those simple and ordinary sword techniques seemed powerful, perhaps
      unbreakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng’s sword techniques turned something base and ordinary into
      something rare and ethereal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some flaws in Lin Feng’s techniques, but the pressure exerted
      from those attacks made the wielder feel like they were like an emperor
      that nobody could easily bypass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s blade techniques were also good, but it would be difficult for
      him to win against Lin Feng just using his sword. However, Han Sen’s focus
      wasn’t on swords, so he had many other methods to suppress Lin Feng. When
      it came to strength, Lin Feng was not Han Sen’s match.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Lin Feng had been an enemy, Han Sen would’ve killed him already, but
      Han Sen didn’t want to harm his friend. He was forced to stay on the
      defensive, which put him at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sure that he didn’t injure Lin Feng, Han Sen had to keep stepping
      back, and after several steps, he had drifted back into the storm, so he
      couldn’t see anything around him.
    </p>
    <p>Dang!</p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng, who was controlled by the bloody bones, didn’t seem to be
      affected by the storm at all. Instead, he became even more ferocious, and
      he flitted here and there like a shadow in the storm. He kept showing up
      in the storm and hitting Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen warded off another strike from Lin Feng, yet all of a sudden, a
      sword suddenly appeared in Lin Feng’s left hand. The sword stabbed Han
      Sen’s shoulder, and he started to bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen spun his own sword, but he couldn’t slash the bloody bones. Lin
      Feng disappeared into the storm again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng, who was now dual-wielding swords, got more aggressive. He
      attacked Han Sen again and again from the cover of the storm, but Han Sen
      could only defend instead of attacking. Lin Feng took advantage of every
      opening that Han Sen provided, and Han Sen’s wounds kept piling up and his
      blood kept dripping.
    </p>
    <p>“Kill me,” Lin Feng yelled with a hoarse voice, his eyes red.</p>
    <p>
      However, Han Sen couldn’t attack Lin Feng like that. He warded off the
      attacks from Lin Feng while saying, “I’ll keep thinking. There’s got to be
      something I can do. I won’t let you die like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite saying so, Han Sen couldn’t think of anything. He couldn’t kill
      Lin Feng, but he also couldn’t dodge the attacks in the storm as fast as
      Lin Feng. It seemed that killing Lin Feng would be the only way to
      survive.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen got more injured, and blood covered his entire body.</p>
    <p>
      Blood Bone Demon looked at Lin Feng and Han Sen who were fighting each
      other in the storm. She smiled. “I thought it would take longer to kill
      Han Sen since he didn’t touch the blood bone puppet, but now, it seems
      it’s not necessary anymore. Humans are such bizarre creatures. They’ll
      literally let themselves be killed for the sake of others. Totally
      bizarre, but I like this feeling.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Humans are indeed idiotic creatures, as they usually do things that are
      completely meaningless,” said Qing Ya mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just when Blood Bone Demon tried to say something, Lin Feng lunged forward
      and ran his sword through Han Sen’s heart. Han Sen fell onto the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mr. Qing Ya, it’s done now,” Blood Bone Demon said excitedly to Qing Ya.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You should be more careful. That human being is exceptional,” Qing Ya
      said, looking at Han Sen’s lifeless body on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Please rest assured, Mr. Qing Ya. There won’t be a problem.” Blood Bone
      Demon was very confident. She walked toward Han Sen and Lin Feng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng was standing in the storm. All of a sudden, the storm around them
      disappeared, and then a man and a woman walked toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be exact, there were three of them. That woman had the lower body of a
      centipede, and she was carrying a man that couldn’t move at all. That
      person seemed to have been completely paralyzed. Though he was still
      slightly conscious, he couldn’t even move his lips and eyeballs. It was
      Jing Jiwu.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you?” Lin Feng shouted at Qing Ya as his eyes popped in shock.
      Apparently, he could tell that Qing Ya was the master in this situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood Bone Demon smiled weirdly. Lin Feng couldn’t control himself at all.
      He raised the blade in his hand and stabbed Han Sen, who already seemed
      lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      “See, Mr. Qing Ya, that human is completely dead now,” said Blood Bone
      Demon. And then, she threw the paralyzed Jing Jiwu onto the ground, and
      she stabbed down toward him with claws that looked like bones. “This guy
      is useless now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Blood Bone Demon could stab Jing Jiwu with her claws, the space
      around her was suddenly twisted, and a trace of light flashed, cutting off
      the claws that struck toward Jing Jiwu. As for Jing Jiwu, a hand grabbed
      him and pulled him away from the claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re still alive?” Blood Bone Demon’s eyes popped out, staring at the
      man supporting Jing Jiwu. It was Han Sen, who she had presumed to be dead.
