The blood god dragon’s three gene skills were very good. They were similar to the gold wing peacock king, but the blood god dragon had the blood dragon god-pulse buff. The golden wing peacock king’s combat prowess was far inferior.

Han Sen originally planned on using the Cast God Court to make a God Spirit gene race, but he knew doing that would take a long time. The battles were going to start soon, so he delayed his plans.

The three days flew by. Feng Fei Fei’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse was not from Jade Wall City, so she left Jade Wall City to participate in the god fights.

Li Bing Yu used it as an excuse to depart Jade Wall City for a time and returned to Wu Wei Dao Palace. Before she went, Li Bing Yu believed she could kill Qin Bai and destroy the bloodline of the Qin Kingdom.

In fact, she had many chances. After she learned more about Han Sen, she realized any attempt she made would not be successful.

Even if Han Sen was not around, she would be unable to kill Qin Bai.

If Jian Bu Gu and Bao’er, with her small flying fish, were around, she could not accomplish her task. Everyone around her was insanely powerful.

“Leader, you have returned!” All the members of the palace witnessed Li Bing Yu’s return. It surprised them. Su Ling’er looked happy.

Li Bing Yu said her trip would be dangerous. Her making it back was enough to make Su Ling’er and the others feel very happy. “Is the group still good?” Li Bing Yu coldly asked.

“With Teacher Ling here, the party has been fine,” Su Ling’er replied.

Upon seeing their faces, Li Bing Yu knew something must have happened.

Back in the day, Jian Bu Gu exiled the Wu Wei Dao Palace out of the Qin Kingdom. Li Bing Yu’s teacher died in the middle of their battle. The leader didn’t have a successor in line to succeed him, so the young Li Bing Yu took over the position of leadership. She was only 20 years old at the time and shouldered the critical task of leading the company.

Wu Wei Dao Palace was comprised of nine big sects. Wei Group was the weakest of them all. For Li Bing Yu to lead Bu Wei Group until this day took her a lot of effort. The things she had done were things most people could not imagine. After all, this was a dog-eat-dog world. Even in the Wu Wei Dao Palace, Bu Wei Group was the most bullied sect. Students in Bu Wei Group were always bullied. Li Bing Yu tried her best to change that. Without someone strong sitting there, it was hard for the group to be considered on par with the other eight groups. “Su Ling’er, from now on, you will control Bu Wei Group. You will be the leader for now.” The door to the Bu Wei Group’s hall was accessed by a token. Li Bing Yu gave Su Ling’er the token that provided access to the Bu Wei Group.

“Leader, what is this?” Su Ling’er did not take the token. She sincerely looked at Li Bing Yu.

“I am going to Bu Wei Well,” Li Bing Yu coldly said.

Su Ling’er was shocked. “Leader, you cannot go! It is too dangerous there. Bu Wei Group has had so many people enter Bu Wei Well, and none of them made it back out alive. Maybe a thousand didn’t go inside, but there had to be at least 800.”

Li Bing Yu stopped Su Ling’er from talking any further. Han Sen’s face kept flashing in her mind. She started to look determined. “This world is changing. More and more elites are showing up. If we cannot follow the rhythm of the world, we will eventually be exiled from it.”

“You don’t have to go to the Bu Wei Well,” Su Ling’er said. “There are many other ways to become stronger.”

Li Bing Yu shook her head. “They’re not good enough. Those other ways cannot make me stronger. Only the gene races of the Bu Wei Well can push me to be stronger and make me capable of fighting the elites.”

Su Ling’er wished to say something, but Li Bing Yu stopped her again.

“With this thing, if I don’t make it out from Bu Wei Well, you will be Bu Wei Group’s leader.” Li Bing Yu passed the token on to Su Ling’er. She then turned around and left.

Su Ling’er wished to chase after her, but she heard Li Bing Yu coldly shout, “Stop it! Do your duty! This is my life, and that is your life!”

Su Ling’er’s eyes trembled. Seeing the back of Li Bing Yu fade into the darkness of Bu Wei Group’s farthest reaches, she did not say another word.

Three days later, the fighting roster was finally available for all to see.

In front of the light screen, people’s names were everywhere. Each name had a title. They all had some kind of god associated with them.

Han Sen used Dollar for his title. The words before his name were God of Wealth. That meant Dollar’s Blood – Pulse came from God of Wealth. He was representing God of Wealth.

Han Sen went to look further and saw Bao’er’s Ingot and Feng Yin Yin’s Lucky also had the additional title of God Wealth too. While Feng Yin Yin had God of Wealth’s Blood-Pulse, neither Han Sen nor Bao’er did. He still had the title of God of Wealth all the same. Han Sen guessed it might have been because of them joining the fight from the God of Wealth Temple.

Bao’er was very excited. She was checking out her opponent.

The opponent’s name was surprisingly ordinary. It was very normal. It was the sort of name one would not pick out from a list. None of those gods had fame. Han Sen had never heard of such God Spirits before. He thought they couldn’t be high-class God Spirits supporting them.

Feng Yin Yin’s opponents were the same. Han Sen imagined they could easily get through the first round of knockouts, so he went ahead to check out his opponent. He had never heard of his opponent’s name before either. That being said, the name of the God Spirit supporting his opponent was a name Han Sen was familiar with.

It was Empty God. It was one of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits that were space elements, but it was not an absolute space element. It also had the buffs of a mysterious element. It was the most mysterious God Spirit out of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits.

Legends claimed that Empty God was born in the chaos of the sky and the ground opening. It was a very old and powerful God Spirit. Now, Empty God was a guardian God Spirit of the Yan Kingdom. The opponent’s name was Yan Bei Fei. Han Sen could tell he was a royal of the Yan Kingdom.

Although Han Sen did not know Yan Bei Fei, the man was very famous in the universe.

When people spoke about the Fei Yan Swordsman, it was something known by everyone in the seven kingdoms.

Yan Bei Fei was also looking at the roster list. He noticed his opponent was Dollar, who belonged to God of Wealth.

“Second Brother, I can’t believe you and I have such a big difference. I am afraid we can only fight when we are in the top eight.” A man was at Yan Bei Fei and laughing.

“Yan Dan, this fight will get you up. I will let the world know that the Yan Kingdom has a new hero too,” Yan Bei Fei looked at the man with confidence.

“Second Brother, you do not have to say that,” Yan Dan said. “Your talent and potential are greater than mine. You are stronger as well. We have a chance.”

Yan Bei Fei shook his head. “I checked the roster. If nothing goes awry, we will encounter Zhuo Dong Lai in the top eight.”

“It’s him!” Yan Dan’s face changed.

Yan Bei Fei’s eyes looked aflame. “That’s good. I will use all the power to prevent Zhuo Dong Lai from breaching the top eight. I will clear a path for you to get to the top four. Do not disappoint me.”

Yan Dan looked serious. He bowed on the ground and said, “Dan will go into the top two.”
