  The xenogeneic looked like it had been made entirely from silver. It sort of looked like a trilobite. It was, however, one meter long.

When Han Sen saw the trilobite-looking silver xenogeneic, he frowned. In his dream, he had not encountered this xenogeneic.

“Is it an Ancient God xenogeneic that Dream Beast was unaware of?” Han Sen remained in thought, not yet ready to take action.

He killed the Ghost Face Spiders so confidently because he knew what they were. But facing something unknown was dodgy, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to take the risk.

“Do you know of this xenogeneic?” Han Sen looked at Hai’er.

Hai’er just shook her head. “You should fire a shot into the water. Perhaps there are other silver xenogeneics lurking within.”

Han Sen frowned. Without knowing what he was getting into, he didn’t want to fire a bullet. Ghost Face Spiders weren’t intelligent, so they were unable to discern where the bullets were fired from. It did not mean that the other xenogeneics were the same, however. Attacking randomly, without caution, could put them in danger.

They were bound by the powers that governed Ancient God space. While that did not affect their strength, their speed was definitely lowered. Their reactions to danger would be much slower. They couldn’t take unnecessary risks.

After letting silence settle in for a bit, Han Sen moved his fingers. A red gas drifted out of his fingertips. A reaper appeared, clutching a red crystal scythe. It took off flying around the cave before heading for the pool of water near the waterfall.

Hai’er looked at the red reaper with curiosity. She was used to Han Sen possessing all manners of tricks, but she was still interested in finding out what the reaper was capable of.

When the reaper reached the water, the water exploded. A trilobite-looking xenogeneic suddenly emerged, leaping up to consume the red reaper.

The red reaper’s reaction was fast, however, and it struck the creature’s silver shell. The reaper was a powerful little thing, but all it did was leave a minor mark across the shell. It certainly couldn’t break through it.

Pang! Pang! Pang!

More silver xenogeneics leapt out of the water. They were like cannonballs, shooting up towards the red reaper.

The red reaper’s scythe could not bear the brunt of such force, and one of the silver xenogeneics was able to strike its body. Fortunately, the red reaper was made of smoke. After the silver xenogeneic broke its misty form, it was able to quickly recompose itself.

But the silver xenogeneics weren’t going to give up, and they repeatedly tried to attack the red reaper.

When a xenogeneic’s jaws closed on the red reaper’s scythe, the weapon was bitten off. Then, more and more silver xenogeneics leapt up to bite the red scythe itself. Not long after, it had all been chomped and broken to pieces.

The red crystal scythe was the strongest weapon that the red reaper had at its disposal. It was also its greatest weakness. Once it was broken, the red reaper would disappear.

After the red reaper was destroyed, the silver xenogeneics started swimming around in the water like a legion of crocodiles on the prowl for human flesh.

“They have some very strong bodies. And not to mention their physical power… These things must rank amongst the best of Earls out there. There are dozens of them, too. This will be tough to deal with,” Han Sen said quietly.

If he only had to deal with the silver xenogeneics he had seen so far, he wouldn’t be afraid. But if the Earl ones were that powerful, then the power of a potential Marquise one would be unimaginable.

Han Sen rested for a bit, then recomposed the red reaper. He sent it out to the water again.

The silver xenogeneics weren’t deep in the water yet, so the red reaper swooped down on one. And then, the silver xenogeneic sunk.

The other silver xenogeneics started coming after the red reaper again. Han Sen turned his sniper rifle into a rocket launcher, then he mounted it on his shoulder and fired it at the red reaper.

A group comprised of a dozen silver xenogeneics latched onto the red reaper’s scythe, breaking it immediately, just as the rocket came.

Boom!

A white mushroom light exploded from the midst of the silver xenogeneic crowd. The strength blew each and every one of the xenogeneics away.

But those silver xenogeneics’ bodies glowed with a strange aura. They remained inside the fire, and the rocket’s explosive power was unable to destroy their bodies.

“That is a powerful protection they possess. Not even Spell can break through it.” Han Sen complimented them. “Why are you still standing there? Run!” Hai’er said, before starting to run.

The silver xenogeneics were traveling towards them really quickly, scrambling over the stones. Their speed was frightening.

Han Sen did not move, though. He stood firm with his rocket launcher, then fired another rocket at the silver xenogeneics.

This time, however, he had glazed the effects of Turtle atop the rocket.

Boom!

A rocket exploded in the middle of the waves of silver xenogeneics. They had an aura around them, shielding them from the explosion. It also protected them from Turtle, preventing the symbol from sticking on them. It had been blocked.

Buzz!

Before Han Sen could attack again, a silver xenogeneic flew out from that belly button. It looked like the first one they had seen in the water. This one had transparent silver wings, though. It was able to fly very fast.

There were four or five of them flying out towards Han Sen, in total. They soon reached the frontlines, soaring towards him.

Han Sen did not fall back. He pulled out the Blood Feather Knife and used his knife and sword power on the blade. Then, he slashed towards the silver winged xenogeneic nearest him.

The knife and sword power hit the silver winged xenogeneic and activated its armor, but that scary knife and sword power was sufficient to break the auras and hew the body of the silver winged xenogeneic in half.

“Mutant Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Silver Winged Beetle: xenogeneic gene found. Obtained mutant Silver Winged Beetle beast soul.”

Han Sen was happy, but he didn’t have time to stop and look at his new beast soul. He was running towards the nearest silver beetle that was coming his way.

He killed one of the silver beetles that could not fly. Those silver beetles weren’t mutant. They were just ordinary Earl silver beetles.

While Han Sen was having fun killing the beetles, something screamed near the silver statue. There was a silver, glasslike monster coming out. Its body was over ten meters long. Its head possessed a silver beard, and there were four transparent wings on its back. It was already before Han Sen.

A silver light came out of its mouth, moving much faster than knife lights and sword airs.
