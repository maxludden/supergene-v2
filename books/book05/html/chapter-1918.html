<p>Before they could do anything, Han Sen had already flown over
towards the ball of light and grabbed it before it could explode.
The red thing looked like a glob of jelly in Han Sen’s hand.
Without a single mote of hesitation, Han Sen shoved it into his
mouth and swallowed it.</p>
<p>Rebecca and the other Earls were infuriated, but another red orb
was coming.</p>
<p>“That is the third drop of springwater, so there must be much to
earn here!” Rebecca and the other Earls wished to grab the coming
ball.</p>
<p>But the same thing happened again, with Han Sen moving too
quickly. Before the ball of light could even explode, Han Sen had
grabbed it and gobbled it down.</p>
<p>The red, jelly-like liquid surged with power inside Han Sen’s
belly, and such overbearing strength felt as if it could tear Han
Sen apart. So, Han Sen quickly used his Yin Yang Change. He turned
that power into energy he could use, and then he let The Story of
Genes absorb it.</p>
<p>Transforming that energy was difficult. The springwater’s
incredible power was swelling inside his veins, and it coursed
throughout his entire body with a ceaseless cycle. Every time it
did, a certain amount of it would be converted into energy that was
suitable for Han Sen.</p>
<p>As this occurred, Han Sen’s blood vessels endured stress that
was akin to being repeatedly cut by knives. It was very
painful.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept quiet as he suffered the pain of this exchange,
though. He looked at the spring’s eye, and he hoped to see more
springwater coming out.</p>
<p>The springwater had been surprisingly quick in the beginning,
and it was now coming at the speed of light. No one could react
when the water first appeared. But whenever the waterdrops finally
began to slow down, Han Sen was still the first to react. Han Sen
was far faster than the Earls, and they had no hope of competing
against him.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Another red flash came out of the spring’s eye. Another red orb
of springwater shot skyward out.</p>
<p>Rebecca shouted, “You guys go and stop Han Sen! I will take the
springwater, and then split it up. Otherwise, with Han Sen’s speed,
he’ll keep us from getting anything!”</p>
<p>Those that had been chosen to come to the spring were not
stupid. The other elites were Earls, and it was why they had been
selected by the Kings. After hearing Rebecca, the Earls immediately
moved to prevent Han Sen from obtaining any more of the water.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a great deal of scary power turned to target Han Sen.
The Earls summoned their strength, and although they did not expect
to kill Han Sen outright, they at least thought they could stall
him for a time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Rebecca sprinted after the red ball. If another
Earl had volunteered to go after the red ball, the others might not
be so trusting, but Rebecca was Moon Wheel King’s eldest daughter.
She wouldn’t break her promise to share the springwater, as that
would cost not only her own reputation but her father’s as
well.</p>
<p>Suddenly, dragons roared. Scary lights, smokes, and shadows were
pursuing Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s movement changed again, as if he was dancing. His body
accelerated and flickered right past the attacks of the Earls. As
he passed Rebecca, he snagged the drop of springwater that had
almost been within Rebecca’s grasp.</p>
<p>“His speed is like that of a Duke!” Rebecca and the other Earls
were flabbergasted, in addition to being furious.</p>
<p>He was just a Baron, and even so, he had those scary shoes that
granted him such unbelievable speed. Against it, the Earls did not
stand a chance. It made them incredibly angry.</p>
<p>It was worse to know that as soon as Han Sen grabbed a droplet
of water, he would swallow it whole without leaving behind even a
single scrap.</p>
<p>Even more confusing was the fact that when Han Sen swallowed the
springwater, his body should have been impacted by the overwhelming
power. It should have been ravaging his insides and making him feel
like he was dying. Yet Han Sen had swallowed so many without
showing any reaction. He wasn’t exhibiting any emotion, so it was
like he wasn’t enduring any pain.</p>
<p>Ordinary people, after swallowing one droplet, could become
Barons. A Baron that swallowed a dozen could become a Viscount.</p>
<p>Han Sen had swallowed four or five of the red orbs. Each of
those contained seven or eight drops. He must have consumed at
least thirty of the drops by now, and yet, nothing seemed to have
changed.</p>
<p>They had no clue what was going on inside Han Sen’s body,
though. Secretly, it really did feel as if he was getting cut up.
But Han Sen had endured a lot of pain over the years, and he could
handle and hide it far better than most people could. That was how
he could refine the springwater and still fight Rebecca.</p>
<p>Rebecca and the others could not detect this, but the Kings
could.</p>
<p>“Knife Queen has a brilliant eye. He can endure so much pain,
and yet he remains so calm. He hasn’t made a single mistake. I
don’t think I could have performed so well when I was in my youth,”
Black-Moon King said in admiration.</p>
<p>Night River King, on the other hand, looked awful. He said, “So?
There have been four or five of the red mist orbs. He must have
claimed around thirty drops without leveling up. With that talent,
do you honestly believe he can become a King?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? It is hard to tell.” Black-Moon King smiled.</p>
<p>Flower King and Moon Wheel King were watching the happenings of
the valley, too. Flower King frowned. “This red mist spring offers
a lot. It might even erupt a few more times! Han Sen’s shoes are
too weird. They give him the speed of a Duke. Rebecca and the
others aren’t able to collect any of the springwater.”</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King smiled and said, “Maybe not.”</p>
<p>Flower King looked at Moon Wheel King with shock. Moon Wheel
King didn’t elaborate, but Flower King could guess what he was
hinting at.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Another red orb came out of the springwater. Han Sen fired his
power to get over towards it. Seven or eight Earls roared together
and unleashed their powers, but they still couldn’t match Han Sen’s
speed. He moved directly in front of the orb.</p>
<p>Rebecca wore a complex expression. She was holding a spell card
that was in the shape of a turtle. Light glowed from the symbols on
the card. It looked as if she didn’t want to use it, but she
gritted her teeth and threw it at Han Sen.</p>
<p>It traveled through the air and landed on Han Sen. Han Sen
couldn’t dodge, and the spell card attached itself to his body.</p>
<p>When the turtle spell card landed on Han Sen, he felt his body
become heavy. He began to slow down, and gravity dragged so heavily
on his body that he almost fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood was boiling. So, he reached out a hand and
grabbed the red mist glob before he fell.</p>
