  A snow-white spear flew out of the arsenal behind Weapon God. It landed in front of Weapon God. His two hands gripped the long spear. The long spear’s spear mind went into the sky. Han Sen and the others felt chills run down their spines as the mountains and fields around started to shake. Things were shattering everywhere. The spear-type weapons on the ground exploded with scary power. It released many spear lights that shocked the sky. They were all headed toward the long spear in Weapon God’s hands.

The long spear absorbed the power of the sky full of spears. The spear god light grew increasingly stronger. The snow-white spear’s body and fire turned black. It was like an inky fire spear light was breaking through space. It shook along the body of the spear.

“A Break World power!” Han Sen was a little bit surprised, but he immediately reacted.

Soldier Knife Sky’s gene races were a bit weird. They were not purely gene races. The buffer zone between the two universes was tainted by the geno universe a bit. Although the effect was minimal, many spear gene race powers had gathered atop Weapon God’s big spear so that the spear could force and break the world.

“Break World Spear Kill!” Weapon God coldly shouted. The tip of the big spear in his hands created a cold light that was madly going toward Han Sen. The light was fast, cruel and accurate. Its power was very focused. It had scary features that made it seem indestructible.

Han Sen’s sword was not weird. The Inch Grey Sword went straight to meet with the tip of the spear. Seeing the Inch Grey Sword was about to strike the tip of the spear, the tip of the spear’s gold light suddenly split. It created a meteor shower with lots of stars. They covered Han Sen from top to bottom and blocked every possible avenue he could take advantage of to evade the strike.

Han Sen frowned. The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra were cast together. They smashed through the world. The Inch Grey Sword in his hands was breaking and slashing.

Katcha!

The light of the spear was shattered by the Inch Grey Sword. At the same time, the big spear that had gathered up countless spear gene race power was broken.

Han Sen was shocked about how powerful the Inch Grey Sword was. His Break World power was not just an attacking power, yet it could break the Break World big spear. It had obviously benefitted by how sharp the Inch Grey Sword was.

“It is no wonder it is a sword that the master used,” Weapon God said to himself. His eyes also looked brighter. His hands were wide open. The weaponry on his back was glowing. All the weapons started to glow.

Knives, spears, swords, halberds, axes, onoes, hooks, tridents, and various other weapons flickered with a shocking god light. The entire ocean of weapons that populated Soldier Knife Sky glowed with mesmerizing light. All that light went to imbue the array of weaponry behind Weapon God.

There were many types of weapons within that arsenal. The entire Soldier Knife Sky’s weapon gene races looked as if they had been summoned by a god. They all gave their power to the weaponry.

The power was not the power of all the gene races, but it was like a Soldier Knife Sky mini world. The creatures of the world all lent it a part of their power. How scary was this power that had gathered up?

The armor that Weapon God wore beneath that scary power underwent some changes. It turned pitch-black. Scary black flames were burning on it. It was like space was burning alongside it.

Han Sen looked a bit dim. He spoke to Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach, saying, “You guys get the crown prince out of here for now. I’ll handle things here.”

Weapon God had borrowed the world’s power, so he knew he should not underestimate him. Even if Han Sen was not afraid, he was afraid of the battle power having an adverse effect on Qin Bai.

“Mister Han, safety first!” Thousand Mile Reach shouted. He picked up Qin Bai, ripped space, and disappeared.

Jia Shi Zhen wanted to pick up Bao’er, but the girl was quick to leap onto Han Sen’s shoulder. So, she flew away solo.

They were powerful, but they were only as powerful as humans. If they did not combine with a God Spirit, no one would dare fight a God Spirit elite.

Weapon God did not care for the small critters fleeing the scene. All he cared for was the Inch Grey Sword. It looked as if the sword mattered a lot to him.

“Go to hell!” Weapon God opened his hands. The weaponry behind him shattered. They turned into a hundred kinds of different weapons. Every weapon had a scary Break World power. All of it was going for Han Sen. Han Sen’s eyes froze. The Break World power exploded. The Inch Grey Sword in his hands slashed. Suddenly, he broke a few weapons. No matter how sharp the Inch Grey Sword was, breaking those big weapons was sure to take time. By the time he broke a few weapons, the rest of the weapons had reached Han Sen’s body.

Boom!

Han Sen’s body suddenly turned into a white shadow. He looked like a God Spirit with a semi-transparent body that had white light that could explode. His body power moved.

The weapons with Break World power slashed against Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode. It was like they were coming down on cotton. They only made the Super God Spirit cave in. They did not break his form.

Han Sen used the Inch Grey Sword to protect Bao’er on his shoulder

“It looks like not all the Break World powers can damage my Super God Spirit. Moon God’s level is nothing comparable to this Weapon God.” Han Sen’s heart felt a whole lot safer. He saw all the weapons come down on his body while his body shone with a god light that shook them all away.

“What!” Seeing the sky full of flying and dancing break into pieces, Weapon God’s face looked extremely shocked. That was an incredibly powerful power to witness. He had only seen the God Chaos Party leader do something comparable.

Han Sen looked cold. The Inch Grey Sword in his hands moved. He suddenly ripped space and made Weapon God’s giant armor-clad self be split in two.

“Without the rules of the universe suppressing, I feel wonderful. It looks like my Super God Spirit mode is still stronger than the Break World power.” Han Sen felt incredibly good. Without restrictions and combined with his battle power, Super God Spirit mode was not something an Annihilation God Spirit could overcome.

He was just a beginner when it came to Break World powers. When talking about his progress with Break World powers, one could say he was not as good as Weapon God. His Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra’s Break World power didn’t focus on combat, so they were not as effective as Han Sen using his Super God Spirit mode.

Weapon God’s body turned into starlight, and he faded away. Of course, he did not die. Han Sen knew his true body was still in the god temple being reborn. If the god base was still there, it would never die.

When he looked at Weapon God Temple, Han Sen’s body teleported straight into it. Weapon God was in the middle of respawning atop the altar.

“I need more god bases. Thank you for your kindness.” Han Sen raised his Inch Grey Sword and slashed it toward the altar of Weapon God’s body.

The white Super God Spirit power generated a sword light. It was like a knife that could slay the sky. It made the god altar and Weapon God being regenerated be split in half. The powerful sword light cut the entire temple in half.

Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach escorted Qin Bai over to the rendezvous with Jian Bu Gu. They looked back and saw a sword light come from a weird god temple and burst into the sky, splitting the giant Weapon God Temple in two. It crumbled like a mountain. The ground and mountains nearby quaked.
