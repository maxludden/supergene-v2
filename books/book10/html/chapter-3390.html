<p>Han Sen wondered what Floating Kill would have thought if he
knew the real situation. If he had not resisted, Han Sen would not
have killed him.</p>
<p>Because Floating Kill used the sky floating kill to try and
restrict Han Sen, and he used the space crack orb’s power, it
triggered Han Sen’s body’s natural reaction.</p>
<p>If Floating Kill had tried to escape like a normal person and
not fight back, it would have been hard for Han Sen to kill
him.</p>
<p>It was a shame that an escape was exactly what resulted in his
death. Who would have thought that would happen?</p>
<p>Floating Kill was not a Break World beast. Killing him did not
yield a Break World gene. He looked around. An hour had yet to go
by. The stone clocks were still spinning.</p>
<p>To Han Sen, this was all pointless. His body was not afraid of
time power. Time Sky was a big place, but there was nowhere now he
was no longer able to reach.</p>
<p>“It is a shame that I am unable to find out which stone clock is
the sky clock. I still have to wait until the spinning has stopped
before testing them too.” After Han Sen thought about it, he did
not plan on going anywhere. He was just going to wait where he was
for time to end.</p>
<p>Not long later, one hour of the time cycle came to an end. Over
the course of the next hour, Time Sky did not exhibit any weird
changes.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked to the nearest needle and checked it out.</p>
<p>The clocks in the Alliance had three different needles. There
was a needle for the hours, minutes, and seconds. The clocks in
Time Sky only had one needle. It did not represent the seconds or
the minutes, but it did not represent the hour needle either. In
theory, it should have represented the hour needle since every
section it went through meant one hour. In this place, it actually
represented two hours.</p>
<p>All of the stone clocks were like this. Now, all of the stone
clock needles had stopped and been no longer moving.</p>
<p>The stone needles did not look like delicate things. Their shape
and design had many natural flaws. They looked rather smooth. They
did not match up with the clocks of greater technology, but there
was a vintage feeling when it came to them.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out his hand to touch the giant stone needle. He
felt as if a chilly feeling was going to prickle him.</p>
<p>The frosty feeling was a consequence of the needle’s natural
temperature. If this was before, Han Sen would not have had this
heightened sense of feeling. He would have had to use Dongxuan Aura
to sense such a thing. Now, the stronger his body was, the lower
his sensitivity was.</p>
<p>It was like people who practiced fist-fighting. Their fists were
hard and would mature. If their fists hit things that had altered
temperatures or a lack of resistance, they would be less sensitive
to it.</p>
<p>Han Sen had such a powerful body, but his feelings were still
very sensitive. They were perhaps even more sensitive than before.
To the powers outside, they were still very powerful as well. The
only thing he could not feel was the power within himself. That
depressed Han Sen a great deal.</p>
<p>He put his hands on the needle. Han Sen exerted all the power he
could and pushed the stone needle clockwise.</p>
<p>Han Sen had his share of doubts regarding truthfulness when it
came to what Ancient Devil had told him, but the explanation
Ancient Devil had given him was something fairly decent. It made
sense, so Han Sen decided to believe him.</p>
<p>According to Ancient Devil, the stone clocks were usually
connected to Time Sky. One movement was able to affect the entire
body. Moving one needle was like affecting the entire rule powers
of Time Sky. Even if Qin Xiu was there, he might not have been able
to do any pushing.</p>
<p>The sky clock was Time Sky’s essence. It was the only thing that
could change the rule powers of Time Sky, so only it could be
pushed alone.</p>
<p>Of course, that all depended on whether or not the sky clock was
willing to be pushed. If it did not want him to push it, it would
not move.</p>
<p>“No matter what, it all depends on luck.” Han Sen felt a bit
angry. He did not like the concept of luck because his luck had
always been vile.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his power to push the needle. He soon heard a
“katcha” sound. The giant stone needle moved. Han Sen had been
pushing it for a while. Eventually, time moved.</p>
<p>“Am I really that lucky? Did I actually find the sky clock?” Han
Sen was very happy. He tried pushing some more. He did not push
hard, but he was able to push the needle a little.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! My luck is back. Ancient Devil! Ancient Devi! You were
so not willing to come with me, and now I found the sky clock
first. You are going to regret this so much.” Han Sen was so
excited that he wanted to laugh at the sky. He had existed for a
very long time, and he had finally struck a jackpot.</p>
<p>After feeling that happy, Han Sen swiftly felt terrible. Even
though he had found the sky clock, he did not know how to convince
the sky clock to move.</p>
<p>“The sky clock is the key to Time Sky. It is just like Sky King
and the other life forces. They have high intelligence.” Han Sen
looked at the stone needle. He then spoke to the stone needle. “Sky
Clock, if you are willing to obey me, I promise you will have a
fine laugh. Otherwise, don’t take it out on me for being mean to
you. I will break your needle or your soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to threaten it for a while. He did that for so
long that he felt his mouth was going to break. After all that
time, the stone clock still did not react.</p>
<p>“It looks like you won’t know what regret is unless I use my
strength.” When Han Sen was ready to push the needle further, his
heart jumped. He thought, “Hang on! Was Ancient Devil lying to me?
What if all the stone clocks can be pushed?”</p>
<p>Although he thought the possibility of that being the case was
low, due to Ancient Devil being right about the stone clock and
needles being connected to Time Sky, in theory, he should not have
been able to push one at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen still harbored doubts. He looked around. He walked up to
another stone clock, wanting to see if the other stone clock could
be moved.</p>
<p>He moved to a stone clock that was the size of a football field.
Han Sen did not hesitate to put his hand on the stone needle. He
pushed it a little.</p>
<p>With that small push, the pillar-like needle was pushed really
far. The whole area of time around sped up. It was like things
fast-forwarded for a while.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Holy shit! Ancient Devil, that asshole, lied
to me. But that doesn’t make sense. How am I able to push it?” He
thought the stone needle should not have been able to be pushed,
but the facts were in front of him. He had no choice but to believe
it.</p>
<p>Han Sen readied himself to go out and look for Ancient Devil. He
suddenly heard an exciting sound not too far away. “Sky clock…. Sky
clock… I finally found sky clock.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. He went to take a look. He saw a man with
bright eyes pushing a stone needle. That person thought Han Sen had
found the sky clock.</p>
