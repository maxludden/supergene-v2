<p>Han Sen had walked the sky jade steps, and everyone knew
Thousand Feather Crane had to carry him into Sky Palace.</p>
<p>This was far too weird, though. Han Sen had almost passed out
when he was brought inside. Thousand Feather Crane continued
carrying him until they reached the leader of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen was drifting in and out of consciousness. He couldn’t
see what the leader of Sky Palace looked like, but he was brought
back out by Thousand Feather Crane.</p>
<p>Something this strange had never happened before, so there was
much discussion surrounding the event.</p>
<p>“This must be the first time the old man has met with someone
that was carried in. I heard his own beard bent in surprise.”</p>
<p>“How could he walk the Road to the Sky like that? That guy’s
unique.”</p>
<p>“Or more like creepy. Haha!”</p>
<p>“No matter how creepy he is, the old man still accepted him. He
still managed to obtain a placement in White Jade Building. He is
lucky to be Knife Queen’s student.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The old man respects Knife Queen, and she is really good.
The old man really does treat her like a proper student. It does
seem weird that she would take on a student as strange as the one
she did.”</p>
<p>Han Sen slept for twenty-four hours straight. After that, he was
fully recovered. The feelings of suppression had finally faded.</p>
<p>After waking, he found himself lying on a jade bed. The room had
nothing, in terms of decor. It was a stone house with a jade bed, a
stone table, and four stone stools.</p>
<p>Han Sen stretched and felt pretty good. Letting those harsh
feelings into his body had been an excruciating thing to suffer,
but it hadn’t been in vain. Han Sen hadn’t been able to figure out
how to make his Dongxuan Aura into something solid, but he still
learned something important from accepting that feeling.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was suppressed by the Jade Turtle Spell, the
Dongxuan Aura had simulated the workings of the technique. That was
how he was able to tear the spell off.</p>
<p>Since then, Han Sen had frequently played with the spell. He
used Dongxuan Aura to study it, but the spell’s power was very
complicated. It was difficult for him to learn its workings, and he
made little progress.</p>
<p>But when Sky Palace entered his body while he was on the stairs,
he felt there was something in common with Jade Turtle Spell.</p>
<p>Sky Palace only imbued a feeling without applying anything
solid, and Jade Turtle Spell’s energy flow was too hard to
understand completely. When they were both compared, however, the
comparison opened Han Sen’s mind. He felt happy.</p>
<p>As he learned more, he noticed it had things in common with
Dollar, too. By continuing to examine the skills, he was able to
learn a lot more.</p>
<p>While he could still feel the wisps of that suppression, Han Sen
pulled out Jade Turtle Spell and used Dongxuan Aura to dive in. He
tried to learn something from the spell, so he could confirm his
theories.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat on the jade bed as he looked over the Jade Turtle
Spell. But he quickly found that the Jade Turtle Spell behaved as
if it had grown weaker. It used to be like jade, but now it was
like rock.</p>
<p>Two days later, the Jade Turtle Spell suddenly cracked and
became dust. It had become useless.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, but he was happy about this. He had learned
a lot.</p>
<p>Han Sen had disappeared for a few days, and rumors were floating
around the palace. People believed Han Sen had been in a mini-coma
for days, and that he had incurred serious injuries. He had only
been there for a few days, and he hadn’t met many people at all.
Yet despite that, he had become quite famous.</p>
<p>Many of the students in Sky Palace were curious. They wanted to
know what sort of person Han Sen was.</p>
<p>Han Sen exited his stone house and noticed that he was standing
on a floating island. It was more like a large rock than an island,
though. Outside of the house, the ground around him was only about
half the size of a baseball field.</p>
<p>On that small island, there was a crooked tree. Han Sen did not
know what type of tree it was, but it looked half-dead, and it was
covered in scorch marks. Its leaves were all yellow, and it looked
ready to fall down at any given moment.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. The island was small, but it was very
close to the primary isle. It was one of the closest islands to the
main island, actually.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around, and then he heard a bird. An elegant man
riding a big white bird flew down and landed on the island.</p>
<p>Thank you for carrying me into Sky Palace,” Han Sen said with
genuine gratitude.</p>
<p>Han Sen was focused on the feelings of oppression, but he still
remembered being carried into Sky Palace. If he hadn’t received
that aid, he would have been crushed on the stairs.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane shook his head and said, “Bringing you to
Sky Palace was my duty. There is no need to thank me.”</p>
<p>After that, Thousand Feather Crane brought out a tablet for Han
Sen and said, “This is a Sky Palace identity tablet. It will show
others the level of authority and access you have within Sky
Palace. Make sure you don’t lose it! If you lose it, you will have
to go to Clear Hall. If you don’t, you will be punished.”</p>
<p>“Sky Torture Peak has a tablet with rules inscribed upon it. You
should go and take a look, just so you don’t end up unknowingly
breaking the rules,” Thousand Feather Crane said.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Thousand Feather. Can I meet the palace leader now?”
Han Sen put away the tablet.</p>
<p>“The leader has already seen you; there is no need for you to
see him. He has given you permission to go to the White Jade Jing.
Your identity tablet will allow you to practice there. It will help
you.”</p>
<p>“Where is White Jade Jing?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane pointed at Han Sen’s identity tablet.
“White Jade Jing has twelve floors and five cities. If the angels
there touch my head, my hair will grow. White Jade Jing is a place
for practicing. Simply being given permission to go there is a high
honor. You will have to practice hard there, and not waste this
glorious opportunity.” Thousand Feather Crane hopped onto his white
bird to leave.</p>
<p>“Thousand Feather, where are you going?” Han Sen quickly
asked.</p>
<p>“I am going to practice in White Jade Jing!” Thousand Feather
Crane answered.</p>
<p>“Great! I don’t know the way there. Could you please take me?”
Han Sen said, as he quickly hopped onto the bird.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane looked depressed, but he did not say
anything. He flew the big white bird to one of the floating
islands.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace is great. If this was in the Alliance, this would
make a grand place for tourists.” Han Sen saw so many strange
scenes and heavenly-looking buildings.</p>
