<h2>Liyu Zhen Does Not Believe It</h2>

<p>“That is impossible! I bet he didn’t even kill 1000 King star
beetles. How can you claim he did a better job than me?” Liyu Zhen
demanded. He simply couldn’t believe this.</p>
<p>He knew Han Sen had been chased by a deified star beetle the
whole time. There was no way he could still have done a better job
than one of the Very High.</p>
<p>“Go take a look. You can find out for yourself.” Instead of
explaining, the old man gestured absently up at the tree.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen had received a recommendation for this job. The old
man didn’t really care about Liyu Zhen’s personal feelings, but he
still owed the young man an explanation. Otherwise, others would
question the choice. Han Sen wouldn’t earn the job properly, and
people would speak ill of the events of the day.</p>
<p>Instead of going and looking for himself, Liyu Zhen simply
turned to Han Sen. “How many King star beetles did you kill?”</p>
<p>“Three thousand six hundred and fourteen,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“Impossible! You were being chased by the deified star beetle.
Even if you weren’t, you couldn’t have killed that many star
beetles in such a short amount of time.” Liyu Zhen’s eyes were
filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>Because they weren’t allowed to harm the star tree when they
fought, they couldn’t use geno arts that had an area-of-effect.
They had to kill the beetles one-by-one with great care. Killing
2000 in a single day was a shocking sum in itself. But Han Sen
claimed to have killed 3614. That was the sort of tally reserved
for deifieds only. It should have been impossible for him to
achieve that.</p>
<p>And Han Sen had to spend additional time traveling. So he had
spent less than a day killing the fiends.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled, but he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen’s face hardened. He teleported up to visit where Han
Sen had been.</p>
<p>Quickly, Liyu Zhen found the star beetles that Han Sen had
killed. When he first saw them, he thought they were alive. It
didn’t look as if any damage had been done to them.</p>
<p>But their lifeforce was all gone. They were dead.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen frowned. He examined the body of the nearest star
beetle and discovered the tiny wound on the star beetle’s
forehead.</p>
<p>“One hit to kill them by severing their nervous systems. That
way the beetles had no time to struggle. That is both a very
powerful geno art and a remarkable control of power,” Liyu Zhen
murmured.</p>
<p>But he didn’t believe Han Sen could have killed 3614 star
beetles. Geno arts that accurate could only be used in very
favorable conditions, and executing a strike like that would be
impossible while being chased by a deified star beetle.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen quickly flew around. He found many star beetles
scattered around, all dead. There were many across the branches,
many more across the leaves… They had all died of the same precise
head wound.</p>
<p>The damage had been inflicted with such accuracy that Liyu Zhen
wasn’t sure if he could do the same even if he had time to prepare.
And if he was getting chased by a deified foe, he definitely
couldn’t have done it.</p>
<p>After a short time of searching, Liyu Zhen discovered 3000 star
beetles. He then decided to stop looking. Han Sen’s number was most
likely correct, and there was no way Han Sen could lie to the elder
about how many he killed.</p>
<p>But now, Liyu Zhen believed Han Sen must have cheated or made
use of a powerful weapon. If he hadn’t, there was no way he could
have slain so many powerful King beetles while also being
chased.</p>
<p>He teleported back to the old man. Liyu Zhen bowed to him and
said, “Uncle, can I take a look at your video of the event?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” the old man said with a shrug.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen opened the video of the test. One side of the screen
played Liyu Zhen’s test, whereas the other was a recording of Han
Sen. He didn’t watch his own video. He focused on Han Sen’s. He
watched it at eight times the normal speed, examining how Han Sen
progressed in his killing of all the beetles.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Liyu Zhen was trying to find evidence of Han
Sen cheating. But after watching for a while, Liyu Zhen’s face
slowly morphed into a mask of shock.</p>
<p>Despite the hot pursuit of the deified star beetle, Han Sen was
able to continue hunting the King class star beetles. Every time he
killed one, he moved elsewhere. His progress was as fluid as could
be, and there was a satisfaction to watching it all unfold.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Liyu Zhen came to the conclusion
that the way Han Sen killed his enemies was weird, but he hadn’t
cheated. Han Sen had treated the deified star beetle like a doll,
as if it was no more than a puppet on strings.</p>
<p>Han Sen lured it left and it went left. He lured it to the right
and it went right. It followed him like a puppy dog.</p>
<p>But Liyu Zhen knew the deified star beetle was no puppy. It was
a skilled and dangerous fighter. Even if he used a deified
treasure, Liyu Zhen didn’t think he could easily kill it.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t used any treasures, and he was still able to play
the deified star beetle like a fiddle. Liyu Zhen was at a loss. The
way Han Sen controlled his surroundings was vaguely reminiscent of
a deified using the Very High Sense. Even so, it seemed
different.</p>
<p>“Have you practiced the Very High Sense?” Liyu Zhen asked Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “I have never practiced the Very High
Sense. I used Sky Palace’s legendary knife skill Under the
Sky.”</p>
<p>Exquisite nodded and said, “Yes. He is known for his use of
Under the Sky.”</p>
<p>Since Exquisite had just confirmed it, Liyu Zhen couldn’t doubt
it any further. Han Sen was Exquisite’s silkworm, so his thoughts
couldn’t be hidden from her.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen was so annoyed. He had planned to teach Han Sen a
lesson by beating some manners into him. But he hadn’t taught Han
Sen a lesson, and on top of that, the silkworm had claimed the
guardianship of the star tree—a role that had previously been
reserved for Liyu Zhen.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen really regretted it now. He regretted suggesting they
do the test together. If he hadn’t pushed it, he wouldn’t have lost
his bid to control the tree.</p>
<p>After seeing the replay of Han Sen’s battle, Liyu Zhen didn’t
say anything more. He bowed to the old man and left. He was far too
embarrassed to stay.</p>
<p>They were both ninth-tier Kings. Han Sen had been chased by a
deified star beetle, and he had still managed to kill 1000 more
King class star beetles than Liyu Zhen. This result crushed Liyu
Zhen.</p>
<p>But when Liyu Zhen left, he took Han Sen’s video with him. No
one knew what he planned to do with it.</p>
<p>“According to the agreement, you can start off with 36 star
fruit. Why don’t I round it up and give you 40, then?” The old man
smiled, and then he went on to say, “From now on, you are in charge
of protecting the star tree. You can have 10 star fruits a month as
a reward. You can take the ones for this month now. So, for now,
you may take 50 star fruits with you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was delighted. It had been a long time since something
this good had happened to him. He quickly agreed.</p>
<p>He would only have to watch over the star tree and slay some
bugs. That would earn him 10 star fruit a month. It was easy money.
And killing the star beetles yielded a form of reward, as well.</p>
<p>Exquisite explained the method for taking the star fruit to him.
Han Sen couldn’t wait to start. He flew up toward the star fruits
that looked like suns.</p>
