Bao’er blinked and looked at Rocky Dee. After a while, she asked, “Do you know who I am?”

“Yes… No, no, no…” Rocky Dee was not making much sense.

“So, do you know me or not?” Bao’er asked with a frown.

“I am aware of your existence, but I have never seen you before,” Rocky Dee quickly said.

“Oh, in that case, tell me who you think I am,” Bao’er said. She squinted her eyes as she peered at Rocky Dee.

Rocky Dee displayed a wry smile as he said, “I would not dare say to say it. Therefore, I will not say it. If I dare say your name, this world will be thrown into chaos.”

“What is that supposed to mean?” Bao’er’s eyes repeatedly blinked.

“You must believe that I, Rocky Dee, only obey you diligently,” Rocky Dee said with sincerity. “If you are willing for me to die, I will gladly die. I will die in your service with honor.”

“I do not like the way you are talking to me now,” Bao’er said. “If you speak to me like this again, I will tear this paper man in half.” She held the paper man high up. It looked as if she was going to rip it up.

Rocky Dee remained calm. “If that can keep your secret, I am willing to give up my life for that cause.”

After that, Rocky Dee closed his eyes as if he was willingly ready to embrace a demise.

“Do you really think I am not capable of killing someone?” Bao’er’s face looked dim.

“If my death can bring you pleasure, then the pleasure is all mine,” Rocky Dee said with seriousness.

Bao’er stared at Rocky Dee for a bit. She then picked up the paper man and waved it in Rocky Dee’s direction. Rocky Dee’s body flew toward the paper man. His body grew smaller. He combined with the paper man.

The paper man was just a silhouette, but it now had color and a face. It had become a colorful paper man.

“When you want to tell me, you can come and talk to me.” Bao’er looked rather annoyed. She pulled out a book and stuck Rocky Dee, the paper man, inside the pages of the book.

After doing that, Bao’er pushed the sunglasses on her face and said to herself. “What is wrong with this guy? It really does look like he is not afraid to die.”

The dragon maid had received an order to wait outside Feng castle and wait for Han Sen’s return. She eventually saw Han Sen emerge from the castle, so she walked forward and casually said, “Come here. Follow me if you wish to see Bao’er.”

“Sure.” Han Sen did not say anything else. He nodded and followed the dragon maid.

The dragon maid opened a tunnel through space. She took Han Sen with her to travel through it. They arrived at the Paper God Temple atop a mountain.

“You wait here.” The dragon maid walked in front of the god temple and stopped. She bowed and shouted into the Paper God Temple, “Mister Minister, Han Sen is here.”

After a while of waiting for a response, none came from Rocky Dee. This made the dragon maid frown. She bowed again and said, “Mister Minister, I have brought Han Sen here.”

Still, no one answered her. The paper door of the Paper God Temple opened. A cute little girl emerged from beyond it.

Upon seeing Bao’er walk out, the dragon maid was given a fright. She quickly seemed to understand something. She was furious, so she grabbed Bao’er and shouted, “What did you do to Mister Minister?”

Bzzt!

A wooden sword flew above Bao’er. It went in front of her. The wooden sword was ordinary, but the sword mind was so holy that it was like a god one could not dare to offend. It crushed the dragon maid and pinned her to the ground. She could not straighten her back. It felt like a terrifyingly heavy sword was crushing her.

Bao’er jumped into Han Sen’s chest and complained, “Dad, you were so slow!”

“I was worried that I had come too soon and ruined your fun.” Han Sen smiled. Seeing Bao’er safe and sound, he felt immeasurably relieved and asked, “Where is Rocky Dee?”

“He is here.” Bao’er opened the book she kept next to her chest. She took out Rocky Dee’s paper form.

“This is Rocky Dee?” Han Sen looked at the paper man with shock. It did look like Rocky Dee. It was like a miniature version of him. It looked like a paper man that was drawn on top.

“What are you looking at? If it was not for Master Bao’er, you would be dead.” Rocky Dee felt furious to be looked at by Han Sen.

“You weren’t kidding, and he can speak.” Han Sen thought this was rather interesting. He held the head of the paper man and remarked how much it felt like paper.

Rocky Dee felt very embarrassed, so he shouted, “Let… Let… Let go of me!” He was still trapped in paper form, so he could not fight back. Han Sen lifted his head.

“Let go of Mister Minister!” the dragon maid madly shouted. She wanted to stand up, but the sword mind power made her bones crack. It looked as if she was going to break. She could not stand up.

“That is a very powerful sword mind. Mister Jian is stronger than I thought. It is no wonder why he is regarded as the biggest swordsman in the Qin Kingdom.” Han Sen looked at the wooden sword in shock.

The dragon maid’s power was almost similar to Decapitation Queen, but a wooden sword was able to keep her suppressed. The sword mind of its master must have been frightening.

Han Sen gave the paper man of Rocky Dee to Bao’er and asked her with curiosity, “How could he be like that?”

Bao’er pushed her sunglasses and smiled. “I simulated his power and used it back on himself. His powers were quite interesting.”

“I forgot about that trick.” Han Sen only just remembered the treasure sunglasses she had. He did not expect the power of the sunglasses was effective even in the universe of kingdoms.

Bao’er looked strange. She told Han Sen about her experience with Rocky Dee.

Han Sen was surprised to hear it. He looked at the paper man version of Rocky Dee and asked, “Rocky Dee, do you know something about Bao’er’s history? If you tell me, I can let you go.”

Rocky Dee looked at him with disdain. He lifted his lips and said, “You do not have the credentials needed to talk to me.”

“Talk to my dad nicely.” Bao’er reached out her hand and squeezed Rocky Dee’s face.

“Ow… Ow… Ow…” Rocky Dee screamed.

“Whatever,” Han Sen said. “Let’s just go back. Bring Mister Jian’s wooden sword. I am sure it is very important to him, so we should do our best to return it to Mister Jian.”

The wooden sword was an ordinary item, but the sword had Jian Bu Gu’s sword mind. It was like Jian Bu Gu’s self-sword. Han Sen did not understand why Jian Bu Gu would use a wooden sword for a self-sword.

No matter how strong a sword mind was, it was very weak. If Mister Jian encountered an enemy that was as strong as he was, the sword would be rendered useless.

Bao’er took back the wooden sword. The dragon maid was free. She turned into a big, black dragon and roared at Han Sen and Bao’er.

Pang!

Han Sen gathered up power. He punched the dragon maid and sent her flying. The giant body was like a mountain that was shaking.

“Do not kill her!” Rocky Dee shouted.

“Dad, just let her live,” Bao’er said with a blink of her eyes.
