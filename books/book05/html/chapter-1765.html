<p>“Cheap bastard! Selfish! No wonder he calls himself Dollar.” The lady muttered to herself continuously as she walked. Han Sen had agreed to help her get a silver goat, but he had taken Purple-Moon Sword’s sister blade. One was short and the other was long; they were a pair.</p>

<p>Han Sen was happy about receiving them, though. He hadn’t examined them properly yet, but they at least looked far better than the Rhino Horn Dagger.</p>

<p>The lady was called Hai’er. She said she was from the sea, but aside from that, she hadn’t elucidated much. Still, Han Sen wasn’t too interested in asking for more information.</p>

<p>Han Sen was only going to help her hunt one more xenogeneic, and after that, the two would split up. He didn’t need to know any more about her.</p>

<p>Hai’er was leading the way, but she wasn’t too familiar with where they were, and after a long time of traveling, they did not see a single xenogeneic, let alone a goat.</p>

<p>“Hang on.” Han Sen pulled Hai’er to a stop. He climbed up a small boulder nearby.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked out from the top and saw a bunch of people fighting a xenogeneic.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic was a six-armed bear, and its paws were black like obsidian. It was wreathed in black fire. It slammed the ground and split stones in two, then lit them on fire with those menacing flames. It was a scary sight.</p>

<p>Barons should not possess such powers, so it had to be a Viscount.</p>

<p>Fighting the six-armed bear were several Kate and some members of another race. There were ten Nobles in their midst, and the soldiers there had come well-prepared. One Noble released a green light from his sword. With the help of the other Nobles and soldiers, he was delivering a multitude of lacerations across the bear’s body.</p>

<p>The fight was nearing its end, and not long after, the six-armed bear was surrounded well-enough for the superior Noble to cut the beast’s head right off.</p>

<p>The hunting group had lost a few people. But killing a Viscount was worth it for the others, due to the good rewards.</p>

<p>“Come out!” The Noble, st川 holding his sword, looked towards the boulder. His stare was cold.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at Hai’er and then revealed himself. Hai’er had accidentally struck the rock,, which led to their detection.</p>

<p>“We are only passing by. We mean you no harm.” Han Sen stood atop the boulder, putting his hands out before all the Nobles.</p>

<p>That one Noble was obviously a Viscount, and his team was still moderately powerful to boot. Han Sen was only there for a xenogeneic creature. He had no need for additional drama. All he would have to do, he thought, was explain what he was doing there.</p>

<p>The Noble with a sword started to say something, but his face changed and he said to Han Sen, “I didn’t know you were working out here. We will leave now.”</p>

<p>After that, they all left quickly. The entire group ran off, with no interest in keeping the six-armed bear’s body.</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned and looked back at Hai’er. He didn’t think he had a strong enough presence to make them leave like so, so he thought that was their response to her.</p>

<p>Hai’er ran to the six-armed bear’s body and sliced the paws off. She put them all in her pocket.</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned and kept on walking. It was so strange. Every hunter that saw Hai’er seemed to run o什 like a ghost. They never even wanted the prey that they had fought tirelessly for.</p>

<p>Hunters were leaving behind xenogeneic resources left and right. Han Sen couldn’t help but feel as if they were robbing them.</p>

<p>But despite all this, Hai’er hadn’t said a word about it It must have been the easiest thieving one could ever find themselves doing.</p>

<p>“Who is this Hai’er?” Han Sen frowned, not thinking the answer would be a good thing. It felt as if he had attracted more trouble.</p>

<p>They didn’t encounter any xenogeneics, but Hai’er was still able to reap a bounty of rewards. Aside from the Viscount sixarmed bear, she got many Baron materials.</p>

<p>Ding-Dong! Ding-Dong!</p>

<p>As Han Sen eyed Hai’er with suspicion, something rang from overhead.</p>

<p>Hai’er heard it, and when she did, her face changed. She pulled Han Sen by the arm and said, “Wrong way! Not this way. We should go a different way.”</p>

<p>After that, Hai’er dragged Han Sen away from where the bell had sounded. But not long after, they heard the ringing again. Hai’er pulled Han Sen in a different direction, but again, before long, they heard the ring sound.</p>

<p>Hai’er wished to change direction again, but Han Sen had heard the ringing sound from so close. It was conning from just ahead of them. He saw a person emerge.</p>

<p>It was a man riding an elephant He had silver armor, and while his face was not especially handsome, there was a special feeling to him. He looked as if he didn’t care about anything.</p>

<p>The guy had a pair of black horns, and aside from that, he looked like a human. His skin was pale, though, and if he wasn’t wearing the armor, you’d mistake him for a scholar.</p>

<p>“Since when have pirates learned how to travel abroad?” The man riding the elephant approached the pair and smiled as he looked at them.</p>

<p>“We aren’t going around anywhere. I am looking for a silver goat. This is none of your concern.” Hai’er pouted her lips. It didn’t seem as if she liked that man very much. Han Sen could tell.</p>

<p>The man smiled and said, “Long ago, the sky pirates swore a pirate would not enter the Dan Xuan system for another one thousand years. Thus far, only seven hundred have passed. It begs the question whether or not pirates can truly be trusted.”</p>

<p>“I am just me, and I have nothing to do with piracy. Don’t speak such nonsense.” Hai’er sounded annoyed.</p>

<p>“If you aren’t a pirate, how did you receive so many good items for free?” the man asked with a humorless grin.</p>

<p>“So what if I broke the promise? Are you going to kill me? Do you have the guts to do that?”</p>

<p>Hai’er was very angry, and she no longer spoke sense.</p>

<p>The man laughed and said, “You are a pirate of a superior race. It is difficult for you to evolve. I will let you live, but I must teach you a lesson.”</p>

<p>After that, the man went quiet. He looked at Han Sen. “If you broke the laws to come here, your guard of a lesser race will pay with his blood.”</p>

<p>Han Sen did not understand anything about the vows, but he understood that last sentence. He quickly said, “I have nothing to do with her, and I’m not a pirate! If you want to punish someone, punish her.”</p>

<p>Hai’er loudly said, “Yeah, he’s the man I hired. He has nothing to do with piracy. If you want something, come right for me.”</p>

<p>The man looked like he was death himself, and he said, “Whose life ends now? Yours or his; it’s your decision.”</p>

<p>After that, the man did not seem to care if they responded. He just rode the elephant away, disappearing into the mountains with the bell ringing.</p>
