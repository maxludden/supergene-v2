	<p>Western Gran City’s elites were all drawn to that bottomless hole. Even xenogeneics were lured there. Han Sen and
		Mister Tiger were starting to feel some relief. Mister Tiger had called Han Sen, and although he did not dare
		say much, they chatted about run-of-the-mill subjects. Mister Tiger did mention that their cover story had not
		been exposed, though.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had nothing to do for the time being, and when there was no one around at night, he often found himself
		returning to the sanctuary. There he had melted down the blue crystal tentacle and cooked it</p>

	<p>The tentacle was a few hundred kilograms heavy. If Han Sen was to eat it alone, it’d take forever. So, he called
		over his family to help him eat it</p>

	<p>After Little Angel, Golden Growler, and Xie Qing King ate it, they all had weird reactions to it. Their genes
		were slowly starting to evolve.</p>

	<p>Han Yufei had a slice and almost generated geno armor. Fortunately, he was able to suppress it. Otherwise, he’d
		have been forced out of the sanctuary.</p>

	<p>“It looks like this is great for people who don’t have geno armor. It seems like I will have to get more if I
		want Little Angel to grow. In time, I’d like to bring them all to Planet Kate,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could take Han Yufei to Planet Kate to generate his geno armor, and save him from the risk of the Big
		Silence system.</p>

	<p>But when Han Sen mentioned this, Han Yufei said that he hadn’t spent enough time with Luo Lan. Because of this,
		he did not want to generate his geno armor yet. He only wanted to spend time with her, and he cared little about
		gaining power now.</p>

	<p>Han Sen ate some of the tentacle, but his xenogeneic gene tally did not increase. He’d have to eat a whole lot of
		the stuff, just to gain a small amount.</p>

	<p>So, Han Sen decided that if he did ever get massive ingredients like this again, he’d bring them back for his
		companions to eat. If they grew up and became Nobles with him, that’d be pretty great.</p>

	<p>Han Sen saved some of the tentacle for Little Silver, who was still in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. After he ate
		some of it, he almost went to the Alliance.</p>

	<p>“This is pretty good. I wonder how I can get some more?” Han Sen wondered.</p>

	<p>Han Sen made a bone soup out of the gold bone. He earned one Baron gene after drinking it.</p>

	<p>During the day, Han Sen was on Planet Kate with little to do except practice. While he was browsing the news one
		day, though, his phone rang.</p>

	<p>“Mister Tiger?” Han Sen was surprised. Mister Tiger had been very cautious since that day, so Han Sen guessed
		that something important must have happened for the man to contact him so soon. “Han Sen? Yeah, the Third Master
		would like to see you. Do you have the time to pay a visit?” Mister Tiger’s tone was complicated to discern.</p>

	<p>“Third Master? What Third Master?” Han Sen was confused.</p>

	<p>“The Black Gold Group’s Chairman’s third son. Everyone just refers to him as Third Master. He wants to extend an
		invitation for you to join Black Gold Group.” Mister Tiger then took a long pause. After, he said, “I think this
		is a good thing. Third Master must be willing to pay you a lot, as he seems to think that you are of great
		importance. I know you don’t really care about the money, but with Black Gold Group backing you, I think things
		will be easier for you.”</p>

	<p>Mister Tiger tried to convince Han Sen to join because he knew of Third Master’s temper. He wouldn’t relent until
		Han Sen joined the company.</p>

	<p>But Mister Tiger also knew that Han Sen was not someone to take lightly. He had just witnessed Han Sen slay the
		Feathers, after all. If Third Master pissed him off, who knew what sort of Armageddon he’d bring? So, Mister
		Tiger was quite nervous just asking him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could guess what Mister Tiger was really thinking. He smiled and told him, “I am happy in Wizard. I don’t
		plan to switch groups. Please tell Third Master that I am not against making new friends, though.”</p>

	<p>“Okay, I will go and tell him that.” Mister Tiger gave him a wry smile. He didn’t think that would be enough to
		please Third Master.</p>

	<p>Mister Tiger was now nervously making his way to meet with Third Master. Awkwardly, he told him what Han Sen had
		said.</p>

	<p>Third Master wasn’t made mad. He smiled slightly and said, “If he doesn’t want to join, I will not force him. It
		is good to make friends, and I will meet him on the morrow.”</p>

	<p>That was not the response that Mister Tiger had expected, and he ha If-expected that the other shoe would soon
		drop. Still, it was a good sign that Third Master did not lose his composure.</p>

	<p>Han Sen also explained the matter to Qiao. She did not need to worry about Han Sen potentially leaving her.</p>

	<p>The next day, a very luxurious vehicle parked itself in front of Qiao’s house. Han Sen got in and found a man
		sitting inside waiting for him.</p>

	<p>Third Master was a pure Kate, with black cat ears and a black cat tail. Aside from that, though, he looked like a
		human. He was dressed in a black suit, and he looked quite fancy.</p>

	<p>“Make yourself comfortable, there is no need for you to be so formal. If we’re going to be friends, you should
		treat me as one.” Third Master laughed.</p>

	<p>Mister Tiger, who was driving, was rather shocked by Third Master’s attitude. Third Master didn’t behave like
		this with any Noble.</p>

	<p>“Thank you very much.” Han Sen settled into one of the comfortable seats.</p>

	<p>Third Master poured Han Sen some wine. Han Sen had a sip and thought it tasted rather lovely.</p>

	<p>“If we are friends, then I’ll cut the crap, too. I am here hoping you can be my teacher,” Third Master said.</p>

	<p>“Black Gold Group has a great deal of elites and Barons. I only have geno armor, so surely, you must be joking,”
		Han Sen said.</p>

	<p>Third Master looked upset and said, “Han Sen, I am treating you like a friend. Please do not talk to me like
		that. I can tell the power you hold. If you can teach me, I am willing to do whatever you please.”</p>

	<p>“What would you like to learn?” Han Sen asked quietly.</p>

	<p>“Everything. I want to learn everything from you.” Third Master was looking directly into Han Sen’s eyes.</p>

	<p>“I need to work with Wizard, though. I do not have much free time,” Han Sen said.</p>

	<p>“That’s fine. Just tell me when you have time, and I will work around your schedule. It would be best if you
		could join us, though. If you did that, you wouldn’t have to do anything, and you’d be showered with money,”
		Third Master said.</p>

	<p>“I have no intention of leaving Wizard, but I do have some time. I will set things up later.” Han Sen looked out
		the window, frowned, and asked, “Where are we going?”</p>

	<p>“The bottomless hole in the western side of the city.” Third Master laughed.</p>

	<p>“The Feathers said I cannot leave the city.” Han Sen shrugged his shoulders.</p>

	<p>“This still counts as part of the city. You aren’t leaving, and even if you did leave, Xina couldn’t do anything
		with me here.” Third Master looked confident in that.</p>
