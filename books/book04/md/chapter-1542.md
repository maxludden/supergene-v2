Han Sen, seeing Goddess had not died, thought that it was a great shame. Little Lion King felt relief, though. If she had really been killed, and he was involved with the incident, it might have started a war between Lion Mountain and Sacred.

Although Lion Mountain was not afraid of Sacred, it’d be a clash between two super shelters. The loss of lives would not be worth it.

Han Sen noticed the Split-Knife had not disappeared alongside Goddess, however. So, he picked it up.

> “Super Geno Core Split-Knife Obtained.”

Han Sen was delighted. He took the knife. If it could carve a mark into the Overbearing Shield, it had to be a very powerful weapon. It was great for Han Sen to obtain a super geno core out of the endeavor.

Taia was simply tough, and its effectiveness and power depended entirely on Han Sen. Split-Knife was incredibly strong all by itself, so for Han Sen, this would definitely increase his damage output and be particularly helpful when tackling super creatures.

When Goddess disappeared, the creatures of Sacred Shelter all ran off. Little Jade Lion did not ask his troops to pursue, as he did not want to make them particularly resentful.

Han Sen saw that Queen hadn’t run off, so he walked before her and asked, “You aren’t under contract, are you?”

Queen shook her head. “If I was, even I wouldn’t stay.”

“Good. When we leave God’s Ruin, I’ll take you back to the Alliance,” Han Sen said, then went back to the Little Lion. “Tell your guards to protect the entrance of the Godlight Tunnel. Without my explicit permission, no one is allowed inside.”

Little Jade Lion swiftly agreed, then ordered his company to guard the entire valley.

Little Jade Lion was a little scared of Han Sen now. He had originally thought that Han Sen wanted to use his power to take control of the tunnel, but it wasn’t like that.

Han Sen had killed Goddess with a single hit, and Little Lion King was worried about upsetting him. He thought if Han Sen was displeased, Little Lion King might get cut in half too.

Even with a super geno core like Lionheart Stamp, he wouldn’t feel safe.

Before Han Sen, even Little Lion’s title didn’t bring him a sense of security.

Yu Miao had wanted to make a sneak attack earlier, but seeing Goddess almost die that way and have to use God Ring’s power to escape, she didn’t dare try anything.

“Little Lion King, according to our deal, we can enter the tunnel now, yes?” Yu Miao said, walking into the valley to speak with Little Lion.

Little Lion King gave a wry smile. “If I took the tunnel, of course. But that isn’t my call to make anymore.”

After that, Little Lion King turned to look at Han Sen.

“You can go into the Godlight Tunnel, but the price of admission is two gemstone geno cores. Each,” Han Sen said coldly.

Although Han Sen wished to kill them both, they were spirits. It was ultimately pointless. Han Sen just wanted them to act more careful with him. If Han Sen wished to kill them, they knew he could do it in one hit. If he wanted to kill them and keep them from respawning, though, Han Sen would have to destroy their spirit stones.

“Don’t be ridiculous.” Yu Xuan spoke with an annoyed tone. The people who took the tunnel last only asked for one.

“Is it? Then you can pay me three,” Han Sen said quietly.

“You…” Yu Xuan sounded angry.

“Four.” Han Sen’s face was emotionless throughout. He spoke even before the spirit could respond.

“Two then,” Yu Miao frowned. She was not sure if she could kill Han Sen in God’s Ruin, so she was regretfully going to have to oblige him.

“Now it is four each. None less.” Han Sen pointed at Tang Zhenliu then, and said, “But you can swap them out for other things, if you’d like. That being said, I’ll give you 50% off if you’re willing to release this man.”

“I can give him to you, and the contract, but that means entry is free.” Yu Miao looked at Tang Zhenliu as he spoke to Han Sen.

To her, Tang Zhenliu was just a bronze geno core grunt. If she could get a benefit such as that out of it, acknowledging he was important to Han Sen, she was going to bargain for the best deal possible.

Yu Miao thought of using Tang Zhenliu to threaten Han Sen, but she didn’t do it.

She didn’t know just how important weak humans like Tang Zhenliu were to Han Sen, so she was worried about being tricked, too.

If she wasn’t successful in bargaining, she’d have to spend a lot of resources in gaining access to the tunnel, and Han Sen could go mad and kill them like Goddess, anyway. Although they could respawn with their spirit stones, it’d put an end to their relic hunt in God’s Ruin.

“Half. He doesn’t deserve more,” Han Sen said coldly.

It was quiet for a bit, and Han Sen wasn’t going to back off. Yu Miao agreed to the deal in the end, using Tang Zhenliu as the bargaining chip for having 50% off. Four gemstone class geno cores was too expensive, especially if they had to pay so many for each person. Not even Yu Miao had that many.

But they still had to pay two gemstone geno cores, and that was the double the price they were going to pay before Han Sen showed up.

Yu Miao and Yu Xuan thought Han Sen would charge the others that price, too, but when the solo creatures or spirits came to ask for entry, they were allowed in for the price of one gemstone geno core. This really peeved them.

Yu Xuan wished to say something and complain, but Yu Miao stopped him and just pulled him into the tunnel.

“Don’t say anything. In God’s Ruin, we can’t fight him. Once we return to the outside, though, there’ll be plenty of ways for us to exact our revenge.” Yu Miao said darkly, as she entered the Godlight Tunnel.

“I’m going to chop him into pieces.” Yu Xuan’s eyes flared with the want of murder.

Tang Zhenliu, having gotten his freedom back, cried his eyes out. “Old Han, whenever you need me—whatever you want—please, just tell me.”

“I will have a lot to ask you, actually. When Littleflower goes to your school, you should give us a discount.” Han Sen laughed.

“No discount. We’ll have him for free and we’ll give him the best treatment,” Tang Zhenliu patted his chest.

“Thanks, but we’ll talk more about that in the Alliance. Since we’re here now, though, we should head into the tunnel and try our luck. Maybe we can level up our geno cores.” Han Sen brought Queen and Tang Zhenliu with him into the Godlight Tunnel.

Godlight Tunnel was a tunnel that went through the belly of a mountain. It was around ten miles long, and a weird power permeated the atmosphere inside. The humans felt a lot of pressure as they entered, and the deeper they went, the harder the pressure became.

If a person was talented, with a good fitness level, they might learn something when they went against that strength. Their skills might be improved and perhaps level them up straight away.
