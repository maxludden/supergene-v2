<p>Chu Nan locked the door to Han Sen and the blood kirin’s jail
cell, and he was just about to leave when someone else walked up.
It was Prince Swordstar.</p>
<p>“My Prince.” Chu Nan and his servant bowed courteously.</p>
<p>“Good work, Mister Chu,” Prince Swordstar said. He walked in
front of the prison’s erected Bai Sema. He looked at Han Sen
through the Bai Sema and grinned. “Brother Sixteen, how are you
feeling?”</p>
<p>“This place is quite comfy. I get free food, free rent, and I
like the mellow vibes. I’m not sure I ever want to leave,” Han Sen
replied, while lying on the bed.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar laughed menacingly. “Bai Yi, you really think
that no one will touch you because you’re a prince? Do you really
think you can wash away the crime upon the blood kirin?”</p>
<p>“What if I do?” Han Sen continued to lie casually on his back.
The bed was a little hard, but for someone who was used to roughing
it, it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar wasn’t a fan of Han Sen’s attitude. He mocked
him by saying, “Brother Sixteen, you are so naive and cute. The
Sentence Court is not someplace where you can do whatever you want.
You are just a prince. During our long history, even a few crown
princes have been locked up in prison.”</p>
<p>“I know. There are laws, and this is how things should be.” Han
Sen maintained his position on the bed, acting as if he didn’t
care.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar was there to rile Han Sen up with a display of
his victory, but seeing Han Sen behave like this, he no longer felt
like a winner. He actually felt annoyed.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t want to stay in prison. Luckily, he had
discovered through Fox Queen that Miss Mirror was in the middle of
investigating him. He knew he wouldn’t be in jail for long, because
Miss Mirror would be unable to investigate him if he was actually
given a ten-year sentence.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar didn’t know that Miss Mirror was investigating
Han Sen. As he looked at Han Sen, he noticed the blood kirin. He
frowned and asked Chu Nan, “Mister Chu, my Brother Sixteen is a
noble. Can’t he have a cell all to himself?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I am happy like this,” Han Sen said carefully before
Chu Nan returned.</p>
<p>After all, he had personally asked Chu Nan to let the blood
kirin stay with him. He had to say something.</p>
<p>Chu Nan said, “He is only in lock-up for now. Keeping them both
here will make things easier until the trial.”</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar lifted his lips in a snarl and quietly told Han
Sen, “Bai Yi, are you naive enough to think that nothing will
happen if you take the fall? I am telling you right now, you will
really go to jail. And the blood kirin will die. You cannot do
anything about it. This is the consequence of challenging me.”</p>
<p>“Wow, you are so powerful. I admire you.” Han Sen was still
lying on the bed, and he clapped his hands in the most uncaring way
possible.</p>
<p>“You…” Prince Swordstar was so angry. He shouted at the worker
and said, “Get the blood kirin out! Separate the two and treat them
well.”</p>
<p>Chu Nan looked hesitant, but he still allowed the servant to
proceed and open the gate.</p>
<p>He hesitated because Prince Swordstar didn’t have any authority
in the Sentence Court, but the captain was Prince Swordstar’s
uncle. Things could go badly for him if he didn’t listen to the
prince.</p>
<p>“Since when did the Sentence Court become a prince’s manor?” The
voice of a powerful woman bellowed from the outside.</p>
<p>When Prince Swordstar and Chu Nan heard it, their faces paled.
They turned around and saw Miss Mirror approaching them, clad in
royal garb.</p>
<p>Chu Nan was incredibly frustrated. The Sentence Court for the
Extreme King was supposed to be a hellhole. When ordinary nobles
heard about it, they would do their best to avoid it. Today, it was
more like a bar where anyone could come and go as they pleased.</p>
<p>But Chu Nan wouldn’t dare to provoke the woman before him. He
bowed and said, “Greetings, Miss Mirror.”</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar quickly bowed as well. There were many people
in the Extreme King that they couldn’t provoke, and Miss Mirror was
in the top three. Prince Swordstar would rather upset King Bai than
this one.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar was King Bai’s son. Even if King Bai was angry,
he wouldn’t do anything to him. It was difficult to tell how things
would turn out with Miss Mirror, though. She was famous for having
grand mood swings and being very cruel. Many powerful people with
great ambitions in the Extreme King had been destroyed under the
thumb of Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>“Mister Chu, why is Prince Sixteen here?” Miss Mirror looked at
the jail cell that held Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Auntie Princess, in the King’s Garden, Brother Sixteen allowed
his guard…” Prince Swordstar came up to her to explain.</p>
<p>“Swordstar, what is your position in the Sentence Court?” Miss
Mirror turned hard eyes on Prince Swordstar.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar was struck with a chill, and he suddenly found
himself unable to speak.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror, there is an investigation that requires Prince
Sixteen’s cooperation.” Chu Nan had heard Miss Mirror’s tone, and
he knew right away that this was bad. He refrained from telling her
the truth.</p>
<p>“There is something I need from Bai Yi, too. I will be taking
him back with me for now,” Miss Mirror said. Someone had already
walked in and brought Han Sen and the blood kirin out of their
cell.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror, this…” Chu Nan felt as if he had two paths to
choose from. He could either let it go or not let it go.</p>
<p>“Auntie Princess, killing in the King’s Garden is an important
crime,” Prince Swordstar said in a rush. He ran in front of Miss
Mirror in his plight.</p>
<p>As this occurred, Chu Nan’s phone rang. He looked at the number
and accepted the call. He turned off his phone and spoke to Miss
Mirror, “Miss Mirror has already discussed this with the captain.
Why did you not tell me this? What are you guys doing here? Move!
Do not stop Miss Mirror from attending to her business.”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t even look at Prince Swordstar. She walked
right past him.</p>
<p>“Little Brother, I don’t have time to watch you play. If you
want to put on a show in the future, please call me first. I will
make sure I allocate the time.” Han Sen walked in front of Prince
Swordstar, speaking to him while he fixed his sleeves. Then, he
brought the blood kirin with him as he walked away.</p>
<p>“That a**hole!” Prince Swordstar was so mad, it looked like he
was going to breathe fire. His face was in a wretched
contortion.</p>
<p>“What? You aren’t going to thank me for saving you?” Miss Mirror
said to Han Sen as they entered the car she had brought.</p>
<p>“Auntie Princess, I think you have work reasons for freeing me.
I will still have to go back later. I don’t know if I should be
thanking you yet,” Han Sen answered, looking directly at Miss
Mirror as he spoke.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s face was impassive, and her gaze was frosty as she
looked at Han Sen. “Han Sen, how dare you? You killed a prince, and
you dare to disguise yourself as him! You really don’t understand
the danger you are in.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard what she said, his heart jumped. He acted
cool and said, “Auntie Princess, what do you mean? I do not
understand.”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t move. She pointed at the ring on Han Sen’s
finger. “Han Sen, where did you get this ring from?”</p>
<p>“This is Han Sen’s item. I got it when I took his body,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror laughed darkly. “Are you aware that this ring is
called Mirror Spirit Eye? It can reflect a person’s soul. If you
are Bai Yi, take a look at yourself in the Mirror Spirit Eye. It
will see whether your soul is Han Sen’s or Bai Yi’s.”</p>
