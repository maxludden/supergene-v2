<p>Han Sen kept fighting and consuming the spring water he could get. His mind was thinking about the little bug on his forehead, so he wasn’t paying attention to anything else.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought what he had taken was just a larger water drop. It sure tasted like ordinary spring water, but after swallowing it, he acknowledged that something might have been wrong. It was as if he swallowed a vat of lava, and his entire body flared up with pain. He was burning on the inside with a sensation that was worse than any cut.</p>

<p>But Han Sen kept on casting his Yin Yang Change, trying to convert the horrible substance. His other hand was reaching for his forehead, to try to remove the red bug.</p>

<p>The bug looked like blood. It was only the size of a needle head, and when it touched Han Sen’s forehead, it tried to drill through the helmet. Quickly, a hole had been punctured through the Spell armor. The fiend was going to go right through.</p>

<p>Han Sen used his other hand to cover the hole, but the bug was already inside the armor. He couldn’t get a hold of it.</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned. Before he could think about how to deal with the bug, Sword Know and the Tego Earl were coming for him once again.</p>

<p>They were just like Han Sen right now, in that they did not know about the red mist soul. They didn’t know that after the red mist soul, there would not be any more spring water.</p>

<p>The red mist soul was extremely rare. It was an angry spirit that the spring itself had generated.</p>

<p>The red mist spring worked on Viscounts. It was not effective when you reached Earl, but the red mist soul was. It could trigger an evolution for an Earl. The chances weren’t very high, but the mere prospect of it being a possibility was quite scary.</p>

<p>If normal Viscounts used a red mist soul, they could easily become an Earl. It was a guarantee.</p>

<p>The Kings watched Han Sen swallow the red mist soul, and they thought it to be an even grander waste. None felt this more than Night River King. He wished he had allowed Sword Know to use the Blood-Brain Bug sooner.</p>

<p>Blood-Brain Bugs were a harmful xenogeneic. As a parasite, they could latch themselves onto the brains of others. One of them would look like a normal bug, but when activated, it could ravage the brain of its victim. Its behavior could be controlled remotely, too.</p>

<p>Seeing the Blood-Brain Bug pierce the helmet, Han Sen’s body shone. The Spell armor was glowing white.</p>

<p>The red mist soul in Han Sen’s body, and the spring water, were converted into energy inside his armor. Spell’s energy was finally released. It was going to reach Viscount class.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The Spell armor was bathed in light, and in its radiance, the Blood-Brain Bug melted. Nothing of it remained.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s Ghost Teeth Knife glowed white as it was imbued with Spell’s light. It was a knifelight.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s knifemind was also increasing. It was scary before, but now it was becoming something even greater. It was way past the level of a Duke.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>The person and the knife combined into one. The knifelight was like the light of dawn. It banished the dark and signaled the coming of a new day. And now, it was going after the Tego Earl.</p>

<p>The Tego Earl was shocked. That knifelight was scarier than any monster. It took over his entire world. The Tego Earl swung his fist like a tiger, but he himself wished to retreat.</p>

<p>The knifelight acted as if it had a life of its own. It smashed into his back and sent fractures all the way through his chest. He started to bleed profusely.</p>

<p>When the blood spilled out, the purple mist began to spread across the wounds. The Tego Earl looked scared, and his wounds expanded quickly. His chest was torn wide open, and then, his organs fell out.</p>

<p>“Aargh!” The Tego Earl screamed. He had been ripped apart by the Teeth power.</p>

<p>Rebecca and the others stopped attacking. The looked at Han Sen, holding Ghost Teeth Knife like a demon.</p>

<p>He didn’t look like he was going to stop. And he turned his murderous attention onto Sword Know.</p>

<p>In that fight, all that the other Earls had wanted was a bit of that spring water. It was only the Tego Earl and Sword Know that wanted to kill Han Sen. But he didn’t look willing to stop.</p>

<p>The knife he wielded was like a demon striker. The knifelight was like a maw of toxic teeth, wanting to crush Sword Know.</p>

<p>Sword Know knew he was injured, and far worse than the Tego Earl had been just before Han Sen killed him. He couldn’t take Han Sen’s strike, and he looked so scared. He flailed his sword to spawn another meteoric slash that could hopefully break Han Sen’s swordlight.</p>

<p>“Enough! The fight for the red mist spring has ended.” Night River King’s scary power and aura landed. It covered the entirety of the Red Mist Valley. He spoke in a cold voice.</p>

<p>Han Sen acted as if he had not heard him. He didn’t care about the King’s presence, and he still continued swinging his knife. The knifelight cut through from the top of Sword Know’s head, down through his body until he flopped in two.</p>

<p>Everyone was in shock. They never expected Han Sen could be so cruel. Even with Night River King there, he had mercilessly slain Sword Know.</p>

<p>Night River King was furious, and he said, “I told you to stop! And you are still killing?”</p>

<p>Night River King swung his palm, and his scary power came towards Han Sen to crush him. The mere presence that the hand possessed was terrifying. As rocks were broken, it felt like the end of the world.</p>

<p>Han Sen was holding his Ghost Teeth Knife. He stared at that hand that towered towards the sky like a mountain. He wasn’t scared, though.</p>

<p>His knifemind roared like a beast, but the King’s power did not relent.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Before the hand could land, a purple gust of knife wind came from Planet Blade. It traveled through space like a beam that crossed the universe. It broke through Planet Eclipse’s atmosphere and cut through the hand.</p>

<p>“Aargh!” A scream sounded, and the big hand was sliced into dust by that fearsome knifelight. Night River King’s body disappeared, right from where he was on Planet Eclipse.</p>

<p>“Please don’t be mad, Knife. Night River King was just angry, and he did not mean to hurt Han Sen,” Moon Wheel King said, looking up towards Planet Blade.</p>

<p>“I will decide the fate of my student. Others should learn not to interfere.” Queen’s voice sounded empty, but it was all over Narrow Moon.</p>

<p>Moon Wheel King shook his head and then vanished from Planet Eclipse.</p>

<p>The other Kings left, too. There was no point in them staying any longer. If they tried anything, they’d be humiliated like Night River King had.</p>

<p>Now Han Sen had his Teeth Knife knifemind, Yisha could protect him properly. They weren’t Moon Wheel King, and they were not deified. They wouldn’t want to incite Yisha’s fury.</p>
