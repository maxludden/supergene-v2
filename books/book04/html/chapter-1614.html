    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng’s sword and Sha Linjia’s fist collided. Neither of them
      reeled back, and they came at each other repeatedly, strike after strike,
      neither of them appearing to have the upper hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are able to do battle with my Godblood! You should be proud.” Sha
      Linjia’s body was flashing red like an erupting volcano. He got in a blast
      that was immeasurably powerful, and it sent Gu Qingcheng stumbling
      backwards.
    </p>
    <p>“That is so strong. What is up with that shura?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
    <p>
      The other shura and super creatures were going towards Little Silver as
      this occurred, all looking very angry,
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shura also used Shura Change, but theirs was the normal one.
      Their bodies simply became stronger as they were supposed to, and none of
      their bodies blazed with fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, thirteen fourth ranked shura fighters and fourteen super
      creatures was a terrifying amount of power for any host to be subjected
      to. Little Silver and the others would not be enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Uncle Qing Ya, why is Han Sen not here?” Tina rode a big bird, something
      similar to a peacock. She came over to Qing Ya’s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He should be in the Alliance. He is not here just yet,” Qing Ya said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina was disappointed by this, and she said, “That means I came for
      nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not really. You can enjoy the spectacle of an amazing fight.” Qing Ya
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tina looked over with disdain and said, “What good is there in watching?
      Father rewarded Sha Linjia with Godblood. Of course he’s stronger than
      that human woman.”
    </p>
    <p>“Sometimes that is hard to tell,” Qing Ya said quietly.</p>
    <p>
      Seeing Gu Qingcheng do combat with Sha Linjia, the shura and super
      creatures went for the creatures in the shelter. But then, they saw Red
      Pony emerge. It was tiny when compared to the shura and creatures that
      were stampeding forward. Strangely, it also looked fearless, and its head
      was lifted, as if in massive pride. The shura ahead came at the Red Pony,
      throwing punches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Pony then roared with its head lifted, and its voice came out like a
      shockwave. It pushed back the super creatures and shura that had neared
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shockwave was so strong, it was even visible. It covered the entirety
      of Shadow Shelter. When the shura and super creatures were able to stand
      up again, they tried breaking the disc of the shockwave. They were unable
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their powers were breaking like fireworks outside the shelter, as Red Pony
      watched them with an unmoving expression. It had most certainly halted
      their attempted penetration of the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Han Sen was really able to confirm Red Pony was the scariest creature
      there. It was the one to watch out for in that big battle. Red Pony
      couldn’t have been much weaker than the elder, so Han Sen wasn’t sure why
      he hadn’t been willing to stay with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought only Han Sen and the woman were strong. Why is there something
      else so strong residing in the shelter?” Tina looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qing Ya was surprised, too. “The reputation Han Sen has now does not stem
      from simple luck. It is not surprising he has such mighty elites in his
      employ. Sha Linjia should most certainly ensure he is prepared.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sha Linjia was currently engaged in the fight against Gu Qingcheng,
      though, and an obvious victor had yet to be determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng knew that with Red Pony there, the shura and super creatures
      would not be able to make it inside the shelter. So, she wasn’t too
      worried about Elysian Moon’s safety. She waved her bronze sword with
      overbearing sword skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sha Linjia’s red flames were no worse than what Gu Qingcheng wielded. The
      way he fought was entirely shura, though. His entire body was a weapon,
      and he could attack with any part of his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen as he watched them fight They really made him open his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially Sha Linjia’s skills, which were different than a human’s. There
      was no focus on feeling; it was all about the raw power dealt through
      combat. He was a killing machine.
    </p>
    <p>Sha Linjia saw his men stop. He looked at them strangely and shouted.</p>
    <p>
      When the shura heard his shout, they all stopped trying to fight back
      against the shockwave. Instead, they each brought out a vial of red
      liquid. They opened it and fed it to the super creatures they had
      previously ridden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The super creatures seemed to have really wanted the red liquid, too. They
      all scrambled over each other, fighting to get theirs first And when they
      did consume the drink, their lifeforces suddenly became much stronger.
      Their powers were given a red hue, and it looked as if they had been made
      berserk.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No way! Fourteen super creatures have become berserk? What kind of red
      liquid is that?” Han Sen was frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference in power between super creatures and berserk super
      creatures was not a whole tier of strength, like sacred to super. It was
      half at best. But it was also more difficult to achieve than going from
      gemstone to super.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fourth God’s Sanctuary’s super creatures were much stronger than the
      super creatures populating the three prior sanctuaries. Even so, berserk
      super creatures were always quite rare and difficult to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, fourteen super creatures had become berserk super creatures by
      drinking a vial of liquid. It was quite difficult to fathom the
      implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not believe it, but he couldn’t deny the fact it was happening
      right before his eyes. After the super creatures drank the liquid, their
      bodies and geno cores became stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mountain-looking geno core landed on the shockwave ring and shook. Other
      geno cores joined in, some like swords that came against the force to try
      and cut through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those geno cores came against the aura with equal power. It started to
      shake and tremble, and it eventually cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Pony’s face finally changed. He roared and increased the power he had
      put into that force. Even so, with the fourteen creatures attacking, the
      aura still felt as if it was going to break any second.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are strong, but I will win! That is because I have Godblood and you
      are just a meager human.” Sha Linjia stepped back, gathering a red fire on
      his fist. It looked like a swirling vortex, and it gradually burned
      brighter and brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Godblood? In my time, Gods were never that strong. For Qi Gong Masters,
      our task is to kill them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng lowered her bronze sword. Her lifeforce became like water, as
      it began to gather and twirl around her sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of her sword was Pure. It was a superior blade, one of the ten
      most famous weapons from ancient history. Gu Qingcheng carried it whenever
      she practiced Qi Gong. When she became a demigod, she did not create a
      self geno core, and instead just used that sword as one. With it, she
      practiced her sword skill talents.
