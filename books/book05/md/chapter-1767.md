Inside a pool of still water, Han Sen lay motionless beneath its surface. He watched everything that was happening around him.

Since running into the forest, he had run non-stop for the past four days. He could not keep track of how many Nobles he had killed, but they just kept on coming. He hadn’t had a moment’s rest. There were at least five Viscount Nobles giving chase, as well. After endless fighting, the Dongxuan Armor had incurred many marks.

But that was nothing to Han Sen. If other Nobles were in his position, Viscounts included, they’d have been exhausted and dead a long time ago.

Han Sen was still energized. The Dongxuan Armor absorbed energy from the very earth to fuel his power. He could keep fighting without a need for stopping.

Han Sen wanted to use the Archangel Bone Arrow to kill his pursuers, but he would need to activate his super god spirit body to make use of it The energy cost of taking on that form, however, far outweighed what the armor could put out.

His real enemy was not a Viscount. If he could not kill the Zhenyue, he would keep on being chased like this.

Han Sen hadn’t bothered returning to the sanctuary, though, because running away was not his style. A good offense was the best defense, and what he really needed to do was find the Zhenyue.

Han Sen was taking a ten-minute break, hiding in the pool. He eventually heard footsteps approach.

“Shit! Where did that *sshole go! How the hell does a Baron have this much power, endurance, and skill?” growled a rough voice from close-by.

It was the Viscount with a sword. Han Sen had learned that his name was Hawei.

Hawei was answered by another, calmer voice. “He might be a Baron, but he is related to the pirates. He is not like ordinary Barons, so that is something I can understand.”

“Mister Elephant is getting impatient If we don’t kill him, we’ll end up being slaughtered for failing,” Hawei said quietly.

“Maybe not Mister Elephant went to Old Dragon Rock Mountain to kill that xenogeneic. He won’t be back for a bit. We still have plenty of time.” The calm voice was speaking again.

Han Sen heard it. He had been running through the xenogeneic space for a while now, and he had gained some familiarity with the area.

He had also captured a few Barons and interrogated them for information, and so he knew about Old Dragon Rock Mountain. He had never dared venture there, though.

One Baron said that Old Dragon Rock Mountain had a xenogeneic on it that was of Earl class, and that was something Han Sen wasn’t exactly keen on provoking.

“Mister Elephant wants to kill an Earl xenogeneic? He has a big appetite.” Han Sen was coldly laughing to himself.

The higher races said they were the highest in their bracket, but they were not invincible. Han Sen had guessed Mister Elephant was a Viscount, and he was indeed very brave to hunt an Earl xenogeneic.

“Where did he go?” Hawei resumed his search, angrily.

Another Viscount wished to answer, but he suddenly widened his eyes as he looked into the pool to the left of Hawei. Hawei knew something had to be wrong, so he pulled his sword out and slashed blindly toward the water.

Hawei saw Han Sen leap out of the pool and come for him.

“Go to hell!” Hawei used more strength than ever, but he knew that something was wrong. His angry expression turned worried.

Katcha!

The sword cut Han Sen’s body in half, but Hawei immediately knew that something wasn’t right. It was just an illusion.

Han Sen’s body was still in a half-crouch, looking like a beast ready to pounce. He jumped at Hawei and grabbed his waist, planted his feet firmly on the ground, and pulled the Viscount into the water.

Another Viscount came near to the pool and looked into the water. It was too dirty, and he could not see who was down there. He couldn’t risk a strike.

He held a bow and aimed at the water instead, unsure of where to fire.

“Hawei, come out so that I can shoot!” Nicai shouted at the water.

Pang!

A wave formed as someone rose out of the water. Nicai aimed the bow at the form, then noticed it was Hawei.

Almost at the same time, someone else emerged in silence. This person had two purple swords, both of which were different sizes. They were coming right for Nicai.

Those two swords were fully serrated, and after all the fighting thus far, they looked like fangs.

Nicai reacted quickly. He lowered the bow and prepared to fire.

With so little distance between him and his target, Nicai was confident Han Sen would not be able to dodge.

Han Sen didn’t try to dodge, either. He just smiled at the man and revealed his white teeth. With the swords, he slashed toward the arrow that was fired.

“Naive.” Nicai laughed in dark amusement

His Viscount weapon was a bow, formed by a Viscount xenogeneic Black Scale Beast. It was powerful, and a Baron should not have been able to block it

Han Sen’s swing landed on the arrow, though. The Purple-Moon Swords had endured much over the last four days, though, and they shattered into bits of broken glass.

The arrow was still coming, too; it struck Han Sen in the chest. The arrow pushed Han Sen back down into the water. A bevy of blood filtered upwards, followed by bubbles.

“Nicai, good job!” Hawei was happy.

But before he could finish, the water exploded. A body flew towards them like a weird bird.

“Death wish.” Hawei slashed towards it. The waves and the green light were going to cut Han Sen in half.

Han Sen was in the air with a Gold Feather Bow. And he had somehow taken Nicai’s arrow to use as his own.

Boing!

The string made a noise as the arrow flew directly toward Hawei.

Hawei was immediately frightened. He gave up on Han Sen and tried striking the arrow.

Over the last few days, he had fought with Han Sen a lot. And he knew Han Sen was stronger than an average Baron. Now that he had Nicai’s arrow, Hawei could definitely be damaged.

But the arrow looked as if it had been imbued with magic. It disappeared from sight, and then, Hawei felt a sharp pain in his chest.

Hawei looked down. Somehow, the arrow had plunged into his chest The item twisted like a monster’s fang, digging through the armor and flesh, all the way until it reached the heart.
