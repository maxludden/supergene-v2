<p>Lou Jiu was in shock. Han Sen, who was gripping him by the neck,
had lifted his entire body. He saw that Han Sen’s body was filled
with purple air. A pair of weird eyes flickered demonically with a
purple color. They stared at him, which made him feel shocked and
angry.</p>
<p>He wanted to summon a gene race to combine with, but Lou Jiu was
shocked to discover that his God Spirit Blood – Pulse’s connection
kept disconnecting. He was unable to summon a gene race.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at Lou Jiu and coldly asked, “How do you want to
die?”</p>
<p>Lou Jiu suddenly felt his heart sink. He was going to be killed.
As the power in Han Sen’s hands increased, becoming stronger and
stronger, Lou Jiu felt as if his windpipe was ready to snap. He
could not breathe. Obviously, his opponent was not going to ask him
anything.</p>
<p>He was unable to use a gene race, so Lou Jiu had no hope of
fighting back. He was in shock. He tugged at Han Sen’s hands. While
he had a chance to speak, he squeezed out a few words from his
tightened throat. “I just accepted the money to do this… Don’t you
want to know who wanted to do this to you?”</p>
<p>“I will go after Gong Shu Jin.” Han Sen confidently spoke, but
he was just testing Lou Jiu. The only person he had slighted was
Gong Shu Jin. Now, someone wanted to kill him. His assumption that
it was Gong Shu Jin was an educated guess. Seeing Lou Jiu’s
expression change, Han Sen knew he was right. “This is Jade Wall
City. If you kill me, you cannot escape,” Lou Jiu struggled to
wheeze. His face was red.</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen looked at Lou Jiu coldly. More power was
circulating in his hands. Lou Jiu could not say anything anymore.
His face looked like a pig’s belly.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not break the man’s neck outright. He opened his
mouth and breathed out a black mist. Lou Jiu saw the black mist.
His shocked eyes looked as if they could not believe what they were
seeing. Han Sen was not emitting black smoke. It was organ-eating
bugs.</p>
<p>Lou Jiu no longer felt the organ-eating bugs that belonged to
him. All those organ-eating bugs were releasing a purple mist, and
they went straight into his mouth.</p>
<p>Lou Jiu kept trying to struggle. In Han Sen’s grasp, he could
not open his mouth. In shock, he could not help but watch the
organ-eating bugs climb into his mouth and enter his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen waited for all the organ-eating bugs to enter his body
before releasing his hold on his neck. He looked at Lou Jiu like a
dead dog on the floor and said, “These are your organ-eating bugs.
I hope you enjoy them.”</p>
<p>Lou Jiu could not stand up. He wanted to connect with the
organ-eating bugs, but he was not able to. The organ-eating bugs
were out of his control.</p>
<p>S WE</p>
<p>“Argh!” Lou Jiu felt as if his organs were being pinched by a
thousand needles. He held his belly and screamed. He coughed up
blood. His face looked pasty and white.</p>
<p>He got up off the ground. Lou Jiu held his belly and started
running away. He wanted to live. He did not want to die. He thought
about his organs being eaten by those organ-eating bugs and how
that was such a painful way to die. After thinking about it, Lou
Jiu only wanted to run away.</p>
<p>He was suffering from the organ-eating bugs as he ran back to
Gong Shu Manor. Blood kept spilling out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Han Sen coldly watched Lou Jiu leave. He did not stop him.</p>
<p>Previously, he had thought Lou Jiu might have been lying. In a
moment of life and death, no matter how strong that person’s will
was, there was always a flaw to discern. Plus, Lou Jiu was not
someone with a strong will.</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, humans did not really count on
their bodies. They depended on power. Most humans did not have a
strong will.</p>
<p>Lou Jiu was half-falling as he ran back into Gong Shu Manor.
When the guard saw Lou Jiu’s face, he was shocked. He held Lou Jiu
and asked, “Mister Lou, what happened to you?”</p>
<p>“Take… Take me to Mister Jin…” Every time Lou Jiu opened his
mouth, black blood dribbled out. There was also some meat.</p>
<p>The guard held him and took him into Gong Shu Manor. Not far
away from the Gong Shu Manor, Han Sen watched from an alley. He
coldly smiled.</p>
<p>“Mister! Mister Lou came back.”</p>
<p>Gong Shu Jin was watching people dance in the garden when he
heard a guard calling out for him. Before he spoke, Lou Jiu came
stumbling into the garden.</p>
<p>Gong Shu Jin smiled. He was not happy. Lou Jiu’s behavior was
very rude. When he saw Lou Jiu’s face, his expression changed. He
saw Lou Jiu was entering the garden shaking and with a mouth full
of black blood and a wet chest. His face was pale, and his eye
sockets were black. He looked like a zombie.</p>
<p>“Mis… Mister… Save… Save… Blergh!” Lou Jiu ran to Gong Shu Jin
for help. When he was nine feet away, his mouth filled with black
blood and decomposing organs. They spilled out like blood rain that
went everywhere.</p>
<p>Lou Jiu’s body leaned forward. His eyes were popping out of
their sockets. His hands reached in Gong Shu Jin’s direction as if
he was asking for his help, but he had no more lifeforce.</p>
<p>Gong Shu Jin was shocked and angry. He watched Lou Jiu die with
his eyes open, staining the garden with his blood. His face looked
like it had a pair of 10,000-year-old eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to the hotel. He saw Jian Bu Gu and Mister
Yang waiting for him in the living room. He walked in and asked,
“Is there any way for us to prevent harm from a gene race.”</p>
<p>He was not afraid of organ-eating bugs, but he knew the people
next to him would be harmed. Fortunately, Jian Bu Gu was there this
time. What if he was not around the next time?</p>
<p>This time, organ-eating bugs had been used. Next time, it was
likely to be something scarier. There was a chance it would be
something his body could not block.</p>
<p>Mister Yang was silent a moment before saying, “There is. There
is a gene race called listen. It can identify gene races. If you
get close to a gene race, a listen can find out about it. But these
listens are just a legend. No one has seen any before. There are
gene races with similar power. If their levels are too low, they
can only sense other low-level gene races. They cannot sense all
the gene races. It would be very rare.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Jian Bu Gu, who nodded and said, “That gene
race is very rare. If the level is too low, it would not do much.
Ordinary gene casters use lamp grass bugs. It’s the same type of
gene race, and the level of a lamp grass bug is a viscount. They
can only detect earls at the most, and it is very weak when it
comes to water element gene races. Even with a lamp grass bug near,
you cannot sense a marquise organ-eating bug.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Jian Bu Gu went on to say, “There is a gene race
that can sense a lot of things. Although it is just king class, if
a god class gene race entered the area, it would be able to detect
its presence. It’s just that this gene race’s gene eggs are very
rare. From what I know, Lu Shi’s shop has a few, but they are wild
adults. They can put them in the house, but they cannot be brought
around. That does not do much.”</p>
