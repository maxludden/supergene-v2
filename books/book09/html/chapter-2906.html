<p>After Wan’er appeared, the crystal light around him stopped.
Under her gold light, the big crystal egg was like ice meeting the
sun. It melted quickly.</p>
<p>It was not just the big crystal egg melting. Even the
blonde-haired lady, who looked very similar to Wan’er, was melting.
Her body, which had once been like a statue, became soft and
started to melt. In the end, she melted into a liquid. She went
into the bottom of the mountain and the crystal wheel.</p>
<p>Strangely, after the blonde-haired lady’s body melted, it left
behind the shadow of some kind of spirit. Han Sen clearly saw that
the shadow possessed Wan’er’s face. It was like a spirit floating
in front of Wan’er. It looked a bit stiff.</p>
<p>Wan’er reached her hand out to try and touch the shadow. The
shadow was like a tide, and it went into Wan’er’s hands. A moment
later, it was gone.</p>
<p>Wan’er absorbed the shadow. Her body seemed to dim. She turned
and looked at Han Sen. She called him “Big Brother” with a weak
voice and passed out.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode faded. He moved to pick up
Wan’er. He felt her life force return to how it was in the
beginning. She was very weak and messed up.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Han Sen put Wan’er back inside Destiny’s
Tower. He was very confused.</p>
<p>From everything Han Sen had seen, he thought Wan’er should have
been related to Sacred. He did not think Sacred Leader was the big
brother Wan’er was referring to.</p>
<p>If Sacred Leader was her big brother, and Wan’er really relied
on her big brother, why would Sacred Leader use her for
experimentation?</p>
<p>Although Han Sen did not know what the blonde-haired lady in the
big egg did, one thing he knew for sure was that the blonde-haired
lady had Wan’er’s spirit. Otherwise, Wan’er would not have been
able to control it.</p>
<p>“Now, it looks like the people from Sacred took Wan’er’s spirit
to do some testing, which made Wan’er become really unstable. What
was the purpose of that test? A man-made God Spirit? Why use
Wan’er’s spirit?” Han Sen kept guessing. He could not think of a
result that made sense. Too many things were guesses. All the
results he thought of were just suggestions.</p>
<p>Katcha-cha!</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking, he saw the crystal wheel start
spinning. He was shocked. He thought the melted gold haired lady
had been revived.</p>
<p>Fortunately, what Han Sen was thinking did not happen. When the
crystal wheel spun, there was a pool in its center. The pool was
half-filled with a semi-transparent liquid.</p>
<p>When half of the crystal pool was completely revealed, the
crystal wheel stopped moving.</p>
<p>“Found deified xenogeneic gene… Found deified xenogeneic gene…”
In Han Sen’s brain, announcements kept popping up like crazy.</p>
<p>“The liquid in this pool… It cannot all be xenogeneic genes…”
Han Sen was frozen, but he was suddenly very happy. He flew toward
the pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried taking some liquid out. He immediately received an
announcement for getting a deified xenogeneic gene. Han Sen was so
excited that he almost jumped out of his seat.</p>
<p>“So many deified xenogeneic genes. Is it useful for me?” Han Sen
was afraid these deified xenogeneics genes were too low of a level
and would not help him increase his deified gene tally.</p>
<p>Han Sen drank some of the liquid. He quickly realized that his
worries were for naught. He drank an entire barrel of liquid. His
brain soon had deified gene +1 announcements.</p>
<p>“I am rich… I am so rich… I can be a true god…” Han Sen was so
happy that he kept absorbing the transparent liquid in the
pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly thought of something. “All that is set up here
was not exclusively prepared for Wan’er, right? Aside from her, not
even a true god elite could destroy the blonde-haired lady.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that was right. “Hehe. You cannot use it anyway.
Let me use it for now. Plus, you have been living inside me for so
long, you should pay rent.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to take all the transparent liquid away. He
realized that if the liquid left the crystal pool, they would be
corrupted very soon. He could not take it away. He had to stay next
to the pool and keep drinking the transparent liquid to refine
it.</p>
<p>Han Sen refined all the transparent liquid inside the pool. His
deified genes reached 94. He only needed a few more to become true
god.</p>
<p>“What a shame! I only need a few more.” Han Sen licked his lips
and flew out of the mountain.</p>
<p>From what he saw, he could not see the princes and princesses
again. He counted the time he had been down there and realized it
had been an entire month.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if the teleporter at the True Space Demon Dragon
can still be used,” Han Sen said while flying toward the first
island. “If I cannot use it, I will have to use the Four Sheep Cube
to leave.”</p>
<p>“Of course, you cannot use it anymore.” Han Sen flew in front of
the True Space Demon Dragon bones and discovered that the
teleporter was no longer available. He could not activate it from
the inside.</p>
<p>“Never mind. Right now, I still don’t know if Bai King was
trying to trick me. I do not want to go back to the Extreme King
yet. I can use this chance to escape the Extreme King.” Previously,
Han Sen did not want to leave the Extreme King completely due to
the resources they provided. Now, he was almost true god, so it did
not matter much if he did.</p>
<p>“That is a shame. I was planning to rescue Blood Kirin from the
Extreme King. Now, I can’t do it. I will have to think of another
way.” Han Sen used the Four Sheep Cube to leave that Starter King’s
Land.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Galaxy Teleportation to Space Garden. He lived
there quietly for a while. He needed six more deified genes to
become true god. Unfortunately, those six deified genes had to come
from a butterfly xenogeneic to suit his needs. Space Garden did not
have a high-level plant xenogeneic like that, so Han Sen had to
figure out another way.</p>
<p>“I only need six more points. Killing three butterfly
xenogeneics should be enough. Let me go to God Area and try my
luck. I might be able to encounter them.” Han Sen had an idea, so
he used the God Area Door. He used Han Sen’s identity to enter the
God Area.</p>
<p>“Han Godfather!” The moment Han Sen reached the God Area, he
noticed there a crowd of people assembled. Someone who saw him
recognized him. They were so surprised that they screamed. It made
everyone turn to look at Han Sen.</p>
