  Han Sen slashed the dying Demon Bug King’s wounds. With the cut, the Demon Bug King moaned, but it didn’t die.

He gathered more power and used Tusk alongside his Ghost Teeth Knife. He had to strike the bug fourteen times before hearing the familiar sound he enjoyed oh-so-much.

> “Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Gold Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic gene found.”

Han Sen was disappointed by this result. That mutant Gold Demon Bug King hadn’t given him a beast soul.

“Well, there are still twenty-three more of these motherfuckers to kill. There’s no need to panic just yet,” Han Sen thought to himself. He turned back to the white Metal Beast.

The white Metal Beast swallowed the mutant Gold Demon Bug King’s body. And like it had with the lesser variants, it spat out the mutant Gold Demon Bug King crystal. That crystal was even prettier than an ordinary King class.

The white Metal Beast pushed the mutant King-class and a few of the King class crystals towards Metal Eater. It seemed like Metal Beast intended them as a gift.

Han Sen felt depressed about this. He had never encountered anyone kind enough to gift him such a bounty of worthwhile gifts. Metal Eater did not seem to be able to digest those King class bug crystals, though. It tried to bite down on the crystals, but despite the effort, they did not break.

“If he cannot eat them now, why not let me keep them?” Han Sen asked with a smile.

The white Metal Beast ignored him, though. It merely took the bug crystals and stored them elsewhere. It wasn’t planning on Han Sen walking away with them.

Han Sen could do nothing except shake his head in dismay. The white Metal Beast then walked over to another gold cube. It made some noises at Han Sen, as if telling him to do his thing and open that one next.

Han Sen wanted to do this anyway, so he hastily ran over to the gold cube and put his deified spectacle back on. With it, he swiftly unlocked the password of the gold cube and opened it.

Bzzt!

The gold demon bugs swarmed out of the cube again. Just like before, the white Metal Beast was able to swallow them all. But this time, it did not spit out the bug crystals. After a while, though, it did spit out a mutant Gold Demon Bug King. And just like before, the poor bug was on the precipice of giving up the ghost.

Han Sen slashed it. The strike felt incredibly satisfying. Killing a King class xenogeneic wasn’t a thing many Marquises could ever hope to accomplish. And on top of that, this wasn’t just an ordinary King-class creature; it was a mutant King-class creature.

Han Sen was very weak right now, in the grand scheme of things. Ghost Teeth Knife slashed the Demon Bug King’s wounds, and after a few good swings, he finally slew the thing.

> “Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Gold Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic gene found.”

Han Sen sighed. Again, there was no beast soul for him. He would need to open the next cube to get what he sought.

One after another, they went through the cubes. After the seventh Gold Demon Bug King was slain, Han Sen was delighted to hear the announcement that informed him of his acquisition of a beast soul.

> “Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Gold Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Mutant Gold Demon Bug beast soul.”

Filled with excitement, Han Sen hurriedly checked out the Mutant Gold Demon Bug beast soul he had just managed to snag.

	<!-- Mutant Gold Demon Bug King beast soul: Bai Sema-type -->
</div> 

Upon seeing it, Han Sen laughed. “Ha! Ha! I really do get whatever I want! My luck is back.”

Now, Han Sen couldn’t wait to open the rest of the metal cubes. The white Metal Beast was having a good time, too, so it merrily followed along to eat its fill of the bugs that Han Sen was providing.

The next few Mutant Gold Demon Bug Kings did not provide him with any more beast souls, but just as he was resigning himself to the fact that he might not receive another Mutant Gold Demon Bug King beast soul, the last Mutant Gold Demon Bug King gave him another.

Han Sen was grinning ear-to-ear. He then went on to open the green cubes. He released the Green Demon Bugs so that the white Metal Beast could eat them.

> “Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Green Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Mutant Green Demon Bug beast soul.”

“Lady luck is head over heels for me, isn’t she?” Han Sen was ecstatic. He had received a beast soul from the very first Mutant Green Demon Bug King. That was quite a mood booster.

<div class="tables">

</div> 

Seeing that the Green Demon Bug King’s beast soul was also a Bai Sema, he was incredibly joyful.

But then, something changed. Han Sen kept killing the rest of the creatures that the white Metal Beast left for him, but he didn’t receive any more beast souls. Every time Han Sen believed he would get another beast soul, he didn’t. Their progress quickly devolved into a Mutant Demon Bug King murderfest.

“I am still quite happy to have gotten three mutant King beast souls. That haul is pretty impressive.” Han Sen didn’t complain about it too much, as he really was quite pleased to receive the three he had.

He didn't complain about it too much, as he really was quite pleased to receive the three he had.

The white Metal Beast scoffed down every demon bug it could, but it kept spitting out the King class bug crystals for Metal Eater. He didn’t take them back, either. They were like toys for Metal Eater.

Han Sen had concluded that the white Metal Beast could access another dimension. He was only storing the bug crystals, not eating them himself.

Ultimately, however, that did not matter to Han Sen. Having three Demon Bug King beast souls made him a very happy man already.

“Let’s see if the Gold Bai Sema and the Green Bai Sema are as strong as the blue one.” Han Sen summoned the Gold Demon Bug King’s beast soul.

Han Sen saw a gold light appear around him. Aside from the color being different, there did not seem to be anything separating it from the Blue Demon Bug King’s Bai Sema.

After checking out the Green Bai Sema, he noticed that it was exactly the same, as well. All that was different was the color. The defensive properties were identical.

“Can I use these Bai Semas together?” Han Sen thought to himself. Then, he summoned all of the Demon Bug King Bai Semas.

Han Sen summoned all four Demon Bug King Bai Semas, but one of them did not work.

The three Bai Semas he successfully summoned combined to become a blue, gold, and green Bai Sema. The one that he couldn’t summon for use was the second Gold Bai Sema.

“I can’t use the same-color Bai Sema beast souls together, but those of different colors can be combined.” Han Sen was surprised. He tried out the tri-color Demon Bug King Bai Sema, and noticed that it was far stronger than any single color Bai Sema.

This discovery was as surprising as it was exciting. “These Bai Sema beast souls can be combined. I wonder how many demon bugs the Breakskies created? If there are more colors, perhaps I can stack those together too. It might give me the defense of a deified being.”

Han Sen knew the chances of that were extremely low, though. Even if there were other colors out there, he might not be lucky enough to get their beast souls. In addition to that, finding the demon bugs would be a task and a half.

The Tri-Color Demon Bug King Bai Sema is strong enough for now. It will certainly withstand a half-deified elite.” Han Sen felt so happy.
