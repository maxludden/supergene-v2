<h2>Tree Egg Comes Out of the Hole</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2431</h3>

<p>“Luckily, I was able to retrieve the sword.” Night Wind stepped
in front of Miss Mirror and bowed. He placed the sword down in
front of her. The Duke was gone, so it seemed that Night Wind had
gotten rid of the man.</p>
<p>“The sword was broken?” Miss Mirror asked, looking directly at
Night Wind. She didn’t stoop to touch the sword.</p>
<p>It seemed like a pointless question to ask, but there was a
deeper meaning to her inquiry.</p>
<p>Night Wind knew what she was asking. He immediately answered,
“When I pulled it out, it was broken already. And I couldn’t find
any pieces of the blade in the surrounding area, either. I tested
what’s left of the blade, and while I don’t know what level it is,
it could cut through the rubble like butter.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood. Night Wind had answered three of Miss
Mirror’s questions. He wasn’t the one to break the sword, and the
sword hadn’t broken recently. Furthermore, the sword power was
still inside it.</p>
<p>“Let’s see if we can use it to widen the hole in the tree,” Miss
Mirror instructed Night Wind, still not touching the sword
herself.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew why Miss Mirror didn’t want to accept the sword;
she still didn’t know if Night Wind was going to betray her. If he
really held traitorous intentions, he would reveal his true self
and strike Miss Mirror down as soon as she took the sword.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t want to go against Night Wind just yet, so
she didn’t want to touch the sword. First, she wanted to see if
Night Wind could cut the tree open.</p>
<p>If he was unable to widen the hole, then the requiem egg tree
would remain beyond their reach. In that case, they would no longer
have any reason to distrust each other, and they’d continue
cooperating in order to remove their red-eye affliction.</p>
<p>Night Wind was the strongest one there, so they would need his
help.</p>
<p>“Let me see what I can do to free the egg,” Night Wind said, and
then he approached the opening in the requiem tree. He lifted the
sword and slashed toward the hole.</p>
<p>The dark color of the blade spread, and Night Wind’s dark
substance chain struck the tree hole. The darkness broke and
spilled everywhere.</p>
<p>But when the blade of the broken sword slammed into the hole, it
bit into the trunk of the tree, splitting the wood in a narrow
gash.</p>
<p>“It works!” Night Wind exulted. He pulled the broken sword free
and then continued to strike the tree hole. Wood chips flew
everywhere, and the fist-sized hole got bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Miss Mirror simply stood beneath the tree, watching.
While the broken sword was capable of cutting the tree, the wood of
the tree itself was still incredibly hard. Night Wind was making
progress, but only a few centimeters were achieved with each
strike.</p>
<p>After slashing at the tree for half an hour, the hole had been
expanded to the size of a frying pan’s lid. The requiem tree egg
still wasn’t visible through the hole, of course.</p>
<p>“We’re almost there. Try to pull the egg out so that we can
confirm that it’s genuine,” Miss Mirror said from down below.</p>
<p>Night Wind slung the broken sword across his back. He put his
hand inside and felt around until he got a firm grip on the egg.
Then he pulled the egg out as far as it would go. Only the tip was
showing, though, as the hole was too small to pull the egg out
completely.</p>
<p>From the part of it that was showing, the requiem tree egg
appeared to be transparent. It looked like amber, in that it was
tinged with a bit of gold. It looked pretty. It gave off a
fragrance that awakened Han Sen’s senses, like his body was being
rinsed clean by some holy liquid.</p>
<p>“It is a requiem tree egg!” Night Wind said with a grin.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror looked awed. Han Sen had never seen a requiem tree
egg before, so he didn’t know what it was supposed to look like,
but that gold crystal was obviously some good stuff.</p>
<p>Once they had confirmed the nature of the orb inside the tree,
Night Wind let the egg fall back into the hole and went back to
hacking at the tree trunk using the broken sword. Wood chips and
shavings flew everywhere as the hole grew steadily larger.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Miss Mirror looked at each other. They could see the
greediness and awareness in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>Such a giant requiem tree egg was the rarest of treasures. They
all wanted it for themselves, but Night Wind was too powerful. And
Han Sen and Miss Mirror couldn’t predict if Night Wind would betray
them.</p>
<p>In addition to being deified, he was now wielding that deadly
broken sword. If he did decide to turn on them, Han Sen and Miss
Mirror would be in a lot of danger.</p>
<p>After another hour of hacking away at the tree, the tree hole
was an entire meter wide. It seemed as if they’d be able to pull
the tree egg out now.</p>
<p>Night Wind swung the broken sword across his back. He leaned
into the greatly expanded hole, using his hands to try to pull the
egg out into the open.</p>
<p>Night Wind applied steady pressure, and the egg began to slide
steadily, if slowly, out of the hole. The giant requiem tree egg
was gold like amber, and the small section that had been revealed
so far looked like the narrow end of a chicken’s egg.</p>
<p>All three of them froze as they stared not at the egg itself,
but at what lay beneath the egg’s transparent exterior.</p>
<p>Within that small end of the gold egg, they could see a head. It
looked like the head of someone who was either a human or one of
the Extreme King.</p>
<p>The head appeared to belong to an eighteen-year-old girl. Her
eyes were closed peacefully, and her hair appeared to be gold, but
they couldn’t tell if that was just the tint of the tree egg or her
natural color.</p>
<p>Her eyelashes were long. In that serene pose, she looked like
Sleeping Beauty from the fairytale.</p>
<p>“Why does the requiem tree egg have a creature inside it?” Night
Wind asked, looking at the tree egg with confusion.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror looked at the tree egg, shook her head, and said, “I
don’t know. I’ve never heard of such a giant requiem tree egg. And
I’ve never heard of there being life inside one of them.”</p>
<p>“Is the requiem tree a xenogeneic? Can the requiem tree breed
and produce life?” Han Sen asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Maybe she accidentally entered the tree hole and died, and then
her body was covered by resin. Maybe that is how she ended up like
this,” Night Wind mumbled thoughtfully to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes suddenly hardened. He gritted his teeth and said,
“Now we have one more person!”</p>
<p>When Night Wind and Miss Mirror heard him, their brows furrowed.
The prediction of the six pictures revealed four faceless men. They
thought that they had changed things by getting rid of the Duke.
When their numbers were reduced to three, they thought they had
trumped the prophecy.</p>
<p>But now the tree egg had a human-like creature inside, and that
brought their numbers back up to four.</p>
<p>The three of them looked at each other nervously. Night Wind
gnashed his teeth. He wanted to push the tree egg back into the
hole.</p>
<p>But the tree egg suddenly shone with a golden light, and a wave
of power tossed Night Wind away from the egg and the girl it
contained. The egg shot out of the hole like a bullet, then fell to
the ground where it rolled for a bit.</p>
<p>Now that they could see the tree egg’s full appearance, it was
just as Miss Mirror had predicted. Two meters tall and one meter
wide. It was like a giant amber egg.</p>
<p>A naked, fifteen-year-old girl lay inside that tree egg. Beneath
the blonde hair that spread across her shoulders, they could see a
tattoo covering her whole back.</p>
<p>“A Nine-Life Cat!” Han Sen thought the instant he saw the
tattoo. His nostrils flared, and he barely kept himself from
shouting the words.</p>
