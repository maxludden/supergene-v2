The scripture of Jadeskin opened with these words, "Jade skin and flawless body, evils away and spells vain."

When he sipped the water, Han Sen knew something was wrong, but he still drank it without hesitation.

Hearing a humming, Han Sen felt like his mind and eyes were sucked into Qin Xuan’s eyes and the he almost lost his consciousness.

Almost at the same time, a coolness welled from his limbs. Jadeskin started to run in his body automatically and the coolness restored his senses.

"This woman wants to hypnotize me. What’s she trying to do?" Han Sen sneered inwardly, but didn’t show anything on his face. He maintained that confused look.

"Han Sen, are my eyes not pretty?" Qin Xuan asked.

"They are pretty," Han Sen answered in a low voice.

"Which part of my body do you like best?" Qin Xuan asked again.

"Your boobs," Han Sen did not hesitate to answer.

"Why?" Qin Xuan asked again.

"They are big, soft and bouncy," Han Sen replied.

"Nasty!" Qin Xuan whispered. When they were in the combat room, Han Sen must have touched her boobs when they fought.

"Come and touch them," Qin Xuan said, lifting her chest.

Han Sen did not hesitate to reach out his hands and Qin Xuan suddenly pushed his hands aside. Now she could confirm that Han Sen had been completely hypnotized by her, as any normal person would hesitate when hearing such an odd request, which Han Sen did not.

"Are you Dollar?" Qin Xuan's first question scared the hell out of him.

Han Sen didn’t realize Qin Xuan had connected some dots. Without time to think any further, he answered, "No."

Qin Xuan nodded, apparently not believing the two were the same person herself. She continued to ask, "Why are you unwilling to go to Blackhawk?"

"Because it was too far away from home," Han Sen replied.

"How is that relevant?" Qin Xuan did not understand his logic.

"I wouldn’t be able to take care of my mom and my sister if it is too far away from home," Han Sen replied slowly.

Qin Xuan was a bit surprised and then her look softened. She asked, "Have you ever considered to join my squad?"

"No."

"Why?" Qin Xuan was slightly angry.

"I'm afraid of danger. I cannot die," replied Han Sen.

"Why can’t you die?" Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen, finding his reply curious.

"If I die, my mom and my sister will be bullied by my relatives, and I cannot let them be bullied," Han Sen continued to answer.

Qin Xuan’s expression became more and more gentle, and she continued to ask, "Why did you agree to join Bullseye?"

"Because of you."

"Me?" Qin Xuan was confused.

"Because I like you." Han Sen still had a dull face on.

Qin Xuan blushed a little, "Why do you like me?"

"Because you are beautiful."

"Is there any other reason?"

"Yes."

"What reason?" Surprisingly, Qin Xuan was slightly excited to hear the answer.

"Because you are beautiful."

"Isn’t this the same reason?" Qin Xuan frowned.

"No."

"Why not?" Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen, puzzled.

"Because the first time I saw you, I thought you are beautiful; the second time I saw you, you are more beautiful. I can’t move away my eyes and want to look at you forever..."

Qin Xuan’s cheeks turned crimson. She raised her arm and wanted to slap Han Sen out of it, but eventually didn’t have the heart to do that and just gave him a pinch swiftly.

Han Sen fell to the ground suddenly with an "ouch," acting as if he had fallen under the bed in sleep.

Qin Xuan subconsciously reached out her hand, but took it back and let Han Sen fall to the ground as she blushed at certain thoughts.

"What did you do to me?" Han Sen suddenly climbed up from the ground and pretended to be frightened.

"You do not have to worry, I just wanted to know why you do not want to go to Blackhawk." Qin Xuan said softly.

"You hypnotized me?" Han Sen was raged.

"One must go through this process to join the squad. The people we serve are special, so we must guarantee that every member had a clean slate. I myself had to go through the same thing." Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen and said gently, "You can rest assured that your family will be protected by the military once you go to Blackhawk and join my squad. No one could hurt them."

Han Sen looked uncertain and remained silent.

"Also, I can tell you that each shelter has the same kind of squad, providing service for special clients. This job wouldn’t put you in great danger. And that’s everything I can tell you. You can think about it yourself."

Not hearing an answer, Qin Xuan had to ask, "What do you think? Do you want to join my squad?"

"Do I still have an option?" Han Sen said with a wry smile.

"Try to be admitted to the Blackhawk. After joining my squad, you will be glad about your decision today." Qin Xuan patted Han Sen's shoulder, pleased.

"Oh, if you need anything just let me know. I’ll try to assist you so that you could prepare for the entrance exam of Blackhawk," Qin Xuan said.

"I just want to know one thing. When I was hypnotized, did you ask me any other question other than why I wasn’t interested in Blackhawk?" Han Sen asked.

"No, I am a well-behaved soldier. And I am not interested in your private matters," Qin Xuan said categorically, with her heart pounding as if there were a cat scratching at it.

"Really?" Han Sen seemed to be worried still.

"Of course not. Let me know if you need anything. As long as it doesn’t cost too much, I will help you prepare for the exam, which is in less than two months," Qin Xuan side said and left, her face burning.

After Qin Xuan left, Han Sen let out a long sigh of relief. From now on, Qin Xuan probably wouldn’t suspect him again.

"This is an excellent opportunity. Qin Xuan would completely trust me after this so she can become my cover. Others would think I got stronger and better because of her help and wouldn’t suspect that I am Dollar. Then, I could gradually show my real ability using my own identity and abandon the guise of Dollar altogether," Han Sen thought to himself. This was why he had agreed to Qin Xuan’s ask. Also, his family could indeed use the protection of the military.

Han Sen then teleported into God’s Sanctuary as it was Dollar’s time to participate in the second round of the martial arts contest.
