<h2>No One Can Stop</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3218</h3>

<p>After Shadow God was killed, the city streets, aircraft, humans,
and everything else was gone. The third sky was suddenly turned
into a land of ash. It was now the remnants of a former
well-developed human area. Everywhere one looked was now just a
land of cracks and streams of lava. One could sometimes see
volcanos exploding far away. The volcanic dust was everywhere. The
sky was dark, but there were no clouds. It was the dust that the
erupting volcanos kicked up.</p>
<p>The land looked like doomsday had happened. Han Sen scanned the
area around him until he spotted a god temple. The god temple was
made of a mirror. It looked like a maze made of mirrors.</p>
<p>The mirror hall displayed a signpost that had three words
written on it: “Shadow God Temple.” It belonged to the Shadow God,
who had only just been vanquished.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. The Shadow God Temple was still there.
It did not matter if Shadow God was revived, but the temple’s god
base should have still been there.</p>
<p>There was an 80% to 90% chance that it was an Annihilation-class
god base. Han Sen’s heart jumped. He clenched his fists and went
straight for the Shadow God Temple.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra were running at the
same time. The two scary powers combined to create Break World
powers. He threw a punch at the Shadow God Temple.</p>
<p>“God base, I am coming for you!” Han Sen’s heart exclaimed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Break World power struck the Shadow God Temple, but
the Shadow God Temple did not break like he expected it would. He
saw a red Break World power strike the Shadow God Temple, which was
like a god temple reflecting a thousand other god temples in the
mirage. Han Sen realized he had almost hit himself with the Break
World</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the reaction time of his body was extraordinarily
quick. He managed to avoid his own punch. The Shadow God Temple
reflected the Break World power back at Wan’er, who was swiftly on
her way. Wan’er just waved her hand to break it.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! This is so funny. That Han Sen is only good at running.
He is not good at anything else.” An elder laughed.</p>
<p>“He is not as strong as we thought, but he does drag a lot of
baggage and carnage along with him in his wake. He provoked the God
Chaos Party and the ire of this scary woman. And now? Now, he is
trying to bring disaster to the God Chaos Party. This guy should
definitely die.”</p>
<p>“You guys should not be so quick to underestimate him,” someone
else said. “He did not break the Shadow God Temple because he does
not know anything about the Shadow God Temple. It does not imply he
is not strong. From what I can tell, his Break World power can
rival the eight sky kings.” It was an analysis of a different
kind.</p>
<p>“Did you guys forget he was able to take the Grey Inch Sword?
That means his willpower is mighty. People like that, even if they
are weak, can be incredibly scary. We must not underestimate him.”
While everyone in the God Chaos Party was discussing the ongoing
events, Han Sen’s eyes were bright. The Shadow God Temple was
weird. The building’s mirror-like bricks had a reflective power.
They were able to reflect Break World powers back.</p>
<p>“I don’t know Shadow God Temple could deflect Wan’er’s power. If
that is possible, I might be able to deal with Wan’er.” Han Sen
flew toward the Shadow God Temple.</p>
<p>He did not know what Wan’er was thinking, but it was like she
recognized Han Sen. She traveled through space and went behind him.
She waved her hand behind Han Sen’s back.</p>
<p>Han Sen was well-prepared. Rather, that was the place he had
already selected. He deliberately drew Wan’er there, so that was
where she would attack.</p>
<p>The moment Wan’er struck, Han Sen’s body was already evading.
The gold light went right past his cheek and struck the back of
Shadow God Temple.</p>
<p>The gold fire hit the surface of the mirror-like temple. The
many mirrors reflected the scary gold light. It made the Shadow God
Temple glow like a sun.</p>
<p>The god light did not actually get deflected. The mirrors were
delivered hefty marks. It wasn’t long before they all buckled and
broke.</p>
<p>Seeing Shadow God Temple was unable to stop Wan’er’s power, the
temple broke. Han Sen didn’t say a word. He just drew Inch Grey
Sword and slashed at the Shadow God Temple with light.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen cut open the Shadow God Temple, which was already in the
middle of breaking. The temple shattered. Han Sen cut the god altar
in half.</p>
<p>“Destroyed Annihilation-class god temple. Found
Annihilation-class god base.”</p>
<p>Han Sen saw that the broken god altar had a god base. He quickly
grabbed it and teleported away. The entire process was so smooth
that it was like water. It was clean and quick. It did not drag
like mud. It was like he had practiced this a million times.</p>
<p>“This guy is very obscene.” When one of the members of God Chaos
Party saw this, he gnashed his teeth. Han Sen was unable to break
Shadow God Temple, so he used Wan’er to do it for him. While she
was doing her thing, he swooped in for the spoils. He took the god
base, which made them very mad.</p>
<p>“That asshole! Weapon God’s god base must have been stolen by
him as well.”</p>
<p>“Humans really are obscene, shameless assholes. Qin Xiu was like
that. Han Sen is like that. None of them are good stuff.”</p>
<p>“Leader, let me go and fight. I can kill that asshole.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not think poorly of his behavior. He was thinking,
“I destroyed Shadow God Temple. I did not get the notification for
killing Shadow God though. That means Shadow God did not revive
inside Shadow God Temple. I wonder if it was just the god temple
being too slow to revive him or Wan’er’s power being able to kill
God Spirits for good.”</p>
<p>There was no time for Han Sen to dwell on such riddles. Wan’er
was still close behind, and she was not slowing down. Han Sen used
what he had at his disposal. Even still, it was proving
insufficient to ditch her. He felt depressed and thought, “Why is
Wan’er continuing to chase me? Is it because I am too handsome? Am
I too attractive? Otherwise, why would she not go after the Qin
family instead? Why does she insist on coming after</p>
<p>me?”</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it some more, Han Sen’s heart jumped.
“It cannot be because of my Super God Spirit mode, can it? My Super
God Spirit mode goes against her power. Maybe she is
sub-consciously wanting to destroy anything that might one day pose
a threat to her? Is that why she is so committed to destroying
me?”</p>
<p>The more Han Sen thought about it, the more he thought that was
the reason. Otherwise, Wan’er would not have kept chasing him
without letting him go.</p>
<p>Each of the 33 skies was massive, but Han Sen’s power was not
restricted there. With his Galaxy Teleportation, he could go
anywhere among the 33 skies.</p>
<p>The bad thing about it all was that he had no method of
teleporting into the different time and space layers. He had to
find each entrance to every layer of the place. He had to go up the
skies individually by himself, which was costing him a lot of
time.</p>
<p>Not long later, Han Sen finally managed to find the entrance to
the fourth floor. He then found the fifth floor, sixth floor,
seventh floor, and so on. Han Sen kept on going without anyone
coming to stop him.</p>
<p>Besides the God Chaos Party’s elites or ministers not coming,
Han Sen did not even encounter the cold shoulder of a shrimp and
crab along the way. The rest of the 33 skies were practically
empty. Aside from the sky creatures that were native to their
special skies, there was not a single soul to be found.</p>
<p>“It seems as if the God Chaos Party is aware of what I am after.
They are not fighting Wan’er face to face.” Han Sen frowned. He was
a bit hesitant about whether or not he should keep going.</p>
