<h2>Drawing the Disaster to the East</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3215</h3>

<p>The Super God Spirit mode and Wan’er’s power were like water and
fire. Water could put out fire, and fire could burn water. If there
was the same amount, they would put each other out. It was like
when Han Sen and Wan’er were together, their powers were
suppressed.</p>
<p>After two Wan’ers combined into one, her power exploded. She was
much better than Han Sen with his Super God Spirit mode. That was
why the scales were now tipped.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, they were restricting each other. If
one of their powers was stronger than the other, there would have
been a big restriction. Now, Wan’er’s power was twice as strong. It
made Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode useless. He was suppressed
because of that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen did not rely on only one power. Although
his Super God Spirit mode was suppressed, he still had four other
geno powers.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care about the balance of the universe. He broke
the rules of the universe and broke the world. He used Galaxy
Teleportation to take Bao’er to the entrance of Soldier Knife
Sky.</p>
<p>With Wan’er’s situation being like it was, drawing her there was
something of a disaster. It was a disaster that could harm innocent
people. He preferred taking her to the God Chaos Party people than
having her hurt civilians.</p>
<p>Wan’er was like a frozen spirit. Han Sen used Galaxy
Teleportation, but he still could not shake her. She steadily
followed.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a gold light. He felt a chill. His body was like the
tide bobbing along the waves. It was like he was pushed away by the
gold light in his attempt to dodge the scary attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to use the Break World powers to enter Soldier
Knife Sky’s space tunnel, but Wan’er’s attack had cut a giant hole
in the tunnel.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, he went into Soldier Knife Sky. By doing so,
he re-entered the mysterious world of weapons.</p>
<p>Wan’er hurriedly followed Han Sen there. She did not say
anything. She just waved her hand at Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>She was too fast. When her hand came down, it was like she was
already slashing at Han Sen. He did not have time to react.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen’s battle power had already reached the
reflection level. Before his brain reacted, his body reacted
normally and dodged the scary attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed. He shouted at Wan’er, “I thought we were
friends! It is fine if you do not remember me, but you do not have
to keep chasing me!”</p>
<p>Wan’er behaved as if she had not heard a word he said. She
slashed her hand again.</p>
<p>In that world, there were not many people who could fight
Wan’er. Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode was suppressed, but he had
a lot of battle experience and power. Wan’er was unable to kill
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew this would not turn out well if it kept going. He
could only fight or escape, hoping to leave Wan’er’s range of
pursuit.</p>
<p>He did not want to kill Wan’er, but he did not want to be killed
by Wan’er either. Ergo, he had no choice but to run.</p>
<p>Wa-la! Wa-la!</p>
<p>Paper kept flipping and flopping inside Bao’er’s pocket as her
book suddenly opened up. From inside, a paper man jumped out and
scolded Han Sen by saying, “Han Sen, you are an asshole! Didn’t you
promise me you would not leave Jade Wall City? Is your f<em>cking
word nothing but bullshit? You left Jade Wall City and came to the
f</em>cking Soldier Knife Sky. It is fine if you come to Soldier
Knife Sky, but you brought Master Bao’er here.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you shut up for just a minute?” Han Sen moved and
evaded Wan’er’s next attack. He said to the paper man, Rocky Dee,
“I did not want to come here either, but something forced me here.
I had no choice.” “Who made you do this?” Rocky Dee asked that just
as Wan’er’s hand moved. A bottomless trench cleaved through the
land, which was full of weapons. Many scary weapons were
destroyed.</p>
<p>The weapons around the trench did not react. They did not fight
back or anything. All they did was tremble as if they were sheep
encountering a tiger.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s face changed as he shouted, “This is… What is
this?”</p>
<p>“I do not know who it is. I only know she fancies killing me.
She has already chased me everywhere, so what do you propose I
should have done? Do you have any better ideas?” Han Sen spoke as
he dodged and flew around. “How could there be such a scary human?”
Rocky Dee coldly asked. “You are a magnet for scary people. I can
only suppose you have tremendously bad luck. What am I supposed to
do?”</p>
<p>“If you cannot think of a solution to this mess, then I will
come up with one myself.” Han Sen flew deep into Soldier Knife
Sky.</p>
<p>Every layer of the Thirty-Three Days’ skies was broken. God
Chaos Party was massive, but they could not connect all of those
spaces. They only made a path that led to each one, one by one.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to find a way into the second sky. If he kept
ascending, it would only be a matter of time before he encountered
more members of God Chaos Party.</p>
<p>If there were a few people like Sky King Leader, and they wanted
to stop Wan’er, perhaps Han Sen could escape.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee could tell what Han Sen was planning to do. He looked
extremely glum as he said, “You must have a death wish. If you do
not handle this well, you will find yourself the enemy of both. It
is fine for you to die, but don’t let Master Bao’er go down with
you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care for anything Rocky Dee said to him. He kept
using Galaxy Teleportation in Soldier Knife Sky. Every time he
teleported, it was not a great distance away. He did not want to
miss the path or tunnel that led to the second sky.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s real body was in the Paper God Temple. He felt
depressed. It was hard for him to convince the leader to find
someone else to kill Han Sen. Now, Han Sen was going after
them.</p>
<p>There was also someone absurdly powerful behind him. Rocky Dee
had experienced a reboot of the universe. He was a god in two
worlds, but he had never seen a human this powerful before.</p>
<p>“Even Qin Xiu was not this scary back in the day. Who is this
woman?” Rocky Dee frowned and retreated into thought.</p>
<p>He did not care for Han Sen’s life, but he had to care for
Bao’er’s life.</p>
<p>Han Sen was trying to bring this problem to God Chaos Party. Its
leader was not a character Han Sen should provoke. If Han Sen did
not handle things well, he could end up being attacked by both
parties. Then, he would die even faster.</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>With the video the paper man sent, Rocky Dee saw Han Sen reached
the second sky’s entrance. His face changed. He gnashed his teeth
and abandoned Paper God Temple.</p>
<p>After Weapon God was killed, Soldier Knife Sky was not given a
new god to take over the realm. Some members of the God Chaos Party
saw Han Sen, but they did not have the power to stop him. They
watched Han Sen race through the gate and enter the second sky.</p>
<p>The second sky’s scene was different from Soldier Knife Sky.
There were no mounds of weapons that were like seas or mountains.
After Han Sen entered it, water was seen in every direction. It was
a pure water world.</p>
<p>There was no land or air. That entire world was full of
water.</p>
<p>The water there seemed a bit weird. It was not just one color.
There were all kinds of liquid colors combined into one. It was
like a colorful rainbow liquid world.</p>
