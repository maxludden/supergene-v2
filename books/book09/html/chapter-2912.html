<p>The big barren systems. That place was like a heaven for those
in search of high-level xenogeneics. There were all kinds of
deified xenogeneics, but all of them seemed to be in a perpetual
rage. Therefore, it was a dangerous place to venture.</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s current power, there was no need to worry too
much about it.</p>
<p>“Littleflower should be in the big barren systems. With my
current power, if I can find Littleflower, I will be able to save
him from Old Cat.” Han Sen made up his mind to go to the big barren
systems.</p>
<p>Previously, the reason he had not gone was not that he did not
want to save or care about Littleflower. It was because he lacked
the necessary power. If he died in the big barren system, his
family would die.</p>
<p>He knew Littleflower was not in any danger. So, Han Sen kept a
low profile while trying to slowly level up.</p>
<p>“Now should be the time.” Han Sen set up things in Space Garden.
He readied himself to go to the big barren system.</p>
<p>There was nothing much to prepare. Ever since Qin Xuan came to
the geno universe, she had been in charge of many things. She
managed Space Garden very well. It made the Han Sen, who was a bad
leader, a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>“It is a shame Ning Yue has already become primitive. He still
cannot get rid of the little green sword affecting him. The little
green sword is stronger than I thought it would be.” Han Sen was
hoping for Ning Yue to get well soon so he could be useful
again.</p>
<p>Ling’er was sent back to the Alliance by Han Sen. Kindergarten
was going to start again, so she had to return there to study. She
could not stay in the universe.</p>
<p>Although Ling’er’s body could survive in the big universe, and
she was able to adjust to the environment of the big universe and
was better than most creatures in it, Han Sen wanted her childhood
to be one of peace in the Alliance.</p>
<p>Han Sen packed some necessities. He was preparing to use Space
Teleportation to reach the big barren systems. He suddenly felt
something heavy on his back. Bao’er landed on his back. She grabbed
his neck and was being cute. “Dad, Space Garden is boring! Bao’er
wants to follow you.”</p>
<p>“It is too dangerous this time. You should just stay home. I
will take you out of here next time.” Although Bao’er was special,
the big barren system was too dangerous. Han Sen was not planning
on taking her.</p>
<p>“No! Bao’er wants to go now.” Bao’er used her hands to grip Han
Sen’s neck. She refused to let go. No matter what Han Sen said, she
could not be convinced. She really wanted to go with him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt guilty, so he agreed to take Bao’er with him.
“Fine, but you must be good. You cannot just runoff.”</p>
<p>Bao’er, on her own, was not weak. Han Sen was also quite
confident in his own abilities. Even if he was unable to fight, he
could escape with Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Long live my Daddy.” Bao’er happily jumped into Han Sen’s chest
and kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt bad. He rubbed Bao’er on the head. He could not
resist her.</p>
<p>There were many ways into the big barren systems. The most
direct way was to make use of the Four Sheep Cube. With it, he
could enter the big barren system right away. He could even open
the gate in the Alliance.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it for some time. He decided to head there
via the universe, searching from the outside to the inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen read a lot of information about the big barren system.
He did not see anything genuinely useful. Most of what he saw were
just guesses driven by old myths and legends.</p>
<p>That was expected. Ordinary deifieds who entered the big barren
systems rarely came back alive. Those that dared to go were either
butterfly elites or higher. They would not casually post about
their experiences in the big barren systems on the internet. It was
expensive, classified information.</p>
<p>The space was all greyed out. He could see giant machines
everywhere. There were planets with lots of holes. It was like most
of the planets were snowing.</p>
<p>In space, it was impossible for it to snow. These things,
floating in space with the shape of a snowflake, were things Han
Sen had no idea about. They were like ash from a volcano.</p>
<p>This was the edge of the big barren system. Although he had just
entered the big barren systems, it felt lonely there. It made
people feel rather bad.</p>
<p>A broken battleship floated through space like an asteroid. It
kept hitting other asteroids to make a deep sound. The pieces of
the battleship and asteroids were covered in the grey dust. After
the hit, some parts were showing.</p>
<p>“I wonder how far away from East Holy Kirin Garden we are.” Han
Sen went to East Holy Kirin Garden once before. This time, his way
was different. He hadn’t been here before.</p>
<p>“Dad, what is this?” Bao’er sat on Han Sen’s shoulder, pointing
at the broken ships.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked to where Bao’er was pointing. He saw the broken
ships had been hit by meteors. The grey dust was like an avalanche
that started to break.</p>
<p>It was a battleship that was partially ball-shaped. Many of its
parts were broken. It was like an apple that had been bitten in
half.</p>
<p>Because dust had fallen, one was able to see a broken spot. Some
orange light seeped out. The orange light was fluctuating between
bright and dark, which was why Bao’er noticed it.</p>
<p>Han Sen carefully flew to the ship. He used the Dongxuan Aura to
keep scanning the battleship. He did not want to discover a
xenogeneic inside.</p>
<p>Fortunately, what worried Han Sen did not come to pass. He
entered the battleship from the broken portions. He did not feel
the presence of xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Inside the battleship, however, was chaos. The tools and wires
were all broken. Most of the stuff was covered in white dust.</p>
<p>The flickering, orange light came from a corner. Han Sen waved
his hand to brush all the pieces around that corner away. The
glowing thing underneath was a very cute doll.</p>
<p>That doll had the face of a little girl. She had black hair and
big eyes. She was wearing a beautiful dress, but it was covered in
dust. Thus, it looked very vintage.</p>
<p>The place that released orange light was atop the doll’s chest.
The doll’s neck had a pendant necklace. The pendant was an orange
gem. It had been the gem flickering like a lamp the whole time.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his hand and sucked. He pulled the girl doll and
necklace over. The white dust fell off. The dust was
everywhere.</p>
