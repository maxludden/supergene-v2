    <p>
      The Emerald Golem was dying, and the little angel effortlessly exploited
      its every weakness. Within half an hour, it would most probably lie dead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Emerald Golem consistently cried and roared out, but it was unable to
      do anything else. The little angel&#8217;s greatsword repeatedly struck
      the neck of the Emerald Golem until its head was hewn off.
    </p>

    <p>
      It did not die when the head was removed, however. It continued to fight
      the little angel, even with a headless body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the little angel wasn&#8217;t human. Decapitating the golem
      did not make her careless or have her drop her guard, and she was able to
      dodge the headless golem&#8217;s surprise attack following its beheading.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure its defeat, the little angel spent the next several hours
      hacking away the rest of the golem&#8217;s crystal limbs.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Emerald Golem Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. The
        Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You May Harvest Its Life Geno
        Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno
        Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Not receiving its beast soul was a little disappointing for Han Sen, but
      regardless, he picked up the fallen creature&#8217;s green Life Geno
      essence. He unsummoned the little angel and left the nest.
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not return to the shelter, but traveled west instead. During his
      research, he had learned of two nearby locations he wanted to check out.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was an area comprised of sprawling meadows, each painted with
      innumerable flowers that were all knitted together. As serene as the area
      was, the number of flowers put it on the radar for a great many insects.
      Butterflies, bees, ants, and more frequented this place.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it was said there was something even spookier that resided there,
      something that stilled the hearts and desires for all who ventured near.
      To determine the validity of people&#8217;s fears, Han Sen wanted to
      travel into the heart of the meadows and see for himself whether or not
      there was a super creature residing there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bugs were known to produce many offspring. If there was a super creature
      insect there, it might have been similar to the Devil Ant King, and
      possess a large number of eggs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The verdant expanse before him was quite lumpy, but it was dressed with a
      sea of colorful flowers. These meadows went on and on towards the horizon,
      appearing endless.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flowers weren&#8217;t particularly large, but they grew close to the
      soil and fit together as if to paint the ground. The colors did not just
      stem from the large variety of flowers budding in harmonic unison, but
      individual flowers themselves could possess up to eight colors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countless butterflies and bees danced in the air around them, yet no
      person ever went there to hunt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ventured into the flowery meadows and brought the silver fox along
      with him. All the butterflies and bees made sure to escape and flee for
      the lives in fear of the super creature pet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little fairy retreated into her scallop shell. After recovering from
      her wounds, the liquid inside no longer dealt her harm. As such, she
      frequently enjoyed hiding inside it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After walking for some time, Han Sen was given a big surprise. He saw a
      person in the field, killing creatures. Many insects swarmed towards him,
      but despite that, the man looked calm and composed. Untouched by a single
      creature, he gently swung his sword to slay each that came for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Jing Jiwu?&#8221; When Han Sen recognized the man, he became even
      more surprised. He was the monster from the Alliance&#8217;s Central
      Military Academy. In the Military Academy&#8217;s League Game, in archery,
      Han Sen won his first championship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jing Jiwu now caught sight of Han Sen&#8217;s approach, and sped up to
      finish off the creatures that pestered him. Within a single second, he
      managed to slay around a thousand butterflies. The field was, for now,
      empty of the fluttering fiends. Once he was done, he walked towards Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I never expected a chance encounter with you here, of all
      places,&#8221; Jing Jiwu said casually as he approached Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I could not have expected this, either.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.
      Although they were once opponents, it was nice to meet him there.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have heard you are in possession of a super pet,&#8221; Jing Jiwu
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Han Sen nodded. High-class officers had long spread
      this news, so it wasn&#8217;t at all surprising for Jing Jiwu to know
      about the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Walk west for one hundred miles and you&#8217;ll come across a
      muddy hill. There are many gold-winged bees there, and quite possibly
      super creatures, too. If you are interested, you should go and take a
      look,&#8221; Jing Jiwu said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thanks.&#8221; Han Sen bid his appreciation and then took off in
      the direction he was told to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      They didn&#8217;t speak much with one-another, but they were cooperative
      and adherent to the other&#8217;s needs. Han Sen did not doubt the
      information he was given.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was hoping we would one day meet again, and when we did,
      I&#8217;d be strong enough to re-challenge you. I am short of that
      goal.&#8221; Seeing Han Sen walk off, Jing Jiwu watched him go. He
      continued to think to himself, &#8220;Yes, become stronger. Go further.
      Give me the motivation to catch up with you. That will assuredly stoke a
      fire in the hearts of humanity.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he threw himself into the midst of another legion of butterflies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued traveling in the direction Jing Jiwu had indicated, and
      after walking one hundred miles, he came across a forty meter high hill
      that was shaped like a mushroom. There were many small burrows underneath,
      from which golden-bees came in and out of. They were each around the size
      of a fist.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;These really aren&#8217;t your average bees. I am afraid there
      might indeed be a super creature in this place.&#8221; Han Sen was
      standing one hundred meters away from the hill, yet the silver fox&#8217;s
      presence did nothing to alarm the golden bees.
    </p>

    <p>
      There had to be a super creature burrowed deep inside. If there
      wasn&#8217;t, then the bees would have assuredly paid heed to the silver
      fox&#8217;s approach. They&#8217;d have been long gone by now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was thinking about how he might flush the bee king out and see
      what manner of super creature he&#8217;d be dealing with. But as he
      thought, he caught sight of a lone pretty flower atop the hill.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flower had no roots or leaves; it just stood there atop the hill. It
      was a few meters wide and the petals looked like those of a chinese rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flower was mostly yellow, but it was colored with a few streaks of
      red. It was very pretty. It also emitted a pleasant smell. It was strong
      but not overwhelming, and just smelling that fragrance compelled you to
      come closer and sniff it at a closer distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flower was beautiful. And it looked as if honey was oozing from inside
      the bud. But despite the large number of golden-bees that populated the
      area, not a single one ventured close to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Strange. That is really strange. Why is there a lone flower atop a
      beehive, remaining untouched by the bees that live below? And the rest of
      the flowers in this place are no larger than my finger, so why is this one
      so large? There must be something wrong with this thing.&#8221; Han Sen
      used his dongxuan aura to scan the flower.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because it was quite far from him, he couldn&#8217;t scan it with much
      detail. Still, he was able to grasp some sort of horrific lifeforce where
      it lay.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is that flower producing creatures, or is it perhaps something that
      strengthens your body?&#8221; Han Sen looked at the flower with a strange
      look on his face, wanting to be as careful as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had seen this sort of thing many times. Treasures like this
      frequently had frightening monsters nearby, and such creatures were never
      in short supply. Whenever such flowers matured, other creatures were bound
      to show up.
