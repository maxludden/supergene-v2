  Han Sen kept firing his two pistols without reprieve, countering each of Shale’s punching powers. No matter how strong Shale’s punches were, none of them could come close to touching Han Sen.

It had taken Li Chun Qiu mere moments to confirm that when Shale used Star Explode, his power only equaled Han Sen. His expression looked strained, and he thought to himself, “If this is Han Sen’s base power, then that is too scary.”

Li Keer and Exquisite were even more stunned, because they knew for sure that they were only seeing Han Sen’s base power. He wasn’t using a power-enhancing geno art like Shale was.

His base power was enough to fight back Shale’s Star Explode. That was almost unbelievable.

In truth, Han Sen thought this was an expected result. After all, his four top geno arts had all reached a deified level. Each geno art had the power of a deified, and he had four of them reinforcing the same body. Their additions to his power weren’t merely additive.

As time went by, Shale was getting stronger and stronger. His body shone with ever-increasing starlight, but his punches were still being negated by Han Sen’s bullets. The ten minutes were flying by, and Shale’s skin was starting to crack and bleed. It didn’t look like he was going to last long.

“Han Sen, take my punch again!” Shale roared. He punched toward Han Sen like a raging madman.

The next second, Han Sen saw the valley before him fill up with an uncountable number of suns. The punching power was like an entire constellation exploding.

“Return to Origin under Star Explode. Even a larva deified elite would have reason to fear that blow,” Li Chun Qiu thought to himself.

Shale’s performance was greater than he realized. Beneath Star Explode, he could still perfectly activate a punch using Return to Origin. Shale’s power and talent were truly excellent.

Han Sen saw the punching power washing toward him like a flooded river. He didn’t plan on falling back, though. He combined his two pistols to form another weapon. It was a rocket launcher.

Han Sen lifted the launcher in his arms. He took aim and fired a rocket at the star river-like punching power. A beam of light was emitted from the launcher, and it went soaring into the center of Shale’s attack.

“No matter how strong that rocket is, it cannot go against Return to Origin while it is fueled by Star Explode,” Li Chun Qiu thought to himself. The next second, he froze.

The rocket slammed into the center of that stream of punches that was like a river of stars, and then it detonated like a nuclear bomb. The explosion consumed every bit of Shale’s punching power.

Boom!

The following eruption looked as if it could melt the entire universe. Inside that beautiful example of Star Explode, there was too much light for the observers to look. They couldn’t see anything.

When the lights of the explosion receded, Li Chun Qiu saw Han Sen and Shale still in one piece within the valley. But an enormous crater had been torn into the stone of the valley between them.

Han Sen didn’t attack, and Shale didn’t attack, either. But everyone knew Shale had already lost. His Star Explode time was up. He didn’t have the power to fight Han Sen anymore.

“I lose,” Shale admitted honestly. But Han Sen could tell that the man still wanted to fight. He wasn’t going to quit because of a one-time failure.

Li Chun Qiu didn’t say anything. Han Sen really had won. Anyone could tell Han Sen had far more power than Shale. It wasn’t a victory that Han Sen had pulled off by the skin of his teeth.

But Li Chun Qiu was confident that if he had more time to raise Shale to the peak of his power, he would have a chance to beat Han Sen.

But the Very High man had to admit that Han Sen was strong right now. In fact, the Crystallizer was stronger than he had imagined. He thought Han Sen was below Shale and Yu Shanxin, but now, Han Sen’s battle power was clearly no weaker than theirs. He was possibly stronger.

“Combat power doesn’t mean anything. The most important thing is the ability to become a true god. Shale is a fake eleven armor talent. There is a high chance he can become a true god. That will be the real victory.” Li Chun Qiu stared at Han Sen, then left the area with Shale.

“You became deified without informing us. How do you plan on paying us back for this?” Li Keer smiled at Han Sen as she spoke.

“I will do whatever you want me to,” Han Sen said while spreading his hands.

“I want you to stand facing a wall,” Li Keer said, acting angry.

“I’m a grown-up, not a three-year-old. Punish me another way,” Han Sen said with a wry smile. Only kids would be punished by having to face a wall.

“No, you have to face the wall. And you have to face the wall for a whole month,” Li Keer said with a smile.

Han Sen frowned in annoyance. He wanted to say something, but Exquisite interrupted, “Stop arguing. Little Sister said you should face a wall because after a silkworm becomes deified, they have to go to the ancient wall. That will be good for all of us.”

“I see.” Han Sen just realized Li Keer wasn’t really being petulant; she was just teasing him.

“But you have just become deified. You can go there in a few days. You should visit Bao’er and spend some time with her first. You won’t see her for a whole month while you’re at the ancient wall,” Exquisite said.

Han Sen nodded, and then Exquisite took him back to the Star Tree.

Because of what happened before, Li Keer and Exquisite no longer dared to leave Han Sen’s side. One of them always remained by Han Sen’s side in case something big happened. That made him super depressed. He didn’t have any free time anymore.

“I really can’t look like I’m too special. Otherwise, I won’t have any freedom at all,” Han Sen thought as he sat under the tree and drank a cup of tea.

Exquisite could see what he was thinking, but she ignored him and continued reading a book.

“What are you reading?” Han Sen asked, poking his head around next to her.

“Nothing.” Exquisite snapped the book closed before Han Sen could see what it was. She placed it in her pocket and cleared her throat self-consciously.

“What is this Ancient Wall placed that I’m going to?” Although Han Sen was curious about what Exquisite was reading, if she wasn’t going to tell him, then he wasn’t going to keep asking.

Exquisite quietly said, “Ancient Wall is a place where one of my ancestors used to draw.”

“Draw?” Han Sen was surprised.

Seeing Han Sen’s surprise, Exquisite smiled and explained, “It isn’t an ordinary drawing. He was a famous genius of our race. Although he never became a leader, he studied the Very High Sense to a degree that no one else—aside from our alpha—has ever been able to match.”

After pausing, Exquisite looked up at the Star Fruit above them and said, “Before he entered the Geno Hall, that elder sat before the Ancient Wall for two years. Two years later, when he opened his eyes, the first thing he did was draw a picture on the wall. After he drew it, he flew away and went to the Geno Hall. The drawing has been there ever since. It is a legend, and not even now can people understand what that drawing is about.”
