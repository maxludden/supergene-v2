Yes, he was sticking in it. Han Sen quickly realized that his body had a problem. He used the Dongxuan Aura to scan his body. He was very shocked and jumped.

Han Sen was no stranger to the location he was in. There were weapons in every direction. The endless weapons forest suggested that this was the first sky of the 33 skies. It was Soldier Weapon Sky, which was also sometimes called Soldier Knife Sky. Han Sen had killed Weapon God there and retrieved Weapon God’s God Spirit. This was also the place where he had taken out the Inch Grey Sword.

When Han Sen went there this time, the place was vastly different from how it was before. His body had become a weapon, and he was stuck in the weapon forest.

Han Sen tried to use his body to take a human body again, but it was useless despite all the different types of powers he tried to use. Even the Super God Spirit mode could not make his body normal again.

Han Sen had to inspect himself. He had become a weapon, but he could still use his powers. It was just that his body was different.

Under the Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen’s face was in his head.

The blade was like a pitch-black quadrangle. Even the handle was black. To look at it from afar, it was like a burnt stick on the ground. Compared with the colorful and cold-looking weapon, he did not look particularly outstanding.

“Why did I become a jian?” Han Sen felt very weird about this.

A weapon like a jian was not something many humans used. Han Sen had used a jian before, but he was just using it casually. He had never taken the time to practice exclusive jian skills.

He was best with three different types of weapons, which were a bow, knives, and swords. Yet, he had not turned into one of those three weapons. On top of that, he was a jian that did not look particularly outstanding.

“It looks like after the 33 skies returned to origin, it has shown its true power. Even when I came in, my power was restricted by Soldier Weapon Sky. I have become a jian. As for the other creatures that came in, there is an 80% to 90% chance that they became a weapon too.”

Han Sen was thinking while he gathered up power. He wanted his body to leave the stone. Even if he was a jian, if he wanted to fly, it should not have been too hard to do that.

When Han Sen gathered up his Dongxuan Sutra power, he used its control power. Even so, he could not get his jian to fly out of the stone. Furthermore, he was still not moving.

Han Sen did not believe it. He used thee Dongxuan Sutra power. He used the Dongxuan Aura control power. Not to mention the fact that it was a four-foot-long jian, but even a star-class battleship or a planet should have been something the Dongxuan Aura could move at the speed of light.

No matter how hard he tried, the jian was shaking like mad. It made some blade-type sounds. He could not pull it out of the rock by a single inch.

A voice sounded in Han Sen’s head. “Stop wasting your energy. You are a weapon because of Soldier Weapon Sky’s rule power. Unless you have the power to flip the 33 skies, you will be unable to break the Soldier Weapon Sky’s rules and get yourself free.”

Han Sen was shocked. He used the Dongxuan Aura to search, but there were no other creatures around.

That voice was in Han Sen’s head again. “I am right next to you. Do you not see me? What a stupid man.”

“Are you a weapon too?” Han Sen asked. He used the Dongxuan Aura to scan. He quickly discovered something weird. There was a sword within nine feet of the stone.

Only one inch of the blade was showing, but the handle could be fully seen. The rest of the blade was in the stone. From the part that was showing, it could be determined that it was a very old copper sword. There was a red string for adornment at the end of the handle.

The sword was purple and red. It looked as if it had been made from purple copper. It looked very pretty, but it did not make it look less scary. Han Sen did not know much about swords, but he could tell it was a great sword. He could tell it might have even been a famous sword.

The sword string on the purple copper sword was waving in the wind. It looked very light.

Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to check the purple copper sword out. He noticed that the purple copper sword’s body was releasing a weird mind. It should have been that purple copper sword communicating with Han Sen.

“People who end up in Soldier Weapon Sky all become weapons, including God Spirits,” the purple copper sword said. “Unless someone comes to pull us out, we will be a weapon discarded on the floor for all time.”

“If creatures that come to Soldier Weapon Sky become a weapon, then who can come here to pull us out?” Han Sen asked with a wry smile.

The purple copper sword coldly said, “How ignorant. Outsiders will become weapons. There are native creatures in Soldier Weapon Sky.”

“Are there?” Han Sen was shocked. When he came to Soldier Weapon Sky before, he never saw any native creatures. Aside from the soldier weapon gene race, there were no other native creatures.

Now, he had become a member of the soldier weapon gene race. He could not think about there being some natives there.

“Of course, there are.” The purple copper sword looked disdained and said, “What an ignorant and stupid person. The 33 skies are a bridge between two worlds. It can get the main and reverse universe’s life forces. There is a lot of life here. It is better than the main and reverse universe. How could there not be any native creatures?”

Han Sen thought that when the 33 skies returned to their origin, it was totally normal for there to be new life. So, the purple copper sword was right.

“You are very smart and have a lot of knowledge. You must be someone special. What is your name?” Han Sen wanted to find out more about the purple copper sword.

The purple copper sword proudly said, “I am an invincible person who fights in the sky, on the ground, and in the main and reverse universes. My name is Old Man Sky King. You can call me Sky King or Old Man.”

“OK.” Han Sen knew the purple copper sword was not talking nonsense. If he was a famous person from the two universes, even if he had never seen him, he would have heard about him. There was no Old Man Sky King. That purple copper sword was obviously there for benefits.

The purple copper sword noticed that Han Sen was not speaking. Therefore, he asked, “Young man, who are you?”

“I am just a nobody,” Han Sen said. “I have not done anything of renown. I have only killed a few God Spirits and few Break World beasts to eat. When I am tired, the God Chaos Party’s vice president tends to massage my shoulders.”

“Whatever you say.” The purple copper sword looked disdained. He thought Han Sen was talking nonsense like him and not speaking the truth.
