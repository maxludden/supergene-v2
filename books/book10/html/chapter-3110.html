<p>Steel Scene’s body frame was ruined. He looked as if he had been
stabbed in the heart. His eyes opened wide as he stared at Han Sen
and Ice Snow Goddess in the god temple.</p>
<p>God Spirits were very holy. Everyone in the entire kingdom
worshipped them. Even Ice Snow Goddess had a contract that treated
the family as a partner. The Steel family never once thought about
showing an ounce of disrespect to Ice Snow Goddess. They treated
her like a god. They treated her like a protector of the Steel
family. Now, the Steel family’s protector, Ice Snow Goddess, was
bowing before Han Sen. It was like someone lower in status meeting
someone higher than them. The deity even referred to him as a
mister. This made Steel Scene unable to believe it was actually
happening.</p>
<p>“Oh god! What kind of monster have I become entangled with?”
Steel Scene suddenly felt the sky spin. He started to lose his
footing and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The Steel Manor’s guards and workers were outside the god
temple. They saw that it was covered in ice lights and snow air.
They were unable to get close and see what was happening
inside.</p>
<p>A god-class gene race subordinate was gathering power. He wanted
to get into the ice lights and snow air, but he almost turned into
an ice cube. He backed away. The hand that touched the ice lights
and snow air first already had no feeling.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. They did not dare to touch the ice lights
and snow air. They surrounded the god temple.</p>
<p>In the Ice Snow God Temple, Steel Scene’s body shook. His eyes
were full of blood. He looked at Han Sen with the utmost shock. He
tremendously feared death.</p>
<p>“Impossible! Ice Snow Goddess is the guardian of the Steel
family. I have the ice snow Blood-Pulse. She will not abandon me.
Impossible…” Han Sen did not waste time looking at Steel Scene. He
only looked at Ice Snow Goddess and asked, “Is he your man?”</p>
<p>Ice Snow Goddess had not been there earlier, but she easily
guessed what had been happening. She coldly said, “I had a contract
with the ancestors of the Steel family, so the Steel family has my
God Spirit Blood-Pulse.” Han Sen looked at Ice Snow Goddess as he
said, “This man wants to kill me. If he is yours, what will you
do?”</p>
<p>Steel Scene was frightened. He screamed, “You are the guardian
of the Steel family! You must save me…”</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, humans used the powers of God
Spirits and gene races to get by. They did not really care about
the power of their own bodies. Although Steel Scene was at a very
high level, and he had a lot of fame, he was still afraid of death.
He was superior to many others. He had many wives, and he was
tremendously rich. He was not ready to die.</p>
<p>Ice Snow Goddess’s words sent Steel Scene into an endless
hell.</p>
<p>The Ice Snow Goddess looked at Steel Scene. She sighed and said,
“You have offended a person not even God would dare offend. How
could I hope to save you?”</p>
<p>Steel Scene suddenly felt as if he was inside an ice cave. The
blood drained from his face.</p>
<p>After all, he was a person who had held a high position for a
long time. He was a general who led an army. Now, he was utterly
hopeless. He decided to use all the power he had.</p>
<p>Steel Scene suddenly noticed his ice snow God Spirit Blood-Pulse
was gone. Obviously, Ice Snow Goddess had disabled the God Spirit
Blood-Pulse power she had once given him. It had been taken
away.</p>
<p>Steel Scene felt very sad, but he still looked murderous.
Although he had no ice snow God Spirit power, he had the si ming
demon Blood-Pulse from a land pulse. Although it was not a complete
God Spirit Blood-Pulse, it was still stronger than the God Spirit
Blood-Pulses that were usually given out by temples.</p>
<p>Now, Steel Scene only wanted to live. He cast his si God Spirit
Blood-Pulse at max capacity. Black air surrounded him. He was like
an evil ghost headed outside of the Ice Snow God Temple. His heart
was filled with hatred, but he did not dare fight against Han Sen.
He was too scary. Even God Spirits avoided inciting his ire. He
would not dare to fight him again.</p>
<p>Steel Scene only wanted to escape the Ice Snow God Temple and
run to Jade Wall City. That seemed the only way he would be allowed
to keep his life.</p>
<p>Before Steel Scene escaped the Ice Snow God Temple, he heard Ice
Snow Goddess say, “Mister, for Little God’s sake, keep his body
whole.”</p>
<p>In Ice Snow City, the king’s guard had people rush over to the
temple. They had brought Steel family members to the Ice Snow God
Temple. Seeing the Ice Snow God Temple was covered by ice lights
and snow air, the general of the phoenix guard, Liu Xian Xian,
looked at Steel Scene’s cousin, Steel Ying Tang, and asked, “Mister
Ying Tang, what happened here?”</p>
<p>Steel Ying Tang hoped Steel Scene died inside the Ice Snow God
Temple so he could take over the Steel family and become its new
leader, but he pretended to be angry and said, “An assassin invaded
the Steel Manor in the hopes of slaying my cousin. Now, they are
trapped inside Ice Snow God Temple. I do not know what is going on
inside.”</p>
<p>Liu Xian Xian and the other generals all swapped looks of
concern. They were shocked. In daylight, someone had tried to
assassinate a general of the Qin Kingdom. That was far too
bold.</p>
<p>The Ice Snow God Temple was covered by an ice snow god power.
They could not enter the place. Liu Xian Xian had to question them
about the situation and offer words of comfort, such as, “Mister
Scene has an ice snow God Spirit Blood-Pulse. When he entered the
god temple, he probably combined with Ice Snow Goddess. It does not
matter how strong that assassin is. It is unlikely he will be able
to hurt him. Don’t panic. Protect the god temple and do now allow
the assassin to escape.”</p>
<p>After that, Liu Xian Xian asked, “Do you know who the assassin
is?”</p>
<p>Liu Xian Xian did not expect anyone to answer. If there was an
assassin, revealing himself would not have been a very smart
move.</p>
<p>“It is Han Sen,” an old servant madly said. “It is the one who
lives with Feng Fei Fei. He killed Mister Scene, Gong Shu Zhi, Si
Tu Ya, and General Lu.”</p>
<p>Liu Xian Xian and the others were shocked. When they heard the
answer, they donned strange expressions. No one expected someone
would go to Steel Manor and kill without remorse.</p>
<p>They knew Han Sen’s name. Lu San Zhi was hit in the face by the
crown prince because of him. He had been made into a joke in Jade
Wall City. How could they have not known about him?</p>
<p>They could have thought about all of this until their brains
short-circuited, but they never would have imagined that Han Sen
had the audacity to go to Steel Manor and kill Lu San Zhi and Gong
Shu Zhi.</p>
<p>Liu Xian Xian was about to ask something when he suddenly saw
the ice lights and snow air around Ice Snow God Temple shift. It
returned to crystal and jade.</p>
<p>Everyone around instinctively peered into the Ice Snow God
Temple. Their hearts went dim. They were all shocked. Steel Scene
was kneeling before Ice Snow God Temple. He was bleeding. His body
was red like a cooked shrimp. He had no more life force.</p>
<p>Someone put his hand near Steel Scene’s nose and screamed,
“Mister Scene… Mister Scene… He is dead…”</p>
<p>“Han Sen… Where is Han Sen?” Liu Xian Xian and the others were
as much shocked as they were afraid. Even after thinking about the
key to this whole incident, they still took people into the Ice
Snow God Temple. The most unbelievable part was that once they were
inside Ice Snow God Temple, aside from Steel Scene’s body, there
was not a single shadow. The assassin, Han Sen, who the Steel
family claimed had just walked in to murder everyone, had vanished.
There was no sign of him.</p>
