<h2>Analysis Result</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2573</h3>

<p>Han Sen searched for a few more days, but he didn’t find any
goodies. However, in that time, Han Sen’s Crystal Furnace reached
beginner level. After all, it was a geno art for crystallizer
children. It wasn’t very difficult to come to grips with. And
having crystal blood made it even easier to learn.</p>
<p>Humans were the offspring of crystallizers, so crystallizer geno
arts were quite compatible with human physiology. It only took Han
Sen a few days to learn the geno art, and he produced some good
results to boot. Now, Han Sen was able to eat twenty to thirty King
xenogeneic genes a day. And that was just at the beginner level of
Crystal Furnace. If Consume, Big Destroyed, and Crystal Furnace all
reached peak performance, he calculated that he could eat at least
110 xenogeneic genes a day.</p>
<p>“Crystal Furnace isn’t bad. I need to teach it to Bao’er and
Ling’er, too.” When Han Sen thought about his baby daughters, it
felt as if he took an arrow to the heart.</p>
<p>But escaping the fortress wouldn’t be easy. In the past, he
would have tried to escape using his super god body. Because Wan’er
was in his Destiny’s Tower, however, he couldn’t use his super god
body for very long. Making his escape would take longer than he
could maintain his invincible form.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat down and rested. He brought out one of his Alliance
beverages and had a couple of sips. But after he did, the little
Crocodile God ran over to him and stared at the bottle of wine. It
seemed very curious.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised an eyebrow. He pulled out a cup and poured some
wine for the small Crocodile God.</p>
<p>This time, the little crocodile didn’t smack the cup away with
its tail. It rolled out its tongue and tentatively approached the
cup.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so happy. At first he thought that the little
crocodile enjoyed drinking, but instead, the Crocodile God used its
tongue to lift the cup and splash itself with the contents.</p>
<p>Its scales were very high in temperature. The creature had tried
to lower the heat of its scales, but when the wine touched its
body, the liquid flashed into steam.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God looked unsatisfied. So, it used its
tongue to snatch the entire bottle of wine this time. It upended
the bottle over itself.</p>
<p>As he watched the wonderful wine boil away, Han Sen’s heart
ached. It was a bottle of the wine that Ji Yanran had prepared for
him. It was a century-old, and it could no longer be purchased
anywhere. It was a very rare item.</p>
<p>But the small Crocodile God seemed to really enjoy it, and its
body reeked of alcohol.</p>
<p>The little Crocodile God made an inquisitive rumbling noise as
Han Sen mourned the loss of his wine. It turned out that the
crocodile wanted more.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any more wine. If you want, I can go back and get
you some more,” Han Sen offered to the small Crocodile God.</p>
<p>The little creature nodded and gave a low roar, as if it was
hurrying Han Sen to go and fetch the wine.</p>
<p>“You will let me go back? If that’s true, then I will leave.”
Han Sen didn’t really believe that the creature would let him go so
easily.</p>
<p>If people left the core area, they would return to the same spot
that they had left. Unless they never entered the core area again,
they’d be trapped.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was different. Because he had four self-cogwheels,
he could show up in four different locations. He didn’t need to
return to this location. If he could leave, he would be set
free.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God hurried him to leave and bring back
wine. So, Han Sen generated the power to open the door to the core
hall. He said to the small Crocodile God, “I really am going.”</p>
<p>The core hall’s door was open, and the small Crocodile God made
no effort to stop him. And neither did the big Crocodile God. For
all intents and purposes, he had permission to leave.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so happy. He hadn’t thought that he would ever be
able to leave that place so easily. So, he quickly hurried through
the hall’s door.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God made no effort to stop him, and so Han
Sen successfully managed to leave the core area. He returned to the
safety of the white whale. His exit was so smooth that he could
barely believe it.</p>
<p>“Dad, you were gone for so long. Next time you go on such a long
trip, can you take me with you?” Bao’er jumped into Han Sen’s
arms.</p>
<p>“You can’t go to that place.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t take people or creatures there, and even if he
could, he wouldn’t dare do it.</p>
<p>If a child entered the core area, they would have to be King
class. And that meant people, upon seeing a small child enter,
would go crazy.</p>
<p>Seeing Bao’er’s smile, Han Sen’s heart felt warm. He used
Glasses to analyze Bao’er’s genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t want to find out how much potential Bao’er had.
He wanted to know what Bao’er’s race was. Bao’er’s race had always
been a mystery, so maybe the glasses could help to resolve it once
and for all.</p>
<p>The data scan of the glasses kept scrolling. A while went by,
and the analysis cycled on and on. It gave Han Sen a bad
feeling.</p>
<p>“Lack of data… Cannot analyze… Cannot analyze…” When Han Sen
heard those words, he was disappointed.</p>
<p>But no matter what race Bao’er was, Han Sen didn’t care. As far
as he was concerned, she was his genuine daughter.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to let Glasses stop, but then he heard a
voice. “Analysis complete. The genes are unstable. Gene level
cannot be confirmed. Gene potential cannot be confirmed. You are
her parent.”</p>
<p>“Shit! This thing really is for kids. It isn’t reliable,” Han
Sen thought in annoyance. After half a day of waiting, that was the
result he got.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Glasses to look at everyone on the white whale.
Aside from Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng, who came from the
sanctuaries, the others were analyzed in great detail and with an
impressive amount of accuracy.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng had the same results as Han Sen.
Their genes were unstable, and they couldn’t be analyzed.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried using Glasses to analyze the little red bird. He
didn’t have much hope for success, but he was presented with
something interesting.</p>
<p>Target: Phoenix (51%) and Fish-bird (49%) female</p>
<p>Gene class: Original Deified</p>
<p>Gene potential: 10 stars</p>
<p>There were many detailed pieces of information being analyzed,
and it all shocked Han Sen. He hadn’t expected the little red
bird’s blood to be that powerful. Its 10-star gene potential
practically guaranteed that it would become a true god.</p>
<p>“His gene blood is that strong?” Han Sen curiously asked
Glasses.</p>
<p>Glasses answered, “Phoenixes and fish-birds are true gods. It
has the blood of both, and while its growth speed might be slow,
there is a high chance it can become a true god. Its chances of
failure are practically zero, but it will require a lot of
materials to become a true god. It has a higher chance than a
creature that is born purely a phoenix or a fish-bird.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen heard this, he closed his eyes in exhaustion for a
long moment. He had been growing the little red bird all this time,
and upon hearing this, he now knew he would have to gather a lot
more resources for the bird in the future.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the others in the white whale and assumed that
the information on them was accurate. Then, he looked at Wan’er who
was asleep in Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>Glasses had to run longer for her than it did for the little red
bird, but only one word was presented as a result: Sacred.</p>
<p>There was nothing more than that. It analyzed the race, but the
only result was a name. There were no details or other content.</p>
