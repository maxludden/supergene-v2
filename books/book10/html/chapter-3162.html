<h2>God of Wealth Blood-Pulse</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3162</h3>

<p>He knew it was just an illusion and a weird scene. Still, seeing
the money tree with lots of coins hanging from its boughs and
feeling the aura of the gold money tree and a sky full of stars
made him open his eyes wide.</p>
<p>The coins on the money tree fell off. They were going straight
for Feng Yin Yin. They melted into her body. Her body was given a
God Spirit mark that resembled a coin. It immediately started to
shine. Its voluminosity grew brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>The tree full of coins fell. It all melted into Feng Yin Yin’s
body. At the same time, the Sky God Crown received a wonderful
message.</p>
<p>Spirit Strength: Ten star</p>
<p>Gene potential: Ten star</p>
<p>Compatibility: Nine star</p>
<p>Overall: S-class Blood-Pulse inheritor</p>
<p>“Do the God Spirits use this to decide who to give their Blood –
Pulses to?” At the same time, Han Sen received even more messages
from the Sky God Crown.</p>
<p>There were options for giving the person’s Blood-Pulse. There
were four choices: one corner, broken, perfect, and inheritor.</p>
<p>One corner meant one God Spirit Blood-Pulse would be given at
random. It was the lowest level a God Spirit Blood-Pulse could
impart. It gave a person a small God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It did not
do much. It just made people a beginner-level gene caster.</p>
<p>Broken God Spirit Blood – Pulses were better. Some features of
the God Spirits were there, but they were not complete. They were
not strong either.</p>
<p>There was no need to explain things about perfect. It basically
meant giving a person a perfect God Spirit Blood-Pulse and creating
a contract. When the person needed it, they could call upon the God
Spirit’s contract to combine and fight with their aid.</p>
<p>God Spirits were able to use their inherited Blood-Pulse. It
gave them extra power to fight.</p>
<p>Of course, God Spirits gave humans these benefits to make humans
grow. When humans had a contract with a gene race, God Spirits
would take some of that power for themselves. It was mutually
beneficial, as it helped humans grow. When humans gained a gene
race, God Spirits were able to take some of that power. The
stronger the gene race was, the more power they were able to take
for themselves.</p>
<p>The power taken away was used to make a god base.</p>
<p>When God Spirits gave humans a Blood Pulse, it also meant
risking the chance of causing damage to themselves. If the human
selected was not very good, a God Spirit would not dare give them a
perfect Blood-Pulse. It would not give out an inheritor
Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin was quite excellent. Although she was not a perfect
match, an S-rank ranking made her worthy of an inheritor
Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>Regardless of how poor Feng Yin Yin’s review might have been,
Han Sen would have still given her an inheritor Blood – Pulse. In
his eyes, Feng Yin Yin was perfect enough.</p>
<p>“In the name of God of Wealth, I give you my Blood-Pulse. Feng
Yin Yin, do you want to be my inheritor?” Han Sen’s hands touched
Feng Yin Yin’s forehead. The Sky God Crown shone with a god light.
It put Feng Yin Yin inside the god light.</p>
<p>“I am willing,” Feng Yin Yin seriously answered.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Sky God Crown’s gold god light was like a spring of water. It
gushed down onto the coin mark on her mark forehead. A weird
connection formed between them.</p>
<p>After the inheritor ritual was performed, Han Sen felt the Sky
God Crown power lessen. The whole of the God of Wealth Temple’s
light started to dim. If God of Wealth Temple did not have
Decapitation Queen guarding it, it would have become a Disaster God
Spirit. The God of Wealth Temple was not able to suppress it.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “I don’t know when the power of the Sky God
Crown will be restored. Inheritor Blood-Pulses cannot be given out
like candy.”</p>
<p>“San Mu, you really are a God Spirit!” Feng Yin Yin knew Han Sen
was the God of Wealth, but her attitude did not change. She
joyfully smiled and looked extremely excited.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Feng Fei Fei, “This is our secret. Don’t tell
anyone, and that includes your Auntie.” He did not want people
looking at him like he was a monster.</p>
<p>“This will be a secret between you and me,” Feng Yin Yin said as
she blinked her eyes. “Now, we wait for Feng Yin Yin to get a gene
race. After that, I will start reaping my benefits.” Han Sen was
very hopeful, but he did not know how many gene races Feng Yin Yin
could earn before giving him the necessary power to make a god
base.</p>
<p>ieces</p>
<p>After thinking it over, Han Sen decided to bring out a
king-class gene egg to give to Feng Yin Yin. He smiled and said,
“Try this out. Can you use your God of Wealth Blood-Pulse to hatch
it?”</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin did not mind trying. She accepted the gene egg and
used the God of Wealth Blood-Pulse to try and tame it. An
Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse was very good. The king-class
gene egg was absorbed into the God Spirit mark. It quickly
hatched.</p>
<p>At the same time, Han Sen felt a weird power come from the God
Spirit mark. It went into the Sky God Crown.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt disappointed. While wearing the Sky God Crown, that
power was like pouring a glass of water into a swimming pool. It
did not do much. To create a god base, he needed a lot more power
than that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if a gene race evolved in Feng Yin Yin’s God Spirit
mark in the future, Han Sen could take some of that power. The
greater the power of the gene race was, the more power he would
receive in return.</p>
<p>Now, it was just hatching. It was understandable that the power
gained was low.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder why God Spirits favor many members. If it was
just one member, who knows how long it could ever take to form
another god base?” Han Sen ransacked his mind for solutions on how
to bring more members to his god temple.</p>
<p>After thinking it over, killing the God Chaos Party’s members
could earn him a god base with each kill. That was a more direct
way to his woes than slaving away to recruit members.</p>
<p>“I wonder where Rocky Dee’s god temple is.” Han Sen wanted to
kill Rocky Dee, but he was unable to locate him. He could not even
find his god temple.</p>
<p>He took Feng Yin Yin and Bao’er back to Feng castle. Feng Fei
Fei was already back, and she had been looking for them.</p>
<p>When Feng Fei Fei saw them in the garden, she asked with
confusion, “Where have you guys been? I’ve been looking all over
for you.”</p>
<p>She had already asked the maids in the castle, and no one had
seen them around. They were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“Little Auntie, why are you looking for us?” Feng Yin Yin tried
to change the subject.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei’s mood was fine. She did not ask any more about her
last question. She pulled Feng Yin Yin’s hand and said, “Little
Yin, I spoke to God Speak King. He has allowed you to pray before
the Prophet God for a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. You should ready
yourself. We are going to Prophet God Temple tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin looked a little irritated as she said, “Auntie,
there is no need. I have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse now.”</p>
<p>“What?” Feng Fei Fei was frozen. She looked to be in a state of
disbelief. “How could you have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse?”</p>
<p>With mustered courage, Feng Yin Yin said, “Auntie, I asked San
Mu to take me to God of Wealth Temple. I received the God of Wealth
Blood-Pulse from the God of Wealth Temple.”</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei was shocked. Her face kept morphing into different
expressions. No words could describe how she felt.</p>
<p>She had put so much effort into this happening. The amount of
effort she had put in, the favors she owed, and the strings she had
pulled to earn this opportunity for Feng Yin Yin were
unquantifiable. One sentence from Feng Yin Yin threw it all
away.</p>
