<p>When Old Cat vanished into the red light, Han Sen felt a surge of familiar power. It was the same as the power that rose when he used the new abilities of his blood.</p>

<p>Now Han Sen knew that the strange power he had detected was the path to leave the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not know if it was because he practiced Blood-Pulse Sutra or if it was because he had absorbed the Nine-Life Cat tattoo, but it now looked as if he could leave the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not have time to deal with the shura right now. They weren’t a problem for the time being, and with Little Angel, Golden Growler, Gu Qingcheng, and Xie Qing King, they could get handle the shura while he was gone.</p>

<p>Han Sen was worried about Littleflower. He didn’t think Old Cat would kill him, but he didn’t know anything for certain. He didn’t feel safe, knowing he couldn’t keep an eye on the boy.</p>

<p>Han Sen packed and said goodbye to Ji Yanran. He found a safe place where he could try to use the strange power to follow Old Cat.</p>

<p>After he ran the Blood-Pulse Sutra, his blood started to melt. He could feel the power whirl in the air.</p>

<p>He didn’t want to take any risks, so Han Sen waited for all of his blood to melt before doing anything.</p>

<p>Before he moved, though, a power landed on him. Han Sen felt as if he was inside a teleporter. Things in his vision swiftly changed, but the scene that appeared before him was familiar. It was a bathroom he had ducked into just before Zero pulled him back to the Alliance.</p>

<p>The toilet was the same, but he could see one more thing that was different</p>

<p>There was a person standing before him. It was a Kate woman. Her pants were around her ankles, and her snow-white butt and cat tail were showing. The woman pulled her pants up and looked in the mirror. She froze when she saw another person there, and then she took a breath to scream.</p>

<p>Han Sen jumped over and covered her mouth, saying, “Don’t scream. It’s me, Han Sen.”</p>

<p>The woman wasn’t some random person; it was the police officer Lan Se.</p>

<p>Qiao had a mess on her hands after Han Sen left. Wizard depended entirely on Han Sen now, so it drove her nuts to learn that he had disappeared.</p>

<p>She would have thought Han Sen was some trick or ploy of Black Gold Group, but the fact that he hadn’t yet shown up at Black Gold Group was the only thing that stopped her and Lan Se from believing that</p>

<p>They had been looking for Han Sen for a while, and Lan Se had yet to give up. She had found out someone similar to Han Sen had gone into this bathroom and disappeared.</p>

<p>That was why Lan Se was here, hoping to follow up a lead.</p>

<p>When she wasn’t able to find anything at first, she decided to have a wee. Before she could pull up her pants, though, a man appeared right behind her.</p>

<p>She saw that it was Han Sen, but she still couldn’t help but scream.</p>

<p>Now that Han Sen was holding her mouth, she couldn’t speak. But after a bit, she calmed down and gently pulled his hand away.</p>

<p>“If I let you go, will you stop screaming? I didn’t mean to appear here. I didn’t think it was occupied, so…” Han Sen said, letting his hands go.</p>

<p>Lan Se looked at Han Sen and then kneed him in the balls.</p>

<p>Han Sen would have been able to evade the strike, but if he did, Lan Se wouldn’t have had a way to release her anger. So, he decided not to dodge and just let himself get hit.</p>

<p>But after Han Sen evolved, his body had become stronger. The hit didn’t affect him, so he pretended to fall into pain by spinning away.</p>

<p>Lan Sen buttoned her pants, rolled her eyes, and said, “Stop pretending! Where were you? You know Qiao was worried, thinking something might have happened to you.”</p>

<p>“Something did happen, and I had to go and sort it out I am sorry. I will head back now.” Han Sen walked outside.</p>

<p>Lan Se grabbed his arm and rolled her eyes again. “I will take you with me. In case you disappear again.”</p>

<p>Han Sen did not resist He sat inside Lan Se_s car and went home with her.</p>

<p>“That power took me out of the sanctuary, but why here? Where did Old Cat go with Littleflower?” Han Sen thought worriedly.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not know where Old Cat had gone to, and he couldn’t think of any reason that the cat would come here.</p>

<p>Lan Se brought Han Sen back to Qiao. He couldn’t explain where he had gone to, so he had to make up some nonsense for a cover story. There was nothing they could do about Han Sen’s lie, though. But at least he was back now, and that brought them some relief.</p>

<p>It was already nighttime, so Qiao let Han Sen rest. She had learned something regarding a xenogeneic, and she planned on hunting it down tomorrow with Han Sen now back with them.</p>

<p>Han Sen went back to his room and used the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He thought he could feel the power, and he wanted to see if he could return to the sanctuary on a whim. He remembered Old Cat had been unable to; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been trapped there. He was still teleported away, though.</p>

<p>As Han Sen’s blood melted, the power in the air became stronger. It was just how things were in the sanctuary. Han Sen summoned the power in the air, and before long, he found himself back in the sanctuary, where he had been.</p>

<p>“It works! That means I can travel between the outside and the sanctuary whenever.” Han Sen was glad about this.</p>

<p>But it wouldn’t help Han Sen find Littleflower. He didn’t know where his son was.</p>

<p>Han Sen couldn’t find Littleflower in the sanctuaries, so he used his powers to teleport back to the outside.</p>

<p>As the red light surrounded him, though, Bao’er appeared out of nowhere and jumped towards Han Sen. Han Sen couldn’t stop the teleportation process, and the power pulled him back out of the Alliance.</p>

<p>Han Sen appeared in Qiao’s room with a baby in his arms. He checked Bao’er out, and she wasn’t injured or anything.</p>

<p>“This power can bring others, too? That’s very good,” Han Sen thought, considering how he might use the powers in the future.</p>

<p>Humans wanted to leave the Big Silence system, but they had found it impossible. With Han Sen’s new ability, the risk no longer existed.</p>
