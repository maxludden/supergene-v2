<h3>Chapter 1799</h3>

<p>Yisha hated Han Sen. Her power was amassing, building in
strength. The purple flame broke through the enforced limit of
Demon Grave. The power in her body was increasing.</p>
<p>But breaking through the power limit did not mean the
suppression of Demon Grave was ineffective. Yisha’s power was too
strong, so she broke past a limit She was crossing a line that
allowed her to use a power that was not supposed to be in play
there. Only elites like Yisha, who were halfway to becoming a god,
had the power to do this. Not even an average King class could
accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>Because Yisha was only half-deified, she could not completely
ignore the supposed limitations of Demon Grave. Her dramatic flare
of power wasn’t actually as big of an improvement as it seemed.
Still, she could ignore enough of Demon Grave’s suppression to
raise her power to that of a Viscount.</p>
<p>Forcing her body to wield power like this was a definite strain.
Even if she didn’t fight, simply holding the power would damage
her.</p>
<p>If Han Sen hadn’t forced her hand, she would never have done
this. But she was a Sword Queen, and she couldn’t idly accept what
Han Sen was doing. So, she decided to kill him where he was,
regardless of what it cost her.</p>
<p>Yisha was afraid Han Sen would steal the scabbard. And that was
why she had been holding off, but now that it was inside the
statue, nothing would happen. If she killed Han Sen, she could take
the scabbard whenever she wanted. Now, without hesitation, she was
happily unleashing her power.</p>
<p>Although she could only raise the power of a Viscount, that was
enough. Yisha was holding her saw-knife. She didn’t swing it, but a
purple flame was crawling atop it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding his Steel Centaur Shield, ready to withstand
whatever attack came next. Suddenly, a sharp pain struck his arm.
His flesh was exploding.</p>
<p>The wound on his arm was coming undone. Within a second, his
entire arm was ripped open, revealing his white bones. The tear was
spreading across his entire body.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. If this continued, it would only take a few
seconds for his entire body to be torn apart.</p>
<p>“You thought the teeth’s power was that slow? That was only
because it was suppressed by Demon Grave. That was why it was so
weak earlier. How dare you make me mad! Today is the day you die.”
Yisha looked cold, as her purple flames increased.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s wounds were being ripped up faster as a purple mist
moved along his flesh and muscles. It was scary to see. “Fuck!
That’s nasty!” Han Sen shouted in his heart. He didn’t hesitate, as
a red light suddenly appeared. It came right out of his genes,
wrapping up his entire body.</p>
<p>Because the Dongxuan Armor had wrapped up Han Sen’s body, you
could not tell the differences below its surfaces. But inside his
armor, his body was changing. He began to look like he was made of
red metal. He was becoming transparent, and a powerful presence was
growing within him.</p>
<p>His super god body was activated. The tears in his arm stopped
spreading, and the wounds that were covered by a purple aura were
doused in white light. The purple air began to dissipate, and his
wounds were starting to heal.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his previously-suppressed body was no longer
limited. Power coursed through his body, rumbling like a river.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at the white light overwhelming Han Sen’s arm and
felt the scary presence he exuded. Her face changed and she said,
“You… you’ve touched the deified door?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not answer. He pulled out a gold bow and a white
bone arrow. The white light entered the arrow, activating a
slumbering power. The bone arrow shivered to life, and a white
light came out of it</p>
<p>“The Archangel Bone Arrow? How?!” Yisha was shocked. She was not
shocked about the presence of the arrow itself, even though it had
been made from the bones of a King Feather. It had King power.</p>
<p>Normally, an enemy of King class power was no concern for Yisha.
She wagered she could block it. But inside Demon Grave, she had
damaged her own body to achieve the power of a Viscount Yet the
Archangel Bone Arrow had the same power that it would on the
outside. It was not affected, so it was scary.</p>
<p>Retrieving the scabbard was no longer Yisha’s highest priority,
so she flew away from the statue and departed the lake.</p>
<p>An Archangel Bone Arrow with full power was not something she
could trifle with.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Han Sen moved his finger and fired the bone arrow. It reached
Yisha’s chest the instant it left the string. She couldn’t evade
that projectile.</p>
<p>Yisha was a deified elite. Even though her powers were
suppressed, her reaction was still quite fast. She lifted the saw
knife in front of her chest, and the bone arrow hit the blade.</p>
<p>The holy light raged with the intensity of a volcano. It
exploded against the knife when the arrow came into contact with
it. And a katcha noise quickly followed. The saw-knife that was
still a bit powerful in there, made of an unknown material,
suddenly broke. The bone arrow plunged into her chest and rocketed
out of her back. It went through another dozen grapevines before
its flight was halted.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Yisha coughed up blood: a huge hole had been blown through her
heart. She was not dead, though. She was still gathering up power.
She ran into the grapevines and disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to give chase, but his body was feeling weak. He
exited super god spirit mode, as he could only use it for a limited
time.</p>
<p>“What a scary woman! She didn’t die.” Han Sen sighed, giving up
on pursuing her.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around and looked at the forehead of the statue
and the scabbard within. He grabbed the part that was sticking out
slightly and tried yanking it out.</p>
<p>When Han Sen pulled on it, it refused to budge. After a few more
pulls, it still didn’t come free.</p>
