    <p>
      The Blackgod&#8217;s Shelter had had a change in ownership in the span of
      a single night. This was news that startled many.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Blackgod Shelter also changed its name, becoming the Goddess Shelter.
      The same also applied to the smaller branches of the Blackgod Shelter, so
      that they too adopted the new name of Goddess Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one was entirely sure what happened, and why everything had suddenly
      changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people wanted to confirm the rumors for themselves. If anyone knew an
      evolver from what was previously known as the Blackgod Shelter, they could
      quickly find the answers they sought.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, the name of Han Sen had spread to every corner of the ice fields
      during a single night.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;On the other side of Snow Mountain, Blackgod brought with him 300
      elite evolvers and six evolvers that had a fitness level of 100 to attack
      the Goddess Shelter. When it was all over, Han Sen had managed to
      decapitate Blackgod by single-handedly breaching the protection provided
      by his army. Then they took over each and every Blackgod Shelter
      overnight!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did you know that Han Sen is eight feet tall, and his waist is
      eight feet wide, too? He has the strength of a monster! Blackgod brought
      3000 elite evolvers with him, and they battled together for three days and
      three nights. And guess what? Han Sen didn&#8217;t even get a
      scratch.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you sure? I heard it was an army of 30,000 that set out to
      attack Han Sen. And he effortlessly killed 10,000 people, which turned the
      rivers red with blood. The corpses, when stacked together, formed an
      entirely new mountain; and that was after filling a canyon. When it was
      all over, everyone in the Blackgod army was killed, which led to the
      Blackgod Shelter surrendering.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you guys talking about? Han Sen is an extremely beautiful
      woman.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it! How can Han Sen be a woman? That&#8217;s
      a man&#8217;s name!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re missing something, either way. You see, there
      was a really touching story in the midst of everything. And it was all
      about me. Han Sen and I used to be neighbors, and not many people know
      about this, but back in the day&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      The legends that surrounded Han Sen, out on the ice fields, quickly
      spiralled into madness. But despite the constant additions to the tales
      that were told, one thing remained constant: Han Sen had been able to
      bring down the Blackgod Shelter in one night.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real warriors, like Li Xing Lun and Brother Philip, upon hearing the
      news, found it difficult to believe what had happened. It was more
      shocking for them to hear that than if Han Sen had managed to slay 30,000
      evolvers with a single slap.
    </p>

    <p>
      Killing people was easy but taking over territory was incredibly
      difficult. And to hear that Han Sen had managed to take over all the
      territory Blackgod previously owned was quite frightening.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason why Han Sen had been able to effortlessly take ownership of the
      Blackgod Shelter was the aid given to him by Tang Zhenliu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu used to say that if Han Sen managed to kill Blackgod, then he
      would be able to easily take over his power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had simply decided to try it. He had then asked Tang Zhenliu for
      assistance. If Tang Zhenliu was able to do it, then Han Sen would have no
      issue with claiming ownership of the Blackgod Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Tang Zhenliu could not do it, then he would at the very least resort to
      ransacking and taking what he could from the place. Without enough people
      to take over a shelter, it would be a demanding task, but looting the
      place could be fruitful.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, Tang Zhenliu really did manage to take care of the people who
      had previously supported Blackgod. They drew a line and allowed Han Sen to
      take complete ownership of the Blackgod Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun and Brother Philip were now on their way to the Blackgod
      Shelter, to confirm with their own eyes the news they remained skeptical
      about. The original possessors of the Blackgod Shelter were there,
      unharmed, now following the leadership of Han Sen. They may not have been
      harmed, but they looked dazed by what had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not plan on uniting the ice fields, for doing so would benefit
      him. After all, the people he had were not from his party, and he did not
      have enough of his own men to control all the shelters in the ice fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, what Han Sen wanted the most was to find a way to group up with Li
      Xing Lun and Brother Philip to attack the royal shelter, in an alliance
      composed of the three of them. It would be impossible for him to do it
      alone, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun and Brother Philip were relieved that Han Sen was not
      interested in becoming a self-imposed king of the ice fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking over the Blackgod Shelter had presented him with many benefits,
      however. Not only would he receive income from the Blackgod Shelter, he
      would even obtain the swathes of information and intelligence that the
      Blackgod Shelter held in its possession.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were many sacred-blood class creatures residing across the ice
      fields. Although the Blackgod Shelter could not eliminate them, their
      record-keeping housed a great deal of useful information on them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such information had cost many their blood, sweat and tears. It had cost
      the lives of many to collect. The effort taken by many generations to
      collect such intelligence was plain to see. It would have taken countless
      years for a sole person to collect and store such knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like the ice field is home to many sacred-blood creatures.
      It would also appear that we lack the sufficient resources for their
      elimination.&#8221; Han Sen browsed the scope of the information and
      decided to hunt a few to see whether he could capture a few more beast
      souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though he had learnt the Dual skill, he still required two
      sacred-blood beast soul swords. Otherwise, it would not matter how strong
      his skill was; it would have been impossible for him to battle the Twin
      Spirit and emerge victorious with mutant beast soul swords. His weapons
      paled in comparison to their lethal rapiers.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after Han Sen had studied the information for a little while longer,
      the sacred-blood creatures had him blurting out the impression he had
      formed of them. &#8220;Strong.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      That was to be expected, of course. If they had been easy to kill, then
      Blackgod would have slain them already. The ones that still drew breath
      did so, because they could not be killed. They had to be terrifically
      fierce and powerful foes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked left and right, surmising that each of them would prove a
      difficult catch. But before he went to fight one, he wanted to study and
      learn about as many as he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amidst the records detailing the sacred-blood creatures, Han Sen came
      across one that would yield him a sacred-blood beast soul sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a silver-eye ice snake king, and its group was huge. There were
      original, mutant and sacred-blood variants on offer, but the latter beast
      soul could provide a silver-eye ice snake sword beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen checked the information he had on the sword, his desire to kill
      the sacred-blood silver-eye ice snake king increased.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the silver-eye ice snake king lived out in the ice valleys. The
      landscape there was dangerous, and it would be difficult for him to bring
      an army over such a great and perilous distance. The group was huge, also,
      consisting of at least 10,000 of the snakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the powers of the snakes were substantial. They had silver scales that
      were icy - sacred-blood weaponry would have a difficult time piercing
      their flesh and inflicting damage. Their attacking power was fierce, as
      well, and their toxic teeth could bite through sacred-blood shields. And
      they could fly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the Blackgod Shelter&#8217;s history, attempts to slay the beasts
      had been recorded. Blackgod himself had tried once, but he and his people
      had failed. No matter what they tried, none were able to slay the
      silver-eye ice snake king.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was still considering how he might slay such a beast when he saw
      Zhu Ting. He was smiling at him, and then he came over, saying,
      &#8220;Leader, you still aren&#8217;t resting?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, why? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Han Sen smiled back at Zhu
      Ting. So far, he had been as honest as could be, and had done nothing in
      defiance of Han Sen. If this behaviour continued, then he was willing to
      keep him in the Goddess army.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have something for you, but I am not sure if you are
      interested.&#8221; Zhu Ting pulled out what he had, and carefully showed
      it to Han Sen.
