"Little Kid, do you want to be like him, taking whatever you want and tricking whoever you want?" Bai King walked before Han Sen and suddenly reached out his hand. He patted Han Sen on the head, smiled, and pointed at Bai Wanjie.

Han Sen was frozen as he looked at Bai King. He did not know what he was talking about.

"If you follow me, you can bully people without remorse," Bai King said as he led Han Sen out. "No one will ever dream of bullying you either. Only you can trick people. No one will trick you." All the Extreme King elites had strange looks on their faces. They had no idea what Bai King was thinking.

The king's heart was never be something they could accurately gauge. Besides, this was a king that had almost conquered the entire universe. No one dared to say anything. They only looked at Bai King holding Han Sen by the hand, walking him out of Law Hall.

Han Sen was also surprised. This change had come too fast. Bai King's thoughts were surprisingly different from what was expected. It made Han Sen unable to act.

Han Sen thought he was going to die, but he didn't die. Instead, Bai King brought him into a palace. The pretty women there healed his wounds, and he had waiters bring him nice clothes. He was allowed any meal he fancied. It made Han Sen feel as if he was dreaming. He had never received this kind of treatment before, so it did not seem real.

In such a big palace, aside from Bai King, there were women everywhere. Han Sen was the second male in that place.

"It is no wonder why the legends claim Bai King is a very horny tyrant. It is making sense to me now. Let's not say anything else but seeing the number of children he has and the infinite number of pretty women in his palace, it is fairly obvious he is a horny man." Han Sen was comfortably lying on a chair. A woman from the Feather race was next to him. She was slicing up fruit and putting it in his mouth. He took a bite of the fruit. It tasted amazing. It felt warm inside his body. It was as if he was eating live fruit. All of his pores were so comfortable that they groaned in pleasure.

As he gorged on the stuff, Han Sen thought, Even the food I eat is ordinary, high-class xenogeneic fruit. A random one can bring a Baron up to a Viscount. They are so rich.

He stayed there for 15 days. If he said he wanted something, he got it. No one watched him either. If he wanted to, he could visit any corner of the palace as he pleased.

Throughout his time there, he did not see Bai King. It was like Bai King had brought him there and just forgot about him.

While he was thinking, Bai King, who was wearing green clothes entered the garden. He smiled at Han Sen and asked, "Have you gotten used to living here? If there is something you do not like about the place, all you must do is tell me."

"Mister Bai King, you should just tell me it straight. What is that you want?" Han Sen was not going to be bought out with fancy stuff. He knew Bai King was not treating him like this because of the goodness of his heart. He knew he must have had a plan.

Bai King waved his hand. The servants and women officers all left the garden. Bai King sat on a stone chair next to Han Sen. He poured himself some tea, had a sip, and said, "I have no choice. You combined with my Extreme King's Overbearing Eye. Without this geno armament, the defensive systems of King's Kingdom are practically fake. Therefore, I need your help."

Han Sen looked at Bai King weirdly. This tyrant of legends spoke with surprising modesty. Han Sen did not expect that.

Out of the three top high races, Ancient God did not have the ambition to control the rest of the universe. The Very High was not bothered to do it. Thus, the Extreme King was more like the leader of the universe. For a king like that, if he controlled Han Sen's life—even if Han Sen was a billion light-years away—and wanted him dead, Han Sen would be dead.

Now, Bai King was like a sad middle-aged man talking about his issues with him. If they were not in his palace, Han Sen would wonder if he was the Extreme King's king.

"Do not look at me like that," Bai King humbly said. "I am just a normal person in this universe. I am not like the gods in their lofty places. Now, I have two choices. One is to kill you and take your Extreme King's Overbearing Eye. Doing that would be fine. The Extreme King's defensive system would go back to normal."

Han Sen felt a chill. Bai King smiled and said, "But I am not planning on doing that. A race's development is like going against the water with a boat. If you do not go forward, you will go back. The Extreme King is at the top of the universe, but we have not improved for a long time. If there is a chance for us to improve, I am willing to try. Therefore, I have decided to go the other way. If you are willing to help me, our race will improve. Although the chances are slim, it is better than nothing."

Han Sen frowned and asked, "Do you want me to go to the Space Garden with you?"

Bai King laughed and said, "You underestimate yourself. The god's personality is a rare thing, but I do not care for it. I want you."

Bai King's tone of voice was very calm, but he gave off the feeling of staring down the world. It was something other people couldn't do.

"Me?" Han Sen did not understand what Bai King was trying to tell him.

"Yes, it is you. If you are really the one who killed the god in the Space Garden, that means you are half a god. Now that you have combined with my second ancestor's Extreme King's Overbearing Eye, I want to see how far you can go. If you are willing to, you could become my one and only student. You can receive more benefits than my own children. I will raise you to true god class." Everything Bai King was saying was extremely shocking.

Even when Han Sen heard it, his heart could not stop pounding.

"Why would this benefit you?" Han Sen looked at Bai King weirdly. He found it hard to believe that Bai King would willingly help an outsider xenogeneic.

"I have my own benefits," Bai King coldly said. "Just think of it has me helping you. Are you willing to receive my help or not?"

"Do I have a choice?" Han Sen asked with a smile.

Bai King smiled and said, "I do not like forcing people. This must be something you are willing to do. If you don't want to do this, you will have to die. I won't force you. At least, I will give you a quick death and take back my Extreme King's Overbearing Eye. I will also give you a big funeral."

"I want to live," Han Sen said with a wry smile.

"If you are willing to, prepare yourself for the next few days. I have never had a student before, so I expect you will not only be my first but also my last. We must have a big ceremony. I want the whole universe to know you are my student. Right, what is your name? If you do not have a name, I can give you a name. You will also have my surname..."

"Holy Baby," Han Sen quickly said. He did not want Bai King's surname.

Holy Baby was the name Han Sen had given to the red-robed child. If he was still using Holy Baby's identity, he might as well use his name.

"Holy Baby, that is a good name," Bai King said while squinting his eyes. "From now on, Holy Baby is Bai King's student. You are his only student."
