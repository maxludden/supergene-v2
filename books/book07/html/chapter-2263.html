<p>As the sword-like weapon was slowly removed, the mysterious symbols on its surface began to leap and dance like mad. It looked as if countless fairies of silver thunder were dancing across it.</p>

<p>The silver lightning still crackled out of the sword. It was like there was a silver dragon now flying around the cavern.</p>

<p>Because the lightning was too strong, Han Sen had to fall back and away from the black kirin’s corpse. Even the blood kirin itself stumbled back.</p>

<p>The blood kirin was looking very excited. It kept retreating, but its eyes never left the black kirin’s body.</p>

<p>Little Silver’s lightning was growing to frightening strength. The hilt of the sword was firmly in the grip of its maw. It forced the sword completely out of the black kirin’s body.</p>

<p>The sword was only one and a half meters long, but its shape was very strange. The blade was split into three sections, and each of its points was sharp. It looked like an army spear.</p>

<p>As he watched the lightning springing from the blade, Han Sen could immediately tell that the weapon was profoundly special. It might have been a deified weapon.</p>

<p>Dong! Dong!</p>

<p>Little Silver leaped off of the black kirin’s back. It loosened its grip on the handle and let the silver sword clatter to the ground. Then Little Silver let its powerful lightning fox form dissipate.</p>

<p>Although Little Silver didn’t seem to be injured, it did look exhausted.</p>

<p>Han Sen quickly picked up Little Silver and offered him one of the blood pears. Little Silver shook his head at the fruit and lay down on Han Sen’s chest instead. It closed its eyes, looking very, very tired.</p>

<p>Upon seeing the silver sword come free of the dead creature, the blood kirin leaped towards the black kirin’s corpse with exuberant joy.</p>

<p>“What a sweet creature. All it wanted was for its mother to rest in peace. It’s rare that I get to see something this touching.” Han Sen sighed.</p>

<p>The next second, Han Sen’s eyes opened wide. The blood kirin ran over to the black kirin’s body and used its teeth to rip off a chunk. The blood kirin tore into the corpse, eating ravenously.</p>

<p>The blood kirin used its claws to tear the body apart, and viscera and gore flew everywhere as it feasted.</p>

<p>Han Sen froze for a while, his face growing a little pale. His initial assumpted seemed to have been very wrong. He didn’t know anymore if the black kirin was indeed the blood kirin’s mother. If it was, the blood kirin really was a monster.</p>

<p>But that sort of made sense. The blood kirin was born from a dead body. It had spent its life consuming the White Bone Hell’s blood bone air. Its very existence had come from death and cruelty. Eating the corpse of its own mother to gain strength wasn’t out of the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>It was still an incredibly heartless act, though.</p>

<p>Han Sen was planning to put Bao’er and Little Silver back inside Destiny’s Tower. If the blood kirin went mad after consuming the black kirin, they would have to run.</p>

<p>Before he could grab her, Bao’er ran over to the silver sword. She reached her hand out to grab it before Han Sen could shout a warning.</p>

<p>When Bao’er’s came down upon it, the blade no longer released that silver lightning. Bao’er dragged the sword back over to Han Sen.</p>

<p>“Dad! This sword is awesome. We should take it with us.” Bao’er held the sword out to Han Sen as she spoke.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t dare take the sword, though. Just because Bao’er hadn’t been electrified, that didn’t guarantee that Han Sen wouldn’t get shocked.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, Dad! It is fine now. The blade isn’t dangerous anymore.” Bao’er winked.</p>

<p>“Pfft, why would Dad be afraid? I’m not scared; I’m just cautious. This is the behavior of a mature man.” Han Sen blushed. He reached out to take the silver sword.</p>

<p>Just as Bao’er had told him, the sword didn’t crackle with lightning when he touched it. It really did behave like an ordinary weapon now.</p>

<p>“Weird. Why has the sword become normal after leaving the black kirin’s body?” Han Sen looked at the blood kirin still gorging on the black kirin. He then thought of something. “Maybe the black kirin’s body triggered the power of the sword? Maybe that is why it remained active. The electricity kept the blood kirin from eating the black kirin. It had to have the sword removed first.”</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t know if his guesses were correct, but it didn’t matter anymore. Han Sen went to check out the sword. The symbols of thunder across it were delightful to see. They made the sword look absolutely beautiful. It didn’t even look like a weapon; it looked like an art-piece wrought in silver.</p>

<p>After witnessing its power, Han Sen agreed with Bao’er. He couldn’t tell what level it was, but he was fairly sure that it had to be a deified weapon.</p>

<p>When he looked at the blade more closely, he noticed that a few words were engraved on the back of the sword. He was able to read them. It was of the common language in the geno universe, and it said, “Thunder God Spike.”</p>

<p>“I think that must be its real name.” Han Sen raised the weapon carefully in front of him. He tried to put his own power into the Thunder God Spike, in order to trigger the weapon’s power. Unfortunately, he could not get it to work.</p>

<p>No matter what power or skill he used, nothing could trigger the lightning of the Thunder God Spike.</p>

<p>Han Sen decided to use the Dongxuan Sutra to simulate Little Silver’s lightning power, then he focused that power on the Thunder God Spike. The lightning symbols of the Thunder God Spike began to move. They were like silver snakes running up and down the blade.</p>

<p>But Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra was merely Marquise class, so the lightning power he could simulate wouldn’t be that strong. Only a small amount of the Thunder God Spike’s power was summoned, but even so, it was already very strong. It was stronger than if Han Sen used all of his power with Jadeskin.</p>

<p>“This thing is definitely a deified weapon!” Han Sen felt so happy. The Thunder God Spike didn’t hurt him when he activated it, either. That meant he could use the weapon in combat.</p>

<p>Han Sen put the Thunder God Spike into Destiny’s Tower, and thankfully, it didn’t resist like the Jade Drum had. The Jade Drum was a living creature, but the Thunder God Spike was just a weapon.</p>

<p>Han Sen was very lucky to have found the weapon, but it would be dangerous for him to carry a deified treasure in plain view. Unless it was direly necessary, Han Sen planned to keep the weapon hidden from anyone who might want to steal it.</p>

<p>Han Sen put Bao’er and Little Silver back into Destiny’s Tower. The blood kirin was still eating the black kirin’s body. It was a small creature, but its stomach was large. The black kirin’s body was like a mountain, but a big chunk of it had already disappeared.</p>

<p>The blood kirin ate its fill and grunted in satisfaction. Then it moved back and made a rumbling noise to get Han Sen’s attention. It tossed its head at the black kirin’s body, as if it was inviting Han Sen to eat.</p>

<p>“It’s fine. You can eat it.” Han Sen shook his head. His body was already filled with unprocessed Ghost Bone power, so it didn’t matter what he ate right now.</p>

<p>But the blood kirin’s invitation was still reassuring. The beast didn’t seem like it was ever going to be hostile to him.</p>
