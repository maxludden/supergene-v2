<p>Han Sen knew the little kid was not a human. The temperature of
the pot was enough to cook true god class flesh. If that little kid
was a human baby, before it was even in the pot, the heat of the
steam would have cooked its flesh. The kid that was in the water
now was just a little burned skin. It still struggled in the water,
but whatever it was, it was nothing normal.</p>
<p>“What is this thing in here?” Han Sen looked at the baby crying
in the water. He had many guesses, but he did not know what sort of
race it was.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not use the Dongxuan Aura. He could not see what
things were like outside the pot, but the water temperature kept
rising. He did not need to see anything to know that the two
xenogeneics were using fire element powers to heat the baby god
wok.</p>
<p>“What do I do now?” Han Sen had to rest a little longer before
he could use Super God Spirit mode again, but the temperature of
the pot was getting higher. Even his skin was starting to feel
prickly and painful.</p>
<p>The baby cried even louder. It kept making splashes in the
water. Although its skin was hardy, it was just a baby. It could
not really move. It could not escape the baby god wok.</p>
<p>The little baby struggled a bit. It somehow approached Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Go, go, go. Do not come any closer.” Han Sen saw it almost kick
away the green chili next to him. Han Sen used his hands to try and
push it away.</p>
<p>The little baby touched Han Sen’s hand and discovered him. It
was like a koala bear. A fat little hand held onto Han Sen’s arm.
It stopped crying and looked at Han Sen with puppy eyes.</p>
<p>“I can barely save myself. I cannot save you. Go, go, go.” Han
Sen kept thinking as he tried to swing it away. He wanted to lose
the little baby’s clutch on him.</p>
<p>The little baby was like it was stuck on his arm. He could not
shake it off.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not dare to speak or make a big movement. He did not
know what to do with the presence of that baby.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why did the ancient spirit seed stop crying?” The
one-eyed xenogeneic’s nasally voice was heard again. It gave Han
Sen a chill.</p>
<p>“He must have gotten cooked,” the rough voice said. “Ground
heart flame. The baby god wok is already so hot. With my true Yang
flame and your ghost underworld fire, it was bound to cook this
true god xenogeneic. It was just a baby.”</p>
<p>“What do you know?” the one-eyed xenogeneic asked. “That was not
a normal baby. It was an ancient spirit seed, you know.” “What is
an ancient spirit seed?” the rough voice asked with confusion. The
one-eyed xenogeneic coldly said, “I cannot believe you used to be a
leader of a system, yet you don’t even know about the Ancient God’s
ancient spirit seeds.”</p>
<p>After pausing, the one-eyed xenogeneic explained. “Ancient Gods
are based on their Ancient God Origins. That is how they go on.
When the old Ancient Gods die, they leave an Ancient God Origin
behind so new Ancient Gods can be created. So, the number of
Ancient Gods is fixed. There will not be anymore, and there will
not be any less unless the Ancient God Origin is destroyed. The
Ancient God will use a mysterious ritual to make new Ancient Gods,
but there is only one Ancient God that has ever had their Ancient
God Origin destroyed. He activated the ritual and made a new
Ancient God. This Ancient God comes about like a newborn baby, and
their powers have not been approved. They cannot support elemental
powers. That is why they are called ancient spirit seeds. They will
become a real Ancient God once they receive the approval of an
element.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean the ancient spirit seeds are Ancient Gods? Do we
use ancient spirit seeds to make geno fluid and give it to the
lady? Does that mean we are eating those of the same kind?” The
rough voice had not finished talking when it was interrupted.</p>
<p>“Be quiet! Don’t keep talking. No one would ever think you are a
mute.” The one-eyed xenogeneic hushed his voice and said, “Our
master is the king of the Ancient Gods. One ancient spirit seed is
nothing. Even if you cooked a real Ancient God, no one would say
anything.”</p>
<p>The volume of the rough voice lowered as it quietly replied,
“Weird. The rules claim Ancient God needs to wait until the old
Ancient Gods die before the new Ancient Gods can be reborn. If that
is true, why does the master only have the lady as an heir?”</p>
<p>“That is not a secret you and I are allowed to know about. Stop
talking and hurry up with the fire. We must cook the geno fluid
before the lady’s adult ceremony can begin. We cannot afford to
fail at this.” The one-eyed xenogeneic briefly paused and went on
to say, “You keep cooking. I will take a look at what happened to
that ancient spirit seed.”</p>
<p>“You do not need to look. It must have been cooked.”</p>
<p>“Just do as I tell you and stop talking crap.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the one-eyed xenogeneic move. He looked at the
ancient spirit seed, which was still holding his arm like a koala
bear. There were many tears in its eyes. It made him sigh. “I
cannot believe I am in the realm of the Ancient God, and this is
Ancient God King’s territory. Can I escape with what I have
now?”</p>
<p>He saw the one-eyed xenogeneic’s head come above the pot. Han
Sen brought the ancient spirit seed with him in a jump. Han Sen
stepped onto the one-eyed xenogeneic’s head and started to fly. He
ran toward the path leading out of the cave.</p>
<p>The moment he rushed out, Han Sen saw another xenogeneic. It was
a xenogeneic that looked like a black bear, but it had eight arms.
It was spitting out a fire at the bottom of the wok.</p>
<p>Its brain did not seem to work. It saw Han Sen bring the ancient
spirit seed out with it. It watched Han Sen head through the tunnel
and did not do anything.</p>
<p>“Why are you standing here?” The one-eyed xenogeneic madly
shouted, “There is an enemy that has invaded here! He has taken the
ancient spirit seed! Hurry up and chase after him!” He turned
around and raced down the tunnel where Han Sen had run off
into.</p>
<p>Because the tunnel Han Sen had selected was only tall enough for
one person, the one-eyed xenogeneic was too big to give pursuit.
So, he had to break through the rocks to maintain the pace.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not use geno arts, but his body power was true god
class.</p>
<p>When he ran, he was like lightning. He quickly down the many
tunnels that led to various places. People could not even see his
shadow.</p>
<p>The ancient spirit seed held onto Han Sen’s arm. Its small face
was twisted. It was being blown by the wind.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the ancient spirit seed onto his chest. The ancient
spirit seed let go of his arm. Its hands were now clutching Han
Sen’s clothing. It opened his eyes and smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have the sensing power of the Dongxuan Aura. He
just went down every path he came to and crossed every bridge he
saw. He was like a headless fly traveling down the tunnels.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he did not encounter any other xenogeneics. He also
did not see anyone else from the Ancient Gods. Han Sen eventually
felt a bit safer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the cave up ahead widened. There was a large
underground space with many weird flowers and fruits. It was a
beautiful underground garden.</p>
<p>A white-clothed girl was sitting on a swing in the garden. She
was looking at Han Sen and the ancient spirit seed that had just
entered the garden.</p>
