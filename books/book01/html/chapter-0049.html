	<p>The two gangs had marched more than half a month before they reached a mountain Han Sen had never been to.</p>

	<p>On the way, Han Sen had truly understood there was strength in numbers. No creatures could block their path with
		the rain of arrows from the archers and the charge of the cavalry. Of course, the scouts would inform them if
		there were herds of strong creatures ahead of them and they would take a detour.</p>

	<p>At the destination, Bullseye hid on a cliff and was ready to shoot the sacred-blood creature drawn out by Luo
		Tianyang’s team.</p>

	<p>The rest went under the cliff and was ready to chase the creature.</p>

	<p>In addition to Bullseye, Son of Heaven and his henchmen also stayed on the cliff. Han Sen knew they must also be
		good at archery because he had witnessed Son of God almost killing the bloody slayer with an arrow before he
		snatched its beast soul.</p>

	<p>Son of Heaven looked at Han Sen coldly as he had heard rumors about Han Sen being Qin Xuan’s boy toy, which
		annoyed him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Son of Heaven, where are the arrows you’ve agreed to offer?&#8221; asked Yang Manli.</p>

	<p>It was Bullseye that Son of Heaven really needed this time. As normal arrows wouldn’t harm a sacred-blood
		creature at all, and Z-steel arrows were too expensive, Son of Heaven had agreed to provide Bullseye with the
		arrows needed this time.</p>

	<p>Son of Heaven smiled and waved his hand. His henchmen then carried a box down from the back of a mount. They
		opened the box and it was filled with Starlight arrows, each worth more than a million. It was made by Starry
		Group with 1 percent Z-steel.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Manli, here are a hundred Starlight arrows we agreed on. Would you distribute them among your best
		archers?&#8221; Son of Heaven smiled.</p>

	<p>Yang Manli turned around and started calling out names. She had good arrows herself; so did Liu Hongtao. Hence,
		she planned to pick five other members of Bullseye out to use the Starlight arrows.</p>

	<p>Soon she had four people picked out and with some thought, she looked at Han Sen, &#8220;And you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Han Sen was slightly surprised, as he did not expect Yang Manli to choose himself. But this was a good thing, and
		Han Sen quickly stepped up and stood together with the other four.</p>

	<p>While Yang Manli was preparing to distribute the arrows among the five, Son of Heaven suddenly said grimly,
		&#8220;Manli, are you sure about the archers?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is the problem?&#8221; Yang Manli looked to Son of Heaven.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How is someone like him qualified to use the Starlight arrows?&#8221; asked Son of Heaven coldly, pointing
		to Han Sen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I chose him, and that’s why he’s qualified,&#8221; replied Yang Manli.</p>

	<p>Son of Heaven looked at Han Sen disgustedly and said to Yang Manli, &#8220;I am not questioning your decision,
		but this person just will not do. Please replace him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Yang Manli frowned, but she knew this campaign was dominated by Son of Heaven, since he had provided everything.
		Bullseye was just here to help. So, she couldn’t refuse him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Zhao Hua, come here.&#8221; Yang Manli had to let Han Sen return to the team, and called out another name.
	</p>

	<p>Son of Heaven continued to stare at Han Sen coldly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sen, you are really unlucky. You had the opportunity to get 20 Starlight arrows and kill the sacred-blood
		creature. Now it’s all gone,&#8221; said Su Xiaoqiao with regret.</p>

	<p>Han Sen shrugged. Although it was a shame he didn’t get the 20 Starlight arrows, he had an even stronger arrow in
		his quiver. He still had a chance.</p>

	<p>The archers each took position on the cliff and prepared their bows and arrows, waiting for the sacred-blood
		creature to fly out from below.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and Su Xiaoqiao found a comfortable spot and Son of Heaven suddenly walked over and said, &#8220;What are
		you useless scums doing here? Go away.&#8221; Then, Son of Heaven’s henchmen shoved Han Sen and Su Xiaoqiao
		aside.</p>

	<p>Su Xiaoqiao fiercely stared at them with anger. Han Sen tugged on his arm and said, &#8220;It doesn’t matter.
		Let’s go over there.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;They are pushing too far,&#8221; said Su Xiaoqiao bitterly.</p>

	<p>&quot; Revenge is a dish best served cold. Just wait until you see Son of Heaven’s face when we kill the
		sacred-blood creature,&quot; smiled Han Sen while walking to the other side with Su Xiaoqiao.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It’s not that easy. This cliff is wide and Son of Heaven’s men are waiting on the other side. If the
		sacred-blood creature went to their side, it would be too far from us. Even if it were only three hundred feet
		from us, we couldn’t even injure it without Starlight arrows. Basically, we are just a decoy, a
		distraction,&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao smiled wryly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You have money. Why didn’t you buy a few Starlight arrows?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Xiaoqiao puzzled. He
		remembered Su Xiaoqiao to be very rich. One million should be nothing for him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do I need those for? It’s outrageously expensive and you may not even be able to recover it. One
		million each, and you probably need to shoot seven or eight before you could hit something. No guarantee of
		killing anything either. I’d rather spend the money purchasing mutant creature meat.&#8221; Then Su Xiaqiao
		lowered his voice and said, &#8220;Now Z-steel is extremely overvalued. As the young master of Starry Group, Son
		of Heaven owns mines and factories of Z-steel. So, he doesn’t need to spend much on these arrows, as the cost of
		each arrow is at most ten thousand.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Such huge profits?&#8221; Han Sen was surprised.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, now Z-steel mines have been monopolized by a few groups. Also the manufacturing technologies are not
		ready for producing alpha alloy with more than 5 percent Z-steel. For some reason, the alpha alloy will become
		as brittle as glass if Z-steel content exceeds 5 percent.&#8221; Su Xiaoqiao explained to the Han Sen.</p>

	<p>While the two were chatting, they suddenly heard a howling like dragon under the cliff. Grabbing their bows, they
		looked down from the cliff.</p>
