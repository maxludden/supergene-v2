<p>Ordinary cacti were not a threat to Luo Yu and the others. They had the power of Falsified Sky, and none of the cacti could even defend themselves against them.</p>

<p>However, Han Sen also realized that Luo Yu and the others had only practiced the first half of the Falsified-Sky Sutra. He didn’t understand why Luo Haitang hadn’t even taught his direct family members the complete version of the Falsified-Sky Sutra.</p>

<p>As for Luo Yu’s body, it also looked strange to Han Sen. Both his strength and speed seemed to have reached super level, but his life force didn’t seem as strong as it should have been. Instead, it had stayed at the sacred-blood level.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t know that Luo Haitang had obtained a life geno essence a long time ago, but he wasn’t able to absorb the life geno essence because of his practice of Shura Change.</p>

<p>The other Luo’s like Luo Yu were ordinary humans, but they hadn’t figured out a method of absorbing life geno essences from the First God’s Sanctuary, not to mention the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Back then, the gene liquid that most people now used to absorb life geno essences hadn’t been invented yet. Those from the generation of Luo Yu’s and Luo Hui’s father studied it for a long time, and they finally came up with a special method to use life geno essences.</p>

<p>That method wasn’t the same as the conventional method of absorbing life geno essences. They borrowed it from a geno solution designed for a Qi Gong, and it treated life geno essence as a geno solution.</p>

<p>Though the technique didn’t allow the user to merge the life geno essence with their own flesh and blood, it did create a strange geno solution with the origin of power of the Luo’s. The Luo’s had another kind of special power aside from the power of Falsified Sky.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, the geno solution they had condensed was transformed into a self geno core. More importantly, that self geno core still had the same ability to absorb life geno essences. When the geno core formed, it was automatically at super level.</p>

<p>Aside from that self geno core, they could also condense a second self geno core from the Falsified-Sky Sutra, which was why the Luo’s were so proud.</p>

<p>Having two self geno cores, with one of those cores immediately rising to super level, gave the Luo’s the leverage to roam the Alliance.</p>

<p>However, there was a huge downside to this method; their bodies hadn’t reached super level, so the Luo’s were physically weak. Their life forces hadn’t reached super level, which was why they felt strange to Han Sen.</p>

<p>A couple hundred miles into the dune, they began to find cacti made of gold. They were all sacred-blood creatures, yet they were still killed by Luo Yu and Luo Hui with one strike. The power of half the Falsified-Sky Sutra was already extraordinary.</p>

<p>Han Sen also killed several golden cacti with his Taia and gained a beast soul. It was a heavy mace that was made of gold, and it looked forceful.</p>

<p>However, Han Sen didn’t know how to use this kind of unpopular weapon, so he would have to trade it.</p>

<p>The cacti were bizarre. They were grown in the sand, so they couldn’t move at all, and the only attack techniques they had were thorns. Their flesh and blood weren’t edible either. If Han Sen hadn’t already killed some, he wouldn’t even have thought they were creatures.</p>

<p>Luo Yu and the others weren’t surprised to see Han Sen slaying the sacred-blood creatures. If Han Sen couldn’t even do that, Luo Haitang wouldn’t have valued him.</p>

<p>“Those cacti!” After walking a thousand miles into the dune, Jia Shidao pointed in front of them.</p>

<p>Han Sen and Luo Yu and the others all followed Jia Shidao’s gaze. They saw a cactus that was ten feet tall, made of crystal, simmering under the sun. And it wasn’t the only cactus. Behind that cactus were many other crystal cacti with a variety of shapes.</p>

<p>Everyone stopped walking, and nobody dared to move forward anymore. Even Luo Yu and Luo Hui had to be careful when they faced super creatures.</p>

<p>After all, their bodies were only as sturdy as sacred-blood creatures, so they might be killed by super creatures.</p>

<p>“You want to kill a super creature, right? Now it’s your chance to do so. Let’s see whether you can actually do it or not,” said Luo Yu, looking at Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen took a look at those cacti made of crystal. He shook his head and said, “I don’t even know what those cacti are capable of yet, so I’d better test them first.”</p>

<p>Although the previous cacti couldn’t move at all, nobody could guarantee that these cacti wouldn’t be able to move either, so Han Sen didn’t want to risk it.</p>

<p>“If you’re too scared to try it, then I’ll do it first,” said Luo Yu while summoning his geno core.</p>

<p>A red crystal armor covered Luo Yu’s body, and a blade appeared in his hands.</p>

<p>That red crystal armor looked bizarre. Han Sen felt that it was made of life geno essence, but he couldn’t tell how that had been done.</p>

<p>Luo Yu’s blade looked like the She-King Blade, but it wasn’t as delicate.</p>

<p>“This is so weird. The power of that crystal armor doesn’t seem to be connected to the Falsified-Sky Sutra at all, but it gives Luo Yu terrific power.” Han Sen’s interest was piqued.</p>

<p>Luo Yu lifted his shield and dashed toward the cactus closest to him. Just like the ordinary cacti, it spewed out many thorns that looked like crystal. The thorns flew toward Luo Yu like a storm.</p>

<p>Dang!</p>

<p>The thorns pierced Luo Yu’s sacred-blood shield. However, the thorns that hit his body were warded off by the crystal armor, so they didn’t injure him at all.</p>

<p>Han Sen nodded. “The Luo’s indeed have something to be proud of. With that armor, only a few humans like Gu Qingcheng would actually be able to hurt him.”</p>

<p>Luo Yu rushed toward the crystal cactus like a heavy-armored soldier. The thorns hit his armor, making a sound like rain on a tin roof, but they still failed to pierce through the armor. Luo Yu was getting closer and closer to the cactus. The blade in his hand that contained the mysterious power of Falsified Sky slashed toward the crystal cactus.</p>

<p>Jia Shidao was exhilarated, and he couldn’t help yelling, “Luo Yu is incredible! We can’t even compare with him.”</p>

<p>Luo Hui smiled. “It was right of you to cooperate with us. Big brother’s geno core has both attacks and defense. Killing creatures that can’t move their bodies will be easy for him. Just wait here for the rewards.”</p>

<p>Luo Yu’s blade hit the crystal cactus as they spoke, but in the next second, Luo Yu’s face fell.</p>

<p>The geno core blade that contained the power of Falsified Sky slashed the crystal cactus, but it couldn’t injure the crystal cactus in the slightest.</p>

<p>The geno core blade was a geno core condensed from the Falsified-Sky Sutra, so it couldn’t grow immediately to super level like the first self geno core. It was still a gemstone core.</p>

<p>The body of the crystal cactus was too solid. Even if it had the power of Falsified Sky, the sword couldn’t break the body of the crystal cactus at all.</p>
