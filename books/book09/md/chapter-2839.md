Han Sen's finger touched the starlight. The starlight turned into a dot of starlight on his fingertip. Following Han Sen's wish, the starlight formed two words, "Human Dollar." In the next moment, starlight flew back into the skies and returned to the geno god list. The geno god list now had "Human Dollar" on it.

Almost at the exact same time, Han Sen saw many names appear on the geno god list. Han Sen looked at them. He saw many familiar names.

"Empty Mountain... Golden Growler... Is that Golden Growler?" When Han Saw the name, he was taken aback.

Although Han Sen was excited to see his Little Gold Gold, he was worried Little Gold Gold had forgotten about him.

"Why disguise as a human? You are xenogeneic." God looked at Han Sen with interest.

"I like doing that." Han Sen did not explain any further, but he felt surprised and thought, After I became xenogeneic, not even God can see that my true body is human. That is surprising. It is good that God thinks I am just disguising myself. Otherwise, with God's suspicions of humans, something might have happened.

In the palace situated inside a red dwarf, a few blue-blooded men bowed before a king. "Legion Leader, the geno god list has suddenly appeared. This is a great opportunity for our legion. If we can achieve first place and claim the god spirit seat, it will be great for our legion."

"Then, we will let Lou Lie join the geno god fight," the man coldly said.

On Empty Mountain's peak, the green-haired Growler screamed excitedly. "God helped out Empty Mountain! Little Mountain Leader has only just become true god. Now, this chance has arisen. This time, Little Mountain Leader must achieve first place to become a god spirit and earn glory for all of Empty Mountain."

All across the universe, many scary elites were aiming for first place on the god list. Only the old fortune-teller lowered his head and frowned, thinking of something. He didn't speak.

In the Extreme King, many deified elites signed up. Even if they didn't achieve first place, getting into the top 100 enabled them to receive many benefits.

The three high races were not interested in the geno being scroll. They would not join those. This time, the geno god list was something many deified elites of the three high races would participate in.

Han Sen thought the geno universe only had a few thousand deified elites at the most. In the geno god list, there were at least 10,000 names. Plus, some deified elites had selected not to join. There were many more deified elites in the geno universe than Han Sen had believed there to be.

Han Sen did not expect to achieve first place. After all, his power was not enough to battle a true god elite yet. If he could get into the top 100, he would not be disappointed.

Let me see what the rewards are for reaching the top 100. It is pretty generous... The first 100 can receive a true god item. Han Sen felt as if he must work hard. A true god treasure was always good for him to have.

The most important thing Han Sen needed now was for him to become butterfly class. Being larva class did not allow him to remain as an adult for long. When he had the body of a child, he could not activate the powers inside him. He could not fight strong elites.

I need 20 more deified genes to reach a maximum of 100. It looks like I will be too late to join the first god fight. I hope the first fight is not against some scary elite. Just give me a primitive or something. Just let me go through the first fight with ease. Han Sen planned on going to Nine-Defense Palace to kill deified xenogeneics and absorb their genes.

Nine-Defense Palace could only be entered alone, so Han Sen asked God to wait in the garden and await his return. Just as Han Sen had entered Nine-Defense Palace, he discovered that God had been following.

Han Sen did not say anything. The restrictions of Nine-Defense Palace were powerful, but to stop a being that called itself God, maybe it was not that great.

After Han Sen opened the palace, he walked to room 0038. He saw a xenogeneic locked inside. It was a big black bird with ink feathers. Its eyes were like the sun and moon. One was yellow, and one was red. It looked at Han Sen, which gave him a chill.

God looked at the big black bird and said, "Huh... This xenogeneic is weird,"

"What is weird?" Han Sen shrugged. If God said the xenogeneic was weird, there had to be a problem somewhere.

Han Sen always wondered why Bai King granted Han Sen access to Nine-Defense Palace. He wondered if it was all part of some grand conspiracy. If there was, he could not identify it. If God really did find out something about all these things, it would be a great help.

"This xenogeneic does not have a spirit." God looked at the xenogeneic while speaking.

"Spirit?" Han Sen looked at God with confusion. He did not know what that meant. What was a spirit?

"Everything has a spirit," God said. "A spirit is not a soul, but it is similar. All creatures without a spirit can live, but they cannot evolve."

"I thought evolution depended on a person's genes." Han Sen did not understand.

"That is correct. The genes are one of the changes that occur within a spirit. With a spirit, genes can mutate. Otherwise, pure, generic gene messages cannot make things mutate." God looked at the black bird and said, "That is a larva class xenogeneic. If it can become this level, it should have a spirit. But this bird does not have a spirit. That is weird."

God was silent for a moment before looking at Han Sen and saying, "This place must have another xenogeneic, right? Take me to have a look."

Han Sen wanted to know what happened there as well. He took God to look at the other xenogeneics before he killed them.

Because the power of those xenogeneics was stronger than his, he had previously skipped them and did not kill the xenogeneics.

There were three xenogeneics like that. Han Sen brought God to open one of the palaces. God saw them and immediately said, "A butterfly class xenogeneic that does not possess a spirit as well. This is so weird."

He inspected the other two xenogeneics, too. That just made God's face inflected with more curiosity. "Interesting... I did not know the Extreme King had such a very interesting place. The xenogeneics here do not have spirits, especially the xenogeneic in palace 0002. That is a true god class Time Ghost. It is a very famous, scary xenogeneic. Rarely can a creature of the universe fight it. It does not have a spirit now either. That is interesting."

God looked at Time Ghost with interest like a kid looking at toys.

"Is there a problem with a xenogeneic that does not possess a spirit?" Han Sen had eaten many of the xenogeneics from that place. Although he did not feel anything negative with them, he was worried that it was bad for his body,

"Aside from the fact they cannot evolve, there is nothing bad about them," God replied and then muttered to itself. "Were their spirits taken out by force? If so, how was it achieved? What does it mean?"
