When Han Sen looked closer, he realized that the circles around the snake king’s neck weren’t actually eyes; they were six spinning cogwheels. He didn’t know what the six cogwheels did, though.

“Quickly, we must go!” Li Keer shouted at Han Sen. She was on the verge of using God’s Wander to escape that place.

But before she could teleport away, she saw that the space around her had already been turned on its head. The entire universe appeared to be spinning like a hungry vortex.

Han Sen also tried to teleport away, but he found that he couldn’t tear space and escape through it like he would need to. It was like he had lost his connection to the outside world.

“Oh no! We’re trapped in Six Space. In this Six Space, all of space follows the rules set by the Six Core God Snake. Your space powers won’t be of any use here.” Li Keer was in shock.

Han Sen wasn’t frightened by this enemy, though. He noticed that the Six Core God Snake was looking steadily at his head. Clearly, it was after the small Crocodile God.

The small Crocodile God was very young, and it didn’t yet know what fear meant. Seeing the Six Core God Snake look at it, the little creature simply stared back. It then roared proudly at the Six Core God Snake.

Han Sen knew the small Crocodile God commanding the snake to follow and be its little brother.

The Six Core God Snake appeared to understand, and it screamed back with immense rage. It opened its mouth and unleashed some space substance chains. They flew toward the small Crocodile God like an aurora trailing through space.

Han Sen quickly evaded them, and the small Crocodile God flew forward. In all its boisterous glory, it fancied taking on the Six Core God Snake all by itself. It wanted to teach the huge creature a lesson.

It made this decision because of Han Sen’s constant compliments, no doubt. Han Sen had been going on and on about how powerful and almighty the small Crocodile God was. He had filled the creature’s head with nonsense, as if it was the strongest creature in existence. He had even claimed that every race would treat it like a god. He said people would admire and show great love to the little crocodile. He said every creature would want to become its subordinate.

The poor, naive little Crocodile God thought its mother was the most people being in the universe, and that it was number two. It thought all other creatures were tiny by comparison, so it wasn’t going to stand for the Six Core God Snake’s offense.

Han Sen hadn’t run far before coming to a stop. He wanted to watch the fight between the snake and crocodile.

“Run! The small Crocodile God isn’t a worthy opponent for the Six Core God Snake. We should leave now before it is too late,” Exquisite said, flying over to Han Sen.

“The small Crocodile God’s power should be as good as a primitive deified here, right? Can anything else in the core area be stronger than it?” Han Sen asked.

“The Six Core God Snake is one of the strongest xenogeneics in the core area,” Li Keer explained. “The snake isn’t as strong as the big Crocodile God, but it is as good as a primitive can get. Plus, its space powers are so strong, and in addition to the fighting experience it has compared to the little Crocodile God… Well, the newborn Crocodile God doesn’t really stand a chance of fighting back.”

Pang!

What Li Keer said immediately came true. There was a loud noise, and when Han Sen turned to take a look, he saw that the little Crocodile God had been sent flying away by the Six Core God Snake. The little creature rolled end over end through space. It eventually hit a planet, and the planet blew up.

“So strong!” Han Sen thought in shock. He took the bronze furnace with him as he flew away. The space around them was under the snake’s control, so they couldn’t teleport away. Even Exquisite and Li Keer were forced to fly away instead of teleporting.

The space behind them seemed to groan with a strange sound. Han Sen couldn’t help but look back. There, he saw that the small Crocodile God’s face was swollen and discolored. It started to cry. Its small eyes were streaming with tears.

“I’m sorry, little Crocodile God. You can’t beat him, and neither can I. At least you are a deified xenogeneic. You should just run while you still have the chance to. Don’t take it out on me. We aren’t being cruel, here. You took us as hostages, remember? We are enemies,” Han Sen said over his shoulder as he flew.

Han Sen followed the Very High women as they flew away, but some unexpected pangs of regret were striking Han Sen’s heart. He thought that the teary eyes of the small Crocodile God were meant for him.

“So… why did the Six Core God Snake want to kill the small Crocodile God?” Han Sen asked Li Keer as he continued flying.

“The Six Core God Snake is one of the rare core xenogeneics that can evolve. Its name wasn’t always Six Core God Snake. It used to be known as the Two Core God Snake. Its neck only had two cogwheels back then. Whenever it eats a deified core gene, it can create another cogwheel, and its power increases. It now has six cores, and so the power it has should make it the most powerful primitive deified out there. Plus, it has scary space powers. It isn’t like the Gold Armor General or those other core deified xenogeneics,” Li Keer explained.

“Does the Six Core God Snake have a weakness?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

“It does. Its power is very strong, but core xenogeneics always have flaws. The same applies to the Six Core God Snake. Its weakness is those cogwheels. Four of them were obtained by eating four other deified xenogeneics. They aren’t as good as the creature’s original cogwheels. That is its weakness,” Li Keer said.

“You guys should go on ahead,” Han Sen said. Then, he suddenly flew back.

“What are you doing?” Li Keer and Exquisite asked in confusion. They weren’t quite sure what Han Sen was planning.

“You guys should leave now. I’m going back to watch,” Han Sen said. He felt something weird in his heart, and so he decided to go back.

“Is he going to save that small Crocodile God?” Li Keer watched Han Sen leave. She couldn’t believe that what she said was actually happening.

“He is controlled by his emotions way too much. He will be at a constant disadvantage like that. While his talents are exceptional, he is too dangerous to take on as a silkworm,” Exquisite said emotionlessly.

“But if I was trapped and couldn’t fight back, I wish there was someone out there driven by an emotion that made them want to save me,” Li Keer said with a conflicted expression.

“Everything must die. With an attitude like that, your practice with the Very High Sense will not go very far.” Exquisite frowned.

The small Crocodile God had been captured by space substance chains. It hung in space, unable to move. Thankfully, its body was too strong for the chains to dig into its scaled flesh. The space substance kept hitting it, but the blows could only make the small creature bleed.

The Six Core God Snake was staring down at the small Crocodile God like a hungry demon. Its substance chains kept raging, lashing the little creature over and over.

The small Crocodile God continued to cry out as more and more bloody wounds appeared across its body.

The small Crocodile God’s powers weren’t enough to break the space substance chains. It was unable to avoid the hits. It was just hanging where it was, being lashed over and over. Streaks of blood ran down its body. Although it wasn’t heavily injured, it was in agony. Its tears streamed off its face to fall like droplets of rain.
