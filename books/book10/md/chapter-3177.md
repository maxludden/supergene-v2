Han Sen complicatedly looked at Zhuo Dong Lai, who was exuding a strange sort of power that was different from the power elicited by the purple mist holy clothes.

Zhuo Dong Lai’s body emitted a purple mist and glass-like words. The words looked as if they had been branded onto Zhuo Dong Lai’s flesh. It was like when he was born, it had already been carved into his flesh.

“The rumors are true. Zhuo Dong Lai really is a man who was blessed by a god. Those mysterious words… Are they the words that he was born with?”

“Special people really are special people, even though he might not have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse.”

“The face of the Sky Group Leader must be looking rather funny right now.”

Many of the elites in the world were looking rather strange. Many of them felt happy about what was happening, whereas others felt extremely jealous. Only Han Sen’s feelings could not be described.

The mysterious text on Zhuo Dong Lai read, “Purple Manor Sutra.” Although Han Sen had never bothered to learn the Purple Manor Sutra, seeing Zhuo Dong Lai use it, he still knew some of it.

Upon seeing the text, it was obviously Purple Manor Sutra’s content. “Now, I see! He is Zhuo Dong Lai reborn. When he was reborn, he could not erase his thoughts and memories of the past. They were deep inside his soul and bones. It was always there inside his blood. How stubborn of a man must he be? He forgot who he was, but even the reincarnation process could not scrub him clean and prevent him from carrying on the legacy of the Purple Manor Sutra. Did he encounter something lucky before his death? Did the Purple Manor Sutra residing inside his spirit go with him through his death?” Han Sen was shocked.

After seeing the Purple Manor Sutra, Han Sen finally knew why there was no support of a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. He also now understood why the purple mist holy clothes still decided to cling onto Zhuo Dong Lai.

In that world, everything had a cause. The purple mist holy clothes and the power of the Purple Manor Sutra had their main and opposite sides. They were two different existences.

If Zhuo Dong Lai was one day able to use the purple mist holy clothes and Purple Manor Sutra’s power, it meant that he had reached a level that would enable him to break the world.

It was a shame that Han Sen’s power was too weak at it was, and the power of the Purple Manor Sutra was restricted by the forces of that universe. The only reason it was showing itself now was that the power of the Purple Manor Sutra was triggered by the purple mist holy clothes.

Zhuo Dong Lai still had a way to go before breaking the world. To ordinary people, his chance of breaking the world was much higher. To say he was a talented genius was exactly right.

When ordinary people were reborn, they were not permitted to cling to the memories of their past life. Yet, he had kept a geno art from his past life. If someone like that was not called a genius, then geniuses could not exist in that world.

When the Purple Manor Sutra’s text started to fade, Zhuo Dong Lai woke up. Although he had lost his God Spirit Blood-Pulse, the feelings he gave off were much more powerful.

Before, the purple mist holy clothes were just clothes that existed around him. Now, the purple mist holy clothes were part of his body. They gave people the feeling that he was the holy clothes, and the holy clothes were him.

“Now is the time we can decide the victor,” Zhuo Dong Lai said to Han Sen with a smile. His smile was like a spring sun that could melt the sun. It made people smile along with him.

The young girls and women were watching with eyes that glowed.

“OK.” Han Sen nodded. He saw Zhuo Dong Lai start with Purple Mist That Comes from the East. He did not use a sword skill again.

Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword mind and spirit were already perfect. Using a spirit sword path was not going to work on him.

Zhuo Dong Lai turned his two fingers into a sword and pointed them at Han Sen. This time, there was no power like 10,000 swords coming together. There was just a little bit of purple light that came flying over to Han Sen.

When the purple light was flying, even the sky and ground shook like there was some purple air coming. They were going to the purple light. It was like all the power of the sky and ground were focused on that purple light.

The purple light got close to Han Sen, which made the purple air heavier. It started from a small dot and formed a line. From a line, it turned into a sword. The purple air gathered to form a sword. It was like a lifeforce that had just been born. It made the chaotic sky and ground have infinite changes. One sword split up the sky and the ground. Han Sen felt as if there was no going back. One sword power could split the sky and the ground, but he was just a person. In Wu Wei Dao Palace’s main sect, a man locked down in a tower opened his eyes. He said to himself, “The sky and the ground are reincarnating. They are ending so they can begin anew. Purple Mist Comes from the East… One sword that can break the world… Wu Wei Dao Palace finally has someone that has awoken. Which group is he from to become like this?”

“Wu Wei Dao Palace has another very strong elite. It will be very difficult for the Qin Kingdom to improve with this” A king stood before a god. He looked at the power of the sword and looked sad.

Han Sen was confused. He thought Zhuo Dong Lai had the conditions to break the world, but breaking the world would still take a while.

He never thought his sword had reached the max. It went from Yang to Yin. It went from positive straight to negative. He had used another way to combine and reverse the break world power.

Han Sen had made a mistake with this assumption. The break world power on display did not come from Zhuo Dong Lai. It came from the purple mist holy clothes. The purple mist holy clothes followed Wu Wei Dao Palace. Wu Wei Dao Alpha had unlocked a shortcut to breaking the world. Now, it was accepting Zhuo Dong Lai so he could use its power.

Although Zhuo Dong Lai understood, his power still had not reached that level.

Seeing the sword come, it was like the sky and the ground was crushing him. It made Han Sen feel incredible amounts of restriction. Ever since the fight with Rocky Dee, Han Sen had yet to encounter another incredible type of power that could be put on par with what was used against him. He felt as if his heart was going to get ripped apart.

Han Sen was standing in the air. His long hair waved with the wind. He felt as if there was an emotion within him that he could not accurately discern. He had an urge to improve. After coming to the universe of kingdoms, Han Sen had been fighting all types of power. Throughout it all, no one had been able to touch his heart.

Even Rocky Dee had made Han Sen feel as if he was a character that would be hard to get rid of. It never invoked real emotion in Han Sen’s heart.

Now, Zhuo Dong Lai understood how to break the world. He achieved his super sword, which struck fear into Han Sen’s heart. It gave him the feeling that he wanted to practice.

Xuan Yellow Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra ran through Han Sen’s body at the same time. These two opposite powers ran at the same time, but they did not create conflict with each other.

Han Sen had tried to do this many times, but it had never worked. Now, it was triggered by Zhuo Dong Lai’s sword mind. It was like he had just received the aid of a god. The two powers ran through his body with friction. It was not like before. It was working.

The sword light did not go back. It went forward. Han Sen stepped forward and slashed with his hand. It was like a ship breaking against rough waters. His hand felt as if great waves were crashing against him. It felt as if there were 10,000 mountains and hellish creations trying to stop his bob and roll.

“Open!” Han Sen’s eyes were on fire. His entire body was burning with a life force that one could not see. His hands were like axes as he slashed toward the sword light.

One purple and one red halo flashed in space, but only for one second. No one could see what was going on.

The two bolts of lightning disappeared. The two cracks in space did not heal. A small crack appeared in the fabric of space. It was defined by the shape of an X. It burned in space. It seemed as if it would never fade.

Everyone felt their hearts tremble. They were still trying to remember how good this was. Han Sen and Zhuo Dong Lai had somehow ended up standing in front of each other, and Han Sen’s hand was up against Zhuo Dong Lai’s neck.
