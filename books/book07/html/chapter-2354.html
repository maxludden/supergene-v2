<h2>Suppress Demon Coffin</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2354</h3>

<p>Han Sen walked toward the Nine-Headed Bird. Darkness flowed from
the creature, consuming all that could be seen in every direction.
Han Sen knew that the darkness was coming for him, that it would
trap his body in less than a second.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen hit the darkness, but it was like he was striking a
plate of steel. The impact made his hand go numb, and the wall of
black around him remained unmoved.</p>
<p>The darkness seemed to solidify into walls of flat stone. It
enveloped the entire area around Han Sen, trapping him inside a
small box.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept punching the black stone around him, his Kingese
continuing to shine. But even so, the black stone didn’t break.
Dark demonic symbols began to appear across the surface of the
stone.</p>
<p>“The sky above has a bird of nine heads, and hell below holds
the suppressing demon coffin. No matter how strong your Kingese
body is, you cannot escape the binding area of my demon coffin.”
Nine-Headed Bird’s voice sounded in Han Sen’s ear.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the demonic symbols across the stone. One of
them looked rather like a bird’s head, and it turned and squawked
at him.</p>
<p>Xius and the other observers saw the black coffin close around
Han Sen. The pitch-black coffin was disturbing to look at, and a
nine-headed bird stood on its lid. Each of the bird’s nine heads
looked off in a different direction, and it kept the coffin
suppressed. A demonic air swirled around the coffin, and no matter
how Han Sen tried to attack, the demon coffin would not budge.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist kept striking, but he couldn’t break through the
suppressing field of the demon coffin.</p>
<p>The demonic symbols flashed across the coffin’s interior, and a
bird head appeared again. The weird bird eyes stared at Han Sen and
the creature chuckled. “Don’t waste your breath. My Suppress Demon
Coffin can bind both gods and demons. Even if a deified was in your
place, they wouldn’t be able to break out of this coffin. You can
hand over the Ancient God Origin now. If you don’t, and the
Suppress Demon Coffin falls into the demonic abyss, even I won’t be
able to help you out.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored the bird. He kept punching against the Suppress
Demon Coffin, but it was proving to be futile. Han Sen’s power
slammed uselessly into the demon coffin’s walls. There was a power,
like an abyssal one, absorbing his strikes. He was unable to hurt
the demon coffin.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his Purple-Eye Butterfly. He had a look at the
demon coffin, and he learned that the demon coffin wasn’t a solid
item. Instead, it was being continually formed and fueled by power
coming from the demonic abyss. It was connected to that abyssal and
demonic world. Furthermore, the coffin was now slowly falling into
that place of darkness.</p>
<p>The Suppress Demon Coffin’s demonic air had grown strong,
continually replenished by the streams of darkness coming from the
bird’s nine heads. The eyes of the fiend were unleashing a demon
light, which seemed to be making a path for the demon coffin.</p>
<p>The demon coffin was slowly descending into the dark as
tentacles made from a dark substance pulled it down. Just as
Nine-Headed Bird had said, not even a deified would be able to
escape once they fell into that dark abyss.</p>
<p>“Prince Sixteen, you are so talented. You also have the
protection of the Kingese. You could achieve so much. Why throw
away your life for the Ancient God Origin? You will live a long and
good life, surrounded by many beautiful women. You will reign over
all of the Extreme King. Dying is not worth it,” said the bird’s
head in a tempting tone. It had emerged from the coffin walls
again.</p>
<p>Han Sen found it annoying, so he punched it. The bird’s head
vanished back into the coffin, and Han Sen’s power was absorbed by
the stone walls.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head spun with thoughts. “This demon coffin area is so
weird. I’m afraid ordinary power cannot break it. The Kingese are
strong, but they are still combined with my flesh, which means I
cannot control them. I cannot cast the Kingese beyond my skin.
Relying on the power of the Kingese to break the demon coffin’s
area will be pointless.”</p>
<p>“Nine-Headed Bird, if I go into the demonic abyss, this item
will be useless for you, too. You will lose the Ancient God Origin,
and you will also become an enemy of the Extreme King. Do you want
to be killed?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Others might be afraid of you and the Extreme King, but we
Pirates are not. You should just hand me the Ancient God Origin
while you’re ahead. Otherwise, you’re going to be buried in the
demonic abyss. Extreme King or not, it does not matter to me,”
Nine-Headed Bird laughed sinisterly.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t move, and he said, “Unless the Very High were
supporting you, the Pirates wouldn’t dare to go against the Extreme
King by themselves. You need to think about this. I’m carrying
thousands of Kingese. I’m a genius unlike any the Extreme King have
ever had. Father really loves me. If you bury me in the demonic
abyss, what do you think my father will do? Do you think the Very
High will fight the whole of the Extreme King on your behalf?”</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird went quiet, then hissed, “Do not talk crap!
Give me your Ancient God Origin if you want to live. Otherwise,
even if King Bai himself came here, you would still die in the
demonic abyss.”</p>
<p>“I’m very bad-tempered. I only respond to the nice cop. Trying
to intimidate me like this will never make me hand over the Ancient
God Origin, no matter how dire my circumstances might be.” Han Sen
paused, and then said, “But if you want to make a wager with me,
and I lose, I will give you the Ancient God Origin.”</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird frowned and asked, “What are you
proposing?”</p>
<p>“You have used the Suppress Demon Coffin to trap me. This is
nothing. You and I stand here without dodging. You punch me, and I
punch you. Whoever moves first loses. That will test the real
mettle of a man. If I lose, I will give you the Ancient God
Origin,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird’s eyes flashed. He gave Han Sen a look of scorn
and said, “You have the Kingese body, which makes you stronger than
my half-deified body. Why would I agree to this wager?”</p>
<p>“I won’t use the power of the Kingese. If I use the Kingese
power, I also lose,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Nine-Headed Bird’s eyes flashed. He was
staring at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I promise in King Bai’s good name. If I break my promise, then
King Bai will die,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>When Nine-Headed Bird heard Han Sen use King Bai’s name to make
the promise, he believed him. He still harbored some suspicion,
though. “I’m willing to make this gamble. But I will have to hit
you first. If you move or use your Kingese, then you lose.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Han Sen answered quickly.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird, hearing Han Sen answer him so quickly, grew
even more suspicious. After a moment of thought, he said, “We can
only use our own power to fight. We cannot make use of xenogeneic
treasures.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face paled slightly. He cocked an eyebrow and said,
“Isn’t it normal to make use of xenogeneic treasures?”</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird grinned widely. “Using xenogeneic treasures is
worse than using king areas. You don’t like my Suppress Demon
Coffin area, yet you insist on xenogeneic treasures?”</p>
<p>“About that…” Han Sen’s face still looked worried.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and make your decision. The Suppress Demon Coffin is
on the verge of falling into the demonic abyss. If you do not
decide now, then you won’t be able to turn back.” Nine-Headed Bird
laughed again.</p>
<p>“Sure. I agree, but I will have to take the first swing.” Han
Sen could see that the Suppress Demon Coffin was teetering on the
edge of the demonic abyss, and it made him grit his teeth.</p>
<p>“No, I will hit first,” Nine-Headed Bird replied instantly.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face kept changing, and he didn’t speak. A scary
demonic air had made its way inside the Suppress Demon Coffin. The
coffin warped, and the tentacle-like strand of demonic power was
feeling its way forward, coming for Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Fine. We agree, then!” Han Sen screamed when he saw the dark,
demonic tentacle reaching out lecherously to touch him.</p>
<p>“Heehee, that is it, then.” Nine-Headed Bird snickered. The
Suppress Demon Coffin then opened and Han Sen emerged.</p>
<p>Suppress Demon Coffin was consumed by darkness as the black
tentacles surged up around it and pulled it down into the
black.</p>
