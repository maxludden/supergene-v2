<h2>Fighting Evil Lotus</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2820</h3>

<p>Not long later, Han Sen had killed 30 to 40 Cold Light Charms.
The xenogeneics from the big barren systems were cruel. They knew
they were unable to fight him, but they were not afraid of death.
They fought until the bitter end.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others were as much shocked as they were
happy. They had believed they were going to die, but they were now
more alive than ever. Han Sen had exploded with a strong power that
was beyond the realms of imagination.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder the king went against the people and changed
the rules about taking on a student. With a power of such
magnitude, it was only right you could become the king’s student.”
Meng Lie gave him a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“Mister Holy Baby has such wild strength. Why did you not make
use of it before?” Londo’s voice was buzzing.</p>
<p>Everyone thought Han Sen had gone undercover far too deep. If
this was not a life-or-death moment, it was unlikely that they
would have ever come to learn the true amount of power Han Sen
possessed.</p>
<p>“I am just using the power of my treasure,” Han Sen coldly said.
“It is not my power.”</p>
<p>“Holy Baby, your sword is so scary,” Bao Qin said. “What is that
sword? A deified treasure such as that should be on the rankings
list. How come I have never heard of it before?”</p>
<p>Everyone was talking, but Evil Lotus God coldly laughed. He
spoke one sentence for Han Sen and one for himself. “You really do
have some power. You are worthy for me, a God, to kill you.”</p>
<p>Londo looked disdained and said, “Evil Lotus God, you can cease
your bluffing. With the pottery powder here, you cannot touch me.
Therefore, you cannot touch the Holy Baby either.”</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God’s eyes were full of disdain. “Such an ignorant,
low life creature. The pottery pieces can harm my god body because
it contains the ashes of the Holy Kirin. I do not want to waste
time with this useless, futile matter. Do you guys really think I
cannot deal with the ashes?”</p>
<p>“Come at me, bro, if you think you can.” Londo did not believe
he could, so he was happy to provoke their nemesis.</p>
<p>Everyone thought Evil Lotus God was not able to circumvent the
pottery powder. If he could, he would not have had to spend so much
effort in attracting the ire of so many Cold Light Charms to the
area.</p>
<p>“What a stupid creature!” Evil Lotus God did not bother
explaining. His body suddenly had some purple and white fires claim
him. His eyes crackled and fizzed with the charge of electricity.
They shone with a green and white light.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others were shocked. He felt as if Evil
Lotus God’s body had a scary sense of suppression on it that could
not be explained. It made shocked them to their cores. They
subconsciously fell back. They almost wanted to turn and run.</p>
<p>Looking at the Ghost God-looking Evil Lotus God approach, Second
Uncle shouted, “Get the pottery powder ready!”</p>
<p>Everyone took out the pottery powder. They started throwing it
toward Evil Lotus God. Suddenly, the whole sky was covered with
grey pottery powder. At this time, the pottery flame touched the
purple and white flame. It looked like an ordinary gust of sand. It
was unable to douse Evil Lotus God’s god light.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. The pottery powder was useless against
Evil Lotus God, which was what they were depending on for their
escape.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God walked up to Han Sen and coldly asked, “Is your
name Holy Baby, correct? Your name will be remembered by me, a God.
You had worth in this life.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored what Evil Lotus God was saying. His eyes stared
at Evil Lotus God. He looked as if he was thinking about
something.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others were not able to see the
purple-looking spirit body that looked like an evil ghost’s shadow
inside him. That spirit body gave Han Sen the same feeling as Sky
Vine Radish’s god spirit did.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, Weird. Why does Evil Lotus God give me the same
feeling that his body is just a puppet on strings and the purple,
evil ghost-looking spirit body is his real body?</p>
<p>It was because that purple, evil, ghost spirit body was
protecting Evil Lotus God. That was why the pottery powder was no
longer working. Han Sen still noticed there was something
amiss.</p>
<p>When the purple, evil, ghost spirit bodies appeared, Evil Lotus
God’s lifeforce seemed to fade. One was able to see his blood
vessels stick in his skin. They turned into a green and purplish
color. They looked like the veins that dead men have.</p>
<p>Everyone was now running. Bao Ying, however, could see Han Sen
just standing where he was and so she quickly shouted, “Mister Holy
Baby, run!”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s train of thought was interrupted by Bao Ying. He was
staring at Evil Lotus God, who was 30 feet away from him. He asked,
“Evil Lotus, do you have a death wish?”</p>
<p>Evil Lotus seemed to be annoyed. It looked as if there was some
taboo he had to be aware of, so he stopped talking to him. He
gathered up power. His finger was like a lotus flower that came to
grab Han Sen’s head. If Han Sen was grabbed, his head would
probably have had five holes of blood in it.</p>
<p>Second Uncle heard Bao Ying’s voice and knew it meant that Han
Sen had not fled. He looked back and saw Evil Lotus God was going
to grab Han Sen. The pottery powder in the air was not working on
him.</p>
<p>Although they were not able to see it, Han Sen could see it. The
purple, evil, ghost spirit body moved the same as Evil Lotus God
did. He reached his hand out and grabbed him. The pottery powder
was outside the purple, evil, ghost spirit body.</p>
<p>The heart kept pounding. Han Sen knew that this strike was
extremely dangerous, but he did not hesitate. Han Sen summoned Sky
Vine Radish.</p>
<p>A green light giant-looking Sky Vine Radish appeared in front of
Han Sen. A giant fist punched the purple evil ghost spirit
body.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God did not expect that would happen. No one expected
that. A universal lowlife creature possessed a god spirit. That
should have been impossible.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God did not have a chance to react. The purple, evil,
ghost spirit body was punched in the face by Sky Vine Radish. A
purple light exploded everywhere. His mangled head flew away.</p>
<p>When the purple, evil, ghost spirit body flew away, Evil Lotus
God’s body flew away with it. The blood in his mouth went soaring
away as well.</p>
<p>Meng Lie and the others were shocked. It was unbelievable what
their eyes had seen. They thought their eyes had gone funny.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God was overpowering in the face of Han Sen, but Han
Sen had not moved. He had not even raised his hand. All he did was
look at Evil Lotus God, and Evil Lotus God spat out blood and flew
away.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! What did I see? Holy Baby… He… What did he do? He
used his eyes to kill a god…” Meng Lie lost his voice and screamed.
This was far too difficult for them to believe.</p>
<p>Second Uncle Bai Buyi was shocked as well. Londo and the others
did not know what a god meant anymore. They thought they were
strong deifieds, but they knew for sure that a god was not just
stronger than deifieds. Only the true god elites in the universe
were able to fight against gods, and they could barely stand a
chance. They did not know if they could battle and defeat a
god.</p>
<p>Second Uncle would have never dreamed that in this universe,
there was a creature that could use their eyes to make a god fly
away in a spray of blood. It was like a fairytale.</p>
<p>Bai Buyi felt as if what he had just seen was the same as if he
was watching Han Sen kill Very High Leader. That was supposedly an
impossible task. Now, something impossible to happen had just
happened, and it happened right in front of him.</p>
