<!--Blood God Dragon: Mutant god class (ultimate mode)-->
<!--Gene skills: Blood dragon flying into the sky, dragon consummation, god-blood change--></div>
<p>The blood god dragon’s three gene skills were very good. They
were similar to the gold wing peacock king, but the blood god
dragon had the blood dragon god-pulse buff. The golden wing peacock
king’s combat prowess was far inferior.</p>
<p>Han Sen originally planned on using the Cast God Court to make a
God Spirit gene race, but he knew doing that would take a long
time. The battles were going to start soon, so he delayed his
plans.</p>
<p>The three days flew by. Feng Fei Fei’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse
was not from Jade Wall City, so she left Jade Wall City to
participate in the god fights.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu used it as an excuse to depart Jade Wall City for a
time and returned to Wu Wei Dao Palace. Before she went, Li Bing Yu
believed she could kill Qin Bai and destroy the bloodline of the
Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>In fact, she had many chances. After she learned more about Han
Sen, she realized any attempt she made would not be successful.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen was not around, she would be unable to kill Qin
Bai.</p>
<p>If Jian Bu Gu and Bao’er, with her small flying fish, were
around, she could not accomplish her task. Everyone around her was
insanely powerful.</p>
<p>“Leader, you have returned!” All the members of the palace
witnessed Li Bing Yu’s return. It surprised them. Su Ling’er looked
happy.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu said her trip would be dangerous. Her making it back
was enough to make Su Ling’er and the others feel very happy. “Is
the group still good?” Li Bing Yu coldly asked.</p>
<p>“With Teacher Ling here, the party has been fine,” Su Ling’er
replied.</p>
<p>Upon seeing their faces, Li Bing Yu knew something must have
happened.</p>
<p>Back in the day, Jian Bu Gu exiled the Wu Wei Dao Palace out of
the Qin Kingdom. Li Bing Yu’s teacher died in the middle of their
battle. The leader didn’t have a successor in line to succeed him,
so the young Li Bing Yu took over the position of leadership. She
was only 20 years old at the time and shouldered the critical task
of leading the company.</p>
<p>Wu Wei Dao Palace was comprised of nine big sects. Wei Group was
the weakest of them all. For Li Bing Yu to lead Bu Wei Group until
this day took her a lot of effort. The things she had done were
things most people could not imagine. After all, this was a
dog-eat-dog world. Even in the Wu Wei Dao Palace, Bu Wei Group was
the most bullied sect. Students in Bu Wei Group were always
bullied. Li Bing Yu tried her best to change that. Without someone
strong sitting there, it was hard for the group to be considered on
par with the other eight groups. “Su Ling’er, from now on, you will
control Bu Wei Group. You will be the leader for now.” The door to
the Bu Wei Group’s hall was accessed by a token. Li Bing Yu gave Su
Ling’er the token that provided access to the Bu Wei Group.</p>
<p>“Leader, what is this?” Su Ling’er did not take the token. She
sincerely looked at Li Bing Yu.</p>
<p>“I am going to Bu Wei Well,” Li Bing Yu coldly said.</p>
<p>Su Ling’er was shocked. “Leader, you cannot go! It is too
dangerous there. Bu Wei Group has had so many people enter Bu Wei
Well, and none of them made it back out alive. Maybe a thousand
didn’t go inside, but there had to be at least 800.”</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu stopped Su Ling’er from talking any further. Han
Sen’s face kept flashing in her mind. She started to look
determined. “This world is changing. More and more elites are
showing up. If we cannot follow the rhythm of the world, we will
eventually be exiled from it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to go to the Bu Wei Well,” Su Ling’er said.
“There are many other ways to become stronger.”</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu shook her head. “They’re not good enough. Those other
ways cannot make me stronger. Only the gene races of the Bu Wei
Well can push me to be stronger and make me capable of fighting the
elites.”</p>
<p>Su Ling’er wished to say something, but Li Bing Yu stopped her
again.</p>
<p>“With this thing, if I don’t make it out from Bu Wei Well, you
will be Bu Wei Group’s leader.” Li Bing Yu passed the token on to
Su Ling’er. She then turned around and left.</p>
<p>Su Ling’er wished to chase after her, but she heard Li Bing Yu
coldly shout, “Stop it! Do your duty! This is my life, and that is
your life!”</p>
<p>Su Ling’er’s eyes trembled. Seeing the back of Li Bing Yu fade
into the darkness of Bu Wei Group’s farthest reaches, she did not
say another word.</p>
<p>Three days later, the fighting roster was finally available for
all to see.</p>
<p>In front of the light screen, people’s names were everywhere.
Each name had a title. They all had some kind of god associated
with them.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Dollar for his title. The words before his name
were God of Wealth. That meant Dollar’s Blood – Pulse came from God
of Wealth. He was representing God of Wealth.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to look further and saw Bao’er’s Ingot and Feng Yin
Yin’s Lucky also had the additional title of God Wealth too. While
Feng Yin Yin had God of Wealth’s Blood-Pulse, neither Han Sen nor
Bao’er did. He still had the title of God of Wealth all the same.
Han Sen guessed it might have been because of them joining the
fight from the God of Wealth Temple.</p>
<p>Bao’er was very excited. She was checking out her opponent.</p>
<p>The opponent’s name was surprisingly ordinary. It was very
normal. It was the sort of name one would not pick out from a list.
None of those gods had fame. Han Sen had never heard of such God
Spirits before. He thought they couldn’t be high-class God Spirits
supporting them.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin’s opponents were the same. Han Sen imagined they
could easily get through the first round of knockouts, so he went
ahead to check out his opponent. He had never heard of his
opponent’s name before either. That being said, the name of the God
Spirit supporting his opponent was a name Han Sen was familiar
with.</p>
<p>It was Empty God. It was one of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits
that were space elements, but it was not an absolute space element.
It also had the buffs of a mysterious element. It was the most
mysterious God Spirit out of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits.</p>
<p>Legends claimed that Empty God was born in the chaos of the sky
and the ground opening. It was a very old and powerful God Spirit.
Now, Empty God was a guardian God Spirit of the Yan Kingdom. The
opponent’s name was Yan Bei Fei. Han Sen could tell he was a royal
of the Yan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen did not know Yan Bei Fei, the man was very
famous in the universe.</p>
<p>When people spoke about the Fei Yan Swordsman, it was something
known by everyone in the seven kingdoms.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei was also looking at the roster list. He noticed his
opponent was Dollar, who belonged to God of Wealth.</p>
<p>“Second Brother, I can’t believe you and I have such a big
difference. I am afraid we can only fight when we are in the top
eight.” A man was at Yan Bei Fei and laughing.</p>
<p>“Yan Dan, this fight will get you up. I will let the world know
that the Yan Kingdom has a new hero too,” Yan Bei Fei looked at the
man with confidence.</p>
<p>“Second Brother, you do not have to say that,” Yan Dan said.
“Your talent and potential are greater than mine. You are stronger
as well. We have a chance.”</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei shook his head. “I checked the roster. If nothing
goes awry, we will encounter Zhuo Dong Lai in the top eight.”</p>
<p>“It’s him!” Yan Dan’s face changed.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei’s eyes looked aflame. “That’s good. I will use all
the power to prevent Zhuo Dong Lai from breaching the top eight. I
will clear a path for you to get to the top four. Do not disappoint
me.”</p>
<p>Yan Dan looked serious. He bowed on the ground and said, “Dan
will go into the top two.”</p>
