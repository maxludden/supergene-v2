<h2>Knife Cuts Ocean Mountain</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2165</h3>

<p>Han Sen continued to grip the handle of the knife as he knelt,
motionless. He was frozen; controlling the knife silk took every
ounce of his concentration.</p>
<p>If he did not focus on the knife silks, they would hit the
mountain instead of traveling the thousands of meters he needed
them to.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s refusal to move made people rather confused, though.
The Sky Palace leader eventually seemed to notice something, and
his eyes went a little wide. “What is that kid doing?”</p>
<p>Many of the Sky Palace students wanted to know the same thing.
They fervently discussed his behavior between themselves.</p>
<p>This cannot be over, surely. He only left one mark?”</p>
<p>“I thought this would be exciting, but he just left behind a
single mark. What profound meaning will that have? Why didn’t he
choose to draw something instead?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’ve been waiting for this for so long!”</p>
<p>All the students were disappointed. After all, the ocean
mountain was a way for departing students to show off their power.
The students thought they would see something truly remarkable, but
it appeared to be over after a single hit.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>As the Sky Palace students continued to talk with each other, a
crisp noise sounded from that mountain. It was as if a stone had
cracked.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately went quiet. They looked towards the ocean
mountain, where they saw Han Sen in that same position. He was
kneeling and holding the knife handle, and he didn’t appear to have
moved at all.</p>
<p>The ocean mountain seemed to be fine, too, which rather
disappointed the students. They had initially believed the noise to
be the sound of Han Sen’s knife moving.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Another noise came, and again it sounded like stone being
broken. This time, everyone heard the sound, and they were able to
tell that it was coming from the point Han Sen had plunged his
knife into. Everyone looked over there.</p>
<p>But most of the observers didn’t have good enough eyesight. Han
Sen was a great distance away, so it was difficult for them to
discern much.</p>
<p>But the Sky Palace leader, the masked woman, and Yun Changkong
saw there were two small cracks near where the mountain and the
handle of the blade were now connected.</p>
<p>That crack extended from the point in which the knife had been
driven through the stone. It was as thin as a single strand of
hair, and it couldn’t have been more than ten centimeters long. It
wasn’t particularly eye-catching, but its presence made their faces
grow pale.</p>
<p>In a jade city, Yu Shanxin suddenly stood up from feeding his
dog Old Wang. He walked over to the city’s tower, and from its top,
he stared at the ocean mountain’s peak strangely.</p>
<p>On Dream Island, the Dream Beast had been sleeping. But now,
from the bushes, he opened his dreamy eyes and looked over to ocean
mountain’s peak, as well.</p>
<p>“What is it? Why is there the sound of a rock cracking?”</p>
<p>“I think Han Sen must have cracked a little of the rock around
him. That should be expected, given that this is Han Sen. Of course
he can crack the ocean stone with his level of power.”</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>As everyone resumed their discussion, the breaking noise
returned. It grew louder and louder each time it was heard, and the
frequency of the booms increased. It made everyone stop breathing.
They all looked towards the peak, keenly curious about whatever was
happening.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>That breaking noise was getting louder and louder. Some of the
students with strong eyesight could now see the crack that extended
from his knife. It was spreading.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder; this is Teacher Han. He has very strong Teeth
powers. He can even break ocean stones.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is a powerful ability. I knew Han Sen wouldn’t just
do one simple strike. He is going to leave a visible crack across
the mountain.”</p>
<p>“It is such an incredible ripping power. There will surely be a
Teeth knifemind left behind, and we can go see it when Han Sen is
done. The people that practice with knives are certainly in
luck.”</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The breaking noises were getting stronger, and it was as if the
mountain was being repeatedly rocked by thunder. The noises were so
loud that they made people’s ears hurt, but it was more of a shock
to their hearts than their ears.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at the peak of ocean mountain in awe. From where
Han Sen had inserted his Ghost Teeth Knife, the crack had spread
ten meters down either side of the mountain, dividing it in
two.</p>
<p>The scariest thing was that the crack was now extending all the
way down the mountain, accelerating as it went. Even Han Sen was
sliding down with it.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>With a sound like cannons going off, the giant mountain was
split in half. The crack had been devastating.</p>
<p>Everyone was frozen by what they saw. The sight of Han Sen
hanging in the air, still clutching his Ghost Teeth Knife, was
mesmerizing. The giant mountain was cut in half beneath his knife,
while he slid down effortlessly with it.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader, the masked woman, and all the elders were
frozen. They stared blankly as the ocean mountain crumbled.</p>
<p>“Ho… ho… holy shit… Are my eyes working correctly? Han Sen cut
down ocean mountain…” A student thought his eyes were going to pop
out of their sockets. It was a struggle to even speak.</p>
<p>“I must be sleeping. This has to be a dream! This could never
happen to ocean mountain.”</p>
<p>“I must be dreaming… I must be dreaming… Old Wu, slap me… Wake
me up…”</p>
<p>POW!</p>
<p>“Ouch! You really f*cking hit me!”</p>
<p>All of the elders came forward, racing to the sides of the
broken mountain. They used their scary powers to grab hold of the
mountain that was now in free fall.</p>
<p>Ocean mountain had always floated in the air because it was
perfectly balanced. Now that it had been cut in half, it had lost
that balance. And so, it slipped and fell.</p>
<p>The elders reached out with their powers to grab the mountain,
but because of the qualities of ocean stone, they couldn’t get a
good grip on it.</p>
<p>The crippled mountain continued falling with a crescendo of
noise, and there was little that the Kings could do to stop it.
There was no way they could hold even half of it.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not expect one strike would have such dramatic
effects. He swore he had only sent his knife silks down that little
hole. When they came into contact with the bug, Han Sen realized
the bug was still alive, and so he pulled back. He had no clue this
was going to transpire.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The two ocean mountains fell, and as they toppled through the
clouds, the clouds rose and spilled everywhere like a tsunami. The
rush of clouds washed over many floating islands. Animals were
scattering everywhere in fear, while items were blown about
everywhere. Sky Palace had been swiftly thrust into chaos.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the clouds were not harmful. They tossed around
light items, but they didn’t injure anyone.</p>
<p>“This… is cheating…” Many students awoke from their daze, and
they all stared at Han Sen in bewilderment.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader actually looked furious. “That b*stard…
Toss him out of Sky Palace! I never want to see him ever
again…”</p>
