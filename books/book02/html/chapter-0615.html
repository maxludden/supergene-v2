    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s palm was not Yin Force and Yang Force. If it was,
      he&#8217;d have been shaken to death by the lobster&#8217;s horrible
      power.
    </p>

    <p>Master Discharge!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had learned this skill to discharge power. He didn&#8217;t employ
      any anti-seismic techniques, but instead borrowed the strength of the
      lobster to go flying a few dozen meters through the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      The power of the lobster was way too strong. Although he had absorbed a
      considerable deal of the power unleashed onto him, he still felt as if his
      ribs and organs had been damaged. Blood spat out from his mouth,
      resembling red flowers in the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      But simply hearing the notification ring in his head made him supremely
      happy.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Hunted: Deadeye Peacock. The Beast Soul Has Been
        Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount Of Super
        Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      But now was not the time for Han Sen to admire his deed and celebrate his
      acquisition of a super beast soul. He held onto the pain in his chest and
      swam upwards.
    </p>

    <p>If he reached the surface, he would live.</p>

    <p>
      Although the lobster was massive, it was a sea creature. Han Sen could
      fly, so if he managed to get airborne, there was nothing the lobster could
      do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had made the lobster furious. The beast grabbed ahold of the
      peacock&#8217;s lifeless body and launched itself towards Han Sen. In an
      instant, it had almost caught up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Silver fox, if you don&#8217;t do anything, we&#8217;re both going
      to die here.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was screaming with alarm as he
      patted the silver fox&#8217;s head to show some anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox looked confused. But then, a silver lightning flickered in
      its eyes, and it jumped away from Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder. It swam
      between its master and the rampaging lobster and unleashed a scary silver
      light.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a moment, the silver light had expanded and weaved its way across the
      entire area like a net.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah!&#8221; Han Sen screamed. The silver fox didn&#8217;t just
      attack the lobster, it attacked Han Sen, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver lightning spread through the water, as if it did not care who
      was friend or foe. Han Sen&#8217;s hair stood up with the shock and more
      blood oozed from his mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now Han Sen knew why the silver fox hadn&#8217;t already used his silver
      lightning. The first thing it would kill wasn&#8217;t the lobster, but Han
      Sen himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lobster received a shock from the lightning, which just angered it
      further. With rage, it turned its attention to attack the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      But before it could be nabbed, the silver critter turned to swim away and
      sped off quickly. Its swimming speed was greater than Han Sen&#8217;s.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that the lobster was attracted to the silver fox gave Han Sen some
      relief, but it worried him, as well. He feared that if the lobster caught
      up, it could very well kill the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was still young, so there was no way its strength would be
      greater than the lobster&#8217;s. The silver lightning that it cast only
      subdued the lobster for a few brief seconds; its effect wasn&#8217;t as
      strong as the blue light from the peacock had been.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though the fox&#8217;s speed was greater than Han Sen&#8217;s, it
      wasn&#8217;t enough to outpace the lobster. In the blink of an eye the
      pursuer jumped forward, almost as if it teleported, in front of the silver
      fox.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The silver fox&#8217;s silver lightning was unleashed once again, which
      painted the sea like a canvas of countless thunderbolts. It shocked the
      lobster directly in front of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the time it was shocked and made immobile, the silver fox managed to
      get ahead once again and gain some distance from the lobster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The power of the lightning was not enough to damage the lobster, but it
      was enough to stun it for a brief while. And now, it had already caught up
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox repeated his previous move of unleashing silver lightning,
      but this time, its intensity wasn&#8217;t nearly as high. It was because
      of this, the lobster wasn&#8217;t stunned nearly as effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the lobster caught up to the silver fox the third time, the lightning
      could not stun it. Following the weakened discharge, a purple pincer came
      bearing down on the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox bravely dodged the clinch of its pursuer&#8217;s pincers,
      but it still suffered a hearty jab and was sent careering through the
      water. With its small body, it was not dissimilar to a cannonball,
      surrounded by bubbles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen bit down on his teeth and summoned his Golden Rock Worm King and
      its berserk super pet armor. He threw the worm king in front of the silver
      fox as the lobster raced forward to finish it off.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The Golden Rock Worm King, wearing the berserk super pet armor, lasted a
      mere three seconds after it found itself between the crushing force of the
      lobster&#8217;s pincers. Being unable to fight back, it was cut in half
      and cast away, destroying the beast soul forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      But with the time its sacrifice bought, the silver fox managed to claw its
      way another few dozen meters in a bid to reach the surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen swam as quickly as he could, too. He may have been able to use the
      Golden Rock Worm King and pet armor to save the silver fox this time, but
      now that it was gone, there wouldn&#8217;t be a second opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he summoned Meowth without the berserk super pet armor, it
      wouldn&#8217;t even be able to block the force of a hit or claw of the
      menacing lobster. It most likely wouldn&#8217;t even buy a millisecond for
      the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My poor Golden Rock Worm King and super pet armor! You have been
      with me for the longest time, surviving so many battles. I can&#8217;t
      believe you were killed by this damn lobster. Do not worry, for I will
      avenge your death. One day, I will slay this lobster and cook it for a
      grand feast in your honor. I&#8217;ll leave some upon your grave,
      too!&#8221; Han Sen was as angry as he was upset, and so he tried to
      console himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was still a chance they could escape, however. But now the lobster
      had caught up with the silver fox again. Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure whether
      or not it was the silver fox&#8217;s lightning that attracted the
      lobster&#8217;s aggro, or if just wanted to hunt another super creature
      instead of a human.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the lobster right on the silver fox&#8217;s heels again made Han
      Sen worry. Even if he tried to help, whatever efforts he made would be
      futile. There was nothing he could do, nor was there anything he could use
      to block the lobster for a short while.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, the silver fox flashed with silver light again. There was
      even lightning coursing through his fur. It looked as if an extra powerful
      thunderbolt had been cooking inside his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lobster was directly in front of the silver fox again, its pincers
      raised as if ready to cut another victim in half.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Silver lightning erupted from the silver fox like a barrage of rockets.
      Its little body accelerated with the sheer force of the attack, and it was
      sent shooting out of the sea, freeing itself from the lobster&#8217;s
      aggression. It was sent a whole six hundred meters.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes!&#8221; Han Sen froze, not having expected the silver
      fox to possess that ability. But now that the silver fox was gone, that
      made Han Sen the lobster&#8217;s target once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not say anything more and instead focused on trying to save
      himself by swimming as fast as he could. Fortunately, the silver fox had
      already drawn the lobster a good distance away, which gave him a head
      start.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What the heck? If I knew it was planning that, I would have gone
      much earlier!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart soured, only being able to flee
      for his life. He prayed he&#8217;d be able to escape the sea before the
      lobster caught up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wished he could grow a few extra arms and legs so he could swim
      with greater speed. With the lobster swimming a few dozen meters every
      second, it may as well have possessed the ability to teleport. It made Han
      Sen bitter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come on, just a little quicker and I&#8217;ll be out of
      here.&#8221; Han Sen saw the light above grow brighter and brighter. But
      as he did, the lobster was getting closer and closer. The possibility of
      the lobster getting to him before he could escape was still all too real.
