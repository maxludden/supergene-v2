<p>Everyone was frozen. They didn’t know what was going on. Han Sen
felt a sharp pain in his heart. He had no clue why the word water
had just stopped above him.</p>
<p>The next second, the symbol on Han Sen’s forehead fired away
from him like a cannonball. It whooshed back up into the sky,
flying into the leaves at the top of the tree and vanishing.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Han Sen was frozen.</p>
<p>Every royal child and guard in King’s Garden stood as still as
stone. They thought they must have been imagining things, and their
eyes were opened wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>The king tree had stood in the center of the Extreme King
territory for billions of years. There had never been a Kingese
that saw its recipient, then high-tailed it back to where it came
from.</p>
<p>“Haha! I cannot go on! I’m laughing too hard! Old Sixteen is way
too funny. The Kingese that fell escaped his clutch.” Prince
Nineteen held his belly while he laughed, tears of mirth welling in
his eyes.</p>
<p>The water Kingese looked like a horny man, seeing a sexy woman
with a great body. It quickly gave chase, but when it got close
enough to see her face, it ran away faster than any rabbit.</p>
<p>“This… what’s going on?” Bai Ling Shuang was shocked. She hadn’t
a clue what was happening.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror squinted her eyes. “It looks like he isn’t actually
Bai Yi. The water Kingese was attracted by the Original Water King
Body, but it noticed that there was a problem. And so, it decided
to run back. I’m pretty sure he is actually Han Sen.”</p>
<p>“What is this? A fallen Kingese can go back?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve never heard of something like this happen
before.”</p>
<p>“Prince Sixteen looks a bit embarrassed. He is like a cooked
duck that can still fly.”</p>
<p>“Haha! Not only that, but he must be the first of the Extreme
King to have a Kingese run away from them.”</p>
<p>The princes and the princesses and the guards all exploded. This
was the first time they had ever heard of such a thing. They were
so hyped, it was as if they had been injected with chicken
blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this was bad. “Did the king tree notice that the
Original Water King Body isn’t really mine? Is that why the Kingese
ran back? If that is the case, many people might become suspicious
of my identity. I have suffered some really bad luck here. If I
knew this might happen, I would have just settled for collecting
some king air and left.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was depressed. As everyone chattered and laughed about
what had happened, the top of the king tree lit up.</p>
<p>The king leaves were suddenly all so bright, and a Kingese fell
down like a sun. It came from the top of the tree, flying down to
Han Sen’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Come! Come! Let us not have something bad this time. Come on!”
Han Sen begged awkwardly. If this went wrong, everyone would know
that there was something wrong with him.</p>
<p>The Kingese symbol fell down. Han Sen could see it, too. That
word was so solid, unbreakable. It was like a stone that had been
made a billion years ago. It said, “Ji.”</p>
<p>“That’s gay, why would I have a word like this? No, no, I’m not
gay at all… It must mean gene or base… It must be… It must be…” Han
Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen honestly didn’t care what the word was, as long as he
had a word.</p>
<p>Everyone who watched this was now looking at Han Sen, trying to
see what was happening. Some were actually hoping that the Kingese
would escape again.</p>
<p>Quickly, the word landed on Han Sen’s head. Everyone held their
breath. They stretched their necks to look at Han Sen’s head and
the Ji word. They wanted to see if it would actually meld into
him.</p>
<p>“Come on! Come down! Don’t make this any worse!” Han Sen was in
a rush. He would have liked to just grab the word, cram it into his
mouth, and swallow it.</p>
<p>It was a shame that grabbing Kingese symbols was impossible,
though. If they could have, the royal children wouldn’t have had to
wait. They would have just grabbed the Kingese by themselves.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept praying in his heart. The word Ji stopped one
centimeter in front of Han Sen’s head. It didn’t actually touch
down on his body.</p>
<p>“Shit! It is playing around with me again.” Han Sen wanted to
cry.</p>
<p>“It stopped… It stopped…” Someone sounded so excited by the
sight. They sounded like a kid that had never traveled abroad
before and was finally going, with the way they screamed. It was
like they were visiting a foreign place.</p>
<p>Prince Sixteen was getting really famous now. He was the first
one to ever be abandoned by a Kingese.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! This is so funny.”</p>
<p>“But why do the Kingese refuse to touch down and meld into
Brother Sixteen’s body?”</p>
<p>The whole of King’s Garden exploded. They had never thought
something like this might happen, but now they were. Their nosy
souls were burning.</p>
<p>Bai Qing Xia, who was closest to Han Sen, was also confused. He
didn’t know what was going on with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Huh? That is weird. The Ji word has stopped, but it hasn’t
left.” Someone noticed this little issue, too.</p>
<p>The Ji word had stopped, but it didn’t escape like the water one
did. It hung above Han Sen’s head as if it was in suspended
animation.</p>
<p>“Brother, what the hell is this? If you are going to come down,
then come down! Leave, if that is what you prefer. Why are you just
hanging around here? There is no half-in, half-out. Are you just
trying to scare me? Whatever it is you want to do, just get it over
with.” Han Sen rolled his eyes and stared at the Ji Kingese. He was
nervous.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought his luck had turned sour. He thought everything
had gone awry. He had drawn too much attention in the Pavilion
already. Now that this had happened, it was difficult for him not
to appear suspicious.</p>
<p>“I need to be an honest person. I will never disguise myself as
someone else again. I cannot deal with this kind of stress.” Han
Sen’s eyes were burning. The Kingese wasn’t moving. It didn’t come
down, and it didn’t go back. It just hung where it was.</p>
<p>Everyone was confused, but somehow, the top of the king tree
became super bright again. Many king leaves lit up like a tapestry
of suns.</p>
<p>Voila!</p>
<p>The suns began to fall like a meteor shower. Many Kingese fell
down from the king tree. They were all coming for Han Sen like a
galactic stream. It was like the stars were spilling forth in his
direction.</p>
<p>“Shit! What is this?” Seeing all these flying Kingese symbols,
Han Sen’s heart felt like it was going to jump out of his
chest.</p>
<p>All of the royal children and guards looked on with wide eyes.
Everyone was petrified.</p>
