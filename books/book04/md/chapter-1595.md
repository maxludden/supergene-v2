  Han Sen and the others were all surprised. They had never heard of the singing voice in the storm calling someone’s name. However, there was no mistaking what the voice was saying now; it was clearly calling Han Sen.

Han Sen grabbed Lin Feng and said, “Wait a minute, something’s wrong.”

Lin Feng shook his head and said, “I have to go no matter what. Otherwise, I’ll never forgive myself.”

“Okay, then I’ll come with you.” Han Sen took a look at the storm outside the cave as he listened to the voice yelling his name. It sounded like a sad girl who was calling for her loved one.

“The thing outside seems to be targeting you. You don’t need to go out there. I’ve lived here for years, and I have my way with the storm. Just wait for me here,” Lin Feng said as he walked out.

Han Sen didn’t stop Lin Feng this time. He said to Little Silver and Little Star, “You guys stay here. I’ll go out with Lin Feng and check.”

“Teacher, the thing outside seems to know you. How about I go out there with you? I’m a spirit, so even if I die, I can still be resurrected,” said Xu Mi.

“No need,” Han Sen called over his shoulder as he left the cave. He opened the umbrella in his hand, sheltering himself and Lin Feng from the wind and sand.

Lin Feng nodded his thanks to Han Sen. He asked, “Where did you find that ring?”

The storm outside was so strong that they couldn’t see or feel anything. There were no visible landmarks to use as reference points in the storm, so they simply needed to pick a direction to walk.

“Where did you find the ring, Bao’er?” Han Sen looked to Bao’er.

Bao’er was lying lazily on Han Sen’s shoulder. She lifted a finger to point out into the storm.

She only picked up that ring because she thought it was pretty. However, she knew that she wouldn’t be getting the ring back now, so she had lost her motivation.

Both Han Sen and Lin Feng were a little shocked at the direction Bao’er was pointing; she was pointing toward the voice in the storm.

“Let’s go and check.” Han Sen walked forward with the umbrella in his hands.

Neither of them said anything. They walked forward in the storm. The farther forward they moved, the stronger the storm became. The pressure on their hands became heavier and heavier.

Fortunately, Han Sen’s body was pretty good, so the pressure didn’t crush him. As they walked, the voice calling to Han Sen became clearer and clearer. It was creepy.

Suddenly, Lin Feng felt that he kicked something. He bent down to touch it, and then he pulled an iron arrow from the sand.

“This is Jiwu’s arrow. There’s his mark on the shaft.” Lin Feng looked much more worried than before.

“Let’s just walk forward. Perhaps he’s right in front of us. He might be trapped by something,” said Han Sen.

The two kept walking, and they kept finding random things along the way. Based on Lin Feng’s speculation, and they all belonged to Jing Jiwu.

They were both very worried as they realized that Jing Jiwu might be in great danger. However, they couldn’t do anything more than keep walking, hoping that they could still save Jing Jiwu.

Suddenly, the storm in front of them weakened, and they could finally see something clear instead of complete darkness in front of them.

Han Sen and Lin Feng saw clearly what was going on in front of them, and their eyes turned red.

There was a giant skeleton in front of them, and it was more than a hundred feet tall and a thousand feet long. It blocked most of the wind and sand, which was why the storm was weaker here than elsewhere.

However, there was also a human being hanging from the skeleton. It was Jing Jiwu.

At this moment, Jing Ji Wu was crucified upon the skeleton. His arms and feet were bleeding, and his eyes were also nailed to the skeleton. He couldn’t look more dead.

“Jiwu!” Lin Feng looked at Jing Jiwu who was nailed to the skeleton. His face darkened, and he clenched his fist hard, driving his nails into his palm.

However, Lin Feng didn’t take one step forward. Instead, he held out an arm and stopped Han Sen from lowering the body down.

“Something’s wrong here. Someone’s trying to lure us over there to ambush us.” Lin Feng said each word quietly, but his voice was trembling. It wasn’t because he was scared, but because he was furious.

“I know, but the only way to lure our enemies out is for us to go in.” Han Sen was also enraged. It didn’t feel good to see that someone he knew had died so tragically.

“Are you sure?” Lin Feng asked, staring at Han Sen.

“There are few in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary who can kill me,” answered Han Sen.

“Okay, let’s go. Let’s go bring back Jiwu’s body,” Lin Feng said while taking large steps toward the skeleton.

Han Sen lifted his Bulwark Umbrella and followed.

Though Han Sen and Lin Feng couldn’t see them, a man and a woman were standing somewhere close to the skeleton, in a place wasn’t affected by the storm at all.

That man looked normal, like an elegant middle-aged man.

However, the woman looked quite unique. Her upper body was that of a woman, but her lower body looked like a centipede, and it was constituted with bones and barbs. Apparently, she was a creature.

“They were tricked.” The women’s eyes gleamed.

“Blood Bone Demon, are you sure you can kill him?” asked the man as he looked at that strange woman.

“Rest assured, Mr. Qing Ya, I’ll definitely kill him for the Chairman. This is Feng Ge desert, and this place belongs to me.” Blood Bone Demon smiled weirdly. “As long as they touch my blood bone puppet, they’ll be doomed. Even God won’t be able to help them.”

“Good. As long as you kill Han Sen, the Chairman will always remember your contribution,” said Qing Ya mildly. He was staring at Han Sen and Lin Feng, who were approaching the skeleton.

Blood Bone Demon’s eyes gleamed, and she licked her lips using her snake-like tongue. She was looking at Han Sen as if looking at a dead man.

“Watch my back as I lower Jiwu’s body,” Lin Feng said as he flew to the skeleton. He summoned a beast soul sword, cutting the bones behind Jing Jiwu, and he caught Jing Jiwu’s body as it fell.

However, just as Lin Feng touched Jing Jiwu’s body, Jing Jiwu’s eyes popped open, and its body wound around Lin Feng like a group of snakes.

And then, bones emerged from Jing Jiwu’s body and locked around Lin Feng like an exoskeleton.

Jing Jiwu’s corpse had been completely twisted, and it looked like a skeleton with lots of blood and flesh.

Lin Feng under the skeleton’s control, and he couldn’t help slashing wildly toward Han Sen. Both of them were terrified.
