<p>Upon reading Lu San Zhi’s report, Steel Scene coldly said, “This
is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Mister Scene, Han Sen has a special connection with the crown
prince,” Lu San Zhi said. “I don’t think taking him down will be as
easy as we initially presumed.”</p>
<p>Steel Scene seemed disdainful. He said, “The Big Qin Kingdom was
built by the likes of us. Our king is a smart man. He is a good
man. He will not allow the crown prince to do ridiculous things. We
must remove this evil person from existence, lest bad things befall
the kingdom through his doing.”</p>
<p>“But the crown prince is in Feng Fei Fei’s castle. There is
nothing we can do.” Lu San Zhi looked troubled.</p>
<p>His face still hurt. He did not dare go to the Feng family’s
household to try and capture them again.</p>
<p>Steel Scene waved his hand. “There is no need to go. If we
really want to kill him, we do not need to take him away. We can
eliminate him from miles away.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Lu San Zhi asked as he looked at Steel Scene
with confusion.</p>
<p>Steel Scene smiled. He randomly took out a gene race. This gene
race was in the shape of a bronze, old person. It was Gong Shu
Zhi’s si ming demon race. “That old guy, Gong Shu Zhi, had a
god-class si ming demon race. He got it from a mysterious land
pulse. It is a fairly rare gene race, and it just so happens to
match my God Spirit Blood-Pulse. I have looked for him many times
to buy it, but he denied my request many times. This time, he came
to me. Now, I have this exclusive si mind demon race. We can try to
use it on Han Sen.”</p>
<p>“I have heard the si mind demon race requires genes from the
victim,” Lu San Zhi said. “Han Sen must be on the defensive now, so
I don’t think obtaining his genes will be easy.” Steel Scene looked
at the si ming demon race with obsession in his eyes. “That was
because it was Gong Shu Zhi using of it. He knows how to dig up
land pulses, but he is rubbish when it comes to using gene races.
The si ming demon race is such a powerful gene race, yet it was
squandered by this pathetic inability to wield it correctly. If he
was half-decent, Feng Fei Fei would not be alive.”</p>
<p>Steel Scene reached out his hand to touch the si ming demon
race. It was like he was touching the skin of a lover. He kept
talking to himself, saying, “The power of a si ming demon race is
not something simple. It is fortunate it matches my God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. I have turned it into an exclusive gene race. That
way, it is more powerful.”</p>
<p>Lu San Zhi looked at the si ming demon race with curiosity. He
had never seen one before. Having a proper look at it now, he saw
that it was in the shape of a man without a face.</p>
<p>When he looked closely, it was not just a simple bronze statue.
The bronze man had some blood vessels. They were like red lines
that were squiggled all over.</p>
<p>“Do you see the red lines?” Steel Scene asked. “That is what
happens after the si ming demon race becomes an exclusive gene
race. It has been improved by my si Blood-Pulse. Now, the si ming
demon race does not require Han Sen’s genes. We can kill him.”</p>
<p>He extended a finger on his right hand and cut it. He was going
to use his own blood. The bronze man did not have eyes, a nose, or
a mouth. He wrote down the words “Han Sen” on it.</p>
<p>He wrote down the Han Sen’s name with his own blood. The bronze
man suddenly flickered with a strange blood light.</p>
<p>The blood light looked contagious. The si ming demon race’s
blood lines lit up. They were getting brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>The si ming demon race kept changing within the weird blood
light. It looked like its shape was morphing into that of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Steel Scene looked cocky. He said, “The real power of the si
ming demon race is like a fate power of sorts. The low tier way to
use it is to obtain the genes of the foe you wish to eliminate. You
can get that from a strand of hair or a flake of dandruff. That is
the lowest level of how this is used. The proper way to use it is
not that hard. You just need the name of your foe. Then, fate power
will work. It will activate the si ming demon race. Of course, it
needs to be the name the opponent always uses. It could be a
nickname. The name is just a symbol of fate. If he uses that symbol
very often, even if it is not the real name, it will be imbued with
the power of fate. It will connect with him.”</p>
<p>“The si ming demon race is so powerful,” Lu San Zhi happily
said. “Han Sen is so going to die now.”</p>
<p>When the blood lines twisted, the bronze person adopted Han
Sen’s face upon its own. Lu San Zhi complimented it, saying, “That
really is Han Sen’s face! Mister has a si ming demon race as an
exclusive gene race. You will be improved. You will be more
powerful than San Gong.” Steel Scene laughed. “His power cannot be
destroyed by the si ming demon race. The si ming demon race is
strong, but it does have a weakness. If the opponent is too strong
or has a powerful God Spirit Blood – Pulse to protect them, the
power of the si ming demon race will not work. It will be
consumed.”</p>
<p>Lu San Zhi immediately looked worried. “I have heard Han Sen
might be a god-blood noble. Will he be immune to the power of the
si ming demon race?”</p>
<p>Steel Scene coldly laughed and said, “Even if he is a god-blood
noble, he will not be as good as my Ice Snow God’s Blood-Pulse.
Plus, I have the si Blood – Pulse in land pulses. With these two
Blood-Pulse boons, even if he is a god-blood noble, he will
die.”</p>
<p>While he was talking, the si ming demon race adopted Han Sen’s
face.</p>
<p>Ice Snow Planet was one of Jade Wall City’s planets. Ice Snow
City was built onto it. The center of it had an ice and snow
temple.</p>
<p>Steel Scene’s family had a god Blood-Pulse from Ice Snow God. He
was able to talk to and combine with Ice Snow God. It was not like
any ordinary God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Even a perfect God Spirit
Blood-Pulse was not as good as the Steel family’s ice snow
Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>That Blood Pulse was inherited, which meant everyone from the
Steel family was born with the ice snow God Spirit Blood-Pulse. If
they wished to combine with Ice Snow God, they had to do it in Ice
Snow God Temple.</p>
<p>There were many land pulses and gene races on Ice Snow Planet.
The Steel family operated Ice Snow Planet, but they did not have
businesses there. It was hard to get rich by depending on
themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding Steel Scene’s family, there had been three
generations. There had also been three generations of generals in
the king’s guard. With a career like that, Ice Snow Planet had
become very rich.</p>
<p>Han Sen was walking on Ice Snow City’s streets. He was going to
the Steel Manor. He saw the nine-foot-tall metal door and a
palace-like building beyond it. Han Sen had a cold smile on his
face.</p>
<p>He did not like trouble. He did not want to trouble others
either. If trouble came knocking on his door, he made sure to end
that trouble and ensure it never came back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Steel Manor was built around Ice Snow God Temple. Han Sen stood
in front of the gates and saw the icy-looking god temple. “Let me
go in. Let me see how strong god-blood nobles are here.” Han Sen
stepped forward. He was headed for the Steel Manor’s doors.Han Sen
was 300 feet away from the gate when the guard started shouting,
“This is Steel Manor! Trespassing is not allowed!”</p>
