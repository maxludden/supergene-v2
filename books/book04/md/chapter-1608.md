  Outer Sky King’s appearance was rather similar to Yu Miao’s. He was a guy, but he was still very pretty.

However, when people saw him, they wouldn’t notice that beauty right away. They’d sense a scary aura.

By merely standing there, it felt as if he was above everyone. It was like everyone and everything had to obey and pledge allegiance. The world followed him, not the other way around.

Even Six Paths did not give off the strong feeling Outer Sky King possessed.

Han Sen couldn’t retreat, though, and the crystal shoe continued bringing him forward. Still, he gathered up power in his Split-Blade and unleashed it towards Outer Sky King’s hand.

When Outer Sky King swung his fist, it seemed to be done at random. But the whole world seemed to follow his will and focus on that punch. It put pressure on Han Sen.

Dong!

The Split-Blade’s powerful cutting power and Han Sen’s own strength did not prove enough to turn away that incoming fist. Han Sen felt as if his strike had come down on a very soft and plush ball. He bounced away, as the enemy’s fist was still incoming.

It is no wonder he is the elder. He is so powerful. Han Sen was shocked. He used his Split-Blade like a sword, wanting to employ his sword skills.

The sword skill he used included Ghost Sword and God’s Retribution’s skills. His swordmind broke through the sky. Han Sen was not a sword skill professional, but his sword skills were strong enough to be considered better than Six Paths’.

The crystal shoe seemed to know it had a strong enemy. And then, it allowed Han Sen to control his body freely so he could fight Outer Sky King effectively.

Outer Sky King, seeing Han Sen slash towards him, looked strange.

Many spirits in Outer Sky had heard about the Endless Abyss Fallen Slaughter. He was powerful, and he was in the top ten on the super geno core leaderboards.

But he had only just scraped into the top ten. Compared to the top five or Outer Sky King, who once managed to achieve first place, he was considerably inferior.

Now that Outer Sky King was fighting, Yu Miao and everyone thought he would kill Fallen Slaughter easily. But things quickly didn’t seem quite like that

Fallen Slaughter was fighting Outer Sky King, and the fists and sword skills exchanged were complicated. Outer Sky King was incredibly strong, and yet it was difficult to determine which of the two was winning. Han Sen was definitely not falling back.

“Weird. Fallen Slaughter uses reckless strength to beat enemies. How can he cast sword skills with such grace?” Upon seeing Han Sen’s skills, the elites from the Yu family thought it was strange.

Fallen Slaughter’s powers came from his body and the dark power he harnessed. He used physical strength for triumph in a similar way to Outer Sky King. The difference was, he just wasn’t as good as the emperor spirit.

Now Fallen Slaughter was using a sword skill that was as good as Outer Sky King’s, and using a swordmind that was as powerful as the one they were witnessing. It was difficult to believe that this was the same Fallen Slaughter they had come to know.

“That is strange. What is happening today is so strange.” The spirits of the Yu family could not understand.

Yu Miao was engaged in watching Han Sen fight, and the more she watched, the more her expression changed. The more she saw of the sword skills and the swordmind, the more she thought it wasn’t Fallen Slaughter—it was Han Sen.

But she did not commit to the belief it was Han Sen. If it was, it’d be truly terrifying. It was difficult to even begin fathoming that it was Han Sen going up against Outer Sky King.

Aside from Han Sen and Outer Sky King, the other fights about the shelter came to a stop. The army of the Wind Song Desert was used to their freedom, and with so many creatures all together in one place, they were getting confused about where they were.

And they really hated Han Sen, so without thinking, they raced over to him.

The super elites of Outer Sky stopped their advance, though. And when the creatures realized the shelter and its occupants were as strong as they were, they calmed down and began stepping away one by one. Not many creatures remained there, then.

Han Sen saw what was happening as he battled Outer Sky King. This was not good. Even if he had strong sword skills, he couldn’t go against the entire shelter.

Plus, the timer for his transformation was limited. He couldn’t stay there for too long.

Han Sen could not beat Outer Sky King in a short amount of time, either. He was fortunate enough to not have been beaten himself yet, but it was too late for him to back out of the fight now.

Han Sen couldn’t let himself get distracted while fighting such a strong opponent. The first time he let himself get distracted, he took a nasty punch. He was sent flying against the palace behind them. He broke a few pillars before coming to a stop.

His body felt as if it was being restrained by a phantom power. It was like his bones were tied up with string. He was now planning on using Destroyer Wolfs charm to aid him in the fight. He couldn’t think about much else, and he thought escaping would be the best he could accomplish right now.

Han Sen got up and tried to run, but after taking one step, the crystal shoe on his foot began pulling him back toward the glass palace.

“Crap! Even if your woman is in there, you should hold on. Why are you still going forward in this situation? I will die and you might too.” Han Sen felt depressed.

The crystal shoe wasn’t alive, of course. And it could not hear what Han Sen had told it. It continued taking him back to the glass palace.

Seeing Han Sen still approach, Outer Sky King frowned. He was ready to kill him.

But he suddenly heard a flurry of katcha noises. The palace that had previously been shut tight was opening wide. The spirits of Outer Sky Shelter were shocked. Even Outer Sky King was, too. His face changed completely.

Han Sen continued running forward. He saw the gate open, and when he did, he heard a strange yet familiar sound.

“Tap! Tap! Tap!”

That was a strange noise to hear in such a situation. Han Sen recognized it as the sound of crystal high heels coming down on hard ground, however. It was similar to the shoe Han Sen wore.

Han Sen felt the crystal shoe then pull him into the palace at an even faster pace. The noise from the palace was becoming faster, too, eventually kicking up into a run to the outside.
