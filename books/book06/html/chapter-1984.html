<p>Old Night Island was very big. There were mountains, forests, and even oceans. Han Sen went there and chased a flying bird. He caught up with it and cut its head off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Xenogeneic Earl Hunted. Forest Bird: Xenogeneic Gene Found.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Han Sen collected the xenogeneic gene from the corpse, then started a fire. He immediately got to eating.</p>

<p>The legless crane flapped its wings, having brought over a few branches. Bubble was hopping all over Han Sen. It was weak, so it couldn’t help much.</p>

<p>“With this Forest Bird, that marks the eighth Earl in four days. This is no faster than going into the Xuanyuan Cave.” Han Sen felt terrible.</p>

<p>Old Night Island was not as good as Han Sen thought it would be, and the xenogeneics he managed to find were fast. The place was so large that it took a long time just to find a single Earl. Han Sen felt as if his plan had completely failed.</p>

<p>Han Sen gave the bird’s body to the legless crane, and he cooked the xenogeneic gene. It was a liver this time. It tasted lovely, and it had a pleasant aroma, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Earl Gene +1”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After eating the whole liver, Han Sen’s Earl gene tally reached twenty-five.</p>

<p>Han Sen brought out the ant queen’s mutant gene. He was used to hearing the announcement saying he did not have enough genes yet.</p>

<p>But this time, Han Sen did not hear that wretched announcement.</p>

<p>“Do I have enough Earl genes now?” Han Sen grinned widely. He quickly started trying to cook the ant queen’s gene in the pot.</p>

<p>Han Sen hadn’t been able to cook the ant queen’s meat before, but now it was boiling. It made Han Sen very happy. After a while, the ant queen’s meat was cooked. Han Sen ate it, and he felt a power course through him.</p>

<p>After Han Sen ate all the meat, he did not hear any of his genes increase. He looked at his stats, and it still said he had twenty-five Earl genes in total. Eating the ant queen did not seem to have increased anything.</p>

<p>But the power of the ant queen’s meat was now inside Han Sen. It wasn’t refined, and it was coursing through Han Sen’s vessels. The power kept traveling through him, until eventually it waned and disappeared.</p>

<p>In Han Sen’s head, a shocking announcement played.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Earl Class Xenogeneic Geno Art Obtained: Ant Queen Mark”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Mutant genes don’t actually increase genes? They give geno arts instead?” Han Sen thought to himself. And then, he followed the path the powers had taken through his body. It was then that he discovered a gold symbol on his body.</p>

<p>Han Sen had seen this gold shape on the ant queen’s body. When this spell began to glow, the creature’s power increased. Han Sen tested it out. Lo and behold, the ant queen’s mark was very effective. It made Earls as strong as Marquises.</p>

<p>That meant the ant queen’s geno art did not need to be practiced, and despite that, Han Sen could be as strong as the creature had been.</p>

<p>Han Sen was so happy. If he found any more mutant genes, he could get the geno arts from the mutant xenogeneics he defeated in battle. He wouldn’t even have to practice with them to become as proficient as possible.</p>

<p>The strongest thing about this new option was that the geno arts came from creatures of a different species. Ordinary people could not learn xenogeneic geno arts. That was what was so special about them.</p>

<p>Even though Han Sen could simulate power with his Dongxuan Sutra, he could only replicate a fraction of their abilities. That was because their bodies were different, so fully accurate simulation was impossible.</p>

<p>It was just like Consume; if Han Sen hadn’t turned into an ant, he wouldn’t have been able to learn the ability.</p>

<p>And Han Sen had still needed to practice Consume. Now he only needed a mutant gene to learn the geno art of a xenogeneic. And because he did not need to practice with it, that made things even better.</p>

<p>“If I can kill a King class or deified mutant xenogeneic, does that mean I can learn the skills right away?” Han Sen thought this could be tremendously powerful.</p>

<p>But the Xuanyuan mutant dragon’s xenogeneic genes were Marquise class. He needed to refine Marquise genes before he could do anything with that one. For the time being, he could not make use of it.</p>

<p>There was a still a while to go before White Jade Jing opened. Han Sen planned to keep killing xenogeneics to earn Earl genes. If he met a mutant xenogeneic, he might learn another xenogeneic geno art.</p>

<p>“Yu Jing, you really won’t regret this?” A group of Sky men surrounded him, and they looked surprised.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Yu Jing said with certainty.</p>

<p>“Good. If you wish to give us your money, we won’t refuse. According to our struck deal just now: if Han Sen can win ten times in a row in the exam, we lose. If he loses just once, then we get all your money.” A Sky man laughed.</p>

<p>Many students of Sky Palace struck this deal with Yu Jing. One of them laughed and said, “Yu Jing, you are bringing this upon yourself. Do not take it out on us if you lose everything.”</p>

<p>“That Han Sen had to be carried up the Road to the Sky. If he can win ten times, that means all our Earl brothers are rubbish.”</p>

<p>Someone patted Yu Jing on the shoulder and smiled. “Thanks. If you have any more great deals to strike, you should seek me out.”</p>

<p>Yu Jing coldly laughed in his heart. “It’s only ten rounds. Unless Han Sen is unlucky enough to face-off against a strong enemy in the beginning, he should be able to reach the top five with ease. Especially with his power. Getting into the top hundred will be nothing.”</p>

<p>But Yu Jing still felt nervous in his heart. This was a very big bet to make. While it was a high risk, there was also a high reward. Winning the gambit meant he would end up with ten times his total wealth.</p>

<p>If he lost, though, he’d go bankrupt.</p>

<p>Yu Jing knew Han Sen was strong, but he was still nervous. When the exam matchups were settled, he took a look at Han Sen’s schedule to see who he’d go up against.</p>

<p>When he looked at the schedule, Yu Jing froze. His face grew pale. There was no color in him, at all, and he almost passed out.</p>

<p>The few Sky that had made a bet with him approached. They looked rather cocky. The leader smiled, touched him on the shoulder, and said, “Yu Jing, you are unlucky. That monster Bamboo is taking part in the exam. And he is Han Sen’s sixth enemy. You are very unlucky. I don’t think God can save you now. Pack up your stuff, we’ll be repoing everything you own soon enough.”</p>

<p>The group of Sky smiled before taking their leave. Yu Jing was still standing there, pale as a g. He wanted to die.</p>
