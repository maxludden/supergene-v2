    <p>
      &#8220;Will you follow me along the path of evolution?&#8221; the man said
      with a cold tone of voice, looking at the rhino.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Roof!&#8221; the rhino responded to the man. Then, it began flying
      towards the metal door. Hovering beside the man, it turned around to look
      at the desert as if it was going to miss the place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man had a smile, and then he brought the rhino to leave. He casually
      looked around and seemed surprised. Just as he was preparing to lead the
      rhino through the door, he scanned the creatures on the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could suddenly feel that the man&#8217;s eyes were aimed at him,
      and there was no chance of him being mistaken about that.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no! Why would I even bother looking at him? This man is
      bringing whoever he wants. Even super creatures would not dare look at
      him. It seems all I ever do is look for trouble!&#8221; Han Sen wanted to
      slap himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earlier, things seemed to be proceeding without trouble for him. But Han
      Sen realized his foolishness in looking the man&#8217;s way, and now, the
      mysterious man had him in his sights.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt incredibly nervous. If he could have run away, he would have
      done so in a heartbeat. But he wasn&#8217;t the only one still pinned down
      to the ground, as the fairy, black-flame phoenix, and green kirin were,
      too. Han Sen&#8217;s chance of escape was slimmer than ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      After seeing Han Sen where he lay, the man looked upon him with interest.
      With a finger, he pointed at him.
    </p>

    <p>A black laser beam fell on Han Sen&#8217;s head.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no! Is this it? Am I going to die?&#8221; Han Sen used all his
      strength to try to dodge out of the way, but try as he might, he could not
      move an inch.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The beam of light struck Han Sen&#8217;s head, and his heart felt cold for
      a second.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s karma. I&#8217;ve been smacking people&#8217;s heads all
      my life. Now, it is my turn to be smacked in the head. Maybe I deserve
      this, but if I don&#8217;t have a head, will anyone be able to recognize
      who I am when my body is discovered? That&#8217;s to assume my body will
      remain intact; with all these creatures around, I&#8217;ll be chow in
      no-time. I doubt even my bones will remain. Can I not even tell my family
      goodbye?&#8221; Han Sen felt so sad in his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it was then like nothing happened. The beam of light did not crush his
      skull, as expected. He felt no pain at all. It was as if the beam of light
      was nothing but an illusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are my man.&#8221; The man lifted his lips as he spoke, then
      turned around and departed beyond the metal door.
    </p>

    <p>
      The holy rhino followed him inside, and then the door shut. As slowly as
      it first appeared, it now disappeared into nothingness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was finally able to move, and the first thing he did was quickly
      touch his head. Much to his relief, his head was firm, warm, and whole. He
      was super pleased, and so he thought, &#8220;My head is still here. Yay! I
      am not dead.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      But a second later, he spared no time for celebration. He summoned his
      Golden Roarer, and with the fairy alongside, rode over to the sand crater.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t just Han Sen who went there, either. All the creatures,
      black-flame phoenix and green kirin included, raced forward. There were
      some bones and flesh that had been left behind by the rhino. It was the
      meat of a top super creature, and clearly the aim of everyone&#8217;s
      desire.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix and green kirin sprinted there, firing flame and
      thunder as they went. Any creature that attempted to steal from them, they
      killed mercilessly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had the little angel and fairy to protect him, however. And
      quickly, he leapt towards the mound of flesh. He summoned his Death Knell
      and lobbed it into the blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      An idea then sprang upon Han Sen, and he chucked the gourd in there, too.
      Although he didn&#8217;t know whether or not it would have an effect, this
      was a remarkably unique opportunity, and he didn&#8217;t want to let this
      chance pass him by.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix and green kirin jumped towards the meat and began
      devouring it as best they could. Although they ate like mad, they still
      managed to incinerate anything that came close.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy took the time to grab a bite to eat, too. Her little mouth
      worked incredibly quickly to gobble down decent chunks of meat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel had her fair share, as well. So, Han Sen then summoned
      Meowth and let it dine on some.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was currently regretting his decision to leave the silver fox
      behind. If that little silver black hole was here, it would be in ecstasy
      at the prospect of all this food.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rhino was incredibly large. Even though those two monsters were
      slaughtering creatures, others were able to join in and eat from afar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen lay on the ground to have a sip of the blood, but after giving it
      a taste, quickly spat it all out. The blood was like acid, and it almost
      melted his entire mouth and tongue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this? Can only creatures consume this?&#8221; Han Sen was
      disheartened, seeing all the other creatures jovially eat to their
      heart&#8217;s content.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel had no problem, either. It was only Han Sen who was not
      able to take part in eating the rhino&#8217;s remains. Han Sen did not
      want to give up so easily, however. Instead of trying to drink the blood,
      he grabbed a chunk of meat and bit into it. It tasted like lime, and it
      burnt his mouth fiercely. Quickly, he spat it all out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! What is happening?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was
      incredibly sad, and his inability to eat the meat drove him nuts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen remembered a tear had fallen from the rhino. The tear
      seemed as if it had solidified, and he wondered if it was still there.
    </p>

    <p>
      From what Han Sen could recall, it fell into the pool of blood. He snuck
      over to where he had seen it fall and rummaged around for it. If it did
      not melt, then it had to still be there.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, his hands touched something circular. With a quick rebound
      of joy and excitement, he pulled it up.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was indeed the rhino&#8217;s teardrop. It was transparent, and about
      the size of a fist. Although it came out of the blood, it hadn&#8217;t
      been stained by it. Strange, considering Han Sen&#8217;s hand was all
      mucky with the blood it had been submerged in. It was fortunate he was
      wearing beast soul armor, too. If he wasn&#8217;t, he imagined his skin
      would have all melted away by now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen held the tear and felt a lot of energy coursing around inside it.
      The item itself felt incredibly holy. Merely holding it soothed his being,
      as if being in its proximity cleansed him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Now this is some good stuff.&#8221; Han Sen was ecstatic, and he
      carefully pocketed the tear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pulled out a bag and placed some meat inside it, so he could offer
      it to the silver fox when he returned. He couldn&#8217;t let the silver
      fox—the creature that loved to eat so much—go without this sort of food.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen also harbored the desire to see the silver fox grow up
      a little faster. An adult silver fox was sure to be incredibly powerful,
      and if it never grew up, his investment in the little creature would have
      been a waste.
