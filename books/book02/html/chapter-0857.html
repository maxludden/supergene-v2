    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart beat faster and faster, as his kidneys kicked into
      overdrive to produce energy. His body was charged with the element of
      thunder, and the tolling of a bell chimed. The fusion of thunder and sonic
      forces was driven directly into her belly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox exerted more effort than ever before, focusing all it could
      to defend its master. It channeled its energy into an explosive, electric
      charge and fired a lightning thunderbolt towards her face.
    </p>

    <p>
      The combination of these two strikes would have been fatal for most, but
      to Moment Queen, they were little more than a stiff wind.
    </p>

    <p>
      She exuded a holy presence, an aura that graced her armor and shielded
      her. Furthermore, her crown produced a purple mist. The Sonic-Thunder
      Punch with Yin Force could not penetrate the armor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purple mist was able to dissolve the lightning that sought to strike
      her, and not even her hair was ruffled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Better try a new trick, because that one&#8217;s getting old.
      That&#8217;s what you would say, isn&#8217;t it? Now, simmer down and
      cease wasting my time. Pestering me further will only invite a sooner
      death. I have no ardent desire to kill you, not yet. Still, it would be
      ill advised for you to test my patience.&#8221; Moment Queen grabbed Han
      Sen and silver fox, and with a flap of her wings, took off in flight. The
      speed was so dizzyingly fast, the duo felt as if their bones were going to
      snap.
    </p>

    <p>Pang! Pang!</p>

    <p>
      A moment later, Han Sen and the silver fox were thrown to the ground. Such
      was the force, they could do little but writhe around in agony afterwards,
      groaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trying to subdue the savage aching of his bones, Han Sen looked around.
      Moment Queen had brought them back to Moment Shelter, directly beneath the
      boughs of the Jade-Gold Tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Never had Han Sen seen the silver fox, in the time since he witnessed its
      birth, be so angry. It wanted nothing more than to lash out and attack
      Moment Queen, despite the futility of such an action. Fortunately, Han Sen
      was able to keep it from doing so.
    </p>

    <p>
      They knew they were unable to compete with Moment Queen, and attacking her
      would only incite her wrath and lead to a quicker death. If she
      didn&#8217;t want to kill them just yet, there was a chance they could
      make it out of their predicament alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Moment Queen who was standing under the tree. She looked
      upon it in admiration, but she didn&#8217;t speak or do anything. What
      thoughts graced her mind, Han Sen couldn&#8217;t tell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen fingered the gourd in his pocket, suddenly noticing its rapid
      vibrations. It truly did seem ready to be born.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Moment Queen turned around. The unpredictability gave Han Sen
      and the silver fox a jump scare, and they couldn&#8217;t help but take a
      step back.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is no need to fear me. I do not plan on killing you yet. You
      had me as your puppet for a time, so your death will be slow,&#8221;
      Moment Queen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Following my commands was a decision you made. Aside from asking a
      favor from time to time, I didn&#8217;t mistreat you. Why don&#8217;t we
      just go our separate ways, let bygones be bygones, and never see each
      other again?&#8221; Han Sen looked up and into her cold eyes. Then, he
      continued by saying, &#8220;If you think your service to me was unfair,
      how about we reverse roles for a time? Give me a task or two.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Unfair?&#8221; Moment Queen looked angry, and continued to
      elaborate, &#8220;Killing you is the only thing that can make us even. You
      deserved to die the moment you approached the gates of my shelter. You
      deserved to die the moment you asserted yourself as my master.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Calm down; with the treasure you have, the contract has already
      been destroyed.&#8221; Han Sen went on, &#8220;I have seen a lot today,
      and I didn&#8217;t expect a tree could grow armaments such as those you
      obtained. How did you learn what it took to grow such sacred items?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sacred items?&#8221; Moment Queen&#8217;s faced looked both mocking
      and scornful. She looked back to the Jade-Gold Tree and continued her
      dialogue, &#8220;Ignorant fool. They aren&#8217;t sacred items; they are
      Geno Seeds. I brought them here from my time in Third God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary. Do you really think something of such power exists here, in
      this place?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen. He had heard about Geno Seeds before; it was something
      Ji Yanran and Annie had spoken of. But there was no way for them to ever
      appear in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, so this possibility never crossed
      Han Sen&#8217;s mind. He merely believed the tree to have birthed items of
      some sanctity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, thinking about it this way, the Jade-Gold Tree was quite similar to
      the description given to him by Ji Yanran. After planting the seeds, they
      grew amazing items: weaponry and defensive armaments, some even grew
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary, Geno Seeds were important. Higher tier
      seeds provided higher tier armor and weapons.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was told that the items birthed by Geno Seeds were entirely randomized,
      but Ji Yanran and Annie didn&#8217;t go into too much detail. As such, Han
      Sen never expected the Jade-Gold Tree had grown from a Geno Seed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is no wonder that these items are so powerful, learning that
      these weapons are the boon of a Geno Seed from Third God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary,&#8221; Han Sen said, complimenting the geno gear she had
      obtained.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen coldly laughed and said, &#8220;The reason why the Jade-Gold
      Tree was able to be born was all thanks to you. If it weren&#8217;t for
      you, it would not have been able to grow.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why? What did I have to do with it?&#8221; Han Sen asked, with a
      look of shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen laughed and said, &#8220;You brought that lucky beast here to
      live with us. The seed grows thanks to the luck it bestows. You gave me
      back the hope I thought you had robbed forever.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to slap himself. He shouldn&#8217;t have brought Little
      White here. Now, she was reaping all the benefits and worse yet, his life
      was dangling by a thread. Moment Queen held the scissors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face was full of regret, whereas Moment Queen&#8217;s face
      was one of unbridled joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you have just told me that I helped you, why do you want to kill
      me?&#8221; Han Sen said, as he thought of how he might escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do not worry; I am not going to kill you. But whether or not you
      live is another matter, and that is something that depends entirely on
      you.&#8221; Moment Queen wore a mystic smile.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Please explain what you mean.&#8221; Han Sen frowned.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I want to see if you can survive in Third God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary,&#8221; Moment Queen coldly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought about asking something else, but the Jade-Gold Tree that
      was about one hundred meters high was still growing. There were no more
      chest fruits, but the tree&#8217;s growth hadn&#8217;t stopped. It looked
      as if it was prepared to sunder the skies.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Jade-Gold Tree does not belong in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
      Its birth was inspired by the lucky beast you tamed, but still, it has
      difficulty growing here. The Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary cannot handle
      the energy force it possesses, so it will break the sky and pierce through
      to Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary.&#8221; Moment Queen spoke with excitement,
      looking up at the tree that continued to grow before their eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt the entirety of Purple Mountain quake, and eventually, rise.
      With the mountain set to its trunk, Moment Shelter was lifted from the
      earth below and taken up into the skies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. He was not yet a surpasser, and while entering Third
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary like this gave him a better chance at an initial
      survival, long-term survival did not seem likely. Any ordinary creature in
      Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary would be stronger than Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the Jade-Gold Tree continued to grow, the gourd in Han Sen&#8217;s hand
      became more and more excited. Han Sen could sense its actual feelings of
      happiness.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen had no idea why it felt happy.</p>
