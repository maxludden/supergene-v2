  By this point, Han Sen was very weak. But so too were the three super creatures, who were now robbed of the protection that the now-slain Holy Lightshield Bug had given them.

Han Sen was prepared to allow Little Angel to slay the rest before they left, but a horrible roaring soon sounded. And when he heard it, he sensed the foreboding dread he felt when he first encountered the Devil-Blood King. It must have respawned.

Without hesitation, Han Sen ran out of the shelter under the protection of Little Angel. He brought with him the body of the holy bug and the Life Geno Essence of the witch.

The Devil-Blood King was strangely powerful. Han Sen had barely succeeded with his assassination attempt, and he didn't fancy his chances if he were to fight against him head-to-head. Factoring in his current exhaustion, he thought it best to get out while the getting was good.

After leaving the shelter, he met up with Moment Queen. Wang Yuhang's clothing was tattered and severely bloodied. Still, he gleefully ran up to Han Sen and excitedly asked, "Tell me, bossman: What was your final tally, in your rabid slaying of super creatures on this day? How many beast souls have you amassed?"

"I killed two super creatures and I didn't receive any beast souls." Han Sen shook his head.

Wang Yuhang was severely disappointed upon hearing about the lack of beast souls. "The lint that has accumulated in my coinpurse is not sufficient for the purchasing of another high-class Angel Gene Fluid, you know."

In response, Han Sen said, "Little Uncle, I managed to obtain two Life Geno Essences. One of them is yours. How about I provide you with a high-class Angel Gene Fluid in exchange for your Life Geno Essence? That way, I'll have both."

"I accept." Wang Yuhang agreed without hesitation.

Wang Yuhang previously had two Life Geno Essences, but he believed it was better for him to have the Angel Gene Fluid.

With Angel Gene Fluid, they could continue killing super creatures and hold out for the prospect of better rewards.

Han Sen handed the Angel Gene Fluid he owned over to Wang Yuhang, and then came into possession of two second generation Life Geno Essences.

He fed the holy bug's body to the Spirit Owl and Death Knell, in the hopes they would soon evolve.

Fortunately, these pets did not disappoint Han Sen. After eating the body, they both began evolving, and their battle modes activated.

Now, Han Sen merely hoped they would finish their evolution process before the golden chests matured. If the stars aligned for this, Han Sen had confidence in his ability to protect the tree.

Searching for a safe place, Han Sen refined the two Life Geno Essences inside him. This time, he managed to gain fifteen super geno points, all in all. His total tally reached seventy-eight now.

As Han Sen snuck away to do this, he could hear Wang Yuhang screaming in agony over the shocking healing he had to accept from the silver fox. After what he witnessed last time, the last thing Han Sen wanted was to be healed by the silver blighter, so he always made sure to heal himself with his holy light after a battle.

When they had both recovered from their weakness and exhaustion, they returned to the shelter, wondering if they would have the chance to kill another super creature.

But this time, no matter which way Wang Yuhang attempted to attract the residents of that shelter, they would not come out. After what had happened, the super creatures did not dare leave, and so Han Sen and Wang Yuhang had no choice but to exit the area.

"The Devil-Blood King has fourteen super creatures left. We most certainly can't draw them all out, but if he wants to try to steal the golden chest fruit, he'll definitely have to leave a number of them behind. If so, I really do think I have a chance." Back at Moment Shelter, Han Sen found himself in deep contemplation over the trials to come.

"Bossman, might you tell me which class this shelter of yours is?" Wang Yuhang asked, his eyes glistening with awe as they scanned the surroundings. He was curious about everything.

"It's a king-class shelter, the first one ever gained for humankind," Han Sen said, with a cocky look.

"'Tis a shame, though; I must regretfully confess. Without people to populate its cobbled roads and luxurious palaces, a remote shelter such as this is useless," Wang Yuhang said, upon hearing Han Sen's boast.

"Do you think I need others?" Han Sen laughed, as he looked at silver fox and the rest of his pets.

Wang Yuhang eyed Big Black and Little Black, and his heart sank. He said, "Why do these super creatures follow you around and follow your commands? I am wealthier, smarter, and by all accounts more handsome than you. So, tell me, why are no super creatures inclined to accompany me?"

"It is because I am luckier than you." Han Sen laughed.

Wang Yuhang opened his mouth to speak, but the words never came. Instead, he just gritted his teeth and went to inspect the Jade-Gold Tree.

"What do you suspect will reside inside the golden chests?" Wang Yuhang said, casting a famished gaze at the fruit as saliva drooled from his mouth. He could not wait to see what treasure was inside, either.

"Who knows? But it'll take another two months for it to mature. I suppose we'll find out then," Han Sen said, as he looked at the tree. By now, it was three feet tall.

"And you said this little shrub of yours can lure a number of super creatures?" Wang Yuhang asked.

"You saw what happened with the Empty Vine, yes? This will be even greater, I assure you," Han Sen answered.

"You consider this a good thing? Only the ethereal rulers above know how many crazed super creatures this thing will have descending upon your shelter. The Devil-Blood King and his zealous lot were difficult enough!" Wang Yuhang frowned.

Han Sen knew he'd have great trouble if the Spirit Owl and Death Knell didn't finish evolving, but if they were active and ready to fight by the time that day came, he fancied his chances in repelling an invasion. Still, if he couldn't, he wagered he could simply steal as much fruit as he could before fleeing the zone.

Han Sen and Wang Yuhang both resided in Moment Shelter for the time that remained, but they also returned to the Alliance on occasion. They had to prepare in anticipation of giving the defense of the tree their all.

A few days later, the Purple Mountain below Moment Shelter developed a new spring. The spring didn't flow with water, however. It ran with blood. And it wasn't only one spring, either. All across the mountain, springs popped up; it was as if the very mountain itself was bleeding.

Han Sen went to find out what was going on and examined the blood-red water that came out of the earth. He noted that it smelled like actual blood.

"Bossman, I think a blood spring is a bad omen," Wang Yuhang said, as he looked at the blood spring alongside Han Sen.

"Little Uncle, if I feared bad omens and rotten luck, I wouldn't be standing here with you today." While Han Sen said this, he used his dongxuan aura to scan the blood spring and see what he could learn.

He did not learn anything, strangely. Nothing organic resided within the blood springs, and there was not a single lifeforce to be found.

After finding them all, Han Sen counted a total of seven springs.The blood springs only lasted seven days, and after that, they all ran dry.

The day after the blood springs stopped, menacing clouds formed to conquer the skies. For hundreds of miles around, the clouds roofed the lands encompassing Moment Shelter. A thunderstorm raged for an entire day. And for all those miles around, all the plants were destroyed and burnt to ash. Only the peak of the mountain was okay, save for the suffocating smoke that tainted the air.

After a day of thunderstorms, it began to rain. The rain was torrential and blood-red, too. Countless streams of blood formed at the coming of this rain, and it set the scene as a moody and foreboding one. It was quite terrifying.
