<p>Without the Nine-Spin Destiny Mirror’s power, the group of space
charms rushed forward like the tide.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the space charm Bao’er had become emitted a
horrible crying sound. When that sound spread, the space charms
headed for Han Sen stopped. They all looked at the space charm
Bao’er had become with confusion.</p>
<p>Bao’er continued to emit the crying sounds. After making the
sound, Bao’er said to Han Sen, “Dad, turn the light off.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked but quickly understood what she meant. He
put the stone lantern away and dropped everyone into darkness. Only
the demon girl’s hairpin, with the cross-space-rip, continued to
emit a weird light.</p>
<p>“Sob! Sob!” Bao’er was crying again. That crying sound quickly
spread through the dark. Before long, the crying sound erupted
everywhere in the darkness. Many of the space charms hidden in the
darkness started flying over to their position.</p>
<p>Old Vulture and Eyeless were frozen. They had never seen
anything like this happen. The demon lady was confused too. She had
never heard of another creature being able to turn into a space
charm.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the expressions of the demon lady and the others
changed. The demon lady’s white space charms and the blue space
charms that came out of the dark were all making crying sounds.
They all turned around and flew at them.</p>
<p>The demon lady’s power had generated 30 space charms, but it
seemed as if even more were coming out of the dark. The group of
them flew over. Even Old Vulture was starting to look gloomy.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! What is happening here? Horny Woman, why are your
space charms staging a coup?” Some space charms were headed toward
the eyeless big beast. They kept flying around the eyeless big
beast strangely screaming.</p>
<p>The demon lady looked terrible. She had used her demon lady
powers at their maximum, yet she could not control the space
charms.</p>
<p>Bao’er kept on screaming. Clearly, she was more attractive to
the other space charms. Many space charms were flying toward the
three beasts. They even started attacking the demon lady.</p>
<p>“Dad! Let’s run.” While the demon lady and others were fighting
the space charms, Bao’er, who was still a space charm, pulled Han
Sen in the direction of the holy palace. She kept flying and
screaming at the same time. It made many more space charms fly
toward the demon lady.</p>
<p>“Stop them!” The demon lady was shocked and angry. She wanted to
rush forward and stop them, but the space charms were in the way.
She was not able to go forward.</p>
<p>Old Vulture was the fastest, but the space charms were
surrounding him as well. After he tried his best to get rid of the
space charms, he could no longer catch up with Han Sen and
Bao’er.</p>
<p>The demon lady, Old Vulture, and eyeless big beast kept chasing
them from behind. Han Sen and Bao’er were up front running as fast
as they could while Bao’er made her crying sounds. The space charms
were affected by the noises. They kept running at the demon lady
and others. It stopped the demon lady and the others from chasing
the father and daughter. They were unable to catch up with the two
people.</p>
<p>The father and daughter did not use the stone lantern to light
the way. Han Sen found it hard to block the barren powers. Since
Bao’er had the space charm power, the big barren power did not harm
Han Sen.</p>
<p>The space charms were able to dance in the big barren powers and
not be brought harm. Because of the big barren powers becoming
stronger, the demon lady and the others were affected. It made it
harder for them to chase Han Sen.</p>
<p>Bao’er was pulling Han Sen forward quickly through the dark. Not
long later, in the darkness, there was a dim light. It was the
light of a long, bright lantern.</p>
<p>“This place should be the holy palace. I wonder if Littleflower
is there.” Han Sen was not going to believe what the demon lady and
others had told him. He was only going to believe Littleflower’s
absence if he was there to witness it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>“Do not worry, Dad,” Bao’er said. “We can see my little brother
Littleflower very soon.” She continued pulling Han Sen forward in
flight.</p>
<p>They were getting closer to the light. In the corner of the very
dark world, Han Sen saw a very dim light and an ancient god
temple-looking palace. There was also a big plaza.</p>
<p>The plaza had a long, bright lantern positioned in each of the
four corners. It was just enough to light up the plaza.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen this place before. It was from the video Old
Cat played for him. Littleflower had spent a lot of time practicing
geno arts in that plaza, and he had practiced with Auntie Mei a lot
too.</p>
<p>“This is it! This is the place! Littleflower…” Han Sen shouted
across the plaza, but he received no response.</p>
<p>Eventually, Bao’er led Han Sen to the plaza, but Bao’er was
still a space charm. When her body touched the lights, her body
produced some white smoke. It was like she was vaporizing.</p>
<p>Bao’er immediately returned to her original shape. The effect
was gone.</p>
<p>“Littleflower… Little Brother…” Han Sen and Bao’er were heading
into the palace. They kept shouting, but the place was quiet. There
was not even an echo. They heard no answer.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care for the palace much. It was best if
Littleflower was there, but it was fine if he wasn’t. He was going
to tear down that bullshit holy palace so Sacred could never be
rebuilt with Littleflower.</p>
<p>“Stop it! Whoever comes to the holy palace must die!” Old
Vulture, Eyeless, and the demon lady all shouted, but they were
caught up by the space charm assault. They could not catch up to
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bao’er were already at the front gate of the holy
palace. The old stone door looked like it was very old. It was like
every speck of dust had drowned in a lake of mystical history.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bao’er did not care much for it though. They both
moved forward through the air, landing one big foot and one small
foot against the door. A booming noise sounded. The two stone doors
on the left and right were kicked open by the father and daughter.
Once the door was kicked open, everything that was inside the
palace was revealed.</p>
<p>“You all… You deserve to die…” Old Vulture was so angry that it
was shaking. Its expression looked very murderous, but it was still
a bit far from the holy palace. He tried his best, but he was too
slow to prevent Han Sen and Bao’er from entering the palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen rushed into the big palace and observed everything
around.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was a stone statue. The stone statue was
at the back of the hall’s stone stage. It was like a king that
could rule the whole world was standing there.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that the statue was of Qin Xiu. It was the person
who called himself Sacred Leader.</p>
<p>It was just a statue, but it had the power to look down on the
world. If a creature with a weak will looked at the statue, it
would feel compelled to kowtow before it.</p>
<p>There were two more stone statues next to Qin Xiu’s statue.
There was one on each side of it. The left one displayed a phoenix
and a Holy Kirin. The right side displayed the ghost car and
Nine-Life Cat. They were the four holy beasts of Sacred.</p>
<p>Looking down there were also stone statues of the 10 generals of
Sacred. There was Purple Fight, Ghost Bone, and Purple Eye
Butterfly. All of them looked unique. They each had their own
presence. It looked as if they could come back to life.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The father and daughter stepped closer to the statue. In the
dark, big hall, all the long, bright lanterns lit up. Wan’er’s
statue in Han Sen’s chest was burning up. It felt as if she was
going to jump out of his chest.</p>
