<p>When they had almost left Ancient Big God Mountain, Li Bing Yu
suddenly said, “If it was me, I would not go into town right
now.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen looked at Li Bing Yu with interest.</p>
<p>“Ou Yang Qiu Shan was killed in Ancient Big God Mountain,” Li
Bing Yu said. “He was the only person who had a perfect God Spirit
Blood-Pulse in the past few years. He was the Ou Yang family’s
favorite child. The Ou Yang family will not just let this
slide.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying the Ou Yang family is going to lay the blame of
his death on our feet?” Han Sen quietly asked.</p>
<p>“Someone will be held accountable for this,” Li Bing Yu said.
“Perhaps the Ou Yang family might not do anything to Peaceful, but
it is hard to determine what might happen to the others. Their son
died. They will probably do something to allay their anger.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t have a grudge with Ou Yang Qiu Shan, and we did not
offend him,”Han Sen said with a frown. “Why would they want us
dead?”</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu coldly said, “If a crown prince is murdered out
there, the guards that were in charge of protecting him would all
be killed. Does that make sense to you?”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “I suppose you are right. In that
case, where do you think I should go?” “You can go anywhere, just
avoid Ancient God City,” Li Bing Yu said. Don’t go there again. In
my opinion, you should leave the planet. Ou Yang family members are
only nobles in Ancient God City. Once you have left this planet,
the Ou Yang family will no longer pose a threat to you.” “Do you
think the Ou Yang family is stronger than the blood ghost spirit?”
Han Sen looked at Li Bing Yu and blinked as he spoke. “Regarding
sheer power, the Ou Yang family is not stronger than you, but the
Ou Yang family are nobles of the Qin Kingdom. You, however, are a
nobody in the Qin Kingdom. If there is ever a conflict, even if you
kill the Ou Yang family, you’ll have a lot of trouble in the Qin
Kingdom territories.”</p>
<p>“You are right.” Han Sen was not afraid of the Ou Yang family,
but it would be very troublesome.</p>
<p>“If you need it, I have a way to safely send you to another
planet,” Li Bing Yu said.</p>
<p>After thinking a moment, Han Sen said, “Thank you. But before
that, I need to locate Mister Yang.”</p>
<p>“That will not be difficult. If he is in Ancient God City, I can
ask him to come out and meet with you. But it is not on me whether
or not he wants to meet you.”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu looked at Han Sen and said, “If ordinary people have
to choose between you and Dragon Song City’s Peace family, people
will choose the latter option. If it was you, what would you
do?”</p>
<p>“No matter what, we must bring him back,” Han Sen coldly said.
“If we cannot do that, I will go back to the city myself to find
him.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang knew that Han Sen had come out of a gene egg. He
wanted an explanation as to how that came to be. Han Sen was not
going to just simply leave it alone.</p>
<p>“Fine, I understand. I will bring Mister Yang back,” Li Bing Yu
said. She then turned into smoke and vanished.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu was a very efficient person. Even Han Sen was
surprised. She only took half the day to bring Mister Yang back.
“Mister, you are safe!” Mister Yang was so happy to see Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“I am planning to leave Ancient God Planet.” Han Sen looked at
Mister Yang and asked, “Are you going to follow me or are you going
to stay?” “I already said I would follow you to the ends of the
world,” Mister Yang quickly said. “I will always go with you
wherever.” “In that case, Ghost Kill, please arrange things.” Han
Sen looked at Li Bing Yu as he spoke.</p>
<p>“That will be no problem. Where do you want to go?” Li Bing Yu
was happy. She thought, “If he is going to the Qin Kingdom’s
capital, I can get closer to Crown Prince Qin Bai.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Turin Planet,” Han Sen quietly said.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Hearing that Han Sen did not want to go to the Qin
Kingdom’s capital, Li Bing Yu was disappointed. She did not say
anything negative and simply agreed.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s decision to go to Turin Planet was not a random one.
Legends claimed that the Big Qin Kingdom’s emperor Qin Xiu was born
on Turin Planet. It was Qin Xiu’s home.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu and Qin Wan’er were alleged to have been born there, so
Han Sen thought it was worth scoping out. He hoped to find a lead
there.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Mister Yang operated beneath what Li Bing Yu
prepared. They reached an interstellar cargo ship with Li Bing
Yu.</p>
<p>Traveling in space took a long time. Han Sen found a chance to
browse the internet. He had been researching the content of the
notebook.</p>
<p>After he had a deep session of research, the information he
learned surprised him.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu put Qin Wan’er’s body in a mysterious coffin and sealed
her inside. It preserved her body, keeping her look the same way as
the moment of her death. It prevented her corpse from rotting.
Afterward, he waited for his chance to revive her.</p>
<p>An important officer of the Qin Kingdom was Bai Mo. Qin Xiu
commanded him to find a skill that could resurrect the dead. He
wanted to bring Qin Wan’er back from the dead.</p>
<p>Bai Mo tried many ways to accomplish it, but nothing worked. In
the end, he found some information. That information came from an
old place in the original star. Many things were recorded and too
surprising to believe.</p>
<p>After Bai Mo shared his research, no one dared to believe what
was written, but most of the parts really did exist.</p>
<p>The notebook did not mention what it was, but there was a line
that shocked Han Sen.</p>
<p>Death was just another beginning. Bai Mo must have looked tense
when he wrote that down. His handwriting looked different from how
it was normally. It looked like a fast scrawl. It was easy to tell
how excited he was.</p>
<p>That sentence was something other people would not understand
the meaning of. When Han Sen saw the sentence, he was fairly
confident of his guess.</p>
<p>The content behind it tried to explain what it meant, which was
that energy was forever. It would not disappear. It would just
appear in different shapes.</p>
<p>Humans and the creatures of the universe of kingdoms were
energy. They would not disappear from the universe. When a human
died, they continued with another life.</p>
<p>According to Bai Mo’s research, after a human died, they were
born in another world. If they died in the other world, they would
be born in the universe of kingdoms.</p>
<p>Bai Mo called this energy-changing process “reincarnation.” It
was unknown if it was a coincidence, but Bai Mo called the other
world the antimaterial world. If the creatures from the right world
did not exist in the antimaterial originally, they would be
destroyed if they tried to cross over.</p>
<p>The creatures between the two worlds always believed the
opposing world was the antimaterial world.</p>
<p>This suggestion suited Han Sen. He had guessed this as well.
There was something Han Sen had yet to understand. What role did a
God Spirit play between these two worlds?</p>
<p>The content in the back shocked Han Sen even more when Bai Mo
researched an old faction. He discovered that this old faction had
a relic that opened a path to connect the two worlds.</p>
<p>“The crystal stone!” Han Sen saw the relic on the notebook. It
was in the same shape as the black crystal stone. It was just like
the one he saw on the cave wall.</p>
