	<p>Han Sen chased after Wang Yuhang, and as he went, he sensed countless scary lifeforces making their way towards
		the Empty Vine. They had all been disturbed and made restless by the human intruders.</p>

	<p>There was still a while to go before the Empty Fruit ripened. The group of people had no idea when exactly it
		would mature, and going for them now would only lead to the creatures stopping them. If they picked the fruit
		before it became ripe, the benefits of its consumption would be far weaker, not worth the effort.</p>

	<p>Even Han Sen, who had received help from super creatures in the past, couldn&#8217;t help but feel unnerved and a
		little scared when he sensed the number of creatures in the surrounding area.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hope those people don&#8217;t all die. If they do, how am I supposed to interrogate them?&#8221; Han Sen
		thought to himself.</p>

	<p>Racing across the length of two mountains, Han Sen finally caught up to the fleet-footed Wang Yuhang. The owl did
		not relent in its attacks, and all the while, Wang Yuhang stumbled, tripped, and scrambled on his way. He had
		sustained much damage this time. His armor had been pecked at, and much of it had been broken. His skin had been
		pierced, and blood was drawn.</p>

	<p>Although he wasn&#8217;t heavily injured, his face was one of great pity and remorse.</p>

	<p>Han Sen quickly summoned his little angel to prevent the owl from continuing its pursuit of Wang Yuhang.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Bossman, you have finally come!&#8221; Wang Yuhang shouted excitedly. Not caring for the lesions and
		wounds that riddled his person, he went towards Han Sen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wait! Do not come any closer. Continue drawing its attention while we finish it.&#8221; Han Sen quickly
		stopped Wang Yuhang from approaching him.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang promptly agreed, and with his bow, fired an arrow towards the owl to attract its ire once more. When
		the owl went after him, the little angel was able to quickly get in its way again and block it.</p>

	<p>When Wang Yuhang noticed the owl&#8217;s inability to reach him, he went a little mad. He fired arrows like a
		loon, maniacally cackling, &#8220;Come here, little birdy! I&#8217;m right here! I make for terrific creature
		cuisine, so why do you not attempt to eat me?&#8221; After he had taunted it for some time, the owl stopped and
		made a noise akin to the crying of a baby.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Haha! Crying is of little use, little birdy-bird. Come on, come over here&#8230; Ouch!&#8221; Wang Yuhang
		continued his fun in the provocation of the owl.</p>

	<p>But suddenly, a big rat came out of the ground. It was one foot long, and when it emerged, it leapt up and bit
		his ass. Its razor teeth pierced right through his armor and sunk deep into his plump bottom. When it pulled
		away, a chunk of Wang Yuhang&#8217;s bum-flesh was torn away.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang held his buttocks and screamed, and as he did so, many other black rats emerged from the ground. They
		ran towards him like the tide of the sea.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Does this wretch possess the ability to summon a legion of rats to its devilish will? I beseech
		your aid! Help!&#8221; Wang Yuhang summoned a spear and swung it around crazily. But their numbers were
		unfathomable, and after killing a dozen, he could still see countless more headed his way.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to scan the rats. He was surprised to see that the rats were not actually
		creatures, and as a result, possessed no lifeforce. They must have been direct summons of the owl, an ability
		not unlike the silver beetle mother.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I cannot believe this owl can summon its own little mobs. This is rather interesting.&#8221; Han Sen
		summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and hurried over to the owl. As he went, he called out, &#8220;Little Uncle, hold
		on! I&#8217;m going to kill this bird.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then I beg that you make haste. I shan&#8217;t last very much longer, if something is not done about these
		arse-biters soon. Ouch!&#8221; Another rat bit Wang Yuhang. This time, it leapt up and ripped out a piece of his
		arm.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be right there.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s eyes shone with the light of murder.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>The Flaming Rex Spike was swung upwards, and with the little angel&#8217;s cooperation, it was driven harshly
		against the owl&#8217;s body. The owl was knocked a great distance away.</p>

	<p>The little angel flew forward at once and delivered another slash to the owl. Then, Han Sen used his rex spike to
		hit it again.</p>

	<p>The first-generation owl didn&#8217;t stand a chance, and it was getting destroyed by the duo with no reprieve.
		Feathers fell and blood rained.</p>

	<p>The owl, thinking it best to escape, had its departure prevented by Han Sen. He grabbed onto it, pulling back the
		heavily-injured owl.</p>

	<p>Pat! Pat! Pat!</p>

	<p>Beneath the siege of attacks that were delivered onto it, the owl didn&#8217;t have a single chance of fighting
		back. In minutes, the head of the owl was lopped off by a mighty swing of the little angel&#8217;s greatsword.
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;Super Creature Spirit Owl Killed. Beast Soul Gained. The Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You
			May Harvest Its Life Geno Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno Points
			Randomly.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Han Sen was overjoyed to hear this, as it had been a while since he last received a beast soul. He curiously
		pondered what manner of beast soul it might be.</p>

	<p>And with the death of the owl, the carnivorous rats vanished too. Wang Yuhang looked at Han Sen with much
		surprise and said, &#8220;Bossman, your strength continues to grow greater and greater. It only took you a few
		minutes to lay utter waste to a super creature!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I was taking my time.&#8221; Han Sen smiled at Wang Yuhang and proceeded to say, &#8220;You should go
		home; you should leave this place. As for myself, there is something else I must attend to.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am coming with you. That legion of scum deserves death for what they did to me,&#8221; Wang Yuhang said
		with anger. When his mind went back to his mistreatment, and the time he spent caged, he began to tremble with
		rage.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t worry about that. The scum will all be dead before long, I assure you,&#8221; Han Sen
		said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked with surprise. Then, he asked, &#8220;Do other super creatures inhabit the
		treacherous lands of the vicinity?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, there are loads. If you hate those people that much, and you would like to put your life on the line
		just so you can watch them get brutally torn apart, then let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang&#8217;s face locked up. He looked as if he was about to say something, but just as he was, a black
		flame erupted from the Empty Vine like a volcano.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Um, Bossman? I have a charliehorse; so, I think I&#8217;ll just wait for you down there somewhere&#8230;
		You be careful, okay?&#8221; After saying this, Wang Yuhang hastily made his departure from the island.</p>

	<p>Han Sen decided to take a look at the Spirit Owl beast soul he had acquired. It was another pet-type beast soul.
	</p>

	<p>&#8220;This is interesting. If I raise this owl, I&#8217;ll almost have an army of super creatures at my
		disposal.&#8221; Han Sen was as delighted as he was curious. Still, he knew it would take a while before the pet
		could enter battle-mode.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen was getting the hang of killing super creatures now, and he imagined it wouldn&#8217;t be too much of
		a struggle.</p>

	<p>The Death Knell drank blood, whereas the Spirit Owl ate meat. This meant he could raise them together, without
		any conflict between the two arising.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not have the time to look at the Spirit Owl for long. He returned his gaze to the Empty Vine, and
		when he did, he heard many roars accompanying the clanging sounds of various weaponry. The fight seemed to be
		raging.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hope the Devil-Blood King is already there. If not, that&#8217;d be a pain.&#8221; Han Sen, continuing
		to look at the Empty Vine as he ventured there, was suddenly approached by a few men. It was Manager Qu and a
		few others.</p>

	<p>They didn&#8217;t seem to be doing all that well. They had already injected themselves with the shura liquid, and
		they seemed to be grievously injured.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Han Sen!&#8221; When they saw Han Sen, their faces changed. They knew exactly who he was.</p>
