      “Wait, this is not right. I’m only here to get the goodies. What’s
      happening now?” Han Sen felt rather awkward. He turned and looked at
      Illusion Elder, but Illusion Elder and the others were staring back at
      him. Their eyes, however, looked murderous.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pretty Lady, although you look cute and sweet, and you look as if you
      have my genes, don’t just randomly announce that.” Han Sen wanted to
      explain he had nothing to do with Death Goddess. He didn’t want to be a
      scapegoat Death Goddess had slain so many spirits and creatures, she had a
      vast number of enemies. If he admitted that she was his daughter, the
      entire world would be against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not afraid to face-off against the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, but
      she wasn’t his daughter. He didn’t want to become a scapegoat
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Han Sen could finish, Illusion Elder said angrily, “No wonder we
      were unable to learn anything about her: she is your heir! You made her
      kill creatures all across the Fourth God’s Sanctuary! Tell us why you are
      doing this. Otherwise…”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is no need for talk! We should just kill them both now, before they
      bring permanent harm to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.”
    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, kill them!”</p>
    <p>
      Many elites stepped forward with their geno cores, each possessing a
      frightening power. They wanted to kill Han Sen and Death Goddess both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt terrible. This had nothing to do with him, after all. Even
      though he wasn’t afraid of being Illusion Elder’s enemy, he didn’t want to
      start a war for no reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen tried to further explain, Death Goddess was already drawing her
      black bow. A black arrow was nocked. Death Goddess pulled back the string
      as far as it could go and loosed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raging arrow flew through the sky, driving itself into a super
      creature’s body. The creature had to be larger than an elephant, but when
      the arrow pierced the beast, it exploded and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t disturb me and my father’s reunion!” Death Goddess fired another
      arrow as she glared at the elites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to say something more, but he stopped. People wouldn’t
      believe anything he said now. He could see the anger burning in the crowd
      below, and he knew their minds couldn’t be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Die!” Illusion Elder roared. He lifted an Illusion Disc, which was filled
      with holy light, as he charged towards Han Sen and Death Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>The other three elders and elites were headed straight for them, too.</p>
    <p>
      As the monsters roared, their scary powers landed. Their combined power
      was more intimidating than the attacks of the Armored Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing Han Sen could do. He let Bao’er, Little Silver, and
      Little Star chip in with the fight, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Death Goddess flapped her wings and flew up high. The black bow in her
      hands was flashing. Every time it flashed, an arrow was fired, and another
      creature or spirit was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess was aiming at the powerful Illusion Elder next, but he used
      the disc to block it. That powerful disc geno core was shattered by the
      force of the arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Death Goddess did not relent, as the flashes of arrows came thick and
      fast. She shot down all the creatures and spirits as she arced between
      them. Han Sen was frozen as he watched the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She’s that strong? She is going to be as powerful as Armored Man.” Han
      Sen was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, Death Goddess never missed a shot. Aside from the four elders,
      the other super creatures were killed with a single arrow. Even the four
      elders had to sacrifice their geno cores to avoid being killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess’ arrows were not like Falsified-Sky powers, though. It
      wasn’t as if the skill could never miss, and so it was her proficiency
      that shocked Han Sen. Death Goddess’ arrows had a strong sense of
      prediction. Just like when Han Sen fired his arrows, she was able to
      predict every possibility before letting a shot fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times she appeared to be firing at nothing, but when the arrow
      reached the end of its flight, a creature would appear and get skewered by
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is too much of a coincidence!” Han Sen’s eyes almost fell out of
      their sockets. If Han Sen wasn’t sure he had never been unfaithful and
      hadn’t watched her come out of an egg, he would have been convinced that
      she really was his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen didn’t have time to think much; there were two elders coming
      straight for him. Not even they had expected that they’d have to deal with
      Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whatever. If you guys have a deathwish, don’t take it out on me.” Han Sen
      combined with Fallen Slaughter and summoned his Overbearing Shield and
      Split-Blade. Then, he started his attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Overbearing Shield and Split-Blade put to work, Han Sen was
      practically invincible. He killed a few super creatures in a moment’s
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the confusing thing was that after Han Sen cut a super creature in
      half, he didn’t receive an announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he saw the creatures and spirits that were killed returning from
      deeper within Sunset Valley. Both Han Sen and Death Goddess’ kills were
      returning to the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is this? The spirits can respawn, yes, but why the creatures? How
      can creatures do that? Is that the power of Ancient
    </p>
    <p>Sky Mirror?” The thought crossed Han Sen’s mind.</p>
    <p>
      Seeing Death Goddess keep fighting in the sky, the creatures and elders
      did not change their perspective of the ordeal. They all continued to
      attack as hard as they could, without being dismayed. Before long, Han Sen
      was able to confirm his hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess could not keep fighting the tide of strong elites, and those
      four elders were brutally powerful, too. Death Goddess could be
      destructive, but her body wasn’t invincible. Four Elders could definitely
      destroy her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen heard the sound of flesh being torn. Death Goddess’ armor was cut
      by an elder; it was a strike that led to the flow of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess turned and fired at the elder’s head. The elder disappeared,
      but not long after, he was conning back from Sunset Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used his Overbearing Shield to break a super creature’s skull. He
      held Split-Blade tight and took off running into the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to get rid of the mirror. Not even God could save them if he
      didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen run into Sunset Valley, the elders tried to surround him.
      The super elites came to circle Han Sen, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly became the focus of the battle, and not as many super elites
      were going for Death Goddess now.
