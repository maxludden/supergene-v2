<p>Some journalists felt that the boy looked familiar, but none could think of who he was.</p>

<p>Everyone’s attention was on the silver box.</p>

<p>The silver box rustled and turned into silver liquid, winding up the boy’s body.</p>

<p>In the incredulous look of the audience, the silver liquid turned into the parts of a warframe and armed the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silver Killer&#8230; It is Silver Killer&#8230;&#8221; Finally someone recognized it.</p>

<p>And at this moment, SKTS drew a laser sword and a particle gun, moving toward the Shura warframes like a ghost.</p>

<p>In the explosion, the sound of metal on metal, the sparks, and the gunfire, Silver Killer was killing away. Facing Shura warframes, Silver Killer was like a proud warrior, declaring to the Shuras that humans were the true owner of the land.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em></p>

<p>The laser sword was broken. The particle gun ran out of energy and was thrown at a Shura warframe. With its ammunition exhausted, Silver Killer was still faced with endless enemies.</p>

<p>Everyone was shocked by the incredible visual effect. It was even better than a movie.</p>

<p>But the next scene was even more thrilling.</p>

<p>From the bombarded school, the students rushed out one after another, each holding a silver box engraved &#8220;TS.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the box was turned on, all of them were covered in silver warframes, which then launched fierce attacks on the Shura army.</p>

<p>Warfare between Shura and human was displayed with passionate background music, motivating each audience to join.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>The last frame was focused on the first silver warframe, which blew away a Shura that was trying to attack the girl. The lens was zoomed in on the &#8220;TS&#8221; engraved on the breastplate of the warframe in the end.</p>

<p>A line showed up slowly, with a low male voice reading, &#8220;SKTS by Digang, September 10, Di Garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment of silence when all the journalists looked at the screen with a blank look, Liu Changming appeared once again on the stage. The journalists were raising questions like crazy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Liu, is that a real warframe shown in the commercial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Liu, can a warframe really be compressed into such a small case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Liu, has any special effect been used in the video?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Liu, is SKTS the same warframe that appeared on the Starry Cup?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Liu, that boy driving SKTS must be that Blackhawk student disqualified by Starry Group, right?&#8221;</p>

<br>

<hr />

<br>

<p>Liu Changming lifted his hands to quiet the room down and said quietly, &#8220;See you on September 10.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he did not say one extra word before leaving under the escort of security personnel.</p>

<p>The whole Alliance was in a heated discussion of SKTS. And the commercial had gone viral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shit! That cannot be real!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must all be special effects.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can it be special effects? It will be sold on the 10th&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Silver Killer was the latest super biological warframe SKTS. No wonder it was not on the market—it had not been launched yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Starry Group is rubbish to disqualify the student. How is this a warframe for military use? Everything is clear now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Digang deserves the hype. Amazing stuff!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it really works like this, I need one in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had decided to buy ten when I saw Han Sen at the Starry Cup.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on! They have said it is a limited edition. It is still in question whether you could snag one, let alone ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Digang is playing dirty by showing a virtual image as its selling point. A shame on the military business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, Digang rubbish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yu Qianxun is gorgeous. She has changed her style too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! She is so beautiful. I did not expect she could also perform such a role. A true goddess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Han Sen&#8217;s operation skills are top-notch as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can’t wait for September 10 to come. I&#8217;m so eager to get my hands on this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On September 10 Digang will be humiliated by its own lie. How can we produce something like this with our current tech?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha, I am a Blackhawk student. That is our genius there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The genius is a big shot now, being the new face of Digang.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have always been their spokesperson. Before the new warframe was rumored to be launched, he had used an SKTS already.&#8221;</p>

<br>

<hr />

<br>

<p>SKTS was a total hit. All kinds of experts were analyzing if it was possible to make such a product.</p>

<p>Some experts supported Digang, while some snorted, thinking it was merely a stunt.</p>

<p>The debate was endless and before SKTS was officially sold, the result would remain in suspense, which worked in Digang’s favor, because either way, SKTS had enjoyed unparalleled popularity.</p>

<p>And Digang also released the news about the Digang Warframe Match on September 10, the top three of which could each win an SKTS provided by Digang.</p>

<p>But the applicants needed to be unevolved to be eligible.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes past the announced application time, the application sites on the Skynet were almost out of capacity.</p>
