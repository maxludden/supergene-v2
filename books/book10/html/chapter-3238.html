<p>Qin Yuan had the Demon God Sword. The presence of the sword was like a demon god air that was tearing through the rules of creation. It was like no power was able to dull the sharpness of the sword.</p>

<p>This was the first time Han Sen had seen Break World powers become solid. It meant Han Sen’s Break World power had not become a solid level yet.</p>

<p>Concerning the Break World scales, one could certainly tell Qin Yuan was a whole level stronger than Han Sen.</p>

<p>The Break World level did not truly determine if power was stronger or weaker. Han Sen calmly looked at Qin Yuan and his Demon God Sword. The Dongxuan Sutra was used to break the world again.</p>

<p>The whole universe’s most basic level was in front of Han Sen. The world Han Sen saw now was different from what people and their ordinary eyes saw.</p>

<p>The Demon God Sword was a heavy black sword. It was ridiculously heavy, but its power was truly shocking.</p>

<p>If this was an ordinary person going against it, all they would see was a black and overbearing sword. The sword air, which was like the flames from a demon god, was on the heavy sword.</p>

<p>In Han Sen’s eyes, it was different. From what Han Sen saw, the heavy sword was made of some sort of weird substance chain. It was different from the substances around the place. It just didn’t match.</p>

<p>From what Han Sen sensed, the Demon God Sword did not just exist alone. It had a strong tie with Qin Yuan’s body. The two of them had many connections and ties, all of which one could not see with one’s eyes.</p>

<p>“It looks like the reason Break World power can become solid is for using the Break World power to build your own rules. It is fighting the rules right now. With the solid part as its base, it will be stronger than using Break World powers. You won’t get suppressed by the rules of the universe easily either.” Han Sen now understood the benefits of Break World powers becoming solid.</p>

<p>“Demon God Pierce Through the Heart Sword.” Qin Yuan’s eyes looked cold. He waved his Demon God Sword. The heavy sword moved in an amazing way that ignored the fabric of space. It pierced right through Han Sen’s heart.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s body reacted. For some reason, after dodging, the Demon God Sword had still managed to perforate his chest.</p>

<p>The sword pierced through Han Sen’s muscles and bones. It pierced right through his heart. The back of the sword plunged through to emerge from his back. While Qin Yuan clutched his sword, he coldly said, “It is just like I told you. Even if you have the ability to fight something that can take you up to the sky, today was the day you die. You die here and now.” He made it sound as if this was meant to be and there was no need to worry about it.</p>

<p>“Is this your Break World power? Can it pierce through one’s heart?” Han Sen stood in space and lowered his head. He tried to look at the Demon God Sword in his chest.</p>

<p>IO</p>

<p>“Not bad.” Qin Yuan proudly said, “It does not just puncture one’s heart. If I want to, I can have this sword pierce through anywhere on your body. Even a God Spirit cannot dodge the power of my Demon God Sword.” “It’s such a scary power,” Han Sen said. “If people like you were still living in this world, I would be afraid your opponents would be very busy.”</p>

<p>“My enemies do not need to eat or sleep because they are already all dead,” Qin Yuan said. He pulled the Demon God Sword out of Han Sen’s chest.</p>

<p>“I do not want to be a dead man. Therefore, I must kill you.” Han Sen reached out a hand. He clutched the blade of the Demon God Sword.</p>

<p>“Hmph.” Qin Yuan did not believe what Han Sen had just told him. The power of the Demon God Sword could slash through everything. It was one of the strongest materials in the world. Nothing was able to block how sharp the Demon God Sword was.</p>

<p>Han Sen grabbed the blade. He only needed to pull it and the blade would be broken.</p>

<p>Qin Yuan’s attempt to pull it back failed. The Demon God Sword couldn’t be moved. It made Qin Yuan frown. He gathered up more power to pull the sword back.</p>

<p>The Demon God Sword still failed to move. It was like it was buried amidst a tangle of roots. It made Qin Yuan’s face change. He looked at Han Sen’s hand.</p>

<p>Han Sen was holding the sword in his hand. The part he was holding onto was looking red, and the red color was still spreading. It was like the veins buried beneath the skin were now starting to show. The Demon God Sword’s body had veins spread across it. Han Sen’s hand, which was holding onto it, was at the center.</p>

<p>Qin Yuan felt rather unsafe. He tried his best to pull the Demon God Sword back. He tried his hardest, but the Demon God Sword still wouldn’t budge.</p>

<p>Qin Yuan was even more scared because he was the one who generated the Demon God Sword. Now, he felt his power in the Demon God Sword was blocked. It was like a pipe that was clogged and blocked through concrete.</p>

<p>Han Sen was holding the sword with a face that did not change. His eyes, however, flashed with the colors of the rainbow. The blood power in his hands kept going into the Demon God Sword.</p>

<p>Previously, Han Sen had only wanted to use the Dongxuan Sutra’s power to fight Qin Yuan, but the power of the Demon God Sword struck Han Sen and activated the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power. It enabled him to block the Demon God Sword’s power.</p>

<p>This was the first time Han Sen had used the Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra, two Break World powers, together. With those two Break World powers, Han Sen learned something amazing.</p>

<p>The Break World power of the Dongxuan Sutra enabled him to change the rules. The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s Break World power enabled things to be returned to their origin. When the two powers applied their magic to the Demon God Sword, Han Sen noticed he was able to use the Dongxuan Sutra to slash the connection between the Demon God Sword and Qin Yuan. The Blood-Pulse Sutra, meanwhile, could make the Demon God Sword return to its origin. It was like it was being reborn and was no longer controlled by the whims of Qin Yuan.</p>

<p>Because the Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra had only achieved their Break World powers, their level was not that high. Therefore, modifying the Demon God Sword was not something that could be done in a hurry. Now, only the section Han Sen was holding was modified. Other areas of the sword were still being modified, just at a much slower pace.</p>

<p>Even so, the power of the Demon God Sword was useless to Han Sen. Qin Yuan wanted to use the Demon God Sword’s power to cut Han Sen’s hand, but that was impossible.</p>

<p>Plus, the humans of the universe of kingdoms did not practice. They all depended on outside powers. A solid Break World weapon was generated. That meant people put many powers into their Break World weapons.</p>

<p>Now, a Break World weapon was not working. Qin Yuan had lost half of his power</p>

<p>Since Qin Yuan had lost half of his power, competing via strength seemed unlikely. Even in his best period of time, he could not fight Han Sen with power.</p>

<p>Qin Yuan shouted loudly. He used a power that was kind of like drinking milk. The Demon God Sword, which was still in Han Sen’s hand, could not be moved. The red veins went all over the Demon God Sword.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>When the Demon God Sword was fully red, it shook away Qin Yuan’s hands. Qin Yuan shockingly looked at the Demon God Sword that was in Han Sen’s chest. He could not believe the Demon God Sword he generated could no longer be controlled by him. It even ended up shirking his hand away.</p>
