      Although its name was thunder knife, it was not a knife skill, but a hyper
      geno art that could change the body cells on one&#8217;s hands, especially
      the edge of one&#8217;s hands, making it as sharp as a blade, crushing
      everything in its way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, in the virtual camp, this feature could not be embodied fully.
      However, thunder knife could also enhance one&#8217;s speed greatly, which
      was rather useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her hands slashing like thunder, Qin Xuan was incredibly fast, putting
      great pressure on Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>Crack!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not dodge in time and was hit on his shoulder. His health
      value suddenly went down by 64%, which showed how powerful Qin
      Xuan&#8217;s strike was. Although it was not a vital part that was
      injured, Han Sen still lost more than half of his health in one strike.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeling slightly excited, Han Sen knew it was only in front of a powerful
      opponent that he could truly test whether what he had learned was useful.
      Therefore, the stronger his opponent, the happier he would be.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, his health could no longer pull him through a second strike. Han
      Sen became more careful and started to integrate what he had learned from
      Dongxuan Sutra to his footwork and movements. In the beginning, he was
      somewhat green. When Qin Xuan launched fast attacks using Thunder Knife at
      him, he was trapped in risky situations multiple times. However, as Han
      Sen gradually put what he had learned into use, he was surprised to know
      all the possibilities there were. It was as if he had pushed open the
      gates to the new world, seeing lots of things that he had never imagined
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was more and more immersed in his new discovery. In the beginning,
      he felt his opponent Ms. perfume brought him a lot of pressure. But
      gradually, Han Sen could no longer feel the pressure and became fully
      committed to mastering the technique mentioned in Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      His opponent was not in his eyes. From that moment on, Han Sen&#8217;s
      opponent was no longer Ms. Perfume, but his yearning for the new world.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the beginning, Qin Xuan was very mad, wanting to use whatever she got
      to beat this damned opponent. However, gradually her anger became surprise
      and then respect and astonishment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan found about one fact. Judging from the speed of her opponent, his
      fitness should be lower than hers. Or, he must have lowered his fitness on
      purpose to fight her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even so, her opponent&#8217;s incredible footwork still left no hope for
      Qin Xuan to beat him, because of the large gap between the two of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan had once had this feeling before against some true masters, so
      she naturally thought that her opponent was not an ordinary newbie, but
      some military mogul in disguise. Therefore, Qin Xuan no longer had the
      anger, but wanted to learn something from her opponent, observing the
      footwork and skills of her opponent closely.
    </p>

    <p>
      As she observed, Han Sen became more and more surprised. I wonder who this
      mogul is. His footwork is almost comparable to heavenly go, but it is also
      somewhat different. This is so amazing. When is this footwork developed?
      Is it a new one or some ancient legacy?
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had no idea that Qin Xuan thought he was some military mogul
      playing with her. Continuing to figure out the Dongxuan Sutra, Han Sen was
      very inspired. With his new knowledge, his footwork was now elevated from
      the level of imitating Queen. And he was getting better and better at it.
    </p>

    <p>As Han Sen was excited, he found his opponent had stopped attacking.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at her, puzzled, not understanding why she would pause.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;May I ask who you are, chief?&#8221; Qin Xuan saluted to him and
      asked respectfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s footwork was overwhelming to Qin Xuan, so she thought he
      must be a military mogul.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am no chief, just a soldier,&#8221; Han Sen replied directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no way Qin Xuan would believe him, because a soldier could never
      have such footwork. She had only seen the ability to put incredible
      pressure on the opponent just using footwork in a couple of masters. It
      was not a state that one could achieve with just some hyper geno arts. One
      must have enough cultivation in martial arts to be so impressive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not that cultivated in martial arts. However, given how
      amazing Dongxuan Sutra was, he was able to put such pressure on Qin Xuan
      just by integrating some of the techniques into his footwork, leading her
      to believe that he was a military mogul in disguise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since her opponent did not want to admit it, Qin Xuan did not want to
      force it either. However, she was still fully convinced that Han Sen was a
      military mogul. Watching Han Sen, she asked, &#8220;Comrade, what is the
      name of your footwork? Could you teach it to others?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You want to learn?&#8221; Han Sen was surprised by the request of
      this female soldier named Ms. Perfume.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Qin Xuan nodded.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Obviously, I could teach you that. But it is not a hyper geno art
      that belongs to the military, so I could not teach for free,&#8221; Han
      Sen thought about it and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had only learned a part of it himself so far. Practicing alone, he
      might not be able to tell his own flaws, just like a chess player could
      not be as objective as an observer.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this Ms. Perfume was willing to pay the price, Han Sen did not mind
      teaching her something. It would be nice to experiment on her anyway.
    </p>

    <p>Of course, Han Sen would not tell her the complete techniques.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Name your price, comrade. I will pay as long as I can afford
      it,&#8221; Qin Xuan said hastily. She knew that money could not buy the
      footwork of her opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s make an agreement first. I can only teach you some
      parts of the skill. It is up to you how much you could master.&#8221;
      Since his opponent was sincere, Han Sen did not want to lie to her and put
      the truth forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course. I understand that.&#8221; Because of the way Han Sen
      said it, Qin Xuan was even more convinced that he was a military mogul. It
      was okay for him to instruct her once in a while, but he definitely had no
      time to be her personal tutor.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;All right. If you want to learn, one class is half an hour. I will
      teach, and you shall listen. No question asked. The interval between
      classes is up to me. As for the fee…&#8221; Han Sen hesitated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money was out of the question. His accounts and identity would easily be
      exposed. Staying on Daphne right now, he could not make any face-to-face
      transactions either.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s trade martial art with martial art. For the first
      class, you could give me the tutorial of the hand skills you just used. We
      will talk about future classes later. What do you think?&#8221; Han Sen
      suggested to Qin Xuan, feeling he was asking a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her hand skills were not anything ordinary. By teaching her half an hour,
      he was asking for a hyper geno art that was probably an S-Class art
      designed for evolvers. This price was obviously very high.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Qin Xuan agreed with no hesitation.</p>
