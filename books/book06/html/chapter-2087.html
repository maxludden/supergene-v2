<h2>The Differences Between People</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2087</h3>

<p>The elders shouted at each other, fists clenched and blood
vessels pulsing. It looked like the fight was about to get
physical.</p>
<p>When Bao’er received the ten thousand holy airs, their behavior
left them with little dignity. But when Bao’er asked for Han Sen’s
bounty of holy air, even their pride abandoned them.</p>
<p>Reputation wasn’t worth much, and those old monsters had lived
for so long that they didn’t care about saving face anymore.
Material wealth and power were all that mattered to them.</p>
<p>“To all the elders and leaders, you all have students, sons, and
daughters. I have nothing. You guys are really going to fight with
me over a student?” asked a voice from outside the palace. It was
Yu Shanxin and his dog Old Wang approaching. The man smiled.</p>
<p>His approach silenced the elders for a moment. Yu Shanxin was
half-deified, and it had been a long time since his murder-spree.
But thinking about those days still scared them.</p>
<p>There were a few elders there that only earned their position
because Yu Shanxin had killed the elders before them.</p>
<p>“Yu Shanxin, your geno art is too rare. It is not suitable for
Bao’er. I remember there is a jade-looking Sky that recently had a
baby. That one might be right up your alley.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that jade baby suits you.”</p>
<p>“Shanxin, this girl has so much talent. It’d be a waste for you
to teach her. That jade-looking girl is far more suitable.”</p>
<p>The elders kept on talking, making polite suggestions. They did
not want to offend Yu Shanxin, but they did not want to give up the
prospect of teaching Bao’er, either.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin smiled and opened his mouth to say something, but
then his expression changed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Yu Shanxin, either. The faces of the Sky Palace
leader and all the elders changed. The air warped sinuously, and a
snow-white unicorn beast appeared. Its name was Dream Beast.</p>
<p>“She is mine. Do you guys have a problem with that?” Dream Beast
came next to Bao’er, blinking at her. Then he looked at the
elders.</p>
<p>“Dream… you and she look way too different. She can’t practice
your powers.”</p>
<p>“I’m just here to inform you. I’m not asking for your opinions.
If you don’t like it, you can try to endure ten thousand
nightmares.” Dream Beast ignored their pleas, and then, he turned
to face Han Sen. “Follow me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had been with Dream Beast for a few months, and he knew
full well what the creature was like. He thought if Bao’er was to
follow him, she’d be tortured. Thinking of Bao’er having to dive
into the lake in search of gemstones made him feel sick.</p>
<p>But before Han Sen could make a decision, Bao’er smiled and
leaped onto Dream Beast’s back.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. He was a Dream Beast, not a horse. A King
had called him an old horse once upon a time, and Dream Beast had
put nightmares upon him in return. That King had yet to wake
up.</p>
<p>The maids said the King was crying and crying every day in bed.
They couldn’t imagine what torturous dreams he was enduring.</p>
<p>But Dream Beast seemed fine with Bao’er riding him. He took
Bao’er and left Sky Palace, headed straight for Dream Island.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed. Even though he did not want to return to Dream
Island, Bao’er was already on her way. He needed to know what Dream
Beast was going to do with Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Leader, how can he do such a thing? You should fix this!” When
the elders snapped out of their daze and realized what had just
occurred, they immediately started complaining to the Sky Palace
leader. But even so, no one stopped Dream Beast from taking
Bao’er.</p>
<p>Old Shanxin left with Old Wang. A black and white swallow flew
around him.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader’s shoulders slumped. “If any of you can
get Bao’er back from him, then you are given the right to be her
teacher. I cannot do anything about it.”</p>
<p>The elders looked at each other, wondering who the f*ck would
dare try to take her away from Dream Beast.</p>
<p>Han Sen chased after Dream Beast, but he couldn’t catch up.
Dream Beast took her into the clouds and disappeared.</p>
<p>It was fortunate Han Sen knew where Dream Island was, though,
and he set his course that way.</p>
<p>He was worried about Bao’er suffering under Dream Beast’s
tutelage. If she was just going to spend her days digging up
gemstones, he was determined to take her back.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t let Bao’er endure such suffering, especially at the
hands of an outsider. This was Sky Palace. No matter how strong
Dream Beast was, he couldn’t take Bao’er for a student if Han Sen
did not want her to be there with him.</p>
<p>When Han Sen reached Dream Island, he found Dream Beast and
Bao’er. But things weren’t as Han Sen had feared.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Bao’er would be forced to collect gemstones for
Dream Beast, or that she’d at least endure rough treatment.</p>
<p>But what Han Sen saw was Dream Beast resting beneath the boughs
of a tree. Bao’er was next to him. There was a host of fruit in
front of Bao’er that Han Sen had never seen before, save for
one.</p>
<p>The one Han Sen had seen before was a fruit that looked like a
grape. Yisha had given it to him, and it spurred him on to evolve
and become a noble.</p>
<p>There was a whole bunch of them there for Bao’er. There had to
be at least a dozen of those grapes.</p>
<p>Bao’er picked them up by the stalk, and she started chomping on
them one by one.</p>
<p>“It must be just an illusion. Those cannot be the real Empty
Fruit,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>When Bao’er saw Han Sen approaching, she jumped into his arms
and gave him one of the grapes. “Dad! Come and eat some fruit. The
fruit Dreamy has given me is so tasty.”</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his mouth and ate it. When he bit into it, Han
Sen wanted to cry.</p>
<p>It really was an Empty Fruit. Dream Beast had given them to her
like a snack.</p>
<p>“F<em>ck you! How come when I was here I was a slave, but Bao’er
is given a bunch of Empty Fruits for a snack? This is so not
f</em>cking fair.” On the inside, Han Sen felt like crying.</p>
<p>Dream Beast had not forced Bao’er to stay there, either. He said
Bao’er could come and go as she pleased. He also told her that if
someone wished to bring harm to Bao’er, all she had to do was give
the name to Dream Beast.</p>
<p>“Since when was there such a big difference in treatment between
two people?” Han Sen felt as if he wished to be reborn again.</p>
<p>They relaxed on Dream Island for a day, and then Han Sen took
Bao’er back to Jade Island with him. After resting, he brought
Bao’er to Rainbow Cloud Peak.</p>
