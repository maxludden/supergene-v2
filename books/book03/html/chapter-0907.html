<p>After Han Sen entered the shelter, he went straight for the spirit hall.</p>

<p>The spirit hall&#8217;s defenses were tough. In the plaza were ten ordinary creatures, and two knight class spirits stood outside the spirit hall itself, guarding.</p>

<p>Qing Ming Knight, however, was inside. For a person who had only opened their first gene lock, achieving triumph in the face of such danger seemed like an impossible accomplishment.</p>

<p>But this did not sway Han Sen&#8217;s resolve, and without a shadow of fear, he marched directly towards the spirit hall.</p>

<p>A black tiger was quick to catch sight of the approaching intruder, and so it growled at him in warning.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the tiger and smiled. In the next second, he was clad in summoned armor and wielding a red dagger.</p>

<p>Han Sen swung his dagger towards the tiger&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>Instantly, the tiger&#8217;s decapitated head was sent barreling through the air as blood squirted from the severed throat. In the next second, the body crumpled to the ground.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Ordinary Creature Black Iron Tiger Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Consume Its Flesh To Gain Zero To Ten Ordinary Geno Points Randomly.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Han Sen was quickly overjoyed. He hadn&#8217;t known how sharp or powerful the dagger was, nor its class. But its performance immediately exceeded his expectations.</p>

<p>The spirits and creatures all around were shocked, unable to believe a fight like this could erupt inside the walls of the shelter. And what&#8217;s more, the intruder had started a fight with the creatures that guarded the shelter&#8217;s spirit hall.</p>

<p>The creatures saw Han Sen run inside the plaza, and in unison, they all roared and began sprinting towards him. From every direction they came at him.</p>

<p>A vast array of different elemental powers swirled around and charged the atmosphere with an exciting volatility. There was fire, wind, thunder, and more; and everything was primed to take Han Sen down.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Following an explosion that was a mixture of various elements, a giant crater was left in the plaza&#8217;s floor. Rocks were scattered and strewn all about, as plumes of dust clogged the air and choked the sight of all who were there.</p>

<p>The spirits and creatures were humorously shocked, believing they had just encountered and wiped out the most stupid human they had ever seen. He never stood a chance, they thought to themselves.</p>

<p>Even the spirits that guarded the entrance to the spirit hall looked ahead cockily. They believed the intruder dead, as well.</p>

<p>As the two spirits guarded the gate, they smiled merrily.</p>

<p>For once, they could witness something exciting. And indeed it was, for they viewed Han Sen&#8217;s attack as they would the performance of a clown in a carnival. No human had tried to attack Qing Ming Shelter before, so it was a funny spectacle.</p>

<p>But in the next second, from within the veiling dust, the shadow of a human flickered by each creature.</p>

<p>Acknowledging that their initial attacks had failed, they all activated their gene lock powers.</p>

<p>Amidst the chaos, Han Sen was still sprinting and not even taking the time to dodge.</p>

<p>The combined attacks had indeed all struck Han Sen, but his armor was able to withstand the force and its wearer was not dealt damage.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>Another stream of blood flashed through the air, as an ordinary creature slumped down to the ruined ground.</p>

<p>Han Sen moved like a killing machine amidst the creatures. Like livestock, each creature was mercilessly slaughtered by Han Sen.</p>

<p>The faces of the creatures and spirits that were around all changed. As for the two guards of the spirit hall, they were frozen. No longer were they amusedâ€”now they felt fear.</p>

<p>Multiple powerful creatures had each been killed with a single strike, none being given the chance to fight back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone is attacking the spirit hall!&#8221; An alarm finally sounded from the mouths of the guards.</p>

<p>Qing Ming Knight had already felt it when the first creature had been killed. He frowned and wanted to go take a look at the intruder himself. But soon after stepping forward, he felt another one of his creatures perish. He was surprised.</p>

<p>But then, his face completely changed. One after another, he felt each of his creatures be slain.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this possible? Has someone powerful come to my shelter?&#8221; He could not imagine what sort of person would be able to defeat so many of his creatures in such a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Only royal spirits or mutant creatures could do such a thing, and this was something he could not establish an appropriate defense against.</p>

<p>But his shelter was primarily ruled over by Thorn Shelter. They should have attacked Thorn Shelter, not this place.</p>

<p>Qing Ming Knight sped up his approach as his desire to take a look at what was going on increased. But as he neared the door, it was kicked open with tremendous force. Two shadows flew inside, which made Qing Ming Knight&#8217;s sphincter tighten. They were the knight spirits tasked with guarding the spirit hall.</p>

<p>Their throats had been slit open, and they were thrown through the door, dead before they even hit the ground.</p>

<p>When the attacker entered from beyond that door, Qing Ming Knight was surprised. He said, &#8220;Human?&#8221;</p>

<p>Humans and spirits were different. Qing Ming Knight could tell his intruder was a human, despite being entirely clad in armor with his appearance masked.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can a human come to my shelter?&#8221; Qing Ming Knight could not think straight right now.</p>

<p>There weren&#8217;t many humans in the vicinity, and there were only five in Thorn Shelter in total. But now, someone had just infiltrated his spirit hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Announce yourself, you vermin! He who has dared trespass within my spirit hall.&#8221; Qing Ming Knight held a spear and called out to Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the guy that has come to kill you,&#8221; Han Sen coldly responded. He used Aero, and he flew towards Qing Ming Knight like a rainbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; Qing Ming Knight noticed how low Han Sen&#8217;s speed and strength were, so he raised his green-light spear and dashed forward to engage with his aggressor.</p>
