<p>“A powerful skill. A very powerful skill,” Dragon Thirteen complimented. She looked around, unable to determine where those knife airs were hiding.</p>

<p>“That is too much of a compliment.” Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen continued on to say, “Don’t be so happy too soon. Do you know why the Dragon are called the bravest?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Han Sen had never heard this before.</p>

<p>“You will find out soon enough,” Dragon Thirteen said, and then she spun her black lance. The lance became even sharper, until it turned into a light that fired towards Han Sen.</p>

<p>Countless strands of knife silk cut into her armor. Cracks appeared all over her armor, but no blood seeped out.</p>

<p>Han Sen could see that after the knife silk cut through the armor, her skin still looked crystal-white. There was no evidence of a single wound. Han Sen was shocked by this.</p>

<p>He gathered up more knife silks. They could break a Marquise class armor, but they could not break Dragon Thirteen’s skin. She had a very strong body.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen was like a warrior that was walking boldly over landmines. The landmines kept exploding, but they didn’t hurt her body. She approached, completely unstoppable.</p>

<p>Her lancemind was sharp. Dragon Thirteen came right before Han Sen, with a speed and power that had increased even more. Han Sen was quite exhausted by this point, and he couldn’t evade her attack.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Han Sen’s forehead was pierced through, and his body exploded. Dragon Thirteen only realized then that she had destroyed a simple clone generated by Moon. Han Sen was already distancing himself.</p>

<p>Her face did not change, though. Her lance became a line that attacked Han Sen again.</p>

<p>That attack looked unstoppable, and it was born of bravery. Not even Han Sen knew what to do against that. So, Han Sen used his movement to dodge.</p>

<p>But Dragon Thirteen’s lance was getting faster. And due to Han Sen being bound to the forces of the space, it was even more difficult to dodge.</p>

<p>If they had both been Marquises, Han Sen would not have been so afraid of her. But there was a whole tier separating them. There was a grand gulf of strength between them, as she was undoubtedly one of the top Marquises.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Han Sen got hit, and he was sent shooting through the sky like a star. He thudded into a stone wall and broke it.</p>

<p>“Han Sen, concede now. If I hit you three inches higher, you’d have been a dead man,” Dragon Thirteen said grimly, coming over to the broken wall.</p>

<p>But no answer was received. She frowned. Her face changed. “Oh, no! The mountain has a crevice. He accepted my hit so he could escape through it.”</p>

<p>“What an annoying man. Even in a situation such as this, he had an ulterior scheme.” Sharon shook his head.</p>

<p>“Why are you still talking? Go catch him, and do not let him run off!” The Marquise white tiger roared, shattering the rocks around them. The crevice was revealed more clearly, and the white tiger sprinted went inside.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen and Sharon went in, too. They were going to catch up with Han Sen, somewhere in the gully.</p>

<p>Han Sen traveled through the tunnel quickly. His chest had a hole in it, but he was not bleeding. However, some evil power had entered his wound, and it was permeating his entire body.</p>

<p>“Dragon power is too strong. It is not like Teeth power that could go on forever, but it is far too concentrated. It is difficult to push it out of my body. And I can’t stop and take the time to get rid of it.” Han Sen, clutching his wound, continued fleeing through the cave.</p>

<p>The cave had many alternate routes. Han Sen had to find a place in which he could hide and get rid of the powers inflicted by the lance.</p>

<p>Fortunately, his blood and bones were different than those of an ordinary being. If they hadn’t been, the lance’s power would have destroyed him.</p>

<p>He ran through the caverns for a long time. He felt Dragon Thirteen coming, though, and this confused him.</p>

<p>With the Dongxuan Aura hiding him, she shouldn’t have been able to find him.</p>

<p>“Is it the lance power inside me?” Han Sen thought, realizing the problem.</p>

<p>If that power was still inside him, Dragon Thirteen would be able to track him down. But he currently did not have the time to get rid of it.</p>

<p>If it was just Dragon Thirteen alone, Han Sen would have been willing to give it a shot. But, Sharon and the others were Marquises. It’d be difficult for Han Sen to take them all.</p>

<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth, and he ran to the silver Ancient God statue. If he couldn’t shake his pursuers, he thought he might have better luck by employing the silver glass bug.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew how to get there, and he eventually found his way to the Ghost Face Spider statue. Then, he went behind it and down and through another cave.</p>

<p>Not long after, Dragon Thirteen, with Sharon and the others, arrived at the Ghost Face Spider cave. They saw the sheep-headed Ancient God statue.</p>

<p>“There is an Ancient God statue, but it looks like someone has already claimed it,” Sharon said, while looking at the Ancient God statue.</p>

<p>“Han Sen ran into the Ancient God statue? The Beginning of Ancient God should be on him. If we had known this sooner, we could have just gone and killed him. There’d have been no need for all this trouble.” The White Tiger Marquise wanted to try. He headed toward the statue.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen looked at the cave behind the statue and coldly said, “Han Sen is not inside the statue. He went behind.”</p>

<p>“Then keep up the chase. The Beginning of Ancient God is on him,” Sharon said.</p>

<p>“It is lucky that you left the lance power on him. Otherwise, we’d have been thoroughly fooled. And if we had taken the time to search the statue, he’d have been long gone,” the White Tiger Marquise said happily.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen brought them to the cave behind the statue and continued chasing Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept running, but he was unable to find the strange silver bug. He came to that same waterfall as before, but still, he could not find it.</p>

<p>Before he could think of what to do next, he felt Dragon Thirteen drawing near. He gritted his teeth and fled into the statue. The entrance was in the statue’s belly button.</p>

<p>Han Sen had only been in there for a minute when Dragon Thirteen reached the statue.</p>

<p>“Hey, there is another Ancient God statue! But this one looks different. Is Han Sen here?” The White Tiger Marquise was looking at the silver Ancient God statue.</p>

<p>“He is inside the statue,” Dragon Thirteen said confidently.</p>

<p>“How about this? Thirteen and I chase him down, while you guys wait out here in case he runs back out?” Sharon spoke to White Tiger Marquise and the others.</p>

<p>The White Tiger Marquise nodded. Sharon and Dragon Thirteen entered the waterfall and chased after Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen was starting to feel pain radiating throughout his body. The lance power was like a snake, slithering inside him. If he didn’t flush it out soon, his organs would start to break.</p>
