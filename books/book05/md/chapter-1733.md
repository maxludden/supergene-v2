  A strange power burst out from the officer. It became a blast in the air and then quickly disappeared. After one second, a vortex manifested in the sky. It was light, and the dimensions inside whirled and twisted.

The sky was like a lake with a whirlpool. It was scary, and even elites like Gu Qingcheng frowned.

Stay Up Late’s face changed, and he said, “No! He wants to open the sanctuary gate!”

“What does that mean? I thought it was always open!” Han Yufei asked.

Stay Up Late quickly explained, “The sanctuary is open. But that simply means that it isn’t locked for beings that wish to exit It easy for creatures to leave this universe, as when they generate a geno armor, they can summon and push a gate open. Even if they don’t want to leave.”

“But the door is still closed to creatures from the outside. The door currently only allows travel in one direction. Now that the officer is opening it, creatures on the other side can enter. When the crystallizers went out, that is why they were destroyed.”

Stay Up Late said all this, and then shouted, “Officer, what is it that you want? Do you want to repeat the tragedy that befell the crystallizers?”

The officer looked calm, but his eyes glinted with excitement. He looked at the rumbling sky and said, “Night, you do not understand. We cannot stay here. We have to exit. No matter what we do, it is imperative that I go out.”

“You aren’t just leaving. You are destroying the sanctuary! You do not have to open the door if you wish to go out!” Stay Up Late shouted.

“Why are you still talking to him? Just kill him already.” Xie Qing King jumped towards the officer with a silver light.

The officer waved his fist and blasted Xie Qing King away, though. The silver light shattered as his body fell to the ground and produced a deep crater.

Xie Qing King managed to get back up, but he was bleeding from the corners of his lips.

“He is getting stronger!” Gu Qingcheng’s face changed.

“He used his body to open the gate. He is going to go over the maximum power threshold believed attainable,” Stay Up Late said.

“Didn’t you say geno armor can’t level up? How is he increasing strength like this?” Gu Qingcheng asked.

“I don’t know. His presence is a little strange.” Stay Up Late shook his head, and he looked at the officer who was hovering in the sky.

“We have to kill him to end this.” Little Angel looked calm. She summoned her holy white armor and swung her angel sword. Golden Growler roared, and his golden armor shone. He was charging a roar blast at the officer.

Gu Qingcheng didn’t dare slow down, and she immediately swung her blade.

Ji Yanran’s crystal shoes and Stay Up Late’s Western King Sword were both headed for the same target.

Many scary powers were going converging, but the officer remained motionless. Perhaps it was because he was leveling up, or there was another sinister motive entirely.

Boom!

All that horrendous power went against the officer, producing an explosion that was scarier than a supernova.

Luckily, the impact was wholly in the sky. If it had gone against the ground, the entirety of Planet Roca would have been destroyed.

When the power died off, Stay Up Late was shocked. The officer had not been killed. He hadn’t even been injured.

But his body had experienced a number of weird changes. The Southern King Fire Wings were being eaten by the armor he wore.

They were actually being eaten.

The officer’s black armor had a number of black cracks, like many mouths from hell that were gnawing and gobbling up the wings.

The power they cast had been absorbed by the armor, and that was why nothing had come of their strikes.

“This is the presence of the other race. You…” Stay Up Late’s face changed.

“Yes. Ever since the disaster of the crystallizers, I have searched out the leftovers that destroyed them. After all this time, I have found a way to infuse it with me and make my geno armor more powerful. There is a price to pay, however. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have bothered doing it

The officer was in the sky, looking calm and passionate.

“Why? Why do you have to do this? Does going out mean that much to you? You will destroy the world we live in, just so you can leave?” Stay Up Late looked at him and said.

“Night, you don’t understand. You never will. It’s because you’re not here yet” The officer was being honest.

“Then tell me what it is that you are afraid of!” Stay Up Late shouted.

“What am I afraid of?” The officer looked to the sky, where the vortex whirled. There was some black stuff in there, and it was spreading, like a black hole.

Inside the black hole, something scary was emerging. It sounded like some sordid, frightening beast.

“Officer, you really want the sanctuaries to have a repeat of the first disaster!” Stay Up Late shouted.

The officer laughed and said, “The crystallizer disaster? That was nothing. If we don’t get out, something one million times worse will happen.”

After the officer said that, something roared. A dragon-like creature came out of the black hole.

Everyone’s face changed. Only the officer looked greedy.

“Come! You guys know what this world looks like.” The officer ran to Stay Up Late and touched his shoulder.

The armor on his hand was like a mouth, biting into Stay Up Late’s shoulder. It chomped into Stay Up Late’s flesh and armor. Stay Up Late held back the pain and swung his Western King Sword at the villain.

The officer grabbed it, though. He didn’t break it, but cracks started to form across the blade. They were starting to spread.

Stay Up Late wanted to pull his Western King Sword back, but it wouldn’t budge. And when he gave a firm tug, it went katcha and broke. Half of it was swallowed by the officer’s armor.
