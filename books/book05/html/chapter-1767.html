<h3>Chapter 1767</h3>

<p>Inside a pool of still water, Han Sen lay motionless beneath its
surface. He watched everything that was happening around him.</p>
<p>Since running into the forest, he had run non-stop for the past
four days. He could not keep track of how many Nobles he had
killed, but they just kept on coming. He hadn’t had a moment’s
rest. There were at least five Viscount Nobles giving chase, as
well. After endless fighting, the Dongxuan Armor had incurred many
marks.</p>
<p>But that was nothing to Han Sen. If other Nobles were in his
position, Viscounts included, they’d have been exhausted and dead a
long time ago.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still energized. The Dongxuan Armor absorbed energy
from the very earth to fuel his power. He could keep fighting
without a need for stopping.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to use the Archangel Bone Arrow to kill his
pursuers, but he would need to activate his super god spirit body
to make use of it The energy cost of taking on that form, however,
far outweighed what the armor could put out.</p>
<p>His real enemy was not a Viscount. If he could not kill the
Zhenyue, he would keep on being chased like this.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t bothered returning to the sanctuary, though,
because running away was not his style. A good offense was the best
defense, and what he really needed to do was find the Zhenyue.</p>
<p>Han Sen was taking a ten-minute break, hiding in the pool. He
eventually heard footsteps approach.</p>
<p>“Shit! Where did that *sshole go! How the hell does a Baron have
this much power, endurance, and skill?” growled a rough voice from
close-by.</p>
<p>It was the Viscount with a sword. Han Sen had learned that his
name was Hawei.</p>
<p>Hawei was answered by another, calmer voice. “He might be a
Baron, but he is related to the pirates. He is not like ordinary
Barons, so that is something I can understand.”</p>
<p>“Mister Elephant is getting impatient If we don’t kill him,
we’ll end up being slaughtered for failing,” Hawei said
quietly.</p>
<p>“Maybe not Mister Elephant went to Old Dragon Rock Mountain to
kill that xenogeneic. He won’t be back for a bit. We still have
plenty of time.” The calm voice was speaking again.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard it. He had been running through the xenogeneic
space for a while now, and he had gained some familiarity with the
area.</p>
<p>He had also captured a few Barons and interrogated them for
information, and so he knew about Old Dragon Rock Mountain. He had
never dared venture there, though.</p>
<p>One Baron said that Old Dragon Rock Mountain had a xenogeneic on
it that was of Earl class, and that was something Han Sen wasn’t
exactly keen on provoking.</p>
<p>“Mister Elephant wants to kill an Earl xenogeneic? He has a big
appetite.” Han Sen was coldly laughing to himself.</p>
<p>The higher races said they were the highest in their bracket,
but they were not invincible. Han Sen had guessed Mister Elephant
was a Viscount, and he was indeed very brave to hunt an Earl
xenogeneic.</p>
<p>“Where did he go?” Hawei resumed his search, angrily.</p>
<p>Another Viscount wished to answer, but he suddenly widened his
eyes as he looked into the pool to the left of Hawei. Hawei knew
something had to be wrong, so he pulled his sword out and slashed
blindly toward the water.</p>
<p>Hawei saw Han Sen leap out of the pool and come for him.</p>
<p>“Go to hell!” Hawei used more strength than ever, but he knew
that something was wrong. His angry expression turned worried.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The sword cut Han Sen’s body in half, but Hawei immediately knew
that something wasn’t right. It was just an illusion.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was still in a half-crouch, looking like a beast
ready to pounce. He jumped at Hawei and grabbed his waist, planted
his feet firmly on the ground, and pulled the Viscount into the
water.</p>
<p>Another Viscount came near to the pool and looked into the
water. It was too dirty, and he could not see who was down there.
He couldn’t risk a strike.</p>
<p>He held a bow and aimed at the water instead, unsure of where to
fire.</p>
<p>“Hawei, come out so that I can shoot!” Nicai shouted at the
water.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>A wave formed as someone rose out of the water. Nicai aimed the
bow at the form, then noticed it was Hawei.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, someone else emerged in silence. This
person had two purple swords, both of which were different sizes.
They were coming right for Nicai.</p>
<p>Those two swords were fully serrated, and after all the fighting
thus far, they looked like fangs.</p>
<p>Nicai reacted quickly. He lowered the bow and prepared to
fire.</p>
<p>With so little distance between him and his target, Nicai was
confident Han Sen would not be able to dodge.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t try to dodge, either. He just smiled at the man
and revealed his white teeth. With the swords, he slashed toward
the arrow that was fired.</p>
<p>“Naive.” Nicai laughed in dark amusement</p>
<p>His Viscount weapon was a bow, formed by a Viscount xenogeneic
Black Scale Beast. It was powerful, and a Baron should not have
been able to block it</p>
<p>Han Sen’s swing landed on the arrow, though. The Purple-Moon
Swords had endured much over the last four days, though, and they
shattered into bits of broken glass.</p>
<p>The arrow was still coming, too; it struck Han Sen in the chest.
The arrow pushed Han Sen back down into the water. A bevy of blood
filtered upwards, followed by bubbles.</p>
<p>“Nicai, good job!” Hawei was happy.</p>
<p>But before he could finish, the water exploded. A body flew
towards them like a weird bird.</p>
<p>“Death wish.” Hawei slashed towards it. The waves and the green
light were going to cut Han Sen in half.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the air with a Gold Feather Bow. And he had
somehow taken Nicai’s arrow to use as his own.</p>
<p>Boing!</p>
<p>The string made a noise as the arrow flew directly toward
Hawei.</p>
<p>Hawei was immediately frightened. He gave up on Han Sen and
tried striking the arrow.</p>
<p>Over the last few days, he had fought with Han Sen a lot. And he
knew Han Sen was stronger than an average Baron. Now that he had
Nicai’s arrow, Hawei could definitely be damaged.</p>
<p>But the arrow looked as if it had been imbued with magic. It
disappeared from sight, and then, Hawei felt a sharp pain in his
chest.</p>
<p>Hawei looked down. Somehow, the arrow had plunged into his chest
The item twisted like a monster’s fang, digging through the armor
and flesh, all the way until it reached the heart.</p>
