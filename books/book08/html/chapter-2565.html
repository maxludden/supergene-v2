<h2>Deified Five Stages</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2565</h3>

<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth as he tried to get up. He used all of
his power to do so, and that included opening his ninth-tier
Dongxuan Area. Yet despite that, his body was still pinned to the
ground. It didn’t look as if he would be leaving anytime soon.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Han Sen suffering this. Li Keer and Exquisite
were desperately trying to get free, as well. Their faces looked
more than grim. They weren’t acting this time. This situation was
beyond their control.</p>
<p>There were many accidents in life, and now, Li Keer and
Exquisite had run into one. It was a very bad one, at that.</p>
<p>They had seen the Crocodile God before, and it wasn’t too long
ago. They knew how strong the Crocodile God could be, but they were
still confident they had a sufficient amount of power to get by if
they fought the creature.</p>
<p>But while men propose, gods tend to dispose. And the Very High
were not gods. It was impossible to see and know everything. They
hadn’t realized that this deified Crocodile God had such
strength.</p>
<p>Deified beings had five stages of growth: primitive,
transmutation, larva, butterfly, and true god.</p>
<p>Ordinary deifieds in the core area were considered primitive.
The core area’s deified xenogeneics were forever stuck in the
bracket of primitive deifieds. It was thought that they were
limited, unable to grow beyond that level.</p>
<p>Even though the strong ones like Gold Armor General were on the
upper edge of the primitive bracket, they were still worse than an
average deified being.</p>
<p>When they saw the Crocodile God, they thought it was on par with
the Gold Armor General. It had a strong body that was on the upper
borders of the primitive level. Its area was composed of chains
that were used to restrict enemies.</p>
<p>But that was all there was to it. Exquisite and Li Keer weren’t
afraid of the creature. God’s Wander could break space and let them
escape the Crocodile God’s chains. The last time they were here,
this was how they had gotten free.</p>
<p>But this time, something unexpected had happened. The Crocodile
God had changed. It must have somehow managed to level up. But that
should have been an impossible task for deifieds in the core
area.</p>
<p>They didn’t know if the Crocodile God was of the transmutation
rank or larva rank. What was happening here was completely outside
of their experience and education, and the Crocodile God’s power
exceeded what they were able to sense and understand.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about all of this, though, was that after the
Crocodile God leveled up, wild changes had occurred within the
creature’s substance chains. Its scary, gravity-like substance
chains could affect space. Space was cracking and breaking under
the creature’s power, which also kept them from escaping.</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite used all the geno arts they could think of
to try to break free. They used more than Han Sen, even. But under
the gravitic power of the Crocodile God, none of their abilities
seemed to work.</p>
<p>One power could crush ten things, but the Crocodile God’s
gravity was strong enough to crush everything. At the very least,
it prohibited Li Keer and Exquisite from breaking free.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, what do we do?” Li Keer asked Exquisite in a
trembling voice.</p>
<p>Exquisite was able to keep calm. She watched the Crocodile God
slowly coming toward them, and she said firmly, “Although I don’t
know what has happened, the core area has allowed the Crocodile God
to level up. I don’t think it has reached any further than
transmutation, though. The substance chains have made their own
substance rules, and those rules are not yet complete. We have our
Very High Spell, and if we exhaust all of our power, we might be
able to escape this.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Exquisite say all this, Li Keer felt much safer.
But she asked, “What about Dollar?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was quite far away from them. Under that scary force of
gravity, they were unable to move. When they used their powers,
they would only be able to escape the Crocodile God’s trap in a
straight line. God’s Wander could probably allow them to escape,
but they doubted they would be able to save Han Sen.</p>
<p>“We will try to save him, but if we can’t, then you must select
another silkworm,” Exquisite said quietly. It was like Han Sen’s
life was nothing in her eyes. He was like a piece of paper; if it
was ripped, it was no big deal.</p>
<p>The Very High had no emotions. They weren’t born that way, but
the more they practiced the Very High Sense, the less they cared
about the people around them.</p>
<p>Love didn’t need to be shown. For the Very High, love didn’t
mean anything. On top of that, Dollar was just a silkworm. The
silkworms they selected were no more important to them than test
subjects or lab rats. The Very High would foster their silkworms,
watching them grow and develop until they became deified. Then the
Very High would continue to raise their silkworms through the ranks
of primitive, transmutation, larva, butterfly, and true god. The
Very High would learn through this process, experiencing what it
was like to become a god. With that experience under their belts,
they would have a good base to become true gods.</p>
<p>When the Very High began to follow their own path to power, the
process would be much safer and smoother. Their power grew, and
they never needed to experience the misfortune of a mistake.</p>
<p>Creatures in that universe took pride in being selected by the
Very High. They thought they were actually taking advantage of the
Very High, as they would learn many geno arts and be given many
other resources. Silkworms were treated well.</p>
<p>The Very High gave out so much that it might have looked like
they didn’t want anything in exchange. It was unknown how many of
the higher races had been selected by the Very High and developed
under the protective wing of that most-powerful race.</p>
<p>So, the Very High didn’t fight against the other races in order
to claim anything. But the reputation of the Very High was above
even that of the Extreme King. They were a race admired by the
entire universe.</p>
<p>Even the Extreme King’s princes and princesses would be proud to
be selected by the Very High for nurturing. Warriors from ordinary
and lesser higher races would be even more pleased to be chosen. If
someone from a lower race was selected by a Very High, that meant
they would be made a primitive deified, at the very least. Their
entire race could be considered a higher race then.</p>
<p>Although many geniuses could guess that the Very High did this
for their own betterment, so what? Many people were willing to
sacrifice a great deal for the chance of becoming deified.</p>
<p>Those who had watched Han Sen’s blessings had gone mad with the
desire to become deified.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen’s blessing only pushed them to the primitive
deified territory. The Very High, on the other hand, could take
them further. Many became butterflies under the nurturing hands of
their Very High masters.</p>
<p>They didn’t mind making sacrifices for this opportunity, but the
Very High never asked for anything.</p>
<p>In fact, being a lab rat for the Very High wasn’t all that bad.
You received many benefits. If Li Keer had explained all of this to
Han Sen, he might have agreed.</p>
<p>But Li Keer had wanted to claim Han Sen’s heart before she
received his body. All her attempts thus far had gone terribly,
though.</p>
<p>As the Crocodile God came nearer, Exquisite raised her voice to
say, “Get ready to leave before it is too late.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, a light emerged from Exquisite’s body. Strange
symbols appeared across her skin. It was like many musical notes
were now glowing across her body.</p>
<p>This was the Very High’s Very High Spell. Very High elites
placed the spell across their bodies. When they used the ability,
they’d be gifted the power of a deified for a short time. They only
needed one chance to make use of God’s Wander and depart to a place
that was many systems away.</p>
