Since the day they returned from the west, no one came looking for Han Sen. Not even Mister Tiger or Third Master had come by. And Third Mister no longer asked Han Sen for the training he had previously requested.

Han Sen asked what it was that Bao’er had seen in the bottomless pit, and she said she saw an eye. What sort of eye was unclear.

Han Sen felt a chill hearing that, though. The type of eye didn’t really matter, as its presence meant something was living down there.

He didn’t go out for the next few days, and he spent all his time practicing the Dongxuan Sutra. After many hard sessions of practice, he suddenly felt some movement. When he practiced Dongxuan Sutra again, some power seeped out of his Dongxuan Aura and made his bones feel good. His cells began to change, and a mystic substance started to come out.

Han Sen had experienced this twice, and he had grown accustomed to it. He cast his Dongxuan Sutra to witness the changes that were occurring within the substance.

It was semi-transparent, and sort of like jade. It covered Han Sen’s entire body, shrouding him in a white set of armor. It was quite different from his Spell geno armor.

This white-looking geno armor looked as if it had been forged from jade. There were no images or engravings on its surface, though. It really did look like a solid, ordinary jade. It looked great

Han Sen looked closely, and the white geno armor melted. It started to change again.

“Evolving twice? Oh, no. It won’t go xenogeneic again, will it?” Han Sen’s heart leaped in his chest He prepared himself to suffer the duress of a xenogeneic transformation.

The xenogeneic armor genes blended into his body. After twisting and turning around inside Han Sen for a while, it turned black. It turned into a black geno armor and stopped moving.

Han Sen was shocked. He had never heard of something like this happening before. Why would the second evolution only prompt a change in color?

After seeing this information, Han Sen realized the Dongxuan geno armor had finished its second evolution process, but the geno weapon was still an armor set. That was why it looked similar, but it was indeed Baron class. So, the Dongxuan Armor was a geno weapon and not a geno armor.

Han Sen put it on and used his Dongxuan Sutra. He felt some strange power fill him up and increase his base stats. It was nothing like geno armor.

The strangest thing was that when Han Sen wore it, he felt a lifeforce enter his armor. It provided him a massive boon of power. It felt as if it was never going to end.

“I don’t know what the potential strength of this set of armor can be, but the endless energy is most certainly a very good thing. I can keep fighting, without the worry of exhausting myself.” Han Sen was delighted with what he had obtained, and he wanted to find someone else to fight, so he could test out the extent of his new gear.

But unfortunately, Han Sen could not find anyone. He decided to call Mister Tiger, but no one answered. So, there was the chance that he was either not around or he was simply busy.

At lunchtime, Qiao sighed and said, “If Wizard was in the state that it used to be, we could have gone to the hole. And if we were lucky, we might have earned a lot of money and become rich.”

“What is up with the bottomless hole?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

Qiao shook her head. “I have heard there are some universal geno fruits down there. If we manage to obtain one, we would be able to sell it for a high price. If you ate it, your geno armor would also evolve for a second time, allowing you to become a Noble.”

“Does something like that even exist?” Han Sen paused for a moment, and then went on to say, “Even if it is real, it is none of our business. Everyone who has ventured there has died, and the same fate would most likely befall us if we went there.”

“People didn’t know that, but now they do. The universal geno fruit down there is a magnet fruit. It absorbs metal items. If you don’t have any metal on you, you should be safe going down.” Qiao thought things over for a moment, and then went on to say, “As long as you don’t use metal items, there is no danger going down the pit for at least a mile. Many people from Gran have visited there now, and the other Feathers all seem to go there.”

“Where did this news come from?” Han Sen did not feel right, hearing this.

“I don’t know. But it is all over the city. Everyone who is a little stronger than the norm is currently making their way there. They want to see if they can get themselves a magnet fruit.” Qiao looked depressed.

“It’s best not to have it” Han Sen was experienced, and he knew someone had to be pushing this false information. He knew things couldn’t have been that simple.

But with that being said, it did make Han Sen all the more interested. It did sound as if someone wanted lots of other people to try their luck in retrieving the fruit, because they knew they could not fetch it for themselves. So, it might have been a good chance.

Han Sen had nothing better to do right now. He found an excuse to leave the house and take Bao’er with him for a trip to the hole.

For safety, Han Sen made sure he was only going there during the day. When he arrived, many people were there. The place was as busy as a market

They were all ordinary Kate folk or visitors from other races. No one looked weak, though.

“Han Sen! I knew you would come.” Before Han Sen could do anything, Mister Tiger appeared. He pulled Han Sen towards the nearby woods.

“Mister Tiger, what’s going on?” Han Sen asked.

Mister Tiger said, “You have heard the tale regarding the magnet fruit, have you not?”

Han Sen nodded. So, Mister Tiger said, “Many brave Kate, and outsiders, have ventured down the shaft. But before they see the fruit, they end up dying. Third Master knows something about all this, and he told me that it was not the time to venture down just yet. I recommend you don’t go down, either.”

Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he asked, “Did Xina and the man with a wolf head go down?”
