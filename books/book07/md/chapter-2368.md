Han Sen coughed awkwardly to fill the silence.

“Have you tried using your little sword to fix the situation?” Han Sen suddenly realized he was talking about Ning Yue’s “little sword,” and he quickly shook his head to get rid of the thought.

Ning Yue looked at him strangely and said, “I have tried everything! I’ve tried destroying it and throwing it away. I’ve even tried selling it. No matter what I do, my body remains like this. And whenever I go to sleep, the thing is lying on my chest when I wake up.”

“It looks like this is an evil sword… What are you going to do?” Han Sen knew Ning Yue was a very decisive guy. He wouldn’t have contacted Han Sen just to share some idle gossip.

“The little green sword came from a mine in a xenogeneic space. So, I went back there and searched Hell King’s place. I didn’t find much. While the mine was mostly a dead end, I did discover something interesting. The Hell were under the control of another race, and this master race had given them the job of running the mining operations. Building palaces and statues was just a cover-up; their real purpose was getting to what was under the mines.”

After pausing, Ning Yue went on to say, “In order to figure out this green sword, we have to start with the mine.”

“It will be best if you leave the xenogeneic space for now,” Han Sen said.

“I’m on a planet belonging to the Thousand Treasures. Before I left, I erased all traces of my presence there,” Ning Yue said.

“Do you know who was behind all this?” Han Sen asked.

“I don’t know. I only discovered that a master race was controlling the Hell by piecing together all the information I could find. There is no evidence to back this up.” Ning Yue shook his head.

Han Sen was silent for a moment. “Give me some time. I’m currently having some trouble of my own, and I cannot leave the Extreme King just yet. If you wait for me, I will find a way to contact you once I get out of here.”

“Okay.” Ning Yue didn’t say much after that. They arranged a few more details and then hung up.

Han Sen’s face was twitching. He wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t.

Luckily, Ning Yue was a calm man who took misfortunes in stride. If the same thing had happened to Han Sen, it would have driven him crazy.

Han Sen brought out a galaxy map belonging to the Extreme King and looked up the xenogeneic space Ning Yue had mentioned. It wasn’t listed. He also searched for the system that xenogeneic space supposedly resided in. The system belonged to a small race under the authority of Sky Palace. The race was so small that they were virtually unknown.

“It looks like it doesn’t have anything to do with this small race. Not many people know about that xenogeneic space, clearly.” Han Sen then thought to himself, “The Hell and the faction behind this are very secretive. This cannot be their territory. Perhaps they aren’t allied with Sky Palace, and that is why they operated this mine in secret. If they are hesitant to re-enter that xenogeneic space, Ning Yue and I might have a chance.”

As he considered his options, Han Sen started to develop a headache. The biggest problem right now was his inability to leave the Extreme King. Miss Mirror wouldn’t let him go free.

Han Sen’s limited power was a problem. Deified xenogeneics could be dug up from the ground in that place, and he didn’t have enough power to deal with one if they discovered it. If he wanted to go there, he would have to take the little red bird. Otherwise, things could go horribly wrong if they stumbled across another elite.

If he ended up attracting something awful like Ning Yue had, Han Sen wondered what might happen. The mere thoughts he conjured were enough to give him the chills. His skull felt downright numb.

“Still, Ning Yue isn’t the sort of person to rush into something. He’ll be fine waiting. I should really just focus on my current situation before doing anything more.” Han Sen frowned as he thought of this.

He and Lan Haixin sorted out a time to meet. He wanted to see this relic she spoke of. If he was able to claim it, it might provide a grand boost for his power.

Even if Lan Haixin nabbed it, she was Bai Yi’s wife. Han Sen would be the one to help her with the relic, so surely he would get something out of the deal.

Han Sen decided that going with Lan Haixin and the others wouldn’t be a bad idea, so he wasn’t to upset about being dragged along. In fact, he found himself rather curious.

He had little time before they went to see the relic. Instead of going to King’s Garden on that day, he studied the secrets of the Dongxuan Sutra at home. The Dongxuan Sutra was different from other geno arts. Even if he leveled up, he still had to understand how to use his developing powers. They weren’t skills he could just use right away.

Han Sen knew basically nothing about the elemental body of the Dongxuan Sutra. It was similar to the Dongxuan Aura, but he could tell that there were some important differences. Han Sen now had to figure out what it was exactly.

He also spent some time studying the Move Mountain Sea Conch beast soul, which he found quite interesting. The blue light it cast was amazing, but when it was cast upon creatures, it didn’t have a direct effect. After a few days of investigating, Han Sen discovered something. He understood the true way to make use of the Move Mountain king area.

Outside Underwater Town’s palace, the Siren nobles gathered together. There was a surprising number of them, probably two hundred in all. There were five King class Sirens and one that was half-deified.

Lan Haixin was King class. The remnants of the Siren race weren’t too shabby, but they wouldn’t work for Han Sen. They only followed the commands of Lan Haixin.

Bai Yi was the last generation of the virgin’s blood, and he was Lan Haixin’s husband. But as far as those Sirens were concerned, he was nothing.

If Han Sen hadn’t made an impressive amount of progress in recent times, they would still be looking at him with disdain.

Lan Haixin brought Bao’er to the front of the line. Seeing Han Sen and the blood kirin approach, Bao’er looked terrified. She hid behind Lan Haixin and tugged at her clothes.

“Don’t be afraid. Big Sister is here. I wouldn’t let anyone hurt you,” Lan Haixin said soothingly, lowering herself to hug Bao’er.

“Such a talented actress… It really is a waste that she hasn’t taken up a career in acting.” Han Sen wanted to cry at the sight. Bao’er was way too good. If he didn’t know the real Bao’er, he would have been completely fooled.

Han Sen chuckled coldly and looked at Bao’er. “Don’t forget that she is my daughter. I am warning you. Do not touch Bao’er. You won’t be able to withstand the consequences of my anger.”

Seeing that Bao’er was still pretending to be scared and hiding behind her, Lan Haixin stared at Han Sen and said, “Okay. But you aren’t taking her with you. She isn’t one of the Siren.”

Han Sen looked at Bao’er and licked his lips.

“We are going. We cannot leave her here. Don’t worry, she won’t affect us.” Lan Haixin pulled Bao’er forward and ignored Han Sen.

Han Sen shrugged and rode after her on the blood kirin.

The Siren were queuing in the rear, all of them looking quite excited. They were looking forward to what came next.

“Prince, can I stay behind?” Lilly stood behind Han Sen and quietly asked for permission.

“You don’t want to go?” Han Sen looked at Lilly strangely.

Lilly started to answer, but suddenly, an old female Siren next to Lan Haixin hissed, “This is a big day for the Siren, and all of us need to go. Unless you’re not one of us?”

Lilly was shocked, and she wrapped her arms defensively around her own body. She lowered her head and didn’t say anything.
