<p>“Believe? All creatures will die one day.” Han Sen was not mad,
so that was how he replied.</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. He did not continue with that
particular subject. He pulled out an object and gave it to Han Sen.
“This is for you. It should help you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not immediately grab it. He was looking at the item
in the old man’s hand. He was holding a transparent tube-shaped
container. There was some blood-red liquid inside.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It is a medicine that can control the blood power,” the old man
said. “It can make your blood stable, but it is only temporary. It
does not really solve the problem. If you want to sort out the
problem concerning your blood, you need to find someone.” The old
man threw the medicine at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen took the medicine. He frowned and asked, “Who are you?
What is your aim?”</p>
<p>“I actually found out a disaster was set to occur in your fate,”
the old man said with a laugh. “I am here to help you through it.
Do you believe me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the old man but did not speak. He was not
three years old. He would not believe in words that sounded like a
trick.</p>
<p>The old man knew Han Sen did not believe it. He shrugged his
shoulders and drank his wine. “If what I have told you is something
you do not believe, do you believe in the words spoken to you by
Han Jinzhi?”</p>
<p>“Are you Han Jinzhi?” Han Sen was shocked. His eyes were open
wide as he looked at the old man.</p>
<p>He knew Han Jinzhi hailed from a faction that was full of
scammers a long time ago. They pretended to be fortune-tellers. By
doing that, they scammed people. It was just like the old man
said.</p>
<p>“Since we are relatives, you should be calling me
great-grandad.” The old man smiled. “How am I supposed to know if
you are really Han Jinzhi?” Han Sen asked. “If you really are, you
might not have the same blood as me.”</p>
<p>“If I did not leave the Blood Legion’s secret item, the pendant,
your body would have been corroded by blue blood,” Han Jinzhi said.
“You would not be having this chance to talk to me right now.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Han Jinzhi and asked, “The notebook… What was
written with the relic?” He took this very seriously. The old man
in front of him was Han Jinzhi. He had been chasing down mysteries
about him for a very long time. Perhaps now he would finally
receive the answers he sought.</p>
<p>“If I, the old man, remember, I wrote down the ‘Super Gene’ with
a question mark,” Han Jinzhi said.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Han Jinzhi with shock. He had been looking for
him for many years. Now, he had finally discovered Han Jinzhi
standing right in front of him. He did not know what to ask.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his mouth. He wished to say something, but he did
not say anything. Han Jinzhi spoke first. “You are my
great-grandchild. Your father is my grandchild. There is no
doubting this.”</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his mouth, but Han Jinzhi stopped him from
speaking. “In the past, I had no choice. I had to shirk my identity
and keep your father in the Han house. Someone in the Han family
lost their life because of it. Just like your father said, we own
the Han family. All these things should be paid back. We owe them
that.”</p>
<p>It was hard for Han Sen to find a gap to speak. He tried to
speak again but Han Jinzhi said, “Do not ask me why I do this. Even
if I was to explain, you would not believe me. Just like you did
not believe what I said when I said your family would die.”</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his mouth. This time, Han Jinzhi did not stop
him. Yet, he could not speak. That was because the question Had Sen
had thought of before had already been answered. Now, he did not
know what to ask.</p>
<p>Han Jinzhi smiled. He poured out some wine and said, “The blue
blood inside your body was me. I had Human King give it to
you.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen’s heart sank. He did not expect Human King would
end up giving him blue blood. Now, there was a twist like this to
the story.</p>
<p>“Only by doing that could you stop the unfortunate things from
happening,” Han Jinzhi weirdly said.</p>
<p>“What unlucky thing?” Han Sen asked. “Is it like you said? Will
my family die?”</p>
<p>“Not just you,” Han Jinzhi seriously said. “The entire
world.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying I’m the savior?” Han Sen coldly laughed. He
looked at Han Jinzhi as if he was a liar.</p>
<p>“No, you are not,” Han Jinzhi said. “No one is a savior.
Everything is meant to be destroyed. What we can do is stop the end
from being the end.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Han Jinzhi shook his head. “That is what I meant. There are
things that even if I explained, you would not believe me. No
matter what, we deal with the blue blood problem first. Drink the
medicine and restrict the blood’s power. Then, look for Han Yufei.
Only she will have a way to control the blue blood power within
you.”</p>
<p>“I do not need the blue blood power,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“No, you do need it,” Han Jinzhi said with certainty. “You need
the blue blood power so Qin Xiu cannot kill you.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t Qin Xiu killed a long time ago?” Han Sen was
shocked.</p>
<p>“It would be good if he was dead.” Han Jinzhi stood up and
glanced at the backyard. He then looked at Han Sen and said, “Only
blue blood power can combat blue blood power. If you cannot win,
you can at least have a chance of surviving. Willing or not, you
are already blue blood. There is no other choice now. Han Yufei is
on a cold planet. Go and find her. Tell her who you are, and she
will help you.” Han Sen looked at Han Jinzhi and thought of many
things.</p>
<p>To be honest, from now on, Han Sen still thought the Han Jinzhi
was still kind of fake. Even though it might have been him, what he
talked about was hard to believe. It was beyond belief.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Han Jinzhi and said, “Many people say you
cannot have babies. Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Go and find Han Yufei. She will give you all the answers you
want.” Han Jinzhi looked at the sky and said, “There is no time.
The red umbrella is coming. You should go.” “Red umbrella?” Han Sen
asked. “Is that the woman with Human King? What is your
relationship with him?”</p>
<p>Han Jinzhi looked at Han Sen and laughed. He suddenly kicked Han
Sen in the face and pushed him back.</p>
<p>There should have been a stone floorboard behind him, but Han
Sen had flipped the stone floorboard. He fell. It was like he was
falling into an abyss.</p>
<p>“Kid, remember to live no matter what. Even if things are bleak,
don’t ever give up. You must live at all costs because you need to
live. Do that, and your family has hope.” Han Jinzhi’s voice rang
in Han Sen’s ear. Han Sen felt some power continue to pull him
down. He could not shake it off.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Han Sen could not control his body now,
but that power could not stop him. Now, Han Sen was not able to
stop falling.</p>
