<p>In the god palaces, the god temple under the geno hall began to
release a 3,000-foot-long light. It was like a sun exploding.</p>
<p>Previously, the lifeforce was like a sea. The god temple that
released the scary god light was suddenly dead. The shining gold
god temple was dim. It was like some dust had been scattered.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Han Sen and Bai King were shocked.</p>
<p>That god temple was very high. It was only one step below the
geno hall. It was an Annihilation class god temple. Looking at the
god temple now, it seemed as if it had been beaten and shut
down.</p>
<p>“In the universe, who can beat an Annihilation class God Spirit
and force it to shut down?” While Han Sen pondered this, he saw the
dusty god temple door open. A shadow emerged from beyond.</p>
<p>The creatures of the universe did not see whose body it was. All
they saw was a flash and the body disappear. It looked like it left
the god palace.</p>
<p>“Oh, no!” Bai King’s face changed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Bai King and asked, “Oh, no, what?”</p>
<p>“That Annihilation class God Spirit possessed a body and
descended,” Bai King said. “It entered the universe. We should
run!” He wanted to run off immediately. Before his body moved, he
saw a portion of space move nearby. A body appeared. It was the
same body that emerged from the god palace.</p>
<p>The body was not very tall. It just about a foot taller than Han
Sen, but the power it wielded was strong. He was wearing black
armor. His shoulders had a black hammer that was the size of a
barrel. His god eyes were coldly looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You killed a god! You should be killed!” The God Spirit did not
say much. He only said a few words before starting to wave his big
hammer around in the air.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood that the Annihilation God Spirit had
possessed a body to descend and kill him since he had killed a
god.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He used Galaxy Teleportation
because he wanted to leave. He wanted to teleport a few systems
away. Han Sen teleported away. While he was teleporting, he was
inside a space tunnel. He heard some explosion sounds next to his
ear. He then felt his body get hit. He was knocked out of the space
tunnel.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes flashed. He still saw himself in space. That God
Spirit’s strong body was not very far away. He was holding that
big, scary hammer.</p>
<p>The space around was cracking like glass. The space cracks were
like a spiderweb. The power of the God Spirit’s hammer was breaking
the entire system. It created many broken layers in space. Even
using Galaxy Teleportation was impossible now. It could no longer
be used. Han Sen knew it was time to fight for his life. Killing a
Disaster class God Spirit had been incredibly difficult. It forced
him to use his Super God Spirit mode. Now, an Annihilation class
God Spirit was using a body to descend. The power of that hammer
far exceeded Han Sen’s power. Han Sen’s full power attack was
unable to reach the magnitude of his new nemesis.</p>
<p>He tightly held onto the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. Han Sen
pushed his own power to the maximum.</p>
<p>Bai King, who was nearby, frowned. He looked at the God Spirit
and said, “I do not think we offended you. Why have you descended
to come and fight us?”</p>
<p>The God Spirit was holding his big hammer as he coldly
responded, “Killing a God Spirit is a crime.”</p>
<p>After that, another hammer came from the sky. He and Han Sen
were a galaxy apart, but that hammer’s power was not coming to
strike Han Sen. It was striking the space that was in front of
him.</p>
<p>After the hammer came down, the whole of space shook. Han Sen
felt as if his body had been broken by space.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Han Sen coughed up some boiling blood. He tried his hardest to
fight back, but his xenogeneic battle body could still not
withstand that scary shaking power. Many of his organs were
severely injured, and his god bones had many fractures. It was like
they were going to break any second.</p>
<p>Bai King was attacked too. His body was shining with light.
There was a shield of light covering his body that looked like a
God Spirit. It blocked that scary shaking power.</p>
<p>The God Spirit hammered down. This time, the hammer’s strike was
greater than the last one. Han Sen was in too much shock. He was
forced to gather up power and ready himself for another battle.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Bai King’s body appeared in front of Han Sen. That weird light
was following Bai King’s movement. It created a defensive bulwark
and blocked the God Spirit’s heavy hammer attack.</p>
<p>“Spirit of God!” Han Sen was shocked. When he looked closer, it
was not really a God Spirit. The light of Bai King’s body was like
a god and a demon. It was like an ancient battle spirit. It had
three heads and six arms. Six of the hands were wielding different
weapons.</p>
<p>There was a sword, knife, shield, jian, ring, and mirror. There
were four types of weapons, and they were releasing a weird and
mysterious light. The one that blocked the God Spirit’s hammer
attack was the shield.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the light. It looked just like a beast soul
and God Spirit, but it was different. He was thinking of the
xenogeneics that had no souls in the Nine-Defense Palace. He
thought, “Are these spirit weapons made from the xenogeneic
spirits?”</p>
<p>Bai King stared at the God Spirit and slowly said to Han Sen,
“You leave now.”</p>
<p>“Why are you saving me?” Han Sen did not understand why Bai King
was risking a fight against this God Spirit to save him. In any
way, his relationship with Bai King was not a positive one.</p>
<p>If Bai King had come to save him because he was a student, Han
Sen believed that was hogwash. When Bai King’s son died, he had not
taken it that seriously. And he was just a student.</p>
<p>Bai King stared at the God Spirit as he said, “I don’t have time
to talk about that. I cannot last long. Hurry up and leave. Get as
far away from here as you possibly can.”</p>
<p>“No one is leaving! You are all going to die today!” The god’s
voice was like thunder. It was extremely loud. After those words
were spoken, the God Spirit’s big hammer was coming down. The
hammer carried an incredibly scary breaking power. It was suddenly
in front of Bai King.</p>
<p>The shaking of space was very scary. Now that the hammer was
coming, it was so strong that even Han Sen, who was behind Bai
King, felt as if he could not beat it.</p>
<p>Bai King stared at that scary god hammer. He did not fall back.
His body was like a demon god’s shadow that was silently roaring in
the sky. He was holding the shield while running toward the god
hammer.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A scary shockwave suddenly destroyed the space around. Han Sen
used all of his power to fight the shockwave, but his Dongxuan
Armor was starting to reveal cracks.</p>
<p>“Run!” Bai King’s voice was heard again.</p>
<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He turned around and headed for the
broken space that looked like a spiderweb.</p>
<p>“Don’t run!” the God Spirit coldly shouted. He was holding a big
hammer. He waved it at Han Sen, but Bai King stopped him.</p>
<p>“If there is someone I want to save, not even a god can get in
the way.” Bai King’s voice was clear and cold.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt there was some scary space-shaking force behind
him. Han Sen used the borrow strength skill and the shockwave to
propel his sprint through the broken space.</p>
