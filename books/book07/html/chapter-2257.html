<h2>Stunning Soul-Taking Eye</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2257</h3>

<p>The Stunning Soul-Taking Eye was the highest-class geno art that
the Foxes possessed, and learning the skill required the talents of
a Fox’s eyes.</p>
<p>A thousand different people could be polled on a single subject,
and they would most likely give a thousand different responses.
Everyone’s interests, opinions, and desires were unique. So, it was
all very possible for certain people to fall in love with people
that others would deem to be ugly. For both men and women,
love-at-first-sight was a very important concept.</p>
<p>When a Fox made use of the Stunning Soul-Taking Eye, it would
allow the Fox to capture the desires of their target. They would
look perfect in the eyes of their prey, like a dream come true.</p>
<p>So, no matter what Fox Queen did, her target would believe her
to be absolutely perfect. Every movement was soul-snaring, too
alluring to be denied or escaped from.</p>
<p>The amazing thing was that the skill wouldn’t deprive the target
of their will. The target simply became captivated by the woman
they saw. It was the woman of the target’s dreams, after all.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at Fox Queen in surprise. Today, Fox Queen was
looking exceptionally beautiful. But at the same time, she looked
the same as she always did. Her eyes had just become intoxicating,
and her beauty was making it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>“Today, you look remarkably special.” As Han Sen looked at Fox
Queen, his expression softened.</p>
<p>“What would you say is remarkably special?” Fox Queen
smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled back, his cheeks coloring slightly as he did so.
His eyes brightened.</p>
<p>“Very beautiful,” Han Sen managed to say, after a moment of
thought. He couldn’t think of an adequate way to describe the
beauty of Fox Queen right now, and so that was all he could fumble
out.</p>
<p>“Was I not beautiful prior to this?” Fox Queen spoke evilly.</p>
<p>“You were always pretty, but today you look extra beautiful.
There is something different…” As Han Sen spoke, he looked very
nervous.</p>
<p>It was like he had been thrust back to his days of first love.
The first time he spoke to the girl he had a crush on. It was a
feeling that made his heart pound. It was so strong, like his heart
was actually trying to leap out of his chest.</p>
<p>“Do you like how I look right now?” Fox Queen asked, as she
stared right at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I like it.” Han Sen gulped.</p>
<p>“Then why are you still standing there?” Fox Queen turned her
body to lay on her side, and as she did, she loosened her robe. She
revealed her soft shoulders and delicate legs.</p>
<p>“I… I…” Han Sen’s face was extremely red. He didn’t know where
to place his eyes or his hands.</p>
<p>Fox Queen took deep, satisfied breaths, and she thought to
herself, “No matter how strong your will is, beneath my Stunning
Soul-Taking Eye, you won’t even be able to resist the temptation to
suck my toes.”</p>
<p>Han Sen seemed as shy as a nervous virgin, and Fox Queen stood
up and walked before him. She raised his hands and brought them up
to brush the soft skin of her face. She rubbed her face against Han
Sen’s hands, and stared at the man lasciviously.</p>
<p>Although Fox Queen did not say anything out loud, her eyes spoke
on her behalf.</p>
<p>If Han Sen’s face got any redder, it was going to start
bleeding. He mustered the courage to hold her stunning face with
two hands. He nibbled his lips. It looked as if he greatly desired
to kiss her, but he did not dare to.</p>
<p>Fox Queen closed her eyes and raised her pretty face, like a
princess waiting for her prince. That pretty face now seemed to
suggest that Han Sen could do anything he wished to.</p>
<p>Feeling Han Sen’s deep breathing and hot body, Fox Queen felt as
cocky as she did disappointed. She had beaten Han Sen so quickly,
and the interest she had in him seemed to evaporate.</p>
<p>Fox Queen was thinking of new ways in which she could play with
him when he fell fully under her spell. She wanted to see what ways
she could make him suffer for her.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll tie him up when he loses control. That would be an
interesting sight,” Fox Queen thought, but Han Sen’s lips were yet
to come up to hers.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Fox Queen heard a loud noise. And then, Han Sen’s presence just
disappeared from right in front of her. She was so shocked that she
had no idea what had just happened.</p>
<p>And then, she understood. She opened her eyes and peered at the
fish statue. The bindings of the palace were weakened there, and
Han Sen and Little Star had slipped right through that tiny
gap.</p>
<p>“He ran… he ran… I can’t believe he actually ran…” Fox Queen
stood where she was, completely frozen in place. She couldn’t
believe Han Sen had actually fled.</p>
<p>Fox Queen hadn’t believed that Han Sen had even a tiny chance of
breaking through the walls of the palace, and the way that Han Sen
had shrugged off her Stunning Soul-Taking Eye was
inconceivable.</p>
<p>When she realized what had just happened, her face darkened with
fury. She had just been manipulated. A deified Fox had just been
played by a Duke.</p>
<p>Fox Queen wanted to take her anger out on him, but she was
unable to: Han Sen had already fled. Even swearing revenge would be
utterly pointless, since she still had no way of escaping her
cage.</p>
<p>Han Sen combined himself with Little Angel, and after summoning
the powers of Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra, he used Super
Spank to strike the mouth of the fish.</p>
<p>The loosened restriction was widened more and more. He mounted
Little Star and escaped the palace right through its mouth. He
moved fast, and he didn’t dare to slow down.</p>
<p>It was his best chance to escape. Fox Queen believed him to be
under her spell, so she couldn’t react in time to prevent him from
leaving.</p>
<p>And just as Han Sen thought, it played out all too smoothly. He
almost struggled to believe it had worked out so well.</p>
<p>“I left! It is great to have a beautiful woman with you, but I
could not stay there forever.” Han Sen rode Little Star and
traveled through the stone. He felt so happy that he started to
sing songs. He thought to himself, “I am so talented. I could
totally have become an actor. If I ever plan to make a movie,
Little Li would have to work for an additional fifty years to
become worthy of my film.”</p>
<p>Han Sen allowed Little Star to follow the metal pipe out. He
would return to the underground cave system before thinking about
what to do next.</p>
<p>Quickly, Little Star took Han Sen back to the underground river.
Little Star deactivated its Starsea Travel ability, and its body
regained its corporeal form. Han Sen continued to sit comfortably
on its back as it swam toward the surface of the river.</p>
<p>Little Star brought Han Sen out of the underground river with a
splash, and they floated along the surface.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. He looked around, and he froze.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King, Crime, Mister White, Edward, and others
were standing on the shore not too far away. Their mouths hung open
as they stared at Han Sen, who was still dripping with water. They
all looked at each other for three seconds.</p>
<p>It was very quiet, and there was only the sound of the river
water to be heard. It was like time was standing still.</p>
