  “Take these vials of Child Combine Liquid, and he will come,” said the head researcher. Talking about the Child Combine Liquid made his face twitch. It looked as if he had gotten a sudden toothache.

“Isn’t it a waste to give him that?” Old Dong and the other teachers were in shock.

“Do you know of any other ways to lower the Blood Feather Knife’s temperature to the level we need?” Sky Path Garden’s leader looked at everyone there, but they were all speechless.

“Go. Take the Child Combine Liquid, like you would to give a dog a treat.” The head researcher sighed.

Old Dong did not say anything. He just clenched his teeth and left the research room.

“What is Child Combine Liquid?” Han Sen asked White Real. He was not interested in who the leader was inviting. It was obviously someone with a powerful ice-element, and beyond that, Han Sen didn’t really care.

But that Child Combine Liquid sounded powerful, and it snagged Han Sen’s curiosity.

White Real quietly told Han Sen, “Child Combine Liquid is the formulation of one of our primary fields of research. It takes many high-level xenogeneic ingredients to produce, and it requires a synthesizing process that is extremely complicated. It aids high-class xenogeneics in evolving. If a King class kept on consuming the Child Combine Liquid, there is a high chance he could become deified.”

“It’s that strong?” Han Sen was shocked. It was shocking that a King class could so simply be made deified.

“It would require a lot of luck, but it’s theoretically possible. On the other hand, raising a Duke to King class? That’s easy. Our test record for accomplishing this is a mere ten vials of Child Combine Liquid,” White Real boasted.

“It’s no wonder that Sky Palace is so strong. You can make Kings like that? How many do you have?” Han Sen asked with shock.

“One.” White Real lifted one finger. Han Sen froze, so White Real continued. “It is hard to find ingredients for Child Combine Liquid, mind you. We have only made around twenty of them, and we use some for testing. And that King used ten bottles. There are only seven or eight left. We have exhausted our supply of ingredients.”

Han Sen thought to himself, “If you can’t mass produce something, what is the point of creating it?”

White Real seemed to guess what Han Sen was thinking. “We can’t make Child Combine Liquid in large volumes, but with a few alterations, we can create a xenogeneic liquid that works on normal xenogeneics. If you drink a lot, a Marquise can become a Duke. An Earl could become a Marquise easily. Many of us are using it.”

Because the person had yet to arrive, the refinement process had stopped. They waited all morning for Old Dong to return, and when he did, he brought someone with him. It was Yu Shanxin.

“Mister Yu!” Han Sen exclaimed, bowing quickly.

“Why are you here?” Yu Shanxin was holding a dog. That dog did not look energized, though. Its tail drooped and its fur was scraggly.

Han Sen had seen many dogs like that. It looked like any malnourished dog you might find wandering dirty streets, but there was no way an elite like Yu Shanxin would carry a being in such a poor state. Perhaps it was a high-class xenogeneic that just looked like a dog. Perhaps the creature was King-class or half-deified.

“The leader has asked me to help refine the Blood Feather Knife,” Han Sen said.

“I see. How much did the leader pay you?” Yu Shanxin asked with a smile.

“That’s what a student should do,” Han Sen answered quickly. The leader hadn’t given him any money, and he had been dragged there by White Real.

Yu Shanxin patted Han Sen on the shoulder and smiled. “You and I are the same. We are good people.”

Before Han Sen could say anything more, Yu Shanxin looked at the head researcher and said, “Leader, are you going to pay me for my efforts here?”

“Do not worry, I won’t change what we agreed upon,” the old man grunted.

“Then give it to me now. I don’t work unless I see payment first.” Yu Shanxin put out his hand. He seemed surprisingly stingy.

“Give it to him,” the old researcher barked, grinding his teeth. He was talking to Old Dong again.

Old Dong looked hurt. He opened up a box, and in it, there were seven containers. Each one held two hundred milliliters of juice. Old Dong carefully picked up one and held it out to Yu Shanxin, but the man hastily grabbed another four before taking the one Old Dong had.

“Five of them. I have not taken any more nor any less,” Yu Shanxin told Old Dong and the leader. Both of them were looking ill.

Han Sen looked at the Child Combine Liquid in Yu Shanxin’s hands. It was a transparent liquid, and it didn’t look all that special.

“Old Wang, this is some good stuff,” Yu Shanxin said to the dog. He opened one of the bottles and poured out the contents for the dog to consume.

The dog immediately got up and started lapping up all the Child Combine Liquid. It licked its lips, as if it was saying,

“My lips aren’t moist enough. You should give me another.”

Yu Shanxin opened up another vial and poured it out for the dog called Old Wang.

Old Wang lapped up the Child Combine Liquid again.

“Can you stop wasting it!” Old Dong burst out, unable to contain his anger.

“Leader, what is wrong with him? These vials are mine. What have I done wrong now?” Yu Shanxin looked at the leader with confusion.

The leader simply waved his hand at Old Dong, signaling him to stop talking. He then said to Yu Shanxin, “You’ve been paid, and now you should work. No one will say anything after you are done working, even if you pour the stuff in the garbage.”

Yu Shanxin smiled. He opened two more vials, one in each hand. Then, he gave them both to Old Wang at once. Old Wang drank it all up. Yu Shanxin wasn’t going to respect the leader just yet; he was going to use up all the Child Combine Liquid first.

“It looks like Old Wang is full. This last one is pointless to have. Take it.” Yu Shanxin threw the last vial of Child Combine Liquid to Han Sen.

Han Sen caught it. He was surprised to see Yu Shanxin give away something so precious. Han Sen wished to say something, but Yu Shanxin stretched his limbs and then said, “Okay, time to work.”

He walked over to the Absolute Container and touched it. The other researchers all started to look nervous as they returned to work.

When Yu Shanxin pressed his hand against the crystal container, it created a hole to allow his hand inside. The container then tightened again around his arm. The container was again sealed against contaminants.

Yu Shanxin touched the Blood Feather Knife, and there was a katcha katcha noise. It sounded like ice was being broken.
