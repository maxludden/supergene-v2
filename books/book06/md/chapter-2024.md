  In total, 187 Earl and two Marquise Ghost Face Spiders had been one-hit killed by Han Sen. None had been left alive, and none required a double tap to finish off.

Han Sen’s power was scary. Having practiced inside that dream was one of the reasons for this. If he hadn’t endured that, he wouldn’t have known the precise weaknesses of the Ghost Face Spiders, and he wouldn’t have been able to kill the Marquise spiders in one hit.

But despite killing so many spiders, he had only earned a single beast soul for himself. It was a disappointment for Han Sen, overall.

Han Sen made sure there were no more spiders waiting to emerge from the statue, and then the pair crawled out of the crevice and started cutting up the bodies.

The Ancient God space’s xenogeneics were different from the ones found elsewhere. The xenogeneic genes of the Ghost Face Spiders were little balls. They looked like pearls.

After Han Sen pulled one of the little orbs out, Hai’er looked hesitant. She hadn’t actually done anything, so she didn’t think she should take any of the spoils. She most certainly didn’t think she should be going fifty-fifty.

But Han Sen went ahead and split the orbs in half. He placed half of them in his pockets and then climbed up the statue.

Hai’er didn’t hesitate to collect the rest of the orbs.

Without Hai’er leading, Han Sen wouldn’t have been able to find this cavern. There were too many crevices and gulches to traverse, and despite walking for a very long time, stumbling on this statue would have been very unlikely.

So, Han Sen thought that the split of spoils was fair enough. Information was worth a lot. But there were many benefits yet to see, so their trip wasn’t over yet. Inside the Ancient God xenogeneic cave, many goodies were waiting for them.

Hai’er put away the orbs she had gathered and followed after Han Sen. She climbed up to the statue’s shoulder.

“Where should we go?” Han Sen asked, while observing the statue’s head.

With his knowledge of Ghost Face Spiders, he knew that their creation was a strange process. If their origin wasn’t destroyed, Ghost Face Spiders would spawn continually.

“Normally, the statue’s mouth is the closest to a Beginning of Ancient God. But the items are always contained within the statue,” Hai’er explained.

“What is a Beginning of Ancient God?” Han Sen asked.

“You don’t know?” Hai’er was surprised, but she knew Han Sen had no reason to lie to her. So, she went ahead to explain. “A Beginning of Ancient God is what the xenogeneics are born from. Those are the most valuable things in the Ancient God space. If you are able to get a Beginning of Ancient God, you can keep spawning Ancient God xenogeneics forever. Those things are important to big factions. Surely you must know this.”

Han Sen nodded, and then he climbed into the mouth of the statue.

Hai’er entered with him, and it was very large inside. There was a path that was only a few meters wide. It was very low, though, so they had to bend to traverse it.

“If you don’t know anything about this place, why did you decide to come?” Hai’er asked curiously as she walked.

Han Sen did not answer. He hadn’t known what a Beginning of Ancient God was. He had seen it in a dream, but he had never been told its name.

Rather than telling him, Dream Beast had used the dream to inform him of the things he needed to know. It was easier than Han Sen thought it would be, though. Perhaps they had killed all of the Ghost Face Spiders, because they didn’t encounter any more along the way.

They walked for two or three hours inside the statue, on a road that took them down many different routes. Eventually, they found a Beginning of Ancient God.

It was a tablet about the size of a hand. It was grey, but it possessed a number of red lights. It also bore the pattern that adorned the Ghost Face Spiders.

Hai’er took it out from where it was embedded in a stone slot. And when she did, the pattern on the tablet went dim.

Its red glow disappeared.

“There is only one of them. If you would like, you can have it first.” Hai’er gave the Beginning of Ancient God—the one that pertained to the Ghost Face Spiders—to Han Sen.

“I will take the next one.” Han Sen did not accept the Beginning of Ancient God. In his dream, he recalled that the Ghost Face Spiders were one of the weaker varieties. There were other xenogeneics with a Beginning of Ancient God that were far stronger than the Ghost Face Spiders.

After that, Han Sen turned around and started walking towards the exit.

Their bodies were bound by the xenogeneic space, so they could not walk very fast. And neither could they fly out. When they emerged, they climbed down the statue and entered a cave nearby.

You have given me this Beginning of Ancient God. Aren’t you afraid that there might be no more to find later on?” Hai’er said as she fiddled with the Beginning of Ancient God, smiling Han Sen from behind.

“It’s okay. Accept it as a reward for the information you have provided me with,” Han Sen said casually.

“I have really come to like you a bit more. If the Rebate don’t want you anymore, you can gladly come and live with us Pirates. If you follow me, I can treat you with everything you could ever desire,” Hai’er said.

“We can talk about that when the time comes,” Han Sen said lackadaisically. He wasn’t too interested.

He had heard of the Pirates before. They were a bunch of thieves, but the things they stole were massive. They weren’t the sort to steal from ordinary creatures. They had stolen from many high races and earned many enemies across the geno universe.

Due to the Pirates being so powerful, amongst other reasons, no one could do anything to stop them, either.

Han Sen didn’t want to be a thief. Even if Hai’er invited him sincerely, he wouldn’t accept the offer. And on top of that, Hai’er always seemed to have an evil streak. Who knew what her true plans might have been?

There was only one way to go after that statue, and after eight miles of following it, they had yet to find a single other branch leading elsewhere.

But they eventually heard the sound of water. It was similar to the noise of a big waterfall.

They looked at each other and slowed down. They walked another three miles, and that was when the path widened again. There was indeed a waterfall. It looked like a galaxy in the deepest recess of the cave. The water sounds were very loud.

Behind that waterfall was a silver statue. The waterfall came out from the statue’s belly button.

The statue’s lower body was like that of a horse. The upper body was that of a human. It had the head of a bird, and it also possessed wings. It looked so strange.

“Did your elder tell you what xenogeneics this statue might harbor?” Han Sen asked Hai’er.

Hai’er shook her head. “I don’t know. When he came here, he was heavily injured. He didn’t touch the statue from earlier, so he could not have come this far. I am just like you right now: clueless.”

As they were talking, a silver monster emerged from the water beneath the statue. It climbed up the waterfall and entered the belly button of the silver statue.
