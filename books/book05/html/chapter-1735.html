<p>Han Sen was on his way back to Qiao. Mister Tiger offered to
take him home, but Han Sen politely declined.</p>
<p>Since Han Sen had nothing better to do, it was best that he
exercised, anyway.</p>
<p>When he went past an alley, Han Sen felt a searing burn develop
on his back. It was like someone had thrown boiling water across
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He could endure the pain, but he could feel
it growing and becoming hotter. A red light burst out of his back,
and not even his clothes were able to dim the brightness.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see there were quite a few people around, so he
summoned his geno armor to cover his body. The last thing he wanted
was for people to see it Unfortunately, the light was getting even
brighter, and the geno armor itself was starting to glow red. Han
Sen looked around and quickly found a public bathroom he could dip
into.</p>
<p>After he rushed inside, his back released more and more red
light. Eventually, his entire body was pulled back into the light.
The red light was like fireworks, and then, there was nothing. The
red light disappeared, taking Han Sen’s body with it.</p>
<p>Planet Roca</p>
<p>The officer threw a punch at Zero’s head, when all of a sudden,
a hand came out of the red light behind her. It punched towards the
officer’s fist.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Incredible power was unleashed in the collision of both forces.
The officer’s body was sent reeling back, out of the atmosphere and
into space. He looked back at Zero’s red light, and the fist that
had emerged from it.</p>
<p>A tall body came out, and when everyone saw who it was, they
were so happy. They all exuberantly shouted, “Han Sen!”</p>
<p>Han Sen had no clue what was going on, but he was able to guess,
judging from what he had just done.</p>
<p>“What happened here?” Han Sen looked at the xenogeneic beast in
the sky. It wasn’t from the sanctuary, he knew that much. It was
too powerful for that.</p>
<p>“The officer used his powers to open the sanctuary gate. Stop
him, or the creatures from the outside will enter!” Stay Up Late
shouted.</p>
<p>“Dad!” Littleflower jumped into Han Sen’s chest from Zero.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw everyone there was injured, and even Ji Yanran was
holding Bao’er, blood streaking the baby’s face and mouth.</p>
<p>They each looked wounded, and that made Han Sen a very angry
man.</p>
<p>“Officer, I have no grudge with you, and yet you attack my
family again! Do you think I’ll let this slide again?” Han Sen’s
power was frighteningly strong. The geno armor’s power exploded
away from him. Inside the sanctuary, there was no other power to
suppress him. The geno armor’s power was difficult to rightly
fathom.</p>
<p>“Blame Han Jinzhi!” the officer said, before teleporting in
front of Han Sen and punching him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a strength that was greater than a crystallizer’s
come into him. His foe had the presence of a xenogeneic from Kate
planet. Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s fist did not stop. It hit the officer’s fist
again. He punched the officer and sent him back into space. Then,
he followed up and chased after him.</p>
<p>“Impossible! How could you achieve such power? The sanctuary
should be kicking you out for this. Why?” The officer’s mouth gaped
in disbelief. He had spliced as many mutant genes as he could to
earn that power, and he was going to leave soon.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was more powerful than him, and above that, he could
stay in the sanctuary. He had surpassed the system and was above
the rules.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t interested in talking with him, though, so he
just threw another punch.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic was entering the sanctuary, and Han Sen didn’t
think it was just a Baron. If it entered fully, it could most
certainly deal damage to the entire Alliance.</p>
<p>“Dad! Hit him!” Littleflower was clinging to Han Sen’s neck, and
he looked very angry.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had seen Littleflower so angry,
and it prompted him to increase the volume of power he was
delivering.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The officer’s eyes watched Han Sen’s fist come for him. He
wanted to punch it back, but he couldn’t. The fist landed on his
jaw, and he was sent flying.</p>
<p>Before he went too far, though, Han Sen appeared above him. His
legs were like an axe, and heaven only knew how many of the
officer’s bones snapped under the impact.</p>
<p>Swing. Fist. Punch. Uppercut. Kick. Knee. Elbow. Han Sen became
a killing machine, with his repeated attacks on the officer.</p>
<p>The officer could block a few punches at first, but more of his
bones soon broke. And as they did, his defenses crumbled. He
started to bleed, and his armor started to break.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! Quickly kill him or it will be too late!” Stay Up Late
shouted, as he looked up at the black vortex. Half of the</p>
<p>xenogeneic beast was already in, and it looked ready to slip
through the black hole any second now.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen wanted to get rid of it. Unfortunately,
although the officer’s body was broken, he was not destroyed. He
was still alive.</p>
<p>“You can’t kill me. You can’t kill me. I have the xenogeneic
power. You can’t kill me.” The officer took another punch, blood
spraying from his body. He laughed, saying, “When it arrives,
you’ll all be dead. Give me Littleflower, for only I will be able
to save his life.”</p>
<p>“No one can take my son away.” Han Sen grunted. The shape of a
half-transparent black dagger manifested in his hand. He thrust it
into the villain, cutting open his flesh and armor.</p>
<p>The dagger sliced open the officer’s chest. It didn’t kill him,
though, and his body was able to recover easily.</p>
<p>“This is pointless! You can’t kill me. Give me Littleflower and
I will save him.” The officer was angry, but he didn’t care much
for the wound.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at him coldly. And as he repeatedly stabbed the
officer’s body, he asked, “Why do you want him so much?” “Because
he… he can be the real… aargh!” Before the officer finished, he
screamed.</p>
<p>“There it is.” Han Sen looked murderous. He used the Rhino Horn
Dagger, shoving it into the officer’s brain.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Something was broken by the dagger’s attack, and the officer’s
face froze. Blood oozed from his head, rolling down to his
lips.</p>
<p>“No way… I can’t die… me… aargh!” The officer’s head cracked
wide open. In between the brain juices, a black crystal had been
smashed in two.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his head and his face changed. The officer died
and the black hole shrank. But the xenogeneic had already come in,
and that was terrifying.</p>
