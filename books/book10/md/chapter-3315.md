  “If you are interested, you can have a look at what is out there,” Han Sen said to big sky demon.

“Are you trying to trick me out of your dream? That is not going to work, my dear. I want to go into your dreams and do it whenever. You cannot stop me.” Big sky demon’s fingers stroked Han Sen’s cheek as she spoke.

“You do not have to say that yet,” Han Sen said. “Go out and take a look first. If you do not leave, then I will.”

Big sky demon could tell Han Sen was not fooling around, so she smiled and asked, “What are you being so mysterious about?”

“Just go out and take a look for yourself.” After Han Sen said that, he readied himself to depart the dreamscape. He was not really in the mood to joke around with big sky demon.

Big sky demon flew out of Han Sen’s dream. When Han Sen awoke from the dream, she would have to wait until Han Sen went to sleep again before entering his dreams.

When big sky demon came out, she smiled and asked Han Sen, “What do you want me to see?” After she saw what was needed to be seen, she froze on the spot.

In the next second, big sky demon madly screamed, “The geno tablet! This is the 33rd sky! What are you doing here?”

“It looks like you recognize the geno tablet.” Han Sen looked at big sky demon and asked. “Do you mind telling me what this is?”

Big sky demon looked calm, but her face still looked shocked. “The geno tablet is the leader’s most cherished gift. It is the foundation of a new god world. After the chaos that came about the rebooting, this tablet was in the 33rd sky.”

After saying that much, big sky demon stopped talking. She strangely looked at the geno tablet. She saw Han Sen leave a spell behind, which shocked her. She screamed, “A geno spell! Did Mister Leader come back to the world?”

Big sky demon immediately noticed there was something wrong. She shook her head and said, “No, this gene spell has been drawn differently compared to Mister Leader’s. This is very light. It is not from Mister Leader’s fingers.”

“I drew it,” Han Sen said.

“You?” Big sky demon looked at Han Sen strangely. “How could you go to the 33rd sky and learn how to perform a geno spell?”

Han Sen did not hide a thing. He explained what had been going on. As big sky demon listened to Han Sen’s tale, her face morphed and cycled through various expressions. When Han Sen was done talking, big sky demon maintained a deep frowning. She didn’t say a word.

A while later, big sky demon said, “Ancient Devil has good luck. He reincarnated and managed to break the world. The geno spell he has taught you is correct. There is nothing wrong with it, but…”

“But what?” Han Sen’s heart jumped.

“Without a Reboot-class power, you cannot activate the geno tablet,” big sky demon said as she looked at Han Sen. “If you want to leave a mark on the geno tablet permanently, you will need to reach a 95% percent Break World rate. Your Break World rate is not high, so I am surprised you have managed to leave a mark on it at all.”

“I have a power that makes my body become a spirit. I use the spirit body to place down a mark. It is easier that way.” Han Sen looked at big sky demon and said, “But what you meant wasn’t about that.”

Big sky demon looked at Han Sen weirdly. “What I wanted to say was that if you did not activate the geno tablet and drew a geno spell on it, you would suffer the geno tablet’s backlash power. Your body is very strong, but your Break World rate is too low. I do not know if you can sustain the power of the geno tablet’s strike.”

“Backlash? I do not feel anything uncomfortable on my body.” Han Sen checked out his body. He did not see or feel any problems.

Big sky demon shook her head and said, “It is because the geno tablet’s backlash power has not come yet. Even though Mister Leader’s body was strong, not even he could avoid it. The geno tablet could not do anything to him.”

After she said that, big sky demon pointed at the symbol drawn on the geno tablet by Han Sen and said, “When the symbol goes away, that is the time you will be forced to endure the backlash.”

“If I draw another spell before the geno spell is gone, can I avoid the backlash?” Han Sen asked.

“Of course not,” big sky demon confidently said. “Even if you draw it in the same place, it is pointless.”

“What are the consequences of the backlash?” Han Sen quietly asked.

Big sky demon did not answer Han Sen. She looked at the geno tablet. She then looked back at Han Sen. She smiled weirdly and said, “Actually, the geno tablet’s backlash power is not much of a big deal. Maybe it will not hurt you. Maybe it will do you good.”

“What makes you say that?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Big sky demon smiled and said, “The geno tablet is the universe’s foundation. There are countless gene messages. It is the foundation of the gene messages in the universe. Its backlash power is the invasion of a gene message.”

When Han Sen heard that, his face changed. Other people might not know how scary the invasion of gene messages was, but he did. After all, he had interacted with many gene test subjects.”

Big sky demon smiled and went on to say, “If you are lucky, maybe the gene messages that come to you will gift you a boon. You might receive rabbit ears, the wings of a hawk, the paws of a bear, the nose of a dog, and so on.”

Han Sen knew big sky demon was not just trying to scare him. This was likely the best result.

If the geno tablet really was the universe’s gene message, the gene message invasion could turn Han Sen into a dog, cat, or monster with a hundred legs, a thousand arms, and 10 brains.

If Han Sen’s gene message was not stable, he could become any sort of monster after being invaded.

Although the invasion of a gene message was not that bad, it might be a powerful gene message invasion. It would make Han Sen’s body stronger, but there were too many random variables. No one would have wanted to take that kind of risk.

“Ancient Devil, that asshole!” Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He knew now that he had been tricked by Ancient Devil.

Even if he had a chance to do things over, Han Sen would have done the same thing. He knew the risks, but he would still carve the geno spell into the geno tablet.

Big sky demon stopped smiling. She looked at Han Sen for a while. Han Sen felt a bit uncomfortable. He felt like a monkey being looked at in a zoo.

“What are you looking at? Just spill the beans already.” Han Sen frowned.

Big sky demon frowned. “I know some geno spells, and the geno spells I know are better than the ones Ancient Devil knows. Would you like to try them?”

“Do I look stupid to you?” Han Sen pointed to his nose.

He knew he would get backlash from the geno tablet. Han Sen would not draw anything more on the geno tablet. He trusted the solidness of his genes, but he did not need to risk a death wish.

Big sky demon said, “My geno spell is a complete password. With this password, the geno tablet will be returned to its original self, the 33 skies will be repaired, and the space cracks will not happen again. Even if Sky King’s son awakened, he would be unable to break the 33 skies. But…”

Han Sen realized he hated the word “but.” Just hearing it gave him a headache.
