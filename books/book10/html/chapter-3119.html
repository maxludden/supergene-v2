<p>“You’ve been talking a lot, but you have yet to tell us where we
can dig up the gene egg.” Han Sen did not understand anything about
the light abyss, and he had never heard of Tian Shan. He just
wanted to know where he could find a gene egg Bald Guy laughed.
“There’s no need to rush proceedings. Although the formation is
similar, in this world, it is impossible to have two God Spirit
Blood-Pulses that are completely the same. Even if they were
similar, there would be differences. You need to calculate the
granular details. We should go forward. If we reach an area where
there might be a gene egg, I will be able to tell.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to tell the man was very smart. He was clever
but not truly excellent. He could not locate a gene egg via
discerning the God Spirit Blood – Pulse’s direction. He could only
discover one when it was within his proximity.</p>
<p>Even so, he was better at it than Han Sen. Thus, he had to
listen to him.</p>
<p>The God Wind Dragon was headed deeper into the Gold Crystal
System. They traveled past many planets. Bald Guy said passed every
single one of them until the fourth day of their journey. It was
then that Bald Guy’s eyes turned bright. He looked toward a planet
and said, “That planet has a high-class gene egg</p>
<p>on it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked in that direction and saw a lifeless planet
covered in rocks and dust. There was also a large crater on it,
which had been left behind by a meteorite.</p>
<p>At this time, the rocks and dust were shining like gems. They
were almost glowing.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen many varieties of this kind of planet the past
four days. He was not able to tell what was so special about this
planet.</p>
<p>Bald Guy steered the God Wind Dragon in the direction of the
planet. He commanded it to fly low and look around. Not long later,
he happily said, “This cannot be an incorrect judgment. This place
must have a gene egg.”</p>
<p>Although this God Spirit Blood-Pulse was scary, since it had
just formed, the gene race inside the God Spirit Blood-Pulse had
yet to hatch. They did not need to worry.</p>
<p>The biggest danger they faced was the other humans there to dig
up the gene eggs and gene races that already existed.</p>
<p>Such a scary God Spirit Blood-Pulse had been born. If there was
a gene race that already lived there, and they had consumed many
gene eggs, they could have evolved terribly.</p>
<p>But this was a lifeless planet. No one was able to see a gene
race, so they did not have to worry.</p>
<p>As to the presence of other humans, Han Sen had yet to spot
anyone else. After the three of them came to a halt, they started
digging in the area Bald Guy marked.</p>
<p>After digging under a stone for three feet, they saw a white
light gene egg. It was the size of a basketball. It was like a
snow-white jade.</p>
<p>Bald Guy happily grabbed the gene egg. After looking at it, he
determined that he could not identify what sort of gene egg it was.
“Although I do not know which species this is, judging from its
look and presence, it’s not a low-class gene race. It should be at
least a marquise-class gene race. We should keep digging. This land
pulse should contain more than one gene egg.” After saying that,
Bald Guy put the gene eggs aside to keep digging. Just as Bald Guy
had said, they found four gene eggs from the land pulse. They all
looked to be the same kind.</p>
<p>Bald Guy kept two from the haul. Han Sen and Li Bing Yu each
received one.</p>
<p>The three of them remained on the planet searching for land
pulses and digging gene eggs. It really was a super God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. There were many land pulses and gene eggs. It only
took them half a day to find four land pulses. They dug up a dozen
gene eggs. Unfortunately, they were only marquise and duke class.
Although their levels were not too low, and they were likely worth
quite a bit, they were of no use to Han Sen.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many humans riding gene races flew through the
skies. Most of them left when laying eyes on the God Wind
Dragon.</p>
<p>The God Wind Dragons’ ultimate body was quite intimidating. It
made Bald Guy’s cockiness increase.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Li Bing Yu followed Bald Guy. They all managed to
dig up a trove of gene eggs. Bald Guy kept leading the God Wind
Dragon to locate land pulses. After finding a land pulse, he gave
it to Han Sen and Li Bing Yu and continued the search. The three of
them worked together quite well. Han Sen did not think there was a
problem, but Li Bing Yu felt scorned. “This Bald Guy is very good
at bluffing, but his God Spirit Blood-Pulse knowledge is fairly
average. The Gold Crystal System really is a place like a light
abyss, but the Gold Crystal System itself is made of seven planets.
It has a seven-star fighting formation, which affects the light
abyss formation. It will become a ghost star light formation. Once
in that formation, there are only seven real places that can yield
a god-class gene egg. This planet is not one of seven planets with
seven stars.”</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu was quite knowledgeable about land pulses. She also
had deeply investigated God Spirit Blood-Pulse skills. Although she
was not as great as Mister Wei, she was better than Bald Guy, who
had only learned half of what she knew.</p>
<p>“How do I lure Han Sen to the real seven planets?” Li Bing Yu
followed Han Sen. Her primary purpose was not for digging up a gene
egg.</p>
<p>She wanted to know how strong Han Sen’s power truly was.
Although everyone claimed he murdered Steel Scene in the Ice Snow
God Temple, it was seemingly just a legend. No one had actually
witnessed what Han Sen was really like.</p>
<p>Bald Guy seemed hurried as he rode the God Wind Dragon to where
Han Sen was. He shouted at Han Sen, who was in the middle of
digging, “Old Han, stop digging! You should come here! I found
something good!”</p>
<p>“I have almost finished here,” Han Sen said while he kept
digging. “I can go there later.”</p>
<p>Bald Guy jumped down and pulled Han Sen with him. He dragged him
out of the hole and said, “What are you digging for? I found a land
pulse that can shock the sky. It might have a god-class gene egg.
Let’s forget about this one. We can come back later.”</p>
<p>After that, Bald Guy pulled Han Sen onto the God Wind Dragon. He
invited Li Bing Yu along for the ride. They flew toward a mountain
that had high and low spots. Li Bing Yu thought, “I’ll be damned if
they can find a god-class gene egg here.”</p>
<p>The God Wind Dragon flew to the upper part of the small, stone
mountain. Bald Guy looked at the stone mountain’s position and
said, “Look at what is over there.”</p>
<p>Han Sen and Li Bing Yu went toward where Bald Guy pointed. They
saw the little stone mountain had an old tree at its center.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know any land pulse skills, and he could not
feel the presence of the old tree, but he knew that the old tree
must have been very special.</p>
<p>This was a planet without life, so this was not just any old
tree. Even bacteria were unable to live there, so how could an old
tree be growing?</p>
<p>Han Sen had a closer look. The old tree had a lot of fruit on
it. The branches bloomed with pink flowers. It was like a plum
tree.</p>
<p>The entire Gold Crystal System was affected by the God Spirit
Blood – Pulse’s weird light, but the old tree did not shine.</p>
<p>It was like an ordinary tree. It was full of flowers. Although
it looked very average, it was strange for this ordinary plum tree
to be where it was.</p>
