  Dong!

Scary power hit the star tyrannosaurus rex in the back of the head. It was like she was striking a block of steel. Huangfu Jing’s slashing power was not even able to leave the slightest mark on her foe’s skull.

Huangfu Jing went silent. The young man, who had been happy, opened his eyes and mouth wide. He had been rendered unable to speak.

He knew how scary Huangfu Jing was. Even top-class elites from the three high races were unable to defeat her in combat. Her attack, which seemed perfect by all accounts, could not harm the star tyrannosaurus rex at all. It was something that seemed impossible to believe.

“Roar!” The star tyrannosaurus rex roared into the sky. It raised its head and shook Huangfu Jing in the sky. Its roaring sound was like a spreading shockwave.

All the creatures were attacked by the shockwave, and they all turned into dust because of it. Even the powerful plant xenogeneics suffered the same fate.

Blergh!

A few young men up front were attacked by the shockwave. Their mouths spilled blood as they flew backward. While they were flying backward, their bodies kept breaking.

Huangfu Jing suddenly appeared in front of the young men. Her time and space powers spread like flowers to inhibit the shockwave from dealing damage to them.

Her space powers were transparent like an invisible screen, yet they blocked the shockwaves. She was also affected by the shockwave. Huangfu Jing’s body fell backward. She left two deep trenches with her legs in the ground.

“Run!” Huangfu Jing coldly yelled. Her time and space powers exploded again. She stopped falling back and blocked the scary shockwaves.

The young men looked as if they had woken up from a dream. They collected their wounded and returned to the base.

The star tyrannosaurus rex noticed it was unable to overcome Huangfu Jing’s time and space powers, so it became incredibly angry. Its powerful back legs picked up power, making its body fly toward Huangfu Jing like a launched cannonball.

Its body was huge, but its speed was crazy. It was so fast that it was like it had teleported in front of Huangfu Jing. It struck the time and space barrier.

Katcha!

Huangfu Jing’s time and space powers broke like glass. Huangfu Jing coughed up some blood out. Her body was like a wave as she fell back. Her legs cleaved a trench through the ground of a few thousand feet long.

The star tyrannosaurus rex roared into the sky. It was headed for Huangfu Jing. Its body was shining with stars. It was like a meteor shower. Its scary power made the sky shake.

Huangfu Jing’s Super God Spirit mode had time and space elements. It was not hard to dodge the attack, but there were lots of geniuses and young people behind her who had come there to study. If she dodged it, the many young men would be killed.

Huangfu Jing did not have the heart to save everyone, but this was Space Garden. It was where humans called home in the geno universe. If she retreated, everything humanity had achieved would be thrown away with the death of these people.

These young people were the hope and light of every other race. If they all died there, on that day, Space Garden would be abandoned by all other races. It might even end up being the enemy of the universe.

Thus, Huangfu Jing did not want to fall back. Her eyes looked bright. Her time and space powers completely exploded. Her hands pushed forward. Her powers twisted time and space.

The star tyrannosaurus rex’s power pierced through the time and space swirl. It created a scary power that broke the armor along Huangfu Jing’s arms. Her hand hit her chest. She flew away.

Boom!

Huangfu Jing’s body punched through a forest. She broke down many plant xenogeneics in her fall. She was extremely bloody and could no longer stand.

Huangfu Jing’s personality was one of fighting fire with fire. She used force to overcome force. She wasn’t great when it came to defense. She hadn’t broken the world either. Her power was much worse than the star tyrannosaurus rex, which had managed to break the world.

The star tyrannosaurus rex made one attack and succeeded. It became more powerful. It was still combined with the life soul, which made it stronger and stronger. Its Break World rate grew higher and higher. The Break World power was becoming scarier and scarier.

The star tyrannosaurus rex turned into a light. It was going to finish off Huangfu Jing, who was still struggling to stand up. A young man looked back and screamed.

The light was all around. Huangfu Jing stood up. She was no longer planning on falling back. She forced her time and space powers to rise and build a shield for her. She wanted to block the star tyrannosaurus rex’s next attack.

Anyone with a pair of eyes could tell Huangfu Jing was too wounded. She would not be able to endure another one of those mighty hits.

Pang!

The star tyrannosaurus rex hit Huangfu Jing. A sword air broke space and came. An overbearing sword air slashed the light. It did not break the star tyrannosaurus rex’s light, but it made the star tyrannosaurus rex’s body fall back.

The sword air broke. Gu Qingcheng’s body appeared in the shattering sword air.

The star tyrannosaurus rex kept attacking. Another sword air came down on the star tyrannosaurus rex’s light. It was a white crystal great sword. The person holding the sword was a holy lady with white wings.

The lady was like an angel who was blasted into the sky. She flapped her wings and tried to stabilize her body.

The star tyrannosaurus rex became a light. Its attacks did not stop. It was still going for Huangfu Jing. There was suddenly the shadow of a gold man standing in front of the star tyrannosaurus rex. He had the figure of a gold Buddha. He hit the star tyrannosaurus rex.

Lin Feng, who was very good when it came to defense, managed to block the attacks of the star tyrannosaurus rex. Its power was also weakened by Little Angel and Gu Qingcheng, but Lin Feng’s body still stumbled back. He spewed out blood. His gold armor had many cracks.

“Where did this monster come from?” Gu Qingcheng looked at the star tyrannosaurus rex and frowned.

“I do not know. I only know that we must kill it at all costs.” Huangfu Jing gnashed her teeth and stood up. Her body broke space and vanished. She went behind the star tyrannosaurus rex. Her legs struck the legs of the star tyrannosaurus rex.

“Not bad!” Gu Qingcheng was not slow. Her greatsword had a shocking sky sword air arise. It was headed for the neck of the star tyrannosaurus rex.

Little Angel and Lin Feng did not speak. One palm and one sword attacked both sides of the star tyrannosaurus rex’s rib bones.

Four people attacked the star tyrannosaurus rex together, but the star tyrannosaurus rex roared into the sky. The sonic powers had become visible.

Huangfu Jing, Gu Qingcheng, Little Angel, and Lin Feng were also stopped by the sonic power. They were only one inch away from the star tyrannosaurus rex’s skin, but they could not make contact with their foe.

They were attacked by the shockwave. Their mouths, ears, eyes, and nose profusely bled. They were badly injured.
