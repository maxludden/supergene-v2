<p>Blood that looked like crystals was coming out of all of his wounds. God only knew how many bones had been broken in his body. It made Han Sen’s entire presence look terrible.</p>

<p>The black-scaled dragon was very excited. It kept firing dragon breath. All its dragon scales cut across Han Sen’s body. The beast really enjoyed killing, and it was not in a rush to use the stone lantern to get rid of Han Sen.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Han Sen’s shoulder was struck by the dragon eye light. His left shoulder bone totally vanished. It was like he had been bitten by an invisible monster. The wound shone with blood crystals.</p>

<p>Han Sen was in extreme pain. He frowned, but his expression did not change. He coldly looked at the black dragon and said, “Are you having fun?”</p>

<p>Han Sen’s body was now riddled with a thousand holes. There was no telling how many times the black dragon had hit him. If Han Sen had been an ordinary true god xenogeneic, he would have died.</p>

<p>Luckily, Han Sen’s body had been reinforced four times. That was what had enabled him to survive up until now.</p>

<p>Of course, he had deliberately done that. Otherwise, half of the wounds on his body could have been avoided. Han Sen had not planned on dodging. He even deliberately used his body to make sure he got hit. The only attacks he evaded were the ones that would have surely killed him.</p>

<p>“Roar!” The black dragon did not care about any of that. It released some dragon cries. It wanted to hurt Han Sen again.</p>

<p>This time, Han Sen did not allow his body to take the hit. He pulled out a Buddha light, which was shaped like a moon, from his waist. It was a very thin knife.</p>

<p>The moment Han Sen pulled out the knife, the Buddha light covered his body. Han Sen’s wounds almost instantly disappeared. His body was back in tip-top condition.</p>

<p>The cause karma knife unleashed the Buddha light on his aggressor. It was like a sun flooding the universe in bright light.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He slashed toward the black-scaled dragon’s dragon cry attack. The scary knife light was like a blade that tore through the sky. It broke the dragon cry’s shockwaves and proceeded toward the black dragon.</p>

<p>He used the cause karma knife for this attack because it had the ability to absorb all the damage he had just endured. The power that had accumulated was almost equal to all of the attacks Han Sen had accepted. With Han Sen’s own power, along with the powerful knife skills, even a true god top-class xenogeneics like the black-scaled dragon was shocked. It did not dare accept such an attack. It twisted its body. It was like a dragon in space trying to escape.</p>

<p>It was a shame it had underestimated the cause karma knife power so much. The cause was already there, and the karma would come. The black-scaled dragon had to use its own power to block it. It could not escape the light.</p>

<p>The dragon saw the knife light coming right for it. It was tearing through space. No matter what the beast tried to do, it could not establish a distance between it. It lowered its head, wanting to blow the stone lantern in its hands. It wanted to use the stone lantern’s fire power to break this attack.</p>

<p>The dragon breath came out from its mouth as if it was miles away. It was unable to blow the lantern flame in front of him.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s time area could not affect the stone lantern, but it was able to affect the black dragon. Han Sen used a time area to limit the dragon from emitting its dragon presence. He delayed his opponent to buy time. The dragon presence could not reach the flame of the lantern, which was actually quite close to it.</p>

<p>When the dragon realized what was going on, it was too late. At that moment, the knife light came down. It struck the black dragon’s forehead.</p>

<p>The black dragon was past the point of no return. It did not plan on doing anything else. It gathered up power and used its head to take the hit.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>Dragon blood came out like a spring of water. The dragon’s head was cut open by Han Sen’s knife. It was cut clean through the center. The purple knife light also traveled through it with a scary ripping power. The way the power went forward was like it was splitting bamboo. It cut open half of the black dragon’s big body.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not have time to see if the black dragon was dead or not. His body flashed and teleported directly before the black dragon. He took the stone lantern.</p>

<p>If it was not for the stone lantern, even though it was a true god elite, Han Sen would not have had so much trouble eliminating the fiend.</p>

<p>Han Sen grabbed the stone lantern and teleported away. He teleported to another of the dragon’s talons. He wanted to retrieve the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze.</p>

<p>Before his fingers touched the shield, the black dragon’s claws swept backward. Its body, which had been cut in half, was combined again. The wounds instantly recovered like it had not been injured before.</p>

<p>“That’s a very powerful body recovery power,” Han Sen complimentarily said.</p>

<p>The body recovery power of dragon xenogeneics was strong. This black dragon, in particular, was quite outstanding. It was like it had an immortal body.</p>

<p>The black-scale dragon saw the stone lantern being taken and he was furious. Black clouds rose and carried endless suppression on its way toward Han Sen.</p>

<p>“Ignorant little dragon! How dare you offend God’s Father. If you do not stop, I am going to kill you!” Han Sen was holding the stone lantern. He generated his Xuan Yellow Sutra power. He pointed at the flame and pierced it.</p>

<p>When the Xuan Yellow power went through the flame, it touched the white flame. It made the Xuan Yellow power turn white. It was headed for the black-scales dragon.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt like the stone lantern was something of a booster. After the Xuan Yellow Sutra was cast through the lantern, the power had been increased by a great magnitude.</p>

<p>Buzz!</p>

<p>The Xuan Yellow Sutra broke the dragon presence and landed on the black-scaled dragon. Han Sen saw the dragon’s giant black self-cogwheel get pushed by the Xuan Yellow power. It was spinning backward.</p>

<p>The black-scaled dragon’s face changed as its body began to twitch and transform. It tried to fight the Xuan Yellow power, but nothing worked. Its body quickly devolved, and its power went weak. He went from true god to butterfly class.</p>

<p>Han Sen was happy. With the power he had, it should have been hard to turn the black-scaled dragon’s self-cogwheel. Now, he had the stone lantern to close the gap. He made the big, black-scaled dragon turn into butterfly class. It didn’t take long, but it was still very shocking.</p>

<p>“This is a very good stone lantern! It is so powerful. I am afraid this is stronger than a god personality armament like Sky Vine Radish.” Han Sen was elated.</p>

<p>Now, he did not have the time to admire his handiwork. He pulled out his knife and slashed toward the black-scaled dragon.</p>

<p>The dragon had been true god class, so Han Sen was unable to beat it. Now that it was butterfly class, Han Sen could easily beat the black-scaled dragon.</p>

<p>Using the time area, the black-scaled dragon was unable to escape. It slashed like mad, cutting the black-scaled dragon into pieces.</p>

<p>The black-scaled dragon was not dead yet. Han Sen used his Under the Sky Knife skill. It made countless knife lights cross each other. It cut the dragon’s body to pieces.</p>

<p>The dragon’s body was becoming true god class again. It was going to put its body back together again after it had been sliced into pieces. Han Sen saw something shining inside the dragon’s mouth. He slashed and broke the shiny thing.</p>

<p>Blergh!</p>

<p>The dragon’s dead body was like a leaking balloon. It quickly deflated. Dragon blood started to gush out. Han Sen was covered with dragon blood.</p>
