<h3>Chapter 2044</h3>

<p>The battle continued to rage upon the surface of the sea.
Fortunately, it had little effect on the ocean depths.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a boom and something massive fell into the
sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly looked towards it through the scope. The
xenogeneic Dragon God had fallen, kicking up goliath waves. Even
the sea bed was affected as the churning water raised swirls of
sand and debris.</p>
<p>It seemed that the Dragon God had lost consciousness. Its body
sank, and when Han Sen saw its head, he noted that its skull had
been cracked. The hammer-wielding turtle had probably plonked it
pretty hard.</p>
<p>“Shit! That dual-hammer turtle is that strong?” Han Sen was
shocked.</p>
<p>The dual-hammer turtle quickly dropped into the sea after the
Dragon God. The hammer came down to strike the Dragon God’s head
again, and what was left of its skull was sundered. The turtle
snatched a blue orb out of the monster’s remains and swam away.</p>
<p>The Dragon God’s body slowly sank through the water until it
came down near Han Sen.</p>
<p>A while passed, and the dual-hammer turtle did not return. Xius
and Dragon Fifteen arrived next to the corpse.</p>
<p>“Xius, do you know what this creature is?” Dragon Fifteen asked
Xius.</p>
<p>Xius looked at the Dragon God’s body and said, “I’m not sure,
but its power should be the equivalent of something half- deified.
The dual-hammer turtle already took the most important item, but
the body of the beast itself should still prove useful. Its blue
scales, especially so. If what Long Shan said was true, and the
scales can speed up one’s evolution, then they will be a prized
treasure.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking the same thing! It is lucky for the Dragon. Long
Ying, quickly prep the body for transport,” Dragon Fifteen said to
Long Ying.</p>
<p>Long Ying nodded and swam closer to the Dragon God’s body. She
tried to pick it up.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched her work, regretting that there was nothing he
could do. He couldn’t beat Long Ying in a fight, so he couldn’t
interfere. A half-deified’s body was a valuable treasure, but he
valued his own life more.</p>
<p>But when Long Ying came down next to the Dragon God’s body and
grabbed its tail, her Duke powers were not enough to lift the
corpse.</p>
<p>Long Ying’s face changed. She spread her dragon wings to emit
the shadow of a dragon. Her arms transformed into the scaly limbs
of a dragon. She managed to shift the body a little, but she was
unable to lift it.</p>
<p>“Fifteen, this xenogeneic’s body is too heavy. We need more
assistance if we want to move it,” Long Ying told Dragon
Fifteen.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen frowned, and then he said, “In that case, Xius
and I will watch the body while you go and find help.”</p>
<p>That evil crystallizer might still be around. How about I stay
here and you go for help?” Long Ying did not want to leave Dragon
Fifteen unprotected.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You go,” Dragon Fifteen said, waving his hands
dismissively. He wanted to get this done as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Seeing Long Ying leave, though, Han Sen was delighted. If it was
just Dragon Fifteen and Xius—two Marquises—he might have a chance
to nab the spoils.</p>
<p>But he still had to consider the weight of the Dragon God’s
body. Not even Long Ying’s Duke strength could lift it. Even if Han
Sen summoned his Destiny’s Tower, he doubted that he could absorb
it and take it away.</p>
<p>“What can I steal?” Han Sen used his scope to examine the body,
but he didn’t know much about the creature. He couldn’t tell if
what he was seeing was actually good stuff.</p>
<p>“Long Shan and the others said that its scales can speed up the
evolution process, so the scales have to be decent, at least. But
it has too many scales for me to try to grab them all. Before I
finished harvesting it, Long Ying would be back with help. And
then, I certainly would not be able to run. Xius and Dragon Fifteen
are here, as well, and they are annoying enough.” Han Sen was
hesitating.</p>
<p>At this time, Xius walked in front of the Dragon God’s body.
Observing the creature’s neck, she said, “I don’t know where this
xenogeneic might have come from, but from its appearance, we can
determine that it is definitely some sort of dragon. Aside from the
dragon orb that the turtle stole, the most important thing for us
to take would be the scales. Do you agree?”</p>
<p>Hearing what Xius said, Han Sen turned his scope in the
direction she was looking. He saw a scale on the Dragon God’s neck
that appeared to be growing upside-down. The other scales were
light blue, but this one was so dark that it was almost black. It
also seemed to be shaped differently than the other scales.</p>
<p>The other scales looked like fans, and they were the size of
grinding discs. That Upside-Down Scale, however, was only around
the size of a plate. It was shaped like a heart.</p>
<p>“Not bad. This half-deified xenogeneic is one of the Dragon.
That is the Upside-Down Scale.” Dragon Fifteen walked over to the
body and tried to tear off the scale.</p>
<p>But when he grabbed the scale by its edges, he was unable to
remove it. Dragon God was dead, and its lifeforce was gone. The
flesh had certainly weakened. But even so, it seemed that a
Marquise would have difficulty removing the Upside-Down Scale.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen frowned. Power swelled within his body as he
spread his wings. He grew three feet taller, and his muscles
hardened like steel. His scales all turned black.</p>
<p>“Good grief. This Dragon Fifteen is a xenogeneic. Are all
Dragons xenogeneics, I wonder?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Watching this display, Han Sen thought that Dragon Fifteen might
have been more powerful than Dragon Thirteen. The Dragon were born
strong, and any pure Dragon could become stronger than those of any
other race. Their claim of being the bravest was not some
bluff.</p>
<p>His nails became blades, and Dragon Fifteen poked them into the
flesh beside the scale. He cut around the scale and it popped
loose.</p>
<p>“Fuck! That’s it.” Han Sen was angry. He aimed Spell at Dragon
Fifteen and pulled the trigger. He emerged from the shell and ran
towards the Dragon God’s corpse.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen seemed to be ready. He gave a hum, then swung his
hand at the bullet fired from Spell. The bullet was cut in half,
then exploded.</p>
<p>As this occurred, Dragon Fifteen waved his other hand at Han
Sen. The talons shook the water into a number of blades that headed
towards Han Sen.</p>
