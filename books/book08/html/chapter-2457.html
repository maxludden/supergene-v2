<h2>Exposed</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2457</h3>

<p>The woman looked into her reflection in the pool. Her gaze
suddenly sharpened.</p>
<p>“She can see me!” Han Sen knew this was very bad, but he had
already considered this eventuality. If the being Han Sen inhabited
was close to a reflective surface, Han Sen knew his presence would
be exposed sooner or later. So, he didn’t panic.</p>
<p>When the woman saw the strange appearance of her eye, she didn’t
panic, either. She smiled and said, “Interesting. You dared to use
an eye trick on someone like me? You are brave.”</p>
<p>After that, the woman released a burning golden light in her
eyes. It started in her pupils and spread across her irises, slowly
fighting back the red and transforming it into gold.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s chest tightened. He didn’t know what sort of power
that woman had employed, but after the gold light consumed her
eyes, the woman put away her power. As soon as she released her
power, the gold color extinguished and the red reappeared.</p>
<p>“Huh, my Goldeneye didn’t work. This is tricky,” the woman said
with a pleased smile. The color of her eye changed again. This
time, a deep black swept over her irises. The black rolled over the
entirety of her eyeballs, overwhelming the red.</p>
<p>Once her eyes had fallen completely into darkness, the woman
stopped feeding power into the technique she had used. Once again,
as soon as she released the technique, the red returned to her
eyes.</p>
<p>“Darkness Eye didn’t work either. Fascinating.” The woman
proceeded to try many different eye talents as she attempted to
expunge Han Sen, but they only succeeded in making his vision go
funny. Nothing seemed to affect the power of the Blood Eye Evil God
beast soul, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen was delighted with the performance of his beast soul.
“So this is the power of a mutant deified beast soul. Even this
woman cannot do anything against me.”</p>
<p>“How interesting.” The woman was now smiling widely. Rather than
being upset at her repeated failures, she looked thrilled.</p>
<p>After that, the woman didn’t use any more eye skills. She raised
her fingertips and gathered up some sort of light. Wisps of
spiritual light rose from her fingertips, turning into a mirror
that hovered before her face.</p>
<p>The mirror hung before the woman’s eye, but there was no human
reflection inside it. A weird light swirled around the surface of
the silver mirror, and eventually, it turned a deep red color and
began to coil in tighter and tighter swirls. In moments, the red
color had changed to depict the face of the Blood Eye Evil God.</p>
<p>“Ah, it is Blood Eye Evil God. No wonder my eye skills didn’t
work.” When the woman saw the image of Blood Eye Evil God, she
smiled in sudden understanding. She raised her finger and pressed
it to her forehead just above her eyes. More spiritual light went
into her.</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes shattered like glass. The shadowy space that
Han Sen inhabited collapsed, and he was forced to come out. He fell
onto the ground and immediately tried to leap away from the
house.</p>
<p>“What’s this? That isn’t Blood Eye Evil God,” the woman murmured
in surprise. Her eyes healed immediately, and her hands never
stopped moving. She raised one hand, and a crystal ball flew toward
Han Sen to trap him.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved to evade the crystal ball, but the woman shifted
the position of her hand and cast a few lights that struck Han Sen
with pinpoint precision. Han Sen’s body became much heavier, and
his speed dropped drastically. A deep ache sank into his back, and
he felt as if he had ejaculated prematurely and then become
impotent. He was suddenly struck with the pain of a woman’s period,
and his eyesight became blurry. Pain and nausea swept through him.
God only knew how many geno arts the woman had cast to give him
such a wretched series of debilitations.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Jadeskin Area, which transformed his body into
jade-like ice. The woman’s debilitating geno arts no longer worked
on Han Sen, allowing him to dodge the second crystal attack. Then,
he leaped out the window.</p>
<p>The woman’s face looked like the face of a cat in pursuit of a
mouse. It was as if she had made a fascinating discovery. She ran
out of the wooden house, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to fly away and escape the island, but as soon as
he moved, he saw the crystal ball racing toward him.</p>
<p>Han Sen evaded it, but the crystal ball exploded. It transformed
into a giant crystal net that covered the entire island. Han Sen
had nowhere to run.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fingers wriggled like mad, casting sword silks as he
attempted to lift the net of crystal. He kept the net from falling
on him, and his mind raced to find a way out of this
predicament.</p>
<p>After a few of her attacks, though, Han Sen noticed that the
woman wasn’t as strong as he initially believed her to be. She had
the power of a King class being at the most, he wagered. But she
possessed such a variety of geno arts that she could do almost
anything. She had an infinite supply of surprises up her sleeve,
that was for sure.</p>
<p>When she saw that her crystal net couldn’t trap Han Sen, the
woman changed her approach. Her fingers became like blades, and she
used all sorts of geno arts to attack. Han Sen had a hard time
dealing with her.</p>
<p>Han Sen had encountered many powerful opponents in his time, and
some of them had learned many skills, but this woman could use
literally anything. She could fuse a dozen skills into a single
attack. He had never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>Her attack might start out as fire powers, but when they got
close to Han Sen, they might transform into gold or water powers.
An attack might rage toward him, but then become as soft as a kiss
when it landed.</p>
<p>Her fingers, palms, knives, and swords didn’t allow Han Sen a
moment to breathe. This wasn’t a fight. It was like the woman was
conducting an artistic performance of many tricks.</p>
<p>Han Sen fought to defend himself, but he couldn’t win. And with
the crystal net in place over the island, Han Sen knew that he
couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>The woman looked shocked, too, though. Han Sen’s attacks were
very familiar to her in some ways, but they were also quite
different than she expected.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace’s Textless Book isn’t completely the same, but it is
just… And the breaking power is not the same… Fascinating…” The
woman was captivated by Han Sen’s skills.</p>
<p>The woman knew too many geno arts. Han Sen used skills that he
thought would take advantage of the woman’s weaknesses. But she
always used another unexpected geno art to escape every crisis, and
Han Sen found himself fighting for his life instead.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you. I came here purely by
happenstance. I mean you no harm, so please forgive me,” Han Sen
pleaded, as he continued to fight.</p>
<p>“Use a few more geno arts. I have seen these before,” the woman
commanded, not actually responding to Han Sen’s plight.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew many geno arts, but he didn’t think that this
situation called for them. Instead, he stuck with skills that he
knew could counter her attacks.</p>
<p>The woman, seeing that Han Sen was only using a few skills to
break all of her geno arts, looked profoundly annoyed.</p>
<p>“Down!” The woman waved her hand, and the crystal net snapped
Han Sen’s sword silks and fell toward him. Many substance chains
now writhed within the crystal net.</p>
<p>“She’s deified!” Han Sen realized that the woman had been
playing with him. She hadn’t used her real powers up until now.</p>
