    <p>
      The little angel flapped her wings and flew directly to the big
      monster&#8217;s head, as Han Sen took off running to the smaller monster.
    </p>

    <p>
      His fitness had almost reached the level of a juvenile super creature at
      this point, and with the Flaming Rex Spike in hand, it wouldn&#8217;t be
      too difficult for him to slay his target.
    </p>

    <p>
      The small black-scaled monster, seeing Han Sen run towards it, shouted.
      Its mouth became a black, gaping maw with a set of wretched fangs piercing
      out of that darkness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen swung the Flaming Rex Spike down towards it. The monster did not
      flee or evade the attack, and instead used its own head as a deflector.
      When the rex spike collided with the black-scales, a deep noise was
      emitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt a terrible power surge into his hands from the
      monster&#8217;s head, as the rex spike failed to crack open the scales of
      the beast. The power that pushed back was so strong, it hurled Han Sen
      into the air and sent him through a few spins as he went.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is quite powerful. This thing must have a really high
      vitality.&#8221; Han Sen borrowed strength from the air he was borne onto
      and returned to engage the small monster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Yunyi and his group were frozen stiff, watching the crazy waves that
      continued to surge out of the wild waters of the lake. Han Sen and his
      angel had fearlessly gone to battle the monsters there, and in the chaos
      of the scene, it was difficult to tell who would emerge triumphant.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy crap! Where did this elite come from? He can actually go
      toe-to-toe with these things and potentially beat them?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That angel-looking lady must be a pet beast soul. It&#8217;s so
      strong and beautiful.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you guys hanging around for? We should quickly retreat and
      fall back.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel invaded every inch of the big monster&#8217;s personal
      space and attacked its head repeatedly. She wanted to strike its eyes and
      blind it, but the monster&#8217;s vitality was extraordinarily high, and
      so its flesh was incredibly difficult to get through. Unable to deal much
      in the way of damage, even the little angel ended up dodging more than she
      could attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her greatsword smacked the creature&#8217;s head numerous times, but its
      skull was sufficiently guarded by its hardy scales. Despite the effort of
      her attacks, only a shallow scratch mark was left behind by each strike.
      In comparison to the beast at large, she might as well have tried tickling
      the fiend.
    </p>

    <p>
      The small monster was angrier and less composed, however. It ignored Han
      Sen&#8217;s attacks and instead tried to attack him, even at the cost of
      ensuring its own defense. The black scales looked tougher than the big
      monster&#8217;s, however, and the creature itself looked more powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big monster took notice of the little one chasing Han Sen around,
      which put its concern at ease. With continued composure, it calmly fought
      the little angel that had targeted it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen fell back more and more, attempting to lure the smaller creature
      away. He was initially worried that the small one might not follow, so he
      prepared to use his Devil-Eye Spider beast soul in order to seduce it. But
      this was not necessary, due to the monster&#8217;s feistiness. Attracting
      it his way was the easiest aspect of the ensuing battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen eventually managed to lead the small monster into the nearby
      woods. Its teeth gnashed in a fearsome bloodlust as it chased after Han
      Sen with murder in its eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the little monster was strong and powerful, it came as a surprise
      to Han Sen that it had evidently not lived for very long. It clearly knew
      little of the world at large. Now, seeing Han Sen stop, it gaped its
      hungry maw and leapt towards him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fangs of its mouth were like daggers as they came, but Han Sen did not
      fall back at the sight of their gnashing hunger. Just as the mouth came
      close, ready to tear his face off, Han Sen drove the rex spike deep into
      the creature&#8217;s mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Flaming Rex Spike spun like a drill, as flames blazed and wreathed
      their way around it. With Han Sen&#8217;s surprise attack, the weapon was
      shoved deep into the monster&#8217;s throat. Like mud from a manic
      drillbit, blood squirted out from the ravaged throat of the beast.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little monster squealed in absolute pain, but its cry was muted due to
      the presence of the ravenous rex spike.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart pounded with the thrill, as he channeled an infinite
      source of power into the rex spike. His push with the weapon did not
      recede, and Han Sen slowly worked the weapon into the creature&#8217;s
      stomach.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a moment&#8217;s notice, the two-yard-long rex spike had been driven a
      full three feet into the mouth of the super creature. And Han Sen primed
      it to go deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amidst the blood and shredded flesh of its butchered throat, the monster
      could do little but shake its head. As it shook vigorously, it sent Han
      Sen and the rex spike flying into the air. The strength of its wiggle was
      too powerful, and even Han Sen was unable to withstand the velocity. The
      little monster let out a cry of pain after throwing away its violent
      aggressor, and this alerted the big monster to the little one&#8217;s
      danger. Immediately, its concerned parent stomped its way through the
      trees to its aid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant, hulking body made the ground quake with each step it took. The
      lake was thrown into utter turmoil as it left the battered waters behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the little angel wanted to stop the approach of the big monster,
      she couldn&#8217;t deal a critical hit to the monster or find a weak spot
      she could exploit. Thus, nothing she did could grab its attention. Even as
      she repeatedly struck its scaly-skin, the sword could do nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the big monster heading his way, Han Sen knew it would only have to
      take two more steps before it was directly in front of him. He knew he had
      to act fast, so he quickly retrieved his rex spike and ran towards the
      little monster. Without thinking, he rammed it up the baby monster&#8217;s
      butthole with all his might.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rex spike was driven an entire meter up its backside, as blood burst
      from the exploited hole like unclogged plumbing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its upper-body had already been severely injured, and now, it&#8217;s
      lower-body was being quickly made the same. It squealed in agony and fell
      down to the ground. It exerted much effort in trying to stabilize itself,
      but try as it might, it could not stand back up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not content to stop there, and he was determined to push
      harder and end the monster&#8217;s life as soon as he possibly could. But
      the big monster was approaching quickly, like a mountain bearing down on
      him. Han Sen knew he couldn&#8217;t remain where he was much longer, so he
      pulled his rex spike out and retreated.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The giant monster brought another foot down and crushed trees and fallen
      logs into kindling. The diameter of each footprint left behind was ten
      meters. Han Sen dodged the foot, but it only by a small margin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little monster finally managed to regain its balance and stand up,
      then crawled nearby the bigger monster. When the big monster noticed the
      wounds its young one had incurred, its wrath was stoked. Wild flames of
      anger now burned for Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant monster roared and tried to crush Han Sen underfoot once more.
      The vitality-based monster was not something he could compete with, so Han
      Sen had no choice but to fall back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen cast Aero and used it to more easily evade the stomping of the
      raging behemoth.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the while, the little angel continued trying to attack the big
      monster&#8217;s eyes. Her attempts were ineffective, however. The
      monster&#8217;s neck was surprisingly spry, and it managed to duck and
      weave to avoid many of her strikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      As this was unfolding, Han Sen looked for an opportunity to swing back
      around and finish off the smaller monster. Unfortunately for him, the
      opportunity was taking its time in revealing itself. But during this
      intense observation, a new sound came from the skies above.
    </p>

    <p>
      A black and metallic tiger, one with wings, descended from the skies. It
      flew extremely fast and within a second, it landed behind the big monster.
      Its four paws shredded the little monster&#8217;s body. Then, it grabbed
      the little monster, flapped its wings, and took off flying to the west.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That b*stard! Trying to steal my kill, are you?&#8221; Han Sen was
      infuriated, so he took off in flight and chased after the black tiger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only Han Sen was allowed to steal the kills of others, and the thought of
      this black tiger stealing his kill was unacceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big monster, when seeing its little one get captured, ignored Han Sen
      and tried to chase after the black tiger, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black tiger held on to the little monster with ease, despite how many
      tons it undoubtedly weighed. And it was still going too fast for him or
      the big monster to catch up.
