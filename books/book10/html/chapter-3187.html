<p>A mountain pierced through the skies. A strange god temple was on its peak.</p>

<p>The god temple’s structure was very defined. The primary hall was only nine feet tall. It had a few side halls. Overall, it looked very large, but a large god temple like that gave people the feeling that it could easily break. It was hard to describe how weird it was.</p>

<p>When one looked a bit closer, one realized that the god temple was composed of a white substance. It looked like it was made of paper. It was no wonder that it looked like a place that could easily tumble with one stab.</p>

<p>Everything about the white temple was strange. Even the tables, god altar, god stove, and god statues were made of paper. It felt like a very spooky and scary place.</p>

<p>Bao’er looked at the god temple with interest. She seemed to be rather interested in the locale.</p>

<p>Bao’er looked at Rocky Dee and asked with a blink of her eyes, “What would happen if I lit a match in here?”</p>

<p>“This is a god temple. It is not ordinary paper. Water, fire, or any other kind of weapon cannot actually deal harm to this temple.” Rocky Dee sat on a paper chair. He flicked his hands and had two human-sized paper people bring a plate forward. They brought over paper plates and paper cups. They poured out a cup of coffee for Rocky Dee.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee drank his coffee in an elegant posture as he asked Bao’er, “What does the cute little princess want to drink?”</p>

<p>“I want to drink tea.” Bao’er was not polite. She just sat down on the paper chair.</p>

<p>The thin white paper turned into an S shape. Bao’er sat on it. The paper trembled like the thin wings of a cicada, but it did not break. In some ways, it was like a rocking chair.</p>

<p>The paper maid quickly brought a cup of tea over. Bao’er looked at the paper man made of paper with genuine curiosity.</p>

<p>“These paper people look rather funny,” Bao’er said. She watched the paper people with keen interest as she picked up the cup of tea to wet her whistle.</p>

<p>“If you like, I can give you a few of these paper people. I can cut them out into any face you like. If there is some handsome celebrity or general you admire, I can cut them out for you.” Rocky Dee drank his coffee with a warm smile.</p>

<p>“I like your face. Why don’t you give me a paper person that looks just like you?” Bao’er happily looked at Rocky Dee.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee’s eyes twitched a little. He looked at Bao’er, who had a big pair of gleaming eyes. She looked like a clear spring without any dust. It did not look as if she was making a joke or toying with him.</p>

<p>Plus, Bao’er had followed him there without issue. Rocky Dee just thought she was a child who enjoyed playing around.</p>

<p>After thinking about it, Rocky Dee’s lips developed a smile. His beard lifted as he thought, “I really am a handsome gentleman who has thousands of women and goddesses loving me. Despite how troublesome it is to look this fine, I cannot help being so attractive.”</p>

<p>He looked very cocky as his eyebrows raised. Rocky Dee put down his cup. He coughed lightly and asked, “Do you really want it that much?”</p>

<p>Bao’er nodded. Her little hands became two little fists in front of her chest. She looked at Rocky Dee happily as she answered, “Yes. I really, really, really want it. If your face became a paper person, it would look so good.”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee smiled and nodded. “OK. Since you are being so sincere about this, I can make one for you. But this is a limited edition, OK? There will only be one in this entire universe. You need to look after it with the utmost care.”</p>

<p>“I will treat it like the most important thing in my life.” Bao’er raised her head as if she was making a solemn and profound promise.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee loved Bao’er’s attitude. He took out a white sheet of paper and said, “After I make you this, you must stay here nicely until your father comes to pick you up.”</p>

<p>“With your paper copy, it is fine if my father does not come,” Bao’er said.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee felt very cocky and thought, “Being too charming is a bad thing. Even a small little girl like her fancies me to be her daddy. Sigh. This is so troublesome.”</p>

<p>After that, Rocky Dee picked up a sheet of paper. His right hand’s index and middle fingers behaved like a pair of scissors that cut through the sheet. He kept cutting to cut out his face. He put a lot of effort into the task.</p>

<p>It must be stated that Rocky Dee’s skills were very good. Although it was only going to be something like a silhouette without any precise facial details, it looked a lot like him. Even the little beard on it was a bit raised.</p>

<p>After cutting, Rocky Dee trimmed it a little and happily gave it to Bao’er. “You must look after this thing as if it were your child. This is a unique silhouette.”</p>

<p>Bao’er picked up the paper silhouette and looked as if she cherished it greatly. She said, “Thank you, Uncle.”</p>

<p>“Uncle?” Rocky Dee’s eyes twitched. He patted Bao’er on the head and smiled. “Little Princess, you should think about calling me Mister God. If you really want to start calling me Handsome Mister Minister, I think that would be rather dandy. It is up to you, of course.”</p>

<p>” I think calling you an uncle is very fitting,” Bao’er said as she looked at Rocky Dee.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee’s face looked rather glum. He grunted. “Whatever. You just stay here and sit still until Han Sen comes to pick you up.”</p>

<p>“OK. If you are here with me, it is fine if my father does not show,” Bao’er said with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I do not have any time to play around with you. You can entertain yourself to pass the time.” After Rocky Dee said that, he readied himself to leave.</p>

<p>“No, I want you to play with me,” Bao’er said with a shake of her head.</p>

<p>“Who in this world would waste time playing with you? Besides, I am a very busy man.” Rocky Dee wanted to ignore Bao’er. He turned around and walked out of the god temple.</p>

<p>After walking a few steps, he felt as if his body was no longer listening to him. He could no longer control his body. He walked back to Bao’er.</p>

<p>“What… What is going on…” Rocky Dee’s face changed. He tried using power to control his body, but it did not work.</p>

<p>He then saw Bao’er playing with the paper man he had just made.</p>

<p>“Salute!” Bao’er was holding the paper man. She made the paper man perform a saluting gesture.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee’s body lifted its right hand by its own volition. He had no say in it. He was suddenly just like the paper man. He performed the saluting gesture.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee’s face changed. “What… How is this possible… She has that control power… Isn’t she a human girl? A human girl at that age should not have such wicked powers. Even with a powerful gene race, there is no way she could channel so much power without fault. She did not even combine with a gene race. This… What is going on?” Rocky Dee now regretted his deeds. If he had not cut out his own silhouette for Bao’er and given it to her, no matter how strong she was, she would have been unable to control him.</p>

<p>Aside from himself and one of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits, he never thought there would be another being with the same type of power and powerful enough to control him.</p>

<p>Even the God Spirit from the 12 Annihilation God Spirits would have been unable to control him completely with his paper shape.</p>

<p>“Take a dump.” Bao’er moved the paper man to open its legs and squat into a pooping position.</p>

<p>“No… No… I am a gentleman… How could I perform such an embarrassing action?” Rocky Dee shouted at the top of his lungs. His face turned red. He wanted to smack a wall.</p>

<p>But he could not control his body. He looked like the paper man who was taking a dump.</p>
