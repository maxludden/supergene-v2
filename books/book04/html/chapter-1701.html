	<p>Stay Up Late looked at the officer sadly. Without moving an inch, he said, “Officer, it was you who taught me to
		never fall back. It was you who taught me to always do my job. I will never forget that”</p>

	<p>The officer moved his eyes and then stopped. He responded by saying, “If you must be like this, then excuse my
		cruel deeds.”</p>

	<p>After that, the officer swung his white metal sword. But before Stay Up Late could see how it moved, he groaned
		in pain. He now had a wound on his chest that was deep enough to reveal his ribs.</p>

	<p>“That was a warning strike,” the officer said to Stay Up Late.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late looked at the white metal sword and said, “The Western King Sword and the Southern King Wings are so
		powerful. No wonder they are legendary.”</p>

	<p>“I only used 10% of my power!” the officer said.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late looked down on the wound on his chest and calmly said, “Next time you strike, and I don’t dodge,
		please just leave my body here. A special ops operative that doesn’t complete their mission should not return
		home.”</p>

	<p>“Why are you so stubborn?” The officer sounded a bit angry.</p>

	<p>“These are my principles. You taught them to me!” Stay Up Late said.</p>

	<p>“Good. I will teach you another lesson, then. You need to think on the fly,” the officer said and moved his
		Western King Sword again. He did so faster than last time.</p>

	<p>But this time, Stay Up Late moved. It was like he moved with the Western King Sword, except he was a little ahead
		of it.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late grunted, and another wound appeared on his body. This wound was lighter than the last, however, and
		the damage wasn’t so grievous.</p>

	<p>“It looks like you can teach an old dog a new trick.” The officer frowned. The sword had not performed as
		impressively as he had expected, especially after he put even more strength into the second swing.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late laughed and said, “I learned that from Han Sen. Humans are weaker, and their lifespans are shorter,
		but their creativity far exceeds ours. The skills they create are far more ingenious than what the crystallizers
		developed.”</p>

	<p>“You are falling!” the officer grunted. He waved his fire wings and swung his Western King Sword.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late’s movements were similar to Han Sen’s, but not exactly on the mark. He was borrowing some techniques
		and skills, but he was adding them to his own. He was still using mostly his own talents.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late dodged the deadly attack, but he was too weak to escape it all. His body was wounded again. He was
		beginning to look like a bloodman.</p>

	<p>The officer, with armor from two crystallizer kings, was faster and stronger than Stay Up Late.</p>

	<p>Seeing Gugia get killed by Golden Growler, the officer had lost all his patience. He waved his Western King Sword
		and prepared to unleash all his power.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late had managed to avoid getting killed by the previous three strikes, but he had still been hit by
		each. With the wounds incurred, he wouldn’t be able to evade the fourth. The sword was on its way, arcing down
		towards his chest.</p>

	<p>“It’s over!” Stay Up Late sighed. He knew he wouldn’t be able to dodge it, and he knew his body would be cut in
		half.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>Suddenly, a light came from the sky. It hit the Western King Sword with the power of a small sun. It shocked the
		officer and his sword, and the sword missed its target, buying Stay Up Late time.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late’s body moved fast, and he avoided the strike. He looked to the sky in shock.</p>

	<p>The officer’s face changed and he looked up, too. There was a shadow up there, moving quick. And there was a
		light coming down on the officer.</p>

	<p>The officer kept swinging his Western King Sword to try and break the light, but he then saw a giant beetle land.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen had finally come back to Roca, and he saw Stay Up Late was going to get killed. He used the unicorn
		beetle’s weapon systems to save him.</p>

	<p>Seeing the person use a sword to break the beetle’s light, Han Sen was shocked. The beetle’s light was not as
		good as geno armor because the mobility wasn’t up to scratch.</p>

	<p>The officer saw someone appear, and he didn’t want to waste any more time with the unexpected. So, he had to
		finish his task before Zagu was killed.</p>

	<p>He flapped his wings and teleported to the beetle. He slashed towards the beetle and cut a three-meter-long
		crevice through it.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was shocked, so he quickly recalled the beetle. The unicorn beetle could not move fast to evade attacks.
		He was afraid it could very easily be destroyed if that continued.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen!” The officer was shocked when he saw Han Sen emerge from the machine. He used his Western King Sword
		against him, trying to slash him like he had never slashed before.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s face changed and he tried to dodge, but his fitness could not save him from those swipes.</p>

	<p>Before he could move, the glove on his right hand became an armorset that shielded his entire body. Then, the
		fist aligned itself with the arc of the Western King Sword.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The fist hit the sword, and it created an explosion in the sky. It was far worse than the detonation of an atom
		bomb. The impact turned the ground into an ocean. The city became a ruin.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body fell back a few thousand meters. He was rather shocked that he didn’t fall over.</p>

	<p>He knew the immense power of the glove, but even so, he was still sent flying. His chest fell awful, but his
		opponent hadn’t moved an inch. That was a testament to the sheer power he wielded.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not know Western King Sword, Southern King Wings, and the glove were all on the same level. The
		officer was simply stronger than Han Sen, which made the glove appear weaker.</p>

	<p>“Northern King Glove. I did not expect one of the four crystallizer kings’ armors could be found here. Let me
		take the Northern King Glove and the Eastern King Crystal Shoes, then I can get moving.” The officer looked
		excited, staring down at Han Sen in the jade armor.</p>

	<p>He flapped his wings alongside his sword. The officer looked completely murderous, and he wanted to kill Han Sen
		for the glove.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used The Story of Genes and let his energy combine with the armor to assimilate with it.</p>
