    <p>
      Goddess’ mind was still clear, despite her anger. She could feel that Han
      Sen’s butterfly wings were emitting a horrible aura. It wasn’t anything
      normal, and she could already guess it was most likely a super geno core
      he was using.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddess did not know where Han Sen’s super geno core had come from, but
      she wasn’t going to be careless. She pulled out her God Ring again and
      tried to capture Han Sen and bind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Young Super Creature Black Back Dog killed. No beast soul gained. Geno
      Core unobtained. The flesh is edible. Collect the Life Geno Essence to
      gain zero-to-ten super geno points.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement played in Han Sen’s head, but he did not have the time to
      listen. The God Ring was coming for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion King’s mood was a little conflicted, at the moment.
      Although Lion Mountain was strong, Sacred wasn’t weak. He didn’t really
      want to fight Goddess; after all, it was why he had chosen to stall her
      earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Goddess was mad, and many creatures lunged forward to engage with Han
      Sen at once. Little Jade Lion was of a split mind in what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, Little Jade Lion gritted his teeth and yelled to Goddess,
      “Goddess, stop this! Otherwise, I’ll have to be cruel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddess harshly responded, “This human is dead! It’s none of your
      business, but if you choose to help him, I won’t be letting you go again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion King saw that she was fully committed to murdering Han
      Sen, so he commanded his subordinates to move forward and do battle with
      the rest of Sacred’s troops. He didn’t fight, but he didn’t stop Goddess
      directly, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion didn’t want this to go any bigger than it already had, so
      he thought he had discovered a way in which he could quell the madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not care much for anything else. He flapped his wings and
      evaded the incoming God Ring. He was flying directly towards Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that guy really Han Sen? Why does he have a super geno core?” Yu Xuan
      couldn’t believe that was Han Sen, and he thought the human looked like a
      god as he attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao looked at the battle with excitement. “It doesn’t matter how or
      why he has a super geno core. Our chance to proceed has come. When Lion
      Mountain and Sacred are both injured, we can strike and claim the Godlight
      Tunnel for ourselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shit! Han Sen is really that strong? He killed a high-level creature of
      Sacred just like that! This is crazy.” Tang Zhenliu was in shock at the
      spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen had been forced to fight Lion Mountain’s creatures alongside her
      companions. Her eyes looked bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became one of the early demigods of humanity, but she had been unlucky
      to end up in Sacred Shelter as the subordinate of creatures. Her leveling
      process had been extremely slow, and she had only managed to obtain a gold
      geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen knew the Black Back Dog was strong, but Han Sen had managed to kill
      it with one strike. It showed her that Han Sen was again the best of the
      best, possibly out of everything and everyone in the Fourth God’s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He hasn’t been heard from in ten years. I didn’t know he had actually
      come so far.” Queen sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using time and space in her movements, she put on the show of fighting,
      more than anything. She disappeared and jumped around a lot, not really
      engaging them. Above all, she wanted to focus on watching how Han Sen
      battled Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddess saw Han Sen dodge the ring and come for her, but she wasn’t
      afraid. She summoned a short sword and swung it towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short sword was black, and when she swung it, it emitted a black
      light, as if it was tearing a veil through space.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Split-Knife? Goddess brought out her Split-Knife! The Sacred master must
      be very fond of her.” Yu Miao sounded jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Split-Knife was a famous geno core belonging to Sacred Shelter. It could
      cut through anything, and it was said to be indestructible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the master of Split-Knife was still alive, it broke countless geno
      cores belonging to super creatures. Its name was quite well-known across
      all of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Split-Knife was not a berserk super geno core, its power was
      still better than many berserks, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If Goddess brought Split-Knife here with her, Han Sen is sure to die. He
      is so ignorant. He manages to get a little bit of power and then acts
      stupidly reckless. He deserves to die, really,” Yu Xuan said dismissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Yu Xuan and Yu Miao discussed this, Han Sen moved in front of
      Goddess. The Split-Knife in her hand was being swung right at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion King was shocked, and he said, “Goddess brought
      Split-Knife? He is so dead. It’s not like I don’t want to save you, it’s
      just that I really can’t.”
    </p>
    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      When everyone thought Han Sen was dead, they saw him raise his arm to try
      to block her attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is too naive. Not even super creatures can block that knife,” everyone
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next second, Han Sen’s arm displayed a shield that looked like a black
      crab. It managed to successfully block the strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Split-Knife’s black swordlight crashed into the shield, but not even that
      was able to penetrate the defense of the arm shield. It only left a
      scratch that was around one inch deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is that possible? And what is that shield? How could it block
      Split-Knife?” Yu Xuan screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces of those watching changed. No one had believed that Split-Knife
      could be blocked.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The Overbearing Shield displayed that word overbearing, sending the
      Split-Knife’s power back to its owner. Goddess’ wrists were broken, and
      her Split-Knife was sent flying out of her hands. She coughed up blood and
      found herself barreling through the air, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she could use Split-Knife’s power, her body and self geno core
      weren’t super yet. They could not withstand the backlash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen flapped his wings and the red light arced across the sky. Taia
      came forward like a wild wind, and Han Sen cut Goddess in half while she
      was still airborne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the favorite daughter of Sacred Shelter’s leader. Even if Yu Miao
      or Little Lion King possessed Han Sen’s power, they would never have dared
      to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Han Sen had just killed her mercilessly, and they all froze. Yu Miao,
      who wanted to take advantage of the situation, was left in shock. This was
      beyond all her expectations, and she didn’t dare make a move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned. He had killed Goddess, but he did not hear an
      announcement. The two halves of her body faded into the God Ring, and then
      the God Ring disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>“I will kill you!” The angry voice of Goddess echoed through the air.</p>
