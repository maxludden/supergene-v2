    <p>
      Han Sen did not say anything more, but he found the idea of killing Huang
      Mian to be distasteful. It was just as Chen Ran thought, though; Han Sen
      did want to use words to bring about an end to the fight and conserve his
      energy. He didn&#8217;t want to reveal his secret weapon to Chen Ran by
      using it on Huang Mian first, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had come to learn a lot about Chen Ran; he was a smart, old fox.
      If Han Sen brought out his peacock crossbow to end the fight against Huang
      Mian now, he&#8217;d be running off before the corpse of his most ardent
      follower hit the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skills of the Chen family were no joke, and they were amongst the best
      the Alliance had. Han Sen did not believe he had what it took to keep the
      old fox where he was.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the old fox had dared to come after him, and so, Han Sen would not let
      him escape so easily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen realized Huang Mian had made his decision and was not willing to
      budge, regardless of the consequences. He had no choice but to continue
      fighting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was aware of the old man&#8217;s true intentions, however. He knew
      Chen Ran wanted Huang Mian to drain him of all his energy by keeping his
      gene lock open. And so, when Chen Ran made his move, he&#8217;d lack the
      energy required to fight back.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen wasn&#8217;t concerned about this plan Chen Ran had concocted,
      because he had learned the Third Mantra &#8220;Long Live&#8221; and
      Jade-Sun Force. He could have his gene lock active for far longer than
      usual. Even if he was too tired to open his gene lock against Chen Ran,
      Han Sen would only have to summon his peacock crossbow, take aim, and pull
      the trigger to blast him to smithereens.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he could not use words to send Huang Mian away, he would continue his
      current engagement and take the time to learn what he could from him, from
      his posture with the sword to the details of his sword skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s sword skills were powerful, but he was not particularly
      great when it came to the acute wielding of the weaponry. Now that he had
      seen what a true master could do with a sword, he believed he had learnt a
      lot more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just by watching Huang Mian use a sword, he preferred to think of this
      entire ordeal as an educational experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t allow his mind to be led astray by anything else. He
      remained focused on the observation of his opponent&#8217;s movements and
      thought about what he could learn and adopt. Through this fight, he hoped
      he would be able to employ a thing or two of what he had seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen continued to fight against Huang Mian, Chen Ran was firm in the
      belief that Han Sen did not have any more skills to use or tricks up his
      sleeve.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he had, how could he not have beaten Huang Mian by now? If he continued
      going like this, even if he did manage to defeat Huang Mian, he would be
      too worn out to resist capture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chen Ran was not in a rush, so he continued to watch. He wanted to ensure
      Han Sen&#8217;s capture and was willing to wait as long as it took.
    </p>

    <p>
      One hour later, Huang Mian&#8217;s power was beginning to wind down. With
      constant fighting, the time one could keep their gene lock open was
      considerably shorter. This was happening to Huang Mian, and he was
      struggling to maintain his composure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not going to let this opportunity pass him by, so he exerted
      more and more power into his attacks in order to strike Huang Mian down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chen Ran noticed how Huang Mian was struggling to keep up, and he had seen
      enough. He knew all about the power of Han Sen&#8217;s fighting abilities,
      so he did not hesitate to summon clouds to swirl around his body and bring
      out his Anser sword. Then, he leapt into the fray to fight alongside Huang
      Mian.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skills of the Chen family were powerful. Compared to Chen Ran, Zhu
      Ting was just a rookie. Chen Ran was like some strange bird, swerving from
      left to right in an unpredictable manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s two swords now had to block Huang Mian and Chen
      Ran&#8217;s attacks simultaneously, which made him clumsy. Chen
      Ran&#8217;s movements were too strange, and he didn&#8217;t even have to
      touch the floor. He was flying, more often than not, and the entire
      spectacle didn&#8217;t even seem human. He made many unexpected moves.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The silver snake sword clashed against the Anser sword, and it was a
      strange sensation. Chen Ran&#8217;s sword felt like a cloud, and Han Sen
      briefly thought his sword had hit a spring. After hitting it, his sword
      bounced back strongly, which forced him to take a few steps back.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, if you surrender now, I will spare your life. You are
      friends with Zhu Ting, after all.&#8221; Chen Ran attacked as he tried to
      talk Han Sen into submitting and to extinguish his will to continue
      fighting.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Chen, if you leave now, I will spare your life. You are related
      to Zhu Ting, after all.&#8221; Han Sen was not mad, instead, he smiled as
      he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are a stubborn boy.&#8221; Chen Ran&#8217;s eyes went cold and
      he applied more strength to the fury of his Anser sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was battling two opponents at once, and despite the disadvantage,
      neither of them was able to deal any damage to him. Han Sen&#8217;s body
      was unbelievably light and graceful, and it was startling to see him
      remain calm under the attacks of two elites at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You really know Heavenly Go, don&#8217;t you? Did the Queen teach
      you? How dare they break the oath that was sworn! It looks to me as if
      Huangfu Xiong Cheng doesn&#8217;t want to live,&#8221; Chen Ran shouted.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Even if the Queen did teach me Heavenly Go, what does it have to do
      with you? This skill is a legacy of the Huangfu family. They can teach
      whomever they please; there is no need for them to adhere to your petty,
      mistaken whims,&#8221; Han Sen sternly rebutted.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seemed as if Heavenly Go had something to do with the Chen family;
      otherwise, why would Chen Ran care so dearly? For this, Han San wanted to
      push it. Han Sen had always wondered why the Queen was the only who had
      been able to learn it. No matter how difficult the skill was to learn,
      there were many students in the Ares Martial Hall. It would be impossible
      for them not to select another student to learn Heavenly Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Huh, Huangfu family is teaching Heavenly Go? If it still belonged
      to the Chen family, none would be able to dodge our Seven Twist,&#8221;
      Chen Ran said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Everyone knows Heavenly Go belongs to the Huangfu family. Since
      when did it become a skill of the Chen family? Come on! Don&#8217;t
      bullshit me,&#8221; Han Sen said, in an attempt to further aggravate Chen
      Ran.
    </p>

    <p>
      An old fox like Chen Ran knew what Han Sen was trying to do, but he coldly
      said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to try to push me. After I capture you,
      I am going ask Huangfu Xiong Cheng himself. Then I can see what reason he
      has for not giving me back my Heavenly Go.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, the clouds blazed out of Chen Ran wildly. The attacks of the
      Anser sword came faster and faster. He wasn&#8217;t aiming for Han
      Sen&#8217;s weak spots, either; he was going for his limbs in an attempt
      to disable him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was able to deal with Huang Mian&#8217;s attacks, but as for the
      old fox, he really was displaying the power of someone who had lived in
      the Second Shelter for over a hundred years. His fitness was so powerful
      and the progress of his gene lock was incredible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s hands became numb every time his swords went up against
      Chen Ran&#8217;s. His chest rumbled, as if he was going to spill blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What an asshole. He is so powerful and only conspires to hurt
      others,&#8221; Han Sen swore in his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now that Han Sen thought about it, Chen Ran wasn&#8217;t too
      dissimilar to who he himself was. This realization quelled his swearing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Chen, you can leave now. Cease your attacks immediately. If you
      don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t blame me for what happens next.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Assuming you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to see what happens
      next.&#8221; Chen Ran coldly laughed. He believed Han Sen had reached the
      end of his tether, and his gene lock was on the verge of exhausting him
      fully.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; Han Sen took a step back and summoned
      his peacock crossbow. He pulled a raven feather out of his quiver and
      loaded it, as quick as he could.
