<p>Han Sen asked Miss Mirror to contact Yisha. He wouldn’t use his
own phone because, if he decided to run, all of his conversations
after this day would be thoroughly examined.</p>
<p>Han Sen explained his situation to Yisha completely, and Yisha
listened intently. She didn’t say a word until Han Sen finished
telling her the entire story. When Yisha spoke, all she said were
four words. “Go to Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>Yisha then immediately hung up.</p>
<p>With that, Han Sen was able to make up his mind. He handed the
phone back to Miss Mirror, smiled, and said, “Thank you for taking
care of me all this time, my Lady. I hope we can meet again
someday.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that won’t be possible, but if you die, I will light
a candle in your honor,” Miss Mirror said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“If my death earns a lit candle from you, I will consider myself
eternally blessed,” Han Sen said. He looked at Miss Mirror and
said, “I actually still have one more request to make. I was hoping
that my Lady would take care of my blood kirin. If you are willing
to, you can use it for yourself. I will remember the kindness you
have done me.”</p>
<p>“That blood kirin is quite an angry beast. I don’t think it will
follow the commands if another,” Miss Mirror said.</p>
<p>“Controlling it isn’t difficult. You just need to use this item
to find him, and then he will listen to you.” Han Sen brought
something out for Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>“I guess I won’t refuse the service of a half-deified.” Miss
Mirror accepted the item, looked at Han Sen, and asked, “You really
have made the decision to flee? You need to think about this
carefully. Even if Sky Palace was willing to defy the Extreme King
and take you in, your journey there would be a hellish one. You
might not even get there alive.”</p>
<p>“This is my life. I could go to the holy temple and survive, but
I would spend my life in a prison. For someone like me, that
existence would be worse than death. I would rather take a gamble
that still leaves me a small chance of freedom,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Although his words weren’t entirely honest, Han Sen was
explaining one of his primary reasons for refusing to go to the
holy temple.</p>
<p>“Then you should go. I hope you survive a few more days. If my
guess is correct, reinforcements will arrive here in forty hours.
And I will have to report your situation to my supervisor.” Miss
Mirror didn’t pretend that she would support Han Sen more than she
really would just because she was weaker than him now. That just
wasn’t her personality.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, my Lady. Please report that I’m going to Sky Palace.”
Han Sen bowed. He picked up the unconscious Wan’er and took Bao’er
with him as he departed.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen flee the xenogeneic space with Bao’er, a strange
expression crossed Falling Leaf’s face. “Miss Mirror, has he really
chosen to depart the Extreme King?”</p>
<p>“It is very surprising, but it doesn’t surprise me that a brave
man like him has made such a choice.” Despite Miss Mirror’s words,
her face looked conflicted.</p>
<p>Falling Leaf hesitated for a moment, but ultimately asked, “Can
he escape this?”</p>
<p>“No, he cannot,” Miss Mirror answered with certainty, for that
was what she believed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was smart, but no matter how smart he was, he was just a
first-tier King. Even if he was deified, the furious hordes of
Extreme King would still bring him down. It was only a matter of
time.</p>
<p>Yisha wanted Han Sen to go to Sky Palace because the Sky had the
backing of the Very High. If they were willing to protect Han Sen,
then the Extreme King wouldn’t simply be able to enter Sky Palace
and kill whomever they pleased.</p>
<p>But Sky Palace might not protect Han Sen. And even if they
agreed to take him in, the trip to get to Sky Palace would be very
dangerous for him.</p>
<p>After an hour, Miss Mirror called King Bai’s phone. “Brother, I
have confirmed that he is indeed Han Sen. He has fled the
xenogeneic space, and he is headed for Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After he left the xenogeneic space, Han Sen waved his hand and
sent a white crystal flying out in front of him. It expanded until
it became a giant white whale.</p>
<p>It was a technological marvel of the ancient crystallizers. It
was as powerful as a deified treasure, and it was Han Sen’s primary
hope of escaping his predicament. With the white whale, he would be
able to travel through space for a long time without needing to
stop on any other planets along the way.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, are we really going to escape? We should go and reason
with them. Perhaps they will forgive us.” Ning Yue was going to
cry.</p>
<p>“A man never looks back.” Han Sen drove the white whale forward.
He looked excited and wholly unafraid.</p>
<p>“A man never looks back,” Bao’er repeated in excitement, pumping
her fists.</p>
<p>“I’m not a big man; I’m a small woman! Let me out… I will beg
them for their forgiveness! They will forgive me—they will forgive
me because I am a pitiful woman!” Ning Yue sobbed as she banged on
the hatch. Then, she sat with her back to the door. She started to
cry hopelessly. Her little green sword remained silently at her
waist.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bao’er ignored him. Ning Yue had been affected by
that little green sword way too much. He had become a woman with
remarkably fragile emotions.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t dare to get too close to Ning Yue or his little
green sword. Han Sen was afraid of being affected by the little
green sword and turning into what Ning Yue had become. He would
rather die before that happened.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, my first officer, you take over the wheel.” Han Sen
stood up and allowed Bao’er to take the command chair</p>
<p>“Yes, Daddy Captain.” Bao’er gladly sat down and accepted
control of the white whale.</p>
<p>Once he didn’t have to pilot the whale, Han Sen turned his
attention to a map of the galaxy. Going to Sky Palace would be very
difficult. If they took the normal route to Sky Palace, their
chances of arriving safely were practically zero.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Tianxia System is the only way we can go. If
we do that, we can then head through the systems of chaos to get to
Sky Palace,” Han Sen muttered to himself as he stared intently at
the galactic map. The route he proposed was the most dangerous path
they could take, which also made it the safest, as far as the
threat of the Extreme King was concerned.</p>
<p>That was the only route the Extreme King didn’t have total
control over, but the systems of chaos were even dangerous for
deified elites.</p>
<p>When Han Sen first followed the Ice Blue Knights through the
systems of chaos, he was a first-hand witness to how frighteningly
scary that place could be.</p>
<p>The Tianxia System was a very dangerous system, as well. It was
a giant xenogeneic space, but it was different from ordinary
xenogeneic spaces. There were no stars, no seas, and no land. It
was just an endless, foggy space that was choked by clouds. All
sorts of tools were rendered useless there due to the magnetic
storms that existed within the vapor. Ordinary ships were unable to
travel through the Tianxia System.</p>
<p>Plus, that endless space of clouds was known to host many
terrifying xenogeneics. Many deified creatures lived all throughout
Tianxia System. For an ordinary deified, making the trip would be
very difficult.</p>
<p>But this was the reason Han Sen had chosen to journey through
the Tianxia System. The Extreme King wouldn’t expect him to go that
way.</p>
<p>Overnight, Han Sen’s name spread across the entire geno
universe.</p>
<p>Before that day, not many creatures of the universe knew who Han
Sen was. But when the Extreme King put out a universal APB for Han
Sen, races all across the universe learned or remembered his
name.</p>
<p>Of course, what they remembered more than anything was the very
high bounty on him. The reward being offered for Han Sen was enough
to tempt any deified.</p>
