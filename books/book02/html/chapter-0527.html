    <p>
      &#8220;I am afraid I have to let you down. I am the enemy of Blackgod, so
      it should be inconvenient for me to go with you?&#8221; Han Sen smiled and
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are the one who injured Blackgod and stole the snake fish
      king?&#8221; Li Xinglun suddenly remembered, looking at Han Sen in
      surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is no other than me. I don&#8217;t think we should go together.
      When you started the fight, I will join you at that time,&#8221; Han Sen
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;ll do. However, you must stay careful. At that time, all
      the advanced fighters in Blackgod Shelter would be there. If Blackgod did
      anything to harm you, it would be hard for you to escape. I am in charge
      of attacking from the West, you could go to my side,&#8221; Li Xinglun
      pondered and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who is the one in charge of attacking the main gate?&#8221; Han Sen
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Blackgod is the strongest, so he&#8217;s doing that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen asked about a few more details, he got up to leave. However,
      he had made up his mind to go to the main gate where Blackgod would be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, before conquering the shelter, Han Sen would not thwart
      Blackgod&#8217;s efforts. However, after taking the spirit shelter down,
      Han Sen would not be polite anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was the first time for the human evolvers to unite together on the
      icefield. The scale was huge. Evolvers preparing and transporting supplies
      were everywhere to be seen. Some better fighters were in charge of hunting
      the creatures nearby.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the resources were so limited on the icefield, humans were only
      able to fight against the royal shelter after developing for a hundred
      plus years and a couple of generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, everything needed to be spent on the icefield in order for humans
      to succeed. If humans lost, they would have such a heavy loss. Therefore,
      no one dared to slack.
    </p>

    <p>
      &quot;In addition, there must be some troubles regarding commanding. Once
      the shelter was conquered, no one could guarantee that humans would not
      fight against each other regarding the distribution of gains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was in no hurry to go there. It&#8217;s was no use to go too
      early. He would like to go after the fight had started.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, like Li Xinglun said, the three forces launched a united strike
      against the royal shelter after two days. Blackgod Shelter was in charge
      of attacking the main gate of the royal shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      From afar, Han Sen saw groups of creatures rushing out of the royal
      shelter, fighting against human evolvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod took a dozen evolvers who had a fitness level above a hundred,
      trying to go inside the shelter. However, they were soon stopped by
      sacred-blood creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the other two directions, humans were also stopped by creatures.
      Fighting could be heard everywhere, while the silver-haired spirit girl
      was standing on top of the wall of the shelter, looking at everything
      coldly, not planning to move a finger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen eventually witnessed a large-scale fight. Han Sen could not see
      clearly was going on with Li Xinglun and Philip. However, against the
      dozen evolvers with a fitness level above a hundred, nearly 20
      sacred-blood creatures had rushed out of the royal shelter, blocking the
      attacks from Blackgod shelter completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was obviously not everything the royal shelter had got. There were
      definitely more sacred-blood creatures inside the shelter, fighting
      against enemies from the other two directions. This royal shelter was
      incredibly strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;One man could never take down a large royal shelter like this
      one.&#8221; Han Sen felt quite impressed. Without uniting the forces on
      the icefield, an individual could never conquer shelter like this unless
      he had the strength of a super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Giant snakes as long as 300 feet, huge beasts that looks like Titans,
      black winged beasts and birds flying in the sky. The whole battlefield was
      a mess. The scene was hundred times more impressive than a movie.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was equally magnificent as an interstellar war. In addition, the bloody
      scene was something that could not be seen there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even Han Sen who was preparing to steal some gains felt his blood burning,
      wishing to fight next to the evolvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod was better at commanding than Han Sen thought. In addition, the
      majority of the evolvers had been through service, so they were no
      strangers to fighting together. When they were besieging creatures, they
      collaborated well. In fact, the casualties were not huge.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, some were weaker evolvers would be in charge of logistics.
      Once someone was hurt, he would be sent out of the battlefield
      immediately. Not a lot of people died.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This Blackgod is quite impressive. He is able to command such a
      large-scale war. Quite talented,&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself.
      However, an enemy was an enemy no matter how good he was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because for more than a hundred years, humans had been bullied by this
      royal shelter and fought the shelter multiple times, humans had a profound
      understanding of how strong the royal shelter was. After discussion, the
      three forces launched the attack with preparation. Although the royal
      spirit was strong, it started to fall. It seemed that it could not
      withstand the attacks from all three forces for a long time.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the silver-haired spirit did not plan to attack. She was watching
      the entire battlefield coldly on top of the wall, moving her staff once in
      a while, commanding the creatures to fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If this continues, the shelter will be conquered if the
      silver-haired spirit did not have other creatures to help her,&#8221; Han
      Sen thought to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it were an aristocrat shelter, Han Sen would have gone inside to steal
      the spirit stone already. However, it was a royal shelter and he did not
      know whether there were more sacred-blood creatures inside. Even if Han
      Sen went inside, he might not necessarily be able to find the spirit
      stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was thinking, he saw the silver-haired spirit living the war.
      However, he did not join the battlefield, but went back to the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised by her move. Currently, the fight had gone into a
      very fierce stage. The army of the creatures were at a disadvantage. If
      they lost her command, wouldn&#8217;t they lose even sooner?
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen was feeling puzzled, he suddenly saw the earth started to
      shake on the battlefield in front of the shelter. Many stones were broken,
      and silver beetles started to come out like waves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where the silver beetles passed, the bodies of both humans and creatures
      were eaten up completely, making one&#8217;s scalp prickle.
    </p>

    <p>
      More and more gaps started to appear on the land, and numerous silver
      beetles came out. All of a sudden, the entire battlefield was a mess. Both
      humans and creatures were rushing to run for their lives. No one had any
      intention to continue the fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans and creatures that were fighting against each other a minute ago
      started to escape together. It was hard to imagine that they were fighting
      for life-and-death just now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the huge snake and the giant beast were running as fast as they
      could. It seemed that they were very scared of the silver beetles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was also rather scared. However, after careful observation, he
      found that the individual of the silver beetles was not that strong. They
      were slightly stronger than primitive creatures, but weaker than mutant
      creatures. However, there were so many of them and their mouth were really
      sharp. Even sacred-blood creatures had their weaknesses, so it was painful
      for them to have a silver beetle inside their body.
    </p>

    <p>However, Han Sen felt his opportunity had come.</p>
