    <p>
      &#8220;Argh!&#8221; Amidst the silver lightning, the electricity coursed
      through and electrified the spirit&#8217;s body. She looked up and
      screamed out to the heavens in pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver lightning leapt and crackled all around her continuously, and
      with every jolt of electricity, cracks appeared in her armor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most frighteningly, her body convulsed and twisted into crooked shapes
      unwillingly under the effect of the lightning attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white lightning came out from near Han Sen&#8217;s waist, and its
      origin point was shaped like the head of a fox. As the lightning continued
      to stream out to electrify Han Sen&#8217;s foe, the rest of the
      fox&#8217;s body started to form. Its body was followed by the legs and
      paws. Its tail came last.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white-lightning fox ended up being two meters tall, and from this
      newly formed creation, lightning sparkled across its fur. It was an
      immaculate creature; one that was truly beautiful. But at the same time,
      it exuded an intimidating presence, and it possessed a power that could
      almost be felt. It was difficult to look upon it straight.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The silver lightning fox became a shadow, and it quickly appeared in front
      of the spirit like real lightning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if the spirit hadn&#8217;t been paralyzed, Han Sen doubted her
      ability to stop such a sudden movement from the fox.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      The spirit tried to raise her fist and repel the incoming lightning. She
      impeded the brutal talon-laden paws of the fox, but not the electricity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beneath the continuing, greater discharges, her armor suffered more and
      more cracks and tears. The cracks formed quickly like breaking glass,
      coursing all across the armor as the lightning itself did.
    </p>

    <p>
      The thunder fox turned itself into a lightning bolt, and it repeatedly
      drove itself into the spirit. Although the spirit could just about dodge
      many of the attacks, she could not remove herself from the widespread
      lightning that surrounded each strike.
    </p>

    <p>Crack!</p>

    <p>
      The spirit&#8217;s armor could no longer withstand the constant current of
      electricity. It shattered into tiny pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without the protection of the armor, her naked body could only tremble and
      shake under her constant electrocution. Loudly, she screamed in agony.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox did not show restraint. While the spirit was still
      paralyzed in the electricity, it turned into another lightning bolt and
      attacked the spirit. Three scratch marks appeared across her chest, which
      drew a cascade of blood. Silver lightning breached her exposed wounds, and
      they filled up with the thunderous power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised that the silver fox had evolved into a thunder fox
      that could keep attacking in the air. The spirit&#8217;s body did not
      cease gushing blood, and in one final attack, her body was torn apart by
      the thunder fox. She was utterly torn apart by the evolved pet, which
      returned her to the spirit stone inside the spirit hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under his breath, Han Sen could only mutter the words, &#8220;Little
      Silver.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The adult silver fox was far stronger than he imagined it would be. It
      could beat a super spirit, and although the attacks first came sneakily,
      its power was still a gobsmacking spectacle.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the lightning disappeared, the silver fox still looked small and
      gentle. It didn&#8217;t look any bigger, and even appeared to have shrunk
      a little. It was only one foot long, but it had a coat of magnificent fur.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox looked as elegant as it ever did, and it leapt onto Han
      Sen&#8217;s shoulder with no change of personality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was extremely glad, and he took off running up to the spirit hall.
      It took a while for spirits to respawn, so now was the perfect time for
      him to nab the spirit stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen&#8217;s body was still weak, he didn&#8217;t care too
      much. After descending from the sky, he ran to the hall as fast as his
      tired legs could carry him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the spirit hall, it looked like a holy temple. A giant statue stood
      proud and tall in the center of the hall, and Han Sen wondered what sort
      of power might have resided within.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the statue&#8217;s forehead, there was a spirit stone that looked very
      much like a black hole. It burnt with a bright flame, reminiscent of the
      day the universe was born. The spirit was regathering itself inside,
      preparing itself for a respawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Acknowledging this, Han Sen did not slow down. He jumped into the sky and
      landed on the statue&#8217;s nose. He reached up, grabbed the spirit
      stone, and held it in his hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the spirit was still respawning, it did not immediately appear
      from the stone. But then, all of a sudden, a black flame appeared. In
      front of Han Sen, a black hole manifested.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, it was quite large, but it gradually shrank in size until at
      last, the spirit reappeared. With a complicated expression, she showed no
      animosity and just knelt before Han Sen. She put her right hand on the
      left side of her chest, lowered her head and said, &#8220;I, Moment Queen,
      am willing to submit and offer absolute loyalty to a new master. I will
      become a faithful servant from now until eternity.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As she spoke, she turned into a black light and entered Han Sen&#8217;s
      Sea of Soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      He heard the creatures elsewhere in the shelter all roar in a panic or
      frenzy. When he went out to take a look, all the creatures in the shelter
      were gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy flew in front of Han Sen and kept performing gestures, twirling
      her body as if to tell him how brave, fearless, and helpful she had been.
      She was trying to say she had done a lot for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thanks a lot; how about I reward you with something good for your
      services?&#8221; Han Sen brought out a Geno Creation Pill and gave it to
      the fairy. She very much enjoyed eating those, just like the silver fox
      did.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant monster ran up to the palace, and when Han Sen went to check up
      on it, he found the big monster licking its dying young. Despite being
      covered in blood, nothing could veil the big monster&#8217;s sadness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little monster was on the ground, twitching and crying. It was dying.
      It had been grievously injured and dragged here without a remedy, and by
      now, it had almost entirely bled out.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little monster had a high vitality, which had allowed it to remain
      alive up until now, clutching its final fleeting moments of life. If this
      was any other super creature, it&#8217;d have died a long time ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big monster cried aloud to the sky, and after a brief pause, rushed to
      Han Sen. Han Sen was shocked, thinking the monster wished to exact revenge
      on him for being partially responsible. He spawned his little angel in
      preparation for another fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the big monster came before Han Sen, it knelt in front of him as if
      to beg.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was quite the surprising scene to witness, watching a mountain-large
      beast kneel in front of him. It was difficult to describe the feelings one
      would get from the sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you want me to save it?&#8221; Han Sen understood what the big
      monster desired from him. So, he obliged and used the holy light to heal
      its baby. The big monster knew of the light&#8217;s effectiveness from
      when Han Sen had used the ability on it, so the creature thought he might
      be able to use it on his young, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I save it, will you adhere to my commands?&#8221; Han Sen asked,
      after a while of thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that he had the power to kill two super creatures, doing so would have
      increased his super geno points by a large amount.
    </p>

    <p>
      But instead, he cooperated with the monster, for he felt sympathy for
      them. What was most important for him right now was claiming an
      Empire-class shelter; a shelter that needed protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would only be a matter of time before Han Sen maxed out his super geno
      points, and getting two massive creatures such as these to guard
      one&#8217;s home was not very common.
    </p>

    <p>
      After thinking things over, Han Sen decided to help the little monster and
      the big monster out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Roar!&#8221; The big monster roared and knelt before Han Sen again,
      signaling its willingness to adhere to Han Sen&#8217;s commands.
