“How is he moving so fast?” Kahn exclaimed, but it was too late. Han Sen had already caught up to him via the red cloud.

Kahn put away the Blood Demon Spear, and his eyes started to turn purple. The purple horn on his head burned like red steel, releasing a purple light.

Katcha! Katcha!

Kahn’s muscles began to swell, growing rapidly until they burst through his armor. In an instant, the ordinary humanoid body had grown into a terrifying giant.

Kahn’s sinews writhed under his skin like snakes, and his skin turned a weird purple. His hair flowed crazily down his back, almost reaching his feet. Finally, a disturbing demonic presence began to radiate from Kahn, like some brutish god hailing from ancient times.

Boom!

Kahn punched Han Sen. Sky Demon powers started to rain down, each possessing the might of a mountain.

The demonized giant Kahn was so powerful. He was far greater than a Marquise now; in this form, he could probably kill most Dukes. With the accuracy of Sky Demon powers, he would be invincible against other Marquises.

In this Giant Demon form, his strikes couldn’t be blocked or evaded. He really did seem like an indestructible foe. In terms of might, Kahn’s giant devil powers were on par with the red cloud’s speed.

But power like that was nothing against Han Sen. He used his Dongxuan Aura, and in his mind, sequence structures appeared. One sequence structure looked ready to bind Han Sen.

Han Sen pulled at that threat, though, and broke it. The speed of the red cloud let him dodge Kahn’s incoming attack as he did.

And then, Kahn’s pupils grew smaller. He hadn’t thought that anything could evade the accurate attack of Sky Demon powers. And furthermore, he didn’t have time to reel his giant fist back to go defensive.

The red cloud was like lightning, and it raced towards Kahn’s neck. Han Sen swung Ghost Teeth Knife across it.

Katcha!

The muscles were cut through by the purple and black knife air, and blood began to fountain from the giant’s neck. But the giant was too big, and doing more damage would be difficult. Han Sen’s attack had only left a comparatively small wound, given the sheer size of the giant. It was far from a fatal strike.

Kahn roared. He kept swinging his fists in the vain hope of landing a hit on Han Sen.

He was as strong as a Marquise could be, but even the precise attacks of Sky Demon powers couldn’t land a hit on Han Sen. The red cloud flew around Kahn like lightning.

Knife airs also started to shine, and every time the purple and black knife air flashed, it left a wound on Kahn’s body that drained him of even more blood.

The demonized giant continued to roar, but his powers could not land on Han Sen. He was like a big dumb baby as he flailed at the flying red cloud.

“Why… Why does my Sky Demon power not work? How is this possible?” Unwilling to give up, Kahn kept attacking like mad. His giant body kept on releasing scary power, breaking the fabric of space.

Everything he tried seemed useless, though. Han Sen continued to release knife airs from his seat atop the red cloud. After a few more hits, the red cloud flew away from Kahn and hovered directly before him.

“Kahn, when you learned that Lone Bamboo and I had arrived on Planet Night Ghost, you had already planned on getting the Night Ghosts to dispose of us. Isn’t that correct?” Han Sen looked right at Kahn as he spoke lightly to him.

Kahn turned around without saying a word, wishing to flee into the reaches of space.

Han Sen just grunted and swung his Ghost Teeth Knife once again. Purple and black knife airs that were thinner than a strand of hair began to appear around Kahn’s body. In no time at all, they encircled Kahn and tightened, binding him.

Kahn was infuriated and roared in anger. He released his demonic air in a bid to cut the knife silks.

However, he had underestimated the effectiveness of the knife silks Han Sen had cast, and even his tremendous power wasn’t enough to break them all. His squirming only made the silk dig into his flesh even more.

Han Sen kept waving his Ghost Teeth Knife, tightening the knife silks even further. They cut into Kahn’s demonized giant body and dismembered him in less than a second’s time.

The chunks of gore and demonic blood swirled in a disgusting cloud. The Blood Demon Spear and Metal Peacock were released amidst the carnage.

Suddenly making up his mind, Han Sen grabbed the Blood Demon Spear and Metal Peacock. There was also a purple light next to the giant’s corpse, which swiftly disappeared into space.

“What was that?” Han Sen frowned. That purple light had been too fast, and Han Sen hadn’t been able to see what it was.

But he knew that Kahn had not truly been killed. It was obvious that Kahn was a xenogeneic, and Han Sen hadn’t received the announcement for taking him down.

Han Sen rummaged through the remains of the giant demon body, and he couldn’t find a xenogeneic gene, either. That purple thing that escaped just now must have been Kahn’s xenogeneic gene.

He did not know how Kahn escaped into space, but regardless, he was gone now. Han Sen wouldn’t be able to find the Demon. He took the Blood Demon Spear and Metal Peacock, and then returned to Planet Night Ghost.

Lone Bamboo had locked Sleepless Duke up. The rebellion of the Night Ghosts was over, and it seemed as if things were calming down.

When the teams from Sky Palace arrived, they took Sleepless Duke and the Night Ghosts back with them to Sky Palace. Han Sen and Lone Bamboo had halted their betrayal, earning themselves another reward from the elder.

Aside from geno fluids and treasures, though, they received another opportunity to go to the Holy House to select a new geno art.

However, Han Sen did not have time to practice other genetic techniques. He actually only had a small amount of time left to learn Suppress Evil, so there was no reason for him to go to the Holy House yet.

Han Sen still wanted to ask Xi Menxiaong a few questions, but when he returned to Planet Night Ghost, Xi Menxiaong was nowhere to be found. However, the man left a communication number on the big stone he had been sitting on.

Back in Sky Palace, the leader of Sky Palace wanted to see Han Sen. He stared at Han Sen for a while, and eventually said, “You are not a real student of Sky Palace, and yet, you have done so much for us. If you need anything, I will grant any reasonable request.”

“Leader, what do you mean by a ‘reasonable request’?” Han Sen did not think the leader was being sincere. The leader could turn down any request he wanted to, simply by claiming it was “unreasonable.” It sounded nice on paper, but it was actually quite stingy.

“It means I will try to satisfy what I feel is reasonable,” said the Sky Palace leader, squinting his eyes.

Han Sen shrugged, thinking that the man was rather manipulative. He wasn’t mad, but he wasn’t sure how much this offer was really worth.

“He won’t give out too much, but I don’t want too little, either. What should I ask for, then?” Han Sen wondered.
