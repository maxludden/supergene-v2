  Many god plants were in Space Garden. One could not imagine it. Han Sen did not know if this was the result of Space Garden itself or if it had to do something with the entire geno universe exhibiting such changes.

Han Sen remembered God Hall Leader told him that because his fight against World King God was too destructive, the universe of kingdoms and geno universe were affected. The universe of kingdoms had an abundance of pulses and gene eggs appear. The geno universe had changed too, but God Hall Leader did not elaborate. If this was it, Han Sen never expected the changes to be so grand.

“Who are you? Why have you come to Space Garden?” A young man raised his sword at Han Sen.

Han Sen looked at the young man. He looked familiar, but he could not recall where he had last seen him.

“Space Garden is a place I come and go to as I please. Who are you, and who are you stop me?” Han Sen looked at the young man with interest as he spoke

The young man was not human. He was like a young man who belonged to the Sky. The Sky should have been in Sky Palace though. Han Sen had no clue what he was doing in a place like Space Garden. “I am a student of Space Garden’s Yu Wu Shuang,” the young man coldly said. “I am patrolling Space Garden. You better not try and fight back. Follow me back and explain how you have come to be here.” “Sure,” Han Sen said with a nod.

Yu Wu Shuang had not expected Han Sen to comply nicely. He was shocked, but he quickly reacted. He used a sword to point at Han Sen and said, “Come on. Let’s go.”

Han Sen was led by Yu Wu Shuang to Space Garden’s base. As he walked, he made sure to ask questions. “You are one of the Sky. Why don’t you stay in Sky Palace to practice? What are you doing in Space Garden?”

Yu Wu Shuang raised his head and looked proud. “Space Garden is the geno universe’s first sacred place. Mister Dollar used to practice here. Many people in the universe wish to study in this place. They want to feel Mister Dollar’s glory, but they cannot. Sky Palace is good friends with Space Garden, so only a few people can come here to study. I beat out many other competitors to come and study here.”

“I see.” Han Sen noticed that Space Garden was no longer like it used to be.

Han Sen thought it was right. Even though he had not been there, Littleflower was still around. He then thought about Xie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and the others. In his absence, the people from the sanctuaries had undoubtedly developed quite a bit. It would have been pretty silly if Space Garden had not become famous.

“Aside from Sky Palace, are there students from any other races coming to this place?” Han Sen asked. This was not a secret. It was something everyone in the universe would have known. Thus, Yu Wu Shuang was able to easily answer. “Of course. Everyone knows Dollar’s name in the universe. Although Mister Dollar is gone, Mister Fei and the other elites are still around. We’re not talking about ordinary races here. Even if the super-rich races want to send their kids to Space Garden for practice, they must adhere to the extremely hard conditions set in place by Space Garden. No race is able to come in whenever they wish to. Aside from the Sky, Rebate and a few other races can come. For all other races, coming to study here is an exceptional privilege and task.” Han Sen was surprised. He soon realized who the Mister Fei he was talking about was. It was obviously his son, Han Fei. He had been calling him Littleflower for so long that he had forgotten his original name.

When he heard Littleflower’s name, he still didn’t react.

Yu Wu Shuang looked cocky as he said, “I am Mister Fei’s student. I follow Mister Fei’s guidance for practice.” “Where is Han Fei now?” Han Sen asked with a smile. Littleflower was not that old. He would not have been much bigger than Yu Wu Shuang, yet he was already taking students. It made Han Sen think Wu Yu Shuang was, in some way, his grand-student.

“Why are you asking so many questions? Just follow me.” Yu Wu Shuang looked alert as he spoke to Han Sen.

It looked like Yu Wu Shuang was very territorial. When it came to aspects of Space Garden, he stopped talking.

In Space Garden’s base, Han Sen noticed it was now many times bigger. It looked like a massive city. The opulence on display was not unlike the capital of the Extreme King.

He saw all kinds of creatures traveling around the place. Han Sen looked around and saw many familiar faces. Many humans and creatures from the sanctuaries were there. There were even many spirits.

“It looks like Littleflower brought over many humans, creatures, and spirits to this place from the sanctuaries,” Han Sen thought.

The only other person who was able to go in and out of the sanctuaries was his son, Littleflower.

At the door of the base, two people were standing guard. One of them was obviously from the Extreme King, and the other was obviously from the Very High. They were similar to Wu Yu Shuang. They were young men, so he thought they were also students who had been sent there to practice. The Extreme King young man pointed at Han Sen as he asked, “Yu Wu Shuang, who is he?”

“While I was patrolling, I noticed this invader slip inside,” Yu Wu Shuang said. “I am going to take him to see Mister Tang.” The Extreme King young man coldly said, “Outsiders cannot be taken to the city. Make him stay here. In the meantime, I will contact Mister Tang.”

Han Sen quietly watched the Extreme King young man bring out a communicator to contact the person he wished to contact. He then heard a familiar voice.

“What? Did you say an outsider tried to invade Space Garden? Watch him! I am coming over at once. I want to see who was powerful enough to breach our Space Garden.” The voice was abruptly cut short.

Han Sen heard a ping in Tang Zhenliu’s voice.

Han Sen looked at the Extreme King young man and said, “Looking at your face, you look rather familiar. Are you related to Bai Wanjie?”

“How dare you say my father’s name aloud,” the Extreme King young man said. He was furious.

“Bai Wanjie is your father, and you call him a king,” Han Sen said with shock. “So, he was the one who took the throne for the Extreme King.” “My father took the throne,” the Extreme King young man coldly said. “Everyone knows that. Are you trying to troll me or something stupid like that?”

Han Sen shook his head. He had been away from the geno universe for two years. It seemed as if many things had happened in his absence. Since this Extreme King prince went to Space Garden to be a guard, it seemed as if the reputation of Space Garden in the universe had become very high. “What is happening here?” A female’s voice sounded out from the city as a woman wearing green clothes walked out.

The woman started to question Yu Wu Shuang, but her eyes opened wide when her vision landed on the presence of Han Sen. Her eyes turned red. She was unable to believe who it was. It looked as if tears were going to fall any second. “You…” The woman was only able to speak one word before stopping. “Exquisite, long time no see.” Han Sen smiled and waved at her. He was surprised too. The Very High Exquisite was in Space Garden.

“You… You are back…” Exquisite’s eyes had tears start to fall. She had this overwhelming feeling of wanting to leap into Han Sen’s arms. When she moved forward, she stopped. Her voice was a bit shaky.
