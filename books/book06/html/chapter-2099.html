<p>“How is he moving so fast?” Kahn exclaimed, but it was too late.
Han Sen had already caught up to him via the red cloud.</p>
<p>Kahn put away the Blood Demon Spear, and his eyes started to
turn purple. The purple horn on his head burned like red steel,
releasing a purple light.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>Kahn’s muscles began to swell, growing rapidly until they burst
through his armor. In an instant, the ordinary humanoid body had
grown into a terrifying giant.</p>
<p>Kahn’s sinews writhed under his skin like snakes, and his skin
turned a weird purple. His hair flowed crazily down his back,
almost reaching his feet. Finally, a disturbing demonic presence
began to radiate from Kahn, like some brutish god hailing from
ancient times.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Kahn punched Han Sen. Sky Demon powers started to rain down,
each possessing the might of a mountain.</p>
<p>The demonized giant Kahn was so powerful. He was far greater
than a Marquise now; in this form, he could probably kill most
Dukes. With the accuracy of Sky Demon powers, he would be
invincible against other Marquises.</p>
<p>In this Giant Demon form, his strikes couldn’t be blocked or
evaded. He really did seem like an indestructible foe. In terms of
might, Kahn’s giant devil powers were on par with the red cloud’s
speed.</p>
<p>But power like that was nothing against Han Sen. He used his
Dongxuan Aura, and in his mind, sequence structures appeared. One
sequence structure looked ready to bind Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled at that threat, though, and broke it. The speed
of the red cloud let him dodge Kahn’s incoming attack as he
did.</p>
<p>And then, Kahn’s pupils grew smaller. He hadn’t thought that
anything could evade the accurate attack of Sky Demon powers. And
furthermore, he didn’t have time to reel his giant fist back to go
defensive.</p>
<p>The red cloud was like lightning, and it raced towards Kahn’s
neck. Han Sen swung Ghost Teeth Knife across it.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The muscles were cut through by the purple and black knife air,
and blood began to fountain from the giant’s neck. But the giant
was too big, and doing more damage would be difficult. Han Sen’s
attack had only left a comparatively small wound, given the sheer
size of the giant. It was far from a fatal strike.</p>
<p>Kahn roared. He kept swinging his fists in the vain hope of
landing a hit on Han Sen.</p>
<p>He was as strong as a Marquise could be, but even the precise
attacks of Sky Demon powers couldn’t land a hit on Han Sen. The red
cloud flew around Kahn like lightning.</p>
<p>Knife airs also started to shine, and every time the purple and
black knife air flashed, it left a wound on Kahn’s body that
drained him of even more blood.</p>
<p>The demonized giant continued to roar, but his powers could not
land on Han Sen. He was like a big dumb baby as he flailed at the
flying red cloud.</p>
<p>“Why… Why does my Sky Demon power not work? How is this
possible?” Unwilling to give up, Kahn kept attacking like mad. His
giant body kept on releasing scary power, breaking the fabric of
space.</p>
<p>Everything he tried seemed useless, though. Han Sen continued to
release knife airs from his seat atop the red cloud. After a few
more hits, the red cloud flew away from Kahn and hovered directly
before him.</p>
<p>“Kahn, when you learned that Lone Bamboo and I had arrived on
Planet Night Ghost, you had already planned on getting the Night
Ghosts to dispose of us. Isn’t that correct?” Han Sen looked right
at Kahn as he spoke lightly to him.</p>
<p>Kahn turned around without saying a word, wishing to flee into
the reaches of space.</p>
<p>Han Sen just grunted and swung his Ghost Teeth Knife once again.
Purple and black knife airs that were thinner than a strand of hair
began to appear around Kahn’s body. In no time at all, they
encircled Kahn and tightened, binding him.</p>
<p>Kahn was infuriated and roared in anger. He released his demonic
air in a bid to cut the knife silks.</p>
<p>However, he had underestimated the effectiveness of the knife
silks Han Sen had cast, and even his tremendous power wasn’t enough
to break them all. His squirming only made the silk dig into his
flesh even more.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept waving his Ghost Teeth Knife, tightening the knife
silks even further. They cut into Kahn’s demonized giant body and
dismembered him in less than a second’s time.</p>
<p>The chunks of gore and demonic blood swirled in a disgusting
cloud. The Blood Demon Spear and Metal Peacock were released amidst
the carnage.</p>
<p>Suddenly making up his mind, Han Sen grabbed the Blood Demon
Spear and Metal Peacock. There was also a purple light next to the
giant’s corpse, which swiftly disappeared into space.</p>
<p>“What was that?” Han Sen frowned. That purple light had been too
fast, and Han Sen hadn’t been able to see what it was.</p>
<p>But he knew that Kahn had not truly been killed. It was obvious
that Kahn was a xenogeneic, and Han Sen hadn’t received the
announcement for taking him down.</p>
<p>Han Sen rummaged through the remains of the giant demon body,
and he couldn’t find a xenogeneic gene, either. That purple thing
that escaped just now must have been Kahn’s xenogeneic gene.</p>
<p>He did not know how Kahn escaped into space, but regardless, he
was gone now. Han Sen wouldn’t be able to find the Demon. He took
the Blood Demon Spear and Metal Peacock, and then returned to
Planet Night Ghost.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo had locked Sleepless Duke up. The rebellion of the
Night Ghosts was over, and it seemed as if things were calming
down.</p>
<p>When the teams from Sky Palace arrived, they took Sleepless Duke
and the Night Ghosts back with them to Sky Palace. Han Sen and Lone
Bamboo had halted their betrayal, earning themselves another reward
from the elder.</p>
<p>Aside from geno fluids and treasures, though, they received
another opportunity to go to the Holy House to select a new geno
art.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen did not have time to practice other genetic
techniques. He actually only had a small amount of time left to
learn Suppress Evil, so there was no reason for him to go to the
Holy House yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen still wanted to ask Xi Menxiaong a few questions, but
when he returned to Planet Night Ghost, Xi Menxiaong was nowhere to
be found. However, the man left a communication number on the big
stone he had been sitting on.</p>
<p>Back in Sky Palace, the leader of Sky Palace wanted to see Han
Sen. He stared at Han Sen for a while, and eventually said, “You
are not a real student of Sky Palace, and yet, you have done so
much for us. If you need anything, I will grant any reasonable
request.”</p>
<p>“Leader, what do you mean by a ‘reasonable request’?” Han Sen
did not think the leader was being sincere. The leader could turn
down any request he wanted to, simply by claiming it was
“unreasonable.” It sounded nice on paper, but it was actually quite
stingy.</p>
<p>“It means I will try to satisfy what I feel is reasonable,” said
the Sky Palace leader, squinting his eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged, thinking that the man was rather manipulative.
He wasn’t mad, but he wasn’t sure how much this offer was really
worth.</p>
<p>“He won’t give out too much, but I don’t want too little,
either. What should I ask for, then?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
