    <p>
      Ever since Han Sen began learning the Dongxue Sutra, his perception had
      heightened. When he entered &#8220;Ultimate Breath&#8221; mode, the cells
      in his body were able to breathe freely, independently from the nose and
      lungs. This made Han Sen special.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, his breathing rhythm had affected his performance and his
      ability to channel power. But now, with Han Sen able to forget his
      concerns about breathing and not become winded, he was much freer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this curious talent he had learned through the Dongxue Sutra, his
      ability to survey and assess a field of battle had been greatly improved,
      and he could perceive every little happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not a single movement and not a single drawing of breath could now escape
      Han Sen&#8217;s attention. Without needing to attend to his own bodily
      rhythms, he could work his way around everyone else&#8217;s.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if he was surrounded, he could weave in and out between potential
      oppressors. Every step he took was in-between someone&#8217;s blind spot -
      he could swerve into places they could not reach, take advantage of a sole
      misplaced footstep, and manipulate enemies to exhaust their powers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was an incredible rush for Han Sen to be able to do these things. It
      was as if he had entered God Mode. With his great ability to perceive
      unfolding events, it was as if he was watching battles from high above.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he was once a chess piece, he had now become the player himself.
      Everything had fallen under his control.
    </p>

    <p>
      The six evolvers were now extremely frustrated. They had been trying to
      stop Han Sen&#8217;s advance, but wherever he stepped was the exact spot
      that was the most unfavorable for them. When one evolver believed his
      colleague should be stepping in to stop Han Sen, the other would be
      thinking the same. When no move was made by either, Han Sen was already
      leaving them in the dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was incredible to see, as if the six evolvers were secretly aiding Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was the advantage and benefit the Dongxue Sutra gave its
      learners. Everything was as clear as glass, and each situation could be
      read like a book. The sutra offered the powers of gods and demons and
      whoever became a surpasser would receive them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen still hadn&#8217;t reached the level of surpasser, but that
      didn&#8217;t matter at this instant. His opponents were weaker than he
      was, which meant he could read their mind with ease. As a result, he was
      unstoppable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that six elites were unable to stop Han Sen&#8217;s advance, a
      chill ran down Blackgod&#8217;s spine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod&#8217;s sworn foe was entirely different from the last time he
      fought him, and as he drew nearer, Blackgod began to feel a wicked fear
      take hold.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill him!&#8221; Blackgod shouted. As he did, Blackgod fell back.
      He had no idea why, but as he looked into the eyes of his fierce, lone
      attacker, a chill fell upon him. He started falling back even further. He
      did not dare to engage Han Sen in direct, one-to-one combat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 237 evolvers were heavily armed, and they worked together to surround
      Han Sen. They presented a wall of spears, facing Han Sen like the craggy
      peaks of a mountain range. The points of the spears joined together like a
      trapping net, and moved up and down like the roll of an ocean&#8217;s
      waves. It looked as if they could shatter stone if they so chose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people back in the Goddess Shelter were shocked. It appeared that the
      Blackgod army possessed talent and a unified strategy; they weren&#8217;t
      a group composed of throwaway mercenaries and sell-swords. To take a
      formation such as this was not something any ordinary regiment could do.
      It was obvious they had received much rigorous training; otherwise, such
      seamless co-operation could not be possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli was waiting alongside her team, watching the field with
      shredded nerves. With the killing abilities they appeared to possess,
      victory over them was something not even a collection of hardened elites
      could pull off. Her anxiety over the well-being of Han Sen became even
      greater.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was going up against a high-powered meat grinder; surely any
      attack would be hopeless - unless he had the power to turn the tables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The evolvers in the Blackgod army had impressive fitness levels, and with
      them co-operating like this, it would take a person whose level was many
      times higher to turn the tide against them. The enemy was like a
      well-oiled machine, cogs turning flawlessly without a single hitch; if Han
      Sen&#8217;s speed and power weren&#8217;t as great as it had to be, the
      machine could not be stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if he was able to take a few of them out, there was a high
      probability of him being killed by others in the formation.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Han Sen was not wearing any armor. His entire body was exposed and
      weak, so to believe he could survive a battlefield in such conditions was
      an extremely dangerous endeavor.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was only wearing a traditional combat outfit that was standard-issue
      for the Alliance. But now suddenly Han Sen changed, as a red armor
      suddenly appeared to clothe his entire body. His short hair grew into a
      stream of long, blonde locks. His eyes sparkled with the color of gold and
      a ruby crown was lifted upon his head to decorate his new appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      After his sudden transformation into a Fairy Queen, the whole world seemed
      to slow down in Han Sen&#8217;s vision. The spears that had been coming
      towards him like arrows had slowed to a crawl.
    </p>

    <p>
      He danced like a butterfly, or more menacingly like a wild bat in the
      dark. His body moved incredibly quickly, managing to weave its way between
      the swordsmen and their spears. He formed a gap between the ranks of the
      assaulting formation, and after breaching through, ran towards Blackgod.
    </p>

    <p>Every evolver Han Sen passed by possessed a confusion in their heart.</p>

    <p>
      The position Han Sen chose to breach was strange to them. It looked as if
      he were going to go in another direction, but when they turned to look, he
      was back where he had started. Whenever they wanted to strike, Han Sen was
      already gone.
    </p>

    <p>With these godlike powers possessing his body, he was unstoppable.</p>

    <p>The evolvers on the battlefield felt hopeless and frustrated.</p>

    <p>
      Blackgod&#8217;s face looked like mud. He could not believe that his
      formation, composed of over 200 evolvers, was unable to prevent Han
      Sen&#8217;s advance. And he was frightened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s power had reached such a degree that calling him
      &#8220;strong&#8221; was no longer fitting. He was almost inhuman.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill him!&#8221; Blackgod screamed as he continued to retreat. His
      heart felt as if it had been stabbed with ice. Han Sen&#8217;s performance
      had been too frightening to watch, and still, Blackgod lacked the courage
      to battle his most despised enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The six evolvers from the front rushed back and caught up with Han Sen who
      was now just beyond the formation and going for Blackgod.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their spears were like wretched dragons and their swords were like soaring
      eagles.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were two elites now blocking Han Sen&#8217;s way - the two from the
      army. They knew they had to capture their foe.
    </p>

    <p>
      But no matter how strong Han Sen was, he was alone. Under the strenuous
      pressure of the formation, it was only a matter of time before he grew
      tired.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if Han Sen was able to rush forward and slay Blackgod, then the army
      would be crushed. It would be hopeless without a leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen leaped into the sky and danced across the swords and spears of his
      enemies, before jumping towards Blackgod.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill him!&#8221; Blackgod&#8217;s face was as white as a marble,
      and terror coated his words.
    </p>

    <p>
      The four evolvers were glad, for their beast soul weapons were now
      targeted on Han Sen from four different directions. Now that Han Sen was
      in the air, the only way he could avoid capture was if he suddenly
      sprouted wings and began flying.
    </p>

    <p>But Han Sen did not sprout wings, and so they approached him.</p>

    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen starting to descend, the swords and spears readied to join
      him. Alongside the four evolvers, many more were prepared to skewer Han
      Sen on his landing. He would truly be helpless if he fell into their trap.
