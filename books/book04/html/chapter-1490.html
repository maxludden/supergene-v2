      All the pursuing spirits were from Elysium, and while they were all around
      the same power level, their geno cores were very different. Two of the
      king spirits were using swords. One used a feather, one wielded a knife,
      and another used a copper cauldron. Han Sen couldn’t see what the sixth
      spirit was using. He simply waved his hand beneath a cloak, which dropped
      a thick mist across a dozen miles of landscape. It consumed everything,
      including Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radius of that fog was too wide for Han Sen to escape. While he was
      inside, his Dongxuan Aura was also suppressed and dampened by the mist.
      This made him feel uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hallucinations could not confuse Han Sen, but this mist carried a phantom
      pressure with it. It weighed on Han Sen and slowed him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six king spirits, each with their horrible weapons, all managed to
      catch up due to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight was going poorly for Han Sen. It was fortunate he had the powers
      of his God geno core and a number of airborne talents for maneuvering. He
      also had the Dongxuan Sutra and phoenix techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was only just managing to hold his own. He kept getting beaten
      back, and he began to collect injuries. Luckily, all his weak spots were
      okay, so he wasn’t in any danger of dying just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a long time of such fighting, death would be inevitable if
      things did not change. Han Sen decided to use super king spirit mode to
      see if he could do something about the mist, but just as he was about to,
      he heard a familiar voice.
    </p>
    <p>“Daddy!”</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen turned around. The mist was too thick, and all he could make out
      was the sight of something small approaching. He eventually saw a
      beautiful little girl crawling through the fog like a rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bao’er!” Han Sen was both surprised and delighted. He had no clue why she
      was there, and neither did he have any idea how she’d found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dad, I missed you.” Bao’er looked happy now, and she leaped back into Han
      Sen’s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen caught her, but this act distracted him from the battle. And with
      that opening, a king spirit was able to deliver a firm slash against his
      back. His blood sprayed through the cleft in his armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen resumed the fight, all the while trying to escape. Bao’er looked
      incredibly angry. She raised her pudgy arms and summoned her gourd. Then,
      she pointed it at the mist that was veiling all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist was then sucked away, like water that had been drained. It all
      vanished into Bao’er’s gourd without issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blergh!” The king spirit that had unleashed that mist spilled out some
      blood. The other king spirits were angered by this, and their furor only
      heightened. They raged at Han Sen with greater ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen was happy. He felt the burden of the fog lift, enabling him to
      flap his wings and soar into the open sky. He could not lose the hounding
      of the king spirits, but at least they couldn’t catch up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bao’er, you are a good daughter to have,” Han Sen complimented her as he
      flew.
    </p>
    <p>Bao’er cockily responded, “Bao’er is Dad’s best baby.”</p>
    <p>
      The Elysium spirits, unable to catch up with Han Sen, tried to use their
      swords to stop him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen’s movement was better than the king spirits, and everything
      they tried to do missed. They couldn’t slow him down, not even for a
      second. The slashes ended up wreaking havoc on the ground below, as if it
      was the end of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen ignored them, though, and he just kept up his escape. He’d earn no
      benefit from battling them, and with the risk involved in fighting them
      being as large as it was, Han Sen didn’t fancy doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king spirits really wanted Han Sen dead, though; they weren’t keen on
      the prospect of giving up the chase. They chased Han Sen for a few days,
      until he was able to reach the Underworld and fly through the tunnels and
      caves of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king spirits stopped at the entrance of the Underworld. They were
      clearly afraid of something, and they weren’t going to follow him any
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like this place belongs entirely to Dark Spirit. Should we
      continue our pursuit?” one of the king spirits asked, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other king spirits hesitated, but one said boldly, “Of course! He is
      not of Dark Spirit, so what is there for us to be afraid of? We can’t let
      him escape. And if we fail to kill him, what can we tell the priest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, the king spirit entered. Clenching their jaws, the others
      followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen saw the Elysium king spirits following, he was delighted. The
      landscape of the Underworld was complicated. It was perfect for him to
      make the most of Heavenly Go and the Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he used the terrain to his advantage, it might even be possible for him
      to kill them there. But Han Sen, after thinking about it some more,
      decided not to attempt to kill them immediately. He was going to go to the
      place where the shell king had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the hordes of scary creatures that had gathered there. So,
      there was still a chance he could use them to aid in the fight against the
      king spirits. If he was lucky, he could end up hitting two birds with one
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen traveled for a while, but he didn’t see any creatures. There were
      no super creatures, or creatures of lower classes either.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s weird. Where did they all go?” Han Sen ran towards the fallen
      shell king, but there was no sign of a creature there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen flew past the shell, planning to proceed onwards to Dark Spirit
      Shelter. If Dark Spirit discovered they had been invaded by Elysium
      spirits, Han Sen could pretend to be Ling Mei’er’s subordinate. If he
      pulled that off, it’d not fare well for the spirits that chased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen flew over the shell and glanced down into the big hole at its
      top, his heart jumped. A dark purple pincer flashed from the hole like an
      excavator. The teeth-laden pincer almost nicked Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked inside the hole where the pincer had come from, and he
      could see more. A dark purple crab was crawling up into the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not know since when the shell king’s body had been claimed by
      the crab.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the crab, after coming out of the shell, immediately encountered the
      king spirits that were still in pursuit. The pincers moved so fast it
      looked like they were teleporting, and the crab tried to grab two of the
      king spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits had not expected something so big to be lying in wait beneath
      them. When they noticed the pincers coming towards them, they had to use
      their swords to block.
    </p>
    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      The super geno core weapons, fueled with Elysium power, came crashing down
      on the pincer. But the strikes did not even leave a mark; they only
      succeeded in making the creature even angrier. The eyes of the crab
      gleamed with a purple color and obvious bloodlust. Next, the crab gathered
      itself, then hurled its entire body forward. The pincers were going for
      the king spirits at a blisteringly quick speed.
