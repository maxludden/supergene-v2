      “Blergh!” Han Sen coughed up some blood. The last punch from Outer Sky
      King had still caused him pain. Of course, he didn’t show it while he had
      his audience, as he had wanted to appear strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen hid inside an empty cave to heal. Before the healing process was
      complete, though, he heard a tapping noise. His face went slack with
      dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tap-tap noise was fast, and when he looked towards the cave’s
      entrance, he saw a pair of Crystal Shoes. They were the Crystal Shoes from
      Eastern Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was afraid of those shoes, and he didn’t want to find himself
      being controlled by them again. As soon as he saw the shoes he ran, but it
      was like they remembered who he was. They pursued him, and the tap-tap
      noise followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why are you chasing me? Tell me what it is you like about me, and I’ll
      change that aspect!” Han Sen did not have the strength to run far. He
      placed himself behind a tree and looked back at the shoes in misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter where he went, though, he could not escape the tracking shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Shoes walked in front of Han Sen, but they did not attempt to
      attach themselves to his feet. All they did was follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Shoes came before him, but Han Sen realized that they didn’t
      want to control him. It was a big relief, so he was able to just ignore
      them and rest by the tree for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoes settled next to Han Sen. Whenever Han Sen chose to rest, the
      shoes rested. Whenever Han Sen walked, they followed suit If Han Sen had
      not been able to confirm that there was nothing in the space above them,
      he would have believed the shoes had an invisible wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, the Crystal Shoes did not want to control Han Sen. After he got
      his bearings, Han Sen was able to travel back to his shelter. He wanted to
      go back and find a way in which he might deal with the shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was in a rush to go home now, too. He didn’t know he had become
      famous in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, but regardless, everyone knew about
      Skysword now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running into Outer Sky Shelter for a fight, and then making it back out,
      was not something many had ever accomplished. But to top it all off, he
      was a human.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lin Feng and his friends heard the news, they could scarcely believe
      it. They asked around many times for validation, but it was confirmed to
      be the truth. Han Sen was Skysword, the one with Crystal Shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were chasing after Han Sen to help him, but they left when they got
      word he had already escaped himself. Little Star and Bao’er then brought
      them safely to Shadow Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boss, you are so good.” The whole Fourth God’s Sanctuary now knows that
      you are Skysword. Cheap Sheep looked at Han Sen in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t in the mood to hear any such boot-licking, though. He
      headed straight for the spirit hall, wishing to return to the Alliance via
      the teleporter there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen trusted those he had left with his family. He didn’t have to go
      back; he just wanted to get rid of the shoes. After all, they were in the
      sanctuary, and after he left, they shouldn’t have been able to affect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen walked into the teleporter, gave one last look at the shoes, and
      then left.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen stepped out into the Alliance, he looked back at the
      teleporter. He was given an unfortunate shock, though; one that made his
      face turn green. For some reason, the Crystal Shoes had followed Han Sen
      out and made use of the teleporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No way.” Han Sen frowned and walked back. The Crystal Shoes did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m warning you. You can go wherever you want, follow anyone you want,
      except for me. Okay? If this continues, I will bring you harm.” Han Sen
      pointed at the Crystal Shoes and went on to say angrily, “Don’t think I
      can’t or won’t do anything to you. I might not be able to do anything to
      you in the sanctuary, but the rules are different out here. I can kill you
      in this place. Do you believe me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Shoes did not move, perhaps indicating that they did not
      understand him.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen turned around and walked. The shoes followed.</p>
    <p>
      “You brought this upon yourselves.” Han Sen summoned the white crystal
      armor. Then, he reached toward the Crystal Shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Shoes evaded his lunge, so Han Sen used the armor’s power to
      maximize his speed and strength to try and break the Crystal Shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Crystal Shoes moved too swiftly. Their speed was no slower than
      the white crystal armor’s, and Han Sen was unable to touch them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s white crystal armor gave him a lot of strength. It gave him a
      power that exceeded the capabilities of a demigod. When he was wearing the
      white crystal armor, not even Outer Sky King could match his strength and
      speed. Han Sen was shocked to find out the shoes were faster than him in
      that state,
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is this? Such a weird power and strength they have. And they can
      leave the sanctuary, too. This really is strange.”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen stopped and looked at the Crystal Shoes.</p>
    <p>
      “Are these really made out of crystal? Are they crystallizer items,
      perhaps?” Han Sen thought to himself, although he knew he couldn’t be
      certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, what are you doing?” Han Sen was in his garden, and he had been
      busy chasing the shoes for a while. Ji Yanran came out of the house with
      Littleflower in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>“I got followed by high heels.” Han Sen looked bitter.</p>
    <p>“What does that mean?” Ji Yanran did not understand.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen pointed at the shoes on the floor and said, “I’ve been followed by
      these.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those shoes are crystal art shoes. They aren’t implanted with an Al, so
      how can they follow you?” Ji Yanran looked at the transparent crystal
      shoes. There was no wiring on the inside to see, either. They were shoes,
      plain and simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the style of the crystal shoes was something Ji Yanran really liked.
      She walked near them and pulled out her little white feet She wanted to
      try them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen quickly stopped her and said, “These things are evil. Don’t touch
      them!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen told her about all that had transpired with the Crystal Shoes, and
      when he finished, Ji Yanran burst out laughing. She said, “Well, they
      didn’t do anything bad to you. Why are you so quick to assume they are
      evil?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to say more, but the Crystal Shoes then seemed to have
      heard and understood what Ji Yanran said. They went tap-tapping again, as
      if in agreement.
    </p>
    <p>“These are such amazing shoes.” Ji Yanran was surprised.</p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Shoes seemed to have been made extra happy by the compliments
      they received, and they decided to forget about tailing Han Sen and
      instead go for Ji Yanran. They slipped themselves onto her feet before Han
      Sen had a chance to react.
