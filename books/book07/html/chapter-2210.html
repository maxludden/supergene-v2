<h2>Black Hole Spider</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2210</h3>

<p>Inside a ship that was bound for the systems of chaos, Han Sen
and Han Yan were engaged in a card game. They had been flying for a
long time, and boredom had set in.</p>
<p>The Ice Blue Knights wouldn’t play card games, even if they were
bored to death.</p>
<p>But Han Sen and the others were Mister White’s private guards
now, so they could play any game they wished because Mister White
allowed it. Mister White was actually playing with them.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Mister White, Han Yan, Ji Qing, and Bao’er were all
playing together. Zero and Little Angel hadn’t been interested. Han
Meng’er was probably off obsessing over her beloved bows, and
Little Silver and Little Star were resting.</p>
<p>In the room where they were playing cards, the only people that
weren’t very close to Han Sen were Mister White and another guard.
The guard was a man named Crime, who belonged to the Lane race.</p>
<p>He was three meters tall, and his body looked lean and powerful.
He had long blonde hair that brushed his shoulders, and his square
face was alarmingly serious. His eyes gleamed brightly.</p>
<p>His black armor had gold markings, and a gold lion sword was
belted to his waist. It looked like a sturdy weapon.</p>
<p>He was different from Han Sen. Crime was one of Mister White’s
guards as well, but he was a King of the Lane. He was a very smart
person, and he had a keen insight into things and people.</p>
<p>Every time he looked at Han Sen and the others, he couldn’t help
but frown.</p>
<p>A group of Marquises, and even Earls, had become Mister White’s
guards. It seemed like some sort of bad joke. He didn’t think they
were worthy, and they would cause nothing but trouble. When they
failed, he would have to pick up the slack.</p>
<p>But Crime wouldn’t voice any of his concerns because the
decision had come directly from Mister White. He was just going to
do his job, and at the same time, keep his eyes trained on the
others.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m done. This is boring,” Han Sen said as he lost again.
He stretched long and slow.</p>
<p>All the chips on the table were heaped close to Bao’er. It
looked like she was sitting beside a small mountain. Han Sen owed
her a lot of money now.</p>
<p>Ji Qing, Han Yan, and Mister White had lost, too, though not as
much as Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Let’s play again…” Ji Qing said, feeling desperate. She had
lost even more than Han Sen.</p>
<p>Ji Qing’s luck had never been this bad before. Everyone was
losing, and she almost thought that Bao’er was cheating.</p>
<p>Han Sen started to say something, but before he could, an alarm
sounded. Han Sen stood up.</p>
<p>Mister White smiled and said, “Don’t worry. That is a silent
alarm, not a battle alarm. Let’s head for the control room.”</p>
<p>The others stayed in the room while Han Sen went to the control
room with Mister White and Crime.</p>
<p>When Han Sen arrived in the control room, he noticed that Ice
Blue Knight King was there. The other important crew members of the
ship were there as well, and that included Night River King.</p>
<p>Night River King gave Han Sen a frigid glance. He didn’t look
angry, but Han Sen knew that the Rebate wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King stepped over to Mister White and explained
urgently, “Mister White, we have spotted a Black Hole Spider. We’re
remaining in silent mode to avoid disturbing it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the monitors and saw a black spider hovering
in space. The creature was as big as a planet. The spider web
encompassed a whole bunch of other planets, making the entire area
look like a net of unbelievable size. The Black Hole Spider was
lying in the net’s center.</p>
<p>This was Han Sen’s first time ever seeing something so big.
Humans were tiny creatures before it, as small as bacteria by
comparison.</p>
<p>The whole Ice Blue fleet went into silent mode, and all their
lights went dark. All their scanning and communications equipment
were switched off as well. They shut down most of their thrusters,
as well, so only a few were left running on minimal power. And
then, the ship slowly drifted past the Black Hole Spider.</p>
<p>“The systems of chaos are scarier than I imagined,” Han Sen
thought. That Black Hole Spider must have been deified, and even
the Extreme King knights wouldn’t dare to touch it.</p>
<p>The ship slowly drew nearer to the Black Hole Spider. As they
approached, Han Sen’s brow furrowed. There were many smaller
creatures living on it.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen look visibly surprised, Mister White explained to
him, “The Black Hole Spiders themselves aren’t too threatening. It
doesn’t bother to hunt small creatures like us. It eats planets,
meteors, and even ships. But as long as we don’t enter its
proximity, we ought to be safe. However, there is an entire
biosphere of creatures that live on the Black Hole Spider,
including many elites and Kings. To us, they are more threatening
than the spider itself.”</p>
<p>“If there are so many xenogeneics living on it, can we kill and
harvest them?” Han Sen asked with keen curiosity.</p>
<p>“Of course, but only if you aren’t afraid of attracting the
Black Hole Spider’s attention,” answered a knight behind Ice Blue
Knight King.</p>
<p>It took the ship three hours to pass by the Black Hole Spider
safely. They didn’t alert the Black Hole Spider to their
whereabouts, and neither did they draw the attention of the
xenogeneics living on it.</p>
<p>Everyone felt great relief when they had made it through. The
Ice Blue Knights really didn’t want to deal with the Black Hole
Spider or its entourage.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the danger was over, but suddenly, an explosion
came from behind them, rocking the entire ship. A loud alarm began
to blare.</p>
<p>“It’s a Galactic Shrimp. Tell our ships to enter battle
formation and prepare for a fight!” Ice Blue King commanded.</p>
<p>The other ships in the fleet started to fire their weapons at
the threat. Lights were flaring everywhere through space as
powerful explosions erupted all around them.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see from the video feed that there was a shoal of
what looked like shrimp, only they were glowing blue and around ten
meters long. They swirled around the ships.</p>
<p>They bounced around with small flicks of their bodies. Whenever
they moved close enough, the shrimps would become a blue light that
pelted the ship. Their hard shells could blow fifty-meter-wide
holes in the hull of a vessel. There were lots of explosions.</p>
<p>The powerful heavy guns of the ships turned to fire on the
Galactic Shrimps. Each round was like a sun that could consume
swathes of Galactic Shrimps at once. But even so, more and more
were coming.</p>
<p>Many blue lights shone around them. The Galactic Shrimps seemed
countless.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The Galactic Shrimps continued to hit the ships like
cannonballs, creating explosions every time.</p>
