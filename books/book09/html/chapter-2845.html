<p>Finally, it is the fourth round. I wonder if Golden Growler is
Little Gold Gold. Han Sen stared at the space battleground in
contemplation, waiting for Golden Growler to be revealed.</p>
<p>If Golden Growler was really Little Gold Gold, Han Sen was
worried about who its opponent might have been.</p>
<p>Although it was composed of only three words, one would know
what kind of race Ancient Thunder God was. It was a very scary
being composed of only three words.</p>
<p>Ancient God was the race with the least amount of beings out of
the three high races. There didn’t have very high numbers, and it
was almost impossible for them to obtain more. Every generation of
the Ancient God was the result of one dying. It was a case of death
and being reborn.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body had Ancient Water God’s Ancient God Origin. In
the future, it might become the new Ancient Water God.</p>
<p>In the past, Han Sen saw Ancient Water God assault the geno
hall. He thought Ancient Water God was an almighty being, but he
did not know how powerful it was. Now that he thought about it, it
was likely a scary being that was true god class.</p>
<p>Ancient Gods were born deified. It was not rare for the beings
of that race to become true god. If Golden Growler was Little Gold
Gold, going up against Ancient Thunder God would make it a bad
fight for him.</p>
<p>The sky shimmered with streaks of lightning as an Ancient God
giant formed of electricity appeared in the space battleground. It
was the same as Ancient Water God. Ancient Gods were creatures that
were formed of pure energy. Ancient Thunder God’s whole body was
composed completely of thunder. Every movement it made was carried
with the strength of thunder. The whole of space flickered with
lightning like it was there but not there. It was like it was
connected to the Ancient Thunder God.</p>
<p>To be honest, if it was all based on one’s appearance, Ancient
Thunder God looked more like a god spirit than King Jun and the
others.</p>
<p>Seeing Ancient Thunder God’s substance chains move, Han Sen’s
heart felt as if it was sinking. He started to hope Golden Growler
was not Little Gold Gold. No matter which way he viewed it, Ancient
Thunder God was a true god elite that was at the top of the
pyramid.</p>
<p>A shadow quickly appeared in the space battleground near Ancient
Thunder God. The body was not that big. It was only around 3 feet
tall. The body looked as if it had been made of gold. It kind of
looked like a lion or a Kirin. Its head had a gold horn, and its
hair looked as if it had been made of gold.</p>
<p>It really is Little Gold Gold! Han Sen was excited and happy
about that. He was exuberant to see Little Gold Gold again. He was
also surprised to see Little Gold Gold’s first fight was against
Ancient Thunder God. This match was likely going to be worse than
good. He suspected Little Gold Gold was going to lose.</p>
<p>“Growler’s blood still exists, but its blood does not seem to be
pure.” God looked at Little Gold Gold with interest.</p>
<p>When Little Gold Gold was kidnapped by the green-haired beast,
Han Sen knew what Growler bloodline Little Gold Gold had. But that
was not what he was concerned about. He just hoped Little Gold Gold
would turn out OK and safe. After all, his opponent was Ancient
Thunder God.</p>
<p>In this universe, not many creatures were able to recognize the
blood of Little Gold Gold. Not everyone was as smart as God. After
all, Little Gold Gold did not have pure blood. He looked a bit
different from the old growler too. The only ones that could
recognize Golden Growler were the oldest people in the universe.
Not many people knew what the growlers looked like in this day and
age.</p>
<p>Ancient Thunder God was not in the mood to figure out where
Little Gold Gold came from. His voice was like a thunderstorm that
rolled through space. He said, “If you leave now, you may continue
with your petty existence.”</p>
<p>Little Gold Gold looked at Ancient Thunder God with eyes that
appeared like gold glass. He did not speak or concede and exist the
space battleground.</p>
<p>Ancient Thunder God stopped talking. His eyes were brewing with
the power of thunder. They suddenly became two electric laser beams
that came straight for Little Gold Gold. There was enough power in
that attack to blow up a giant planet.</p>
<p>“It really is a true god being!” When Han Sen saw the scary
thunder god light, he was worried.</p>
<p>“Ancient Gods really are the loved ones of the universe. They
are born deified. The chance to become a true god is the highest
amongst the three high races. It is a shame they have difficulty
breeding. If it was easy for them, the whole universe would
undoubtedly be under their control.” Dia Robber could not help but
be complimentary.</p>
<p>Just as he spoke, the thunder power was going to land on Little
Gold Gold’s face. When it did, Little Gold Gold opened his
mouth.</p>
<p>Little Gold Gold’s body was only 3 feet tall, but his head was
big. It was like a male lion’s head. Ancient Thunder God was like a
thunder giant that was 300 feet tall. They were not even close to
being the same scale in size.</p>
<p>When Little Gold Gold opened his mouth, it became massive. It
was like it could swallow the sky and earth. The scary bolt of
electricity shot into his mouth. It did not affect Little Gold
Gold. Ancient Thunder God’s giant thunder giant body was swallowed
by Little Gold Gold.</p>
<p>Everyone in the universe was dead silent. Even the scariest
deified creatures were suddenly petrified. They all looked upon
Little Gold Gold, who looked entirely normal once again.</p>
<p>Belch!</p>
<p>Little Gold Gold looked full. He opened his mouth and burped. A
roll of thunder came with it. Then, it left the space battleground
wagging its tail.</p>
<p>“Is that it? Is it all over?”</p>
<p>“What just happened? Was Ancient Thunder God swallowed by a
little gold beast?”</p>
<p>“I think that’s what happened, and he burped.”</p>
<p>“No way… That was Ancient Thunder God… The incredibly powerful
Ancient God… How could it be swallowed… This has to be fake… It has
to be fake… Ancient Thunder God will fight his way out of the
creature’s stomach…”</p>
<p>“Fight your ass! Did you not see the geno god list? Didn’t you
see Golden Growler’s rank increase?”</p>
<p>“Holy shit! What kind of creature is that? It is so
powerful.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the universe was shocked. No one expected Ancient
Thunder God, who was so powerful, would be swallowed by a little
gold beast they had never seen before.</p>
<p>Ordinary creatures were shocked by how scary Golden Growler was,
but many true elites had strange expressions.</p>
<p>“Eating Dragon Phoenix. Eating Ancient God. The blood of the
growlers continues in this universe.” Bai King’s face looked
deathly serious.</p>
<p>“Do the growlers still have blood in this universe?” Old Vulture
and a few others were in shock.</p>
<p>“The growler bloodline still exists. It looks like the universe
is going to go crazy.” On the top floor of the Very High’s court in
Outer Sky, an old man opened his eyes and looked at the space
battleground. His face changed.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! The whole universe should be quivering in their boots
after witnessing the power of little mountain leader!” the
green-haired growler happily roared. “The growlers are back. Empty
Mountain’s invincible beast king is back.” He felt as if he was the
one who won the match and swallowed Ancient Thunder God.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, but he did not care if it was Golden
Growler or not. Little Gold Gold had become supremely powerful. He
was very happy about that.</p>
<p>Little Gold Gold has become so powerful in such a short amount
of time. I should work harder. Han Sen grabbed a chunk of the ink
feather god bird’s meat and shoved it in his mouth. He increased
the speed of its refinery.</p>
<p>“Deified gene +1,” the announcement said in his mind.</p>
<p>“This Golden Growler mix is no worse than a pure-blood growler.
It might seem even better. That is so weird.” God looked at Little
Gold Gold with interest.</p>
<p>No matter what the case was, that entire fight shocked the whole
universe, and it heralded the return of Empty Mountain. The
growlers were back.</p>
