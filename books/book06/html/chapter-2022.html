<h2>Ancient God Space</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2022</h3>

<p>Han Sen was in a bad mood. He had been in Ancient God for half a
day, and he had already walked thirty miles. He was sweating.</p>
<p>Under the protection of Yun Changkong, the tenth elder, Han Sen
arrived in the Ancient God space. When he arrived, though, he
realized that some power had entangled him. The power he felt was
reminiscent of Sky Heart Lock. It was a little different, but the
effects were similar. It hindered Han Sen’s movement.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen knew why the leader made him suffer the Sky Heart
Locks. It was because he wanted him to experience what it was like
to be hampered. The Sky Palace leader had planned to send Han Sen
here a long time ago, that was clear.</p>
<p>It was only a shame that the Sky Heart Locks had not been broken
yet. If they had been, the Ancient God space’s restrictions
wouldn’t have been so arduous.</p>
<p>The Ancient God space was not as dangerous as he thought it
would be, however. Aside from rocks everywhere, Han Sen walked all
day without encountering a single xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong told Han Sen that his job there would be to hunt
xenogeneics. The xenogeneics there were special, and their genes
were fairly unique. The more he managed to retrieve, the
better.</p>
<p>But as of yet, he hadn’t been able to find a single one. Without
any to find, there weren’t any to kill.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen saw something move over a little rocky
mountain. It was a being of some type, but upon closer inspection,
the sight made Han Sen frown.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” The person saw Han Sen and screamed aloud. Then they
approached Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Why do I see you everywhere?” Han Sen said to Hai’er the
Pirate. He really hadn’t wanted to see her again.</p>
<p>Hai’er was an Earl now. Her presence was much stronger than when
he bumped into her with the Buddha.</p>
<p>“I should be the one asking you this. I thought Burning Lamp
Alpha turned you into an ant. How did you recover?”</p>
<p>Hai’er looked at Han Sen curiously.</p>
<p>“It was just a small trick. He didn’t really do anything.” Han
Sen smiled. He was not in the mood to explain things to her.</p>
<p>Hai’er smiled and said, “Well, since our fates repeatedly
intertwine, why don’t we cooperate once more? Together we can slay
the Ancient God xenogeneics.”</p>
<p>“No. I prefer being alone. I am meant to be alone. Whoever
follows me is subject to awful luck.” Han Sen did not want her and
her trouble to join him.</p>
<p>Hai’er grinned and said, “But this is fate! A clairvoyant told
me. I connect well with loners, so that means we are meant to be
together. We are partners, you know?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay if you want to follow, but I won’t be sharing a
single xenogeneic with you.” Han Sen shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Ah, so you weren’t told. The Buddha sent someone to this place,
too. What do you think might happen if he caught sight of you?”
Hai’er was not angry, and she kept talking as she followed behind
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of Burning Lamp Alpha, so why would I be afraid
of a student? Even if I was scared, is cooperating with you
supposed to make me less scared?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>The Buddha sent a Marquise Buddha. He is not as strong as Seven
Spirit, but he is an important person to them. However, that isn’t
the thing you need to know. The most important thing is that the
Buddha are cooperating with Demon. The Demons are enemies of Sky
Palace, and they sent a person named Sharon. Do you have any idea
how dangerous your situation is?” Hai’er said.</p>
<p>“Who is Sharon?” Han Sen kept on walking lackadaisically, as if
he didn’t care at all.</p>
<p>You don’t know who Sharon is?” Hai’er asked Han Sen with
shock.</p>
<p>Do I have to know who he is?” Han Sen lifted his lips.</p>
<p>Hai’er finally believed that Han Sen really didn’t know. “You
are Knife Queen’s student, and you do is? Have you heard of Lone
Bamboo in Sky Palace?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Han Sen said casually.</p>
<p>“Good. Sharon’s reputation with the Demon is similar to Lone
Bamboo’s in Sky Palace. They are frequently mentioned together. He
has already become a Marquise, so you are bound to know what will
happen if you see him,” Hai’er said.</p>
<p>“People talk about me in the same capacity as Lone Bamboo, too.
That means I don’t have to be afraid of that Sharon.” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I know you. Seven Spirit almost
killed you. Sharon is much better than Seven Spirit.” Hai’er looked
at him with disdain.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and explained no more. Due to Sky Palace being
quite private, news from the inside didn’t often spread outside.
Not many outsiders knew about him and Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>“Even if I was afraid of Sharon, what use would bringing you
along prove? Don’t tell me you have battled him before,” Han Sen
said casually.</p>
<p>“I cannot beat him, but I know that there is a secret place in
the Ancient God space. I can take you there, where we can fight
xenogeneics and avoid encountering Sharon. Do you want to co-op or
not? We split the xenogeneics fifty-fifty. I can help kill them,
too,” Hai’er said.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound too shabby. What kind of place is it,
anyway?” Han Sen had walked for so long, and despite that, he
hadn’t seen a single xenogeneic. He thought he wasn’t going to fare
too well.</p>
<p>“That place is mysterious. When the Pirates of yore came here,
they stumbled upon it by pure happenstance. No one else should be
able to find it without me guiding them there.” Hai’er looked all
cocky.</p>
<p>“If it is as good as you are leading me to believe, then I guess
I can cooperate with you,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Of course! We will go right now.” Hai’er said, and then kept on
walking. After they met in Holy Heaven, she understood Han Sen a
bit more. She knew Han Sen was the trustable sort, and as long as
he would gain some sort of benefit, he wouldn’t betray and kill
her.</p>
<p>Plus, Hai’er had a secret defense system. She wasn’t afraid of
Han Sen betraying her.</p>
<p>Han Sen then followed Hai’er. There were many rocks around, but
that was all. There was no place for the creatures to hide, so the
chance of finding creatures there was virtually nil.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was restricted by the Ancient God space’s powers.
Together, the pair walked dozens of miles. They ended up sweating
so much, it looked as if they had just emerged from spring
water.</p>
<p>“Here, this is it.” Hai’er looked at her map and came to a stop
near a crevice.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the crevice and noted how crooked it was. Only
one person could go in at a time, slipping through sideways. There
were many crevices such as this in the Ancient God space, too.</p>
<p>Hai’er went in first, and Han Sen followed her from behind. They
both moved along the crevice for a few miles, until eventually, the
space they occupied began to widen.</p>
<p>Inside the mountains, there was a giant cave. Han Sen saw a
statue made of stone just sitting there, but it was at least one
hundred meters tall. In front of the statue, Han Sen and Hai’er
were as small as two ants.</p>
