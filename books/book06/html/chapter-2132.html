<h2>One Skill Breaks Ten Thousand Skills</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2132</h3>

<p>When the flowers on Evil Eye’s armor opened in bloom, the mass
of his power reached a truly frightening level. He was much scarier
than even Dragon Eight’s gold Dragon body.</p>
<p>“Your knowledge and control are better than mine, it would
appear. But so what? Before a sufficient amount of raw, physical
power, you have no hope of triumphing. You will ultimately lose.”
Evil Eye looked at Han Sen coldly.</p>
<p>“What? You lack skill, so you want to start brawling?” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>“Power and skill are never distinguishable as two separate
things. Your knowledge and your ability to control the fluctuations
of power is impressive, but can you apply that talent in actual
combat? Mere talk is useless.” Evil Eye said, his power continuing
to burgeon.</p>
<p>“Then come and give it a try,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Ha, this is precisely how I wanted it.” Evil Eye’s body shot
toward Han Sen like a purple shadow.</p>
<p>His skills were no better than Dragon Eight’s, but his entire
body had been transformed into a killing machine. Purple flowers
began to appear across his limbs. They swayed as if they were
alive, and their sole purpose was to pursue Han Sen.</p>
<p>For Han Sen, Evil Eye was the rare sort of enemy that required
his full effort and attention. He was not the type of foe Han Sen
could afford to underestimate, so he focused his powers and
prepared the Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go to engage Evil Eye
properly. He also planned to make use of Super Spank.</p>
<p>Evil Eye’s use of skills was fluid, though. They kept on
changing. He had a roster of techniques, after all. He had the
skills of the Dragon, the Buddha, the Destroyed, and so on. But
what’s more, it felt as if every skill was mastered. While they
might have all had different purposes and meanings, he was able to
combine them all seamlessly.</p>
<p>Every technique was stunningly employed, and every blow was
followed by an unexpected change of style.</p>
<p>The elites were all confused by what they saw. Many of their
faces changed, especially when they realized that they were seeing
glimpses of the legendary techniques of the race they belonged
to.</p>
<p>Han Sen, on the other hand, fought in a totally different
manner. His skills were very clear. They appeared simple, but they
still had a depth to them that the onlookers couldn’t quite
understand.</p>
<p>After watching many of his moves, the audience was able to
understand how he was using his kicks and punches.</p>
<p>No matter how much Evil Eye was able to alter his attacks,
wherever Han Sen touched, Evil Eye’s power would be reduced to
dust. Super Spank was able to break and disintegrate every sequence
structure it came into contact with.</p>
<p>Evil Eye’s body split into two, and both bodies attacked Han
Sen. There was no illusion, and the two forms really did comprise
Evil Eye’s actual body. And they were both equally powerful.</p>
<p>“Destroyed’s Doppelganger! Isn’t that a technique that only one
of the Destroyed is able to learn?” Everyone was shocked by this
reveal.</p>
<p>In the next second, that shock turned into awe. The two Evil
Eye’s split again, and now there were four Evil Eye’s on the
battleground.</p>
<p>Destroyed’s Doppelganger technique was only able to split a
person into three due to the origin race having three heads and six
arms.</p>
<p>Evil Eye was not one of the Destroyed. He didn’t have three
heads and six arms, so he was able to split into four. That was
rather scary.</p>
<p>Han Sen made no move yet, though. Heavenly Go was still pumping
in his heart. Fighting four people was an insane thing to attempt,
but even when faced with that, he was able to keep his calm.</p>
<p>The four Evil Eye’s piled on the pressure by surrounding Han Sen
on all sides with different techniques. The nobles that watched
were all confused by what they saw, but they were able to
understand that despite all that, Evil Eye hadn’t exactly gained
the upper-hand.</p>
<p>“Powerful Evil Eye! Scary Dollar!”</p>
<p>“Dollar is the one that is able to breakdown any skill he sees.
The Evilbreaker powers of the Dragon were weak to him, don’t you
remember?”</p>
<p>“Argh, he is so strong! Where did these humans come from? Aren’t
they so scary? Are all humans like this?”</p>
<p>“No way. If all humans were this strong, wouldn’t they be
famous? They surely wouldn’t be nameless and shrouded in mystery as
this fellow is. I think Dollar must be the first elite humans have
had in millions of years.”</p>
<p>“What ability is Dollar using? Fighters are always weak against
particular elements, but no matter what geno art is used against
him, he is able to break it in a flash. This is terrifying me.”</p>
<p>In Sky Palace, Thousand Feather Crane and the others were all
frozen. Yun Suyi pulled Yun Changkong and asked, “Father, what is
Dollar using? How can he break every skill and render all of Evil
Eye’s geno arts useless?”</p>
<p>Because Yun Changkong had business with the Feather, he hadn’t
returned to Sky Palace with Han Sen. If he had been with Han Sen,
then Han Sen wouldn’t have vanished in the attack.</p>
<p>“I am afraid that I do not understand, either.” Yun Changkong
shook his head.</p>
<p>Hearing that, the Yun sisters and Thousand Feather Crane felt
their eyes widen. Dollar was just a Marquise, despite how strong he
was. But he did things that not even a King class person like Yun
Changkong could understand. It was a very strange scenario, for
sure.</p>
<p>Evil Eye looked very glum, as all this transpired. He felt as if
the breadth of his power was actually much stronger than Han Sen’s,
but every time he came against the human, his powers were
shattered. All in all, it made him realize something.</p>
<p>“He can use that dismantling power in combat like this?” Evil
Eye was starting to think that Dollar was some sort of old monster
from ages past, and that he had lived through time by being reborn
in the same manner Evil Eye had. To him, there was no other
explanation for Han Sen’s performance.</p>
<p>Although he was able to dismantle powers, it wasn’t something he
was fast enough to do in a real fight. He could only see the
weaknesses if he had time to examine them.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen punched an Evil Eye, and that body degraded swiftly into
nothing.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Sutra’s judgment and the formation employed by
Heavenly Go were starting to come together. Han Sen was now the one
controlling the fight.</p>
<p>Evil Eye suddenly stumbled back and left the immediate
battlefield. The two doppelgangers still functioning returned to
the primary host and melded back into him. Just as everyone was
guessing what Evil Eye would do next, his forehead cracked open.
The third eye that had four purple pupils appeared on his
forehead.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong and the Sky screamed. “Sky! Evil Eye became one of
the Sky!”</p>
<p>“That explains why I was unable to see Evil Eye’s four evil
eyes. They resided inside his third Sky eye.”</p>
<p>“Shit! He is one of the Sky. That means Evil Eye has not been
fighting with power. For the Sky, opening their third eye means
things are just getting started.”</p>
<p>“Evil Eye looks pretty p*ssed.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if Dollar will be able to compete against Evil Eye
with his Sky eye open.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Evil Eye’s third eye. The pupils looked
familiar, for some reason. And now that he realized that Evil Eye
was one of the Sky, that sense of familiarity heightened.</p>
<p>“In front of this monstrous power, your skills will matter very
little.” Evil Eye opened his Sky eye. His power had increased by a
vast amount, and the purple light of his Sky eye flared the purple
flowers across his armor. A fire kicked up, and it enveloped Evil
Eye’s entire body.</p>
