<h2>Strange Stone Hall</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2219</h3>

<p>The small city was shaped into a simple square. The well was at
the center of the city’s plaza, and at the end of every long street
radiating out from the city center, the city’s walls were visible
at the far ends.</p>
<p>Behind the plaza was a stone palace, and on both sides of the
gates stood stone statues. On the left side was a Nine-Life Cat
statue. Aside from it being bigger than an actual Nine-Life Cat, it
looked exactly the same in all its features. It even gave off an
identical feeling. It was creepily similar.</p>
<p>And on the right side of the gate was a statue of a warrior that
was plated in armor. In addition to the armor, it wielded a bone
knife. The warrior’s face and hands, which weren’t plated, were
skeletal.</p>
<p>“This statue must be General Ghost Bone, but if this is his
city, then he is the owner of this place. Why would his statue be
near the gate like a guard, then?” Han Sen then had an idea, and
his breath caught in his chest. “The statues for the Nine-Life Cat
and General Ghost Bone are before the gates like guards. Does that
mean the owner of the palace was actually the Sacred leader?”</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to think of other options, but he couldn’t come up
with any other figure in Sacred who might have used those two as
guards.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know the exact nature of the Nine-Life Cat’s
association with Sacred, but General Ghost Bone was one of the ten
generals. Surely only Sacred’s leader could command a man like that
to guard the gates.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan their surroundings. He
couldn’t detect any other creatures in the vicinity. Perhaps
Inspector Edward had already managed to find what he had come for
and then left.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t want to take the risk of leaving the well just
yet, however. The gate ahead was open. With it being ajar, it was
hard not to suspect someone might be there. He had to be
careful.</p>
<p>“You guys wait here; I will go and take a look.” Han Sen looked
at Huangfu Jing, who was beside him in the water, then he touched
Little Invisible. After that, Han Sen disappeared. He climbed out
of the well in secret.</p>
<p>Han Sen approached the palace, using his Dongxuan Aura to hide
his presence completely.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked in front of the palace with great care. When he
looked inside the palace, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Because the city wasn’t that big, the palace was mostly
comprised of one hall. From his vantage point, Han Sen could see
everything in the hall. And curiously, there were many holes in the
floor of the hall. They were like graves.</p>
<p>There were two people inside, and they wore badges that
identified them as belonging to the Ice Blue Knights. They were
resting atop a statue. After Han Sen saw what that upside-down
statue depicted, he was even more surprised.</p>
<p>That statue looked exactly like the one he had been in the Human
Emperor shelter. Han Sen thought the statue inside that palace
would depict the Sacred leader, but oddly, it was actually a statue
of the Human Emperor.</p>
<p>“No way. The Human Emperor came from Sacred? These timelines
don’t align. The Human Emperor was in the sanctuaries, and he had
been there for many years. Sacred was already destroyed before he
left the sanctuaries. So, how can his statue be here?” Han Sen
walked over to the door and looked inside the hall. Aside from the
Human Emperor statue, there was nothing else. There were only some
stone tables and stone chairs.</p>
<p>Including the Human Emperor statue, though, everything stone had
been heavily damaged. At first, Han Sen could only see one half of
the broken statue, as the other half was nearby.</p>
<p>Clearly, someone was looking for something in this hall. But
whatever it was, they hadn’t found it yet. If they had, two of them
wouldn’t have been guarding the area as they were.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at those two Ice Blue Knights, and he noted that
they were neither weak nor strong. They might have been Dukes, but
they didn’t belong to the Extreme King. One of them looked like
Exploding Bear, while the other looked like a Dragon hybrid. He had
the horns, but he didn’t have the dragon wings.</p>
<p>“I say that Inspector Edward must be mistaken. If this was the
holy place belonging to the Sacred leader, then how come we haven’t
found the relic that we’re looking for?” asked the Fire Bear Duke
with a sigh.</p>
<p>“If Inspector Edward says it is here, then here it is. Now, shut
up and go back to work,” the hybrid Dragon Duke said.</p>
<p>“I want to work, but I would like to know how to work,” the Fire
Bear Duke chuckled.</p>
<p>The hybrid Dragon Duke frowned and said, “Ice Blue Knight King
didn’t come back in time, so it was up to Inspector Edward to deal
with them. Otherwise, the knight king would have spotted something
fishy going on. Just wait a little while longer. Inspector Edward
will soon contact us and tell us what to do.”</p>
<p>At least Han Sen had learned that Inspector Edward hadn’t yet
found what he had come there for. Han Sen kept eavesdropping, but
he didn’t hear anything else about the holy place or the Sacred
relic they were searching for.</p>
<p>He’d been able to confirm the presence of treasure, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t enter the hall. He walked around the city first.
Many of the places had been rummaged through, and many of the
buildings had been toppled. The Inspector’s knights must have been
searching there for a long time, but they hadn’t yet found what
they had come for.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t good at finding things, so he wouldn’t be able to
find where it was hidden, either. If Inspector Edward couldn’t find
whatever it was, then Han Sen surely couldn’t.</p>
<p>Back in the plaza, Han Sen looked again at the stone palace. He
noticed there were no signs or plaques adorning it. The building
was very roughly constructed, and there were no carvings or
paintings upon its surface.</p>
<p>But judging from the statues around it, the palace shouldn’t
have been built too long ago. If Han Sen had to make a guess, he’d
wager it was only around 10,000 years old.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the statues of General Ghost Bone and the
Nine-Life Cat again. He confirmed that they were nothing special,
and that they were indeed just statues. The materials for their
construction had most likely come from the nearby mountains.</p>
<p>Han Sen was annoyed by his lack of progress, so he summoned his
Purple-Eye Butterfly beast soul. His right eye turned purple as his
pupil split into four sections. He looked at everything around the
palace, and he even examined the two statues.</p>
<p>“Nothing… nothing.” His eye analyzed everything, including the
statue of the Human Emperor. They were all made of ordinary rocks,
a material that was everywhere across Planet Ice Blue.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept looking around until something caught his
attention.</p>
<p>Near the Human Emperor statue was a cracked stone tile. It
looked like it was supposed to belong to a canopy that had once sat
above the head of the Human Emperor statue. The stone tile was a
chunk of that canopy.</p>
<p>The Human Emperor statue had been cut in half, and the canopy
had broken as well. It collapsed near the statue, and some of it
broke into pieces, whereas other sections remained intact.</p>
<p>When Han Sen scanned over the rubble, he saw that most of the
stone fragments were ordinary chunks of rock. They were nothing
special.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s eye couldn’t analyze one of the stones.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eye was using a deified beast soul. If that deified
power couldn’t analyze a piece of rock, then that was an anomaly
that Han Sen found very, very interesting.</p>
