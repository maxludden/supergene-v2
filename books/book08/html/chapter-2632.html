<p>“I am the greatest in my league.” Exquisite lay on the ground.
She stared at Han Sen and didn’t try to move. She thought about
what Han Sen had told her, and complex emotions washed over
her.</p>
<p>“Brother Han is… He’s too strong…”</p>
<p>“Even Exquisite is trash before Father Han. What kind of Very
High is she?”</p>
<p>“So scary. The siblings of the Han family are monsters.”</p>
<p>“This is too cruel. He even bullied the crap out of a Very High
student.”</p>
<p>“Those punches were way too awesome. I never liked the Very
High, and they wanted to take Brother Han and Brother Lone Bamboo
to be their slaves. And see? They don’t even have what it
takes!”</p>
<p>The blood of the Sky Palace students was boiling. The Very High
always acted as if the Sky were inferior to them. Right now, as
they watched Han Sen destroy Exquisite, they were filled with glee.
They all wished they could batter the Very High in the same way Han
Sen could.</p>
<p>“Can this fight end now?” Han Sen turned back to Exquisite, who
was still sitting on the ground at the edge of the arena. She was
staring right at him.</p>
<p>Exquisite seemed to have been startled from a deep slumber. As
she stared at Han Sen, resolve settled into her eyes.</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t over yet. The universe is still on my side. I
won’t lose, especially not to you.” Exquisite slowly stood up. Her
hair rose and waved in the air, despite the absence of wind. Her
tai chi eyes spun dangerously, and the black and white colors
glowed. Her aura began to spread ominously, forming black and white
airs out of her body. They began to spin together, forming the
structure of a substance chain.</p>
<p>“She’s forcing her nine tiers to become one. She is becoming
half-deified right now!” The realization rolled through the arena
like a thunderclap.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>As everyone reeled from the shock, Exquisite’s black and white
air exploded. Black geno armor appeared and encased her whole body.
Her face was shielded, too. Only her Very High Eye could be seen.
As this happened, her Very High Eye turned pure white. It was like
a small nuclear reactor, and a scary power was emerging.</p>
<p>At this same moment, Exquisite’s presence was being pushed to a
level that others couldn’t imagine. She was like a scary monster
queen, and she used her third eye to look icily at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Exquisite turned to Han Sen and raised her hand. She made a
pulling motion. She didn’t seem to release any power, but the whole
of space shifted. It was as if the space between the two fighters
had been severely reduced. Instantly, Han Sen’s body was pulled
directly in front of Exquisite’s hands. Exquisite grabbed him by
the neck.</p>
<p>“No one can beat me in my universe!” Exquisite used the white
flame in her third eye to look at Han Sen while she spoke.</p>
<p>After that, Exquisite grabbed Han Sen by the neck. Her body
began to generate a frightening black and white power. It felt as
if all the power in the universe was draining into her hands. If
she even twitched, she would surely break Han Sen’s neck.</p>
<p>“Now I will give you the chance to concede,” Exquisitely said to
Han Sen as she looked at him. Her face looked like it had been
carved from marble. Her voice was a dead monotone, like the
grinding of a machine. It was as if she would be happy to turn Han
Sen’s body to dust if he failed to agree.</p>
<p>“I still prefer it when you smile. This look doesn’t suit you,”
Han Sen said, frowning slightly at Exquisite.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you to concede!” Exquisite thundered. Her black and
white air rose madly like two ravenous demons. It was like they
were going to ravage Han Sen’s body and consume him. Not even a
single bone would be left behind.</p>
<p>“No one can force me to do something I don’t think is right,”
Han Sen replied.</p>
<p>Exquisite looked at Han Sen and didn’t speak. Her face remained
entirely expressionless. The black and white powers in the air
became stronger. It looked as if they were on the verge of
exploding any second.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace students looked at Han Sen with worry. Yun Suyi
fidgeted nervously with the hem of her dress. Her nails almost
shredded her garments, and she was starting to sweat.</p>
<p>“Should we…” The woman looked at Sky Palace Leader.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader shook his head. “Wait a bit longer.”</p>
<p>As he watched Exquisite rage, Han Sen wasn’t mad. He just felt
sorry for her.</p>
<p>She had given up her emotions so she could become one with the
universe. To put it nicely, it was like the Sky and humans had
combined. To be frank, though, it was more like she had become a
pawn of the universe. She had thrown away her identity to become a
high-class creature.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen people experience similar changes before in Sky
Palace, but that had been very different from what he was seeing
now. When the Sky became one with the sky, they focused a lot more
on their emotions. It wasn’t like the Very High, who only cared
about being one with the universe.</p>
<p>“If the Very High ever became 100% united with the universe,
would they still count as individual people?” Han Sen shook his
head. There were many things he was unsure of, but he knew for
certain that he never wanted that future. He couldn’t take this
path.</p>
<p>Exquisite stood in front of him, and her power raged higher and
higher. Han Sen laid his hand against the fist that Exquisite was
using to squeeze his neck. She lost her grip on Han Sen’s
throat.</p>
<p>The white light in Exquisite’s eyes spilled over. Her black and
white airs erupted like a volcano. Her other hand flew toward Han
Sen like a bullet.</p>
<p>Her black and white air was generating a substance chain on that
fist. That fist was so strong that every face in Sky Palace
changed. Yun Suyi was so nervous that it felt like her heart was
going to leap out of her chest at any moment.</p>
<p>The two fighters were at very close range, and the power that
Exquisite wielded was frightening. If Han Sen got punched, his body
would be destroyed.</p>
<p>The next second, however, the crowd noticed that Han Sen’s hands
were moving as well. He grabbed Exquisite’s fist, and then, both of
her hands fell under Han Sen’s control.</p>
<p>That scary black and white air began to shred Han Sen’s hands.
Deep grooves were torn into Han Sen’s Spell armor. Blood came
gushing out from the lacerations.</p>
<p>The scary black and white air stormed through the arena. Han Sen
was at the center of the storm, with his armor taking the brunt of
it. Wounds kept appearing across his body.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? Against another of the same level, I am
king. The only things that can fall to a king are smiles and a
woman’s beauty. Using force against me just won’t do,” Han Sen
said. Then, he tightened his fists with new strength. He threw
Exquisite’s black and white air-surrounded body away.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved with the arc of her toss. He swung his fists like
a hurricane.</p>
<p>Beneath the force of Han Sen’s blows, the black and white air
was waning. Han Sen’s punches pummeled Exquisite’s black armor.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>The collision of fists against armor produced sharp, striking
noises. They were so fast, there was hardly a break between each
sound.</p>
