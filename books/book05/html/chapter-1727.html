<p>A train’s horn cracked the air, while powerful aircraft flew
through the sky above.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a little confused when it came to Kate technology.
You could see old steam trains, but you could also see
nuclear-fueled aircraft. Some people even rode creatures on the
street.</p>
<p>It was bewildering to witness the great mix of technology that
co-existed.</p>
<p>Han Sen scoured the internet to learn more about Kate’s history.
He knew Kate wasn’t very well-developed because they had been
invaded a few times, and much of their technology was leftover from
other cultures. That was one of the primary factors that
contributed to the mix of different technologies.</p>
<p>The Kate people had only had their liberty for a few dozen
years. It wasn’t too long ago that they had been ruled by
outsiders.</p>
<p>Qiao’s red ladybug car came to a stop before the abandoned
factory. Qiao and Lan Se’s faces darkened.</p>
<p>A big truck was parked in front of the factory, and a few
aircraft circled the airspace. It looked like someone had beaten
them there.</p>
<p>“It’s Black Gold Group.” Qiao saw the symbol on the truck and
frowned.</p>
<p>Lan Se frowned and said, “Weird. Why are they here? No one else
should know, except for the members of security.”</p>
<p>Qiao looked disappointed and said, “With Black Gold’s power,
it’s not a surprise they can grab information like this.”</p>
<p>As they discussed this, two people dismounted an armored truck
and approached them.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed that the approaching figures weren’t strangers.
It was Hardman and his secretary, Lena.</p>
<p>Hardman walked to the car and knocked on the window.</p>
<p>Qiao rolled the windows down, and with a smug and boastful face,
Hardman immediately said, “Qiao, are you interested in the
xenogeneic here? It is a shame you are late.”</p>
<p>After that, Hardman glanced at Han Sen but did not say
anything.</p>
<p>“It looks like you haven’t got what you came for, though. That
means it isn’t too late. Sorry, we’re in a rush. Can’t talk.” Qiao
started up the car and drove past the truck.</p>
<p>Hardman didn’t try to stop them. He just looked at the car and
laughed. “They are for real! Qiao really thinks that Han Sen has
what it takes to kill a xenogeneic?”</p>
<p>“Like she said; they are in a rush. Desperate people will do
anything.” Lena laughed, too.</p>
<p>Hardman shook his head and returned to the armored truck. Guris
was inside commanding the operation.</p>
<p>Lan Se observed the soldiers situated all around, and her heart
sank. “It looks like we won’t have the slightest chance. Black Gold
employs far too many soldiers. He’ll find it before we will.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they won’t, and maybe it’s a good thing.” Qiao’s eyes
went bright, and she sped up. “Sit tight. We are going to find the
xenogeneic.”</p>
<p>The car kicked up dust while speeding ahead.</p>
<p>“How does Qiao know where to go?” Lena asked in surprise. She
watched the car through Black Gold’s cameras.</p>
<p>“Qiao is a smart woman. Although I tried to position my soldiers
to mislead her, she still found it. They used us to find the
xenogeneic,” Guris said.</p>
<p>Hardman said coldly, “It’s fine. Let them go first. Tell Mister
Tiger to wait outside instead of going in.”</p>
<p>Guris frowned and said, “Manager Hard, it would be great to get
an easy kill. But Qiao and Han Sen aren’t a threat that we should
take simply.”</p>
<p>“Commander Guris, you worry too much. Even if we gave them the
xenogeneic on a platter, they wouldn’t be able to kill it. Let them
be our pawns to lure out this xenogeneic. It is better not to
sacrifice our own soldiers,” Lena said.</p>
<p>“Do what I say. With Mister Tiger here, the xenogeneic will not
reveal itself. It is better to let them die than our soldiers,”
Hardman said.</p>
<p>Guris did not respond any further. He relayed the plan to the
team and Mister Tiger.</p>
<p>“Qiao, are you certain this is the way? The people of Black Gold
aren’t over here.” Lan Se scanned the surroundings quickly.</p>
<p>“It must be here. Their little sham isn’t fooling me.” Qiao also
looked around, while picking up even more speed. The car was
leaving huge clouds of dust behind them.</p>
<p>Aside from the abandoned factories in the area, there was a
closed mine. They drove the car inside.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>They had only just driven in when a loud noise sounded above
them. The ceiling was caving in, almost crushing the back of the
car.</p>
<p>Qiao and Lan Se were in the front of the car. They pushed their
doors open and scrambled out. They looked up and saw a
silver-haired, three-meter tall ape dropping down on the roof of
the car. It jumped up and down repeatedly, crushing the ladybug
car. The fuel tank eventually ruptured and exploded, but the
explosion didn’t even singe the beast’s fur.</p>
<p>Qiao and Lan Se were incredibly worried about Han Sen, because
he was still in the back of the car. And amidst the attack, they
had no idea what had happened to him.</p>
<p>“Good stomping. Let Mister Tiger strike!” Hardman had watched
what occurred through a drone’s camera. He was laughing his head
off.</p>
<p>“Mister Tiger, we have a lock on the target. You can go now!”
Guris told Mister Tiger.</p>
<p>They confirmed the big, silver ape was inside the mine. A few
soldiers had gone there previously to scope the place out, but all
contact with them had been lost. They had yet to be found.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen had done them a favor by luring the xenogeneic into
action. And now that it was in their sights, Mister Tiger was
running over. He was only a mile away.</p>
<p>Hardman was still laughing, watching the battlefield. He loved
nothing more than taking advantage of the work of others.</p>
<p>Qiao and Lan Se then saw Han Sen exit what was left of the car.
That brought them a feeling of safety. Seeing him emerge in one
piece was quite relieving</p>
<p>The silver ape saw Han Sen and grabbed hold of the wreckage of
the car. He threw it at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved quickly, evading the car. The car flipped end over
end until it was stopped by a warehouse, which promptly
collapsed.</p>
<p>The silver ape roared and jumped towards Han Sen with blinding
speed.</p>
<p>Han Sen went forward, going right for the ape. His eyes were
calm like well water.</p>
<p>The Rhino Horn Dagger was in his hand, but he didn’t unsheathe
it His right hand grasped the handle as he went for the ape.</p>
<p>“Kid, this is my prey!” Mister Tiger was already in the mine,
sounding excited.</p>
