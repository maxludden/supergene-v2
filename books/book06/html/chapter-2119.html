<p>“It is no wonder that the Dragon are considered the bravest in
the world. With an attack power like this, they do not have to fear
anyone on the same level,” Han Sen complimented his opponent.</p>
<p>His power wasn’t as great as Dragon Eight’s. Jadeskin made his
body sturdier, but when it leveled up to Marquise, it gave him some
ice powers, too. The evolution wasn’t entirely focused on making
his body sturdier, so when compared to the gold Dragon body, he was
in inferior shape.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not use Jadeskin godlights in this fight, or
people might suspect he was Han Sen. If he had been able to,
though, he’d have fared a much better chance.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight was continuously growing stronger. Han Sen was at a
vast disadvantage right now, and even the spectators were surprised
by how things were turning out.</p>
<p>“Dragon Eight is very powerful. With this much strength, felling
Dukes must be an easy feat.”</p>
<p>“The race of the Dragon is getting stronger. Dragon Eight is
only the eighth of this generation, as well! He is so strong. No
one of the same level can ever hope to beat him.”</p>
<p>“Dollar is not bad, I’ll give him that. After all, he has pushed
Dragon Eight to this point. This was the first time he has had to
make use of his gold Dragon body in a ranked fight.”</p>
<p>“Dollar is actually quite strong. He must be one of the best
Marquises in the universe. If he didn’t have the misfortune of
being pitted against Dragon Eight, he could definitely have gone
much further. I bet reaching the top ten would not be all that
difficult for him.”</p>
<p>“What a shame.”</p>
<p>“Dragons are still the strongest. With the power that they
wield, and with the addition of gold Dragon bodies, Dragon Eight
can most certainly challenge Evil Eye.”</p>
<p>“I think so. Gold Dragon body makes Dragon Eight invincible, but
adding to that, his attack power seems to know no bounds. It keeps
increasing! If his gold Dragon body is strong enough, he could very
well engage a King.”</p>
<p>“Fighting a King is a bit of an exaggeration, I think. No matter
how strong his gold Dragon body is, he cannot withstand the power
that a King wields. But if this continues, he could definitely
rival a Duke without much trouble.”</p>
<p>Inside Sky Palace, Yun Suyi, Yun Sushang, Thousand Feather
Crane, and First Day were watching the fights together.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi was shocked. “The Dragon is so powerful! I think the
bodies of the Sky might be weaker than theirs.”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane nodded and said, “As one of the ten
higher races, the Dragon are indeed stronger than we are.</p>
<p>But simple vitality isn’t our area of expertise. Battles always
boil down to one thing, and that is a fighter’s skills in combat.
But yes, this Dragon Eight is the most physically powerful. Out of
those in Sky Palace, I believe only Lone Bamboo can challenge
him.”</p>
<p>“What about Han Sen?” Yun Suyi said.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is strong, but he is not of the Sky. I am merely
comparing the Sky and the Dragon.” Thousand Feather Crane smiled at
Yun Suyi.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi blushed. “I was just saying.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know where Han Sen even is right now, anyway.” First
Day sighed.</p>
<p>After First Day spoke, Yun Suyi immediately looked depressed.
Yun Sushang said, “Didn’t Mister Dream say that Han Sen is still
alive, though? Mister Dream isn’t one to tell lies. I am sure he
will be back here soon enough.”</p>
<p>“I know he will be. It’s just a shame he could not participate
in the Geno Being Scroll,” Yun Suyi said.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw that Dragon Eight was growing stronger and stronger
without any sign of stopping. Han Sen had managed to hurt him a few
times, but after each wound, Dragon Eight’s recovery powers proved
too much. He was like new moments after every injury.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t use his Teeth powers, and even if he could, it
might not have proven able to tear the gold Dragon body to
shreds.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight was correct in what he had spoken. There was no
need for him to be afraid of anyone on the same level as him. Even
if the opponent knew about his powers beforehand, it was likely
that there was nothing they could do to beat him.</p>
<p>Han Sen could fight Dragon Eight, but he could not use many of
his powers now that he was in his Dollar persona. So, he gave up
fighting with Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>Giving up did not mean Han Sen was willing to lose, though. He
just wanted this to be over.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight was like a killing machine as he pursued Han Sen.
Han Sen couldn’t shake him, so he resolved to do something. Dragon
Eight’s fist appeared in front of him again, and he gathered up
something gold to challenge it. It was a coin, and it was aimed at
Dragon Eight’s forehead. It went for him like a bolt of
lightning.</p>
<p>At such a close distance, Dragon Eight was unable to dodge. He
wouldn’t have thought of doing that anyway, even if he had enough
time. He ignored the coin and continued coming for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen threw a punch at Dragon Eight. His fist slipped silently
through the air and was immediately repulsed. Han Sen’s body
floated up like a cloud as he was punched away.</p>
<p>Han Sen hung weightlessly in the sky, but he looked down upon
Dragon Eight calmly.</p>
<p>The coin was fixed to Dragon Eight’s forehead now. Dragon Eight
crouched and then flapped his wings, wanting to close the distance
and return to battling Han Sen up in the sky.</p>
<p>But when he flapped his dragon wings, he found himself unable to
lift off. He was still on the ground.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked, not sure what was going on. It seemed that
something was wrong with Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>It seemed like he was being held back by something, but the
Dragons’ Evilbreaker powers should have been able to remove any
ailment put upon them. Seal powers would not work on them, and that
was half the reason why they were considered invincible.</p>
<p>But right now, Dragon Eight was being suppressed by some force.
He was unable to fly, which put him in a dire position.</p>
<p>“You are too cocky! The Dragon body is definitely strong, but it
isn’t impervious to everything,” Han Sen said with certainty as he
hung in the air.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight roared, and his Dragonlight erupted like a volcano.
He grabbed the coin on his forehead and tried to rip it off. But no
matter how much Dragonlight he released, the coin was still stuck
to his forehead. It wouldn’t come off.</p>
<p>Many people saw Dragon Eight trying to remove the coin from his
forehead. Instead of attacking, Han Sen just drifted in the sky,
watching Dragon Eight struggle with the coin. No matter how much he
tried, though, the coin remained fixed to his forehead.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight was angry. He did not care about the coin. He
wanted to get Han Sen, and so he threw a punch into the</p>
<p>The Dragonlight on his fist blasted out like a volcano, but when
Dragon Eight stepped forward, his knees went soft and buckled. He
fell to his knees on the ground. When he had tried to attack Han
Sen, his body immediately buckled under the pressure.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked to see a coin suppress an elite like Dragon
Eight in such a manner. It was a skill that no one had heard of
before.</p>
