  Buzz!

Han Menger, who was next to Han Sen, fired her Death Bone. An arrow was loosed and it slew a creature that was quickly approaching. She strung her bow again as a beast from Ancient Devil’s side leaped forward with a roar. Its body was running to meet with the arrow.

That monster looked like a bull, but it was covered with green armor. Its horns glistened like golden screws. There was a horn on its nose, too, like that of a rhino.

The beast flew towards the arrow and smacked it with its head. The arrow did not hurt the beast, and it was simply knocked away.

Han Menger frowned and fired her bow again. Wherever she fired an arrow, it was pulled toward the horn of that frantic beast. Those powerful arrows generated shockwaves when they came against the horn, but no matter how many times it happened, she could not damage the tusk.

“Horn Beast Alpha is powerful. It is no wonder why he is said to have the strongest horn in the world,” Ancient Devil complimented the creature.

Other alphas also complimented the performance. They planned to let Horn Beast Alpha deal with Han Menger.

Aside from Horn Beast Alpha, no one else was confident in dealing with Han Menger’s arrows. Horn Beast Alpha’s horn was indestructible, and he had a magnetic ability that could absorb things in his proximity. It allowed him to capture Han Menger’s arrows.

Han Menger was powerful. Her strongest skill was her Empty Shot, which enabled her to shoot wherever she wanted to. Unfortunately, all the arrows were being snared by the horn and there was nothing that could be done about it.

“I will deal with Gu Qingcheng.” Elder Yin drew his sword and went towards Gu Qingcheng.

Gu Qingcheng’s eyes looked cold, and she drew out Pure. Then, she went to Yin Elder.

If Gu Qingcheng’s sword skills were overbearing, then Yin Elder’s skills were soft. The delicate nature of his sword and performance nearly made him invisible. He didn’t touch Gu Qingcheng’s attacks and moved around her like water. He was a tough target to face.

Gu Qingcheng couldn’t kill Yin Elder, and so she was trapped.

Han Sen frowned. Horn Beast Alpha and Yin Elder were stronger than Illusion Elder. They must have been the elders of larger and older tribes.

Han Sen heard a long cry come from the shelter, and it boomed and drowned out the sounds of all else.

Han Sen saw Red Pony standing upon the tallest point of Shadow Shelter. Its small neck arched proudly as it whinnied loudly.

Han Sen felt safe. With Red Pony’s sonic protection, not even the alphas would be able to get close to the shelter. Even if Ancient Devil had discovered how to break the mirror, he couldn’t do it now.

But they circumvented Han Sen’s expectations. Ancient Devil and the others did not make the shelter their target Instead, they all went for Han Sen.

Han Sen understood what they sought to do. They wanted to kill him first, so they could get the mirror easily.

Han Sen was not afraid, and he felt calm. He had been worried the mirror would end up destroyed, and so it was a bit of a relief that their first target wasn’t the item.

Han Sen summoned his Overbearing Shield. With his other hand, he summoned the Bulwark Umbrella. Ancient Devil was hard enough to deal with, but now with all the others coming, he absolutely had to have the umbrella equipped for defense.

A spirit elder came forward with a spear. The spear turned into a black dragon as it approached.

At the same time, Ancient Devil used his palm and Sacred’s leader used the cane he held. It released a golden light that was like a holy punishment to Han Sen.

A dozen alpha-class elites surrounded Han Sen, and with so much power coming down from the sky, he had nowhere to run.

Lin Feng used the power of the Ancient Sky Mirror to fight the creatures. He killed many creatures in between dying many times. Without the mirror and Little Pony, he would have been permanently dead long ago.

Creatures and spirits covered the whole of Shadow Shelter. It looked like a hellscape. There was screaming, and rivers of blood were running everywhere.

Boom!

There was an explosion in the sky. The shockwave vaporized the creatures and spirits in the vicinity of a hundred miles. Nothing was left.

In the center of the explosion, Han Sen was holding his umbrella and Overbearing Shield. His mouth was bleeding, and there were cuts running across his face.

His Overbearing Shield looked to be in a worse state, and it seemed as if it was going to snap in half.

Fighting a dozen alphas, even Han Sen’s Bulwark Umbrella and Overbearing Shield could not keep him protected. He was damaged a bit.

Han Sen did not say anything, though. When his body moved, he was headed for the alphas.

Others might have been afraid of taking on such numbers, but this was something Han Sen was good at. After he blocked a strike, he ran into a bunch of people, opening and closing his umbrella constantly. Sometimes it was used for defense, other times it was used as a weapon. Combined with his Overbearing Shield, none of the alphas were able to kill him.

Han Sen’s desire to fight was high. Blood was everywhere. Shadow Shelter and the encompassing few thousand miles became a bloody hellscape.

The mountains were breaking beneath the pressure and power. The blood was like rain as the sky turned red. Bodies were mounting and piling up outside the shelter.

Han Sen bet no gold shelter had ever survived a glorious fight like this.

Even a super shelter would be horrendously damaged by now.

Ancient Devil’s target was not the shelter, though, and Red Pony was using its sonic protection. If these had been reversed, Shadow Shelter would have been flattened. It would have been wiped off the map of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary and vanished without a trace.

Even if Shadow Shelter was destroyed, with the mirror there, they could still be safe.

“Argh, I’m dead!” A creature came running towards Cheap Sheep, and the sheep screamed. He fell to the ground with his neck broken, eyes rolling to the back of his skull, and tongue hanging out.

The creature looked surprised. Then, it went forward. But when he ran past Cheap Sheep, another Cheap Sheep appeared. Cheap Sheep summoned his horn scimitar and shoved it up the creature’s bum.

“Argh!”

The creature suddenly jumped up and screamed.
