    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      A black smoke burst from Han Sen&#8217;s body like fire. It instantly
      incinerated the icy threads that had trapped him. The Flaming Rex Spike in
      his hand was swung madly towards the remainder, burning more threads into
      steamy bygones.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Silver fox, this way!&#8221; Han Sen shouted at the silver fox, and
      it quickly returned to his shoulders. Without delay, Han Sen got back to
      swinging his rex spike with ferocity at the icy threads. He ran in front
      of the frozen man and quickly grabbed something out of his pocket. He
      turned, knocked out more of the threads, and hastily retreated in the
      direction of the bamboo forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The threads still coursed after Han Sen, and regardless of how many he
      destroyed, more and more were generated by the icy lake. They were
      endless.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blazing fire of the Flaming Rex Spike was the perfect countermeasure
      to obliterating those he could strike down. And fortunately, the Devil
      Unicorn beast soul was able to withstand the threads he could not react to
      in time. Without too much trouble, he was able to keep them at bay as he
      advanced towards the forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once he was inside the bamboo forest, the threads no longer followed, and
      the stringy, frosty hairs returned to the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s lucky I had the Devil Unicorn beast soul. Who knows what
      might have happened, had I not. Even if I summoned the little angel, I am
      unsure whether or not she could withstand those things.&#8221; Han Sen
      pondered what he had just encountered, as he had no idea what the living
      ice threads were.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked out towards the lake for a while but nothing seemed
      disturbed. Then, he lowered his head to take a look at what he was
      clutching in his hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had taken a wallet out of the man&#8217;s pockets, and it had many
      cards inside. They looked very old, too. They were much bigger than modern
      cards, and thicker. They weren&#8217;t as light as the current cards were,
      where a hundred of them could be folded together and still be really thin.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were thirty of the cards, and their thickness and number filled up
      the entire wallet.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like that man really was over a hundred years old.
      It&#8217;s possible that he spawned in a shelter somewhere in the Black
      Desert, stumbled into this place as I have, and fell prey to the icy
      threads.&#8221; Han Sen observed the cards and contemplated the identity
      and possible story of the frozen man he had found.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were old cards, and aside from some cards that belonged to a few
      interstellar banking firms, Han Sen had no idea what the majority of them
      were for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen&#8217;s pupils went smaller. He found a card which bore
      a familiar symbol.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nine-Life Cat.&#8221; Han Sen was shocked, not expecting to see
      this symbol here. That meant this man who had died near the lake may have
      been a member of their organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like that organization has been around for a long time.
      Does it really have a connection with Blood Legion?&#8221; Han Sen
      continued to examine the rest of the cards.
    </p>

    <p>Then, Han Sen&#8217;s eyes stretched wide.</p>

    <p>
      Within the cards was a working license, and on the front was something he
      saw clearly.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Secret Service, Team #7. Investigator: Qin Huaizhen&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      This working license was the exact same as a relic Han Sen once received
      after someone died. The only difference being the name.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Qin Huaizhen&#8230; could he be from the Qin family?&#8221; Han Sen
      remembered Qin Xuan once told him she had an elder who worked in the
      secret service&#8217;s seventh team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gave a strange look to the man who was sitting near the lake. If
      he was a member of the Qin family, what may have led him to die all the
      way out here?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wait a minute&#8230; is he really dead? He still has a powerful
      lifeforce swirling inside him. It&#8217;s not something you can fake, so,
      is he really dead?&#8221; Han Sen looked hopeful while staring at the man.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to know what might have happened to the seventh team. If
      that man really was an elder of the Qin family, and he was still alive,
      Han Sen was keen to finally learn the truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      With great interest, Han Sen turned his whole body towards the man on the
      lake. There was a big chance he was still alive, and cryogenic technology
      had matured quite a bit even back then. Many people went into cryogenic
      sleep to be defrosted and awoken sometime in the future. It wasn&#8217;t a
      difficult process.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it required modern technology. Straight-up freezing yourself dealt
      tremendous damage to the body, and simple defrosting rarely led to
      survival.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know if the man could survive after being defrosted. There
      were no tools readily available for him, and he&#8217;d have to bring him
      back to the Alliance if he wanted to guarantee his survival.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought it over quite a bit, but then settled on returning to the
      lake. He really wanted to know what had happened to the seventh team, and
      it looked as if this might be his best and only chance. After all, almost
      all members of the seventh team had died. Finding one of them who was
      half-alive was too good of an opportunity to let pass by.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen emerged from the bamboo forest again, and he was greeted with the
      sudden reappearance of the icy threads. But to Han Sen, who owned three
      super creatures, they could do little to stop him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen annihilated the threads and arrived at the shore of the lake
      without trouble. As he went to pick up the man, he suddenly heard the
      sound of an explosion from the waters of the lake. Amidst the soaking
      turmoil and tossed water, a jellyfish-like creature arose from the waters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under its control, the water of the lake threaded once more and viciously
      went after Han Sen. In addition to the icy threads, the jellyfish&#8217;s
      tentacles now also joined the fray.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the Flaming Rex Spike and Devil Unicorn, Han Sen was able to
      withstand and repel the icy threads well enough, but his movement was
      restricted quite a bit. After slashing a number of threads, however, a
      crystal tentacle writhed its way around Han Sen to ensnare him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt his waist drop in temperature as a strong power began to grow
      and pull him towards the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was infuriated, so he raised the rex spike to bring it down on the
      tentacle. But before he could strike, another tentacle grabbed ahold of
      his arm.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was spitting its bolts of lightning in a raging fury, doing
      its best to break the grip of the tentacles. But soon after, it too was
      grabbed. Another tentacle wrapped it up and began dragging it towards the
      water with its master.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox&#8217;s body unleashed as much silver lightning as it
      could, but still, it wasn&#8217;t enough to break the hold the tentacle
      had on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little angel!&#8221; Han Sen, unable to fight back, summoned his
      adiraid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel appeared from the sky, swooped down, and with her
      greatsword, sliced the tentacles that had grabbed ahold of the duo. The
      jellyfish creature thrashed around in pain, letting out a shrill shriek
      amidst the chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little angel, great work! Go and kill that asshole.&#8221; Han Sen
      was extremely happy, and gleefully issued the little angel the order.
      Then, he swung his rex spike towards the icy threads that had amassed and
      were coming towards him like a tidal wave.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel&#8217;s cold face was like that of a goddess. Her blonde,
      flowing hair danced around as her body broke the air with her attacks. The
      greatsword slashed countless icy threads, as if she was tearing the seas
      asunder to get at the jellyfish-like creature.
