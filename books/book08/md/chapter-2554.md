  Han Sen held Wind String, and his fingers caressed the bowstring. It shivered at his touch, like he was brushing against a dragon or a tiger.

Swords had sword souls, and bows had a spirit of their own, too. The higher level it was, the harder it was for others to make use of it. Han Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra powers to activate the treasure. He was able to make use of most treasures, but that was because most treasures didn’t already have owners. This Wind String did have a master, and even with Han Sen using his Dongxuan Area powers, it resisted. He was unable to pull the string back.

Han Sen’s fingers hooked onto that tender-looking string. Slowly, he cast his Jadeskin power. The fingers upon the string turned to ice, and the power he used became grander.

But that string still wouldn’t budge. No matter how hard Han Sen tugged at the string, it refused to be drawn. It didn’t look as if it was ever going to happen.

Autumn Wind was delighted to see this. He said, “My Wind String has a mind of its own. Not just anyone can make use of it. Why don’t you try using a different bow? I won’t mind.”

“I like my bows to be a little stubborn,” Han Sen said inscrutably.

Autumn Wind quietly said, “I don’t mind you trying, but you can’t keep these two girls waiting for too long.”

“There’s no need to wait. We can start right now. This is the first arrow,” Han Sen said. Then he pulled an arrow out of the quiver.

Han Sen felt comfortable when he held the arrow. There was a sensation that was difficult to describe. When he was in the sanctuaries, he had frequently used a bow. And he was always the best when it came to using them. When he was in the Blackhawk Military Academy, he came first place in an archery competition. Han Sen liked using bows.

But he had yet to find a bow that was strong enough in the geno universe, and when it came to ranged engagements, he could always make use of Spell’s arsenal. He rarely used bows anymore.

Even if he found a good bow beast soul, he would sooner give it to his daughter Han Meng’er.

Han Sen thought it would be a while before he had to make use of a bow again. He didn’t expect he would have a chance to use his bow in this sort of situation.

“It feels good to hold a bow again.” Han Sen sighed. He lifted the arrow, pressing it against the string of Wind String.

“What is this guy hoping to achieve? He couldn’t pull Wind String’s string, so what is the point of putting an arrow on it? Is the arrow going to launch itself?” Everyone thought what Han Sen was doing was so weird.

Everyone could tell Han Sen didn’t have enough power. He had pulled Wind String’s string twice, and it wouldn’t budge. It clearly couldn’t be drawn.

Autumn Wind put out his hands and said, “Actually, I really don’t mind you making use of a different bow.”

Han Sen ignored him. He raised the bow and the nocked arrow, and he cast Jadeskin. Then, he pulled back on Wind String’s string.

A scary power surged through Han Sen’s fingers. He tugged on the string, but it was refusing to move. Han Sen was applying too much strength, though. He pulled so hard that the string dug into his fingers until it reached his fingerbones. It completely bypassed the protection of Jadeskin.

“Don’t force it. Even a deified elite might have trouble pulling the string of Wind String,” Autumn Wind cautioned.

Han Sen didn’t heed his words. He continued to pull the string, as the power of his fingers became stronger.

“Sir, run!” While everyone’s focus was on Han Sen, a Demon was frowning at Ji Yang Sheng, who was still hitched to the rickshaw.

Ji Yang Sheng pretended not to see him, but the Demon King who had called out to him was in a hurry. He didn’t move forward to save Ji Yang Sheng, though. He was the only Demon there. The true Demon elites had yet to show up.

“What is wrong with the prince? Is he retarded? Why isn’t he running?” Demon King wondered.

Han Sen was obviously focused on the bow right now, so the Demon had no idea why Ji Yang Sheng was refusing to run while he had the chance.

The Demon kept making signals to Ji Yang Sheng, the man’s constant waving made the prince very angry. He turned his head away from the man. Inside, he was thinking, “Are you stupid? Of course, I would run if I had the chance to. I wouldn’t need a reminder from you. Han Sen is right next to me, and those two women can’t be provoked. I can’t risk trying to run away.”

The Demon saw that Ji Yang Sheng was now refusing to look his way. So, he moved around the crowd, getting back into Ji Yang Sheng’s line of sight. Once he was sure the prince could see him, he started signaling again.

Ji Yang Sheng eyebrows were lowered in a deep frown. He wanted to slap that brain-damaged Demon. He wasn’t going to run away now. If he started to run, the two women Han Sen had with him would believe he was trying to escape. It would look very bad if he was captured once again, and this time in front of a large audience.

Ji Yang Sheng ignored the idiotic Demon and closed his eyes.

Everyone could see Han Sen was using all of his strength, even though the string was digging into his flesh. He was still unable to draw the bow, and that made them happy.

“Do you really think you’re the Daddy of all Gods? Even if you were, that is a bow. You’re the God’s Daddy, not the Bow’s Daddy. Why are you insisting on wrestling with this bow?”

“His ego’s gone out of control. He experienced a big fight and is now confident he can do everything.”

“Haha! I can finally witness Han Sen make a fool of himself.”

“Wind String isn’t that easy to operate. If it was that easy, it wouldn’t belong to the Aichi.”

…

As everyone discussed the bow, Han Sen’s eyes hardened. A robe of grey feathers appeared around him, giving off a rainbow light.

The crowd of onlookers could see the rainbow glow coming from Han Sen, but they couldn’t make out the details of the robe or the symbol that had appeared on Han Sen’s back. The peacock had already spread its tail. The glory of its light surrounded Han Sen.

Once Han Sen received the peacock king’s buff, his Jadeskin fingers glowed like a rainbow. The power running through his hands surged to a truly horrifying level.

As that scary power rose through Han Sen, Wind String finally began to move. Inch by inch, the bow was being drawn. The dragon-like tendon-string was quivering madly. It made the sound of some ancient predator roaring. It sounded like a thunderstorm. People nearby thought that their eardrums were about to pop.

Everyone in the crowd felt this way. They stared, dumbfounded, as Han Sen pulled Wing String’s string back. They were too shocked to say anything.

Wind String could be drawn by force. Just like the Bona generals, who had been half-deified and focused on pure strength. With the combination of their strength, their powers reached a deified level and pulled back Wind String’s string. They had only done so once, though.

Things never turned out well for the people that forced back Wind String. There was a deified elite who once managed to pull back Wind String’s string. After forcing it to obey his will, extremely bad luck fell upon him.

Everyone could now see that Han Sen had managed to draw Wind String. As much as they were shocked, they were really happy about this.

They were surprised Han Sen was able to draw Wind String, and they were excited to find out whether or not bad luck would fall upon Han Sen like the others that made use of it.
