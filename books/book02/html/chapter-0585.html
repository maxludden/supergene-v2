    <p>
      Han Sen was amazed. Seeing a creature bring its children to eat was an
      incredibly rare sight, one that few people would ever be given the honor
      of seeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the snow turtles began to dig into their food, the screech of a bird
      came out of the sky. A golden bird dropped into view. As if it had been
      searching for the turtles, it came down at an extremely high speed with
      its talons raised and ready to snatch them.
    </p>

    <p>Pop!</p>

    <p>
      Before the threatening bird reached them, the big snow turtle shot a beam
      of frost towards it. In the next second, the bird turned into a block of
      ice. From the height it fell, it hit the ground hard and shattered into
      nothing but bits and pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! It&#8217;s a super creature,&#8221; Han Sen was
      staring at the turtle with wide eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was the first time Han Sen had ever seen such a large amount of super
      creature babies all in one place. There were eight of them and now, Han
      Sen was afraid to even breathe. The last thing he wanted was for the snow
      turtle to take notice of his presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was frighteningly powerful, even as a baby. But here, there
      were eight super creature children and their mother. Woe to him if they
      thought Han Sen to be hostile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the golden bird shatter into crumbs of ice, Han Sen felt a shiver
      run down his spine. Being afraid to breathe, he gave the task over to his
      cells so he could continue watching the nine turtles eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the small turtles ate the red mushrooms, the bodies of the creatures
      started to glow red. At first, the turtles were as white as the snow
      itself. But now, they looked like blood turtles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The small turtles were really young, as their size suggested. Thus, they
      couldn&#8217;t eat much, and after eating a mushroom about the size of a
      man&#8217;s fist, they were full. But the big turtle was really hungry,
      and it ate about ten mushrooms before it turned red.
    </p>

    <p>
      It looked like the turtles were all satisfied, and when they were, the big
      turtle buried the red mushrooms beneath the snow again. Then it led the
      small turtles back to the ice cave where they had first emerged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen waited until they had all entered the cave and swam down beneath
      the water. The big turtle went in last, and before it went down deep, it
      let out another frosty beam to reseal the ice where they had come out. No
      one would have been able to tell something lived under there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen waited for a while longer, and when he confirmed there was no more
      movement, he ran to the area where the snow turtles had eaten and dug his
      way down to the red, fist-sized mushrooms.
    </p>

    <p>
      They seemed like mushrooms you would cook. They were the size of a fist,
      and they glistened with a sparkling clarity. They also emanated a lovely
      smell, and Han Sen wagered they would taste pretty good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used to follow a certain botanist, and through him, he learned
      many of the tips and tricks one could use to identify plants, herbs, and
      mushrooms. He looked at the red mushrooms and noticed there were only
      three left. The rest had already been eaten by the turtles.
    </p>

    <p>
      But judging from the way they looked, they didn&#8217;t seem poisonous.
      There were many strange plants back at the shelter that Han Sen
      wouldn&#8217;t dare eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pulled out a bag and picked a single mushroom to put inside it. He
      didn&#8217;t take any more, but he prepared to take the mushroom with him,
      thinking it might become useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      He covered the others with snow once again and summoned his Golden
      Growler. He collected and reassembled the body of the shattered bird and
      placed it upon the Golden Growler. It looked like a sacred-blood creature,
      and even if it was only a mutant, Han Sen didn&#8217;t want to waste it.
      This was free stuff that he wasn&#8217;t going to pass up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back inside the Crystal Palace, Han Sen asked Zero to cook the golden
      bird&#8217;s meat. Then, he heard the announcement, &#8220;Sacred-blood
      Golden Wing Bird flesh has been consumed. Sacred geno points obtained is
      zero.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Because he ate so little, he was unable to increase his sacred geno point
      total. But that still made Han Sen quite happy. Although he had failed to
      hunt the red-scale dragon, the free collection of a sacred-blood Golden
      Wing Bird made up for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      He ate a whole meal of the sacred-blood Golden Wing Bird, but his point
      total did not increase. There was still a lot of meat left, however, so
      Han Sen prepared it and got ready to eat it all slowly. The bird
      wasn&#8217;t that big, after all, so he figured he would be able to eat it
      all within ten days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the Alliance, Han Sen found a way he could contact Professor Sun
      Minghua. Although Professor Sun had spent his entire life in the First
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary, he had yielded incredible results for the world of
      botany, and this was something few would understand. Han Sen gave him the
      details of the red mushroom he had collected and told him about the
      turtles. He wanted the professor to find out whether or not the mushrooms
      possessed any beneficial traits that would apply to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a shame that he could not carry the mushroom out of the shelter;
      otherwise, he would have brought it for the professor to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professor Sun intently listened to Han Sen&#8217;s description of the
      mushroom and then asked a few questions. After a brief pause, he said,
      &#8220;According to what you have told me, this red mushroom sounds like
      it could be something quite powerful.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Professor Sun, is there any way you could tell me if this red
      mushroom can benefit humans?&#8221; Han Sen thought these snow turtles had
      the ability to find rare plants to eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The food that super creatures consumed had to be good stuff, but humans
      were biologically different than creatures, so Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure
      whether or not humans could eat it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The shelter&#8217;s plants have great power. They should be quite
      effective on humans, but the bodies of humans are very different. It is
      difficult to say whether the effects will benefit you or ail you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, Professor Sun stopped. He hesitated for a while, but then
      began talking to Han Sen again. &#8220;I have something to tell you. But
      after I do, I want you to forget I told you this. And I absolutely do not
      want you telling others.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Han Sen responded dubiously.</p>

    <p>
      Professor Sun then said, &#8220;In the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary, there
      are some amazing plants that can improve your genes. But still, humans
      have yet to fully uncover which are beneficial and which are harmful. The
      way such food is eaten is important, as well. If eaten incorrectly, the
      benefits you would expect to receive can instead become deadly.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought what the professor said was quite strange, and so he
      replied, &#8220;If humans cannot determine the effects a plant will
      impart, how can we find out which ones can improve a human&#8217;s
      genes?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I won&#8217;t answer this question, but after you visit the Third
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary, you will understand.&#8221; Professor Sun seemed to
      dodge Han Sen&#8217;s question, and he quickly changed the subject. He
      only told Han Sen a few simple methods he could use to help determine what
      consumption of the red mushroom might do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt curiosity swell in his heart. There were quite a few
      surpasser humans, a few hundred thousand at least. Despite this,
      information regarding the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary was quite limited.
      Surpassers never talked about it, and there was very little information
      about it to be found in the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, with Professor Sun not willing to talk about the Third God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary anymore, Han Sen&#8217;s curiosity about the place increased.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the advice Professor Sun gave him, Han Sen was going to give
      the red mushroom to another creature to try out. Maybe then he would see
      the effects it could impart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then thought to himself, &#8220;I wonder if the silver fox would
      be willing to eat it?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the Crystal Palace, Han Sen picked up the silver fox and placed
      the red mushroom in front of its mouth. He was eager to see how it would
      react.
