  A dead xenogeneic body was in the giant steel pot. It was entirely shelled and looked like a centipede. It was at the bottom of the pot.

Although the shell had been cooked, it was a bit red. The shell was a bit different from Empty Dragon King, who was black. Still, Han Sen knew for sure that it was Empty Dragon King.

Its name was Empty Dragon King, but it was not like it grew like a dragon. Its body was like a centipede. Its head was like a beetle, and its tail was like a scorpion. It had also had the wings of a dragonfly.

With that appearance, whoever saw it would never forget it. Han Sen had seen it fight. He remembered it clearly.

“Empty Dragon King’s power was the top in a true god, and it had empty elements. That enabled it to go through materials. Who is powerful enough to kill it and turn it into Numb and Spicy Dragon King?” Han Sen did not think his power was inferior to Empty Dragon King, but killing it would not have been easy.

Empty Dragon King’s power was rather like Little Star Star. It could go through all materials, and it could go through empty material space. It was a foe that was incredibly hard to deal with. Han Sen was next to the pot. He stuck his head out and carefully looked outside the pot.

He could not use power. He could not use blue blood either. He was unable to fight, and his opponent had cooked Empty Dragon King. It was best if he remained careful.

Han Sen looked around and discovered that he was in a giant cave. The stone pot he thought he had found himself in was not actually a pot. It looked like a wok.

A wok was like a legless tripod. It was a tool used to cook fish and meat in ancient times.

Now, it had been turned into a tool of torture. In the control of a violent leader, the prisoners were thrown into the wok and cooked alive.

That wok was hanging by a few large chains that were as thick as thighs. It was hanging in the cave. There was a fire on the ground below the cave. It was spitting out flames. It kept burning the big wok and boiling the water inside it. It kept releasing heat. Empty Dragon King, which was inside the wok, had been cooked red.

Fortunately, Han Sen’s body had absorbed the blue blood. It made him highly resistant to heat. The heat that could cook Empty Dragon King was unable to cook his body. It was just that the water was a bit hot. The smell of the food also kept going into his nose.

“I do not know where this pot and fire came from that it can create such heat in the pot. If I was here for a long time, I would end up being cooked just like Empty Dragon King.” Han Sen noticed the cave was empty. He wanted to climb out from the pot, but he suddenly heard someone speaking at the cave’s entrance. Someone walked into the cave.

Han Sen went back into the pot. He was half-submerged in the water. He used a large green chili to hide his body so he could eavesdrop. He heard a rough voice say, “Empty Dragon King has been cooking for so long, yet he still isn’t cooked. How long will it take to bring out all the essences of his genes?”

A person with a sharp voice, which did not sound Yin or Yang, said, “You have not been here for long. You do not know how things are here. I remember how long it took to cook the growler. It took 3.9 billion years to cook until the geno essence was cooked out. This Empty Dragon King was not as strong as the growler, but it is a top-class true god. Without 18 million years, I do not think the essence will be cooked out.”

“I say we do not have to go to such trouble,” the rough voice said. “Just cook Empty Dragon King. Isn’t that faster?”

The sharp voice rang again. “Of course not. You need to cook the whole thing slowly so that the baby god wok can cook the geno essence out completely. Therefore, the geno essence will not be damaged. That is how we cooked the xenogeneics in the past. I am afraid this time it is too late. The lady is going to be an adult. In the coming-of-age ceremony, she has to drink geno holy fluid. Before the lady has her coming-of-age ceremony, we must cook Empty Dragon King’s gene essence all

out.”

“I thought you said it takes at least 10 million years,” the rough voice said with confusion. “The lady’s coming-of-age ceremony is in two days. How are we going to cook it?” “Otherwise, why would master ask us to come here?” the sharp voice asked. “We need to make the fire stronger so it will be done before the adult ceremony. We need to get the Empty Dragon King’s essence all out.”

“I thought you said if we cook it too fast, the gene essence will be destroyed.”

“That is what would happen normally, but Master allowed me to bring this treasure. Put this in the pot and cook it together. It can speed up the cooking time, and the gene essence will still be whole. You just need to follow my instructions. When the lady has finished her adult ceremony, the master will reward us.”

When Han Sen heard that, he saw a creature in front of the pot. Han Sen could only raise his head far enough to see a part of it. He could not see anything else. The creature’s head was half the size of the pot. It looked very weird. Its face was black, and there was a giant eye on its nose. The head had a horn that blazed with green fire. It looked like a one-eyed ghost king.

Han Sen had no information about that xenogeneic, and he could not use his sense power. He did not know the xenogeneic’s level.

The xenogeneic looked into the pot. It looked like it was looking at Empty Dragon King. He saw Empty Dragon King’s shell turn red. He shook his head and said, “The shell just turned red. We must hurry up.”.

After that, the ghost king-like xenogeneic took a box out of a chest. It carefully pulled something out and placed it in the pot. It seemed to think of something and screamed, “Stop squeezing! Spit out your true Yang fire. Hurry up with the fire. We must cook all the Empty Dragon King’s gene essence out before the adult ceremony.” “It smells so nice,” the rough voice said. “I just want to take a look.”

“What are you looking at? If your saliva drops in there, you will ruin the lady’s holy geno fluid. If we do that, we will not be permitted to live. Hurry up with your work!” Han Sen watched them argue. He did not listen. He looked at the thing that had been thrown into the pot and was shocked. The xenogeneic in the pot was a newborn baby. It looked like a human baby. It was a fat human baby.

The baby was in the pot. The boiling water in the pot made it loudly cry. The baby’s meaty little hands and legs were being burned red. It kept splashing the water.
