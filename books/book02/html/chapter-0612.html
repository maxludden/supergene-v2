    <p>
      &#8220;This blood-scale armor is mine, okay? Now we are even.&#8221; Queen
      frowned, looking back at the island. There was no more screaming or
      squealing to be heard, and with the rest of the creatures having either
      escaped or been killed, the island was quiet.
    </p>

    <p>
      It still looked like hell, though. Bodies and blood were everywhere, and
      just looking at it made their skin crawl.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you think you might be able to take down those wasps?&#8221;
      Queen asked Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew what she meant, but he shook his head and told her, &#8220;My
      speed is still a little too slow to go up against those wasps. I may know
      its weak spot, but what&#8217;s the point if I cannot hit it?
      Besides&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Besides what?&#8221; Queen looked at Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is no guarantee I can kill it, even if I hit there. For all I
      know, I might only inflict a minor amount of damage.&#8221; Han Sen did
      not overestimate his talents.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he fought Golden Growler, he couldn&#8217;t even break its eyes. The
      wasp&#8217;s waist may have been its weak spot, but it couldn&#8217;t be
      weaker than those eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A weak spot was just a place on a monster that was weaker. But the overall
      fitness of a super creature was just too high, and so the fact that it had
      a weak spot didn&#8217;t mean much for Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen sighed. She understood how he was feeling. There were eighteen of
      those wasps, and they had a lot of trouble escaping just one. It would be
      impossible to survive an encounter with any more, not to mention if all
      eighteen came after them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Few people could dodge their attacks like Han Sen had. Even Queen
      wasn&#8217;t entirely sure whether or not she&#8217;d be able to keep up
      and evade such quick attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The island was dead. They watched it for a while but knew that there was
      no hope of returning there. They readied themselves to leave and take to
      the seas on the whale again.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then the silver fox jumped out of Han Sen&#8217;s arms. It became a
      silver light and ran back to the island.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Silver fox?! What are you doing?&#8221; Han Sen was startled. It
      hadn&#8217;t been easy to escape the island, so why was the fox now
      deciding to return?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Stop! The eighteen wasps must be together by now. If we get in
      trouble with all of them, we&#8217;ll never make it out again,&#8221;
      Queen said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;You wait here. I&#8217;ll go back and get him.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen rushed back ashore without hesitation. He wasn&#8217;t planning to
      risk his life for the silver fox, but he understood the silver fox well.
      He knew that it wouldn&#8217;t want to risk its own life, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Otherwise, when Han Sen was battling the wasps, the silver fox
      wouldn&#8217;t have jumped into his arms to escape. It wouldn&#8217;t have
      waited this long to come back, if it had no regard for its life. Something
      must have changed on the island, then.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen chased after the silver fox, and noticed he was being led back to
      the lotus. Still, he did not hesitate and quickly continued his pursuit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, using his senses, noticed there were no longer any wasps on the
      island.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did those wasps leave the island?&#8221; Han Sen asked himself,
      looking puzzled.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was still curious. If the wasps had left the island, then that
      meant the lotus plant was nothing special, and it had just been used to
      host a number of wasp eggs. If there was nothing extraordinary about the
      plant, why were they returning?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is there something the silver fox wants from the body of a deceased
      creature?&#8221; Han Sen wondered, having now reached the lotus hill with
      the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scenery was marred with great horrors. Uncaring for the bodies that
      littered the once-fertile green, Han Sen hastily climbed up to the lotus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps it was because of the strength of their toxins, but after the
      wasps were born, the seven remaining lotus petals had wilted. All that
      remained was a sole lotus cup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without a moment&#8217;s pause, the silver fox ran up to it and munched it
      all down in one bite.
    </p>

    <p>The crystal-clear lotus cup was chewed to pieces by the fox.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Save me some! Save me some!&#8221; Han Sen grabbed the silver fox
      as he tried to pry open its mouth. Alas, the silver fox had already
      swallowed it all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Damn it, you mutt. You are too cruel. I just saved your life
      earlier! You little selfish bastard, you didn&#8217;t even save me a
      bite!&#8221; Han Sen yelled at the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox, however, ignored its master. Elegantly, it sniffed around
      on the ground, and after a while of doing so, began digging into the rocky
      ground with its two front paws.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rock surface was like tofu under the power of its paws and claws, and
      it wasn&#8217;t long before it had managed to dig a two-meter-deep hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is there something down there?&#8221; Han Sen quelled his rage, and
      his eyes lit up with inquisitiveness. He saw that there was something
      connected with the stalk of the lotus plant. As the silver fox continued
      to dig, Han Sen noticed the unearthing of something white in color.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whatever it is, you&#8217;ve done your bit. You&#8217;ve earned
      yourself a rest; let me take over.&#8221; Han Sen quickly jumped into the
      hole and placed the silver fox on his shoulder. He rabidly started digging
      with his own two hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was afraid the silver fox would dig out some more food and gobble it
      all up without giving him a chance to even look at it. He didn&#8217;t
      want a repeat of what had just happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not dig for long because he had soon excavated three lotus
      roots. They were like the arms of a baby, and they were each about a dozen
      centimeters long.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although they were underground, they still shone like white crystals. It
      was as if they were made from virgin snow. They smelled very good, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen picked up the three lotus roots to take a closer look, but before
      he could, the silver fox on his shoulder jumped down and grabbed one of
      the three. Immediately, it began to ravenously chew the root.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How could I forget about this guy? This thing is a sneaky
      manipulator. I really do keep forgetting.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was
      bleeding. He didn&#8217;t even know what treasure he had unearthed, and a
      third of it was already munched on by the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s left is mine. You&#8217;ve already had your
      fill.&#8221; Seeing the silver fox stare at the lotus roots intently, Han
      Sen clutched the remaining two tightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox went near Han Sen&#8217;s foot and began rubbing its head
      against him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t even bother trying to act cute. This thing is mine; end
      of story.&#8221; Han Sen quickly put away the lotus roots and picked the
      silver fox back up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen had now come ashore and was nearing the hill. Han Sen quickly ran
      back down to meet her, with the silver fox in hand. He didn&#8217;t want
      her to learn anything about what he had just found.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where the wasps went, but it looks like they
      have all gone,&#8221; Han Sen said, as he stood in front of Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What did it find?&#8221; Queen asked, seeing right through Han
      Sen&#8217;s deception.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It was the lotus cup. But, by the time I caught up to the fiend, it
      had already eaten everything. He didn&#8217;t save me any, so I have no
      idea what benefits it could have provided us. His selfishness
      hurts!&#8221; Han Sen hoped to squeeze out a few tears, but he
      couldn&#8217;t.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen&#8217;s eyes were untrusting, but she didn&#8217;t voice her
      concern. Shortly after, they returned to the oceanside.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two people and the fox began their journey once more. They hoped
      they&#8217;d soon be able to find land but after another five days travel,
      they had yet to see anything. There weren&#8217;t even any islands around.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, a strange sound could be heard in the distance. Han Sen and
      Queen were familiar with the sound, and so their faces changed.
