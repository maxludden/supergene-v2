    <p>
      The last time Han Sen saw Sonic-Thunder Punch, he fancied buying it. But
      back then, he was browsing for skills to be used by his other-self,
      Dollar. Therefore, he ended up buying Elephant-Disc Punch.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time, Han Sen was free to buy Sonic-Thunder Punch as himself, from
      the Saint Hall. Having done so, he was keen to start into its practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen read Sonic-Thunder Punch&#8217;s instructions and realized that it
      primarily dealt damage using thunder elemental power. In the instructions,
      however, it was noted that you could increase its potential by fusing the
      thunder with the sonic element.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people could only manage to possess and wield one elemental power.
      The most talented evolvers had been known to possess two different
      elements, but Han Sen had never seen the combination of thunder and sonic
      used before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could simulate the silver fox&#8217;s thunder powers and Death
      Knell&#8217;s sonic power, so there was nothing stopping him from giving
      it a try. With those two elemental powers combined as a base for his
      Sonic-Thunder Punch, Han Sen had high expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      After buying the skill and its geno solution, Han Sen didn&#8217;t
      hesitate to swallow it all the first chance he got. He simulated the
      silver fox&#8217;s thunder element and got right into practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had spent half the day training, and his body was already
      beginning to hum with static. When he swung his fists, crackles and sparks
      of electricity popped and twitched.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the thunder power remained in his body; he couldn&#8217;t fire it out
      like a projectile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the next eight days, Han Sen madly practiced Sonic-Thunder Punch in
      the Yellowstone City. Using the thunder element as a base, it only took
      three days for him to fully complete the skill&#8217;s learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it would be pointless to use Sonic-Thunder Punch as it was. Its raw
      power was similar to Elephant-Disc Punch&#8217;s power, and therefore
      would not be enough to damage the fairy.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen simulated his sonic and thunder power, however, a problem
      arose. When Han Sen cast both elements, he found it difficult to combine
      them into the Sonic-Thunder Punch he was aiming for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could use his thunder element to cast Sonic-Thunder Punch, and he
      could use his sonic powers to cast Sonic-Thunder Punch, with each adhering
      to its respective element and qualities.
    </p>

    <p>
      But despite how many times he tried, Han Sen could not come to grips with
      casting Sonic-Thunder Punch under the fusion of both the thunder and sonic
      elements.
    </p>

    <p>Trying to find the right measurements and balance was difficult.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his little angel and practiced it with her, hoping he
      could gain enough experience to improve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei was bored, as she sat on the bench in the plaza. Each and every
      day, all there was to entertain her eyes was Han Sen practicing and
      training his skills with the little angel. She did not understand why Han
      Sen still required so much practice, despite his already incredible
      strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      She really wanted Han Sen to show her a way out, as he would sneak back to
      the Alliance on his own frequently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei had requested this many times, to no avail. Han Sen&#8217;s
      method of returning to the Alliance, however, was simple. Every time he
      wanted to go back, he would summon his little angel and get her to
      restrain the spirit in the spirit hall. While it was busy, Han Sen could
      just run on through the teleporter.
    </p>

    <p>
      And despite her repeated pleading, Han Sen refused to bring her with him.
      Every time he returned, he did so in possession of an abundance of snacks.
      They weren&#8217;t gifts for her, though. In fact, they were the opposite.
      For a very high price, he would sell her these snacks, and the amount
      would be written down as a debt on her contract like a tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What a horrible man!&#8221; Zhou Yumei munched on the snacks she
      was helpless to refuse, as she watched Han Sen and the little angel with
      scorn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, a large clap of thunder sounded. Han Sen&#8217;s fist cast
      lightning like a silver sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wrecking fist was driven into a one meter wide and one meter thick
      pillar. It was annihilated.
    </p>

    <p>
      An aftershock followed the terrifying punch, which rattled Zhou Yumei into
      dropping her snacks all over the floor. Her ears rang and her energy felt
      disturbed. She fell on the floor, spitting out blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      It took a while for her to stand back up, and she could only do so when
      her energy started returning to normal and the sound had dissipated. She
      looked at Han Sen, who was staring at his own fist in surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sonic-Thunder Punch, eh? It looks like I&#8217;ve finally gotten
      the hang of it. The combination of sonic and thunder really is quite
      fierce. Increased damage aside, it seems I can even disturb the energy
      flow of my opponents. This punch is almost as powerful as Elephant-Rex
      Strike.&#8221; Han Sen was overjoyed. After his constant practice, he had
      finally completed his training of Sonic-Thunder Punch.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was one negative, however; the punch drained all his power. It cost
      even more than Elephant-Rex Strike. Despite his Jade-Sun Force&#8217;s
      constant replenishment of energy, he still had a shortage.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this did little to hamper his excitement. If that punch could disturb
      the little fairy&#8217;s energy flow, then it&#8217;d open her up for a
      savage onslaught by the little angel. With a side of luck, that&#8217;d be
      enough to overcome her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took a break. He still wanted to practice some more, but for the
      time being, he&#8217;d have to wait for his energy to return.
    </p>

    <p>
      He only succeeded in performing his desired strike once. It was too dicey
      to go out there now, expecting his next try to be a success, too. He had
      to ensure, no matter how much time it took, that he had perfected the
      casting of Sonic-Thunder Punch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei sat atop a stone tower, watching Han Sen practice from a
      distance. After what happened last time, she didn&#8217;t want to sit too
      close to where he was training.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen did not talk to her much, and he wasn&#8217;t nice
      whenever he did, she cherished the company she had. She was delighted to
      no longer be all alone in this desert city.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had the suspicion that the man was obsessed with combat. It dampened
      her spirits somewhat, and she hoped that he could take a time-out every
      now and then to spend time with her, or at least to talk a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously, Han Sen was more interested in practicing a fighting skill than
      interacting with her. He practiced the skill every day, and only spoke
      with her briefly during his breaks. Yet those small snippets of
      conversation were the happiest, brightest moments of her day.
    </p>

    <p>
      This man was able to take her worries and throw them away, but at the same
      time, he could also make her sad.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, she had noticed that his ring finger was no longer naked—he had
      a ring on. Seeing this made her upset.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, another loud thunderbolt broke the skies. Even though she was
      sitting a good distance away, she still had to throw her hands over her
      ears as the energy inside her body succumbed to turmoil.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the loud noise, Zhou Yumei immediately ran down to him. She knew
      every time Han Sen cast that punch, he&#8217;d be in need of a lengthy
      break.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hey! So, what sort of skill are you learning? It looks kinda lame,
      doesn&#8217;t it? What does it do, give people a jump scare? How about you
      let me teach you some real skills?&#8221; Zhou Yumei ran straight to Han
      Sen and spoke in a prideful tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen smiled at her but did not say anything. The woman was already in
      her twenties, but her personality hadn&#8217;t quite caught up yet; she
      was a bit childish, he thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Zhou Yumei like that, Han Sen had a flashback to his days as a
      child. He remembered when he once bullied a girl, all because he fancied
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m good, thank you. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have the
      time to practice your real skills,&#8221; Han Sen coldly said. He could
      cast Sonic-Thunder Punch perfectly by now, and once his energy had
      recovered this time, he would be off. He was going to attempt his next
      fight against the fairy.
