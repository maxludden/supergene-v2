<p>“God Hall Leader, who is this Human King?” Light Goddess asked
with shock. “He can absorb Qin Xiu’s soul and body.”</p>
<p>It was not only Light Goddess feeling this way. Many of the
other Annihilation-class main gods were in shock as well. When Qin
Xiu faced Human King, he looked defenseless.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader looked at Human King complicatedly. He
eventually said, “There is no need to be so surprised. Human King
is basically another Qin Xiu.”</p>
<p>“What makes you say that?” Light Goddess was shocked by this.
She did not understand what God Hall Leader was trying to say.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader went on to say, “Back in the day, when Qin Xiu
entered the geno universe, he had the protection of the Witch. That
is what allowed him to live, persevere, and thrive. He grew up and
went on to create Sacred and become its leader. At that time, his
power still never reached the heights of what it needed to be.
Despite that, he went as far as he was able to. So, he gave up his
body. He gave his body to the self-gene race World King God, and he
put his soul into the God Chaos Party Leader’s geno prototype
armor. He wanted to control the geno prototype armor. He wanted to
use his power to help his spirit body reboot and later go on to
recover his body.”</p>
<p>After retreating into thought for a moment, Light Goddess
proceeded to ask, “Are you saying that Human King has Qin Xiu’s
World King God? In the geno universe battle, World King God, who
had Qin Xiu’s body, was slain. Before World King God died, he sent
Han Sen and Wan’er to the universe of kingdoms. The 33 skies had
not opened at that time, but he ripped open a space barrier. Even
World King God died for it.”</p>
<p>“Yes. World King God is dead,” God Hall Leader said. “Qin Xiu
killed him, but don’t forget that the humans in the sanctuaries
have World King God’s and Qin Xiu’s blood.”</p>
<p>“We know that already,” Light Goddess said. “It was after the
crystallizers destroyed Sacred that they took the gene prototype
from Sacred and combined it with their own crystallizer blood. It
led to mixed humans being created in the sanctuaries and later
populating it. Humans like that have World King God’s and Qin Xiu’s
blood. Because of the crystallizer’s testing, it was not the sole
result of World King God’s work. So, it was all considered an
accident. Like Han Sen and the others, having World King God’s and
Qin Xiu’s blood was weak and unneeded. That sort of blood would not
be in Qin Xiu’s actual children.”</p>
<p>“I will have to admit that if they were bred naturally, it may
not seem as if it is something that you could deem to be possible,”
God Hall Leader said. “From what I know about all of this
riff-raff, the sanctuaries were the original birthplace of what we
came to know as Blood Legion. They practiced Blood-Pulse skills to
refine their Blood-Pulses through the generations. You saw those
geno arts. In Han Sen’s and World King God’s fight, that geno art
was what they used.”</p>
<p>“Really? If God Hall Leader knows all of this, why did you not
put an end to it?” Light Goddess looked confused.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader shook his head. “We are God Spirits, but we are
not gods that know all. I knew about the existence of the
Blood-Pulse Sutra, but the Blood-Pulse Sutra I saw was only able to
refine World King God’s blood. After many generations, Qin Xiu’s
genes have become thin. I never thought this Human King was still
around. That was way too hard for my imagination to handle. He
refined World King God’s blood to the max. I do not know what he
used to accomplish that, but he reversed Qin Xiu’s genes.”</p>
<p>“In that case, this Human King is a combination of World King
God and Qin Xiu,” Light Goddess said with a frown. “Even so, he
should not be able to defeat Qin Xiu. After all, Qin Xiu has the
geno prototype armor and reached Reboot class. That is not
something Qin Xiu and World King God can do.”</p>
<p>God Hall Leader looked at Human King strangely. “That is what is
so scary about Human King. He made his body possess the genes of
World King God and Qin Xiu. He also did something scary to his
body.”</p>
<p>After pausing, God Hall Leader went on to say, “If ordinary
people had Human King’s body now, they would just produce another
Qin Xiu. But this person used the flaws in Qin Xiu’s genes. He
identified what the wretched things were and exploited them all for
his own gain. It is because of this that he was able to take
advantage of the flaws and use them to consume Qin Xiu’s soul and
body.”</p>
<p>“How has he done something like that?” Light Goddess did not
understand.</p>
<p>“It is very simple,” God Hall Leader said. “His body is Qin
Xiu’s body. In this world, no other person has a body that is
similar to Human King and Qin Xiu. Qin Xiu gave up his body. He
adopted a spirit body and entered the geno prototype armor.
Although he has reached Reboot class, he has not been able to use
his reboot powers to get his body back. But that is just a product
of the rebooting powers. It is not like his original body.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the soul meter of Qin Xiu’s current body is
not as good as the one in Human King’s body?” Light Goddess asked.
“So, Human King just needs to touch Qin Xiu’s body, and Qin Xiu’s
soul will feel his body. The soul will then be attracted to Human
King’s body.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is precisely right,” God Hall Leader said with a
sigh. “Only Human King can do something like this. His body is
closer to the real Qin Xiu, so the prototype armor will think he is
the proper Qin Xiu. It will not help the real Qin Xiu attack him.
Thus, Qin Xiu cannot do anything against Human King. He is only
allowing his soul to be taken by Human King. This Human King is
smart. His Blood-Pulse Sutra can consume the blood of someone. If
this is to continue, it will not only be the soul but also the body
he has just gotten will be consumed by Human King.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a good thing, though?” Light Goddess asked. “If Qin
Xiu is absorbed by Human King, Qin Xiu will be dead. If he is dead,
we do not have to worry about Qin Xiu rebooting the whole
universe.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.” God Hall Leader did not agree with Light Goddess.</p>
<p>Moment God, who was on the side, said, “Maybe not. This Human
King has always had scary powers, but he never outright shows them.
He never truly has. After all these years, he has finally been able
to come face to face with Qin Xiu. In an instant, he has been able
to take everything. He has waited an awfully long amount of time
for this reward. He has been very patient. That virtue has now
bestowed upon him a great reward. I reckon this Human King is
scarier than Qin Xiu. We don’t even know what his ultimate goal is.
What if his aim is crazier than Qin Xiu’s?”</p>
<p>When Light Goddess heard all this, she looked at God Hall
Leader. She asked, “Mister Leader, is that what you are worried
about?”</p>
<p>God Hall Leader said, “This is not what I am worried about. I am
merely worried.”</p>
<p>Light Goddess spoke faster than her heart and asked, “What are
you worrying about?”</p>
<p>God Hall Leader said, “Mister God rebooted the Blood-Pulse and
God Chaos Party Leader’s geno prototype armor. These two items are
things with an extreme amount of power. Qin Xiu was used by Mister
God and the God Chaos Party Leader. That was how he combined them,
but it was never perfect. There was always still a flaw. I am
worried that if Human King absorbs Qin Xiu’s body and soul…”</p>
<p>God Hall Leader stopped speaking, but all the God Spirits knew
what he meant. When they thought about the consequences, they felt
a chill run down their spines.</p>
