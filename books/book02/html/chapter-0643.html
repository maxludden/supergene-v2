    <p>
      The creature looked like a tyrannosaurus rex. It had leathery red scales
      shielding its entire body, and four wings wreathed in fire. A spiral horn
      protruded from its head, and fire writhed out of its nose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its eyes, as big as wagon wheels, had licks of flame inside the pupils,
      and it stared at Han Sen and Wang Yuhang. It breathed out smoke from its
      mouth, which looked like the gaping maw of a volcano.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Split up. You go left, I go right,&#8221; Han Sen quickly shouted,
      before dashing off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature was intimidatingly large. Han Sen thought to draw his
      crossbow and fire a bolt, but even if it pierced the fiend&#8217;s thick
      scales, he feared it would only hit it with the power of a toothpick.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang heard what he was told and ran off to the left. He heard the
      creature roar, and a geyser of fire shot out from its mouth. It engulfed
      the spirit hall in fire, and the structure immediately began collapsing
      under the scorching heat.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The creature that looked like a T-rex immediately took off after Wang
      Yuhang. Not wanting to be dinosaur chow, Wang Yuhang ran as fast as his
      legs could carry him, yelling. He looked like a pitiable fellow, with a
      T-rex gnashing at his heels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The clothes on his body were tickled by the flames that escaped the
      creature&#8217;s mouth, setting them on fire, which made Wang Yuhang begin
      calling out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was running like the wind, and he thought to himself, &#8220;You
      really are unlucky. The monster picked you, even though I approached it
      first. I didn&#8217;t mean for that to happen.&#8221; As he was talking to
      himself, Han Sen managed to exit the metal shelter and had a clear shot of
      escaping the Mystery Island.
    </p>

    <p>
      But all he could hear were the repeated screams from Wang Yuhang, who was
      continuing to be pursued by the T-rex. It didn&#8217;t seem likely he was
      going to escape without Han Sen&#8217;s intervention.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care. We only just met; I barely know the
      fellow,&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s mind stated, while his legs stood firmly,
      refusing to depart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Wang Yuhang was unlucky, he was not a bad person by any means.
      Furthermore, he was Wang Mengmeng&#8217;s uncle. Han Sen knew how guilty
      he might become, if he were to leave him behind in such a heartless
      fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But he&#8217;s so unlucky. Even if I do save his life, he&#8217;ll
      probably end up dead due to a similar misfortune sometime in the
      future.&#8221; Han Sen spoke this out, but immediately after, bit down on
      his teeth. He hissed, turned around, and ran back into the blazing
      inferno.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Wang Yuhang ran alongside him, bringing the monster with him, he
      wouldn&#8217;t have had these second thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was well aware of his own misfortune, but despite that, he
      heeded Han Sen&#8217;s instruction to run in the opposite direction,
      pulling the monster with him. He was a good, honest man.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fine. I&#8217;ll do my part, but I won&#8217;t risk any more than I
      have to, to try to save him. He&#8217;ll still have to put in the
      effort.&#8221; Han Sen drew his peacock crossbow and loaded it with a
      raven feather bolt. Then, he began to approach the rampaging monster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole Mystery Island was ablaze, and the flames that the T-rex
      breathed were enough to melt the sturdy metal structures that composed the
      shelter. It ran really fast, too. Wang Yuhang was unable to shake the
      creature, and his body had suffered a few bad burns. There were fiery
      holes in his clothes and his hair was singed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Wang Yuhang, despite his unluckiness, was a powerful warrior. Although
      he looked to be in a sorry state, he had managed to outpace the lunatic
      T-rex for a good while without suffering any injuries. He looked pitiable,
      sure, but they were minor wounds and nothing that could not be quickly
      remedied.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not a reckless person, so he wanted to survey the area and
      approach the situation in as safely as possible. He didn&#8217;t want to
      charge in like a buffoon, so he gauged the events from a good distance
      away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Observing the pursuit made Han Sen really take notice of how unlucky Wang
      Yuhang was. He didn&#8217;t know how or why the T-rex was so determined to
      catch him. It was as if it had been locked-on, and nothing seemed to sway
      its desire to incinerate the running man.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This guy excels at being a party tank. He pulls all the aggro with
      no effort!&#8221; Han Sen continued to watch from afar and sighed.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a period of observation, Han Sen could not espy any weak spots on
      the creature. Its whole body was covered in red scales, and he could
      immediately tell how difficult it would be to penetrate them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though the creature was fast, it was pretty slow in terms of super
      creatures. While the raven was unfairly fast, this T-rex was much slower
      than even the red-cloud donkey.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With this speed, there should surely be no fear of it catching up
      to me. Hmm, let&#8217;s see if I can get its attention.&#8221; Han Sen was
      standing on the rooftop of a palace in the shelter. He raised his crossbow
      and took aim at the T-rex. As soon as he had a clear shot at the
      monster&#8217;s eye, he would pull the trigger.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen fired the raven bolt across a distance of fifty meters. His aim
      was impeccable, and it seemed to be a guaranteed hit on the T-rex. But
      right before it skewered the monster&#8217;s eyeball, the creature blinked
      to shield its eye.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The bolt did go in, but the monster&#8217;s eyelid was thick. The bolt
      remained lodged in it, not dealing damage to the actual eye itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex&#8217;s eyelid did not have any scales, and it was evidently
      weaker than the rest of the body. The creature was knocked back. It roared
      in pain and looked at Han Sen from across the battlefield.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen started running, and the T-rex took off after him. He felt as if a
      giant flamethrower was pulling up behind his bottom, getting closer and
      closer. The air around him was getting hotter, and the soft fabric of his
      clothes looked ready to burst into flames.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, you are a remarkable example of a human being. Your
      charity is boundless. I almost knew it for a fact that you would not
      abandon me to the grisly maws of that ferocious monster!&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang was touched by the gesture and sung his words of praise from across
      the battleground.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not a nice man,&#8221; Han Sen responded. &#8220;See if
      you can draw its attention once more; I need to see if I can get a few
      more hits on its eye. With some luck – my luck – we can bring an end to
      this wretched thing.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is my pleasure to be of aid.&#8221; Wang Yuhang did not delay in
      his agreement to act.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen expected Wang Yuhang to summon a bow, or at least a spear to throw
      at the monster to regain its attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      But randomly, Wang Yuhang merely scrambled to pick up a piece of metal
      from the smoldering metal shelter, and threw it at the monster.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The metal piece plonked against the T-rex&#8217;s shiny red scales. The
      damage dealt equated to that of a tickle.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that was all it took to garner its attention and pull it away from Han
      Sen. The monster turned to look at Wang Yuhang and took off after him once
      more.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This way, you dumb doggie. I&#8217;m over here. Chase me; I taste
      delightful!&#8221; Wang Yuhang called at the T-rex. He even turned around,
      bent over, and mooned the T-rex, clobbering his own butt cheeks to get it
      to follow. He yelled, &#8220;Thick pork rind here; come get your free
      sample!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang&#8217;s clothes were mostly in cinders, and Han Sen could see
      much of his posterior. He danced and slapped his own bottom like a pair of
      bongos, as Han Sen simply sighed, failing to comprehend the situation in
      which he found himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked on hopelessly. He thought to himself, &#8220;Is this guy
      stupid? All he has to do is attract the T-rex; is any of that necessary?
      Can&#8217;t he just hit it and run?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex was incredibly angry, however. It roared to the sky, then
      brought down a geyser of flames on Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Half on fire, Wang Yuhang took off running like a lunatic, with the T-rex
      back on his heels.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Damn, at least it worked well.&#8221; Han Sen watched with wide
      eyes, thinking Wang Yuhang had really turned his opinion on him around.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, I beg that you hasten your move. I am being roasted
      alive!&#8221; Wang Yuhang was running as fast as he could, as his hands
      tried to pat down the flames that were incinerating his bottom.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hold on, Little Uncle.&#8221; Han Sen raised his peacock crossbow
      and took aim at the T-rex&#8217;s eye once more.
