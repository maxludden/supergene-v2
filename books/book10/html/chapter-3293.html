<p>“I do not know if Jian Bu Gu’s flower is still here.” Han Sen looked at the broken walls and flew toward them. As he got closer to the broken walls, he noticed a person sitting next to them.</p>

<p>To be more accurate, it was a skeleton. It was a skeleton just like the ruins in that it was black and charred. The skeleton’s legs were crossed. It was leaning against the wall. Its hand was in a weird position. One finger was pointing to the sky, and the others were all pointing to the ground.</p>

<p>Although the body had almost been charred into dust, it had an overbearing feeling that was exclusive to the sack of bones.</p>

<p>Han Sen said to himself, “Weird. To look at the shape of the bones, you would expect it was a human back when it was alive. I wonder why he died here. I did not hear about a human skeleton being here from Jian Bu Gu’s description of the place.”</p>

<p>This did not matter to him. Han Sen walked past the skeleton. He walked around the broken walls and the broken pillars. He kept looking around that place, but he was unable to find the flower Jian Bu Gu had described.</p>

<p>“There is no way Jian Bu Gu was able to find something I am unable to find.” Han Sen looked around and searched the place top to bottom. It was all still the same. There was nothing special to be discovered.</p>

<p>“There is an 80% to 90% chance that the flower is gone. I don’t know if someone just came along and took it, or if it was since wilted with time.” Thinking of that, Han Sen took another look at the strange, black skeleton.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is the one that took the flower.” Han Sen approached the skeleton. He wanted to pickpocket through the skeleton’s clothing and see if there was anything hidden there.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s hands ran across the skeleton. He thought his hands would go right through the being, but it felt as if he was touching something solid. His hands were able to press against the skeleton.</p>

<p>“How is that possible?” Han Sen was both shocked and happy. He held the skeleton’s arms with a tight grip.</p>

<p>“I can touch it!” Han Sen could not believe this was happening. Not even Bao’er was able to press against his spirit body, yet the skeleton could touch him. He could also touch the skeleton.</p>

<p>Han Sen excitedly reached out his hands to race them across the skeleton in search of something. He wanted to make a discovery.</p>

<p>“Why? Why am I able to touch the skeleton? What kind of power does this thing have? Is it the skeleton, or is it an item the skeleton possesses?” Han Sen’s hands kept running up and down the skeleton.</p>

<p>He was unable to find anything on the corpse. Wherever he touched, the black bones turned white.</p>

<p>The skeleton’s chest of charcoal fell out. It revealed what was hidden within the chest. It was a small, purple flower.</p>

<p>“Is that the flower Jian Bu Gu mentioned to me?” Han Sen quickly tried casting away the charcoal dust that clogged the bones of the skeleton’s chest. It made his gaze at the chest and the flower inside become clearer.</p>

<p>Soon after, Han Sen was able to spot a weird flower. It was a morning glory. The vines were growing alongside the skeleton’s spine from low to high. A small, purple flower in the skeleton’s chest.</p>

<p>The skeleton did not collapse. It was supported by the growth of that flower. Since the bones were on the flower, there was only one small, purple flower. There was no fruit around it. There were only some green vines.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought, “This flower has 13 petals on it, but it is the size of a coin. This has to be the flower that Jian Bu Gu described. Why is it growing on this skeleton? Jian Bu Gu had said it was growing by a wall and not on some strange skeleton.” He did not immediately try to touch the purple flower and its vines. He inspected the skeleton first.</p>

<p>After Han Sen touched the outside of the skeleton, the dust had almost come away. The bones were like snow-white jade crystals. They were like jade, and they were like snow.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at them for a while. He could not predict how the skeleton had died there.</p>

<p>There were no wounds on the bones, but the skeleton’s power was very weird. It had two fingers tangled around each other. It made a very weird hand signal. This gesture would have been very hard to perform after he had died.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the skeleton. There was an 80% to 90% chance that after he died there, the flower grew into his chest.</p>

<p>“Did someone come here and see the purple flower, had trouble picking it up, and died here as a result?” Han Sen moseyed around the skeleton. He did not find any clothes that proved they belonged to the skeleton.</p>

<p>“Weird. Why did he die here? Did this flower kill the poor bloke?” Han Sen frowned. He stared at it for a while, but he was unable to discern anything more.</p>

<p>The skeleton looked like it had been dead for a very long time. Jian Bu Gu had only been there 30 or 40 years ago. That skeleton did not look like it had died as recently as 30 or 40 years ago though.</p>

<p>“If the skeleton came here before Jian Bu Gu, he would have mentioned it. Did Jian Bu Gu not think it was important, so he didn’t say anything? Or did Jian Bu Gu simply not notice the presence of this skeleton?” Thinking of that, Han Sen’s eyes looked bright. “Yes, it must be like that. Jian Bu Gu did not see the skeleton. With my current condition, I cannot touch anything unless the thing is just like me, a spirit body.”</p>

<p>“Is this skeleton a spirit body too? Are there other people in this universe in my condition? No, it cannot be that much of a coincidence. Perhaps it is merely the flower itself that is playing tricks.” Han Sen did not believe there could be such a big coincidence. There was no way a spirit person went to that same place and died there.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the flower and its vine. Its leaves were green and crystal-like. The flower had 13 petals. Each of them was like purple jade.</p>

<p>There was a weird spirit power on the small flower.</p>

<p>The spirit power was very strange, but it was not strong. It was actually very weak. It was like it was there, but it was not there. It looked as if it could fade away at any given second.</p>

<p>Han Sen could not tell what was going on. He hesitated for a little while, but he eventually grabbed the skeleton’s arm. He tried to pull the skeleton away from the flower.</p>

<p>Even though he had touched the skeleton, the skeleton was no threat to him. The only thing he worried about was the flower. Therefore, Han Sen did not touch the flower.</p>

<p>The flower was wrapped around the bones very tightly. As Han Sen pulled the skeleton, it barely budged. It could only be shaken a small amount. Therefore, Han Sen could not get the skeleton away from the flower and separate the two.</p>

<p>In a pure spirit body, Han Sen was unable to use his geno arts. Han Sen hesitated before letting go of the skeleton. He reached his hands into the skeleton’s chest and did his best to try and grab the purple flower.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s hands came into contact with the small, purple flower. The small, purple flower’s petals were like those of a dandelion. They fell and floated in the breeze.</p>

<p>Han Sen quickly tried to grasp the flying petals. Every petal he caught melted like water in his hands. Suddenly, all 13 petals melted away. They were all gone.</p>

<p>The purple flower went away with it. The vines around the skeleton died. They turned into dust and scattered all over the ground.</p>
