    <p>
      &#8220;Daddy, you sure have a lot of free time recently.&#8221; Ji Yanran
      smiled at Ji Ruozhen&#8217;s image on the video chat.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t help it; my future son-in-law is far too
      talented!&#8221; Ji Ruozhen looked like he was joking.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What has he done now?&#8221; Ji Yanran blinked to look as if she
      didn&#8217;t know, despite the fact Han Sen had already told her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Didn&#8217;t he tell you? He used a spirit to beat a dozen elites
      and Huang Yunlong,&#8221; Ji Ruozhen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I only heard he used a humanoid pet beast soul to kill a bunch of
      thieves that sought to rob him,&#8221; Ji Yanran said, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thieves, huh?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen smiled and asked her, &#8220;Baby
      Daughter, did you ask him what level his beast soul is?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Super beast soul,&#8221; Ji Yanran replied with certainty.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;So, it is a super beast soul?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen had already guessed
      that much, but he was still taken aback to hear it confirmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Han Sen to have a beast soul like that, he had to have killed at least
      one other super creature. It was hard not to be surprised by it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ji family spent a lot of wealth to fund the killing of just one super
      creature, and that was in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had killed at least two super creatures in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, all by himself. This was the sort of goal many families had
      been vying to achieve over the past few generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having a super pet and raising it to a battle mode was a far better
      investment than Ji Qing&#8217;s super armor. The boon of power Han Sen had
      received would work exceptionally well when facing off against other super
      creatures in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that super pet by his side, Han Sen was sure to kill many more super
      creatures from now on. And Ji Qing&#8217;s super armor hadn&#8217;t lent
      her much aid, overall.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did Han Sen tell you how many super creatures he has actually
      killed?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He has killed two in total.&#8221; Ji Yanran only told her father
      what Han Sen had told her. Han Sen had placed the kill of the Deadeye
      Peacock on the little angel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen sighed and said, &#8220;I thought Ji Qing was lucky, but Han
      Sen&#8217;s luck far exceeds hers.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That super pet just evolved into battle mode, and Han Sen
      hasn&#8217;t brought her to fight any other super creatures yet. Huang
      Yunlong&#8217;s death came at what was practically her first trial
      run.&#8221; Ji Yanran laughed. She continued by saying, &#8220;Oh, and Han
      Sen said he will provide us with the frosty bear&#8217;s essence.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;And what are the conditions of such an offering?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dad, don&#8217;t say that. Why would there be any conditions or
      strings attached? He only said that it was a gift for me and I can do
      whatever I want with it.&#8221; Ji Yanran blinked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There really aren&#8217;t any conditions?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen asked
      again, with much surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There aren&#8217;t. But because he&#8217;s been so good to your
      daughter, you can&#8217;t allow yourself to be in his debt,&#8221; Ji
      Yanran slyly suggested, acting all cute.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This Han Sen is a smart guy, I&#8217;ll give him that. Giving it to
      you as a gift will undoubtedly benefit him more than if he were to sell it
      to us.&#8221; Ji Ruozhen smiled and finished by saying, &#8220;He has very
      good judgment, to think this way. He is not someone who hankers for a
      little profit every chance he gets.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know; I&#8217;m not blind. You didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d pick
      a fool, did you?&#8221; Ji Yanran smiled and proceeded to say, &#8220;Han
      Sen told me he&#8217;ll be staying in the Icefield, and that we can come
      pick up the Life Geno essence whenever we want.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure. You tell Little Han that the Ji family does not accept
      charity, and things aren&#8217;t accepted without something given in
      return. I&#8217;ll go back and have a talk with your uncle. We&#8217;ll
      give Han Sen a reasonable reward for this gift. Fret not.&#8221; Ji
      Ruozhen then paused for a bit before asking, &#8220;Oh, and tell Little
      Han that the Ji family is formally requesting the opportunity to cooperate
      and hunt a super creature together, in unison. If he is interested,
      I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have much to discuss. And in regards to that
      other Life Geno essence&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen agreed to sell it to the Qin family,&#8221; Ji Yanran
      answered immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Qin family?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen lowered his head to think for a
      bit, and then continued by saying, &#8220;Not bad. He&#8217;s got his head
      screwed on right. He sure knows what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>â€¦</p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran did not lie. Han Sen was indeed planning on selling it to the
      Qin family. After all, he could not absorb the Life Geno essence of a
      first generation super creature, and holding onto it would just make
      others jealous. He would also maximize the profit he could receive by
      selling it as early as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was a part of the Special Security Operation Team, and it looked
      after his family. Considering his relationship with Qin Xuan, he was
      almost obligated to sell it to the Qin family.
    </p>

    <p>
      The news of the sale of the two Life Geno essences, and the fact he was in
      possession of a super pet, became well-known facts in the Alliance. A lot
      of key officers and faction officials were rocked by the news. A lot of
      people who knew Han Sen in a closer capacity were asked about him. Did he
      have more Life Geno essences? Would he be willing to cooperate, maybe even
      help hunt a super creature?
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s answer, of course, was no. He rejected all requests and
      remained in the shelter, refusing to go anywhere. All he did was practice
      his Dongxuan Sutra while waiting for the peaches to ripen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though he was in the Goddess Shelter, Han Sen still felt the itch of
      numerous eyes watching him wherever he went. He supposed that was the
      price of being famous.
    </p>

    <p>
      But overall, Han Sen cared little. A month later, the season for the
      peaches to ripen had fast approached. Han Sen summoned Beetle Knight to
      camouflage himself while he was in the shelter, so he could sneak out
      unseen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole world was paying heed to Han Sen&#8217;s every movement. Having
      a super pet made him the focus of everyone. No one would miss a beat when
      it came to his wheeling and dealing, coming and going.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was especially true when it came to the fighting of super creatures.
      If Han Sen was seen hunting a super creature, countless people would visit
      him, using a flurry of stretched excuses for why he should sell a Life
      Geno essence to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not mind selling them, but he did not want to sell them to
      just anyone. Regardless, this was primarily why he chose to sneak out
      without leaving a trace for others to follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get the mystic fruit from the giant peach tree in the Peach Forest, Han
      Sen brought the silver fox and the little angel. He wanted to grab a peach
      to see if he could unlock the first tier of the Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Entering the Peach Forest once more, Han Sen had far more courage. Even if
      the pink snake brought an army with him, he was confident he could slay
      them all, with the silver fox and little angel by his side.
    </p>

    <p>
      But nothing of the sort happened. The silver fox&#8217;s presence shooed
      off any creatures along the way, which disappointed Han Sen. He was
      looking forward to the possibility of slaying a host of sacred-blood
      snakes, so he could gobble them up and get closer to maxing out his sacred
      geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for some reason, the pink snake and its legion of slithering serpents
      did not appear until he had arrived at the giant tree.
