<h2>Rainbow Cloud Peak</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2069</h3>

<p>“They are both spirits guarded by Jade Air, and yet, there is so
much difference between them. I need to get more Jade Fairy Spirit
Orbs to level up my Jadeskin. Maybe the results will surprise me,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen still left with Lone Bamboo to travel to Rainbow Cloud
Peak. On the way, Han Sen tried to refine the Jade Tiger Spirit
Orb. It was very difficult for him, and after using it, he felt as
if he had been thrust into an ice cave. It took him a lot of effort
to completely refine the orb.</p>
<p>After swallowing the Jade Tiger Spirit Orb, the results were the
same as they would have been if he had refined a Jade Fairy Spirit
Orb, except that the Tiger Orb provided him with more energy.</p>
<p>The Fairy Orbs made Han Sen’s Jadeskin godlight grow stronger,
though. The Jade Tiger Spirit Orb didn’t give him that feeling.</p>
<p>Rainbow Cloud Peak was an island built out of clouds. The clouds
themselves were solid, and the mountains and forests were all
clouds, too.</p>
<p>There were many creatures there that were made of clouds, as
well. Going there was like entering a marshmallow land.</p>
<p>There are many cloud beasts here, it would seem. Which one were
you talking about?” Han Sen saw many creatures made of clouds, and
he noted how they all appeared to be fairly docile.</p>
<p>“Brother Lone Bamboo and Han Sen! Are you two here to hunt the
Cloud Beast, too?” Before Lone Bamboo answered Han Sen, a student
from Sky Palace came running toward them. Lone Bamboo didn’t
respond, and Han Sen could tell he didn’t know who this person
was.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been here long, so I don’t know many people. Who are
you?” Han Sen asked on Lone Bamboo’s behalf.</p>
<p>The man wasn’t of the Sky. He had the head of a white tiger, and
the armor he wore was made of fur. He looked like one of the Tego,
but it wasn’t the one he had encountered before.</p>
<p>But if he had come to this peak, he must have been a Marquise
Teacher. Even if he wasn’t one of the Sky, he had to be a person of
some renown.</p>
<p>The man answered, “My name is White Real. It’s understandable
that you don’t know me, as I have been working at Sky Path Garden.
I rarely ever leave.”</p>
<p>You are Brother White.” When Han Sen heard the man was working
in the Sky Path Garden, he was taken aback.</p>
<p>Sky Path Garden was incredibly restricted. Even most students of
the Sky were refused entry. And this man was an outsider, to top it
all off.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that Sky Path Garden offered the highest tier of
technology research. Many geno arts were modified there, and that
was where they developed treasures. The work was mostly done by the
students of Sky Path Garden.</p>
<p>White Real looked very strong and lean, but he actually worked
in a field that required mental fortitude. Han Sen was reminded
that you should never judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>White Real looked at Han Sen. “Brother Han, I admire you. Your
modification of Under the Sky became an instant classic in Sky Path
Garden. It was put in a textbook. Geniuses like you are wasted if
they are not brought to someplace like Sky Path Garden.”</p>
<p>That is too much for me. And I was just lucky in my
modifications. I don’t think I could do it again, if I had to,” Han
Sen responded. And he wasn’t just being humble, either.</p>
<p>If Under the Sky hadn’t been a skill he was already good at,
then he never could have done what he did so perfectly.</p>
<p>“No, no, no! You are smart. There is no need for you to be so
humble. Actually, I have always had a question I have wanted to ask
you, but we have never had the chance to meet before today. Today,
in this encounter, God is giving me this chance. This is how I
encourage myself, for I hope you can help me.” After that, White
Real bowed to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see how sincere the man was being, and he knew
that declining would leave him feeling guilty.</p>
<p>“You can ask me whatever you like, and we can discuss it. But I
am truly quite average, and I fear I may not be able to help you,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>White Real was ecstatic to hear Han Sen’s acceptance, and he
ultimately ignored what Han Sen told him. He pulled out his phone
and showed Han Sen information on a geno art. He then began
excitedly explaining it in greater detail.</p>
<p>The geno art was complicated, and it was taking White Real a
while to explain it. Han Sen looked at Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo sat down and said, “Time is no issue for me.”</p>
<p>So Han Sen turned his attention back to White Real and listened.
He quickly grasped the problem that the researcher was having.</p>
<p>White Real was studying a geno art called Echo. It initially
sounded useless. After Han Sen learned the purpose behind the name
Echo, however, he was surprised by what it did.</p>
<p>Echo was not a geno art that used sonic powers for navigation,
the way a bat might. It was a fighting geno art that used sonic
powers to attack.</p>
<p>The sonic powers continuously stacked up to deal blows of
ever-increasing strength, increasing the duration and power of the
attacks.</p>
<p>The idea behind it sounded fine, but stacking sonic powers was
difficult. After all, when you attacked an enemy, you wouldn’t
always be in an enclosed area like a warehouse. Geno arts like that
required a catered environment, which made them difficult to use in
real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>White Real had been mostly successful with it. In a particular
environment that was fitting, he could increase the power output
and the duration of the sonic power. He couldn’t carry a warehouse
around in his pocket to fight, though.</p>
<p>If he needed to cage an opponent in a specific battleground
before combat, the geno art wouldn’t be reliable. White Real had
researched this for a long time, and he couldn’t find a way to make
Echo effective at all times.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought for a while, and he found himself confused, too.
Echo had a rock-solid flaw, and it was something that would be
tricky to modify.</p>
<p>Fish could only swim in water, and birds could only fly in the
air. Echo required a special environment to be cast effectively,
and changing things too much would result in Echo not being Echo
anymore.</p>
<p>“Brother White, I do not think I will be able to help you. If
you want Echo to be used in real combat, it will have to be used in
a sealed environment. Unless you have a big bell to trap your foe,
I don’t think there is another way to make use of this,” Han Sen
guiltily admitted to him.</p>
<p>When White Real heard this, his eyes brightened. “Wait, what you
said makes perfect sense! I will just need a big bell to cage the
enemy. By doing that, the environmental problem will be of no
concern. With a bell to cage Echo, the sonic powers will bounce
around inside it. It’d keep on attacking.”</p>
<p>White Real kept on talking, confusing Han Sen. Although Han Sen
had learned how to modify geno arts, his methods were very
different than White Real’s.</p>
<p>“Is everyone of the White family modifying geno arts?” Han Sen
wondered. He thought back to his old teacher Bai Yishan, too. He
felt bad.</p>
<p>White Real left in excitement. Han Sen did not think using a
bell was a good idea. Who would be dumb enough to let themselves
get trapped inside a bell, after all? Someone who was that stupid
would not need to be killed with Echo.</p>
