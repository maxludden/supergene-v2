    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen fired the bolt at the T-rex&#8217;s eyelid once more, but again it
      blinked and the bolt couldn&#8217;t pierce through it entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      But exceeding Han Sen&#8217;s expectations, Wang Yuhang immediately picked
      up more pieces of metal to lob at the monster, all the while shouting and
      screaming. The T-rex only looked at Han Sen for one second before resuming
      its chase of Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, that&#8217;s right! You can do it. I have faith in
      you!&#8221; Han Sen couldn&#8217;t fathom the sordid deeds Wang Yuhang
      must have committed in a past life to be given such bad luck in this one.
      The aggro he could pull, with such little effort, was astonishing.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, with Wang Yuhang subject to the T-rex&#8217;s pursuit once more,
      Han Sen got back to searching for the perfect chance of striking the
      T-rex&#8217;s eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it wasn&#8217;t quick on its feet, the reactions of this super
      creature weren&#8217;t too slow. Even with Han Sen taking his best
      possible shot, the creature always caught the bolts with its eyelid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some bolts were dodged outright by the T-rex, deflected off its scales.
      Trying to penetrate anywhere else on its body was a futile endeavor, for
      all the bolts would do was leave a little white scratch mark before
      pinging off to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang, at this point, was only barely managing to keep himself
      together. The flames that engulfed much of his body, leaving behind a
      multitude of nasty burns, were starting to take a toll on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, I am reaching the end of my tether! If you are to slay
      this over-sized doggie, I recommend doing it soon!&#8221; Wang Yuhang was
      crying as he ran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, please, hold on just a little bit longer!&#8221; As
      Han Sen spoke, he had his crossbow raised, preparing to take another shot
      at the T-rex&#8217;s eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      A dozen bolts were already lodged in its eyelids like a bar room
      dartboard. None had managed to pierce through and scrape its actual
      eyeball.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Another bolt fired, from a much closer distance this time. He expected
      this shot to strike its eye, but the eyelid blocked it once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen reached for his quiver again, he was overwhelmed with dread
      to notice it was empty. They had all been fired, with no damage having
      been dealt to the beast that had assaulted them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brave men must shoulder the greatest of deeds. Cowards? Nothing.
      I&#8217;m going in!&#8221; Han Sen knew the bolts were fairly well-lodged
      in the monster&#8217;s eyelids and thought this would be his only chance.
      So he took off running towards the monster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Killing the monster was not his priority right now. He wasn&#8217;t doing
      this for himself. He knew if he let the monster claim this place for
      itself, it would only be a matter of time before it chose to wreak havoc
      on the ice fields far below. Homes and shelters would be burnt to ash, and
      people would undoubtedly be eaten whenever it fancied a snack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t want to risk leaving the beast alive. He had
      exhausted one of his greatest chances of killing it already, so he wanted
      to push a little further. And even if he could not kill it, he&#8217;d at
      least deal as much damage as he could before retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
      He cast Long Live and Jade-Sun Force. His arms were imbued with a great
      amount of energy, and the energy generated inside his heart empowered
      every corner of his body. Han Sen&#8217;s body made a clicking sound, as
      if he was shifting gear, going into overdrive.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Wang Yuhang still stealing the spotlight of the T-rex&#8217;s
      attention, Han Sen was able to run beside the creature and effortlessly
      leap up onto it. Quickly, he pranced to the top of the T-rex&#8217;s head.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex noticed Han Sen&#8217;s presence, and maniacally writhed in a
      bid to get him off and reach him with its talons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used Dongxue Sutra to simulate Aero. He took flight from off the
      T-rex and dodged its attack like a strange bird. With a window of
      opportunity now open for him, he went in and tried to kick the bolt-laden
      eyelid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex, however, turned around and tried to evade the attack. But as
      this happened, Han Sen borrowed strength from the air to carry his kick
      and prepared to batter the eye with his legs seven times.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex, failing to dodge the attacks, simply shut its eyelids, thinking
      it could shield its eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was exactly what Han Sen wanted. He walloped each of his seven
      kicks firmly into the bolts planted on the monster&#8217;s eyelid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s legs were like steel sledgehammers. After seven strikes,
      the bolts were malleted deep into the monster&#8217;s squishy eyeball.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Roar!&#8221; The T-rex blasted one last cry to the sky as blood
      gushed from its ruined eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      The raven feather bolts, following Han Sen&#8217;s hits, had become
      implanted deep in the monster&#8217;s eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex squirmed in pain as it tried to open its eye. But when it raised
      its eyelid, it dragged the bolts up with it, ruining its eye further. Now,
      more blood cascaded from the extra crevices that were cut into the
      eyeball.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking advantage of another window of opportunity that had opened for him,
      Han Sen kicked the beast another seven times. He was using the skill
      called Seven Kill, which, when combined with Aero, brought devastating
      damage upon the monster&#8217;s other eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Roar!&#8221; The T-rex&#8217;s other eye was now gushing blood.
      Having lost its vision completely, the monster flailed about in agony.
    </p>

    <p>
      Infuriated, the T-rex began shooting geysers of flame in all directions.
      Han Sen could only fly away from it, to avoid being incinerated by the
      wild flames.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han! That was fine work.&#8221; Wang Yuhang looked
      delighted. But just as he said that, he accidentally walked into the fire
      being spewed by the T-rex, which had caught on fire once again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Argh!&#8221; Wang Yuhang rolled around on the ground like a loon,
      trying to snuff out the flames. His bottom was as black as charcoal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex no longer had any vision, and it was in agony. Every time it
      tried to blink, it dealt itself even greater damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex&#8217;s talons were so long and thick, it couldn&#8217;t pull
      the bolts out of its eyelid, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      The longer it went on, the more the T-rex panicked. It flapped its four
      flame-wreathed wings in a bid to escape. Han Sen used this time to pick up
      the bolts that were on the floor. Then he summoned his wings to chase
      after the T-rex.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was the first time he had gotten so close to killing a super creature
      since coming to the Second Shelter. Unlike the last time with the Deadeye
      Peacock, which was basically a killsteal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The T-rex flailed madly in the sky as it continued shooting fireballs from
      its mouth. The sky was dark, lit up only by its flames. It was a
      terrifying spectacle to behold.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people down on the ice fields were able to watch the scene unfold, and
      it frightened those who looked up.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one had ever seen such a scary monster in the ice fields before, so
      this sort of sight was new to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Look! Someone is chasing after that horrible creature!&#8221;
      someone shouted.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Where? Where?!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty far off; of course you can&#8217;t see it with
      your eyes. Use a pair of binoculars, old man!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      In the shelter, technological products were prohibited. But simple viewing
      items like binoculars or spyglasses were allowed, as their function was
      only built through glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people brought out their own binoculars to watch the scene unfold
      with greater clarity. They watched as a man chased off a flying T-rex that
      breathed fire in the sky.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Whoa! It&#8217;s Leader Han!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! Leader Han is super OP. How has he managed to get such
      a big scary creature to run away from him in fear?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He is too powerful. Did Leader Han claim ownership of the metal
      shelter up there, too, all by himself?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s so handsome. He&#8217;s so good!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      The people who watched Han Sen chase away the T-rex all reeled in shock
      and admiration. They thought Han Sen was hunting it down.
