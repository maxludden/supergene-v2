<h3>Chapter 3161</h3>

<p>Feng Fei Fei walked over and told Han Sen, “Mister Han and Fei
Fei, I understand your noble intentions, but Little Yin’s sonic
talents are exceptional. We still hope she can receive a sonic God
Spirit Blood-Pulse.”</p>
<p>Aside from the reason Han Fei Fei pointed out, there was an
additional reason that she merely felt bad for suggesting. The God
of Wealth Han Sen suggested was something Feng Fei Fei had never of
before. Besides the fact it wasn’t one of the 12 Annihilation-class
main gods, there wasn’t a God of Wealth amid the famous Disaster
God Spirits.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei had explored for many years, hoping to find a sonic
Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse for Little Yin, but
Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulses were hard to find.</p>
<p>Even if Feng Yin Yin’s talent tempted the spirits, the 12
Annihilation God Spirits were controlled by the kings of the seven
kingdoms. Commoners had no chance of praying for a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>Among the 12 Annihilation God Spirits, there were only two
connected with sonic powers. One was a pure sonic God Spirit, and
the other one only had a connection to it.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei had been busy on Feng Yin Yin’s behalf. She hoped
she would be able to one day have her try inside the pure sonic God
Spirit’s temple. It was a shame that the sonic God Spirit was owned
by the kings of the Chu Kingdom. Only the royals of the Chu Kingdom
could go into that god temple and pray for a Blood Pulse. Feng Fei
Fei had tried her best, but she was never successful.</p>
<p>There was still a chance with the other God Spirits, and Feng
Fei Fei had left home because of that.</p>
<p>God never answered prayers. For some reason, Feng Fei Fei
failed. She had only recently returned. After that, Feng Fei Fei
had some ideas. She believed some methods would enable her to have
a chance with Feng Yin Yin.</p>
<p>“Auntie, it is fine,” Feng Yin Yin said with a laugh. “The God
Spirit San Mu has introduced me to must be good.”</p>
<p>She did not just say that because she trusted Han Sen. She did
not want Feng Fei Fei to incur so much trouble on her behalf. Feng
Yin Yin knew Feng Fei Fei had suffered a lot because of her
tireless search for a God Spirit Blood – Pulse. She had given it a
lot of effort.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei was one of the most popular singers. To do
something this big, she also had to beg a lot of people. She would
have probably suffered much in her struggle.</p>
<p>As a result, Feng Yin Yin felt bad for her. Thus, she did not
want her to continue suffering on her behalf.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei quickly said, “I know the God Spirit Mister Han has
suggested cannot be too bad, but your musical talents are more than
exceptional. If you earn the element from another God Spirit
Blood-Pulse, it will be a waste of your natural gift.”</p>
<p>After hearing Feng Fei Fei say that, Han Sen did not know what
to say. He knew Feng Fei Fei’s musical talents were extraordinary.
It really was a shame if she was unable to get a sonic God Spirit
to capitalize on her talent.</p>
<p>Han Sen also wanted to find a sonic sub-god to be in the God of
Wealth Temple, but he did not think he could get that done any time
soon. Feng Fei Fei probably wouldn’t believe in an empty promise.
Seeing Han Sen not insist any further, Feng Fei Fei felt relieved.
She stroked Feng Yin Yin’s head and said, “Don’t worry, Yin Yin. I
know where to get you a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. You just need to
give me another month and a half, and you will have a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse.”</p>
<p>Although Han Sen did not believe her, he did not say anything
about it.</p>
<p>Even if Feng Fei Fei did give Feng Yin Yin a chance, she would
only get a complete Blood-Pulse. It would not be a Blood-Pulse that
could be inherited, so it was not very meaningful.</p>
<p>They were both Annihilation class. God of Wealth, however, was
not sonic class. Feng Fei Fei would have a Blood-Pulse that could
be inherited. They were very different from each other.</p>
<p>This was something Han Sen could not push. He just needed to
convince Feng Fei Fei.</p>
<p>He could not rush it. He needed Feng Yin Yin to go on his side.
He could not allow Feng Yin Yin to start obeying other God
Spirits.</p>
<p>The next day, Feng Fei Fei was in a rush to go again. Based on
her expression, there was an 80% to 90% chance she was going to do
something for Feng Yin Yin.</p>
<p>Not long after Feng Fei Fei was gone, Feng Yin Yin ran to Han
Sen and seriously asked, “San Mu, can you take me to the God of
Wealth Temple?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I can. Don’t you need to confirm this with your
auntie? Doesn’t she need to agree?” Han Sen did not want Feng Fei
Fei and Feng Yin Yin to fall out with each other because of
this.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that Feng Fei Fei really adored Feng Yin Yin. After
all, Feng Yin Yin lost her mother when she very young. Feng Fei Fei
was the one who raised her. She was a cousin, but the relationship
was more like that of a mother and daughter. “Actually, it is
because I do not want auntie to be busy on my behalf. She never
tells me, but I know the God Spirit she begs for me is very nice. I
like it too, but that god temple belongs to a king of the Qin
Kingdom that has a different name. That king with a different
surname happens to like Little Auntie. I am afraid…” After saying
that, Feng Yin Yin suddenly stopped talking.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what she meant. He admired Feng Yin Yin’s
sensitivity. She was so young, but she saw a lot. It was no wonder
she was Xiang Yin reborn.</p>
<p>“OK, I will take you to the God of Wealth Temple,” Han Sen said
with a smile. “The God of Wealth is not a sonic God Spirit, but he
will not disappoint you.”</p>
<p>“San Mu has never disappointed me,” Feng Yin Yin said with a
blink of her eyes.</p>
<p>It was too late to take Feng Yin Yin to the Gold Crystal System,
so Han Sen used the Sky God Crown. He picked up Bao’er and Feng Yin
Yin and took them into the God of Wealth Temple. They appeared on
the altar.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin looked at Han Sen with shock. “How did you do that?
How can you go to a god temple from home so quickly?”</p>
<p>“It is because this is my god temple,” Han Sen said with a
smile. “I can come and go as I please.”</p>
<p>“Your god temple? Are you a God Spirit, San Mu?” Feng Yin Yin
looked at Han Sen with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Kind of,” Han Sen replied.</p>
<p>“This god statue does not look like you.” Feng Yin Yin looked at
the God of Wealth statue. It was Han Sen’s god statue, and it was
made from a god base.</p>
<p>Han Sen was wearing the Sky God Crown, which was how he had
become a God Spirit. He was not actually a God Spirit, which was
why the god statue did not look like him. The god statue’s face was
very blurry, so no one could really identify it.</p>
<p>The Sky God Crown on the god statue’s head was the same as the
Sky God Crown on his head.</p>
<p>“Put one drop of your blood onto the god stove.” Han Sen did not
explain things further. He pointed at the stove on the gold
altar.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin nodded. She walked to the stove and picked up a
knife. Her nervous hands trembled.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Han Sen said. “This place is mine. No matter what
your talent is, you can get an inheritable Blood-Pulse.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, San Mu.” Feng Yin Yin was not as nervous now, so she
cut her finger and dropped some of her blood onto the god
stove.</p>
<p>A moment later, the god stove played a god sound. Some gold
light was released. A tree of gold light appeared out of the
stove.</p>
<p>The gold tree shot up into the sky. It had many different coins
on it. It was a money tree.</p>
