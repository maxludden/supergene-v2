  When the white flame touched the evil, black, and purple spirit, it was like it had met gasoline. The entire god temple lit up in a fire.

The power possessing Han Sen and Bald Guy vanished. They regained control of their bodies.

When he saw the little flying fish spit out a fire to battle the guillotine, Bald Guy’s mouth opened wide. He was so shocked that he could not close his mouth. The scary fire was able to do battle with a God Spirit, and it showed no sign of being at a disadvantage. The whole god temple was bathed in fire. Only the god altar, which had the guillotine, was not burning.

The guillotine released black and purple flames and evil spirits. The flying fish suppressed the flames that came out of it.

Bald Guy thought about the time he had talked about skinning the flying fish and all the other stuff he had said to it. He now felt very happy. He was glad that he hadn’t acted on his desires.

Li Bing Yu was flabbergasted. She had already thought that the small flying fish was weird. She knew it was not a low-level gene race, but she did not expect it to be that scary. It was effectively combatting the powers of a God Spirit.

vei

A gene race with that power suggested only one possibility. It proved that it must have absorbed a God Spirit Blood-Pulse before. It had already become a God Spirit gene race.

Han Sen was a bit surprised too. It looked like gene races that absorbed God Spirit Blood-Pulses could fight God Spirits.

In the future, he only needed to use Cast God Court to evolve a God Spirit gene race. Then, he did not have to break the rules of the world to fight a God Spirit.

Now, Han Sen hoped the blood dragon would evolve faster so it could absorb the god dragon Blood-Pulse faster. He did not know how strong the blood god dragon would become after that.

“How is it possible for such a powerful God Spirit gene race to obey a human?” The doll looked at the flying fish with shock. Han Sen was shocked as well.

Han Sen looked at the doll and coldly asked, “Now, can you tell me where you are from?”

The doll was speechless. It could not have been any ordinary God Spirit.

The doll suddenly laughed and said, “You are cocky far too soon. Your God Spirit gene race is strong, but if I am not mistaken, it is a rare gene race that absorbed an Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It is one of the strongest in the universe, but it is a shame…”

Han Sen’s face didn’t change as he asked, “What is a shame?”

The doll replied, “It is a shame that it does not have a god temple for support. It is just a wild god that is down upon the table.” The doll grabbed the rope and pulled the heavy blade to the highest point, which made the cord straight.

Suddenly, the entire guillotine released extremely scary purple and black flames. It was like a volcano erupting. It fought the small flying fish’s flames.

In the next second, the doll let go of the rope and let it fall. The heavy blade went down like it was insane. It snapped itself into the guillotine very hard.

Boom! The guillotine exploded. It was like hell cutting open a door. Countless scary spirits emerged. It was very scary. The purple and black flames incinerated everything.

The small, flying fish was in front of Han Sen. Its body was puffed up like a circular ball. It spewed white fire and fought the scary power that the guillotine had produced.

The flying fish’s mouth was full of blood. It was injured and fell back.

Bao’er picked up the injured little flying fish. Her angry eyes looked murderous. This was a rare feeling for her to express.

The doll laughed as if it was insane. “I told you. No matter how powerful it may be, it is just a wild god on the table. Compared to a real god like me, there is a gulf in power that cannot be closed.”

Amid the doll’s very sharp laughing voice, the self-destructive guillotine reformed on the god altar. It looked just like the old guillotine. The powerful presence did not change.

The guillotine’s power was as strong as the small flying fish. It might have even been weaker than the small flying fish, but it had the protection of a god temple. It was able to keep rebuilding itself atop the god altar.

The guillotine was able to keep burning the small flying fish. It could have been blown up 100 times and still kill again. The little flying fish was not able to be reborn in the same fashion.

Han Sen looked murderous too. He coldly glared at the doll and said, “You are using the immortal power the god temple gave you.”

“So, what? That is the power of a god. That establishes the difference between a god and a commoner.” The doll continued pulling the rope. It again pulled up the blade of the guillotine. It greedily looked at the small flying fish. “This is a God Spirit gene race. If I can absorb it and use it, I can push myself to be a superior Reboot class being. God must have given me this chance today.”

Li Bing Yu suddenly screamed with shock, “Han Sen, fall back! I know what this is! It is not a God Spirit! It is a member of the God Chaos Party!”

The doll laughed harder. “I did not expect humans to still remember the God Chaos Party. This is becoming rather interesting.” “What is the God Chaos Party?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Li Bing Yu’s voice trembled as she said, “It is an organization of special creatures. In the God Chaos Party, every creature can fight God Spirits. They are not God Spirits themselves, but they have the power to make God Spirits feel fear. In ancient times, the God Chaos Party was known throughout the universe. It made a sky full of God Spirits descend. The universe was almost destroyed.”

The doll laughed weirdly and interrupted Li Bing Yu. “You know nothing. The God Spirits are where the evil comes from. The world is supposed to be lawless. God Spirits enforce laws and control the universe. That is an insult to the universe. We just want the universe to be how it should be.”

“Does that mean you are not a God Spirit?” Han Sen now understood. He knew why the guillotine and doll did not carry the same presence as a God Spirit.

“No, I am a God Spirit, but I am a real God Spirit. I am not like those rubbish God Spirits.” The doll suddenly stopped laughing and looked serious. “Allow me to introduce myself. My god name is Decapitation Queen. I control the universe and death penalties. I am the god of death sentences.”

“What a shame,” Decapitation Queen said. “The small flying fish would have fit in well with the God Chaos Party and become a real god, but it is now fighting me. That means you will all have to die.” She pulled the cord and lifted the blade to its highest point.

Boom!

The heavy blade descended. The guillotine released scary purple and black flames. Countless evil spirits burst out like it was the end of the world.

“It has been so long since I killed a God Spirit.” Han Sen faced that tsunami-like, scary purple and black flames. His body did not turn black. His body started to turn white. Suddenly, his entire body looked white. Long hair was draped down to his ankles, and his eyes had turned white.
