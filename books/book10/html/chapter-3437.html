<p>Han Sen looked at Crape Myrtle and asked, “How was that punch?”</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle’s body calmed down. He then answered, “Not bad.”</p>

<p>He said it very simply as if nothing had happened. In his heart, he was more than shocked. Han Sen’s punch had been one of pure body power. It shook his body. He could not imagine how that could have happened. Crape Myrtle was like a different kind of God Spirit. After all, he was known as Geno Hall Leader. To be direct, the geno hall was a Super God Spirit temple, and Crape Myrtle was the main god of it. The other 12 Annihilation-class God Spirit and other lower-class God Spirit were its sub-gods.</p>

<p>All of the god temple powers gave Crape Myrtle a God Spirit buff. The more powerful the God Spirit was, the more buffs Crape Myrtle could get.</p>

<p>Plus, Crape Myrtle had half of his foot in the Universe class. His god body’s strength was above Qin Xiu. Unless there was a Universe-class power, no one should have been able to move his god body.</p>

<p>But Han Sen’s power made his god body shake. It made Crape Myrtle’s body want to explode. His brain was still buzzing after that mighty punch.</p>

<p>Although this was because Crape Myrtle was a very proud person, it was already enough to make Crape Myrtle very shocked.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle thought, “His body is so scary. His pure body power is already so strong. If he can truly grasp and control his body one day, even if Qin Xiu takes that step, he might not be an adequate rival to him.”</p>

<p>“Are you okay?” Han Sen saw Crape Myrtle was not speaking or doing anything in return. He thought the punch might have hurt him pretty badly.</p>

<p>Under the suppression of Crape Myrtle’s 28 starlights, Han Sen had still managed to activate his body power. This time, the power was not coming from the outside. It was coming from somewhere within. It came from his will. He had finally been able to trigger his body power.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt that power he had activated was just a small part of it. If he wanted to activate the whole power in his body and use it, he could not imagine the sort of trick that would be necessary to achieve such a feat.</p>

<p>“How could I have a problem? Your power is far from being sufficient enough to damage me.” Crape Myrtle raised his head and behaved as if nothing happened.</p>

<p>“Really? In that case, that is great. Try and withstand a few more of my punches.” Han Sen wanted to try his method a few more times and see if he could dredge up even more power from deep within his body.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle’s heart was now in shock, but his face did not change to display it. He thought, “If I take a few more of your punches, my god body will start to suffer.”</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle went there because he wanted to suppress Han Sen so he could learn to control his body. He quickly realized that his power was not even enough to suppress Han Sen. He was unable to activate his power.</p>

<p>Although Han Sen had been able to trigger some amount of power, the power he used was pure body power. He knew that it was the most basic power there was. He was far from being able to trigger the real, meaty stuff.</p>

<p>“Human Alpha created the Story of Genes, but Human Alpha did not practice it. Han Sen, however, did. If Human Alpha knew his Story of Genes could lend a hand in creating such a scary body, I wonder if he would regret treading the path he ultimately settled on.” Crape Myrtle thought about this to himself, as he came to a decision.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle raised his head, looked at Han Sen, and said, “Han Sen, although your body is very strong, if this was back then and you could really control your body, I do not think I would be able to defeat you. Today, you will be given no chance of improving.” “What is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen was shocked by the remarks.</p>

<p>He thought Crape Myrtle was not there for fighting. Upon hearing Crape Myrtle’s tone of voice, it sounded as if he wanted to stop him from leveling up to reach the last fight.</p>

<p>“Was I mistaken? Is this not Geno Hall Leader?” Han Sen wondered to himself.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not know Crape Myrtle did not plan on winning. After seeing Han Sen’s body, he decided to kick Han Sen out. He did not want him to fight Human King.</p>

<p>If Han Sen encountered Human King now, Han Sen was sure to lose. Han Sen needed more time. Even if Human King was finally able to walk the final step, Han Sen would then have a chance of winning for sure. Crape Myrtle had to decide. He wanted to now kick Han Sen out of the fights so he could grow up a bit more.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen and spoke coldly to him. “What I am saying is that today I will win. In grief and sadness, you will have to abandon the fight.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not.” Han Sen had just found a way to use his body. He was no longer defenseless.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle weirdly laughed. “No one can reject something I want to come to pass.”</p>

<p>Before Han Sen could speak, Crape Myrtle put his hands together and opened them. When his hands opened, there was a god light. The god light was too strong. It shone across the whole 33 skies’ battlegrounds. It was like a giant sun. All the creatures that were watching the fight felt their eyes hurt. They dared not keep their eyes on it. They closed their eyes. Even the elites that could withstand the shiny god lights could only see shiny god lights. They could not see what was transpiring in the arena.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s eyes could see through the shiny god light, and he could observe Crape Myrtle’s movements inside the light.</p>

<p>When Crape Myrtle opened his hands, there was a space rift between his hands. Within that space rift, an old door appeared.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the geno hall door?” Upon seeing the door appear, Han Sen was given a fright.</p>

<p>If Crape Myrtle was able to summon the geno hall door, it had to mean he was the guy inside the geno hall. When Crape Myrtle opened his hands completely, the geno hall door was revealed in its entirety.</p>

<p>“Open!” Crape Myrtle shouted. The old and mysterious door opened. Suddenly, a very bright god light started to seep through the door.</p>

<p>This was the light of 10,000 race lanterns, but Han Sen still did not understand why the geno hall only had the race lanterns of the geno universe. There were no race lanterns dedicated to the universe of kingdoms.</p>

<p>Also, the universe of kingdoms was the home for any god temples. No god temples existed in the geno universe.</p>

<p>Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen and said, “Han Sen, go. You will find what you need inside here.”</p>

<p>Han Sen knew for sure that this was geno hall’s Mister God. He was confused, so he asked, “Big Brother, what is that supposed to mean? I am going to fight Qin Xiu! If you send me away, you will have to fight Qin Xiu by yourself.”</p>

<p>“There is no more Qin Xiu,” Crape Myrtle said.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Han Sen was shocked. He did not know what had been going on inside the other arenas. He did not know Qin Xiu had been consumed by Human King.</p>
