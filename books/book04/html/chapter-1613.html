      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were terrified, and they bolted back into the
      shelter. They almost hugged each other out of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do we do without the boss? Can they deal with the threat?” Green Cow
      said as she ran back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have to get word to the boss, but he is currently in the Alliance. I
      have no idea when he’ll be back. I hope those out there can put an end to
      this. If they don’t, we are surely done for!” Cheap Sheep wore a bitter
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean by done for?” a voice asked from behind, startling them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned around and saw Han Sen. They happily exclaimed, “Boss, you
      have returned!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s happening?” Han Sen checked the perimeter outside the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A host of enemies have come, wishing to attack us. There aren’t many of
      them, but they each look very strong. Even Lady Gu looks quite dim,” Cheap
      Sheep said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hm, let’s take a look.” Han Sen wasn’t rushing proceedings. He took Cheap
      Sheep and Green Cow to a tower so they could observe from up high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blind Man wouldn’t suddenly alert Han Sen for no reason. The enemy had to
      be strong, and they had to have come explicitly for him. Acknowledging
      this, he wanted to get a better look at those who were coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked out of the window and saw fourteen shura. Each one was
      mounted atop a creature. He couldn’t discern how strong the shura were,
      but the creatures were definitely super creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Weird. The shura might be able to enter the shelter, but their abilities
      here are limited. They can’t even absorb geno points. The treasures here
      have no effect on them. It should be very difficult for them to tame
      creatures, so how have they been able to bring so many super creatures to
      heel?” Han Sen saw Qing Ya leading the shura, and then thought, “It is the
      New Community, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen watched them come, Sha Linjia brought the shura and super
      creatures before Shadow Shelter. Shadow Shelter was a small place, and it
      had little in the way of defenses. Any super creature ought to have been
      able to destroy the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you people, and why have you come?” Gu Qingcheng asked Sha
      Linjia.
    </p>
    <p>Sha Linjia coldly answered, “Do I need a reason to kill?”</p>
    <p>
      After that, he gestured with his hand. Then, thirteen of the shura behind
      started charging forward. They were going to try to destroy the shelter
      without any mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Want me to save you one?” Sha Linjia asked Qing Ya, who was floating
      mid-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No thanks. You know I don’t take pleasure in killing, and the leader
      approves of that,” Qing Ya said reservedly.
    </p>
    <p>Sha Linjia grunted, and then rode his beast towards Gu Qingcheng.</p>
    <p>
      The New Community had done a lot of research on Han Sen They knew all
      about Shadow Shelter, and so they wished to destroy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sha Linjia did not care about any of the other beings there, but he did
      know Gu Qingcheng was the only one who could compromise the attack. So, he
      wanted to deal with her personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gu Qingcheng! I have heard you were the master of Elysium Shelter. You
      must be strong, so show me what you’ve got!”
    </p>
    <p>Sha Linjia jumped off of his beast and threw a punch her way.</p>
    <p>The beast continued on its own, running towards Shadow Shelter.</p>
    <p>
      Shura could only make use of physical powers. Although they could ride
      proficiently, doing so in combat wasn’t particularly useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shuras were like that, as well. When they neared a target, they
      leaped off the backs of their mounts. The creatures then went off towards
      Shadow Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, their purpose was not the mindless destruction of the
      shelter. They wanted to kill and consume the creatures within.
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn’t think Han Sen was in the shelter at the time. They thought
      they could conquer and claim the shelter for themselves, and whenever Han
      Sen returned, take him out then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the shelter and teleporter were destroyed, though, Han Sen would spawn
      somewhere else whenever he returned. They would lose Han Sen, and so they
      did not want to completely destroy the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “F*ck you!” Gu Qingcheng’s face looked cold as she drew her bronze sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bronze sword she wielded was strange. It wasn’t a beast soul, and
      neither was it a geno weapon. She always carried it around her waist, but
      never seemed to make use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day was the first time they all saw it. It was four feet long, and it
      was different from the styling of modern swords. It did not have a hand
      guard, and the whole blade was one creation. While it looked very cheap,
      it also looked very overbearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blade had many strange symbols engraved into the metal. They did not
      look like something that had been added after the sword’s creation,
      however. They looked like something that already existed on the metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gu Qingcheng drew that blade, she seemed to change. She usually had a
      mysterious persona, but now she was like a king on the battlefield. Simply
      looking at her felt like a grand crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng expressionlessly swung her sword. The swordlights cast were
      like curved moons, as their destructive properties were unleashed on the
      incoming shura and super creatures.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      When the power came against a shura or super creature, it blasted them
      away. All the while Gu Qingcheng maintained her stance and position,
      almost unmoving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked by what he saw. Now he understood how she had managed
      to get out of Elysium Shelter on that day. The powers of that sword were
      quite frightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen briefly made some calculations. Even if he was to make use of
      Fallen Slaughter, he couldn’t do something so great.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is no wonder she was the leader of Elysium.” Still, Sha Linjia was not
      scared facing such power. He stared at her, and as he did, his muscles
      suddenly expanded in size. His veins bulged and his eyes turned red.
    </p>
    <p>
      That red spread all across him, until he burst into a living blaze of red
      fire. It was similar to Han Sen and his God geno core, truth be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought this was weird. He had seen many shura engage their Shura
      Change, but in the past, it had always only made them stronger. It didn’t
      enable them to unleash special powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the red fire was strong enough to unleash powers. It was supposed to
      be impossible for the shura to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng acknowledged this, too, and she frowned as she stared down
      the red fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will deal with her. The rest of you lot can deal with the others.” Sha
      Linjia started walking towards Gu Qingcheng, wreathed in red fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng fired another swordlight, trying to stop the creatures and
      shura that were now coming. But Sha Linjia waved his fist, and when it
      came into contact with the swordlight, he destroyed it. The fist then went
      right against her sword.
