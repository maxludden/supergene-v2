<h2>Back to the Extreme King</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2356</h3>

<p>Han Sen had obviously planned this.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen let Nine-Headed Bird strike first, Nine-Headed
Bird had a chance of winning. That was why Nine-Headed Bird agreed
to the bet. But Han Sen’s dragon area defeated Nine-Headed Bird’s
first attack, and the moment he stopped attacking was the moment he
sealed his loss.</p>
<p>“Can I go now?” Han Sen smiled at Nine-Headed Bird.</p>
<p>“Get lost! Do not let me see you ever again.” Nine-Headed Bird’s
face was contorted with anger. Without waiting for Han Sen to
respond, he turned and flew away.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. He hadn’t expected Nine-Headed Bird to
keep his promise, but it was a good thing he had.</p>
<p>The dragon area’s power came from its connection to water; if
Han Sen was sealed inside the Suppress Demon Coffin, he would lose
his connection with the sea and get pulled into the demonic
abyss.</p>
<p>Unless Han Sen used his super god spirit body, he wouldn’t have
been able to defeat Nine-Headed Bird.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Han Sen flew up into the air and headed
back to Half-Star Bay. He didn’t say another word to Xius.</p>
<p>If Miss Mirror hadn’t left yet, that was where she would be. Too
many elites wanted to get their hands on the Ancient God Origin.
Staying next to Miss Mirror would be the safest thing for Han Sen,
as it would prevent others from trying to take the item away from
him.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen could probably escape, Bao’er was still with
the Extreme King. So, Han Sen felt obliged to remain.</p>
<p>He flew for a few hundred meters, but suddenly, he felt the
crackle of lightning all around him. A giant that looked like
either a demon or a god hung there in the clouds. A hand came
slapping down towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>The hand slowed down, and the air around Han Sen concentrated
until it was as dense as a steel board. Han Sen couldn’t tear
through the air. He couldn’t move his body.</p>
<p>“A deified elite!” Han Sen felt a chill, and he prepared to
fight back. Just as he was about to lash out, a sword-light
appeared and slashed across the big hand.</p>
<p>“Argh!” The giant in the clouds screamed and pulled his hand
back. The god-like eyes looked down to where he had been struck. A
beautiful woman holding a copper sword in her hands had
emerged.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror!” Han Sen was so happy.</p>
<p>That giant stared at Miss Mirror, then disappeared. He seemed to
be afraid of Miss Mirror, and he obviously didn’t want to make an
enemy out of her.</p>
<p>“I cannot believe Ancient Water God selected you.” Miss Mirror
came before Han Sen and looked at the Ancient God Origin he was
holding.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that why you brought me here?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“I was just here to try my luck. I didn’t place any hope in you,
so I didn’t expect you would succeed,” Miss Mirror said simply.</p>
<p>Han Sen touched his nose and looked at the blood-red sea.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. In a
neutral tone of voice, she said, “Extreme King ships are here. They
will take over the planets that were touched by Ancient Water God’s
blood.”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror hadn’t come for the Ancient God Origin at all; she
just wanted to claim the system that had been flooded with Ancient
Water God’s blood.</p>
<p>After Ancient Water God’s failure and the subsequent dispersal
of his blood, the primitive creatures of these planets would now
grow strong. Even barren planets would now flourish because of
Ancient Water God’s lifeblood.</p>
<p>The watery area that came from Ancient Water God’s blood had an
incredible lifeforce. It could grow many scary xenogeneics. This
was exactly what the Extreme King needed.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the Ancient God Origin wasn’t as important. It
could only be used to grow one strong water element elite. It was
nothing compared to the value of an entire system.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Miss Mirror back to the ship, and he saw that
the Extreme King’s ships were splitting up to guard the individual
planets of the system.</p>
<p>Han Sen found the blood kirin was on their ship, and he was
surprised that it had sat and waited for him the entire time. It
obviously wasn’t the mindless beast Han Sen had believed it to
be.</p>
<p>When the blood kirin saw Miss Mirror, it looked hostile and
scared.</p>
<p>Han Sen could guess why. Ancient Water God had moved Han Sen far
away, and the blood kirin wouldn’t listen to Miss Mirror’s
commands. She must have used some sort of trick to get the creature
onboard a ship.</p>
<p>“This woman is too tricky. I don’t know what she wants. Why
didn’t she tell anyone else that I’m not actually Bai Yi?” Han Sen
stroked the ring on his finger and thought to himself, “It most
likely has something to do with this ring. But she didn’t force me
to take the ring off. Why?”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t understand. He knew he would have to stop
thinking about it. He brought out the xenogeneic gene of the
Silver-Winged Dragon and swallowed it to refine it.</p>
<p>Duke Gene +1… Duke Gene +1…</p>
<p>The Duke gene announcements kept sounding-off in Han Sen’s head.
He received ten Duke genes in total.</p>
<p>“If I can get a few more King class xenogeneic genes, then I
won’t have to worry about The Story of Genes.” Han Sen was both
happy and worried.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t remain on the planet for long. She had been
needed during the takeover, but she wasn’t in charge of building up
the planet. Her task was finished before most of the Extreme King’s
ships even arrived.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Miss Mirror had many elites around her, but they
didn’t appear in her proximity.</p>
<p>Taking such an important system would be a bloody affair.</p>
<p>The Ancient God wouldn’t give up the place easily, so both sides
would make sacrifices in the attempt to claim the system. The price
would be high whether they succeeded or failed.</p>
<p>After going back to King’s Kingdom, Han Sen took the blood kirin
with him back to Planet Water Zone. Miss Mirror didn’t detain him,
and she said nothing more to him. No one else sought to trouble
him, either.</p>
<p>That made Han Sen even more worried, though. He didn’t know what
was going through Miss Mirror’s head, and he had no idea what her
ultimate goal was.</p>
<p>“I can just put Bao’er back in the sanctuaries. That will be
safer for both of us,” Han Sen thought in irritation. He would need
to take Bao’er back from Lan Haixin.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could find Lan Haixin, though, she came looking
for him. She looked fairly moody, too.</p>
<p>“Bai Yi, did you forget something?” Lan Haixin found Han Sen in
the garden and looked at him with a raised eyebrow. She didn’t say
what she wanted explicitly because she was still suspicious about
Han Sen’s identity.</p>
<p>“Last month, on the ninth. I remember. But Miss Mirror took me
somewhere to do something. I had no choice,” Han Sen said with a
shrug. He then thought to himself, “It is fortunate I have Bao’er
as a spy.”</p>
<p>“It is good that you remember. But since we missed it, we must
now wait another two months. You better behave over the course of
the next two months and stop giving me trouble.” After Lan Haixin
spoke, she left. She didn’t even spare him a second glance.</p>
