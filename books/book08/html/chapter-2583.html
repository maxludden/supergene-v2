<p>Han Sen and the others had explored this island many times
before. Aside from the mushrooms, there was nothing special to be
found.</p>
<p>They had searched the broken battleship repeatedly, but nothing
important was ever discovered.</p>
<p>“Where is the white tiger taking us? Is he going to take us away
from here somehow?” Han Sen wondered, intrigued.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was soon disappointed. The white tiger wasn’t
planning on leaving the island. They came to a giant mushroom that
was around three stories tall. The tiger walked up to the mushroom
and slapped it. The mushroom fell over, revealing an underground
cave that was hidden beneath.</p>
<p>“There’s a cave below here?” Han Sen murmured in surprise. He
didn’t know what material this island was made of, but the rocks
were so hard that not even deified powers could shatter them.</p>
<p>Making a cave there would be very difficult.</p>
<p>The white tiger disappeared into the cave. After a while, it
came out. It made some noises in Han Sen’s direction, as if it was
hurrying him to go in.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw that the snakes weren’t too far behind them. If they
entered the cave now, the snakes might arrive before they had a
chance to leave. That would thrust them into the maw of another
nasty fight.</p>
<p>But as Han Sen thought about it some more, he realized that they
had little choice if they wanted to stay on the island. The snakes
would be their enemies as long as they remained on the island, and
there was little they could do against the snakes in their current
state.</p>
<p>Everyone disembarked the white whale. Han Sen shrank the white
whale and put it away, then dropped into the underground cave. The
others couldn’t do anything except follow.</p>
<p>They had been inside the cave for less than thirty seconds when
the snakes arrived, covering the ground like a black blanket. Many
of the slithery serpents poked their heads into the cave.</p>
<p>Because there weren’t any mushrooms, however, the snakes didn’t
seem to be very interested. After looking around the cave briefly,
they crawled back out.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others continued to follow the white tiger. Han
Sen soon realized that the cave was a natural formation, not a
man-made hollow. That made him feel very relieved.</p>
<p>If it was man-made, then whatever made the cave could be very
dangerous to them. If it was natural, on the other hand, there was
a chance it was just an ordinary cave that could help them avoid
disaster.</p>
<p>“Why would that white tiger be so kind, bringing us to a cave to
avoid disaster? Or is this part of a greater conspiracy?” one of
the pirates asked.</p>
<p>“Regardless, we need to keep walking. Unless you want to fight
those monsters outside the cave, that is,” another pirate said.</p>
<p>“Stop talking! We might as well explore the cave fully. Maybe
that is where the white tiger stores its treasure. Who knows? We
might be able to get something good out of it.”</p>
<p>The pirate crew was chattering among themselves when suddenly,
they felt something emerge from deeper in the cave.</p>
<p>In fact, they did not see anything. They just felt something
come forward.</p>
<p>The next second, everyone felt a chill. Their clothes billowed
as a cold wind rushed up from deeper in the cave.</p>
<p>The cold wind wasn’t very strong. It was the type of wind that
would only make tree leaves flutter gently, so it wasn’t harmful to
Han Sen’s group. However, the wind made everyone feel
weirded-out.</p>
<p>One of the pirates said, “Weird. There is wind underground. Does
that mean there is an exit?”</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu’s eyes brightened, and he said, “We’re assuming
that we’ve been in the Black Hole Spider’s stomach, right? If the
ocean is the creature’s stomach, there should be some organs that
connect to it. Maybe accessing those organs can lead us to an
exit.”</p>
<p>“Shit! Does that mean the wind was a fart?” a pirate exclaimed,
turning green.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu’s explanation made the others feel uncomfortable.
But more than anything, they were just surprised. If this was true,
they had a chance of escaping this hellish place alive.</p>
<p>Escaping through the creature’s intestines did not sound
pleasant, but it would be better than dying. No matter how nasty
the trip might be, life was more important.</p>
<p>Everyone was full of hope. Their morale was given a big boost,
and they followed the tiger at an eager pace.</p>
<p>The tunnel twisted and corkscrewed, but in general, it was
headed down. Some places were wide enough to let a plane fly
through. Other places were so narrow that only one person could
squeeze their way through at a time.</p>
<p>As they traveled, the cool wind continued to blow over them from
below. It was a very soft wind at first, but the deeper they went,
the stronger it became. The stone walls on either side of them were
smooth, which was undoubtedly a result of their exposure to the
constant wind. It was like they had been caressed for a billion
years.</p>
<p>And then, they heard another wind-like sound. It came with the
noise of distant, rumbling thunder. It was like an endless
thunderstorm raging with the echoes of breaking space. The pirates
felt as if their eardrums were about to pop.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the wind wasn’t strong enough to hurt anyone. It
was just ominous.</p>
<p>“This is wrong. If this tunnel leads to the creature’s guts,
then it cannot keep farting this much.”</p>
<p>“Maybe this Black Hole Spider has an upset stomach?”</p>
<p>“Please use your brains. Even if its stomach was upset, it would
still need something to digest. That’s what makes you feel sick. We
have traveled all this way, and yet, we have only found dry rocks.
There is nothing.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you think this place is?”</p>
<p>“If I knew, I wouldn’t be talking to you about it.”</p>
<p>The pirates were arguing amongst themselves again. They weren’t
arguing for fun, but they clearly needed to blow off some steam.
They were trying to alleviate the stress of the situation.</p>
<p>Han Sen had known early on that these weren’t the spider’s guts.
And in the presence of all the wind made him feel quite
strange.</p>
<p>If there was no exit down below, then the presence of wind was
weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to ask the white tiger, but the white tiger only
continued to run forward. It ignored them. So, getting information
from that creature would be unlikely.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The wind was coming up again. This time, it blew against them
with greater strength. The force of the wind twisted the faces of
the pirates into a variety of odd shapes. The skin of their faces
flapped against their skulls with the wind.</p>
<p>The Marquise class Fang Qing Yu was almost blown away
completely. His body lifted into the air, and Han Sen had to reach
out and grab him to keep him from blowing away.</p>
<p>“The wind is getting stronger here. Should we keep going?” The
group drifted to a stop and looked at Han Sen. He was their
leader.</p>
<p>Han Sen was hesitating, too. He didn’t know much about the white
tiger. Following the white tiger down into this random hole in the
ground might not have been such a good idea, after all. If he could
go back in time, he would not have led his people down there.</p>
<p>As Han Sen pondered their current circumstances, the white tiger
noticed they were no longer following. It turned around and rumbled
at Han Sen, telling them to hurry.</p>
<p>“How about this? While the snakes haven’t reached us yet, so
this seems like a safe place to rest. You guys stay here while I
scout ahead,” Han Sen said to Fang Qing Yu.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t care about the lives of the Extreme King knights
and pirates, but he did care about Gu Qingcheng and Ning Yue.</p>
<p>“Let us come with you.” Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon decided to
follow, having no interest in staying behind.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave me here!” Ning Yue jumped forward. She clung to Han
Sen’s legs, knowing that following Han Sen was better than staying
put.</p>
