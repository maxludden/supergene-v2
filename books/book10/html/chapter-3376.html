<p>Suddenly, the whole place was very bright. A sharp light lit up
the entire universe. Within its brightest part, one was not able to
see anything.</p>
<p>“I am in the light looking for darkness. Under the holiness,
things might be dirty. Perhaps that is the final compromise.”
Within the light, a goddess revealed herself. She was shining a
trail through the stars.</p>
<p>“Light Goddess!” Han Sen was shocked by her sudden appearance.
He was already still reeling from the surprise of Moment God coming
to help him. He did not expect Light Goddess would also appear.</p>
<p>“Now, watch my amazing attempt at humor. For I want you to start
calling me Dark Goddess.” Light Goddess displayed an evil smile.
She was glowing. Suddenly, all that was bright went dark. The
entire world was plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>“Without the dark, there can be no light. If you follow the
light, you will be led to where you want to go.” As he heard the
voice of Light Goddess, Han Sen knew he had a spirit light for
guidance. He listened to Light Goddess’s voice and went to the
light.</p>
<p>The whole world was dark. The Break World beasts that looked
like a tide could not see where Han Sen was. They were like
headless flies hitting each other. They were even going so far as
to kill each other.</p>
<p>“Light Goddess, save your game! In front of me, your light world
is useless.” A mean voice emerged from the black, tinting the
void.</p>
<p>It was a red, Kirin-like gene race. Its body was wreathed by a
red light. Wherever it went, everything was dyed red.</p>
<p>The Break World beasts in the dark could not see anything
before, but they could now see that which was colored red. It was
not like a real graphic, but it enabled them to find out just where
Han Sen was.</p>
<p>“Shock… wave…” Before Han Sen could react, a giant-looking
strong body was standing behind him. A godly voice came down,
punching into space.</p>
<p>The whole of space felt as if it had been rocked by a tsunami.
The group of Break World beasts was punched. They flew into space.
Suddenly, the entire area became one huge vacuum zone.</p>
<p>“Crazy Battle God.” Han Sen recognized the God Spirit’s shadow.
It was one of the 12 Annihilation-class God Spirits called Crazy
Battle God.</p>
<p>“Go!” Crazy Battle God did not look back. His strong body was
like a big wall blocking the Break World beasts that came. Roaring
sounds were heard all over the place.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Han Sen did not know why the God Spirits were all
deciding to help him, but there was no time left to waste. He bid
his thanks and flew away.</p>
<p>“I would not advise you to get ahead of yourself. Do not think
too much about what we are doing here today. It will only
disappoint you. Why? Well, for one, we are not here to save you.” A
cold voice was heard. Empty God appeared behind Han Sen. He was
holding a golden arrow in space.</p>
<p>If he did not have the golden arrow, Han Sen’s spine would have
been severed.</p>
<p>Han Sen developed a wry smile as he shook his head. He broke
space and kept on going until he was finally away from the crowd of
Break World beasts. The 33 skies were in chaos.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see six Annihilation-class main gods do battle
with the Break World beasts.</p>
<p>A voice sounded in Han Sen’s head. “Go! Bao’er’s body has her
father’s blood. Even half of the geno hall’s blood will permit
Bao’er to fall into Qin Xiu’s hands. By doing that, Qin Xiu will
stir, wake up, and come to understand Bao’er’s true identity. We
should just leave.”</p>
<p>“Do you mind telling me where we’re going after we leave?” Han
Sen asked.</p>
<p>With Qin Xiu’s power being what it was, he could not think of a
place to hide. Qin Xiu would want to kill him.</p>
<p>“The sanctuaries,” Chaos said. “By going to the sanctuaries, we
will be able to buy ourselves some time. Qin Xiu is already in
control of the geno prototype armor, but his body has not been
rebooted yet. Before that happens, he does not have the power to
make the last step.”</p>
<p>“This whole last step thing has been mentioned more than a few
times,” Han Sen said. “It would be nice if someone took the time
out to explain what it is to me. Can you tell me what the last step
is?”</p>
<p>“Now is not the time to talk,” Chaos said. “Right now, we should
just go to the sanctuaries in case Qin Xiu finds out about
Bao’er.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had to take Bao’er back to the sanctuaries. The two
universes had been fighting for so long, but peace had been able to
prosper in the sanctuaries. There was wind there, and there was
sunshine there. It was like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Galaxy Teleportation and returned to his home in
the Alliance. He sat his butt down and did not want to get up ever
again.</p>
<p>He had spent too much power had. In the end, he risked his life
to use Galaxy Teleportation.</p>
<p>Bao’er stood next to Han Sen. Her big eyes stared at his black
crystal armor.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The black crystal armor broke. It fell away from Han Sen to
recompose itself in the shape of a woman’s set of armor. She
proceeded to touch Bao’er on the head.</p>
<p>Bao’er was confused, but she did not avoid her.</p>
<p>“Chaos, what is going on?” Han Sen sat on the floor,
gasping.</p>
<p>Chaos shrugged with her shoulders and said, “Nothing. I did
something. Qin Xiu knows and should be called Human Alpha.
Something has made him really mad. He is so mad that he will want
to kill Bao’er and not just me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Chaos with a conflicted look. He did not know
what Chaos did to Human Alpha to make him reincarnate many times
yet still go on with the desire for killing her daughter.</p>
<p>Killing people’s children was not something beyond Qin Xiu’s
capacity for evil. If it was not entirely necessary, Qin Xiu might
not go through with it.</p>
<p>“Do not look at me like that. It is not solely my fault. Back in
the day, Bao’er’s father…” Chaos seemed to know she had exposed a
buried secret. She changed the subject by saying, “You just need to
know that Qin Xiu will not let Bao’er go. You and Wan’er combined
can defeat Qin Xiu while he has not completed the final step, but
Wan’er has a strong connection with Qin Xiu. Using her to break Qin
Xiu seems like it would be impossible. Before that can happen, Qin
Xiu will not give you another chance.”</p>
<p>“In that case, what do you think we should do next?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“It depends entirely on Bao’er. Only she can beat Qin Xiu now.”
Chaos looked lovingly at Bao’er and touched her head again. She
seemed rather sad.</p>
<p>“The chance you speak of cannot be the gourd seed, can it?” Han
Sen asked with a weird look.</p>
<p>Chaos laughed. “That was not a gourd seed. That was the super
gene seed me and Bao’er’s dad researched. It was only
half-finished. It was never completed, but don’t worry. Bao’er has
the genes of me and her father. With her genes, the ability to make
a super gene seed is hers. It can be made, assuming we have enough
time. When Qin Xiu makes the final step, Bao’er can fight him.”</p>
<p>“Aside from doing that, is there no other way?” Han Sen did not
want such an important responsibility to fall to Bao’er.</p>
<p>Chaos sighed. “Even if there is only a one in 10,000 chance of
pulling this off, I would rather opt to take it than let Bao’er
risk her life. Qin Xiu is special, but I know for sure only Bao’er
is capable of defeating him.”</p>
<p>After that, Chaos looked at Han Sen. She seemed to understand
his will. She shook her head. “There is no need to be cross. I am
just saying this. After all, you should know how scary Qin Xiu is
by now. You practiced The Story of Genes too. That was the first
life of Qin Xiu, and it was made by Human Alpha.”</p>
<p>“What? The Story of Genes was made by Qin Xiu?” Han Sen’s eyes
opened wide. He looked at Chaos in utter disbelief. One could have
squeezed an egg into his mouth.</p>
