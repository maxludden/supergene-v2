  Han Sen was very curious about that sword light rain. Although people said King Bai had destroyed the sword light, Han Sen didn’t think the reality of what had happened was quite that simple.

Han Sen summoned the Siren Virgin so that she could take a look at the sword light rain. He also told her about the sword light that had appeared atop Rot Bone Mountain’s peak. He didn’t reveal that he was the one who had destroyed the knoll atop that mountain, however.

When the Siren Virgin heard what he had to say, she looked startled. She silently turned to observe the sword light rain.

“Do you know what this sword light is?” Han Sen asked with a frown. The Siren Virgin had been silent for a long, thoughtful minute.

Then she looked back at him and said, “Mad Sword. For a long time, even talking about him was considered taboo among the Extreme King. He wasn’t one of the Extreme King’s nobility, and he didn’t even have a king body. But his sword skills were beyond talented. He was just a normal swordsman, and yet, he became deified. He beat countless elites of the Extreme King.”

“I know that,” Han Sen said.

“Have you wondered about why a scary elite like this was never really made famous outside of the Extreme King?” the Siren Virgin asked.

“I have given that some thought, and I think it is pretty weird. It doesn’t really make any sense. My best guess is that the Extreme King trapped him here. He was never allowed to go beyond the borders of the Extreme King’s domain,” Han Sen said.

The Siren Virgin shook her head. “You have guessed half of it correctly. Mad Sword never left the Extreme King. He actually was famous among outside races, but they knew him by a different name.”

“You mean, Mad Sword used an alias in his exploits across the universe? Why would he do such a thing?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

The Siren Virgin shook her head. “I don’t know. I investigated Mad Sword, but I only learned that he did something that made the Extreme King despise him. Many people in the Extreme King severely dislike him.”

After that, the Siren Virgin looked at the sword light rain like she was looking out to sea. She said, “If I am correct, it’s possible that Mad Sword isn’t completely dead. This sword light rain might suggest that he may be reborn.”

“You mean, Mad Sword was trapped in the “Pride and bones are made” stone? That sword light was Mad Sword himself?” Han Sen asked, raising an eyebrow.

“It was probably just his will. I bet King Bai has a pretty nasty headache right about now. If that guy is reborn, the Extreme King will descend into chaos. That’s good. The more chaos, the more benefits you and I can reap,” the Siren Virgin said. She ended with a laugh.

“If Mad Sword only left his will behind, then he might have decided to escape the region entirely once he was freed. That wouldn’t shake up the Extreme King society very much at all,” Han Sen said, disagreeing with the Siren Virgin.

The Siren Virgin shook her head. “Why would he run? Right now, here in the realm of the Extreme King, the sword light is everywhere. All he needs to do is attach to some creature here and possess it. Any effort the Extreme King make to find him will probably turn out to be impossible. There is no need for him to run.”

Upon hearing the Siren Virgin say this, Han Sen felt his heart jump. After a long moment, he asked, “Might Mad Sword seek to choose me?”

“There are so many people in the Extreme King. Mad Sword doesn’t require someone talented, so there’s no reason for him to go after a prince. You think too much,” the Siren Virgin said.

Despite her reassurance, Han Sen did not feel safe. It made him worry quite a bit.

Luckily, when the sword light rain stopped, nothing weird had occurred in Planet Water Zone. However, Han Sen was paranoid for the duration of the rain.

Due to the sword light rain, the next part of the exam was delayed seven days. The passion for the event had slowly withered away. Perhaps it was due to the sword light rain incident, but the Extreme King’s supervisors weren’t very focused on the exams. And although the sword light rain had stopped, the exams remained on pause.

The whole atmosphere of King’s Kingdom was tense. The realm was placed on lockdown, and even Han Sen’s Planet Water Zone was investigated by a number of different departments.

The workers might not have known what they were looking for, but Han Sen figured that the Extreme King’s supervisor was still searching for Mad Sword’s will.

“What a scary guy. He only had his will left, but even so, its reappearance has caused this much of a ruckus. I could die a happy man if I was that influential.” Han Sen sighed after sending away a few more officers.

Han Sen didn’t travel anywhere. He focused on leveling up his Dongxuan Sutra. He wanted to get that to King class as soon as possible.

Although Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra were easier for him to level up, Han Sen still wanted the Dongxuan Sutra to be leveled up first. Han Sen sensed that a crisis was near, and the Dongxuan Sutra was the skill he was most familiar with. It was something he could rely on.

The Dongxuan Sutra’s power was irreplaceable. No other geno art could match its offensive capabilities. In a proper fight, Han Sen could fight without Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and even The Story of Genes. Doing so never really affected Han Sen’s fighting power.

But without the Dongxuan Sutra, Han Sen’s fighting power was noticeably decreased.

The other three geno arts were plenty strong, but the Dongxuan Sutra was the most compatible with who Han Sen was as a person. It matched his personality. That was the primary reason that Han Sen always fell back on the Dongxuan Sutra. It was simply comfortable.

A crisis was brewing, and he had promised aid to Ning Yue, as well. He needed to gain more power, and he needed to do so quickly. The most straightforward way to achieve this was to take the Dongxuan Sutra to King class.

Han Sen practiced in the training room for an entire month, using the Dongxuan Sutra the entire time. His whole body felt like part of a machine.

Yes, it was a machine.

From Han Sen’s point of view, the Dongxuan body made the entire universe seem like one giant machine. Grass, forests, stone, water, bugs, fish; they were all gears inside this machine.

Each cogwheel was a different size and shape, but they all fit together. They all connected to each other. When one cog spun, it spun the cog next to it. And that new one that spun would spin the next cog, and so on.

Han Sen was just a single piece amidst an unfathomably vast machine. With the power of the Dongxuan Sutra, however, Han Sen had a wider view of the cogs and how each one related to the others.

Using the geno art felt amazing. Two objects in the real world might have no visible connection, but Han Sen could see the power that was transferred between them. The only thing Han Sen didn’t know was exactly how he could affect those relationships.

Han Sen understood that if he was to alter the power-exchange of the cogs, he would require King area powers.

Every King area affected the way the cogs were spun. A King area could make them go faster or slower, or even spin in reverse. All the rules of nearby cogwheels were affected, creating special area pockets.

Han Sen had been trying to push his own cogwheel and alter the way it spun, but he couldn’t get it to work. He couldn’t affect the mechanism that controlled the entire universe, and thereby create a new King area.
