  Han Sen was convinced that he had strong potentials. After all, he had already gained super geno points.

However, in order to tap into his potentials, he had to work extremely hard. He could understand his weaknesses and strengths better under extreme conditions with Overload. This way, he could develop his full potentials.

A high level of understanding of his own body was necessary. He had to know exactly where he could work harder. Otherwise, he might push himself too hard so that his body would collapse.

The process of practicing Overload was a process to learn how to control his body. He had to make sure that each bone, muscle, and body cell were working at the limits, but not over the limits, which was the ultimate goal.

Certainly, Han Sen had not reach that level just yet. Because of Jadeskin, he had much better understanding and control of his body then an average person, which was conducive to his Overload practice.

On the other hand, when he continued to push his limits, Han Sen felt he was making a big progress with Jadeskin as well. It seemed that he was about to complete the first stage.

"Again…" When he had recovered, Han Sen once again turned on the gravity trainer and tried to make his body function better in sweat and heat.

Han Sen had control himself very well so that his body would not be damaged, thanks to Jadeskin.

"Brother Han, I will have a small party tomorrow. Would you come?" Wang Mengmeng asked Han Sen with her eyes wide.

"What party?" Han Sen was puzzled.

"You will know after you arrive. Please come!" Wang Mengmeng said.

"Alright," agreed Han Sen. Wang Mengmeng rarely asked him of anything. Since it was just a party, of course Han Sen would not turn her down.

Wang Mengmeng was delighted and told Han Sen the time of the party and that she would come to pick him up.

When it was time, Han Sen realized that the party was not on campus. Wang Mengmeng took Han Sen to a private garden with food and drinks already arranged. Han Sen found a spot and started to eat, while Wang Mengmeng went to change.

"Han Sen, how come you're here?" someone exclaimed when seeing Han Sen in the garden.

"Tang Zhenliu!" Han Sen was also dazed. He did not expect to see Tang Zhenliu there.

"You're connected to the Wangs?" Tang Zhenliu sat down next to Han Sen and asked.

"Wang Mengmeng is my schoolmate. She was the one who invited me to this party," Han Sen answered.

Tang Zhenliu looked at Han Sen oddly and said, "You're not telling me that you don't know today is her birthday…"

Han Sen was surprised and said, "Today is Mengmeng's birthday?"

"You really don't know? Ha-ha, it seemed that you two were quite tight." Tang Zhenliu patted Han Sen on the shoulder, laughing.

Han Sen was a bit concerned. Had he known that it was Wang Mengmeng's birthday, he would have prepared her a gift. But it might be too late for that. Han Sen searched his pockets and found nothing that he could give her.

"Tang, do you have an extra present? Could I borrow some?" Han Sen looked to Tang Zhenliu expectantly.

"I only have one gift. In addition, how can you borrow the present?" Tang Zhenliu said with his lips curled.

Han Sen wanted to say something, but he saw more people entering the garden. They were mostly in their 20s and 30s.

Among the men and women, Han Sen spotted Son of Heaven and Huangfu Pingqing.

The birthday party was successful. And nobody paid Han Sen any mind. Han Sen continued to fill his stomach, while Tang Zhenliu was socializing with men and women in the high society.

Son of Heaven had gained much more repose. He was no longer that domineering and overbearing person in Steel Armor Shelter.

"When do you plan to evolve?" As Han Sen was eating, Son of Heaven walked to him and asked in a plain tone.

"In two or three years," Han Sen paused and answered. He felt like Son of Heaven had become a different person. Maybe he was possessed or something.

Son of Heaven curled his lips into a strange smile. He raised a glass to his lips and sipped some wine. "I know what you're thinking. But since I entered Second God's Sanctuary, I no longer treated you as my enemy. My true enemy could only be an evolver, which you are not. As long as you do not enter Second God's Sanctuary, you will not understand what true strength is and how naïve you are."

"In the future, if you are sent to Dark Lord Shelter, you can join my team. You're a good archer and I need someone like you. Evolve soon and stop playing house in First God's Sanctuary," Son of Heaven said and patted Han Sen on the shoulder. Then he walked to a corner and sat down, observing the crowd in the party.

Han Sen was surprised by Son of Heaven's behaviors. If Son of Heaven wanted to kill him, he would not feel much. However, Son of Heaven no longer cared. This shift was alarming to Han Sen.

Han Sen could feel that Son of Heaven no longer thought of him as an opponent. The guy treated Han Sen as a stone in the hand of a Go player. A player would never treat the stone as his opponent, or his enemy.

"You only evolved a few years earlier, and that does not mean you are superior." Han Sen curled his lips and did not treat Son of Heaven too seriously. If he entered Second God's Sanctuary before he maxed out on his super geno points, that would be a real loss.
