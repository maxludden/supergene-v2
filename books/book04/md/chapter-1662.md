  “After ten years, she hasn’t grown up. Don’t you think that’s strange?” God’s Retribution said.

Han Sen sighed, and he knew this was something he couldn’t hide from. He was prepared for such questions, though.

“That being said, what is the grudge between Han Jinzhi and God’s Organization? Why do they want to kill Han Jinzhi and his heirs?” Han Sen did not talk about Bao’er and just shifted the subject.

“We have investigated this for a while, but we don’t have answers. We can only presume Han Jinzhi stole something from them, but they don’t actively go around killing others. They simply want this item back. If they wanted to kill mercilessly, you’d have been killed a long time ago.”

That was a sickening thought. Han Sen asked, “What did Han Jinzhi steal?”

“I don’t know. It must be some kind of gene or something. Otherwise, they wouldn’t care about you and Littleflower. They want to investigate Littleflower’s body once they get their hands on him.” God’s Retribution then paused for a moment. “How about we co-operate? It’ll benefit you. Just one geno armor, right? You already have a spare.”

Han Sen gave a wry smile and said, “Brother, if I had it, I’d give it to you. But I really don’t have it I really did not kill Snake Witch. I have never even seen her before.”

God’s Retribution stared at Han Sen for a while, and it really seemed that he wasn’t lying. God’s Retribution frowned. “Well, if it wasn’t you, who else might have killed Snake Witch?”

“I don’t know. Many can do that in the Alliance, right?” Han Sen said.

God’s Retribution said, “Not many. Aside from a few members in Blood Legion, it’d be people who had geno armor. Not many geno armors exist in the Alliance, and they are mostly controlled by God’s Organization. Aside from you, I’m not sure who else might have done it And God’s Organization is certain it was you.”

“If I’m right, the creatures in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary go to the Alliance when they level up,” Han Sen said to God’s Retribution.

God’s Retribution did not hide this. He nodded and said, “You are correct The Fourth God’s Sanctuary is the end. Once you’re done here, you’re back to the Alliance. But don’t think that going to the Alliance requires geno armor. That is incorrect. Creatures that go from the Fourth God’s Sanctuary to the Alliance will have their fitness decrease. That is because evolving the body requires energy. It will, however, purify your genes. Your body will end up stronger, but your fitness will be much lower. Then you practice, and eventually you level up and get your geno armor.”

“How many members of Blood Legion have geno armor?” Han Sen was not surprised by what he was being told. He already knew this stuff.

“None. Blood Legion is different from normal creatures. You know we have the powers of blue blood. When we go back to the Alliance, we don’t rebuild our bodies. So, we don’t generate geno armor.” God’s Retribution gave a wry smile.

Han Sen was shocked by this revelation. He did not expect Blood Legion’s members to be that special.

Han Sen thought the blue blood power was special, yes, but that its effectiveness was reserved for the sanctuaries.

“Let me tell you a secret, while I’m still here.” God’s Retribution squinted his eyes and said, “The creatures that rise from the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, aside from Blood Legion and rare creatures, are captured by God’s Organization.”

“That isn’t a secret. I already know that.” Han Sen lifted his lips.

“Then you must not know that the creatures of God’s Organization, when they generate geno armor, disappear and never appear again.” God’s Retribution squinted his eyes.

“Really?” Han Sen was shocked and his face changed. Those words made him understand a lot.

The leader of the New Community told Han Yufei that if he generated a geno armor, he would know the truth.

Stay Up Late told Han Sen that the Alliance was a part of the sanctuaries. The sanctuaries were something more akin to a kindergarten. They protected different races.

And after the things Han Sen had seen with Guardian Spirit, he now understood a lot more.

“Gathering geno armor can force you out of the Alliance? That means when Dad gets his geno armor, he’ll face a crisis.” Han Sen was shocked.

“That isn’t right, though. If things are like that, then why would so many geno armor elites be in God’s Organization?”

“Wait, no. The creatures in God’s Organization are not the real geno armor elites. They are just creatures that reached the Fifth Sanctuary; they haven’t generated their own armors. The geno armor they possess comes from places like the Hero’s Spirit Hall, left over from geno armor elites.” Now Han Sen understood everything.

After Han Sen understood this, he almost jumped out of his chair with his racing heartbeat.

In that case, Han Yufei thought he was finding answers, but he was actually dying.

Now Han Sen knew why God’s Organization was strong. They still could not control the Alliance. They wanted to, but they couldn’t.

Or they just did not have the chance. Once their members got geno armor, they would be out of the Alliance. And that would be useless.

The creatures without geno armor were strong, but they were not strong enough to be invincible. Even if they used a set of armor that didn’t belong to them, they could not use its entire strength. At least the members of Blood Legion could fight them.

Han Sen wished he could find Han Yufei and tell him the truth. Tell him not to generate the armor. Otherwise, their family would never have a reunion.

Based on what Han Sen had seen in the Hero’s Spirit Hall, many elites had been lost in the outside. The chance Han Yufei could come back was very low.

But Han Sen didn’t know how to contact his father. He didn’t even know how to contact Blind Man.
