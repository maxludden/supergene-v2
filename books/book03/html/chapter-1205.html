<p>Han Sen looked at Xie Qing King as if he was looking at some hideous monster. No wild super creature had ever rattled him as much as the spirit before him was now doing.</p>

<p>He partially believed himself to be dreaming, thinking it to be utterly ridiculous for a king spirit to take up the hobby of drawing crude comics.</p>

<p>Han Sen opened the comic, dubiously titled “Overbearing President Love Luv Looove,” and began reading it. The art, to Xie Qing King’s credit, was wonderful.</p>

<p>The protagonist of the comic was actually a fellow named Xie Qing King, perhaps unsurprisingly. The spirit had obviously gone to great lengths in this self-admiring portrayal of himself. He was dressed up in similar attire to what he was now wearing, and wholeheartedly believed to be cool, and the opening panels had him surrounded by a number of voluptuously shaped women.</p>

<p>Strangely, these women did not look human, though.</p>

<p>“Are these lady spirits?” Han Sen asked, while pointing at them.</p>

<p>“They sure be king spirits, yo,” Xie Qing King said.</p>

<p>Han Sen was actually rather surprised. He hadn’t suspected a king spirit could look upon other king spirits in a horny way.</p>

<p>“My dope is targeted at the younger generation. But tell me, bruh, could ya’ help out a crib spirit of yours and help me release it on that thing you call Skynet?” Xie Qing King said.</p>

<p>Han Sen helped him with the release, but did not want to associate himself with the comic. So, he made an account on Xie Qing King’s behalf. He was worried at what others might think of him if folks genuinely believed Han Sen was the one who drew it all.</p>

<p>After that, Han Sen took Bao’er back to Ghost Mountain. He believed remaining with Xie Qing King any longer would drive him insane. Silver fox had been gone ever since he received the fox Life Geno Essence, so Han Sen also fancied trying to find him on Ghost Mountain.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Han Sen let all the other humans out at Holy-Sword Shelter, except for Queen. There were too many people crowding the underground shelter, and Han Sen wanted a bit more space.</p>

<p>To scale Ghost Mountain, Han Sen rode atop Golden Growler and took Bao’er with him. Strangely, the super creatures on Ghost Mountain were nowhere to be found. It seemed as if they had all disappeared.</p>

<p>Han Sen traveled across the entirety of Ghost Mountain and confirmed this. Even the ones he had previously met were no longer around.</p>

<p>“What happened?” Han Sen wondered.</p>

<p>If there had been a great battle, surely there would have been signs. But it was as if they had all been abducted, vanished into thin air without leaving a trace behind.</p>

<p>The blood-wing beasts were still there, but their king was gone.</p>

<p>“What happened?” Han Sen had no idea what had taken place.</p>

<p>Even if the king spirit shelter on the mountain had tried to expand to conquer and rule over its surrounding landscapes, there should have been signs of such a thing happening. But there were no clues to what had actually occurred. The landscape seemed to be the same as it was the first time Han Sen had been there.</p>

<p>Han Sen continued traversing the slopes of the mountain, and just when he started to worry over the wellbeing of the silver fox, he saw a purple light illuminate the night sky.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried to look over to where it originated, but it was too far for him to scan. So, he summoned his wings and decided to fly there.</p>

<p>The purple light was a good distance away, and he had to leave the borders of Ghost Mountain completely to get to it. It was a purple mountain, and when he got to take a closer look, Han Sen was more than just shocked.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought the mountain had simply gotten bigger due to his proximity to it. But when he stopped for a moment, and noticed that it continued to grow, he realized it was doing just that: the mountain was growing bigger.</p>

<p>Han Sen never thought a mountain had the possibility of growing.</p>

<p>It would have made sense if there was an earthquake currently raging, but there was no such thing. The lands all around were quiet, and it was just that one purple mountain rising out of the ground, becoming bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t go any closer to it, as he figured himself to be too old to attempt something reckless. He was hovering above a field, so he could see everything well enough and did not have to go any closer to watch what was happening.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw many small creatures emerge, all heading for the purple mountain. Then, he saw bigger creatures going that way. They were headed there with visible excitement.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried to grab a snake he saw, but the snake dodged his grasp and looked angry. That was okay, though. The snake seemed fairly normal and of its own mind. It hadn’t been possessed or tainted by some other phantom force or anything.</p>

<p>“If they’re not under a spell, perhaps some treasure is enticing them there. Did Little Silver and the other super creatures of Ghost Mountain go that way, too?” Han Sen mulled over the questions while staring at the purple mountain.</p>

<p>Not thinking there to be any immediate danger, Han Sen flew closer. If there was treasure, he wanted it. At the very least, he could lend a hand to the silver fox if he needed it.</p>

<p>With Han Sen’s power having reached its current heights, he figured he could deal with any threat that presented itself to him. He had the ability to take on emperor spirits, after all, so he reckoned he’d be fine.</p>

<p>And as long as Han Sen did nothing to provoke the creatures, they’d probably be too focused on what they had come for to pay him any heed. They appeared to be very single-minded in their near-rabid approach to the purple mountain.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw wolves, ants, and birds heading for the area.</p>
