<p>The jian’s body was delivered another gash as a consequence of
the saw sword. After the slash, Han Sen was sent flying away. He
struck a shield. The jian’s body pierced through the shield. He was
now behind the shield.</p>
<p>The little girl came out of nowhere. She clutched the handle of
the jian and pulled Han Sen away from the broken shield.</p>
<p>“Why are you here to mess things up?” Han Sen was depressed. He
saw see the woman was holding the saw sword and slashing toward
them. It was just above the little girl’s head. Han Sen could only
use his Jadeskin’s Break World power to stop the saw sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought The Story of Genes’ power would be able to
combat the saw sword, but the power of The Story of Genes was too
much. The shockwave he was able to create was enough to obliterate
the little girl.</p>
<p>The jian and saw collided. Han Sen and the little girl were
shaken away. The little girl spilled some blood, but her eyes were
still very wild. She held onto Han Sen and struggled to get up off
the ground.</p>
<p>“If you are not Qin Xiu, do you mind telling me who you are?”
Han Sen ignored the little girl and used his will to talk to saw
sword.</p>
<p>“I am Qin Xiu, but I am just a doppelganger. I am here to claim
Soldier Weapon Sky.” The woman sounded like Qin Xiu was talking
through her.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you already able to reach the 17th sky? Why must you
come back down here to claim dominance over the first sky?” Han Sen
now understood why he felt like it was Qin Xiu but not exactly Qin
Xiu. It was just a clone.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu said, “I can tell you that the 33 skies were returned to
their origins. Any creature can become the leader of the 33 skies
and take control of the geno tablet, but something must be done
before that can be achieved. They must take the first sky and be
the leader of the first sky so that they can fight for the geno
tablet.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Han Sen’s eyes squinted.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu explained all of this because he was very confident. He
was not afraid of Han Sen learning the truth and trying to fight
him.</p>
<p>“If you already understand, then show me what you are really
capable of,” the woman said. “Let me see the true breadth of your
power.” She then slashed her sword toward Han Sen and the little
girl.</p>
<p>“I do not need any power to deal with you.” Han Sen used
Jadeskin. He borrowed the jade sheep’s hollow structure.</p>
<p>Outside of the ice-jade jian was an ice-jade shield. The
ice-jade shield was plated in a hexagon, beehive-like patterns. It
covered Han Sen and the little girl. The sword struck the ice-jade
shield and cut it, but it did not, however, harm Han Sen and the
little girl inside.</p>
<p>“It would appear my Break World rate is over 3% now. That is
brilliant. That also means my Break World power has reached the
level in which it becomes solid.” Han Sen was absolutely
delighted.</p>
<p>All these attacks were not useless. He was finally able to use
the features of the jade sheep’s body and apply them to his
Jadeskin. It enabled the Jadeskin’s Break World power to become
solid.</p>
<p>The woman coldly grunted. The saw sword kept slashing. Sword
after sword, it was like a storm that kept slashing downward.</p>
<p>Han Sen generated more ice-jade shields. He kept blocking the
attacks of the sword again and again. The ice-jade shield was
broken again and again.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Very powerful Qin Xiu. Even just a cloned
sword is this powerful. If the real Qin Xiu became a sword, how
powerful would he be?” The Jadeskin breakthrough was not coming to
an end.</p>
<p>The hollow structure of the jade sheep’s body had many different
types. Now, Han Sen was using a beehive mode. He was trying to put
more of the hollow structures into Jadeskin.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s Break World rate became higher and higher. The saw
sword left smaller and smaller marks across the ice-jade
shield.</p>
<p>When Jadeskin’s Break World rate reached 60%, a mysterious and
old spell started to appear on the solid ice-jade shield.</p>
<p>The spell was weirdly shaped. It was not like ordinary text, but
it had an ice-jade mind. It was hard to describe how clean it
was.</p>
<p>When Jadeskin generated a Break World spell, the saw sword was
unable to cut the solid ice-jade shield. Han Sen was no longer
losing the battle.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the saw sword and said, “Qin Xiu. If you want
to kill me, come and fight me yourself. You are too naive to
believe a petty clone has what it takes to bring me down.”</p>
<p>The woman stopped speaking. She kept striking Han Sen again and
again, but she was blocked by the ice-jade jian’s Break World
power. She was unable to damage the jian.</p>
<p>Regarding the 33 skies, a man was standing in front of the geno
tablet. He was looking at the geno tablet, remaining totally
motionless.</p>
<p>The geno tablet was like a big screen made of many smaller
screens. All of the scenes kept changing across the geno
tablet.</p>
<p>One of the screens displayed Han Sen doing battle with a woman.
The man was watching that fight.</p>
<p>While the man watched the fight, the geno tablet suddenly
started to glow. Not just the man, but also the countless number of
creatures that populated the two universes could see the
headstone-like 33 skies have its geno tablet glow. It lit up the
two universes.</p>
<p>When the geno tablet’s light grew weaker, the main and reverse
universe noticed the light source was the first line of the geno
tablet’s text.</p>
<p>Seventeenth Sky Leader: Qin Xiu</p>
<p>“Qin Xiu is Qin Xiu. He took one sky so soon. He became a leader
of 17 skies.” Some old antiques who knew about the 33 skies were
shocked.</p>
<p>At the same time, Qin Xiu’s body emerged from the geno tablet.
He saw the man in front of the geno tablet.</p>
<p>“God. Long time no see.” Qin Xiu squinted his eyes as he looked
at the man.</p>
<p>“If I was able to, I would opt to never see your face again,”
God Hall Leader coldly said.</p>
<p>“You are scared. You are scared I will become the master of the
geno tablet. What a shame. You are God Hall Leader already. You
have the geno hall. You cannot also be the master of the geno
tablet. If you could, you would stop me.”</p>
<p>“Even if I was not here, you could not become the geno tablet’s
master,” God Hall Leader said without moving.</p>
<p>“Who do you think can actually stop me?” Qin Xiu asked with
confidence. “Do you think those Annihilation-class God Spirits you
employ are capable? You should know they can do nothing to stop
me.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they would be enough. Maybe they would not be enough. I
will not know until I try it. Besides, this world has many powerful
creatures.” God Hall Leader remained looking very cold.</p>
<p>“The powerful creatures you are talking about does not include
him, does it?” Qin Xiu’s eyes looked at the geno tablet. They
landed on the image of Han Sen.</p>
