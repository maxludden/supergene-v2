	<p>Han Sen was afraid that the crab might snatch his part after it finished its own, so he summoned the angel,
		feeding the remaining silver eel to her.</p>

	<p>The Archangel was the main force to help him hunt super creatures, so it was essential to Han Sen that she
		transform again. Sacred-blood meat was not a waste on her.</p>

	<p>In addition, this silver eel was as thick as a bucket and more than 30 feet long. Han Sen&#8217;s part was about
		18 feet long. It was too much for him to eat up, while the Archangel was eating with ease. Her mouth moving
		nonstop, she was not affected by the toxins at all. The silver eel disappeared quickly.</p>

	<p>Han Sen then had the time to look at the beast soul of the silver eel. Han Sen felt he was a bit too lucky
		recently. As long as he hunted a sacred-blood creature, he would gain a beast soul, which even scared Han Sen
		himself a little bit. He was afraid that he might have used up his luck and would become unlucky.</p>

	<div class="tables">
		<table class="beast">
			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Sacred-Blood Silver Eel</td>
				<td>(Aquatic Mount)</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<!-- Type of beast soul of sacred-blood silver eel: water mount. -->
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Water mount!&#8221; Han Sen became overjoyed. He was just wondering how he could come back to this place
		again. After all, humans could not stay in the water for a long time and this place was so deep in the water.
		Han Sen was not sure whether he was able to dive so deep himself. With the silver eel mount, it would be easy
		for him to come down.</p>

	<p>The only shortcoming of the beast soul was that it could not be used on the land. However, that did not trouble
		Han Sen at all. He had the golden growler on the land and did not need anything else.</p>

	<p>As the Archangel was enjoying the needs of the silver eel, Han Sen checked the crystal sailboat out and climbed
		to the deck.</p>

	<p>The sailboat was so big and carved out of crystal. However, nothing could be seen inside the boat, which made him
		feel quite weird.</p>

	<p>The golden crab had disappeared in a cabin, so Han Sen wanted to see whether there was other stuff in the cabin.
		However, before he came to the entrance, the golden crab suddenly rushed out, waving the pincer fiercely at Han
		Sen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Buddy, don&#8217;t be so nervous. I am only looking around and do not mean you harm,&#8221; Han Sen
		stepped back and said with a smile, seeing that the golden crab was just guarding the entrance and did not chase
		him.</p>

	<p>However, the golden crab did not know what he was talking about, threatening him against approaching with its
		pincer.</p>

	<p>The more reluctant the golden crab was, the more Han Sen wanted to see what was in the cabin. However, he looked
		at the entire crystal sailboat and found that entrance was the only one. Since it was guarded by the golden
		crab, there was no way that Han Sen could enter.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How come you are not poisoned?&#8221; Han Sen became upset, as he was not able to see what was inside the
		boat, he tried to stick his head up and look.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was no match of the golden crab, so he had to retreat temporarily to think of another way. Currently, Han
		Sen was very curious about the thing inside the crystal boat and was not in a rush to leave.</p>

	<p>In addition, he wondered if those people from Blackgod Shelter were still guarding outside, so it was unnecessary
		for him to go out of the water.</p>

	<p>When I go out, I will definitely try to wipe out Blackgod Shelter. Han Sen decided that as long as Blackgod
		Shelter was still there, his grudge would never disappear. In addition, Goddess shelter was surrounded by ocean
		in three directions. In order to develop, it must expand to the icefield, which meant he must have his own place
		here.</p>

	<p>Now that Blackgod did him a service by becoming his enemy, Han Sen would not be polite with him. He was
		calculating how he could kill the group of people and take their place for himself.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had heard from Li Xinglun that Blackgod was the strongest among the three forces on the icefield with the
		most resources. Li Xinglun and the other force could only be its match when they united, maintaining the balance
		between the three.</p>

	<p>Previously, when Starwheel Shelter was under the attack of spirits and the other shelter was distracted, Blackgod
		Shelter did not try to help. They probably wanted to unite the entire icefield after Starwheel Shelter was wiped
		out.</p>

	<p>It was not easy to conquer Blackgod Shelter, obviously. Bloodgod himself was stronger than Han Sen, so he was
		very likely someone that had almost maxed out on sacred geno points. His fitness index should be more than 120.
	</p>

	<p>In addition, Han Sen was deterred by the knife skills of Blackgod. Up until this moment, Han Sen still failed to
		understand how the strike disappeared, and if he did not understand it, he would suffer again when faced with
		Blackgod.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If I could not beat him, I would rob him. Blackgod Shelter has such a large territory that I don&#8217;t
		believe they could guard all the places if I attacked one by one.&#8221; Han Sen made up his mind to take care
		of the Blackgod territory when he got out.</p>

	<p>When he returned to the lower level of the boat, he saw that the Archangel had almost finished the body of the
		silver eel, with only a head left. Han Sen had a thought and stopped the Archangel from her feast, taking her
		back into his sea of soul.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked around and hanged the head of the silver eel on a rope in front of the ship and hid on the right
		flank of the ship himself.</p>

	<p>After waiting for several hours, he indeed saw the golden crab sneaking out. However, because there was only a
		single rope, the crab could not climb up with its claws. It had to jump up to reach the head of the eel with its
		pincer. Seeing that the golden crab having left the crystal Han Sen secretly climbed onto the deck and sneaked
		into the cabin.</p>

	<p>When the golden crab was under the silver eel, it jumped twice but did not catch the head of the silver eel. Han
		Sen felt content secretly. He had calculated the height of the jump of the crap, and he deliberately made it
		hard for it to reach. However, the crab would not give up either. This way, he had enough time.</p>

	<p>Standing in front of the entrance, Han Sen looked inside the cabin. It was a hall inside. Everything was carved
		out of crystal, looking very delicate and beautiful.</p>

	<p>In the middle of the hall, the crystal table was placed. Han Sen originally thought it was a table, but when he
		entered, he found it was no table, but a crystal treasure box, with the crystal lock on the outside.</p>

	<p>However, the lock was not locked, so it was not really effective.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Is there some kind of treasure of the pirate or curse of the phantom boat?&#8221; Han Sen suddenly felt
		hesitant, not sure whether he should open this giant whistle box. It was so weird that there might be something
		dangerous inside.</p>

	<p>Greed and curiosity eventually beat his logic. Han Sen heard the noise of the head of the silver eel falling and
		knew that the golden crab would return very soon. He gritted his teeth, summoned Snow Charmer, stood next to the
		cabin door, and asked Snow Charmer to open the crystal box.</p>

	<p>The spirit was absolutely loyal to her master. After hearing the command, she took off the lock and lifted the
		lid of the box.</p>
