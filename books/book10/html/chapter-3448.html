<p>With Human King’s power, even if the 12 Annihilation-class main
gods were to come to challenge him, there was a very high
possibility that they would not be able to move freely in his
presence.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er did not seem to be affected by his power in the
least. She stood where she was with her eyes wide open. She madly
stared at Human King.</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s daughters are indeed all special.” Human King looked
at Ling’er. The power in her body shifted from flesh power to a God
Spirit power. It was a pretty strange spectacle.</p>
<p>It was the sort of power that typically belonged to a Reboot
Blood-Pulse God Spirit. Although Human King did not combine the two
powers into one yet, using both powers was not too difficult.</p>
<p>There was a spirit power all over his hand. His hand took on the
form of a spirit. He reached out to latch onto Han Ling’er, but she
jumped. She avoided Human King’s hands. She was in the air. Her
feet kicked toward Human King’s head. She shouted, “Because you
bullied Little Gold Gold, I will stomp you to death!”</p>
<p>Human King’s movements were faster than Han Ling’er’s. His
spirit hand moved to grab Han Ling’er’s angle. He grabbed her ankle
and pulled her down. He held onto Han Ling’er.</p>
<p>“Little kids that keep on fighting are not at all cute. Plus,
women should be gentle. That is far more likable.” Human King used
God Spirit powers to trap Han Ling’er in place. Han Ling’er was no
longer able to move.</p>
<p>“Let me go… You are a bad man…” Han Ling’er was scared, and she
started to scream.</p>
<p>She had not practiced much. She only had Han Sen’s genes. She
could not really beat Human King. If Human King was not prepared,
her spirit power would not have damaged Human King.</p>
<p>“If you keep screaming, I will lock you inside a coffin. You
will be trapped in there for a billion years.” Human King could not
do anything to Han Ling’er. His power was sufficient to trap Han
Ling’er, but he could not make Han Ling’er stop moving and
talking.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Ling’er continue to kick and scream, Human King
reached out his hand with a desire to shut down Han Ling’er’s will.
Suddenly, he heard another shout.</p>
<p>“Let go of my sister!” A man was there. He was wreathed in white
flames as he approached. It was like he was carrying a mountain on
his shoulders as his legs trembled in his slow walk forward.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that person, Human King was given a fright. “Han
Sen’s son, Han Littleflower! What is wrong with this guy’s
children? Under my rules, they are still able to walk around Space
Garden. Are they really Han Sen’s real daughter and son?”</p>
<p>Littleflower gasped as he approached. His eyes looked as if they
were on fire. He stared at Human King and shouted, “Let go of my
sister! Did you not hear me?”</p>
<p>Human King did not want to waste any more time than he had to.
For watching what was inside the golden door, his geno prototype
armor had been badly damaged. It would take a long time to fix.
That made his combination time need to wait even longer.</p>
<p>Human King waved his hand. It had the power to unleash and
strike Littleflower. Littleflower’s body was like a mountain. He
was blasted away to break the buildings around.</p>
<p>Before Human King went to capture Ji Yanran, Littleflower came
out of the ruins. He walked out again. Human King could see
Littleflower’s clothes had been torn. The power on his chest was
broken, but when he came back, his wounds had already healed. Aside
from the broken clothes, one could not see the wounds on his chest
anymore.</p>
<p>“I did not want to kill you. If you really want to die, then do
not take it out on me for doing what I have been tasked to do.”
Human King walked to Littleflower as he spoke.</p>
<p>From what Human King could see, Han Littleflower was weaker than
Han Ling’er. She was free from his rule power, and Han Littleflower
had to walk against his rule power. That was the difference between
their levels.</p>
<p>“You touched my little sister. Do you know what that makes you?
It makes you my enemy. You are now an enemy of me, Han
Littleflower. Plus, I have no relations with you.” Han Littleflower
gnashed his teeth. He walked forward. Beneath the heavy pressure
put upon him, his body was still able to remain upright. The white
fire on his body was burning harder.</p>
<p>“Fine. Two is enough for me. We do not need another.” Human King
waved his fist. This time, Human King wanted to kill. Earlier, he
just wanted to subdue him and get him to back off. He had not
wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>That punch had a power that could destroy the sky and the
ground. Littleflower crossed his arms to deflect the punch, but his
body looked as if it had just been hit by a scary power. A deep
trench was cleaved through the ground, cutting all the buildings in
half. He was batted back all the way back into a forest. It was
like even the forest had been cut open.</p>
<p>“Big Brother!” Han Ling’er was in a hurry to me. She was
furious, so she struggled wildly in Human King’s arms. She wanted
to bite Human King a little.</p>
<p>Human King got fed up and annoyed with her. He used his hand and
placed it against Han Ling’er’s head. He sealed her seven senses.
She could no longer scream or move.</p>
<p>He wanted to go back for Ji Yanran, but his heart suddenly
jumped. He looked over in a certain direction. He peered into a
forest. a scary white flame appeared. It was like a volcanic
eruption that fired up into the air to break the sky.</p>
<p>Human King’s rule power did not work where the white flame had
come from. The substances that were frozen were now starting to
move again.</p>
<p>Seeing Littleflower manage to emerge from the forest, it seemed
as if this time, Littleflower was looking a little different.</p>
<p>Littleflower had inherited the Super King Spirit body from Han
Sen, but that did not mean he would only have the King Spirit body.
Littleflower had learned Sacred Leader’s holy body power, and he
had also been through the sanctuaries. He had managed to level up
his super gene. Because Han Sen’s genes were too strong for him, he
had never been able to his Super Spirit God body. But his power and
personality were hot forces that swirled inside him. He had been
waiting for a chance for his genes to break through.</p>
<p>“Get your stinking hands off her, you damn dirty man. Let my
sister go!” Littleflower emerged from the forest. He was not like
Han Sen or Han Ling’er. He had evolved to obtain a spirit body.</p>
<p>The white flame on his body became a holy shadow. It was like a
holy angel that had provided shelter to his body.</p>
<p>The feelings that were so heavy like a mountain were now gone
from Littleflower’s body. What replaced it was a powerful sort of
holiness.</p>
<p>“What is up with this family? Is Han Sen’s family not even a
human family that hails from the sanctuaries?” Human King looked at
Littleflower. It really did make him wonder.</p>
<p>Human King believed his evolution path was the correct way
forward. He had used the Blood-Pulse Sutra to refine and perfect
every generation. He had completely erased the crystallizer lineage
within him, which was something inside the genes of humans that
hailed from the sanctuaries. He had refined World King God’s and
Qin Xiu’s blood to have the body he possessed now.</p>
<p>From what he could best tell, the crystallizer’s blood was cheap
and useless. If Han Sen was a human from the sanctuaries, he would
have the blood of a crystallizer. So, how could he have so many
powerful children?</p>
