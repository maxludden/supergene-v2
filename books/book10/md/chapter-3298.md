Ancient Devil peered at the geno tablet for a very long time. He then turned around and left.

Han Sen had been watching Ancient Devil intently for a long time. He immediately followed him. As Ancient Devil was flying, he suddenly disappeared. It was like he was able to slip into an invisible tunnel no one else could enter.

Han Sen was shocked by this. He teleported to the point where Ancient Devil vanished, but there was nothing there to find. At least, Han Sen was unable to discover anything.

“Damn it! How did he manage to leave this place?” Han Sen was a little depressed by this.

Suddenly, the location where Ancient Devil vanished started to showcase a strong vortex that was spinning fast. It was like a whirlpool that kept increasing in size. It gradually turned into a swirling spirit power.

Han Sen was quite shocked. He did not think he had a chance, but he was suddenly feeling hopeful.

He did not know what the swirling spirit power was, but he was fearless at this point. He gnashed his teeth and rushed inside.

The swirling spirit power did not last long. After Han Sen drilled inside of it, the power started to fade. It quickly disappeared.

The swirling spirit power did not harm Han Sen. He felt as if he was sent through a space tunnel. The moment he emerged from it, he was shocked by what he saw.

Ancient Devil felt bad. Back when things had been rebooted, he was able to be like big sky demon or Bury Path God, sacrificing some power to live. He had not done that. Instead, he used the rebooting of the universe as a chance to use a glitch while it rebooted to be reborn and maintain his full memories.

It was a very dangerous play. Keeping the memories of being reborn was difficult. Not to mention that, he did not even know what kind of creature he would end up as. He did not know what kind of body he would end up having after being reborn. He did not know if he could end up breaking the world.

Plus, Ancient Devil did not know anything about the other universe. Compared with others, the only advantage he had was of his memories from his previous life, but the memories he had might not work in another universe.

It was a big risk, but Ancient Devil still chose to be reborn. It was because Ancient Devil knew the other universe had a geno tablet too. Only by being there could he have the chance to get close to it. Otherwise, he would have to be like Bury Path God and break through the 33 skies with his power. It would be even harder than being reborn.

Without the power of the leader, Ancient Devil did not think Bury Path God could break through the 33 skies. So, he was taking a risk.

Ancient Devil thought he was very lucky, and he was right. He had a new body. It was weaker than a child of the universe of kingdoms, but it had a lot of potentials.

The magical world of the sanctuaries surprised Ancient Devil. The power and levels obtained in the world of the sanctuaries were not high, but the effect of a body’s evolution provided a huge effect that Ancient Devil could not believe.

The experiences he had there were useless, so Ancient Devil had to grow up. He had to reach the zenith of the purpose he was striving for. When he went to the geno tablet, he noticed what the leader had once said was correct. If he was not Reboot class, he would be unable to access the geno tablet.

He exited the 33 skies. Ancient Devil’s soul returned to his body.

Ancient Devil had only just managed to break the world. With his power, the 33 skies were very close to the geno universe, but he still could not get in.

Ancient Devil did have an item that he had managed to bring with him when he was reborn. That item had to be used with Break World powers too. So, Ancient Devil had waited until this exact day. When he finally managed to break the world, he used the item to gain direct access to the 33rd sky.

That item could only be brought into the 33rd sky by Ancient Devil’s spirit. His actual body could not go there.

Because he was so depressed, when Ancient Devil’s soul returned, he did not disconnect the treasure’s power. He remained frozen for a bit.

At that moment, Han Sen felt the movement of the treasure. He used that treasure to get out of the 33 skies.

Han Sen’s luck was impressive. He had a pure spirit body. The item only worked on spirits. Otherwise, even if he felt the treasure, he could not go back.

Ancient Devil only froze for a moment. He quickly stopped being frozen and withdrew his power.

The item that had lost Ancient Devil’s power did not return to normal. It was still shining with a god light. It was becoming stronger.

“What is going on?” Ancient Devil frowned and looked at the black crystal floating in front of him. It was the size of an egg.

That thing had followed him for a long time. It had never left his side. Nothing strange ever happened to it.

Ancient Devil gathered up a Break World power and put it into the black crystal. He wanted to stabilize the black crystal, but his power was rejected. Ancient Devil was even more shocked by this.

“What is going on?” Ancient Devil frowned and looked at the black crystal. The black crystal had a black swirl floating around it. The black flame was growing stronger.

Ancient Devil weirdly looked at it. He said to himself, “Weird. This item is the geno prototype replica given by the leader, but a replica is just a replica. It should not have the actual soul when it is just a geno prototype. It only has a few features of the prototype. Therefore, why would it keep running?”

Suddenly, Ancient Devil thought of something. His face changed. “Does that mean there was another spirit in the 33rd sky? Did it enter the black crystal? No. Bury Path God and the others cannot gain access to the 33rd sky yet. Not even someone from the geno hall can access the 33rd sky.”

Ancient Devil looked at the burning black crystal. He had a strange expression on his face. The scary flame wrapped up the crystal. He could not see what was inside the black crystal.

Han Sen was as shocked as Ancient Devil at this moment. After his spirit body when through the 33rd sky’s swirling spirit power, he ended up inside the black crystal.

Han Sen was very familiar with black crystals. This one was just like the black crystal before it became the black crystal armor.

Han Sen almost thought he had entered the black crystal armor. When he looked closer, he realized he had not. That black crystal was not the same as the black crystal armor. It was like the one Horizontal Evil gave him.

He was affected by the black crystal. The Story of Genes started to run. It made Han Sen both shocked and happy.

No matter how hard he had worked in the past, his spirit body was unable to use geno arts. Now, the black crystal was making The Story of Genes run. Han Sen loved it. He quickly admired his body. He used the power changes to cast The Story of Genes’ skill.
