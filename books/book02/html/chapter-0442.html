    <p>
      Han Sen stared at the black bird and the giant snow spider that were about
      to be strangled to death. If he gave them a blow at the right moment, he
      might be able to get himself a sacred-blood beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, before Han Sen found the perfect opportunity, there was a beast
      roar from the other end of the ice valley followed by loud hoofbeat.
    </p>

    <p>Is there another sacred-blood creature? Han Sen was shocked.</p>

    <p>
      Very soon, Han Sen found he made a mistake. There were no sacred-blood
      creatures, but arrays of ice-armored beasts running his way like trained
      soldiers. There were at least 300 to 400 of them. The ice-armored beasts
      threw themselves at the monster with tentacles, biting the tentacles. The
      monster swept its tentacles across and got rid of a few ice-armored
      beasts, but more came up to attack it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the ice-armored beasts, Han Sen saw giant polar bears, unicorn
      wolves, and wendigos. Each creature looked very strong and fierce.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the force was a red-striped white tiger on the back of which
      sat an elegant woman in glamorous priest robe. The woman had purple eyes
      and hair, holding a short staff that seemed to be made of crystal, her
      eyes fixed on the monster, black bird, and snow spider.
    </p>

    <p>
      The priest lady pointed her staff at the monster. The polar bears, wolves,
      and wendigos roared loudly and threw themselves at the monster.
    </p>

    <p>
      By nature, creatures of lower levels had fear toward creatures of higher
      level than them, so they would not dare to fight a more advanced creature.
      However, those polar bears, ice-armored beasts, and wendigos that seemed
      like mutant creatures had no fear toward the sacred-blood monster of
      tentacles. Under the command of the priest lady, they took death calmly
      and fought the monster together.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Spirit!&#8221; Han Sen was hiding behind an ice wall, watching the
      priest lady in surprise. The spirit had almost transparent skin. Her eyes
      were like cats and her ears were pointy. There was no way she would be
      mistaken for human.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen only knew there was an aristocrat spirit in the spirit shelter on
      the mountain, which should be her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creatures also looked similar to what Han Sen had heard. However, Han
      Sen had no idea what she wanted to do. Judging by the number of the
      creatures, she should have used all the force of her shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although there were a lot of creatures on her side, they were not the
      monster’s match. The ice-armored beasts could not even break the skin of
      the monster. The attacks from the mutant creatures only left some shadow
      marks on the tentacles, which did not seem too effective.
    </p>

    <p>
      To the contrary, once the monster swept its tentacles across, a few
      ice-armored beasts would be blown away and injured seriously if they were
      not killed already.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was wondering why the aristocrat spirit did this, she suddenly
      raised her crystal staff.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crystal staff issued ripples which gradually wrapped her body.
      Momentarily, all of the runes on her robe were brought to life and started
      to glow, surrounding her with light.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the light gradually became dim, Han Sen saw what she looked like and
      stared his eyes wide.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, the aristocrat spirit was covered in a suit of crystal
      armor imprinted with red patterns. The armor looked mysterious and
      glamorous, making her look even more divine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crystal staff had now turned into a crystal spear with red stripes.
      The aristocrat spirit held the spear backward on the side of her body, her
      eyes fixed on the monster of tentacles.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill!&#8221; The aristocrat spirit shouted coldly. Her mount, the
      red-striped white tiger quickly ran toward the monster of tentacles and
      reached it immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Holding onto the two sacred-blood creatures and under the siege of so many
      mutant creatures, the monster of tentacles could not focus, although it
      was not injured. It failed to see that the red-striped white tiger had
      already come at its head.
    </p>

    <p>
      Riding on the tiger in the air, the aristocrats spirit gazed at the
      monster’s head coldly. The moment when the tiger brushed by the monster,
      the spear in the spirit’s hand eventually moved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like a cold lightning bolt, the crystal spear was stabbed into a squinted
      eye of the monster. With a growl, the monster suddenly waved a dozen huge
      tentacles madly, whipping the two sacred-blood creatures and the mutant
      creatures away.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the aristocrat spirit stayed still. Her tiger leveraged on the
      monster and charged the monster again.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      This time, nothing was distracting the monster, so it noticed the tiger in
      time. A tentacle suddenly blew the red-striped white tiger away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment the tiger was hit, the glamorous aristocrat spirit moved her
      long legs covered in armor. She stepped on the back of the tiger and sent
      her curvaceous figure in the air. Seizing the red-striped crystal spear,
      she stabbed at the other eye of the monster.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The other eye of the monster was stabbed as well, so it issued another
      painful scream. This time, instead of using its tentacles, it quickly
      shrank into the ice water pond, carrying the aristocrat spirit with it,
      making a huge splash.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was dumbfounded. The aristocrat spirit was even stronger than he
      thought. She should have a fitness level around eighty, which made her a
      top aristocrat spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      More importantly, the aristocrat spirit was extremely skilled at martial
      arts. When she was fighting, she had top-notch footwork and spear skills,
      comparable to any human evolver.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shortly, the pond became calm. With another splash, the aristocrat spirit
      emerged from the cold pond, dripping all over. Her purple hair was soaked,
      stuck to the crystal armor, making her look attractive in a different way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw very clearly that the aristocrat spirit had only hurt the
      weakness of the monster, which is its eyes. The monster was only forced
      back into the pond. She did not have the ability to kill it.
