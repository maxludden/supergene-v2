<p>After confirming that there wasn’t any danger, Han Sen reached
his hand out to touch it. The object was hot to the touch, and the
texture of the surface felt kind of like snakeskin or the scales of
some other sort of creature.</p>
<p>But snakes were cold-blooded animals. Their scales were supposed
to feel cool, but this black thing was burning hot. It glowed like
heated steel.</p>
<p>“This thing can’t be alive, can it?” Han Sen knew that was
impossible. The thing wasn’t giving off any lifeforce.</p>
<p>He dug into the sand around the black object, and it was
revealed to be the size of a house when he was all done. When he
saw it in all its splendor, it was absolutely massive, just as he
had expected. And beside the glowing scale was another scale.</p>
<p>“I’m rich… This could really be the carcass of the true god evil
dragon. Maybe the blood coral has grown here because of the
nutrients it can absorb from the evil dragon’s dead body.” Han
Sen’s heart was frantic with excitement.</p>
<p>He wanted to haul the body out of the lake as soon as possible,
but he soon realized that he faced a serious problem.</p>
<p>If a single scale was as big as a room, he couldn’t imagine how
big the entire dragon’s body might be. Han Sen dug for a while, and
he eventually dug under other parts of the blood coral forest. The
dragon’s scale seemed to extend even further under the ground. He
couldn’t accurately gauge how large the creature was.</p>
<p>“This dragon’s body cannot extend the entire length of the
10,000-mile-wide blood coral forest, can it?” Han Sen thought that
must be possible. Otherwise, why would the blood coral only grow in
this area and nowhere else?</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s power, he could easily dig beneath the blood
coral. A large amount of sand could be thrown away with a simple
wave.</p>
<p>But displacing the blood coral itself was too much for him. Han
Sen’s power was insufficient, and all the strength he exhausted
would be absorbed by the blood coral. He had to dig it out slowly,
inch by inch. At that speed, and with Han Sen digging there alone,
it would likely take him a year or two to excavate the dragon.
Digging out the entire blood coral forest would be very
difficult.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t keep digging like this.” Han Sen immediately
realized that unearthing the dragon corpse by hand simply wasn’t an
option. Not to mention that if he continued, Li Keer and Exquisite
were sure to find out what he was doing.</p>
<p>“The matter of the dragon body aside, even this blood coral that
can absorb elemental powers is very rare and precious. The Very
High would desperately want something like that, even if there
wasn’t a true god corpse somewhere beneath it all.” If the Very
High learned about this place and Han Sen’s find, he wasn’t sure if
they would fight him for ownership.</p>
<p>Although the Very High allowed the silkworms to take the
xenogeneics they killed in Outer Sky, true god xenogeneic bodies
were a bit more valuable than the average fare. It was too
tempting, and Han Sen couldn’t predict how things might play out if
his discovery became known.</p>
<p>“I must find a way. How can I take the dragon body and blood
coral without anyone noticing?” Han Sen stopped digging. He
replaced the sand he had disturbed with his digging, hiding all
evidence that he had been there.</p>
<p>After thinking over the matter for a while, Han Sen placed the
strange blood coral into his Destiny’s Tower. Then, he paused to
examine the beast soul he had received from the Space Electric
Eel.</p>
<p>“Deified xenogeneic beast soul Space Electric Eel: Gem beast
soul (chance to evolve)”</p>
<p>“Another gem beast soul?” Han Sen was disappointed. Gem beast
souls could raise the level of another beast soul and heighten its
quality. But in order to use the beast soul, he would need another
beast soul of the same type.</p>
<p>Han Sen had received a gem beast soul from the Sun Raven, and he
hadn’t yet found another beast soul he could use that one on. In
addition, he had no lightning-element beast souls that he could
combine with his most recent prize—the Space Electric Eel’s gem
beast soul.</p>
<p>“What does the ‘chance to evolve’ part mean?” Han Sen was
disappointed to receive another gem beast soul, but the words on
the end of the description had managed to intrigue him
somewhat.</p>
<p>It was a shame the gem beast soul couldn’t be used immediately.
He also had no way of uncovering the secrets of the whole “chance
to evolve” message just yet.</p>
<p>He dragged the electric eel’s body out of the Buried Dragon Sea,
and he found Bai Wei waiting for him on the shore. Han Sen went
over to say hello. Bai Wei was surprised to see that Han Sen had
actually defeated the electric eel. The conflicted emotions visible
in her eyes deepened.</p>
<p>After leaving the sea, Han Sen took the electric eel’s corpse
back to the Star Tree. Once he absorbed the electric eel’s
xenogeneic gene, he noticed that eating the electric eel’s flesh
provided more deified genes than ordinary primitive deifieds did.
He had only eaten one out of the 20 portions of the electric eel’s
flesh, and he had already received two deified gene points.</p>
<p>“It looks like higher class deifieds provide more element genes.
If that is the case, maxing out my deified points shouldn’t be all
that difficult. Leveling up will be far easier than I thought,
actually.” Han Sen kept refining the xenogeneic genes as fast as he
could, all the while thinking about how he might dig up the blood
coral and the dragon’s body.</p>
<p>“The dragon’s body seemed far too large to dig up on the sly,
but I can surely collect some of the blood coral. I can store it in
the sanctuary to keep anyone from discovering it. It might take a
while, but I should be able to dig up all the blood coral by
myself.” Han Sen couldn’t come up with a better idea than that. He
needed to grab any benefit he could get while he was able to.</p>
<p>He rested the night, and when he woke up the next day, he
intended to go back to digging up the red coral. He needed that
blood coral for the castle he was planning to build.</p>
<p>But after yawning and stretching, he noticed that something in
his body felt off.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t really put his finger on the sensation, but
when he looked at his hands, he noticed there was something
there.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Han Sen got a better look at his hands, and
what he saw frightened him. The back of each hand had a black dot
that was around the size of a fingernail.</p>
<p>It looked like a freckle at first glance, but when Han Sen
looked closer, the freckle seemed more like a piece of red coral or
a scale from the dragon’s body. It was black, but it glowed with a
faint red light. The freckle was still somewhat incorporeal,
though. He could still see his flesh through it.</p>
<p>Han Sen swallowed nervously. He quickly checked over the rest of
his body, and he found more freckles growing all over his body.</p>
<p>“What the f*ck? Is this the sign of me growing dragon scales?”
Han Sen knew that something was severely wrong. Those freckles
weren’t painful or itchy, but they were spreading across his
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Dongxuan Sutra to examine the rest of his body,
and he discovered that the freckles were now a part of him. They
didn’t seem to be damaging his body, though. His body and the
freckles were existing symbiotically.</p>
<p>He steeled his resolve and peeled one of the freckles away, but
when the flesh was healed, the black dot returned. More black dots
showing up across his body with every minute that passed. He tried
many ways to remove them, but none of them stuck.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried activating his xenogeneic geno arts, and he even
tried using his super god spirit body. But no matter what he tried,
no method worked to get rid of the black dots. That was especially
surprising since the super god spirit body had worked on pretty
much everything in the past. Now, it couldn’t do anything to remove
the freckles.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this? Even my super god spirit body isn’t
working.” Han Sen theorized that the freckles had something to do
with the blood coral or the dragon body, but he couldn’t accurately
predict what effect the freckles might ultimately have.</p>
