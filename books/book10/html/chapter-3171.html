<h2>Absorbing a Gene Skill</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3171</h3>

<p>The gold wing peacock king swallowed the sonic god bird’s body.
The gold light glowed even stronger. The peacock opened its beak
and made some bird sounds in Zhong Miao Yin’s direction.</p>
<p>Suddenly, shaky shockwaves were felt throughout the place. It
was the sonic god bird’s shaky shockwave from moments before.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Other people might have thought the gold
wing peacock king already knew sonic shockwave, but he knew that
none of the gold wing peacock’s three gene skills were a sonic
element. Thus, it was impossible for it to be using the shaky
shockwave.</p>
<p>Zhong Miao Yin quickly gathered up power and fought the shaky
shockwave. Fortunately, she always used the shaky shockwave. She
was very familiar with it, so she knew how to break it.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Zhong Miao Yin shouted one word and some invisible,
godly power made the shaky shockwave stop nine feet away from
her.</p>
<p>Seeing her appear so powerful, Zhong Miao Yin’s fans swooned
with happiness. Many of them screamed out their support at the top
of their lungs.</p>
<p>Zhong Miao Yin was just as much shocked as they were. Her
shouting involved the demon sound beast gene combination skill
demon sound seal. The demon sound seal was able to restrict the
sonic god bird’s shaky shockwaves. The demon sound beast and sonic
god bird had practiced the sonic sound seal before. She discovered
it was able to stop the shaky shockwave.</p>
<p>This time, the demon sound seal only protected her in a
nine-foot bubble. It had been unable to stop the shaky shockwave
completely. It proved to her that the gold wing peacock king’s
shaky shockwave was stronger than the sonic god bird’s version.</p>
<p>Zhong Miao Yin was shocked. She saw the wings on the gold wing
peacock’s back spread. It had become a gold peacock shield. It
released 10,000 gold lights. It resulted in a sky full of arrows
that came violently raining down on Zhong Miao Yin.</p>
<p>Zhong Miao Yin had a hard time blocking the shaky shockwave. She
did not have any more powers to block the scary, sky full of
arrows. Although she felt bad about doing it, she had no choice but
to concede and depart the space battleground. Thus, she escaped the
crisis of being turned into a hedgehog.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! He used a gene race to beat Zhong Miao Yin, one of
the three big singers.”</p>
<p>“What was that gene race? That was too scary.” “I don’t know who
the owner of the gene race is. Is one gene race really that
powerful? If the owner went and fought, I wonder how powerful such
a combo would be.”</p>
<p>Everyone went to look at who Zhong Miao Yin’s opponent was. When
they saw who it was, they were very surprised. Obviously, the name
Lucky was an alias, but the title God of Wealth was nothing false.
Yet, none of them had heard of a god being this strong before.</p>
<p>When the Yan Kingdom’s people saw God of Wealth’s name again,
they were given a fright. “How is this God of Wealth and its
members so powerful? Earlier, Dollar had used one skill to defeat
the Flying Yan Swordsman. This time, Lucky only sent out a gene
race to defeat Zhong Miao Yin, one of the three big singers of the
Qin Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“What is this God Spirit called God of Wealth?”</p>
<p>“I want to go to God of Wealth Temple to have a look.”</p>
<p>Along with the Yan Kingdom’s people, many other people were
starting to pay attention to the God Spirit known as God of Wealth.
After the list was investigated, they learned there were three
members of God of Wealth taking part in the god fights. One of them
was called Dollar. He was the one who had knocked out Yan Bei
Fei.</p>
<p>Ingot and Lucky had been winning too. No one had been able to
stop them. What was particularly scary about them was that they had
not revealed themselves in the battlegrounds. They had beaten all
of their challengers by merely using their gene races. Many people
paid attention to the God of Wealth, Dollar, and the others. Han
Sen did not know anything about it. Even if he did know of the
traction he was garnering, he wouldn’t have cared.</p>
<p>Han Sen was busy investigating the gold wing peacock king. It
now the shaky sonic shockwave in its skillset. It had obviously
come from the sonic god bird.</p>
<p>“The gold wing peacock king now how this kind of power. So, does
all it have to do is consume another gene race to get another gene
skill? If it eats a lot of gene races, it will earn many.” Han Sen
knew Bai Mo would not put any ordinary gene egg inside that mystery
stove.</p>
<p>Back in the day, Bai Mo accepted a quest from Qin Xiu to find a
way to revive Qin Wan’er. He had discovered the black crystal stone
and the stone stove that possessed The Story of Genes from an old
tribe.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu had taken the black crystal stone to the geno universe.
Bai Mo had investigated the stone stove.</p>
<p>Bai Mo died a very long time ago, but the gold wing peacock
king’s eggs were burning in the stone stove day and night until Han
Sen found it and hatched it.</p>
<p>Although the gold wing peacock king was already a top-class gene
race, Han Sen always wondered if it was a mutant god-class gene
egg. He did not think Bai Mo cherished it that much.</p>
<p>Judging from Bai Mo’s identity, he might have hidden a gene egg
there. But inside the stone stove, it was the gold wing peacock
king.</p>
<p>“It looks like there is more than meets the eye with this gold
wing peacock king.” Han Sen had no idea what use the gold wing
peacock king had. He had waited a long time to see its true
potential.</p>
<p>There was one thing known for sure. The gold wing peacock king
was able to keep eating gene races to evolve and develop its
skillset. Regarding the direction it could evolve into, whether it
would end up as a God Spirit or a gene race, Han Sen could not
accurately predict the outcome.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the other two from the God of Wealth kept fighting
and kept winning. They were unstoppable. It was only a matter of
time before they breached the top 100. God of Wealth and the three
aliases they used were already being discussed across the seven
kingdoms.</p>
<p>The nobles of the seven kingdoms fervently debated what level of
God Spirit the God of Wealth was and how its agents were so strong.
They wondered about the true identity of Dollar, Lucky, and Ingot
too. People like that were definitely not nobodies. Feng Fei Fei
sadly returned to the Feng family castle. She wanted to perform
well, but she had suffered bad luck. She encountered a powerful
elite, so she just fell short of the top 100.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei was not too disappointed. She rushed back to the
Feng family castle, wanting to ask if Feng Yin Yin had heard about
Dollar, Lucky, and Ingot.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei wanted to know who the consuming god was as well as
who those three people were.</p>
<p>There were no matches that day, so Feng Yin Yin had remained
home. When Feng Fei Fei kept asking her, Feng Yin Yin replied, “Are
you asking about those three people? Of course, I know them.”</p>
<p>“Who are they?” Feng Fei Fei curiously asked.</p>
<p>“It is San Mu, Bao’er, and me.” Feng Yin Yin pointed at her nose
as she answered.</p>
<p>“What? It’s you guys. Which one are you?” Feng Fei Fei looked at
Feng Yin Yin strangely.</p>
<p>“My nickname is Lucky.” Feng Yin Yin was being honest.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei looked at Feng Yin Yin as she asked, “Where did you
get the powerful peacock gene race?” She looked super weirded
out.</p>
<p>“San Mu let me borrow it,” Feng Yin Yin replied.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei’s expression looked even more strange. She did not
say anything. On the inside, her heart struggled. She thought, “Han
Sen and Little Yin are not related, yet he treats Little Yin very
well. Is he hitting on Little Yin? But Little Yin is just a kid.
How could he…”</p>
