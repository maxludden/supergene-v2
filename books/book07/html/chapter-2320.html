<p>Han Sen didn’t answer. He spread his Eternity solidifying powers all over himself. His body became solid and unchangeable, halting Bai Yi’s invasion in its tracks. It solidified Bai Yi’s Original Water King Body as well. It couldn’t invade Han Sen’s cells any further, and it couldn’t retreat either.</p>

<p>But Eternity’s solidifying properties could only lock things down as they were. It was unable to erase the Original Water King Body that had already established its encroaching presence.</p>

<p>“Bai Yi, you better answer my question. Otherwise, don’t take it out on me for being cruel to you.” Han Sen rose out of the lava valley and found a hidden place where he could speak to Bai Yi.</p>

<p>“You cannot scare me,” Bai Yi hissed back. “Although your power might have stopped the process of Return to Origin, your own body has been paused, too. You can’t remain like this forever, and you can’t do anything about my presence here.”</p>

<p>“Are you really Prince Sixteen?” Han Sen asked curiously, ignoring what Bai Yi had said.</p>

<p>“It’s true. Ask around if you want, and you will learn much of my famous name.” Bai Yi sounded cocky.</p>

<p>“You are a prince, so what are you doing in Knight’s Paradise? And why are you fighting to claim a Metal Doll?” Han Sen asked, knowing that something odd had to be going on.Read more new novels on</p>

<p>Knight’s Paradise was a place that was set up for the Royal Guards. Ordinary royal children would never go there. And it seemed rather absurd for a prince to fight Han Sen over the ownership of a Duke Metal Doll.</p>

<p>This was Han Sen’s first time there, so it all seemed just a little bit too coincidental.</p>

<p>“It is because of that bitch, Bai Ling Shuang,” Bai Yi growled. “Otherwise, why would I even come here?”</p>

<p>When Han Sen heard this, he understood. Bai Ling Shuang was Princess Ten. She was the one that Bai Wei had a strong distaste for.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought about it. He had met Bai Wuchang in the space station, and now he was meeting Bai Yi here. There was no way these two incidents were purely coincidental. He was afraid that the incident with Bai Wuchang had transpired because of Bai Ling Shuang’s meddling.</p>

<p>Although he had never seen Bai Ling Shuang before, he sort of understood what the woman was capable of doing.</p>

<p>“Bai Ling Shuang told you to kill me?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Anyway, I am going to exact my revenge on that cheap bitch.” Bai Yi obviously didn’t want to talk about it. Bai Ling Shuang must have set him up, and now things had obviously gone much farther than he had intended.</p>

<p>Both because of Han Sen and Bai Ling Shuang, these events would be forever branded into Bai Yi’s heart. He must have really wanted both of them dead for different reasons.</p>

<p>“But these are all matters for the future. Let’s talk about you and me, right now. You want to take over my body, don’t you? Well, that’s impossible. Tell me what you are planning to do next,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Bai Yi snorted in annoyance. “Return to Origin is a one-way ticket once it has been triggered. This is a process that you can never reverse. I will take over you; it is only a matter of time. And from this point on, you will not be able to gain power. Sooner or later, your body will submit and become mine.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure there is no other way?” Han Sen asked seriously.</p>

<p>“Only one of us can be left alive,” Bai Yi replied calmly. He was very confident in the abilities of his Return to Origin.</p>

<p>“I was going to let you live, but if you don’t want to live, then just know that you’ve done this to yourself.” Han Sen sighed.</p>

<p>Killing a prince in King’s Kingdom was quite a crazy thing to do. King Bai would obviously come to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>There were too many elites among the Extreme King. Many of them, like Mister White, had powerful predictive talents, so Han Sen couldn’t be sure that he could keep Bai Yi’s murder a secret. He didn’t dare to kill a prince when his deed could be discovered.</p>

<p>Or at least, he wouldn’t if he didn’t have a choice. If Bai Yi couldn’t get out of his body, then he had to let King Bai know that Bai Yi had forced this situation upon them. If possible, he would help Bai Yi replace his body.</p>

<p>When Bai Yi spoke again, his voice was full of scorn. “I have melted into your cells. I am a part of your body now. Unless you kill yourself, here I am. What can you do about it?”</p>

<p>“If all of the Bai family is as naive as you are, that would be great.” Han Sen sighed. Bai Yi was the most retarded Bai family member he had met so far. Even Bai Wei was much smarter than he was.</p>

<p>He had been used by Bai Ling Shuang, but he had still strutted arrogantly around the entire time. Han Sen had no idea how he had managed to survive for so long in the Extreme King. It was a very competitive place to live in, after all.</p>

<p>“Right… Maybe no one cares for a big retard like him. Maybe no one will be too upset that he’s dead,” Han Sen thought to himself. Then, his eyes started to turn white.</p>

<p>The white light blazed out of Han Sen, overwhelming his body with holy light. He started to take on the form of a holy god.</p>

<p>“This… this is impossible!” Bai Yi screamed. He noticed that his Original Water King Body was being torn away from Han Sen’s own cells.</p>

<p>Terror suffused Bai Yi as he realized that his Original Water King Body was far inferior to this new power. The genes he saw now made Bai Yi so terrified.</p>

<p>“What is this… What is this power?! Why does my king body feel so scared? This is impossible! Our king bodies are the strongest bodies in the world… We have the strongest genes… There cannot be any genes that are stronger than ours…” Bai Yi felt his Original Water King Body beginning to detach from Han Sen’s. That power was suppressing him, too. He couldn’t move. He was so terrified, and his previous calm had vanished.</p>

<p>Han Sen ignored Bai Yi’s moaning. His whole body was in super god spirit mode now. In super god spirit mode, he tore out Bai Yi’s Original Water King Body.</p>

<p>The Original Water King Body’s genes were very strong, but in front of the super god spirit body, the king body was like dirt. Unless Han Sen absorbed and refined it, they wouldn’t combine together.</p>

<p>In front of Han Sen’s super god spirit body, Bai Yi felt like his high-level Original Water King Body had become a collection of low-level genes. He could only stare at that scary power now.</p>

<p>All those drops of water were like a babbling spring. Under the power of the super god spirit, Han Sen refined each droplet one by one.</p>

<p>“No, don’t kill me… I can get out of you!” Bai Yi finally felt fear. The Original power was being refined by Han Sen. He couldn’t fathom how a Duke had managed to amass such wretched powers. Han Sen wasn’t as strong and he wasn’t a King yet, but even so… Bai Yi could see enough of Han Sen’s genes to know that they were far better than his own Original Water King Body.</p>

<p>“It is too late,” Han Sen said simply. His super god spirit body became stronger.</p>

<p>Since he had already cast the skill, he wasn’t going to leave any trace of the prince behind.</p>

<p>“You cannot kill me! I am Prince Sixteen! I am the son of King Bai! I…” Bai Yi’s voice vanished. Under the thumb of Han Sen’s super god spirit body, his Original Water King Body was refined in no time.</p>
