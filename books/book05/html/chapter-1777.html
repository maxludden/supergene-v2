	<p>“Long ago, three thousand prisoners were forced to mine ore across Mosi Mountain. They were unable to leave until
		death claimed them.” Kong Fei did not answer Duke Brilliant. All he did was say something that made no sense,
		given the current context.</p>

	<p>But after Duke Brilliant heard what he was told, his face paled and he shouted, “Who are you!”</p>

	<p>Kong Fei still did not answer. He kept going, saying, “Those three thousand prisoners were slaves, kept here
		forever. They would each die in the same bindings they were birthed into. After their deaths, the feathers
		between their wings were plucked. There were three thousand of them, and they provided the basis of this
		garment.”</p>

	<p>“Impossible… We already killed all the traitors a long time ago. Who are you?” Duke Brilliant’s eyes cut like
		blades. He looked as if he was ready to tear Kong Fei apart and slice-up all his organs.</p>

	<p>But Kong Fei just smiled and took off his feather clothing. His upper body was naked, but two strange scars were
		visible on his back. They looked as if they could have been the slots where wings might have once existed, but
		they had been ripped off.</p>

	<p>Duke Brilliant saw the scars on Kong Fei’s back, and when he did, his face changed. His eyes flared with the fire
		of murder, and he yelled, “I cannot believe there are traitors that yet remain! It is lucky you were able to
		live this long. How dare you appear here, having killed Feathers. You must die!”</p>

	<p>After that, Duke Brilliant waited for no further reply. His body shone with the color gold, as his wings spread
		out like suns of their own. Their light shone across the area, and everything the light touched was turned into
		gold.</p>

	<p>The rivers became solid and the rocks became clumps of pure gold. The entire vicinity became its own world of
		gold. Duke Brilliant was most certainly the god of this world.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and Stay Up Late were in shock. They knew that everything happening was very bad, and such scary powers
		would be difficult to fend off. And if they themselves were turned into gold, they’d be killed immediately.</p>

	<p>But before the gold light doused them, the white feathers Kong Fei had given them started glowing with a bright
		white light. The light was like a bubble that shielded their bodies from harm. The gold light was unable to
		penetrate the holy light.</p>

	<p>Kong Fei stood on the ground and put on his feather clothes again. He ignored the gold light, and with much
		disdain, told their enemy, “Of the three thousand, only I am left. But the three thousand Feathers are still
		here, and I will seek vengeance for each of them.”</p>

	<p>“A traitor speaks of justice?” Duke Brilliant grunted. His wings flapped like gold suns, firing shockwaves
		through the atmosphere.</p>

	<p>Each time the wings flapped, Duke Brilliant became stronger. His body wasn’t so big, but it did seem as if it was
		becoming larger. He was taking on the appearance of a statue, as he stood there upon the mountain.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and Kong Fei were like ants before him. It was quite scary.</p>

	<p>In the homes of the powerful Feather families, there were seven Kings and a number of Dukes watching the video
		relay of a satellite imaging system. They were watching what was happening on Mosi Mountain.</p>

	<p>When they saw the scars on Kong Fei’s back, they were all shocked.</p>

	<p>King-Sky King, the ruler, frowned and said, “There were three thousand Feathers stuck in the mines of Mosi
		Mountain for their entire lifetime. They were all turned into dust, or so it was believed. How could one of them
		have survived?”</p>

	<p>“My King, they did become dust. We could not have been incorrect, and the king in those days confirmed this.
		There were no survivors. Unless…” Song King stopped speaking there, and did not continue.</p>

	<p>“Unless what?” King-Sky King asked coldly.</p>

	<p>“Unless one of them had a baby inside the gold mine without us knowing. That child might not have been counted
		amongst the three thousand. But if it were in places such as the Eclipse Gold Mine, they could not have lived
		there. How could the prisoners have bred successfully? And if they did, the baby could not escape the eye of the
		watcher. It could not have survived and lived. It just makes no sense.” Song King shook his head.</p>

	<p>“This person appearing now is pointless. Just go ahead and kill him, and get this done.” Holy Column King did not
		move his eyebrows as he spoke, he just said things lackadaisically.</p>

	<p>All the other kings agreed, and they proceeded to watch the video.</p>

	<p>Duke Brilliant was like a Buddha as he tried repeatedly to strike Kong Fei with his palm. The golden palms
		covered the entire sky, like a golden palace was falling. The shadows they cast were abyssal, shrouding the
		landscape in darkness.</p>

	<p>Kong Fei’s eyes did not move. He just pulled out a white feather and drew across the sky.</p>

	<p>A small white light rose into the air. It cut the giant hand. A lesion appeared across it and grew bigger until
		it was revealed that the hand had been sliced in half. Gold blood started to cascade.</p>

	<p>“Argh!”</p>

	<p>The scream was incredibly loud, but the hand did not stop descending. A small white line traced up the hand, down
		the arm, and across the body that the arm connected to. Duke Brilliant’s gold body was cut open, splitting in
		two.</p>

	<p>The earth was shaking as the blood rained from the sky with the force of a river. Mountains and rivers were
		further dyed with the gold blood. Only the white feathers looked new and undrenched, without a speck of blood on
		them.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and Stay Up Late were surprised. For him to have killed a Duke so easily, Kong Fei had to have been a
		King. The many Kings and Nobles were in shock. Song King himself looked dim and said, “I cannot believe that
		hybrid managed to become a King.”</p>

	<p>“Leader, please grant me permission to fight the hybrid.” One King stepped forward, looking murderous.</p>

	<p>“Killing a hybrid like this will require thunder. I will fight alongside you.” Holy Column King stood up, asking
		King-Sky King for permission to depart</p>

	<p>Before he replied, Kong Fei waved his white feather again. Mosi Mountain, which was a thousand meters high, was
		sundered in two by the same feather.</p>

	<p>Below the thousand-meter-high mountain were thousands of nameless graves. If the mountain had not been broken, no
		one would ever have known. And yet, so many lives were buried there.</p>

	<p>Kong Fei walked in front of the nameless graves, and just when Han Sen thought he was going to pray for them,
		Kong Fei grabbed his clothes and shook them.</p>

	<p>The clothes exploded in the air. The feathers scattered all across the graves.</p>

	<p>The feathers flew onto the graves and exploded. They revealed the bones that lay hidden beneath.</p>

	<p>The bones were rotten, and many had been reduced to nothing but dust. Two feathers landed on each grave.</p>

	<p>“Three thousand years of hope-sapped waiting. Three thousand years of sadness and injustice. Three thousand years
		of humiliation. I am going to win it all back. You guys will not need to wait for me any longer. You don’t need
		to stay in this world any longer.”</p>
