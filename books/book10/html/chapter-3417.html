<p>As he bowed, the wounds on his arm and the broken black crystal
armor had already recovered. No trace of the wounds he had just
incurred was found.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and thought, “The geno prototype armor has a
real body inside it. What does this mean? Did Qin Xiu give up his
body and use a pure spirit body to enter the geno prototype armor?
If this was true, there should not be any actual body inside
it.”</p>
<p>“I must congratulate you as well, Moon God coldly said. “It
looks like you did it. You reached Reboot level. You made your
body.”</p>
<p>“This is as I expected all along. There is nothing particular
joyous or special about this. But tell me, Sister Moon, do you
still want to fight me?” Qin Xiu was neither happy nor sad. He
looked like this was what was always supposed to happen.</p>
<p>“I said that I would deliver three palms, and now I have
delivered my three palms,” Moon God said. “You do not need to try
me.” She then walked away. She broke space and departed the 17th
sky. The 33 skies’ bai sema was unable to stop her exit.</p>
<p>When Moon God left, the shadow of the geno tablet faded away.
The 17th sky returned to how it used to be. No weird lights
continued to shock the sky and all that jazz.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a little strange after bearing witness to that
encounter. He did not know why Moon God did not attack him more.
She was very high-profile and had gone all the way up there to
fight him, yet she had only wanted to attack the man three times.
It did not seem as if that was something Moon God would do.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was lost in thought, he saw the space in front of
him ripple like water. A beautiful body like a mirror flower water
moon was spreading through space ahead like a shockwave. It was
Moon God arriving, the one who had just struck Qin Xiu three
times.</p>
<p>Han Yufei looked at Moon God. She looked a bit shy. She stood
straight and called out her name politely. “Sister Moon!”</p>
<p>“Little Yufei, you are still so lazy. With your potential, if
you were not glued to your research all the time, your
accomplishments and strength would be no inferior to mine.” Moon
God sounded as if she was trying to lecture her and as if she had
raised her all her life but had failed.</p>
<p>“Our paths were always meant to diverge,” Han Yufei said while
lifting the frame of her black glasses. She stared at Moon God. “It
does not mean the path you walked was right and mine was
wrong.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. It is good enough to learn that you are happy. Since
you were young, I was never able to control or steer you in any
particular direction that wasn’t your own.” After saying that, Moon
God, proceeded to ignore Han Yufei. She looked at Han Sen and said,
“Have you learned my three palms?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked and asked, “The three times you hit Qin Xiu,
was that something you actually wanted to show me?”</p>
<p>“So, have you learned them?” Moon God asked again.</p>
<p>“I understand a bit of what you showcased, but even if I did
understand them fully, it would be pointless. My body has a
problem. Thus, I will be unable to use them.” Han Sen had to answer
her this way. He was just trying to be polite, but he actually
understood what he had seen completely.</p>
<p>The three palms were three different levels of the Cold Sutra.
The first two levels were called Ice and Jade Shatter. Han Sen was
able to do those. The last one he saw was Moon Break. It should
have been something Moon God had created after she reached a Break
World rate of 100. Han Sen was able to understand it just fine, but
his body would not allow him to use it whenever he pleased.</p>
<p>Moon God asked, “Have you been able to understand Qin Xiu’s
power yet?”</p>
<p>“I understand some, but not all of it,” Han Sen said. “His body
was only created when he reached Reboot class, isn’t that
right?”</p>
<p>Moon God nodded and said, “Yes, that is correct. Upon reaching
Reboot class, it means he has achieved an undying body. Even
without a god temple or a base, he can infinitely reboot. He can
reset his body to a certain time and space. No matter what kind of
damage he takes, his body will be rebooted to that time. So, no
matter how strong your powers are, you are unable to kill him. You
can make his body turn into nothing, but he can still return to the
time he was first able to revive.”</p>
<p>After briefly thinking, Han Sen asked, “Is there no other way to
kill him? Like, can we use time power and prohibit him from going
back to that time?”</p>
<p>“Rebooting is not a simple time power,” Moon God said. “Even if
you achieved mastery over time and space powers, you cannot affect
his reboot powers. Otherwise, why else do you think only
Reboot-class people can assert control over the geno hall? Why
would they be the ones labeled the masters of the universe? Reboot
class means you have an immortal body. In this entire world, there
are only five people who are Reboot class.”</p>
<p>“There are five?” Han Sen looked at Moon God. He could not
imagine how there could be five such people.</p>
<p>Moon God said, “In the past, the Geno Hall Leader was the only
Reboot God Spirit. He was the first, and he was the beginning of
the Reboot class. Without him, there could not be another four
Reboot-class people.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Moon God said, “The second Reboot-class person is
someone you seem to know rather well. That person is Bao’er, who
happens to have that leader’s blood. She will become Reboot class.
It is only a matter of time before she does. The third person is
the current God Hall Leader. Before the old leader rebooted the
universe, he put his power into the geno hall. He controlled the
geno hall, and that is why the universe has been able to maintain
peace for so long.”</p>
<p>“So, are you saying the fourth is Qin Xiu? If that is so, who
might the fifth person be?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“If you knew Qin Xiu was Reboot class, then you should also know
who that person is,” Moon God said to Han Sen with a smile. “Can
you not guess the other Reboot-class person?”</p>
<p>“Witch Alpha!” Han Sen’s heart jumped as he said it out.</p>
<p>Back in the day, whoever earned the leader’s blood was not just
a human alpha. There was the alpha of the Witch, but Han Sen did
not know what happened to the Witch Alpha.</p>
<p>Han Sen peered at Moon God’s face. He knew he was correct, so he
asked, “Is the Witch Alpha still alive? Is she still here in the
current incarnation?”</p>
<p>Moon God smiled. “Do you think Qin Xiu only let me hit him
because he owes me a favor?”</p>
<p>“Are you saying he is afraid of the Witch Alpha?” Han Sen’s
heart was shaking.</p>
<p>“That is only half correct. He needed to return a favor to me,
but he was also scared. However, the Witch Alpha is dead. Now,
there is only Tai Yi of the Witch.” When Moon God mentioned those
two words, Tai Yi, she looked a bit cocky.</p>
<p>“Tai Yi is the Witch Alpha in a reincarnated form.” Han Sen’s
mouth opened wide. He remained frozen for quite a while.</p>
<p>Moon God sighed. “Not exactly. The Witch Alpha died and was
reincarnated. When she was reincarnated, there was a problem. Her
soul split into two. Tai Yi is one of those halves.”</p>
<p>“Was it really split in two? In that case, the other one…” Han
Sen wanted to ask who it was, but then he thought about someone. He
screamed and asked, “Is the other one Sky God King Qun?”</p>
<p>“You seem to know a lot, but King Qun is of the Witch.” Moon God
looked at Han Sen. She was surprised he knew about the existence of
Sky God King Qun.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew who King Qun was, but he was shocked all the same.
He did not believe the allegation, so he said, “That can’t be
right. King Qun and Tai Yi are different. How could he be another
half of the soul of the Witch Alpha?”</p>
<p>Moon God sighed. “Sometimes an identity does not mean anything.
Even though he is half of the Witch Alpha incarnate, he might not
be able to reach the end. But that is fine. King Qun does not
matter as it is the business of the Witch. You do not need to be
involved. Tai Yi will handle it.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Moon God said to Han Sen, “You saw my three
palms. You saw Qin Xiu’s body. This is good. Use my three palms to
practice with Bao’er. If she can evade Moon Break, she can battle
Qin Xiu. Otherwise, do not bother joining the geno tablet
fights.”</p>
