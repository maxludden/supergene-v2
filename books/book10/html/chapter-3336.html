<p>The woman drew out the purple copper sword, which was glowing
with a purple and red flame. It was like an endless power was
coming out with the sword and going into the woman’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked to see this. He saw it get pulled out by the
native right from the ground. It was not completely free though. A
special connection was forming between the purple copper sword and
woman.</p>
<p>The little girl was still being chased by the big beast. She was
soon close to them. The big beast seemed to sense something. It
looked at the woman with the purple copper sword that was burning
with a purple and red flame. It decided to leave the little girl
alone. It was like it had seen something truly terrifying.</p>
<p>The little girl was shocked by this. She then saw the woman
holding the purple copper sword. It made her think. Suddenly, her
vision changed. She started searching around the bush.</p>
<p>The little girl instantly looked at the black metal jian Han Sen
had become. She clearly remembered when the black jian and purple
copper sword made some strange noises together in a contest.</p>
<p>She looked at the woman holding the purple copper sword. It made
the little girl gnash her teeth. She quickly flew to Han Sen. Her
two small hands hastily gripped the jian.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked weird. He did not know if it was a good thing or
not to be pulled out from the stone by a little girl.</p>
<p>The little girl did not hesitate. She used all of her strength
to pull the black metal jian Han Sen had become slowly out of the
ground.</p>
<p>The little girl’s height was similar to the metal jian. Her
hands were clutching the jian’s handle, but she was unable to pull
it out of the stone. She let the handle of the jian go. She
clutched the body of the jian and pulled it up. She pulled Han Sen
up.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was being pulled out by the little girl, he felt a
scary rule power go into him and the little girl. It made his soul
power enter the little girl.</p>
<p>In reverse, the girl’s own soul power went into Han Sen. It was
like a fair trade between the pair. Han Sen was given the little
girl’s soul marking while the little girl was given his soul
marking.</p>
<p>“Goddamn, 33 skies rules!” Han Sen used his Super God Spirit
mode power, but it was unable to cancel the trade.</p>
<p>The little girl’s soul was way too weak. Although she had
received Han Sen’s soul mark, she could not refine it. That soul
mark was not very compatible with her soul. It was like some iron
in a sack of rice.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly refined and absorbed the little girl’s soul
mark. It became a part of his soul.</p>
<p>It resulted in the creation of a weird sort of situation.
Although the little girl had managed to pull Han Sen out, she could
not be like the woman and the purple copper sword. Their powers did
not resonate with each other.</p>
<p>The little girl held the pitch-black metal jian. It was like she
was clutching a charred stick. Nothing weird happened, and there
was no weird power moving.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the woman and the purple copper sword had
basically become one. The woman’s body had purple-red armor. It
wrapped up her slim body while the purple copper sword she held was
given a scary fire. To look at her from afar, one would have
thought she was a Valkyrie.</p>
<p>The woman looked at the little girl holding Han Sen. She looked
cold. She pulled out her sword and pointed it at the little girl.
The sword light was like a strong bolt of lightning. It slashed in
front of the little girl.</p>
<p>The little girl subconsciously raised the metal jian to block,
but there was a “dong” noise. The little girl and the jian were
sent flying. At the same time, a lot of blood sprayed through the
air. It all came out from the little girl.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The little girl’s body and the metal jian Han Sen had become
fell into the midst of a weapon forest. They broke through many
long spears in their descent. A lot of dust was kicked up in a
nasty plume.</p>
<p>“This is so weak. I cannot believe you are so weak, yet you are
a member of the soldiers.” The woman was holding the purple copper
sword while catching up to the little girl.</p>
<p>Although the little girl was weak, the woman was not planning on
letting her go. But it was not like she was a big threat to her.
What made her feel threatened was the little black jian the small
girl was holding. The jian looked fairly ordinary and did not seem
as if it had any power.</p>
<p>The woman still knew that the jian could release a weapon sound
that could not be imagined. It was like the purple copper sword was
summoning her.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword’s strength was very mighty. She knew the
black metal jian was nothing ordinary as well. She wanted to kill
the little girl before she could hold the metal jian. She was not
going to give her another chance.</p>
<p>“Do not take it out on me. Blame the cruel world. There is only
one holy soldier in Soldier Weapon Sky. One of us has to die.” The
woman raised the purple copper sword. She was going to slash the
little girl, who was struggling to get up.</p>
<p>The scary sword light seemed to break everything. It had an
unstoppable light.</p>
<p>The little girl’s eyes were full of a wild light. She knew she
would be unable to do much, but she still held onto her metal
jian.</p>
<p>One of her arms was already broken by the first attack. She
powerlessly left it hanging. As she fell through the woods, her
entire body had been severely scratched. She was still
bleeding.</p>
<p>The little girl was half-kneeling on the ground. One of her
hands clutched the metal jian that looked like a charred stick. She
was attacking the purple and red light.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The purple copper sword’s sword light struck the metal jian.
Without thinking, the little girl curled her body. She thought she
was going to be attacked by a scary power.</p>
<p>She was shocked to soon notice that aside from the weight of the
metal jian, she did not feel any power attack.</p>
<p>Instead, the purple-red sword light struck the metal jian like
glass. It shattered and faded away. The black metal jian, however,
was totally fine. The black jian’s body was becoming an icy jade
that looked like crystal.</p>
<p>When the purple copper sword’s sword body hit the metal jian,
the metal jian became a half-transparent ice-jade jian. The two
blades collided. Moaning sounds erupted. They were loud enough to
shock the sky.</p>
<p>The purple copper sword had a crack that was the size of a grain
of rice, but the ice-jade jian was totally fine.</p>
<p>The little girl was very happy. She held the ice-jade jian and
kept striking at the woman. The woman raised her sword to fight
back. A few blade collisions ensued. Each time the purple copper
sword endured a hit, a crack the size of a grain of rice appeared
on the metal.</p>
<p>“Dumbass! Brainless b*tch! Do you only use strength to slash?”
The purple copper sword was afraid and angry. The purple copper
sword was the man’s body. If the sword was damaged, it meant his
actual body was being hurt. That woman was playing with his
life.</p>
<p>His thoughts were unable to be heard by the woman. Suddenly, the
purple copper sword started to glow, but it was not going to Han
Sen and the little girl. It was pulling the woman’s body away to
escape someplace far away from there. The woman was shocked by
this, but she soon disappeared someplace deep within the recesses
of the woods.</p>
