Flowing Sand Dune was three hundred square miles, and it was definitely a forbidden place in Wind Song Desert. Even the storm wouldn’t come to this place.

Black Horn Dragon was lying on the dune, enjoying the sun and having a nap.

Black Horn Dragon had roamed this desert for a very long time, and all the nearby creatures were terrified of it. No creatures ever dared to disturb it from napping in the sun.

Though it was sleeping, the Black Horn Dragon still had its senses, so it noticed that someone had come to Flowing Sand Dune.

However, the Black Horn Dragon didn’t even want to open its eyes. It was still sleeping, and it was thinking in its subconscious, “Seriously? Some idiot is running through Flowing Sand Dune again? Well, I’ll keep enjoying the sun, and I’ll eat him as a dessert after I wake up.”

The lazy Black Horn Dragon continued lying there, but he felt that something was wrong. That creature that had entered Flowing Sand Dune was too fast, and it was approaching very quickly. Black Horn Dragon suddenly opened its eyes. It decided to get up and see who this bold intruder was.

Just as Black Horn Dragon opened its eyes, a shining heel fell from the sky and stepped on its face, then ran across its body and continued on across the dunes.

“You dare to treat me like this? You’re dead!” Black Horn Dragon jumped up, and its eyes were gleaming with indignation.

Its giant body suddenly leaped into the sky, and it unleashed a wave of its dragon breath. The terrifying force lashed toward Han Sen, who was still running forward.

Han Sen felt really upset Though he wanted to kill a super creature, he hadn’t expected to fight a super creature under these circumstances.

Fortunately, Han Sen was running very fast with the shoe. Han Sen couldn’t stop, but he could accelerate. Using the change in his speed, he dodged the dragon breath from Black Horn Dragon again and again.

The dunes were filled with the rumbling noise of the dragon, and the flowing sand tumbled like waves under the shock of its breath.

Han Sen dodged the strikes of the Black Horn Dragon again and again, which just infuriated it more. It was still chasing Han Sen with the desire to eat him.

Han Sen was running too fast, and he crossed the entire Flowing Sand Dune in a flash.

Han Sen had thought that the crystal shoe wanted to infuriate the Black Horn Dragon and get Han Sen killed, but it seemed that this wasn’t the case. He had already crossed the Flowing Sand Dune, yet the crystal shoe was still driving him forward. Apparently, its target wasn’t the Black Horn Dragon.

Han Sen was still some distance in front of the furious Black Horn Dragon, but he couldn’t increase that distance. It wasn’t a good thing for Han Sen.

Han Sen entered an oasis.

Peng!

Han Sen ran over a bird’s nest in the oasis, accidentally knocking a hole in an egg as he went.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to do that!” Han Sen looked very disappointed. However, two golden birds flew out of the nest, and they rushed toward Han Sen, squawking in anger.

Han Sen ran through a large pack of wolves, and he hit a small wolf. He caught the small wolf, while the large pack of terrifying metal wolves roared and rushed toward him. He quickly threw the baby wolf back towards the pack.

“Sorry, I’ll give you back now!”

However, the wolf pack didn’t want to let him go easily. Instead, they continued to chase Han Sen, howling as they ran.

“I didn’t see anything! I swear to God!” Han Sen rushed through a spring in the oasis, and he saw a female with snowy skin and snake hair showering in the pond.

Han Sen was making disturbances throughout the entirety of Wind Song Desert, and he was getting more and more horrified. He pounded away across the desert, and countless horrifying creatures chased after him. Han Sen was sure that if he stopped now, he would be torn to pieces in a millisecond.

“Run faster… Please, run faster…” Han Sen begged the crystal heel for more speed. Escaping those horrifying creatures had become his first priority.

The crystal heel seemed to have reached its limit already, and it wasn’t accelerating. It also wasn’t managing to shake off the horde of creatures. However, those horrifying creatures couldn’t catch up with Han Sen, so they couldn’t just kill him.

Han Sen didn’t know what the crystal heel wanted. It didn’t show any sign of stopping, and it was still rushing in one direction without changing at all.

Han Sen could now be sure that it wasn’t targeting him; otherwise, it could have redirected him toward the enraged creatures. If it did that, Han Sen would be killed instantly.

However, it didn’t show any sign of stopping.

Han Sen noticed something strange now. The crystal shoe seemed to be looking for something, or perhaps it was trying to get somewhere it wanted.

Han Sen looked around and realized that the desert around him now had some scattered trees. He was definitely leaving Wind Song Desert.

He hadn’t expected to cross Wind Song Desert entirely under such circumstances. However, he didn’t feel happy at all when he looked at the bloodthirsty creatures chasing him.

None of them were giving up the chase, and they all wanted to kill Han Sen.

In the Departed Abyss, a creature that looked like a devil was sleeping in the dark. Suddenly, it opened its eyes and stared into the darkness.

A small human being walked in front of the demon-like creature, and the creature said coldly, “You dared to come to my Departed Abyss? Do you think you’ve been living or too long?”

Fallen Slaughter, look at this. The small human being wasn’t scared at all when he saw the creature that looked like a nightmare. He lifted a small box, then he threw it toward the terrifying creature.

The creature in the dark caught that box, and suddenly, it looked happily surprised. It then opened the box, and it looked even more so.

“Human, why did he ask you to come here?” Fallen Slaughter walked out of the darkness, holding the box.

It had a strong black metal body and a pair of black metal wings that looked like those of a demon. It had horns that looked like blades on its head, and black fire surrounding its skull. The monster’s terrifying exploding power was obvious with every move, as if it could destroy hell with a single punch.

“He wants you to kill someone”, said Qing Ya mildly.

“Kill who?” Fallen Slaughter asked.

“A human being called Han Sen”, said Qing Ya.

“Where is he now? Take me there”, said Fallen Slaughter coldly.

“As you wish.” Qing Ya moved his body and appeared beside Fallen Slaughter. He put his hands on the creature’s shoulder, and then they both vanished from the Departed Abyss.
