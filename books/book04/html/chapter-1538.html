      The spirit, seeing the lion’s stamp, looked frightened. He didn’t say
      anything more, and simply turned around to take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other spirits and creatures remained where they were, but they didn’t
      say anything. They still wanted to get into the Godlight Tunnel, but they
      were curious as to how things might develop first.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thinking for a minute, Han Sen decided to leave, too. He wanted to
      see how things went, as well. Waiting until the three factions had fought
      amongst themselves and then picking off the survivors would be better than
      going up against all of them at once.
    </p>
    <p>Yu Xuan, seeing Han Sen leave, grunted and said nothing more.</p>
    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu was currently quite depressed. He had been having quite the
      streak of bad luck. When he entered the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, although
      he managed to survive, he was captured by spirits from Outer Sky Shelter
      and forced to sign a contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn’t return to the Alliance, and he had to risk his life
      frequently, despite only possessing a bronze geno core. And since the
      spirit he had signed a contract with decided to join the mission to God’s
      Ruin, he had to tag along, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very happy to see Han Sen was actually still alive, but after being
      captured by a big faction like Outer Sky, he didn’t think Han Sen could
      save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s so sad. I couldn’t catch up to Han Sen, despite having a ten-year
      headstart, and what’s more, I haven’t even been able to determine my own
      fate.” Tang Zhenliu sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen and Tang Zhenliu were in the same situation as each other, but Queen
      wasn’t too concerned. She stood behind Goddess, waiting for her moment to
      come. She was very confident in Han Sen, and she earnestly believed he
      would save her and get her free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then watched the three factions get into a fight outside the
      tunnel, and he made sure to watch from a distance. He was thinking about
      how he could save both of his human friends, more than anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If they haven’t signed contracts, this will be easy. If they have, it’ll
      be annoying,” Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t waste time! The ruin is only open for a limited amount of time.
      Lion Mountain will control this tunnel, so just go elsewhere.” Little Jade
      Lion spoke with a cocky confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he only had a silver self geno core, because of White Lion King,
      he wasn’t afraid of Outer Sky or Sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Lion King, Outer Sky will leave, but only on one condition,” Yu
      Miao suddenly said to the lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion replied, “If it’s on a ridiculous condition, then no
      thank you. But go ahead and feel free to let me know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s not ridiculous. If Outer Sky does not fight for your tunnel, you
      must let us enter the tunnel freely, without taking our geno cores,” Yu
      Miao said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sister, how could you…” Yu Xuan sounded nervous. Ownership of the
      Godlight Tunnel might have been the biggest potential gain of the entire
      God’s Ruin. Yu Miao, by proposing such a deal, would let them lose a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao waved her hand to stop him from talking, and she did not mention
      any further conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, I promise you Outer Sky spirits can enter the tunnel.” Little Lion
      King, hearing Yu Miao say this, immediately agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, then.” Yu Miao waved her hand and brought the Outer Sky followers
      along with her into the tunnel’s entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sister, if you leave like that, we cannot get anything!” Yu Xuan said to
      Yu Miao.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s the rush? Goddess is still there. They won’t back off, and
      there’ll be a big fight. Determining the victor won’t be easy,” Yu Miao
      said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>“What if Goddess doesn’t fight?” Yu Xuan asked with worry.</p>
    <p>
      “Impossible. With Goddess’ personality being what it is, she won’t back
      off,” Yu Miao spoke with unwavering confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black dog, seeing Outer Sky leave, lowered his voice and said to
      Goddess, “Miss, that Yu Miao is so evil. She must be waiting until we
      fight Lion King, and we’re injured. What should we do? Should we go back,
      in case they take advantage of us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That won’t be necessary. Yu Miao thinks she has tricked us, but in fact,
      she has provided us with an opportunity. If we beat Lion King, we can
      claim the entrance to Godlight Tunnel.” Goddess stared at Lion King as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The little lion is young, but the Lionheart Stamp is a powerful super
      geno core. With those spirits guarding him, he will be as strong as us. I
      don’t think things will be as easy as you seem to believe.” The black dog
      looked worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If things were easy, Yu Miao wouldn’t have given us this chance,” Goddess
      said, and then walked close to the Lion King.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Goddess, my father and your father are friends. You can leave now, and if
      you do, I won’t fight you.” Little Lion King continued to speak with
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddess smiled. “Sacred’s relationship with Lion Mountain has been good,
      but you are too naive if you think we are actually going to give up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lion Mountain has its own strength. Its relationships aren’t necessary.
      Are you saying you’ll fight me for the Godlight Tunnel?” Little Jade Lion
      seemed upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have to fight, but there’s no need to harm our relationship and allow
      others to gain an advantage,” Goddess said while looking at Yu Miao, who
      was in the midst of leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion was boisterous, but he wasn’t stupid. He knew Yu Miao was
      simply hoping to take advantage.
    </p>
    <p>“Then what do you suggest?” Little Jade Lion asked Goddess.</p>
    <p>
      “How about we fight? If you lose, you leave. We can avoid loss, and we can
      avoid being taken advantage of,” Goddess said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think I’m stupid? You are gemstone and I am only silver. Why would
      I even think about fighting you?” Little Lion King smirked. He was not
      interested in her proposed deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddess then said, “We only battle with non-self geno cores. We won’t be
      relegated to fighting with our actual power. You did bring Lionheart Stamp
      with you, yes? We have the God Ring. Do you think Lionheart Stamp can
      resist the God Ring?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really? Only fighting with geno cores?” Little Jade Lion looked confused,
      unsure of what she was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lion’s Lionheart Stamp and Goddess’ God Ring were not their self
      geno cores. The combatants’ personal power would not affect the fight.
      There had once been an event between the two shelters, and it proved that
      God Ring was actually weaker than Lionheart Stamp, but now she was
      willingly going to use something that was weaker. Little Lion King wasn’t
      sure what she was up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was confident in his stamp. He didn’t see a reason why he should
      reject the fight, and if he didn’t accept, he’d simply look weak. People
      might think he was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, then. Lionheart Stamp versus God’s Ring. Whoever loses will leave
      Godlight Tunnel alone.” Little Jade Lion wasn’t dumb. He said this out
      loud, so all could hear which geno cores were to be used. He didn’t want
      her summoning another.
