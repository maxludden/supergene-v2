<p>After entering the area with the grapevines, things became much
easier for Han Sen.</p>
<p>The fighting skills that the four Chaos employed were rather
simple and a little clumsy, but they weren’t weak. One versus one,
Han Sen might win. But against four of them at the same time, there
was a high chance he could stumble and fall.</p>
<p>Han Sen used all the judgment, prediction, and movement that his
skills gave him. He did this so he could fight them more
effectively in the grapevine area.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept escaping in the direction that Yisha had fled. But
Yisha herself was now headed in the direction Mister Ji had gone,
so Han Sen was unable to see her. If she had not been killed, she
should still be in the grape area.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still curious about how she had managed to get rid
of the Chaos that were chasing her.</p>
<p>The four Chaos ardently pursued Han Sen. He was able to kite and
keep them at bay, though, keeping them from dealing any damage to
him. In this manner, they went deep into the grapevines.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Han Sen could catch glimpses of Yisha’s trail.
But after going this deep, he had lost sight of it.</p>
<p>“What did she do?” Han Sen frowned. He was fighting four Chaos
all alone, hoping to find something that could help him out of the
bind.</p>
<p>The grapevines there were very big. They were as thick as a
man’s leg, and they tangled together like snakes. They webbed and
clogged the skies, making it difficult for sunlight to pierce
through and illuminate the undergrowth. The whole place was like
one labyrinthine cave system.</p>
<p>Han Sen wouldn’t have dared go this deep if he didn’t know there
were no xenogeneics there.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the complicated geography could weaken the
resolve of the Chaos. But they seemed to be very familiar with the
place, and Han Sen still couldn’t shake them off his tail.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Armor absorbed the power and strength of the earth,
but it was very limited where they were right now. Perhaps it was
because of the atmosphere that had been damaged by the two elites
so long ago. And consequently, the Baron Dongxuan Armor was
suppressed. To make matters worse, without the constant
replenishment, the energy he was using was starting to make him
feel tired.</p>
<p>When Han Sen wondered whether or not he should risk trying to
take a hostage, he suddenly saw something bright. The vines seemed
to be opening in front of him, and the sunlight was extra bright
there. It was being reflected by something, and Han Sen assumed it
might be water.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how he had gotten here. He ran forward, and
lo and behold, he saw a lake that was skirted by the rest of the
oasis’ vines.</p>
<p>A statue stood n the middle of the lake, and surprisingly, Yisha
was there.</p>
<p>Yisha was sitting on the shoulder of the statue. She looked
surprised when she saw Han Sen emerge from the knot of vines.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen left the vines and approached the shores of the
lake, he heard the Chaos make warning sounds. They were warning Han
Sen not to venture too close to it.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t care for what they thought, though, and he just
continued on towards the lake. He jumped to Yisha’s statue.</p>
<p>The statue was sculpted to look like a person. It sort of looked
like a human or a crystallizer. There were no butterfly wings, cat
ears, or tail of any sort. It was just a three-meter-tall person
with clothes on. The lower part of its legs was submerged beneath
the surface of the lake.</p>
<p>When Han Sen jumped, the Chaos stopped near the shore. They gave
up their chase, and neither did they fire any more arrows.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew to the left shoulder of the statue. Yisha, who was
on the right shoulder of the statue, drew out her saw-like knife.
She slashed it at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen many powerful skills, like Falsified-Sky sword
skills, but this was scary. There were many swordsmen in the
sanctuary, and lots of them were masters. But Han Sen had never
seen someone as cruel as she was before. Most sword skills he had
seen so far were intended for slashing or stabbing. Sometimes they
were fast and powerful.</p>
<p>But Yisha’s skills were weird. It looked like she was slashing
and stabbing at the same time, like some toxic snake. Or the fangs
of a hungry wolf. She was so fast, Han Sen could not determine the
track of her attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t spare much time thinking this over, though. He
used his powers to take to the air like a bird. He tried to dodge
Yisha, but he was suppressed and unable to tell where she was
attacking from. The suppression slowed him down, and while he did
manage to mostly dodge the strike, he was slashed across the
arm.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what that savage saw-knife was made of, but
it cut straight through his armor and sliced him deeply enough to
expose his bones.</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen’s blood was crystallized. Melting his blood
would be difficult under the suppressive atmosphere, so no actual
blood seeped through the wound.</p>
<p>Having failed to stop Han Sen, she lifted her weapon to strike
again. She was going faster and faster, with more strength in each
subsequent lunge. She was like some toxic beast opening its mouth
to bite Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the air, flying like a bird. He tried to gain
more distance to dodge Yisha’s attacks.</p>
<p>Yisha was still standing on the statue, though. Eventually, she
was unable to reach Han Sen. She didn’t chase him, and it seemed as
if she only wanted Han Sen off the statue.</p>
<p>But it was apparent by the look on her face that Yisha was
surprised. She was stunned that Han Sen had managed to dodge her
attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the air, thinking over what had happened.</p>
<p>Yisha was far stronger than he had imagined she would be. Her
attacks were almost as good as Han Sen’s. She was definitely a
master with the blade.</p>
<p>She deliberately let go of Han Sen and Mister Ji, and it seemed
like she had been using them as more than just bait Perhaps she was
staying here, not because of the Chaos, but something else. Perhaps
she had a plan that involved the lake, the statue, and maybe the
entire oasis itself.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he couldn’t use all his strength. If he had
enough energy, he could fly freely and not worry about falling. But
inside Demon Grave, Han Sen really was weak. Flying like he was, he
had already lost much of his power. He wouldn’t last much
longer.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the lake and noticed how clear the water was.
He could see the bottom, of the small lake. The water reflected
light very strongly, though. The reflections would hurt your
eye.</p>
<p>There were no creatures in the lake, and neither was there
anything like seaweed. But even so, with the fact that none of the
Chaos would approach, Han Sen did not have a good feeling about the
place.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and circled around in the air before
trying to return to the statue.</p>
