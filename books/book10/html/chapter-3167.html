<p>When the matches started, Bao’er and Feng Yin Yin only used
their gene races to fight. They did not bother going into the
battlegrounds, so there was no reason to fear for their safety.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw the small flying fish, which was under Bao’er’s
control, enter the space battleground, he knew it would be
difficult for her to lose.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it. He combined with the blood god dragon
and went through the god light screen to enter the space
battleground.</p>
<p>The blood god dragon was very strong, but it still hadn’t
absorbed the blood dragon god pulse to become a God Spirit gene
race. If he encountered an opponent with a God Spirit gene race,
beating such a fiend would be an incredibly tough task.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei was a royal of the Yan Kingdom. There was no
guarantee that he did not have a weird gene race up his sleeve.
Therefore, Han Sen decided to take part in the fight. He did not
want to risk being kicked out from the god fights in the first
round.</p>
<p>Chen Seven was in a good. He made his king-class gene race
ascend to adult mode. He was ready to fight in the god fights.</p>
<p>He did not have any lofty, high-rank expectations. If he could
at least perform reasonably well in the god fights, perhaps the God
Spirit he believed in would be more impressed with him. That meant
he had a chance to receive a better God Spirit Blood – Pulse.</p>
<p>The god fights were only for humans to participate in. For God
Spirits, it was like a trial.</p>
<p>el</p>
<p>The God Spirits could see their believers fight. By watching
them, the God Spirits could measure the strength of someone and see
if they had a bright future ahead of them or not. If there was a
member of its congregation that did not look outstanding but
performed really well in the god fights, they might be given a
second Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>Of course, it had to be a sensational performance. If it was
nothing special, the God Spirits were unlikely to be tempted. Of
course, that all came with the caveat of it being a very low chance
of occurring.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had the authority of a God Spirit, the God of
Wealth only had Feng Yin Yin. He had already given her the
highest-class God Spirit Blood-Pulse, so there was no need to test
her. Aside from that, every time Feng Yin Yin won, the God of
Wealth received some god power as a reward. The higher the rank
Feng Yin Yin earned, the more power the God of Wealth could
receive. If Feng Yin Yin won first place, the power reward given to
the God of Wealth was quite shocking. It would have been enough to
compose another god base.</p>
<p>It was a shame that even though Feng Yin Yin had the gold wing
peacock king, it was unlikely she could emerge victorious as first
place. So, Han Sen did not place that much hope in her yet.</p>
<p>Chen Seven’s target was lower. He only wanted to display a
decent performance. When he noticed his first opponent was a
nameless God of Wealth member called Ingot, he was delighted.</p>
<p>He was afraid to meet members of a famous God Spirit. Putting
aside the 12 Annihilation God Spirit members, even a Disaster God
Spirit member was unlikely to be something he could overcome.</p>
<p>Chen Seven investigated all the known God Spirits. The God of
Wealth didn’t appear to be an Annihilation or Disaster God Spirit.
It was also not a famous Destroyed God Spirit. He had never heard
of the name Ingot either. Therefore, he thought he had a good
chance of winning</p>
<p>When Chen Seven saw a white jade flying fish, which was about a
foot long, appear in the battleground, he almost laughed out
loud.</p>
<p>Obviously, his opponent was too scared to enter the fight and
had only sent a gene race in. He kept his cool and made no
fuss.</p>
<p>The small flying fish looked like something of a joke. It was
tiny, and it had wings. It looked cute but being cute was
completely pointless. Seeing its face, it looked like one slap
would be enough to send it flying.</p>
<p>“Don’t blame me, Chen Seven, for being cruel. Blame it on the
world for being too cruel.” Chen Seven laughed. He summoned his
king-class gene race tyrannosaurus rex king. Facing that small
flying fish, Chen Seven did not plan on entering the fight himself.
He wanted to use the tyrannosaurus rex king to crush the small
flying fish in a flash.</p>
<p>The adult body of the tyrannosaurus rex king was large. It was
three stories high. When it landed on the battleground, it raised
its head to the sky and roared. The roar was enough to shake the
mountains and rivers. It looked like a mean and violent beast. It
was a big difference compared to the cute, small, and
docile-looking fish that merrily flapped its fins.</p>
<p>“Number Seven, you are the best! It is no wonder you are my
son.” “Brother Seven, you are the best!”</p>
<p>“Son, muster the courage to bum rush the enemy.”</p>
<p>“Old Seven, murder that small fish. Do not play nice. Being nice
to the enemy is being cruel to yourself.”</p>
<p>ere</p>
<p>Chen Seven’s friends and family were watching the video in front
of a god temple. They were very hyped in their support of Chen
Seven.</p>
<p>Although he could not hear their voices, Chen Seven was
exuberant. He commanded the tyrannosaurus rex king to rush the
small flying fish. It opened its bloody mouth and tried to swallow
the small flying fish.</p>
<p>Seeing the small flying fish about to be swallowed, Chen Seven
and his friends and family thought it was already over.</p>
<p>In the next second, the small flying fish spit out some small
fire. It was not much. It looked like nothing hazardous. It looked
like the small spark of a tiny, freshly ignited flame in front of
the tyrannosaurus rex king. It landed on the tyrannosaurus rex
king’s nose.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the tyrannosaurus rex king was burning. Within the
blink of an eye, it turned into charcoal. It was like a black
charcoal statue had been placed there, depicting a monster with its
mouth open wanting to bite into food.</p>
<p>The wind blew. The charcoal-looking tyrannosaurus rex king
turned into dust and vanished.</p>
<p>Chen Seven and his friends and family were crazily excited a
second ago. Now, they looked petrified. Their mouths were agape,
and their eyes were open wide. It looked as if they might roll out
of their sockets.</p>
<p>They suddenly felt that the world was f*cking cruel.</p>
<p>Chen Seven instantly reacted. In a whoosh, he departed the
battleground. He was afraid to go any closer, fearing the small
flying fish would toast him too.</p>
<p>“My tyrannosaurus rex king…” Chen Seven kept running away while
crying. His heart was broken in little bits.</p>
<p>When Han Sen entered his battleground, Yan Bei Fei was already
waiting for him.</p>
<p>His title was Flying Yan Swordsman. A knife was attached to his
waist. The knife was called Flying Yan. It was one of the seven
most famous knives in the history of the Yan Kingdom. It had been
crafted out of the bones of a rare gene race.</p>
<p>No matter how good a knife was, it was useless if its owner was
no good with it. Yan Bei Fei was a good knife owner. He had the Yan
Kingdom’s inheritor Blood-Pulse, which was imparted to him by Empty
God. He also had the power of a powerful gene race. Regarding his
fierceness, the most important thing was the fact that he could use
all of that at max capacity. Once it left its scabbard, the Flying
Yan knife was something no one had ever survived.</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei noticed his opponent was wrapped up in a red air
that veiled his face. His eyes became blurry.</p>
<p>He did not know what his opponent was like. Seeing him combine
with a gene race, he knew his gene race was different. To Yan Bei
Fei, there was no difference. Even if his opponent had an ultimate
god-class gene race, he could kill it. “I do not want to kill
people today,” Yan Bei Fei said to Han Sen as he looked at him. He
knew it was overwhelmingly possible. If it was possible, he
preferred to not have to use the knife.</p>
<p>“I do not like killing either,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Yan Bei Fei replied. He said nothing else. He knew Han
Sen’s answer, so he grabbed the knife on his waist.</p>
