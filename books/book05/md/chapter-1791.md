  “Demon Grave?” Han Sen frowned and looked at Mister Ji.

Mister Ji nodded and said, “Yes, Demon Grave. It was an ordinary xenogeneic space, but a battle once transpired there. Something went awry. Anyone who enters there now has their powers suppressed to the level of an ordinary bumpkin in geno armor. Even a King would be like a commoner there, and the same applies to any weaponry that enters.”

“There’s a place like that? What happened there?” Han Sen asked.

“You have seen how powerful that Kong Fei is, yes? The one of No,” Mister Ji inquired.

Han Sen had a front row seat for that particular show. He nodded and said, “Yes, I have.”

“Demon Grave is the result of two elites like Kong Fei having a brawl,” Mister Ji said. “It is useless to try and resist the suppression of that zone. Your strength won’t mean squat there. You will be a commoner when you enter. The strongest people that opt to reside there are ones like you. It is true skill that sets them apart. When you are there, you might find yourself able to kill a King.”

“Why am I going to that place with you?” Han Sen frowned.

A place like that did indeed seem to be good for him, but Han Sen didn’t think he was invincible enough to march in blindly.

The geno universe, in one way or another, had the Falsified-Sky Sutra. Demon was not the strongest race, though, and that meant there were powers out there that were even greater than it. Han Sen did not think Mister Ji would be invincible if he went to this place.

Furthermore, his power would be greatly suppressed. Death would find him easier there, so that wasn’t good.

“The legends say two god elites fought for a treasure in xenogeneic space, and that was how the place became Demon Grave. I am unsure which of them might have managed to take this treasure, but after their battle, there were many xenogeneic plants. The fruit they bear is very mystic, and I will need just one of them. I am hoping you will be able to go with me to retrieve it. If you aid me in this venture, you will be highly rewarded,” Mister Ji said seriously.

“If these fruits can provide such a big benefit, and they are still there for the taking, this place must be quite dangerous,” Han Sen said.

Mister Ji did not want to hide these facts. He picked up some notes and then laid out everything he had gathered. “Demon Grave has a lot of xenogeneic plants, but there are no xenogeneic creatures there. Don’t worry. But inside the place, there is an indigenous race. They are the lesser sort of race that can only wear geno armor. None of them can become Nobles. Growing up there, however, allows them to munch on as much of the xenogeneic fruit as they want. They cannot become proper Barons, but their raw strength is higher than the average soldier’s. They are roughly the equal of an average Baron.”

Mister Ji went on to say, “If they are outside that place, it matters little how strong they are. They are, for all intents and purposes, rubbish. Inside Demon Grave, however, even a King might lose to them. They are our biggest enemy to fear.”

Han Sen surveyed the information in front of him, and he found that most of the papers were drawings that had been done by hand. There weren’t any actual videos or surveillance photos.

“You cannot use tools in there. This is all we have, so take a look,” Mister Ji explained.

Han Sen kept on looking at the pictures that had been drawn, though, and he admired the artistic qualities.

The bodies of this race looked human-like, but they possessed butterfly wings. Their hair grew upwards like fire, and their bodies were like those of a human. They wore silver geno armor, and they looked really nice.

The documents said they were called Chaos. They were not Nobles, and nor were they xenogeneics. But their power could definitely be compared to that of a Baron.

They were nothing when they were out in the world, but they were scary inside their territory.

Chaos ate the xenogeneic fruit. While many others had ventured there, hoping to collect some—even Dukes—they were mostly killed.

But when Han Sen read the effects of those fruits, he was tempted.

Han Sen had eighty-six Baron geno points, and that was because he consistently ate the materials and weapons he found. He hadn’t cooked the horn arrows or the Pirate Bone Sword. He did eat the Toxic Fang Dagger, though. And after everything he’d consumed, he was still a while away from one hundred.

He killed Greataxe Viscount, but there were no materials for him to retrieve. He couldn’t get the dozen Baron geno points he needed.

After seeing the description of the xenogeneic fruit, Han Sen thought that maybe he’d be able to increase his own genes. If he could, he’d become a Viscount.

But still, it depended on the fruit itself. And fruit aside, there was already a fairly good motive that could prompt him to go on this venture. If he was able to get a few of the fruits, he could at least swap them for materials, too.

“Aside from the one I need, you can keep any others you collect. If I get the fruit I want, I will give you a Viscount armor that was forged from xenogeneic material. The defense of the gear is as good as it gets.” When Mister Ji said this, Han Sen was unbelievably tempted to join him.

Not only was it the prospect of Viscount armor, but being able to keep collected fruit was wondrous, too. Han Sen really wanted to go.

Mister Ji, seeing Han Sen not saying a word, still looked hesitant. So, he took out his phone and showed Han Sen a visual of the armor.

The armor was blue and made of scales. It looked like a fish-scale armorset.

Mister Ji smiled and said, “This Viscount Armor is called Aqua-Scale Armor. It is made from the scales of Viscount Aqua- Scale Snakes. Each snake only has one scale, so it took 265 to make this set.”

“If you think I’m worth all this, then sure. I will come with you.” Han Sen smiled and agreed to the trip. He looked calm and composed, but inwardly, he was drooling over the potential rewards.

Two hundred and sixty-five Viscount materials was incredible. Seeing the armor, Han Sen didn’t want to wear it. He wanted to eat it That set of armor could take him from Baron to Viscount, and from Viscount to Earl. That was not an armorset. That was a recovery soup.
