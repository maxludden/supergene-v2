  Han Sen knew what the Deep Abyss Knight’s problem was. He thought, “It looks like Deep Abyss Knight already combined with the universe’s god body by a god. His presence and scabbard are so similar, and the scabbard was made from a broken god personality. That means he is the scabbard’s master. He must be that Sky Armor God.”

“It is no wonder God told me not to bring out the scabbard when facing Sky Armor God. That is why. But that heads-up was fairly useless. How was I supposed to know when and where Sky Armor God would fight me? I could not hold off on using the scabbard forever. With that being the case, what is the point in owning the scabbard in the first place?”

After guessing Sky Armor God’s identity, Han Sen was not keen on standing down. He continued looking at Sky Armor God, who was doing the same.

Sky Armor God was holding the scabbard. Although he resonated with the scabbard because it was man-made, recovering his body with it would still take some time and tricks. Furthermore, Sky Armor God did not want to open his chest in public and fit his bone back inside.

For now, Sky Armor God only held the scabbard. The purple and black flames on his body kept burning as he looked at Han Sen.

It was not an option for him to take the scabbard, concede, and leave the space battleground. That was impossible. Gods had the dignity of gods. Even if Sky Armor God wanted to leave, he had to leave as the victor.

“Because you took my god personality, this is your unlucky day ” Sky Armor God stared at Han Sen. He raised the scabbard and looked at him with disdain. “As your reward for returning the scabbard, I will allow you to die by the scabbard.”

After that, Sky Armor God waved his arm. The scabbard carried a scary purple and black knife light. It came straight for Han Sen.

The knife light acted as if it was splitting space in half. It was so powerful that it made people’s hearts tremble. When seeing this slash, the expressions on the faces of many deified xenogeneics changed.

Han Sen’s body quickly flashed away. He had dodged the knife light. When it appeared again, it was on the other side of space.

Galaxy Teleportation. Han Sen had practiced his teleportation abilities for a long time. He had finally practiced Galaxy Teleportation, but Han Sen had only studied a part of it. He modified Space Teleportation into a version that was more suitable for his body.

Because of the Dongxuan Aura’s power buff, Han Sen’s Break Space Flash was faster than God’s Wander. He used Space Teleportation as a normal teleportation talent. It was even faster than short-distance teleportation.

No one expected Han Sen would be able to dodge that slashing power. Sky Armor God waved the scabbard again. He swung it at Han Sen. This time, it was stronger and faster. It suddenly ripped space to appear directly in front of Han Sen.

Han Sen’s body was able to flash away, so the knife light missed its target.

“How many attacks are you able to evade?” Sky Armor God coldly asked. He started slashing with the scabbard at an even faster pace.

Sky Armor God slashed a dozen times. Each slash was faster and harder than the one before. He was slashing out many purple and black space cracks, which were like deep trenches in the vastness of space.

Even so, not a single one of them was able to damage Han Sen.

“That is a very fast space teleportation skill. It seems faster than the Very High’s God’s Wander. This Dollar is not an easy fellow to beat.” Sky Palace Leader was shocked by the performance.

“God Spirit combined body,” the woman said. “That power can challenge a true god class and perhaps something even stronger. Dollar’s Space Teleportation speed can dodge the striking attacks. That is very rare. It is a shame that evading attacks is ultimately pointless. He cannot go against the Sky Armor God and slay a god. He will lose.”

“Going against the Sky Armor God and slaying a god is not easy. If this was Golden Growler, he might stand a chance of beating the enemy.” Sky Palace Leader looked at Han Sen and said, “Dollar’s body fitness is strong, but he is still only butterfly class. If he could become a true god, perhaps he could stand a chance.”

All the elites of every race understood Han Sen’s situation. Relying on the unlimited Space Teleportation, he was able to dodge the Deep Abyss Knight’s attacks. But who knew Space Teleportation itself cost energy? To keep using Space Teleportation like that meant he would eventually run out of power. Once that happened, he was going to lose.

“Dollar’s Space Teleportation is very powerful. It looks like he can use it whenever and however he wants. He does not need to prepare time for it, and he can keep using it to move. That is stronger than the Very High’s God’s Wander.” The Extreme King’s Second Uncle profusely complimented the talent.

Bai King looked at the space battleground without speaking. His eyes looked strange. He felt a bit angry. “A God Spirit has descended to earth. He took the Deep Abyss Knight’s body. They are getting more ballsy.”

Bai King recognized Sky Armor God. After all, his power had been able to combine with the Return Empty Scabbard. It was too easy to guess the identity of the villain.

It did not matter who was king of the Extreme King at the time. Any of them would have despised Sky Armor God. The same applied to Bai King. If he was able to strike, he would want to be like Knife King and cut out Sky Armor God’s bones again.

Sky Armor God thought Space Teleportation required a lot of power. All he had to do was slash a few more times to make Han Sen exhausted. When he could no longer use Space Teleportation, he could kill him.

Han Sen kept using Space Teleportation without reprieve, and he was showing no signs of slowing down. That surprised Sky Armor God.

In fact, it was not just Sky Armor God who was surprised. Even God, who was in the garden, was surprised. “He is continuously using Space Teleportation, yet his body does not look like it is getting tired. It is not just his body that is strong. His body keeps drawing in energy from the universe to keep his energy reserves full. The Very High can barely do something like that even if they max out Sky and Men Combined Together. He is just a butterfly and can already do this. Is it a simple talent, or has he practiced it a lot?”

Ordinary deified creatures were afraid of using too much power, but Han Sen had four battle bodies that were combined. The Dongxuan Battle Body was able to keep on absorbing energy directly from the universe. It kept providing him with energy. If Han Sen’s body did not collapse, he could fight endlessly. He did not have to worry about exhaustion.

Sky Armor God saw the problem. He coldly grunted. “In that case, I will make you stop hiding.”

The scabbard slashed out like a shadow. Many knife lights created a crack in space. He was going to trap Han Sen inside a space crack.

Space Teleportation was actually a space movement. If Sky Armor God cracked the space around Han Sen, he would be totally disconnected from it. Even if Han Sen had his powerful Space Teleportation skill, he could not escape it.

Han Sen kept teleporting. More cracks were showing up in space, so there were fewer places for him to teleport to.

The space battleground was not the real universe. It was just an area of space. Its power was limited. Han Sen did not have enough space to move around freely.

Han Sen did not expect to keep running around forever. Teleporting was a way for him to observe. He wanted to learn about Sky Armor God’s power. He did not know anything about Sky Armor God. People needed to know their enemy, so Han Sen had to learn about Sky Armor God.

Han Sen had slain two gods. He did not mind doing it again, but he needed to make sure it was a success. He could not blindly attack and end up dying.

“Where are you running to?” Sky Armor God kept slashing. Purple and black knife lights kept cutting space up, producing the scary space cracks.

Han Sen was now surrounded by space cracks from all directions. He was trapped in the sole area that had not been broken, but space there was cut off from the outside. No matter how strong Han Sen’s Space Teleportation was, he could no longer teleport away.

In Blood Legion, Lou Lie looked at Sky Armor God with fire. He recognized who Sky Armor God was. “It is over. Dollar is strong, but fighting a god is too much. It was a shame it was not me encountering this god. Otherwise, I might have been able to kill him.”
