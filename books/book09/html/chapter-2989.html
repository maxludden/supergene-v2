<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The young man’s hand almost touched Han Sen’s neck when a knife
light suddenly blocked it. The knife light and hand light hit each
other. It left a bloody mark on the young man’s hand.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace’s Under the Sky Knife skill is quite amazing.” The
young man looked at the bloody mark on his hand and smiled even
harder. He swung his hand. The wound on his hand was gone.</p>
<p>Han Sen dove into Under the Sky mind. He did not move. He just
looked at the young man. His knife went down.</p>
<p>“I want to see how much you can endure.” The young man’s hand
changed. Time and space also changed.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knife was slower. His place was swapped. The time and
space power was similar to the legendary holy body.</p>
<p>Back when Littleflower joined the geno being scroll fight, he
had displayed this power.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body’s time and space kept twisting, but the young man
could not break Han Sen’s knife skill. He already dodged Han Sen’s
attack. He made Han Sen slower, but he could not hurt Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s place was changed, but he was not afraid. He still
slashed toward an area where there was no one.</p>
<p>When the young man wanted to attack Han Sen’s weak spot, a knife
light appeared in space and stopped his hand.</p>
<p>The young man’s face looked more terrible. He noticed there was
something wrong. The space around Han Sen was twisted, but Han Sen
had already cast knife lights to stop his attacks. He was being
stopped by Han Sen’s knife lights.</p>
<p>“It looks like your holy body is just like that, yet you want to
exceed Qin Xiu. Pah!” Han Sen waved his knife as he spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen was actually confused. The demon lady and the others
said that only Littleflower practiced talents of the holy body, but
there were obviously others who had practiced Qin Xiu’s holy body.
The holy body was not as rare as the demon lady led him to
believe.</p>
<p>That was why Han Sen used words to offend the young man. He
hoped the young man would accidentally spill the beans on some of
the holy body’s secrets.</p>
<p>“That is just the beginning.” The young man looked mad. His eyes
turned a weird blue color. Nothing but blue was visible in his
eyes.</p>
<p>His body’s blood vessels were showing. Even the very small blood
vessels were like small dragonflies and little snakes around his
snake. His blood was starting to show.</p>
<p>“Blue blood.” Han Sen was a bit shocked by this, so he looked
right at the young man.</p>
<p>As the blood changed, the young man’s presence grew scarier. It
was like an angry ghost that would eat everything as fuel for its
power was coming out from hell.</p>
<p>“Yes. I am a blue blood. Qin Xiu used his genes for a blueprint
and combined it with better genes. That is why I am here. Although
he did not admit it, it is a truth that can never be denied. I am
greater than he was. I should be the real Qin Xiu. I should be the
real Sacred Leader.” The young man’s eyes looked a little
insane.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly understood a lot. Back then, Qin Xiu, tried to
copy people but gave up for some reason.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this young man must have been the failed test
subjects that Qin Xiu abandoned. Despite what was done to them,
they betrayed Sacred.</p>
<p>He looked at the young man’s face and noted how much he looked
like Qin Xiu. He was very similar.</p>
<p>Although they looked alike, because Qin Xiu’s presence was so
special, the young man did not possess the presence that Qin Xiu
had. Thus, Han Sen had not noticed how similar they</p>
<p>were.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>While Han Sen was checking him out, the young man’s flames
turned solid. His whole body was like a transparent crystal.</p>
<p>“That is… That is a God Spirit’s presence.” Han Sen frowned as
he looked at the young man. What came out from him was the special
presence only given off by God Spirits.</p>
<p>“Yes. I have Qin Xiu’s genes, and I have an Annihilation class
God Spirit’s genes. I am stronger than Qin Xiu. I am the real
leader of this world.” The young man’s body was becoming stronger.
The armor he had was vaporized by his presence. His naked body was
revealed.</p>
<p>His body was like a crystal. One was able to see the blue blood
coursing through his body. The blue-blood power and God Spirit
mixed together made his presence very strange. It was like he was a
human but not a human. It was like he was a god but not a god.</p>
<p>“If you are so good, why did not rule the universe after Qin Xiu
was killed?” Han Sen deliberately looked at him with disdain.</p>
<p>“That is Qin Xiu’s fault,” the young man crazily said. “If he
had given me the gene prototype, I would have ruled the world.
Those from Sacred and the God Spirits would be crying before my
feet.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the young man was very stable and perhaps end up
leaking a secret or two. He quickly asked, “So, what is the gene
prototype?” “It is… It is Qin Xiu’s fault…” The young man crazily
spoke. His eyes were full of energy. He raised his head and roared
to the sky. His scary power was like a volcano erupting.</p>
<p>The body only had blue blood. In a moment, the blue blood seemed
like it was burning. It made the whole body a transparent blue. The
flames on the body were blue too.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He was a little bit worried. He was afraid
Littleflower might turn out like this young man.</p>
<p>He had used all the power he had in the Alliance to search for
Littleflower inside the sanctuaries, but there had yet to be any
news of him. That made him very worried. “Qin Xiu! Qin Xiu! What
are you doing?” Han Sen thought Qin Xiu was scarier than these God
Spirits. At least God Spirits had their rules and principles to
follow. Qin Xiu had just done what he pleased. He had not concerned
himself with the consequences of his actions. No one was able to
stop him. He had no moral compass.</p>
<p>To be without rules was a very scary thing, and Qin Xiu was the
scariest demon in the deep abyss of not having any rules.</p>
<p>Killing God Spirits, using gene technology to mix races… Even
the holy beasts he grew had their horns taken and souls claimed.
The genes were used to replicate people. He went against
nature.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu had done many scary things. It was much scarier than
what a God Spirit did.</p>
<p>The young man, who looked like a blue crystal God Spirit, stared
at Han Sen. “Anything related to Qin Xiu should die.” He slowly
spoke each word. When he was done, he reached out his hand and
continued looking at Han Sen. Suddenly, the blue light was
released. It twisted all of space.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt like his body was going left and right in the time
and space power. Somehow, he was in front of the young man. The
young man’s hand grabbed him by the neck.</p>
<p>“Die!” The young man’s face looked murderous and full of rage.
His hand was full of power. The blue light was spilling. He was
going to break Han Sen’s neck.</p>
