    <p>“Who is in danger?” Tang Zhenliu asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Dollar. He is gambling. Even if you’ve successfully gambled a hundred
      times, all it takes is one loss. If he loses, he’ll be done for,” Gu
      Qingcheng explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gambling?” Everyone looked at Gu Qingcheng with confusion. The fight
      between Han Sen and Six Paths was too fast for them to keep track of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng, after a moment of thought, said, “Six Paths Emperor’s sword
      skills are incredible. He is a champion with the sword. He won’t grant an
      opponent a moment of reprieve, and he is flawless. He does everything he
      can to take the advantage and make his opponent lose hope of victory. His
      sword skills are something you can’t overcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does that mean Dollar is actually losing?” Wang Yuhang opened his eyes
      wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng shook her head. “Maybe not. If it was someone else, they
      might use strength to break the attack. If the power was sufficient to
      suppress Six Paths, his sword skill would break. I don’t think anyone can
      possess more strength than Six Paths in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary,
      however. So, Dollar is doing something different. He is gambling a
      potential victory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gamble?” Wang Yuhang still did not understand. He had no clue what she
      was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng looked at Han Sen and said, “Yes, he is gambling. The
      Champion Sword is using his experience to beat the opponent. He’s not
      supposed to reveal a single flaw he has to his foe. Dollar, on the other
      hand, is doing things differently. He is not trying to uncover flaws
      through skills. He is going with the flow, rather. When the enemy strikes,
      he falls back. When the enemy falls back, he strikes. It’s keeping Six
      Paths from gaining the advantage and pushing Dollar to the point where his
      hope begins to wane.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That sounds good. Why is it gambling?” Tang Zhenliu did not understand,
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng said quietly, “Swordskills can be different. You cannot
      predict where Six Paths Emperor, who is so strong, or an average
      run-of-the-mill swordsman, will put their strength.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they knew why Dollar was gambling. It was hard to predict how an
      opponent would use their sword precisely, especially for a fight as wild
      as that. Everything was happening at breakneck speed, and it was difficult
      to determine where the next strike would fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen did this correctly, he could slowly eliminate Six Paths’ sword
      power. But that was just the power of his sword, and there was still no
      guarantee of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he blocked the wrong direction and failed to beat back the Six Paths
      Sword, things could go bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that time, Han Sen was using his finger to flick Six Paths’ blade
      away. It didn’t cost much strength, but it required a lot of unflagging
      judgment That was much harder than exerting total strength. He couldn’t
      afford to miss once.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If this continues, Dollar will miss and Six Paths is going to win. He has
      gotten so strong… I hope I don’t have to meet him until I reach the
      rankings of the ten Son of Gods.” A powerful elite now realized Han Sen
      was actually in trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gamble that he could not afford to lose. Dollar only had one
      life, whereas Six Paths had many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed and the fight raged on. The faces of the audience began to
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Weird. Why does he keep succeeding? Does he know Six Paths’ skills better
      than Six Paths himself?”
    </p>
    <p>“No way! How can he always be right and never miss?”</p>
    <p>“This Dollar is weird.”</p>
    <p>
      “Does he have Falsified-Sky power, and that means he always moves
      correctly?”
    </p>
    <p>“This is unbelievable.”</p>
    <p>
      The match continued, alongside much discussion. No one understood why
      Dollar was so lucky in his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>“Interesting.” Jade Shura looked at Han Sen with much intrigue.</p>
    <p>
      Six Paths looked interested, too. He was keen to see how long his opponent
      could last He was pushing Blood Sword to the max, but still, he could not
      penetrate Han Sen’s defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      As everyone looked on, trying to predict how much longer he’d last, the
      swordlight suddenly disappeared. Six Paths withdrew his sword and stopped
      attacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is some incredible power control and foresight. You are undoubtedly
      the best I have ever seen,” Six Paths spoke to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Six Paths but did not say anything. He knew the next
      attack would be even scarier. Life Sword was even more frightening than
      Blood Sword.
    </p>
    <p>If Blood Sword was a Champion Sword, Life Sword was a Killer Sword.</p>
    <p>
      You could predict the Champion Sword, but not the Killer Sword. Han Sen
      was not psychic; he was just excellent when it came to prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths Emperor then turned into a different person. Now, he was like an
      animal that was full of the wild unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brandished his sword towards Han Sen, prompting Han Sen to flick it
      again. But this time, he could not send it astray. Six Paths’ sword skills
      had changed. He started to slash without a moment of reprieve in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths became a monster that wished to strangle Han Sen. He came out
      from different directions to attack Han Sen’s weakspot, and he took aim at
      his Life Door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t steady, and the chance of calculating the attacks was
      non-existent. Every slash did not seem connected, and they couldn’t be
      predicted. Han Sen had no choice but to fight
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s body then glowed with holy light. He could not predict the
      flight of the Six Paths Sword, and he had to react instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both like a pair of ancient monsters, battling in a primitive
      arena.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These two are too scary. We’re only talking about battle skills, and yet
      they can cause a reaction such as this? Their battle powers must be inside
      their bones,” Furnace Emperor said with a little awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dollar is starting to take advantage,” the Sacred leader spoke to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t just Sacred leader thinking this. The entire elite audience had
      watched Six Paths unleash himself. Yet when he used Life Sword, he was
      suppressed by Dollar and put at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Powerful Dollar. I wonder where he comes from?” Outer Sky looked
      confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths Emperor used Life Sword and got suppressed. This had only
      happened once before. And at that time, Six Paths hadn’t been this strong,
      either.
