    <p>There were many things that couldn’t be truly understood by merely reading a book; instead, they had to be
        figured out by each individual. The teachings of the Xuan Men were this sort of knowledge.</p>

    <p>Han Sen planned to find a few people that could research the Xuan Men information on his behalf and determine
        what content might be suitable for humans to learn. He also wanted to establish a special school in the Alliance
        that would teach the Xuan Men techniques to other humans. He wanted to pass on the knowledge and expand the
        lineage of the Xuan Men.</p>

    <p>It was just as Mister White had said: if one or two people in every ten million were able to follow the righteous
        path of Xuan Men, then that would be enough.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly, Ji Yanran expressed an interest in the subject. Han Sen quickly turned the project over to her.</p>

    <p>But Ji Yanran didn’t do as Han Sen hoped. Instead of building a school for the purpose of teaching the Xuan Men
        philosophy, she opened up a Martial Hall. In it, she would start by teaching the Xuan Men martial arts, whereas
        the philosophies of the Xuan Men way would be taught at a later time.</p>

    <p>“No one will treasure something that is earned very easily. And the Xuan Men way of thinking is not suitable for
        everyone. It requires too much heart. By teaching them this way, the philosophies are likely to be accepted by
        more people,” Ji Yanran explained.</p>

    <p>Ji Yanran’s line of thinking made sense to Han Sen. He had only learned the secret techniques of the Xuan Men,
        anyway. He didn’t actually understand the core concepts of the Xuan Men way himself. Potential students would
        have absolutely no experience with the Xuan Men techniques going in, so it would likely be a waste of time for
        them to learn. Not many people would ever be able to understand this stuff.</p>

    <p>“If we can’t even start a school, do you really think your Martial Hall will work?” Han Sen asked, purely to be
        contrary.</p>

    <p>Ji Yanran laughed. “This will be easy. We only need your big face for an advertisement, and our doors will be
        swarmed with upper-class socialites begging to sign up. They only need to hear that these techniques were
        practiced by the great Han Sen. I wager they’d fight to the death and use any trick in the book to get their
        kids accepted into our Martial Hall.”</p>

    <p>“Mister White’s intention was to see the Xuan Men expanded. If you approach things like this, you are only
        serving the needs of the upper-class.” Han Sen frowned.</p>

    <p>Ji Yanran laughed and said, “Don’t worry. Over the years, most ideas start with high society. Once an idea has
        been accepted by the wealthy and powerful, it is more easily disseminated to the lower class. This is especially
        true when it comes to the ideals of the Xuan Men. In ancient times, famous philosophers and scholars would
        embark on lengthy journeys to convince people of all different societal levels of their ideals. Now, we just
        need time and advertisements.”</p>

    <p>“Honey, don’t work yourself to the bone. You should bring on some added help.” Han Sen could not be bothered to
        help her himself, of course. If she was willing to shoulder the responsibility, then that was fine with him.</p>

    <p>The box Han Sen had taken from Holy Town was locked, so he couldn’t open it. He had tried to pry it open in many
        different ways, but nothing worked.</p>

    <p>Even Yisha’s power had been insufficient to break the jade stone box. Because Han Sen hadn’t been able to find
        out what was inside, he put the box away for the moment.</p>

    <p>Instead, he turned his attention to the bone needle. It was the one Han Sen took from the palace maze. There were
        twelve drops of deified blood still inside it. They represented twelve different deified blood pulses.</p>

    <p>Han Sen did not use them. First, he wanted to research them.</p>

    <p>Because Han Sen’s body still contained more Ghost Bone power than he could use, he currently had no need for the
        energy that the deified blood pulses offered.</p>

    <p>He pondered the blood pulses for a while, and he eventually decided to have a drop anyway.</p>

    <p>Han Sen chose to consume the drop he had retrieved from the Blood Demon. It was of the blood element. He wanted
        to see if it might help his Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>

    <p>Han Sen lifted the bone needle above his chest. And then, he thrust it into his heart.</p>

    <div class="tables">
        <table class="center">
            <tr>
                <th class="note">Note: This was not an intravenous injection like one would receive from an ordinary
                    doctor. If a normal person tried this as Han Sen did, they would most definitely die. Do not try
                    this at home.
            </tr>
        </table>
        <!--This was not an intravenous injection like one would receive from an ordinary doctor. If a normal person tried this as Han Sen did, they would most definitely die. Do not try this at home.-->
    </div>

    <p>The bone needle pierced right through his heart, and a drop of deified blood spilled into him.</p>

    <p>Han Sen was about to begin refining the deified blood when he suddenly heard an announcement play in his head.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>“Successful infusion of deified gene. Deified gene +1. Deified progress is 1/100.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>After that announcement, Han Sen felt a scary power explode in his heart and sweep into every corner of his body.
        His cells shuddered as the new power surged through him, and he began to change.</p>

    <p>His body felt like he was shedding, sloughing off layer upon layer of old cells. This entire process lasted a
        whole day before coming to an end. Trails of a black substance littered the floor, like the flaky remains of a
        dead snake. It looked quite scary.</p>

        <!--Duke Genes: 17-->
        <!--Deified Progress: 1/100-->
    </div>

    <p>Han Sen was shocked. He did not know what “deified progress” meant.</p>

    <p>“Are deified genes different from the genes that come before? What does ‘deified progress’ mean? Does this mean I
        will be deified once the number reaches a hundred? I can achieve deified status without maxing out any other
        genes?” Han Sen could not figure out what was going on.</p>

    <p>Han Sen studied himself after receiving his one deified gene. His body had changed. It was like his genes had all
        improved. What hadn’t improved, though, was his fitness. It was still at the level of a Duke.</p>

    <p>Han Sen tried to refine another deified drop of blood. The process was exactly the same. Han Sen’s body changed
        again, and he received an additional deified gene point. His deified progress became 2/100. His fitness did not
        increase much.</p>

    <p>But if he was able to earn deified genes, that meant it was a power that humans could accept. That relaxed many
        of Han Sen’s worries, and he absorbed the rest of the deified blood.</p>

    <p>Over the next two weeks, Han Sen refined his deified blood. His deified progress became 12/100, and after the
        refining process, his fitness increased by quite a bit.</p>

    <p>But strangely, Han Sen didn’t gain any special blood pulse powers after receiving the deified blood pulses.</p>

    <p>“Where can I get more deified genes? Once I reach one hundred, I guess I’ll be able to find out what it does,”
        Han Sen thought to himself. It would be too difficult to kill deified beings by himself, though. At his current
        strength, it was an impossible task.</p>

    <p>“It’s a shame that the little red bird ate my Sun Raven. If it hadn’t, I could have given it a try. Perhaps I
        could eat the flesh of deified creatures,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

    <p>Thinking about the little red bird, Han Sen checked on the egg inside the bird’s nest again. Han Sen was shocked.
        A number of weird substance chains had appeared from the nest and were drilling into the red egg. The red color
        of the egg was shining brightly, as if it was being consumed by a red fire.</p>
