"A time and space real super god body with Huangfu Jing's personal super strong attack powers makes her a killing queen-kind of existence." Han Sen could not help but compliment her.

"Interesting time and space movement talents. Since when have crystallizers been so talented?" God squinted and looked at Huangfu Jing exiting the stage with elegance.

Han Sen's heart jumped. He did not say anything. He knew the more he said, the more he would expose.

It was unknown it was deliberate, but God asked Han Sen, "What do you think?"

"That is an interesting talent, but primitive deified level is too low," Han Sen coldly said.

"It does not matter the level of an interesting creature," God harshly replied. "Even if someone becomes true god, boring people are still boring."

"Perhaps, but I am not interested in any other creature," Han Sen said. "I just want to know if I can get into the top 100 to claim the rewards on offer."

"You must work harder," God said with a laugh.

"Do you not see me working hard?" Han Sen picked up a hunk of flesh from the Ink Feather God Bird. It was freshly cooked. He inserted it into his mouth. He used Consume to refine it. He was also waiting for the third match of the geno god list to start.

"Consume is the geno art of the Consume Ants. It is weird that you can make use of Consume and eat xenogeneic genes to evolve. That evolution power is very rare in the universe." God looked at Han Sen with interest.

"You can have a slice if you want," Han Sen said with a smile.

"In that case, I will not deny the offer." Han Sen had only said it for fun, but God really wanted to try some out. God picked up some ink feather god bird meat and started to chew it. Its mouth and hands were full of grease. "It tastes so good."

Han Sen could not be bothered talking to God. When he saw the people in the third match, he felt compelled to throw up the ink feather bird god meat he had just eaten.

Space Garden... Sword Fairy... Han Sen was thinking about who might use that name. Aside from Gu Qingcheng, there was no other.

Of course, not long later, Gu Qingcheng, who was wearing green clothes, appeared on the space battleground. She floated in like a fairy. Her opponent was a deified of the Extreme King. The great coincidence here was that the Extreme King deified was also using a sword, but it was a greatsword.

"Huh, it is her." Upon seeing Gu Qingcheng, God was shocked.

Han Sen knew God knew Gu Qingcheng, but he still asked, "What? Do you know her? Is she famous?"

"She is a very interesting spirit," God said with a smile. "She is one of the very few that did not make a wish before me. I did not expect she would show up here. This will be interesting, to say the least."

Han Sen thought, It must not be incorrect. This God is the God the seventh team encountered.

When many spirits in the universe heard the words "Space Garden," they became excited.

"More deified creatures are joining from Space Garden."

"In the past, the Flower Gods did not have deifieds. Why are there two deified showing up now?"

Creatures that did not know what happened started asking around. It was not long before they learned that Han Sen had taken over Space Garden.

"It is no wonder Space Garden suddenly has so many deified creatures. It is God's Daddy who is there."

"Godfather Han Sen is so strong. The power to make deified creatures is invincible."

"Barr and Queen are so strong. It looks like deified creatures that are blessed by Han Sen are stronger than ordinary deified creatures."

"Perhaps it is just a coincidence. Let's see how this Sword Fairy performs first. There is no way that all the creatures Han Sen blessed to become deified are stronger than usual."

"Who knows? But I think Godfather Han is very powerful. He can randomly create so many deified creatures."

"I am afraid this match will not be an easy one to win. After all, the opponent is an Extreme King deified."

People had just finished talking when Gu Qingcheng revealed the sword in her hands. She swung it and slashed toward the Extreme King deified elite.

"Good timing!" the Extreme King deified coldly shouted. He raised the greatsword as substance chains arose like the tide. They were coming straight for Gu Qingcheng.

Gu Qingcheng's swordlight strangely flashed through space. Ordinary creatures were unable to see what happened. That Extreme King deified's chest was delivered a massive wound that exposed his ribs. One saw a large lesion on his organs. God blood spilled like rain. Suddenly, the face of the Extreme King deified looked shocked. He did not let Gu Qingcheng slash again. He was quick to concede and escape the space battleground.

"You took my hit and did not die. You are not bad," Gu Qingcheng coldly said. She put her sword away and flew out of the space battleground.

"Holy shit! One slash to defeat an Extreme King deified... That is too powerful."

"This Sword Fairy is too cool. Her sword skills are so overbearing."

"Godfather Han is so strong. The deified creatures he blessed are better and better."

"I do not know how many deified creatures Godfather Han has created, but if this keeps going, the universe is going to be conquered by him."

"Han Sen that asshole! What kind of power does he possess? How can he make so many deified creatures that easily? How can they all be so brutal?"

"You will all find a way to enter Space Garden. Capture Han Sen, no matter the cost."

Not just ordinary creatures were like this. Even the leaders of high races had red eyes. They wanted to go to Space Garden, capture Han Sen, and force him to make their people deified.

In Space Garden, Qin Xuan was worried. She said, "Han Sen always wants us to keep a low profile. With you guys joining like that, won't it cause trouble?"

Little Uncle Wang Yuhang laughed and said, "Don't worry. Brother King told people Han Sen was in Space Garden. Little Sen will be the scapegoat. It will be fine."

"Ha!" Gu Qingcheng had only just returned when she heard Wang Yuhang speak. She could not help herself from laughing.

Xie Qing King laughed and said, "In the future, Space Garden is going to become so famous. Of course, we are going to use this opportunity to improve the reputation of Space Garden and get a reputation for San Mu too. He will be happy."

"I know, right?" Bao'er was holding a big piece of fruit. She was eating. She totally agreed and kept nodding, she clearly just wanted to see chaos more than anything. She did not want to be bored.

Now, Han Sen could not be happy. The first three rounds had three humans, including himself. That was a bit over-the-top.

Did God notice something and deliberately set up these matches? Han Sen looked at God, who was eating meat. There was nothing really suspicious about God's behavior, so he denied the thought. I do not think so. Otherwise, God would not have been so surprised when he saw Gu Qingcheng. Perhaps it really was just a coincidence. Maybe there are only those two from Space Garden joining.

Thinking about this possibility, Han Sen felt worse. He knew he had reminded them many times to maintain an extremely low profile.

Thinking about the personalities of those people, none of them knew what it meant to keep a low profile. Also, Space Garden had many resources for them. They were leveling up much faster now, so there was no way Han Sen could keep them quiet.

God bless me. Please do not let these monsters find out they are human. Han Sen still did not know he had become the scapegoat of Space Garden, which was now overwhelmed with deifieds.
