The whole of Steel City was a chaotic mess. All the Dukes and Marquises had been gathered in the city, and the tension was electric. The different races all suspected one-another, which led to many conflicts and brawls that served no purpose.

Ultimately, the traitor stayed hidden. And above all, that meant Han Sen had no choice but to remain where he was. He was not allowed to leave.

Although the Rebate had been trying to negotiate, the Destroyed were adamant about not permitting anyone to leave Planet Sodi until the traitor was found. Those of the other races were not allowed to leave, and that included the Rebate themselves.

Han Sen believed there to be other individuals mixed up in this, people who were aiding the traitor in her escape. He thought much of the current chaos and anarchy was a deliberate concoction to help the true traitor get away. It was difficult to determine the truth of this, though. There were no more leads or clues, so whether the traitor was alone or working with others was impossible to confirm.

And that was the reason that all the races were suspicious of each other.

The next day, after Han Sen left his room, the restaurant was jam-packed with elites again. This time, however, he was unable to find a seat. Just as he was going to take his meal back to his room, though, the Feather woman from the day before called him over and said, “Why don’t we sit together?”

Han Sen glanced over at her empty table. Although others were keen to watch her, no one dared to actually sit next to her.

Han Sen knew this was because she was a very suspicious individual. No one wanted to sit with her and risk drawing attention and trouble to themselves. Their fear was more about the other elites than the woman herself.

Han Sen did not care about that, though. He had already interacted with her the day before, so sitting with her again wouldn’t make a difference. The suspicion wasn’t going to rinse off that easily.

Han Sen and his companions had just sat down when the Extreme King lady entered the restaurant. People did not know she was of the Extreme King, but her slap had made people afraid of her.

The Extreme King woman, having just entered the establishment, was unable to find a seat for herself. So, she walked to the table she had used the day before.

There were a few Dragons sitting there that day, though. And amongst them was Dragon Six.

Everyone saw the woman approach Toxic Dragon Old Six, and everyone knew immediately that they’d be in for some mid-meal entertainment.

The Extreme King marched right up to the table and informed them directly, “I will allow you guys the chance to leave now.”

No one expected that woman to be so brash; after all, no one spoke to Toxic Dragon Old Six like that. Everyone was very interested in seeing how he’d react to her.

Toxic Dragon Old Six rolled his eyes and then looked at the woman with flat eyes. “Why?”

The woman did not speak. Instead, she just punched him.

Toxic Dragon Old Six hummed. His fist suddenly glared with a green Evilbreaker power, and he lifted it against the woman’s mighty fist. The two powers thrummed against each other.

But because the two people hadn’t released all their powers, they both pulled back before they created a restaurant- destroying explosion. It looked like a tie, though, and neither of the two seemed willing to back-off.

But Toxic Dragon Old Six’s eyes widened. He stood up and said, “Let’s go.”

Then, he and his friends quickly left. He allowed the woman to occupy the table all by herself.

Everyone watched in silence as the woman ordered her meal. No one could understand why Dragon Six had been so willing to back off and give her his table. This also raised a few suspicions in regards to the identity of the woman.

Han Sen knew that the woman hailed from Extreme King, so he knew why Dragon Six was so willing to walk away. And furthermore, Dragon Six had deliberately chosen that seat to test her. After that punch, Dragon Six seemed to fully acknowledge who she was. And so, he relented. He knew he shouldn’t bother her anymore.

While Han Sen was still in thought, Barr lifted his bone knife and ran at Han Sen, shouting, “You will die today! Either in here or out there.”

Han Sen frowned. If Barr had come looking for him, that meant the man had found a way to resist the cold. Han Sen was not afraid of him, but he did find this a bit of a nuisance.

Steel City was locked down, so it wasn’t as if he could run away or escape.

“Barr, do not be so cocky. This place belongs to the Rebate.” The Rebate manager frowned.

“So?” After Barr said that, he lost all of his patience. He lifted his knife toward Han Sen while a red and black light amassed on the blade. When he unleashed that strike, it was sure to slice the entire hotel in half.

The entire lobby descended into chaos. Everyone in the knifelight’s path tried to run away. No one wanted to get involved with whatever was about to happen.

Han Sen kept his seat, though. He didn’t move away, but he did draw a pistol and fire a shot at Barr.

Barr looked murderous. The bone knife struck the incoming bullet, though. The bullet was stopped, and Barr was saved from the gunshot. That knifelight had been so strong, however, that the strike kept coming. It sliced through the lobby, causing enough instability in the building to bring the whole place crumbling down.

Han Sen dodged Barr’s knifelight. And as he did, his pistols swept smoothly up to point at Barr. He began firing without reprieve.

Barr was not very good when it came to defense. He didn’t even bother defending himself, and so the bullets fell on him easily. The ice light of those bullets began to spread across him, too.

But this time, the ice light was unable to freeze him. A silver necklace with a gold jewel hung from Barr’s neck.

After the ice light exploded, the gold jewel on Barr’s necklace began to glow with a lava-looking, gold flame. It melted the icy force and kept it from doing anything.

“A Light Fireseed necklace!” someone screamed, recognizing the necklace Barr was now wearing.

When Barr saw that the necklace worked and that Han Sen’s freezing power no longer posed a threat, he smiled. Then he looked at Han Sen with rage. He waved his knife and screamed, “I am going to eat you!”

Han Sen’s heart jumped. He summoned his dragon wings, his dragon ear wings, and petrified his skin. He flapped his wings, and his red body teleported away from the incoming strike.

Barr roared. He lifted his knife and ran after Han Sen. His eyes looked like they were on fire with the desire to kill Han Sen.

The restaurant had been thrown into turmoil. No one knew who started this all, but everyone was now fighting. And as everyone fought against each other in a massive brawl, the hotel was rapidly reduced to splinters.

No one knew where Toxic Dragon Old Six came from, but he was back, and he threw a punch towards the Feather woman that was near Han Sen.

The woman flapped her wings and avoided the strike, though. Toxic Dragon Old Six was unable to catch up with her.

It was possible that he deliberately didn’t go after the Feather woman, because Toxic Dragon Old Six seemed fine with allowing the green light shrouding his fist to come down towards Little Angel and the others.

Little Angel and Zero were able to avoid the strike, but another few xenogeneics came forward to attack them.

Han Sen had stumbled outside to fight Barr, and he finally realized what was going on. People were suspicious of the girls around him, and they wanted to test out his companions. Han Sen couldn’t believe it.

Neither Han Meng’er, Little Angel, or Zero was the traitor they were looking for. But even so, it mattered little. If Han Sen’s companions could be killed, that’s all that mattered to the others. Somehow, they had just gained a horde of new enemies.
