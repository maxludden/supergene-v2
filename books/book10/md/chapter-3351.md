“If this is just playing dead, I can do it too,” Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He controlled his body and toned down all of the presence and reactions inside him. He even made his heart stop beating.

Although all of his power was restricted by Dust Sky, he could still control his body. Doing this was nothing special. Han Sen was a professional when it came to things like this.

After Han Sen’s presence and warmness were gone, the Evil God Beard that had snared him stopped tying him up. It became a little loose.

“It worked, but I cannot keep playing dead here forever. We are just bodies here now. If we keep playing dead, we will eventually tire out too much.” Han Sen wanted to ask Ancient Devil, but he was worried that if moving would garner the attention and ire of the Evil God Beard again. He had to hold on and wait and see what Ancient Devil was going to do first.

Han Sen knew Ancient Devil would eventually come back. He knew about the existence of the Evil God Beard, but he still went down to the depths of that place anyway. He must have had a way of dealing with it properly. He just had to sit and watch what Ancient Devil was going to do.

The two of them did not move. They asserted the appearance of corpses. The Evil God Beard did not let them go slowly. They both landed on the copper tablet’s bottom. It really hurt, but Han Sen did not dare react to the pain.

Around two hours later, the Evil God Beard around seemed to minimize its presence. It went under the bronze tablet. Now, Han Sen had only reduced his senses. His sense of power had become weaker. He did not know if any more Evil God Beards were lurking around them.

Suddenly, Han Sen heard some sound come from Ancient Devil. Someone was crawling up. Aside from Ancient Devil, it could not be anybody else.

Han Sen did not move a muscle. He opened his eyes slightly to peer at Ancient Devil, who was sitting. He sat cross-legged like a Buddha. His hands were up, and his lips mumbled. He did not, however, make a sound.

Ancient Devil’s actions did not aggravate the Evil God Beard around. It did not get close to him. As for Han Sen, who had just opened a small slit in his eyes, it was enough for the Evil God Beard to notice his play. Suddenly, a lot of it came for him like a cell of sea snakes.

Han Sen knew Ancient Devil had come prepared for all this, but he just did not understand how Ancient Devil did what he was doing.

Ancient Devil slowly got up off the floor. He was very casual. He looked like his usual self, but the Evil God Beard did not attack him.

Ancient Devil smiled at Han Sen. “Mister Han, I am leaving first. I am sure we will meet again soon.”

After that, Ancient Devil went behind the copper tablet and disappeared from view.

Han Sen wanted to follow, but the Evil God Beard was looking at him. Han Sen had to hold onto his urge. He had to keep playing dead.

“Ancient Devil’s skill is too much. I can’t replicate his talents. How am I supposed to get rid of the Evil God Beard? What lies behind the copper tablet? Is this the entrance to the tomb of the old leader of the God Chaos Party?” Han Sen’s mind raced through all sorts of possibilities.

He wanted to know where Ancient Devil was going. He wanted to discover something cool, but Han Sen knew he could not rush this. He had to remain calm and find a way to be free.

Squeak! Squeak!

While Han Sen was thinking about how to get rid of the Evil God Beard and follow after Ancient Devil, he suddenly heard a sound from not too far away. It was like someone whose teeth were rubbing against each other while sleeping.

“What is that sound?” Han Sen tried hiding all of his senses to pretend he was dead. He could not feel anything. Unfortunately, if he did not hide his sense, he would trigger the attention of the Evil God Beard again.

Han Sen got back to thinking about opening his eyes or not. He wondered if he should have a look and find out what it was, but he heard the sound come closer. It was like it was right next to him.

While he was listening to the squeaking sound right near his ear, he felt something touch his hair. Han Sen could not help but open his eyes to look. He was shocked by what he saw.

A white shadow was in front of him. It was the small, white rat that looked like a yellow weasel. It was a little white beast. It was in front of Han Sen making squeaky sounds with its fervent teeth.

Han Sen was most surprised by the fact that the small rat was right next to him. It was rubbing its teeth and waving its claws. Despite that, it was not triggering the reactions of the Evil God Beard. The Evil God Beard was just waving itself around elsewhere and not coming close. It seemed to be afraid of the small white rat.

Han Sen opened his eyes. He stopped pretending to be a corpse. The Evil God Beard looked at him, but it did not come any closer. That surprised Han Sen. He said, “This small white rat is surely nothing ordinary.”

The small white rat watched Han Sen open his eyes. It then started crawling toward the copper tablet. It went to where Ancient Devil had gone.

Han Sen quickly stood up. He followed after the small white rat.

The Evil God Beard felt Han Sen go and was appropriately annoyed. It raced toward him. After a certain point, it stopped. It did not want to go anywhere close to the small white rat.

Han Sen was delighted by this. He hurried up and followed after the small white rat.

The small white rat was much faster than Han Sen. It was already behind the copper tablet now. As Han Sen followed it, he noticed Ancient Devil wasn’t behind the copper tablet. There was no actual entrance to anything, as Han Sen thought there might be. There was only a complete bronze tablet with no crevice to slide into or anything of the sort.

“Weird. The copper tablet has no entrance. Where did Ancient Devil go?” Han Sen frowned.

While Han Sen was thinking, the small white rat jumped down to the bottom of the copper tablet. It landed under the black water. That water had lots of Evil God Beard moving around. When the little white rat jumped down, the Evil God Beard ran away from it. Nothing dared to touch it.

Han Sen had no other way to go. He gnashed his teeth and jumped after the little white rat. He then saw the little white rat raise its bum and start diving under.

Han Sen dove in after it. He immediately looked at the Evil God Beard. It was underneath the copper tablet. It was like there was a lot of seaweed at the bottom of the copper tablet’s base. It was like a cell of toxic snakes in a cave. People would not have been able to tell how many Evil God Beards might have resided there.

The small white rat dove down 21 or 24 feet down. Wherever it went, there was a lot of Evil God Beard. There was so much that Han Sen could not see what the copper tablet looked like anymore.
