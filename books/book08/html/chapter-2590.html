	<p>“Race weapons are deified as soon as they are created,” Yisha said, shaking her head. “They are smarter than the
		average deified weapon. They are stronger, too. If the weapon was used by a creature from the race that created
		it, the weapon would be incredibly beneficial to them. There wouldn’t be any such side-effects. If it was
		activated by someone of another race, however, they would adopt the traits and powers of the race the weapon
		belongs to. Their bodies would be invaded by the race’s genes, which would turn them into something weird.
		Unless you gain enough power to overwhelm the race weapon, you won’t be able to hold off its effects.”</p>

	<p>“Is there no other way?” Han Sen asked with depression.</p>

	<p>“Well, I can’t say with certainty that there isn’t some way to be rid of its influence. If there was an elite
		that could use force to suppress the power of the race weapon and erase the Fox genes within it, perhaps your
		genes could be placed in the weapon instead. You could probably get rid of the gene weapon’s side effects that
		way. It is like the Foxes’ Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. A scary Fox elite erased the original genes inside the
		mirror and replaced them with his own. That way, it became a race weapon of the Fox.”</p>

	<p>Yisha paused and said, “But the genes of the Foxes are very good. I have heard that when they lit up their gene
		lantern, their ranking was quite high. This purple copper jian’s power might indeed be true god class. Unless
		you can find a true god class elite that is willing to spend some energy wanting to help you, there is no other
		way.”</p>

	<p>“Does that mean I’m done for?” Han Sen looked as if he was going to cry. He didn’t have a true god deified to
		help him. He didn’t know of any to begin with.</p>

	<p>Even if he did, there was no reason for someone else to expend so much effort erasing the Fox genes inside the
		purple copper jian on his behalf.</p>

	<p>“You look quite good the way you are,” Yisha said. Then, she continued flying.</p>

	<p>It took a while for Han Sen to wake up from his disheartened daze.</p>

	<p>Han Sen equipped Glasses to hide his face, then used the item to inspect Yisha’s genes.</p>

	<p>The numbers on the display kept cycling. It took a while for her details to be produced. The Rebate wasn’t a very
		rich race, but Yisha’s gene potential was at eight stars.</p>

	<p>“If the potential is eight stars, then that means she can become a butterfly. If she wants to become a true god,
		a grand opportunity will need to come her way and offer her a boost. It is a shame my Blood-Pulse Sutra is only
		King class right now. I can’t boost the genes of a deified. If I could, I’d definitely help Yisha perfect her
		genes. That way, she would have a greater chance of becoming a true god,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

	<p>Before, Han Sen had tried to use the power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra on the little red bird, but it didn’t work.
		His King class Blood-Pulse Sutra was unable to push the self-cogwheel of a deified being.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at the white tiger. He noticed that its potential was the same as the small Crocodile God. It was
		nine stars.</p>

	<p>Han Sen asked Yisha to look at Ning Yue’s little green sword. She was unable to determine what sort of weapon it
		was, but judging from what had happened to him, it was likely a race weapon. Which race exactly? She didn’t
		know.</p>

	<p>The white whale had almost fully recovered. Han Sen invited Yisha to ride inside the white whale, and it was an
		offer she didn’t refuse. The group rode inside the white whale for the remainder of their journey to Sky Palace.
	</p>

	<p>They didn’t see elites from any other races as they traveled through the systems of chaos. They often encountered
		space xenogeneics, though. And luckily, Yisha was there to help them in such engagements. With Han Sen and the
		little red bird’s deified powers, they were in no danger.</p>

	<p>That white tiger slept inside the ship day and night. It didn’t lend them any power or look as if it was willing
		to lift a finger to help out.</p>

	<p>The white whale was flying forward as it usually did when suddenly, a group of ships appeared. The sight made Han
		Sen and the others feel a chill.</p>

	<p>“Spring Rain,” Han Sen said when he recognized the symbols on the battleships. It was Spring Rain, the group of
		agents that Miss Mirror commanded.</p>

	<p>Of course, when those battleships surrounded the white whale, a man and a woman came out of the lead ship. The
		woman was Miss Mirror. The man was the Fourth Uncle, Meng Lie.</p>

	<p>“We just exited the Black Hole Spider not too long ago. Why are they already here?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, do you want to come with us peacefully? Or are we going to have to drag you back?” Meng Lie asked with
		a laugh.</p>

	<p>Han Sen remained silent. Although they had three deifieds in their midst for combat, they were each of the lowest
		class. They were primitive deifieds. Miss Mirror was a primitive deified, but she had been deified for longer.
		Her powers were weird, and she would be hard to deal with.</p>

	<p>Meng Lie could certainly be a transmutation deified. Even Lando, who became deified, had been unable to defeat
		him. Fighting him would be harder than dealing with Miss Mirror.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen had no choice now. He put on his peacock king soul robe, equipped his Six Core Snake Bow, and exited
		alongside the little red bird.</p>

	<p>Yisha came out, as well. She quietly stood next to Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Miss Mirror looked at Yisha and said, “Knife Queen, the Rebate have always sided with the Extreme King. You
		aren’t going to destroy our longstanding relationship merely for Han Sen, are you?”</p>

	<p>“The Rebate already has an alliance with Sky Palace,” Yisha said flatly. “I’m willing to be friendly with the
		Extreme King, but if you people keep trying to get in my way, then I have no other choice.”</p>

	<p>When Han Sen first went on the run, Yisha was slow to act because she was dealing with the politics of the
		Rebate. She couldn’t get the whole of the Rebate involved simply to save Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Now, though, the Rebate had entered an alliance with Sky Palace. They had the protection of Sky Palace. It would
		be troublesome for the Extreme King to dare touch them.</p>

	<p>“Knife Queen, you need to rethink this. Is all of this worth it? Is it worth betraying us on behalf of your
		student? You know how traitors to the Extreme King are dealt with.” Meng Lie frowned.</p>

	<p>“If I cannot protect my student, then what use is there for the Rebate to even exist?” Yisha growled.</p>

	<p>“I would like to see what benefits Sky Palace offered that have given you the courage to flat-out deny the will
		of the Extreme King.” Miss Mirror’s face was hard as she raised her hand and moved to attack Yisha.</p>

	<p>Yisha didn’t move, but she pulled out her short Teeth Knife to attack Miss Mirror.</p>

	<p>Meng Lie sighed. His body turned to gold, and then, he pressed his hands down on the lion mount he rode upon. The
		gold color dyed the lion.</p>

	<p>The next second, Meng Lie waved his hand. The golden lion rose, turning into a golden knife that resembled the
		head of a lion.</p>

	<p>“I didn’t want to kill you, but you just won’t stay put.” Meng Lie lifted the knife that looked like the head of
		a lion and approached Han Sen. Each step he took was like he was crushing the whole world. It felt like the
		whole galaxy had become smaller in his presence.</p>

	<p>Meng Lie was coming like a golden god. The little red bird shrieked at him as a phoenix fire blazed across it. It
		became a beautiful fire burning next to Han Sen, and it unleashed a scary sea of flames.</p>
