<p>“Where is that cocky red cloud?” Han Sen brought Bao’er to the
peak and waited there for three hours, but he had yet to see it.
Bao’er was playing with a cloud beast that resembled a fat pig.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a red mist appeared from the sea of clouds and headed
their way. Before the red cloud reached the peak, it saw Han Sen.
It recognized him, too. It flew around in the sky, with contrails
spelling out words.</p>
<p>Idiot, you are back.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eye twitched. He cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra and
summoned both pairs of dragon wings. He flapped them and flew off
towards the red cloud.</p>
<p>The red cloud moved quickly, and before Han Sen could swing his
Ghost Teeth Knife, the red cloud was already gone. It didn’t fly
far, though. It flew like a bee, and it spelled words in its
wake.</p>
<p>Idiot, come and get me.</p>
<p>Han Sen flapped his wings and chased the red cloud. Just when he
caught up, the red cloud could speed up and reestablish a
distance.</p>
<p>The red cloud became a fist that flipped Han Sen the bird.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not angered by this, though. He actually smiled at
it. And then, the red cloud appeared to feel something. Suddenly,
it was truly trying to flee.</p>
<p>Its red mist surged, but it didn’t move. Instead, it began
falling slowly out of the sky.</p>
<p>Bao’er was on the peak, holding up a gold gourd toward the red
cloud. An invisible vortex of great power was pulling the cloud
down towards it.</p>
<p>The red cloud kept firing red mist like a rocket, but no matter
how much power it used, it was still drifting toward Bao’er’s
gourd. The creature could not escape the slipstream taking it
in.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. A normal Marquise would struggle and resist
a little before getting absorbed, but that thing was playing
tug-of-war with the gourd. It would drift closer and closer to the
gourd for some time, but then it would unleash a burst of speed and
escape it a bit.</p>
<p>This guy is really different.” Han Sen really liked it.</p>
<p>The red cloud could not attack, but its speed would make for an
exceptional mount.</p>
<p>The red cloud fought this power for ten minutes, but it was
eventually sucked into the gourd. Bao’er felt relieved, and she
wiped the sweat from her brow. Even she had used up quite a bit of
power.</p>
<p>Han Sen expected the gourd to be up to the task, though. The
xenogeneic genes he had brought back to the sanctuary were
Marquise, and Bao’er had eaten a lot of them. He had not collected
higher xenogeneic genes, though. So, the highest Bao’er could have
become was a Marquise, anyway.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, don’t digest it. Save it for your Dad, who wants it as
a mount,” Han Sen said to Bao’er.</p>
<p>“I understand.” Bao’er nodded, then she patted the top of the
gourd. After that, a red cloud came out of it.</p>
<p>“Will you obey me?” Han Sen asked the red cloud.</p>
<p>The red cloud didn’t want to, as it quickly tried to escape. But
the gourd was prepared, and a powerful force of suction dragged it
right back into the gourd.</p>
<p>Within a second flat, the cloud was back inside the gourd.</p>
<p>After doing this a few times, the red cloud looked exhausted.
When it was released the last time, it simply laid down and did not
move.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up Bao’er, jumped atop the red cloud, and shouted
at it. “Move! Take us for a tour around Rainbow Cloud Peak.”</p>
<p>The red cloud submitted to its fate and took Han Sen and Bao’er
for a journey through the sky. Han Sen thought the red cloud had
been tamed, but when they were mid-flight, the beast took another
shot at escaping.</p>
<p>But again, Bao’er was able to pat the gourd and suck the beast
back in.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that the red cloud was a very wild thing. He didn’t
let Bao’er release it anymore. He was planning to keep it locked up
for a while until its wildness subsided somewhat.</p>
<p>With the red cloud secured, though, Han Sen went back to Jade
Island with Bao’er all merrily.</p>
<p>Wherever they went, the Sky Palace students said hello. Bao’er
was even more popular than Han Sen, and she definitely had to be
the most popular person in all of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Wherever she went, she was given gifts by students and elders
alike. The women really wanted to take her.</p>
<p>Due to Dream Beast now protecting Bao’er, though, the elders of
Sky Palace—and the leader—made no attempt to steal Bao’er for
themselves. Instead, they just moped about Bao’er not being their
student as they wanted her to be.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know why Dream Beast wished to help Bao’er, but
Han Sen noticed that Bao’er was very friendly to creatures such as
it.</p>
<p>In the past, Bao’er had used her bottle to feed the Red Pony.
That was how they realized it was a super creature called
Nightmare. After it went to the Alliance, it stayed in Han Sen’s
house with Bao’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen practiced geno arts every day. He absorbed Jade Fairy
Spirits in the second tower of the White Jade Building when he
could, and his Jadeskin leveled up quickly. So, too, did his
Dongxuan Sutra. It was only The Story of Genes that had somewhat
stalled. There weren’t any changes.</p>
<p>“It seems as if The Story of Genes still requires many resources
to level up.” Han Sen thought regretfully. He had to level up
Jadeskin first, though, and use Jade Spirits on his The Story of
Genes.</p>
<p>Every time Han Sen went to the White Jade Building, he’d absorb
Jade Fairy Spirits. After a while, he realized Jadeskin was
developing a strange sort of power.</p>
<p>“I wonder, if Jadeskin reaches Marquise, will I be able to wield
cold powers?” Han Sen hoped to get Jadeskin’s cold powers. He’d
have especially like to wield ice. That would come in very useful
for him.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, how are you?” Yu Jing rode his green dragon to
Jade Island. He had been doing well for himself, and he looked even
richer these days.</p>
<p>“Not bad. It looks like you’re doing great, too.” Han Sen looked
at Yu Jing while he spoke.</p>
<p>Yu Jing smiled and said, “I earned some more money, but now I
have an even bigger money-making opportunity ahead. Would you like
to help me with it?”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“In one year, it will be the day that the geno being scroll
appears. Are you planning to compete?” Yu Jing looked at Han Sen
with excitement.</p>
