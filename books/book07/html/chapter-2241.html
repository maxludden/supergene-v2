<h2>Leveling Up to Duke</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2241</h3>

<p>Ice Blue Knight King reached his hand out and pulled Han Sen’s
frozen form through the sky toward him.</p>
<p>Seeing that Han Sen was about to get sucked into Ice Blue Knight
King’s hands, the previously-frozen Bao’er suddenly moved. She
pounded the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum repeatedly.</p>
<p>A shockwave shot out to batter Ice Blue Knight King’s head. They
were at extremely close range, and Ice Blue Knight King had relaxed
his defenses. The Knight King’s face didn’t change, though. His
body flashed blue and deflected the sonic forces that came against
him.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw the acoustic force of the Blood Scorpion Jade
Drum fail to make a dent, he immediately flapped his wings to get
the hell out of there. He cast Jadeskin first, then made use of
Break Space Flash.</p>
<p>Other powers might have been able to trap Han Sen, but luckily,
the Knight King had attempted to trap him with cold. A power like
that didn’t stand a chance of holding Han Sen against his will.</p>
<p>He had spent a long time practicing Jadeskin near that jade
toad. Even deified cold powers couldn’t harm Han Sen in the least.
Ice Blue Knight King had a fierce cold power, but he wasn’t in the
same league as the jade toad. He was unable to trap Han Sen in that
wintery grip.</p>
<p>Han Sen had planned to slip away from the Knight King after
Bao’er dazed him, but he hadn’t expected the sonic forces to fail
when employed at such a close distance.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King looked very surprised that a Marquise was
able to block his Ice Blue powers, though. That was completely
unexpected.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept teleporting, but Break Space Flash came from the
dragon wing gene. He didn’t have the ability himself, so there were
limits to his use of the skill. He would show up somewhere and then
teleport away again. Even so, he was incredibly fast. Ordinary
Dukes couldn’t keep up with Han Sen if they were moving at full
speed, that much was certain. But against someone like Ice Blue
Knight King, that speed wasn’t enough to maintain a lead.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King smiled. “You truly are Knife’s student. You
can escape my Ice Blue power. In that case, try to repel my Deep
Blue Abyss.”</p>
<p>After that, Ice Blue Knight King moved. The Ice Blue colors
suddenly deepened to a navy blue. It was like a demon that could
swallow the earth was now coming for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept teleporting around, but he still couldn’t escape
that rapidly approaching navy blue color. As he rose high into the
air, the power condensed into a navy blue crystal around him.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King moved slowly toward the frozen Han Sen.
“For Knife’s sake, I won’t kill you. But you will have to hand the
item over. If you give it back, then I will pretend nothing
happened. And the reward you are owed will still be yours to
claim.”</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King moved close enough to touch the blue
crystal. Just as he reached out his hand, however, his face
warped.</p>
<p>A jade power was spreading inside that blue crystal, and the
crystal itself was starting to crack.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King was shocked. His blue powers weren’t just
cold powers; they also had sealing effects. But it looked like even
those powers couldn’t trap Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was running Jadeskin at full strength. His
Jadeskin had been on the verge of becoming Duke, and under the
pressure of the Deep Blue power, it finally achieved the
breakthrough it needed.</p>
<p>Jadeskin power spread all across Han Sen’s body. His flesh had
been red because of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, but it suddenly changed
to look like ocean ice. Han Sen’s entire body seemed like it had
been made from crystal.</p>
<p>It was so pure and elegant; he didn’t look human at all.</p>
<p>The angelic power he received from Little Angel had imbued Han
Sen with a pure energy. It changed along with Han Sen’s
breakthrough and was transferred into Jadeskin energy. It pushed
Han Sen’s body to become Duke.</p>
<p>Marquises could develop skills for the element they were
associated with. When they became Dukes, those skills would change.
Dukes combined more completely with their element, which allowed
them to use it more fully.</p>
<p>That pure element touched the edge of the rule. It wasn’t quite
like the power of a King, which could be used to directly affect an
enemy without the activation of a skill. It did, however, provide a
nice power increase.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what element Jadeskin belonged to. It might
have possessed some icy powers, but it wasn’t completely
ice-bound.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Defying the sealing powers placed on him, Han Sen moved. The
blue crystal that had trapped him cracked. Han Sen flapped his
wings and teleported again. This time, he did so much faster.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King was stunned. He waved his hand and sent
more of that Deep Blue power after Han Sen. The Knight King tried
to drown Han Sen with it as he attempted to flee.</p>
<p>The next second, Han Sen was rushing out of the blue. He
shrugged off the sealing powers without difficulty.</p>
<p>“Ice Blue Knight King’s Deep Blue power was unable to seal him.
It looks like his elemental associations are strong, and he has a
high resistance to sealing powers.” Edward’s gaze was disturbingly
intense.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was trapped by the Deep Blue power, Edward had
planned to help Han Sen escape.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had managed to get out by himself before Edward
could take action. Han Sen had broken Ice Blue Knight King’s Deep
Blue power using his own strength.</p>
<p>“Ice Blue Knight King has struck twice now, and still, he hasn’t
been able to stop Han Sen. No wonder Night River King failed to
kill this maniac. You are right. He is a scary guy!” The Ice Blue
Knight seemed unsettled.</p>
<p>The Knight King continued his attack, but Han Sen kept sliding
out from under that Deep Blue Abyss. The Deep Blue powers couldn’t
stop him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his body had been crystallized. He couldn’t
release any energy, but the powers launched against him couldn’t
penetrate his body, either.</p>
<p>It felt very weird, and it reminded him of a time before he
started practicing geno arts. He could only use his own physical
strength, and he was unable to unleash energy.</p>
<p>But his body was stronger than ever; that much was certain. It
gave him the illusion that he could break everything in front of
him with his raw strength.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King, watching Han Sen slide effortlessly out
from under the Deep Blue Abyss, felt powerless and frustrated. He
moved forward to catch up with Han Sen, gathering a frightening
power as he went.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just an icy sealing power. This one possessed great
destructive strength. Ice Blue Knight King looked serious, and Han
Sen could see in his eyes that he had given up on the prospect of
simply sealing him.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King’s power came slashing down on Han Sen, but
a ghostly shield suddenly appeared to block his attack.</p>
<p>It was Han Sen’s only undamaged Demon Bug King Bai Sema: the one
he had taken from Han Yan.</p>
