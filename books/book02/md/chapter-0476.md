  After seeing those green crystals, Ji Yanran started to whisper.

"There are nest crystals here! How can we possibly walk over there?" Ji Yanran asked Li Mingtang.

"That is why we need to work together," Li Mingtang said.

Han Sen did not know what the green crystals were for, so he did not speak but listened. After a while, he finally understood why Li Mingtang and Wang Hou failed to go through.

The green crystals that looked like chandeliers were named nest crystals, nurturing lots of mini crystals inside of them. The nest crystals were very sensitive to air circulation. Once air circulated around them, the mini crystals inside would jet out like hail.

However, those mini crystals were a thousand times scarier than hail. Full of spikes, they would start to absorb blood once they touched human skin.

Even with Super Diamond Body, Li Mingtang could not block the mini crystals, so it was definitely not easy to go through.

Using flying beast souls to fly across would definitely trigger the nest crystals. The only possible way was to walk slowly over the crystal bridge to reduce the air circulation, so that the nests would not be triggered.

The trouble was that even though they could walk on the bridge, that would still generate movements and air circulation, which would still trigger nests.

If the nest crystals were triggered, the three persons must work together to avoid being touched by the mini crystals.

Li Mingtang told Ji Yanran and Han Sen how to cope with the mini crystals, and the three of them slowly walked onto the crystal bridge with some distance apart.

None of them dared to go too fast. They moved on the bridge like slow motion for fear that they might alert the nest crystals.

Initially, Li Mingtang thought that it was basically impossible to walk through without triggering the crystals. However, the three of them passed the bridge slowly. The nest crystals hanging above were not triggered at all.

"Strange." Even Li Mingtang frowned, not knowing why the nest crystals were so calm.

Last time when Li Mingtang came to this place with Wang Hou, they triggered a nest crystal without walking far. In the end, the two of them had to run for their lives separately. Even so, Li Mingtang still got injured.

"It is the best if we could refrain from triggering them. Let's go inside." Li Mingtang said and walked into the castle.

Ji Yanran and Han Sen followed up, maintaining some distance from Li Mingtang. Previously, Li Mingtang needed them to go over the bridge. However, now that the nest crystals were not triggered, Li Mingtang might not need them anymore.

Han Sen vigilantly followed Li Mingtang into the castle. The gate was already open. After they entered the causal, they became dumbstruck.

In the huge causal lay many corpses in a messy way. All the corpses looked alive without any hint of drying up. They almost looked like living persons.

However, taking a closer look at them, the three could easily tell that they were dead.

When seeing those dead people, Li Mingtang suddenly became excited. Quickly glancing at the dead bodies, his eyes fell on the body of a middle-aged man and he became thrilled.

Although Li Mingtang was overjoyed, he did not dare to go over, observing vigilantly.

Those people would not die here for no reason. There were no injuries on any of their bodies. Standing or sitting, they simply died, without any traces of fighting or struggling.

However, Li Mingtang still did not understand how those people died and why their bodies looked exactly like how they were when alive, without any signs of corruption, which was why he did not dare to go over.

Han Sen and Ji Yanran were even less tempted to go up. When they were about to ask Li Mingtang the expert, they suddenly saw someone coming out from a structure inside the castle.

With a closer look, Li Mingtang saw it was Wang Hou and suddenly changed his looks. He asked Wang Hou, "When did you come? Did you find anything?"

Wang Hou smiled, reached out his hand and showed Li Mingtang a red crystal the size of a pigeon egg. "After separating with you, I walked around before I came over, and I have also found the thing."

"Fantastic, give me the thing, quickly." Seeing the red crystal, Li Mingtang looked overjoyed and watched the red crystal zealously.

"Okay." Wang Hou walked to Li Mingtang slowly, quickly handing the crystal to Li Mingtang.

Li Mingtang was so excited that he reached out to grab the crystal. Unexpectedly, Wang Hou flipped his hand and grabbed the crystal, punching Li Mingtang in the chest with his other hand.

Li Mingtang was prepared as well. The moment when the made the move, Li Mingtang's body turned into gold. When Wang Hou hit his chest, the sound was metal hitting metal.

"Wang Hou, you should know that you could never hurt my Super Diamond Body," Li Mingtang exclaimed coldly.

"Is that right?" Wang Hou snorted and suddenly threw a grenade.

However, Wang Hou did not throw the grenade at Li Mingtang or the couple, but outside the castle.

Hearing the strong explosion and airflow, Han Sen suddenly became pale. The nests on the ceiling almost exploded at the exact same time. All the green mini crystals hidden inside fell out like a dust storm.

Very soon, the mini crystals came to them like locusts, not giving them any time to react.

"Rot in hell." Wang Hou regarded the three of them coldly, while the mini crystals bypassed his body as if he was not a target at all. Li Mingtang was shocked, but it was too late to run. All the green mini crystals stuck to his body, from which even his Super Diamond Body could not defend him. Waving his hands like crazy, he did not manage to break many before he was covered in green mini crystals like a beekeeper covered in bees.

After sticking to his body, the green mini crystals quickly turned into a red color. Obviously, they sucked out a large amount of blood from Li Mingtang's body.

Li Mingtang issued a shrill scream, hitting the mini crystals on his own body like crazy, but to no avail. More and more mini crystals started to stick to him.

Han Sen and Ji Yanran were both pale, thinking that it was probably the end of their lives. Since even Li Mingtang's Super Diamond Body was not effective, it was less likely for them to survive.

However, after the mini crystals came over, they also bypassed the couple and did not touch them at all, which made them both surprised and happy.

"What?" Seeing the situation, Wang Hou regarded the couple, surprised.

"All right then. Let me send you to hell myself." Wang Hou summoned his golden beast soul sword and walked directly to Han Sen.
