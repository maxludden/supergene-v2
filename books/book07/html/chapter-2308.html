<p>Han Sen and Bai Wei spent a few hours waiting atop the golden king dragon. The king dragon still hadn’t gone underground when a few men approached them. That made Bai Wei feel rather nervous.</p>

<p>Because Han Sen’s eyes were better than Bai Wei’s, he knew exactly who was coming. The sight made him frown.</p>

<p>The leader of the group was none other than Prince Fourteen Bai Canglang. The people following him had to be his Royal Guards. There were four of them: two of the Lane race, one Ghana, and one female of the Extreme King.</p>

<p>The four guards had an intimidating aura. They had to be at least King class, and on top of that, the female Extreme King was familiar to Han Sen. When Han Sen looked closer, however, he realized that he didn’t actually know her.</p>

<p>“Brother Fourteen!” When Bai Wei saw Bai Canglang, her face paled. She was too weak to compete with Bai Canglang, and she knew it.</p>

<p>Bai Wei walked up to him and bowed. “Greetings, Brother Fourteen.”</p>

<p>Bai Canglang looked at Bai Wei. He waved his hand. “Since you now have access to the King’s Garden, you are nothing but a competitor to me. There is no need for you to remain so polite.”</p>

<p>After that, Bai Canglang glanced over her shoulder, his eyes barely flicking to Han Sen before returning to Bai Wei. He coldly said, “But you are my little sister. As a big brother, I shouldn’t be the one to bully you. Choose one of these four knights. If you can withstand one of their blows, you can keep this primary root king dragon.”</p>

<p>“Brother Fourteen, you must be kidding. If you want it, just take it. We can go and find another king dragon.” Bai Wei bowed and readied herself to depart.</p>

<p>Bai Canglang stepped over and grabbed Bai Wei by the arm. He smiled, showing his teeth. “Sister Wei, don’t think so little of yourself. You are in the King’s Garden! You cannot avoid a little healthy competition. You should get used to it, sooner rather than later. But don’t worry, Brother Fourteen won’t steal your king dragon. I just want you to understand how you are expected to survive here in the King’s Garden.”</p>

<p>Bai Wei forced a smile. “Thank you, Brother Fourteen. I don’t dare to overstep my bounds, though. I don’t want to fight with anyone, and I would much prefer a stable existence here.”</p>

<p>“It is fine. Win or lose, you can have this primary root king dragon.” Bai Canglang was still holding onto her arm as he spoke to her.</p>

<p>A primary root king dragon was nothing to a prince like Bai Canglang. If he did not take this one, it would be easy for him to find another.</p>

<p>Bai Canglang was forcing Bai Wei into this position because of Han Sen. He wanted Han Sen to know that following Bai Wei was a big mistake.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw that Bai Canglang had grabbed Bai Wei’s arm and was keeping her there. So, he walked over smoothly and bowed to Bai Wei.</p>

<p>“If you insist, Prince Fourteen, then I am willing to do this for my queen.”</p>

<p>Bai Wei was about to say something, but Bai Canglang had started speaking already. “Ah, you are Knife Queen’s student indeed! So brave. I greatly admire brave individuals like you. Please pick one of the four guards next to me. Whether you withstand the attack or not, you will still keep this king dragon.”</p>

<p>After that, Bai Canglang turned to the four guards in his company. “Han Sen is Knife Queen’s student. I am good friends with Knife Queen. You guys cannot hurt her student too much, so please don’t go overkill with your powers. Okay?”</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the four guards and hesitated. He went to the Extreme King female guard and said, “If you please.”</p>

<p>“Red Sleeve, do not hurt him,” Bai Canglang said firmly to the female guard.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the female guard answered. She walked in front of Canglang to stand directly before Han Sen.</p>

<p>“I am Han Sen. What is your name?” Han Sen greeted the female guard.</p>

<p>It didn’t really matter which guard he selected. Every single one there was a higher level than him.</p>

<p>He had selected her simply because he thought she seemed familiar. He just couldn’t remember where he might have seen her before. By doing this, he hoped to jog his memory and confirm his sense of familiarity.</p>

<p>“Red Sleeve,” the female guard answered shortly. She raised her fist and said, “If you can take my punch without falling, then you win.”</p>

<p>After that, the fist started to glow with light. The light was like a moon, and wherever the moon shone, the fabric of space twisted.</p>

<p>Han Sen shifted his body a little. He felt as if the area around him was being stretched. After he moved his body, he was still where he had been.</p>

<p>“Space powers?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>

<p>Red Sleeve’s fist hurtled toward him. It was like a moon falling. Han Sen moved, but her powers seemed to be locking him in place. And that moon was coming closer.</p>

<p>Han Sen squinted and looked at that coming moon. If he couldn’t dodge, then he wasn’t going to dodge. He lifted a fist and punched towards the moon.</p>

<p>Bai Wei looked ill. Red Sleeve was a King class elite. She might have even been half deified. Han Sen, on the other hand, had only just become a Duke. No matter how strong he was, there was no way he could fight Red Sleeve in such a manner.</p>

<p>Bai Wei knew exactly what Bai Canglang was up to with all these theatrics. If Han Sen took this punch, he would be seriously injured, if not killed outright.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>At that moment, Red Sleeve’s fist came into contact with Han Sen’s own fist. The moon shattered like glass, and the space nearby also broke, cracks running through reality around Han Sen’s body.</p>

<p>Bai Wei was stunned. She had been sure that Red Sleeve wouldn’t dare kill anyone inside King’s Garden, but the woman had exerted her power with the obvious intent to kill. Han Sen’s body had been annihilated by space power. Unless Han Sen had a very strong revival power, he wouldn’t even have a chance to recover over time; living was no longer possible.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s body was ripped open. His form then exploded like water, scattering everywhere.</p>

<p>But then, another image of Han Sen became visible in exactly the same place that he had previously stood. He was in perfect condition, and he was just standing there. The Han Sen that the moon had wrecked was just a doppelganger built using the Moon technique.</p>

<p>“I am useless. Please punish me, my prince!” Red Sleeve looked horrified. She bowed before Bai Canglang to apologize.</p>

<p>“Han Sen’s doppelganger technique is amazing. It even fooled me. In that case, I couldn’t expect you to have seen through it.” Bai Canglang waved his hand and gestured for her to fall back. He smiled to Han Sen. “You are better than your teacher. It is no wonder that you are Knife Queen’s student. I am so close with your teacher. If you have time, you should come and visit me.”</p>

<p>After that, Bai Canglang told Bai Wei, “Sister Wei, I am so happy that you managed to enlist such a good guard. You can have this primary root king dragon. I am going to look for another. I will see you later.”</p>

<p>After Bai Canglang left, Bai Wei spoke to Han Sen. “That was way too risky. You almost died.”</p>

<p>“I am fine, though, aren’t I?” Han Sen laughed. As he turned his gaze back to Bai Canglang, an expression of deep thought crossed his face.</p>
