<p>&#8220;How did they beat you?&#8221; Han Sen was holding in the urge to ask, but he buckled. He knew he was now getting closer to the truth behind what happened to the seventh team. This god could certainly be the one encountered by the seventh team.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I will expose my weaknesses to you?&#8221; God asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at it strangely. Although it was possessing Wan&#8217;er, this god gave Han Sen the feeling that it was the nice and next-door neighbor kind. It did not have that superior presence like Jun King and the other god spirits gave off. It did not really try to present himself as an invincible deity either. If Han Sen had not known it was a god, he would never have imagined it was the sort of being to play with the fates of others.</p>

<p>Thinking about the elite humans of the seventh team and the bad things that happened to them, Han Sen knew that their appearance and presence could not be trusted. This being that called itself God might have looked kind, but appearances were deceptive. On the inside, it was a wretched demon.</p>

<p>While they were talking, Very High Leader, who was sitting beneath the tree stood up. He looked up at one of the Star Tree&#8217;s fruits.</p>

<p>The star fruits were very difficult to grow naturally, ripen, and fall to the ground. It was a process that took forever. Even people who guarded the Star Tree did not have that sort of patience.</p>

<p>There was now a fruit that had matured naturally. The young Very High Leader stared at the matured fruit with a face that dripping with seriousness.</p>

<p>The star fruit that had matured naturally possessed a deified xenogeneic. It was not going to be a primitive or transmutation either. It wasn&#8217;t that low level. It would be at least larva or butterfly class.</p>

<p>Very High Leader was very young. He had only just become primitive, but he was already considered a genius amongst the Very High. Such praise did not come easy. Even so, when it came to battling, he was primitive. A primitive going up against a larva or butterfly class fiend was far too much.</p>

<p>He did not plan on backing down from the prospect of such a fight, nor did he summon the aid of others of the Very High. He silently watched the star fruit with eyes brimming with confidence and pride.</p>

<p>The star fruit had some scary light. It was like a sun that was burning at max capacity. When time passed, the star fruit&#8217;s light became weaker. It changed from white to yellow, yellow to red, red to dark red, and dark red to black. It ended up looking like charcoal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I have come here to predict this Very High Leader&#8217;s actions and see if he can kill the xenogeneic,&#8221; God said.</p>

<p>When he heard that, Han Sen frowned. That question was not difficult to answer. The star fruit unleashed a very scary presence. It was stronger than Han Sen was now.</p>

<p>Very High Leader was just a primitive deified. His power was not enough to fight against the xenogeneic that existed inside such fruit. Also, there were no other Very High there. It would have been impossible for him to slay such a xenogeneic.</p>

<p>With Han Sen&#8217;s experience guarding the star tree, he was able to predict that the xenogeneic would escape capture and leave Outer Sky. It was bound to flee into the mountains nearby. Very High Leader would not be able to stop it.</p>

<p>Such an obvious result was impossible for the god to not know already. It had picked the time of this incident with purpose, so it was hard to gauge whether or not it was already prepared for this.</p>

<p>Are there any more changes, in between this? Did Very High Leader manage to kill that xenogeneic inside the fruit? Han Sen thought to himself. He then thought, &quot;No. God can&#8217;t be deliberately tricking me to have me think this is a trick. In fact, I believe the xenogeneic escaped into the mountains without issue.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked. He realized he had made a big mistake. Gambling with people who were professional when it came to tricks of the mind was the worst thing possible. He might have merrily walked right into his opponent&#8217;s scheme.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew he was an elite when it came to this stuff, so he immediately forced himself to calm down and sort through the information he had at hand. With what he knew thus far, that was how he was going to make his judgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very High Leader will not kill the xenogeneic.&#8221; Han Sen made his decision. It was because it was the most likely thing to happen. Han Sen had to choose the option that adhered to Occam&#8217;s razor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine. I will select the option that states Very High Leader succeeds and slays the xenogeneic.&#8221; God laughed coldly. Nothing special was visible on its face, so Han Sen could not tell if he was right or wrong.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The fruit that had turned completely black exploded. It turned into dust and rose. The xenogeneic appeared from behind.</p>

<p>There was a semi-transparent set of butterfly wings that opened beautifully like flowers. Behind the butterfly wings, a lady with jade skin used her hands and shoulders to hide her body&#8217;s important parts. She looked shy.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not think that the thing that came out of the star fruit would be a xenogeneic like that. He thought, Such a beautiful xenogeneic. I do not think men could be cruel enough to harm something like that. Plus, his power is worse than the xenogeneic. He won&#8217;t be able to kill it.</p>

<p>Just as Han Sen thought that the young Very High Leader was in shock when he saw that beautiful xenogeneic. His ice-cold face melted a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister is a genius of the Very High. Butterfly Lady has been in the fruit admiring you for the longest time. If Mister would not mind, Butterfly Lady would like to follow Mister&#8230;&#8221; The most surprising thing happened. The xenogeneic was extremely intelligent, and she was butterfly class. On top of that, she was willing to follow Very High Leader, who was only primitive class at the time. That was a very rare thing to happen.</p>

<p>It looks like Very High Leader is not going to kill her. Han Sen looked at the scene. He could see God still smiling. It was like everything was none of its business. That made Han Sen feel a little surreal.</p>

<p>Things went so smoothly as everything unfolded. It was going too well for Han Sen.</p>

<p>The Very High Leader was now just a young man. He did not have the mind of a Very High Forget Love practitioner either. After meeting the beautiful and elegant butterfly lady, he suddenly had a weird feeling.</p>

<p>The relationship between the two developed quickly. A few days later, they were already kissing each other together like a couple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I think you lose.&#8221; Han Sen had been aware of God. He was not going to let it destroy the relationship between Very High Leader and the butterfly lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, if Very High Leader hasn&#8217;t killed the butterfly lady by tomorrow, then I lose,&#8221; God said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK.&#8221; Han Sen agreed, but he thought, They are so in love now. One day later, there is no way they could become enemies and try to kill each other. Plus, even if they did turn against each other, the butterfly lady is much stronger than Very High Leader. It would probably end up with the butterfly lady killing Very High Leader.</p>

<p>To prevent the god from doing some tricks, Han Sen stared at him. He was not going to let him disturb Very High Leader and the butterfly lady.</p>

<p>That night, Very High Leader and butterfly lady could not help but eat the forbidden fruit.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt relieved and he asked, &#8220;Now that it has happened, Very High Leader will not want to kill the butterfly lady, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen watched God. It was sitting on the branch of a tree holding its jaw as it looked at Very High Leader and butterfly lady being together. It looked like it was happy for them. God said, &#8220;It is a relationship that makes people jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think this relationship is very nice, does that mean we should not disturb them? How about the bet ends here?&#8221; Although things were drifting in Han Sen&#8217;s favor, he did not think God would lose and concede so easily. It was only a matter of time before God did something.</p>

<p>God&#8217;s eyes looked a bit weird as it said, &#8220;No. This is just the beginning of our bet&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>After that, God&#8217;s body flashed. It jumped off the tree and stood in front of Very High Leader and butterfly lady.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew that God was going to strike, so he quickly flashed in front of God. It did not matter what God was planning to do, but he knew he had to stop it. He did not know what God could possibly do to make Very High Leader kill the butterfly lady.</p>
