<p>Han Sen sighed as he tried to think of which skill he might need
in order to defeat Lone Bamboo. Han Sen had mastered many
techniques, but when compared to Lone Bamboo, he only excelled in a
meager few.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo could spend a lifetime learning proficiency with a
skill in the space of one dream. Han Sen, however, was just a
human. A life was only a few decades long. He wasn’t even a hundred
years old, and so he couldn’t compete with Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>If they were going to continue competing like this, Han Sen
would run out of skills to use. So, he had to end the fight. This
could not go on much longer.</p>
<p>“But how do I stop Lone Bamboo?” Han Sen wondered. But then, the
light of an idea popped up.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved his Ghost Teeth Knife, but it wasn’t headed for
Lone Bamboo. He struck a rock on the ground and cut out a
ten-meter-long, rectangular stone. He placed it on the ground.</p>
<p>People were curious and unsure what he was doing.</p>
<p>Han Sen punched the rock’s side. Then he smiled at Lone Bamboo
and said, “Can you do that?”</p>
<p>Everyone thought this was weird, because when Han Sen punched
the rock, there was no mark left on it at all. They didn’t know
what he meant by this.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo’s hand became a knife, and he slashed the rock and
cut it in half.</p>
<p>And then, people realized that no mark had been left on the side
of the stone Han Sen had punched, but on the inside, there was the
mark of a fist. The stone around that fist-shape had become dust.
It appeared after Lone Bamboo cut the rock open. There was a
fist-shaped hole. It fit Han Sen’s fist.</p>
<p>“Very powerful Yin force. He can punch a ten-meter-long rock and
not break it. With this Yin force, armor would be useless against
him. Any defense would find itself obliterated,” said someone in
the audience, surprised.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo did not speak, and just punched the rock that had
been cut in half. It was still the same, and the rock did not look
damaged.</p>
<p>Han Sen used a knife to cut that rock in half. The side that was
closer to him had a fist mark, even though the location was the
same.</p>
<p>“Good,” Han Sen complimented. He had practiced with Yin Yang
forces. He had spent much effort to become talented with it, but
Lone Bamboo was not much worse.</p>
<p>The students of Sky Palace were so happy. They were
complimenting Lone Bamboo’s punch. Han Sen was the one who posed
the question, so it was obvious he’d be good at it. It was more
surprising that Lone Bamboo was able to do the same.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo said emotionlessly, “When I was in my 731st life, I
was a weak woman. But I was born in a boxing family. I was bullied,
but I was still able to create a Yin force fist skill. It was not
powerful, but it hurt others on the inside. I killed all those who
bullied me, and I became an infamous villain. But then alas, I was
poisoned. It took three long years for my organs to rot, and for me
to finally die.”</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo spoke of this calmly, as if it was nothing. Even so,
people were shocked to hear all this.</p>
<p>Your turn,” Han Sen said quietly. He was saddened to hear about
Lone Bamboo’s dream.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo picked up another piece of rock. He stabbed it into
the ground like a tablet, leaving seven or eight meters of it
sticking out.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Lone Bamboo, unsure what he was going to do.
If they were going to write and compete with their wills, Han Sen
could use Teeth Knife knifemind. He wouldn’t lose.</p>
<p>But Lone Bamboo knew this, and so Han Sen could guess that this
wouldn’t boil down to simple writing.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo looked at the rock, but he didn’t pull out his
sword. He walked back ten meters and said, “My sword will break
through nine tiers. Can yours?”</p>
<p>The students that watched were confused. They didn’t know what
that meant. Furthermore, he only spoke and did not perform
anything.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi was confused, too. Just as she was going to ask Yun
Changkong, there was an explosion. The surface of the rock was
blown up, and there was a crack. And then, there was writing on it.
“I want to break through nine tiers.” The words were carved into
the stone, as if by a weapon. It felt like a mad bull. It felt as
if those words were going to come out of the stone and leap into
the skies.</p>
<p>“Sonic blade is not too rare. It can break rocks one hundred
meters away, but Lone Bamboo can write with it so powerfully. Not
one else who has practiced with sonic powers could do such a thing.
This isn’t a matter of control. It’s just that no one else can make
a sound like that.” A Sky Palace Duke found himself in shock.</p>
<p>“Because Lone Bamboo has experienced a lot, he has collected so
many skills and feelings. Normal people are glad to just have one.
Han Sen has practiced with knives and Yin, which is rare for
someone of his age. There is no way he has sonic powers, as
well.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid Han Sen cannot compete with Lone Bamboo now.”</p>
<p>“There are no others that can equal Lone Bamboo. Even though Han
Sen is strong, to compete with Lone Bamboo like that is
impossible.”</p>
<p>Many students were shocked. Han Sen smiled and asked, “Which
life did you learn this skill in?”</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo’s face did not change, and he calmly said, “It was
in my 3754th life. In it, I was a musician that killed others with
my music. I was trapped in an echoing valley, and eventually killed
by my own musical powers.”</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and did not say anything. He walked to
the other side of the rock, just as Lone Bamboo had done. He
stopped ten meters away and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Can Han Sen do it?” Yun Suyi was worried, and so she grabbed
Yun Sushang’s arm. She knew they could not be romantically
involved, but that did not mean she wished to see Han Sen fail.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang had a wry smile. “How am I supposed to know? But not
many people practice with sonic powers, and especially to the
degree of Lone Bamboo. They are a rare talent, and we haven’t seen
Han Sen use a technique that is in any way similar to it. This is
bad.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi was even more worried now. She wanted to say something,
but before she did, Han Sen was speaking again.</p>
<p>“Sitting in the clouds, lonely and cold,” Han Sen said. He
didn’t think too much about it, but he wanted to comfort Lone
Bamboo. He wanted to understand him.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo had suffered ten thousand nightmares. Although he
had become a genius as a result, Han Sen knew he must have been sad
and lonely. No one knew how difficult it was to be that powerful.
No one could understand the pain.</p>
<p>After Han Sen wrote those words down, the rock shattered like
powder. The seven words appeared, and they hit the onlookers like a
physical weight. People’s hearts sank in their chests.</p>
