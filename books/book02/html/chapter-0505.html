    <p>
      Han Sen glanced at those people. Those people did not have any fishing
      tools or personal belongings, so they did not seem to be fishing here.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Fuck off.&#8221; Han Sen said coldly.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You have quite a temper. But I&#8217;m afraid that you have not
      been told who this place belongs to.&#8221; The leader of the group of
      people, a middle-aged man did not get mad, but smiled coldly at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those people did not take Han Sen&#8217;s words seriously at all. They
      walked to Han Sen sighed and started to pull the bag that Han Sen used to
      place the fish he caught.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear me? Do not make me say it again,&#8221; Han
      Sen frowned and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha ha, boy, you are tough. However, Blackgod Shelter is not the
      right place for you to get tough.&#8221; The middle-aged man reached to
      grab the fish in Han Sen&#8217;s bag. &#8220;Our boss at Blackgod says
      that half of the gains in the frozen lake must be handed to the Blackgod
      Shelter. You have seven fish here, so I will make it cheaper for you, only
      taking three gold anchovies from you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had heard that since the frozen lake was near one of the three
      biggest shelter, Blackgod Shelter, people from Blackgod Shelter would
      charge some fees from people who was fishing there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally speaking, only a primitive fish would be charged, and then the
      person could fish as long as he wanted to.
    </p>

    <p>
      These people asked for three fish from Han Sen, which were the most
      valuable ones. Obviously, they were jealous of Han Sen&#8217;s gains and
      planned to blackmail him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Han Sen planned to give them a fish when encountering people
      from the Blackgod Shelter. After all, it was their place. However, these
      people wanted to blackmail him, which made Han Sen reluctant to give them
      even one fish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the middle-aged man reaching to his back, Han Sen did not speak but
      stepped on his hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strike was fast and fierce, which the middle-aged man could in no way
      dodge. His hand was stepped on by Han Sen, and he suddenly screamed like a
      pig.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dammit. He dared to attack us.&#8221; The rest people saw Han Sen
      making a move and quickly summoned their beast souls, hitting Han Sen
      immediately. It seemed that they were being merciless, aiming at Han
      Sen&#8217;s vital parts. Han Sen&#8217;s eyes became cold. When other
      people tried to kill him, of course he would not be soft. When the weapons
      were about to hit him, he waved his right hand. With the flash of three
      purple lights, all the weapons were cut into pieces, and three persons in
      the front were cut in the chest and died immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other two persons survived luckily because they did not run as fast.
      Full of terror, they turned to run while shouting.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go away now. People of Blackgod Shelter are nearby, and they will
      be here in a minute,&#8221; Guan Tong ran over and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen nodded slightly and said, &#8220;You should go as well. Avoid this
      area for the time being.&#8221; After parting with Guan Tong, Han Sen left
      the frozen lake. He did not want to make things worse between him and
      Blackgod Shelter, so there was no need for him to look for trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, as Han Sen just left the frozen lake, a dozen mounds ran to him
      and approached him shortly. Obviously, they were targeting him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Boss, he is the one who killed of our brothers.&#8221; Among the
      dozen mounts, one was of the middle-aged man who had run away. He pointed
      at Han Sen and yelled.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dozen mounts quickly circled Han Sen. Their leader, a man in black
      mail with eyes like hawk
    </p>

    <p>stared at Han Sen and said coldly, &#8220;You killed my men?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They were trying to kill me, so of course I could not choose to be
      killed,&#8221; Han Sen said, looking at the man in black mail.
    </p>

    <p>
      The men in black mail quickly summoned a beast soul knife that was narrow
      and long. He pointed it to Han Sen and said, &#8220;No matter for what,
      you killed my men at the place of that God shelter, so you deserved to
      die.&#8221; As he said, the men quickly slashed the knife at Han Sen. The
      knife was so fast that it was a black light, coming to Han Sen&#8217;s
      face in a second.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly changed his expression. The strike from the men in
      blackmail was so fast that Han Sen could not completely dodge it with his
      speed. He had to roar and summoned the gargoyle to block the strike with
      his claws.
    </p>

    <p>
      As his claws were about to clash with the long knife of the man in black
      mail, the long knife unexpectedly disappeared. When it appeared again, it
      cut Han Sen&#8217;s chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blood started to come out of Han Sen&#8217;s injury in the chest. Luckily,
      Han Sen stepped back in time and diverted the majority of the force from
      the knife. In addition, the gargoyle glyph also made his skin tougher to
      block the damage. Otherwise, Han Sen would have been gutted by this
      strike.
    </p>

    <p>
      The knife skills of this man in black mail were very strange, and his
      fitness was incredible, definitely much tougher than Tie Yi.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not killed by the strike, which surprised the men in black
      mail slightly. However, he did not stop attacking, but slashed at Han Sen
      again with his knife.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several people in the group also summoned their beast soul weapons to rush
      at Han Sen. Judging from their speed, they were all evolvers with fitness
      above a hundred. Han Sen knew that he could not stay, or else he would
      definitely die there. Using Heresy Mantra and Overload at the same time,
      Han Sen quickly stepped away, running.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, those people besieged Han Sen and there was no place for him to
      go. Han Sen had to rush at two of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two persons cut at Han Sen without hesitation. Han Sen moved left and
      right, like a willow tree in the wind, dodging the attacks from both
      persons.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, he there was no way he could dodge the strike from the men in
      blackmail was chasing after him. His back became blood he immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth and state the silent. He rushed away as fast as
      his legs would carry him and broke the siege of the two persons, running
      fast on the icefield.
    </p>

    <p>
      He knew he could not stay. The fitness of the man in black mail was even
      stronger than his. In terms of both fitness and knife skills, the man was
      the top of the top. With the help of the evolvers with fitness level above
      a hundred, Han Sen would definitely die if he chose to stay.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We could not let him leave alive.&#8221; The man in black mail led
      the group of people to chase after Han Sen, showing strong desire to get
      rid of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resources on the icefield were so limited that it was completely
      normal to fight for them. The Blackgod would not tolerate any challenge to
      his interests or authority, otherwise there was no way he could lead the
      Blackgod Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had known that the competition for resources was heated, but he
      did not expect it to be as fierce as this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s speed was lower than that Blackgod&#8217;s to begin with.
      Without any place to hide on the icefield, there was no way he could run
      away like this.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there were no other evolvers, he could try to fight Blackgod, risking
      his life. However, under the circumstances, he could only try to run away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Turning quickly, Han Sen ran toward the frozen lake again. Seeing Blackgod
      approaching him, Han Sen jumped inside one of the ice holes and
      disappeared.
