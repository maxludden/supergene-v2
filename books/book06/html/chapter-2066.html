<p>“Luckily, you only killed Dragon Thirteen. She was not one of
the prestigious nine. Her death was inconsequential, so the grudge
won’t be all that deep. Now that Yu Shanxin has interceded on your
behalf, the Dragon shouldn’t bother you anymore. Do you think you
can remove the spell on me now?” Xius had actually come up to Han
Sen to get the spell removed.</p>
<p>“We’re still in territory belonging to the Dragon. Let’s wait
until I’m out of it first.” Han Sen resumed walking.</p>
<p>“The Dragon won’t change their minds. Now that they’ve forgiven
you and made a promise to Yu Shanxin, they won’t turn back on their
word. Dragon territory is now the safest place for you. They
wouldn’t dare let you die here. It’s hard to say what might happen
after you leave. If something happens to you out there, whoever
kills you might not even have any ties to the Dragon.” Xius rolled
her eyes.</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying I should stay in the lands of the Dragon?”
Han Sen lifted his lips.</p>
<p>“There is no need. Yu Shanxin helped you, and he represents Sky
Palace. Before anyone thinks of attacking you, they’ll have to
weigh the consequences. And no one will want to incite the wrath of
Sky Palace. Unless there’s someone highly motivated by revenge, no
individual will seek to kill you. At least not immediately, while
things have yet to simmer down,” Xius said.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Xius. “Yu Shanxin killed so many Sky Palace
students. Why was he allowed to remain there?”</p>
<p>Xius hesitated before speaking. “That’s complicated, and it’s
not something the Sky like to talk about with outsiders. I know
that his teacher was strong enough to be considered an elder. He
was framed, and then he died. Then, his memory was tarnished with
the crime of treason. But no one could have expected Yu Shanxin to
react in such an insane way. They were going to kick him out of Sky
Palace, but Yu Shanxin brought the coffin back and started killing
people. Things eventually calmed down after he reached the leader.
Anyone who was involved in the conspiracy, like the elders and
students, were killed by Yu Shanxin.”</p>
<p>The reason Yu Shanxin was allowed to stay in Sky Palace has
something to do with that. He couldn’t obtain the seat of an elder.
He owned an island in Sky Palace, but no one knows what his job
is,” Xius said, then looked at Han Sen. “That is all I know. And
it’s all just hearsay. Outsiders aren’t told much about what
happens there.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. Yu Shanxin had come to save him, and whether it
was an order from Sky Palace or something the man had done on his
own whim, it did not matter. Han Sen now owed him a big one. But a
man like him would probably never need help.</p>
<p>They walked to the spaceport, and when they reached it, he still
hadn’t removed the spell placed on Xius.</p>
<p>When they arrived, all the ships refused to accept Han Sen as a
passenger. The guards even mocked him, telling Han Sen to simply
fly back to Sky Palace, and that there was no need for him to take
their ships.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not mad, though. He looked at Xius. “Xius, you have
your own ship, don’t you? You can take me.”</p>
<p>Xius had no choice but to take him herself. They went back to
Sky Palace.</p>
<p>There was no danger along the way, and Xius successfully brought
Han Sen back to Sky Palace.</p>
<p>“Without an invitation from Sky Palace, this is as far as I can
go. Can you remove the spell now?” Xius patiently asked Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “You have a spell on me too. What’s the
rush?”</p>
<p>“I’m not loafing around like you, with nothing better to do! I
have business to conduct,” Xius said shortly.</p>
<p>After all that time and travel, her patience with Han Sen was
running on fumes. She just wanted to be free of the spell and get
as far away from Han Sen as she possibly could.</p>
<p>Han Sen touched the bite marks on his neck—the ones she had left
behind. The bite marks hadn’t disappeared, so it was obviously not
an ordinary power.</p>
<p>“I was thinking that we’ve been through a lot. And God only
knows when our paths might cross again. Let’s keep a souvenir to
remind each other of our time together. The next time I see these
marks, I will think of you. You should cherish the souvenir I have
given you, too.” After that, Han Sen flew back to Sky Palace.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you *sshole!” Xius was mad, but Han Sen was already in
Sky Palace. She could not go inside without permission.</p>
<p>Xius had no choice but to return to the Gana. She wanted to run
some tests and find out what Han Sen had done to her body.</p>
<p>“If I can break the spell on me, I will make you die. Then, you
can really see the power of a Gana’s kiss,” Xius thought
furiously.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was so scary. Xius did not dare trigger the Gana’s
kiss, in case they both ended up hurting each other.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s super god body could remove all spells, so he wasn’t
afraid of the Gana’s kiss. In fact, he wanted to take a look at how
powerful it was.</p>
<p>Back in Sky Palace, Han Sen was welcomed back by the students.
Everyone had heard that he had killed Sharon and Dragon Thirteen
and of his adventure in Return Ruin Sea.</p>
<p>To the Demon and the Dragon, this was a grand insult. But to Sky
Palace, it was a thing to take pride in.</p>
<p>Han Sen handed over the silver Beginning of Ancient God and the
xenogeneic genes from the Ancient God space. He received permission
to visit the Holy House and collect xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on learning any new geno arts. All he
wanted to do was level up, and so he didn’t go.</p>
<p>Aside from those rewards, Han Sen was granted the title of
Teacher. He could enjoy many benefits now. Some places that weren’t
open to students were now freely accessible to him.</p>
<p>For example, Han Sen had previously been forced to hunt in
Xuanyuan Cave. But with the title of Teacher, he could go to Rare
Beast Island. There were many xenogeneics there, and it was a far
better place than Xuanyuan Cave.</p>
<p>There were many more benefits, too, but teachers had
responsibilities of their own. Every year, he would have to teach
geno arts to students for ten days.</p>
<p>He could teach whatever he wanted, but nothing like Under the
Sky. That was limited by level, and so he could not teach that.</p>
<p>Not many outsiders could earn the title of Teacher, but the
people of Sky Palace had no problem with Han Sen’s promotion. They
were actually excited to hear what he would tell them.</p>
<p>After all, Han Sen had killed Sharon, who was as strong as Lone
Bamboo. The students were interested in his geno arts. And the
stories of Han Sen’s battles were so outstanding. All the students
believed he deserved the title.</p>
<p>Every year, teachers had to teach for ten days. But some busy
teachers had no time, and so they were allowed to stack up their
teaching requirements for up to ten years. Because of this, Han Sen
was not in a rush.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the Yun sisters met up with Han Sen.
They went to practice in the White Jade Building. Han Sen planned
to check out the buildings behind it, hoping that the Jade Airs
there would take his Jadeskin up to Marquise class.</p>
<p>In combat, Jadeskin was much more useful than the Blood-Pulse
Sutra.</p>
