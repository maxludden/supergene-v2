  When she saw the first drop of blood going in and getting closer to the ice jade evil lady’s forehead, Tian Jing’s heart rate started to rise.

As time went by, the drop of blood was able to touch the skin of the ice jade evil lady’s forehead. It enabled Tian Jing to see the blood and ice jade evil lady’s skin combine. It formed a strange connection.

“I did it… I got the ice jade evil lady…” Tian Jing felt the connection grow deeper. She was excited. She realized she had just earned this super unique gene race.

Although she was excited, Tian Jing felt her heart suddenly ache. She coughed up blood as the connection with the ice jade evil lady was suddenly severed.

“How could that happen? It succeeded. How could it be? Is my nine-Yin rare pulse not Yin and cold enough?” Tian Jing asked aloud while opening her eyes. She saw half of her blood blend into the ice jade evil lady’s skin and then get thrown away from the ice jade evil lady’s forehead. Suddenly, it was cast out of the gene egg, speckling the white snow of the snowy mountain.

As Tian Jing wondered why this was happening, the ice egg moved. It started to roll down the hill.

Tian Jing did not know what had just happened. She pondered why the ice egg was so willing to move. It was far too weird.

Tian Jing forced the blood that was in her chest to not spill and steeled herself to run down the mountain to get to a point that was below the rolling ice egg.

The ice egg did not roll quickly. When it reached the halfway point of the hill, she saw someone approach the ice mountain.

The man’s face was quite manly, but he was very pretty. He was so pretty that many women would feel ashamed of themselves. Judging from his face, Tian Jing could not really apply a name to the person. Seeing a little girl and a small cat on the man’s shoulders, Tian Jing was suddenly able to realize the beautiful man was no other than Han Sen. He was supposedly in the throes of the bad power.

“He really did dare to come here,” Tian Jing said with shock.

The closer they were to the snow mountain, the more affected the man should have been. Han Sen was already very close to the snow mountain. According to the old leader, when a man reached there, they should have become a complete woman.

Despite being way too handsome right now, Han Sen’s face was distinctly in possession of the Yang power that defined men. He was not a complete woman.

“Did the ice egg move for him?” Tian Jing had that wretched idea in her head.

Tian Jing had to swiftly deny it. The ice jade evil lady could only be claimed by a woman with a cold Yin Blood-Pulse. Han Sen was not a woman. He did not have the Yin cold Blood-Pulse. He could not take command of the ice jade evil lady, so how could he make the ice egg leave the ice mountain?

Tian Jing saw that the ice egg was indeed flying straight toward Han Sen. When Han Sen almost reached the snow mountain, the ice egg was only nine feet away from him. It was flying to Han Sen.

“Impossible… This is impossible…” Tian Jing could not believe this had just happened. The ice jade evil lady should not have been moving toward a man. It was bewildering for her to even entertain the thought. She did not think it was possible.

Yet, the ice egg had indeed come to a standstill before Han Sen. It was one outstretched arm’s distance away from him.

“Is this the ice jade evil lady?” Han Sen looked at the ice egg in front of him with shock. He could guess what was inside the ice egg, but he was just wondering why the ice jade evil lady gene egg would fall from the mountain and roll in front of him.

He delayed doing anything for a long time. He used the combined powers provided by Spell, which made him no longer feel what the bad powers could do to him. Since it had been so long, he thought Tian Jing would have already claimed the ice jade evil lady by now. He had only gone there now to test his luck.

Who would have guessed there was this weird scene? The ice jade evil lady egg fell down the mountain and rolled right to him.

Han Sen reached out his hand and put it on the ice egg. He wanted to see if it was a real gene egg. When his fingertip just touched the ice egg, he touched the center of the egg to make cracks develop across the surface like spider webs. They kept spreading across the ice egg.

Pang!

The ice egg broke. Ice light went everywhere like a sky full of stars. Within that ice light, the ice jade evil lady’s body appeared.

Her white clothes were like snow. Her hair was like ice and silk. Her skin was snow white. She was so pretty. One could imagine people suffocating in her presence. Everything was so amazing to behold and witness. Han Sen looked upon the ice jade evil lady. The ice jade evil lady’s half-closed eyes were now fully open. Her eyes were like cold gemstones peering back at Han Sen. “Give me a drop of your blood,” the ice jade evil lady said to him. Her voice was so clear that it was like water running by Han Sen’s ears.

When Tian Jing heard that from the position far behind, she was frozen stiff. It was as if she had been struck by a bolt of lightning. “Why would I give you a drop of my blood?” Han Sen looked at the ice jade evil lady with interest. She was nothing normal, that was for sure. Ordinary gene races could not compare to her. Even for rare gene races, this creature was rare.

It was very rare for rare gene races to be born with such incredible intelligence.

“Because you want me to become your gene race,” the ice jade evil lady coldly said. “Isn’t that enough of a reason?”

“Yes. It is enough.” Han Sen looked at the ice jade evil lady. He nodded and put out his finger. He squeezed out a drop of blood.

The ice jade evil lady reached out for Han Sen’s blood. She carefully took the droplet and applied it to her forehead. The blood went inside her. A red dot formed on the ice jade evil lady’s forehead. It made the ice jade evil lady’s body glow with a strange god light. “How is that possible?” Tian Jing thought she must have been having a nightmare. The ice jade evil lady was going forward to ask a man to take her as his gene race. How tough was this to believe? It had her flip a lid and throw the world she knew on its head.

“I thought only pure women would be approved by the ice jade evil lady. I thought when men got close to the ice jade evil lady, only bad things would come to pass. I thought only a woman with an extreme Yin and extremely cold Blood – Pulse would be the one allowed to claim the ice jade evil lady.” Tian Jing’s head was riddled with a thousand questions, but she had no answers for any of them.

As Tian Jing was watching this unfold, the ice jade evil lady became an ice light. She went into Han Sen’s soul, becoming a gene race for Han Sen.

“Annihilation God Spirit gene race claimed: ice jade evil lady.”

Han Sen’s head played that familiar announcement. It gave him a shock. “What is this ice jade evil lady? Right of the bat, she is a born God Spirit gene race that is Annihilation class.”

Han Sen quickly went to check out the information he had on the ice jade evil lady and recognized her progress was juvenile. Even so, her level put her as an Annihilation God Spirit gene race.
