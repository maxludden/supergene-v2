<p>Despite countless attempts, Han Sen never succeeded in
activating The Story of Genes’ cogwheel. But now, things were
different. Han Sen had the peacock king’s soul robe. Through the
buffs provided by the peacock king’s beast soul, his power could
rival that of a deified. With deified power behind him, Han Sen
believed he’d have what it took to finally put the self-cogwheel in
motion.</p>
<p>After a few days, Han Sen found the right time to do that. He
locked himself in an isolated room and fired up The Story of Genes
to get to work on his leveling up plan.</p>
<p>He summoned his peacock king beast soul, and the feathery soul
robe appeared around Han Sen. The peacock symbol on the back of the
robe began to glow.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. The rainbow peacock symbol suddenly
became a peacock king shadow. It floated behind Han Sen.</p>
<p>Many rainbow godlight buffs flowed into Han Sen’s body then.
Rainbow-like colors shimmered through his aura, generating a
substance chain.</p>
<p>With that unlimited soul power, Han Sen cast The Story of Genes
and used the rainbow godlight to push his self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The rainbow godlight that could destroy planets was able to push
The Story of Genes’ self-cogwheel, but the cogwheel only moved a
tiny amount. It looked like an old door with rusty hinges. It was
only slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thrilled, though. He kept pushing the rainbow
godlight power into the self-cogwheel. The soul robe allowed Han
Sen to summon a mind-boggling amount of power, and yet, it seemed
to be fighting an uphill battle as it struggled to push the
self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>“Such much power, yet it can barely move The Story of Genes’
self-cogwheel. If I used my own power, I have no clue when I would
be able to get it moving. Perhaps I would have to wait until all my
other geno arts were deified before I could push The Story of Genes
to King.” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>The self-cogwheel moved steadily, and after it completed one
cycle, it started to move faster and faster. The spell symbol was
getting brighter and brighter, too.</p>
<p>In the end, Han Sen was able to release his power, and the
self-cogwheel was able to spin on its own. The door to the
universal core hall was opened for him. Han Sen entered and
discovered that he was actually someplace new. It was vastly
different from the place he had expected to enter.</p>
<p>“Using different self-cogwheels to enter the core area spawns me
in different places, and that means I can appear in four different
locations. That is interesting.” Han Sen didn’t stay for long. He
proceeded to exit the core area.</p>
<p>The Tianxia System was too dangerous, so now wasn’t the time for
him to kick back and have a relaxed xenogeneic hunt.</p>
<p>The journey, however, was surprisingly free from strife. They
traveled through the Tianxia System for another two weeks. Along
the way, they didn’t encounter any other deified elites. Han Sen
was able to deal with ordinary xenogeneics and Kings easily.</p>
<p>“Little Captain, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it…
Captain, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do
it…” Han Sen and Bao’er were playing Old Man. The pirates were
watching. They kept shouting and clapping as they did. If people
didn’t know better, they would believe this was a television
commercial.</p>
<p>In that fun atmosphere, it looked as if they were having a
simple competition. Han Sen appeared relaxed, but he suddenly
became serious.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, guess which card this is,” Han Sen said with a smile.
He was looking at Bao’er’s two cards.</p>
<p>“You guess.” Bao’er smiled and blinked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You’re getting smart, Little Evil. Not even I can see what
you’re thinking about these days.” Han Sen looked at the two cards
but hesitated. He couldn’t tell what the two cards in Bao’er’s
hands were. He couldn’t tell which was the ghost card and which was
the card that he needed.</p>
<p>If he picked the wrong card, and thus ended up with the ghost
card, he would stand no chance.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the nearby pirates. He wanted to see if he
could read their faces to learn where the right card was, but he
received no answer.</p>
<p>“Daddy, stop looking at them. They cannot see what card I have.
You can’t learn anything from their faces.” Bao’er smiled
beatifically and said, “This time, I’m going to win.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled. He reached his hand out to a card and said, “I
want this card.”</p>
<p>As Han Sen touched the card, Bao’er’s face changed. But it was
only for a moment.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly let go of that card and picked up the other. He
flipped it over to reveal a three of hearts. It paired with Han
Sen’s three of spades.</p>
<p>“Why… why I lost…” Bao’er clutched her face, looking destroyed.
She threw the ghost card down on the table.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha… your father is your father forever!” Han Sen laughed
and stroked her head.</p>
<p>“Do it again! I’m going to win,” Bao’er pleaded while gripping
the cards.</p>
<p>Han Sen coughed into his hand. “I think I’m busy now. Let them
play with you.” Han Sen quickly stood up and shoved a pirate down
to play with her.</p>
<p>“This little girl is getting too smart. I almost got fooled by
her. I cannot play with her anymore because losing would be way too
embarrassing,” Han Sen thought, touching his nose.</p>
<p>Bao’er wasn’t happy that she had finally found a chance to play
with him, and she had still lost. She felt quite depressed because
of this, and she took it out on the pirates. A short time later,
the bodies of all the pirates were covered in stickers.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to his room and summoned Spell. Ever since The
Story of Genes had become King class, Han Sen had tried to figure
out what The Story of Genes’ area did.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s self-cogwheel didn’t connect with any
universal cogwheels, but it could still push the self-cogwheels of
other creatures. The self-cogwheel of The Story of Genes was
completely independent, though. It just kept spinning in place, all
alone. It didn’t connect with anything.</p>
<p>Aside from making Han Sen’s body and genes stronger, he hadn’t
discovered what The Story of Genes’ area did.</p>
<p>Spell had become King class when he pushed his self-cogwheel.
Some of her abilities had gotten stronger, but otherwise, she had
gained no new forms or powers.</p>
<p>Aside from her body getting better, Spell was the same as when
she was a Duke.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen had been surprised to discover a self-cogwheel
in Spell’s body.</p>
<p>Spell was just his geno armor, much like the Dongxuan Armor.
They were just by-products of geno arts. They shouldn’t possess
their own self-cogwheels.</p>
<p>But Spell was like a real creature, and she had her own
self-cogwheel. That really surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t been investigating how to use The Story of Genes,
he probably wouldn’t have looked at Spell’s body with the Dongxuan
Aura. It might have been a long time before he discovered her
self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>Spell’s self-cogwheel was the same as Han Sen’s self-cogwheel.
It was like a copied version.</p>
<p>Han Sen was sure that it wasn’t his own self-cogwheel, though.
And that was because he was unable to control Spell’s cogwheel.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes suddenly widened. “Does that mean The Story of
Genes’ self-cogwheel is designed to push Spell’s own cogwheel?”</p>
