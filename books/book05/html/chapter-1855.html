<h3>Chapter 1855</h3>

<p>The three of them sped up. They chased after Captain Wood’s
group for a dozen miles, before coming across a body crumpled on
the floor. It looked as if the person had died a long time ago, but
strangely, the clothing the body wore belonged to one of the Barons
that had previously accompanied them.</p>
<p>And there wasn’t just one such body. A little further on, they
found more Baron corpses. The manner in which they died seemed to
reflect what had occurred to Wind Viscount. Their heads had been
blown open, leaving a gaping hole.</p>
<p>“Weird. Didn’t they have the lotus roots? Didn’t they erase the
markings? That should have at least lasted them a good while.” Gu
Qingcheng frowned.</p>
<p>“It looks like the lotus root might be useless, after all.” Han
Sen pointed to the ground. There were some remains of the lotus on
the ground.</p>
<p>And near the shreds of lotus, there was another Baron corpse.
The man was holding half of a lotus root, indicating he had been
eating it when he died. Halfway through his consumption of the
plant, part of his head had exploded.</p>
<p>You are telling me that those lotus roots are actually useless?”
Xie Qing King’s face changed.</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re useless, but we don’t know for sure yet. These
guys are dead, but you guys are alive. It doesn’t look like this
matter is all that simple. Hmm, we need to catch up with them. I
hope I am wrong, of course. If I’m not, things will have taken a
swift turn for the worse.” Han Sen sped up on his travel, and every
now and again, they would catch sight of a Baron that was dead and
clutching a lotus.</p>
<p>Little Silver suddenly came to a stop. The egg mark on his
forehead turned into a black bird. Little Silver seemed upset by
the change, and he kept on scratching the point.</p>
<p>“My head feels weird, too.” Xie Qing King grasped his
forehead.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng. The egg
markings on their foreheads had turned into birds.</p>
<p>“You guys should eat some of the lotus and stay back here. Don’t
follow me any further.” Han Sen grabbed a lotus and passed one to
Little Silver.</p>
<p>Little Silver gobbled it up, and he was struck with that
chilling sensation. Afterward, the bird on his forehead grew
fainter.</p>
<p>“You guys should take more of the lotus and stay away from here.
I’ll go on ahead and take a look.” After that, Han Sen summoned his
Teeth Rabbit shoes and ran forward quickly.</p>
<p>He traveled a dozen miles in a single moment. On his way, he saw
the bodies of many more Barons, and even one Marquise. The latter
was one of Captain Wood’s guards.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept going forward until he came before a palace. There,
he saw something that gave him a shock.</p>
<p>In front of that palace, the big black egg was hovering in
mid-air. It was burning with golden fire. Below the egg, three
Marquise and Captain Wood himself were also ablaze with golden
fire. They looked ready to become charcoal.</p>
<p>Captain Wood was doing okay. His body was surrounded by blue
light, and he was managing to hold off the flames. The three
Marquise, on the other hand, were truly on fire.</p>
<p>Black Steel had fallen across the stairs. The Dragon Back Knife
was hovering over his head, as the shadow of a dragon covered him
to protect him. It was holding the gold fire at bay.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife leaped out from Han Sen’s backpack, its blade
pointed at the egg. It emitted a purple mist, like the egg was a
grand foe. The gold flames of the egg were approaching like a
meteor. Ghost Teeth Knife cut them in half.</p>
<p>But the golden flames that were cut in half continued their
approach.</p>
<p>Han Sen dodged them, then grabbed Ghost Teeth Knife.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife could only attack. It wasn’t much for defense,
so Han Sen could not use it to block. It was a far cry from the
Dragon Back Knife, which was currently focused on protecting Black
Steel.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Han Sen asked, as he evaded more fire.</p>
<p>He was wearing his Teeth Rabbit shoes, so he was blisteringly
quick. The fire was unable to burn him.</p>
<p>When Captain Wood saw Han Sen, who had not died or been
permanently wounded from his time in that hall, he was incredibly
shocked. He couldn’t dwell much on the matter, given the current
circumstances, however. So, he just said, “Kill the Raven blood and
do not let it get free. Otherwise, we are all dead!”</p>
<p>Black Steel then yelled to Han Sen, “The egg absorbed Skygod’s
fireseed! The power of its fire is cruel and strong; you should
run!”</p>
<p>Wood Duke was screaming. Eventually, he proved unable to hold
back the fire, and his skin began to sear and sizzle.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t keen on the prospect of saving Captain Wood, but
Little Silver and the others had the mark. If he didn’t destroy the
egg right here, they’d all end up like Captain Wood.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Teeth Rabbit shoes were incredibly fast, and with a
swift move, he was able to dodge two flames. Holding Ghost Teeth
Knife, he swept forward to strike the giant egg wreathed in golden
fire.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power wasn’t sufficient to activate Ghost Teeth
Knife’s true strength, but right now, the knife was feeling
threatened. It summoned power by its own volition, power of
proportions that exceeded the capabilities of a Duke.</p>
<p>It was like the egg was a living creature. It cast a number of
gold flames towards Han Sen, which came down on him like rain.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was like a bird in the sky. He evaded a dozen
fires and slashed the egg.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The purple mist and the golden flames were both extinguished.
But the egg did not get damaged.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife’s full strength did not affect it. This
realization made Han Sen frown.</p>
<p>More attacks were coming at Han Sen now, too. So, Han Sen used
his Teeth Rabbit shoes to fly. He evaded all the fire and employed
his knifemind. He looked like a monster as he swooped down at the
eggshell, slashing.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Some marks were left on the egg, but it had yet to crack.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too weak, and he could only push his power to reach
the capabilities of a Viscount. If he had the power of a King,
alongside that Ghost Teeth Knife, he could undoubtedly break the
egg in two.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept moving his body, as he tried to dodge the golden
flames. He was going to hit the giant egg again.</p>
<p>When he hit the egg this time, however, there was no noise. It
was like the knife found itself suddenly sticking to the egg. But
when he did this, the egg itself showed a reaction, and it bounced
itself away.</p>
<p>Han Sen was delighted by this, as he had just used Yin Yang
Blast. The power he used from the Ghost Teeth Knife seemed to
work.</p>
<p>The egg backed away like it was scared. But it still carried its
golden fire. It dodged Han Sen’s knife, not wanting to get hit
again.</p>
<p>It was just an egg, though, and it couldn’t move very fast. Han
Sen, on the other hand, soared through the sky like a phoenix.
Again, he slashed the giant egg.</p>
<p>The egg jumped like a cat getting its tail stepped on.</p>
