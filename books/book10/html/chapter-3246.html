<p>“Please stop where you are.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding Bao’er while flying through the blizzard
when he heard a woman’s voice call out to him. He stopped and
looked.</p>
<p>Ever since he had gone to the ice fields via Galaxy
Teleportation, he had been on the hunt for land pulses.
Unfortunately, he was not very good at looking for pulses. Up until
now, he had yet to find anything. He regretted not bringing Mister
Yang or Bald Guy along. That would have been great. The people
coming toward him were a man and a woman. They were both riding
atop a Kirin. Han Sen had noticed their presence a long time ago.
He just did not know why they wanted him to stop.</p>
<p>“What is your name, Mister? We are Xuan Mi Zong’s students, Tian
Jing and Zhen Xia.” A man and a woman dismounted the jade Kirin.
The woman performed a strange hand gesture at Han Sen while she
spoke.</p>
<p>“How lucky is that? I am just a nobody. I do not need to tell
you my name. What do you two need?” Han Sen did not have much to
think about concerning the Xuan Mi Zong. He only knew it was one of
the parties in Wu Wei Dao Palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already seen Zhuo Dong Lai from the Sky Party.
Compared to Zhuo Dong Lai, it was clear to him that these people
were far inferior beings.</p>
<p>“Excuse me for asking, but what is your relation to this little
girl?” Tian Jing looked inside Han Sen’s cloak and saw Bao’er’s
head sticking out of it a bit.</p>
<p>“Has my daughter somehow offended you?” Han Sen thought about
it. Bao’er had been with him the entire time. There was no way she
would have had the opportunity to go and prank someone.</p>
<p>“Is she really your daughter?” Tian Jing looked at Han Sen and
Bao’er with sheer disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes. Is there a problem?” Han Sen did not know what she was
implying.</p>
<p>“Is that a real daughter? Does she share your blood?” Tian Jing
asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, she is,” Han Sen said with a frown. “What do you
guys want? If there is nothing important for you to tell me, I need
to be on my way. There are more important things for me to spend my
time doing.” Tian Jing thought for a moment before saying, “I would
like to take your daughter as a student. Let her join the Xuan Mi
Zong. If you have any conditions about her membership, ask all the
questions you want to. If you have a monetary concern, name any sum
of money.”</p>
<p>Tian Jing thought Han Sen and Bao’er did not look similar in the
least. It was hard to believe they were a real father and daughter.
Ergo, she wished to test them.</p>
<p>If he was planning to use a blood sacrifice skill like the evil
land pulse masters, they could not resist the temptation and sell
the little daughter to her.</p>
<p>After all, blood sacrifice skills only required one little girl.
Nothing else was required. Just an ordinary slave girl could get
the job done. So, getting a fair price for one little was a
tempting prospect.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I am not selling my daughter,” Han Sen said. He then
started moving.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Tian Jing was a bit too forthwith. She
approached him and immediately announced a desire to purchase his
daughter. If it was not for Han Sen having a good temper and the
woman herself not appearing to be too mean, things would not have
ended so nicely. He would have likely beat her up.</p>
<p>“Hang on. I will use this gene race to swap. How about letting
your daughter become a student for this?” Zhen Xia stopped Han Sen
and summoned a gene race. The gene race looked like a lion. It
burned with fire. It melted the snow around. In that snowy place,
it was like a burning campfire. It looked very overbearing and
weirdly powerful.</p>
<p>“It is a king-class red fire lion,” Zhen Xia said to Han Sen.
“If you are willing to let your daughter take up my sister’s offer,
it is yours.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He suddenly heard Bao’er use a voice only the
two of them could hear. “Dad, I don’t think you are going to be
able to find a land pulse. I think these two people are here
looking for a land pulse. Why don’t we follow them and exploit them
for resources?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this was the right thing to do. Allowing Bao’er
to follow them was not a bad idea.</p>
<p>Han Sen coughed and smiled. “If the two of you are so serious
about this, then fine. I will let my daughter become this woman’s
student. But first thing’s first. Give me the gene race before I
give her.”</p>
<p>“That is no problem. We are Xuan Mi Zong students. We would
never think of lying to you.” Zhen Xia was very quick to agree. He
transferred the red fire lion to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen took the red fire lion, passed Bao’er to Tian Jing, and
said, “Lady, my daughter is in your hands now. It does not matter
to me if she wants to be your student.”</p>
<p>Tian Jing looked at Han Sen with disdain. She thought Han Sen
was an evil land pulse master who was willing to use a girl to find
a land pulse through horrid sacrifice. So, she was not going to
behave politely to him.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry,” Tian Jing coldly said. “You can go now.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He asked, “Why should I leave? I am only
giving her to you as a student. I am not selling my daughter to
you. Why would you think about separating us?”</p>
<p>Tian Jing was speechless. She had never seen someone this
obscene before. He sold his daughter and still had the audacity to
say something like that.</p>
<p>“We have things to do,” Zhen Xia said with an annoyed look on
his face. “We cannot travel with you. If you want to see your
daughter again, you can go to Xuan Mi Zong and see her there.”</p>
<p>“OK.” Han Sen felt bad and nodded. He then said to Tian Jing,
“My daughter is very naughty. You will have to be careful. Here is
my phone number. If you do not want her anymore, just give me a
call and I will pick her up in a jiffy.”</p>
<p>“Do not worry. I will take good care of her. I won’t abandon
her.” Tian Jing stared at Han Sen. She thought he would never buy
Bao’er back.</p>
<p>“Cough! Cough! It is best that way, but you should still keep my
number. You never know. It might come in handy one day.” Han Sen
wrote his phone number down on a piece of paper and squeezed it
into Bao’er’s hands.</p>
<p>“I believe we will never have any contact with you ever again.”
Tian Jing did not want to waste any more time with Han Sen. She did
not stop getting the phone number, but she put Bao’er atop on the
jade Kirin and flew away with Zhen Xia.</p>
<p>“I do not think so,” Han Sen said with a curl of his lips. He
then walked off into the storm.</p>
<p>Tian Jing used a warm light to protect Bao’er. She did not want
her to get cold. She sounded very caring as she asked, “Little
girl, what is your name?”</p>
<p>“Big Sister, my name is Bao’er,” Bao’er said with a blink of her
eyes.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, was that person really your dad?” Although Tian Jing
was certain Han Sen was an evil land pulse master and wanted to use
Bao’er as a blood sacrifice for a land pulse, she still wanted to
ask anyway.</p>
<p>“He makes me call him Daddy, but he is not my real father.”
Bao’er looked up with pitiable eyes. What Bao’er said was the
truth. She wasn’t really born through Han Sen. She came out of a
gourd.</p>
<p>In Tian Jing’s ears, those words confirmed that Han Sen was
nothing more than an evil land pulse caster.</p>
<p>“He always bullies me and never gives me food.” Bao’er kept
crying while she spoke. She looked very pitiable. It was not just
Tian Jing whose heart was melting. Even men with iron hearts would
have broken down seeing her.</p>
<p>“It is OK, Bao’er. There is no need to worry. Big Sister will
look after you from now on. No one will dare try to bully you
again. You can eat whatever you want in the future.” As she cradled
Bao’er against her bosom, Tian Jing suddenly felt as if she wanted
to be a mother.</p>
<p>If Tian Jing knew why Bao’er said Han Sen bullied her, it was
because he always won their games. To say she was not allowed to
eat was just a reference to her eating too many snacks and being
stopped. She wondered what she would think.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, Bao’er had not lied once. It made Tian
Jing believe Bao’er was always tortured.</p>
