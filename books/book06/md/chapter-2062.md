  A few knife strikes broke the lancelight. Han Sen swung his Blood Feather Knife, and many knife silks were weaved through the air. They tangled and knotted themselves around Dragon Nine’s wings, limbs, and body. He was unable to hold his lance and thrust anymore.

Han Sen had been dodging for so long so he could cast his knife silks. To deal with a strong power like Dragon Nine’s, soft power was useful.

Dragon Nine’s body was gripped tightly by the silks. They tore through his armor and dug into his skin, but the contact produced sparks.

Dragon Nine’s body had the same glow that the lance did, and all of a sudden, the knife silks around his body were broken.

“Dragon Light protection!” Xius recognized the power he had just employed.

Han Sen frowned. The power on Dragon Nine was concentrated like his lance was. It broke the knife silks easily.

“No one can beat the power of the Dragon Light.” Dragon Nine moved his body, shaking off all the spiderweb-like strands of silk that remained.

The lance and his body synergized perfectly as they came after Han Sen again.

Dragon Nine’s whole body was concentrated with a strong red light. He could use the Evilbreaker Dragon Light with amazing precision.

And Han Sen found himself at a disadvantage once more. He had to rely on his formation to fight.

Han Sen observed Dragon Nine’s power. It was different from Dragon Thirteen’s Evilbreaker Lance. The red Dragon Light was more concentrated than Dragon Thirteen’s Evilbreaker Lance’s lights.

The red Dragon Light was like something living. It concentrated and exploded when it needed to, unlike Dragon Thirteen’s lancelights, which lost all form of control when expelled from the body. Those really were just simple lancelights.

“This must be a modified version of Evilbreaker power.” Han Sen tried to think of a way he might triumph over this new form of attack.

“Needlehead versus light. I need to generate more power than he does. If I don’t, I will lose.” Han Sen quickly made a decision.

Although his knife silks were concentrated, they still weren’t as dense as the Evilbreaker powers. But the knife silks also possessed qualities that the Dragon Light lacked. The Dragon Light was rough and strong, whereas the knife silks were soft and gentle. They were polar opposites.

Han Sen had suffered under an Evilbreaker Lance’s power before, so he was fairly proficient in doing battle against that sort of technique. Now that he looked at Dragon Nine’s Dragon Light structure, Han Sen had a new thought.

If he was able to use his gentle powers perfectly, they would not be any weaker than his enemy’s strong power. But Han Sen was not very good with this power.

If his Jadeskin leveled up to Marquise class, he could effectively use Moon to do battle with Dragon Nine. But right now, only the Blood-Pulse Sutra had reached Marquise status.

The Blood-Pulse Sutra was for making babies and absorbing xenogeneic genes. It was the number one geno art for passing down traits, but for combat, it was a little on the limp side.

Han Sen planned to learn the structure of Dragon Nine’s Dragon Light. He wanted to combine it with Moon’s gentle power. That way, the knife silks could become stronger and achieve greater concentration.

This was what the Dongxuan Aura was good at doing. After examining the honeycomb design that Dragon Nine used to concentrate his power, Han Sen restructured the mass of his knife silks. That way, he could apply the gentleness of the Moon to the brute force of a replicated Dragon Light.

The Dongxuan Aura was firing on all cylinders, and when Han Sen slashed, the knife silks came flowing out like a flurry of ribbons. They broke before they even touched the lancelight.

It was not easy to produce knife silks that were a combination of two opposing powers. Luckily, the Dongxuan Sutra allowed him to modify the delicate sequence structures of his silks, and Yin Yang Blast allowed him to reverse the Yin and Yang of his powers. If not for those two skills, he wouldn’t even have thought about attempting this.

Even so, Han Sen tried it many times to no avail. If the soft powers were too much, they made the knife silks too weak. If the force power was too much, then the knife silks would shred themselves.

Han Sen needed to find a balance between the heavy and soft forces to make his plan work. That way, the knife silks would be tough enough without destroying themselves.

This was just the beginning, though. He continued using Dragon Nine’s honeycomb power to concentrate the knife silks so he could go against the Dragon Light.

Han Sen’s tests kept on failing. He used the dragon wings on his ears and his movements to avoid Dragon Nine’s attacks. No matter how much power Dragon Nine put into his attacks, though, he could not harm Han Sen.

Xius was frozen. She could tell Han Sen was having a problem with his knife silks and that he was testing something.

Only Han Sen could conduct such tests while doing battle with an enemy like Dragon Nine, and Dragon Nine couldn’t stop him no matter how hard he tried.

Dragon One and the others could tell what was going on, too. It infuriated Dragon Fifteen, who shouted, “That Han Sen should die! How dare he humiliate Dragon Nine this way!”

Dragon Seven frowned. “Han Sen is weird. He has dragon wings on his back that looks like ours, and he teleports in the way Sharon did with his Break Space Flash. But only Sharon was able to use that power, due to his ties to the Demon. How does Han Sen do what he is doing?”

Dragon One grunted. “It is fine. Break Space Flash costs a lot of energy. The more he uses it, the more exhausted he will be. Sooner or later, he will fail.”

Dragon Nineteen curiously asked, “Big Brother, what is Han Sen testing? His knife silks are getting weaker.”

“He is copying,” Dragon One muttered with disdain.

“Copying what?” Dragon Nineteen did not understand.

“He is copying Old Nine’s Evilbreaker Dragon Light. He’s trying to use it to improve his knife silks,” Dragon One said.

At those words, everyone was shocked. Dragon Fifteen was so angered by this, he cackled. “Han Sen has some balls!

The Evilbreaker power of the Dragon is difficult to copy. It’s stupid to even think about trying it if you don’t have the body of a Dragon. And Brother Nine’s Evilbreaker powers were modified in accordance to the specific needs and proficiencies of his body. Concentrated powers are Brother Nine’s area of expertise. How can Han Sen hope to copy him?”

Just like Dragon Fifteen said, Han Sen’s knife silks kept failing because it was either too hard or too soft. He couldn’t find a balance.

Dragon Nine was enraged by Han Sen’s behavior. His pretty face looked hard. “I was bom in the Blood Dragon Pool. I swap skin every nine days. That is how I have received my Blood Dragon Body a thousand times, and that is what enables me to possess the Evilbreaker powers and create the Blood Dragon Light I wield. You cannot simply copy this.”
