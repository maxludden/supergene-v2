<p>Seeing Bai Qing Xia striking with his palm, Han Sen unleashed
another Shocking Sky Punch.</p>
<p>He would have liked to use other techniques, but he had only
just started using his Bai Yi disguise. He hadn’t yet had the time
to learn any other skills. He had been lucky to learn this punch
from the Extreme King alpha’s statue, but using other skills might
expose him.</p>
<p>The Shocking Sky Punch was a technique that every member of the
Extreme King had to learn. Although it was basic, it was still very
powerful. It would be ridiculous to call the skill invincible, but
it could challenge a surprising number of other techniques.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The fist and the palm hit each other. Han Sen’s Shocking Sky
Punch blocked Bai Qing Xia’s day and night cycle split. But still,
no one was winning.</p>
<p>“Huh. Bai Yi’s Shocking Sky Punch managed to block the day and
night cycle split? Today is a weird day. We are witnessing so many
bizarre things.”</p>
<p>“They are both first-tier Kings. How can a Shocking Sky Punch
break a day and night cycle split?”</p>
<p>“The Bai family has too many powerful members. Those two princes
have never really revealed themselves before. I wouldn’t have
expected the two to possess powers like this. They are both so
talented, and it seems as if the fight between these two princes
has only just begun.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Everyone was talking. Instead of attacking Han Sen again, Bai
Qing Xia just stared at his opponent. A long time later, he said,
“You are very special, Brother Sixteen. It was no wonder that you
were able to claim the alpha statue.”</p>
<p>“You’re not bad, either,” Han Sen admitted with a nod.</p>
<p>Bai Qing Xia raised his head. He looked up to the king tree and
said, “The king tree is going to wake up, so we should cease our
fighting for now. If you are here to seek protection from King’s
Cover, then let us determine a victory through how many Kingese we
both receive. How does that sound?”</p>
<p>“I’m just here on a stroll. I don’t care if I get Kingese or
not,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Bai Qing Xia laughed. “Are you afraid to lose?”</p>
<p>“Huh? You really think I can actually be afraid of you?” Han Sen
grunted dismissively.</p>
<p>“Then it is settled. We will determine the victor based on how
many Kingese we each receive. Whoever has the most Kingese will
win.” After saying this, Bai Qing Xia returned to the king dragon’s
head.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no idea how to get the Kingese. So, he pretended to
shoot Bai Qing Xia a look of contempt. He flew to another king
dragon’s head and sat down just like the other prince.</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Qing Xia close his eyes atop the dragon’s head, Han
Sen pretended to do the same. The blood kirin sat down next to
him.</p>
<p>“Bai Qing Xia and Bai Yi are both seeking King Cover’s
protection. I wonder how many Kingese they will receive?”</p>
<p>“In the past, I would have thought they would be lucky to earn
one or two. But now, it is hard to tell. Those two have been
keeping secrets, and it is obvious they are looking to impress
everyone. They’re probably still hiding much of their power.”</p>
<p>“You are right. I didn’t expect two normal princes to hide their
powers in the way they have. It looks like this is the Extreme
King’s strongest era.”</p>
<p>“Haha! As the royal children grow stronger, their fights will
grow stronger as well. I do not know if that is good or bad.”</p>
<p>The king tree’s leaves started to glow, but few of the royal
children went looking for the primary root king dragons. Most of
them wanted to watch Han Sen and Bai Qing Xia.</p>
<p>Every leaf on the king tree had some Kingese. When the king tree
woke up, the Kingese on the leaves grew brighter. Under their
light, the leaves looked gold.</p>
<p>Kingese was the blood pulse of the leaves. Every king leaf’s
blood pulse was different. As time passed, the blood pulse became
brighter. The Kingese brightened into gold symbols branded onto the
gold leaves, and each symbol gave off a different sensation.</p>
<p>Some of them were strong like fire. Some of them felt like
rushing water. Some of them were heavy on the ground, and others
were deep like an abyss.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen couldn’t decipher the Kingese, he could feel
their power. He could understand what they meant.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because Han Sen was good at learning. It was because
the power of each Kingese was linked to a substance. There was a
deeper meaning to them than a mere hieroglyph. Han Sen didn’t have
to learn them. He just had to see the shape of the item that was
related to the Kingese. Then, he could recognize what they
meant.</p>
<p>“This world is so big. Everything and anything can exist here.
Even the leaves of the king tree are in some way connected to the
fabric of the world. It’s all-inclusive. How amazing.” Han Sen
sighed, and then he thought to himself, “If I could dig it out and
haul it back to the Alliance, I wonder if it would still grow?”</p>
<p>The king tree and its leaves woke up. The Kingese was shining
brightly. A king dragon nearby roared and then fell into the
ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw that Bai Qing Xia hadn’t moved yet. He furrowed his
eyebrows. “Does he not want the protection of the Kingese? Why is
he sitting on the head of a dragon? That way, he will not be able
to go underground.”</p>
<p>That was what Han Sen was thinking, at least. He didn’t move. He
maintained his position just as Bai Qing Xia did, sitting atop the
dragon head.</p>
<p>The king dragons around them were all drilling into the soil.
And then, both of their own king dragons started to move. Bai Qing
Xia still didn’t move.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t sure what was going on. The king dragon didn’t go
underground as the other dragons did. Instead, it raised its head
and went up to the top of the tree.</p>
<p>The boughs of the tree high above were like a golden sky. The
Kingese was shining like a platter of gold stars. The two dragons
kept going up and up, as if they were shooting off into the
cosmos.</p>
<p>If someone hadn’t actually seen it in person, it would have been
difficult to imagine how beautiful it looked.</p>
<p>Han Sen was standing atop the dragon’s head, staring at the
shining Kingese. It was like he was in a dreamland.</p>
<p>Those two king dragons stopped moving forward after reaching the
halfway point. After all, they were just the roots of the king
tree, and there was only so far that they could go. They would have
to disconnect from the king tree to go further.</p>
<p>Bai Qing Xia opened his eyes. He stood up, looked at the
Kingese, and said, “The older one should do this first, so go
ahead.”</p>
<p>“I am just sight-seeing. You go first,” Han Sen said simply.</p>
<p>He had no idea how to gain the approval and protection of the
Kingese.</p>
<p>Bai Qing Xia didn’t decline the offer to go first. He looked up
to the Kingese, and then his body started to glow with a white
light. The white became more intense, and it made Bai Qing Xia’s
body brighter. It was like he was becoming a transparent jade
stone.</p>
<p>“King body?” Han Sen squinted. Bai Qing Xia was still standing
on his dragon’s head. His body was so bright, it was like he was
wholly wrapped-up by a godlight. It wasn’t just his flesh, either;
even his hair looked like jade.</p>
<p>With his king body’s power spreading, the Kingese on the king
leaves answered. A king leaf started to shake. It began to make a
rustling noise, like it was caught in a wind that affected nothing
else.</p>
