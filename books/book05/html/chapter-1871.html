<p>“I want to go to Planet Crooked Rock,” Han Sen told Icebird
Duke.</p>
<p>You want to recruit Gana?” Icebird Duke understood Han Sen’s
thought process.</p>
<p>Planet Crooked Rock was a place that belonged to the Feathers.
The primary race there, however, was the Gana. They were supposed
to be a higher race, but for some reason, the Gana on that planet
had abandoned their people to join the Feathers.</p>
<p>Now that the Feathers had fallen, Holy Heaven had been closed.
They could no longer afford to take care of other planets and
races. The planet had not been taken over yet, but many different
factions were vying for it. Many wanted to claim it.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to go to Planet Crooked Rock due to the
complications of the races there. Gana was one of the mainstream
races, but there were many others there, as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen also fancied trying his luck. If he was able to recruit
a few of the Gana, then that wouldn’t be too shabby, either. The
Gana were very good at producing medicine from xenogeneic genes.
They were known as geniuses, and many factions liked the prospect
of procuring their special talents.</p>
<p>But due to the fact that so many different factions wanted them,
the Gana had yet to decide which they should follow.</p>
<p>“Not bad. I would like to have some Gana. If I am unable to
procure any, there are those of other races to choose from. Either
way, there should be a diverse selection to pick from,” Han Sen
randomly said.</p>
<p>“You should put your hope into getting those of another race.
Don’t bother with the Gana, because our Rebate Gold Jade King went
to Gana two months ago and was unable to recruit any. The Gana were
way too popular with other races,” Icebird Duke said.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a look first, anyway. If I am lucky enough, they
might be willing to slog through the hard times with me!” Han Sen
made it sound as if he was kidding.</p>
<p>He was, actually. He didn’t have much hope of recruiting any of
the Gana, and his primary goal was to grab Wang Yuhang under the
pretense of recruitment.</p>
<p>After he arrived on the planet, he only then noticed how
complicated Planet Crooked Rock really was. There were many
airships and battleships in the area, all belonging to an array of
separate factions. They had each come there to try to recruit the
Gana.</p>
<p>Seeing how things were on Planet Crooked Rock, it was obvious
that there were many Kings up for grabs.</p>
<p>The flying airship Han Sen had been on was investigated upon
arrival. When they declared themselves to be the Rebate, they were
granted access to the planet.</p>
<p>If they had been a small race of no renown, they probably
wouldn’t have even been allowed to land on the planet. So, the
chances of Han Sen meeting up with any of the Gana to try his luck
would have been zero.</p>
<p>Icebird Duke brought Han Sen over to meet with Gold Jade King,
but they were unable to. It was a Duke that came out to greet
them.</p>
<p>“You are Knife Queen’s student, and you are Icebird Duke. I am
sorry, but my master is currently unavailable, and he cannot come
to meet with you at this time. He has sent me here to aid you in
the meantime. If there is anything you require, do not hesitate to
make a request.” The Duke certainly sounded polite.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. We have come here to recruit some people,
actually. I wonder if you have a manifest that notes the different
populations that reside on Planet Crooked Rock. If you can provide
us a copy, we would be most grateful,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“That is easy. I will certainly make a copy for you.” The Duke
said this, and then went on to say, “Do you two plan on recruiting
the Gana?”</p>
<p>“That would be the best-case scenario, yes,” Han Sen
answered.</p>
<p>The Duke smiled. “Recruiting the Gana is no small feat. Still,
you might try your luck. Who knows? You might be fortunate enough
to gather a few.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I appreciate the advice.” After Han Sen accepted the
manifest, he said his goodbyes.</p>
<p>“You guys are looking to recruit the Gana? Ha! So naive. Even if
the queen herself had come along, I doubt any Gana would join you.”
After Han Sen left, the Duke spoke to himself.</p>
<p>After Han Sen accepted the information he was given, he allowed
Icebird Duke to go ahead and scope out those of the less
significant races. They could try to recruit a few Nobles out of
those.</p>
<p>Judging from the state of things on this planet, though, he
thought that it was unlikely he’d procure members of the Gana. The
Gana were receiving many generous offers from the big factions;
there was no reason for them to go to an undeveloped place
populated by Barons.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked around alone, and he also made sure he wasn’t
being followed. By his lonesome, he trekked up to a lonely
mountain. He found a cave, and after securing it, he teleported
back to the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Han Sen called Wang Yuhang and told him about going to the geno
universe. Wang Yuhang was very excited by the prospect, and he told
Han Sen he’d come over right away.</p>
<p>The entire Alliance was practically Han Sen’s back garden. And
the gardeners were the Ji Family.</p>
<p>Many factions had learned of the existence of the geno universe,
and many had aspirations of their people getting strong enough to
enter and begin building up a place for their families. But none
had yet been capable of going.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang had been given Han Sen’s xenogeneic genes. He had
made it to the Alliance as a human, but without Han Sen’s guidance,
he’d likely die if he left the sanctuary by himself. No one went
without Han Sen bringing them.</p>
<p>After Han Sen and Wang Yuhang finished talking, Wang Yuhang
piloted an aircraft to get to him.</p>
<p>“Little Han, take me to the geno universe! I want to see those
ladies with cat ears. If they are as hot as you say they are…” Wang
Yuhang came running into the house all happy.</p>
<p>“Don’t rush. You can see them, but you must know that when I
bring you over, you have to listen to me. You cannot do anything by
yourself,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Sure! I’ll listen to your every word. Except for selecting a
wife and making babies, of course.” Wang Yuhang patted his
chest.</p>
<p>That is fine. I don’t want to get involved with your wife and
kids.” Han Sen then brought Wang Yuhang to Planet Crooked Rock, but
Wang Yuhang had not eaten many xenogeneic genes. He hadn’t been in
the Alliance very long, either. He still wouldn’t be able to
generate geno armor. So, Han Sen knew he’d have to feed the man a
lot more genes to produce that, first and foremost.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought Death Goddess and Dragon Lady Chef along, too.
They were able to generate their geno armors in the cave.</p>
<p>Lady Chef had been staying in Han Sen’s house in the Alliance.
She was in charge of the kitchen there, so she had been able to
nibble away at more xenogeneic genes than most of Han Sen’s
companions.</p>
<p>Death Goddess had eaten quite a bit, too, so she was ready to
generate a geno armor at any point. She could fire arrows on a
whim, and so she was quite a scary person to have hanging around
the Alliance.</p>
<p>When she was staying in Han Sen’s old house, she had fired
arrows and toppled a lot of buildings. Han Sen’s new family home
was in a city. It’d be bad news if she woke up in a bad mood and
decided to go knocking buildings over with a hail of arrows.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen wanted to bring her to the geno universe to prevent
any unfortunate accidents while he was away.</p>
<p>Death Goddess and Lady Chef generated their geno armor in the
cave. Han Sen and Wang Yuhang crouched in the cave and kept
watch.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen heard someone’s voice drawing near.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Having Little Uncle here really is bad luck. Dragon
Lady and Death Goddess are in the midst of generating their geno
armor. They cannot be disturbed during this process.” Han Sen
frowned as the voice drew nearer and nearer.</p>
