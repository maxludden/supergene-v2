    <p>
      &#8220;There is nothing we can do. Only Wang Yuhang can pull away the
      creature we seek. Its retrieval will be impossible if we do not have
      him.&#8221; Manager Qu continued his cold dialogue, saying, &#8220;It is
      fortunate its maturity will come soon; sometime within the next two
      days.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sun Chenggong replied, &#8220;Chen Cheng and the third team made use of
      their shura liquid. It will take a week for them to recover; I do not
      believe they will be able to accompany us any further on this
      mission.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Manager Qu nodded and said, &#8220;Have them stay in camp as back up, at
      least, just in case the need arises.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      They both went on to discuss another matter, but Han Sen couldn&#8217;t
      hear. At the very least, he now knew why they had come here. They too had
      come for the Empty Fruit.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;These people are out of their minds. Do they believe such a small
      number of people can rival the creatures and obtain the fruit? They have
      no idea how many monsters have been attracted to this place by the Empty
      Fruit!&#8221; Han Sen laughed in his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although they used the shura liquid to strengthen their bodies, its
      side-effects were extreme. Not to mention the short length of time the
      concoction boosted their bodies for. Even for the elite who used a vial,
      it was not enough to thwart and beat a super creature. If they had a lot
      more men, all of which could use the juice, then they might have had a
      chance of defeating a single super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in this place, there was sure to be far more than just a single super
      creature. Lord knew how many lurked around the Empty Fruit, hungry and
      waiting for it to ripen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having watched them face-off against the goose, Han Sen already believed
      them to be doomed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if they were still adamant in trying to obtain the fruit, he was happy
      to watch them. It was possible their intrusion could work out for the
      best, and he&#8217;d benefit from their meddling.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen went against the Devil-Blood King face-to-face, he did not
      believe himself able to compete.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, for now, Han Sen decided to leave the people be. And he also decided
      to allow Wang Yuhang to remain with them for now, too. He&#8217;d feel
      safer this way—a whole lot safer than he would if Wang Yuhang was hanging
      around him, at least.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;To make some creepy tonic such as that, I&#8217;m afraid it must be
      the work of the Zhao family or the Qi family.&#8221; Han Sen started to
      wonder, but he was leaning towards it being the Zhao family who produced
      the blood-horn shura juice.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;When this concoction becomes known to the market at large, I am
      afraid the Alliance and the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary will be in for a
      period of turmoil. Hunting in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary would not
      be as difficult, but if they could not absorb Life Geno Essences, then
      their killing of super creatures would be pointless. The best they could
      hope for would be beast souls.&#8221; Han Sen pondered the ramifications
      of such a product in the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of what could happen, it was guaranteed to cause an imbalance
      for humanity. If it was produced by the Zhao family, Han Sen feared their
      reputation would only increase and perhaps make them an unstoppable force.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I need to find a way to get my hands on that shura liquid. I need
      to do some tests and research on it myself.&#8221; Han Sen acknowledged
      its power, but he knew he&#8217;d be unable to discover much of what lay
      inside the compound by himself. If he handed it over to the Ji family,
      however, he reckoned they could do the deep-dive he could not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen remained in the area for two days, waiting for them to move. The
      garrison that left to retrieve the fruit departed towards the center of
      the island with Wang Yuhang in tow, but a few men remained in the camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen followed them from afar, and the further they went, the more he
      could begin sensing the presence of terrifying lifeforces. Han Sen
      believed they must be suicidal to blindly march forward to the center.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sensing abilities of the people that marched forward were far too low,
      and it was remarkable how unaware they were of the wretchedly powerful
      creatures that were around. They seemed to have no idea they were walking
      into what was looking to be a certifiable bloodbath.
    </p>

    <p>
      They said they needed Wang Yuhang for the purpose of attracting a certain
      creature away, and so they had treated him well enough since his return.
      He had been healed and fed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But being locked inside a cage like the latest exhibition at a zoo was
      unkind. With a grim, disheartened face, Wang Yuhang clutched the bars of
      the cage the entire time, waiting for Han Sen to spring him free and
      rescue him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued to follow the troops until they reached the center. It
      was strangely quiet there, and they did not seem to recognize the presence
      of a single creature in the area. That was because the Empty Fruit
      hadn&#8217;t matured yet—the creatures that would vie for its consumption
      were all in hiding!
    </p>

    <p>
      After walking half the day, Han Sen was finally able to gaze upon the
      splendor of the Empty Vine. It came out of a mountain like a spring,
      wreathing its slopes in green vines. And the vines coursed all the way
      around to cover the mountain&#8217;s hundred meter tall heights.
    </p>

    <p>
      A vine stuck out of the mountain&#8217;s peak, and four grape-sized fruits
      hung from it. They were all purplish in color, with shiny skin. They were
      on the precipice of becoming ripe.
    </p>

    <p>
      A pleasant fragrance was bursting forth from the four Empty Fruit, and
      their scent shrouded the entire mountainside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Near the top of the mountain, a black-feathered bird waited. It was
      entirely black, save for its white head. It didn&#8217;t look too
      dissimilar to an owl, but it was far bigger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Manager Qu commanded his people to fire at it. With the arrows incoming,
      the owl flapped its wings and waved them all away. Not a single arrow
      reached its target.
    </p>

    <p>
      It didn&#8217;t leave the mountain, though. It remained where it had been,
      seemingly not wanting to leave the Empty Fruit for a single moment. It was
      teetering on the brink of being ripe, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Manager Qu employed many different ideas to evict the owl from its spot,
      but none of them worked. Unable to shoo it off, they brought Wang Yuhang
      out of his cage and sent him up to draw the owl away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang nervously approached the creature against his will. He rambled
      across the vines, and when in firing distance, shot an arrow at the owl.
    </p>

    <p>
      The arrow, after hitting the owl, incited no reaction. The arrow merely
      shattered upon hitting the owl&#8217;s wing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone anxiously watched the owl, still expecting it to do something.
      But nothing occurred, and the owl did not seem to care. Manager Qu shouted
      at Wang Yuhang, &#8220;Fire at the creature again!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang turned around and saw the countless arrows and pointy weapons
      drawn and aimed towards him. Realizing the futility of resistance at a
      time like this, he had no choice but to fire another arrow. After doing
      so, the owl raised its eyebrows in a manner that seemed to suggest it was
      merely holding its anger in.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Wang Yuhang fired a third arrow, the owl could no longer maintain its
      composure. It raced down towards the man who had been forced to pester it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang screamed and jumped down, scrambling down towards the people
      behind him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Manager Qu commanded his men to fire arrows at him. With no other
      choice, he was forced to run in a different direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the owl chase Wang Yuhang, the people there seemed so excited. They
      all climbed the mountain, wanting to get their hands on the four Empty
      Fruit.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They have no idea what they&#8217;re doing. Whoever places one
      finger on one of those fruits is a dead man.&#8221; Han Sen shook his
      head. Ignoring them, he ran to catch up with Wang Yuhang. His first task
      involved keeping him alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to stay away from the bloody battle that was sure to unfold
      near the Empty Vine.
