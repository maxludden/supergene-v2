  “Brother Han, are you really confident in this?” Yu Jing asked, staring at Han Sen.

“Yes,” Han Sen answered with certainty.

Yu Jing hesitated. He gritted his teeth, grabbed Han Sen’s hands, and said, “Brother Han, I place my life in these hands of yours. You have to be careful and see my safety is secured.”

“Go. I will have Spell fire when the time is right.” Han Sen patted Yu Jing on the shoulder and smiled.

Yu Jing ran towards the jade fruit tree. Before he could get close, ants began to pour out from under the rock. It was like a black river headed for him.

Yu Jing quickly came running back as Han Sen commanded Spell to ready a rocket. Then, she fired behind the man. Boom!

The white light exploded behind Yu Jing. It killed a lot of Jade Ants. Announcements kept running in Han Sen’s head, declaring he had killed a Viscount Jade Ant. He also heard himself receive a bunch of beast souls.

Han Sen had battled ants before, and he had always received armor beast souls. But these Jade Ants only gave him pet- type beast souls. That disappointed him quite a bit.

That was because pet-type beast souls were annoying. If you wanted to use them effectively, you’d have to get them to combat mode. He had found himself in possession of many low-tier pets in the past.

Jade Ants could spit corrosive gas, but the range was short and the gas was slow. Before the ants could get to Han Sen, Spell had fired two rockets and laid waste to them.

Suddenly, a few gold shadows emerged from the stone nest. These ants were twice as big as the ordinary ones. They had wings, and they glimmered with a golden light.

They flew straight at Yu Jing like shadows.

“Brother Han, help me!” Yu Jing shouted at Han Sen as he ran.

Seeing that seven or eight Earl class Jade Ants were about to catch up with Yu Jing, Han Sen realized that Spell’s rockets were going to be too slow. She had killed many Viscount ants, but more and more of them were approaching.

“Spell!” Han Sen took control of her, ditching the rocket launcher and pulling out the sniper rifle.

Spell lifted the sniper, aimed it above Yu Jing’s head, and pulled the trigger. A bullet of light was fired, and it struck one of the Earl ants.

That power tore through the ant’s wing and perforated its shell. It fell from the air.

“Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Jade Ant: xenogeneic gene found.”

The announcement played in Han Sen’s head. Yu Jing was approaching excitedly, saying, “Shit, Brother Han! Your geno armament is strong. Hurry! Fire a few more shots and finish them all off.”

One second later, Spell raised the rifle again and fired. Unfortunately, she missed this time. She failed to hit the Earl Jade Ant that was flying quickly towards her.

Yu Jing’s excited voice turned to one of crying. “Brother, can you aim better?”

Seeing Yu Jing draw even closer, Spell swapped her sniper for a pair of pistols. Then, she fired them into the sky.

A series of shots were heard. She missed a few times, but she still managed to hit two Earl Jade Ants. The pistols were not as powerful as the sniper, though, and the bullets only punched holes in the shells of the creatures. They didn’t kill the ants.

“Spell!” Han Sen shouted. Spell ran towards Han Sen and turned into a pair of pistols that flew into Han Sen’s own hands.

Han Sen’s left and right hands clutched the Spell pistols. He fired them into the sky simultaneously. Each bullet came launching out with a stunning muzzle flash.

And again, there was a pang pang noise. Han Sen fired seven bullets, and all seven hit their desired target. Seven Earl ants were hit.

Han Sen’s bullets were as strong as Spell’s. The only difference was that Spell’s bullets were fueled by the raw power of The Story of Genes, while Han Sen could create bullets from any geno art he possessed.

After the seventh shot, the seven Earl Jade Ants each had a bullet hole inside them. The wounds were not deadly, though, and the ants could still fight.

But they spiraled like planes losing control. They crashed into the ground and could not get airborne again. Small turtle symbols were glazed across each of them.

Han Sen’s bullets were now powered by Turtle. It stopped the ants from flying, and it reduced their speed.

Han Sen kept firing his guns at the Earl ants on the floor. Their shells splintered and broke as their bodies oozed blood. Han Sen killed one ant immediately.

“Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Jade Ant: xenogeneic gene found.”

“Shoot them! Shoot them!” Yu Jing shouted with excitement.

The Earl Jade Ants had been robbed of their ability to fly, and they were slowed dramatically. They were no longer a threat to Yu Jing.

Han Sen fell back, repeatedly squeezing the triggers. The joy of firing a gun was incomparable to the wielding of a knife.

Han Sen killed another Earl Jade Ant, and then there was a noise. A pure black ant flew out from under the stone, with a shell that was wreathed in golden symbols.

This ant was smaller than the Earls, but its presence was far scarier. It flapped its wings and flew towards Han Sen. Its claws were like blades, and they came swinging towards him.

The gold light came past Han Sen like a knifelight.

Han Sen moved and evaded the gold lights. Han Sen then fired his guns, but the Jade Ant Queen was too fast. It was able to dodge every bullet.

The ant queen rose into the air, shrieking. The gold symbols on the shell and wings glowed. Its speed and power were increasing, and it was going to attack Han Sen again.

“Run! This mutant ant queen is as strong as a Marquise. We cannot fight it!” Before Yu Jing could finish his warning,

Han Sen had drawn another weapon and gone running towards the ant queen.

The bullets could not catch up with the ant queen, but the rabbit shoes could. Han Sen rushed by the gold lights and used the Ghost Teeth Knife on the ant queen, breaking its shell and leaving a big mark on it. Blood came out, as did a plume of purple smoke.
