<p>But after another half hour, Han Sen still hadn’t emerged from
the Good Fortune Pool. Now, even Li Chun Qiu’s face looked
stunned.</p>
<p>“It has been an hour, and he still isn’t out yet… This should be
what a primitive deified can achieve, right?” Shale said with
shock.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu nodded and said, “According to our best theory,
half-deifieds can only last half an hour at the most. Unless they
manage to trigger a vision, that is. Then, they can last more than
an hour. A primitive deified can last one hour…” Li Chun Qiu
trailed off. He was wondering why Han Sen was taking so long, and
why he had yet to come out.</p>
<p>Little did they knew, Han Sen himself was just as confused as
they were. He had already consumed more power than his body had
previously contained, but he wasn’t stopping there. He felt like he
could still absorb more and more. It was like his nervous system
was impaired, and he didn’t know when to feel full.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Deified gene +1. Deified progress: 30/100”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suddenly, a voice sounded inside Han Sen’s ears. It shocked him.
When he heard what it said, he was so happy.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! The water inside the Good Fortune Pool can increase
my tally of deified genes. Is it just like the Very High predicted?
Are these waters here because the deified genes melded with the
water itself…” Han Sen was floored. It had been so long since he
had earned a deified gene. He couldn’t believe he could get them
here.</p>
<p>Han Sen had tried to consume deified genes before, but he hadn’t
been able to digest them. These mutated deified genes, however,
were being absorbed without issue.</p>
<p>Right now, Han Sen didn’t care how long he had to stay
underwater. This was a fantastic opportunity, so he wasn’t going to
stop until he was stuffed to the gills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Deified gene +1. Deified progress: 40/100…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not long later, Han Sen’s brain played a similar
announcement.</p>
<p>After hearing the announcement again, Han Sen tried even harder
to absorb the power of the Good Fortune Water. His body was sinking
lower, driving him deeper and deeper into the pool. And the further
he went, the stronger the gene power became.</p>
<p>Han Sen floated inside the Good Fortune Pool, continuing to
absorb what he could. Shale and Li Chun Qiu were still on the
outside, looking pretty freaked out. They had been waiting for two
hours by this point, and they saw no sign of Han Sen coming back to
the surface.</p>
<p>That itself was a big problem. Shale was a deified when he
entered the Good Fortune Pool, and he had even triggered a vision,
but he only lasted two hours.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen had been in there almost as long as Shale, and he
yet to show a sign of coming back out. This was so strange.</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s body should still be half-deified. He must have taken
in so much gene power. Even if it was all somehow beneficial for
him, it should have filled his body to overflowing by now. How can
he still be down there?” Shale asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu looked into the water but didn’t speak. He was
trying to guess what might have happened to Han Sen. He considered
many possibilities, but he didn’t think any of them made sense. In
short, unless Han Sen had become deified, the Good Fortune Pool’s
gene power should have blown him up by now.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was becoming deified inside the Good Fortune Pool,
there should have been a big movement on the surface to let them
know what had happened. They would have noticed something like
that. The pool shouldn’t have been as quiet as it was right
now.</p>
<p>But it didn’t seem possible that Han Sen was dying down there,
either. Creatures had died in the pool before, overloaded by the
power that they had taken in. But as they died, their powers would
explode rather violently. Shale and Li Chun Qiu would sense it if
that happened.</p>
<p>“What is he doing under there?” Li Chun Qiu couldn’t contain his
curiosity. Although he was in charge of the Good Fortune Pool, he
couldn’t just hop in and check.</p>
<p>The Good Fortune Pool had incredible gene powers, but the
ingredients that composed it were too complicated. Once someone
reached the maximum level of harmful gene powers they could
tolerate and left the pool, they could begin to slowly purge those
destructive powers. However, their core genes would be forever
affected. They would live with side effects from then on.</p>
<p>These side effects didn’t affect one’s body and practice, but if
that person wanted to enter the Good Fortune Pool again, the rate
at which they accumulated harmful gene powers would be greatly
increased. Entering the water again could be very dangerous for
them.</p>
<p>So, ordinary people could only earn benefits the first time they
entered the Good Fortune Pool. Entering the Good Fortune Pool again
would make these side effects get worse. After a few times, most
people couldn’t even touch the water anymore.</p>
<p>That was the situation that Li Chun Qiu found himself in. He
wanted to dive into the pool and take a look, but he simply
couldn’t.</p>
<p>Shale had only just entered the Good Fortune Pool, so he
couldn’t go in again either. The two of them had no choice but to
watch from the edge of the pool. They hoped that Han Sen would come
back out, so they could learn what he had managed to accomplish
down there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Deified gene +1. Deified progress: 56/100”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen was still frantically pulling in the gene powers of the
Good Fortune Water. His deified progress was moving steadily
forward.</p>
<p>“Am I going to become deified?” Han Sen was so excited. If he
could become deified here, then in the eyes of the universe, he
would have the basic authority to start his own race. That meant he
could represent humans and start a war for a lantern in the Geno
Hall. Humans could become a high race.</p>
<p>Fighting the Extreme King or a big race like the Sky wouldn’t be
realistic. He would have to find some higher races that only had a
couple deifieds, or maybe none at all. If that happened, Han Sen
would be confident in his ability to pick on them.</p>
<p>Of course, every high race had connections. He couldn’t just
start a war with whoever he wanted. Just like the Rebate. If anyone
tried to start a lantern war with them, they would have to think
about how Sky Palace would react.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried about it too much, though. He just had to
find a high race that was allied with the Extreme King, and then
snuff out their lantern. There was no love lost between him and the
Extreme King anyway, so battling them was going to happen some day
regardless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Deified gene +1. Deified progress: 98/100”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As time went by, Han Sen’s deified progress went higher and
higher. Han Sen could feel the power collecting inside of him.
There were changes occurring in his body that felt like they could
flip the sky and the earth.</p>
<p>These changes weren’t connected to any of his four geno arts. It
was his body itself that was changing. It was a process that he
couldn’t have begun to describe. His flesh, his bones, his organs,
and every cell in his body was changing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Deified gene +1. Deified progress: 100/100… God body
evolving…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When his deified progress reached 100, Han Sen felt like his
body was a flower, and the petals were falling away one by one. He
felt like a serpent, peeling off its skin. The feeling was beyond
anything that Han Sen had previously imagined, and although it was
incredibly strange, it also felt amazingly good.</p>
