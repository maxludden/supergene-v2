<h2>Galactic Shrimp</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2211</h3>

<p>The fight was worse than they had anticipated. The ships
possessed tremendous power, and they could probably have
obliterated entire planets with ease. Stopping the assault of those
scary Galactic Shrimp was beyond their capabilities, though.</p>
<p>A giant lobster would occasionally appear amongst the hordes of
smaller shrimp. The lobsters had a frightening enough presence to
suggest that they were King class.</p>
<p>Han Sen spotted two of the King class lobsters coming toward
them, but the weapons that could destroy planets didn’t have enough
power to punch through the shells of those lobster Kings.</p>
<p>The heavy guns spat round after round at the incoming Galactic
Lobsters, but even so, they didn’t even slow the monsters down. One
of the creatures raised pincers that flashed blue cut off a huge
chunk of the ship.</p>
<p>“Aside from the operator of the ship, every King and Duke knight
follow me!” Ice Blue Knight King said, then jumped out of the ship
through a portal.</p>
<p>Many of the Ice Blue Knights followed Ice Blue Knight King, and
then an ice blue knife light cut a blinding mark right through the
fabric of space. Countless Galactic Shrimp were killed.</p>
<p>The group of Ice Blue Knights, including Night River King, moved
in front of the ship. They were going to cut a path for the ships
to escape through.</p>
<p>Night River King hated Han Sen more than ever right then. If it
wasn’t for Han Sen, he would have been enjoying his life in Narrow
Moon as a lofty King. He wouldn’t have been doing any fighting.</p>
<p>Thinking of this hate, Night River King used his mind to project
images of Han Sen onto all of the Galactic Shrimp near him. And as
he lifted two teeth-like moon wheel knives, a black water wheel was
sent spinning out to kill many of those Galactic Shrimp.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The black water wheel hit a lobster’s shell, sending a shower of
blue sparks into the night sky. In response, the King Lobster moved
its pincer and sliced the black water wheel in two. Then, it flew
towards Night River King like a blue missile.</p>
<p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p>Blood was everywhere. Bits and pieces of bodies were scattered
all over the place. The ship was moving slowly under the cover
provided by the Ice Blue Knights, but even still, the ship was hit
more than a few times. Each whack caused many more explosions.</p>
<p>Huge bursts of energy exploded through space in all the colors
of the rainbow. Each burst was like a sun, consuming many
lives.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a great level of excitement as he watched it all
unfold from the comfort of the ship. He thought to himself, “This
is what war is really like.”</p>
<p>“Mister White, can I join the fight?” Han Sen asked Mister
White.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t kill for the fun of it, but he was watching the
Galactic Shrimp die in droves. He didn’t want to miss the
spoils.</p>
<p>At the very least, the Galactic Shrimp were Marquise. And a
great number of them were Dukes. And on top of that, there were
King class Galactic Lobsters. If he could get the final hit on one,
he might have the opportunity to claim its beast soul.</p>
<p>Crime hadn’t yet grown accustomed to Han Sen’s strange attitude
towards things, and so he coldly said, “You are Mister White’s
personal guard. Your task is to protect him. You are just a
Marquise, and if you go out there, you will only cause
trouble.”</p>
<p>Mister White smiled and said, “Han Sen might be here bearing
that title, yes, but he isn’t solely a guard. If he wants to go out
there, he has my permission. But if you do go, please be careful
and perform your best.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. You guys protect Mister White in the meantime.”
Han Sen directed the command at Zero and Little Angel.</p>
<p>Without saying another word, Han Sen exited the ship. In his
heart, he shouted, “Beast soul baby, big brother is on his
way!”</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his dragon wings on his back and ears. His body
was petrified through the Dongxuan Aura. He scanned the entire
fight, then flew towards Ice Blue Knight King.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t think he could fend off a swathe of Galactic
Shrimp by himself, and so he knew he would have to stay next to Ice
Blue Knight King to take advantage of the best opportunities. He
was going to attack the injured Galactic Shrimp, and by finishing
them off, he hoped that he’d receive a goodie or two.</p>
<p>Amidst that messy fight, Han Sen employed the Dongxuan Sutra,
Heavenly Go, and Under the Sky knife skills liberally. They made
for a useful trio in that scenario. They enabled him to see through
the weave of the fight. They also allowed him to identify the
safest spots to occupy in the middle of the battlefield. That way,
he wouldn’t be in too much danger.</p>
<p>Crime was very surprised when Mister White allowed Han Sen to
exit the ship and join in the fight. Marquises were just backup for
the Ice Blue Knights, usually. If nothing out of the ordinary was
happening, they wouldn’t be allowed to join any fights that came
up.</p>
<p>A proper Ice Blue Knight was required to be a Duke.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was having good luck. After getting to Ice Blue
Knight King safely, Han Sen killed a shrimp that had slipped behind
them without getting attacked.</p>
<p>As he went, Han Sen kept trying to predict how the battle would
unfold. He readied himself to rack up some kills.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise Galactic Shrimp killed. Xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed and killed a Galactic Shrimp. The blue,
fluorescent blood sprayed all over him. In no time at all, he had
managed to kill thirty of them. Not a single one had given him a
beast soul, though. He didn’t have the time to pick up the
xenogeneic genes, either. He had to keep going, killing as he
went.</p>
<p>There were too many Galactic Shrimp, and Han Sen had to keep
teleporting to reorient himself and fix his location. He moved
continually between safe spots to give himself some breathing room,
but staying away from the bulk of the Galactic Shrimp required him
to kill a fair number of them, too.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King’s fight was too dangerous to get very close
to, from what Han Sen could see. He saw Ice Blue Knight King slay a
King class Galactic Lobster in a flash. Han Sen was unable to get
there in time, which made him feel depressed.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept fighting and looking around as he went. He found
Night River King engaged with a King class Galactic Lobster. Their
fight was a nasty one, for sure.</p>
<p>Night River King held two knives as he used the Night River
Beast’s special techniques against the lobster. They ground the
lobster’s shell open, revealing the blue meat on the inside. It
looked as if the King class Galactic Lobster wasn’t strong enough
to repel him.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept fighting, and as he did, he approached Night River
King.</p>
<p>“Night River King is evil! This old man is fighting the King
class Galactic Lobster, but he stays someplace safe where he won’t
be attacked by shrimp. It looks like he’s decided that fighting the
lobsters, while dangerous, is a safer bet than tangling with all
the shrimp. But because of that, he has given me a chance.” Han Sen
slowly drew closer to Night River King.</p>
<p>This was no time to attack Night River King. If the Ice Blue
Knights found out what he had done, it would be labeled a
crime.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s target was the Galactic Lobster that was engaged with
Night River King. He wanted to take advantage of its distraction
and injuries.</p>
<p>The guns fired their energy bolts, resulting in an array of
explosions erupting all over the place. The capital ship looked
like it was in the middle of a rainbow. And beneath those colors
was the unchecked carnage of battle. Countless lives were being
consumed. It really wasn’t fair.</p>
