Han Sen lifted his knife. There was no shiny knifelight, no spiritual glow, but the knifemind was so scary. It felt like a beast that had come to swallow the sky. It could not be avoided, and even space above would find itself fractured.

Although it was a wrong feeling, it shocked everyone with awe. It was a feeling they couldn’t escape.

Katcha!

Han Sen slashed towards the Tego Earl. He cut through his foe’s armor and drew a deep cut across his chest. His Teeth power was buffed by his knifemind, and a purple mist began to envelop the wound, tearing it wider.

Sword Know’s meteor-like swordlight and another Earl’s spear came striking at the same time. Han Sen did not move, though. His Ghost Teeth Knife began whirling up another spiral. He caught the swordlight inside the circle, and then he threw it towards Rebecca to slow her down.

At the same time, Han Sen’s left hand grabbed the red mist spring water. He put it in his mouth and swallowed it.

All these actions were performed in one uninterrupted sequence. It looked simple and smooth. So many Earls were attacking Han Sen, but he made it look like he was shooing off a bunch of kids.

“What the hell?” Flower King’s eyes were open wide as he stared at Han Sen.

Han Sen didn’t just generate a normal Teeth Knife knifemind. His knifemind was growing quickly, becoming something greater than usual. Even Flower King, who had lived for a thousand years, had not seen anything like this before.

Moon Wheel King and Night River King looked at Han Sen, but remained speechless.

Three months of a major gambit had been reduced to a joke. Han Sen had only taken one and a half months to develop a terrifying knifemind. The most talented Dukes had taken several years to make a remotely similar amount of progress.

Yisha’s eyes looked bright as she watched. What she was thinking, though, you could not tell.

Katcha!

Han Sen cut Sword Know’s arm off as he grabbed another glob of spring water and shoved it into his mouth.

Everything was so seamless. If Sword Know and the others weren’t the ones being subjected to this treatment, they’d undoubtedly have praised the marvelous performance. All they could feel now, though, was shock.

It was unbelievable for a Baron to use sword skills like that, even if he was being slightly buffed by the treasures he used.

Han Sen kept on fighting, swallowing the orbs of spring water as he went. He had consumed at least ten of them, and he used Yin Yang Change to convert them into power. His energy and Spell armor began to turn red and give off a strange mist. He looked so very weird.

Rebecca and the others did not want to retreat in such a state. They used all the power they could muster to fight Han Sen, but it meant naught. They still couldn’t keep up, and they hadn’t been able to claim a single drop of water for themselves. Han Sen had taken them all.

The storage capacity of that particular red mist spring was beyond anyone’s wildest expectations. It was still releasing spring water.

“Huh, so what? Even if he does have tremendous skill, he has swallowed at least one hundred red mist spring water drops. Even if he was a bug, he should have been able to become a Viscount a few times over by now, but he hasn’t yet leveled up. How does he expect to level up? I don’t even think this guy will even be able to become a Duke,” Night River King said, as he coldly looked upon Han Sen.

Black-Moon King sighed. He greatly favored Han Sen, but what Night River King said was true. Even a minuscule insect should have become a Viscount by now, but Han Sen had not. His ascendance required far too many resources.

If it was that difficult for him to become a Viscount, it would be even harder for him to level up and hit loftier tiers. Even if Yisha was willing to keep growing him, the chances of Han Sen ever becoming a King were super low.

“It is a shame. To have such talent and yet be shackled with a geno art and body such as that.” Moon Wheel King sighed. He felt very sorry for the lad.

Flower King looked at Han Sen with admiration. He sighed and said, “It does not matter how good his skills are; if he cannot attain a higher level, it is all for naught. Thirteen spring water drops could create ten Viscounts. And yet, he has not leveled up. I don’t think he will ever be a King.”

The red mist inside Han Sen’s body was getting thicker and thicker, and it was as if it was getting hacked at by blades. But his Spell armor remained quiet, and it wasn’t releasing any energy at all.

Han Sen kept fighting and drinking all the water he could grab. The spring continued to erupt and supply him with drops. Everyone thought each glob of water would be the last, but their expectations were shattered by the emergence of another—each and every time.

When Han Sen had swallowed seventeen or eighteen globs, the spring’s eye began throwing out even more water.

“How many xenogeneics were killed here in ancient times to produce such a large quantity of water beneath the surface?” Black-Moon King said in wonder.

Night River King’s eyebrows kept on twitching. Han Sen had swallowed so much spring water, and he found himself having difficulty holding back. He had thought the spring water would have emptied by now, so he had held himself back each time.

But every time he thought of that, more water came out. Right now, the twentieth glob of spring water was emerging.

Night River King was now full of regret. He regretted not making a move of his own any sooner. He could have grabbed at least ten water drops. Now, all of the spring water was inside Han Sen’s belly, and he could not even produce a fart. It was a waste of a rare material.

When the spring erupted again, Night River King finally couldn’t keep himself restrained. He did not care if there was any more spring water coming or not; he was going to make a move. If he didn’t, he believed his heart would be buried by dust—and that would affect his training.

Moon Wheel King and the others were shocked. If a red mist spring produced one hundred water drops, it was considered very large. This spring had produced almost two hundred, and it was still going.

The scariest thing was that Han Sen had swallowed so much of that water, and yet he had not become a Viscount.

Sword Know’s eyebrows jumped, as if he had just heard something. His face changed, but he decided to spit out some blood and jump towards Han Sen like a bloody arrow.

Han Sen slashed towards the blood arrow and cut it open. But inside the blood arrow was a red bug which continued flying towards Han Sen. It was so small and so fast that it hit Han Sen’s forehead, even with his Spell helmet on.

As this occurred, the spring’s eye was shining bright. A red light came out of the red spring, but this time, it was not water. It was a red soul.

“The red mist soul!” All the Kings screamed.

But before they could do anything, Han Sen grabbed the soul and swallowed it.
