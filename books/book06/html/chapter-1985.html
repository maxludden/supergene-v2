<h2>Lone Bamboo</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1985</h3>

<p>“Why would this happen? Why would Lone Bamboo take part in the
exam? He doesn’t need to.” Yu Jing did not understand how he could
be so unlucky. If it was any other Earl student, he believed Han
Sen stood a firm chance. He would have had a high probability of
winning.</p>
<p>But Lone Bamboo made Yu Jing feel powerless and hopeless.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo was a student of the seventh elder, but he had
broken a rule. It was a very bad one to break, too. He was stripped
of his title as a student and imprisoned. There, he was
tortured.</p>
<p>His imprisonment was not a death sentence, but it might as well
have been on one.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo was put in a sad dream. That dream kept repeating
his sad life for ten thousand years. Once that time passed, he was
allowed to wake up.</p>
<p>Ordinary creatures wouldn’t live long enough to wake up and have
the dreams end. Even if they did, having the same heartbreaking
dream repeat for ten millennia would be too much. They’d be driven
insane by the repetition.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo slept in jail for ten years before waking up. After
he woke up, he went up to Sky Palace and knelt before it. Then, the
doors opened. The leader had not accepted a student for one
thousand years, but he decided to accept Lone Bamboo. Then, his
cheating life started. He practiced with the Textless Book, and he
was able to go to the five cities and twelve buildings. No one was
as good as him.</p>
<p>Even Thousand Feather Crane, who received the holy gourd’s
blessing, still lost against him. And he lost even after using his
best sword skills.</p>
<p>After that, no one fought against Lone Bamboo. Marquises and
Dukes would not underestimate him, either. No one could imagine how
he had managed to wake up after only ten years. But even so, it was
difficult to imagine what he might have been through.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace said Lone Bamboo could become deified.
He did not express any doubt about the possibility, and so he
obviously had faith in him.</p>
<p>If the word strong was used to describe a student of Sky Palace,
people would not think of the elders. Instead, they’d think of Lone
Bamboo.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo still wasn’t a Marquise yet, but he never took part
in the exams. Even the Marquise class students could not interest
him. He had no interest in fighting them.</p>
<p>Yu Jing looked shocked and bitter. He felt unlucky. He thought
he could get rich, but now he was going to be bankrupt. The
students had not seen Lone Bamboo fight for the past few years, so
no one had expected him to suddenly join the exam.</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed on Old Night Island for six days. He killed
eleven Earl xenogeneics. But White Jade Jing was almost ready to
open, so he left the island and went there. When he arrived on the
island, Han Sen took a good look at the White Jade Building. After
doing so, he was shocked.</p>
<p>He thought he’d only be able to see the one White Jade Building,
but now, there were twelve such constructs on the island. At the
end of the buildings, between the clouds, were cities. He could not
see what resided in them, but he could most certainly see the five
cities.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not as clueless as he had been when he first arrived
there. He understood much about the White Jade Jing now.</p>
<p>Normal Sky Palace students could see seven White Jade
Buildings—assuming they understood a bit about it all. If they
could see ten, they’d be regarded as geniuses.</p>
<p>If they could see twelve, they’d be the smartest of the entire
generation. If they could see all the buildings, that was something
that only occurred once every ten thousand years.</p>
<p>Sky Palace had existed for a billion years, and fewer than one
hundred had seen all five cities. That was how profound this
was.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t feel anything, though. He did not know how he
could see twelve buildings and five cities. He was quite confused.
But when he practiced in the White Jade Building’s seventh floor,
he understood something when the Jade Air turned pure.</p>
<p>Although he could see twelve buildings, he was still planning on
going to the first building to absorb the Jade Air. That place was
perfect for an Earl, he believed. He planned to bring Jadeskin up
to Earl before exploring the buildings beyond.</p>
<p>When Han Sen reached the fourth floor, Yun Suyi came straight to
him to talk. She looked worried.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! My sister and Uncle Crane are waiting for you on the
seventh floor. They wanted me to tell you that, if you came, you
should go and see them. Even if you aren’t planning on practicing
on the seventh floor, go and see them.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen asked with confusion.</p>
<p>“The Jade Air is going to start, so go to the seventh floor!
When it ends, Brother Crane will tell you the details,” Yun Suyi
said.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Han Sen nodded and went straight up to the seventh
floor.</p>
<p>When Han Sen disappeared up the stairs, Yun Suyi sighed and
thought to herself, “God is being unfair. Why would you have to
meet Lone Bamboo? What is Lone Bamboo thinking? What is the point
of him joining the exam?”</p>
<p>But quickly, Yun Suyi thought, “But maybe that’s okay! It’s the
thought that counts. It does not matter if you don’t reach first
place to get Under the Sky. I won’t think any less of you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen reached the seventh floor, and there, he saw Thousand
Feather Crane, Yun Sushang, and First Day. The arrogant young man
was not there on this day, though.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen there, Thousand Feather Crane invited him over.
He asked, “Are you joining the exam?”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and said, “I signed up. I’m planning on
joining.”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane had a wry smile, and he said, “I’m afraid
you will have a tough fight ahead of you.”</p>
<p>“What is it? Is someone big joining?” Han Sen asked with a
smile.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane told him that Lone Bamboo was taking
part, and then he explained Lone Bamboo’s story. He also told Han
Sen about the time he was beaten by Lone Bamboo. He didn’t hide
anything.</p>
<p>But the way he said it was different than the way you would
describe an ordinary student. Thousand Feather Crane talked about
Lone Bamboo as if his strength was already legendary.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you won’t believe all this, but when I fought Lone
Bamboo, I felt as if I was going to lose by just standing in front
of him. When I fought him for a while, it felt as if he was
teaching me something. After that fight, my sword skills improved.
And I was able to achieve what I have up to this point,” Thousand
Feather Crane said.</p>
