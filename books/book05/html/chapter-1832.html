<h2>Evil Knife</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1832</h3>

<p>The scimitar was activated. It didn’t roar like Dragon’s Back
did. There was not even a wheeze. There was no light shining into
the sky; all that could be seen was a dark purple aura.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Everyone’s knives leaped out of their scabbards at about
half-length, and they all rattled and shook.</p>
<p>It didn’t feel as if the knives were responding to Han Sen out
of respect; it was as if the knives were all alarmed. They were
like dogs, jerking to their feet to scan the area out of fear of
something dangerous. It was instinct.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>The knife on Black-Moon King’s belt was halfway out of its
sheath, and then, it suddenly made a cruel noise. It was the sound
a beast might make when encountering another that was encroaching
on its turf.</p>
<p>Soon after, Black-Moon King’s knife was not doing that solo. The
knives of the other Kings started to appear hostile, too, as they
all looked at Han Sen’s new blade.</p>
<p>The blades didn’t appear afraid; instead, they just looked very
hostile.</p>
<p>Many Nobles were shocked by this. They looked at Black-Moon
King, because he knew more of the knives than any other Rebate.
Black-Moon King fondled his knife, and eventually it calmed down
and retreated into its scabbard. Then, he told Han Sen, “It’s okay.
But put your knife away now.”</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled back the power he had put into the knife to
activate it. He was still holding his knife, though, because he had
no scabbard for it.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King looked at the scimitar and slowly said, “This is
a King class weapon, but it is too brutal. I am afraid bad things
might occur if you were to use it Be careful in your handling of
this.”</p>
<p>When people heard that this was a King class weapon, they were
shocked. Two people had found a King class weapon this time.</p>
<p>The other Barons that had left Knife Grave earlier looked at
them jealously. The luckiest amongst those was a Marquis. No one
else had managed to even get a Duke class knife. Han Sen and Black
Steel had drawn out two King class weapons, and the others were
pretty sore about it.</p>
<p>“My King, why would you regard this as unlucky?” Han Sen asked.
He believed in these sorts of superstitions.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t believed in this sort of thing originally, but
after meeting Wang Yuhang and Cheap Sheep, his opinions had
certainly changed.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King quietly said, “This knife is a murder weapon. It
has a murderous presence. If it was an ordinary knife, it all
depends on how the master uses it. But this knife has too much of
an evil aura of its own. If someone tries to use it, and fails to
command that evil spirit, they will be infected and consumed by its
nature. The wielder might be drawn to doing unusual things.”</p>
<p>“By the way, what will you name the blade?” Black-Moon King
asked.</p>
<p>“Its name is Ghost Teeth.” When Han Sen activated the knife, a
mind or presence came from the blade, telling him its name.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King nodded and said, “If you can activate its power
and learn its name, that means you have been approved. Perhaps its
evil will have less of an effect on you.”</p>
<p>Yisha and Moon-Wheel King were both looking at Han Sen’s Ghost
Teeth knife.</p>
<p>Moon-Wheel King frowned and spoke to himself. “That is an evil
knife. I’m not sure if it’ll be a good or bad thing for us, in the
long run.”</p>
<p>Yisha frowned, as well. She had studied Teeth Knife, and she
could feel that Ghost Teeth had a connection or matching with Teeth
Knife. If Han Sen used Ghost Teeth with Teeth Knife, the power
would be stronger than if he was to use another knife. It should
have been a good thing, for Han Sen to have this knife.</p>
<p>But that knife itself certainly felt too evil. Han Sen’s level
was too low for it, and she was afraid that Han Sen might not be
able to handle the evil power.</p>
<p>There was something else that was worrying her, too. She had
taught Han Sen Teeth Knight, but Teeth Knife was a private skill of
the Rebate. It was created by a Rebate elder, after all. It was
perfect for the body of a Rebate, but even so, not many of the
Rebate were able to practice it well-enough to command its true
power.</p>
<p>Han Sen was an outsider, and while it wasn’t hard to learn an
ordinary skill, operating Teeth powers should have been close to
impossible for him.</p>
<p>Without Teeth power to suppress that knife, the evilness would
undoubtedly grow stronger. It was difficult to say how it might
ultimately affect Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard Moon-Wheel King speak, and he looked at the Ghost
Teeth knife and noticed nothing evil about it himself.</p>
<p>“Why do you have a knife on your back?” Black-Moon King saw the
Knife Blank on Han Sen’s back. He could only see a part of it, but
he assumed it was a knife.</p>
<p>When Black-Moon King said that, everyone was shocked. Everyone
knew you could only bring one knife out. If you tried to bring two,
you wouldn’t be allowed out of the tunnel. But there Han Sen was,
with two.</p>
<p>At the same time, everyone craned their necks to get a glimpse
of the Knife Blank on his back.</p>
<p>“It’s not a knife. It’s a Knife Blank,” Han Sen said, pulling it
out and holding it in his hands.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. It was a Knife Blank shaped like a steel
rod. It was not a knife, and they had never heard of something like
this before.</p>
<p>People usually brought out simple knives when coming out of
Knife Grave. They hadn’t seen a Knife Blank before.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t count as a knife? Is that why it was able to exit,
as well?”</p>
<p>“What is that thing for? Planet Knife Grave’s knives have a life
of their own… You can’t reforge that.”</p>
<p>“The Black family used to repair broken weaponry, but they
didn’t work successfully. And knives that had a life, would lose it
by the time their work was finished. They would end up like normal
knives.”</p>
<p>“If it is a Knife Blank, it can become a knife, right?”</p>
<p>A duke that was a friend of Black-Moon King said, “My King, do
you think this thing can be forged into a knife?”</p>
<p>Black-Moon King looked at the knife and did not answer him. He
looked glum and spoke to Han Sen. “Let me take a look at this Knife
Blank.”</p>
<p>Han Sen passed it to him without hesitation. Black-Moon King
looked serious as he took the knife. He inspected every inch of it,
looking very concerned.</p>
<p>Other Nobles could see this was strange. They all held their
breaths, seeing Black-Moon keenly inspect the Knife Blank. They
wondered what he could see in it.</p>
