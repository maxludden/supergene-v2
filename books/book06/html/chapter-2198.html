<p>This was the first time Han Sen had been able to see Huangfu Jing’s super god body up-close. Although her level was low, her teleportation skill was still a league better than his own Break Space Flash.</p>

<p>Break Space Flash only let him move in a direct line. It appeared as if Huangfu Jing’s teleportation ability had no such limitations. She could appear at any location she wished to. And when she used her geno art attacks, her powers teleported along with them. It was quite sick.</p>

<p>Luckily, Huangfu Jing’s level was still low. The teleportation ranges were quite low. If they were any bigger, it’d be something quite frightening.</p>

<p>“It was a Marquise of a lesser race. It’s no big deal,” Huangfu Jing said simply.</p>

<p>If someone had said that, they would have been bragging. But Huangfu Jing meant exactly what she said.</p>

<p>Han Sen just shrugged without speaking. Just as Huangfu Jing said, it was an enemy of a lesser race, so the fight hadn’t really been too serious.</p>

<p>Huangfu Jing turned and silently guided Han Sen and Bao’er to the mine in which she had located the Jade Drum.</p>

<p>Because she didn’t want the Jade Drum to be found, she hadn’t hauled it around with her. She had kept it securely in the mine she had first located it in.</p>

<p>Han Sen followed her into the mine and immediately saw one of the legendary Drums.</p>

<p>But it was not the Jade Drum that met his eyes first. It was a Steel Drum protruding from the stone. It was about a foot long. It was black like steel, and it looked like a drum that you would hang around your waist.</p>

<p>A searcher had to dig a Steel Drum from the rock and then hit it. If the drum made a noise when it was struck, that would be the sign that the person had earned its approval. Then they could take the Drum away from Planet Jade Drum with them.</p>

<p>But each ticket only gave a visitor the right to take one creature out with them. So, no matter how many Drums a person found, they could only take one away with them.</p>

<p>The Steel Drum was quite common on Planet Jade Drum, so there was no need to spend time locating them. And because of this, not many people actually went looking for them.</p>

<p>Han Sen followed Huangfu Jing down a very complicated, winding mine shaft. But all they saw along the way were Steel Drums. They did not even see a single Bronze Drum. It looked as if it was a very large mine shaft dedicated exclusively to Steel Drums.</p>

<p>Normally, a Steel Drum would rarely have a Bronze Drum or Silver Drum in its general vicinity. There was even less chance of finding a rarer Drum. Huangfu Jing finding a Jade Drum there had been most fortuitous.</p>

<p>They had been walking down that complicated mine shaft for over a day when they finally found the place she had spoken about.</p>

<p>There were lots of Steel Drums along the way to that place, and rarely would they spot a Bronze Drum. It didn’t seem likely they’d find a Jade Drum there, but there was indeed a Jade Drum in the stone. The Drum looked white, and its surface was transparent. It was a very pretty thing to behold.</p>

<p>Huangfu Jing struck the Drum gently, and it responded with a booming noise. To Han Sen, that noise was like an explosion taking place inside his head.</p>

<p>And that was what it produced when she only gave it a slight tap. If all of its powers were triggered, it would likely leave Dukes bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>If they could level the thing up to King class, it could be even stronger.</p>

<p>But leveling up the Jade Drum to King class wouldn’t be an easy feat. With Huangfu Jing’s power, she would still depend heavily on the Jade Drum’s strength while exploring.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you dig it up?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“The rock around it is too hard. I spent some time trying to dig it up earlier, but I didn’t make any progress,” Huangfu Jing admitted.</p>

<p>Han Sen noticed the rocks around the Drum had been corroded by the Jade Drum. The solvent looked like ink. Han Sen pressed his hand into the stone, but he was only able to collect and remove a small amount. It was indeed very hard.</p>

<p>Han Sen drew out his Ghost Teeth Knife, though, and he dug the Drum out of the stone in a matter of minutes. He tried to tap the Drum himself, but it didn’t work. So, he had no qualms about giving it to Queen.</p>

<p>Han Sen was planning to leave the planet alongside Queen right then and there. But all of a sudden, curiosity shone in Bao’er’s eyes. She leapt off of Han Sen’s shoulders and went down a specific path. She yelled over her shoulder to Han Sen, “Dad, let’s go here!”</p>

<p>“Bao’er, what have you found?” With curiosity, Han Sen took off after her.</p>

<p>Huangfu Jing, while carrying the Jade Drum, followed after Han Sen. Bao’er was still leading, and she eventually reached a crevice and crawled into it.</p>

<p>The crevice was so small that even Bao’er had a hard time squeezing into it. Han Sen and Queen had to compress their bones to fit and squirm their way through. A little while later, Bao’er shouted and leapt towards a rock.</p>

<p>“Dad, dig here!” Bao’er pointed at a stone wall.</p>

<p>There were Steel Drums all around, so it didn’t look as if there would be anything good in the vicinity. But still, Han Sen trusted Bao’er. So, he drew out his Ghost Teeth Knife again and began hacking at the black rocks.</p>

<p>Beneath the Ghost Teeth Knife’s razor edge, the stone was like tofu. The surface of the wall came apart quickly, but his progress soon slowed a little. And the further he went, the harder it became to dig. The stone soon went from the color of steel to various jade colors. Eventually, he reached a black crystal surface. It became so difficult to dig that he began to sweat with the effort.</p>

<p>After digging seven meters, he still hadn’t found anything. But then suddenly, there was the dinging noise of his knife striking crystal. The knife hit something, and it couldn’t dig any further.</p>

<p>Han Sen chopped away the rocks all around, and before long, he found a white Jade Drum inside the wall he had been working on.</p>

<p>“A Jade Drum!” Han Sen exulted. He swung the Ghost Teeth Knife faster to fully reveal the Drum.</p>

<p>After Han Sen dug it up, he kissed Bao’er and said, “Bao’er, you are such a good daughter!”</p>

<p>If he had a Jade Drum to practice with, there was now a chance Han Sen could become King. It was like he was carrying a King class fighter with him. It was something truly awesome.</p>

<p>Bao’er blinked and looked at the broken surface of the mountain. She pointed at it and spoke again. “Dad, keep digging!”</p>

<p>“There are even more Jade Drums?” Han Sen was surprised. He followed Bao’er directions and kept on digging.</p>

<p>Usually, there couldn’t be more than one Jade Drum inside a single mine. It was similar to the way one area rarely had two predators. Even though the mine was big, there were already two Jade Drums there. It seemed incredibly unlikely for there to be a third one around.</p>

<p>But Bao’er must have had her reasons for wanting to continue, and so Han Sen kept going.</p>

<p>The rock there was even harder than what they had gone through earlier. Han Sen kept giving it his full power, but he could only peel away thin layers of the stone at a time. After half a day, the black rocks began to gleam with red light.</p>

<p>Han Sen was even happier than before. The constant digging had soaked him with sweat, but a short time later, he had hacked away enough of the black crystal. The surface of a Drum became visible.</p>

<p>It was indeed a Jade Drum, but it looked different from the usual ones. This Jade Drum was built from jade, but it had red marks across it. The mixed white and red formed a remarkable design</p>
