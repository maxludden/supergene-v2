<p>It did not just look like one. It really did come alive. The
statue’s eyes were lively, and the body turned soft. She stood up
and looked at everyone in the pavilion. Nine Thousand King watched
as the jade statue was revived. His body shook. He did not look
powerful anymore. The light of the battle armor quickly
disappeared. The eye closed tightly. There was a thud as he kneeled
in front of the revived statue. His head touched the floor. He did
not dare raise his head as he said, “Servant Number 9 is greeting
Miss Wan’er. Do you remember Number 9, Miss Wan’er?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “This old man Nine Thousand King knew Sacred
Leader’s sister was called Wan’er and he did not tell me.”</p>
<p>The statue saw Nine Thousand King, who was terrified on the
floor, shivering with fear and not daring to raise his head. She
raised the cup in her hand and drank all the wine it contained.</p>
<p>“Number 9, was that you who wanted to break the statue?” After
the statue drank the wine, it started to speak. It was not the
voice of a female like Wan’er. It was the voice of a man.</p>
<p>When Nine Thousand King heard the voice, he raised his head. He
was scared. His eyes opened wide. He looked at the statue like he
was looking at a ghost. He only took one small glimpse. Nine
Thousand King immediately slapped his own face and said, “It is my
fault. I am a bad servant. I should die.”</p>
<p>Han Sen, who was standing nearby and seeing all of this, was
frozen. Nine Thousand King was not joking. He was really slapping
himself terribly hard. His cheekbones were breaking. In just a few
slaps, he was already covered in blood. Nine Thousand King kept on
hitting himself. He kept on hitting himself hard. It was hard
enough to be considered a form of suicide.</p>
<p>The jade statue did not watch Nine Thousand King, who was in the
middle of slapping himself to death. He looked at Han Sen. It made
Han Sen feel a chill, so he secretly gathered up power. When he
heard Nine Thousand King speak after the statue came alive, he felt
as if it was embodying Sacred Leader.</p>
<p>The statue looked at Han Sen and smiled as it asked, “What is
your name?”</p>
<p>Although his body looked like Wan’er, his power was too
outstanding. One sensed that he was a very gentle man. One would
not have thought he was a woman.</p>
<p>“Crystallizer Han Sen. What is your name?” Han Sen thought that
person was not hostile, but he did not underestimate him either. He
remained in a state of caution.</p>
<p>“Name. That is a distant memory. I have almost forgotten.” The
man laughed. After a seriously long think, he said, “My name is Qin
Xiu. I am the King Kingdom’s king. Xiu means fixing the country and
keeping the peace.”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could say anything, Qin Xiu was talking to Han
Sen again. “Can you share a few cups with me?”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu sat down in the pavilion. He picked up the bottle and
poured two cups of wine. He raised one of them.</p>
<p>“If you do not mind, I am willing to join you.” Han Sen spoke as
he walked into the pavilion. He sat down next to him. He raised the
cup that Qin Xiu had poured.</p>
<p>While they were talking, Nine Thousand King was still slapping
his face. He did not dare stop, but he looked confused.</p>
<p>He was not able to confirm that the man who had been revived
through the statue was his master. He also did not know if the man
he served had truly come back to life or if this was some sort of
shadow copy.</p>
<p>No matter who he was, Nine Thousand King did not dare slow down.
People like Sacred Leader, even if he only had a sliver of life, he
could not disrespect him.</p>
<p>The master had invited Han Sen for a drink. Nine Thousand King
could not believe that this situation was happening. Although Han
Sen was a strange character, compared to his master, Nine Thousand
King thought Han Sen was not even worth one of his hairs.</p>
<p>In the universe back then, only God knew how many scary elites
found themselves in the position of a servant before the glory of
Sacred Leader. Very few God Spirits were able to share a drink with
Sacred Leader. Now, Sacred Leader was drinking with Han Sen. He
also had addressed Han Sen by his name. Nine Thousand King was in
total disbelief.</p>
<p>“In that universe, whoever was worth the leader addressing them
by their name was almighty. Does Han Sen really have what it
takes?” Nine Thousand King was shocked.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu raised his wine cup and said, “Cheers, my friend.”</p>
<p>“Why go cheers with me?” Han Sen was confused. He looked at Qin
Xiu. It did not matter if this was Sacred Leader reborn or not, but
there was a problem with his attitude.</p>
<p>“Has he seen the relationship between me and Wan’er?” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu laughed and did not answer. He drank all the wine in his
cup and said, “Back then, I made this holy garden and cut it out
from space. I had it stop and remained fixed in a certain place in
time. I made the holy garden cycle every hour. Here, you will never
get old, and you will never die. This is a place in which you can
live forever.”</p>
<p>“Qin Xiu really is Sacred Leader,” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at the holy garden and sighed, “I wanted to keep
Wan’er here so she could live forever. She could watch her favorite
views, eat her favorite meat, and drink her favorite wine. She told
me she would rather die than live in an endless loop.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu poured out some wine and drank it all. He closed his
eyes. It looked as if he was trying his best to enjoy it. He was
remembering the person he used to love it.</p>
<p>“So, I cut the Holy Kirin’s horn off to make a statue of her. If
her soul was inside this statue, she could live forever and would
still have her memories. She would just be unable to leave this
holy garden.” He put down the cup, smiled, and said, “But Wan’er
said told me it was like being put in prison. She defied my wishes
for her.”</p>
<p>Han Sen found this interesting, so he asked, “And then?”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked like he was smiling, but he was not smiling. He
did not answer Han Sen’s question. He poured himself some wine and
looked at the cup of wine in Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen was fascinated by hearing the tale, so he had forgotten
to drink the wine. He quickly necked it down.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu was holding the wine bottle. He poured out another drink
for Han Sen. He raised his cup and said, “I will cheer you
again.”</p>
<p>This time, Han Sen did not ask why. He knew that Qin Xiu must
have known Wan’er was being carried by him in some way. Otherwise,
Sacred Leader Qin Xiu would likely not say cheers to a guy he did
not even know.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King, who was kneeling outside the pavilion, was
frozen. To be cheered by Sacred Leader—in that sky, on that ground,
in that life, in that world—was something he had only ever seen
performed to Han Sen.</p>
