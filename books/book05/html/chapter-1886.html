<h3>Chapter 1886</h3>

<p>Guya looked at Buddha King. The clouds that trapped Buddha King
rose up and drifted over to her.</p>
<p>“Did you take the leader?” Guya asked Buddha King
expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! I don’t know what you mean!” Buddha King said, after
speaking out his buddha phrase.</p>
<p>Guya looked at Buddha King and went on to say, “I know how
powerful the Kao are. Without support, they wouldn’t have been
brave enough to betray us in the manner that they did.”</p>
<p>“Amitabha! What does that have to do with me?” Buddha King
said.</p>
<p>You think the Buddha Duke’s meeting with the Kao leader slipped
our notice?” Guya looked angry, and she went on to say, “If the
leader had simply listened to me, none of this would have happened.
Tell me! Where did the leader go?”</p>
<p>Now Han Sen understood why they had not met a stronger Gana. At
the auction, they had only seen Viscounts.</p>
<p>The Dukes had not appeared, and neither had the Earls. They had
already been taken by Buddha King.</p>
<p>Buddha King and the Kao had used the auction house as a
distraction for the other races. While it played out, the more
important Gana were successfully kidnapped. Buddha King and the Kao
hadn’t expected the Purgatory Heaven to come into play.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Buddha King’s fault, of course. No one expected the
Gana’s deified item to have been in the Gana’s hands. Or for it to
have been inside a random statue.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! If you release me, I will keep you safe and bring you
all together again.” Buddha King admitted he had his hands on their
leader, clearly planning to use this as leverage.</p>
<p>As soon as Buddha King said this, though, Guya drew a ghostly
scimitar and swung it toward his neck.</p>
<p>In a split second, the King class elite was beheaded. His head
rolled across the floor, with his eyes open. No one had expected
Guya to simply cut his head off.</p>
<p>The other Kings were all in shock after what they had witnessed.
Guya was a very decisive individual. In this heaven, a King class
elite’s life was as worthless and weak as the average commoner’s.
There was no need to pay them respect.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, but it made sense. Guya had already cast a
spell to activate Purgatory Heaven, so yes, the fact she was a very
decisive person was already established.</p>
<p>“Sister! You killed Buddha King. What about our leader?” Guna
sounded worried.</p>
<p>Guya coldly said, “Killing him did not make a difference. Our
leader isn’t going to be returned, but don’t worry; he’s not going
to die. He will likely be made a slave, for the Buddha won’t kill
him.”</p>
<p>The other Kings did not speak, and Guya was correct. The Gana
couldn’t save anyone. If they had been reckless and left Purgatory
Heaven, Buddha King would have found a chance. Instead of saving
their kin, they’d end up captured like the rest.</p>
<p>Everyone knew this was a familial matter, but not everyone could
make a decision like her.</p>
<p>Guya killing Buddha King had put an end to his tricks and
deception. It also counted as vengeance for her own people. When
Guya looked at the clouds, she noticed that all the elites were in
shock.</p>
<p>“You!” Guya looked at Han Sen. She spoke one word, and Han Sen’s
cloud started flying towards her.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. No one expected that the second guy she’d
kill to be Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? We have been through so much together. We
didn’t take your blood, and neither have we forced you to do
anything against your will. Why don’t you kill the guys who robbed
you of your blood instead of Old Han, huh?” Wang Yuhang said.</p>
<p>Guya ignored him and looked at Han Sen. “But you did bully Guna,
did you not?”</p>
<p>“What do you want from me, then?” Han Sen asked, sitting on the
cloud.</p>
<p>“You did not harm Guna, and you did help us. I can give you one
chance.” Guya looked at Guna while speaking to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What do I do with this chance?” Han Sen did not believe she
would let him go so easily.</p>
<p>“Kill them, and you vdll be considered one of us.” Guya pointed
at Gold Jade King, Giant King, and the others.</p>
<p>The five Kings were sent forward, near Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Good idea! Killing this many elites will gain me so many
enemies, and that’s just what I need. Even a King of the Rebate?
Not even Knife Queen would protect me for such a transgression!
With this leverage, I could only work for you and no one else. If I
don’t do what you say, you can tell the others and make me one of
the universe’s Most Wanted,”</p>
<p>Han Sen said coldly.</p>
<p>“Are you going to kill them or not?” Guya asked, looking at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Sure! Why not? They’re not my family. There’s no point giving
up my own life for theirs.” Han Sen just shrugged with his
shoulders.</p>
<p>“Good. Use this to cut their heads off, and then you will be
considered a friend.” Guya gave the Ghost Scimitar to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Giant King and Gold Jade King were surrounded by clouds. They
could not move. They watched Han Sen approach, still holding his
knife.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do you really want to betray Knife Queen and the
Rebate?” Gold Jade King said icily.</p>
<p>“From what I recall, you never treated me as one of the Rebate,
anyway. If you did, you would have taken me with you when you tried
to escape. Now you think I’m betraying you? Is this a joke or
something?” Han Sen slightly pressed the weapon against Gold Jade
King’s neck. The touch of the blade gave him a cold sweat.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not cut him. He then brought the scimitar in
front of Giant King and said, “What did you say? You said if their
blood was not enough, you’d use ours. I should kill you for that,
shouldn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Kill me if you want to. Just the crap and get on with it,”
Giant King said stolidly.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t strike. He walked past each elite, and eventually
he turned back to Guya and said, “These are five King class elites.
It would be a shame to kill them all. You should hold onto
them.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t kill them, I will kill you and your friends,” Guya
said dangerously.</p>
<p>“There is no way we are dying.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“That is not up to you to decide. I decide what happens here,”
Guya said.</p>
<p>Han Sen threw the Ghost Scimitar back to Guya and said, “From
now on, I call the shots. You and Guna can be my secretaries. Treat
this place nicely, and I will treat you nice in return.”</p>
<p>Guya, Guna, the Gana, and the Kings all looked at Han Sen like
he was a madman.</p>
