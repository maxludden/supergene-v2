<p>Kun was not in the present battleground, and when the small bugs
were crushed, so too was her vision. She had now lost all sight of
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Kun was taken aback by this, needless to say. The first thing
she did, though, was spawn another swarm of small bugs with her
small bug powers. They took off in flight, fanning across the area
and rabidly searching for Han Sen.</p>
<p>But before the bugs could find Han Sen, the place was doused in
a golden light. Countless coins came raining down from the sky,
crushing every single one of the bugs Kun had spawned.</p>
<p>Kun was shocked. She spawned another host of small bugs as she
moved away from the vicinity.</p>
<p>Kun regretted the fact she hadn’t put more distance between
herself and Han Sen earlier. Doubly so, after running a short while
and seeing a gold shadow appear above her.</p>
<p>Kun screamed and flapped her wings in panic. Bugs came out of
her in a swarm that was as thick as a fog. They went racing towards
Han Sen, seeking to distract him while she made a desperate escape
to save herself.</p>
<p>Han Sen blasted the incoming swarm with a geyser of fire. His
body was like a human flamethrower, and he scorched through the bug
fog and appeared directly before Kun.</p>
<p>Kun wished to turn and attack, but when she tried to do so, she
lost control of her vision. Things began to spin. The world was
swirling around her, and she could not re-orient herself. Shortly
after, she hit the ground and saw her own headless body drop to the
forest floor.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen cut Kun’s head off, Hai’er became incredibly
angry.</p>
<p>After Kun was decapitated, though, the paper of her registration
did not get torn up. The reason why was soon revealed, as a bigger
bug emerged from the brain inside her lopped-off head. The bug flew
up and then shredded the paper itself. After that, the bug vanished
from sight.</p>
<p>“It looks like not even Kun has what it takes to overcome the
power of Dollar. We need someone who has real power to face Dollar
and emerge victorious in a one-to-one bout.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid only Lone Bamboo might have what it takes.”</p>
<p>“Kun is very strong, but Dollar is no average opponent. He was
able to exploit her weakness.”</p>
<p>The audience was eager for more. Although Kun had used a strange
power to bring Dollar some trouble, fights like that were not
exciting enough. It didn’t quench their thirst. So, most people
immediately moved on to anticipating the fight between Dollar and
Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>The genius of Sky Palace versus the mysterious Dollar. Before
the fight was even to begin, people were talking about it
everywhere. Many people believed Dollar would be the one to win,
but many others thought Lone Bamboo could actually beat him. Both
sides were adamant about their beliefs, and convincing the
opposition seemed to be an impossible task.</p>
<p>Many gambling organizations had placed the odds at a very even
sum, suggesting not even those experts could determine who might be
the winner.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that he was going to fight Lone Bamboo next, and
although he really wanted to win, even he wasn’t sure if he could
defeat the powerful Sky.</p>
<p>He had battled Lone Bamboo once before, and neither of them
bested the other. Their last bout ended in a draw. Lone Bamboo had
suffered a terrible swelling of emotions, and he eventually put his
knife away.</p>
<p>“I wonder how much Lone Bamboo has grown since then. Will he
still lose control to a flareup of bad emotions?” Han Sen did not
want to encounter Lone Bamboo, but he did have a simmering
excitement for it that he could not deny. He wanted to fight him as
much as he didn’t.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight was physically more powerful than Lone Bamboo, but
while Dragon Eight was like a perfect killing machine, Lone Bamboo
was as refined as art.</p>
<p>Killing machines were perfect in the way they were big and
scary. Their greatest weakness, however, was in the flexibility of
their talents. They often lacked diversity and breadth in their
skills, and so they could not adapt to changing situations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lone Bamboo’s capabilities were always
stunning, even to elites. His strength was nowhere near perfect,
but it was beautiful. And that often took people by surprise.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had to select an opponent for life, it would be Lone
Bamboo. Dragon Eight was a dangerous opponent, but Han Sen already
understood him. He could calculate what a person like Dragon Eight
would do, winning or losing. But Lone Bamboo always had something
up his sleeve, and he could always do things that his opponents
would never expect.</p>
<p>Han Sen had joined the Geno Being Scroll to gain fame and draw
the attention of that so-called god. He had achieved his goal by
now. He had established his name, and it no longer mattered if he
won or lost.</p>
<p>But even so, Han Sen wanted to win the fight against Lone
Bamboo.</p>
<p>In Sky Palace, Lone Bamboo sat inside a stone pavilion. There
was a teacup beside him, but he did not move it. He simply looked
up at the moon in space.</p>
<p>“What do you think of Dollar?” The Sky Palace leader suddenly
appeared in the stone pavilion.</p>
<p>“He is a very strong individual,” Lone Bamboo answered.</p>
<p>“How so?” When the Sky Palace leader asked this, he did so with
a smile.</p>
<p>“Feeling,” Lone Bamboo quietly answered.</p>
<p>“Feeling?” The Sky Palace leader raised an eyebrow in
surprise.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo dipped into serious thought for a moment. “His body
is strong like an elite Dragon’s. His Dollar can suppress someone
like Dragon Eight, and if he summons it in large quantities, it can
annihilate a swarm of insects. But to me, that is not the scariest
thing. What scares me is what I feel when I watch him fight.”</p>
<p>“What feelings does he stir within you?” the Sky Palace leader
asked.</p>
<p>“He makes me think he is indestructible,” Lone Bamboo said with
a tone of gravitas.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader nodded and asked him, “What are you
planning to do?”</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo stood up and seriously told him, “I plan to
win.”</p>
<p>“Good.” The Sky Palace leader patted him on the shoulder and
said nothing more.</p>
<p>After Lone Bamboo left the pavilion, a woman with a black mask
appeared by the side of the Sky Palace leader. She quietly said,
“Do you think Lone Bamboo has what it takes to win?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to doubt the abilities of Lone Bamboo,” the Sky
Palace leader said.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t say that. And that isn’t what I asked. I am asking
you if you think he will win.” The black-masked woman stared at
him.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader opened his hands and said, “You saw the
powers possessed by Dollar. We don’t know him enough yet, but I
must say he is a scary guy. We can only wait and see if Lone Bamboo
will triumph, but he has never disappointed me before.”</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo returned from Sky Palace and went to his own private
isle. Before he entered his bamboo house, he stopped for a moment
and looked at it.</p>
<p>The bamboo door was pushed open slightly, and a little girl
leaped through the opening. Behind her, however, was a black-haired
young man.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Lone Bamboo asked the young man.</p>
<p>He could tell that the man was one of the Sky, but he had never
met a young Sky that strong before. The man’s presence was akin to
that of a terrifying beast or even the darkest reaches of the abyss
itself. Even though the man was standing right there, Lone Bamboo’s
senses couldn’t tell him anything about the man.</p>
<p>“Evil Eye.” The man smiled.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo frowned. He knew that name, but he had never
expected Evil Eye to have been reborn as one of the Sky. And on top
of that, he had brought a little girl into Sky Palace in
secret.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Lone Bamboo asked.</p>
<p>Evil Eye rolled his shoulders in a shrug. “I came here for you.
You and Dollar are interesting. I want to fight you both, but you
two will be meeting first. To make sure that I don’t miss out, I
have come to see you first.”</p>
<p>“Actually, we are looking for Dollar. We do not know where to
find him, though, so we came for you first.” The little girl spoke
with a surprising amount of seriousness.</p>
