<h2>New Guessing</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2899</h3>

<p>His method of geno art usage was common, so it did not look
special. It looked like the other princes and princesses could use
them too.</p>
<p>When Bai Wanjie used them, all the geno arts combined like a
glove. He was able to block the undead’s attacks and start to
establish a much-needed advantage.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Bai Wanjie’s talent is not as great as Bai
Wuchang’s, but his mind and his skills are better than. So many
geno art combinations are being executed perfectly. You would have
to practice a lot to get to this level.”</p>
<p>After fighting for an hour, Bai Wanjie was finally able to slay
the yellow undead. It was different from the red undead. The yellow
undead melted and disappeared. Suddenly, there was an electric
voice that came from the Yellow Temple. Without emotion, it said,
“Killed medium-class undead.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A bridge appeared from the sea. It was leading to a third
island.</p>
<p>This time, the prince and princesses did not quickly head across
it. Many princes and princesses remained where they were. They each
wanted to enter the temple and battle the yellow undead for
themselves to test their own mettle.</p>
<p>On the last island, they had all the confidence needed to beat
the red undead. It was not a foe they found too formidable, so they
were happy enough to proceed and head to the next island. They did
not feel as confident when they came to the yellow undead. It was
not something they could easily defeat, if at all. It was natural
for them to assume they would only encounter harder trials and
stronger undead enemies the further they went. If they could not
beat the current task, it would only put them in harsher danger by
going forward.</p>
<p>They could have chosen to proceed, but they preferred to stay
and practice with the yellow undead. When they were able to beat
the yellow undead, they would keep on going.</p>
<p>After all, Starter King’s Land was a place for training. They
weren’t rats in the maze searching for an exit. There was no rush,
so a bit of practice was in order.</p>
<p>Many of the princes and princesses thought that way. They
entered the yellow temple. More yellow undead appeared from the
metal box.</p>
<p>They fought the yellow undead to increase their battle
power.</p>
<p>Only Bai Wanjie, Bai Wuchang, Bai Qingxian, Bai Lingshang, and
Bai Wei went ahead on the next bridge. They merrily went along to
the next island.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed. There were so many prince and princesses
there, so they should have been safe. Bai Wanjie and the others
might encounter danger, so Han Sen was keen to see what the next
undead looked like.</p>
<p>Upon seeing him, Prince Qingxian said, “Holy Baby, you should
stay here. If you are in danger, no one here can protect you.”</p>
<p>“I can protect myself.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Prince Qingxian said nothing further. Bai Wanjie, who was up
ahead, had almost reached the third island. Bai Lingshang and Bai
Wuchang followed with haste.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen noticed the island had a temple of its own,
as expected. This time, however, the temple was blue.</p>
<p>When everyone went before the blue temple, the door opened on
its own. It revealed the interior, which had a blue metal box
inside it.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie and the others swapped stares with one another. In
the end, Bai Wuchang stepped into the blue temple first.</p>
<p>Katcha-cha!</p>
<p>The blue metal box opened up. An undead came out from it.</p>
<p>This undead looked like an Extreme King or human. Its body was
not as transparent. It looked like it had been built from
porcelain. Although there was a layer of crystal, one could not see
the structure inside the body.</p>
<p>Plus, its body had some color, including black hair and black
pupils. It looked very alive. It looked like a living thing.</p>
<p>Although it was still primitive class, the moment the undead
lashed out, everyone felt that it was different from the other two
undead.</p>
<p>The last two undead were strong, but they were just strong.
There was something about this undead that could not be described
with words.</p>
<p>If the previous the two undead were robots, this undead was a
living thing.</p>
<p>It still used the Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch, but its
Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch was not just strong. It had a
special level.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang used knife skills to fight the undead. He blocked
three punches, but he was quickly suppressed. His Ghost Body was
able to avoid all the attacks, but the undead’s Extreme King
Shocking Sky Punch crushed space and broke it. Bai Wuchang could
not walk between the real world and the underworld.</p>
<p>“Wuchang, let me help you!” Bai Wanjie could see Bai Wuchang
getting beat. He shouted and joined the fight.</p>
<p>“Allow me to chip in too!” Bai Lingshang’s body looked like ice.
She was like an ice goddess as she joined the fight.</p>
<p>“How could you leave me behind?” Prince Qingxia cast Hatred
Times Ten and joined the fight.</p>
<p>Bai Wei did not say anything. She cast her own Extreme King
Shocking Sky Punch to join the fight.</p>
<p>The undead was getting attacked by five princes and princesses.
Although they were all primitive class, it was still able to repel
the five and not be beaten. It was difficult to tell who the victor
would end up being.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched from the sidelines. He thought the undead looked
just like a spirit.</p>
<p>“If Starter King’s Land is something the Extreme King Alpha
brought from Sacred, these undead should be Sacred Leader’s
research subjects. Fox Queen used to say Sacred Leader, in the
sanctuaries, researched immortal spirits. The holy spirits should
be these spirits now. Are these undead the spirits Sacred Leader
tried to make? If so, how did he create them?”</p>
<p>After thinking about that, Han Sen’s expression changed. “Hang
on, Extreme King took out the spirit, but the spirits themselves
are the immortal beings. Does this mean the undead are made from
the spirits of the xenogeneics?”</p>
<p>Although this was just Han Sen guessing, he thought it was
possible.</p>
<p>“If that is the theory, that means the spirits are a spirit
body… God Spirits are one such form… Wait a minute… Spirits and God
Spirits survive in familiar ways… They are immortal… They can be
reborn…” Han Sen’s thought was chilling.</p>
<p>There was something in the middle that could not be explained.
Spirits were only exclusive to the sanctuaries. They did not need
the body of another creature, yet they could still fight.</p>
<p>God required another creature’s body to fight in the universe.
This was like the undead spirits, but the undead were not as
perfect as a spirit. It seemed as if there were many flaws.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He thought of something else that was
possible. “I have heard Fox Queen say Sacred Leader researched
immortal holy spirits in the sanctuaries. I thought the spirits
existed in the sanctuaries before Sacred Leader, so he went there
to research them. What if it was all the other way around?”</p>
