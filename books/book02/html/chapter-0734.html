    <p>
      Her beautiful legs were like two lashing dragons, attempting to capture
      Han Sen like a pair of scissors. They looked ready to cut him down right
      then and there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen kept evading her capture and tried to plead with the woman,
      saying, &#8220;Lady, I have been wandering the Black Desert by myself for
      far too long. I thought I had encountered a mirage. I was only concerned
      with checking whether or not my eyes were playing tricks on me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he wasn&#8217;t telling her the whole truth, he was never going
      to admit how he actually enjoyed playing with her butt.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill you!&#8221; The woman did not care for his
      words and continued trying to attack Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you want to kill me, can you at least put on some clothes
      first?&#8221; Han Sen kept stepping backwards, talking to her. Things had
      gone a little haywire, and viewing her flailing naked body was getting a
      little awkward.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman froze and screamed once more. The next second, the woman
      summoned armor to clothe her body. She gritted her teeth and resumed her
      attempts to attack Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lady, you must believe me! I am a soldier with ethics,&#8221; Han
      Sen thought he had heard these words spoken somewhere before, and so he
      used them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman continued as if she were both deaf and mad, and her attempts to
      attack Han Sen did not slow down.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lady, if you keep doing this, I will have to be rude. You
      won&#8217;t be able to blame me for what happens next. It is daytime, and
      you were without clothes in public. Sunbathing or not, I am not the only
      person who would stop to admire you,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Screw your public. Aside from you, what other perverts might be
      hiding around here, huh?&#8221; the lady spoke, amidst her frantic
      attempts to attack Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen just now noticed there was no one else in the city. Aside from the
      short-haired lady, the local vicinity was entirely dead. Even after using
      dongxuan aura, he could not detect the presence of any other life forces
      in the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s only you here in this city?&#8221; Han Sen asked the
      woman while dodging and blocking her attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lady no longer answered him, and continued trying to attack Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s principles were simple; if he was able to explain a
      predicament first, he would. If he couldn&#8217;t, fight first and talk
      later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then used one hand to grab the lady&#8217;s leg and the other hand
      to grab her fist. Then he pulled and flipped her onto the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lady used her other hand to try to fight back against Han Sen. He
      grabbed the fist and pulled her arm behind her back. Then, he pulled out
      the platinum chain on his waist and tied her legs and arms together. After
      that, he picked her up in one arm.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Asshole. Let me go!&#8221; The woman was very stubborn and was not
      keen to give up. She now tried to use her teeth to bite Han Sen, but from
      the way she was being held, she could not reach him despite her best
      attempts.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;When you calm down, I&#8217;ll let you go.&#8221; Han Sen continued
      to hold the lady who had been tied up. He picked up one of her beverages
      and started to drink it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Cool.&#8221; Han Sen drank three of her beverages and belched
      loudly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are an asshole; obscene and cheap. Don&#8217;t touch my
      beverages!&#8221; The lady became even angrier as she watched Han Sen
      consume her drinks.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen ignored her and carried her into the city.</p>

    <p>
      The city was desolate. The ruined remnants of old stone houses were all
      that was there. Dust and sand had caked much of the ruins, and it looked
      like no one had lived there for many years. There was no trace of
      occupation to be found.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen proceeded towards the plaza. A small shelter like this did not
      contain teleporters in ordinary rooms, only public ones in either the
      plaza or spirit hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plaza wasn&#8217;t very big, and the floor was comprised of many
      yellow tiles. It was rather clean there, as if someone had taken the time
      to clean up.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when Han Sen saw the teleporter, he was disappointed. The teleporter
      appeared to be damaged and inoperable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen walked deeper and deeper into the city, but found little more than
      lines of ruined houses, sand, and dust. The houses were only two stories
      tall, but there was a spirit hall. The spirit hall stood out amongst the
      rest, at four stories tall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen walked before the spirit hall, and the woman suddenly appeared
      frightened and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go in! Leave this place!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why?&#8221; Han Sen noticed she finally appeared to be willing to
      talk, so he lowered his head to ask her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can&#8217;t go in there because you can&#8217;t!&#8221; the
      short-haired woman said, as she gritted her teeth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen noticed her resume talking nonsense and ignored her. He walked
      forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Stop! Don&#8217;t go in; there is a scary spirit in there!&#8221;
      the short-haired lady quickly shouted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen lifted his lips and told her, &#8220;But it&#8217;s such a small
      shelter. This is a noble shelter at the most, so what manner of scary
      spirit can possibly reside here? Besides, if there is one, how have you
      managed to teleport in and out of this place?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There really is a spirit in there, and I have never left this
      place,&#8221; the short-haired woman stressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Pfff! Don&#8217;t tell me those beverages came with you on a
      journey here.&#8221; Han Sen was not buying her story.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the short-haired lady heard that, she thought about Han Sen not only
      squeezing her butt, but also drinking the beverages she had held onto for
      so long. And the fact he drank three, all at once. Angrily, she said,
      &#8220;Yes! That is right, you big horny asshole! Give me back my
      beverages.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Pfff!&#8221; Han Sen still did not believe her. Still carrying the
      woman, he approached the door and pushed it open.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had already used his dongxuan aura to take a peek inside, but
      couldn&#8217;t detect anything. Therefore, he believed she was lying.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t go! There really is a scary spirit in there, and
      you&#8217;ll regret stepping inside. Let me go and die inside there all
      alone; don&#8217;t drag me down to hell with you!&#8221; The short-haired
      lady noticed he was ignoring her plights and warnings, so she did her best
      to persuade him not to open the door. She almost cried aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment Han Sen stepped into the spirit hall, his heart jumped. A scary
      force approached him like a black shadow or a toxic snake.
    </p>

    <p>Dong!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen held his Flaming Rex Spike horizontally and blocked the
      shadow-like snake. He saw what appeared to be an arm-thick, black chain
      wrap itself around his rex spike.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other side of the black chain, a person appeared to be holding it,
      clad in broken armor. He was impaled on a black pillar, and the chain he
      wielded led through his body and into the stone behind him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man looked pretty but cold, and he had long, narrow eyes. He had two
      fox ears in his long black hair. He coldly looked at Han Sen, as his long
      fingers clasped the other end of the chain
