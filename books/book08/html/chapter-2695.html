	<p>The talons of the Red Blood Demon tore through Han Sen’s body, and it exploded like a water balloon.</p>

	<p>The next second, the water that had separated began to gather up again. It reformed Han Sen’s face, but before
		the water finished reconstituting Han Sen’s body, the creature spread its claws again. Once more, it swung at
		Han Sen. The red substance chains that went with the attack erupted like a volcano.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was shocked. He had used his Original Water King Body to escape that first strike, but right now, his
		body still hadn’t coalesced. If he was hit again, all of his cells that had been turned into water would become
		nothing. Even the Original Water King Body wouldn’t resurrect him a second time.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could no longer afford to hesitate. In a moment, his body glowed pure white as he entered his super god
		spirit mode. The volcanic-looking red substance chains went right through him, passing harmlessly through his
		shadow.</p>

	<p>But just as Han Sen started using his super god spirit body, some strange power knocked him back out of it. He
		was back to his usual self in no time at all.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s stomach sank. With Wan’er still inside his Destiny’s Tower, his super god spirit mode had been severely
		downgraded. Again, it had been canceled before he could use it to finish a fight.</p>

	<p>The Red Blood Demon didn’t give Han Sen any time to think. Its body became a crimson shadow that went straight
		for him again. It was like a real demon, and it moved toward him too fast for his eyes to follow.</p>

	<p>Han Sen teleported away, regardless. Because he wasn’t trying to escape Jail Demon Hall, he didn’t trigger the
		building’s restrictions.</p>

	<p>But by the time Han Sen had teleported away, an evil smile had already crossed the Red Blood Demon’s strange
		face. Again, it appeared directly in front of Han Sen. Five red clawed fingers reached forward to shred his
		heart.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s eye flashed red. That red color spread across his body, and then he simply disappeared. He went
		straight into the Red Blood Demon’s eye.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had been pushed far enough that he had no choice but to use his Blood Eye Evil God’s beast soul. With the
		eye skill, he entered the Red Blood Demon’s eye.</p>

	<p>Doing this might allow Exquisite and Li Keer to suss out the secrets of beast souls, but he had no choice. He
		couldn’t let the Red Blood Demon kill him just to keep his secrets.</p>

	<p>In the Red Blood Demon’s eyes, Han Sen’s surroundings were pure red. It was completely different from the eyes
		Han Sen had entered before.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt a bit relieved, for a moment. Just as he thought he had escaped all of the danger, he saw the
		redness around him begin to boil. The power rose up around him like scary flames of blood. That power carried a
		scary presence, and it turned the whole of the eye-world into a flaming red sea.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could feel the power inside the bloody flames. He didn’t dare stay there any longer. He teleported out of
		the Red Blood Demon’s eyes.</p>

	<p>“This guy is too much for me to deal with!” As soon as Han Sen teleported out, the Red Blood Demon was coming for
		him with its red substance chains lashing around. It reached Han Sen in an instant.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s purple eye began to spin as he used the Purple-Eye Butterfly beast soul to trace the movements of the
		Red Blood Demon.</p>

	<p>He used the power of all the beast souls he had, without hesitation. He used Move Mountain Area’s area beast soul
		and even his own Dongxuan Area. He used Jadeskin, the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and more. He used everything he could
		to repel the monster. He pushed all of his powers to the max.</p>

	<p>Aside from the peacock king soul robe that couldn’t be worn in tandem with the Apollo Set, Han Sen used every
		beast soul he had at his disposal.</p>

	<p>Even so, Han Sen’s power and speed were unable to close the gap between him and the Red Blood Demon. He used his
		formation and judgment powers to their full potential, and he barely dodged the next attack.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>When the Red Blood Demon attacked for the third time, it was already too late for Han Sen to avoid. The red
		substance chain brushed right by his ribs. Three of his rib bones snapped instantly, and his flesh was torn
		through.</p>

	<p>“I have to fight for my life again!” Han Sen’s mind was still calm at that moment, though.</p>

	<p>Thinking too much about things wasn’t going to help him now. He needed to calm down. He used the full potential
		of every power he could to battle the beast. He had to stall for as much time as possible, all so he could be
		saved.</p>

	<p>“Jail Demon Hall has some kind of isolation protocol? The Very High must know about this, surely. I need to keep
		going until the Very High come. Then I can be saved.” Han Sen tried to comfort himself.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen had forgotten one thing. Outer Sky was way too big, and there weren’t many of the Very High. Jail
		Demon Hall was far away from where most of the Very High lived. It was in the middle of nowhere, and there was
		usually no reason for anyone to visit. If the Very High noticed there something amiss, it would still take them
		half an hour to get there. It might even take them longer than that. Han Sen didn’t know if he could even last
		that long.</p>

	<p>At this time, Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng had been focusing their attention on Jail Demon Hall. When they saw Jail
		Demon Hall’s door suppress the Red Demon Beast’s light, they knew that their plan had succeeded. The Red Blood
		Demon had already gone mad with rage and triggered the defensive properties of its prison. They had trapped Han
		Sen inside with the infuriated Red Blood Demon.</p>

	<p>“The guy in charge of Jail Demon Hall won’t be able to get here for at least half an hour. And half an hour from
		now, I don’t think there will be anything of Han Sen left to save,” Liyu Zhen said with a cold laugh.</p>

	<p>Li Xue Cheng looked at Liyu Zhen and asked, “Is the warehouse okay?”</p>

	<p>“Don’t worry. Everything is fine. The healing geno fluids Han Sen always used are all gone. The warehouse only
		has the recommended, superior healing geno fluids left. No one will know that a geno fluid can trigger the Red
		Demon Blood’s power. Even if they found out it was the Blood Marrow Geno Fluid that triggered the Red Blood
		Demon’s rage, they couldn’t blame me. It would just be an unfortunate event, caused by no one but himself.”</p>

	<p>“That is great,” Li Xue Cheng said with relief. He smiled and went on to say, “Exquisite just gave him some geno
		fluids, too. She won’t be here for another two days, at least. He is very dead this time. He is such a genius.
		It is a shame he has to die. But no one asked him to be our enemy.”</p>

	<p>Exquisite and Li Keer were practicing Under the Sky, trying to employ Han Sen’s experience to their advantage.
	</p>

	<p>All of a sudden, both of their phones rang at the same time. They saw the number, and it shocked them.</p>

	<p>“Why is the Inspection Department calling us?” Li Keer asked with confusion. She quickly answered her phone.</p>

	<p>It didn’t take long for Li Keer and Exquisite’s faces to change. Li Keer screamed, “What? Jail Demon Hall’s
		restrictions have been triggered?”</p>

	<p>Because Jail Demon Hall’s restriction powers had been activated, they had no way of learning what was going on
		inside, either. All of their scrying powers had been cut off due to the hall’s defenses. So, right now, even the
		Inspection Department couldn’t tell what was happening inside the hall. They had already sent out an agent.</p>

	<p>When they found out who was in charge of Han Sen’s challenge to the Red Blood Demon, they contacted Exquisite and
		Li Keer. They asked if the two women knew if Han Sen was inside, because the restrictions had been triggered ten
		minutes before.</p>

	<p>“It is over…” Exquisite and Li Keer felt cold. Only Han Sen had permission to hunt inside that hall, so he was
		the only person inside. If the Red Blood Demon had triggered the defenses, Han Sen was probably the reason that
		it had done so.</p>

	<p>After the two of them spoke to the Inspection Department, they used God’s Wander to travel to Jail Demon Hall.
		They prayed Han Sen wasn’t inside.</p>

	<p>But the closer they got to Jail Demon Hall, the colder they felt. That was because they couldn’t sense their
		connection with Han Sen. Something was smothering their ability to feel what he was feeling. There weren’t many
		powers that could sever their connection with Han Sen. The power that bound the true god xenogeneic within Jail
		Demon Hall was one of the only things that could. There was an 80% to 90% chance that Han Sen was trapped inside
		Jail Demon Hall. He could even be dead already.</p>
