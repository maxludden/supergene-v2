	<p>“Zhuo Dong Lai lost?” Yan Dan looked on in disbelief.</p>

	<p>It was not just Yan Dan feeling that way. All the elites from every kingdom were now reeling in shock. Zhuo Dong
		Lai, who had almost broken the world, still lost. The incredible sword he had used was still incapable of
		defeating Han Sen. “He lost.” In an old tower, the person inside looked surprised. Wu Wei Dao Palace had not had
		someone in its ranks who could break the world in many years. Now, someone had managed to achieve the One Dollar
		Sword Mind. He was able to use one sword to break the world, but he still lost the fight.</p>

	<p>“In the years I have isolated myself, what happened here in the universe?” A person was deep in thought.</p>

	<p>“I lost,” Zhuo Dong Lai said after lowering his hands.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at Zhuo Dong Lai and asked, “Now your life belongs to me, right?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, my life is folded to you now,” Zhuo Dong Lai said with a serious nod.</p>

	<p>“I will have you do one thing for me, and you will not reject me,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>

	<p>“My life is yours,” Zhuo Dong Lai said. “You can do whatever you want with it, but this life is cheap. If you
		want to use me to take the life of another, I do not think I will be able to do that.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen shook his head. “I do not want you to kill people for me. I want you to leave Wu Wei Dao Palace and obey
		the God of Wealth. You must become a member of God of Wealth.”</p>

	<p>“OK. I will pay back whatever I owe to Wu Wei Dao Palace. You are the one calling the shots now.” Zhuo Dong Lai
		did not ask any questions about the deal. He just simply agreed.</p>

	<p>Han Sen put his hand on Zhuo Dong Lai’s neck. He touched Zhuo Dong Lai on his shoulder. He got closer and
		whispered something into his ear. He then smiled and started to depart.</p>

	<p>Zhuo Dong Lai nodded and departed the space battleground. Han Sen did the same and left the space battleground.
	</p>

	<p>“What? That person who just broke the world is going to betray my Wu Wei Dao Palace.” The person inside the tower
		had a very strong will. He almost did Sky and Man Combined Together, but now he was very angry.</p>

	<p>The elites and students of Wu Wei Dao Palace felt the same way about things. Zhuo Dong Lai was such a powerful
		character, and now he was going to abandon Wu Wei Dao Palace.</p>

	<p>The people who knew what was going on inside Wu Wei Dao Palace could not really hate Zhuo Dong Lai for what he
		did.</p>

	<p>Zhuo Dong Lai returned everything he was able to. Sky Group Leader wanted his life and God Spirit Blood-Pulse. He
		also wanted his purple mist holy clothes. Zhuo Dong Lai could have left, but he didn’t. He returned everything
		that was given to him.</p>

	<p>Zhuo Dong Lai no longer had the God Spirit Blood-Pulse of Wu Wei Dao Palace. The purple mist holy clothes left
		him. His life belonged to Dollar. Whatever Wu Wei Dao Palace had given him was returned. He betrayed Wu Wei Dao
		Palace, but the people of Wu Wei Dao Palace could not find a reason to hate him.</p>

	<p>“Sky Group… Sky Group… What have you guys done?” A party leader in the Wu Wei Dao Palace was blisteringly angry.
		He waved his sleeves and turned a mountain into flat ground.</p>

	<p>“He is an elite who can break the world, yet he just betrayed Wu Wei Dao Palace!” King Jing Zhen slapped the
		table and laughed. He almost had tears come out because he was laughing so hard.</p>

	<p>“Wu Wei Dao Palace… Sky Group… This is interesting…” Yan Dan looked on strangely. He looked as if he wanted to
		laugh, but he held it in.</p>

	<p>“Who is this God of Wealth God Spirit? How can there be some powerful existence like that? Now, Zhuo Dong Lai is
		in its ranks. This rhythm goes against the sky. Of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits, are there that many scary
		elites in their ranks?”</p>

	<p>Everyone was suddenly wide awake. Out of the 16 rank fights that determined the top eight, there were another two
		God of Wealth member fights going on.</p>

	<p>Everyone watched the fights with Ingot and Lucky. Ingot’s fight had already come to an end. Just as they thought,
		Ingot achieved victory and gained a place among the top eight.</p>

	<p>Lucky’s fight was still happening. There had yet to be a winner determined. Many people watched the fight.</p>

	<p>Compared to this, the fights won by Han Sen and Ingot weren’t half as bad. Unlike Zhuo Dong Lai, who had used a
		God Spirit gene race, the others were just two scary gene races in a heated battle.</p>

	<p>Lucky’s gold wing peacock king had been seen many times. The gold wing peacock king’s opponent was a gene race
		too. The masters had not shown themselves on the battleground.</p>

	<p>It was like no one recognized the gold wing peacock king, and no one knew what the other gene race was called.
		They could only tell it was a white tiger.</p>

	<p>The white tiger was about two feet long. It looked like a juvenile. Still, a small tiger like that was having no
		issue fighting against the gold wing peacock king. In fact, it was doing rather well against it.</p>

	<p>Ha Sen sensed that the small tiger was a rare gene race, but it had not evolved enough. Otherwise, the gold wing
		peacock king would have been unable to fight it.</p>

	<p>He looked at Feng Yin Yin’s opponent. That person’s name was Little White. The God Spirit it belonged to was
		Moment God.</p>

	<p>“One who pledges allegiance to Moment God, huh?” Han Sen developed an evil grin. If his God of Wealth Temple
		could have Moment God, he wondered what sort of god could actually reside in Moment God’s temple.</p>

	<p>The small tiger was weird, but it was just a baby. It had not yet grown up. It was unable to defeat the gold wing
		peacock king. After a while of battle, the gold wing peacock king damaged it quite a bit.</p>

	<p>The small tiger’s master summoned the tiger back. It did not want the little tiger to die.</p>

	<p>Feng Yin Yin smoothly proceeded to the top eight. Everybody from God of Wealth, the three of them, all reached
		the top eight. Among the top eight, three of them hailed from the same God Spirit, which was extremely rare. It
		made the God of Wealth’s name blow up in the universe. “What kind of level is God of Wealth’s God Spirit? How
		come we have never heard of it?” “It must be a high-class God Spirit. Otherwise, why would so many scary elites
		become a member of it?” “I want to go and see the God of We Temple. If that God of Wealth looked at me and made
		me become its member, I would most assuredly be blessed.”</p>

	<p>“Do you guys not remember the gold pillar when the god fights started? Do you think that might have been a beam
		of light belonging to God of Wealth?”</p>

	<p>“I think it very well could be. I say, why else would there be a pillar that was brighter than the current 12
		Annihilation God Spirits?”</p>

	<p>“I think the gold pillar came from the Gold Crystal System. Does the God of Wealth hail from the Gold Crystal
		System?”.</p>

	<p>Everyone in the universe was guessing where the God of Wealth Temple came from. They also really wanted to
		uncover the identities of Dollar, Ingot, and Lucky. Some nobles actually sent out people to the Gold Crystal
		System to seek out the God of Wealth Temple.</p>

	<p>It was a shame the God of Wealth was guarded by Sky King’s big dragon riders. No one was able to get close, so no
		one was able to find the god temple they sought.</p>

	<p>Only one person was able to get past the big dragon riders. This person went to God of Wealth River and headed
		into the God of Wealth Temple. This person went in front of the god statue, put down a droplet of blood, and
		became a member of the temple. The dragon maid went back to Rocky Dee and said with a bow, “Mister Minister, I
		have done what you wanted me to do.” “Good job,” Rocky Dee said with a laugh. “The real good stuff is going to
		start. I hope Han Sen will not disappoint me.”</p>
