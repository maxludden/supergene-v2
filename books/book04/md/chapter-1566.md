  Han Sen entered the garden and felt the swordmind’s influence emerge from the cleft.

The swordmind was strange. Most swordsmen would give people a sharp feeling or a strong sensation of intimidation. But this swordmind in particular was different. It toiled back and forth like waves, endlessly. It didn’t feel intimidating, per se, but it was hard and tough.

It felt as if the swordmind was not strong at first, and everyone had the chance to battle it through their own sheer will. It wasn’t a task only reserved for the capabilities of super beings, though. Those who were gemstones confront it just as well. There were no disadvantages to having a weaker body.

But the swordmind, despite not feeling very strong, would perplex most swordsmen, and leave them unsure of how to proceed. Not even super elites had managed to tame it, and they were often negatively affected by it.

“When people first see it, they aren’t sure if this really is Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmark. They have to spend a while getting a feel for it before they acknowledge how frightening it can be. This swordmind is like an endless river. The pressure it exudes builds up over time, and the more pressure that builds up, the stronger it becomes. Gemstones class creatures can watch it for a few days and without being affected. Super elites can hardly even make it ten. They are affected after some time, and they might even suffer injuries. In some cases, their faith can be broken and their own swordmind damaged,” Xu Mi said.

Han Sen nodded. He practiced had sword skills, and although it wasn’t the best, he had a swordmind of his own.

Especially after seeing Six Paths’ Heartsword. Ever since, his sword skills had developed to become something special. If he was affected by Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind, it would be a great loss.

Xu Mi went on to say, “Don’t try to use your own swordmind against Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind. His swordmind is like water. If you use your swordmind against it, it’ll be like trying to go against the stream. The more strength you use, the more pressure will be put against you. If you don’t go against it, you could at least last a few days. If you willingly go against it, I’m afraid you wouldn’t last a day. In only a few hours, your swordmind might be irreparably damaged.”

“It looks tame, but it is actually overbearing,” Han Sen said.

“Well, it did come from an emperor of the sword generation,” Xu Mi said.

Han Sen felt the swordmind’s rush and likened it to a lapsing tide. He thought to himself, “I have practiced Heartsword. My sword skills are tough. I can challenge the water, never giving up. Going against Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind is a perfect opportunity to make my Heartsword stronger.”

Han Sen knew that Furnace Emperor had asked him to go there to see the mark as a form of test. Han Sen didn’t really want to teach Xu Mi, so it didn’t matter that he had to take this detour. He wasn’t in a particular rush to give Furnace Emperor an impressive demonstration.

Han Sen used his swordmind, and then the mark’s swordmind that was previously tame suddenly began to swell.

The stronger Han Sen pushed his swordmind, the more pressure the other swordmind brought down on him. It was just as Xu Mi had explained. Xu Mi saw Han Sen use his swordmind against Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind, and he became very excited as he watched them fight.

“His swordmind looks like Heartsword. There is definitely a bit of difference between his and Six Paths’ variants, however.” Furnace Emperor watched Han Sen use his swordmind. He could see it all.

Furnace Emperor had fought Six Paths once. He lost, but the experience made him very familiar with Six Paths’ sword skills.

Xu Mi’s mother, Fire Empress, frowned. “Xu Mi told him what he knows about Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind, and still he uses his own swordmind to go against it. He is brave, but he is too arrogant. He is not suitable to be Xu Mi’s teacher.”

Furnace Emperor shook his head. “Don’t be so sure. Although Six Paths Emperor is not as good as Holy Sword Emperor, they are not too far apart. He self-destructed and became an emperor again, starting from scratch. Restarting like that means he might not be any worse than Holy Sword Emperor now. If Han Sen really practiced Heartsword, even if he only managed to nail 70% of it, he will definitely be able to resist the power of this swordmind without bringing damage to himself.”

“If he only knows 70%, then why not just ask Six Paths to become his teacher instead?” Fire Empress said.

“It’s not that easy to hire Six Paths. If he didn’t take Xu Mi seriously, then paying him would be pointless.” Furnace shook his head.

“Xu Mi has our great genes. The talents he has must surely be better than those of Six Paths. If Xu Mi is not good enough to be his student, I don’t think anyone in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary would be good enough for him.” Fire Empress opened her eyes wide. She was like any mother, though, thinking her son was the best.

The pressure building upon Han Sen was becoming a lot. When he used his swordmind, the swordmark that was previously calm suddenly started to rage.

Han Sen felt as if he had been thrust into a rapid river. The other swordmind was griding against his sword skills, and he felt as if he’d be flattened any second.

A swordmind wasn’t all about pure power. The swordmind concerned itself with the sensation of the sword. It was something you could only feel, and not describe. You could not touch it, either, as it was not solid.

But if your swordmind was damaged, things could turn out worse than if you endured a physical injury.

When physical damage was inflicted upon you, you could consult a doctor and use their medicine to heal. But if it was your heart that was injured, nothing could remedy it. You would have to use your own will to fix it.

Han Sen felt as if his swordmind was like steel, but it was getting ground down. His will was being used up quickly. If he had been a person with a weak will, he’d have gone crazy already.

Even a swordsman with a strong will wouldn’t have lasted this long under this sort of opposition. But Han Sen was different. His Heartsword gave him a strong swordmind, and his will was reinforced by the crystallizers. That scary swordmind could not break his will.

No matter how much the swordmind tried to break his will, Han Sen was unmoved. Instead, he allowed his will to get stronger.

Time passed, and so far, an hour had gone by.

“No wonder he is the teacher. He has battled with Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind for an hour, all without moving. He is better than those super swordsmen,” Xu Mi complimented him.

“He is good,” Furnace Emperor said.

Fire Empress coldly said, “It’s only been one hour. If he can last twelve, and his swordmind is still fine, then he can be Xu Mi’s teacher.”
