  The bloodline of the Sacred egg came from both Sacred’s master and Destroyer Empress, but after absorbing the power of death from Rolling Dragon King and the black dragon and being born from the black pond, she had too much deathly power. Her hereditary abilities from Destroyer Empress were completely activated, and they suppressed her inheritance from Sacred’s master.

There was too much deathly power piling up in her body, which was very bad for a newborn baby.

If the newborn baby kept absorbing the power of death, it would become exactly the same as Destroyer Empress, and there would be nothing special about her.

Destroyer Wolf drained the blood of the newborn, and at the same time, it also took away the excessive deathly power inside her. That meant the Destroyer Wolf didn’t actually merge all the genes of the newborn; instead, it only obtained the genes of her destruction abilities.

The blood and genes of the newborn were finally balanced, as her whole body was now growing instead of just the part that belonged to Destroyer Empress.

However, she didn’t only lose the power that had been dammed up inside her. She also lost her blood, which had caused her to slip into a coma. When Han Sen’s blood fell on her body and soaked into her, she recovered quickly.

As the newborn absorbed Han Sen’s blood, she obtained some of his genes, and her own genes also changed slightly because of the blood she absorbed.

Han Sen’s blood was like a geno solution, which merged the two different bloodlines of the newborn and created a unique new power that neither of the original powers possessed.

Han Sen didn’t expect his blood to be this useful. At that time, he was spewing out his blood recklessly. Blood kept bursting from the stone pipe, and though it wasn’t hitting the Destroyer Wolf, the enormous power was enough to destroy an entire mountain.

After Han Sen fired four or five bloody arrows, the mountains around them were already in ruins.

Ghost Eye was walking around with two super creatures, looking for any opportunities that might come their way.

As they walked, they watched the mountains nearby explode, and then Han Sen and the Destroyer Wolf flew by in front of them.

Han Sen fired at the Destroyer Wolf with Blow Blood. The blood light shone, and the Destroyer Wolf dodged. The mountain behind the wolf wasn’t so lucky. The trace of blood light ravaged the mountain, and that power was mesmerizing.

“That is Blow Blood… No way…” Ghost Eye opened its eyes and mouth wide, and it looked like it had just eaten a fly.

It had been kept Blow Blood for a long time, so it knew the geno core perfectly well. It could easily identify the weapon in Han Sen’s hands. It tried to console itself that Han Sen might be wielding some other geno core.

After a short while, Ghost Eye saw the power of Blow Blood just as described in the legends, and the creature couldn’t lie to himself anymore.

“D*mn. That’s Blow Blood. Is that b*stard the master of the geno core? How did he activate it?” Ghost Eye was so upset that it started to see red. Its eyes popped, and it watched Han Sen fight Destroyer Wolf in the sky.

“Little master, that seems to be Destroyer Wolf. What happened to him?” a super creature asked while staring at the Destroyer Wolf.

“Is that Destroyer Wolf? The rumors say that it’s a giant wolf, and it’s white.” Ghost Eye said, glancing at the wolf in the sky.

“I… I am not sure whether that is it or not…” The super creature hesitated.

The Destroyer Wolf now looked completely different than it had before, and the characteristics of its power had changed sharply as well. Even those who had seen it before couldn’t be sure if this was actually it.

Han Sen then yelled loudly, “Destroyer Wolf is here! It has eaten the Sacred egg!”

Han Sen’s voice wasn’t loud, but he was powerful, and his voice spread widely. Those like Goddess, who were already attracted by the ripples of power, were deeply upset upon hearing what Han Sen said. They flew across the sky and rushed toward Destroyer Wolf.

“You deserve to die, Destroyer Wolf!” Goddess’s face turned pale with rage. She also saw the power of destruction coming from the Destroyer Wolf, so she didn’t have any doubts anymore. She rushed toward it with the super creatures following her.

“I’ve already obtained the most perfect and powerful genes. I will definitely rule the world in the future. If you want to make yourself my enemy, you’re the one that deserves to die.” Destroyer Wolf couldn’t be more arrogant, and it now looked upon those from Sacred shelter with disdain. Its powers of space and berserk death combined in its body, and it wanted to fight the five enemies all at once and kill them all.

Instead of fighting Destroyer Wolf, Han Sen quickly escaped from the battlefield. He landed on a mountain in the distance to watch the fight.

All the powerful creatures nearby rushed toward the fight after hearing what had happened. They all gathered to watch the fight between Destroyer Wolf and Goddess’s group.

All four of the super creatures beside Goddess were renowned beings who had impressive reputations in Sacred shelter, but now, they were all simultaneously suppressed by the Destroyer Wolf. They had to retreat again and again, and it seemed that they were not the Destroyer Wolf’s match.

Xu Mi had staid beside Rolling Dragon Lake all along, and he refused to leave. He saw Destroyer Wolf and a strange creature rush out of the lake, but he didn’t see Han Sen. He was kind of worried.

Just as he wanted to enter the water to see if Han Sen had run into some danger, he saw Bao’er exit the water and jump to the shore.

“Bao’er, where is my teacher?” asked Xu Mi to Bao’er.

“Father still has something to do down there. He told me to tell you that you don’t need to worry about him, and don’t go into the water,” Bao’er said, blinking her eyes.

Xu Mi felt relieved, and he turned to watch the fight in the sky.

“Anyone who helps me kill Destroyer Wolf will be greatly rewarded by Sacred shelter,” yelled Goddess. There were five of them fighting one Destroyer Wolf, yet they were still not its match. The body of one of the super creatures was torn apart by the Destroyer Wolf, and its blood splashed across the sky.

“Don’t worry, Goddess. I’ll come help you.” Yu Miao rushed toward them with some spirits. Nobody knew what she was thinking as she aided Goddess.

Not only Yu Miao, but many great beings rushed toward the Destroyer Wolf. All of a sudden, there were terrifying lifeforces flowing everywhere.

After consuming the blood of the newborn, the Destroyer Wolf was indeed incredible. It was fighting so many creatures all by itself, yet nobody was able to do anything to it.

“You dare to antagonize me! I’ll kill you all today!” Destroyer Wolf yelled at the sky, and terrifying deathly power burst from the creature.

Han Sen watched in the distance for a while, yet those great beings were all crushed by Destroyer Wolf. Their attempts at entrapment were useless against an enemy that could travel through space.
