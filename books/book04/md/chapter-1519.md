  Wang Yuhang didn’t know what Han Sen wanted, but he still listened to him. He shouted at the ants, drawing them forward. “You rubbish ants! Come and get me.”

When Wang Yuhang yelled, all the Bloodthirsty Ants stopped in their place. They looked over to Wang Yuhang with their red eyes.

In the next second, the raging ants—king included—went on a rampage in Wang Yuhang’s direction.

“Han Sen, run!” Wang Yuhang began shouting.

“I am running!” Han Sen said without looking back.

Spirit Thirteen and Spirit Twelve, seeing the stampeding ants, suddenly found themselves frightened. Little Uncle’s powers were more effective than they had expected.

“He has a deathwish,” Spirit Thirteen said. He didn’t think Han Sen and Wang Yuhang could handle the rampaging ants.

But quickly, their faces changed. Han Sen had grabbed Wang Yuhang and run. The crowds of ants, like a dirty tide, could not catch up to them.

Spirit Thirteen and Spirit Twelve shifted forward so they could see, but then noticed something was wrong.

Spirit Twelve reacted first, and he said, “No! They are heading for our shelter.”

“They won’t be able to reach it, will they?” Spirit Thirteen looked nervous.

“There’s something wrong with this human: the ant king is unable to catch up with him. Let us return to the shelter. We can’t let them in!”

Spirit Twelve looked ill. He wanted to stop what he had put into motion, but he couldn’t keep up with Han Sen.

They realized it was too late. They were too slow, and they were already some distance away from Han Sen. It would be impossible for them to reach their destination before the human.

“They must be randomly running in a direction, yes? They cannot be deliberately heading for our shelter, surely.” Spirit Thirteen tried to comfort himself.

“Damn! This human had it all planned.” Spirit Twelve was not as naive as Spirit Thirteen was. His face looked terrible, and he continued the pursuit.

Han Sen, still holding onto Wang Yuhang, kept running. Wang Yuhang could see that the legions of ants were unable to catch up, and even the ant king had been left behind. He was excited by this, and it prompted him to taunt, “You uglies! You should be thankful God let you hideous things live. It’s fine if you don’t want to contribute, but now you’re going out of your way to kill Uncle Wang?! You filthy things are animals. God will flame-grill you into BBQ ants, and I’ll be munching your roasted corpses as I sip wine.”

If nasty looks could kill, the fierce eyes of the ants would have murdered Wang Yuhang many times over by now. Those eyes were bright like lanterns, flashing red as the ants skittered along with incredible speed.

This was especially true of the ant king. You’d think Wang Yuhang had personally murdered its family. It flew through the air and landed directly behind Han Sen, ready to attack Wang Yuhang.

“I’m going to die! I’m going to die!” Wang Yuhang screamed, wriggling and writhing with his hands and legs.

Han Sen summoned his God geno core to dodge the ant king.

Han Sen didn’t know Wang Yuhang was that attractive to creatures. It was as if the man’s taunts worked like stimulant-injectors, providing a surge of adrenaline to those that hounded him. Han Sen hadn’t planned on using his God geno core, but he now realized he had to.

The ant king’s claws flew towards Wang Yuhang’s face, seeking to strike his eyes out of their sockets.

But when Han Sen sped up again, the ant king was left behind once more. Wang Yuhang took this as another opportunity to provoke the insects.

“Little Ants, you want to touch this pretty face? For a man like me, my face is my fate. Even if you sold all your property, it wouldn’t be enough to cover a single one of my trips to the local make-up store.”

Han Sen kept running as Wang Yuhang did his best to provoke the ants. The ant army was fuming with rage, determined not to let them go.

Spirit Thirteen and Spirit Twelve looked both angry and hopeless. They couldn’t catch up with the ants, and the ants were getting closer and closer to their shelter.

Without a doubt, Han Sen was intending to attract the ants to the shelter. Seeing the raging hordes, they couldn’t imagine the horrors that might unfold when they reached there.

“Father, make them stop or our shelter will be no more!” Spirit Thirteen screamed.

“This is the only way.” Spirit Twelve gritted his teeth and summoned a few eggs that looked like ping-pong balls. He scattered them on the ground with clear unwillingness. The juice spread everywhere and he said, “I am going to make them pay.”

Spirit Twelve had used Bloodsnake Eggs. They were the babies of gemstone sacred-blood creatures. The taste could most certainly attract the ants. He used one to attract the ants to come for Han Sen in the first place. Otherwise, Little Uncle wouldn’t have been able to attract the creatures from such a great distance.

But Bloodsnakes were very precious, and Spirit Twelve hated that he had to use more.

But after he threw them, the ants had no reaction to them. They were still chasing after Han Sen.

“What happened?! Why didn’t the eggs work?” Spirit Thirteen’s face changed.

“Oh no! They made the ants angry. The egg smell alone won’t attract them.” Spirit Twelve ground his teeth harder, and then he lobbed out the remainder of his eggs at the horde of ants. He couldn’t afford to be stingy at this point, so he threw them all.

The Bloodsnake Eggs hit their shells, splashing juices all over the place.

Spirit Twelve thought this would get the attention of the ants for sure, but he never would have expected the ants to completely ignore them.

Even the ants that had egg juice on them did not care. They were still focused on chasing down Wang Yuhang.

“No! No!” Spirit Twelve and Spirit Thirteen screamed hopelessly.

The bunch of crazy ants after Han Sen and Wang Yuhang were now already at the shelter.

Han Sen arrived at the entrance and flew up top. Then, the ant king came forward to batter the gate.

Boom!

The ant king’s body broke down the gate, tossing it aside. Countless ants then swarmed inside.
