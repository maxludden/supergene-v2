<p>“Han Sen, look where you are.” Shadow Ghost raised the Wanjie
Rubix Cube that was in his hand. The stream from the Rubix cube was
still running. Han Sen could see the video, which showed him caught
in the screen of Shadow Ghost’s camera.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart leaped at the sight, and so he quickly tried to
fly out of the camera’s frame. He kept an eye on the Rubix cube’s
stream as he flew, but he soon realized that no matter what
direction he flew, there would be no escape from that place. The
video stream showed that he was always dead center of the camera’s
screen.</p>
<p>“It is useless! In my shadow area, you are just an image. And if
I rip this image, your body will be torn just like it,” Shadow
Ghost boasted. Then he damaged a corner of the image that showed a
bit of Han Sen’s hair.</p>
<p>The moment the image of Han Sen’s hair was damaged, Han Sen’s
actual hair was given a trim. He didn’t know how it had happened,
but there was nothing he could do to prevent it.</p>
<p>The people that were watching the stream felt a chill. They knew
Shadow Ghost could enter virtual images, but they didn’t know he
had a power like this.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a chill. If Shadow Ghost trapped them in a
picture, killing them would be as simple as damaging a camera.</p>
<p>Some of the deified elites who were watching the video nodded in
approval. They were impressed with Shadow Ghost’s might.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not going to kill you.” Another creepy smile
crossed Shadow Ghost’s face. “You’re worth more alive. I’m going to
take you with me to the Extreme King. You might be my best chance
of becoming deified.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was looking at Shadow Ghost, who was outside the image,
with an expressionless face. He said, “Do you really think you can
capture me this way?”</p>
<p>Shadow Ghost replied with confidence, saying, “My area has no
limiting range. Furthermore, you are just a King. Even if you were
deified, you couldn’t escape the boundaries of my area.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen said. His left eye then flashed with a red
light, and his body turned into a red shadow.</p>
<p>“Where is he?” Shadow Ghost’s face changed. Han Sen had
disappeared from the picture.</p>
<p>“Where is he?” The people who were watching the stream were
shocked, too. They hadn’t seen how Han Sen had managed to get out
of the picture’s frame.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Shadow Ghost’s sudden scream drew everyone’s attention
back to him.</p>
<p>One of Shadow Ghost’s eyes was bleeding. It seemed as if some
scary power had penetrated his eye and sent a jolt of pain straight
to his brain.</p>
<p>Han Sen was standing behind Shadow Ghost. His Thunder God Spike
was dripping with blood.</p>
<p>“Next time you want to kill me, don’t talk so much crap.” Han
Sen swung the Thunder God Spike, flicking away the blood. He took
the Wanjie Rubix Cube and flew away without looking back.</p>
<p>Shadow Ghost’s body fell through the emptiness of space. It
appeared like he had been killed.</p>
<p>Every noble watching the video stared in mute silence. Shadow
Ghost was a nightmarish enemy, but he had been one-hit-killed. The
viewers were having difficulty wrapping their heads around the
idea.</p>
<p>Most of the Kings, Dukes, and nobles were unable to discern just
how Han Sen had managed to kill Shadow Ghost, though. That was what
scared the audience the most.</p>
<p>Someone who had just become a King had managed to kill a
half-deified warrior as quickly as they might kill a chicken or a
cow. It was hard to believe.</p>
<p>The video stream suddenly went black. The spectacle was over.
Many of the viewers were still reeling from the shock, though. They
hadn’t yet figured out how to react.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned off the Wanjie Rubix Cube and flew forward. He
wanted to take a look at the items Shadow Ghost and Barr had been
carrying, but he didn’t have time.</p>
<p>A scary presence was coming this way. Han Sen could sense that
if it wasn’t a deified elite coming for him, then it was a very
terrifying half-deified being. It was most likely someone that he
couldn’t compete with on his own.</p>
<p>Of course, not long after Han Sen flew away, a shadow appeared
where Han Sen had been. That person looked at the dead Shadow Ghost
and the frozen Barr. He waved his hand, bringing out a swordlight.
He used it to break Han Sen’s ice, freeing Barr and the others.</p>
<p>Once Barr and Thunder were freed, they caught sight of the new
man and began to tremble.</p>
<p>“Lando!” Shadow, from the race of the Storm, screamed. He looked
frightened.</p>
<p>“Were you guys fighting Han Sen?” the person called Lando asked,
his voice stern.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Shadow answered. He was very scared of Lando, but he
still answered truthfully.</p>
<p>After hearing Shadow’s answer, Lando chased after Han Sen, his
body moving so fast that the space around him seemed to groan.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe Lando is here. No matter how strong Han Sen is,
that is one opponent that he won’t be able to escape.” Thunder
finished his statement with a very long sigh.</p>
<p>“The traitor that the Dragons hate the most. The Inverse Dragon
Lando might not be deified, but he has killed enough of them. And
they were deified Dragons, of all things. A guy like him can’t be
dealt with by a King.” Shadow’s mood had mellowed somewhat.</p>
<p>“There are many elites in this universe, and there are many
half-deified elites. But the scariest half-deified in existence has
to be Lando,” Thunder said. After a moment of thought, he went on
to say, “Although the half-deifieds of the Extreme King are
powerful, this guy could fight an entire generation of them. If I
had to pick an enemy, I would prefer to choose a half-deified of
the Extreme King over Lando. Lando is just too evil.”</p>
<p>Even Barr looked shaken. He wasn’t scared of anything, and he
would go anywhere. But aside from deified elites, there were two
people he feared: the Inverse Dragon Lando and Yu Shanxin of Sky
Palace.</p>
<p>If it was anyone else, he’d chase them down to the ends of the
universe. Either that or he’d kill the person right where they
were. But after seeing Lando, Barr had yet to say a single word. He
just watched Lando go after Han Sen. He didn’t dare follow.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is dead,” Barr said to himself. Then, he flew out of
the Tianxia System. He no longer planned to chase Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew through the clouds at full speed. He kept changing
direction, and he erased his scent and trail as he fled. But still,
he couldn’t shake the entity chasing him from behind.</p>
<p>Han Sen could also feel that whatever was pursuing him was
gaining. The gap between them was closing.</p>
<p>When Han Sen finally reached the edge of the purple clouds, he
saw someone emerge from the clouds behind it. The being was coming
his way, and it was coming fast.</p>
<p>“One of the Dragon?” Han Sen murmured. The man’s Dragon horns
were particularly large, but he didn’t have wings. He looked like a
Dragon hybrid.</p>
