    <p>
      Han Sen did not plead for Queen to stay. After all, what had happened
      earlier was far too embarrassing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;After I unlock the first gene lock, where should I go to find
      you?&#8221; Han Sen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Send a message to Pingqing. She will let you know,&#8221; Queen
      answered as she exited the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      After she stepped out of the room, she stopped and said, &#8220;In regards
      to what happened earlier, if word of it gets out, you are a dead
      man.&#8221; Then she was gone for good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Queen leave, Han Sen thought about all the words she had spoken.
      Clearly, Queen herself had unlocked her first gene lock. She also said the
      term us, which meant she wasn&#8217;t hunting alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      A powerful character like her needed others on the same level to go on a
      hunt? There was only one possibility Han Sen could think of. They were
      hunting a super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I wonder if they have killed a super creature before.&#8221; Han
      Sen was disturbed at this revelation, but he hadn&#8217;t yet unlocked his
      gene lock. He simply wasn&#8217;t qualified to join them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like I must hurry up with the Dongxuan Sutra, despite my
      inability to rush it.&#8221; Han Sen continued to sit where he was,
      thinking things over. If he wanted to unlock his first gene lock, the
      quickest way to do so was through mastery of Jadeskin. But he was afraid
      of learning that skill to its full extent, due to his fear of becoming
      like the cruel people of the Xue family. It was a difficult decision to
      mull over.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have been learning Dongxuan Sutra for so long, perhaps Jadeskin
      has been purified. Let&#8217;s give it a go!&#8221; Han Sen really wanted
      to see if the people with Queen were truly off to hunt a super creature.
      And he wanted to know if they had killed one previously. For this, he
      thought it was worth the risk of going back to Jadeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he already had Dongxuan Sutra, and if there were any issues while
      learning Jadeskin, he could always use Dongxuan Sutra to alleviate them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But before he continued learning Jadeskin, he returned to the snowy basin
      to collect the last red mushroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      He cut it into thin slices and used it to train Jade-Sun Force. Although
      he continued to suffer a burning sensation, it was something he could keep
      under control.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he absorbed the energy of the red mushroom, his kidney shined and
      his power felt limitless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart felt strange, however. Although the Jade-Sun Force
      he learnt was correct, it now seemed a touch different than before. There
      was a magical, purple light shining alongside it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That purple light must be the power Queen shoved into me. It must
      be the power she gained from unlocking her first gene lock, too. But how
      can I use that to my advantage? I am not sure if this is a good thing or a
      bad thing, since it seems to be trapped in my kidney now.&#8221; Han Sen
      was lost in thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever the case might be, there didn&#8217;t seem to be any negative
      consequences to its presence. After consuming the rest of the mushroom,
      the Jade-Sun Force was finally complete. Both of his kidneys now shone
      like stoves, providing endless power for Han Sen 24/7.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was not sure if it was affected by the Jade-Sun Force, but Han
      Sen&#8217;s Heresy Mantra had also completed its first stage &#8220;Long
      Live.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past, whenever Han Sen used Heresy Mantra, if he used it for too
      long, his heart could not withstand it. It&#8217;d end up damaging his
      body. But after learning Long Live, not only was Heresy Mantra more
      powerful, he could use it infinitely without damage being dealt to his
      body.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With Jade-Sun Force and Long Live, it&#8217;s as if I have infinite
      power. Any difficult skills I learn can be used indefinitely without the
      need for a break.&#8221; Han Sen, after learning all this, became really
      happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was almost like a cheat. Although it felt like nothing special when
      dormant, using it felt extremely powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was just like Yi Dongmu. When he used wind strike, he concentrated all
      the power in his body into one fell strike. After he used the strike,
      there&#8217;d be a long recovery time.
    </p>

    <p>
      But right now, Han Sen was different. He could use wind strike like
      normal, over and over without rest. He did not need a break.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was like playing a videogame where people had to gather power to
      unleash their ultimate ability. But Han Sen had glitched it so he could
      use his super ability over and over.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jade-Sun Force and Long Live made a frightening combination. Han Sen was
      shaken.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen did not know how to use wind strike. But that did not matter,
      because of the most powerful burst-power skill there was: Thunderknife. In
      the past, he would suffer a cooldown of at least eight seconds before
      being able to cast it again. Now, he could use it over and over.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks as if I&#8217;ll have to modify Dual some more.&#8221; Han
      Sen was overjoyed, despite the extra trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of his vitality, his Dual skill had been lacking in certain
      departments. His vitality and power could never remain high enough to
      support the demands of the skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now things were different. Han Sen could use Dual to its full extent.
      Every skill was an ultimate power skill; and now, his damage output would
      most likely be tripled. It would be far easier for him to kill the Twin
      Spirit like this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was of the mind to do it, and so he did. Off he went to modify his
      Dual skill once again. He wanted to make it into an ultimate skill. He
      exchanged five S-rank Saint Hall licenses for five evolver-class powerful
      sword skills. He borrowed the techniques inside and implemented them in
      his Dual skill, modifying them so each skill performed was an ultimate
      one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dual skill now was two sword skills combined with over a hundred
      movements. After vigorous modification, that number was brought down to
      fifty. After even more extensive work, that number was brought down to
      twelve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those two sets of twelve movements were the skills that dealt the purest,
      most concentrated amounts of damage. Every move had its own special trait,
      but when they were all combined and cast at once, he didn&#8217;t believe
      any opponent could withstand such a devastating attack, no matter their
      power or level lead on Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is the Dual skill I have always wanted. Dealing with the Twin
      Spirit should no longer be difficult. But I wonder if Qi Xiuwen has
      managed to successfully convince Li Xinglun and Philip yet.&#8221; Han Sen
      could no longer wait to attack the royal shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen had faced much resistance in his attempts to convince Li Xinglun
      and Philip. This was because he was unable to solve their silver beetles
      problem. Li Xinglun and Philip did not dare attack a random royal shelter
      while under the thumb of their current threat.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, Qi Xiuwen had to pay a heavy price to convince Li Xinglun and Philip
      to agree and join the attack on the royal shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The ice field will belong to me, Qi Xiuwen!&#8221; Qi Xiuwen
      returned to the Blackgod Shelter with much excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking the royal shelter and becoming the boss of the ice fields was an
      exciting prospect for him. And a record like this was sure to paint him in
      a different light in his father&#8217;s eyes. Maybe he&#8217;d even be
      able to inherit Dong Lin.
