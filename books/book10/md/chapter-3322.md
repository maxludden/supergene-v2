  Han Sen looked at the 33 skies. He did not plan on going in. He turned around and went to Space Garden.

Regardless of whether Qin Xiu and the other guys were there in the 33 skies, if he went in now, he might not be able to earn any benefits. Even if he made a blood path and went before the geno tablet, conquering the geno tablet was not an easy thing to accomplish.

Han Sen’s Break World-class Super God Spirit mode was not very useful before the geno tablet. If it was not for using the 24-stroke geno spell password, he would have died inside the geno tablet.

When Han Sen returned to Space Garden, he noticed the Very High and those from Sky Palace had come there to settle.

The Extreme King, Dragon, Destroyed, and other high races had not incurred as much destruction. They had managed to hold onto their homelands, but they still sent people to Space Garden so they could hold discussions about how they planned to fix the universe.

The reason for that was because they did not have as many life souls attacking them, and they had the protection of the God Spirits. There were God Spirits in their races helping them to kill the Break World beasts. The damage and devastation they incurred were minimized a great deal.

In Space Garden, the Very High and Sky Palace did not believe in the gods. They did not pray to the God Spirits either. So, they did not receive any help from the God Spirits.

The Very High and Sky Palace co-operated with God Spirits, but they did not believe in gods.

Plus, those three places had many life souls. They had suffered the most damage. In the end, only Space Garden was able to hold out. The Very High gave up Outer Sky while the Sky gave up Sky Palace.

Fortunately, the Very High and the Sky were friendly. They did not have many people, so they stayed in Space Garden. They gathered their resources and strength to fight the changes now affecting their universe.

Sky Palace Leader saw Han Sen return, so he asked “Han Sen, what happened to the 33 skies?”

Han Sen saw that the Very High people and Space Garden people were looking at him, so he told them the story once. “The geno tablet in the 33 skies is a creature belonging to the God Chaos Party’s old leader. Right now, it has returned to its origin. It has become an item that no one knows. Any creature can become its master, so all the scary creatures from the main and reverse universes, including God Spirits, want to assert themselves as the geno tablet’s new master.”

Of course, Han Sen did not tell them he was the one who had made the 33 skies return to origin.

“People say treasure is owned by those who fight for it,” a Very High elder said. “Perhaps there is still a chance.”

Sky Palace Leader Zhang Xuandao lifted his lips and said, “According to the rules of the Very High, all the treasure is related to the Very High.”

The Very High elder looked rather upset as he asked, “What do you mean?”

The Very High and the Sky hailed from the same origin, but they did not like each other. There were some disagreements between them. Even though this elder practiced Very High Sense and had almost reached Very High’s Forget Love level, whenever he saw Zhang Xuandao, he was a bit intense.

Zhang Xuandao smiled and said, “Good words. The power of you Very High people is against the sky. You are stronger than the Break World beasts in the thirty-three skies. You can try your luck. It is a shame we Sky Palace students are all too weak and cannot even enter the 33 skies. We cannot try something that you call luck. The treasure will be in the hands of you guys, the Very High.”

After hearing Zhang Xuandao’s mocking words, everyone knew he was implying that they did not have the power to breach the 33 skies. They would be unable to control the geno tablet.

Han Sen could not be bothered listening to them. He did not plan on going to the 33 skies yet. He got up and prepared to leave the meeting room. He was looking for Ji Yanran and Ling’er.

“Han Sen, our research has yet to yield a result,” the Very High elder said. “How could you just leave?”

“I am old. There is nothing I can do. You guys talk to Littleflower. Just keep me informed when you figure something out. I will do whatever you guys need me to.” Han Sen patted Littleflower on the shoulder. “Son, you have grown up, and your father is old. I am going to go see your mother. Take care of your little sister. You will be the one in charge of the family’s safety.”

“Dad…” Littleflower looked as if he was going to smile and cry at Han Sen at the same time.

Han Sen whispered this into Littleflower’s ears, “Good luck. Do it if you can. If you can’t, then you should run. It is fine if you cannot achieve victory. It is better than dying.”

What he said was so quiet, but the top-class elites were still able to hear him. Many of the elites of all the other races felt weird hearing it.

“You guys keep talking, but I am leaving.” After saying that, Han Sen left the meeting room.

When Han Sen left the room, Yisha walked out, too. Han Sen asked her, “Teacher, are you getting used to living here?”

“It is not too shabby.” Yisha looked at Han Sen and said, “Dollar, you didn’t forget we still have a grudge match to settle.”

“Teacher, why are you doing this?” Han Sen asked. “Killing each other is not nice.”

“Watch me.” Yisha suddenly jumped. She pulled out her knife and drew it near Han Sen’s neck.

Han Sen’s reaction was very fast. Yisha was one of the top elites of the whole geno universe, but she hadn’t broken the world yet. She was not a threat to Han Sen.

She was Han Sen’s teacher, so he did not take the knife. He took a step back and dodged the knife that was coming to cut his head off.

Yisha used Teeth Knife and kept slashing at Han Sen. She did not use all of her power, but the knife mind and the knife skill were the best knife talents she could ever strive to achieve.

Han Sen had to admit that her knife mind was almost as good as his.

She used Teeth Knife, but Yisha’s knife was unable to touch Han Sen. Yisha pulled her knife back. She looked at Han Sen and said, “There is nothing else I can teach you. Do not ever think about calling me teacher again.”

“If you are a teacher for one day, then you are a teacher forever…”

Before Han Sen finished, Yisha interrupted him. “I am not that old, and you are not that young. Just call me Yisha.”

After that, Yisha ignored Han Sen. She went back to where the Rebate were living.

Han Sen felt a wry smile develop. He watched Yisha leave. He then returned to his house in Space Garden.

Ji Yanran was holding Ling’er while watching anime. Seeing Han Sen come back, Ling’er flew out of Ji Yanran’s arms and landed against Han Sen’s chest with her arms around his neck.

“Dad, why are you only back now?” Ling’er asked while acting all cute. “Ling’er has missed you so much. I am so hungry.”

“Dear Daughter, what do you want to eat? I will make it for you.” Han Sen happily patted Ling’er on the head.

“I want to eat dragon meat from Green Planet. I want to drink coconut juice from Long Ka Nan Planet…” Ling’er lifted up her little fingers as she spoke.

“You didn’t miss me. You only miss my wallet.” Han Sen rubbed Ling’er’s small nose and smiled.

“Dad, you should not rub my nose. Mother said the nose needs to be tall to be pretty. If you keep rubbing it, it will not grow tall and will look bad. Then, no man will want to marry me.” Ling’er used her hands to protect her nose.

“Mother is lying to you. Look at your mother’s nose. It is not that tall, but she still managed to find your father, who is a good man.” Han Sen looked all cocky.

Ling’er looked at Ji Yanran. She then looked at Han Sen. “I will stick to protecting my nose.”

“What is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen realized what she meant and started to tickle Ling’er.
