<h2>Stream of Swords</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2410</h3>

<p>The huge furnace’s appearance caught Han Sen completely off
guard. He quickly shoved as much power as possible into his
Dongxuan Area. It was impossible for him to completely stop the
Swords from the Furnace and the fire area. This giant copper
furnace was a genuine half-deified beast. It was probably only one
small step away from being deified. It was almost stronger than
Dragon One.</p>
<p>But, thankfully, it didn’t have substance chains, so it couldn’t
be a real deified.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Area couldn’t completely seal power, but it still
affected the universal cogwheels. It made the universal cogwheels
spin slower, which led to a reduction in power.</p>
<p>Plus, with the Move Mountain Area, Han Sen wasn’t really afraid
of that stream of swords, though they did look very scary.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen waved the Sword from the Furnace that was in his hand
and knocked away a bunch of the raining swords that were coming
dangerously close. But ultimately, the sword rain was too much to
defend against, and each one of those swords wielded a frightening
power. Each attack came with the strength of a half-deified
creature.</p>
<p>A blade hit Han Sen, cutting open the Dongxuan Armor.
Fortunately, Move Mountain Area was able to absorb a lot of power
from the attacks it had sustained. It was able to shrug off the
attack of a half-deified being. The sword rain could leave deep
scratches in the Dongxuan Armor, but it couldn’t pierce all the way
through.</p>
<p>Blade after blade slammed into the armor. It was like a flash
flood. Each one kept left a scrape across the armor’s surface. The
strikes got dangerously close to Han Sen’s flesh, and he almost
yelled out in alarm.</p>
<p>The waterfall of swords kept pounding Han Sen’s body. Under such
violent attacks, this King seemed just as threatening as a deified
xenogeneic.</p>
<p>While the deified bug Han Sen had fought was incredibly
powerful, it didn’t have any ranged attacks, so the Kings with Han
Sen still had a chance to run away.</p>
<p>But beneath this sword rain that blanketed the sky, there was
nowhere to run. No matter how strong a person’s defenses were,
getting continuously struck by that sword waterfall would
eventually lead to him getting perforated. It was the same
principle Han Sen had been counting on when he attacked the copper
furnace.</p>
<p>But this stream of attacks wasn’t made up of water; it was
composed of swords wielding half-deified power.</p>
<p>If it was anyone else, with any different type of area power,
they would have died within the first messy barrage of that stream
of swords. Even their bones would have been crushed.</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen had his Move Mountain Area for protection. As
all those sword streams came down on the Dongxuan Armor, they
provided an incredible buff to the armor’s defensive
properties.</p>
<p>As long as the first few attacks didn’t break the Move Mountain
Area, using the Dongxuan Armor as the carrier made him
invincible.</p>
<p>The small copper furnace flew over to the big copper furnace.
The mouth of the furnace kept spitting out fire as it made a
pitiful whining noise. It seemed to be telling the big copper
furnace of its woes.</p>
<p>After the big copper furnace heard what it was told, it became
enraged. It released a wave of green fire that looked like it could
incinerate a planet. The fire area came down and covered the Swords
from the Furnaces.</p>
<p>The swords received the fire area’s buff, and their powers rose
to a terrifying level.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Dragon One was flying through space. After Dia Robber left, he
went around, following in the direction Han Sen had gone. He kept
on the move, but he didn’t see Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been traveling fast, clearly intending to kill as
many xenogeneics as possible. Dragon One and Dia Robber had talked
for a while before going their separate ways. It made sense that
Dragon One had yet to catch up with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Moving forward more leads to the core furnace zone. The
strongest core furnace is half-way to being deified. It doesn’t
have its own substance chain yet, but it is stronger than most
half-deified beings. And there are scary swords inside that
furnace. Many Kings and half-deifieds have confronted it, but none
of them have been able to kill it. I wonder why Dollar is headed
there. Is he going to fight the core furnace alone?” Dragon One
looked forward and frowned.</p>
<p>He was still traveling forward, but he suddenly glanced over his
shoulder. He saw a shadow coming toward him.</p>
<p>Dragon One watched it suspiciously, and when he saw the person
clearly, he raised an eyebrow in surprise. “Dia Robber?”</p>
<p>“What a coincidence. We meet again so soon!” Dia Robber smiled
and flew towards Dragon One, stopping right before him.</p>
<p>Dragon One and Dia Robber looked at each other. They were both
smart, so they both knew what the other wanted.</p>
<p>“Dia Robber, if you quit now, we will leave Exquisite Mountain.
It will belong to you and the other Destroyed,” Dragon One offered
quietly.</p>
<p>Dia Robber laughed. “Dragon One, give me Dollar. We do not want
Exquisite Mountain. The Dragon can keep it.”</p>
<p>“It looks like we will have to employ our own tricks,” Dragon
One said with a feral grin.</p>
<p>“No matter what, Dollar will belong to the Destroyed,” Dia
Robber responded coldly.</p>
<p>“Even if that is what you want, he might not go with you,”
Dragon One countered.</p>
<p>Dia Robber started to say something, but then he noticed some
green flames far in the distance. The light reflected off of clouds
of dust that had risen from the turmoil, and countless swords could
be seen flying against the dusty backdrop.</p>
<p>“Dollar went to the core furnaces?” Dia Robber’s face
changed.</p>
<p>Dragon One frowned. “It seems that way.”</p>
<p>Dia Robber’s face changed, but in the end, he laughed and looked
at Dragon One. He said, “He really dares to go in there? Does he
want to kill the core furnace? Not bad. Now we can gauge how strong
he is. You will want to know as well, right?”</p>
<p>Dragon One had a wry smile. He and Dia Robber were thinking the
same thing. They both wanted to use Dollar’s powers to fight the
core area’s deified xenogeneics.</p>
<p>The core area’s deified xenogeneics were a very large prize.
Because no deified could enter this place, claiming that prize was
a very difficult process.</p>
<p>Many different elites of varying races had attempted to bring
down core deifieds, but they all had failed. Even the Extreme King
had to rally many half-deified people to pull off such a hunt.</p>
<p>The Dragon and the Destroyed had achieved some modicum of
success in the past, but they had to rally many half-deifieds in
their attempts. That also meant they lost a lot of people in the
battles, and when the benefits were split among those who remained,
there was never much for each person. Nothing to compensate for the
danger and losses incurred.</p>
<p>Therefore, over the past few years, there hadn’t been many
chances to hunt deified xenogeneics.</p>
<p>The strength of deified xenogeneics varied widely, and the
weaker variety were generally targeted by hunters. Once those
deified xenogeneics were killed, only the strong deified
xenogeneics remained, and over time, those monsters became even
stronger. Killing them was now a much harder endeavor than it had
once been.</p>
<p>Like the weird bug they recently encountered; it was a powerful
deified xenogeneic. Even if they gathered many half-deified elites,
there’d be a very low chance of actually taking out that horrifying
creature.</p>
