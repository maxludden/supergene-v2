<h2>Trapped in Jade Lion Valley</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3054</h3>

<p>The king class Jade Lion king was not scary to Peaceful and the
others, even if the Jade Lion king was already an adult. It was
just a strong king class gene race.</p>
<p>Since they had come prepared, they could fight a god class adult
gene race. And this was just a king class gene race.</p>
<p>The Jade Lion was a special gene race. Ordinary gene races loved
living alone or living in small enclaves of two to three others at
a time. The Jade Lion was a gene race that loved to live with
others. A group of king class Jade Lion was able to bring about
damage that far exceeded what a god class gene race could
bring.</p>
<p>Peaceful knew they would probably die there, so they had no
choice but to fight until their dying breath or survive. It was
fortunate she knew Han Sen was powerful. She did not let the fire
of hope be fully extinguished in her heart.</p>
<p>She bolstered the courage in her heart, looked down, and made a
command. “Ghost Kill, you and I remain at the back. Zhao Jue Ye,
you guys protect the few misters. Han Sen and Qiu Shan…”</p>
<p>Peaceful stopped when she said that. She was frozen. She was so
angry she started shaking. She cared nothing for her image as she
began scolding.</p>
<p>She was supposed to make Han Sen and Ouyang Qiu Shan cleave a
path forward for them. With the strongest two people in the front
forging a path for them, that would get them out of the Jade Lion
valley. Thus, there would have been a higher chance of them
surviving the dangers of the forest. When she looked at Ouyang Qiu
Shan, she saw he was using his wind-winged snake’s flying ability
to quickly flee and save his own hide. He flew out of the valley
and escaped.</p>
<p>Peaceful wanted to curse him so badly. When she went to the
Ouyang family to visit the Ouyang leader and Ouyang Qiu Shan heard
she was going to Big God Mountain, he was passionate about lending
his services. He called her “big sister” this and “big sister”
that. He had begged Peaceful to take him on the trip.</p>
<p>Peaceful was asked by the leader of the Ouyang family to take
him, so she took him with her against her will. She tried her best
to be nice to him. If it were not for him, though, none of this
would have happened to them.</p>
<p>Who would have known Ouyang Qiu Shan would smack his butt and
run off? He did not care if they ended up dead or alive.</p>
<p>Peaceful’s heart was sinking low. In the next second, her
expression suddenly changed. Ouyang Qiu Shan was flying out of the
Jade Lion valley, but the Jade Lions could not fly. They were not
stopping him.</p>
<p>The purple light shadow flashed. They saw the purple-haired
monkey was like a bolt of purple lightning. It managed to catch up
with Ouyang Qiu Shan.</p>
<p>Ouyang Qiu Shan felt something was wrong. He turned around. The
purple-haired monkey latched onto him from the back and was on his
body. It was going to bite his head.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Ouyang Qiu Shan’s scream echoed throughout the valley.
The purple-haired monkey’s fangs pierced into his head. It was like
a demon biting his head hard.</p>
<p>Everyone saw Ouyang Qiu Shan’s body become smaller in a very
short amount of time. Within a second, he was sucked until only a
flap of snake-scaled skin remained.</p>
<p>The purple-haired monkey used its claws to grab Ouyang Qiu
Shan’s skin. Another claw pierced inside the mountain wall’s stone.
It pinned Ouyang Qiu Shan’s skin to the mountain’s wall just like
what had happened to Old Nine’s skin. The limbs were stretched as
it was pinned to the wall, and blood smeared the area.</p>
<p>The purple-haired monkey was still nearby. Its eyes looked
weird. It stared at Peaceful and the others weirdly laughing. Its
face looked like it was laughing, but it made people feel a chill
when they saw it.</p>
<p>Everyone realized that the purple-haired monkey’s speed was
faster than that of the wind-winged snake’s combined with Ouyang
Qiu Shan. It feigned weakness earlier to lure them to Jade Lion
valley.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a chill. The chill went down their spines and into
their hearts. Regardless if they were able to escape the attack of
the Jade Lions, even if they did survive, it was unlikely they
could escape the hunt of the evil purple-haired monkey.</p>
<p>“That can’t actually be a blood ghost spirit, can it?” Everyone
started to feel scared.</p>
<p>Reality did not have an obligation to let them take their time
with all of this. The Jade Lion group was roaring and coming after
them. They blocked the way they could not proceed.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, Ghost Kill, you guys, clear a path together!” Peaceful
shouted. “Me and Zhao Jue Ye will stay at the rear! The others can
protect the misters! We will sprint out this way!” Zhao Jue Ye and
the others were not happy that Peaceful had brought someone like
that there, but they knew now was not the time to complain. They
listened to her commands, formed a group, and started to leave.</p>
<p>Han Sen used both hands to hold the metal pillar. He swung it.
Seven or eight of the jade lions coming at him were swept away. He
did not kill them, but he made all their mouths bleed.</p>
<p>Everyone was frozen, but they were instantly happy. “Brother
Han, you are so powerful!”</p>
<p>Han Sen only smiled in response. He clutched the giant metal
pillar and swung it around. The 12-foot-long metal pillar was swung
again. He danced like a tiger. The king class jade lions did not
dare come close. He formed a path for everyone.</p>
<p>“Brother Han’s power is like a god has descended. I wonder what
gene race you have combined with.”</p>
<p>“Brother Han has god power. He can be more than a city
leader.”</p>
<p>“I have been living for so many years. Today, I know what a real
god power is.”</p>
<p>The men were shocked, and they complimented him profusely.
Although they were just licking his boots, seeing Han Sen was that
powerful really did surprise them.</p>
<p>Everyone had been scared. They were trapped by the lion group,
but now things were not looking so glum. Even Zhao Jue Ye smiled at
Peaceful and asked, “Lady Peace, where did you locate such a huge
noble? It is no wonder you have dared go to Big God Mountain.”</p>
<p>Peaceful presented a wry smile but did not say a word. She
looked at Ouyang Qiu Shan’s skin on the wall and felt terrible. She
thought, “Ouyang Qiu Shan deserved what happened to him after what
he did. This cannot be blamed on anyone, but how do I explain this
to the Ouyang family?”</p>
<p>The powerful jade lion group was suppressed by Han Sen. They did
not dare try to stop them. Seeing everyone was going out of the
jade lion valley, there were some weird screams like a baby crying
again.</p>
<p>There was a purple shadow flashing through space. The
purple-haired monkey was at the entrance of the valley. It bared
its fangs and screamed weirdly. Its eyes looked extremely
weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care much for it. He swung his metal pillar and
chased away the rest of the lion horde. He hurried their race to
the valley’s exit.</p>
<p>The purple-haired monkey put its middle finger into its mouth
and bit down. He then pointed the middle finger at the ground.
Purple blood dripped down into the valley’s soil.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were wondering what it was doing.
Suddenly, the whole jade lion valley started to shake. The Jade
Lions started to behave like small, scared cats. They ran off. They
were instantly all gone.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The valley’s ground broke. A giant head came out from the place
where the purple-haired monkey leaked its blood. There was a giant,
weird snake. What came out of the ground was 30 feet tall. It was
as thick as a barrel.</p>
<p>The snake looked very weird. Along with its scaly skin, its head
had a horn that was crystal and like jade.</p>
