    <p>
      The Yu family spirits were going to ask the approaching army what was
      going on. But before Han Sen was even close enough to open a dialogue, a
      punch was being thrown their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the demonic force approaching, the Yu family spirits became
      enraged. They commanded all their troops to attack the Fallen Slaughter
      Han Sen had become.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outer Sky Shelter had existed in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary for a long
      time. The occupants there were not afraid of Fallen Slaughter or the
      creatures that hailed from Wind Song Desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the holy lights come shining forth from the spirits, Han Sen did
      not dare make contact with them. Outer Sky Shelter was home to many
      elites, and Han Sen had seen what had happened to Fallen Slaughter—he
      wasn’t going to allow himself to suffer the same fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen gathered his might and flew upwards. He dodged the attacks,
      letting the crystal shoe carry him into their shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the Wind Song Desert creature horde were blazing red. Without
      restraint, they all followed Han Sen inside. This also brought him some
      relief. He had been worried the creatures would turn tail and flee once he
      penetrated the shelter. If Han Sen had gone inside all alone, he would
      probably have been killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, his worries did not manifest. When the creatures poured into
      the shelter, the Outer Sky elites were pushed back and forced to split
      their attention between fighting all the different creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earth trembled as that horrible fight began. Frightening powers
      coursed through every inch of the atmosphere, and the shelter became a
      chaotic mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen ran into the shelter, he found a powerful spirit standing in
      front of him. It was from the Yu family. It was stronger than Yu Miao,
      indicating it was one of the shelter’s elites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen threw a punch towards it, prompting the spirit to give him a
      disapproving look. It pulled out an item that looked like a shining ring,
      and the demonic force Han Sen unleashed was absorbed inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the ring absorbed that force, it continued flying towards Han Sen
      and arrived just in front of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s arm then shone black, and he summoned his Overbearing Shield to
      deflect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the halo came against the shield, a metallic sound rung out The
      shield displayed its signature overbearing, making the ring ricochet back
      at the initial caster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit was quickly given a shock. He used both of his hands to try and
      catch that halo, and when he did, he was sent flying backward. He crashed
      into a tower, causing pieces of it to collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two beasts and three spirits blocked Han Sen’s way next. They combined
      arms to go against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could not change his direction, though. The only way he could go
      was forward. He put all his strength into his shield, making it increase
      in size. After it grew, he used it to block every incoming attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Fallen Slaughter’s mighty body, Han Sen was able to hold the
      Overbearing Shield effectively, even while it was in its ultimate form. It
      wasn’t difficult at all anymore.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s body was sent back dozens of meters. The spirits and creatures
      that hit the shield were all sent rocketing away, too, coughing up blood
      as they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Han Sen was really starting to feel the benefit of having such a
      strong body. With Fallen Slaughter’s powerful build, Han Sen could keep
      going as soon as his feet touched the ground again. There was no need to
      stop and recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while the crystal shoe helped boost his movement, Han Sen knew he had
      taken quite the impact. It was strange how he only felt a modicum of pain
      in his chest. He wasn’t properly hurt. His body was strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen held the shield and his Split-Blade as he went now. He gathered up
      another demonic force, like an ancient demon. With it, he blasted away the
      creatures and spirits that tried to stand against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weaker creatures and spirits were all killed. Han Sen was unstoppable
      right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the constant stream of new creatures coming into the shelter,
      though, most of the elites were spread thin. Very few were able to go up
      against Han Sen at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallen Slaughter was a top-tier creature. Even two-on-one did not put Han
      Sen at a disadvantage. That was doubly so, given Han Sen was able to wield
      the supreme Overbearing Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been so long since Han Sen had a good fight like this. His weapon
      and shield did not slow down for a minute, as the constant onslaught of
      creatures and spirits came to do battle with him. Eventually, they were
      falling back, with Han Sen being the one on their heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen was enjoying how things were going, the crystal shoe suddenly
      changed direction. It was making him go somewhere particular within Outer
      Sky Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. He thought the crystal shoe was just taking him
      forward as it always had, and it had just happened to cross the shelter.
      This obviously wasn’t true, as they were now leading him through the
      shelter to someplace specific.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the connection between the crystal shoe and Outer Sky Shelter?
      Why would it want to be here?” Han Sen pondered the mystery, but it was
      futile. He had no choice but to follow the shoe, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao was surprised when she witnessed the fight. She also felt
      something was amiss. Recently, she had spent a lot of time focusing on Han
      Sen, and she was aware he was in possession of the Overbearing Shield and
      Split-Blade. She wondered why those two items would suddenly end up in
      Fallen Slaughter’s hands. She couldn’t figure out why, but she just knew
      there had to be something wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen committed to a bit more killing, a palace was soon standing
      before him. It looked weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of Outer Sky Shelter was composed of stone, wood, and bronze.
      They were all quite old-fashioned looking. This palace in the shelter,
      however, did not match the rest. It looked out of place, as if someone had
      placed it there against its will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire palace appeared to have been created out of glass. There was no
      similar architecture anywhere else in the shelter. It was like a giant
      glass sculpture.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the crystal shoe still firmly on, Han Sen ended up walking directly
      in front of the glass palace. It looked as if the shoe was going to smash
      him right into the locked door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then saw the placard above the gate, which read: Eastern King
      Palace. This surprised Han Sen, because he knew who that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen was on the top floor of Destiny’s Tower, he read the message
      left behind by that spirit. It read: Eastern King was here. That was how
      he knew Eastern King’s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he saw Eastern King Palace, Han Sen was quite surprised. He
      thought to himself, “Is the crystal shoe somehow connected to Eastern
      King? Or is Eastern King a woman, and the owner of this shoe? Is that why
      the shoe is coming here? Is it trying to return to its master?”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen pondered this, he was dragged directly in front of the gate. He
      saw someone outside the gate. The person looked very cold as he came
      toward Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>“My King!” shouted the spirits that had been chasing Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. This man was Outer Sky Shelter’s master and the elder
      of the Yu family. It was the emperor class spirit Outer Sky King.
