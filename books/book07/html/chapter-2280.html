<p>“If you weren’t there, what would be the point of me staying in
that palace of yours?” Han Sen asked distractedly as he turned the
needle over in his hands.</p>
<p>“That is my business, just do as you’re told,” Yisha said.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled at Yisha. “I must apologize, my Queen. I am a guy
who would rather have his freedom and be able to relax as he
chooses. I’m not a fan of staying put and looking after something.
You should really go and take care of your own palace.”</p>
<p>Yisha returned his smile with a wry one of her own. “If I could
return, I wouldn’t be talking to you right now, would I?”</p>
<p>She started to say something more, but suddenly, Han Sen froze.
He was staring at the ghost statue, and with a flick of his wrist,
he tossed the needle toward it.</p>
<p>Yisha sighed. She had spent some time researching that bone
needle. It was almost completely indestructible, but it had no
power. She had been unable to feel any power residing at its tip.
If she had been able to use the bone needle and any power it
possessed to break the ghost statue, she wouldn’t have been bound
there when Han Sen found her.</p>
<p>But Yisha stared with a slack jaw as the bone needle sailed
toward the statue, completely unimpeded. The ghost statue had
knocked Han Sen to the ground countless times, but it didn’t react
to the bone needle at all. It merely watched the bone needle strike
its forehead.</p>
<p>“This… How is this possible…?” Yisha’s eyes were wide. She gazed
at the strange scene with disbelief.</p>
<p>When the bone needle pierced the ghost statue’s forehead, the
needle lit up red. It shone brighter and brighter, and before long,
the ghost statue started to shake. The noise of breaking rocks
began to rumble around them.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The next moment, the statue fell to pieces. The grip holding
Yisha and the blood kirin was suddenly released. They fell to the
bridge, the shattered remains of the statue’s hands falling around
them.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was injured, but it hadn’t lost much strength.
It gathered itself back up, and its signature red cloud swirled
around it.</p>
<p>Yisha was close to death, and the blood in her body had almost
run dry. She was very weak, and she didn’t have the strength to
react. She fell to the ground limply.</p>
<p>Han Sen caught her in his arms to prevent her from hitting the
bridge. He smiled and said, “My Queen, it looks like you are going
to have to tend to your palace after all.”</p>
<p>The purple air across the entire jade bridge began to spread and
thin. Giant rocks began to fall. Yisha was held in Han Sen’s arms.
As she looked up at Han Sen from below, her heart started to feel
strange.</p>
<p>She had never seen a man from a lower angle. She was always the
one up high. She had never felt like this before, and suddenly, she
started to feel even weaker.</p>
<p>As the last pieces of the ghost statue fell, the purple air
across the bridge began to evaporate. Han Sen, the blood kirin, and
Yisha started to return to normal. The jade bridge that had seemed
endless now looked as it previously had. They could see the other
twelve jade bridges around them and the thirteen teleporters in
front of them.</p>
<p>Fox Queen and the others, however, were gone. They must have
traveled through the teleporter and left that palace.</p>
<p>Because the blood kirin was injured, Han Sen opted not to ride
it. He was still holding Yisha as he strode across the jade
bridge.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to go through the teleporter?” Yisha asked
weakly from where she was cradled against Han Sen’s chest.</p>
<p>“Of course I will, but before that, I want to walk across the
rest of the jade bridges,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to walk the thirteen bridges for one simple
reason: he wanted to get each statue’s power.</p>
<p>After Yisha gave him the bone needle, he realized that the bone
needle was a xenogeneic treasure that combined with Blood-Pulse
Plunder. If he used Blood-Pulse Plunder by itself, he would need to
beat the enemy first. He couldn’t use Blood-Pulse Plunder to take
away an opponent’s blood pulse until the enemy didn’t have enough
power to fight back.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was squaring off against an extra-strong enemy,
though, there was always the chance that he might not be able to
beat them. During times like that, Blood-Pulse Plunder wouldn’t be
very useful.</p>
<p>But with this bone needle, things were different. Han Sen could
imbue the bone needle with the powers of Blood-Pulse Plunder. After
that, he only had to put the bone needle into an enemy’s body, and
the bone needle would plunder the enemy’s blood pulse. Han Sen only
needed to stick the needle into a foe.</p>
<p>That being said, the bone needle wasn’t powerful on its own. Han
Sen would have to use his own strength. But piercing a needle into
an enemy was still far easier than trying to beat an opponent that
had him bested.</p>
<p>The statues on the thirteen bridges were each prepared for the
combination of Blood-Pulse Plunder and the bone needle. The bone
needle could easily pierce the statues and take the hidden blood
pulse power that resided within them. Han Sen would basically have
to repeat what he did to the ghost statue. The bone needle had a
concentration of power now, too.</p>
<p>It was just a drop, but it was a blood pulse hell power. It was
a deified power.</p>
<p>There had to be something similar on the other twelve bridges.
That was something Han Sen was most assuredly not going to miss out
on.</p>
<p>Han Sen switched positions and carried Yisha on his back. He
walked to another jade bridge, and just as he had expected, the
first half was safe. When he approached a statue in the middle of
the bridge, he used the bone needle to absorb the blood pulse power
inside the statue. The statue then fell, and the bridge lost its
protection. It became an ordinary jade bridge again.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked through the rest of the bridges and took the
blood pulse power from the statues. Yisha’s surprise was written
plainly across her face, making it obvious that she had no clue why
the bone needle was so powerful in Han Sen’s hands.</p>
<p>Yisha had picked up the bone needle, but she had no idea that
the needle had to be used in conjunction with Blood-Pulse Plunder.
She didn’t have Blood-Pulse Plunder, so aside from its sturdiness,
the needle had no utility in her hands.</p>
<p>The second Sacred Leader statue had been destroyed for some
reason, so Han Sen hadn’t been able to retrieve the bone needle
personally. Yet it landed in his hands anyway when Yisha
volunteered it.</p>
<p>The Sacred Leader had blocked all the routes, but something had
been left on each path for those that traversed it. The items were
connected with each other in ways that Han Sen hadn’t yet figured
out. The Sacred Leader’s full plans were still a mystery.</p>
<p>The Silver Sycees, Blood-Pulse Plunder, the bone needle,
thirteen blood pulse powers—they were all very rare and valuable
treasures. At this point, he could easily start a fight with a
deified being.</p>
<p>The treasures were meant to be obtained through tests given by
the Sacred Leader. No one had realized how scary the Sacred
Leader’s treasures could be.</p>
<p>“My Queen, are you afraid of needles?” Han Sen asked Yisha.</p>
<p>Yisha was shocked, and she did not know what he meant.</p>
<p>“I mean, are you afraid of being pricked with a needle?” Han Sen
blinked and asked.</p>
<p>“Are you going to give me a shot?” Yisha looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted his bone needle while he smiled at Yisha. “Close
your eyes if you are afraid. The pain will be over in a
second.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen thrust his bone needle into Yisha’s chest. A
drop of hell blood came out, and it blended into Yisha’s own
blood.</p>
<p>If he wanted to survive, he had to get rid of Fox Queen. And
unless another deified elite challenged her, it was unlikely Fox
Queen could be defeated.</p>
<p>Even with Han Sen’s deified blood pulse, his actual power
wouldn’t be deified. Yisha, however, was different. She was half a
step away from being deified herself. Getting the hell blood pulse
would give her a boost towards the lofty goal of becoming deified.
This was their best chance of taking the Sacred Leader’s
treasure.</p>
