<p>Pang! Pang!</p>

<p>The bullets struck the Stone Cow from afar. They made the Stone Cow angry, but after repeated hits, its speed was slower than that of a snail. It couldn’t come after Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shooting from as far away as possible. The Stone Cow couldn’t even see him, and even if it had been able to, it wouldn’t have been able to go after him.</p>

<p>Earl class Spell weaponry could damage many things, but the bullets couldn’t pierce the Stone Cow’s body. Han Sen hadn’t expected that they would be able to kill the Stone Cow, though. He kept firing bullets, imbued with the Turtle spell, to leave turtle markings across the Stone Cow’s body to slow it.</p>

<p>At first, the Stone Cow was able to stomp to create its shockwaves. But as the turtle symbols piled across it, the Stone Cow looked like it was in slow motion. Its signature shockwave started to appear less and less frequently.</p>

<p>Han Sen examined the shockwaves and found that they had a radius of five hundred meters. Beyond that, their strength dropped dramatically.</p>

<p>“Five hundred meters. I’ll have to use very careful timing to strike in between the casting of the shockwaves.”</p>

<p>Han Sen kept on sniping the Stone Cow to increase the amount of the Turtle spell that affected it. As he did, he moved closer to the Stone Cow, but not within the radius of the shockwave.</p>

<p>“Now!” Han Sen drew his knife and started running. He raced to the Stone Cow like a ghost. In a moment, he was right beside it.</p>

<p>Before the Stone Cow could raise its legs, the Ghost Teeth Knife sliced the cow’s ear with knife and sword powers. Dong!</p>

<p>The knife and sword power shattered. Ghost Teeth Knife’s blade came against the stone cow’s ears. One of the ears was cut in half.</p>

<p>Han Sen immediately retreated dozens of meters. A loud stomping noise came from behind him and the shockwave rolled over him, petrifying him. Han Sen was dealt a Turtle spell, too.</p>

<p>Han Sen quickly removed the petrification and the Turtle spell, then jumped out of the radius of the shockwave.</p>

<p>The Stone Cow wanted to chase after him, but its movement was laughably slow. All it could do was roar.</p>

<p>“Steal my prey, huh? You are dead!” Han Sen used his rifle to shoot the Stone Cow again.</p>

<p>The Turtle spell had a time limit. Over time, its effectiveness decreased. Han Sen fired a few more shots as he moved out of the Stone Cow’s attack range, just to be safe.</p>

<p>Since the Stone Cow was still bellowing and moving sluggishly, Han Sen felt safe pausing to look at it. The ear that had been cut open was shrouded in purple smoke, which was spreading slowly across its body.</p>

<p>But the Stone Cow’s body had no blood, so it wouldn’t bleed out. The Teeth power would have to chew apart its body a piece at a time. Han Sen kept firing at the Stone Cow to ensure that it wouldn’t be able to escape. He’d allow the Teeth power to kill it.</p>

<p>The Stone Cow was starting to realize something was frightfully wrong. Instead of bellowing at Han Sen, it was now trying to turn around and run away. Unfortunately for the cow, it was still as slow as a sloth. It couldn’t escape Han Sen’s watchful eye.</p>

<p>Han Sen was not in too much of a rush, either. He continued shooting the cow occasionally. The Teeth powers kept tearing at the cow’s wounds, spreading across its head.</p>

<p>The Stone Cow’s body was strong, and Han Sen’s Teeth power was still only Earl class, so the damage increased slowly. But even at that speed, the cow would die in a couple of days.</p>

<p>The Stone Cow kept trying to escape, but the effort was futile. Han Sen couldn’t stop the creature entirely, but he made sure that it never got out of shooting range.</p>

<p>The Stone Cow kept squealing furiously as it ran. It wasn’t very happy with Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not want to provoke the cow too much, though. He preferred that the cow continue trying to run rather than attempt to fight off its inevitable death. The creature was strange, and it might possess more weird powers that Han Sen hadn’t yet seen. Ultimately, Han Sen decided to watch it die slowly from afar. He wasn’t going to take any unnecessary chances.</p>

<p>But things didn’t go as smoothly as he believed they would. Under the Stone Cow’s constant squealing, Han Sen heard a low rumbling. The earth trembled.</p>

<p>Not long after, a group of small Stone Cows approached. There were at least forty of them. The herd met the fleeing Stone Cow and surrounded it. A larger cow moo’d at the Stone Cow, to which the Stone Cow replied.</p>

<p>The Stone Cows all glared in Han Sen’s direction, then shuffled forward to position the wounded Stone Cow behind them.</p>

<p>“Shit! That guy ate the smaller Stone Cow. Why are they still protecting it? They should be enemies.” Han Sen sighed, but the Stone Cows were already headed his way.</p>

<p>Han Sen had to leave. He wasn’t powerful enough to tackle an entire group of Marquises. Han Sen grabbed the sniper rifle and took off running. He couldn’t kill the Stone Cow while the smaller ones were around.</p>

<p>Luckily, he was still able to snipe from afar. As the Stone Cows approached, he found himself falling back into the mountains. He soon heard a moo’ing noise from within the cow group.</p>

<p>Rocks began to fall from the sky like a meteor shower. The group of Marquise Stone Cows pooled their strength, and the land for ten square miles around them was pummelled by rocks. It looked like the end of the world.</p>

<p>Han Sen managed to lose his pursuers in the mountains, then circled back around. The Stone Cow was gone, but there were still a few of the smaller ones in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to scan for the trail of the Stone Cow. After a few minutes of searching, he found it. He followed it all the way to a valley. The group of Stone Cows were there, but the one he had fought was no longer around.</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned. “It should be in the valley. It is inflicted with Teeth power, but it shouldn’t last long.”</p>

<p>Han Sen waited there for two days. He wanted to wait until it died before going into the valley after its body.</p>

<p>But waiting for another night, Han Sen had yet to hear an announcement confirming its death. That meant the cow was still alive, someplace in the valley.</p>

<p>“How can the Teeth power just disappear? That should be impossible.” Han Sen used the sniper scope to see if the cow’s ear was healed. There was no sign of Teeth power around it.</p>

<p>Han Sen stared in disbelief.</p>
