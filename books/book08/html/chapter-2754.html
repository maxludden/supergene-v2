<p>Han Sen didn’t know how they were going to suppress the blood
coral and the thing below it, but four days later, the elite
warriors began to gather in the Very High Leader’s palace. When the
last of them arrived, there were four true god elites and a dozen
butterflies. It was a very powerful team.</p>
<p>They investigated Han Sen’s scales before they left, but sadly,
every attempt to remove the scales failed. They even tried peeling
off Han Sen’s skin, but nothing seemed to work. The scales remained
firmly in place.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s flesh could be sliced off, but when his flesh regrew,
so did the scales.</p>
<p>The Very High couldn’t do anything about Han Sen’s mutation.
Things seemed to be going very poorly for him.</p>
<p>And of course, the Very High decided to suppress Han Sen as well
as the blood coral, just in case the curse turned out to be true.
Nobody wanted Han Sen to turn into a monster that could bring ruin
and destruction to the entire universe.</p>
<p>Han Sen hated the idea of being put in a cage, but he knew this
was the best way for them to go about it. Even though the Very High
were known for their brutal efficiency, they didn’t simply kill
him. Killing him would have been the most sure-fire way of dealing
with the situation, and Han Sen had expected them to consider it as
an option. He was rather relieved when he found out that they
weren’t planning to end him permanently.</p>
<p>They left Han Sen in a palace surrounded by clouds and mist, and
he had settled himself on the stairs that led to the palace’s front
door. He stared off into the clouds, his mind distant.</p>
<p>Although the palace looked like an ordinary building, in truth,
the entire place was contained inside a Very High true god item.
Han Sen had seen the true god item, which was a jade bottle of
sorts, but he hadn’t learned much about it. He had been taken in
front of the Very High alpha’s statue and then put inside the
bottle.</p>
<p>Although the clouds that surrounded his palace were beautiful,
the place was still just a prison. Furthermore, the prison
contained only him.</p>
<p>Everything aside from the palace was just a blur. There were no
life forces to examine, and the place seemed to be disconnected
from the rest of the universe, too. In fact, Han Sen couldn’t even
continue practicing.</p>
<p>“If the Very High cannot find a way to remove my scales, does
that mean I will be trapped here forever?” Han Sen’s face grew more
distraught with every minute that passed.</p>
<p>Although the strange piece of blood coral had been moved
elsewhere by the Very High and no longer reappeared next to Han
Sen, the scales continued to grow across his body. Right now, most
of his body had been claimed by the scales. Aside from his head not
having horns, he looked like some sort of humanoid dragon
beast.</p>
<p>The palace contained food and fresh spring water, but it only
satiated his hunger and kept him alive. It didn’t allow him to
practice more, and it did nothing to reinforce his genes.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the Very High elites would visit now and
again. They would also try out new methods to remove his scales,
but they failed every time. As time passed, they visited less and
less often. As Han Sen sat on the steps, it had been ten days since
he last saw any of the Very High elites.</p>
<p>Right now, the Very High weren’t helping Han Sen. They had
become his oppressors. They couldn’t confirm that Han Sen was
Dragon reborn via the curse, but in their usual style, the Very
High had opted to trap him there. Because there was a small
possibility that he could be destructive, they wouldn’t let him
leave.</p>
<p>“The Very High promised me that they would send Bao’er to Sky
Palace. I suppose they will do that for me, at least. Now, it is
all down to me. I need to figure out a way to escape.” Han Sen made
many attempts, but they all seemed useless. The palace was
completely cut off from the outside world. He couldn’t even jump to
a sanctuary.</p>
<p>He couldn’t go to the god area or anywhere else, either. That
place was like a giant prison. He wasn’t really living, nor was he
actually dying. He was just there. He was trapped.</p>
<p>“How can I be this unlucky?” Han Sen sighed. Then an idea
flashed through his head, and he said, “Right, maybe I can try
this!”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He ran into the palace and closed the
gate.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been there for a while, so he knew roughly how the
bottle worked. Because the world inside the bottle was completely
separate from the outside world, it was impossible to see in or
out. Unless the Very High came in person to visit, they wouldn’t be
able to see what he was doing. Han Sen had already tested this
before, so he was certain that was the case.</p>
<p>Once Han Sen had locked himself in the palace, he summoned
something from Destiny’s Tower. It was a bronze object that was a
few meters tall. A sheep head marked each of the bronze object’s
four corners, and the entire thing looked rather evil.</p>
<p>“One of the sheep heads can send me to the world that trapped
the Breaksky alpha. I wonder if the other three sheep heads do the
same thing. Or can they take me elsewhere? This thing was capable
of transporting me away from Outer Sky, so perhaps it will still
work here.” Han Sen gritted his teeth. He went to one of the sheep
heads on the Four Sheep Cube. With a silent prayer, he placed his
hand on the sheep head.</p>
<p>The sheep head lowered under the force of Han Sen’s hand. The
black and white fish in the center of the object began to swim
faster. Their speed formed a vortex within the water.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a force of suction attempt to pull his body into
the swirl. He was surprised that it had actually worked. He didn’t
know where the Four Sheep Cube would take him, but no matter where
it was, it was a chance to get free. He didn’t want to remain in
the palace forever.</p>
<p>Wa-la!</p>
<p>When Han Sen emerged from the water, he knew immediately that he
was no longer in the palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen was afraid of exposing the scales on his skin, so he
immediately put on his Dongxuan Armor. Even if a creature knew
about Dongxuan Armor, they would just assume he was Dollar. No one
would know he had escaped from the Very High true god item.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Han Sen looked around in alarm. Moving as
fast as he could, Han Sen returned to the Four Sheep Cube. He
slammed his hand down on the head of a sheep.</p>
<p>Han Sen was standing on a giant stone platform surrounded by
scary stone xenogeneics. To the east, there was a xenogeneic that
was a white-haired, black-faced, giant ape. To the south, there was
a human-bodied monster with the head of a cow. To the north, there
was a beast that was like a kirin. To the west, there was a weird
snake with nine heads.</p>
<p>The four giant xenogeneics gave off a frightening presence.
Sensing them sent chills right down Han Sen’s spine. The monsters
surrounded the stone platform, looming over it like the stone
platform was a dinner table and Han Sen was the sole sausage in the
middle that they would fight over.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen could see the white-haired, black-faced giant ape’s hand
stretching toward him. Han Sen was already getting sucked into the
Four Sheep Cube. And then, his vision started to spin. When he
emerged from the water, he was back in the palace contained within
the Very High’s bottle.</p>
<p>“I’m fortunate that my reactions were quick. If I was too slow,
I would have become food for those scary xenogeneics.” Han Sen
patted his chest and spoke to himself in a shaky voice, trying to
comfort his frightened little heart.</p>
