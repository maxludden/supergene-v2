Yun Suyi let the flying tiger soar at full speed. It raced into the clouds in less than a second. When she turned around, no one was behind her.

“Hmph! You made me wait so long; you deserve it!” Yun Suyi did not allow her tiger to slow down. She flew straight to the xenogeneic island.

Yun Suyi planned to reach the xenogeneic island and wait for Han Sen there; she was curious to see how long it would take for him to get there.

Her jade wing tiger was a Marquise class xenogeneic. It was one of the fastest Marquise rank creatures, so it wasn’t surprising that she had lost Han Sen so easily.

Yun Suyi felt cocky, but when the other students of Sky Palace flew past, they all looked at Yun Suyi strangely.

“I know I’m pretty, but you don’t have to stare like that,” Yun Suyi thought.

After a while, though, she felt that something must be amiss. She knew many of the people she was passing, and although she rarely went to the xenogeneic island, she never attracted this much attention on her way there.

“Did something happen to my appearance?” Yun Suyi touched her cheek and looked at her clothes. There was nothing wrong with her.

She flew for a while longer, and people were still looking at her. She frowned and pulled out a mirror to look at herself.

“Strange. There’s nothing wrong with me; everything is as it should be. I’m just as pretty—ARGH!” As Yun Suyi moved the mirror to check her face from different angles, a mysterious shadow suddenly appeared in the mirror. A smiling person was sitting behind. It was Han Sen.

“When did you get here?” Yun Suyi turned back to take a look. Han Sen was sitting casually behind her on the tiger, and it was now no wonder why people had been looking at her.

Those people were not really watching her, though. They were looking at Han Sen.

“When you took the tiger into the sky, I was already sitting atop it. Aren’t you supposed to be taking me to the xenogeneic island? Is there something wrong with me being here? Have I misunderstood your intent?” Han Sen looked at her with a smile.

“Nothing’s wrong.” Yun Suyi blushed, refusing to look at Han Sen.

It weirded her out that Han Sen had managed to catch up.

Not even Thousand Feather Crane or Yun Sushang could match the Jade Wing Tiger’s speed. Han Sen had just become an Earl, so there was no way he could move that fast.

In truth, Han Sen did not have that speed, but he did have his rabbit shoes. They were faster than the Jade Wing Tiger, even if they lacked the ability of flight. When Jade Wing Tiger took off, Han Sen used the rabbit shoes to leap onto the tiger’s back. He then hid his presence, so Yun Suyi wouldn’t notice him.

Yun Suyi was confused, not understanding what had happened.

Jade Wing Tiger was quite fast, and they arrived at the xenogeneic island shortly after.

The xenogeneic island was comprised of many gardens, with each one containing a multitude of xenogeneic creatures. They didn’t look bloodthirsty, so it was like they were all tamed. Fitting with the theme of Sky Palace, most of them were of the flying variety.

Yun Suyi took Han Sen to her garden, and someone there welcomed them. Yun Suyi told them to get back to work, then brought Han Sen into the garden alone.

“What class of xenogeneic mount do you want? Available mounts run from Baron class all the way up to Marquise. They are already tamed, so they listen to people.” She was actually asking Han Sen how much he was willing to cough up for a xenogeneic.

Han Sen thought and said, “The cheaper the better. Anything to substitute for walking.”

Han Sen was still new in the geno universe. There were many creatures in the sanctuary that had yet to evolve. Han Sen did not need to waste his resources.

Han Sen was going to kill xenogeneics himself soon, anyway, and there was always the chance he could nab a beast soul mount. Those mounts would be far better than a tamed xenogeneic.

Yun Suyi smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my sister said I can give you the lowest possible price. You won’t get prices like this anywhere else.”

Han Sen shook his head. “I just want one that can help me fly. I don’t need one that is strong.”

When Yun Suyi saw that Han Sen wasn’t kidding, she thought for a minute. “The cheapest flying mount is a xenogeneic called a Jade Night Crane. They are in every shop, but ours are different. You saw Brother Crane’s Jade Night Crane, yes? Normally, they are Baron and hard to level up. But that one was Earl, and it came from us.”

“Sure. Give me one of those, then.” Han Sen was not picky. It was just a riding mount, so it wouldn’t be anything too special regardless of how much he paid.

You should go and pick one yourself. We have thousands of them. They are all the same price, and they are all just as good.” Yun Suyi took Han Sen to the area for the Jade Night Cranes.

Han Sen was remarkably surprised when he saw the birds swarming in flocks that looked like clouds. Sky Palace was a big faction; there weren’t many places where you could see this many tamed xenogeneics in one place.

Taming a xenogeneic was far harder than killing one. It would be easier to kill an Earl or Marquise xenogeneic than to tame a Baron xenogeneic. It was amazing that the Sky had successfully done so this many times.

“Where did these xenogeneics come from?” Han Sen asked, looking at all the Jade Night Cranes.

“Some were caught, some were raised. We will take you to Xuanyuan Cave. There is an Earl there that you can tame. If you can catch it alive, it will fetch a far loftier price than selling the xenogeneic gene material,” Yun Suyi said.

Han Sen nodded. He used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the Jade Night Cranes. If she was going to let him choose, then he might as well make the best choice that he could. He was going to pick the one with the brightest life force.

Han Sen scanned them, and he found one among them that appeared to be extra strong. When he saw it, the creature was just lying down in the grass. It didn’t appear to be as active as the others.

Yun Suyi, seeing Han Sen look at that Jade Night Crane, said, “That one is a Viscount. It was a Baron xenogeneic that was bought by a Viscount. It was later raised to become a Viscount itself, but after a grueling fight, its legs were cut off and its wings were damaged. It recovered from its wounds, but it is still disabled. Now, its flying speed is only Baron class. Also, it still doesn’t have legs…”

Yun Suyi stopped talking, but it was obvious what had happened.
