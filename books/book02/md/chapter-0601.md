Han Sen ascended the cliff wall a dozen meters or so, and in a few more steps, he would reach the lizard-creature.

Han Sen had secretly activated his gene lock, and with it, he could sense the creature's desire to turn around. When it did, he also had the foresight to know the creature would extend its tongue. In the next second, the lizard shot out its long, red, spiky tongue towards him.

Being able to tell what was coming felt amazing. Han Sen felt as if he could predict everything.

Han Sen leapt away from the cliffside. Borrowing strength from the air, he dodged the giant, toxic-looking tongue and returned to the cliffside near the creature. Unsheathing his silver sword, he quickly chopped its head off.

This result even surpassed his own expectation, as the head quickly dislodged from the creature and fell to the ground. His sword went through it like a hot knife through butter, and it was enough to make Han Sen question whether or not it was actually a sacred-blood creature.

> "Sacred-Blood Creature Hunted: Mountain Lizard. The Beast Soul Was Not Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount Of Sacred Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten."

But the voice confirmed what Zhu Ting had told him, that it was indeed a sacred-blood creature.

Han Sen was chuffed. He now knew for sure that having unlocked his gene lock, his base power had increased by a dizzying amount, not just his abilities of perception.

Right now, even sacred-blood creatures could be killed with little to no effort. This was powerful power.

Zhu Ting, who remained at the bottom, continued looking up as if he was frozen. He did not say a word. Even he was shocked at how easy it was for Han Sen to slay the sacred-blood creature.

Pang!

The mountain lizard now fell to the ground, as did Han Sen. Quickly, Zhu Ting sprang to help pick his master up. But then he said, "You asshole. I asked you to help me out and weaken the fiend; I didn't ask you to kill it! Did you get the beast soul?"

"I was careless. Sometimes I don't know my own strength. I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Han Sen gave a wry smile while he apologized, and then he continued, "But I didn't get the beast soul; really! How about I make it up to you by finding another sacred-blood beast soul, eh? I'll weaken it and let you get in the final hit. Does that sound okay?"

Zhu Ting calmed down after hearing that, but he still had to double-check. So he asked, "But you really didn't get the beast soul?"

"I, Han Sen, in the name of the deities that command our existence, swear a proclamation that I did not receive a beast soul. If I did, smite me, oh heavenly beings!" Han Sen jovially said aloud.

"What kind of oath is that? Do you think I'll believe that? Few people actually die from swearing such a thing. Swear again, and this time, say that you will never ever have a wife!" Zhu Ting said.

Han Sen did as he requested and said it, which comforted him fully. They then hauled the mountain lizard's body onto a summoned mount and decided to return to the shelter.

"Honestly, though; how have you achieved what you have? You have only been in the Second God's Sanctuary for less than a year, yet you have grown so much and achieved so many things. You haven't unlocked your gene lock, have you?" On his way back, Zhu Ting watched Han Sen with fervent curiosity. Now, he couldn't help but ask.

"Opening a gene lock is not that hard," Han Sen told him, without blinking. Zhu Ting wasn't sure if what he had said was a confirmation, but he chose to believe that he had indeed. After all, Han Sen had been in the Second God's Sanctuary for a way too short a time.

Back in the shelter, Han Sen returned to his room to see a woman reclining on a chair reading his books.

Although he could only see her shadow from the doorway, Han Sen already knew that it was Queen. Her body was far too special, and its beauty was difficult not to recognize.

Han Sen did not expect Queen to receive word and come to see him so soon. It looked as if she was taking his inclusion within her team as a serious thing.

"Pingqing said you are willing to join my team?" Queen put down her book and turned around to look at Han Sen.

"Yes, I am." Han Sen nodded.

"What made you change your mind so soon?" Queen asked.

"I've had it rattling around my head for the past few days, and with my sacred geno points almost being at max capacity, I thought this would be a good time for me to find out if there are any creatures above the sacred-blood class. So, yes, after giving it much thought, I have decided to join you," Han Sen said.

"You won't be tagging along to watch, you know. You will have to obey my command. These creatures are extremely dangerous, and those who have unlocked their gene lock can still perish in the blink of an eye. Especially you. So, when the team is fighting, you must adhere to my orders and leave that lone wolf nonsense behind," Queen told him with a stern face.

"I know that." Han Sen nodded. He then said, "But there is something I would like to tell you. My pet has this special ability that causes creatures of the surrounding area to fall back. I am not sure if it will have the same effect on these super creatures, and what's more, my pet cannot attack creatures."

"I already guessed it made creatures flee, but I had expected it to fight back. The former ability is what I value the most, anyway," Queen said.

"Wait, so that's all you want?" Han Sen froze.

Queen then told him, "There are a lot of creatures around this powerful one we have set our sights on. Although we are not afraid of them, fighting them alongside this bigger super creature would prove too much of a hassle. Not to mention dangerous. With your pet in tow, we would not have to worry about the others, which would allow us all to focus on the primary target."

Now Han Sen knew why Queen wanted his presence so badly.

"You sort things out here this night. Tomorrow, you can come with me. I'm only passing through today, so I thought I'd stop by. For attacking a powerful creature, I already have a plan in motion. When you come with me, however, you'll have to meet and greet the team. If they have no objection, we'll have no problem making you a member," Queen said.

"Wait, so you aren't the absolute decider?" Han Sen frowned.

"When I created this team, we established a rule. For the acceptance of a new team member, a unanimous vote must take place. Although I am the team's leader, I cannot override this rule."

"Okay."

The next day, Han Sen arranged for others to deal with the shelter's business in his time away, and with the silver fox in hand, followed Queen out of the Icefield.

With the silver fox in their company, they were not hassled by any intervening creatures, and before long, they arrived at the oceanside. There, Queen summoned a whale for a ship and rode it alongside Han Sen.

The silver fox was quite amazing, as no creatures of the sea decided to harass them there, either. This seemed to satisfy Queen, as she now looked at the silver fox with greater kindness.

But Han Sen couldn't enjoy the same treatment, for she had not spoken to him once for the duration of their journey together. And the way she looked at him was cold.

Han Sen understood that she was still angry with him over what happened that day. Knowing his place, and acknowledging the need to give her space, he avoided talking with her in fear of increasing the tension between them.

They sailed across the sea for two days before they caught sight of a black island on the horizon. Queen beelined for it, clearly marking it as her destination.
