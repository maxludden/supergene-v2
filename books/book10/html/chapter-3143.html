<h3>Chapter 3143</h3>

<p>When the white flame touched the evil, black, and purple spirit,
it was like it had met gasoline. The entire god temple lit up in a
fire.</p>
<p>The power possessing Han Sen and Bald Guy vanished. They
regained control of their bodies.</p>
<p>When he saw the little flying fish spit out a fire to battle the
guillotine, Bald Guy’s mouth opened wide. He was so shocked that he
could not close his mouth. The scary fire was able to do battle
with a God Spirit, and it showed no sign of being at a
disadvantage. The whole god temple was bathed in fire. Only the god
altar, which had the guillotine, was not burning.</p>
<p>The guillotine released black and purple flames and evil
spirits. The flying fish suppressed the flames that came out of
it.</p>
<p>Bald Guy thought about the time he had talked about skinning the
flying fish and all the other stuff he had said to it. He now felt
very happy. He was glad that he hadn’t acted on his desires.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu was flabbergasted. She had already thought that the
small flying fish was weird. She knew it was not a low-level gene
race, but she did not expect it to be that scary. It was
effectively combatting the powers of a God Spirit.</p>
<p>vei</p>
<p>A gene race with that power suggested only one possibility. It
proved that it must have absorbed a God Spirit Blood-Pulse before.
It had already become a God Spirit gene race.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a bit surprised too. It looked like gene races that
absorbed God Spirit Blood-Pulses could fight God Spirits.</p>
<p>In the future, he only needed to use Cast God Court to evolve a
God Spirit gene race. Then, he did not have to break the rules of
the world to fight a God Spirit.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen hoped the blood dragon would evolve faster so it
could absorb the god dragon Blood-Pulse faster. He did not know how
strong the blood god dragon would become after that.</p>
<p>“How is it possible for such a powerful God Spirit gene race to
obey a human?” The doll looked at the flying fish with shock. Han
Sen was shocked as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the doll and coldly asked, “Now, can you tell
me where you are from?”</p>
<p>The doll was speechless. It could not have been any ordinary God
Spirit.</p>
<p>The doll suddenly laughed and said, “You are cocky far too soon.
Your God Spirit gene race is strong, but if I am not mistaken, it
is a rare gene race that absorbed an Annihilation God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. It is one of the strongest in the universe, but it is
a shame…”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face didn’t change as he asked, “What is a shame?”</p>
<p>The doll replied, “It is a shame that it does not have a god
temple for support. It is just a wild god that is down upon the
table.” The doll grabbed the rope and pulled the heavy blade to the
highest point, which made the cord straight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the entire guillotine released extremely scary purple
and black flames. It was like a volcano erupting. It fought the
small flying fish’s flames.</p>
<p>In the next second, the doll let go of the rope and let it fall.
The heavy blade went down like it was insane. It snapped itself
into the guillotine very hard.</p>
<p>Boom! The guillotine exploded. It was like hell cutting open a
door. Countless scary spirits emerged. It was very scary. The
purple and black flames incinerated everything.</p>
<p>The small, flying fish was in front of Han Sen. Its body was
puffed up like a circular ball. It spewed white fire and fought the
scary power that the guillotine had produced.</p>
<p>The flying fish’s mouth was full of blood. It was injured and
fell back.</p>
<p>Bao’er picked up the injured little flying fish. Her angry eyes
looked murderous. This was a rare feeling for her to express.</p>
<p>The doll laughed as if it was insane. “I told you. No matter how
powerful it may be, it is just a wild god on the table. Compared to
a real god like me, there is a gulf in power that cannot be
closed.”</p>
<p>Amid the doll’s very sharp laughing voice, the self-destructive
guillotine reformed on the god altar. It looked just like the old
guillotine. The powerful presence did not change.</p>
<p>The guillotine’s power was as strong as the small flying fish.
It might have even been weaker than the small flying fish, but it
had the protection of a god temple. It was able to keep rebuilding
itself atop the god altar.</p>
<p>The guillotine was able to keep burning the small flying fish.
It could have been blown up 100 times and still kill again. The
little flying fish was not able to be reborn in the same
fashion.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked murderous too. He coldly glared at the doll and
said, “You are using the immortal power the god temple gave
you.”</p>
<p>“So, what? That is the power of a god. That establishes the
difference between a god and a commoner.” The doll continued
pulling the rope. It again pulled up the blade of the guillotine.
It greedily looked at the small flying fish. “This is a God Spirit
gene race. If I can absorb it and use it, I can push myself to be a
superior Reboot class being. God must have given me this chance
today.”</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu suddenly screamed with shock, “Han Sen, fall back! I
know what this is! It is not a God Spirit! It is a member of the
God Chaos Party!”</p>
<p>The doll laughed harder. “I did not expect humans to still
remember the God Chaos Party. This is becoming rather interesting.”
“What is the God Chaos Party?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu’s voice trembled as she said, “It is an organization
of special creatures. In the God Chaos Party, every creature can
fight God Spirits. They are not God Spirits themselves, but they
have the power to make God Spirits feel fear. In ancient times, the
God Chaos Party was known throughout the universe. It made a sky
full of God Spirits descend. The universe was almost
destroyed.”</p>
<p>The doll laughed weirdly and interrupted Li Bing Yu. “You know
nothing. The God Spirits are where the evil comes from. The world
is supposed to be lawless. God Spirits enforce laws and control the
universe. That is an insult to the universe. We just want the
universe to be how it should be.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you are not a God Spirit?” Han Sen now
understood. He knew why the guillotine and doll did not carry the
same presence as a God Spirit.</p>
<p>“No, I am a God Spirit, but I am a real God Spirit. I am not
like those rubbish God Spirits.” The doll suddenly stopped laughing
and looked serious. “Allow me to introduce myself. My god name is
Decapitation Queen. I control the universe and death penalties. I
am the god of death sentences.”</p>
<p>“What a shame,” Decapitation Queen said. “The small flying fish
would have fit in well with the God Chaos Party and become a real
god, but it is now fighting me. That means you will all have to
die.” She pulled the cord and lifted the blade to its highest
point.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The heavy blade descended. The guillotine released scary purple
and black flames. Countless evil spirits burst out like it was the
end of the world.</p>
<p>“It has been so long since I killed a God Spirit.” Han Sen faced
that tsunami-like, scary purple and black flames. His body did not
turn black. His body started to turn white. Suddenly, his entire
body looked white. Long hair was draped down to his ankles, and his
eyes had turned white.</p>
