<p>Prince Swordstar stared furiously at Han Sen’s back. “Let’s
go.”</p>
<p>“Prince, you are just going to leave like this?” Prince
Swordstar’s remaining guard looked angry as he spoke.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar said coldly, “My people will not die for
nothing. He dared to kill in King’s Garden, and so the blood kirin
will die. Let’s go to the sentencing court.”</p>
<p>Han Sen rode the blood kirin to the king tree. In his heart, he
was thinking, “The blood kirin’s desire to kill is way too strong.
If he wants to kill, there is nothing I can do to stop him.
Fortunately, it was only a guard. I can negotiate and explain his
actions.”</p>
<p>As he got closer and closer to the king tree, Han Sen was unable
to find any primary root king dragons. Han Sen kept moving
forward.</p>
<p>The primary root king dragons appeared in different locations
each and every time. Han Sen was not lucky today, though. He didn’t
run into any of them on his way.</p>
<p>There were many princes and princesses following him, however.
Han Sen mostly ignored their presence, but after a while, he
noticed that they had fallen back and stopped following him
forward. That was a little concerning.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around and found that he was close to the king
tree. It was so thick, like a giant pillar in front of him. There
were one hundred miles of land between him and the tree.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see that there were some wrinkles in the tree’s
bark that were as wide as entire valleys. But the king dragons he
had seen were not as big as that.</p>
<p>Han Sen slowed down the speed of his approach. This place was
quite different than he had imagined. Getting closer to the tree
didn’t result in him finding more and more of the primary root king
dragons.</p>
<p>Han Sen soon found a king dragon, with a man in a white robe
standing before it. Han Sen remembered the information given to him
by Mister White, and he quickly recognized the man.</p>
<p>Prince Seventeen, Bai Qing Xia, was known as the prettiest man
in the entirety of King’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>The man was so handsome that his good looks made him practically
invincible.</p>
<p>While Qing Xia was very handsome, the legends also said that he
was quite weak. His mother had been injured while she was pregnant,
and her baby had been injured as well. So, he was born damaged. He
was a very weak person among the Extreme King, and his body wasn’t
like one of the royal bloodline. He was weaker than a commoner.</p>
<p>Prince Qing Xia was very handsome, but he wasn’t good at
anything except for being eye candy. He didn’t join the fights for
authority. If anyone mentioned him in conversation, it was just to
talk about his face.</p>
<p>“Brother Seventeen, what are you doing?” Han Sen rode the blood
kirin over to Prince Qing Xia, but the man didn’t respond. Han Sen
wanted to know why Prince Seventeen was the only one there, though;
all the other royal children were gone.</p>
<p>Prince Qing Xia’s eyes were like stars, and his facial features
were sharp. He was like a carving, wrought from a block of marble.
But he didn’t look good. In fact, he looked pale and sick.</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected Han Sen to approach and talk to him. Prince
Qing Xia looked at Han Sen and said, “I am here to get protection
from King Wen. Aren’t you doing the same, Brother Sixteen?”</p>
<p>“Um… I’m just walking around.” Han Sen didn’t think he had come
at the right time. He didn’t know what “protection from King Wen”
meant.</p>
<p>“Maybe it is something connected to the Kingese scrawl upon the
king leaves, but how will that help him? Is he going to pick a leaf
off the king tree?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Prince Qing Xia smiled and said, “There is no need to hide since
you are here now. If you are strong enough to claim the alpha’s
statue, then of course you can gain the protection of King’s
Cover.”</p>
<p>“If you want the Kingese, then I should not disturb you. I will
continue walking around,” Han Sen said, then readied himself to
depart.</p>
<p>He hadn’t figured out how to get the Kingese, and if he wasn’t
careful, he could risk being exposed. He had to get out of there
now and figure out the Kingese later.</p>
<p>Prince Qing Xia suddenly jumped. His body teleported in front of
Han Sen, barring his departure.</p>
<p>“The Kingese hasn’t woken up yet. I am curious how you were able
to understand the alpha’s statue. Please teach me, Brother
Sixteen,” Prince Qing Xia said. Before Han Sen agreed, he threw a
slap at Han Sen.</p>
<p>His fingers were long, and they glowed with light. It was a
pretty sight, but somehow, it was still masculine at the same
time.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw his slap and noticed how light it was, and how there
was no power. But even so, the move felt as if it would be very
difficult to predict. Han Sen was shocked by it.</p>
<p>“People say Prince Qing Xia is quite weak, and it would be
difficult for him to evolve. But now, I do not think those claims
are true. His slap is something very special,” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>The blood kirin sat down and roared. It wanted to jump away, but
Han Sen prevented it from doing so.</p>
<p>There was a rule in the King’s Garden that forbade killing. It
was intended to protect princes and princesses only, though. There
were options if a guard was killed, but killing a prince wouldn’t
just lead to the blood kirin being punished; Han Sen would be,
too.</p>
<p>After stopping the blood kirin, Han Sen leaped off of the blood
kirin’s back and punched towards Prince Qing Xia.</p>
<p>His fist flew forward in the traditional Extreme King Shocking
Sky Punch. He had learned it from the alpha statue. The rest of the
Extreme King had only seen the shadow, but Han Sen had watched the
alpha statue actually perform the skill.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The fist and the palm came against each other. Han Sen and
Prince Qing Xia felt their bodies vibrate as they were pushed back.
Neither of them gained the upper-hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s punch included the Original Water King Body power.
Although it was only on the first tier of area powers, it was still
quite strong, and Prince Qing Xia could fight against Han Sen as an
equal. It seemed as if the rumors of the Prince’s weakened body
were not quite accurate.</p>
<p>“Extreme King really does have many elites. I can never
underestimate anyone.” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Many princes and princesses were watching from a distance, and
they found themselves surprised again.</p>
<p>Bai Yi was well-known for being quite reckless and exceptionally
greedy. Bai Qing Xia was known for being very weak and sick. For
two princes like that to fight under the king tree was quite
weird.</p>
<p>It might have been an understandable conflict if it took place
somewhere else, but the king tree was only a hundred miles away.
Both princes were beneath the King’s Cover. Even geniuses like Bai
Wuchang and Bai Ling Shuang wouldn’t enter that place. And those
two princes had.</p>
<p>The King’s Cover wasn’t a dangerous place, but it had the king
tree’s king air blessing. If the king tree gave them its approval,
they would earn its protection. They’d be protected by the
Kingese.</p>
<p>If they were not approved, then they would simply stand there
and nothing would happen.</p>
<p>Many princes and princesses hoped to earn the protection of the
Kingese, but amidst their uncertainty, none wished to try. If they
didn’t earn the protection of King’s Cover or have much Kingese,
they would be laughed at for being unlucky.</p>
