<h2>Danger</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2035</h3>

<p>The silver glass bug’s wings had been broken. There were knife
marks adorning its body, and its shell had been battered to the
point where its flesh was mostly exposed. It was gushing silver
blood everywhere.</p>
<p>This guy’s life must have been a tough one for it to be so
determined. Even in a state like that, it had come looking for Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Seeing the silver glass bug coming toward him, Han Sen couldn’t
help but raise a wry smile. His situation was even more dire than
the silver glass bug’s. He didn’t have half the power he would need
to fight a scary xenogeneic such as that.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>The silver glass bug came over to Han Sen and coughed up silver
blood. It looked like it was doing just as badly as he was.</p>
<p>“I say, Brother… Since we are both looking like this, why don’t
we try to get along? We could just not step on each other’s toes
for a time.” Han Sen was heavily injured, and he scooted backwards
across the ground as he spoke to the silver glass bug.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if the insect would understand him, but he
didn’t have many options. He did not have the time to fight, as his
body was aching and his fingers were soft.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug did not understand Han Sen. The jaws filled
with saw-like teeth opened wide, and it came snapping at him.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not do anything. He summoned a beast soul armor
and put it on. He didn’t have the strength to dodge the bug’s
attacks.</p>
<p>The armor provided Han Sen a small boon of power, but it also
took that same power to use it. He was so soft right now that he
had absolutely no strength.</p>
<p>There was no point in thinking about using the Demon Stone Cow
beast soul, as shapeshifting beast souls were quite taxing on the
body. In Han Sen’s condition, he could not afford to spend any more
energy.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug jumped on Han Sen. The monster’s claws
scrabbled around as it kept trying to bite Han Sen.</p>
<p>But the beast was heavily injured, too. Its strength was low,
and it could no longer use silver light. Its jaws weren’t as strong
as Han Sen expected, and when it latched onto Han Sen, its teeth
could not penetrate his armor. All that was left were some light
marks.</p>
<p>Han Sen let out a sigh of relief. If the bug couldn’t kill him
while he was wearing that armor, he might stand a chance.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug soon grasped the situation, as well. It
gave up trying to gnaw through Han Sen’s armor, and it grabbed Han
Sen by the leg instead. Then, it dragged Han Sen away and into
another cave.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know where the silver glass bug was taking him,
but he had no strength to fight back. So, he decided to play dead
and allow the bug to drag him deep into the recesses of the caves.
He focused on trying to recover his body, hoping that he could at
least regain enough strength to fight if the need arose.</p>
<p>Earlier, Han Sen had hung around in the cave beneath the silver
statue that held the Beginning of Ancient God. He had not traversed
the entire cave system, however.</p>
<p>Now that the silver glass bug was tugging him along, he soon
found himself passing down tunnels he had never seen before. The
silver glass bug marched forward relentlessly.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug was heavily injured. It dragged Han Sen
very slowly, and after half an hour, they both found themselves
inside a giant cave. Han Sen heard the sound of running water, and
he looked up to see a pool that had flowers in it.</p>
<p>Han Sen glanced around. He thought he might have been dragged to
the very bottom of the cavern system. The pool before him must have
connected to the waterfall outside. He could still hear water
sounds from there.</p>
<p>The walls of the cavern were laced with vines. They were covered
in leaves, but there did not seem to be any fruit. It was difficult
to tell what type they might have been.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug continued to drag Han Sen. Judging from the
way it was going, the silver glass bug was dragging Han Sen towards
the pool.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before Han Sen realized something was wrong,
though. The silver glass bug was heavily injured. It had opted to
drag Han Sen all the way there instead of prioritizing its own
grievous wounds. It had obviously brought Han Sen there for more
than just a simple bath.</p>
<p>“What does it want? Why did it drag me to this pool? Does it
want to drown me?” Han Sen thought to himself as he eyed the
pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too weak to use his Dongxuan Aura, so all he had to
rely on was his basic eyesight and hearing. But for the time being,
he couldn’t hear anything unusual. All he heard was the sound of
water.</p>
<p>But when he looked carefully at the pool, his face turned
glum.</p>
<p>Inside the pool, Han Sen spotted a giant black shadow. It looked
like something had been hidden deep within the pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what that patch of darkness was. Perhaps it
really was just a shadow, but when Han Sen took the silver bug’s
behavior into consideration, he determined that the pool was
nothing nice.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to resist, but his body was weak. He could not
pull his legs free from the bug’s mouth, and he could not stop the
bug from entering the water.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug kept bleeding, but it insisted on dragging
Han Sen to the pool. When it reached the pool’s edge, it gathered
itself and then lobbed Han Sen into the water.</p>
<p>Han Sen struggled, but it was no use. He plunged into the
water.</p>
<p>When the icy water touched him, it jolted him awake. He felt a
bit of strength return to him, and he tried to swim back to the
shore.</p>
<p>But the silver glass bug was standing guard at the edge of the
water. When Han Sen got too close, the bug’s claws flashed forward
to whack him on the head. It sent Han Sen tumbling back into the
pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried swimming to another shore, but the silver glass
bug was not willing to let him go. As soon as he grew close to
land, the creature used its claws to knock him back into the water
again.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been on Dream Island for a long time, digging for
gemstones underwater. He was good in the water, but he did not have
any strength right now. Merely keeping himself from sinking was all
that he could manage. If he fought the silver glass bug, he’d
collapse after only a couple rounds. He was already struggling to
breathe in the water, so he did not dare go too close to the shore
again.</p>
<p>The silver bug was afraid of something, though. That seemed to
be why it was avoiding the water itself. It was still injured badly
enough to remove its ability to fly.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not go to the shore again, so it stayed where it
was. It kept squealing at Han Sen, sounding very angry as it
did.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried his best to stay afloat, but when he looked down,
he could not see much in the water beneath himself. The depths of
the pool looked like a black hole beneath him. He could not see the
shadow that he had noticed beneath the surface.</p>
<p>He could not see anything, but he sensed something moving in the
darkness beneath him. It seemed like it was rising, too, which made
his stomach sink.</p>
<p>“Am I going to die today?” Han Sen had a very strong will, but
his circumstances filled him with hopelessness. He felt the shadow
grow larger.</p>
