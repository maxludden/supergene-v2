      When Han Sen returned to the oceanside, Queen was using her sword to
      skewer and cook fish meat. Although the fire was only fuelled by vines and
      sticks, it seemed decent enough to last.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw a few other swords propped up beside the fire as well, each
      packed with meat. The slices of fish were gold, and the oil sizzled on
      them in a tantalizingly. Han Sen had to ask, &#8220;Is this for me?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What do you mean, are they for you? I am planning to eat them once
      they are all done,&#8221; Queen responded.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Can I have some?&#8221; Han Sen asked politely.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you want; suit yourself.&#8221; Queen did not look at Han Sen
      once, and continued to stare at the meat in her hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen smiled. He picked up some meat and took a bite. Unfortunately, he
      should have waited, for his mouth burnt with the heat. Still, this fresh
      fish tasted divine compared to the raw fish they had been eating
      previously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Where is your fox?&#8221; Queen watched Han Sen eat like a madman
      and, feeling more relaxed, posed the question.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I took it back.&#8221; Han Sen blinked as he told her.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Really?&#8221; Queen looked at Han Sen, not believing him.
      &#8220;Summon him so we can all eat together.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s no need. It is just a pet; ignore the
      creature.&#8221; Han Sen thought Queen had learnt something else about the
      silver fox when it healed her, but he wasn&#8217;t willing to admit it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Queen didn&#8217;t enquire any further and simply
      continued cooking her meat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ate eight slices of meat. With a bloated belly, he fell backwards
      into the sand. After a large exhale of content, he called out,
      &#8220;Awesome!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen ate a few, too. But when she was done, she returned her beast soul
      sword and started walking off towards the hills.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Han Sen sat up and asked, worrying over
      whether or not Queen would find out about the silver fox and lotus.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m just going for a walk,&#8221; Queen replied, already
      walking off to the hills.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll come with you!&#8221; Han Sen jumped up with a fright
      and thought to himself, &#8220;I really can&#8217;t hide the silver
      fox&#8217;s reason for not coming back.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      It wouldn&#8217;t be difficult for Queen to discover where the lotus and
      the silver fox were. After ascending a small hill, she caught sight of
      them both from afar. She turned around and looked at Han Sen. With a cocky
      smile, she turned back and began walking towards the fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is that?&#8221; Queen pointed towards the lotus as she neared
      the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but the silver fox refused to leave after
      finding it,&#8221; Han Sen explained. Queen took a closer look at the
      lotus and began to rest near it without responding.
    </p>

    <p>The next day, Queen asked Han Sen, &#8220;Are you leaving?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If the silver fox isn&#8217;t leaving, then neither am I. Do you
      want to leave first?&#8221; Han Sen asked, blinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If we meet again, we will split it in half.&#8221; Queen looked at
      Han Sen, but it didn&#8217;t look like she wanted to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What half? It is a pet. You want to fight for food with a
      pet?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was saying no and he was only
      pretending.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If he eats it, I don&#8217;t want it anymore. If you take it, I
      will accept half,&#8221; Queen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why would I want it? This is for the silver fox. I am not a pet; I
      don&#8217;t need it,&#8221; Han Sen told her, sharply. He was starting to
      feel a little annoyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen didn&#8217;t say much, and she remained near the silver fox,
      guarding the lotus.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The silver fox was guarding it, which made me think I had a chance.
      But now there are two people guarding it.&#8221; Han Sen thought to
      himself. He was also starting to believe that the silver fox was a girl.
      Otherwise, why would it be behaving like Queen was? That was the only
      explanation for how selfish it was being.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen never thought about the possibility that he was more selfish than
      the silver fox and Queen combined.
    </p>

    <p>
      They stayed on the island for four days. The snow-white flowers started to
      wilt, but they did so slowly. Only two petals fell off a day. SInce there
      were so many, heaven only knew how long it would take for the entire thing
      to wilt.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lotus seeds on the inside were growing bigger, as well. They looked
      like blood crystals, and they continued to grow fuller. They emitted a
      pleasant fragrance, and smelling it brought comfort and relaxation to
      their minds.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That must be some good stuff, but how can I take all the seeds
      without Queen and the silver fox noticing?&#8221; Han Sen watched the
      lotus intently each day, all the while fostering a plan to take it from
      the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not sure if he could beat them both; otherwise, he&#8217;d
      just grab it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Half a month later, the petals had all come off. The lotus itself was now
      like a plate. The blood crystal seeds were so round and full, they looked
      like rubies the size of a pigeon&#8217;s egg.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had yet to come up with an idea that would allow him to claim
      ownership of the seeds, but all of a sudden, he heard the shriek of a
      bird. He saw a green and blueish-colored bird that didn&#8217;t look too
      far removed from a peacock. With no idea where it had come from, Han Sen
      saw it fly madly around the sky, cawing as loudly as it could. It also
      seemed to be afraid of the three of them, which stayed its desire to come
      down.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox now looked nervous. It stood up and looked at the peacock
      in the sky as if it were an enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Queen were shocked. They understood that it was most likely a
      super creature, seeing as it paid little heed to the silver fox&#8217;s
      presence. This made their faces bleak.
    </p>

    <p>
      The peacock continued to circle them in the sky, refusing to leave. But
      neither did it want to come down. It seemed as if it was waiting for the
      seeds to ripen, just like they were.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Where did that bird come from? Why would it be out here at
      sea?&#8221; Han Sen thought only the silver fox and Queen were competing
      with him for the seeds. If things had remained that way, at least he had a
      fair chance of obtaining a few of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now with a super creature in the vicinity, who knew what might happen?
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps even the combination of Han Sen and the silver fox wouldn&#8217;t
      be enough to fight the super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen was feeling depressed amidst these thoughts, suddenly heard
      a sound at the seashore. Looking out to the ocean, he watched the waters
      boil. A lobster with a purple shell that was a dozen meters long emerged.
      It remained afloat for a brief while, summoning up tall waves.
    </p>

    <p>It then moved on to circle the island, without getting too close.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Crap! Another one. How many creatures want these seeds?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt frustrated. He didn&#8217;t know when and where another super
      creature might arise, but fortunately, no more decided to make an
      appearance. Aside from the peacock and lobster, there was no sign of
      another one coming to vie for their seeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      With one of them taking the sea and one of them taking the sky, it would
      be impossible for him to escape now.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s fall back. If we get surrounded, there is nothing we
      can do to fight them,&#8221; Queen calmly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Silver fox, come!&#8221; Han Sen shouted at the silver fox, with a
      tone of gravity. He was afraid if the silver fox stayed here to guard, he
      would quickly be overwhelmed by the two super creatures. Even though it
      was a super creature itself, its strength had limits.
