    <p>
      In the pool, in the direction the silver fox was looking, swam a fish.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fish wasn&#8217;t very large. In fact, it was only about ten
      centimeters long, and it was semi-transparent. The bones were transparent,
      as well, and the only way you could properly catch sight of it was by
      spotting its blood vessels. If you didn&#8217;t peer at the water
      carefully and look for it that way, you wouldn&#8217;t notice it existed
      at all.
    </p>

    <p>Because of the water, Han Sen was unable to sense its lifeforce.</p>

    <p>
      Instead, he summoned his devil-eye mask and managed to espy the presence
      of a flame on the fish. It was its lifeforce, and it burned as hot as any
      other super creature&#8217;s did.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That little thing is a super creature?!&#8221; Han Sen felt a
      mixture of shock and confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The energy inside the little fish was blurry, so it was only a
      first-generation super creature. And since the fish did not appear to
      possess the elemental properties of thunder, Han Sen wondered why the
      silver fox seemed to show so much interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox lay down near the pool and did not move. After a while, it
      began circling the pool as it had when it first arrived. The little
      blighter almost seemed to be lost in thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What does he want?&#8221; Han Sen said to himself, as he observed
      the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the silver fox wanted to kill the fish, then it could have very well
      done so. The pool wasn&#8217;t very deep, only about three feet deep at
      the very most. He could even effortlessly electrify the water with
      lightning, without a single worry about aquatic retaliation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plus, Han Sen was there. If the silver fox wanted to attack and felt that
      it needed backup, surely it knew its master wouldn&#8217;t sit idly by
      watching it tussle with the fishy wretch all by itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, all the silver fox did was lie down near the pool again. It watched
      the little transparent fish swimming around and did nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was very curious what was going on, but there was nothing he could
      do. He could only wait. If he got close to the pool, the silver fox would
      approach Han Sen and make a fearsome face. Understanding how powerful his
      pet had gotten, Han Sen wasn&#8217;t willing to take any chances with
      somehow invoking the ire of the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not long after, a sheep entered the cave the silver fox had dug. It
      didn&#8217;t seem to be afraid of people, and it strutted right over
      beside Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the sheep saw the pool, it baa&#8217;ed. It walked towards the pool
      as if it were thirsty and fancied a drink.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought the silver fox was going to stop it, but it didn&#8217;t.
      It continued to lie where it was, watching the sheep quench its thirst at
      the pool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought the fish might have been angry at this intrusion, but it
      didn&#8217;t have any negative reaction. In fact, it didn&#8217;t look as
      if the fish cared at all. It continued to swim as mellowly as it had the
      entire time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sheep drank quite a bit, and once it was done, it turned around and
      prepared to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what Han Sen saw next was a most terrifying scene. The sheep&#8217;s
      mouth began to rot, and bits of sizzling flesh fell to the ground below.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make it all the more unnerving, the sheep acted as if it had not
      noticed a thing. It wasn&#8217;t in pain or anything, and it merely
      continued to trot back towards the outside as casually as it had entered.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it walked, more of its flesh fizzled away from its face, coating the
      cavern floor in blood. It began to happen elsewhere on its body, as goopy
      chunks of its flesh slid free from the bones of the sheep they once
      composed. It wasn&#8217;t long until parts of its skeleton were exposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sheep continued walking to the exit, and by the time it left the cave,
      it was nothing but a skeleton. In a grizzly, horrific mess, its organs lay
      scattered and strewn all about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the sheep walk outside alive, with only its bones to indicate what
      it was, Han Sen could hardly believe his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was given a cold sweat, seeing this. And now, he quickly
      understood why the silver fox did not want him to approach. The liquid in
      that pool was by no means a consumable refreshment.
    </p>

    <p>For the fish itself to survive inside there, it had to be a miracle.</p>

    <p>
      Then, from outside the cave, a chorus of baaing could be heard. Han Sen
      quickly ran out and saw that all the other sheep were frightened and
      trying to avoid the sheep that was now just a skeleton. But it really did
      seem as if the skellysheep hadn&#8217;t noticed anything amiss, and it
      continued to believe it was the same as the rest of its fluffy companions.
      It tried following the other sheep around, unaware of why it was being
      avoided.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the skellysheep followed them around, however, it wasn&#8217;t long
      before Han Sen heard something snap. Several of its bones broke, and it
      collapsed on the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What the h*ll is the water in that pool?&#8221; Han Sen thought to
      himself, in utter disbelief at the ghastly sight he had just witnessed.
      When he returned to look at the creepy pool, his heart pounded with fear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen sniffed the air and did not notice anything that smelled amiss, so
      at the very least it wasn&#8217;t a natural acid.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seemed as if the water came from the stalactites above. A pool had
      formed from the constant dripping.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked up and noticed a number of cracks inside the stalactites,
      indicating the water must have leaked out from inside them. But the amount
      of water coming from them was very little. There were ten stalactites, and
      there was only one drop every few minutes. God only knew how many years it
      would have taken for the pool to be created.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Silver, if you keep waiting here, it&#8217;ll all be for
      nothing. If you want this fish out of the pool, don&#8217;t expect it to
      do so by itself. Perhaps we should bang our heads together and think of a
      way in which we can get it out ourselves, eh?&#8221; Han Sen spoke to
      Little Silver as he continued to lie prone, watching the fish.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox then turned around and looked at Han Sen, as if he was
      expecting Han Sen to suggest a plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Use your thunder. Electrify the water, spook it out, and then grab
      it.&#8221; Han Sen suggested after a short period of thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox looked at Han Sen with disdain. It cast lightning out onto
      the surface of the water, but it didn&#8217;t seem to do anything. It
      appeared as if it dissolved when it came into contact with the curious
      liquid of the pool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now Han Sen understood the look he had been given, realizing the lightning
      could not penetrate the surface of the water.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this water, then? What makes it behave like that?&#8221;
      Han Sen was shocked. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay. If the thunder is
      absorbed by the water, I&#8217;d like to see it absorb this.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen&#8217;s dialogue came to a close, he quickly summoned his
      peacock crossbow, loaded it with raw Z-steel bolts, and took aim at the
      fish in the pool.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox&#8217;s eyes opened wide and it retreated a few steps,
      expecting Han Sen to kill the fish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Approaching the pool a little closer, Han Sen corrected his aim to obtain
      perfect accuracy on the fish. He predicted its movement and then pulled
      the trigger.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when the bolt pierced the water, he somehow missed. The surface of the
      pool was mirror-like, giving a reflection far clearer than average water
      would. Therefore, the fish&#8217;s position in the water was different
      than it appeared. The bolt missed and lodged itself inside the rocky
      bottom of the pool. This made Han Sen feel pretty bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      The water was terrifying, and Han Sen didn&#8217;t think he could retrieve
      the Z-steel raw bolt with any modicum of ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he didn&#8217;t dwell on it too much, but instead retrieved another
      Z-steel bolt and took aim at the fish once more. Han Sen calculated its
      path and took into account the refraction of the water.
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>
      The bolt pierced the water and the fish&#8217;s body. Its body did not
      resist the flight of the bolt in the slightest, and all it did was twitch
      a little before flipping over dead. It died, as simple as that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen froze. He did not expect the creepy fish to die so easily. There
      was no struggle, and it was killed with a single shot.
