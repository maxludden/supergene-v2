  In the universe outside the core area, the heirs of deifieds were known for having better-than-average genes. They had incredible potential, but when they were born, they weren’t that different from ordinary people or creatures. They would still need to level up.

It was like the deified jade toad that lived in Narrow Moon. Its small offspring started at the lowest class of xenogeneic, and they would have to level up over the years. Most of them would never reach deified rank, though. And what rank they reached would be largely dependent on what resources they had available.

Of course, there were some creatures that were born deified. There weren’t many of those, though. The most famous of those came from the second top race, the Ancient Gods. Those beings were born deified. They were born as primitive deifieds, and they had to work their way up from there. Many were able to become butterflies, with others managing to reach the prestigious level of true god.

When Han Sen had seen the Ancient Water God, that deified was a true god. The Ancient Water God Origin was still in Han Sen’s possession, so if there was ever a new Ancient Water God, it would be a primitive deified.

But such cases were very rarely seen in the geno universe. And on top of that, this was the core area. It was hard to make babies there, and the odds of having a child be born deified were astronomically low.

Normally, xenogeneics that were born deified could grow a lot if they gained enough resources. They could certainly become a butterfly and possibly reach the rank of true god.

Exquisite and Li Keer observed the smaller Crocodile God with wide eyes. Born-deifieds were highly coveted as silkworms. They were the best of the best.

If they were already deified, there would be no need for them to grow. Plus, they would have exceptional talent. They could certainly reach the rank of butterfly. And with some luck, they could become true gods.

Li Keer’s primary goal was to gain a butterfly. She wanted a butterfly silkworm.

The Ancient Gods had no interest in becoming silkworms of the Very High. Otherwise, all of the Very High would have fought for Ancient Gods to be their silkworms. Across history, very few of the Ancient Gods had become silkworms for the Very High. The total number could be counted on one hand.

That small Crocodile God was definitely as strong as an Ancient God. Exquisite and Li Keer really wanted it.

But they knew that this wasn’t the time to try to claim a silkworm. Their lives were in its scaled hands.

The small Crocodile God happily trotted over before Han Sen and the others. It looked at the three of them with curiosity.

But its eyes were so small. No matter how Han Sen chose to inspect them, they were tiny.

Han Sen now understood that he had held a false impression of the Crocodile God. It wasn’t looking at them with disdain; the creature’s eyes just grew like that.

The big Crocodile God came crawling over, calling to the small Crocodile God. The small Crocodile God’s black light faded. Han Sen and the other two felt the pressure of gravity release them. They stood up.

They didn’t know what the Crocodile Gods were thinking, but one thing was for sure: the Crocodile Gods had no intention of killing them.

Exquisite and Li Keer were good at sensing things. They could feel that the Crocodile Gods harbored no murderous intent toward them.

The big Crocodile God headed toward the hole. The small Crocodile God climbed atop its back. It looked back and made a noise at Han Sen and the others.

Exquisite and Li Keer were good at sensing things, so they knew immediately what it meant. Han Sen’s sensing abilities were inferior, but even he could guess that the Crocodile God wanted them to follow it.

The three of them looked at each other, then entered the hole. Li Keer and Exquisite couldn’t escape, and Han Sen was keen on knowing what the crocodiles were up to.

Han Sen could see that the hole wasn’t very big, and thus, he didn’t think that it was very deep. When he entered, he swiftly realized that he was wrong. The bottomless hole seemed to go straight to the core of the planet.

The three of them followed the two crocodiles, plunging into the gaping hole. They didn’t know how far they had descended, but they found themselves near the planet’s core, looking out on a sea of lava.

In truth, the red liquid was thicker and darker than lava. It was like the hydrogen that burned in the sun.

“This must be the core of this planet. The Crocodile God must live here.” Exquisite frowned. She had noticed this place when her Very High Sense first scanned the planet, but all she knew was that the sea at the core seemed to be undergoing nuclear fusion. She hadn’t realized that the small Crocodile God resided here.

Patong!

Still carrying the small Crocodile God, the big one plunged into the sea. The creature moved as if the horrifying heat at the center of this planet was no more than an ordinary hot spring.

The Small Crocodile God sent a low rumble toward Han Sen and the others. It told them to continue following.

“Crocodile Gods, your bodies might be able to endure the heat, but ours cannot,” Han Sen said with dismay.

Just standing next to the sea made him feel as if his Dongxuan Armor was melting. It wouldn’t hold if he had to enter the dark red lava.

The big Crocodile God’s body flashed with a black light, which flew over to surround Han Sen and the others. The burning sensation of the intense heat disappeared.

The small Crocodile God rumbled at them again, like it was hurrying them to follow.

The big Crocodile God didn’t have that much patience. As Han Sen and the others still hesitated to follow them in, their bodies suddenly felt so heavy. They sank into the sea, dropping into it like dumplings.

Luckily, they had the black aura for protection, which kept the heat from harming them. The powerful force of gravity continued to pull them deeper into the lava, though. When their vision returned, they were already out of the burning sea.

They had reached the center of the planet, and yet, it was like a city. No lava was visible anywhere, but what they saw shocked the three of them.

Even Exquisite’s eyes grew round. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.

The planet’s core had buildings like a space fortress. It was obviously man-made. It couldn’t have been naturally generated.

The whole of the space castle gave off a technological feel. Everything was made from crystal, but that magical space fortress was in disarray. It had been badly ruined, so most of the very complicated crystal machinery that Han Sen could see everywhere had stopped working. Only a few were running, with lights blinking across them like pleas for help.

Upon seeing the space fortress and machines, Han Sen was shocked. He almost screamed out, “No way! Why does this place look like a crystallizer control room?”
