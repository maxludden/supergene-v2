<h2>Exclusive Gene Race</h2>

<p>The purple gene egg was godly. With the way it glowed, it looked
like something abnormal.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just holding the gene egg, but the blood dragon God
Spirit Blood-Pulse was already reacting to it. It was wandering
around it.</p>
<p>“That is not normal. This is a gene egg that was born from a
blood dragon flying into the sky weird scene. It would be normal
for it to be affected by a blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse.”
Han Sen’s heart jumped. Blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse air
started to spill. It flowed into the gene egg.</p>
<p>This time, Han Sen did not have to draw his own blood for the
gene egg to hatch. Surrounded by a shiny, glowing, purple light,
the gene egg’s shell started to melt. It quickly disappeared. It
revealed the gene race inside the gene egg.</p>
<p>It was a small snake with purple scales. It was the size of a
chopstick. It was that small.</p>
<p>The scales of its body were extremely beautiful. It was like
they were formed with purple crystals. The eyes of the creature
were like purple gems. They glistened with purple light.</p>
<p>The blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse was bursting. The small
snake was sucked into the Sea of Soul.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked. He was wondering, “What is an exclusive
gene race?”</p>
<p>He summoned the blood god dragon and tried it a few times. Han
Sen finally knew what an exclusive gene race meant. He also better
understood the God Spirit Blood-Pulse.</p>
<p>When Han Sen used the blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse and
another gene race, it did not make much difference when compared to
him using a gene race normally. His gene combined skill was not any
stronger. If it was used under the blood dragon God Spirit
Blood-Pulse mode, and he used the blood god dragon, it made the
blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse increase.</p>
<p>From what Han Sen understood, the God Spirit Blood-Pulse
provided the most basic powers. As to how he could use the God
Spirit Blood-Pulse power, it required a gene race to finish.</p>
<p>When Han Sen used the blood dragon God Spirit Blood-Pulse, it
only increased power. If it combined with a blood god dragon, it
turned that power into blood god dragon gene combined skills. It
made the gene combined skill limitlessly increase in power.</p>
<p>A newborn blood god dragon did not have much power when used
with a gene combine skill. When it had the blood dragon God Spirit
Blood-Pulse buff, the gene combined skill power was better than an
adult blood god dragon.</p>
<p>Of course, to receive that buff, the blood dragon God Spirit
Blood-Pulse exclusive gene race was required. Non-exclusive gene
races did not receive the advantages.</p>
<p>The blood god dragon’s gene combine skill was a blood dragon
flying into the sky weird scene. It was a very overbearing attack
skill. When it had the God Spirit Blood-Pulse buff, it was really
overbearing even if it was still a juvenile. If the blood god
dragon reached its ultimate body, at that time, the power would be
unimaginable.</p>
<p>“I got the blood god dragon and blood dragon God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. That is very good, but I did make an enemy out of Gong
Shu Zhi. That guy is a master-class mister. His subordinates will
be powerful, and he will have lots of scary gene eggs. I am not
afraid of him, but Mister Yang and the others will have to be. I
have to go get a pure light salamander soon.” Han Sen stopped
hesitating. He followed the stream, going as fast as he could to
reach Autumn Leaves River.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in a hurry to get there. On his way, he was not in
the mood to hunt other gene eggs. He was going as fast as he could
to reach Autumn Leaves River. He was hiding near the shore, looking
for a pure light salamander.</p>
<p>Autumn Leaves River was just a branching river, but it was still
a thousand miles long. He did not know where the pure light
salamanders were.</p>
<p>When Han Sen arrived at the river, he looked into the water of
the river and realized his reflection had become the big sky demon
again. She smiled at him.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not figure out a way to deal with her. He
pretended he did not see anything</p>
<p>“Do you want to find a pure light salamander? I can help you, my
little lover.” This time, the big sky demon was worse. She turned
into his shadow and spoke to him.</p>
<p>“OK. How can you help?” Han Sen smiled as if he was talking to a
friend.</p>
<p>The big sky demon was shocked. She smiled harder. “Follow the
river. When you see a white jade cliff, you will see the pure light
salamander.”</p>
<p>After that, the big sky demon’s reflection was gone. Han Sen’s
reflection was ordinary again. Han Sen could not find it, so he
just did what the big sky demon told him. He followed the river.
When it was nighttime, he saw the river had a canyon. The two sides
were composed of white jade-like stone that emitted a crystal, holy
light. It looked very weird. Han Sen carefully snuck to one side of
the wall. He looked into the water. He saw three one-foot-long
creatures that looked like Chinese giant salamanders. The pure
light salamanders, however, were cuter. They were playing around in
the water.</p>
<p>The holy light salamanders looked like white jade. Their eyes
looked like black gems and were very cute.</p>
<p>Han Sen hid inside the mountain for a while. He saw the three
pure light salamanders swimming around. Their bodies were releasing
a holy light. Their skin was like transparent jade.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry.” Han Sen’s body was like a hawk as he jumped up.
He sprinted toward the water while casting the Xuan Yellow Sutra.
He suddenly broke the river water and attacked the three pure light
salamanders. Han Sen did not use a gene race. The three pure light
salamanders were unable to sense him beforehand. By the time they
realized danger was near, it was already too late. One punch took
out a salamander. One by one, Han Sen turned them into agate-like
eggs.</p>
<p>In Gong Shu Manor, Gong Shu Zhi’s eyes were red. His old tears
continued to pour.</p>
<p>Gong Shu Zhi was very famous. He had many wives, but Gong Shu
Jin was his only son. Now, his son had been murdered. How could he
not be sad and angry?</p>
<p>“Master, I found out the man is called Han Sen. He did not have
any relations with Mister Jin, but Mister Jin was courting the
singer Feng Fei Fei. He encountered this person in Night Cry
Valley.” A person who looked like an old servant was reporting to
Gong Shu Zhi. “No matter what my son did wrong, he should not have
killed him. I will avenge my son’s death!” Gong Shu Zhi looked
frozen, but his eyes glimmered with evilness.</p>
<p>“Mister Jin only investigated Han Sen once, but he managed to
find out he was from a town called Ancient God City,” the old
servant said. “I think the investigation must have come to an
incorrect conclusion. Should I start over?”</p>
<p>Gong Shu Zhi shook his head. “There is no need to. It does not
matter where he is from. This place is Big Qin Capital. I just need
to know he is not some high-level person from the capital. No
matter who he is, he will pay the price of blood for what he did to
my son.”</p>
<p>Speaking of that, Gong Shu Zhi looked murderous. He coldly
asked, “As for Feng Fei Fei, did my son not like her? Let her be
with my son in case he gets lonely down there.”</p>
<p>The old servant worriedly said, “Master, that is not a good
thing. Feng Fei Fei is one of the three most popular singers. She
is like the singer queen. She has many powerful people supporting
her. Even the real big nobles admire her. I am afraid…”</p>
<p>“I have my ways, and they will all have to die with my son!”
Gong Shu Zhi’s eyes looked very angry.</p>
