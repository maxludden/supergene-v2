Han Sen was shocked by what was in the 33rd sky. This was the final layer of the 33 skies. According to theory, this should have been the most dangerous layer.

Everything Han Sen was seeing was the complete opposite of dangerous. This place had a sea of clouds everywhere. It was like heaven. Amidst the endless sea of clouds, there was a tablet. It was like it was touching the sky and touching hell. Even from quite far away, one could make out the words scribed on the tablet.

“Geno tablet.” Han Sen noticed the giant tablet had those two words. It was not unlike the words Han Sen saw on Bai Mo’s stone stove.

Han Sen looked around. In the 33rd sky, aside from that stone tablet, there was absolutely nothing else.

Han Sen’s heart jumped. He went closer to the geno tablet and walked around it. That stone tablet was rectangular. “Geno tablet” was written on each of its sides. There were only those two words. Aside from that, there was nothing else of note.

Han Sen could not determine what was the top of the tablet or see what was on the bottom of the tablet. Although Han Sen could reach anywhere with one thought, no matter how fast he could move, he could not reach the end. It was like the stone tablet extended to both sides with no end. No matter how high Han Sen flew, he could not reach the end.

“What is this stone tablet?” Han Sen thought the stone tablet was not normal, but it was not a gene race. He at least knew that much. It did not look like some sort of sacrifice either. It looked really weird.

Han Sen reached out his hand to touch the stone tablet. He thought his spirit body would not be able to touch the stone tablet. After he had only just touched the stone tablet, it started to shine. The words “Geno tablet” lit up.

Han Sen immediately withdrew his hands. He looked at the stone tablet. The four sides of words briefly lit up and then went dim.

A mysterious voice was echoing from the stone table. It said, “Geno evolution has not reached the necessary requirement. The geno tablet cannot be opened.”

The geno tablet then returned to how it looked before. Han Sen was confused. He put his hand on the geno tablet, but everything was the same again.

The geno tablet lit up, but then it went dim. That weird voice still bellowed through that zone.

“What is this thing? Is it some sort of powerful sacrifice?” Han Sen leered at it with greed. He reached out his hand to hold the tablet and see if he could take it away with him.

If that thing was a sacrifice, it would be tremendously powerful. If he was able to take it with him, it might one day prove useful.

Han Sen did not have enough power to touch the geno tablet. Aside from making it light up, it told Han Sen he was not qualified enough every single time. He could not make it do anything aside from that.

“What kind of crap is this? I am not interested in it.” Seeing that he could not do anything to move it, Han Sen promptly gave up. He walked around the geno tablet in profound disappointment. He still could not uncover what the enigma was.

“Never mind. The 33rd sky really is too weird. Let me go ahead and see if I can return to the geno universe.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He flew into the sky. He traveled a billion lightyears away, but he never escaped the 33rd sky.

Han Sen kept moving. It did not matter how fast he flew or how far he went, the 33rd sky looked as if it did not have an end. He could not fly out anywhere.

“This 33rd sky is so weird. It cannot go through my spirit body.” Han Sen frowned and looked at the geno tablet. He was thinking, “Does that mean the 33rd itself has a connection to the geno tablet? If I want to go through this sky, will I have to activate the geno tablet? If things are indeed like that, going through the 33rd sky will not be as simple as I thought it would be.”

Han Sen tried investigating the geno tablet some more, but everything was still the same. The geno tablet still refused Han Sen’s attempts to activate it.

“What is this broken tablet? I am a pure spirit body. I cannot use geno arts. If I was able to, I would break this stupid, broken stone tablet.” Han Sen was depressed as he spoke to himself.

Han Sen stayed in the 33rd sky for what seemed like an eternity, yet he could not unravel a single secret that shrouded the mystery of that geno tablet. He could not make the geno table approve him. He could not go through the 33rd sky.

While he was deep in thought, his heart suddenly jumped. It was like another lifeforce entered the 33rd sky.

“Is another lifeforce able to enter the 33rd sky?” Han Sen was shocked by this. His heart jumped. He then dived into the sea of clouds.

A life able to enter the 33rd sky had to be unique. This life might have even been able to see his spirit body, so Han Sen made sure to hide and see if he could snag a peek at who had just arrived.

Han Sen thought, “It cannot be Qin Xiu. If it was him, it would be my chance. Qin Xiu gave up his body. He entered the black crystal armor with a spirit body. I have a spirit body too. Does that mean I can enter the black crystal armor and fight with Qin Xiu to regain control of the black crystal armor? If I can take back control of the black crystal armor, it will do me a world of good. It may not be better than having my old body back, but it will surely beat my current condition.”

Not long later, Han Sen saw a body inside the 33rd sky. The figure quickly reached out for the geno tablet.

Han Sen had a closer look and almost screamed. The lifeforce that appeared near the geno tablet was the missing Ancient Devil, who had been gone for a long time.

“How has he managed to come to the 33rd sky? How did he manage such a thing?” Han Sen was shocked. He wanted to capture Ancient Devil and interrogate him.

But Han Sen only had a spirit body. Even if he was stronger than Ancient Devil now, he could not touch a single strand of hair on Ancient Devil’s body.

Ancient Devil floated in front of the geno tablet. He was like Han Sen. He put his hand on the geno tablet, and the geno tablet’s scribe lit up.

The results almost made Han Sen laugh out loud. Ancient Devil was like Han Sen. The geno tablet rejected Ancient Devil’s touch. The reasons why were identical to Han Sen. He was not strong enough.

Ancient Devil was troubled by this as well. He frowned and said to himself, “I took a risk to be reborn when the world rebooted. In the anti-material world, I came back here. I almost died. I finally reached this point, but I still cannot activate the geno tablet. Do I really need a reboot power to activate this geno tablet?”

When Han Sen heard that, he was shocked. “It looks like Ancient Devil really was a vice president of the God Chaos Party, but he is different from big sky demon and Bury Path God. He was reborn in the rebooting chaos. He kept his memories, but how did he come through the 33 skies? What would happen if the geno tablet is booted up? What benefit would Ancient Devil get out of it?”

Han Sen was very confused, but he was only a spirit body. There was nothing he could do about it.

According to theory, only the elites with a Break World rate of 100% could break the barriers between the main and reverse worlds. All this time, only the God Chaos Party’s former leader had been able to achieve that.

Ancient Devil was strong, but he had only been reborn once. He struggled through the sanctuary worlds. After everything he went through, he was imprisoned by Han Sen. His progress and what he had been able to achieve was severely slowed down.

Han Sen thought, “Ancient Devil must have a special way to break through the 33 skies. I just need to follow him. Perhaps then I can get through the 33 skies and reach the geno universe.”
