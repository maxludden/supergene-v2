<h2>Killing a Xenogeneic</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1723</h3>

<p>“Commander, where should I lead it?” Han Sen asked calmly.</p>
<p>Guris was shocked that the voice he heard was so relaxed. He
barked down the line, “Go to the south-east and buy Mister Tiger
some time! Wait until Mister Tiger is able to finish dealing with
the other.”</p>
<p>As soon as he said it, Guris realized that was one of the
strangest commands he had ever given. It was odd telling a soldier
to keep a xenogeneic busy for some time. People would think he was
crazy for issuing such an order, but he had no choice, given the
circumstances.</p>
<p>“Sure, but I can’t make any promises.” Han Sen agreed and
changed direction, leading the beast east.</p>
<p>“You do your best, son.” Guris gritted his teeth. He couldn’t
imagine that someone like Han Sen would delay the xenogeneic long
enough for Mister Tiger to kill his own enemy and move in to
help.</p>
<p>And when Guris reviewed Mister Tiger’s situation realistically,
he wasn’t even sure if the Noble would be able to fight another
xenogeneic immediately after. And that just made the situation even
more worrying.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved his body and dodged the xenogeneic’s attack. He
brought the xenogeneic over to the south-east as he had been
instructed to, but he wasn’t planning on waiting for Mister Tiger
to finish dealing with his own xenogeneic.</p>
<p>After moving through several different streets, Han Sen dipped
into a building. He deliberately broke his camera and his
communicator to avoid the prying eyes of the others and keep them
in the dark.</p>
<p>As Han Sen had led the xenogeneic forward, he had punched the
creature many times. None of his hits were effective, though. The
xenogeneic did not have geno armor, but it was far stronger than an
armored Kate. As a result, Han Sen could not deal any damage to the
creature’s body.</p>
<p>After Han Sen evaded the next strike of the xenogeneic, he put
the glove on his hand.</p>
<p>In the Alliance, Han Sen hadn’t been able to use the Northern
King Glove while wearing armor because he hadn’t possessed his own
geno armor. Now that he had generated his own set of armor, this
was no longer a problem. So, Han Sen was able to put the glove on
his right hand and make it look something more like a gauntlet.</p>
<p>Han Sen dodged another of the xenogeneic’s attack, delivering a
strike to the beast’s belly as he did.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The fist hit the belly, and it echoed like a drum. It didn’t
break the flesh, but the xenogeneic coughed up some blood. It
looked injured almost immediately.</p>
<p>Not that the attack really slowed it down. It came at Han Sen
with undiminished bloodlust.</p>
<p>Han Sen was fighting and falling back as he did, retreating into
the shelter of another building. He punched the xenogeneic, whose
body was scary. By this point, Han Sen had to have punched it with
his glove a dozen times. And while the beast was bleeding a lot, it
refused to die. It was a supremely powerful foe.</p>
<p>“If I had a sword that was sharp, I could kill them all,” Han
Sen thought, annoyed that he did not have a self geno weapon.</p>
<p>He couldn’t use the full power of the Northern King Glove. If he
could, he would have killed the xenogeneic with ease.</p>
<p>Han Sen used up a lot of his energy in the fight. The geno
universe’s power was too strong. His repeated castings were
exhausting his energy at an alarming rate, and Han Sen fought the
xenogeneic with all the effort and energy he could spare. But a
while after, he felt very tired.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen was about to give up and resort to taking the
enemy back to Mister Tiger, he felt something very hot on his back.
It was the Nine-Life Cat tattoo, sizzling on his back like a fresh
branding.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt immense pain due to it, but all of a sudden, his
exhaustion vanished. Hot power surged inside him, and his body’s
cells erupted like a volcano. It made Han Sen feel like he was
filled to the brim with power.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen punched the xenogeneic again, sending the creature
flying. It smacked into a concrete wall and left a deep hole in
it.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic fell down onto the floor, heaving up blood. The
place on the creature’s chest that had touched Han Sen’s fist was
scorched, as if the beast had been branded by his burning fist</p>
<p>Han Sen was, needless to say, happy about this. He ran forward
and gave the xenogeneic another punch. And where the next fist
landed, the entire patch of the beast’s skin was blackened.</p>
<p>Han Sen punched it another three times, and eventually, the
chest was broken and caved in. What was left was a black, gaping
hole where the heart had once been. It was dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Xenogeneic Baron hunted; Xenogeneic Gene Found.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it was because he had left the sanctuary, but the rules
seemed to have changed a bit. The announcements were starting to
get vaguer.</p>
<p>When the xenogeneic died, the heat on Han Sen’s back faded away.
His condition returned to normal.</p>
<p>Before he had the time to think about what happened with the
tattoo, though, Han Sen leaped over to the creature and pulled out
its ten nails. The nails were where the thing had mutated.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was dead, the monster’s body was far weaker.
Han Sen was able to remove the sharp blue nails with ease.</p>
<p>And after Han Sen took the ten nails, the body became much
softer. It returned to looking almost like a normal Kate. Its
previous strength was all gone.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen wondered how he might deal with the body, it
started to flare and burn. It quickly turned to ash, and when the
wind blew, it scattered like dust on the breeze.</p>
<p>Han Sen was frozen. He didn’t know Nine-Life Cat’s tattoo could
imbue him with such power.</p>
<p>“I need to find out what this whole Nine-Life Cat business is
about. Old Cat did say the reputation was bad. If it really is
infamous, however, it should be easy to learn a thing or two,” Han
Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, answer me! What’s going on!” Guris had seen Han Sen
enter the building, but he hadn’t seen what had transpired there.
He had wished to send someone else to check on Han Sen, but no one
had been willing to enter due to the fact that Han Sen had been
tangoing with a xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Soldiers were tasked with finding xenogeneics, not hunting them.
If they knew where a xenogeneic was, they wouldn’t go near it</p>
<p>Before Guris received a response, though, he saw someone exit
the building. It was Han Sen. The xenogeneic that had been chasing
him was gone.</p>
