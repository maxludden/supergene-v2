<p>Thousand Mile Reach knew Han Sen was not an ordinary person.
After all, he had been able to kill Steel Scene in Ice Snow God
Temple. There was no doubt that Han Sen was a god-blood noble, and
his Blood-Pulse and gene race was stronger than Steel Scene.</p>
<p>What did that matter? The grand teacher of the Qin Kingdom was
the strongest elite around. He was far greater than Steel Scene. He
would not have been allowed to be the king’s teacher had that not
been the case.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach always wanted to be a king’s teacher like
Jian Bu Gu. He wanted to raise the king to become a great king. He
had achieved so much for the kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus far, Thousand Mile Reach had been stuck teaching Qin Bai.
He had not achieved much out of his efforts. As for potential
awards, he had earned even less.</p>
<p>Back in the day, Jian Bu Gu had taught King Jing Zhen. Compared
to Wu Wei Dao Palace, one could say he had the name of a teacher
but did not achieve much.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach always held Jian Bu Gu as somewhat of a role
model. No matter what, he wanted to teach Qin Bai to become a good
person. He wanted him to develop into a good king who was at least
as good as King Jing Zhen.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach looked at Han Sen and asked, “Are you Han
Sen?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Han Sen sat where he was. He did not stand up.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach frowned. He was very noble. Even the king
referred to him as a mister. Now, Han Sen remained where he was
while speaking to him. He thought the man was very rude.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach looked at the game of chess on the table. He
sat opposite Han Sen and coldly asked, “Do you mind having a game
with me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach and asked, “Do you know
how to play checkers?”</p>
<p>The Qin Kingdom did not have games like checkers. This was
actually a chessboard. Han Sen had used his strength on the stone
table. He had squeezed a stone and turned it into an orb to make
the chess pieces. He had convinced Qin Bai to play.</p>
<p>While he was in the Alliance at home, Han Sen always played the
game with his Little Ling’er or Bao’er. Han Sen was very good when
it came to formations, so he could play all kinds of chess
games.</p>
<p>Even in checkers, only Bao’er was able to rival him. Not many
people won against him.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach frowned. Han Sen did not even ask for his
name. He was being very rude, but Thousand Mile Reach was not in
the mood to address the subject. He coldly said, “It is very
simple. To the deepest parts, there are different routes to take. I
saw the crown prince and you playing chess. I know the rules.”</p>
<p>“If you are interested, then I would like to play with you.” Han
Sen ignored Qin Bai and coldly laughed. Qin Bai was in a rush. He
looked into Han Sen’s eyes. Thousand Mile Reach was good at chess.
He was so famous that even the king called him the King of
Chess.</p>
<p>If Han Sen played chess against his teacher, Qin Bai was not
worried he might lose. If he did lose, he might have to agree to
something with Thousand Mile Reach.</p>
<p>The situation surprised Qin Bai. Thousand Mile Reach did not
establish any conditions. He only set up the chessboard and started
playing with Han Sen.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach thought he was very good at chess. His chess
skills were pretty good, but he did not plan on using chess skills
to convince Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Please, Mister,” Thousand Mile Reach coldly said.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not mind. He picked up a stone orb and made his
first move.</p>
<p>When it was Thousand Mile Reach’s turn, he used his finger to
pick up a stone orb. He slowly went to the chessboard.</p>
<p>Dong! When the stone orb was put down, it was like there was an
invisible power in the center of the orb. It suddenly spread and
twisted the space around it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was sitting in front of the stone board. He suddenly
felt the dimension become distorted. For some reason, he found
himself standing atop a chessboard.</p>
<p>The chessboard was the one he had created on the table. Now, it
was massive. The stone orb was bigger than a person. He was
standing where the stone orb was.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the chessboard, Thousand Mile Reach was
where he had put the stone orb down. Aside from the chessboard and
the two of them, the environment around was shrouded by a black
mist. It was like the chessboard world resided in an abyss.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move. He looked at Thousand Mile Reach as he
said, “That was a good move, Mister.”</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach was like a god floating above the
chessboard. He was looking down on Han Sen from up high and said,
“The chess path is a sky path. Playing chess is a gamble in life. I
have a Disaster class chess God Spirit Blood-Pulse. I have an
ultimate chess element gene race. If you can survive the world
power of this chess match, I can permit the crown prince to stay
with you.”</p>
<p>While he spoke, Thousand Mile Reach pointed at Han Sen. A giant
chess piece arose from his back. It was like an asteroid headed for
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body exploded with purple dragon air. At the same
time, there was a weird purple scale on his body. It was growing.
It activated the blood dragon God Spirit Blood – Pulse and blood
god dragon power.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen unleashed a punch that carried blood dragon flying into
the weird scene. The roaring big, purple dragon struck the stone
orb. A purple air explosion occurred. Dust was everywhere. Under
the effect of powerful tremors, Han Sen lost control and stumbled
back. His arms were numb. He had been truly shaken.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach coldly said, “Destroyed class God Spirit
Blood-Pulse combined with a rare exclusive god-class gene race… It
is only a shame that it is juvenile. If it reaches ultimate mode,
perhaps it would have lasted longer.” Han Sen thought, “Does a
teacher have this much power? This universe of kingdoms has a lot
of hidden elites. That was just a Disaster class God Spirit
Blood-Pulse combined with a god-class gene race? If there was an
Annihilation class or Reboot class God Spirit combining with an
ultimate mode gene race, how strong would it be? Does the Qin
Kingdom have such people in its midst?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach ahead of him. He was a bit
hesitant. He only depended on his gene race and God Spirit
Blood-Pulse power. His power was far inferior to Thousand Mile
Reach.</p>
<p>If he was forced to break the rules of the world to beat him, it
would shock many scary elites in Jade Wall City. Even the God
Spirits would come.</p>
<p>Although many God Spirits had revealed their fear of him, God
Spirits’ attitudes were still mysterious. They never explained why
they behaved the way they did. Han Sen did not believe the reasons
were anything simple. If he shocked a high-class God Spirit, it
probably would have ended up being a bad thing for him.</p>
<p>Plus, breaking the rules of the world always cost him too much
strength. He could never really last long in such a battle. He
might not have been able to fight against the attacks of all the
elites in the Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>“If I cannot win by force, I must rely on my intelligence.” Han
Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach. He looked serious.</p>
<p>“You still won’t concede.” When Thousand Mile Reach said that
with his godly voice, he raised his hands. Every stone orb chess
piece arose from the stone board. They looked like giant bombs
hovering in the air. They used all kinds of strange flighting paths
to strike Han Sen.</p>
