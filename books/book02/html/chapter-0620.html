    <p>
      In the Whitesand Shelter&#8217;s market, Huangfu Pingqing walked alongside
      Han Sen, often turning to observe him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know I am handsome. If you like my appearance that much, why
      don&#8217;t we book a room together, so you can inspect me in all my
      splendor?&#8221; Han Sen asked her. He felt awkward, getting stared at by
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing merely fluttered her eyelashes and said, &#8220;Sure. Do
      you want to go right now?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not say anything, but his eyes were suggesting enough. They
      couldn&#8217;t keep away from Huangfu Pingqing&#8217;s inflated chest.
      Similar to Queen, her breasts were the best of the best.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing blushed and asked, &#8220;What are you looking at these
      for? Aren&#8217;t you afraid Ji Yanran might suddenly appear and cut your
      penis off? Feel free to book a room if you&#8217;ve got the balls to do
      it, though.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is that supposed to mean?&#8221; Han Sen knew Huangfu Pingqing
      was willing to say anything that came to mind, but if he actually stepped
      up to book a room, she&#8217;d chicken out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You really can&#8217;t tell? I&#8217;m serious. You can go book us
      that room right now. I must say, though; I can&#8217;t believe someone
      like Queen was willing to say she&#8217;d follow you. Be honest with me;
      what mind-trick have you used to put her under your spell?&#8221; Huangfu
      Pingqing giggled and looked at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You know that&#8217;s not what she meant.&#8221; Han Sen opened his
      arms to express his disbelief.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I know that&#8217;s not what she meant, but it&#8217;s still
      strange for her to be willing to give up her team for you. What have you
      done?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing&#8217;s curiosity had reached the
      pitch-point. She couldn&#8217;t fathom what Han Sen might have done to
      make Queen feel this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have no idea. Maybe she thinks I&#8217;m incredibly handsome,
      too, and won&#8217;t be able to keep her eyes off me, hence her desire to
      follow,&#8221; Han Sen expressed, with off-putting cockiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whatever.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing rolled her eyes towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen laughed and turned to look at the beast soul shop they had just
      arrived at.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before climbing the mountain, he wanted to buy one type of beast soul bolt
      first. If he couldn&#8217;t get a sacred-blood class bolt, he&#8217;d at
      least want to grab a mutant class bolt. After all, bringing a Z-steel
      arrow with him wasn&#8217;t ideal, and a mutant class bolt was guaranteed
      to be far more efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
      But bolts, as he had previously seen, were still too unpopular. Han Sen
      and Huangfu Pingqing walked around the markets for some time without
      finding a single one. They did, however, see a wide variety of arrows.
    </p>

    <p>
      But arrows were too long for the peacock crossbow, and they wouldn&#8217;t
      load in. The peacock crossbow was medium-sized, which required short
      bolts.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Balls. How are you the one to sell this?&#8221; Han Sen at last
      found a mutant class bolt in a beast soul shop that wasn&#8217;t looking
      too popular.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a black bolt, formally referred to as an Ice Snake Bolt, and its
      tip was coated with a paralyzing substance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised to see that the bolt was 30% cheaper than any other
      mutant class beast soul. It really did seem like crossbows were unpopular,
      and few people were willing to buy their beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, crossbow beast souls were considerably rarer than the bolt
      beast souls themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen bought the Ice Snake Bolt and continued walking around the
      markets, but that proved fruitless. He couldn&#8217;t find a second beast
      soul bolt. Still, what he had was enough for the important time he&#8217;d
      need to use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because they were waiting for Tyrant and the rest of Queen&#8217;s group,
      Han Sen had to wait a few more days. Huangfu Pingqing wanted to visit Sky
      Pillar mountain, as well. Initially, Queen did not agree with the venture,
      but after Huangfu Pingqing spoke with her privately, Queen agreed to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing&#8217;s power wasn&#8217;t too bad. Her genes were almost
      maxed out, but she hadn&#8217;t managed to unlock her gene lock yet. If
      she didn&#8217;t have a run-in with a super creature, she should have no
      trouble keeping herself protected.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the powers gifted by the Ares Martial Hall, Huangfu Pingqing had
      managed to gather many sacred-blood beast souls, so ordinary sacred-blood
      beast souls could not harm her.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the fourth day, Tyrant, Sky Jealousy, and Lazy Cat arrived. Seeing Han
      Sen present, Tyrant sternly frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tyrant did not heed Han Sen&#8217;s presence and was wholly uncaring. He
      approached Queen with haste, asking, &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing gave him a spiteful glance, showing a clear distaste for
      what Tyrant had just asked. It was clear to see that Queen was okay and
      his question was unnecessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; Queen answered. She then looked at the three
      and said, &#8220;You all saw what Han Sen was capable of last time. I am
      hoping that he can join our team, and I&#8217;d like to hear your
      opinions.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Tyrant furrowed his eyebrows again and said, &#8220;Big Sis, has this not
      already been a subject of discussion?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen explained, &#8220;Last time, Shang Qing was still here. Now we are
      low on members. I think Han Sen would be a great fit, for he has been of
      tremendous service to me. Believe it or not, he has actually unlocked his
      gene lock and his qualities and traits would benefit us all.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he helped. If anything, he has a negative
      influence on the team.&#8221; Tyrant then proceeded to tell Queen of Han
      Sen leaving the group to go to her aid and continued to say,
      &#8220;Someone who does not follow the rules is a liability to the team.
      This is why I am vehemently against his membership on our team.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t persuade you&#8230;&#8221; Queen frowned.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I stand by my decision for the benefit of our team, no matter how
      cruel it may sound,&#8221; Tyrant said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, I see. If things are like that, then I quit.&#8221; Queen
      stated her resignation without a moment of hesitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tyrant, Sky Jealousy, and Lazy Cat were shaken. None of them expected her
      to quit the team on Han Sen&#8217;s behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Big Sis, we can talk about this. We can talk about this! There is
      no need to be like that!&#8221; Lazy Cat said, doing her best to fix the
      situation and ease tensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah, Bis Sis. Tyrant did not mean what he said! If you think Han
      Sen is the sort of person this team needs, then we can talk about
      it,&#8221; Sky Jealousy chimed in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tyrant&#8217;s face looked bleak. Still, he gritted his teeth to hiss,
      &#8220;Big Sis, we have been through much together over the years. Are you
      really going to throw it all away on the behalf of some outsider?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen calmly said, &#8220;I have not spoken recklessly. This is not a
      knee-jerk response. I am not mad at any of you, either. Have you each
      forgotten why we formed this team in the first place?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It was to slay super creatures,&#8221; Tyrant said.</p>

    <p>
      Queen nodded and then said, &#8220;This is indeed a team to slay super
      creatures. But over the years, we have not managed to kill a single
      one.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Tyrant looked ill, and so he pleaded, &#8220;But we have been doing better
      and better in recent times. The opportunity will soon arise.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Even when Shang Qing was still here, we could not kill a super
      creature. With the others gone, and our team being considerably weakened,
      do you still think we have a chance?&#8221; Queen said it straight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You seem to suggest that we don&#8217;t. Are you telling me we
      would stand a chance with this person&#8217;s inclusion?&#8221; Tyrant bit
      his teeth and asked painfully.
    </p>

    <p>Queen nodded and said, &#8220;Yes, I do believe so.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      After that, not only could Tyrant say nothing further, but even Sky
      Jealousy and Lazy Cat were too shocked to say anything. They had never
      seen Queen respect someone as much as she did Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone looked upon Han Sen, unable to determine which aspect of him made
      him so desirable and beneficial to the team. They did their best to figure
      out what was so special about him, that Queen was willing to quit the
      group for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I only have one aim and duty: to kill a super creature. And I will
      do anything to achieve that goal. If Han Sen cannot join the team, then
      there is no reason for me to stay with this team anymore.&#8221; Queen
      explained it all calmly, but her certainty and absolute manner of speech
      made the others speechless.
