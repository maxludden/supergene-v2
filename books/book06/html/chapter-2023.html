<h3>Chapter 2023</h3>

<p>Han Sen could not tell which race this statue depicted. Its head
was a sheep’s, and its body was human-like. It also had wings. It
looked like some prehistoric sheep god.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there weren’t any of such sheep around. Otherwise,
he was going to call them grandfather.</p>
<p>“Why does this place have a statue? Do xenogeneics build
statues?” Han Sen asked with confusion.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane had told Han Sen some things about the
Ancient God space, but the young Sky hadn’t actually been here. He
couldn’t have known what the xenogeneics were truly like.</p>
<p>Hai’er said, “It is not a statue. It is a home for Ancient God
xenogeneics.”</p>
<p>“A home?” Han Sen was surprised, and so he looked at the statue
again.</p>
<p>Yes. Otherwise, why would they be called an Ancient God
xenogeneic? It is because these xenogeneics live in ancient
statues. You came here and didn’t know anything about this? Knife
Queen didn’t inform you?” Hai’er asked, looking confused.</p>
<p>Han Sen dropped his shoulders. He didn’t know why the leader of
Sky Palace would do this, either. Sending him here without giving
him an ounce of information was weird. He couldn’t discern what the
man wanted.</p>
<p>Hai’er wanted to say something more, but a ding-dong noise
sounded through the giant cave. She quickly shut up and went to
hide in a crevice.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked towards the sound. The echo was reverberating
around the room, but Han Sen’s power could still tell him where it
was coming from. It was coming from the nostrils of the statue.</p>
<p>Not long after, a three-meter-wide spider slid out of the
nostril.</p>
<p>The spider was black with a few red patterns flaring across it.
Its body looked metallic, and the pattern on its back looked like a
humanoid face.</p>
<p>“This is Ancient God’s Ghost Face Spider. It is an Earl
xenogeneic. Do not strike yet, as they always work in groups. There
must be far more of them inside the statue. A Marquise one might
even reside within. We should discuss our plan of action before we
end up getting ourselves surrounded,” Hai’er said.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Ghost Face Spider with a thoughtful
expression. He had fought these spiders in the dream he was put
under. In fact, he had fought quite a lot of them. He knew a lot
about the spider and the power it possessed.</p>
<p>“The dream had to be training for this. Why didn’t he just tell
me? Why did he try to scare me like that?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>But Han Sen knew that if the Sky Palace leader had given him
files on all the xenogeneics, he’d only have given it a brief look.
He wouldn’t have researched the foes properly.</p>
<p>The dream, however, made Han Sen remember the creatures clearly.
He knew everything about them, to a degree that would never lessen.
The effectiveness of the two teaching methods was not even remotely
comparable.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned Spell as a gun in his hands. Then, he climbed
into a gap and raised the gun. He took aim at the Ghost Spider
emerging from the nostril.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? You are not going to shoot the Ghost Face
Spider from that distance, are you? The Ghost Face Spider is very
strong for an Earl!” Hai’er gasped.</p>
<p>Hai’er knew that Han Sen would have no problem killing a Ghost
Face Spider, but the range between them and the creature was over
three kilometers. The Earl power would be weakened over a long
distance, and the rest of the power wouldn’t be enough to kill a
Ghost Face Spider.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>A gunshot rang out, and a bullet tore through the distance. It
hit the spider’s back. The part of the face pattern that comprised
its left eye was its weakspot. Han Sen had killed too many of them
in the dream he suffered, so he knew them all too well.</p>
<p>Blood began to ooze from the gunshot wound in the creature’s
back. Then, it flipped and fell. It met the ground with a loud
noise.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Earl killed. Ghost Face Spider: xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>The announcement sounded in Han Sen’s head.</p>
<p>Hai’er was in shock. Han Sen’s power was far stronger than the
average Earl to one-hit-kill the spider over such a long
distance.</p>
<p>After that shot, though, many more spiders began to emerge from
the statue’s nostrils and ears. There was a great host of them.</p>
<p>But their vision and senses were rather limited, so they
couldn’t figure out where Han Sen was.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Another gunshot rang out, and a bullet broke through another
spider’s back. He still took aim at the left eye’s location.</p>
<p>A hail of gunfire followed, as each spider was shot off of the
statue. The spiders weren’t very intelligent, and they only seemed
to rely on basic instinct. They couldn’t find Han Sen, at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen killed the spiders one at a time, taking down dozens in
the space of a few seconds. Hai’er looked at Han Sen with shock, as
her mind drifted out to space.</p>
<p>Hai’er felt a chill in her heart. That gun-looking geno armament
of his had amazing range. She’d never know if Han Sen decided to
use it to assassinate her. She was confident she could evade the
attack if she was prepared. But she couldn’t be on alert every hour
of the day and night. Han Sen’s power really was that scary.</p>
<p>And he was only an Earl. If he became a King or a deified being,
he could probably kill a person by firing through the crust or core
of a planet. The enemy would never even know how they died.</p>
<p>Ghost Face Spiders kept climbing all around, and they kept
firing out spider webs. They had no idea where Han Sen was, and
they blindly fired their silk everywhere. It was obviously not
effective on Han Sen. And the spiders continued to get picked off,
as if they were mere target practice for him.</p>
<p>After killing a hundred of the Earl Ghost Face Spiders, Han Sen
finally heard the announcement to inform him that he had acquired a
beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen killed a few more, and then a weird scream sounded. It
came from the mouth of the statue. A spider that was twice as big
emerged.</p>
<p>“That is the Marquise Ghost Face Spider!” Hai’er screamed.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say a word. He stopped firing. He waited until
the giant Ghost Face Spider revealed its back to them. And when it
did, he pulled the trigger. Pang!</p>
<p>A bullet struck the Ghost Face Spider’s back, and it broke the
pattern’s left eye. The Marquise class Ghost Face Spider fell
down.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked at Han Sen in disbelief. He had one-hit killed a
Marquise class Ghost Face Spider. She did not know what Han Sen’s
strength was anymore.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been that long, so how has he gotten this strong?”
Hai’er thought back to meeting Han Sen in the heaven. He was a
different person, and he was so much stronger now.</p>
<p>Hai’er thought she had leveled up quickly, but it was clear to
her that Han Sen had been much faster.</p>
