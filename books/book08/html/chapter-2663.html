<p>“How would that work, exactly?” Han Sen looked at Exquisite in
shock.</p>
<p>“What’s strange about it? Since you’re already being watched by
one person, being watched by another is practically the same. You
just need to share your experiences with one more person. It won’t
be detrimental to you in any way, and you can double the benefits
you receive. You will receive the same amount of resources from me
and my little sister. Effectively, you’ll be receiving double what
others receive. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” Exquisite said to Han
Sen with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re correct, but I still think there might be a
problem with this plan,” Han Sen quietly said.</p>
<p>“What could go wrong? Aren’t you happy about being able to
receive twice the resources?” Exquisite thought about it a bit, and
then said, “If you become Li Keer’s silkworm, you can even receive
more star fruit.”</p>
<p>“But the elder is no longer here. I thought the star tree would
stop giving out fruit,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“I’m just giving you an example. There are many more resources
like the star tree on the path ahead, and you will be receiving a
double portion,” Exquisite said. Then, she clapped a hand on Han
Sen’s shoulder and teleported away. They went straight to the altar
where Han Sen had signed his contract with Exquisite.</p>
<p>Han Sen signed another contract to become Li Keer’s
silkworm.</p>
<p>Because Exquisite was there, though, Han Sen kept his mind
carefully blank. He waited until he was alone, out of Exquisite and
Li Keer’s range of connection, before thinking things over some
more. He was in a bad situation.</p>
<p>“I wonder if the small jade figure can absorb two marks. If it
can’t, I’m going to be exposed.” Han Sen quickly brought out the
small jade figure as he mulled over his situation. He moved to
transfer Li Keer’s branding onto the small jade figure.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen’s biggest worries didn’t come to fruition.
The mark was successfully applied to the small jade figure.</p>
<p>“Since the jade figure managed to absorb the additional mark,
this situation is a good thing, I suppose. It makes little
difference if I’m watched by one person or two. And if it means I
can earn double the resources, where is the harm in that? I guess
this is a lucky turn of events?” Han Sen still couldn’t convince
himself that this was a good thing, though. He felt as if there was
something dangerous about the situation, but he couldn’t quite put
his finger on what it was exactly.</p>
<p>“Exquisite has been talking a lot about these rewards that I’ll
be earning. I wonder what they are? I hope I can get my hands on
some deified xenogeneic genes,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Exquisite and Li Keer were standing in a hall,
signing Han Sen up for the silkworm bouts. That was the rewards
Exquisite had been talking about.</p>
<p>The silkworm fights provided many resources to the victor, but
the silkworm had to earn them. The higher rank they were, the more
resources they would receive.</p>
<p>There were 13 Very High students and 12 silkworms. If someone
ended up outside the top 10, their rewards would be practically
nothing.</p>
<p>Ranks five to ten weren’t much better. Their rewards were fairly
small, but things got much better for those in the top five. Going
up sequentially, each rank gave double what the last received.</p>
<p>The prizes had been structured in that way to inspire the
silkworms to work their hardest in battle. The Very High wanted
them to bring out everything they had.</p>
<p>It was important for the young Very High to feel the life and
death fights of their silkworms. They needed to feel every ounce of
emotion such battles could draw out. And they could do it all from
the comfort of their seats. They could experience the dire straits
of mortal combat without ever putting themselves in danger. Only
the Very High had a system that allowed their students to do such a
thing.</p>
<p>The Very High were surprised to find out that Exquisite and Li
Keer were sharing the same silkworm. It had happened before in the
history of the Very High, but it was a very rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The Very High that practiced the Very High Sense didn’t comment
on the arrangement, but the Very High like Liyu Zhen were less
reserved with their opinions.</p>
<p>“Li Keer and Exquisite are using the same silkworm. That Han Sen
is quite lucky. He has benefitted from our people yet again,” Liyu
Zhen said coldly.</p>
<p>Li Xue Cheng laughed and said, “Being the silkworm of two Very
High masters won’t be good for him, all things considered. Although
he can earn double the resources, his responsibilities will also be
doubled.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Li Xue Cheng went on to say, “Plus, once he
causes many of the Very High to lose their wagers in the silkworm
fights, it will be very difficult for him to gain resources
anyway.”</p>
<p>“You collected the bets?” Liyu Zhen laughed.</p>
<p>“I collected them all before it was announced that silkworms
wouldn’t be able to use treasures in the battle. I won’t let the
gamblers bail now.” Li Xue Cheng’s eyes sparkled. “Han Sen just
needs to not get first place in the silkworm fights. Then, we will
be rich. The resources we gain will be enough to make us deified.
They will take us to larva class, at least. And some of the
treasures are so rare that we couldn’t have bought them with all
the resources in the world. But if we lose, there is no way we can
pay it all back.”</p>
<p>“How could we lose?” Liyu Zhen said with a laugh. “Every single
silkworm is at least half-deified. They are half a level higher
than Han Sen. And if push comes to shove, the born-deified will be
mopping the floor with him. No matter how strong Han Sen is, he
will never get any further than number two.”</p>
<p>“You are right. No matter how strong a ninth-tier King is, they
cannot beat a deified. Plus, that born-deified is very talented. He
isn’t much weaker than the Very High students themselves. He is
very good when compared to our members at the same level. Beating a
mere King will be a trivial task for him,” Li Xue Cheng said with
assurance. He was confident he was going to win this bet.When
Exquisite and Li Keer finally explained the “rewards” that they’d
been promising, Han Sen shook his head. “This is the ‘good stuff’
you’ve been talking about? I will have to fight for my life in
there. And I can only join as a single person. Why would there be
double benefits for me?”</p>
<p>“You will have both of us to support you. Isn’t that twice the
benefits?” Exquisite said flatly.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Li Keer looked at Exquisite, gobsmacked. Han Sen
didn’t know if Exquisite was just fooling around, but Li Keer was
especially surprised by seeing how Exquisite was behaving. It was
hard to believe this was the same Exquisite she had grown up
with.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like that? If you have the time, read
the files I’ve sent you about your opponents. And remember, the
higher the rank you achieve, the more resources you receive. If you
can reach second place, you will get a deified treasure amongst
many other resources,” Exquisite said calmly.</p>
<p>“What about becoming number one?” Han Sen kept looking at the
information he was giving while he asked.</p>
<p>“There is a born-deified participating in this fight. He will
probably secure first place. You just need to try your best to be
second,” Exquisite said with a small shrug.</p>
<p>“A born deified is joining? And I can’t use treasures? I suppose
I will have to settle for second, then,” Han Sen said with a nod.
If he couldn’t use his peacock king soul robe and the Six Core
Snake Bow, he didn’t think he could beat a deified elite. Not even
a primitive one, which was the lowest tier of deified.</p>
