      After Han Sen’s discussion with Sieg, he noticed something was wrong when
      he next tried to use his communicator to connect to Skynet. It came as an
      extreme shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they only a single day had passed inside the Main Control Room,
      outside in the Alliance, ten years had gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s no wonder Sieg doesn’t recognize us.” Han Sen thought this fact was
      unbelievable. The crystallizer technology was also able to distort time.
      It was quite a frightening realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took a look at The Story of Genes. He had initially found it
      difficult to believe it was a proper book you could learn to practice
      with. Now that he understood that the crystallizers were capable of
      playing with time, the possibilities the book suggested seemed a lot more
      convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen planned to go home and practice with the techniques, and although
      his abilities were low for the book’s requirements, it wouldn’t do any
      harm to at least try out its teachings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen rode Sieg’s ship to Mirror Planet. Han Sen was able to catch up on
      the news via Skynet, and learn what he had missed over the past ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many things had occurred. The Angel Gene Fluid had come a long way, as had
      many other types of medicines and formulas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many humans had become demigods over those ten years, as well. But in the
      Fourth God’s Sanctuary, humans were still very weak overall. Compared to
      spirits and creatures, humans were still nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the most important thing was that the shura had invented a geno fluid
      of sorts. With it, they could enter the sanctuary and not suffer damage
      for a period of time. They could move there freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      They weren’t yet able to absorb geno points yet, though. And neither could
      they use beast souls or geno cores. Not every shura would enter via the
      First God’s Sanctuary, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the shura fighter’s rankings, first rank fighters would end
      up entering the First God’s Sanctuary. Their ranking number correlated
      with the sanctuary they would enter, one by one. Still, with all that
      being said, the shura weren’t gaining many advantages or boons from
      entering the sanctuaries just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a development that affected humans, nonetheless, and fights had
      broken out between the shura and humans inside the sanctuaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sieg went away, Han Sen and Ji Yanran called their respective
      parents. When Luolan and Ji Ruozhen saw Han Sen and Ji Yanran, they
      started to cry. Even Ji Ruozhen’s eyes turned red, despite the fact that
      he rarely displayed emotion. He was exuberant to see that they had come
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen was no longer the president. A few years prior, Angel Gene and
      Starry Group supported Wang Zhixuan to become president.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew who Wang Zhixuan was; he was Wang Mengmeng’s father and Wang
      Yuhang’s big brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen told Han Sen not to contact anyone else just yet or let the
      world know they weren’t dead. They should wait until they had returned
      home first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen allowed them to stay with Sieg until they reached Mirror
      Planet. When they reached there, he would arrange passage for them to come
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, Sieg. You have our phone number now, and if there’s anything you
      need, feel free to give us a call.” When they reached Mirror Planet, they
      said their goodbyes and parted ways. They wished to pay Sieg a sum, but he
      kindly declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw an airship already waiting for them on the surface of Mirror
      Planet. It took Han Sen and his family all the way back to Planet Roca. Ji
      Ruozhen and Luolan were already there, waiting for them at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen and Ji Yanran saw their parents, they didn’t feel anything.
      After all, for them, they had only been gone a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ji Ruozhen, his wife, and Luolan felt a lot different. They came
      forward to greet them with much excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran were still affected by their emotions, though, and
      they opened their arms for hugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My baby, you are back! Grandma missed you. Why have you not yet grown?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Littleflower, why have you refused to grow? Will you start growing
      sometime in the future?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran felt awkward, as most of their affection seemed
      directed towards Littleflower. They didn’t care much for Han Sen and Ji
      Yanran, and they ended up standing where they were with their arms frozen
      in mid-air having expected hugs of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once they were home, Han Sen and Ji Yanran explained everything to Ji
      Ruozhen. When their story was complete, the man frowned.
    </p>
    <p>“Dad, do you know about the New Community?” Han Sen asked Ji Ruozhen.</p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen nodded and then shook his head. “Yes, I have heard about the
      New Community. They have only been active in the past few years. When
      incidents transpire, particularly those that involve humans and shura
      together, you can catch a glimpse of them. No one in the Ji family has yet
      been able to discover who the leader of the New Community is, though. We
      can’t even determine whether or not the leader is a shura or a human.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With the power they possess, they cannot lack strong backing,” Han Sen
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ordinarily, organizations such as this cannot be so secretive, but the
      New Community is strange. Their ranks are composed of humans and shura.
      What’s more, some big families work for them. But not even they, through
      doing that, are able to uncover who the leader of the New Community is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen paused briefly, before going on to say, “You guys should lay
      low and let me investigate matters first.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After talking business, Han Sen asked Luolan, “Mom, where is Little Yan?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Lan smiled. “Don’t worry, she has become a demigod and established a
      way to return to the Alliance. She is currently practicing back in the
      sanctuary, as we speak. We can’t contact her right now, but when she gets
      back, we’ll let her know. She’ll be delighted to see you’ve returned.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That day had passed far too quickly, and he had learned even Little Yan
      had become a demigod. Ultimately, Han Sen let out a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next two days, he rested at home. When boredom finally hit, he
      decided to return to the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, Mask Shelter and Ling Mei’er were still doing fine. Moment Queen
      had helped bring Ling Mei’er’s geno core up to gemstone class in the time
      he had been gone. She was now allowed to visit Dark Spirit Shelter, and
      she had been there on a number of occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moment Queen had also obtained a gemstone geno core. But, she had very bad
      news to relay to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman approached Shadow Shelter many years ago, saying she was looking
      for him. But due to his absence, she claimed the shelter for herself. Now,
      the shelter belonged to that woman and still, to that day, she was waiting
      for Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>“Did she give you a name?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “No. But she was a human; beautiful and strong,” Moment Queen said after a
      moment of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gu Qingcheng? If that is her, she is coming after Elysian Moon. I wonder
      if Elysian Moon is still alive?” Han Sen then summoned the Elysian
      Umbrella. It was still under the control of Real Blood, and as a result,
      it was still colored red. The image of the green-clothed woman was atop
      it. She had yet to be refined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen planned to go to Shadow Shelter. After all, the silver fox and the
      others were still there. If he didn’t go, there was the possibility they’d
      be held hostage.
