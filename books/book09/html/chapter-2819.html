<p>Beads of sweat cascaded down from Second Uncle&#8217;s brow. He had a complicated expression as he wiped them away.</p>

<p>Han Sen exploded with a power that was greater than his own. It was perhaps even better than Cold Light Charm. For such power to be controlled by a small body like that was concerning. Second Uncle feared Han Sen&#8217;s body might not be able to keep going. He worried his body might blow up at any moment.</p>

<p>Second Uncle was someone who had a lot of knowledge. He had seen many genius elites in his time but never a small body like that blow up with so much potential. He had never seen another put on a show like this before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he become exhausted and died yet? Does his body really contain the genes of a true god creature?&#8221; Evil Lotus God&#8217;s eyes were starting to flare with shock.</p>

<p>Aside from the child of a true god creature, ordinary creatures were not able to display power this scary.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Cold Light Charm&#8217;s transparent metal body was blown up by Han Sen. With one final punch, its entire body was blown into fleshy chunks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Xenogeneic Deified Hunted. Cold Light Charm: Deified Xenogeneic Gene Found. Obtained Cold Light Charm Beast Soul.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the same time, the announcement played in Han Sen&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is dead! Long live Mister Holy Baby!&#8221; Londo screamed with excitement. No one wanted to die. Han Sen had managed to blow up the Cold Light Charm and save their lives. That is why they were so happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad. That really wasn&#8217;t bad. To be able to do something like that, you are impressive for the lowlife creature that you are.&#8221; Evil Lotus was not angry. He clapped and smiled at Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evil Lotus, you can leave now. I will spare your life.&#8221; Han Sen looked at Evil Lotus seriously as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spare my life?&#8221; Evil Lotus God looked at him like an idiot.</p>

<p>Upon hearing Han Sen say that, Second Uncle, Meng Lie, Bao Ying, and the others felt weird. Although they had pottery powder to restrict the Evil Lotus God, making a god mad was never a wise thing to do.</p>

<p>Evil Lotus God was not enraged. In fact, he did not even get the slightest bit mad. No one cared for the crazy words of a fool, so he was not going to be mad at a crazy guy.</p>

<p>Evil Lotus God looked at Han Sen as if he was in a high place and said, &#8220;If you can survive against the xenogeneic siege that is yet to come, I will kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The way he said his words were like it was Han Sen&#8217;s honor to die by his hands.</p>

<p>Before Han Sen said anything in return, Ger was already screaming and shouting, &#8220;Xenogeneics! It&#8217;s all xenogeneics! They are all Cold Light Charms!&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen and the others looked back. In the distant sky, many pink things, which looked like gems in the ocean, were coming for them. All of them were Cold Light Charms.</p>

<p>Although they were not as scary as the terrifying first Cold Light Charm, they were still deified class. Some of them were almost as powerful as the first Cold Light Charm.</p>

<p>Everyone&#8217;s face suddenly turned white. Although they knew the big barren systems were scary, they did not think it would be that scary. Within thousands of miles, there were many scary xenogeneics.</p>

<p>It had been hard for them to kill one Cold Light Charm, and this group of Cold Light Charm presented them with 30 to 40 Cold Light Charms. Some of them even had a power that was closer to the first one. Being surrounded by that many Cold Light Charms, one could use one&#8217;s ass to figure out what might happen next.</p>

<p>Han Sen had been exhausted once. He was not about to exhaust his potential again. Even if he exhausted his potential again, he could not take on 10 enemies alone.</p>

<p>Londo grabbed his big ax and shouted, &#8220;Fuck! Killing one was enough. Killing two more is extra. We will fight until we die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing the group of Cold Light Charms already arriving, everyone knew they were not going to survive. They were all prepared to die.</p>

<p>&#8220;Second Uncle, help me control those Cold Light Charms,&#8221; Han Sen said. He then waved his right hand. A pink, half-transparent sword appeared in his hand.</p>

<p>The sword looked like crystal. It was like a gem, but it was cold like metal. It was only the width of a finger, and it was pink like a crystal. The sword looked evil.</p>

<p>The handle of the sword had a pink, eye-like gem. It was like it was looking at people. It gave people goosebumps when they saw it.</p>

<p>[Deified beast soul Cold Light Charm: Cold Light Sword (half-complete)]</p>

<p>This was different from the destroyed beast souls Han Sen had received before. This Cold Light Sword beast soul was half-complete. Han Sen had no idea what that meant, but he sensed how scary the Cold Light Sword&#8217;s power was just by holding it.</p>

<p>Second Uncle had not time to react. Han Sen had already turned into a light and was going into the Cold Light Charm group. He was shocked. He subconsciously opened his time area and covered a large portion of the land.</p>

<p>Now, it was the universe&#8217;s era with a lot of technology. Many elites used swords, and there were many swordsmen in the Extreme King.</p>

<p>Second Uncle and the others had never seen Han Sen&#8217;s sword skill, nor the heard about them either.</p>

<p>Perhaps they did not notice which sword skills Han Sen used because the weird red sword light that went across had already enraptured their minds and eyesight.</p>

<p>The straight, pink, sword light went across space. It cut a Cold Light Charm in half. Before anyone was able to react, Han Sen had already rushed into the group of Cold Light Charms.</p>

<p>They saw the sword light go everywhere. It was like a deathly cutting laser that was going across hell. Wherever it went, broken tentacles flew everywhere. The Cold Light Charms were being slaughtered by Han Sen as easy as if he was slicing vegetables.</p>

<p>Upon seeing all this, Londo and the others were frozen as he said, &#8220;Holy crap! Mister Holy Baby is that strong? Was he toying with us before?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one answered him because they were all in complete shock. It would have been fine if the Cold Light Charms were that easy to kill, but the Cold Light Charms there were as scary as the one earlier. Yet, Han Sen was casually able to slice and dice their limbs away. That group of Cold Light Charms was unable to do anything to stop him.</p>

<p>Although Second Uncle&#8217;s time area helped how Han Sen go through the Cold Light Charms carelessly, it was still too shocking.</p>

<p>Seeing all those powerful Cold Light Charms be slain by Han Sen, god blood was bleeding like mad from the sky. The sword lights that shocked the sky had become so outstanding in the chaos of the pink beams of light.</p>

<p>Evil Lotus God was in utter shock as he watched Han Sen butcher the Cold Light Charms. He looked confused. He was a god, but he had never seen a xenogeneic perform like Han Sen. He was not able to tell how strong he actually was either.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is wrong with that xenogeneic? What level is this xenogeneic?&#8221; Evil Lotus God looked Han Sen up and down. His eyes were gleaming with god lights. No matter how he looked at him, what Han Sen was showing put him at transmutation class at the very most. He was not larva class as he had expected.</p>
