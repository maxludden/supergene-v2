  The godlights that came from the wolf’s eyes shot toward Gru like four bolts of lightning. Gru remained stalwart, though. He had already prepared his defense, and when the four-eyed wolf unleashed the attack, Gru lifted his mirror shield.

The green godlights slammed straight into the mirror shield, but they were reflected away. The attack was unable to damage the shield, and as he watched, Han Sen felt a little bit jealous.

Before the four-eyed wolf could gather its power to attack again, Han Sen made his move. He immediately activated the ice geno art that he had recently received. Snowflakes crusted over his body, and he unleashed snow substance chains that headed straight for the four-eyed wolf.

The four-eyed wolf had just used its eye skills, so it didn’t have much of a chance of avoiding the snowy substance chains. A new light flashed across its body as it tried to block the attack. The snowy air didn’t seem to be affected, though. Han Sen’s icy power wrapped around the four-eyed wolf. If seen from afar, it would have looked like a half-transparent snow lady covering up the giant wolf.

The snow power didn’t immediately freeze the four-eyed wolf. The green light still shone around the wolf’s body, and its substance chains fought against the snow power.

“Is that all the strength that this ice geno art can unleash?” Han Sen was disappointed. This was similar to what he could do when he had his Apollo Set. The attack was nothing special, and the ice power wasn’t very strong. It fell far short of his expectations, that was for sure.

He had only attacked once, and the ice geno core’s power was already exhausted. He would have to wait a long time before he could even use it again, anyway. It wasn’t as good as the Apollo Set, which was far more convenient. If this was all the ice geno core could accomplish, then there was no reason for him to continue practicing with the ice geno core. He could just keep on using his Apollo Set.

The snow air seemed to be growing a little more intense as time went on, but overall, the strike was unable to freeze the four-eyed wolf. Han Sen thought it was all over.

After all, the four-eyed wolf had easily held off the attack. When the wolf summoned more of its strength, it would obliterate the snow power.

But things developed in an unexpected way. The four-eyed wolf’s attempts to fight off the snow power did not increase. Instead, they weakened. And Han Sen’s icy power affected the creature more and more.

Han Sen was shocked. As he watched, the wolf’s four eyes seemed to flutter. It looked very sleepy. The creature was going to fall asleep any second.

“Does the ice power have a tranquilizing effect as well?” Han Sen was happy about this.

The four-eyed wolf could block the ice, but it couldn’t resist the lulling power. Its will began to fade. The green light became dimmer and dimmer. The creature couldn’t break the ice power that held it captive.

The ice power wasn’t a raging, destructive attack. It just lowered the target’s body temperature. The wolf grew chillier, bit by bit. Not long after, the four-eyed wolf succumbed entirely to the sedative. It closed its eyes, went to sleep, and froze like an ice statue.

Gru was staring at the wolf in undisguised shock. He turned and looked at Han Sen for a long while before saying in an odd tone, “This is a very powerful ice geno art. It has already generated substance chains, too. Has that geno art reached a deified level

Han Sen nodded. “I got lucky when I received it. I managed to get my hands on a deified geno core, and fortunately, I was able to refine it and receive this ice geno art.”

Gru was more interested. And he said, “So the power came from a deified geno core? Deified geno cores are so rare. Even the Extreme King count themselves incredibly lucky to lay claim to one, and even then, only deified elites can learn the deified geno arts that the cores offer. Your luck is too much.”

“This is nothing. With the powers of the Extreme King, I am sure Brother Gru will be able to get deified geno cores easily, right?” Han Sen responded coldly.

“I would have trouble getting a deified geno care. And even if I somehow got one, I wouldn’t be able to absorb it before becoming deified.” After saying that, Gru fell silent. Then, he walked to the four-eyed wolf.

Now that it was solidly encased in ice, the four-eyed wolf was soundly asleep. However, the freezing power hadn’t actually killed the creature. It still had a lifeforce.

“It looks like I will have to ask Brother Han to kill it,” Gru said.

Han Sen had no reason to refuse. If he used his Apollo Set, he should have a sufficient amount of power to strike down the four-eyed wolf. Plus, the creature could no longer move. It couldn’t even generate a power to block Han Sen’s attack.

The power of the Apollo Set was unleashed. Han Sen slashed toward the sleeping four-eyed wolf, cutting deeply into the side of the creature’s neck.

No blood leaked from the wound, however. The blood was all frozen. Despite being attacked and badly injured, the four-eyed wolf didn’t even wake up. Rather than howling in pain, it remained in a deep slumber.

It took Han Sen four slashes to cut the wolf’s head off. Then, the four-eyed wolf’s lifeforce disappeared.

> “Deified Xenogeneic Killed: Four-Eyed Wolf. Xenogeneic Gene Found.”

“This ice geno art is so powerful. It has both ice and sedative powers? It is very good.” Han Sen was happy with its performance. He was now thinking about refining the two fire geno cores he had received.

Gru complimented Han Sen’s good luck in obtaining a new, powerful deified geno art. But he also looked annoyed, and he said. “I wanted to see more of your knife skills, but it seems that I didn’t get the chance.”

“You can see the knife skills whenever. Killing the xenogeneic is what matters. According to our deal, I’m getting half of this four-eyed wolf’s xenogeneic gene, right?” Han Sen said.

“Of course,” Gru said with a nod.

Han Sen used his power to cut the four-eyed wolf in half. Each of them had half of the wolf’s body to take home with them.

Once their hunt was finished, Han Sen went back to where the Immortal Dragon was trapped. He found it still lying there, unmoving. It was very afraid of the knife silks. Han Sen’s silks seemed to have caused the creature a great deal of pain.

Han Sen removed the knife silks. After Gru said his goodbyes, Han Sen took the Immortal Dragon back to the Star Tree.While there was no one around, Han Sen brought out the black crystal and fed it to the Immortal Dragon.

The Immortal Dragon didn’t want to open its mouth, so Han Sen summoned more knife silks and cinched them tight around the creature. The knife silks dug painfully into the Immortal Dragon’s body, and the beast couldn’t help but scream. In doing so, it opened its mouth.

Han Sen tossed the black crystal into the dragon’s mouth. As soon as he saw the beast swallow, he released the knife silks.

“If this doesn’t work on a xenogeneic, I will have to use it on a creature from the sanctuaries.” Han Sen watched the beast lying flat on the ground. The creature seemed to have been utterly beaten down, body and soul.

After two days, Han Sen saw something surprising happen. The scales of the Immortal Dragon began to fall off. And then, new scales appeared across its flesh. These scales were made of crystal. And, more importantly, substance chains began to rise from the scales.

Although the substance chains weren’t complete yet, it was a very clear sign.

“The black crystal can really make the Immortal Dragon deified?” Han Sen was as shocked as he was happy.
