    <p>
      Han Sen and Zhou Yumei were shocked; a white rhino exited the lake. The
      water level dropped significantly as it emerged.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the white rhino we saw a while back?&#8221; Han
      Sen was taken aback.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white rhino, thankfully, did not seem too interested in their
      presence. After emerging from the waters of the lake, it approached the
      island at its center and gobbled up one of the black metal coconuts.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the rhino chewed it, a sweet fragrance tickled Han Sen&#8217;s nose.
      The entirety of the coconut forest was quickly overwhelmed by the smell.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox and Little Orange both gulped. The fairy could not help but
      fly over there in a rush, and within a second, her small body quickly
      managed to pierce and drill through the coconut into its interior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was alarmed, thinking she might end up provoking the white rhino
      and inciting its wrath.
    </p>

    <p>
      Surprisingly, the white rhino did not attack the fairy, and kept happily
      munching its own coconut.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing how passive the rhino appeared, the silver fox and Little Orange
      quickly jumped into the lake and swam to the island at its center. The
      silver fox leapt up towards the coconut the fairy was in and drank the
      milk that was dripping from the bore hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      Little Orange meowed from down below and tried to jump up and take a bite
      of the third coconut. It managed to reach, but it could not pierce the
      coconut&#8217;s shell or remove it from the tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised at the sight. He firmly acknowledged how different
      and special those coconuts really were; especially considering that not
      even juvenile second-generation super creatures could break them open with
      their teeth. It looked like only adults were able to open them up, like
      the fairy.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what happened next blew the socks off Han Sen and Zhou Yumei. The
      white rhino opened its mouth and bit the coconut Little Orange was
      struggling to get for itself. It did not eat the coconut, it merely
      cracked the shell open and placed it down on the ground for Little Orange
      to eat. With glee, Little Orange pounced upon the coconut and finished
      opening it up for itself, and with a ravenous tongue, began lapping up the
      milk inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had never seen something like this before; a creature with such a
      good temper.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white rhino proceeded to lie down beside them on the isle, watching
      the silver fox and Little Orange drink the coconut juice to their
      heart&#8217;s content. It didn&#8217;t seem to have a single nasty bone in
      its body, and it was so calm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched them all eat the coconuts and suddenly developed the
      desire to partake in the treat they were helping themselves to. With
      haste, he ran over to join them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s hope the white rhino isn&#8217;t racist.&#8221; Han Sen
      ran over to the island, all the while observing the white rhino for any
      change in temper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, as he stepped onto the island, the white rhino did not move.
      It continued to lie where it was, utterly serene. This delighted Han Sen,
      knowing that it did not seek to attack him or the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen immediately raced to Little Orange&#8217;s side and began drinking
      the coconut milk with it. Right then, he didn&#8217;t care about anything.
      He wanted some, and if he didn&#8217;t hurry, Little Orange was going to
      have it all to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      But taking a look at how much of the juice was left in the massive
      coconut, Han Sen was shocked to see Little Orange had consumed a third of
      it already. Not wasting any time, he threw his arms around the coconut to
      drink as much as he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Little Orange&#8217;s tongue was wagging quickly, and its feet were subtly
      trying to push Han Sen away. But Han Sen was not willing to budge one
      minor inch. He continued to grip the coconut firmly and carried on
      drinking as best he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhou Yumei remained where she was, however. She had never before seen
      someone so obscene, and so willing to fight against another animal for
      food.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Save me some! Save me some!&#8221; But when she resolved to get
      some for herself, and ran over to the island, she noticed there was no
      space left for her. She could only circle them and wait for an opening.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a great push, she knocked Han Sen away and a found a place for
      herself on the coconut. But it was too late. Poking her head inside, she
      noticed Han Sen and Little Orange had consumed every last drop of the
      juice, leaving nothing for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Falling down to the ground, Han Sen&#8217;s belly was frighteningly large.
      He couldn&#8217;t even straighten his back or stand up to drink some more,
      had there been any left.
    </p>

    <p>
      A cool energy began to whirl inside his stomach, and it blended with the
      rest of his body. His entire body felt so cool, it was like his cells had
      been injected with refreshing spring water. It was perfectly suitable for
      a hot day such as this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen cast Dongxuan Sutra and tried to refine the energy inside, and
      noticed that his fitness seemed to be a little improved.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white rhino was on the island, watching the entire scene unfold. After
      the silver fox and the fairy finished their coconut juice, however, it
      stood up and munched on the shell.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were both unafraid of the rhino, and the silver fox decided to climb
      aboard. It stood upon one of its horns and gazed all around.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy soon followed, and she landed on the tip of the horn. There, she
      curiously observed the rhino.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rhino did not look mad at all, and all it did was squint while looking
      at them. Its eyes were soft, as its mouth worked to chew up the coconut
      shell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen never imagined meeting another super creature, especially one so
      large, that could be so tame. It wasn&#8217;t just relaxed with the other
      super creatures near it, it was also unconcerned with Han Sen and Zhou
      Yumei&#8217;s presence as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That rhino is so cute!&#8221; Zhou Yumei said, despite being prone
      to calling everything cute. As she spoke, she tried to hug one of the
      rhino&#8217;s leg.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she was little more than an ant when compared to the size of the
      rhino. The legs were more like walls for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen eyed this rhino with curiosity, as it was the first time he had
      ever encountered another creature that was so docile and passive. He used
      his Dongxuan Sutra to take a look at the rhino&#8217;s energy flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lifeforce was frighteningly powerful, and it had the breadth of an
      ocean. The energy swirled with a slow passion, and it looked holy and
      pure.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this super creature? The lifeforce is too much to be
      considered one, surely.&#8221; Han Sen was surprised at what he was
      seeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the white rhino finished eating the coconut shell, it went back to
      resting on the island. Han Sen and his companions also rested near it, not
      showing any concern about the rhino&#8217;s presence. It was so friendly
      and calm, they didn&#8217;t think anything ill about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      That night, the rhino finally moved. It got up and began walking away from
      the island; it seemed to be leaving the oasis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly packed up his stuff, grabbed Zhou Yumei, and flew to the
      rhino&#8217;s back. The silver fox and Little Orange climbed aboard too,
      and they were soon all riding the rhino&#8217;s back, setting out into the
      Black Desert once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the serene, silver moonlight, the luminous dandelions returned as
      well. As if they were aboard a starfaring ship, it was like the rhino was
      traversing a galaxy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s so beautiful.&#8221; Zhou Yumei&#8217;s eyes sparkled
      like the stars themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dandelions were all around, floating in the air. When Han Sen&#8217;s
      skin came into contact with them, they melted into his skin like fallen
      snowflakes. It felt as if his skin was imbued with a sudden halo of
      purity, and he felt cleansed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox and Little Orange also came into contact with the
      dandelions, which made their fur shine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen observed the white rhino as it went, and noticed the lifeforce of
      the rhino was overflowing. It was this overflow of energy that manifested
      itself as the dandelions.
