	<p>“You guys took the item. Shouldn’t you be leaving now? Stop bothering the resting place of Undying Bird.” The old
		woman did not look happy. She waved her hand.</p>

	<p>“You take it,” Bai Wei said to Han Sen as she let go of the item.</p>

	<p>“How could I do this?” Han Sen looked very guilty, but on the inside, he was as happy as a flower on the verge of
		blooming. “This is something that is as good as a deified thing. I may not know what it does, but it has to be
		something good.”</p>

	<p>Bai Wei rolled her eyes. I am only asking you to hold onto it temporarily. Don’t think too deeply about it.</p>

	<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders. Without saying anything, he just moved to grab the Undying Bird Nest. The Undying
		Bird Nest was like a deified item, but without its approval, not even a deified elite could make use of it.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was surprised he had earned the will and approval of Undying Bird. Now that he had been approved to be
		able to make use of the Undying Bird Nest, it was useless for others. Even Bai Wei would not be able to take it.
	</p>

	<p>“You can’t put the blame on me for stealing it. You are the one that did not finish the Way of Life and Death,”
		Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

	<p>The old woman did not seem very happy about the fact they had taken the Undying Bird Nest, and now she wished
		them gone.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was holding the bird nest, and as he was, he left Extreme Dead. He went back the way he came, and as he
		did, he soon came before the coast.</p>

	<p>There were many lava bugs spread out across the lava sea. They were like little burning lava fairies. Their heat
		was hotter than the lava, and they were only resting. If they unleashed their heat all together, even a Duke’s
		armor would be melted.</p>

	<p>Han Sen tried to fly, but he realized he was still unable to. They would have to tread across the lava sea.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei suddenly smiled at Han Sen, which sure gave him a surprise. Seeing a cocky person give someone a smile
		elicited a different feeling to the witness of an average smile.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei pulled out a leaf. She put godlight into it and then threw the leaf into the lava sea.</p>

	<p>The leaf expanded in the air. It looked like a small ship in the lava sea when it came down. It was green like
		jade. The leaf floated atop the lava sea. The lava bugs, however, started to avoid it in the lava. They did not
		dare draw close to the leaf.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei stepped on the leaf, turned around, and looked at Han Sen. “If you guys are willing to be my knights, I
		am willing to take you away from here safely.”</p>

	<p>“Thanks, but no thanks.” Han Sen smiled. The woman was drunk on her own pride. She did not bother to find out who
		Han Sen was exactly, and the only threat before them were a few lava bugs. They weren’t going to stop him.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei saw Han Sen and his friends huddle together, then Han Meng’er summoned a blue shield. It shielded them
		all just as they moved to walk across the sea of lava.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei frowned and advised Han Sen, “When the lava bugs are shocked, they will explode. The heat they create can
		melt a Duke class defensive item. Even King class armor can break with the heat. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
	</p>

	<p>“Thank you for the tip,” Han Sen replied, but he did not stop walking across the sea.</p>

	<p>They were walking across the lava sea with the Demon Bug King Bai Sema for protection when suddenly many of the
		lava bugs approached. Their bodies were like burning steel, and they launched themselves against the surface of
		the Bai Sema. They exploded with a searing heat. The heat was able to melt any kind of steel, but the Bai Sema
		did not melt at all.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei looked quite surprised seeing this. Her facial expression was a complicated one. Bai Wei was operating
		her leafy vessel. She watched the others cross the lava sea. She was surprised by the level of defense the Demon
		Bug King Bai Sema had. She couldn’t help but stare at it.</p>

	<p>“How many tricks does this guy have up his sleeve?” Bai Wei looked at him weirdly.</p>

	<p>They walked one mile from the shore of the island, and when crossing the threshold, their abilities to cast air
		powers returned. Han Sen and his companions started to fly up and away from the sea of lava.</p>

	<p>The lava crocodiles that attacked did nothing to the Demon Bug King Bai Sema, either. Bai Wei had to put the leaf
		away and use her own powers to fight her way out of the lava sea’s region.</p>

	<p>Han Sen laughed at her, but he did make an offer for others to join him inside the shield; she just didn’t reply
		to him. She left by her own means.</p>

	<p>“This woman is way too full of pride.” Han Sen shook his head. He continued to investigate the Undying Bird Nest
		as he did so.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine it, and he could see how the Undying Bird Nest was full of
		mysterious cause substance chains. There were a lot of them, and there weren’t any gaps. It was scarier than the
		core substance chains on the stairs.</p>

	<p>Han Sen tried, but he failed to activate the nest’s power. He researched it for a while, but he could not figure
		out what its purpose was.</p>

	<p>“I will have to try some more when I get home. This bird nest’s power cannot be any less than Purgatory Heaven,”
		Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

	<p>When they left the underground cave, Han Sen and his companions returned to go for the Lava Valley again.</p>

	<p>“Break the camera. Pretend nothing happened today. If you guys dare speak a word about this, you’ll know what
		will happen, don’t you?” Bai Wei looked at Bao’er, who was intently filming her with the camera.</p>

	<p>“This is bad. We just destroyed a camera the other day. Now we’re going to destroy another one?” Han Sen looked
		terrible.</p>

	<p>“I will talk to Ice Blue Knight King. Just do it!” Bai Wei said.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was delighted, but his face still looked very bad. He said, “Alright, but there is still a while to go
		before we head back to base with this mission. How about we destroy it right before we return?”</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not want anyone to see any of that either, but if Bai Wei was willing to take responsibility,
		destroying it would be good.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei stopped talking. She kept walking ahead through the valley. She was there because of the deal, but she
		was being punished. She could not go back to the Extreme King just yet.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei’s punishment was because of Han Sen. Bai Wei lost the Destroyed Bible she had been tasked to recover all
		because of Dollar. That was why she was being punished by King Bai, but the punishment was for Bai Wei to
		retrieve the Undying Bird’s item. No one probably expected Bai Wei to not dare ascend the steps. Han Sen was the
		one who had earned the approval of the Undying Bird instead.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the others continued their search through Lava Valley. After three days, someone else was in Lava
		Valley who had been following them.</p>

	<p>Night River King looked cold. Although he had been forced to go, his mind to kill Han Sen wasn’t.</p>
