	<p>The elders shouted at each other, fists clenched and blood vessels pulsing. It looked like the fight was about to
		get physical.</p>

	<p>When Bao’er received the ten thousand holy airs, their behavior left them with little dignity. But when Bao’er
		asked for Han Sen’s bounty of holy air, even their pride abandoned them.</p>

	<p>Reputation wasn’t worth much, and those old monsters had lived for so long that they didn’t care about saving
		face anymore. Material wealth and power were all that mattered to them.</p>

	<p>“To all the elders and leaders, you all have students, sons, and daughters. I have nothing. You guys are really
		going to fight with me over a student?” asked a voice from outside the palace. It was Yu Shanxin and his dog Old
		Wang approaching. The man smiled.</p>

	<p>His approach silenced the elders for a moment. Yu Shanxin was half-deified, and it had been a long time since his
		murder-spree. But thinking about those days still scared them.</p>

	<p>There were a few elders there that only earned their position because Yu Shanxin had killed the elders before
		them.</p>

	<p>“Yu Shanxin, your geno art is too rare. It is not suitable for Bao’er. I remember there is a jade-looking Sky
		that recently had a baby. That one might be right up your alley.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, that jade baby suits you.”</p>

	<p>“Shanxin, this girl has so much talent. It’d be a waste for you to teach her. That jade-looking girl is far more
		suitable.”</p>

	<p>The elders kept on talking, making polite suggestions. They did not want to offend Yu Shanxin, but they did not
		want to give up the prospect of teaching Bao’er, either.</p>

	<p>Yu Shanxin smiled and opened his mouth to say something, but then his expression changed.</p>

	<p>It wasn’t just Yu Shanxin, either. The faces of the Sky Palace leader and all the elders changed. The air warped
		sinuously, and a snow-white unicorn beast appeared. Its name was Dream Beast.</p>

	<p>“She is mine. Do you guys have a problem with that?” Dream Beast came next to Bao’er, blinking at her. Then he
		looked at the elders.</p>

	<p>“Dream… you and she look way too different. She can’t practice your powers.”</p>

	<p>“I’m just here to inform you. I’m not asking for your opinions. If you don’t like it, you can try to endure ten
		thousand nightmares.” Dream Beast ignored their pleas, and then, he turned to face Han Sen. “Follow me.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen had been with Dream Beast for a few months, and he knew full well what the creature was like. He thought
		if Bao’er was to follow him, she’d be tortured. Thinking of Bao’er having to dive into the lake in search of
		gemstones made him feel sick.</p>

	<p>But before Han Sen could make a decision, Bao’er smiled and leaped onto Dream Beast’s back.</p>

	<p>Everyone was shocked. He was a Dream Beast, not a horse. A King had called him an old horse once upon a time, and
		Dream Beast had put nightmares upon him in return. That King had yet to wake up.</p>

	<p>The maids said the King was crying and crying every day in bed. They couldn’t imagine what torturous dreams he
		was enduring.</p>

	<p>But Dream Beast seemed fine with Bao’er riding him. He took Bao’er and left Sky Palace, headed straight for Dream
		Island.</p>

	<p>Han Sen followed. Even though he did not want to return to Dream Island, Bao’er was already on her way. He needed
		to know what Dream Beast was going to do with Bao’er.</p>

	<p>“Leader, how can he do such a thing? You should fix this!” When the elders snapped out of their daze and realized
		what had just occurred, they immediately started complaining to the Sky Palace leader. But even so, no one
		stopped Dream Beast from taking Bao’er.</p>

	<p>Old Shanxin left with Old Wang. A black and white swallow flew around him.</p>

	<p>The Sky Palace leader’s shoulders slumped. “If any of you can get Bao’er back from him, then you are given the
		right to be her teacher. I cannot do anything about it.”</p>

	<p>The elders looked at each other, wondering who the f*ck would dare try to take her away from Dream Beast.</p>

	<p>Han Sen chased after Dream Beast, but he couldn’t catch up. Dream Beast took her into the clouds and disappeared.
	</p>

	<p>It was fortunate Han Sen knew where Dream Island was, though, and he set his course that way.</p>

	<p>He was worried about Bao’er suffering under Dream Beast’s tutelage. If she was just going to spend her days
		digging up gemstones, he was determined to take her back.</p>

	<p>He wouldn’t let Bao’er endure such suffering, especially at the hands of an outsider. This was Sky Palace. No
		matter how strong Dream Beast was, he couldn’t take Bao’er for a student if Han Sen did not want her to be there
		with him.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen reached Dream Island, he found Dream Beast and Bao’er. But things weren’t as Han Sen had feared.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought Bao’er would be forced to collect gemstones for Dream Beast, or that she’d at least endure rough
		treatment.</p>

	<p>But what Han Sen saw was Dream Beast resting beneath the boughs of a tree. Bao’er was next to him. There was a
		host of fruit in front of Bao’er that Han Sen had never seen before, save for one.</p>

	<p>The one Han Sen had seen before was a fruit that looked like a grape. Yisha had given it to him, and it spurred
		him on to evolve and become a noble.</p>

	<p>There was a whole bunch of them there for Bao’er. There had to be at least a dozen of those grapes.</p>

	<p>Bao’er picked them up by the stalk, and she started chomping on them one by one.</p>

	<p>“It must be just an illusion. Those cannot be the real Empty Fruit,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

	<p>When Bao’er saw Han Sen approaching, she jumped into his arms and gave him one of the grapes. “Dad! Come and eat
		some fruit. The fruit Dreamy has given me is so tasty.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen opened his mouth and ate it. When he bit into it, Han Sen wanted to cry.</p>

	<p>It really was an Empty Fruit. Dream Beast had given them to her like a snack.</p>

	<p>“F<em>ck you! How come when I was here I was a slave, but Bao’er is given a bunch of Empty Fruits for a snack?
			This is so not f</em>cking fair.” On the inside, Han Sen felt like crying.</p>

	<p>Dream Beast had not forced Bao’er to stay there, either. He said Bao’er could come and go as she pleased. He also
		told her that if someone wished to bring harm to Bao’er, all she had to do was give the name to Dream Beast.</p>

	<p>“Since when was there such a big difference in treatment between two people?” Han Sen felt as if he wished to be
		reborn again.</p>

	<p>They relaxed on Dream Island for a day, and then Han Sen took Bao’er back to Jade Island with him. After resting,
		he brought Bao’er to Rainbow Cloud Peak.</p>
