    <p>
      Goddess smiled and summoned God Ring. It seemed as if she wasn’t playing
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion saw that Goddess really was going to use God Ring to
      fight the Lionheart Stamp, and when he did, he felt far more secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sister, what is Goddess doing? God Ring used to lose against Lionheart
      Stamp. Does that mean she is going to lose again? If that’s the case, then
      the lion really is going to claim the tunnel,” Yu Xuan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao frowned and said, “Goddess must have a trick up her sleeve. That
      naive Little Lion is going to lose.”
    </p>
    <p>As they both spoke, God Ring and Lionheart Stamp engaged in battle.</p>
    <p>
      Lionheart had been left behind by a super lion on Lion Mountain. It was
      one of the famous super geno cores of the place. One side of its shape
      possessed a gold lion head, which had a number of strange symbols upon it.
      In the language of lions, they merged together to form the word heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionheart Stamp was incredibly powerful, and its stamping ability was
      capable of suppressing everything. A weak super creature would easily find
      itself crushed beneath the weight of Lionheart’s demigod body. It was
      quite a frightening item.
    </p>
    <p>
      God Ring had been left behind by one of Goddess’ elders. It was shaped
      like a halo, and it even possessed a holy-like light. Creatures that came
      into contact with it would have their lifeforce absorbed. It was a very
      powerful super geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lionheart Stamp was shining gold towards God Ring, while God Ring
      shone a holy-like light back at Lionheart Stamp. Lionheart Stamp’s gold
      light soon started to suppress the God Ring’s light, making it clear that
      it wouldn’t take long for Goddess to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen found it interesting to observe. He was a good distance away from
      the super geno cores, but he could still feel the earthy rumble of the
      combat. Due to the amount of power colliding, it put stress on the
      glaciers and began to break them. Everything within a few klicks was
      utterly destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was taking place inside God Ruin, thankfully. If this was happening
      outside, entire mountains would have been sundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s such strength in these cores, but strangely, they’re no better
      than my God geno core. I don’t know if they have any others that are
      better, but if they don’t, I can definitely strike.” Han Sen’s eyes shone
      while he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Lionheart Stamp’s gold light crush and diminish the light exuded by
      God Ring, it was evident its enemy wasn’t going to last very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionheart Stamp’s gold stamp was preparing to deal a final blow and crush
      the ring for good. If it was stamped, it had no hope of withstanding the
      force, and it would shatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion was feeling very cocky now, but when Lionheart Stamp
      decided to drop down on God Ring, he suddenly saw the holy light increase
      in volume. It shone brightly to absorb its bully, and in a flash,
      Lionheart Stamp disappeared into the blinding light.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the light dimmed again, the white halo ring had grown smaller to
      tighten itself around Lionheart Stamp like a constrictive band. Lionheart
      Stamp’s gold light had also been extinguished in the grip of the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddess held out her hand, and shortly after, God Ring landed in her palm
      with the shrunken Lionheart Stamp inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is that possible?” Little Jade Lion’s face changed, and his eyes
      almost fell out of their sockets. He could not believe Lionheart Stamp had
      been taken away from him by God Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionheart Stamp had gone up against God Ring a few times in the past, and
      not once had God Ring won before. It had constantly ranked below Lionheart
      Stamp, as well. But suddenly, it had been given the necessary power to
      constrict and lock-up Lionheart Stamp. It was an act Little Jade Lion
      struggled to believe he was seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is that possible? Surely that cannot be God Ring. How can God Ring
      possess enough power to snare Lionheart Stamp?” Yu Xuan was shocked, too.
      He couldn’t believe Goddess was holding the ring with Lionheart Stamp
      trapped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is God Ring, yes, but it is the complete version.” Yu Miao spoke
      with a serious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A complete version? Did it used to be damaged?” Yu Xuan looked at Yu
      Miao. He knew about God Ring, but he had never heard that it was damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Yu Miao shook her head and said, “It wasn’t damaged, but the ring has
      a very special history.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao paused for a minute, and then spoke again. “Goddess and her people
      are creatures, but they claim to be the heirs of a god. Whether that is
      true, I do not know, but their race does have many berserk super
      creatures. The most famous was undoubtedly God Lord of Sacred. Around the
      same time God Lord was among us, there was another powerful being in
      existence. It was a berserk super creature, and it was almost as famous as
      God Lord. Unfortunately, it lost in a pivotal battle and failed to become
      Sacred’s leader.”
    </p>
    <p>“Was he the one that had God Ring?” Yu Xuan looked shocked.</p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao nodded. “The power of the Protoss was special, and that was
      because half of their blood did not belong to them. Perhaps it came from
      their mother, but their powers were not purely Protoss. The berserk super
      geno cores, even if used by the Protoss, could not exert their full power.
      The powers displayed were no different than an average super geno core.
      And as time has gone on, few people remember that this is one such geno
      core. They have forgotten it is an actual berserk super geno core.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You mean to say Goddess is able to use all its strength? Is she a pure
      Protoss? If others of her kind were unable to make use of its full power,
      how can she?” Yu Xuan was now looking Goddess with a disbelieving look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao shook her head. “I don’t know, but that matters little right now.
      The important thing to know right now is that this puts us in a bad
      situation. I seriously hope the lion isn’t as stubborn as his old man.
      Otherwise, there’ll be no chance for us to take Godlight Tunnel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddess took her ring and returned Lionheart Stamp to the lion. Then, she
      said, “Little Lion King, will you keep your promise?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Jade Lion King took the stamp. His face had turned green, and he
      couldn’t bring himself to say anything about breaking the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Lion King is no stranger to defeat. We can guard Godlight Tunnel
      together and reap the benefits ourselves,” Yu Miao shouted out, from
      across the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I lose, I lose. This Godlight Tunnel has nothing to do with Lion
      Mountain anymore.” Little Jade Lion gritted his teeth, then signaled those
      from Lion Mountain to vacate the area around the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait!” Before Little Lion King could leave, someone was heard shouting
      from beyond the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone looked over and saw the person shouting at Little Lion King was
      none other than Han Sen. They were shocked, and they did not know what he
      wanted.
