      Han Sen won every fight he was in for a dozen times. Because many fans
      were trying to match with him, the better half of his opponents were his
      fans, among whom a girl even asked for his signature, blushing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is a virtual platform. There is no way I am able do
      that.&#8221; Han Sen had to log out of the official platform. If he kept
      going like this, it would not help him at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      The news about Dollar appearing again was spread very fast. Many people
      were debating whether Kill Dollar was really Dollar himself. And more
      people were waiting for Dollar on the official platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not use the platform again. People were checking to see
      whether he was online twenty-four seven. There was no way to fight
      normally. Currently, what he needed was tough fight instead of fanfare.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lying on the bed and resting, Han Sen decided to use the military virtual
      camp the next day instead of the official platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      He could not fall asleep right away, so he dialed Ji Yanran&#8217;s
      number. After a while, Ji Yanran picked up.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Are you still busy with work so late?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, I was on the official platform,&#8221; said Ji Yanran
      excitedly. &#8220;Dollar appeared again with 40+ wings and no loss. So
      impressive! I was just watching him fighting, so good…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You also went to see Dollar? Are you his fan as well?&#8221; Han
      Sen was dazed, not knowing Ji Yanran was so interested in Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I am his fan. Who wouldn&#8217;t like such a hero? He used to
      save those kids and fight the golden-horned Shura, so manly…&#8221; Ji
      Yanran&#8217;s face was filled with worship. There were almost hearts in
      her eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hey, your boyfriend is still here. This is inappropriate,&#8221;
      Han Sen curled his lips and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha, why are you jealous? Idol is different from boyfriend. I only
      need to worship my idol from afar. If I got too close to him, I would
      definitely be disappointed. However, my boyfriend is my dearest person in
      the world, for whom I would give up everything,&#8221; she said with a
      smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not that happy to hear this. Can&#8217;t you worship your
      boyfriend? Your boyfriend is also awesome,&#8221; Han Sen said
      reluctantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is different. In my mind, you are the best. However, Dollar is
      a national hero. I just can&#8217;t compare the two of you,&#8221; Ji
      Yanran said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll let you watch your national hero. I, this ordinary
      good guy, will go to sleep.&#8221; Han Sen pretended to be hanging up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My dear, don&#8217;t be like this. If you don&#8217;t like it, I
      will not watch him anymore. What D-God? He&#8217;s definitely a loser
      compared to my genius. A hundred Dollars can&#8217;t even compare to your
      big toe. Forgive me my genius!&#8221; Ji Yanran said flirtatiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tempted by her looks, Han Sen was enamored. He was not really mad anyways.
      He was not so bored that he would be jealous of himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lying on the bed and chatting with his girlfriend, Han Sen gradually fell
      asleep after a long time. When he woke up, the comlink was still on. Ji
      Yanran was the same way, falling asleep during the call, and she was not
      up yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not wanting to bother her, Han Sen turned his comlink off. After brushing
      his teeth, he went to eat something and got ready for his virtual camp
      fight. However, his comlink suddenly started to ring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought it was Ji Yanran and answered it casually. However, in the
      holographic image that popped out Huangfu Pingqing appeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Huangfu Pingqing, how come you have the time today?&#8221; Han Sen
      said casually. They were quite familiar with each other, so he did not
      bother to go through the greetings.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you know that Dollar has appeared again?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing
      said directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I believe every evolver knows that,&#8221; Han Sen said helplessly,
      spreading his hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not expect the attention he attracted by using an ID name related
      to Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You really think that person is Dollar?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing
      said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; replied Han Sen.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing asked, puzzled.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Instinct,&#8221; Han Sen said casually, thinking, that person is
      me, so of course I know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing thought about it and said, &#8220;I also feel it is
      probably true. However, Dollar is making such a huge progress. I wonder
      which shelter he&#8217;s at.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know, I would know even less. Right, why do you
      look for him? Does Son of Heaven still want to go after him?&#8221; Han
      Sen asked, pretending to be casual.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Although my cousin hates Dollar, he is not so bored. The reason I
      want to look for him is because the footwork he was using in the fights
      looked like Heavenly Go.&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing said grimly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Even if he is using Heavenly Go, what does that have to do with
      you?&#8221; Han Sen asked, puzzled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Currently, in the Alliance there should be only two persons who
      practice Heavenly Go. One is my grandmother, and the other is the student
      of my grandmother. Even I did not manage to learn Heavenly Go. If he was
      really using that, Ares Martial Hall must investigate into that.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Hearing Huangfu Pingqing out, Han Sen felt puzzled. And then he looked at
      her and asked, &#8220;Is the student of your grandmother that Queen from
      Queen restaurant?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing looked at Han Sen,
      surprised, her breasts moving up and down dramatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing&#8217;s are the best. Although that girl has huge
      breasts, their shape was not as perky and perfect as Huangfu
      Pingqing&#8217;s. Han Sen couldn&#8217;t help thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve met Queen on Gladiator before and learned some kiting
      skills from her. It helped me a lot, but I don&#8217;t know if
      that&#8217;s the Heavenly Go you mentioned,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is that true?&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing was shocked, asking Han Sen
      to show her the skills he learned hastily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen only demonstrated what he learned from Queen and did not expose
      any part of the technique in Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>Huangfu Pingqing was even more surprised.</p>

    <p>
      After she watched Han Sen&#8217;s demonstration, she looked at Han Sen
      with a strange look and said, &#8220;Queen is a very proud person. Except
      for my grandparents, she did not care for anybody. Even I was ignored by
      her constantly. She would not even look at ordinary people. The fact that
      she would teach you Heavenly Go is simply incredulous, although she did
      not teach you a lot. Tell me, why is that?&#8221;
