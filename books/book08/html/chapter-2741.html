<h2>Very Sad Scene</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2741</h3>

<p>The sadness was as broad and powerful as the Yangtze, rolling
forward with the steadiness and implacability of a river. The
sensation rocked Han Sen. The sadness was clear, yet it wasn’t a
raw or passionate emotion. It wasn’t painful like losing your
family, and it wasn’t the heartache of being betrayed by a loved
one. It wasn’t the soul-rending anguish of losing everything that
you cherished. It just resided in Han Sen’s chest, softly. The ache
was so gentle that sometimes, Han Sen could barely even sense it.
It floated like a mountain stream, but there wasn’t a single ripple
to be seen.</p>
<p>But this kind of sadness was subtly powerful, and it was
infectious. It left Han Sen unable to do anything except cry his
eyes out. He couldn’t get a grip on his emotions, and he couldn’t
move his eyes away from the Very High eye mark. He just stood in
front of the stone wall, staring at the stone with eyes rimmed in
blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s brain knew that if things continued like this, the
blood in his body would run dry and he would die. But he couldn’t
move his feet to tear himself away from that sad scene.</p>
<p>To one of the Very High who had practiced the Very High Sense to
an average level, the emotions conveyed by a painting would be
fairly weak. But to a Very High that had practiced the Very High
Sense to a high level, it would be confusing to see how much scary
sadness could be conveyed by this piece of artwork.</p>
<p>“Why would this elder have felt so much sadness? He was already
in the true god class. He was at the top level of the pyramid of
universal power. What could make him this sad? This depression is
too strange. It is completely different from any of the emotions
that I have endured. It makes me think of the phrase, ‘Sadness that
is greater than the heart dying.’ This sadness is a little like
that, but then again, it isn’t quite the same,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>“This Very High elder left all this behind before heading for
the Geno Hall. Was his sadness related to the Geno Hall in some
way?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it a lot, but he couldn’t come to a
conclusion. Regardless, he couldn’t rid himself of the infectious
sadness. Even with Han Sen’s strong will, he couldn’t pull his eyes
away from the drawing.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer had synced their minds to the Ancient Wall
when they first arrived, so they had spent most of the trip
ignoring the feelings Han Sen was sending to them.</p>
<p>This sadness was too potent to be ignored, however, and so it
managed to reach them. It pulled Exquisite and Li Keer away from
the Ancient Wall’s minds. They were also infected by the sadness,
and they soon found tears leaking down their cheeks.</p>
<p>“What is going on… Why is it so sad here?” Exquisite’s face
suddenly paled. She felt the sadness, but at the same time, she
understood. “Oh, no! Han Sen has seen the Ancient Wall’s Very High
eye mark.”</p>
<p>Li Keer also realized what had happened. Her face looked
haggard, and bloody tears fell from her eyes as she said, “How was
he able to trigger the eye mind? I thought only the Very High who
had practiced the Very High Sense could activate it.”</p>
<p>“Although Han Sen hasn’t practiced the Very High Sense, his
Under the Sky knife skills seem to emulate Sky and Man Combined
Together. It is similar to the Very High Sense. Maybe that is why
he was able to trigger the Very High eye mind… But now isn’t the
time to discuss this. We must quickly find a way to pull Han Sen
away from that mind. If we don’t, he won’t be the only one who is
damaged by that mind.” Exquisite’s eyes were full of blood, and it
was on the verge of spilling down across her face.</p>
<p>“How do we pull him away? The eye of the Ancient Wall is no
joke. Even if we move his body away so that he can’t physically see
the mark, we can’t stop the mind from dealing damage to him. And if
we move him away, he might even get consumed by the mind. Don’t you
remember the stories?” Li Keer said.</p>
<p>Exquisite didn’t respond. She knew what Li Keer meant. Anyone
who triggered the Very High eye mind had to make it through
themselves. If they made it through, their proficiency with the
Very High Sense would increase. But if they failed to endure it,
their will would be destroyed by the sadness. It wouldn’t be easy
for them to recover. They might even end up crippled, unable to
level up ever again.</p>
<p>Some people had even died at the Ancient Wall, and no one had
been able to save them.</p>
<p>Stories were one thing, but facing the threat in real life was
something else. If they didn’t think of a way to break Han Sen free
from the Very High eye mind, both of their minds might be damaged
by the overflow of what Han Sen was experiencing. They might not
die from it, but they would be heavily damaged. Countless Very High
elders, who were all gifted and intelligent, had ended up ruined by
the Very High eye mind. The two women didn’t think they were any
better than the aforementioned Very High seniors. And in addition,
they weren’t even deified.</p>
<p>The two of them tried to walk over to Han Sen, but as they came
nearer, they were completely entranced by the emotions of the wall.
They stood there with their eyes bleeding. They couldn’t drag their
minds away from the drawings on the wall.</p>
<p>Their strange situation quickly drew the attention of the other
Very High around the wall.</p>
<p>“Weird. They seem to have been infected by the sad mind of the
Very High eye. What is going on? I didn’t think they were close
enough to trigger the eye.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t their masters teach them that after practicing the Very
High Sense, they couldn’t look at the eye on the Ancient Wall?”</p>
<p>“No. They didn’t see it. They must have been affected because
their silkworm saw the eye.”</p>
<p>“How is that possible? He hasn’t practiced the Very High Sense.
He shouldn’t have felt anything if he looked at the eye’s
mark.”</p>
<p>A dozen of the Very High were in front of the Ancient Wall, and
they all stared at Han Sen. They understood the situation Han Sen
was in, and they registered that he was the one who had triggered
the Very High eye’s mind. That had led to Li Keer and Exquisite
being dragged into the crippling emotions with him.</p>
<p>“This is weird. How could an outsider who hasn’t practiced the
Very High Sense activate the Very High eye mark’s mind?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the time for a research question. We have to find a
way to pull him out of the mind. The eye mark is dangerous for
anyone, but for Exquisite and Li Keer, it will be
life-threatening.”</p>
<p>“What can we do, though? You know how powerful this mind is.
Even if we move the silkworm elsewhere, we won’t be able to stop
the mind from consuming his consciousness. And if we move him, we
might even disrupt his will and accelerate the process. The only
way we can do anything is if the silkworm escapes the bonds of that
mind on his own.”</p>
<p>“How would that be possible? We are deified elites of the Very
High, and few of us can escape the power of the Very High eye mind.
This guy is just an outsider.”</p>
<p>“That’s the silkworm’s only hope, though. He has to do it
himself. Even if Exquisite and Li Keer fight back the power of the
mind, it would be useless. As long as he remains trapped, the sad
mind will keep overflowing onto Exquisite and Li Keer.”</p>
