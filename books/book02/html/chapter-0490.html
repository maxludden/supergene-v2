<p>After Wang Dongyun had thought of it, he could no longer hold it back. Wang Dongyun then recorded all the following fights by Kill Dollar.</p>

<p>After Wang Dongyun watched several rounds, Kill Dollar suddenly left the virtual platform. Wang Dongyun then watched what he recorded repeatedly.</p>

<p>The more Wang Dongyun watched, the more incredulous he felt. In every fight, Kill Dollar was winning overwhelmingly, leaving his opponent no chance to fight back.</p>

<p>&#8220;This guy is very likely Dollar himselfâ€¦&#8221; Wang Dongyun felt more and more excited. Although there were a lot of master fighters in evolvers, he could not think of anyone else other than Dollar who would name himself that.</p>

<p>However, Wang Dongyun was not sure whether that was true. He hesitated and uploaded his recordings to the official forum with the title &#8220;Dollar Is Back? Crushing It All.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because there had not been any news about Dollar in a long time, the video did not attract too much attention in the beginning.</p>

<p>However, one person had always been paying attention to the news of Dollar, which was the host Fang Mingquan.</p>

<p>Currently, Fang Mingquan was already the top host of Huaxing Station. Almost all the shows he hosted had great ratings. One of his recent programs had a rating over a hundred million in the entire Alliance for his first episode, which was definitely among the top shows.</p>

<p>Compared to his old days, Fang Mingquan was having a great time, enjoying the life as a celebrity.</p>

<p>However, Fang Mingquan had never forgotten about Dollar who made his career, constantly looking for news of Dollar.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Han Sen had not used the identity of Dollar recent years. Even if Fang Mingquan wanted to do something, he could not since he had no news of Dollar at all.</p>

<p>This day, Fang Mingquan searched for Dollar on the Skynet as usual, looking for the latest news.</p>

<p>As he was searching, Fang Mingquan thought, Dollar, you should have been in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary for two or three years. With what you got, you should have gained a lot of geno points already. Come on, it&#8217;s your time.</p>

<p>Fang Mingquan suddenly saw the video named &#8220;Dollar Is Back? Crushing It All&#8221; and clicked to watch.</p>

<p>In recent years he had seen lots of articles and videos with titles like this. Many of the titles were even more dramatic, such as &#8220;The Truth about Dollar&#8217;s Fall: The Mysterious Woman in His Bed,&#8221;&#8220;The Mystery of Dollar&#8217;s Disappearance: A Four-Day-Long Sin,&#8221; etc. However, none of them had any substantial constant.</p>

<p>After watching the video, Fang Mingquan&#8217;s face suddenly became grim. He was so excited that he was shivering.</p>

<p>Although the person in the video used the face blur function and all he could see was his ID name, he had a feeling that this person was Dollar. After watching the video seriously, Fang Mingquan was quite surprised. &#8220;Indeed, it is Dollar. Even among evolvers, he is the absolute top. I have never seen anything like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without any hesitation, Fang Mingquan edited the video into a more solid version, ready to show it during his show time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Liu, make some arrangements to move the topic today to next episode.&#8221; Fang Mingquan called his assistant.</p>

<p>Liu felt puzzled about why Fang Mingquan would suddenly change the topic, which was something he had prepared for nearly a month. However, Fang Mingquan was so popular these days that even the stationmaster was calling Fang Mingquan brother with a huge grin every time he saw Fang Mingquan. Fang Mingquan was totally authorized to change the topic without asking for approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fang Mingquan, what topic should we focus on in this episode?&#8221; After making the arrangements, Liu asked Fang Mingquan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollar.&#8221; Fang Mingquan only said one word.</p>

<p>Fang Mingquan played the video in his show and announced the return of Dollar with thrilling words, which was a bomb among the evolvers in the Alliance. Many people started to discuss about it, given the hundreds of millions of audience Fang Mingquan had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true? Is he really Dollar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His name is Kill Dollar, that is more like Dollar&#8217;s enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These punches are so amazing. How did he do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollar is so handsome, crushing it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My King, you&#8217;re eventually back. Please accept my allegiance. I&#8217;ve been waiting for so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What king? He was not necessarily able to beat Lin Feng when he was unevolved. Not to mention he is now in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. He has not been there for many years. How strong can he be? There are so many evolvers who could kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fuck off. My Dollar is invincible anywhere he goes. What the heck do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be so excited. It is obvious whether Dollar is strong or not. You can tell from the video that all his opponents were sacred-blood aristocrats, but they were all defeated by Dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, the strength of my King is beyond doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heck, I wish to see him fight again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After waiting for so long, I see my King again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollar, I want to have your baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you must be a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not even sure whether he is Dollar. No rush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the official platform, so we can all go check it out. It seems that he has fought a lot.&#8221;</p>

<br>

<hr />

<br>

<p>Just like this, a large number of people flooded into the official platform, and many among them tried to send Dollar friend requests.</p>

<p>When Han Sen logged into the platform again, he heard the notification sounds of friend requests ringing like a fire engine.</p>

<p>Han Sen took a look and saw tens of millions of friend requests, which shocked him completely. He had no idea what had happened.</p>

<p>However, there was no way for him to check all these requests, so he had to change his privacy setting to reject every friend request. Also, he chose not to accept any new friend request. And his world suddenly became quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth happened?&#8221; Han Sen looked at the news on the Skynet and found out what had happened. He felt both surprised and amused. In the same time, he felt Fang Mingquan must have some mysterious connection to him, being able to tell he was Dollar under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not mean to explain and chose a random match. The moment he entered the fight, the observers in his room maxed out. There were so many people waiting to watch his fight and they all clicked at the same time. Some had entered the room, while some were told the room was full.</p>
