<h2>Weird Deified Xenogeneic</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2907</h3>

<p>Although Han Sen was only butterfly class now, in the universe,
no one treated him like one.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at everyone. He noticed the around eight people
were deified primitives who all hailed from different races.</p>
<p>They looked a bit familiar. He had seen them all participate in
the geno god list fights, but their performances were nothing
remarkable. It was because of that Han Sen was not able to recall
their names.</p>
<p>“These guys aren’t of the same race. What are they doing here
together?” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>Deified elites frequently cooperated with each other, but that
was usually only in groups of three or five best friends. It was
rare to see so many races cooperate at once.</p>
<p>The deifieds all recognized Han Sen and greeted him with
exuberant passion.</p>
<p>A deified elite, who looked like a rat that could stand, shook
his head and said, “Godfather Han, it is an honor to see you here.
This is my lucky day…”</p>
<p>While he spoke, his small yet long tail waved. It made people
feel annoyed to see it.</p>
<p>After pausing, the rat-looking deified elite said, “I would like
Godfather Han to bless me. What material does Godfather Han require
to bless others?”</p>
<p>Every creature knew Han Sen did not require any materials to
bless others. For him to ask like that was basically asking how
much it would cost.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “Blessing you would be easy. The price
is fair and square. For just one true god weapon, I can do it. But
I cannot guarantee you will level up.”</p>
<p>Han Sen set the price very high. No one would give up a true god
weapon for a blessing. That was a way for him to reject requests.
Han Sen did not want to use Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>
<p>All of the deified creatures were disappointed. They were just
primitive deifieds, so they did not have a true god weapon to hand
out.</p>
<p>But they did not dare get emotional. They did not want to incite
the ire of Han Sen, who might turn them into dust. They had
practiced hard to get to where they were as a deified. A lot of it
had even required dumb luck. If they were turned into dust, it
would not only be a sadness for their loss of lives. It could have
very well spelled doom for their entire race.</p>
<p>It was like the Buddha and the Destroyed. The Buddha were barely
able to maintain control of the Buddha Kingdom, and the Destroyed
were being harassed by ancient enemies.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at them and asked, “What are you guys doing
here?”</p>
<p>The rat-looking deified creature immediately said, “Earlier,
there was a God Spirit storm. A deified xenogeneic appeared from
the God Spirit storm. We saw it. The deified xenogeneic was weird
though. We are still talking about it.”</p>
<p>“How weird was it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Everyone was talking at once. They explained that they had
encountered a deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>The xenogeneics in the God Area came with the appearance of God
Spirit storms.</p>
<p>All the primitive deifieds were in the same area when they
experienced the God Spirit storm. They were all deemed food for the
assembling deified xenogeneics.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic they saw inside the God Spirit storm was
different from the usual suspects. That xenogeneic was like a stone
tablet that was 30 feet tall.</p>
<p>The stone tablet had electricity in it. It was surrounded by a
lot of light. Even a blind man could see it from a thousand miles
away.</p>
<p>They rushed in front of the stone tablet, but the tablet had no
words or symbols. There were no pictures on it either. There were
three indentations in it.</p>
<p>There were three slots on the tablet. They were at the top and
led down. The first one was like a human handprint, albeit much
bigger.</p>
<p>The second one looked like a cat paw, but it was much bigger
too.</p>
<p>The third one was like a cow’s footprint. That one, however, was
at a normal size. It was a small footprint.</p>
<p>The three marks on the stone tablet released a bright light.</p>
<p>In the God Area, all xenogeneics were weird. One often found
stone xenogeneics too. The primitive deified creatures wanted to
destroy the stone tablet to see if they could get a deified
xenogeneic gene.</p>
<p>When they attacked the stone tablet, they were unable to harm
the stone tablet. The light of the stone tablet grew brighter.
Ultimately, there was no difference. The power of the stone tablet
did not fight back either.</p>
<p>“How could this happen? Is that stone tablet xenogeneic still
around?” Some xenogeneics that fell from the God Spirit storm would
not disappear when the storm was over, which was why Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“It is still around, but the stone tablet is black and no longer
shines. If we do not see it shining, no one would think it was a
deified xenogeneic. You would just think of it as an ordinary stone
block.” The rat-like creature paused. With an evil look, he said,
“Han Godfather, if you are interested, we can take you there to see
it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.” Han Sen was worried about not being able to find
high-level xenogeneics. Upon hearing what they said about the stone
tablet xenogeneic was weird, there was a chance it was a high-level
one.</p>
<p>A few deified xenogeneics led the way. Han Sen followed them.
Altogether, they flew for 3,000 miles. Eventually, they saw a stone
tablet that was a couple of dozen feet high.</p>
<p>The stone tablet was very rough. It was square, and it did not
have engravings or markings on it. The stone tablet was full of
holes. It was not even. It looked like a normal big stone
board.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned the stone tablet around. He saw the three marks
on it. Their shape and appearance were just as they had been
described.</p>
<p>Aside from the stone tablet, someone was standing before it. It
was Bai Wushang. He was one of the Extreme Kings in the god list
fights.</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard Bai Wushang was a higher level than Bai King
now. He was a person from the same era as Bao King. He was very
powerful in the god list fights.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not watched him fight, so he knew little about
him.</p>
<p>Before the top 100 rank fights, Han Sen had not watched many
battles. He had missed out on Bai Wushang’s fighting performance.
In the top 100, no one dared to challenge Bai Wushang, and Bai
Wushang did not challenge anyone.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen only knew how strong he was. He did not know exactly
how strong he was.</p>
<p>The few primitive deifieds who saw Bai Wushang bowed before him.
They did not dare go slow.</p>
<p>Han Sen just stood where he was and did not move. His identity
was one that harbored a grudge with the Extreme King. He would not
talk with a deified from the Extreme King.</p>
<p>Bai Wushang ignored the primitive deified creatures. He just
stared at the stone tablet.</p>
<p>The primitive deifieds were ignored, but they did not show
emotion. They just retreated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Bai Wushang watched for a while. He then raised his fist and
punched the stone tablet.</p>
<p>He used the Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch. His punch was
performed at a very high level. The punch, which looked very
casual, had the power to suppress the sky and the earth.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>He punched the stone tablet. The stone tablet’s surface caved-in
with the shape of a fist.</p>
<p>The moment Bai Wushang brought his fist back, the fist-crater
shone. It shone with rainbow light.</p>
