    <p>
      The area surrounding the Dark Haunted Tree King became a shura hellscape.
      Zero approached the trunk of the tree, as the corpses of countless
      mutilated bats lay scattered across the ground. They had all been killed,
      and their black blood puddled on the forest floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bugs flew around in the air aimlessly, not wanting to approach Zero.
      Even the Tree King itself shook with fear, and as it trembled, leaves
      cascaded to the ground and a low noise vibrated the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emotionlessly, Zero resumed walking until she was standing directly in
      front of the tree. When she touched the rugged bark, her eyes made her
      look lost and confused.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was watching Zero in complete wonder, and then, she began to punch
      the tree. The bark was beaten against harshly as each fist produced a
      flight of wood chips and splinters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without reprieve, fist after fist struck the tree. After a short but
      copious production of wood shavings, a meter-wide hole had been punched
      into it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen squinted to get a good look, and noticed that the tree was hollow
      on the inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero then began climbing into the hole, and when Han Sen saw this, he
      greatly desired to follow. But there had been no change to the area, and
      upon taking a few steps forward, he began to feel his lifeforce drain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was quick to react to this negation of energy, too.
      Immediately after breaching the forbidden perimeter, it squealed and leapt
      off Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t immediately pull back. Instead, he tried stepping
      forward once more. The drain on his energy only increased, and realizing
      the futility of approaching, he fell back to rejoin the silver fox. He
      didn&#8217;t want to die from a sudden old age, as the people at the camp
      had told him would happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Zero climbed into the hole that had been beaten into the tree, Han
      Sen could no longer see what she was doing with his naked eyes. She had
      also now escaped the vision of dongxuan aura and the devil-eye mask.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was keen and eager to see what was going on, worried for
      Zero&#8217;s wellbeing. But where his eyes failed, his ears took over.
      From inside that hole he could hear the sound of more snapping wood.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dark Haunted Tree King continued to shiver, and the flowers that
      adorned its canopy seemed to be wilting. Petals and tree leaves danced to
      cloak the air in a thick volume.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t only the tree king that was affected, either. The whole
      forest seemed to be suffering the same fate, as the flowers across each
      tree began to suddenly wilt and their petals lost themselves to the caress
      of the breeze that sifted through the canopies. Despite the sordid origin
      of the affair, its closure was a beautiful sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What happened here?&#8221; Liu Fang and Wang Jiangang came running
      towards Han Sen. Something big was happening, so it only seemed natural
      for the change to be the result of their latest arrivals to the forest.
      Thinking something ill might have befallen Han Sen, they quickly came over
      to check.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head, continuing to gaze towards the crude hole in the
      side of the tree king.
    </p>

    <p>But suddenly, screams sounded from the tents back at camp.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no! Something wretched must have occurred at our camp!&#8221;
      Liu Fang exclaimed, as she turned around and started running back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen was desperate to know what was going on inside the tree,
      he knew there was nothing he could do from where he was standing. Thinking
      he could still lend a hand someplace else, Han Sen accompanied Liu Fang in
      her hasty return to camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before the three returned, they saw two people running across the meadow
      with faces of abhorrent shock. They were drenched in blood, as well, but
      it did not come from them.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Wang Jiangang asked aloud.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ghost! There is a ghost!&#8221; The two shaken runners could only
      respond that, as they departed for the cover the foliage of the wood could
      provide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not say anything, and he simply resumed his race to the camp
      which had now been reduced to ruin. The meadow, the sole place that
      hadn&#8217;t been covered in trees, was now a giant crater. Inside the pit
      sat a black, rectangle box. It was three meters long, and it appeared to
      have been constructed from wood. Upon closer inspection, Han Sen noticed
      it to be a six-sided box with curved shoulders.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is that a coffin?&#8221; Han Sen looked at the object and thought
      it looked reminiscent of the caskets that were used to bury humans, a long
      time ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coffins did not exist in this day and age, and hadn&#8217;t for a very
      long time. You would only see coffins in either museums or ancient TV
      shows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coffins had once been objects of great superstition for people, and if you
      wanted to see one now, you&#8217;d have to visit a museum in the Alliance.
      It was shocking to see one here, in the sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had never heard of creatures or spirits making use of coffins
      before, so the existence of one there seemed to be impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if spirits died, they&#8217;d self-destruct their spirit stone. So,
      why might they possess a coffin?
    </p>

    <p>
      It&#8217;d be even stranger for a creature to own a coffin. Super
      creatures might have been smart, but they weren&#8217;t superstitious.
      They shouldn&#8217;t have even known what a coffin was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures were born in the wild, and expected to eventually die in the
      wild. And when their demise came about, their death usually resulted in
      food for the survival of others.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did humans bring a coffin over here and bury it?&#8221; Han Sen was
      shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Fang and Wang Jiangang looked equally shocked, now realizing they had
      been sleeping above a coffin all those years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its slumber there in the earth must have been why no trees grew above. Its
      existence provided them their sole meadow. It couldn&#8217;t have been a
      coincidence, so the state of the forest had to be connected with the
      coffin somehow.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was even scarier, people in the camp were bleeding in proximity to
      the coffin. The people that had remained there looked smaller than they
      used to, and their muscles appeared dry. They looked shrivelled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blood painted the grass in that area, and the people were nothing more
      than bled-out corpses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their bodies had no wounds, the blood seemed to drain from all of their
      face&#8217;s orifices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Fang and Wang Jiangang continued looking at the coffin in shock. Its
      lid trembled and vibrated, suggesting something was about to come out of
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, too, stared at the coffin. But with his devil-eye mask, he could
      not make out the presence of a lifeforce.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen&#8217;s eighth sense disturbed him.</p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      After a loud noise, the cover of the coffin was pushed to the side
      slightly. Lengthy, creepy nails and fingers felt their way out. And unlike
      the nails of humans today, which were trimmed and well taken care of, they
      were thick and unkempt. They were black and red, appearing wild. Their
      appearance invoked a sense of dread.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The coffin&#8217;s lid was pushed away slightly more, creating a gap big
      enough to invite a whole hand out from the black interior of the box.
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>
      And suddenly, that was what occurred. A pale white hand shot out of the
      black, grabbing the side of the coffin with frightening vigor.
