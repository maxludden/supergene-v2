  Han Sen’s balls ached. People kept talking about him and the Kingese he had absorbed as if he was some godly being that had paid them a visit. It was as if he was the crown prince or something. Even people with little interest in politics were caught up in the popular topic of conversation, fascinated by the idea that the previously-unknown prince had suddenly become so famous. Even King Bai was suddenly paying him a lot of attention. There was every chance he’d become a higher figure in the hierarchy, or even the new crown prince.

But Han Sen knew that many people were still suspicious regarding his identity. Many royals came to visit him. They were all trying to test Han Sen, especially the horrible friends that Bai Yi used to have. They wanted to skin him and get a look at Bai Yi’s bones.

Han Sen used the excuse of needing to heal to block the intrusions of such people.

Of course, Han Sen’s body was in some trouble, too. Those Kingese symbols had blended into his cells, and it made his body far stronger than his actual presence. He was like a steel board, and it was a struggle for him to circulate his energy.

But that wasn’t too big of a problem for Han Sen. The Story of Genes could be cast normally. As long as The Story of Genes could level up, he could absorb the Kingese power so it wouldn’t interfere with any of his other powers that were running.

Now, Han Sen was only missing Duke genes. One hundred Duke genes were necessary for the opening of a gene lock. Opening two or three gene locks should allow him to absorb all the Kingese.

When Captain Water Moon came, she healed his injuries from the explosion. Aside from being unable to use powers, Han Sen was back to normal.

His body was stuffed to the brim with Kingese. If someone wanted to hurt him, they would have to earn the approval of the Kingese. At this point, Han Sen felt as if he wouldn’t even have to use his energy to fight. He could use the Kingese in his body to fight against foes that were currently stronger than he was.

The bad thing was that the Kingese couldn’t be activated on their own. Han Sen needed to touch someone to activate the Kingese inside his body.

“It looks like I need to hunt down some xenogeneics,” Han Sen thought to himself. He took the blood kirin with him and dove into the deep sea. There was nothing special about the xenogeneics inhabiting Planet Water Zone, but there were some Duke xenogeneics lurking about. They were the ones that Bai Yi had looked over most frequently. And in regards to the King class creatures that lived on the planet, they had mostly been killed by Bai Yi already.

“Very good. You have the protection of Kingese. Was this a calculated move on your part, to push you into becoming a King? Should big sister start calling you a King already?” Han Sen had just ventured into the deep sea when a woman appeared beside him. Before he had found any xenogeneics, Fox Queen had come to see him.

“Why are you here? Aren’t you afraid of being found out?” Han Sen looked around. Luckily, there weren’t many people occupying Planet Water Zone. Bai Yi hadn’t bothered to hire guards for patrols, and Lan Haixin’s people weren’t going to be around.

“What are you afraid of? My good little brother is going to become a King. You understand that your big sister would want to come and share in your victory, of course,” Fox Queen said quietly. She came close to Han Sen and leaned on his chest. Her fingers twirled and played with Han Sen’s hair.

“Stop teasing me, big sister. I will be doomed very soon.” Han Sen bore a wry smile.

Fox Queen reached out her hand to touch Han Sen on the forehead. She gently said to him, “You know you are in trouble, huh? So, why are you trying to keep such a high profile? You keep on causing such big incidents and causing so much trouble for yourself. Not even the Fox, when undercover, would dare be as loud as you. It is like you are afraid people do not recognize you.”

“I didn’t know things would come to this,” Han Sen said with a shrug of his shoulders.

Fox Queen rolled her eyes and said, “I cannot help you with this. The others might accept what you’ve done, but King Bai must surely be suspicious about your identity. If I have guessed it correctly, he will likely be asking Miss Mirror to investigate you. This woman is very cruel, and she has destroyed many races. I don’t know how many deified elites she has brought down. If she notices anything wrong about you, you can consider yourself a very dead boy.”

“Please tell me what to do, sister,” Han Sen said quickly. If Fox Queen had come all the way here, it wouldn’t have been for the sole purpose of teasing him.

Fox Queen squeezed Han Sen’s cheek and smiled. “Due to the fact you are my good little brother, I have an idea. It entirely depends on whether or not you are brave enough to go through with it.”

“What is it?” Han Sen didn’t move.

Fox Queen sighed and said, “Since you know about Cher, I’m not going to hide anything. I want to reclaim a treasure from the Extreme King. But now, we have run into some turbulent trouble. It is because of this that we require your help. If you help me get the item, we will escape the Extreme King together. And then, you and I can be together and disappear from this world. Doesn’t that sound very romantic?”

“What is the item that you want to get, and where can I get it from?” Han Sen didn’t dare make a promise, and he pretended not to hear her last remark.

If even a woman as powerful as Fox Queen had failed to retrieve what she wanted, that wasn’t a good sign. Whatever the item was, it had to be difficult to retrieve.

Fox Queen didn’t hesitate to say, “It is inside Destiny’s Tower. Even a royal of the Extreme King cannot enter. A royal child has to do something incredible to gain permission to access that place. I talked to Bai Canglang, but I was unable to enter Destiny’s Tower with him.”

“If Bai Canglang cannot get in, it is useless for you to come to me about it.” Upon hearing that her target was Destiny’s Tower, Han Sen knew he wouldn’t be working with her. Stealing an item from that place was suicide.

Ever since Han Sen had seen the Destiny’s Tower of the Extreme King, he had been very interested in it. He researched the structure quite thoroughly, and before he had even assumed the identity of Bai Yi, he learned something interesting about the place. Han Sen soon came to learn how scary and mysterious Destiny’s Tower really was.

Han Sen was very curious about the tower, but he hadn’t done anything about it yet. He wasn’t going to let Fox Queen get him killed.

Plus, he didn’t trust Fox Queen. She said they would escape together, but Han Sen didn’t believe her.

Fox Queen lifted a finger and set it down on Han Sen’s lips. Her eyes looked very seductive, and she said, “Bai Yi might not have been able to gain access, but you are different. You claimed the Extreme King alpha’s statue. And you are the Bai Yi that earned so many Kingese symbols. It shouldn’t be hard for you to gain access to Destiny’s Tower.”

“How do I get in?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He wasn’t going to help her, but he wanted to get inside, anyway. Hearing Fox Queen’s idea about how to get in would be nice, so perhaps she would prove a little useful.

“Promise to work with me, and then you will know.” Fox Queen’s slender finger touched Han Sen’s cheek. She smiled. “You can think about it, but you don’t have much time. I hope that the next time you visit me, you will give me a pleasing answer.”

After that, Fox Queen fell back and disappeared into the water.
