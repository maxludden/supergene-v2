God smiled and looked at Han Sen and said, "You leveled up fast. If you wish to win this game of chess, you will have to work harder."

"Let's play again some other time. For now, I need to practice and get ready for the next fight." Han Sen wanted to keep playing chess, but his temper was something special. The more he lost, the more he wanted to go on. He wanted to keep trying until he beat his opponent.

Upon thinking of becoming butterfly class, he stayed his desire to keep playing chess.

"Can I look at the scabbard?" God asked.

"It is just a broken scabbard. There is nothing to see." Han Sen stood up. He wanted to go straight to Nine-Defense Palace.

"If I have guessed it correctly, you were the one that killed Sky Vine Radish," God casually said. "You should possess his god personality. If you allow me to inspect the scabbard, I can tell you how to use Sky Vine Radish's god personality."

"I don't have a god personality. If you want to see it that much, then take it. It is just a broken scabbard. What good is there to see?" Han Sen pulled out the scabbard to show God.

He had two god personalities already, but he did not know how to make use of them. It was pointless for him to keep holding onto them. If he knew how to use them, it would be very good for him.

God took the scabbard and analyzed it while speaking to Han Sen. "It is an armament made from a broken god personality. This should be Sky Armor God's god personality."

Han Sen guessed that the scabbard was made from a god personality. He did not expect it to be a broken god personality or that it belonged to Sky Armor God.

After seeing it, God returned the scabbard to Han Sen, smiled, and said, "Here is some advice. if you meet Sky Armor God, do not reveal this scabbard to him."

"I thought gods could not do anything to the creatures of the universe," Han Sen said.

"That is how things are supposed to work, but it depends on how you apply the rules." God didn't really explain anything.

"Are you saying that Sky Armor God will come and try to steal the scabbard?" Han Sen asked.

"Maybe. You should just be careful, anyway." God was not willing to talk anymore and said that something needed to be prepared. God was going to tell Han Sen how to make use of a god personality another time.

Han Sen went to Nine-Defense Palace a few times as part of his preparation to become a butterfly.

Seeing Han Sen walk away, God looked up into space where the geno god list was. Upon seeing the next opponent Han Sen was up against, God said with a strange expression, "There is only abyss knight in the bottomless abyss. With Sky Armor God's personality, he will try to possess the abyss knight. He will cast a god body landing. He will take back the god personality when he joins the geno god list. That means the next fight will be interesting. Let me see what your level is."

In Nine-Defense Palace, Han Sen opened up an empty palace and went inside. He quickly closed it. He did not know if he could avoid God watching him, but it was all he could do.

"Battle body evolving..."

After Han Sen chose to level up, he felt as if the cells of his entire body were changing. It was like countless currents of electricity coursed through his cells. It made his body feel itchy and numb. It was like his bones were going to become crispy.

Ka-cha-cha!

Han Sen seemed to hear his own bones being torn up, which shocked him. He quickly looked inside his body. He noticed it was not his bones that were cracking. The bones were actually growing really fast. It was like a child growing at an accelerated rate.

When his flesh grew, Han Sen's body became bigger. He went from looking like a child to having the appearance of an adult. But things hadn't ended just yet.

The Extreme King's Overbearing Eye, which had combined with Han Sen's eye because it had absorbed the gene changes of his genes, started to change too.

Han Sen's changes did not quite feel the same. The Extreme King's Overbearing Eye was true god class. The changes triggered a tide of power to drown Han Sen's body.

After combining with the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye, he hadn't been able to notice any differences with his own eyes. He also could not use the power the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye contained.

Now, the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye was changing with Han Sen. It made him feel like he was being drowned in the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye's power. Everything he saw became black and white.

It did not matter if it was a yellow metal wall or a red pillar, all the colors in Han Sen's eyes became white. It was scarily white. It was like he was in a 2D comic book world.

Everything was white. Only when Han Sen's eyes drew closer to the palace's xenogeneic did he see black.

It was different from before. Han Sen's eyes were only showing things in black and white. Now, when he looked at the xenogeneic, he could see the xenogeneic had greed, hopelessness, toxins, hatred, jealousy, and pride. He was able to see all those negative emotions.

Han Sen was able to understand that there was something wrong. In all the palace around him, there were no more xenogeneics. The one closest to him was seven palaces away. He was able to see the black xenogeneic seven palaces away. It was very weird.

Han Sen looked in another direction. He saw xenogeneics inside other palaces. In Han Sen's eyes, they were black. Some of them were darker while others were lighter.

Han Sen suddenly realized that the black meant crime. The darker it was, the more crimes the creature had accumulated.

Han Sen looked at himself. He realized his body was transparent. One could not see if he was black or white.

"It looks like in every era, every enforcer has a special type of authority," Han Sen said to mock himself.

"Battle body has successfully leveled up to butterfly... Battle body evolving..."

Why is it still evolving... Han Sen was surprised. He had just become a butterfly, but he didn't absorb xenogeneic genes. So, how could he keep on evolving?

It looks like it is the effect of the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye. Han Sen felt his body continue to change. It was different from the previous changes. Now, every time he changed, Han Sen felt his body connect to the universe more and more.

It wasn't the whole universe perse. More accurately, it was the power of law in the universe. Because of the Extreme King's Overbearing Eye, Han Sen was evolving toward the rule, and he was becoming a true god because of it.

The black and white eye in Han Sen's hand was becoming stronger. The black and white rule god light was going to break space and go to the sky. Han Sen's whole body was full of rule power.

Now, Han Sen had the wrong feeling. He seemed to control some sort of amazing power. If he was willing, he could judge a creature's sin how he wanted to.

But this power was very weird. Strength was no longer the scale of Han Sen's power now. He scaled with the sins of his opponent. The more sins an opponent had, the more power Han Sen could judge it by.

Bzzt!

Han Sen's eye exhibited changes that flipped the sky and ground. Clearly, his other eye was different. He felt it receive a big power jump.

"Is this true god power?" Han Sen felt the changed eye keep spreading. It was like it was leading his body to be deified.

Han Sen was suddenly shaking. The power that spread from his eye returned to his eye like the tide. All the changes stopped.

An announcement played in Han Sen's head. "Battle body leveling up failed."
