<p>Very soon, Han Sen found out sadly that the meat was as tough as ever. Han Sen chewed the meat and felt as if he was chewing calfskin. There was no way his teeth could tear up the meat.</p>

<p>In the end, Han Sen decided to simply swallow the meat since the slice was quite thin. However, after he swallowed it up, nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Even if this piece of meat did not give him any geno point, Han Sen should still be able to hear the voice telling him no geno point gained. However, after swallowing, Han Sen had heard nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the heck?&#8221; Han Sen felt quite upset. He hesitated and summoned holy angel, wondering if she would eat it. If she could not eat it, then the meat was useless.</p>

<p>After seeing the meat of golden growler, holy angel was overjoyed and threw itself at the meat. Holding a piece of meat, she gobbled away.</p>

<p>The meat Han Sen could not even chew was easily torn into pieces by holy angel with her teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;All pets would be winners at eating contests!&#8221; Han Sen was dumbstruck by the way holy angel ate. Momentarily, the little girl had already swallowed a piece of meat taller than Han Sen. Han Sen wondered where the volume went in the belly of the holy angel.</p>

<p>However, the holy angel did not mean to stop. She quickly went to another piece of meat and started to eat.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw the little girl started to grow as she ate the meat of the golden growler. Her hair became longer and chest fuller. Her legs became longer, and a pair of white wings started to grow on her back.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt the little girl looked more and more like the creature she used to be.</p>

<p>Her wings became bigger and her body more curvaceous. Jade armor started to formulate on her body as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy angel! She really had become the holy angel!&#8221; Han Sen was dumbstruck and did not know what to say. After eating a small part of the golden growler meat, the little girl had grown into a woman.</p>

<p>However, the change had not stopped. The holy angel was still bearing her face in the meat. As she ate, the figure of holy angel started to shift again.</p>

<p>Her blonde hair became almost transparent, her white armor became golden, and even her eyes and Halo became pure gold. The holy angel turned into an elegant goddess, covered in a sacred aura.</p>

<p>After eating all the meat of the golden growler, the holy angel turned and walked to Han Sen. She approached Han Sen until their faces met.</p>

<p>Watching the gorgeous yet ice cold face of the beauty, Han Sen was wondering what she wanted to do. All of a sudden, the holy angel held Han Sen&#8217;s face with both hands and covered his mouth with her red lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dammit! I am molested by a pet!&#8221; Han Sen stared his eyes wide, feeling incredulous.</p>

<p>As Han Sen was having complex feelings, he suddenly felt suction from the mouth of the holy angel. She sucked the piece of meat that he just swallowed out from Han Sen&#8217;s stomach.</p>

<p>Holy angel released Han Sen and swallowed the piece of meat, which seemed to make her look more mysterious and pretty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evolution of holy angel complete.&#8221; Han Sen heard the voice in his mind.</p>

<p>Checking the data of holy angel, Han Sen was dazed.</p>

<p>Holy angel: super pet (can further evolve).</p>

<p>Han Sen could understand that the holy angel had evolved into a super creature after eating the meat of the golden growler. However, after she had already become a super pet, the system said she could even evolve further, which was beyond Han Sen&#8217;s comprehension.</p>

<p>Han Sen had never heard that a pet beast soul could evolve twice. In addition, a super pet must be the top being in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. If the holy angel could evolve even further, what would she become?</p>

<p>Watching the innocent girl standing in front of him, Han Sen did not know what to think. After finishing evolution, the holy angel had dismissed her transformed state and become the little girl again, looking at Han Sen with her eyes wide.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked. Technically speaking, a pet could not decide its state for itself. Some intelligent pets could react automatically under emergencies, which was also quite rare and limited.</p>

<p>Dismissing its own transformed state like the holy angel was simply beyond the ability of a pet.</p>

<p>Han Sen regarded the holy angel with his brows knitted and took her back. Fortunately, the beast soul did not resist.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is so strange. I believe it&#8217;s the golden growler. Other super creatures all disappeared after being killed, but the golden growler had edible meat. There must be some mysteries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen did not have any clues.</p>

<p>In Steel Armor Shelter, everyone was talking about the creature and Han Sen. They had never heard about a creature attacking a shelter in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. The fact that Han Sen had chased the creature away made a lot of people in Steel Armor Shelter grateful to him.</p>

<p>Many people in Steel Armor Shelter posted on the Skynet about the issue, giving rise to quite a lot of attention.</p>

<p>The shelters in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary were not built by humans, but a part of the God&#8217;s Sanctuary system. No creatures dared to come close to the shelter before, yet one suddenly attacked a shelter, which naturally made breaking news.</p>

<p>Ning Yue was also reading about the incident. Although there was no picture or video, Ning Yue was paying a lot of attention, especially to the part about Han Sen.</p>

<p>After a long time, Ning Yue turned his device off and asked an old man who looked like a steward, &#8220;Is everyone ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, young master. Everyone is ready, but are you really going to do that?&#8221; The old man asked Ning Yue.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot touch someone from the special squad, especially someone connected to the Qins. If we want to capture him alive, we can only do it in God&#8217;s Sanctuary,&#8221; Ning Yue said casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;But young master, you don&#8217;t need to go yourself…&#8221; The old man said worriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That guy is not an ordinary person,&#8221; Ning Yue said quietly and walked to the teleport device.</p>
