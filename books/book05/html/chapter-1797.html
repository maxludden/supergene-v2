<p>What do you mean?” Han Sen asked, with a frown.</p>
<p>“If you want to live, listen to me and follow my instructions
closely. If you want to die, death can come easily. Just take a
look at the wound on your arm for assurance,” Yisha said
coldly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, and he looked at the wound on his arm.</p>
<p>The tear on the Dongxuan Armor was still there. It was difficult
to recover in that place, but despite that, his wound had already
healed. Han Sen’s healing abilities were remarkable.</p>
<p>He had a xenogeneic body, so he wouldn’t bleed. His healing
abilities were better than the average Viscount’s.</p>
<p>After examining his wound, he determined that his arm was in
good shape. His wound was going to be fine, and there wouldn’t even
be a scar.</p>
<p>But just as Han Sen started to answer her, he felt pain stem
from his wound. Somehow, the mostly-healed skin had come undone. In
a second, the wound had reopened as if he had just been injured. He
almost cried aloud.</p>
<p>Yisha said quietly, “You were hit by my teeth power. If I want
to, I can ensure your body never heals, and any recovery you make
can be broken. I can do this repeatedly until your entire body
breaks. Even if you leave Demon Grave and find a King- class elite
for aid, not even they will be able to break my teeth power. Not
that you could find someone like that, but it would only take two
weeks for me to rip up your whole body.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not respond, but he could definitely feel that his
wound was slowly tearing wider. It was slow, but difficult to
control. It felt like there were a number of teeth in the wound,
digging into his body. He tried to control it, but he could not
stop the skin 什om tearing further and further.</p>
<p>“The only reason it would take me two weeks is because of your
ability not to bleed. If you did bleed, you’d be dead within a
day.” Yisha looked at Han Sen’s wound.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s bloodless wound was a strange sight for her. Her teeth
power could break through flesh and speed up any bleeding process.
Even those who incurred the slightest of wounds would bleed
profusely, but Han Sen hadn’t bled a drop.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face didn’t change, and he asked Yisha, “What do you
want me to do? If you want me to die, you don’t have to say
that”</p>
<p>Yisha sighed and told him emotionlessly, “I need you to do
nothing.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what she meant. She wanted him to stay where
he was, do nothing, and avoid disturbing her.</p>
<p>“If you can stand-still, you won’t disturb my business. We can
avoid a feud, and I promise you that when we leave this place, I
will remove the teeth powers I have inflicted upon you,” Yisha
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen neither agreed nor disagreed, but he did say, “As long
as you’re not putting me in danger, I can abide.”</p>
<p>Yisha frowned. She was not happy with Han Sen’s manner of
promise.</p>
<p>More and more bubbles were appearing in the water, like a large
jacuzzi. The bubbles had lovely acoustics, with their constant
popping. But amongst the many bubbles, Han Sen saw a black bag.
What it was, he did not know.</p>
<p>“Remember what you have told me. Otherwise, you’ll be wishing
you were dead,” Yisha told Han Sen threateningly. She stared at the
black thing in the lake, then, ignoring Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Han Sen looked at it</p>
<p>Yisha ignored him. She continued staring at the lake, as if he
did not exist.</p>
<p>Han Sen, getting ignored, did not speak. He was thinking if
there was some manner of nice treasure down below, he’d like to
steal it.</p>
<p>He didn’t believe the promise Yisha had made him. Once they left
Demon Grave, it was likely she wouldn’t remove the teeth power. It
was possible she’d just kill him.</p>
<p>Yisha took whatever was inside the lake seriously. If he could
steal whatever it was, even if he could not use it himself, it
might work as leverage over Yisha.</p>
<p>Whatever the thing in the water was, it was moving faster. And
it produced a large number of waves. But then, suddenly, it burst
out of the froth of bubbles.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was finally able to see the item, he was
shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen had expected to see something like a fish or a snake. He
wouldn’t even have been surprised if it was a dead body, as
anything could happen in that place.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen saw a scabbard come out of the water, he was
shocked.</p>
<p>It would make sense if it was a blade, as it could easily be
deemed as a treasure of some worth. Or perhaps even a geno armament
like the Northern King Glove.</p>
<p>But it was just a scabbard that jumped out of the lake, minus a
blade it could house. What use would a plain scabbard be for 3 gcno
armgmcnl:”?</p>
<p>The scabbard was black, but it wasn’t a matte color. It was
crystalline, like some sort of black diamond.</p>
<p>The scabbard hopped out of the lake like a fish. It’s movement
looked almost happy.</p>
<p>“What is this scabbard?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>When Yisha continued ignoring him, Han Sen summoned his last
horn arrow. He was going to shoot at the black crystal
scabbard.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Yisha was shocked, and her saw-knife
immediately swung toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen ducked behind his shield and laughed. “I hate being
lonely. If you don’t talk to me, perhaps I will do something weird.
Don’t take it out on me, if I happen to ruin your business
here.”</p>
<p>Yisha’s teeth were getting itchy. If someone like Han Sen had
spoken to her in such a manner outside of Demon Grave, she could
have had him killed a million times over with a mere wag of her
finger.</p>
<p>Rebate Sword Queen was half a god. Even Kings tended to avoid
her. No one had permission to speak to her in such a way.</p>
<p>“When I leave this place, I will kill you.” Yisha was very
angry, but there was nothing she could do. If Han Sen wanted to
ruin her business and steal the scabbard, there was nothing she
could do to stop him.</p>
<p>“What is this scabbard?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Have you heard about the crystallizers? If you haven’t, then
you wouldn’t understand,” Yisha said coldly.</p>
