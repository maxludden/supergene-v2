<h2>Starsea Beast Evolves</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1960</h3>

<p>Little Star was so happy, and it wagged its tail. It stuck out
its tongue and consumed one whole piece of Galaxy Sand. It didn’t
even chew the thing before gulping it down.</p>
<p>“People might think you were a pig. You should at least try to
taste it.” Han Sen looked depressed.</p>
<p>Little Star did not listen to Han Sen, though. It started to
shine, until a strange aura burst out from it.</p>
<p>“Don’t generate geno armor here. Stop!” Han Sen did not expect
that a single grain of Galaxy Sand would force Little Star to
produce its geno armor, so he shouted loudly in surprise.</p>
<p>But Little Star could not control the process. So, Han Sen
brought it to the space tunnel and took it to Planet Eclipse.</p>
<p>Little Star shone with starlight. And then, it generated a
starry set of armor. Without stopping, the star armor melted into a
geno fluid that was absorbed by its body. The generation was
heading into a second cycle.</p>
<p>Little Star’s second evolution was xenogeneic. Its starlight
grew brighter, and it looked like a beast shrouded amid a countless
number of stars.</p>
<p>Little Star finished its evolution, and then put its head next
to Han Sen. It was staring at the box that contained the Galaxy
Sand.</p>
<p>Han Sen hid the box behind him, but Little Star was still
looking at Han Sen with its eyes wide open. It looked as if the
creature was begging.</p>
<p>“I can only give you one more, then. But no more after this!”
Han Sen felt pretty bad about it, but he gave in under Little
Star’s gaze.</p>
<p>Little Star licked Han Sen and swallowed the grain of Galaxy
Sand.</p>
<p>The most shocking thing was that after eating it, Little Star
leveled up once again. It generated starlight power and became a
Viscount.</p>
<p>“Damn! These things are that good?” Han Sen gritted his teeth
and decided to give another one to Little Star. He wanted to see
how much he could level it up. If one level really did equate to
one grain of Galaxy Sand, then that would be wonderful.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s wishes were not fulfilled this time. After Little
Star swallowed the third piece of Galaxy Sand, it did not level up.
The stars around it grew brighter, but that was it.</p>
<p>Little Star looked at Han Sen, but Han Sen did not provide it
with any more. He called Little Angel, Zero, Han Meng’er, and
Dragon Lady. He gave them each a grain of Galaxy Sand, with the
hopes of bringing them up to become Viscounts.</p>
<p>But after they used the Galaxy Sand, none of them became a
Viscount. That surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady said, “Galaxy Sand is powerful, but we have
different elements. We have to refine it well for full-digestion,
otherwise it will be hard to level up.”</p>
<p>The other three nodded and agreed with Dragon Lady. They were in
a similar predicament as her, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen ate one himself, then. The Galaxy Sand dissolved into a
liquid inside his body. The power streamed through this body like a
river.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly cast The Story of Genes to absorb the power of
the Galaxy Sand.</p>
<p>The Story of Genes was really compatible. Han Sen had no trouble
connecting with different elements, so he was able to use the
energy quite effectively.</p>
<p>Galaxy Sand was powerful, and it took Han Sen a few hours to
completely refine the energy he was bestowed. It was difficult to
refine it all. Han Sen gave Little Silver a grain of Galaxy Sand
next, but he was already a Viscount. It didn’t work well on him,
but it did provide him a lot of power to refine slowly.</p>
<p>Luckily, Little Star was a xenogeneic. If anybody asked where it
came from, Han Sen could just say it was from Planet Eclipse.</p>
<p>The tale might seem unlikely, but there were enough xenogeneics
on Planet Eclipse that it would be difficult to prove if the tale
was true or false.</p>
<p>Han Sen took the grains of Galaxy Sand back with him to the
Alliance, and he began refining it one piece per day. He spent his
leftover time learning geno arts and staying with his family.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that due to the fact that there were so many
grains of Galaxy Sand, with each one packing so much energy, the
bounty would eventually bring his The Story of Genes up to Earl
class. After refining half of the lode, though, there had yet to be
a single sign of him leveling up again.</p>
<p>Han Sen was depressed, so he decided to feed Little Star a few
more. Little Star ate ten of them, and eventually, it became an
Earl.</p>
<p>“That is a staggering difference.” Han Sen felt depressed.</p>
<p>He knew Little Star’s element was highly compatible with the
Galaxy Sand, but it really was so much easier for Little Star to
level up compared to him and The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen refined the rest of the Galaxy Sand himself, and when he
was done, he felt himself teetering on the brink of leveling up.
But even so, he couldn’t get that last push to nudge him into Earl
class.</p>
<p>“So many pieces of Galaxy Sand. If I had given them all to
Little Star, it might have become a Marquise.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt bad about his decision, but it was not as if he had
anything better to do. The days he spent holding his daughter and
kissing his wife were great, and Han Sen didn’t worry too much
about things he couldn’t change. Yisha sent a message to his base,
asking for Han Sen to meet her on Planet Blade.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was standing in front of Yisha, she saw that Han
Sen had recovered his human form. She looked startled.</p>
<p>“Since when have you been a human again?” Yisha asked Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“I practiced The Story of Genes every day. Within two months, I
was back in a human state. Unfortunately, I feared there might be
some side effects. So, I planned to practice for a while longer to
make sure I wouldn’t turn back into an ant or something before
telling you.” Han Sen had already prepped this speech
beforehand.</p>
<p>Yisha nodded and said, “I hatched a plan for fixing this, but
since you are already healed, I guess there is no need for it.
Don’t go around telling everybody you are healed, though. And don’t
go drawing any unnecessary attention.”</p>
<p>Yes,” Han Sen said quickly.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Yisha went on to say, “There are too
many spies on Planet Eclipse. Don’t go back just yet. I will send
you to Sky Palace for the time being, and you can study there.”</p>
<p>“Sky Palace?” Han Sen was surprised.</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard this name before. When the crazy crystallizer
opened the gate of the Sanctuaries, Han Sen met a man who said he
owned the throne of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>And Littleflower was almost taken by that man. Luckily, Han Sen
was able to get away in time.</p>
<p>Yisha said, “Sky Palace’s leader is a deified elite. He has a
deep connection with my elder. I used to practice in Sky Palace, as
well. In essence, half of what I was taught came from him. I have
already informed him of your arrival, and so he will assuredly take
care of you.”</p>
<p>“But Queen, I want to study where you are near.” Han Sen looked
sincere as he stared at Yisha.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace had seen Han Sen before. If he was
recognized, things could go bad very quickly ‘You are going there
tomorrow.” Yisha obviously wasn’t interested in a debate.</p>
