    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, you have treated me like a little brother. If you are
      willing to help me, I will treat you with the reverence of a real
      brother.&#8221; Qi Xiuwen looked at Han Sen when he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I said I was willing to help you, would you honestly believe I
      would?&#8221; Han Sen responded, looking calmly back at Qi Xiuwen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I see no reason why I would not believe you. But, I do have
      medicine with me. It is my hope that you will take it.&#8221; Qi Xiuwen
      had no fear of anything. He pulled out a platinum bottle from his
      inner-chest pocket and threw it towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen caught the bottle and opened it. It contained numerous fire
      crystal-looking pills that were about the same size as a pigeon&#8217;s
      eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are these pills?&#8221; Han Sen held one of the pills in his
      hand and looked at it in the light. He noticed the hardened exterior of
      the pill contained a rolling liquid inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a Geno Creation pill. Our Dong Lin contains fantastic
      biological gene technology. This is just one of our products. Once you eat
      it, it can trigger geno mutations. There&#8217;s every chance it could
      make you stronger, but&#8230;&#8221; Qi Xiuwen gave a brief pause. After a
      while, he resumed by saying, &#8220;But there is also the chance your
      genes suffer a snafu of sorts. But don&#8217;t you worry! If you inject
      yourself with a geno stabilizer, you can stabilize the mutant genes. It
      won&#8217;t harm your body. This isn&#8217;t some fresh product that has
      just come out the oven; it&#8217;s mature and has been
      extensively-developed. Nothing will go wrong.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I take this, then that would mean I would have to listen to you
      for the rest of my life.&#8221; Han Sen spoke with a frosty tone as he
      looked at the Geno Creation pill.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I must confess, I wouldn&#8217;t let a character such as yourself
      out of my sight for very long. If I let you leave, my thoughts and dreams
      would be disturbed! That is why I must put you on a leash as soon as I am
      able,&#8221; Qi Xiuwen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You have more than forty evolvers with a fitness level of over one
      hundred, and you have an elite who has unlocked their first gene lock. It
      looks like you have exerted a lot of effort in composing this little posse
      of yours.&#8221; Han Sen looked around the room, observing the faces of
      all who were present.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han is a very powerful person. Such preparations were
      necessary. If I wasn&#8217;t going to stake a claim and take this royal
      shelter for myself, I wouldn&#8217;t have bothered Thunderdevil to come
      all this way.&#8221; Qi Xiuwen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You really think that special little elite in your midst is
      invincible?&#8221; Han Sen went back to stroking his silver fox. He then
      raised his lips in a disdainful smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did you just say &#8216;special little elite&#8217;?! You better
      watch your tone, boy.&#8221; Thunderdevil&#8217;s face now changed as he
      glared fiercely at Han Sen, green electricity crackling all around his
      body.
    </p>

    <p>
      When everyone saw the electricity that swirled, snapped, and crackled
      around Thunderdevil, their hope for a happy ending vanished. This really
      was an elite who had unlocked their first gene lock, and he was no foe to
      be trifled with.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Qi, there is no need to entertain this tiring chit-chat with
      the boy. If he does not quickly agree, then just kill him.&#8221;
      Thunderdevil maintained his gaze on Han Sen while he spoke to Qi Xiuwen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, please consider it.&#8221; Qi Xiuwen was getting
      annoyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s the problem? I was being honest. An elite who has
      unlocked their first gene lock? Am I supposed to be afraid or something?
      You&#8217;re pulling my leg, right? Did you think this clown would
      frighten me?&#8221; Han Sen said, with a frost-bitten tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen said this, everyone&#8217;s faces warped into looks of
      disbelief. No one believed Han Sen would have the audacity to say
      something like that. To show contempt towards an elite of such a high rank
      was near-enough to asking for death.
    </p>

    <p>To call the elite a clown, Han Sen must have lost his mind.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you have a death wish, boy?&#8221; Electricity now swirled madly
      around Thunderdevil, and green bolts of lightning cracked in his eyes. Han
      Sen&#8217;s disrespect seemed to have made him extremely angry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen had not given the order to attack yet, so Thunderdevil stayed
      put.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, if you continue to be so stubborn, then don&#8217;t
      blame me for what happens next.&#8221; Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s face looked
      bleak. He turned to look at Thunderdevil, then nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thunderdevil had already come to dislike Han Sen. He was not accustomed to
      being looked down upon by someone who had not yet unlocked their own first
      gene lock. He thought Han Sen didn&#8217;t know his place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment Qi Xiuwen nodded, fierce shieldings of electricity surrounded
      Thunderdevil. He was wholly consumed by the green aura of airborne fire.
      His hands clutched a long physical bolt of lightning, and threw it like a
      javelin towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the terrifying scene that was now unfolding, everyone took a step
      back to avoid being struck by Thunderdevil&#8217;s thunder and lightning.
      He was so bright, they could not even see Thunderdevil&#8217;s body.
    </p>

    <p>
      All that could be heard was the swirling pressure of crackling static and
      electricity. Han Sen then saw the incoming spear of lightning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This scary power made everyone&#8217;s hearts pound in fear, but it also
      gave them each a modicum of jealousy, wishing they could one day attain
      such talent. All of them desired to one day unlock their first gene lock,
      but realistically, only one in a million was likely to achieve such a
      status.
    </p>

    <p>
      But between their jealousy and frightened emotional state, they thought
      they were going to have to watch Han Sen be slain by the Thunderdevil.
      However, it was at that moment that the silver fox Han Sen had been
      holding leapt into action.
    </p>

    <p>
      A silver cloud of lightning appeared and annihilated the incoming spear of
      green electricity. Then, more thunder snapped the skies apart. Before it
      could finish, it was joined by a chorus of screams.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Thunderdevil, who once struck fear into the hearts of everyone
      present, was now blackened and charred. Then he fell to the floor. There
      were three gouge-marks in his body, wounds that were deep enough to reveal
      his bones. He writhed around on the floor, unable to stand back up.
    </p>

    <p>
      The audience quaked in their boots, in utter disbelief at the sight of
      Thunderdevil squirming around on the ground. When the screaming stopped,
      the Spirit Hall fell silent. Not even the sounds of breathing could be
      heard from the crowd that watched.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;No way. How?!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How can an elite who has unlocked their first gene lock be beaten
      by a little pet fox?!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone was speechless, and their minds were now plagued with a thousand
      different questions over what they had just witnessed. All they could do
      was look at Thunderdevil, who was rolling around on the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The color in Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s face drained, and a chill spiked his heart.
      He could not believe his ace-in-the-hole had been beaten so simply. He was
      an elite who had unlocked his first gene lock, after all.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen picked up the silver fox and stroked him in his arms once more.
      Then he walked up to the ground-bound Thunderdevil and kicked him in front
      of Qi Xiuwen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did I say clown? I&#8217;m sorry; this guy is an insult to clowns.
      Is this who you were relying on?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Qi Xiuwen, who
      now bore a pale face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thunderdevil, who was near Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s feet, was spilling blood from
      his mouth. It looked as if he was on death&#8217;s door.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen and his forty other elites looked absolutely petrified. They did
      not dare to move. The teeth of the audience were chattering, and their
      bodies were shivering in fear and uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen must have thought he was suffering an unrelenting nightmare. He
      had more than forty elites, one of which had unlocked his first gene lock.
      This powerful line-up, that had seemed to dwarf the rest in the hall, now
      seemed like a pitiful joke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, it was ridiculous. Qi Xiuwen had believed he controlled the crushing
      power necessary to subdue any foe that sought to hinder his goals and
      desires. Now, he believed it was ridiculous.
    </p>

    <p>
      This man, who listened to everything and never said no, Qi Xiuwen had
      thought to be stupid. But now, he revered Han Sen like some god. He could
      hardly look at him, and all he could do was shiver in his boots.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was in this moment that Qi Xiuwen realized Han Sen never once took him
      seriously, and that the entire time he had been with him, he must have
      been merely enjoying the comedy. It was as if he had been watching an ant,
      being arrogant and trying to bully others. His behavior had been
      ridiculous and all his plans were childish.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s confidence collapsed and with it, he
      fell to the ground.
