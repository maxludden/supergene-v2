<p>Han Sen looked at the Ghost Bone Mask, and he saw it create a
connection with his simulated Ghost Bone power.</p>
<p>“This Ghost Bone Mask is one of the weaker ones, but gaining its
allegiance in a single month is excellent progress. We still have
time. Practice some more to build confidence with the mask. And…”
Fox Queen turned to point at a different mask. “If you can forge a
connection with this Ghost Bone Mask instead, killing the
xenogeneic should come easy.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the mask Fox Queen was indicating. He used his
Dongxuan Aura and the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine it. It was
indeed the strongest Ghost Bone Mask there. Its powers surpassed
those of the other masks by a substantial margin.</p>
<p>“What makes this Ghost Bone Mask different from the others?” Han
Sen asked, pretending he hadn’t noticed its strength.</p>
<p>Fox Queen said, “They are all half-deified xenogeneic skulls,
but some of the creatures were stronger than others. That Ghost
Bone Mask is made from the skull of a demon of hell. Ghost Bone
spent a lot of time and effort on that one. And I do mean a lot.
Its powers were almost deified. It is the strongest Ghost Bone Mask
here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s just a xenogeneic King that I need to kill.
No matter how strong it is, the power of something half-deified
will surely be enough to kill it. I can just use the mask that I’ve
already claimed.” Han Sen raised his hand toward the Ghost Bone
Mask he had already established a connection with, and the mask
flew over to him. He clutched it in his hands.</p>
<p>Before he had Ghost Bone powers, simply touching the mask had
sent Han Sen shooting back into a wall. Now that he could hold the
mask freely, he could get a real sense of its overwhelming
power.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura and Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a
good look at the mask, then he settled it on his face.</p>
<p>As soon as it touched his face, power surged into Han Sen’s
body. The new energy swelled through Han Sen’s Ghost Bone powers,
increasing their might dramatically.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s face went pale, and worry clenched his
stomach. He wanted to take the mask off, but it was now too late to
do so. A powerful will roared out of the mask and swept inside Han
Sen. It prevented Han Sen from moving a single inch. The Ghost Bone
power was like a tsunami rushing through him. Han Sen’s body turned
black, and a ghostly aura surrounded him.</p>
<p>The will of the mask was demonic, and it felt like everything
around them would fall under its spell. It suppressed Han Sen’s own
will, and it coldly said, “This body isn’t the best, but it’s not
too bad. I suppose I can make use of it.”</p>
<p>“You are General Ghost Bone?” Han Sen had realized whose Ghost
Bone Mask this was. He wasn’t scared, though. He had known there
was something off with the item, and he just hadn’t been able to
determine the precise nature of the issue. At least he knew his
feelings hadn’t been led astray.</p>
<p>Ghost Bone powers kept pumping into Han Sen’s body. General
Ghost Bone’s will leaned on Han Sen’s like a mountain.</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone’s soul was inside Han Sen’s head. “Yes, I am
Ghost Bone King. Thanks to your help, I will now be able to
manifest through your body. If you have something you want to do
before your death, and it isn’t too problematic, I can help you
with it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra to stop simulating the Ghost
Bone power. The Ghost Bone powers that were surging into his body
screeched to a halt.</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone seemed surprised. “You didn’t practice the
Ghost Bone Technique! But even so, you can make use of its power?
That is quite tricky.”</p>
<p>“My body isn’t a Ghost Bone Body, so why do you want to use it?”
Han Sen asked emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“You’re just a Duke, so I can make your body a Ghost Bone Body
with minimal effort. And yes, I am going to make use of your body!”
General Ghost Bone growled, his voice hard. He stopped trying to
suppress Han Sen’s will, but the Ghost Bone power from the Ghost
Bone Mask became stronger.</p>
<p>The black Ghost Bone power settled over Han Sen’s every cell,
and it made his genes look different.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast Jadeskin, and he turned into a jade statue. The
Ghost Bone powers sank into him slowly, but they couldn’t change
the shape of his body.</p>
<p>“You’ve practiced an invincible body? That is very rare!”
General Ghost Bone seemed even more surprised now. His voice
sounded greedy, and the Ghost Bone power from the Ghost Bone Mask
became even stronger.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Jadeskin body was strong, but it couldn’t withstand
the power of General Ghost Bone. The power bearing down on him was
deified. His Jadeskin body began to transform into bone. He was
starting to take on the shape of a black bone statue.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t fight off General Ghost Bone’s power, but at
the same time, General Ghost Bone couldn’t overcome and defeat his
will.</p>
<p>“General Ghost Bone, do you know anything about a town located
in a desert called Ghost Bone Town?” Han Sen asked suddenly.</p>
<p>“You have been there?” General Ghost Bone said.</p>
<p>“The place is called Ghost Bone Town, so why is a statue of you
standing guard before a gate? And who does the statue inside the
palace belong to? Is that the leader of Sacred?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You’re about to die, and this is what you’re spending your
energy on?” General Ghost Bone asked in wonder.</p>
<p>“Well, if I am dying, I don’t want to leave this mortal plane
with unanswered questions,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“I will tell you; it is where the leader was resting,” General
Ghost Bone explained as he continued changing Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>“It’s a mausoleum of some sort? Whose statue is in the palace?
How did he end up there?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone seemed to sneer coldly. “Maybe he deserved
it?”</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone seemed to harbor disdain for the Human King,
but he didn’t say anything about who he actually was.</p>
<p>“Then who is he? And why is his statue there in the palace?” Han
Sen kept asking.</p>
<p>“You are a dead man. You don’t need to know so much!” General
Ghost Bone didn’t want to talk. All he wanted to do was morph Han
Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body turned from black to white. He became a being of
white bone, which looked very strange.</p>
<p>The black bone power was very evil, but now, it turned to white
bone. And it didn’t seem so evil anymore. There was some sunny air
inside him.</p>
<p>“I found a special stone plate inside the palace; do you know
what that is?” Han Sen asked. Han Sen had many questions, and it
seemed as if only General Ghost Bone could give him the answer he
sought.</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone paused. Even the Ghost Bone powers that were
changing Han Sen came to a halt. The question had obviously stunned
General Ghost Bone.</p>
<p>“You found the relic? Why do you have it?” General Ghost Bone
quickly asked.</p>
<p>“I have it with me right now. What is the relic? What does it
do?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Haha! God is helping me right now, for sure. With this relic, I
can access the item located inside that holy monument. My Ghost
Bone era is on its way.” General Ghost Bone laughed like a madman
inside Han Sen’s brain.</p>
