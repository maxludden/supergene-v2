  Han Sen told her about Qin Xiu wanting to break the geno hall and that he had fought him.

Night God No Moon was shocked after hearing the story. She checked him out in greater detail. After a while, she said, “Having evolved to that level, World King God was beaten by you? Your body and power are weird.”

“Are you saying I did not beat Qin Xiu? Did I merely beat his gene race World King God?” Han Sen was pretty suspicious about the claim, but Night God No Moon appeared to be adamant.

“That is what it should have happened,” Night God No Moon quietly said. “At least, that was not all of Qin Xiu. He was human, so how could he have had blue blood? Unless he combined with World King God, his blood wouldn’t have been blue. If he really did combine with World King God, he would not only have those skills.”

Han Sen nodded. He thought Qin Xiu was not as strong as he thought he would have been.

After pausing, Night God No Moon shook her head and said, “The God Spirits have not focused on killing you. This should not be the reason either. Even if you did not defeat World King God, the geno hall would not have been destroyed.” “Why not?” Han Sen asked with shock. This was the first time he had heard this theory.

Night God No Moon asked, “Do you know why the highest class of God Spirits is Reboot?”

“No, I don’t know,” Han Sen replied while shaking his head.

Night God No Moon looked into space and said, “Reboot God Spirits have the power to reboot. That includes the entire universe.”

“What does that mean?” Han Sen’s expression changed. He had guessed this a little, but he had never been too sure. It was way too scary. Night God No Moon lifted her lips and said, “It is just as you said. Let’s compare the universe to the computer. A Reboot God Spirit has the power to restore the system. By doing that, a high price has to be paid. No one knows what happens to the universe after it is rebooted. Perhaps all life is wiped out, or perhaps some old lives can remain. Maybe it is not that bad. Maybe only the universe’s damage is restored, but no one is killed. One thing I know for certain is that if you simply destroyed the geno hall, you could not defeat a Reboot God Spirit.” After hearing that, Han Sen developed a cold sweat. If things were indeed like that, it was way too scary.

Night God No Moon laughed and said, “Don’t worry. Even a Reboot God Spirit cannot pay the price of rebooting. If it is not forced to do so, they will not reboot the universe. Therefore, you helped him defeat World King God. That person in the geno god hall must really appreciate your work, but it would not have been the sole reason for letting you be here as a lawbreaker.”

“Then, why?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

“How am I supposed to know? I am not a Reboot God Spirit.” Night God No Moon rolled her eyes at Han Sen. She suddenly asked, “If you know Han Yufei, do you know a man from the Witch called Tai Yi?”

“I have seen him and spoken to him, but I would not say we are close,” Han Sen said.

“Is… Is he OK?” Night God No Moon’s eyes shimmered. Her cold face seemed to suddenly melt.

“Something is going on there.” Han Sen was smart, so he had noticed something. He was curious about what was going on, but he had to hold it in. He told her about Tai Yi repairing the metal god temple and breaking space.

“Ah! So, he is here… He must be coming for… He did not forget me…” Night God No Moon looked excited. She had looked like a goddess moments before, but she now looked like a giddy teenage girl.

“Are you saying Tai Yi came to the universe of kingdoms?” Han Sen did not believe that. After thinking about it, he thought it might be possible. Only God Spirits and god temples existed between the two worlds. Tai Yi had broken space and left after fixing the god temple. Han Sen thought the metal god temple would go to the geno god hall. From what he understood now, going to the universe of kingdoms was a more likely possibility.

“I am going to go find him.” Night God No Moon no longer cared about Han Sen. She readied herself to leave.

“Hey! Don’t go yet. Let’s chat some more… Don’t you want to chat for another minute?” Han Sen wanted to slap his mouth. He should not have mentioned Tai Yi. Now, Night God No Moon leaving while he had many questions to ask.

“As a reward for telling me about Tai Yi, this is for you. It should help you.” Night God No Moon’s voice echoed from space.

A jade bracelet suddenly fell from the sky. It flew in front of Han Sen. He grabbed it. A wry smile appeared on his face. He saved Night God No Moon from a plum tree. She had not thanked him. Since he mentioned something about Tai Yi, she was now thanking him. She was a very strange character.

Han Sen examined the jade bracelet he had been given. It was like a white jade crystal, but it did not really look like jade. It was unknown what sort of material it was made of.

Han Sen sent some of his power into the jade bracelet. It started to move. A mysterious message was going toward Han Sen. His mind was suddenly imbued with a lot of information.

“The normal and reversed versions of the Cold Sutra.” Han Sen was shocked. The contents inside the jade bracelet were the original Cold Sutra. This was the two-worlds version.

That wasn’t the most important part. In the end, there was a method to combine the two geno arts.

Night God No Moon called this power the break world power. When she had arrived in the universe of kingdoms, she discovered her inability to make use of geno arts. Therefore, she invented the reverse Cold Sutra. When it achieved a certain level, she suddenly thought about breaking the restrictions of the world. She discovered that when she cast a combination of the normal and reverse Cold Sutra, there was a power cast. The break world power could kill a God Spirit, but it was very annoying to practice.

Because the bodies of the people of the universe of kingdoms were not ideal for practicing, and the rules there did not really allow humans to practice, he wanted to practice the Cold Sutra. To do that, he had to find a suitable gene race. After he combined with a gene race, he could practice the Cold Sutra that had been reversed.

Because of that, the gene race determined how powerful the Cold Sutra could be. So, he had to find a top-class gene race that was well-versed in the same element.

Night God No Moon used a gene race. It was a very rare Yin god lady. She had leveled up the Yin god lady to ultimate mode. Therefore, her reverse Cold Sutra was almost as good as Cold Sutra.

“If things are like that, how can I practice the Blood Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra?” Han Sen was confused. After thinking about it, he understood.

His body had the blue-blood genes of the World King God, which was a gene race that came from the anti-material world.

Han Sen thought, “If ordinary and reverse Cold Sutras can produce the break world power, then my normal and reverse Blood-Pulse Sutra should be able to do it too. There is no way Night God No Moon can do it and I can’t.”
