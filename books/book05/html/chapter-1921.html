<h2>Knifemind Shocking the Sky</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1921</h3>

<p>Han Sen lifted his knife. There was no shiny knifelight, no
spiritual glow, but the knifemind was so scary. It felt like a
beast that had come to swallow the sky. It could not be avoided,
and even space above would find itself fractured.</p>
<p>Although it was a wrong feeling, it shocked everyone with awe.
It was a feeling they couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed towards the Tego Earl. He cut through his foe’s
armor and drew a deep cut across his chest. His Teeth power was
buffed by his knifemind, and a purple mist began to envelop the
wound, tearing it wider.</p>
<p>Sword Know’s meteor-like swordlight and another Earl’s spear
came striking at the same time. Han Sen did not move, though. His
Ghost Teeth Knife began whirling up another spiral. He caught the
swordlight inside the circle, and then he threw it towards Rebecca
to slow her down.</p>
<p>At the same time, Han Sen’s left hand grabbed the red mist
spring water. He put it in his mouth and swallowed it.</p>
<p>All these actions were performed in one uninterrupted sequence.
It looked simple and smooth. So many Earls were attacking Han Sen,
but he made it look like he was shooing off a bunch of kids.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” Flower King’s eyes were open wide as he stared
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t just generate a normal Teeth Knife knifemind. His
knifemind was growing quickly, becoming something greater than
usual. Even Flower King, who had lived for a thousand years, had
not seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King and Night River King looked at Han Sen, but
remained speechless.</p>
<p>Three months of a major gambit had been reduced to a joke. Han
Sen had only taken one and a half months to develop a terrifying
knifemind. The most talented Dukes had taken several years to make
a remotely similar amount of progress.</p>
<p>Yisha’s eyes looked bright as she watched. What she was
thinking, though, you could not tell.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen cut Sword Know’s arm off as he grabbed another glob of
spring water and shoved it into his mouth.</p>
<p>Everything was so seamless. If Sword Know and the others weren’t
the ones being subjected to this treatment, they’d undoubtedly have
praised the marvelous performance. All they could feel now, though,
was shock.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable for a Baron to use sword skills like that,
even if he was being slightly buffed by the treasures he used.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on fighting, swallowing the orbs of spring water as
he went. He had consumed at least ten of them, and he used Yin Yang
Change to convert them into power. His energy and Spell armor began
to turn red and give off a strange mist. He looked so very
weird.</p>
<p>Rebecca and the others did not want to retreat in such a state.
They used all the power they could muster to fight Han Sen, but it
meant naught. They still couldn’t keep up, and they hadn’t been
able to claim a single drop of water for themselves. Han Sen had
taken them all.</p>
<p>The storage capacity of that particular red mist spring was
beyond anyone’s wildest expectations. It was still releasing spring
water.</p>
<p>“Huh, so what? Even if he does have tremendous skill, he has
swallowed at least one hundred red mist spring water drops. Even if
he was a bug, he should have been able to become a Viscount a few
times over by now, but he hasn’t yet leveled up. How does he expect
to level up? I don’t even think this guy will even be able to
become a Duke,” Night River King said, as he coldly looked upon Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King sighed. He greatly favored Han Sen, but what
Night River King said was true. Even a minuscule insect should have
become a Viscount by now, but Han Sen had not. His ascendance
required far too many resources.</p>
<p>If it was that difficult for him to become a Viscount, it would
be even harder for him to level up and hit loftier tiers. Even if
Yisha was willing to keep growing him, the chances of Han Sen ever
becoming a King were super low.</p>
<p>“It is a shame. To have such talent and yet be shackled with a
geno art and body such as that.” Moon Wheel King sighed. He felt
very sorry for the lad.</p>
<p>Flower King looked at Han Sen with admiration. He sighed and
said, “It does not matter how good his skills are; if he cannot
attain a higher level, it is all for naught. Thirteen spring water
drops could create ten Viscounts. And yet, he has not leveled up. I
don’t think he will ever be a King.”</p>
<p>The red mist inside Han Sen’s body was getting thicker and
thicker, and it was as if it was getting hacked at by blades. But
his Spell armor remained quiet, and it wasn’t releasing any energy
at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept fighting and drinking all the water he could grab.
The spring continued to erupt and supply him with drops. Everyone
thought each glob of water would be the last, but their
expectations were shattered by the emergence of another—each and
every time.</p>
<p>When Han Sen had swallowed seventeen or eighteen globs, the
spring’s eye began throwing out even more water.</p>
<p>“How many xenogeneics were killed here in ancient times to
produce such a large quantity of water beneath the surface?”
Black-Moon King said in wonder.</p>
<p>Night River King’s eyebrows kept on twitching. Han Sen had
swallowed so much spring water, and he found himself having
difficulty holding back. He had thought the spring water would have
emptied by now, so he had held himself back each time.</p>
<p>But every time he thought of that, more water came out. Right
now, the twentieth glob of spring water was emerging.</p>
<p>Night River King was now full of regret. He regretted not making
a move of his own any sooner. He could have grabbed at least ten
water drops. Now, all of the spring water was inside Han Sen’s
belly, and he could not even produce a fart. It was a waste of a
rare material.</p>
<p>When the spring erupted again, Night River King finally couldn’t
keep himself restrained. He did not care if there was any more
spring water coming or not; he was going to make a move. If he
didn’t, he believed his heart would be buried by dust—and that
would affect his training.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King and the others were shocked. If a red mist
spring produced one hundred water drops, it was considered very
large. This spring had produced almost two hundred, and it was
still going.</p>
<p>The scariest thing was that Han Sen had swallowed so much of
that water, and yet he had not become a Viscount.</p>
<p>Sword Know’s eyebrows jumped, as if he had just heard something.
His face changed, but he decided to spit out some blood and jump
towards Han Sen like a bloody arrow.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed towards the blood arrow and cut it open. But
inside the blood arrow was a red bug which continued flying towards
Han Sen. It was so small and so fast that it hit Han Sen’s
forehead, even with his Spell helmet on.</p>
<p>As this occurred, the spring’s eye was shining bright. A red
light came out of the red spring, but this time, it was not water.
It was a red soul.</p>
<p>“The red mist soul!” All the Kings screamed.</p>
<p>But before they could do anything, Han Sen grabbed the soul and
swallowed it.</p>
