<h2>Officer Mutation</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1734</h3>

<p>Little Angel and Golden Growler ran towards the officer. With
one hand, though, he was able to latch onto Little Angel’s sword.
His other hand grabbed Golden Growler’s face.</p>
<p>His hand bit into the angelic sword, while Golden Growler was
sent flying away with missing chunks of flesh.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and Stay Up Late attacked the officer, but nothing
they tried worked. The officer’s powers were too much, and they far
exceeded what should have been possible inside the parameters of
the sanctuary. The scary presence was something tangible, in
itself.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The black vortex in the sky became bigger. The dragon-like
talons were emerging from the pit. The body of a monster began to
emerge.</p>
<p>It had red eyes and it was covered with scales. The creature was
rank with the smell of blood, and only seeing half of the beast was
scary enough.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>The beast loosed a murderous roar. It generated a shockwave
across the galaxy, breaking meteors. The planet itself was
damaged.</p>
<p>“We can’t let that thing in! Although the sanctuary has its own
protocol and system to kick that being out, it’ll take a little
time. And that monster will only require one hit to wipe out the
entire Alliance,” Stay Up Late said.</p>
<p>“How do we stop it?” Gu Qingcheng looked glum. She was wounded,
but she was still standing.</p>
<p>“We have to kill him and close the gate.” Stay Up Late gritted
his teeth.</p>
<p>“Of course we will!” Xie Qing King’s silver light surrounded his
fists. He discharged it against the officer, but the armor was able
to swallow it. The attack didn’t yield any damage at all.</p>
<p>The crystal shoes brought Ji Yanran into the air, throwing a
kick against the officer.</p>
<p>The officer swung his hand and blocked the attack of the crystal
shoes. The mouths on the armor were able to bite right into the
crystal armor, ripping out a whole glistening chunk.</p>
<p>The officer punched towards Ji Yanran’s belly, but all of a
sudden, there was a golden light. A small fist blocked the strike.
It was Bao’er, clad in her geno armor.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Both of their powers exploded against each other, sending
everyone rolling away.</p>
<p>The officer looked at Bao’er in shock, as his armor was unable
to consume or eat anything of hers. Bao’er looked very angry, too.
The godlight across her kept flaring as she punched the
officer.</p>
<p>The officer’s own fists repeatedly dashed their way across
Bao’er’s armor, and the constant shockwaves prohibited everyone
else from getting close.</p>
<p>“It’s too late! That thing is getting out!” Gu Qingcheng saw
that the monster in the sky was pulling free of the vortex.</p>
<p>Pushing back the pain she was now suffering, she called out to
the others.</p>
<p>An energy current stormed through the galaxy. Trails of
electricity were everywhere, affecting all the nearby planets.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>There was a loud noise, and Bao’er’s body fell, creating a big
hole in the ground.</p>
<p>Bao’er was still in the shape of a baby, and she couldn’t fight
the officer.</p>
<p>This time, the officer’s body experienced a big, new change. An
eye opened in the center of his forehead. Horns grew from his head
as his body became wrapped in scales.</p>
<p>He had spliced his own genes with genes from the outside. His
body was evolving into another race. He was no longer a
crystallizer.</p>
<p>After getting rid of Bao’er, though, he followed after her. He
turned to look at Littleflower, and he moved so quickly, Stay Up
Late could not react.</p>
<p>Littleflower’s light was still shining across the entire
kindergarten, with his little body hovering in mid-air. He didn’t
fall back, though, and he tried using his holy light to stop the
kidnapper.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The officer broke through the holy light, ready to grab
Littleflower.</p>
<p>But a bloodlight suddenly appeared, and it stabbed the officer.
Zero flew past him, grabbing Littleflower as she sped off.</p>
<p>The Bone Dagger that she had used to stab the officer was
swiftly consumed, though. And he hastily tried to turn and punch
Zero. His fist was so strong and fast that it was far more than she
was capable of evading, and she was struck in the back. She held
onto Littleflower, though, as she came crashing into a building. It
kicked up a storm of dust.</p>
<p>The officer wanted to give chase, but Stay Up Late had caught up
with him. Still, whether or not the officer could be stopped was
another matter entirely.</p>
<p>However, as the officer stood in front of the ruin, he stopped.
He didn’t go inside to take Littleflower.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng looked towards the ruins and noticed a scary
presence bleeding out from the rubble. A red light came bursting
forth like water.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The red light was like a volcano, and it laid waste to the
ruins. Zero was holding Littleflower in the midst of the rubble.
The red light was streaming from her back.</p>
<p>The officer squinted his eyes as he looked at Zero. He suddenly
dashed before her and unleashed a strike, targetting her head.</p>
<p>But Zero merely stood where she was, with the red light shining
on her back. It looked as if she might have been unable to move.
The red light had almost reached her head, and still, she showed no
reaction.</p>
<p>Inside Mister Tiger’s training room, swordlights kept on
flashing.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger was very depressed. His strength and speed should
have been better than Han Sen’s, but his sword could not even send
a ripple through Han Sen’s clothes. Reaching past Han Sen’s sword
was an impossibility, it seemed.</p>
<p>“You want to fight?” Mister Tiger looked annoyed and threw his
sword on the ground. He thought he might have been going crazy.</p>
<p>Han Sen placed his practice sword back on the shelf. After
fighting with Mister Tiger, he had learned some interesting things
about the skills that the Kate had developed for combat.</p>
<p>The combat skills of Nobles like Mister Tiger were not strong.
Han Sen looked like a superstar master next to them. His only
disadvantage was that his body was weaker, as things currently
stood.</p>
<p>“It’s almost time. I should get going.” Han Sen packed up his
stuff, ready to leave.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger jumped in front of Han Sen and said, “I must say,
Brother; your sword skills are obscene, but… I like them. Do you
take students? I can be your student, so that you can teach
me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Mister Tiger in shock. The Noble looked like a
powerful and confident person, and Han Sen had never expected that
he’d be so interested in Han Sen’s combat sword skills.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in being a teacher, but I sure like money.
How much would you be willing to pay, if I were to teach you?” Han
Sen said. And it was true—he really did need money!</p>
<p>“If it’s money that you need, then that is of no concern.”
Mister Tiger was very happy.</p>
