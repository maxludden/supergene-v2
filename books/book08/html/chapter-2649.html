<h2>Meeting at the Lake</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2649</h3>

<p>Han Sen looked at the thick stack of yellow papers he had
amassed. He wanted to cry. Those pornographic pictures he had
fished up over the past few days were enough to compose an entire
book. Aside from the yellow papers, he hadn’t been able to catch
anything.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that,” he reminded himself. “These pictures look kind
of like a comic.”</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Bao’er being there, Han Sen would have liked to
examine them in greater depth.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Bao’er. Her experience fishing had been
very different. She had managed to earn all sorts of things.
Although they weren’t all deified treasures, the things she had
collected were all better than the yellow papers Han Sen had
received.</p>
<p>“It looks like my luck hasn’t been too good in recent times.
Perhaps I should ask Mister White to calculate my fortunes and find
a way to heighten my luck,” Han Sen thought, considering various
ways he might improve his situation.</p>
<p>Just as it was Bao’er’s turn to fish, the small jade figure
reacted. Han Sen quickly pulled Bao’er away and sat down on the
lakeshore himself, pretending to be in the middle of fishing.</p>
<p>Not long later, Exquisite teleported there.</p>
<p>Exquisite walked over to Han Sen and looked at him. She didn’t
see anything next to Han Sen, and she said, “Don’t worry.
Underworld Lake is often like this. Sometimes it can take a couple
of days to get something, other times it can take weeks. I asked
you to come here to test your luck and give you some time to
practice geno arts.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Hearing Exquisite, it sounded as if it was
supposed to take a number of days to fish something out. But he had
always received something in half a day, at the most. The shortest
time it had taken those two to fish something out was half an hour.
The average, if he had to guess, was two to three hours.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been trying to think of a way to show Exquisite
those yellow papers, but he didn’t have to do that anymore.</p>
<p>“It looks like there are no resources I can use for practice
here,” Han Sen said, looking at Exquisite.</p>
<p>Underworld Lake was magical, but he couldn’t stay here if he was
only pulling out old pieces of paper. He would rather kill
xenogeneics.</p>
<p>“Don’t rush anything just yet. Recently, my little sister has
needed my help. I don’t have the time to take you hunting. So,
continue practicing here. If you have enough luck, maybe Underworld
Lake will give you a pleasant surprise,” Exquisite said with a
smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen might have just been imagining things, but he noticed
that when she spoke to him—even though she was still reserved—she
tended to smile more and more. She was different from how she used
to be.</p>
<p>“There was a surprise, but the surprise was so big, I wasn’t
sure how to take it,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>After a brief conversation with Han Sen, Exquisite quickly
walked away. She left a few items behind for Han Sen to live off,
and she also provided him with vials of geno fluid.</p>
<p>Han Sen had actually brought his own, but he had forgotten to
tell her.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled a parasol out of Destiny’s Tower, and he also
brought out a couple of sunbathing chairs. Han Sen and Bao’er
settled themselves down comfortably on the shores of the lake to
fish. As they did so, Han Sen also set aside some time to research
the geno arts he had been given.</p>
<p>The geno fluids Exquisite had brought him weren’t bad. They were
good for his body, but Han Sen had yet to find a way to make a
breakthrough that would enable him to become half-deified.</p>
<p>After another couple of days, Han Sen gave up fishing. He let
Bao’er do things herself. He focused on practicing his geno
arts.</p>
<p>Part of the reason he had given up was because he had continued
to receive pieces of paper. It was pointless for him to continue.
Whenever Bao’er fished, she would retrieve something encrusted in
jewels. Each item was ornately wrought and beautifully
finished.</p>
<p>But aside from the enormous gold sword and the hair clip, Bao’er
hadn’t gotten any more deified treasures. Clearly, deified
treasures weren’t easily found.</p>
<p>Since Bao’er had already been able to get two, though, that was
still a fantastic result.</p>
<p>Not everything she fished up was a high-level treasure. There
were a few ordinary items in there. But whether they were
high-class or low-class items, they all looked sovereignly
luxurious.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s eyes flashed. He picked up Bao’er and pulled
the Underworld Silk away from her.</p>
<p>A minute later, he saw someone approach. It was Second Brother
Liyu Zhen, the man that Han Sen had met when he first entered Outer
Sky.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen saw Han Sen and Bao’er behaving as if they were having
a vacation, lying down on their sunbathing chairs with a parasol.
There were many snacks and drinks on a table beside them. There was
even a nuclear reactor mini-fridge. The sight made him frown.</p>
<p>“Exquisite brought you here to practice, not to have a
vacation,” Liyu Zhen said coldly.</p>
<p>“What has it got to do with you?” Han Sen continued to lounge on
the sunbathing chair. He didn’t get up, and he didn’t even spare
the other man a glance.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen’s face looked cold. He stared at Han Sen for a while.
Without saying another word, he went to the other side of the lake.
He pulled out an Underworld Silk from his head of hair. It looked
as if he had come there to fish, as well.</p>
<p>If most people of another race spoke to Liyu Zhen like that, he
would have reacted poorly. But Han Sen was already Exquisite’s
silkworm. There was nothing he could do to Han Sen; that was one of
the Very High’s established rules. Even if a silkworm committed a
crime, it was the master of the silkworm that had to deal with
it.</p>
<p>If Liyu Zhen fought Han Sen there, he wouldn’t simply be
fighting Han Sen. He would be humiliating Exquisite. That was why
Liyu Zhen didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>With Liyu Zhen being there, though, Han Sen couldn’t allow
Bao’er to fish for him. So, he fished on his own the whole
time.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s situation was still mostly the same, though. He still
reclined in his sunbathing chair. He tied the Underworld Silk to
his finger, so he could sense movement the moment it happened.</p>
<p>Han Sen then turned his attention back to reading through the
geno arts. He didn’t have to look at his line, though. He knew it
was only a matter of time before he received another yellow piece
of paper.</p>
<p>Of course, an hour later, something pulled at his line. He
pulled it out of the mist, revealing another sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen glanced over when he saw that Han Sen had received
something. It was just an old piece of paper, though, so he ignored
Han Sen and carried on fishing.With Liyu Zhen being there, Han Sen
felt uncomfortable. When there was no one, Exquisite could not feel
him, and he was able to do anything he wanted to.</p>
<p>If he disobeyed Exquisite’s wishes while someone was there to
tattle on him, however, he could risk getting into trouble.</p>
<p>Plus, Liyu Zhen had seen what Han Sen had pulled out of the
lake. Now, he could no longer hide what he had retrieved. If
Exquisite wanted to read the pages, he would have to let her see
them.</p>
<p>“What is this guy doing here?” Han Sen couldn’t think of a way
to get the man to leave, and he couldn’t leave himself. He had to
continue fishing.</p>
<p>After half the day, Liyu Zhen felt as if something was amiss. In
that short period of time, Han Sen had pulled three things out of
the lake. They all looked like old sheets of paper. Han Sen was
operating at a remarkably efficient catch rate.</p>
<p>When Han Sen pulled out his third piece of paper, Liyu Zhen put
away his Underworld Silk and walked in front of Han Sen to look at
the other man’s catch.</p>
<p>“Let me see those papers.”</p>
