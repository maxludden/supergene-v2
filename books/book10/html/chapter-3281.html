<p>A big electric storm was brewing in the space around them. All
kinds of colors flowed, veiling the sky.</p>
<p>A ship crew member ran into the room. He looked shocked as he
shouted, “Mister, this is bad! We have encountered a giant magnetic
storm! The ship is losing control!”</p>
<p>Before he finished his words, the ship’s lights turned off. The
ship was dark. They then felt the ship go sideways.</p>
<p>Normally, a ship had a gravity system. Even if the ship flipped,
a place like a cabin would still enable them to keep their balance.
The gravity wouldn’t be changed.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt that the ship was sliding. It meant the ship had a
big problem. The gravity was no longer working.</p>
<p>The light was quickly in their eyes again. Outside the ship, the
magnetic storm was so bright that it was like a window. The
colorful lights went past the crystal-like windows. The inside of
the ship was now a vibrant shade of hues. They were so bright that
people could be blinded.</p>
<p>No matter if it was darkness or strong light, Han Sen would not
lose his vision. Through the crystal windows, Han Sen saw the light
substance was a creature. It looked like a god dragon. Its body was
traveling between the substances, but it showed a part of its
body.</p>
<p>“Break World beast.” Han Sen saw the creature’s presence and
recognized what it was.</p>
<p>“It is coming in fast.” Sky King frowned. He thought he had lost
the one tailing him and would have had more time. He did not expect
a Break World beast to come back so quickly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just begun. Half of his presence had yet to be
cut off.</p>
<p>“Let’s just run.” Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to shield the
ship. He wanted to use Galaxy Teleportation alongside the entire
ship.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly noticed that the space there was weird. It was
like it was being cut by some strange power. He could not
teleport.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er’s body displayed some weird notes. Her wings spread
as she let out a roar. The sonic sound shook the storm away, but
there were still a lot of storms raging around them.</p>
<p>“Roar!” A dragon’s moan pierced the universe. It went against
Zhao Ning’er’s voice, making her voice weaker.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er raised her eyebrows. She prepared to use her asking
heart sounds. Before she spoke, the substance storm started to
fade. The ship drove away from the substance storm, but they were
no longer in the same system. They had entered a place that had
weapons in every direction.</p>
<p>“Soldier Knife Sky!” Han Sen and Sky King’s faces changed. The
whole ship had been taken to the first of the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others saw the weapon forest from above. There
was a giant, dragon-looking creature hanging there. Its body was
wreathed in electricity, and it glowed with a strange rainbow hue.
The substance storm must have been created by that creature.</p>
<p>The draconic creature’s head looked like a monster. It had long,
red hair and three eyes. Its body was inside a shell. It looked
like a man, but it was not a man. It looked like a bug, but it was
not a bug.</p>
<p>The weird man stood atop the rainbow god dragon’s head. He
strangely said, “Han Sen, there is a way to heaven you are not
walking on. Hell does not have a door, but you are knocking. To be
an enemy of the God Chaos Party makes you a very dead man. Do you
know how dead you are?”</p>
<p>“Ning’er, protect Qiu Yi and the ship.” Han Sen flashed away and
flew out of the ship.</p>
<p>“I am going with you!” Sky King flashed and went into the
sky.</p>
<p>“So, do you mind telling me what your name? And, if you would be
so kind, which position do you hold in the God Chaos Party that you
serve?” Han Sen did not start fighting just yet. He merely asked
the weird man those questions.</p>
<p>The rainbow god dragon was a Break World beast, but the weird
man was not a Break World beast.</p>
<p>“I am God Chaos Party’s leader’s Shoot Shadow,” the weird man
proudly answered. “Why are you blocking my way?” Han Sen asked with
a smile. He smiled like an innocent bystander.</p>
<p>“Hmph! If it was not for our leader having a big belly, he would
have dealt with you already. You should have died a long time ago.
Now, you have been interfering in the God Chaos Party’s testing
scheme. We will not permit you to live a second later. Go and die!”
Shoot Shadow spoke very grimly. He touched the rainbow god dragon’s
dragon horns.</p>
<p>The rainbow god dragon rolled up its body. The rainbow-like
substance went everywhere across the land. Han Sen could no longer
see.</p>
<p>Sky King looked cold. His body had a weird power arise, but he
did not go to attack the substance that was everywhere.</p>
<p>While Han Sen wondered what Sky King was going to do, many
weapons suddenly started to moan.</p>
<p>In the next second, countless weapons broke space and arose.
They did so like rain in reverse. They came up from the ground,
ripping the substance in the sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the sky, which was full of weapons no matter
where one looked. He was given a shock. These were the Soldier
Knife Sky weapons. The place had countless weapons available for
Sky King and they exploded with scary power. They kept striking the
substance storm.</p>
<p>Many weapons were destroyed by the substances, but more weapons
broke space and came for them. It was like their stream was
endless. The substance storm became weaker.</p>
<p>“Sky King can control Soldier Knife Sky’s gene weapon gene
races.” Han Sen felt weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen helped Zhao Ning’er escape the clutch of the God Chaos
Party. The God Chaos Party had yet to do anything but touch Sky
King’s life soul. The God Chaos Party immediately sent an old
leader and a Break World beast after him. That meant Sky King had
to be important to the God Chaos Party. He was likely more
important than Zhao Ning’er.</p>
<p>Sky King was able to control the weapons that populated Soldier
Knife Sky. It made Han Sen wonder whether or not Sky King’s soul
was special.</p>
<p>In his past life, he was one of the eight generals of Ancient
Devil. His identity was shocking. He might have even had a
connection to the 33 skies. If that was not the case, it would be
hard to explain how Sky King had the ability to control the weapon
gene races that populated Soldier Knife Sky. In his past life, his
strongest power was called 33 sky power. The chances were slim for
that to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>The substance storm was gone. The rainbow god dragon and Shoot
Shadow’s body showed up again.</p>
<p>“You do not have what it takes to kill us yet. If you want to
kill us, you’d best go and ask Qin Xiu for help.” Sky King looked
at Shoot Shadow.</p>
<p>Countless weapons were aimed at Shoot Shadow and the rainbow god
dragon. It seemed that if Sky King used his mind, he could tear
their bodies to shreds.</p>
<p>Shoot Shadow was not afraid at all. It was like he knew this was
going to happen.</p>
<p>“Lin Jin, I am afraid you have become cocky way too soon,” Shoot
Shadow coldly said. He suddenly held the rainbow god dragon’s head.
He looked evil and weirdly screamed, “Come on! Light Stream, let
them witness your true Break World beast power!”</p>
<p>With the roaring sounds of Shoot Shadow, the rainbow god
dragon’s body flashed. It turned into a light-stream dragon spear
that was in Shoot Shadow’s hands.</p>
