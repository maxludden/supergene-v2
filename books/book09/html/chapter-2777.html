<h3>Chapter 2777</h3>

<p>“What happened to the Flower Gods? Is there any way in which I
can help?” Extreme King Prince Bai Wanjie quickly said.</p>
<p>He had just become deified not too long ago. He was only
primitive, so he definitely wasn’t the highest-ranking deified that
was present. Far from it. He was a crown prince of the Extreme
King, however. He was one of the most qualified emissaries who had
come to this meeting.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern, crown prince. Our race needs a
favor. I want to invite you all to enter the Space Garden so that
you can help my people.” A stunned silence descended over the
meeting.</p>
<p>The Flower Gods had never let outsiders into the Space Garden.
They wanted to keep it for themselves. People only knew that the
Space Garden was full of high-level geno fluid resources. As for
what it looked like inside, hardly anyone other than the Flower
Gods had ever seen it.</p>
<p>Across history, only a few outsiders had been allowed to enter
the Space Garden, and they were very close with the Flowers Gods.
But the elites who had come to this meeting barely had any
connection to the Flower Gods. Despite the fact that they were
practically strangers, the Flower Gods were inviting them all to
spend time in the Space Garden. The whole situation was quite
strange.</p>
<p>Violet seemed to know that everyone would think of this as
suspicious, and so he quickly said, “The talents of my people
aren’t the only reason that we are able to create such unique geno
fluids. The primary reason, in truth, is that the Space Garden
provides us access to resources not available to any other race.
Therefore, no one has been able to copy the geno fluids that we
make.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that something has happened to the resources
that you use to create your products?” Dragon One asked Violet,
tilting his head to one side.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, everyone thought what Dragon One said made
sense. If there wasn’t some issue with the resources of the Space
Garden, Violet wouldn’t be speaking so openly about the secrets of
the Flower Gods.</p>
<p>Violet nodded and said, “There is a very serious problem, and if
we do not sort this out, I’m afraid the Flower Gods will no longer
be able to create the special high-class geno fluids that we are
famous for.”</p>
<p>“What is the problem? You can tell us. There are many elites
here, and even the Extreme King’s crown prince. We can help you,”
Dia Robber said.</p>
<p>“Yes. We will find a way to help you—together. We will not allow
the geno fluids of the Flower Gods to go extinct. That would be a
great loss for the entire universe.” Everyone was trying to show
earnest support.</p>
<p>But more than anything, they just wanted to learn the secrets of
the geno fluids. They were only offering aid because of the
benefits they would receive. No one would help the Flower Gods for
no reason.</p>
<p>Violet sighed and said, “I really want to tell you all so that
we can sort out this problem quickly, but this information is a
matter of national security to the Flower Gods. The leader has
commanded us not to tell anyone. Otherwise, we could be
exiled.”</p>
<p>“Violet, what is that supposed to mean? You asked us to come
here, but now you’re not telling us anything. In that case, how are
we supposed to help?” demanded a deified elite with a short
temper.</p>
<p>Violet’s face looked glum. He sighed and said, “The Flower Gods
would like all of you to come to the Space Garden to help our race.
But before you enter the Space Garden, I cannot tell you what is
going on there. I know this is rude, but we have no choice. What is
happening is too important for my people, and so we cannot risk
leaking our secrets.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t telling us anything, and yet you want our help? How
are we supposed to know if we can help?” Bai Wanjie said.</p>
<p>“We know this is very awkward for everyone involved, and if you
don’t want to enter, we won’t try to force you. We would rather let
our resources be destroyed than allow our secrets to become public
knowledge,” Violet said.</p>
<p>“What you’re saying doesn’t make sense. Even if you don’t tell
us now, we will still learn your secrets once we go in.”</p>
<p>“Yes. So, you must tell us now. And then, when we go, we will
find a way.”</p>
<p>But no matter what people said, Violet was stalwart. He wasn’t
going to give them a single detail.</p>
<p>“There’s really no point in continuing this conversation. If you
really want to help us, our race will pay you back. We will do
everything in our power to return the favor. If you aren’t willing
to help, then that is also fine. But right now, this situation is
an urgent one. I need to return to the Space Garden with haste.
Anyone who is willing to help us can journey to the Space Garden
with me now. Otherwise, we will part ways here and hope that we can
meet again someday.”</p>
<p>Everyone was talking quietly amongst themselves. They had never
expected something like this to occur.</p>
<p>But quickly, someone spoke up, agreeing to help the Flower Gods
despite the lack of information. The person walked over to join
Violet.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Xie Qing King looked at each other. They seemed to
know this was how things were going to be. Everyone was interested
in the secrets of the Flower Gods. Otherwise, they never would have
come in the first place. Now, there was a chance for everyone here
to see the secrets with their own two eyes. No one would miss out
on a chance like this.</p>
<p>Even if there was a conspiracy at play, the Flower Gods were a
small race. They didn’t have any deified elites to wreak serious
harm upon the elites that had gathered here. The Flower Gods
depended on the Space Garden and the geno fluids they produced.
That was their only claim to fame. The elites who had come to this
meeting were mostly deifieds, so they weren’t afraid of anything
the Flower Gods might do.</p>
<p>Even if the Flower Gods were planning something devious, the
elites believed that their powers would be enough to escape
whatever mischief might befall them.</p>
<p>“Are we going?” Han Sen asked Xie Qing King.</p>
<p>“Since we are already here, it isn’t like we can simply leave.
Let’s follow and have a peek, so we can see what our future
territory might look like.” Xie Qing King shrugged his shoulders as
he spoke.</p>
<p>“You are right.” Han Sen nodded. But now, he was playing the
role of Xie Qing King’s subordinate. He couldn’t speak out of turn,
and so he had to let Xie Qing King do the talking.</p>
<p>Violet wasn’t turning anyone away. He was more than happy to
accept anyone who was willing to go to the Space Garden with him.
Kings and deifieds alike were joining the crowd that was preparing
to leave.</p>
<p>Before they headed out, Violet told them that the trip would be
a very dangerous one. They needed to think this through carefully
and make sure that they wished to come.</p>
<p>However, in the end, every elite that had come to the meeting
decided to follow Violet. They all entered the Flower Gods’
battleship and left the planet that belonged to the Thousand
Treasures.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Xie Qing King were inside, as well. Because there
was a mix of high races and low races, it was a real melting pot.
All that diversity also meant that Xie Qing King and Han Sen didn’t
stand out too much.</p>
<p>As Han Sen and Xie Qing King were getting a bite to eat in the
battleship’s restaurant, Dia Robber approached. He seemed excited
to see Xie Qing King. “Are you the author of Overbearing President
Love Luv Looove, Teacher Xie?”</p>
<p>“I am Xie Qing.” Xie Qing King had gotten used to this sort of
thing happening. He smiled amiably as he spoke.</p>
<p>“It really is Mr. Xie! This is great. I have finally met Teacher
Xie. I am a big fan of your comics…” Dia Robber passionately
grabbed Xie Qing King by the hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen was frozen. Dia Robber was the future of the Destroyed.
He was a guy who could kill people with a wave of his hand. He was
also a fan of Xie Qing King. It was hard for Han Sen to wrap his
mind around.</p>
<p>“Is this guy for real?” Han Sen wondered. He never would have
thought that someone like Dia Robber would like comics. The
Destroyed was probably just looking for an excuse to get close to
Xie Qing King.</p>
<p>“Teacher Xie, can I have your signature?” Dia Robber asked,
whipping out a pen and paper and holding them out so that Xie Qing
King could jot down his signature.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Xie Qing King said in a friendly tone. He grabbed
the pen and started to write his signature. He wrote his name like
a dragon and a phoenix that were flying together.</p>
<p>Why did his signature look like a dragon and a phoenix dancing?
Han Sen couldn’t tell what words they were supposed to be, or if
they were even words at all. They were jumbled and looked
conjoined. No one could have read what Xie Qing King had
written.</p>
<p>Dia Robber looked as if he had found a treasure. He took it very
seriously and carefully hid the notepad back within his
clothing.</p>
