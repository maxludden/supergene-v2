    <p>
      Han Sen himself was surprised. Although he had seen Luo Haitang in
      Godslayer Shelter, he hadn’t agreed to any of the man’s requests or given
      him anything. So, why would the old man send a gift? It seemed as if he
      really wanted to re-establish a connection with Luolan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But given Luolan’s personality, Han Sen knew what Luo Haitang might have
      been like. It had been many years since he saw her, and there had been no
      texting or form of communication in the meantime. If he’d really wanted to
      send her something, he’d had plenty of time to do it. It wouldn’t have had
      to be that day, of all days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had sent something, it obviously had something to do with him
      having just met Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mom, I didn’t do anything for him. I didn’t agree to anything.” Han Sen
      went on to relay the story of how he encountered Luo Haitang.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You dodged his palm?” Luolan looked at Han Sen with wide open eyes. She
      looked as if she was in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t learn the Falsified-Sky Sutra, either. But you know that I knew
      about it and what to expect. Is there something wrong with the fact that I
      managed to dodge it?” Han Sen didn’t think there was a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, there’s nothing wrong. You did a great job.” Luolan was very happy to
      hear this. She put her fingers on Han Sen’s cheek and rubbed it. “My good
      son, you really did a great job.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What does that mean?” Han Sen looked confused, not entirely sure what had
      just happened. He had very rarely seen her this happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing. It’s just good, that’s all.” Luolan smiled and left, not really
      answering Han Sen’s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen rested at home for another two days before returning to the
      sanctuary. When he got back, he went directly to Gu Qingcheng’s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to knock on the door to her chamber, he heard Gu
      Qingcheng’s voice say, “Come in, the door isn’t locked.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen lightly pushed the door open. Gu Qingcheng was in front of a
      table, drawing with an old pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen learned about what she was doing in a history lesson; it was
      calligraphy. She was using a brush pen, a tool devised by ancient humans
      to write. They weren’t really used anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few that still existed were typically used by artists for a few odd
      tasks. He hadn’t expected Gu Qingcheng to be the sort to love them like
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t very good with art, but he could tell that she must have
      had a lot of practice to draw with the level of talent she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng lowered her pen. She took a moment to admire her own artwork
      before asking, “Why were you looking for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen smiled and then said, “I met someone who told me some wild things
      about you. I don’t know if he was a liar, so I’d like to ask you for the
      truth about these things he said about you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh? What did he say about me?” Gu Qingcheng looked at Han Sen as if her
      curiosity had been piqued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had already established how he’d approach this conversation in his
      mind. Now, he smiled and said, “He said you killed Cruel Chi. Is that true
      or false?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng frowned and said, “Maybe. I don’t remember. I have killed
      many creatures in my lifetime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cruel Chi was a famous demigod super creature. If you killed one such as
      that, you wouldn’t have forgotten, would you?” Han Sen didn’t believe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I really did just forget. Why would I lie about this?” Gu Qingcheng said,
      with lifted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought that if Gu Qingcheng wanted to lie, she would have just
      said a simple yes or no. He couldn’t quite tell from the answer he was
      given.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s okay if you don’t remember that. He said a lot of other things. He
      said you drank the pee of a Jade Beast to avoid dying of thirst out in the
      desert and…” Han Sen was going to say a few similar statements, but before
      he could finish speaking the first, Gu Qingcheng’s face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible! No one knew about that. How would you know?” Gu Qingcheng
      stared at Han Sen as if she had seen a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You really did this? Then did you hide inside the Hunting Sky Beast’s egg
      and end up getting sat on by the Hunting Sky Beast for an entire month?”
      Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible! No one should know about this. Who did you hear it from?” Gu
      Qingcheng’s face changed. She ran in front of him and grabbed him by the
      sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I said I met someone, didn’t I? He told me these things, saying that he
      saw you commit these acts. I thought he was lying. I had no idea he was
      telling me the truth.” Han Sen was both surprised and happy. He was now
      sure Gu Qingcheng was the Number 4 in the diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible! When I did these things, humans did not even know what a
      steamer was. Who could have seen me?” Gu Qingcheng looked annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen froze. His eyes opened wide as he looked at her, and he said,
      “Steamer? That is something from ancient times. Were you in the sanctuary
      all the way back then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen couldn’t believe what he was hearing, but Gu Qingcheng had
      unwittingly proved what he wished to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng frowned as she stared at him. She said, “You are right. I am
      from that era. I was in the sanctuary even during ancient times. Tell me
      who told you this stuff. When I did these things, humans could not appear
      in the sanctuaries. They shouldn’t have been able to see me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No way. Back then, there were no teleporters. There weren’t even
      generators. How were you able to enter the sanctuary? You’re joking,
      right?” Han Sen heard every word, but he found it hard to believe.
    </p>
    <p>“Does it look like I am joking?” Gu Qingcheng said coldly.</p>
    <p>
      “But that is not right. Even if you entered the shelter, that would have
      been at least ten thousand years ago. Even as a demigod, your
      few-hundred-year lifespan should have long been over. How have you lived
      for so long?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng had admitted to something quite strange. He didn’t believe
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t care if you believe it or not. I only want you to tell me who
      told you this stuff.” Gu Qingcheng’s face looked dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chill had run down her spine. The things she had done were something no
      other human could have seen. The things Han Sen spoke of were events she
      believed no one else would know about. Spirits and creatures couldn’t have
      known, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Han Sen had said this, it spooked her quite a bit. If someone
      knew about these things, then it meant someone had been watching her in
      ancient times and even up until now. This was a pretty scary thing to
      learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there a way for you to prove to me you hail from ancient times?” Han
      Sen saw that she wasn’t actually joking. He had a number of different
      questions he wished to ask her.
    </p>
    <p>First</p>
    <p>ninth</p>
    <p>
      “It doesn’t matter if I can or not. If you don’t believe me, just pretend
      I’m not. But just tell me who told you these things.” Gu Qingcheng knew
      Han Sen, and she knew it couldn’t have been Han Sen who saw those events.
      Someone must have told him. So, Gu Qingcheng had no reason to be
      suspicious about what he had told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m not sure. I met someone, but I don’t know anything about him. I never
      saw him again, after that.” Han Sen didn’t know who the person was, so he
      couldn’t tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng frowned and looked at Han Sen. She didn’t believe what he
      said. After all, why would some random stranger tell him such stories?
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen kept talking about things that didn’t matter, now wanting to slip
      away. He had at least confirmed that Gu Qingcheng was the elusive Number
      4.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Gu Qingcheng was a human that had been in the sanctuaries in
      ancient times, like she had just told him, how did she enter? And how was
      she still alive after all that time had passed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something else confused Han Sen, too. If Number 4 was a number the
      observer had just written down, did that mean the other numbers were
      humans, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      If they were humans, how were the numbers decided? If the numbers were
      given by order of entry into the sanctuaries, then that meant three had
      already come before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, this was all just guesswork. The numbers might not have even
      represented humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can leave, but you need to explain things to me first.” Gu Qingcheng
      raced to the door and blocked the exit, prohibiting Han Sen from leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng. He thought what she said was fairly
      believable. When he first met her, he thought she was strange. He never
      thought she fit into this world, anyway. The name Gu Qingcheng itself was
      something rather old fashioned. It wasn’t a modern human name, at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And some of her behavior flat-out made Han Sen feel strange. She was both
      mysterious and hauntingly beautiful, and that in itself was odd. Her being
      different might have been something to expect, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he thought about it, Gu Qingcheng didn’t look like a modern
      human, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can tell you what you want to know, but first, I need you to tell me
      who you are,” Han Sen said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you already. You’re the one who chose not to believe me,” Gu
      Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Even if I did believe you are an ancient human, you should have a
      historical identity. Back then, humans were separated by countries. Which
      country did you hail from? What did you do before?” What Han Sen wanted to
      know the most was how she had managed to enter the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid that by asking her directly, he wouldn’t receive an answer.
      First, he had to test the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng looked at Han Sen with strange doubt, but answered, “I am
      from the Chu State. I am a Qi Gong Caster.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Qi Gong Caster? Which faction did you belong to?” Han Sen asked politely.
    </p>
    <p>“That’s none of your business,” Gu Qingcheng answered.</p>
    <p>“How did you get into the sanctuary?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “If I answer this question, you will have to tell me who told you all that
      stuff.” Gu Qingcheng looked right at Han Sen when she said this.
    </p>
    <p>“Okay, it’s a deal,” Han Sen agreed.</p>
    <p>
      With no hesitation, Gu Qingcheng said, “I am from Chu State, but I
      practiced at sea. Once, when I returned to land in my boat, a weird vortex
      appeared. I fell into it, and when I came to, I was in the sanctuary.”
    </p>
    <p>“Which planet was the vortex on? And where?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “That’s pointless information. I left the sanctuary many times to search
      for the vortex, but I learned nothing. I have even used powerful
      submarines to search underwater. All I’ve found are ordinary seas and
      nothing else special,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen nodded. “According to what you have said, if you are from Chu
      State, it has been tens of thousands of years. How have you managed to
      live so long?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you. I have answered your original question, and now it is your
      turn to answer mine. Answer my question; who told you this stuff?” Gu
      Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen pulled out a book and showed it to her. It wasn’t the diary he
      found in the control room, though. It was a copy he had made. The Number 4
      sections were there, while he had left the original at home.
    </p>
    <p>This was why Han Sen did not go see her immediately.</p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng took the book and opened it with confusion. After seeing it,
      her face changed. She flipped through the book really quickly and soon
      looked ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who is this person?” Gu Qingcheng closed the book and stared at Han Sen.
      She looked very angry, and goosebumps ran up and down her skin after
      having read all the complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what she asked, it looked as if something she never thought would be
      known had now been exposed for all to see. She felt naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know the writer, but I copied it from a book I found in God’s
      Ruin.” Han Sen went on to tell her what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng wasn’t too convinced with the tale, though. She stared at him
      for a good long while. She wanted to find the truth from his face, but she
      was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If what you’re saying is true, there must be more numbers. There has to
      be another three, at least,” Gu Qingcheng said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but there isn’t much about them. Just two sentences. You were the
      focus of the record.” Han Sen smiled.
    </p>
    <p>“Let me see the other parts.” Gu Qingcheng reached out her hand.</p>
    <p>
      “Okay, but you need to tell me how you’ve managed to live all this time.”
      Han Sen blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng did not hesitate, and it looked as if she had just thought of
      something. She had to confirm her thoughts and said, “I had been here for
      a dozen years when I explored God’s Ruin. I entered a strange place and
      got trapped there. It felt like a short time, maybe a few months. But when
      I came out, the teleporters in the shelters that were previously not
      available for use, now were functional. I used one of them to leave the
      sanctuary, and then I learned that tens of thousands of years had passed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, Gu Qingcheng then thought of something quite upsetting. She
      looked darkly at Han Sen and said, “Not long after I returned to the
      Alliance, I met your liar. I met your great-grandfather.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could imagine what would happen if a person displaced from the
      ancient past met a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The place you went to; were there many crystal machines?” Han Sen asked.
