<p>The Guardian Spiders did not look as if they could spin silk,
but the claws on the ends of their legs were sharper than any
knife. Not even the armor of a Marquise fighter could withstand
blows from those.</p>
<p>When the red spider emerged from the statue’s mouth, it flew
towards the battlers in an instant. Six of its blade-like
appendages came swiping down towards the intruders.</p>
<p>Yuya commanded the fighters to split up and scatter a little,
and once clear of the spider’s attack, they closed back in to
surround the arachnid. They lifted their swords and struck the
spider in perfect sync. But it was to no avail, as their swords
simply bounced off with a loud clanging noise. They couldn’t even
scratch its body.</p>
<p>“That big guy has to be a Duke!” Yunyi shouted.</p>
<p>Yuya nodded in agreement, then drew his own sword. Yunyi then
ordered all of the Sky Palace students to strike a single spot on
the spider. All their powers came against the creature like a rapid
river. The target they had selected was its mouth. They managed to
break its jaw, and when that occurred, the spider fell to the
ground.</p>
<p>After a few more attacks, Han Sen and the others managed to
bring an end to the wicked fiend. Because of their formation,
however, Han Sen was unable to get in the last hit.</p>
<p>After the red spider died, no more Guardian Spiders emerged to
attack them. They quickly mopped up the last of the Guardian
Spiders on the field.</p>
<p>No one from Sky Palace was injured, but a few more of the Demon
had gotten torn up. Furthermore, it was Sky Palace that took care
of the red spider.</p>
<p>“It looks like I need to hurry up and bring Ning Yue here. I
hope that he can develop here,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Weird. With the power of the three races working together to
kill the spiders, this should not have been that hard. Why are
there loads of dead Buddhas and Dragons here, and why wasn’t there
a single dead spider amongst them upon our entry?” Yunyi looked
over one of the spider bodies and frowned.</p>
<p>“It’s because we didn’t touch the spiders.” A voice resonated
across the path from someplace at the back of the palace. Dragon
Eight appeared with a few of the Dragon and Buddha in tow. There
was no sign of the Destroyed, however.</p>
<p>Things suddenly became very tense. The Sky Palace students
readied themselves for a fight, but the Buddha and the Dragons all
seemed injured. There had been some serious fighting, from the
looks of things.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. We are not your enemies now,” Dragon Nine said
from behind Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>“Dragon Eight, what do you mean?” Kahn couldn’t see Dragon Nine,
and so he asked Dragon Eight.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight cdmly said, “The Destroyed tricked us. They were
familiar with this place already, and they knew some o its secrets.
They lured us to dangerous parts of the city and got many of us
killed. The Destroyed then went deeper into the palace, and we have
no idea what they are trying to accomplish.”</p>
<p>“Amitabha! And whatever it is they are planning, it doesn’t look
good to us. The Destroyed don’t seem to want us to get out of here
alive and let others know what transpired here,” a Buddha Marquise
said.</p>
<p>“Are you saying the giant city is in some way related to the
Destroyed? I thought the Breakskies were the original inhabitants,”
Kahn said skeptically.</p>
<p>“When we reached the back of the palace, we came across a statue
with three heads and six arms. It was the exact depiction of the
Destroyed. If our assumptions are correct, the Destroyed might once
have been part of the Breakskies,” Dragon Eight said.</p>
<p>“If that’s true, then we’re in serious trouble. We cannot leave
the planet, and the Destroyed will try to kill us all in order to
keep their secrets. They aren’t going to let us leave,” Yunyi
said.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange voice boomed through the hall. “You guys are
right! Don’t even think about getting out alive. Since you’re here,
why not die here?”</p>
<p>The voice startled everyone. They looked around for a minute
before they realized that it was actually the statue that was
talking.</p>
<p>As the metal statue spoke, its body began to move. The statue
was previously in a sitting position, but when it stood up, its
head broke through the ceiling. It swung a fist and cleared away
half of the roof.</p>
<p>Seeing the giant fist continuing down towards them, everyone
moved to evade it. But the fist wasn’t the real threat; when the
roof above them was broken open, the dragonfly-looking xenogeneics
swarmed down through the opening.</p>
<p>The entire place fell into chaos. The metal statue punched a few
more times, and the palace was almost entirely demolished.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others tried slashing the metal statue, but the
attacks barely scratched it. They decided to fall back from the
palace through the cracks that had formed. But there were many
dragonfly xenogeneics buzzing through the air now, and that made
their escape more difficult.</p>
<p>While they were sprinting away, more explosions came from the
ruins. Many giant metal statues rose out of the destruction and
turned in their direction. Han Sen noticed that one of the metal
statues was at least a thousand meters tall. It had three heads and
six arms, and it looked exactly like a Destroyed.</p>
<p>The four races were all in extreme danger. The metal xenogeneics
hounded them relentlessly. The metal statues were scary, too, as
their strength was equivalent to a King.</p>
<p>The metal statue that chased Han Sen opened its mouth wide and
spat out fire like a geyser of hell’s flames.</p>
<p>Not too far away, there was an extra-evil looking blue giant A
godlight shone from its chest, casting a fifty-meter-long beam that
destroyed everything that it touched.</p>
<p>The other giants released their own powers. Their eyes were
shining red, and they were all headed for Han Sen and the
others.</p>
<p>The teams all started to feel their hope dwindle. Although there
were many strong Marquises around them, at the end of the day, they
were just Marquises. They could not fight the giant metal
statues.</p>
<p>Plus, there were metal dragonfly xenogeneics all about. They
wouldn’t even have a chance to escape.</p>
<p>“Come over here!” Han Sen realized that fighting would be
useless, so he quickly gathered all the Sky Palace people to him.
Yuya echoed Han Sen’s command to all the members through the
swordmark, in case they did not hear Han Sen’s voice amidst the
chaos.</p>
<p>Many of the Sky Palace students came to Han Sen. When Kahn saw
this, he brought his few remaining Demons over as well.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight and the Buddha followed, too. They tightened their
formation and annihilated the nearby dragonfly xenogeneics, but
that hellfire-like power was on its way, and many other powers were
coming for them, too. Escaping seemed impossible.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The metal statue’s fire engulfed them, but it did not incinerate
them. Instead, a blue Bai Sema suddenly appeared. Han Sen and his
people were inside it, shielded from the scary fires.</p>
<p>When the fire touched the blue Bai Sema, the fire shattered. And
then, the power of the other statues hit the Bai Sema. They exerted
all their strength, but it was for naught. They could not break the
Bai Sema.</p>
<p>A dozen scary metal statues surrounded them. They loomed over
the Bai Sema like hungry demons, staring at Han Sen and the other
Marquises inside.</p>
