<h2>A Man With Three Options</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2549</h3>

<p>Han Sen was still falling when the armored man’s hands reached
out and wrapped around his head, gripping him firmly. Purple air
rose from the hands in streams that flowed like venomous snakes,
and they drilled through Han Sen’s body. The purple air bound him,
preventing him from moving.</p>
<p>When they saw the armored man grab Han Sen, Elysian Moon and Gu
Qingcheng were in shock. Gu Qingcheng’s heart leaped into her
throat. She lifted her hands, and thousands of old swords appeared
around her. They went soaring over to strike the armored man.</p>
<p>Gleaming blades rained down like a waterfall. Even a planet
would be riddled with holes after weathering a storm of those
blades.</p>
<p>But the armored man was able to hold Han Sen with one hand and
use the other hand to punch through the swordstream that was all
around him. The power of that punch flew all the way back to Gu
Qingcheng, but it was stopped by the sudden appearance of Elysian
Moon’s umbrella shield.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>That punch broke the swordlight that her umbrella had formed.
The armored man gathered strength in his fist again, preparing to
attack Gu Qingcheng once more.</p>
<p>“Stop! How dare you be so rude to those two girls. Go back!” Ji
Yang Sheng shouted. He had arrived just in time, riding a robotic
demon wolf. The armored man lowered its fist and retreated.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m so late and ended up scaring you, girls.” Ji Yang
Sheng smiled at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>“So you were the one behind all this,” Elysian Moon said, giving
Ji Yang Sheng an icy stare.</p>
<p>“Of course not. I’m just here doing what is right of me to do.”
Ji Yang Sheng looked at the armored man holding Han Sen. He smiled
and said, “Teacher Han, we meet again. You should have the time to
talk to me now, yes?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ji, I don’t think you have gauged my personality
correctly.” Han Sen was being held firmly by the armored man.
Purple smoke covered him, and he couldn’t even move his fingers.
His face remained impassive, though.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Ji Yang Sheng looked at Han Sen with
interest. He looked like a cat playing with a mouse.</p>
<p>“Sir, just in case, we should take Han Sen to our core area
base,” the Demon King said.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “He is right. I have a very bad
temper. You better do it quick; otherwise, you won’t have the
chance.”</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng ignored the Demon King. His face took on an
expression that looked something like a smile, but it was far too
toothy and feral to be pleasant. He said, “Oh, Han Sen; you are
quite powerful. Even under these conditions, you manage to stay so
calm. But you are under the Sky Demon Lock. You are certainly
stronger than a mere King, but not even a deified elite could break
the Sky Demon Lock.”</p>
<p>After that, Ji Yang Sheng turned away, ignoring Han Sen. He
directed his attention to Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon. “These two
girls can be privileged guests of my family. Please don’t worry.
You guys are VIPs. The Demon will never think of bringing harm to
the two of you. We will treat you very nicely.”</p>
<p>Before Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon could answer, Han Sen
laughed. “I was wondering why you were doing this to me. It’s
because you want the two of them? If you had told me sooner, I
would have given them to you. Why go to all this hassle?”</p>
<p>“Shut up! I thought you were quite the character, but I can’t
believe you are so obscene. How could you say something like that
just as a desperate attempt to survive?” Ji Yang Sheng shouted at
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. “I’m just telling you the truth. They are very
pretty, but they’re actually insatiable monsters. They’d eat your
flesh right down to the bones. I’ve suffered so much following
them. I will be very happy if you take them away from me. I will
build an altar in your honor, and I will praise you every night. I
will treat you like a savior,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Huh, whatever you say. You cannot escape this.” Ji Yang Sheng
seemed to know what Han Sen was trying to say. It made him laugh
coldly.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and sighed. “Mr. Ji, you’re being rather
cocky, but we’re only in this situation because of someone else’s
work. If it wasn’t for that scary guy in armor, you would be unable
to defeat me. You have nothing to be cocky about. It should be that
guy there who is cocky.”</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng smiled and said, “He is my Demon Doll. He only
moves when I move. If you cannot beat my Demon Doll, you aren’t
qualified to fight me.”</p>
<p>“Demon Doll? He isn’t an actual Demon?” Han Sen pretended to be
surprised.</p>
<p>“Sir, let’s go back to base now.” The Demon King from earlier
stopped Han Sen and Ji Yang Sheng’s conversation. He didn’t want
the prince to leak details about the Demon Doll.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng wasn’t stupid, though; he knew what was going on.
He laughed and said, “Han Sen, stop wasting our time. I won’t kill
you. If you behave during your time with the Demon, we will treat
you well.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean? Can you define ‘behaving’ for me? Do you
want to milk me like a cow? Do you want me to eat grass while you
squeeze my udders? You want me to make your sons and grandsons fat
and full? You want me to die miserably when there’s nothing left to
give?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“It is nothing like that. If you work, you will be rewarded. If
you have this kind of power, you should do things to better the
lives of others in this world.”</p>
<p>After that, Ji Yang Sheng spoke to Gu Qingcheng and Elysian
Moon. “Ladies, please. You both will be my VIPs forever. No matter
where you go, no one will dare hurt you. But if you both don’t want
to be my friends, I can’t promise you this.”</p>
<p>Elysian Moon was always cold, but now she suddenly laughed. She
was so pretty that she looked like a moon palace fairy. But her
face looked as untouchable as a marble sculpture. When she laughed,
it was like a flower opening amidst the snowfall. It was so
beautiful. It was like realizing the world was alive after
believing it to be dead.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng and the other demons were frozen. They were
thinking, “This woman is unbelievably pretty.”</p>
<p>Elysian Moon laughed and said happily, “We would like to go with
you, but I’m afraid someone else might not.”</p>
<p>“Who won’t?” Ji Yang Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“Him,” Elysian Moon said, looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng chuckled darkly. “Mr. Han is in danger. Even if he
doesn’t want you to come with us, he has no say in the matter. He
doesn’t even have a say in what happens to him. He will be coming
with us, so we can all go together, too. So what if he doesn’t want
to?”</p>
<p>Elysian Moon shook her head. “It looks like you don’t understand
him at all.”</p>
<p>“Do I need to understand him?” Ji Yang Shen said cockily.</p>
<p>“If you understood him, you would know he is a suspicious,
cunning, insidious, and cruel person. He doesn’t place trust in
anyone aside from himself. He always has a backup plan. Even when
he is on the brink of doom, he has an escape route planned and
ready to go. If I were you, I wouldn’t be hanging around here to
chat. I would chop his head off and grind him into pieces. Then I
would burn those pieces until there was nothing left but ash,”
Elysian Moon said in a serious voice.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng was shocked. He looked at Han Sen. The man’s body
was still wrapped in the toxic snake-like purple air, and the sight
made Ji Yang Sheng relax and smile again. “You think too much. He
is under the thumb of the Sky Demon Lock. Not even a deified elite
could escape this. No matter how evil he is, getting out of this
trap is impossible.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen’s voice asked.</p>
<p>“When…” Before Ji Yang Sheng could speak again, his face grew
pale.</p>
<p>The purple mist still surrounded Han Sen, but his body looked
like a rainbow. The Sky Demon Lock was melting within that
light.</p>
