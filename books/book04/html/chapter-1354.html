    <p>
      When the chef heard Han Sen’s question, she stared at him but did not
      speak a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the serrated edge of the horn, Han Sen dug a little deeper into her
      throat. The shredded skin of her neck began to ooze droplets of blood,
      which rolled down to her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t try my patience!” Han Sen feigned anger and impatience for any
      resistance she might give.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then kill me, if that is what you wish.” The chef spoke with a chilling
      tone, without a single hint of her words being a bluff. She was not afraid
      of dying in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen still hoped to extract information; he wanted whatever
      she might have known about Han Jinzhi. Killing her was the last thing he
      wished to do, for this very reason, and this reason alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to soften his tone and try to insert a touch of friendliness
      into his approach, and so he told her, “I only want to about your relation
      to Han Jinzhi. If you answer, and tell me what I want to know, you are
      free to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But her mouth remained firmly shut, prompting Han Sen to elaborate on the
      specifics of what he ultimately wished to ask. He said, “I want to know if
      you’re a friend or foe of Han Jinzhi.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We… hate each other. We hate each other very much. You are clearly an
      ally or thrall of his, so stop talking.” The chef spoke with a tone that
      was laden with spite and disdain, and her eyes drilled holes into the
      young man in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the man before the bark door of the underground shelter’s entrance was
      a follower of Han Jinzhi, what she said now suggested that she might have
      killed him herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the chef speak with a muzzled rage, it looked like Han Jinzhi must
      have done something awful to her.
    </p>
    <p>“Why do you think I’m with him?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>“You two share the same race,” the chef said.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen smiled and said with a laugh, “Oh, you’ve misunderstood things a
      great deal! We are humans, yes, but our race has a grander population than
      even you lot, if I were to wager. That doesn’t mean we’re all the same,
      though. So, what makes you think I’m a friend of Han Jinzhi?” Han Sen did
      his best to explain things as simply as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef looked at Han Sen with confusion, and she stuttered to ask, “Is
      what you say true?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll be honest with you; I’m not a friend of Han Jinzhi. In fact, I am
      his enemy. If you dislike Han Jinzhi as much as your behavior suggests you
      do, then you and I have a common goal.” Han Sen put his horn away and put
      on an expression of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Han Sen continued to heal her wounds before touching her once more
      with the egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You really do have a bone to pick with Han Jinzhi, too?” the chef asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen brought her over to a nearby tree to resume the healing, and as he
      touched her wounds, he said, “If I was a friend of his, you’d be dead
      right now. I risked life and limb to save you; you know that, don’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef examined her own body, and although the healing was a fairly slow
      process, she could tell she was improving.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been hurt badly, and Han Sen’s holy light was still very weak.
      Because of this, it’d take a long time for Han Sen to finish healing her
      completely. But Han Sen stayed with her and kept on healing her. They
      spoke about many things, but in their chatting, Han Sen didn’t ask
      anything too concerning or serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen had tried to be hard and firm with her, she did not give him
      what he wanted. Now, he was going to do his best to be soft and fair. If
      he behaved that way, perhaps she’d be more willing to open up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent the next few days together, and over the course of that time,
      the chef continued to receive swell treatment, in addition to other
      kindnesses Han Sen was willing to impart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why were you trying to kill me, can I ask? I know I took the head of that
      cow, but was that the sole reason that you came after me?” The tension
      between the two seemed to have dissipated now, so Han Sen thought it was
      the best time to ask about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef, by this point, had fully recovered. And she knew she was
      stronger than Han Sen, too. For him to ask this, it was obvious he had no
      grudge against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef said, “You and Han Jinzhi look like one-and-the-same; that is why
      I wished to kill you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you see many humans in the Third God’s Sanctuary? There should have
      been a few in every shelter,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>The chef then said, “Han Jinzhi was the only human I ever saw.”</p>
    <p>
      “Then, how did you two become enemies?” Han Sen pushed his luck to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef did not answer him directly, and she instead said, “Come. I will
      help you hunt some creatures, so you can improve. Consider it me paying
      you back. Then, we’ll be even.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s no need to do that, but since we both hate Han Jinzhi, we should
      share what we know. We can help each other like that, but if you’re busy,
      feel free to move along,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was going to act this nice for as long as he could, in the hopes
      that when she departed, absence would make her heart grow fonder. If all
      went according to plan, perhaps the next time they encountered each other,
      she’d be more willing to share what she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef seemed to feel guilty about not doing anything to return the
      favor, though. She said, “You just became a demigod. It is dangerous for
      you to be left alone out here. If you want, I can get you residence inside
      my shelter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s a shelter in these parts?” Han Sen was shocked to hear this. If
      there were spirit shelters nearby, he’d be in considerable danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef went on to explain, “There is a silver-class shelter, owned by a
      primitive creature. If you offer it resources of value, I see no reason
      why you would not be allowed to stay there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen immediately agreed. If he was still allowed to return to the
      Alliance, and he was in no danger of being enslaved, he saw no problem
      with it. In fact, it would be a fairly amazing deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef then led Han Sen to the shelter. It was a distance away, so the
      journey was long. At the midpoint of their travel, they encountered a
      sheep. It was the Cheap Sheep that Han Sen had developed a love-hate
      relationship with.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, Boss Number One and Boss Number Two! I have found you both.” The
      sheep looked giddy with excitement.
