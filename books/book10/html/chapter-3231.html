<p>The Break World powers in the geno universe were much harder to
achieve than they were in the universe of kingdoms. Mister Bai’s
ability to muster Break World powers there was not just a testament
to his talent and prowess.</p>
<p>“The geno universe has a Break World person. If the 33 skies are
broken through, it is not as if we will be unable to fight back
against the invaders.” Han Sen was not worried about the Break
World elites. Qin Xiu and Wan’er were the ones he feared. He viewed
them as the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Wan’er had not yet achieved Break World powers, but her reverse
Super God Spirit mode was scarier than any Break World person could
be.</p>
<p>There was no need to even mention Qin Xiu, as he had already
achieved breakthrough powers over a billion years ago. On top of
all that, he controlled the black crystal armor. He easily
suppressed Bury Path God, so it was unlikely anyone in the universe
could beat him.</p>
<p>Even the God Hall Leader, who was a Reboot God Spirit, might not
be able to suppress Qin Xiu unless if he used his reboot power.</p>
<p>The most important thing about all of this, and what concerned
Han Sen the most, was that he couldn’t see Qin Xiu’s endgame. He
didn’t know what he was thinking. The God Chaos Party wanted to
break through the 33 skies. They wanted to mess up the rules
between the two universes to create more Break World elites. By
doing so, they could make the God Chaos Party stronger and end up
replacing the God Spirits and their lofty geno hall.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu used to travel between the two universes. He did that to
revive Wan’er. Now, Wan’er had been revived. Han Sen did not know
why he still wanted to break through the 33 skies. He did not know
if Qin Xiu’s coming was good or bad for the geno universe.</p>
<p>Back in the sanctuaries, Ji Yanran made a dish. She put down
four sets of chopsticks and waited for the others to come.</p>
<p>In a state of shock, Han Sen asked Ji Yanran, “How did you know
I was coming back?”</p>
<p>Ji Yanran lifted her good-looking nose. She looked like she was
smiling, but she was not smiling at Han Sen. “Over the past few
years, I have been learning the teachings of Xuan Men. Although I
am not finished, I can feel the Sky Mind inside it. Today, I felt
something. I sensed you might be coming back, so I decided to make
the food you usually like. I did not actually expect you guys to
come back here. This is the first time my feelings were this
accurate.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the food on the table. It was the food he and
Littleflower loved, and Ling’er’s favorite dessert was there
too.</p>
<p>“It looks like your path along the teachings of Xuan Men has
really begun,” Han Sen said with shock.</p>
<p>Xuan Men was easy to learn but hard to get started with. To
understand what was in there, and to also be able to use it, so
rare.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been teaching Xuan Men to others in the geno
universe for many years. There had yet to be another person thus
far to learn it and use it as well as Mister Bai.</p>
<p>He did not expect Ji Yanran had such talent, and she was only a
beginner with it.</p>
<p>“I only know a little bit of stuff, but that is because you guys
are all the most important things in my life,” Ji Yanran gleefully
said. “That is why the feeling was so accurate. Before, there was a
90% chance that my guesses would be incorrect. After getting this
right, I do feel like I understand more. Maybe I have got my foot
in the door on learning Xuan Men good and proper.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about something else. “If she has really learned
the teachings of Xuan Men, that means she can predict
everything.”</p>
<p>Knowing that his wife was able to see the future sometime down
the line, he felt weird. He thought everything he one day did would
be peeped on.</p>
<p>“Cough! Cough! Xuan Men is very complicated,” Han Sen quickly
said. “You cannot learn it fast. I think your talent has you
capable of learning many geno arts. Why don’t I teach you some geno
arts instead? You can learn that first, then you can go to the geno
universe with me so we can see each other more.”</p>
<p>Ji Yanran shook her head. “I am already pushing the boundaries
of this. The alliance universe is small, but the knowledge in the
alliance universe is the same as the geno universe. Everywhere is
the same.”</p>
<p>“Wife, that is wrong. Although you can learn Xuan Men anywhere,
the geno universe has me and Littleflower in it. If you and Ling’er
went there, you and I can always be together.” Han Sen blinked and
asked Ling’er, “Don’t you think so, Ling’er?” “Mother, you should
go! If I stay here, I rarely see Littleflower and Dad. If I go
there, I won’t see you anymore, Mother.” Ling’er shook Ji Yanran’s
arms as she spoke. “Fine,” Ji Yanran said with a nod.</p>
<p>“My wife is so smart. Later, I will teach you some geno arts so
you can go to the geno universe sooner.” Han Sen was secretly very
happy about it.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran rolled her eyes at him. It looked like she was
smiling, but she was not smiling at Han Sen. “Do not think I have
no idea what is going on in your mind. I am going to the geno
universe, but I am also going to continue learning Xuan Men.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt like Ji Yanran’s eyes were seeing through
something, so he tried to explain things to her. “Cough! Cough! I
am not thinking of anything. Xuan Men is a big path skill. Of
course, you are going to have to learn it. The Xuan Men inheritor,
Mister Bai, is in the geno universe now. I will take you there so
you can continue learning from him. That way, you will learn things
faster.”</p>
<p>“I do not want to dash your hopes,” Ji Yanran said with a smile.
“I am going to practice it. I will then be able to calculate things
for you in the future. Like, for example, how many women are going
to try hitting on you.”</p>
<p>“Cough! Cough!” Han Sen had just taken a sip of tea and almost
choked.</p>
<p>“Why would someone ever think about hitting on me?” Han Sen
asked. “You think too highly of me. The geno universe is full of
monsters of different races. There are not many humans. Everyone
thinks of beauty in a different light. There won’t be any cheating
going on.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Ji Yanran said with a smile. “In that case, thank you
very much. Should I find you a few in the alliance? I heard Qin
Xuan and Huangfu Jing went to the geno universe. Oh, right! I think
Gu Qingcheng is there as well. She is the prettiest human woman in
existence.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ji Yanran’s smile. It felt like the smile was
actually a blade hidden in the moon. He immediately sat up straight
and avoided looking evil. He looked at Ji Yanran with love and
said, “In my eyes, the whole universe pales in comparison to how
attractive you are. Qin Xuan, Gu Qingcheng, and all the others are
like female lions. I treat them like men.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised to eat all that food. He was now
regretting letting Ji Yanran practice Xuan Men skills.</p>
<p>As an Annihilation God Spirit, if there was no special reason
for it, Han Sen could use the Sky God Crown to remain in the geno
universe for four days. He then had to go back to his god temple in
the universe of kingdoms.</p>
<p>The four days there were the most relaxing Han Sen had spent in
years. He taught Ji Yanran geno arts and practiced with
Littleflower. He stayed with Ling’er and took Ji Yanran for walks
in the mall. He was really relaxed.</p>
<p>If it was not for the God Chaos Party and Qin Xiu making trouble
for all existence, Han Sen would have preferred to stay in that
moment forever.</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, a big and icy light appeared on the
Chu Kingdom’s border, Sea Hide System. It froze a lot of barren
systems around it. It was like a big ice field in space.</p>
<p>The other systems were affected by the ice. It made the
temperatures very weird. In the star ice fields, people saw a
bright moon atop it all. It was shining in endless space.</p>
