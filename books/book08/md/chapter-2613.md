Han Yan looked at the holy gourds hanging behind her. She hadn’t expected to be the recipient of the thousand holy airs that were bestowed upon Bao’er, but it came as a surprise that not a single holy gourd had given her a holy air. It made her feel sick.

“I told my big brother that I wouldn’t disappoint him, but I haven’t even received a single holy gourd air. I have embarrassed my big brother. The people of Sky Palace will laugh at him.” Han Yan looked at the gourds, trying to decide if she should do something more to prompt the activation of at least one gourd’s holy air.

Han Yan didn’t feel this way because she didn’t understand Han Sen; it was because her living environment was different. Han Sen had grown up with danger, and he had led a very rough and tumble life. He never really cared about how people perceived him. He valued his own safety and the benefits he earned for himself more than other peoples’ opinions.

But Han Yan was different. Han Yan had never suffered before. Even in the hardest times of the Han family, Han Yan had been doted on by Luolan. Luolan expected boys to take care of themselves, but she made sure to spoil her girls. So, Han Sen and Han Yan’s personalities were bound to be different.

And when Han Sen became famous, Han Yan’s childhood became even more advantageous. When she went to school, she went to a royal school. Her performance there was exemplary, marking her as the best in the school. She was the smartest out of all the girls in her classes.

Of course, Han Yan had earned that distinction through her own talent. Family support only played a small part.

Han Sen and Luolan had put a lot of effort into guiding Han Yan, and while she appreciated their efforts, it had put a lot of pressure on her. It made Han Yan feel that if she wasn’t good enough, she would disappoint her big brother and mother after all the time they spent on her. So, Han Yan always worked as hard as possible to make herself the best could be. She wanted to be just like her brother.

The more Han Sen achieved, the more pressure Han Yan felt. Her workload increased, and so did her drive.

Now, she had taken her first steps into Sky Palace without receiving a single holy gourd air. She felt at that moment that if she gave up without trying, she would be betraying the effort and expectations of Han Sen and Luolan.

Han Sen had never felt that way about his sister, though. Not for a single moment. More than anything, he wanted Han Yan to be happy. Her success didn’t matter at all to him.

Han Sen felt the same way about all the members of his family; he only wanted them to be safe and happy. He hoped no disaster would befall them and that they would be kind to the world in return. That was his wish.

Han Yan seemed to think of something. She turned to face one of the holy vine’s gourds and moved toward it.

The nobles of Sky Palace looked at Han Yan strangely. They didn’t know what she was planning to do at first, but to their horror, they soon understood.

They saw Han Yan walk toward a gourd that was twenty centimeters tall. She grabbed it with both hands and tried to pull it down.

Blergh! Sky Palace Leader spat out the tea he was drinking. Amidst wheezy coughs, he said, “What kind of family is this? Bao’er drained the holy vine, and now this Han Yan is rude enough to try and mug the gourds!” Sky Palace didn’t have a law that prohibited people from touching the holy gourds, but anyone with a brain knew that the holy gourd vine was a deified xenogeneic plant. You couldn’t gain the holy air by force. Unless the holy gourd was willing to give the holy air away, not even a deified elite could remove it by force. And Han Yan was just a Duke.

Han Yan’s idea was simple. If there were no rules to keep her from touching the holy gourd, she at least wanted to try it and see if it worked. She wouldn’t know unless she tried. She didn’t want to disappoint Han Sen, so she had to give it a shot even if her chances of success were incredibly low.

The Sky Palace students stared at Han Yan as she focused an intense gaze on the gourd in her hands. It looked as if she wanted to yank the gourd right off the vine.

“She… really is a family member of Brother Han. She is brave.”

“This is very creative. I like Sister Han, but she should give up. She is just a Duke. If the gourd got mad, she wouldn’t be able to endure its wrath.”

“This woman is crazy! She wants to take a holy gourd with her.”

“She is as brave as her big brother, but neither of them has a brain.”

“What a shame. She has a lovely body. With her beauty and her relationship to Han Sen, she could have become a goddess in Sky Palace. Now, everyone knows that her brain is bad. She can’t be a goddess. She will be recognized as a crazy woman for sure.”

Even Exquisite stared at Han Yan with a strained look on her face. She had never seen anything like this before, either.

The Sixth Elder was happy about this. He laughed out loud and was unable to control himself. He looked at Yun Changkong and said, “Elder Yun, my brother, congratulations. You have an excellent student. I have heard she is your exclusive student. It is good that you have this student. She won’t let go of anything.” Yun Changkong’s wry smile had frozen on his face as he watched Han Yan move to clutch the holy gourd.

“The Han family… who are these people?” Yun Changkong’s mind had gone blank except for this small question.

The Dream Beast was near a lake. He saw all this, and his eyes smiled like a moon.Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang, and all the others that were close with Han Sen, stood as still as statues. Sky Palace had a long history, and across those annals of time, very few had ever dared to try what Han Yan was doing.

Han Yan didn’t care about what others thought. She held onto that holy gourd and tried yanking it down.

But the holy gourd was a deified xenogeneic plant. It was a treasure of Sky Palace. Not even ordinary deifieds could harm it. Han Yan’s strength was ant-like by comparison. It didn’t matter how hard she tried, the gourd would not budge. Han Yan noticed she wasn’t able to pull it down, but she refused to give up so easily. She used her super god body, wanting to try her best. Even if it didn’t work, at least she could say she tried. No regrets.

Thousand Feather Crane cleared his throat. “Brother Han, it is almost time. Lead your sister to Sky Palace.”

He hoped Han Sen could convince Han Yan to stop yanking on the holy vine. He just didn’t know how to tell her himself.

Han Sen hadn’t expected Han Yan to try something like this. He was as surprised as all the rest, but he still pretended to be calm. He said, “It is fine. It’s good when young people come up with ideas like this. Let her carry on.”

Han Sen wouldn’t undercut anything that Han Yan had decided to do. If the rules of Sky Palace didn’t forbid her from trying to touch the holy gourd, then he certainly wouldn’t stop her.

As this happened, Han Yan’s body changed. Her long black hair became a black crystal waterfall. It reached all the way down to her feet. Her eyes were like black gemstones. Her whole body swirled with a mysterious, holy air.
