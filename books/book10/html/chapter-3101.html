<p>Han Sen had just returned to the hotel when Mister Yang
excitedly said, “Mister… All… All gone… The gene races we sell…
Aside from the mutant eight sound bug… People bought them
all….”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what had happened. He had impressed everyone
at the party, and the people in attendance were rich and famous.
They probably visited his shop with curiosity. It was nothing out
of the ordinary for them to want to buy a few things.</p>
<p>“Put the mutant eight sound bug egg down. After everything has
been sold out, we should close the store and wait until I bring
back more gene eggs.” Han Sen was not in the mood to collect more.
He was not concerned about earning a lot of money. He only needed
enough to get by.</p>
<p>“Mister, although you are very powerful, if it is only you
digging up gene eggs, much of your time will be wasted,” Mister
Yang said. “We cannot sustainably provide gene eggs, which is not
good for our growth.”</p>
<p>Sen looked at Mister Yang and asked, “What do you mean, Old
Yang?” Han Mister Yang surprisingly stated his opinion. “We can
find a way to get resources and sell them online. Although that
will earn us less money, it can be sustainable over a longer period
of time.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I will have to depend on you.” Han Sen gave his
money and authority to Mister Yang</p>
<p>Mister Yang was excited. He got ready to impress Han Sen.
Before, he had no God Spirit Blood-Pulse or any achievements. Now,
he had a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, and it was a perfect God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. Mister Yang’s entire body felt refreshed. He felt like
a teenager and was brimming with eagerness and energy.</p>
<p>“By the way, you can have the Holy Wen White Deer now,” Han Sen
said. He then provided Mister Yang with the Holy Wen White Deer. If
Mister Yang encountered some trouble when he was not around, he
could use the Holy Wen White Deer to bolster his safety a bit.</p>
<p>“Do not worry, Mister. I will work hard on your shop.” Mister
Yang was very excited. He never thought there’d come a day he could
make use of a god-class gene race. “Safety first. Just try your
hardest within reasonable means.” Han Sen waved and returned to his
room.</p>
<p>He laid down on the bed and pulled out the stone ocarina. Han
Sen sighed and said, “When the Destiny’s Tower was destroyed, the
ocarina Little Big Sister Xiang Yin gave me was lost. I am so
sorry.”</p>
<p>Han Sen put the stone ocarina near his mouth and played a song
Xiang Yin had taught him. It was the same as before. Some smoke
came out from the holes. It generated a cloud above it.</p>
<p>The sound of crackling electricity was in the cloud. It was also
like a whisper. Han Sen had heard that sound many times. He had no
idea what it meant. He was really missing Xiang Yin, so he did not
have the time to analyze those sounds. He just closed his eyes and
kept playing.</p>
<p>The sounds of the ocarina were quiet and sounded thin. The sonic
powers were based on vibrational powers, but the sound of an
ocarina made people’s hearts feel calm. The soothing sounds of the
acoustics calmed peopled who felt annoyed.</p>
<p>Han Sen finished his song and stroked the stone ocarina. He
opened his eyes. When he saw the cloud above his head, he was given
a shock.</p>
<p>When Han Sen played it before, he had heard some godly language
speaking in a mumbling fashion. He never understood the meaning of
it.</p>
<p>This time, he did not just hear the mumbling sounds. He saw gold
lightning in the clouds. The weirder thing was that the electric
symbols from the lightning were some symbols or text Han Sen had
never seen before. He did not know what they were. For some reason,
when he saw the electric text, he felt weird. It seemed as if he
could read them and understand what they meant.</p>
<p>Han Sen was feeling more awake. He stared at the clouds with the
gold lightning, trying to remember it. As he did so, he felt more
and more shocked.</p>
<p>In a second, the lightning started to dim. The god sounds inside
vanished, and the collection of clouds vanished.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly took out the stone ocarina again. He was going
to play it. The clouds quickly returned. There were some chanting
sounds now, but there were no more gold lightning symbols. “Why is
it like this?” Han Sen tried it a few times. The results were the
same every time. No matter how he played it, even if he tried to
blow a whole song, there was still no gold lightning cloud showing
up.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Holy crap! It is the same song, and it is the
same ocarina. Why is there such a big difference?” He tried to
think if there was a big difference regarding the song he played
earlier.</p>
<p>“When I played earlier, I did not think that much. I only
thought about the past with Little Big Sister Xiang Yin. Now, I
thought about something else. If there is a difference, that would
be it.” Han Sen tried to get back into the mood for playing the
ocarina.</p>
<p>Even if a person had the power to destroy the sky and the earth,
emotions were not something that could be controlled. The heart
sometimes shook. It might only last a second, but no one could
control it.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not allow himself to think about it. He could not
feel the emotions needed, so he gave up.</p>
<p>If what was inside the gold lightning mark was real, that was
too shocking. Han Sen thought it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Although he had not read all of the lightning’s text, just
reading a single word was enough to be shocking. The words were how
to create a</p>
<p>god.</p>
<p>The way to make a god had nothing to do with how to grow a
god-class gene race. It was the way to make a real God Spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only seen one part of it. There was no beginning,
and there was no end. That was all he could guess.</p>
<p>“How do I get the whole text?” Han Sen really wanted to figure
out how to make a God Spirit. He wondered if what was written up
there was real or not.</p>
<p>“Sacrifice God Ocarina.” The big sky demon revealed herself
before Han Sen. She looked at Han Sen’s ocarina and looked
disturbingly excited.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the big sky demon and asked, “Do you know what
this thing is?”</p>
<p>The big sky demon replied, “It’s called Sacrifice God Ocarina.
It is an item for a god sacrifice.” Her vision never moved away
from the ocarina.</p>
<p>“I know this is an ocarina,” Han Sen said with a frown. “I
wanted to ask you what it is for.”</p>
<p>The big sky demon looked away and smiled. “Just like the name
suggests, it is an item for praying to a God Spirit. What else is
it for?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the big sky demon and did not say anything.
From the big sky demon to the ocarina, it was not as simple as she
said.</p>
<p>The big sky demon laid down next to Han Sen. She used her
fingers to tilt Han Sen’s jaw. She seductively said, “Do not look
at me like that. If you want to know things in detail, that is
fine. But you are going to have to spend the night with me.”</p>
<p>“I still have things to do. You can just play with yourself.”
Han Sen jumped off the bed. The big sky demon did not have to tell
him. He was going to figure out the lightning text in the cloud by
himself. He would then figure out how to use the stone ocarina.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Han Sen was not very good when it came to music.
He only triggered the gold lightning because of his emotions for
Little Big Sister Xiang Yin. He was not able to summon those
emotions on a whim. He could not do it again.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “If I can’t do it, it does not mean other
people cannot do it. If Fang Yin Yi really is Little Big Sister
Xiang Yin reborn, she must be talented when it comes to music.
Perhaps she can help me uncover the riddle behind this strange
ocarina.” He planned to ask Xiang Yin Yin for help.</p>
