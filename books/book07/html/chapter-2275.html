<h2>Thirteen Bridges</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2275</h3>

<p>The third checkpoint was completely different from the two prior
checkpoints they had visited. Although it was a palace, too, it was
much larger than the others. The floor of the palace wasn’t covered
in stone, but water. It was a large lake, with many bridges running
across it.</p>
<p>The jade bridges were in the shape of a crescent moon, and there
were thirteen of them. They spanned the entirety of the palace, and
each one seemed to connect to a separate teleporter on the opposite
side of the lake.</p>
<p>Each of the thirteen bridges was made of a different type of
jade.</p>
<p>Stone statues stood along the railings of each bridge. Some of
the statues seemed to depict devils, whereas others seemed to
depict angels. Some were in the shape of vicious beasts, and others
looked like gentle creatures.</p>
<p>Han Sen was now looking out across a purple jade bridge. Its
railings had a line of evil-looking stone statues, but that wasn’t
why Han Sen was observing it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was looking at the highest point of the purple bridge,
where there was a ten-meter-tall statue that looked like a devil.
It was squatting in the middle of the bridge with its wings folded.
The devil’s eyes were looking down, as if they were scanning the
area below for something to eat.</p>
<p>Purple-and-blackish nails adorned its fingers, and they were
long and sharp like talons. A woman was clutched in its hand, and
the woman was quite familiar to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yisha!” Han Sen almost screamed out.</p>
<p>The purple devil’s stone hand gripped Yisha firmly. Although her
body was covered by its fingers, her face was clearly visible. She
was very pale, and blood dripped from her mouth. It looked as if
she was in a coma, and her hair had turned bone white.</p>
<p>Han Sen recognized her even so, and he was certain of her
identity. She was in horrible shape, but her face still looked
exactly the same as he remembered it. She was still that almighty
queen. No one else could ever look like she did.</p>
<p>“Why is Yisha here? I thought she had been swallowed by Under
Overbearing.” Han Sen’s heart jumped as he thought of something.
“Is this the palace that sits on Under Overbearing’s back?”</p>
<p>Thinking of this possibility, Han Sen’s heart started to pound
like mad. “No wonder the Sacred Leader wasn’t afraid of people
stealing his treasure. He invested a lot to secure his
possessions.”</p>
<p>“My Queen!” Han Sen shouted to Yisha from across the bridge,
hoping to wake her up. He could tell that she wasn’t dead.</p>
<p>Han Sen imbued his voice with a sonic wave, but the call
prompted no reaction from her.</p>
<p>“Stop shouting. Even if a deified elite was shouting at her, she
wouldn’t be able to hear the call,” Mister White said.</p>
<p>“Ah. I see.” Han Sen looked at Mister White and bowed.</p>
<p>Mister White pointed at the jade bridge and said, “These
thirteen bridges contain thirteen different powers. Stepping onto a
bridge locks you onto it. This must be the other test that was left
behind by the Sacred Leader. We are going to have to choose the
right bridge if we are to go through this safely.”</p>
<p>“What is the power of that bridge?” Han Sen pointed at Yisha’s
purple jade bridge.</p>
<p>“If I’m not mistaken, then the devil statues on the bridge are
the legendary Hell Ghosts. The statue at the center must be Hell
Ghost King. It represents hell power,” Mister White said, looking
at the bridge carefully.</p>
<p>“Is hell power a death element power?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Mister White shook his head. “Hell is where the dead go,
according to the legends, but hell is not actually associated with
the death element. It is another branch of space and time. You can
understand it this way: hell is another dimension that exists
separately from our world. The axis of space and time is different
there than in our world. So, hell power comes from that difference
in dimensional structure. It is not about death or darkness.”</p>
<p>“Then how do we save her?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Mister White pursed his lips. “Aside from forcing our way
through, I cannot think of a way we can. Space and time are very
mysterious elements that are extremely difficult to control. The
legends say that the Sacred Leader mastered space and time powers.
Knife was unlucky to select the jade bridge that is aligned with
those energies.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. If Yisha had failed to force her way across the
jade bridge, then that meant it would be even more difficult for
him.</p>
<p>After all, most of Han Sen’s geno arts were Marquise. His
fighting power wasn’t as strong as Yisha’s half-deified
abilities.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Yisha in the grip of the devil’s hand, and
when he looked closer, he saw that the devil’s nails were actually
digging into Yisha’s flesh. Ever so slowly, Yisha continued to
bleed. The blood ran across the statue’s nails, and the tips of
those nails were dyed red.</p>
<p>If that continued, Yisha wouldn’t have much time left before she
bled to death.</p>
<p>The power of the hell bridge blocked Han Sen’s connection with
Yisha, so he could not determine her lifeforce. But he could see
clearly that she didn’t have much time left.</p>
<p>Mister White examined the thirteen jade bridges and then came
back. He made a number of calculations. Han Sen thought he must
have been trying to pick the jade bridge they could all cross
safely.</p>
<p>But quickly, Mister White’s face started to look gloomy. “These
thirteen bridges are dead ends. They all have a scary power
guarding them, so none of them can be crossed safely. Did the
Sacred Leader not plan on letting anyone leave this place
alive?”</p>
<p>“No! There must be a way!” Mister White started to sweat. His
fingers flashed with a symbol as he continued to make his
calculations.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes kept drifting over to the purple jade bridge. The
Purple-Eye Butterfly in his right eye spun, analyzing the structure
of the purple jade bridge.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that Yisha was very brave and sometimes arrogant,
but she was never stupid. There was no way she would have decided
to take the most difficult path.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Yisha selected the hell bridge for a specific
purpose. He just didn’t know why she had failed.</p>
<p>The Purple-Eye Butterfly’s four-flower purple pupil kept
spinning, but not much could be gleaned. The purple jade bridge was
wrapped up in some sort of power. Han Sen could see a very
complicated substance chain around it, woven like a bird’s nest.
Han Sen couldn’t understand this. He couldn’t tell what sort of
power it was.</p>
<p>“This is it! If we walk this bridge, we can make it through
alive.” Mister White suddenly pointed at a jade bridge
triumphantly.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at where Mister White was pointing. He was
indicating a jade bridge that was pitch-black like ink. The bridge
featured some crow-like bird statues. A giant bird statue stood in
the middle of the bridge on a stone pillar, coldly overlooking the
entire bridge.</p>
