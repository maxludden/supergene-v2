<p>Shortly after, Han Sen had managed to claim over a million miles of land for humans. Unfortunately, there were hardly any humans in a position to handle the shelters and land, so he had to allow spirits to remain alive and serve as stewards for the time being.</p>

<p>The spirits were right in this assumption. When they feared Han Sen’s takeover, they guessed he would need to keep the spirits alive to handle matters. And aside from saving humans, he couldn’t actually take over and rule the Third God’s Sanctuary. It just wasn’t feasible.</p>

<p>Spirits gained power at a decent, steady rate. But humans had always been slow in the Third God’s Sanctuary, and although things were better now, they’d still take a long time to gain what was necessary to start ruling the lands Han Sen had claimed.</p>

<p>Han Sen was currently resting in a shelter. He was asleep, but he was roused from his slumber by the detection of someone near. Someone not very familiar to him had entered his private garden.</p>

<p>With Han Sen’s heightened senses, he knew that person had to be powerful if he had only now just been noticed.</p>

<p>“God’s Retribution?” It was God’s Retribution, one of the thirteen members of Blood Legion.</p>

<p>God’s Retribution seemed to be at ease, and he sat down gently, saying, “Super Spank? Ha! That’s a good one.”</p>

<p>“I got lucky. And besides, I didn’t name it that,” Han Sen said, unsure of the relationship that was supposed to exist between them.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard it’s your goal to take over the Third God’s Sanctuary,” God’s Retribution said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve heard right,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that, if I were you,” God’s Retribution said.</p>

<p>“It’s fortunate you’re not me. But tell me; why?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>God’s Retribution looked over to the pool of water and told him, “Blood Legion knew about super geno points, and we’ve been killing super creatures since long before the existence of them became common knowledge. We didn’t inform humanity about any of it; do you know why that is?”</p>

<p>Han Sen was not surprised they could gather super geno points with the strength they had. They were far stronger than average humans, after all, and it’d be baffling to hear them say they had never killed one before.</p>

<p>Han Sen was curious about what the man was looking to tell him, though. So, he played along and said, “No. Why?”</p>

<p>God’s Retribution explained, “Humans are actually the invaders of this place. By coming to the sanctuaries, humans broke the balance. Typical human behavior, really; like parasites. Although there is an abundance of resources, creatures, and spirits here, we slowly break the balance established in these realms. Before, when humans were unable to slay super creatures, things were already bad. After their slaying of those became common, we hit a slippery slope. The ecosystems of the sanctuaries are suffering.”</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned and said, “Creatures can nest and shoot out more babies, can’t they?”</p>

<p>“Do you know how many years it takes to produce an egg? And if you do, do you know how many eggs have been broken since your lie? Two centuries down the line we are currently treading, humans will be fighting each other for super geno points.”</p>

<p>God’s Retribution was genuinely concerned, and it appeared to grieve him to speak of these matters. After a lengthy pause and sigh, he went on to say, “And a lot of that has to do with you. You’re a remarkable person, I must tell you. But you’re speeding up this process; a process that will only lead to ruin. If you continue doing what you’re doing, this will happen faster than it did for the First God’s Sanctuary.”</p>

<p>“Blood Legion didn’t tell anyone on purpose? To avoid this from happening? I’d consider that noble, if it wasn’t also selfish,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>God’s Retribution responded to the slight, explaining, “We were delaying the inevitable. We knew it was only a matter of time before the existence of super creatures and Life Geno Essences were found out, and we just wanted to make these ecosystems last. You’ve heard it before, surely, but humans really are horrible creatures. Their mistreatment in this sanctuary was a well-needed humbling. Everywhere else, we’re parasites; invading one place until its sucked dry, before multiplying and bringing the same fate elsewhere. Take a look at the First God’s Sanctuary and you’ll see what I mean. What a sorry sight that place is, in recent times.”</p>

<p>“There must be something we can do to alleviate the issue, surely,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>God’s Retribution said, “If humans insist on becoming part of the cycle, adjustments can be made. But like I said, we were delaying the inevitable, and whether or not we can truly be a part of things in the sanctuaries and co-exist with the current laws, I can’t say for certain.”</p>

<p>He went on to reassert his meaning by again saying, “Humans have upset the balance of the sanctuaries. The First God’s Sanctuary is bad enough as it is, but you are making things worse.”</p>

<p>“You said that already. But what if I decide to continue down the road I’m currently headed? What would you plan to do about that?” Han Sen asked, needling God’s Retribution to learn as much as he could about what he wanted.</p>

<p>“I won’t stop you. The trail you blaze is your own, but with how people see you, you should set a better example. If your heirs are one day killing each other for a measly scrap of flesh, you can’t roll in your grave and say we didn’t warn you,” God’s Retribution said, then turned to leave.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought he’d be threatened, and he readied himself for a fight. With his strength now, he was keen to stress the limits of how powerful Blood Legion members truly were.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not expect him to immediately say his piece and then leave.</p>

<p>He thought the encounter had been rather strange, and his perception of Blood Legion had been altered somewhat, after it. He thought Blood Legion was an evil, slightly scary organization, but they were obviously concerned for the overall trajectory humanity was headed on.</p>

<p>Blood Legion cared about the environment like the people of Greenpeace. And the thought of those two organizations sharing similar goals was something he was struggling to comprehend.</p>

<p>“Go to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. I’ll be waiting for you there, and when we do next meet, let’s hope it won’t be as enemies.” God’s Retribution swiftly left after saying this.</p>

<p>Han Sen now understood these were his parting words, and the only chance they’d have to speak before his departure to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. This was God’s Retribution’s goodbye.</p>
