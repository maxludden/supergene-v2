  “Miss Feng, you are being too polite,” Han Sen said. “I would not dare to punish you, but there is one thing I would like your help with.”

“If there is something you need, I will try my best to do it,” Feng Fei Fei seriously said. “Even if it costs me everything, I will do all in my power to fulfill your wishes.”

“It is not that serious,” Han Sen said. “I just wanted to ask you to take care of Bao’er while I am away. You can take her to certain places to play. I have been quite busy recently, and I still won’t have much time to spend with her anytime soon.”

“Do not worry, Mister Han. I will treat Bao’er as if she was my own daughter.” After Feng Fei Fei said that, she thought there was something wrong with what she said and blushed.

Feng Fei Fei knew she could not explain it. Otherwise, it would only become awkward. She just pretended that nothing had happened.

“In that case, please take care of Bao’er, Miss Feng,” Han Sen said with a laugh.

Mister Han, you should just call me Fei Fei,” Feng Fei Fei said as she gently tugged Bao’er’s hands. “In front of you, I would not dare risk having you call me Miss.”

“Sure.” Han Sen nodded. He then told Bao’er, “Bao’er, if you want to play something or eat something, just tell Miss Fei Fei. Your father has things to do. I do not have time for you.”

“I understand, Dad,” Bao’er said as she blinked her eyes.

Han Sen looked at her face. He knew she had already come up with some heinous ideas, but he could not be bothered guessing what Bao’er was going to do.

Recently, he had a few ideas he wanted to act on. He hoped to get the Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra to combine for break world power.

Although break world power could affect the entire rotation of the world’s spinning, if he could not save his own life, it would not matter how well the world spun.

Rocky Dee and the God Chaos Party were keeping an eye on him, so he needed to be prepared.

Han Sen went back to his room and started researching break world power, hoping he could learn it before the god fights started.

“Bao’er, are there any places you would like to go?” Feng Fei Fei crouched in front of Bao’er. “I do not know where we can go for fun,” Bao’er nicely said. “Why don’t you be the one in charge, Sister Fei Fei?”

Feng Fei Fei receded into thought for a while before suggesting, “Why don’t I take you to the playground?”

“That is a place for kids. I am not going.” Bao’er shook her head.

“In that case, where would you like to go?” Feng Fei Fei asked with a smile. She thought Bao’er acted like an adult.

Bao’er rolled her eyes as she asked, “Is there a place like a pub nearby?”.

“Such a place is not for you to go. You are too young.” Feng Fei Fei felt bad to decline the request.

Bao’er blinked. She looked at Feng Fei Fei and said, “Sister Fei Fei, you cannot do this.” “Do what?” Feng Fei Fei looked at Bao’er with confusion. She did not know why she said that.

Bao’er looked as if she was smiling at Feng Fei Fei, but she was not smiling. She asked, “Do you like my Dad?”

Feng Fei Fei blushed. “What are you talking about?”

“That is exactly why I said you cannot do this,” Bao’er seriously said. “I have a mother. If you do this, you will not stand a chance.”

Feng Fei Fei looked disappointed. She still held Bao’er’s hands, crouched in front of her, and smiled. “Bao’er, you think too much. I only admire and feel grateful to Mister Han. There is nothing more to it than that. I do not want to ruin your family.”

“Wrong. Very wrong. Sister Fei Fei, you are so wrong. My mother is in another world. In this world, only my Dad exists. Do you know how lonely he is? He is like a single man having to take care of a daughter. Do you know how difficult it has been for him? Don’t you want to help him?” Bao’er spoke with visible excitement.

If Han Sen had heard what Bao’er said, he would have coughed up blood. After hanging out with Han Jinzhi for a while, it was evident she had turned naughty.

Although it was the truth, she made it sound very wrong. “Your mother…” Feng Fei Fei misunderstood. Her eyes looked soft. They shone with a motherly light. She wanted to put Bao’er into her chest to comfort her.

Bao’er used her small hands to stop her. She sounded like an adult as she said, “So, Sister Fei Fei, the way you currently are is no good. Men love bad women. Women like you, who are so nice and pretty, will never snare the hearts of men.”

“Han… Does your dad like bad women?” Feng Fei Fei wondered aloud.

“Not really bad bad women,” Bao’er said with seriousness. “It’s more appearance-wise. They want you looking bad, but the heart of a nice woman is something you have and display. You just lack that distinct, kinky feeling my dad really enjoys. If you work harder, my dad will love you very much. I guarantee it.”

Feng Fei Fei looked at Bao’er and asked, “In that case, how do I achieve this naughty feeling?”

She had the best reputation among the three famous singers. She was widely adored for being holy, innocent, and pure. Her appearance radiated that.

In fact, her face and her personality were elegant. She wasn’t the sort of woman that just looked attractive and charming.

“You need to observe more in day-to-day life,” Bao’er said. “Let’s go to the pub so I can show you the sort of women my Dad likes.” She pulled Feng Fei Fei outside by the hand.

Although Feng Fei Fei felt as if something was wrong, Bao’er suddenly occupied her mind. She found herself following her outside of Feng Castle.

Han Sen did not know Bao’er was using him to take advantage of Feng Fei Fei and making her take her to a pub. He was in his room, trying to make progress with break world powers.

The Xuan Yellow Sutra and the Blood-Pulse Sutra came from the same skill set, but they had opposite elements. They were like ice and fire, so it was really hard to combine them.

Plus, because of the problems with the rules of the world, it was hard to combine them into one.

Han Sen had been researching this for a long time, but he had yet to make any progress. He turned into the God of Wealth and used some God Spirit authority. That gave him some ideas.

“The God Spirits can use the bodies of humans to descend. They can maximize their own powers and unleash them, and the rules do not inhibit them. Does that work with me too?” Han Sen had been researching this quite a bit.

Of course, Han Sen was not going to descend like an actual God Spirit. He had his real body.

To be more accurate, it was the part that he practiced, such as the Dongxuan Sutra Armor or The Story of Gene’s Spell.

If they were able to run with a main geno art and his body ran a negative geno art, their conflict would be minimized. At the same time, his body would have the effects of the two geno arts.

The only problem was that Han Sen had no reverse Dongxuan Sutra or reverse The Story of Genes, so the Blood-Pulse Sutra did not have items to use.

“I wonder if Spell’s body can reverse my Blood-Pulse Sutra?” Han Sen wanted to do this test.
