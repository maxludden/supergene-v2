  “Little Gold Gold!” Ling’er saw Golden Growler’s mouth was bleeding blood. Now, Bird Elder and his people were unleashing more scary powers her way. She screamed.

Golden Growler ignored the blood that was oozing from his mouth. His eyes were shining gold. He opened up his mouth again. This time, when the mouth opened, it did not release a scary gold light. He was spitting out a golden door.

Bird Elder did not care much for the presence of the golden door. They had seen many weird powers over the course of their lifetime, but they had not seen golden doors before. Even creatures that could use their powers to create castles were something they had witnessed in the past. They had seen an awful lot.

Without hesitation, they increased the voltage of their outgoing powers. They attacked the golden door Golden Growler was releasing.

Boom!

The five powers that could destroy the sky and the ground crashed into the door. It made the golden door echo with sound, but their powers could not break open the golden door.

Bird Elder and the five people were all shocked. One elder looked weirded-out and asked, “How is such a thing possibly possible? With the power used by all five of us elders, not even someone like Itchy, if he were to generate a time door, would be unable to resist our might. We could break down his time doors, so how can this golden door not be broken with ease? What kind of power is this creature using?”

Bird Elder thought something must have been wrong about this too. Before they could do anything, there was a sudden “katcha” noise. The five elders were shocked. They looked at the golden door that did not appear to be ajar.

A golden light came out from beyond the golden door. It was like the waning light at sunset, and it was seeping out from the gap between the door and the door frame.

Before Bird Elder and the others could react, wherever the gold light shone on, that space was turned into nothing. Bird Elder, who was a powerful existence, immediately melted beneath the force of that golden light. He did not even have a chance to scream about his demise.

The Break World elites that had a Break World rate of at least 95% vanished completely. There was no trace of them left behind.

“Little Gold Gold, it is fine! You can put the golden door away now!” Ji Yanran shouted at Golden Growler. She knew what would happen if the golden door was opened completely. The whole of Space Garden would undoubtedly be destroyed.

Fortunately, Golden Growler seemed to be aware of this. He did not really open the golden door. He swallowed the golden door back down.

The students going into the house were relieved. Last time, when Little Gold Gold opened the golden door, many students saw the scary scene.

When the golden door opened up, Human King, in the 33 skies, opened his eyes. He looked surprised.

“How is that possible? How can they possess this power? That is impossible.” Human King’s face looked more and more shocked. His heart jumped, and his eyes started to spin. It was like a view of the whole universe was now inside him.

When Human King saw the golden door unleash its gold light, his body quaked. His eyes flashed strangely.

“Is such a thing even possible? Does this universe truly have a creature like this? Behind the golden door is there…” Human King’s face kept changing

A long time later, Human King looked as if he had come to a decision. He stepped out of the 33 skies.

The whole of Space Garden had become a butcher’s landscape. Crazy killing and dead life were now everywhere. White bones and bloody chunks were strewn across the land, far and wide. There was the sound of broken bones and gushing blood filling the acoustic soundscape. In a raging, crazy fight, it was not that scary. Instead, it gave people a hot and blood-boiling rush.

Littleflower’s clothes were white, but his eyes were red. He did not know how many Break World beasts he had killed by this point, but there were more and more Break World beasts coming. It was like their numbers were infinite.

It was not just Littleflower in such a state. All of the elites from Space Garden were soaked in blood. It was their own blood but also mixed with even more of the enemy’s blood.

The eyes of the elites of the God Chaos Party were turning red too. Their wild side covered their senses. Only the enemy’s fresh blood could cool down their own boiling blood.

Suddenly, there was a shadow above Space Garden. It was like the whole battlefield was frozen.

All of the creatures kept fighting. Some of them had their mouths wide open. Some of their faces were twisted. Some of them looked scared. Some of them held their faces and cried aloud. All of the creatures kept their emotions frozen from how they were only a second ago. The broken limbs and blood splatters were frozen in the air. Time seemed to have stopped.

Even Itchy and Ning Yue, who were powerful Break World elites, were the same way. They were frozen and could not move.

Everyone knew this was not time itself coming to a halt. If time had been stopped, their thoughts would have been stopped as well. Now, they could see things and think. They could just not move their eyes.

“Human King!” Ning Yue saw the frozen body emerge. His eyes went smaller as he did.

Human King came from space. It was like he was the only living thing left in the universe. Everything else was completely silent. Even the powerful elites that had a Break World rate of 100% appeared dead in front of him.

Tang Zhenliu saw Human King too. He really wanted to scream, “Let me go! Fight me if you have the balls to!”

But he could not even move his teeth. He could not provoke the man.

Human King did not look at them. He merely walked forward. He ignored the God Chaos Party’s people and their assault as if they did not actually exist. He kept walking to Space Garden.

Space Garden’s bai sema did not work on Human King. It was like there was only air there, and he was simply able to walk inside the floral realm.

Inside Space Garden, everything had come to a standstill. Every creature had strangely stopped moving. They watched Human King walk to Han Sen’s house.

When Human King came, Bao’er, who was currently in the sanctuaries, felt her heart jump. She stopped whatever she was doing.

“Why have you frozen? Keep practicing. You have not yet succeeded. You must learn how to combine with the gene seed.” Chaos saw Bao’er stop completely. She frowned and hurried her.

“I need to go to the geno universe,” Bao’er said while lowering her head.

“Baby, you can’t go back yet,” Chaos said. “Mom promises you that once you have succeeded in combining with this, you can go wherever you want to.”

Bao’er raised her head. She looked certain as she spoke word by word. “I am going back to the universe now, with or without your permission.”

“Why?” Chaos was shocked. This was the first time she had ever witnessed Bao’er talk to her in such a way.

“It is because my mother is in danger, and I must save her,” Bao’er said. She then ran to the door. She did not hesitate.

“But I am right here,” Chaos said. Her face instantly changed. She understood the mother she was referring to was not her. It was Han Sen’s wife, Ji Yanran.
