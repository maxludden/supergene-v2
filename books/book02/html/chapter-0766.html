    <p>
      &#8220;Wait for me here; do not go anywhere.&#8221; Han Sen took Zhou
      Yumei a good distance away and left her some supplies. The silver fox and
      Little Orange were to stay with her, as well. He returned to the cactus,
      only bringing the fairy with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Facing those terrifying super creatures, only the fairy—an adult super
      creature—could fight back. The silver fox was still very young, so he
      wouldn&#8217;t have been much use there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t dare approach the rhino on his return, however. He
      hid himself and watched it closely. Once a battle between the trio
      commenced, Han Sen would evaluate the conditions and then decide whether
      or not he should intervene.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy and the little angel were both in the super class, whereas Han
      Sen was a little bit below that. The fairy and the little angel could most
      definitely keep themselves alive for a time, but the same might not be
      said for Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      If possible, Han Sen would maintain his distance from the cactus and allow
      the fairy and the little angel to retrieve the item he desired.
    </p>

    <p>
      As time passed, the wrinkled fruit of the cactus grew to about the same
      size as a basketball. The purple, wrinkled skin made it look somewhat like
      a sweet potato. But it had many dots and hair on it, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this thing was not growing on the cactus, it wouldn&#8217;t have stood
      out from the average veggie at all. It didn&#8217;t look bright and holy
      like the peach he once had the pleasure of eating.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the white rhino and the black phoenix were undoubtedly of a higher
      power-tier than the black bear. These were adult second-generation super
      creatures, and they could very well occupy the upper echelon of power
      levels for the entirety of the Second Shelter. These creatures
      weren&#8217;t the average, run-of-the-mill first-generation super
      creatures Han Sen competed with for the peach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched them for two days, and slowly, the fruit was beginning to
      mature. It made the black phoenix and cloud-wrapped creature antsy and
      anxious.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix inched its way closer to the cactus, as did the
      dark clouds. It looked as if the sky was falling, and the land was about
      to be crushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rhino no longer had its eyes closed now, either. It stood up next to
      the cactus.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the rhino moved to stand where it chose, the black-flame phoenix and
      dark cloud moved back further. They really were afraid of it.
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>
      A crack developed on the top of the fruit. And out of it, a purple gas
      seeped. It was like a dream, and it enveloped the entire fruit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rhino glowed with a holy light, and its giant body began to fly. It
      ascended towards the purple haze.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix screeched loudly, flapped its fiery wings, and
      released terrifying heat waves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thunder rolled inside the cloud in the sky, and it unleashed a fearsome
      rainstorm upon the lands below. Amidst the thunder, Han Sen could catch
      the faint growls of a hidden monster.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fight! Come on, fight!&#8221; Han Sen encouraged them to fight in
      his heart. He wanted them out of the way, so he could nab the loot for
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix and the cloud-creature were incredibly angry, and
      they roared in rage. But still, they did not dare get close to the rhino.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no! How can you two do this to me? It should be two versus one,
      how can they sit back and watch?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s jaw almost
      unhinged itself. The rhino, however, opened its mouth wide and leaned
      forward to eat the wrinkled fruit that was shrouded in a purple mist. The
      phoenix and cloud only continued to scream at the rhino, remaining where
      they were.
    </p>

    <p>Munch!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was expecting the crazy spectacle of a super-battle, but nothing
      of the like occurred. The white rhino swallowed the fruit and mist
      unopposed, while the phoenix and cloud did not move a single inch the
      entire time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart sank, but he was still surprised over how
      intimidating the rhino&#8217;s power was. The black phoenix was a
      frightening creature, right out legend, and yet it was too afraid to
      attack. All it did was watch the rhino gobble the fruit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought back to his time in the oasis, and how they stole coconut
      juice from the rhino. If the rhino really had gotten infuriated with them,
      there would have been nothing the fairy or little angel could have done to
      help. The thought sent a shiver down Han Sen&#8217;s spine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix and cloud watched the rhino eat the fruit but did
      not leave. It looked as if they were waiting for something, and this made
      Han Sen curious.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The white rhino ate the fruit; what are they waiting for? Is the
      cactus edible? It shouldn&#8217;t be, since it&#8217;s full of
      thorns,&#8221; Han Sen thought, as he looked to the top of the cactus
      which had been cleaned by the rhino&#8217;s maw.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      But then Han Sen became confused. The rhino that ate the fruit leapt on
      the spot, and when it came down, its giant body shook the entire desert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the white rhino, thinking something must be wrong. The
      holy light of the rhino was getting brighter and brighter, and it did not
      slow down. It was blasting out of its body like multiple searchlights.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly used his dongxue aura to scan the rhino. He was quite a
      distance away, however, so he couldn&#8217;t sense it too clearly. But the
      energy flow inside the rhino was like a volcanic eruption, and Han Sen
      didn&#8217;t even have to use his special sense abilities to observe it.
      It was plain to the naked eye.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      The white rhino&#8217;s jade-like skin began to crack like dry mud. Blood
      poured out of its breaking skin.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no! Did the rhino consume too many nutrients at once? Perhaps
      his body can&#8217;t take that much, and it&#8217;s going to destroy
      him&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s eyes almost fell from his sockets at the sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that scary, holy light, the skin of the rhino continued to crack.
      Within a second, the white rhino had become a red rhino. It was like a
      monster from hell, having just taken part in a bloodbath.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Roar!&#8221; The white rhino screamed to the sky, as if it was
      talking to the creator above. More and more holy light beamed out of it
      and then, it unleashed a mini atom bomb some distance away. The area it
      fired towards was wholly annihilated in a blinding flash of light, and all
      that remained was a crater in the sand.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix flapped its wings frantically, and it seemed
      tempted to approach the rhino.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cloud had already decided to descend, as a thunder rumbled within it.
      It looked very interested in what was happening to the rhino.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! They are both not leaving. Is it because they want to
      eat the white rhino once it falls?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s mind was in a
      mess, trying to guess what was going on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black phoenix and the cloud hardly moved now, remaining where they
      were and watching the rhino&#8217;s body break down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was patiently waiting, as well. He still hoped he could grab a few
      treats out of this entire affair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the white rhino&#8217;s blood oozing into the black sand, Han Sen
      felt pretty bad. Not for the reasons you might think, however. He thought
      all that bleeding was a great loss, and Han Sen could only imagine what
      such large, powerful quantities of blood might do for his Death Knell.
      Heaven knew how much it&#8217;d evolve.
