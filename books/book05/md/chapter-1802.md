The battle started with an arrow falling from the sky. It landed the midst of everyone, and they all stared at it in shock. They raised their heads, and they saw Chaos descending from the sky. The Chaos quickly surrounded everyone, and their numbers were several hundred strong.

A line of arrows were targeting them, and everyone was shocked. That included Han Sen.

He had already tried escaping from four Chaos, and that was extremely trying. But now their numbers were vast, and he quickly realized that escaping might be impossible here. Unless he used his super god body, of course. In his current state, though, he couldn’t flee.

It was a shame he still needed to recover. Even if he did use super god spirit mode, it wouldn’t last very long. He might be able to take down a few Chaos, but he couldn’t kill a few hundred while maintaining enough strength to escape.

“Put down your weapons and put your hands behind your head.” A Chaos made use of the universal language to speak with them.

Facing so many drawn bows, no one dared do anything to provoke the Chaos. Looking glum, they all did as instructed. They put down their weapons and put their hands behind their heads.

Han Sen returned the scabbard to his waist and lifted his arms like the higher races were. The Chaos moved closer and pointed the arrows right at them, then ropes were brought out to bind them. The Chaos put long spears through the ropes and carried them like pigs.

“They are vegetarians, right? Or are they cannibals?” Han Sen’s heart sank. If it wasn’t for those who had been captured with him, he would have been long gone by now. He wouldn’t have been in this predicament.

Luckily, the Chaos didn’t seem to want to kill them immediately. The creatures were headed into the desert.

After four days, they came to an oasis. This oasis was far bigger, and wooden houses were visible amidst the foliage. So, it must have been where the Chaos lived.

Everyone was brought to a meadow filled with stone pillars. Yisha was tied to one. She was still wearing her mask, but the wound in her chest now looked fine.

The higher races didn’t seem to recognize her, and the two Rebate with him didn’t realize who she was. They seemed none the wiser.

Then, the Chaos tied them to the stone pillars. Han Sen was not too far from Yisha, as she was only two pillars away.

Yisha did see Han Sen there, though. And she also saw the scabbard he was carrying. Her eyes looked bright and confused, and she fervently wondered why the scabbard would behave like that.

The Chaos took the wooden weaponry that the group carried. They didn’t see a knife in the socket of the scabbard, so they left it with Han Sen. Han Sen couldn’t use it, anyway.

“What do the Chaos want to do with us?” the bird-faced man asked.

No one could answer him, as no one knew what the Chaos wanted. The creatures just tied them to the pillars and then left. There were a few Chaos children looking at them, though. The kids stared at them like they were animals in a zoo.

The Chaos were affected by Demon Grave, and so they didn’t have any Nobles. They only had geno armor. But their fitness, even when they were children, was quite good.

The Demon called Vic turned to Yisha and asked, “Rebate Lady, when did they capture you? Do you have any idea what they plan to do?”

Yisha ignored him. She was a King that had touched a deified door. If she had not been injured by Han Sen, she would not have gotten captured. This was a humiliating situation for her, and so she wasn’t willing to let anyone hear of her identity.

Vic frowned when he got ignored, but it wasn’t as if he could threaten her into talking now.

A Rebate man asked, “Look, we’re all in the same boat here. If you know anything, you should tell us. Maybe then we can escape together.”

The other high race people agreed, in the hope that she could tell them something they could use to escape.

Yisha pretended she did not hear any of them. She simply closed her eyes and rested.

The Rebate man was made angry by this, and he shouted, “Did you not hear me? I am Rocks Fall Duke, and I command you to answer me.”

Yisha still kept her eyes closed, and she pretended as if she did not hear him. Han Sen just looked at the woman curiously. It was strange that they did not know Yisha. Han Sen thought she would be a person of enormous importance, the type of person that a mere Duke wouldn’t dare to compare themselves to. So, how could Rock Falls Duke not recognize who she was?

The sky went dark, and eventually, the Chaos kids looked tired. They returned to the houses, leaving only those who were tied up outside.

The Chaos were sleeping now, and no one was watching them. Some of the higher races wished to shake off their ropes and see if they could escape.

They did not know what their bindings were made of, though. They couldn’t get free from them. Even when they squeezed their bodies, the rope would constrict and squeeze, too.

“Argh!” A weird voice came from outside of the oasis. Everyone was shocked, and they thought the Chaos had noticed their attempts to escape.

They looked around and noticed that the wooden doors of the houses were all closed. No Chaos seemed to be coming out. And then, they heard that noise again. It sounded as if it was coming from every angle.

Eventually, the noise drew nearer and nearer. And not long after, some green eyes were seen peering at them. They were everywhere in the dark. There were oh-so-many of them.

“What is this? I thought that, aside from the Chaos, there wouldn’t be any other creatures here,” the bird-looking higher race man said.

The others of the higher races looked terrible, and it soon looked as if the eyes were coming towards them. It didn’t seem as if they were only there to admire the captives.
