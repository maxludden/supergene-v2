    <p>
      The tolling of the bell, when he had been further down the mountain, was
      not as strong as what he was hearing now. Because he was so close to it,
      every ring was like a thunderbolt that convulsed his body and caused him
      to spit blood from his mouth.
    </p>

    <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The blue bell continued to ring, and Han Sen continued to writhe, oozing
      blood from his mouth. He used the Dongxuan Sutra the best he could, to
      fight back the damage caused by the loud tolling of the bell. Although the
      Dongxuan Sutra was powerful, it didn&#8217;t provide enough relief to
      fight back the noise. The energy inside Han Sen went insane, and the chaos
      inside highlighted every vein that coursed through his body. A green vein,
      in particular, began to expand in his body, looking ready to rupture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of his smaller veins were broken already, which dyed his skin red. It
      was a frightening sight to witness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood centipede was not doing any better. In its agony, it twisted and
      wriggled around on the ground, toppling many buildings. Its madness only
      generated more noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue bell seemed to deal damage to any creature that heard it. The
      more energy a creature had, the more damage it suffered.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood centipede must have been a second generation super creature. Its
      energy was incredibly powerful, but it could not withstand the noise of
      the bell, and as a result, its energy was disturbed. Its innards were a
      mess as its energy caused chaos within; the centipede twirled round and
      round in a craze.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel, however, was not affected. Her body&#8217;s energy
      exuded a holy presence, and because of her purity, the bell could not deal
      damage to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the little angel still had to fight back the noise, and so
      couldn&#8217;t do anything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cough! Han Sen heaved another unhealthy amount of blood. His Dongxuan
      Sutra could just about manage to deal with the noise, but his fitness was
      lacking. As such, he couldn&#8217;t deal with it half as well as the
      little angel could.
    </p>

    <p>
      The adiraid was not a protector pet, so there was nothing she could do for
      Han Sen. So Han Sen continued to cough up blood with the feeling that his
      body was going to implode. He knew things weren&#8217;t going well, and
      his predicament was a dire one; he had to think of something!
    </p>

    <p>
      He was wearing his super armor, but it provided no resistance to the
      bell&#8217;s tolling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen&#8217;s mind flashed back to the berserk Devil Unicorn
      that had finished evolving. He summoned it before he considered whether or
      not it would even work.
    </p>

    <p>The black smoke whirled around Han Sen like a black hole.</p>

    <p>
      The sonic pulse pounded the black smoke, which caused a bit of it to
      evaporate. Its disappearance revealed Han Sen slightly, consumed by the
      protective smoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when the noise halted for a moment, the black smoke fully rejuvenated.
      It was like a shield, protecting Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the black smoke&#8217;s protection, Han Sen didn&#8217;t feel as
      affected by the tolling of the bell. Now, his Dongxuan Sutra was able to
      fight it. The discord of his energy began to simmer and settle down as the
      veins relaxed and returned to their ordinary size and shape beneath his
      skin.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s some good stuff.&#8221; Han Sen was overjoyed. He then
      thought to himself, &#8220;If the Devil Unicorn can block elemental
      attacks, does that mean the bell&#8217;s noise is a special sort of
      element itself?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

    <p>
      The blue bell rang another nine times. The noise felt as if it were
      rocking the entirety of the world. Those who heard it felt as if they
      could die any second.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood centipede had been writhing on the floor, and it consistently
      spewed blood from its mouth due to the discord in its body.
    </p>

    <p>
      After nine times, the bell stopped. There was no more noise. But that only
      led Han Sen to discover something even more frightening.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue bell was alive. It started flying, and looking set to crush Han
      Sen, it suddenly went right for him without cause.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the blue bell was a blue-metal chain, and at the bottom of the
      chain was a cone-shaped, blue-metal ringer. The ringer was the reason the
      bell had rung.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, Han Sen&#8217;s energy was no longer messed up and he could
      focus. Quickly, he jumped and rolled away, evading the blue bell that
      tried to land on top of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the bell was not as quick as he feared it might be, which
      allowed Han Sen to dodge the attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue bell missed Han Sen, but it didn&#8217;t try again. It
      immediately stopped going after Han Sen and went after the blood centipede
      instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bell spun around and around like a saucer as it went. When it arrived,
      the bell that was only as tall as a human morphed its shape. As it hovered
      above the writhing centipede, it expanded until it was large enough to
      consume the entire creature. Seeing this gave Han Sen the heebie jeebies.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The blue bell landed atop the twisting centipede, and then Han Sen heard
      noises come from within. He heard the centipede trying to fight its way
      out of the bell&#8217;s entrapment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The noise that emanated from the bell was not unlike the ringing he had
      heard earlier. Every tone was a shock, and Han Sen had only his Devil
      Unicorn to repel it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, it wasn&#8217;t half as effective as the noises from earlier,
      as it wasn&#8217;t a proper tolling. These noises were created by the
      panicked centipede, and as such, the Devil Unicorn could block each pulse
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen carefully observed the bell once more and did not see anything too
      strange. Many patterns, shapes, and symbols of bugs had been etched as
      adornments on the bell. As fascinating as they were, Han Sen had no idea
      what they meant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood centipede continued fighting on the inside for half an hour,
      until its noise gradually weakened. After another half an hour passed,
      there was no more movement to be heard, at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then finally saw the blue bell move again. It spun around in the
      air again before shrinking down to its initial size. When it was about as
      tall as a human again, it went for the little angel.
    </p>

    <p>
      From its time beneath the bell, the blood centipede had now become nothing
      but bones. It looked as if it had been dead for a good many yearsâ€”just
      like the bones Han Sen had seen earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the little angel wasn&#8217;t threatened. She dodged the incoming bell
      with ease and then smacked it heavily with her greatsword.
    </p>

    <p>
      A deep cleft was left in the bell&#8217;s side, which made the object
      squirm backwards and unleash more of its horrible tolling sounds. The
      little angel&#8217;s energy was messed up as a result, and she had to cast
      her energy-flow skill to ease it. She could not dodge the bell&#8217;s
      attack due to this, and all she saw was the bell spinning towards her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel hastened her cast and was able to quell her inner-turmoil
      and evade the bell&#8217;s strike with just enough time. Still, by
      exerting so much effort, her energy had become even more messed up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then decided to summon the little angel back to the Sea of Soul,
      which made the bell lose its target. But after the little angel
      disappeared, it did not turn its attention to Han Sen as it had
      previously. It merely flew back to the bell tower and reattached itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is that thing? Is that a super creature?&#8221; Han Sen was
      flabbergasted. Aside from that, he couldn&#8217;t think of what else it
      could have been.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had never heard of a super creature using bell noises to kill
      people before.
