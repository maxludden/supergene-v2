<p>“My poor Bao’er. She does not even get to see her birth mother.”
Han Sen sighed. He remained waiting in hiding, watching what was
going on outside the hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what items the God Chaos Party Leader had
left behind. He did not know what any of them were for. Judging
from the faces of Bury Path God and Ancient Devil, he knew they had
to be something special.</p>
<p>Aside from the free items they took away, there were at least a
hundred items left to take in the hidden hall. For as long as just
a few of them were worth something, they were enough to attract
people to commit crimes for them.</p>
<p>When a sword was drawn and a bowstring pulled, Ancient Devil
looked outside the hall.</p>
<p>“Ancient Devil, where are you going?” big sky demon asked.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil said, “Mister Leader gave me what I deserved. She
did not say she would give anything else to me, so they are not
mine to take.” He ignored their reaction. He left the hall and did
not touch anything more.</p>
<p>Bury Path God and big sky demon looked as if they were deep in
thought. They did not know if Ancient Devil wanted to leave now and
wait until they were injured before swooping in to mop up the
goodies or what. They weren’t sure if he had learned something the
others hadn’t either. They couldn’t be sure if he knew they weren’t
supposed to touch the items there or what.</p>
<p>Big sky demon looked at the items in the hall. She suddenly
laughed and said, “Ancient Devil is right. Mister Leader is like my
mother. She gave me all she could. If she did not give the items to
me, I should not take them. You can keep the items if you want
to.”</p>
<p>After that, big sky demon turned around and left the hall. Now,
only Bury Path God remained in the hall.</p>
<p>The situation seemed to be much improved, but Han Sen was still
secretly complimenting them. He thought Ancient Devil and big sky
demon were people who were tough to deal with.</p>
<p>They were afraid the God Chaos Leader had done something to the
other items, so they did not dare take them. That was why they
decided to leave. They deliberately left those things behind for
Bury Path God, so he could test their safety before them.</p>
<p>Even if Bury Path God took the items and nothing more happened,
he would not be able to use all of the items anyway.</p>
<p>Bury Path God seemed to know what Ancient Devil and big sky
demon were thinking, so he coldly grunted. “You guys might be
scared, but I am not scared. Whatever I get, no other can
take.”</p>
<p>Without hesitating, Bury Path God took the legacy items. He
spoke proudly, but he was still being extremely careful. He pulled
out a sword and carefully poked a wine barrel. He was really soft
and gentle.</p>
<p>The wine cask was picked up slowly. It came before Bury Path
God. Nothing else really happened. Bury Path God felt grand
relief.</p>
<p>Bury Path God then picked up the rest of the items. His sleeves
were like bottomless chasms in which anything could fit, all
without a modicum of trouble.</p>
<p>Bury Path God was being extremely careful when picking up all
these items. It had been half an hour by now. It was around then
that he finished collecting all the items and stuffing them into
his sleeves.</p>
<p>“Mister, putting the items in there is pointless. Why don’t you
let me use them all, so I can work harder for Little Master?” Bury
Path God bowed to the jade statue. He then took all of the items
and left the hall with them.</p>
<p>When Bury Path God left the hall, the copper door closed. Han
Sen wondered if he should leave, but he gave up on that idea. He
planned to leave via the rat hole.</p>
<p>Before the door closed shut, Han Sen heard Bury Path God coldly
shout, “Big sky demon, I knew you would do this!” Immediately
after, there was some scary striking sound.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. If this was in the past, he would have
liked to take the treasure too. Now, he had the gene seed. There
was no point in needlessly exposing himself.</p>
<p>God Chaos Party Leader said that item mattered to Bao’er’s life.
Without a gene seed, Bao’er might not survive. Han Sen only wanted
to bring the gene seed back to Bao’er safely and hoped nothing went
wrong.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The copper door completely closed. Han Sen was readying himself
to leave when he suddenly saw the jade statue possess a mysterious
halo. The jade statue, which had closed its eyes, suddenly opened
them again.</p>
<p>“Since you are here, why do you not come and meet me?” the jade
statue asked with a smile. Its eyes that looked like crystals were
peering at the rat hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. “This one is strong! It is just a remnant
of her soul, yet she made big sky demon and the other two be all
messed up. She had them believe the soul remnant was gone, but it
is actually still here. It is just a remnant of a soul, yet she was
able to find me. She is much better than big sky demon and the
other two people.”</p>
<p>“Cough! Ancient Devil was here. I did not want to reveal myself
and disturb the others.” Han Sen coughed and walked out of the rat
hole. He bowed before the jade statue.</p>
<p>The jade statue looked at Han Sen with interest. A while later,
she said, “You are good.”</p>
<p>“What?” Han Sen was shocked. The jade statue’s words did not
really make sense. He did not know how to respond to her.</p>
<p>“You are the one that raised my daughter, Han Sen. You are
Mister Han, yes?” The jade statue did not respond to Han Sen. She
merely smiled at him.</p>
<p>“I am Han Sen, but I am not really a mister.” Before the
greatest person in the universe, Han Sen did not want to sound
cocky.</p>
<p>“You did a good deed for my daughter, so, of course, you are
considered a mister. I should be thanking you a great deal.” After
pausing a moment, the jade statue said, “If you have a wish to
make, you can tell it to me, and I can fulfill it.”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could speak, the jade statue blinked. “But I am
just a soul. If it is something too hard, I may not be able to
satisfy you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head developed a lot of black lines. He did not think
this God Chaos Party Leader was this sort of person.</p>
<p>“I treat Bao’er like a real daughter,” Han Sen said. “I do not
need a wish, but there are a few problems I want to quiz you
about.”</p>
<p>“You may speak,” the jade statue nodded.</p>
<p>“Why do you say Bao’er won’t live without a gene seed? And why
must that person fight Bao’er?” Han Sen asked her the questions he
cared about the most.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen really hated this. The so-called destiny was
just an elder’s wish forced down on their inheritors. As Bao’er’s
mother, the God Chaos Party should not have shouldered Bao’er with
so much.</p>
<p>The jade statue looked at Han Sen with surprise and sighed.
“Bao’er was raised by you. It is her pleasure. It was my luck
too.”</p>
<p>After pausing, the jade statue sighed and said, “I do not want
Bao’er to fight him. If he knows Bao’er is my daughter, he will
look for a way to kill her. As a mother, I want my child to live a
happy life. Why would I want her to fight other people?”</p>
