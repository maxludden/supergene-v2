  “Little girl, do not joke around with me. I will have you know that I am old and cannot be scared like this, lest it bodes poorly for my health. I think it would be best if you move with haste. After you have done that, I will happily take you on a trip to buy some candy.” Sky King was shocked, but his face still displayed a smile. He had not been this soft in many, many years.

“I see. In that case, okay, I think I can do that.” Bao’er nodded. She held the flying fish as if she was going to have it retreat.

Sky King was delighted. Once the flying fish exited his proximity and the little girl turned around, he could get free of the flying fish’s lock on him, break space, and escape it.

Even if the flying fish caught up, it was going to be hard to lock onto him. He could certainly find a way to escape the pursuit of the flying fish. The feeling of being on the cusp of death for so long was not an easy one to endure.

Seeing Bao’er hold the flying fish and turn around, Sky King’s heart felt excited. As the little girl was about to turn around, Sky King gathered up all the power in his body. He was ready to break space and flee.

The power in his body almost burst out, but the little girl suddenly turned around. The flying fish got closer to Sky King again.

Sky King felt as if he wanted to vomit. He held onto the power, which was almost bursting out. He let himself stay where he was. His face was becoming red.

The little girl looked at Sky King with an untrusting expression as she asked, “You are not going to lie to me, are you? Are you going to run away as soon as I turn around?”

Sky King had been through many things. Now, he could not help but blush. He had planned on doing that, but he was Sky King. He was now going to lie to a little girl. His plan had been exposed. His emotions were very complex.

“Why would I…? I have been very honest. I mean what I say.” Sky King immediately explained himself.

“Yes, but the thing is that adults always lie. They never stop. So how exactly am I supposed to know whether or not you’re the same? What if you are lying to me like all the others do?” The little girl continued to stare at Sky King untrustingly.

Sky King was in a hurry to get out of there, but there was nothing he could do. The flying fish kept staring at him, locked onto his presence. have you know that I am old and cannot be scared like this, lest it bodes poorly for my health.

no

Sky King had been through many things. Now, he could not help but blush. He had planned on doing that, but he was Sky King. He was now going to lie to a little girl. His plan had been exposed. His emotions were very complex. “Why would I…? I have been very honest. I mean what I say.” Sky King immediately explained himself.

“Yes, but the thing is that adults always lie. They never stop. So how exactly am I supposed to know whether or not you’re the same? What if you are lying to me like all the others do?” The little girl continued to stare at Sky King untrustingly. Sky King was in a hurry to get out of there, but there was nothing he could do. The flying fish kept staring at him, locked onto his presence. If he did something suspicious, it would launch the scariest attack yet. Sky King did not dare risk inciting that ire.

If he did not move, the flying fish could not do anything to him. If he moved, and there was a flaw, he would end up either severely injured or dead.

“Little girl, I swear I am not lying to you. You should just take that thing away. I will give you lots of money if you do that. I can guarantee you a life of luxury. You will live in wealth and be able to buy many, many fashionable articles of clothing and glam yourself up with eye-blinding jewelry.” It had been so long since a woman had put Sky King at a disadvantage. At this point, he was tempted enough to pick up the little girl and run.

The little girl examined him a bit closer. She pointed at one of Sky King’s items and said, “I do not know what money is, and I do not know how to use it. How about this? I think that looks quite pretty. Why don’t you give it to me?”

Sky King was clad in a host of tattered clothing. His chest had a lot of burn marks on it, so he could not hide his body. She was able to see the jade-like pendant he was wearing.

The jade was circular. It had a tai chi symbol that was half white and half black. It was not particularly pretty, but it exuded a sense of mystery and age.

Seeing that the little girl wanted his jade pendant, Sky King’s expression changed. That jade item was very important. It took him a lot of effort to claim. It was an item he dug up from a scary life pulse. It had the power to suppress a land pulse.

He had dared to travel to the core alone because of that item. In a critical moment, it meant the difference between life and death.

That was not the most important facet of the pendant. That jade represented his identity as Sky King. Many of his friends, allies, and even the big nobles of the Qin Kingdom recognized that jade. When they had something classified to do, he simply allowed his men to use the jade. With that jade, people treated a person with great priority.

Things like that stood for his identity as Sky King. He could not just give it out to someone random.

“Little girl, this is cheap and not worth much,” Sky King said with a smile. “Why don’t you select something else?”

“Yes, Mother taught me not to take just any random stuff, especially expensive stuff,” the little girl said with seriousness. “Cheap is good. I will take it.”

“Didn’t your mother teach you not to take a random person’s things?” Sky King could not help but fight back.

“Yes, but my dad told me I should take advantage of stupid people,” the little girl said with a laugh. “I always have to balance who I listen to between my mother and my father.”

Sky King almost coughed up blood. He swore in his heart. “Who is this asshole father of hers? How could he teach his child to behave like that? Damn it!”

“Old Uncle, are you going to lie to me? Are you not going to give it to me?” The little girl looked at Sky King with confusion.

Sky King gnashed his teeth and looked stiff as he laughed. “How could I do such a thing? This thing is not worth much. If you like it, I will happily give it to you. But first, you need to…”

Before Sky King finished, the little girl merrily proclaimed, “Thank you, Old Uncle! You are such a nice person.”

After that, the little girl let go of the flying fish. It went behind Sky King and jumped on his back. It took the necklace off of his body.

Sky King’s eyes were twitching, but he did not move. He let the little girl take the necklace away.

The little girl received the jade and proceeded to wear it around her neck. She looked at Sky King, waved the jade, and said, “Old Uncle, does it look good on me?”

“It looks good. It looks very good. You are so beautiful. You would look beautiful no matter what you were wearing.” It had been so long since Sky King had last complimented someone in such a fashion.

With his identity, if he liked a woman, he only just had to say the word. He never made the effort to please them.

Seeing that the little girl was so happy, Sky King quickly said, “I gave you my stuff. Could you send the flying fish away now? I am so scared seeing it.”

“Okay.” The little girl was going to put away the flying fish, but someone walked next to it.

When the little girl saw that person, she was shocked and happy. She ran straight to him. She happily jumped into that person’s arms and said, “Dad.”

Sky King’s hope was depleted once more. His chest hurt. He heard the little girl call out for her dad. He looked over and thought, “I want to see who can raise such an asshole kid. I will lock him up in a cell 24/7. I will teach him how to be polite. If he can’t learn, I will smack him across the face until he does. He needs to know how to be respectful and not teach his child to be a delinquent.”

When he saw who that person was, his heart jumped. It was a man who looked to be in his twenties. He had never seen him before, but he knew who he was.

As one of the Qin Kingdom’s high-class people, if he didn’t know about an event as big as Steel Scene being murdered, his title of a king would have been worthless.

Sky King had watched Han Sen’s videotape once before, and he had analyzed Han Sen.

Han Sen was really tight with the crown prince. If the crown prince were to be the successor, Han Sen would be a great friend of the king. Sky King did not care for Han Sen, but he had to treat the future king nicely. He was a character that could sway the direction of Sky King’s life.
