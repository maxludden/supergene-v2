<p>Picking the right human to give a Blood-Pulse to was like
venture capitalizing. It depended on whether or not one had good
eyesight. One also needed variety. If one or two humans were able
to develop quite well in the future, benefits could be reaped.</p>
<p>It was a shame the God of Wealth Temple was there. Not many
humans were able to go there. The places Han Sen could select were
minimal, which made him feel quite depressed.</p>
<p>For things like god temples, once one was established in a
place, it could no longer be moved. An example was Feather Fairy’s
god temple. Almost no humans traveled there, but Feather Fairy had
to stay where he was. He was unable to relocate his temple, so he
had to make do with where it was.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how Mister God moved the God of Wealth
Temple there, but he knew he could not move it.</p>
<p>Han Sen discovered something interesting from the information he
had just learned. In one god temple, it was not just one spirit
that could be there.</p>
<p>The god temple did not determine the number of God Spirits
allowed. It was the god base in a god temple.</p>
<p>Because a default god temple only had one god base, it could
only allow one God Spirit. If there were more god bases, a god
temple could harbor more God Spirits. The higher the level the god
temples were, the more God Spirits that it could have.</p>
<p>A Destroyed god temple could only have one main god and two sub
gods. A Disaster god temple allowed for one main god and four sub
gods. An Annihilation god temple could have one main god and eight
sub gods.</p>
<p>Every god temple could only have one main god, which meant that
all the sub gods had to adhere to the will of the main god. To get
sub gods, the main god had to acquire god bases. Thus, not many god
temples had sub gods. Ordinary sub gods were usually wild gods.</p>
<p>By having more sub gods, the god temple had more godly
authority.</p>
<p>For example, Han Sen’s God of Wealth Temple, which he had
authored Wealth, was able to enlist a fire sub god. The god temple
could then be authored Fire.</p>
<p>The sub god could also protect the god temple so it was not
affected by the powers of the outside world. Even if Han Sen was
not in the temple, he did not have to fear the god temple being
brought down.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried bringing out Decapitation Queen’s god base and
putting it down in his God of Wealth Temple. The god base flew to
the side of the hall. It formed a new god altar in its corner.</p>
<p>At the same time, Han Sen felt weird power come from the Sky God
Crown. It made the Sky God Crown much stronger.</p>
<p>The guillotine and Decapitation Queen were next to the god
altar. Seeing Han Sen come before her, Decapitation Queen kneeled
before him.</p>
<p>“Small God greeting the Mister,” Decapitation Queen said. This
was the god base, so she had no memory of her past life as
Decapitation Queen. She also didn’t seem to have a will of her own.
Like Han Yufei had described, this was a new spirit. The appearance
and power were the same as the old Decapitation Queen, but it was a
brand-new lifeform.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Decapitation Queen and immediately checked out
her information.</p>
<p>Decapitation Queen: Annihilation God Spirit (God of Wealth
Temple sub god)</p>
<p>God Authority: Death Sentence</p>
<p>God Power: Guillotine</p>
<p>Han Sen told Decapitation Queen to massage his back.
Decapitation Queen did not resist. She was like a slave and willing
to do everything he wanted her to do.</p>
<p>One thing Han Sen did not like was that the god temple did not
provide him access to the geno universe. It was like Qin Jun or Sky
God. The God Spirits of god temples could enter the geno universe
for a set amount of time, and there were many restrictions. It was
the same for Han Sen entering the geno universe as God of Wealth.
He could not hurt any creature, and he needed to keep the geno
universe as it was. Even if he destroyed a stone or a piece of
wood, he was punished.</p>
<p>In fact, even if God Spirits wanted to hurt the geno universe,
it was impossible for them to do so. The power of God Spirits was
restricted there. Unless they were in a god temple, their power
would accomplish nothing on the creatures of the geno universe. Of
course, if the creatures of the geno universe made a wish to them,
that was a different story entirely. Through the process of making
a wish, they could use power and not be restricted. They could
control them.</p>
<p>Han Sen calculated that he needed another two months before
entering the geno universe, and he could only stay for four
days.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and thought, “Why do God Spirits in the geno
universe have more restrictions than in the universe of kingdoms?
Why are the creatures of the geno universe not like the humans of
the universe of kingdoms? They do not get blessed by God Spirits,
and they cannot be combined with God Spirits.”</p>
<p>There was a big difference in the way the two universes
operated. Han Sen knew it had to mean something.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu had been guarding outside the gene god temple. Bald
Guy asked Li Bing Yu, “Ghost Kill, do you think the god temple
belongs to the God Chaos Party?”</p>
<p>“I do not know,” Li Bing Yu said with a shake of her head.</p>
<p>She had only learned about them from Wu Wei Dao Palace. She had
read books about the God Chaos Party.</p>
<p>The members of the God Chaos Party were usually some very
powerful, wild God Spirits. They killed the main gods to earn God
Spirits. They disturbed the flow of things in the universe. They
were very much like outlaws.</p>
<p>Back in the old times, the God Chaos Party was very powerful. It
had almost replaced the sky full of main God Spirits to create a
new god kingdom.</p>
<p>In the end, the God Spirits beat them. They vanished down the
river of time. If it was not for Wu Wei Dao Palace having such a
large vault of historical records, the God Chaos Party would have
long been forgotten.</p>
<p>When the God Chaos Party was in its prime, there were not seven
kingdoms yet. Decapitation Queen was one member of the God Chaos
Party. Li Bing Yu had casually read a book about it. There were two
or three sentences that referenced Decapitation Queen. Due to there
being such a small amount, she did not remember too much.</p>
<p>While they were both feeling restless, the door to the god
temple suddenly opened. Han Sen came out from the god temple in
perfect shape.</p>
<p>Bald Guy ran up and asked, “Old Han, are you OK?”</p>
<p>“I am fine,” Han Sen said with a smile. “This god temple was
opened by my old friend. He invited me in for a chat, but I’ve
finished now.”</p>
<p>“Are you a friend of a God Spirit?” Bald Guy asked Han Sen in
shock.</p>
<p>He thought there was going to be a fight, but Han Sen had
actually gone in to chat with a God Spirit.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen said with a smile. “This god temple’s main god is
God of Wealth. He is my brother. If you want to change your God
Spirit Blood-Pulse, just go in and say hello. I promise you a
complete God of Wealth Blood-Pulse.”</p>
<p>Bald Guy sounded excited as he asked, “What element is God of
Wealth? What kind of god authority does it have?”.</p>
<p>“The God of Wealth is a wealth element god,” Han Sen happily
said. “It has a wealth god authority. If you have a God of Wealth
Blood-Pulse, you will be extremely rich.” God Spirits did not give
out Blood – Pulses easily, but it did not mean they did not have to
give them out at all. They needed humans to have their God Spirit
Blood-Pulses so they could go on and do things. That way, their God
Spirits and god temples would become stronger.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to go back. He was going to give Feng Yin Yin,
the genius little girl, to the God of Wealth. He was sure she would
achieve a lot. She would benefit from the God of Wealth Temple.</p>
