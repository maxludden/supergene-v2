    <p>
      In the next two days, more and more powerful creatures entered Sunset
      Valley, and from time to time members of Illusion sent messages back and
      forth. The activity in the valley continued to increase, and it seemed
      that the Death Goddess should be very close to here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not enter the valley. The people on both sides had nothing to
      do with him. When the fighting started, Han Sen would kill his enemies and
      leave. He didn’t care much about anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day, Han Sen saw the Illusion Elder and three other alphas
      take their people out of the valley. The expressions of all the creatures
      were very dignified, and they looked like they were facing a major enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems that Death Goddess is coming soon.” Han Sen’s gaze also followed
      them to the distant mountains, and a dark spot gradually appeared on the
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because she wasn’t moving very fast, it was a long time before Han Sen
      could see the true appearance of the black spot
    </p>
    <p>
      Her black hair was like a waterfall. She wore black armor with a pair of
      crow-like black wings behind her. Holding a black bow and arrow in her
      hand, she looked like an archer from hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Han Sen’s focus wasn’t on her weapons. The delicate facial
      features looked exactly the same as when Han Sen first saw them, but the
      eyes were not as hollow as before. The black eyes were bright and pure,
      and Han Sen could not see through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a person only looked at her eyes, she would never remind anyone of the
      Death Goddess that terrified everyone in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Death Goddess, even the Illusion Elder was intimidated. Despite
      their preparations, Death Goddess’s face still made the gathered elites
      feel a little uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Illusion Elder waved slightly, and all the elites moved to their
      assigned positions and turned toward the entrance of Sunset Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient mirror was the only thing that gave the Illusion Elder the
      confidence to attempt to kill Death Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, Death Goddess’ arrows might wipe out their forces before they
      even got close enough to kill her. That would be too much of a risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with this mirror, they didn’t have to be afraid of her. When the
      Emperor of Heaven used this mirror to roam the Fourth Sanctuary in ancient
      times, no one could hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Emperor of Heaven hadn’t failed to advance to the Fifth Sanctuary,
      the Ancient Sky Mirror wouldn’t have been left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, because the attributes of the Ancient Sky Mirror were so special,
      only elites with the same attributes could use it. That was why the
      Illusion Elder chose Sunset Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a Moon Spring in Sunset Valley, and the power contained in the
      Moon Spring was the same as that of the Ancient Sky Mirror. The Illusion
      Elder used the power of the Moon Spring to operate the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elites invited by the Illusion Elder knew the power of the Ancient Sky
      Mirror, so even if it was a powerful being like Death Goddess, they were
      not afraid. All of them summoned their courage and prepared for the
      battle. They were keen to fight Death Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw those great beings with full confidence. He had some doubts.
      It was reasonable to expect that some of the elders might escape the
      conning battle with their lives, but it seemed like even the less powerful
      creatures were quite confident That was slightly surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess had killed one of the ten Son of God’s with a single arrow.
      They wouldn’t have much time to deal with Death Goddess, as they might be
      killed instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the role of the Ancient Sky Mirror? How will it let them face
      Death Goddess?” Han Sen blinked and looked into the depths of Sunset
      Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several groups of people nearby. Apparently, they had been sent
      by the Illusion Elder to monitor him. Han Sen now had no chance to sneak
      into Sunset Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Death Goddess was coming closer, many creatures held their
      breath, and their hearts were slightly uneasy. It was one thing to have
      confidence, but Death Goddess’s previous kills were too scary. It was
      normal to be anxious when facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had retreated, and each one summoned a geno core as they waited. It
      seemed that they had made up their minds to fight Death Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Death Goddess had entered the vicinity of Sunset Valley, the
      Illusion Elder screamed, “Death Goddess, if you swear to follow me now, I
      can still let you live today. Otherwise, today you will die.”
    </p>
    <p>Everyone looked at Death Goddess and waited for her response.</p>
    <p>
      While everyone was keen to see Death Goddess, Han Sen was actually the
      most curious. He was the only one who knew the true origin of Death
      Goddess, but the current Death Goddess was somewhat strange to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess was the descendant of Sacred’s master and Destroyer Empress,
      and so the power in her body had been inherited from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to examine Death Goddess for a
      long time, and he didn’t feel both god power and death power in her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess wasn’t hiding her power. Han Sen could clearly feel her
      strong lifeforce, but her lifeforce didn’t seem to be tinged by Sacred
      power or death. Instead, Han Sen felt that the power was familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No wonder the Sacred elites can’t tell where she came from. This power
      doesn’t seem to be related to Sacred’s master or Destroyer Empress at
      all.” Han Sen looked at her, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she was the one who had hatched from the egg, but why would
      her power look like this? Han Sen had no clue. His sense of familiarity
      was just a feeling, as Death Goddess’s power was something he had never
      seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was understandable that Han Sen didn’t immediately recognize the traces
      of his own power in Death Goddess. Death Goddess had the abilities of
      destruction and death, but because of the unexpected introduction of Han
      Sen’s blood, the two forces had merged into a new force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of this new power belonged to Han Sen, so it felt familiar, but
      nothing more. The combination of the three forces kept this power from
      feeling like any of the original ones, so Han Sen couldn’t sense it in
      detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the creatures were staring at Death Goddess, waiting for her answer,
      and waiting for her to enter a certain range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since they had to use the Moon Spring to operate the Ancient Sky Mirror,
      there was no way to change the location at which they would spring the
      attack. The scope of the mirror was limited, and they had to be within
      this range to attack Death Goddess; otherwise, they wouldn’t be protected
      by the Ancient Sky Mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death Goddess did not give a d*mn about the Illusion Elder, and she
      completely ignored the alphas and elites as if they did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw that Death Goddess had flown straight toward him. He couldn’t
      help but sigh. “Will this one remember me and want to take some sort of
      revenge?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Han Sen could act, Death Goddess had already flown over to him and
      gathered her wings to land. She looked at Han Sen with a pair of pure eyes
      and shouted, “Father!”
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time, all the creatures in Sunset Valley had their eyes wide open,
      including Han Sen himself.
