<h3>Chapter 1759</h3>

<p>The Archangel Bone Arrow’s power had drilled into Han Sen,
pinning him in place. He could not move, nor even make his body
levitate.</p>
<p>As he was being suppressed by this power, Han Sen activated a
talent he had. His cells came alive, unleashing an unimaginable
force. Every cell was lit up by a holy light, covering Han Sen in
fire. It was like he was being reborn.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a familiar power course through his body, as a
sense of control started to return.</p>
<p>After he left the sanctuary, he had been unable to make use of
his super king spirit body. His super king spirit mode had now been
triggered by the Archangel Bone Arrow, though.</p>
<p>The moment he entered super king spirit mode, the bone arrow’s
effects disappeared. In the geno universe, super king spirit’s
indestructibility was still there in full-force. It was not gone
because of the bone arrow.</p>
<p>The Archangel Bone Arrow did not work against Han Sen’s super
king spirit mode, but the bone arrow’s strength was still there. It
was like a sword inside Han Sen’s body, trying to crack all his
bones.</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s physical strength, he could not withstand the
bone arrow.</p>
<p>Xina could only use ten to twenty percent of the bone arrow’s
power. Perhaps not even that much. But the king class xenogeneic
material was something no Baron body could block.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the bone arrow from the front and tried to lift
it out of his chest. It felt as if it was stuck inside his own
bones, though. He almost ended up breaking his own bones as he
pulled at the arrow.</p>
<p>Xina looked at Han Sen, blazing with fire, and she laughed
callously. “Your powers are strong, stronger than I realized. You
are a rare sort. But before the bone arrow, even Barons are
injured. I could not use all the arrow’s strength, but even so, a
Baron like you will die. And the more you struggle, the more power
you draw from the arrow. The more pain you will incur.”</p>
<p>Han Sen just ignored her. His holy light beamed brighter,
incinerating the things around him. He was like a rod of red-hot
steel, going transparent.</p>
<p>Xina frowned. Her wings became gold, webbed with a bony
skeleton. She herself was growing stronger.</p>
<p>Xina was a xenogeneic, too. And she was a Viscount, to top it
off. After transforming, her power was like a tide.</p>
<p>“Since you are dying, anyway, the least I can do is make it pass
quickly.” Xina raised her arms and pointed them at Han Sen. Her
fingertips were illuminated by a golden light. The point of light
was very thin and sharp, like a diamond needle.</p>
<p>Looking at the light, it felt like space itself could be
shredded.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The cold light was like a laser. It fired towards Han Sen’s
forehead.</p>
<p>When the light was about to shoot through Han Sen’s head, he let
out a roar. The holy light was like a wildly fanned fire. It was
like a volcano, and Han Sen’s flesh was being refined. It was
rising alongside the holy light.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body burned like glass, making him glow and become
half-transparent.</p>
<p>Xina’s golden light pierced through Han Sen’s forehead. It then
came out through the other side of his head. It touched down on a
lotus petal and broke through it.</p>
<p>Xina did not immediately relax after seeing that happen, though.
She looked grim, instead. She could only stare at Han Sen.</p>
<p>A Viscount xenogeneic’s strike had pierced through Han Sen’s
head, but it had not dealt him any damage. The half- transparent
body was like a lake. The attack’s trajectory may have led through
Han Sen’s head, but it left no mark of damage.</p>
<p>The Archangel Bone Arrow in Han Sen’s chest lost its grip. The
power disappeared from it, and it started to slide out of him.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the bone arrow and pulled it out. Then, the bone
arrow was in Han Sen’s hand. It had been touched by a holy light
and it was glowing again. It was stronger than when it had been
used to kill Ghost Eye and shoot through Han Sen’s chest.</p>
<p>Xina was shocked, and she could not believe what she was seeing.
The bone arrow was activated, and the power was stronger than what
she possessed.</p>
<p>Xina’s mouth hung open. That bone belonged to the Feathers, and
without Feather blood, you should have been hurt by merely touching
the item.</p>
<p>Han Sen was an outsider, and yet he had managed to successfully
activate the bone arrow’s power. And the power was more than she
was able to use, on top of that.</p>
<p>The bone arrow’s powers were still rising, and the energy of the
holy light was making the entire environment tremble.</p>
<p>Xina’s face changed, and she tried to fly away. She flew a few
hundred meters, heading for the exit.</p>
<p>Xina knew just how frightening the bone arrow could be, but for
some reason, it had been activated by Han Sen. It wasn’t just ten
percent, either. So, if the bone arrow hit her, there’d be nothing
she could do to block. She wanted to leave the thing’s effective
range.</p>
<p>Seeing Xina flying away, Han Sen wasn’t keen on giving chase.
Soon, she was only a black dot far above.</p>
<p>“Super king spirit mode evolution complete”</p>
<p>An announcement played inside Han Sen’s head. He looked down and
observed his body as if he were a god. He then summoned the gold
feather bow in his hands.</p>
<p>He nocked the bone arrow on the string, aimed up, and pulled the
string back. When it was pulled as far as it could go, Han Sen’s
eyes froze, and his fingers released the string. A holy light
flashed through the sky, breaking the darkness that had claimed
it.</p>
