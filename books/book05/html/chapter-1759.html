	<p>The Archangel Bone Arrow’s power had drilled into Han Sen, pinning him in place. He could not move, nor even make
		his body levitate.</p>

	<p>As he was being suppressed by this power, Han Sen activated a talent he had. His cells came alive, unleashing an
		unimaginable force. Every cell was lit up by a holy light, covering Han Sen in fire. It was like he was being
		reborn.</p>

	<p>Han Sen felt a familiar power course through his body, as a sense of control started to return.</p>

	<p>After he left the sanctuary, he had been unable to make use of his super king spirit body. His super king spirit
		mode had now been triggered by the Archangel Bone Arrow, though.</p>

	<p>The moment he entered super king spirit mode, the bone arrow’s effects disappeared. In the geno universe, super
		king spirit’s indestructibility was still there in full-force. It was not gone because of the bone arrow.</p>

	<p>The Archangel Bone Arrow did not work against Han Sen’s super king spirit mode, but the bone arrow’s strength was
		still there. It was like a sword inside Han Sen’s body, trying to crack all his bones.</p>

	<p>With Han Sen’s physical strength, he could not withstand the bone arrow.</p>

	<p>Xina could only use ten to twenty percent of the bone arrow’s power. Perhaps not even that much. But the king
		class xenogeneic material was something no Baron body could block.</p>

	<p>Han Sen grabbed the bone arrow from the front and tried to lift it out of his chest. It felt as if it was stuck
		inside his own bones, though. He almost ended up breaking his own bones as he pulled at the arrow.</p>

	<p>Xina looked at Han Sen, blazing with fire, and she laughed callously. “Your powers are strong, stronger than I
		realized. You are a rare sort. But before the bone arrow, even Barons are injured. I could not use all the
		arrow’s strength, but even so, a Baron like you will die. And the more you struggle, the more power you draw
		from the arrow. The more pain you will incur.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen just ignored her. His holy light beamed brighter, incinerating the things around him. He was like a rod
		of red-hot steel, going transparent.</p>

	<p>Xina frowned. Her wings became gold, webbed with a bony skeleton. She herself was growing stronger.</p>

	<p>Xina was a xenogeneic, too. And she was a Viscount, to top it off. After transforming, her power was like a tide.
	</p>

	<p>“Since you are dying, anyway, the least I can do is make it pass quickly.” Xina raised her arms and pointed them
		at Han Sen. Her fingertips were illuminated by a golden light. The point of light was very thin and sharp, like
		a diamond needle.</p>

	<p>Looking at the light, it felt like space itself could be shredded.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The cold light was like a laser. It fired towards Han Sen’s forehead.</p>

	<p>When the light was about to shoot through Han Sen’s head, he let out a roar. The holy light was like a wildly
		fanned fire. It was like a volcano, and Han Sen’s flesh was being refined. It was rising alongside the holy
		light.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s body burned like glass, making him glow and become half-transparent.</p>

	<p>Xina’s golden light pierced through Han Sen’s forehead. It then came out through the other side of his head. It
		touched down on a lotus petal and broke through it.</p>

	<p>Xina did not immediately relax after seeing that happen, though. She looked grim, instead. She could only stare
		at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>A Viscount xenogeneic’s strike had pierced through Han Sen’s head, but it had not dealt him any damage. The half-
		transparent body was like a lake. The attack’s trajectory may have led through Han Sen’s head, but it left no
		mark of damage.</p>

	<p>The Archangel Bone Arrow in Han Sen’s chest lost its grip. The power disappeared from it, and it started to slide
		out of him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen grabbed the bone arrow and pulled it out. Then, the bone arrow was in Han Sen’s hand. It had been touched
		by a holy light and it was glowing again. It was stronger than when it had been used to kill Ghost Eye and shoot
		through Han Sen’s chest.</p>

	<p>Xina was shocked, and she could not believe what she was seeing. The bone arrow was activated, and the power was
		stronger than what she possessed.</p>

	<p>Xina’s mouth hung open. That bone belonged to the Feathers, and without Feather blood, you should have been hurt
		by merely touching the item.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was an outsider, and yet he had managed to successfully activate the bone arrow’s power. And the power
		was more than she was able to use, on top of that.</p>

	<p>The bone arrow’s powers were still rising, and the energy of the holy light was making the entire environment
		tremble.</p>

	<p>Xina’s face changed, and she tried to fly away. She flew a few hundred meters, heading for the exit.</p>

	<p>Xina knew just how frightening the bone arrow could be, but for some reason, it had been activated by Han Sen. It
		wasn’t just ten percent, either. So, if the bone arrow hit her, there’d be nothing she could do to block. She
		wanted to leave the thing’s effective range.</p>

	<p>Seeing Xina flying away, Han Sen wasn’t keen on giving chase. Soon, she was only a black dot far above.</p>

	<p>“Super king spirit mode evolution complete”</p>

	<p>An announcement played inside Han Sen’s head. He looked down and observed his body as if he were a god. He then
		summoned the gold feather bow in his hands.</p>

	<p>He nocked the bone arrow on the string, aimed up, and pulled the string back. When it was pulled as far as it
		could go, Han Sen’s eyes froze, and his fingers released the string. A holy light flashed through the sky,
		breaking the darkness that had claimed it.</p>
