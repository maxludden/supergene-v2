    <p>
      Han Sen believed going up against Six Paths’ Life Sword would be
      difficult. After all, Life Sword resided at the heart of Six Paths. It was
      his essence. If you took away the limitations of skills, all he had left
      was primitive drive.
    </p>
    <p>Six Paths’ sword skills, when cast, were something scary to behold.</p>
    <p>
      This would be the sixth sword skill, and it was the only one from the set
      Han Sen had heard about, but not actually seen in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t that Six Paths did not want to show it to Han Sen, it was just
      that Life Sword was something of a personal achievement to learn. It was
      pointless to simply see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen knew it was strong. He just didn’t know how strong. And now
      that he could see it, he was getting a feel for its power. It wasn’t as
      threatening as Blood Sword, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      A battle that was based on reactions and strength was something Han Sen
      was good at. That was what he did before he amassed an array of hyper geno
      arts, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths had learned a lot, but Han Sen’s combat abilities weren’t
      anything modest. He also had the advantage of the Dongxuan Aura. It would
      be an advantage that lent itself to any of his fights.
    </p>
    <p>Seeing Dollar suppressing Six Paths, the audience was all in shock.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen kept flicking his fingers until Six Paths inevitably had to fall
      back. He couldn’t fight him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fingers of his opponent were so sharp. The Six Paths Sword was soon
      delivered a deep scratch.
    </p>
    <p>“Scary. Too scary! Who is this Dollar?”</p>
    <p>“Dollar is good! This is the rhythm to beating Six Paths.”</p>
    <p>“Strong! He is strong! He is my idol!”</p>
    <p>
      Some of the demigods who weren’t as talented hadn’t been able to tell what
      they were seeing before, but this bit was plain for all to understand. Six
      Paths had been suppressed by his opponent and couldn’t fight back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Six Paths incur more wounds across his body, Sacred Emperor
      frowned. “Is Six Paths Emperor going to lose?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng’s expression was complicated. “It looks like Six Paths is
      going to lose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen did not think this. Six Paths had used all six of his sword
      skills and had ended up suppressed, yes, but Han Sen didn’t think it was
      going to be an easy win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths’ eyes were still brimming with clarity and the fire of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was doing something that was akin to damming a river with mud, or
      throwing rocks onto a spreading fire. It seemed useful, but there was that
      constant worry that it was only a matter of time before the containment
      was rendered useless in a sudden outburst of power that been held back and
      built up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew he couldn’t stop. He attacked faster and faster with the
      desire to kill Six Paths before the sudden frenzy could manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood was spilling and bones were breaking. Six Paths’ wounds were getting
      worse, but despite all that, his eyes shone brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Six Paths relaxed his body, Han Sen felt as if he had just gone
      eye-to-eye with a viper. He stumbled back with goosebumps. He looked at
      Six Paths, who was covered in blood and still standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was still clutching his sword, but the tip was low against the
      ground. The swordminds were all gone, and he looked like someone who had
      forgotten how to use the blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you. Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to reach this step.”
      Six Paths looked at Han Sen with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen just looked back at Six Paths without saying anything. The spirit
      still looked like an ordinary person, but there was a sudden aura of
      danger. Han Sen hadn’t felt this level of danger before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a reward, please accept my final sword.” Six Paths said this right
      before lifting Six Paths Sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he raised that sword, it felt as if all the power in the world was
      now coming down on Han Sen. It was as if the sword was at the center of
      the universe, and everything existed around it.
    </p>
    <p>“Six Paths in one?” Han Sen looked surprised.</p>
    <p>
      Heart Sword was about wielder’s true self. Sky Sword was about the sky and
      the earth. Sonic Sword was about the acoustical powers. Spirit was about
      the spirit. Blood Sword was all about living. Life Sword was about
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they all combined into one, it made Six Paths become a part of the
      world itself. Like a true swordmaster, his sword became the center of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The power he had gathered up was too much, and the unbreakable arena was
      actually shattered. The sword created a giant crater in the ground, as the
      previously standing Six Paths was lifted into the air to float above the
      ground. The entire power was gathered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience was in shock. They noticed that all their powers had been
      magnetized towards Six Paths. It felt as if they themselves were going to
      be processed into the sword he wielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the audience quickly cast skills to prevent power leakage, but
      many of the weaker beings were unable to do this, and they found their
      energy stolen and pulled into the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong spirits could stop this from happening naturally. But that had
      to be possible; otherwise, none would have been able to watch the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Six Paths is becoming a god!” Outer Sky leader looked at Six Paths like
      an unrivaled swordmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the other elites were shocked, too. “After this fight, Six Paths
      is sure to become a god very soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t believe he is breaking through now. Six Paths is on the verge of
      becoming a god. Dollar is in trouble.” Gu Qingcheng looked glum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu looked to be in shock, and he couldn’t even find the words to
      speak. Simply seeing it all through the Martial Hall’s tablet was enough
      to make him feel suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am the sword. The sword is me. A sword can traverse six paths and
      become one.” When Six Paths pointed his sword to the sky, his power had
      reached maximum capacity. The way he spoke made it sound as if he was a
      god, and it frightened all those who listened. Creatures that had weak
      minds were already prepared to obey him, as if he truly was a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures with strong wills could feel the pressure, as well, and they
      felt as if they wanted to throw up because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Six Paths swung his sword. A swordlight was cast through the
      arena, covering it in its entirety. All in its proximity were swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment, Six Paths was like a god that could not be beaten.
      Everyone believed that it was now the end.
