<p>Seeing the 24-stroke geno spell light up, Han Sen was not happy. He did not know if the 24-stroke password would even work.</p>

<p>The skeleton that was latched onto Han Sen saw the 24 symbols light up. It lost its voice and screamed, “How do you know the 24-stroke light spell?”</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Han Sen discovered the 24-stroke geno spell was like 24 fires. They lit up the stars around. The fires followed the wire that looked like it was there but was not there. It spread to the other stars.</p>

<p>In a moment, the whole sea of stars was ignited. Many glowing stars were thrown out of orbit. The entire sea of stars was like it had been flipped over. It led to some unbelievable changes.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought the skeleton that had chained him up was losing its hold on him a bit. He exerted strength to struggle and escape the clutch of the skeleton. He was going to the sea of stars.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because the sea of stars had lost control, but this time, when Han Sen went out, he appeared outside the geno tablet.</p>

<p>What happened outside did not make Han Sen happy. Outside the geno tablet, the sea of clouds in the 33rd sky was tumultuous. They were madly waving. The geno tablet was glowing more holy than ever. It was so bright that one could hardly see it.</p>

<p>Space around looked like it was falling apart. It was more shocking than Han Sen using the Dongxuan Aura to see.</p>

<p>Countless universe cogwheels were spinning like mad. It was like a sleeping machine had suddenly been turned online and started firing on all cylinders. Many universal cogwheels that were combined were strangely falling apart. They connected with the cogwheels in an entirely different universe too. It felt like the mysterious machine known as the universe was now changing.</p>

<p>He did not dare remain in the 33rd sky. Han Sen escaped the 33 skies and returned to Outer Sky.</p>

<p>That place was not entirely safe either. Weird scenes were going on everywhere. Ten suns were in the sky. They looked like they were flowing through the sky. It was like some god demon was playing games with reality.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s face changed. He escaped Outer Sky to shockingly find out it was not just Outer Sky behaving that way. The entire geno universe was changing. Places were falling apart, and weird things kept happening everywhere.</p>

<p>“Big sky demon gave me the 24-stroke geno spell. What was it?” Han Sen was shocked. He went into his dreams to find big sky demon, who was still resting.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried calming himself down. He stared at big sky demon and asked, “Big sky demon, what was that 24-stroke spell you gave me?”</p>

<p>Big sky demon looked at Han Sen with shock. “Did you really write down the geno password on the geno tablet?”</p>

<p>“I did.” Han Sen looked glum. He looked at big sky demon like a tiger.</p>

<p>Big sky demon laughed and came hovering next to Han Sen. She stroked his face and said, “My dear, you are a very daring boy. You actually wrote down the geno password.”</p>

<p>Han Sen grabbed big sky demon by the wrists and coldly asked, “What was it?”</p>

<p>Big sky demon smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Whatever I told you was real. The geno password was used for resetting the geno tablet.”</p>

<p>“You only said the 33 skies would be reset,” Han Sen coldly said. “You did not say the geno universe would be affected.”</p>

<p>Big sky demon stroked her hair and said, “My dear, the place that will be affected will not only be the geno universe. The universe of kingdoms would be affected too. The 33 skies are the buffer zones between the main and reverse universes. That means it is the way to connect the main and reverse universe. Did you think the main and reverse wouldn’t be affected or something?”</p>

<p>“In that case, what is going to happen now?” Han Sen did not have the patience needed to listen to big sky demon’s frivolous explanations.</p>

<p>“Do not worry. The resetting of the 33 skies will not bring harm to the main and reverse universe. Instead, it can only yield benefits.” Big sky demon smiled.</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned and looked at big sky demon. Whatever big sky demon said was difficult for him to believe.</p>

<p>“Do not look at me like that. When have I ever lied to you? Not even once.” Big sky demon rubbed Han Sen on the face and said, “If I have guessed things correctly, without my geno password, you could not have escaped the geno tablet’s backlash.”</p>

<p>Han Sen presented a wry smile. He knew if he did not use the geno password, things would have proven ill for him. He could not really take it out on her.</p>

<p>It did not matter if big sky demon was playing a game or had ulterior motives. At the end of the day, it was Han Sen who decided to use the spell.</p>

<p>Big sky demon looked a bit excited as she said, “If the geno tablet has already been reset, I should leave. The time that I am used to is coming back.”</p>

<p>“What is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“Just go out and take a look.” Big sky demon looked very happy. She was holding Han Sen’s head by the cheeks. She planted a kiss on him. After that, she flew out of his dreams and said, “Little Dear, you make me so happy. It is no wonder why you are the stepfather of Master Bao’er. You really did use the geno password to reset the geno tablet. This is quite amazing.”</p>

<p>Big sky demon was now out of his dreams, so Han Sen forced himself to wake up. Whatever he saw was weird. The entire geno universe was undergoing weird shifts. There were big changes in all he laid his eyes upon.</p>

<p>The weird scenes and changes did not cause disasters. The previously hidden 33 skies started to show up.</p>

<p>The weird scenes Han Sen saw were all from the 33 skies.</p>

<p>It was different from what Han Sen saw before. This time, the 33 skies looked like they had a layer of stars that were floating through the air. No matter where in the universe one was, one could see the 33 skies.</p>

<p>The complete 33 skies looked like a giant gravestone. Atop the gravestone was a tablet. On the tablet, two words were written down upon it.</p>

<p>“Geno tablet.” Han Sen spoke the two words aloud. He looked at it very strangely. He thought the 33 skies was like a big gravestone.</p>

<p>Han Sen evilly thought, “It is bad to see this thing there. The God Chaos Party leader chose that unlucky spot for a headquarters. It is no wonder he failed. Qin Xiu and Bury Path God cannot be buried in the 33 skies beneath that gravestone, right?”</p>
