  When Han Sen entered the space battleground, Yan Dan was already waiting inside.

Upon seeing Han Sen arrive, Yan Dan immediately combined with his gene race. His back featured a spread of glorious bird wings. His power vastly increased in a short amount of time.

“Isn’t that Yan Bei Fei’s rip space nine-rob Yan? It looks like Yan Dan wants to fight Dollar to the death this time.” Sky King noticed the difference in Yan Dan’s demeanor, so he could not help but express his surprise.

In fact, most elites who knew anything about the Yan Kingdom could tell Yan Bei Fei was using his rip space nine-rob Yan.

After combining with it, Yan Dan’s body brimmed with a scary power movement. A gray presence spread across his body, covering it in a gray fire. He grew a horn on his head and a snake tail on his backside. “It’s the Yan Kingdom’s demon-eyed unicorn snake! He has combined with two gene races. They are adult classes. Yan Dan should not be able to do much more than that.” The demon-eyed unicorn snake was a very famous gene race in the Yan Kingdom. Many people knew about it.

In the next second, Yan Dan’s presence exploded. Red flames blew up across his body. He looked like a volcano in the midst of an eruption. It turned everything around him red. Several fiery, red feathers spread across Yan Dan’s back. They were like the feathers of a phoenix.

“Huh? Southbound leaving bird… Another rare gene race that happens to be in ultimate mode. This time, the Yan Kingdom really has invested quite a bit.” Sky King looked at Dan Yan with genuine shock.

It was not as if he was shocked that the Yan Kingdom possessed so many rare gene races. He was more shocked that Yan Dan could use three rare gene races and combine with them all at once.

That required a high level of body fitness. If ordinary humans tried to do something like that, the chances of success were low. Most people who tried were usually overwhelmed by the power of the gene races and ended up self-destructing.

Yan Dan seemed to be displaying trouble, but he ultimately managed to do it. His body released three distinct colors-red, gray, and black-in the shape of fire. His entire body looked like a demon god descending. It was an incredibly weird and strange sight.

Han Sen did not react to the spectacle, but the nobles of all the six kingdoms were incredibly shocked. Even King Jing Zhen looked surprised as he remarked, “What does Yan Yun Xiao want? This is just a god fight, yet he brought out the Flying Yan Spears. Is it really worth all of this?”

When Rocky Dee witnessed the reveal of the Flying Yan Spears, he was also shocked. “He has even brought out the two sacrificial god tools. Clearly, I might have underestimated the Yan Kingdom’s desire to fight and win. This is going to be interesting.”

“If you win, it is legal,” Han Sen coldly said. “If you lose, it is illegal. It doesn’t really matter.”

“Well said. In that case, we must certainly try our best.” Yan Dan did not wish to waste any time. Combining with three rare gene races put a lot of strain on his body.

Yan Dan put all of his scary power into the Flying Yan Spears. The black bodies of the spears emitted a scary fire. They were like demonic spears wreathed in a hellish fire.

“Combining the powers of three rare gene races to use the Flying Yan Spears is bound to unleash an attack even greater than if Empty God himself walked down here and tried attacking,” Thousand Mile Reach said.

Jia Shi Zhen shook his head. “It might be even scarier than that. The Flying Yan Spears are two sacrificial god tools. They are sacrifices of Empty God himself. Yan Dan must be an inheritor of Empty God. If he uses it with three rare gene race power buffs, it will be scarier.”

Before Thousand Mile Reach said anything in response, Yan Dan’s hands wielded the Flying Yan Spears. The pair of short spears were already coming for Han Sen from space. At that moment, the once lost short spears had become a black demonic Yan. They broke space and came flying toward Han Sen. That Empty God power came from Empty God. It made the demonic Yan disappear in space. When they appeared again, they were piercing through Han Sen’s body.

The power of those attacks was stronger than Zhuo Dong Lai’s Purple Mist That Comes from the East. In Han Sen’s eyes, he was not at all interested in it.

Yan Dan’s power was full of outside power. The outside power was overwhelmingly strong, but he could hardly hold on. No matter how strong that power was, Han Sen would not see it as anything else except a mask. Han Sen used his finger as a sword. He pointed at Yan Dan. He was going to use the spirit sword skill.

Blergh!

Yan Dan immediately felt the spirit sword skill’s sword mind. His crushed heart finally broke. He spat out some blood. The power around his body erupted into chaos. He coughed up some blood due to the power inside his body being messed up. The three gene races uncombined from his form. The Flying Yan Spears lost control and fell out from the nothingness.

The elites of all the kingdoms gasped. Yan Dan had put a lot of effort into his attack, but Han Sen had been able to wreck his attempt with just a finger.

Yan Yun Xiao’s face looked ashen. He expected Yan Dan might lose, but he did not expect his son to lose that way. He did not expect one sole finger to be his bane.

Yan Dan had not expected such a result. He had prepared for so long, yet he had been hit like that and made to lose badly.

Rocky Dee was excited. He looked at Yan Dan with eyes that were on fire. “Right. It is this look. It does not matter if you are a god or a demon. If you don’t have stubbornness in your heart, then you are nothing but rubbish. That is the right kind of stare. That is the stare an elite should have. Bring it out! Right now, that is what you need!”

Yan Dan wiped the blood from his mouth. He stood up. He did not care what it took. He was determined not to lose. Yan Dan could not lose. The Yan Kingdom could not afford another loss, which was why he was going to keep on fighting. It did not matter how much it cost. He had to win.

He pulled something out from his chest. Yan Dan held it tightly in his hands. He briefly looked frozen. He then used all his strength to crush whatever was in his hands.

Many weird powers came out from his clenched fist. The powers floated into Yan Dan’s body like a blizzard of snowflakes. The moment the power touched down on him, it was absorbed into his skin.

When the weird power melted into him, Yan Dan’s loose body presence was back in full force. The three gene races were resummoned, and they combined with him.

This time, Yan Dan’s body did not look exhausted. It was like he was happily eating rice and drinking tea. It was now that easy for him. Yan Dan’s face even managed to muster a smile.

“Dollar, our fight has just begun!” Yan Dan opened his eyes and looked at Han Sen. His eyes had turned pure black. There were no pupils or white of the eyes to be seen. It was like he had the eyes of a demon.

“You are not Yan Dan.” Han Sen frowned. He looked at Yan Dan and asked, “Who are you?”
