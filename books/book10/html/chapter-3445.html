<p>“There might be a way, but who are we going to send in there?”
an Elder asked.</p>
<p>The God Chaos Party elites were attacking Space Garden. It
seemed as if sounding the retreat would not be the right course of
action.</p>
<p>“This is the sky reward,” Bird Elder said. “We cannot give it to
someone else. I do not think there are any Break World elites left
in Space Garden. If there were, they would not allow the Break
World beasts to attack the bai sema. So, the bai sema beast should
be able to do this itself. But the reward will go to the bai sema
beast. Perhaps we will not receive any of the benefits. We must go
there by ourselves, so we can get a reward from Mister Leader.”</p>
<p>“This…” When people heard what Bird Elder was going to go, they
felt rather hesitant. They were all elders of the God Chaos Party
and very strong</p>
<p>But they had lived for far too long. Normally, creatures that
lived for such a long period of time cherished their lives. They
would let themselves live a billion years and cherish their life
greatly. So, they were God Chaos Party elders, but they were not
the main members.</p>
<p>When Human King asserted control of the God Chaos Party, he did
not have much in the way of manpower. That was why they were used.
Otherwise, no one would have wanted them to attack Space
Garden.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another reason. Many core members of the
God Chaos Party had betrayed the organization. Bury Path God had
been absorbed by Qin Xiu’s hands, and Rocky Dee was missing. There
were not many people to use.</p>
<p>“If you guys do not want to come along, I will go alone. But you
will not be able to quarrel over who the reward belongs to.” Bird
Elder coldly laughed.</p>
<p>“Fine. I will go with you,” an elder moaned. He gnashed his
teeth and decided to shoulder the risk with him.</p>
<p>Five more elders quickly agreed to join. They summoned the bai
sema beast. The five of them hid themselves inside the bai sema
beast. The bai sema snuck into Space Garden while the chaos was
happening. Mister White was still playing chess with Lin Feng. His
heart jumped. Something must have happened. His fingers were
holding a chess piece. His other hand was holding several other
chess pieces. He threw them down on the table. He looked at a few
of the chess pieces and frowned. “Is it good or bad? If it is bad,
it will be unable to be dodged. It is hard to predict if this is
good or bad.” “Mister White, is something wrong?” Lin Feng
asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Let’s just keep playing chess and defend this place,”
Mister White said. He looked at Ji Yanran, the mother and
daughter.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was holding Ling’er. She was watching the fight going
on up there. She was not very good when it came to combat, so she
did not chip in.</p>
<p>Little Gold Gold laid down next to Ji Yanran. Ever since
something happened in Space Garden, he had not left. It was like it
had decided to perpetually sleep where it was.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sleeping Little Gold Gold opened its eyes. It
raised its head. It looked in a certain direction outside of the
base.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran noticed Little Gold Gold’s odd behavior, so she asked,
“Little Gold Gold, what is going on?”</p>
<p>Little Gold Gold did not answer her. He stood up and continued
looking in a certain direction.</p>
<p>On the other side, Little Silver, Little Cat, the little red
bird, and the other pets of the Han family were all resting. They
all stood up and went to stand next to Ji Yanran, the mother and
the daughter.</p>
<p>“Bird Elder is so smart,” said a God Chaos Party elder said who
was sitting on the bai sema beast’s back. He was laughing like a
madman. “The Space Garden elites are all out. I cannot feel the
presence of any Break World elites right now. We are going to get a
big reward for doing this.”</p>
<p>Space Garden’s Break World elites, the ones who were able to
combat the threat, were already out. Now, all that remained were
the students. Not even the strongest student had managed to break
the world yet. They saw a beast that looked like a big dragon come,
and it gave them all a shock. Their reactions were not slow. They
used their powers to repel and slow the beast, but their powers
were not sufficient to touch the body of the beast.</p>
<p>An elder was sitting atop the back of the bai sema beast. He was
going to attack. He was going to kill the Space Garden student, but
Bird Elder stopped him.</p>
<p>“Ignore them,” Bird Elder said. “Focus on the matter at hand.
Killing these guys will be easy We can come back and mop the floor
with them later.” He then commanded the big beast to go to the yard
Ji Yanran was in.</p>
<p>He had learned where Ji Yanran lived a long time ago. He had
formed this idea a long time ago.</p>
<p>“No! They are going to the yard where the leader is.” Many of
the students of Space Garden were all in shock. They really wanted
to stop the big beast now.</p>
<p>But their power was too small before the might of the bai sema
beast. They would not even be able to touch the body of the bai
sema beast. The bai sema beast was able to go through everything
and head for Han Sen and Ji Yanran’s house.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The whole of the house was broken down by the bai sema beast’s
body. The house was shattered. Ji Yanran ran out of the house while
clutching Ling’er.</p>
<p>“Are they Han Sen’s wife and daughter?” An elder caught sight of
Ji Yanran and Ling’er. When he did, his eyes turned bright.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is them!” Bird Elder was very excited by the sight
too. If he captured them, Han Bao’er was sure to emerge. “Bai Sema
Beast, I command you to swallow them!” The elder that controlled
the bai sema beast gave out an order. He wanted the bai sema beast
to swallow Ji Yanran, the mother and the daughter. After that, they
would hastily depart Space Garden.</p>
<p>The bai sema beast had only just opened its mouth when a gold
light came from everywhere. A giant, gold, big beast appeared from
space. It was far bigger than the bai sema beast. It swallowed the
bai sema beast.</p>
<p>Bird Elder and the other elders were in shock. They all evaded
the strike. The bai sema beast was far too slow to move out of the
way, so it ended up getting bitten and chewed up by the big gold
beast. It swallowed all of its skin and bones.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Since when did Space Garden harbor such a
powerful creature?” An elder was in shock as he looked at Bird
Elder.</p>
<p>Bird Elder looked at Golden Growler angrily and said, “Han Sen’s
wife and daughter have a powerful creature looking over them. Stop
talking crap! The bai sema beast is gone. We cannot get out now! We
have no choice but to take down Han Sen’s wife and daughter. The
five of us must work together. If we do, we can make that big gold
beast fall. Just kill it!”</p>
<p>Bird Elder seemed to expect this would happen, otherwise, he
would not have wanted to bring other elders to reap his rewards.
The other elders knew it was too late for them to bail, so they
gnashed their teeth to fight alongside Bird Elder.</p>
<p>Although their guts were small, and they were afraid to die,
their power was still with them. The power they wielded was very
scary. Five scary powers went for Golden Growler.</p>
<p>Golden Growler came before Ji Yanran and emitted a gold light.
It fired a stream of gold light to strike the five incoming
powers,</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Golden Growler’s body was blasted backward a little. He almost
hit Ji Yanran and Ling’er, the mother and the daughter, but his
body suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Bird Elder and the others were both shocked and happy.
Individually in the God Chaos Party, there five powers would have
been rated from between medium and high. When used together, their
five powers were enough to beat back the gold big beast. The gold
big beast’s power was very scary.</p>
<p>They were happy their five powers could suppress the big gold
beast, so that made them feel much safer.</p>
