  On a mountain that was composed of black stones, Dragon Eight calmly looked down upon his opponent Han Sen. He began slowly flapping his wings. Each flap was stronger than the last.

He was different from Dragon Nine and the others. Dragon Eight was not fond of the traditional Dragon spears that the others favored. He vastly preferred using his own body as a weapon. He was confident in his own abilities as his greatest asset.

Dragon Eight’s body tore through the fabric of space and appeared directly in front of Han Sen. His fist was like a rocket of steel, primed to strike Han Sen’s head.

Before the fist landed, though, his gold draconic presence was ruptured with lightning.

Han Sen did not dodge. Instead, he raised his fist up to meet his opponent’s strike.

Pang!

The fists came at each other, and when they collided, both of their bodies rattled. But even so, neither of them fell back an inch. They only leaned backwards, with their arms still forward. It all transpired within a single second. And before the onlookers could blink, their bodies had straightened out again. They each bounced back with another punch.

Their fists came at each other repeatedly, then. Dragon Eight and Han Sen were frozen in the skies of battle, with fists hitting fists over and over.

“That Dollar’s body is remarkably strong! He can actually fight Dragon Eight, right off the bat.” Many people and creatures were impressed by the spectacle.

Dragons were the bravest across the whole universe. Everyone knew they were strong, and Dragon Eight was the strongest of the current generation. His Dragon body was top-class, and there was no doubt about that.

A Marquise of a race that had never been heard of before was now fighting against that Dragon body. Dollar’s gold figure now seemed a little spooky.

Evil Eye had finished his fight around this time. He was spared what little trouble a fight would cost, too, for his opponent had conceded.

After looking over the roster of current fights, Evil Eye’s first thought was to look for Lone Bamboo. But surprisingly, Lone Bamboo had finished his own fight, as well.

So, Evil Eye looked at a few other places. Some others he was interested in were still fighting, but many had finished already. He decided to take a look at Dragon Eight And there’ he found Han Sen fighting in a way that shocked him.

Evil Eye had only wanted to see Dragon Eight, but when he saw the fight, his focus immediately shifted to Han Sen.

“Eye, what are you looking at?” A little girl stood next to him. She pulled his hand, raised her head, and stared right at him. She looked so curious.

“I have seen a guy who quite interests me,” Evil Eye said simply.

When the little girl heard that, the curious look on her face vanished. She looked disappointed, and she said, “Eye, he must be a dead man walking, then.”

“Interesting ones always die early. Yes, that is their destiny. The blame cannot be laid on me.” Evil Eye smiled.

The little girl smiled, too. “Why do interesting people always die early? Does God not like them?”

Evil Eye shook his head. “No. God loves them. That is why they get to experience so many interesting things. They are usually dangerous, though, and that is why they die earlier than most.”

“I guess that makes sense.” The little girl felt as if something was amiss, but she couldn’t quite tell what it was.

The little girl then proceeded to ask, “Is this interesting man you’re talking about going to die soon?”

“He won’t die all that easily,” Evil Eye said, with a slump of his shoulders.

“What if he ends up meeting you?” the little girl asked, blinking.

“I don’t like people who are more interesting than me,” Evil Eye said coldly.

The two of them walked towards an old city, hand-in-hand. The little girl repeatedly asked him questions.

Pang!

A scary power broke across the mountain, cutting a massive crater in its craggy surface.

Han Sen and Dragon Eight’s bodies were sent flying by the impact. They both flew back exactly fifty meters. They looked at each other across the pit.

“This is a good fight. But I’m afraid we are only just getting started! I hope you can last longer,” Dragon Eight said. Then, his body burst at the seams with a massive Dragon light. He became taller, and his form rippled with muscles. Ghost Dragon Scales spread all over him, becoming an armorset. His body looked to have been made of gold.

The xenogeneic Dragon Eight was even stronger. The gold Dragon air became an Evilbreaker Dragonlight. It was different from Dragon Nine’s Evilbreaker Dragonlight. Dragon Eight’s Evilbreaker Dragonlight wasn’t as concentrated, but it had a mass of power that Dragon Nine had lacked. Dragon Eight’s xenogeneic Dragon body was in the air now, and it didn’t attack yet. Its gold eyes peered down at Han Sen. “My gold Dragon body is indestructible. I hope you are prepared.”

Han Sen looked at Dragon Eight and quietly reprimanded him. “You shouldn’t reveal your powers to the enemy.”

“The Dragon are fearless. Even if the whole world knows my powers, it is fine. I will still win,” Dragon Eight said. He then flapped his wings and teleported directly in front of Han Sen.

But this time, Dragon Eight didn’t just use his fists. When he approached, his whole body became a lethal weapon. It was like a mercury spill that sought to ravage Han Sen’s body with a flurry of constant attacks.

Finger. Palm. Fist. Elbow. Leg. Knee. Back. Wing. Horn. Leg. Shoulder. Even the gold Dragon’s hair became a lethal weapon.

When his body moved, there was power. Dragon Eight’s entire body became a gold killing machine.

Dragon Eight had completely abandoned defense, as all his skills were based on attacking. After all those unleashed attacks, Dragon Eight became stronger. Like waves, stacking together, the Dragonlight grew larger.

Han Sen was something of a grandmaster when it came to close-quarter combat. He wasn’t outmatched by Dragon Eight, and so he could counter every strike, using finger against finger and palm against palm. Han Sen was able to break every attack Dragon Eight attempted.

Dragon Eight’s attacks were strong like a swelling tide, but he lacked defense. If his attacks were flawed, then he would be open to a strike.

Han Sen found his opportunity, and his hand became a knife as it swiped across Dragon Eight’s chest. A firework of sparks erupted as he sliced through the gold Dragon scales to expose his flesh and gold blood.

Dragon Eight showed no concern for the wound he had just incurred, though. He continued to attack Han Sen, as if the injured body was not even his. And what’s more, the wound healed in a second, anyway. Not even a scar remained.

Pang!

Because Han Sen had just struck Dragon Eight, it was too late for him to dodge the counterstrike. He used his arm to block Dragon Eight’s fist, but the armor shielding his arm was broken by Dragon Eight’s blow. Han Sen’s body was sent back fifty meters before he was able to come to a stop and stabilize himself. His feet had dug trenches in the ground all the way.

Dragon Eight roared and did not relent in his assault. He was too strong to be suppressed now.
