<p>“You aren’t going to tell him about all the bets that have been
placed on his performance?”</p>
<p>“What is the point in him knowing that? Are we going to make him
fight for his life against a born-deified? I don’t want to have to
find another silkworm,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Li Keer said, tilting her head in
acknowledgment. “It is impossible for a King to beat a
born-deified. Plus, that deified has no lack of talent himself.
He’s as good as a student of the Very High. It won’t be easy for
anyone to win against him, and Han Sen is just a ninth-tier
King.”</p>
<p>Li Keer sighed and continued, “The people who have placed big
bets on Han Sen—who believed he would earn first place—are going to
lose the items they have wagered. They won’t be able to do anything
against Li Xue Cheng. They’ll definitely take out their anger on
Han Sen, even if they don’t hold him personally responsible.
Wherever he goes, I’m sure trouble will follow close behind.”</p>
<p>“That is something that cannot be avoided. We just have to find
a way to sort this out, or at least mitigate the fallout,”
Exquisite glumly said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen spent some time reviewing the information he had been
given. There descriptions and short bios of the twelve silkworms he
would be squaring off against. The information was comprehensive,
and whoever had been responsible for compiling it had done an
excellent job. It was like a bona fide restaurant menu.</p>
<p>There was an image of every silkworm in the documents he
received, too. Han Sen saw the born-deified fellow on the first
page.</p>
<p>Shale: Lionheart Mutant</p>
<p>Level: Primitive Deified</p>
<p>Sex: Male</p>
<p>Primary Geno Arts: Lion Killer</p>
<p>Hobbies and Interests: Dessert</p>
<p>The content of the documents was very detailed, but most of the
information was also pointless for Han Sen’s purposes. He didn’t
need to know the hobbies of his competition. He didn’t need to know
what color of armor they wore or the things they liked to do for
fun. There was no mention of their powers. All he learned was that
the deified had a geno art called Lion Killer.</p>
<p>“So far, reading this is no help at all.” Han Sen shook his
head.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on reading, and he noticed that every profile was
the same. When he flipped over to the fourth contestant, he saw the
description of Yu Shanxin. Again, the introduction was the same. It
only described his looks and the fact that he was skilled in the
Extreme Evil Path. That was about it.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept flipping through the profiles, page by page. He
memorized the faces of the silkworms, their names, and their races.
The other information was useless for him to remember.</p>
<p>Han Sen flipped through the character information and reached
the last page. There, he saw his own profile.</p>
<p>Han Sen: Crystallizer (serving Sky Palace)</p>
<p>Level: Ninth-tier King</p>
<p>Sex: Male</p>
<p>Primary Geno Arts: The Story of Genes, Teeth Knife, Under the
Sky knife skills…</p>
<p>Owned treasures: Charming God’s Jian, the Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze, unknown feather clothes, unknown bow…</p>
<p>“Wait, what is this?” Han Sen was frozen. The information he had
on the other silkworms was practically useless. But the profile on
him was surprisingly detailed. It said everything quite clearly,
and explicitly mentioned the treasures he wielded. It even
separated each one to describe each geno art and treasure in a
grossly detailed fashion. It was all so very elaborate.</p>
<p>“Who created this d*mn folder? Why has the writer only gone and
exposed my powers?” Han Sen felt as if he wanted to kill someone.
He didn’t know anything about his enemies, but the enemies knew
everything about him. This was bullcrap.</p>
<p>At the end of the information, there was a summary. “The genius
that can suppress thousands of races that composed the fabric of
the wonderful universe we live in. The one that stands out the most
can become the greatest silkworm. Aside from Shale, who we know can
fight, the other has yet to be decided. He is the most popular
winner in the silkworm bouts.”</p>
<p>“You motherf*cker.” After reading the summary, Han Sen felt
fairly sure that he had been set up.</p>
<p>Han Sen flipped through the book a few more times. He finally
saw the last sentence at the back of the book, too, then. It said,
“Editor: Li Xue Cheng.”</p>
<p>“Who is this Li Xue Cheng? Why is he turning everyone against
me?” Han Sen wondered, bewildered. He didn’t recall encountering a
man that went by that name before. In fact, he’d only met a few of
the Very High since he arrived in Outer Sky. He didn’t know anyone
called Li Xue Cheng, so there was no way he had offended him.</p>
<p>“Are Li Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen working together?” Han Sen
wondered to himself. Aside from Liyu Zhen, he could think of no
other person of the Very High who would want to see him down like
this.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Han Sen was given a shock. He realized that
the silkworms bouts wouldn’t be as easy as he initially
presumed.</p>
<p>Han Sen flipped back through the folder and read the details of
his opponents again and again. They were all top-class fighters.
There were many of the Extreme King there, and Yu Shanxin was one
of the Sky.</p>
<p>And in regards to Shale, who was a Lionheart, it was actually a
nameless race. There was only one half-deified among his people.
Shale just so happened to be the son of that half-deified, but for
some reason, there was a gene mutation when he was born. It led to
him becoming deified. He was extraordinarily talented.</p>
<p>After the God Spirit Touch’s test, he was registered as a ten
armor talent. Following his lead, the race of the Lionhearts had
gained wider renown. If he hadn’t been selected by one of the Very
High students to become a silkworm, he would have been planning a
fight for a lantern.</p>
<p>Shale was chosen to be a silkworm four years ago. He had been
practicing in Outer Sky for a long time, and he was so talented…
With all that extra time to practice and refine those talents, it
was easy to imagine how scary he would be as an opponent.</p>
<p>“If I can use treasures, I’ll definitely be able to beat Shale
and reach first place. If I can’t use treasures, then I will fail
to defeat Shale, and possibly all the other silkworms as well. Even
setting aside the others, I’ll have to fight Yu Shanxin. That guy
will be very hard to deal with,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>At the back of the folder, there was a list of all the rewards
one could receive from various placements in the silkworm bouts.
When Han Sen saw the reward for first place, his mouth gaped.</p>
<p>“What is a deified treasure set?” Han Sen was confused, and so
he continued reading. After reading it, he could only think, “The
rich are stubborn.”</p>
<p>The so-called “deified treasure set” was a set of armor composed
of powerful treasures. The chest piece was a deified treasure. So
was the belt. The gauntlets and the boots were four deified
treasures. With the helmet, that made seven deified treasures. It
combined to become a deified treasure set called the “Apollo
Set.”</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to read. He noticed the Apollo Set wasn’t just
a deified treasure composed of seven pieces. Each piece was an
individual deified treasure. They were all primitive class. If Han
Sen used them all together, it would allow him to make use of
special substance chains. That would put him at transmutation
level.</p>
<p>The second-place contestant would receive one deified treasure.
There were other resources that would be awarded as well, but none
of them were deified. There was a wide gulf of prestige separating
the rewards for second place and the rewards to be earned in first
place.The folder included a photo of the Apollo Set. The entire
thing shone silver like a polished mirror. It looked bad-*ss and
mysterious. It seemed to radiate glory.</p>
<p>Han Sen read the description of the Apollo Set, and after
reading it, he felt himself starting to drool. If a user hadn’t
reached deified, they couldn’t activate the Apollo Set’s power. But
if multiple people used the pieces of the set simultaneously, the
seven-piece set could activate Apollo’s Wings, which were the
substance chains. They had primitive power, and a King could
control them.</p>
