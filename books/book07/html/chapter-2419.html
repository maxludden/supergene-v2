<p>Miss Mirror hadn’t thought Han Sen’s mind was strong, and the
unexpected depth of his consciousness struck her with
confusion.</p>
<p>It was as if she had received a mystery gift, and she had no
idea who had delivered it or what it contained. After opening that
special parcel, she only found another mystery box inside. She
opened it, layer by layer, but there never seemed to be an end.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if the gift deep inside the layers of the
package was good or bad; opening a gift like this would make people
angry.</p>
<p>Luckily, Miss Mirror was a very patient person, so she didn’t
look annoyed. She peeled open Han Sen’s mind, layer by layer. But
after doing this for a while, she still hadn’t found what lay at
its center.</p>
<p>Not even God had enough patience to keep searching endlessly
like that. After Miss Mirror peeled away all those layers, her
inability to find the center was too much. She didn’t like feeling
this way.</p>
<p>“I want to see what resides in your mind,” Miss Mirror thought
in determination. Gathering herself, she leaned the full weight of
her deified mind atop Han Sen’s mind to try to crack it open.</p>
<p>Spring Rain destroyed flowers. Han Sen’s will was like the
center of a flower that was being forced open. One by one, the
petals fell. But when the place covered by the petals was finally
revealed, she found that it was empty.</p>
<p>“It’s only a shell, with nothing on the inside.” Miss Mirror
felt rather disappointed.</p>
<p>Minds represented someone’s personality and the way they felt
things. Han Sen’s mind was very strong on the outside, but its
interior was hollow. Therefore, he couldn’t be considered someone
strong.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror wanted to pull her mind back since she was done
investigating, but suddenly, she couldn’t.</p>
<p>She had opened Han Sen’s mind using brute force. A normal mind
would have been shattered by such an act. There shouldn’t have been
left a trace of that mind left.</p>
<p>But Miss Mirror could still detect Han Sen’s mind with her own
will. That was unexpected.</p>
<p>The mind moved. Miss Mirror’s eyes lowered, and she looked at
all of the petals across the floor. Every petal was like a crystal.
They were scattered across the floor, but they weren’t damaged.</p>
<p>The will that Miss Mirror had detected invaded one of the
petals, and as it did, Miss Mirror’s eyes widened. She had only
wanted to peel away the petals to see what was on the inside. She
hadn’t bothered to look at the petals themselves.</p>
<p>The mind entered the petal, and suddenly, that consciousness was
like a rolling, storm-shaken sea. It was as wide as a sky and as
deep as an ocean. The mind was so rich that Miss Mirror staggered
under the detailed sensation of it.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror bent and picked up another petal. The will was like
a mountain crashing down. It was like a pillar that held up the
sky, never moving.</p>
<p>If she was a novel, this man would be a grand saga.</p>
<p>A man could define himself as a broken, sick, elderly man on his
deathbed, or as the warrior who threw himself into the thick of
battle when he was young.</p>
<p>People only focused on results. Wins and losses determined all,
and rarely did people pay attention to what led up to those places.
People often failed to see the desperation and difficult times men
have to face frequently. Endurance and bravery abound in the hearts
of men.</p>
<p>Everyone fails sometimes, but real men get up and keep going
despite their losses. No matter what environment they are in or
what happens to their bodies, the only thing that can’t be changed
is the wants and desires of their hearts. They want victory, with
the determination to win is greater than anything.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s will didn’t have a core because real men have no end.
Ambitions grew continually, stretching out beyond the reaches of
space and time. Forward. Forward. And forward again until their
time of death.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t looking to climb the highest mountains. He wanted
to go further and higher. His ambitions had no end. Infinity went
on forevermore.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t see the core of Han Sen’s mind, but every
petal was what Han Sen had experienced. There was anger, happiness,
sadness, endurance, sensations of sea, and sky, and earth.</p>
<p>Perhaps one single mind didn’t make Han Sen better than Miss
Mirror, but by observing all of those petals and understanding
them, Miss Mirror couldn’t help but feel awed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Miss Mirror raised her head. She realized she was
trapped inside Han Sen’s mind. His emotions were affecting her
mood.</p>
<p>“I cannot stay in a place that bothers my heart,” Miss Mirror
said with an implacable face. She summoned her Spring Rain mind,
wanting to destroy the mirror where Han Sen had sent his will. She
didn’t want her own will to be affected.</p>
<p>Ten thousand petals were destroyed by her mind, but Miss Mirror
soon found out that when the petals were destroyed, they fell to
the ground like seeds. New flowers then opened.</p>
<p>No matter how Miss Mirror’s mind raged or how she tried to
destroy Han Sen’s will, the flowers grew. She couldn’t destroy
them, only spread them further.</p>
<p>“Why is this happening?” Miss Mirror wondered, stupefied. She
couldn’t remain calm. She couldn’t completely destroy Han Sen’s
mind. It was an impossible task.</p>
<p>She was a deified elite. Her mind was one of the strongest in
the whole of the Extreme King, and yet she couldn’t deal with Han
Sen, who just a meager King. She couldn’t believe what was
happening.</p>
<p>“Is his will really this strong?” Miss Mirror examined at her
will, where flowers were half-opened. She looked at them
strangely.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Miss Mirror took a step back. She separated the two Mirror
Spirit Eye Rings and looked right at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror discovered that her mind was melting quickly into
Han Sen’s body. Seconds later, it was all gone. Even Miss Mirror
could no longer feel it. The Mirror Spirit Eye’s mind that had been
sent to Han Sen had been extinguished by him.</p>
<p>“Thank you, My Lady.” Han Sen opened his eyes and bowed before
Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s Spring Rain mind had allowed Han Sen to learn a
lot, and he was very thankful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>When Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen, her expression was
inscrutable. She didn’t say anything, and she merely departed.</p>
<p>When she returned to her room, Miss Mirror used many methods to
try to erase Han Sen’s influence, but try as she might, she
couldn’t. It greatly annoyed Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>“Am I not as good as a mere King?” Miss Mirror chewed her lip
and tried to use her mind to erase the flowers that stood for Han
Sen’s mind. Her efforts were futile. Those mind flowers had taken a
firm root inside her mind. No matter how she tried to destroy them,
the roots remained. They could keep growing again and again.</p>
<p>Flowers know the sea. Half-open and half-hidden. Wildflowers
kept burning. The wind blew, and the process started again.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s crew had been working in the stone fields for five
days, and after that time passed, something weird happened. A
worker dug up a rock that was the size of a mortar and pestle. A
few words were engraved on the side of the rock.</p>
<p>The two Marquises that dug up the rock read the text, and all of
a sudden, they became Dukes.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror went out to the stone field with Red Cloud and
brought the rock back to camp. After their second day examining the
rock, the deified Red Cloud was reduced to King class
overnight.</p>
