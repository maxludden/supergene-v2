<h2>Geno God List</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2838</h3>

<p>In the Extreme King’s garden, Han Sen was sitting reading books.
The lady who looked like Wan’er was sitting nearby watching
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyebrows noticeably rose. After a while of enduring
the gaze, he could not help but ask Wan’er, who was actually God in
disguise, “Can you not look at me like that?”</p>
<p>God had been looking at him for a long time. Even as a God, the
being should have been tired of watching all of that.</p>
<p>After agreeing to bring God home, Han Sen had no choice but to
bring God to the Extreme King. God had also noticed the fact that
Han Sen had become smaller.</p>
<p>God smiled and said, “Only you are interesting here. If I don’t
stare at you, what else can I look at?”</p>
<p>“Extreme King elites are everywhere, such as Bai King and those
elders. They are very interesting elites. Feel free to stare at
them.” Han Sen obscenely sold out the Extreme King.</p>
<p>“I am tired of looking at them,” God said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was speechless. If Bai King learned someone had said
that about him, he wondered what he would think.</p>
<p>“The universe is so big. Powerful nobles and xenogeneics exist
everywhere. You can go check them out.” Han Sen felt sad as he
spoke.</p>
<p>“I am not invincible. It is not like I can watch whoever I want.
I, at least, need to find some interesting creatures. Then, I can
go see them,” God patiently explained.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what else to say, so he casually said, “If
you like seeing other creatures that much, it would be nice if
there was a geno being scroll fight to watch. You could watch them
all.”</p>
<p>When God heard what Han Sen said, it nodded and said, “Your
suggestion is not bad. We can have another geno being scroll fight,
but the geno being scroll fights are fairly boring. The creatures
that fight aren’t even god class. There should be a god fight
instead.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Han Sen looked at God with shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never heard of the geno being scroll opening on a
whim. In the past, it was supposed to be once every 100 years, and
the highest rank allowed in were kings.</p>
<p>The last geno being scroll bouts ended a few years ago. There
was still a long time to go until 100 years had gone by. The geno
being scroll should not have been able to open again so soon.</p>
<p>Yet God wanted there to be a geno being scroll fight now and one
for beings that were god class. Han Sen really didn’t believe
it.</p>
<p>If God could randomly start geno being scroll fights, then why,
in the past and across all of time, had nothing like this happened
before?</p>
<p>“As a god, never lying is one of the most basic rules,” God
said. The being reached out a hand and brought a notebook out of
nowhere. Then, God started writing in it.</p>
<p>Han Sen leaned his head over to take a gander at what was being
written, but he noticed the paper in the notebook was blank. The
pen was not writing down anything.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was confused over what God hoped to do, he
suddenly heard the thunder roll through space.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the entire universe went dark. Every creature in the
entire universe was shocked. The sky was pitch-black. One could not
even see their fingers. Suddenly, a big boom sounded. He didn’t
know what was happening.</p>
<p>Some low-life creatures that had not developed were madly
running around. They did not know what was happening. They thought
it was the end of the world.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a crack in space. An ancient temple
appeared. It looked like the geno hall. It inched its way out of
the crack.</p>
<p>“What is happening? Why has the geno hall suddenly appeared now?
Did another god just die? But no way! I did not see another god’s
sadness.”</p>
<p>“Did someone trigger a lantern fight?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. I do not see anyone triggering a lantern
fight for ownership of a race lantern.”</p>
<p>Many deified elites across several different races were
confused. They were looking at the geno hall, which was floating in
space.</p>
<p>This time, when the geno hall appeared, it was different from
how it usually appeared. When the geno hall revealed itself
completely, the gate slowly opened.</p>
<p>The light inside the gates was very bright. People could only
see bright, godly lights manifest from beyond the gate. One could
not really see what was inside the god hall.</p>
<p>Inside that very bright godly light, something came out from the
god hall. When everyone clearly saw what it was, they were knocked
into shock. It was a scroll.</p>
<p>“Is that the geno being scroll? It does not quite look the same.
The geno being scroll fights happened a few years ago. Why is it
happening again so soon?”</p>
<p>“What is happening here?” Bai King stood atop his god tower. He
frowned and looked at the scroll unfurling in the sky.</p>
<p>On an unknown small planet, an old man who was a fortune-teller
frowned while looking at the scroll. “What the hell? Why would a
geno being scroll appear now?”</p>
<p>Inside the palace of a red dwarf star, there was a man who
looked like a king. He was looking at the scroll in the sky with
interest.</p>
<p>Inside a black hole, the Demon alpha—who had been practicing
with his eyes closed—suddenly opened them. He stared at the scroll
in the sky.</p>
<p>At the peak of Empty Mountain, a green-haired beast and a woman
looked at this weird scene unfold with shock.</p>
<p>The scroll slowly opened up. There was shiny text on it. No one
was able to read the words, but every creature was somehow able to
understand the meaning. Even the people from the undeveloped races
were able to understand what the words meant.</p>
<p>The feeling was like someone was standing aloft in space and
reading it, but no one heard the sounds.</p>
<p>A godly voice that could not be heard echoed throughout the
universe. “The geno god list is open. All god class creatures are
eligible to join. The first 100 can be kept inside the geno god
list and be handsomely rewarded.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was frozen. He could not believe that something he had
randomly said could instigate universe-wide changes. When he saw
the rewards, his heart jumped.</p>
<p>That was especially true of the reward for those in the first
place. If there were a chance, Han Sen would fight for his life to
claim that prize.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “I believe that prize would tempt the deified
elites of the entire universe.”</p>
<p>It was not just his heart that was jumping. Every deified elite
in the entire universe was going crazy. The rest on the list did
not matter much, but the first-place reward was a god’s
personality. They could become god spirits. That was the dream of
most deified elites.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, entering the geno hall was too hard.
Approximately 99% of true gods died while attempting to go in. No
one dared to try to go in on a whim.</p>
<p>Now, they just needed to win first place in the latest fights to
become god spirits. The difficulty had been significantly
reduced.</p>
<p>Even if people did not achieve the first place, the rewards
behind it were still quite good. It made the elites who were not
deified very tempted.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Seeing the empty geno god list shine, countless amounts of
starlight flew across the universe. Han Sen saw starlight come
before him. It was an invitation to the geno god fight. Pretty much
every deified in the universe received the same starlight.</p>
