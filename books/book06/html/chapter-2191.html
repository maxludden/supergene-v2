<h2>In Front of Cold Palace</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2191</h3>

<p>Night River King quickly recognized that shadow. He frowned and
said, “What is Han Sen doing here?”</p>
<p>Han Sen had journeyed over the range of mountains to arrive near
Cold Palace. He looked at the time and found that he still had five
minutes to go. This was perfect.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, what are you doing? You are not the Cold Palace
guardian anymore. Don’t you know that this place is restricted?”
Night River King shouted at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “Night River King, are you too old to
remember things correctly? Don’t you remember that I was given
permission to access any location on Planet Blade? You allowed this
yourself.”</p>
<p>Night River King looked glum at first, but then he laughed. He
looked up at Han Sen with disdain and said, “This is why you wanted
access to Planet Blade? That’s fine. If you would like to watch me
absorb moonlight, then feel free to watch. But don’t blame me for
not saving you when you freeze to death because you don’t have
access to the tablet and its protection.”</p>
<p>Night River King believed Han Sen must have had a death wish. He
was only a Marquise, after all. Not even Night River King would
remain there without the tablet’s protection.</p>
<p>If the deified toad was some distance away from him, Night River
King could fight back against the cold power it created with his
own power. But he would absorb less moonlight in the process.
Without the tablet, the deified toad wouldn’t allow him close. And
if he made the toad mad, he’d likely lose his life.</p>
<p>Han Sen wouldn’t be there for long. Han Sen wouldn’t stay if the
deified toad emerged.</p>
<p>Night River King believed that Han Sen was about to run off, but
then, Han Sen approached. He was in front of the stone house now,
standing on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Night River King smile at him, and so he said,
“Night River King, you are so weird. You could be a King, but
instead, you have come to guard this door.”</p>
<p>Night River King’s chuckle was brittle. “Yeah, well, one of us
doesn’t even have permission to guard the door.”</p>
<p>Night River King raised his head. “Don’t say I haven’t warned
you. There is less than a minute to go until the jade toad comes
out. If you don’t run off now, it will be too late for you by the
time it emerges. And I will be unable to save you.”</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reminding me, but I’ll go when I feel
like it,” Han Sen responded flatly.</p>
<p>Night River King hummed to himself and did not speak. He thought
Han Sen was there to play some sort of prank on him. Without the
guardian tablet, though, it was only a matter of time before the
annoying Marquise gave up and left.</p>
<p>Time ticked by, and the jade toad was on the verge of coming
out. But even so, Han Sen gave no sign of wanting to leave the
area.</p>
<p>“Whatever happens next, you had it coming. If you die, you die.
If you honestly think I will make an effort to save you, you are
gravely mistaken. When Knife was still around, I wouldn’t have
allowed you to die in my proximity, but now that she’s gone…” Night
River King’s smile was full of teeth.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The door of the stone house opened, and a gust of frosty air
came out. It washed out like a tide, freezing the whole area around
the house. It turned the basin of water into an iced-over lake.</p>
<p>A green toad started to emerge from the stone cave. The
waterfall and the river quickly froze as well.</p>
<p>“This is definitely a deified creature. Even the power
surrounding it is so strong. The icy power it commands is shocking
to witness,” Night River King thought in awe.</p>
<p>He turned to look at Han Sen. There was no way Han Sen could
repel the frosty air, so Night River King figured that he’d swiftly
turn to ice.</p>
<p>But when he looked, he found Han Sen standing casually in his
original position. His body was like jade, and he looked normal. It
didn’t seem as if he was freezing, at all.</p>
<p>Night River King stared, and he thought to himself, “What is
this? Although the frosty air is a passive effect that the toad
gives off, not even a Duke should be able to block it at this
proximity. If I did not have the guardian tablet with me, even I
would have to be careful at this range. Why is Han Sen not
freezing?”</p>
<p>As Night River King wondered this, the deified toad emerged. Its
green eyes looked at Night River King. Even when it saw the tablet
in his hands, the beast ignored him. It turned its head to look at
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Night River King laughed. “I don’t know what you have done to
keep your body from freezing, but the guardian tablet is an
agreement between the jade toad and my race. Without the tablet,
the jade toad won’t stand for you being here. He will eat you. You
were too cocky to come here, and you will now pay for this by
dying.”</p>
<p>The jade toad looked at Han Sen on the other side of the door,
but it didn’t do anything to him. It merely meandered onwards to
the pool.</p>
<p>Night River King wondered, “Has the jade toad not killed in so
long that it is no longer interested in meat?”</p>
<p>When the jade toad made it to the pool, twenty or thirty small
jade toads came out of the water. They all looked about the same
size as a football. They shimmered like jade, too. They were all so
beautiful.</p>
<p>When the small jade toads climbed out, they saw Han Sen standing
near the door. Some of them ran towards Han Sen. Seeing this, Night
River King was made very happy.</p>
<p>“Good! Good! Good! Although these small jade toads haven’t
reached their adult strength, if they attack Han Sen and he
resists, he will be killed by the deified jade toad.” Night River
King grinned at the prospect.</p>
<p>But the scene that followed made Night River King freeze.</p>
<p>The small jade toads weren’t coming to attack Han Sen. When they
clambered around him, he crouched and started to pat their heads.
Then, he picked up two.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” Night River King couldn’t think straight, and
he was starting to look as cold as the ice itself.</p>
<p>The jade toad was thought to be very cruel. Because the Rebate
had a deal with it, people with the guardian tablet were allowed
near it. No one would dare come to where it lived without the
tablet, though.</p>
<p>The fact that the jade toad hadn’t eaten Han Sen had surprised
Night River King. But seeing Han Sen happily playing with the
deified creature’s young was bizarre. Night River King was starting
to think that some sort of glamor had been placed on him.</p>
<p>The small jade toads weren’t following. The deified jade toad
stopped and looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“He dares to touch the small jade toads? The deified jade toad
will surely be angry about this,” Night River King thought
desperately.</p>
<p>But the deified jade toad only made a noise. It turned around
and kept going up towards the frozen lake.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still holding one little jade toad, and he followed
the crowd across the lake and up the waterfall.</p>
<p>“How… The deified toad is allowing an outsider to sit next to
it?” Night River King froze. His expression turned very foul.</p>
