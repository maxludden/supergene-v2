<p>Han Sen had already been tempted to do that. After hearing Qin
Xiu’s last words, it made him completely give up his fleeting
thoughts of actually conceding.</p>
<p>This was what Han Sen’s personality was like. If things went his
way, he was a pleasant person to talk to. Qin Xiu’s last words were
very threatening, so it made him stop wanting to concede.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I already told you I don’t follow monsters,” Han Sen
said. “By the way, that includes you.” “That’s fine. You will
follow me sooner or later. First, you must live for that day.”
After Qin Xiu said that, he turned around and left.</p>
<p>“Bury Path God, come and guide me around the God Chaos Party.
Show me what it’s like these days.” Qin Xiu’s voice went into Bury
Path God’s ears. Bury Path God had his freedom again. “Yes.” Bury
Path God’s emotions had calmed down completely by now. It was
unknown what was going through his mind. He stood up without
emotion, followed Qin Xiu, and departed.</p>
<p>“The black crystal armor left me after all.” Han Sen’s face
looked weird as he spoke.</p>
<p>The crystal armor had been with him since it was a crystal, and
it had helped him out of many jams. Without the black crystal
armor, it was like Han Sen would not have come as far as he
had.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, anything in life could leave, so Han Sen did not
think too much about it. Even still, Han Sen did not plan on
leaving the black crystal armor just like that.</p>
<p>“That black crystal armor never belonged to me, but it never
belonged to you either, Qin Xiu. You are powerful now, so you can
take it away. One day, I am going to take it back.” Han Sen was
calm. He stopped thinking about the black crystal armor and all the
matters pertaining to Qin Xiu. His body was just like how Qin Xiu
said it was. It was not in a good state. He brutally reversed the
Dongxuan Sutra. That alone dealt a lot of damage to Han Sen. The
so-called reversal was not just about running it in reverse.</p>
<p>It was like the Blood-Pulse Sutra and the Xuan Yellow Sutra. The
two of them had differences. They both had their bases, so it was
not just a simple case of reversing the opposite to go.</p>
<p>Han Sen had brutally reversed it by mistake. It was because he
had been forced to. That was why Han Sen did it.</p>
<p>The reverse Dongxuan Sutra had already damaged him a lot. Now,
the power of the Dongxuan Sutra was combined with it. It did not
combine, and it had a conflict. It made Han Sen’s body endure
significant damage.</p>
<p>The two of the powers were no longer in Han Sen’s control. It
was like there was a raging flood that had come about in the
breaking of a dam. It was everywhere in his body.</p>
<p>The worst thing about it was that he had been suppressed by Dust
Sky. That meant Han Sen’s power had decreased, but the power he had
lost had not been decreased. Han Sen could not control this
situation.</p>
<p>That was why Qin Xiu had told him that if he had not saved Han
Sen, he would have died.</p>
<p>There was one thing Han Sen knew for sure. There was another
type of willpower inside the black crystal armor. It was the “her”
Qin Xiu had referenced. In the past, it was her will to control the
black crystal armor. Qin Xiu should not have been able to know what
was going on at that time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Qin Xiu would have known that Han Sen had taken care
of Wan’er for quite some time. With his connection to Wan’er, he
would not allow Han Sen to die.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew if he said things like that, there was an 80% to
90% chance that Qin Xiu would have saved his life.</p>
<p>It was a shame that Han Sen was not that type of person. He knew
what things were like, but he would never ask for help.</p>
<p>Han Sen held onto the pain his body was suffering, trying to put
the two powers back on the right track. His power was too weak. All
of the power in his body was going to the lowest point. He could
not deal with the two powers that had lost their control.</p>
<p>“Controlling two powers seems impossible. If I use my leftover
powers to make a bet, maybe I can separate these two powers. As
long as they do not collide with each other, perhaps there is
something I can do to soothe things.” Han Sen was not someone who
gave up easily. He was trying to find a way to fix these
difficulties he was having. Han Sen quickly realized that way did
not work. Two powers were all over his body. Even if Han Sen used
his leftover power to attack, he could not separate those two
powers.</p>
<p>“If there is no going back, I will have no choice but to push on
through to the worst possible point and start all over again.” Han
Sen was angry. He used the last of his power to do a final push.
The two powers were running. Han Sen did not know what would
happen, but he knew that those two powers were not going to
stop.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Sutra’s power was scarier than Han Sen had
imagined. The primary Dongxuan Sutra power was familiar to him with
its most basic rules, and the reverse Dongxuan Sutra created a
completely different power.</p>
<p>Because he could not control it, Han Sen still did not know what
kind of power it had. Looking at it based on the damage done to his
body, it was evidently far scarier than the ordinary Dongxuan
Sutra.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at Han Sen with immense worry. She sensed that Han
Sen’s situation was not a favorable one. She did not dare disturb
him. She did not want to distract him from the issues he wrestled
with.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the last ounce of his power to collect himself. The
powers of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, Xuan Yellow Sutra, Jadeskin, and
The Story of Genes were used.</p>
<p>Although they were badly weakened, this had already come to
pass. He used as much as he could, fighting it in a life-or-death
moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a weird mark appeared on Han Sen’s body. It was Spell.
She wanted to combine with him. It combined with him through the
armor mode.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face, which looked very sharp, appeared softer after
combining with Spell. His hair and eyes turned white. His pupils
and skin were put under some kind of spell.</p>
<p>He did not know if he was mistaken, but Han Sen felt as if Dust
Sky’s power was now having less of an effect on him.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic mode.” Han Sen gnashed his teeth and entered
Xenogeneic mode. This was a mode in which four geno arts could
combine into one. Aside from his Super God Spirit mode, that was
Han Sen’s strongest form.</p>
<p>Because the Xuan Yellow Sutra had appeared, he had already made
his four geno arts unbalanced. Now, because of the Dongxuan Sutra’s
loss of balance, the two main and reverse powers collided together.
He did not know what that meant for him in xenogeneic mode.</p>
<p>At this point, Han Sen could not worry too much about it. He had
to use every power he had to give it a shot.</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s body totally entered Xenogeneic mode, he felt his
body’s power explode. It was like the pulses of his body were all
exploding. It was like his body had a fireworks party going on
inside him.</p>
<p>Even with Han Sen’s tough will, he could not help but shout. He
had to express how much pain he was in.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Han Sen’s threshold of endurance had
reached the max it could go, but his body reacted. He entered Super
God Spirit mode, but the pain did not go away because of it. It
made him hurt even more.</p>
<p>Han Sen was under Super God Spirit mode now. He had a body of
white light. He suddenly heard a crack. He had never experienced
something like this in Super God Spirit mode before.</p>
