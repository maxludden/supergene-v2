    <p>
      Everyone was still. The entire living room was silent and dead; you could
      hear a pin drop.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ji family was very noble and very religious. Grandfather Ji possessed
      the highest authority and governance. No one could quite believe they were
      watching this revered figure kneel in tears before Han Sen&#8217;s mother.
      And despite her defiance, he called her &#8220;lady.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Even Han Sen was petrified. He did not expect the head of the Ji family
      would cry in front of his mother like a child.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Luo Sulan looked a little worried, with the man
      in front of her. She reached out her hand and tried to raise him up. Her
      lips lifted a little when she spoke, which indicated to Han Sen that she
      was lying, and she did in fact know who he was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Lady Lan, I am Ji Yanwu. I am the third brother. Thirty-four years
      ago, I was fortunate to encounter you in the Sky-Water Pavilion. You were
      only eleven years old, and you were beside Mister Haitang. If you
      weren&#8217;t wearing the Saint Heart Haitang brooch right now, I would
      have almost been disrespectful to you. Please forgive me.&#8221;
      Grandfather Ji still would not stand up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s third uncle Ji! Get up! I can&#8217;t accept such
      reverence towards me. I apologize for not recognizing you, for back then
      you were still a young man with black hair. I cannot believe, in the
      advent of all these years, I am now a middle-aged woman. Furthermore, time
      has robbed your hair of its color.&#8221; Luo Sulan helped raise
      Grandfather Ji up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grandfather Ji, back on his two feet, excitedly asked, &#8220;Lady Lan,
      how is Mister Haitang doing?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Grandpa&#8217;s body is still healthy, but he is getting old and
      does not go out much.&#8221; Luo Sulan smiled faintly as she spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Grandfather Ji chat-up Luo Sulan bewildered the Ji family, and they
      suddenly did not understand what was going on. Even Han Sen was puzzled;
      his mouth was wide open in awe.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why does my mother&#8217;s family suddenly seem so powerful? Do I
      actually hail from a rich family? No way! If I was, why would I grow up in
      such poverty? Numerous times, we almost lost our home.&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s heart was now brimming with countless questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this kid your son?&#8221; Grandfather Ji looked at Han Sen with
      exuberantly kind eyes. He looked at him more brightly than he did his own
      sons.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes; this is my son. His name is Han Sen.&#8221; Luo Sulan smiled
      and gave Han Sen another introduction.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is no wonder he is your son. He is such a smart kid, and he has
      achieved so much at his relatively young age. His future is bound to be
      one of greatness, and it is of magnificent fortune that Ji Yanran is to
      marry him.&#8221; Grandfather Ji complimented Han Sen as if he was the
      smartest person in the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Father, who is this?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen could no longer stay silent.
      He wanted to get a better understanding of the family his daughter was
      marrying into.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t just Ji Ruozhen who wanted an explanation; it was everyone
      who was present. They all stared at Han Sen and his mother in perplexity,
      as what had just happened in the past few minutes was too difficult to
      believe. Now, they really wanted to know who Han Sen&#8217;s mother was to
      make Grandfather Ji behave like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ruozhen, we are to become a family with Lady Lan. You should all be
      nice to each other.&#8221; Grandfather Ji looked utterly delighted, and he
      continued on by saying, &#8220;We are so lucky!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Father, who is Mister Haitang?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen knew his father
      well, and his behavior wouldn&#8217;t be so ebullient if this was just
      anyone. To incite such a reaction, the person he was referring to would
      have to be someone of legendary or mythical status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grandfather Ji&#8217;s eyes seemed complicated now, as if they were
      peering off into his own distant past. It was like he was on a blissful
      reverie, taking a trip down the lane of his memories. &#8220;His name may
      not be one to spark the imagination, but you know who he is. He has long
      protected this family. Solo, he reached the Fourth Shelter and even
      claimed a shelter for himself in a realm of demigods.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Godslayer Luo?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen&#8217;s face suddenly changed.
      Before he could say anything more, screams were already erupting from
      various corners of the Ji audience. Everyone looked at Han Sen and his
      mother with tremendous shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fourth shelter was not a place for ordinary humans. Demigod elites
      could only scratch an existence for themselves there. In the fourth
      shelter, throughout history, humans had only managed to claim ten shelters
      for themselves. Demigod class humans only used such places as safehouses,
      so they could remain alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nine human demigod shelters were the fruits of a cooperative effort
      between many different factions of the Alliance. But one of these shelters
      was claimed solo, by a human demigod. He fought for it for four days and
      four nights. This person was an enigma, and most people only knew his
      surname. He preferred to go solo, and he loved nothing more than slaying
      beings that were greater than him. Over time, this earned him the title
      &#8220;Godslayer Luo.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Godslayer Luo was a violent person with a strange personality, he
      was a protector. And those who swore their allegiance to him would receive
      his guardianship.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Back in the day, we went out on a hunt. We went to take out a royal
      shelter in the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary, me with a few uncles. We were
      victorious, but only for a brief while. Our claim was staked in that place
      for ten days before the most wretched thing happened. A beast descended
      from the skies and laid waste to our new home. It overwhelmed the forces
      of our shelter, and so foul was this creature, it didn&#8217;t seem likely
      our combined might could slay or even stay its attack. Me and two thousand
      family members looked likely to be killed by that thing, but that was when
      Mister Haitang appeared. He came alone and with a single strike, he lopped
      the head of that monster clean off. The Ji family was saved. Without
      Mister Haitang, there would be no Ji family. I wouldn&#8217;t be alive
      right now, if it wasn&#8217;t for that man.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Grandfather Ji looked upon the faces of his family and said, &#8220;Mister
      Haitang saved our family. If someone here does not treat Lady Lan with the
      respect she deserves, they will be subject to family discipline.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen and everyone else quickly agreed, but in their hearts, they
      thought, &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you the one that came forward, seething with
      rage at first?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt like he was dreaming. Ten minutes ago, the Ji family was
      bullying his mother. Now, they were all praising her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing his mom suddenly surrounded by people who looked on her like a
      goddess, he didn&#8217;t think what he was seeing was real.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is my mother really the child of Godslayer Luo?&#8221; Han
      Sen&#8217;s head was stuffed with questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The discussions regarding the engagement resumed, and they seemed to go
      well. Grandfather Ji stood to the side, listening intently. In the end,
      Luo Sulan had the final say on everything. The Ji family didn&#8217;t
      object to a single desire of hers.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was given an invitation to stay over, by Grandfather Ji, but she
      turned the offer down. So, later, Han Sen and his mother left the Ji
      family household together. Grandfather Ji made sure all the family members
      bid them a fond farewell as they entered their ship.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mom, you have been hiding a lot from me.&#8221; Now, when it was
      just the two of them, Han Sen started his interrogation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan simply smiled in response, saying, &#8220;What did I hide from
      you?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You never told me that my grandfather was Godslayer Luo.&#8221; Han
      Sen was eager to know more.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hide it; I guess I just never spoke about it. If you
      wanted to know, I would have told you.&#8221; Luo Sulan blinked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know what to say in response. After a few moments of
      silence, he had a question he wanted to ask. &#8220;If your family is that
      powerful, how can we be bullied by our second uncles and aunts?&#8221;
