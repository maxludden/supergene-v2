  Han Sen frowned, and a three-foot-long pipe that looked like it was made of grey stone showed up in his hands.

That stone pipe was a geno core called Blow Blood that Han Sen had obtained from Ghost Eye. He had been using his geno core Real Blood to break its restrictions, so both geno cores had been sitting unused in his Sea of Soul.

Han Sen almost forgot about it, until he heard a voice in his head.

> “Obtained Emperor Geno Core Blow Blood.”

Han Sen then discovered that the restrictions on Blow Blood had been removed by Real Blood, and the emperor core had been activated so that Han Sen could use it any time.

Han Sen needed to use the Blood Legion technique to summon Destiny’s Tower, so he wouldn’t be able to use that core for very long. Now that he had another emperor geno core, it was time for Han Sen to see how useful it would be.

“So Ghost Eye wasn’t lying. It is indeed an emperor geno core,” Han Sen whispered, lifting Blow Blood in his hands. The fact that the panther had told the truth was actually rather surprising.

He saw Destroyer Wolf approaching him, so he didn’t have much time to think anymore. Han Sen infused his power into Blow Blood, and he used it like a knife. He raced toward Destroyer Wolf with it.

Dang!

A terrifying force hit Blow Blood, and Han Sen lost his grip on the geno core. It flew out of his hands. Han Sen also hit the mountain behind him, spitting blood out.

“Damn, is that really an emperor geno core? Why is it completely useless?” Han Sen was deeply upset. The geno core didn’t seem to be doing him any good.

Other than being so solid that even the Destroyer Wolf’s teeth couldn’t break it, it didn’t exert any exceptional power, and it was even inferior to Han Sen’s Taia Sword.

The Destroyer Wolf didn’t give Han Sen a chance to think. It dashed toward Han Sen in an instant. With its powers of death and space, it reached toward Han Sen’s chest.

Weng!

Han Sen summoned his Destiny’s Tower. After a shocking sound, Blow Blood flew up off the ground and shot toward Han Sen like an arrow.

The Destroyer Wolf sensed that something was flying toward it with incredible energy. It gave up attacking Han Sen and tried to dodge. Blow Blood fell into Han Sen’s palm.

Blow Blood was rippling with power. Han Sen grabbed it with his hands, but he didn’t know how to use it.

That strike had proven that Blow Blood shouldn’t be used like an ordinary blade or sword, so Han Sen couldn’t figure out how to use it instantly.

“What? Why is the geno core of Drink Blood Emperor in your hands? And why is it activated?” When Destroyer Wolf identified Blow Blood, it looked shocked.

Drink Blood Emperor had been very famous, and Blow Blood had been one of the top ten geno cores in the sanctuary. Destroyer Wolf wasn’t a stranger to it; instead, the creature was kind of intimidated by it.

However, it was only afraid for a short while. After an instant, Destroyer Wolf dismissed his own fear, becoming hostile and belligerent again. It said coldly, “I might have been intimidated by this thing yesterday, but not anymore. I’ve merged myself with the most perfect and powerful genes, and that geno core is nothing to me. Even if Drink Blood Emperor comes here himself, he’ll regret it.”

Destroyer Wolf rushed toward Han Sen with his raging powers of space and death. The creature was even more ferocious than last time.

Just as Han Sen was thinking about how to use Blow Blood, the geno core started to move without his control. One end of the stone pipe touched Han Sen’s lips, while the other end pointed right at Destroyer Wolf.

“Is it like a flute? Should I just blow it?” Han Sen tried to blow it.

After that, the air and blood inside Han Sen’s body felt like they were tumbling, and the blood of his heart flooded out his mouth and into that stone pipe.

A bloody arrow was fired out of the stone pipe, and it flew directly at the Destroyer Wolf’s paws as it rushed toward Han Sen. The Destroyer Wolf failed to dodge it.

Pa!

The bloody arrow cut off a part of the Destroyer Wolf’s paw, disrupting its powers of space and death.

“Wow. No wonder it’s called ‘Blow Blood geno core.’ I can actually blow my blood out with this thing.” Han Sen was surprised but exhilarated.

The power of Blow Blood was amazing, and it was indeed an emperor geno core. One spit of blood could cut through the evolved Destroyer Wolf’s paw. He was only concerned about the fact that he was using up his own blood, as he didn’t have much blood to lose.

Destroyer Wolf roared furiously, and it moved into a space fault. Then it appeared at Han Sen’s back, trying to tear him apart.

Han Sen then saw something amazing; when the Destroyer Wolf moved, Blow Blood moved as well. The end of the pipe pointed right at Destroyer Wolf as it emerged. Han Sen didn’t hesitate at all, and he blew his blood out again.

Though Destroyer Wolf was very fast, the bloody arrow still hit its legs and tore a gruesome wound. Blood flooded out.

Han Sen clenched his teeth, and he blew his blood out again and again without paying attention to what reached Destroyer Wolf and what didn’t. Then, he leaped back into the lake and swam away from the underground cave.

Destroyer Wolf didn’t dare to fight the bloody arrows directly. After it dodged the attacks, it rushed out to chase Han Sen.

Neither of them realized that one of the bloody arrows Han Sen fired reached the female whose blood had been sucked dry, and the blood sipped into her body.

After that bloody arrow entered her body, her face regained color, and she gradually became more and more lively. The blood flooded the woman’s body, flowing in her veins, making her more and more dynamic as if her body was gradually recovering.

Her originally hollow eyes became more dynamic, losing the dullness that had haunted them since she was born.

All the bloody arrows that Han Sen unleashed fell on the ground, and the blood rolled toward the woman as if it were being attracted by a magnet.

Drops of blood sank through her skin and slipped into her veins, and she became more and more lively, and her face turned redder and redder. She now finally looked like an actual living creature.

The woman had been full of a deathly power, but she lost that ability after absorbing Han Sen’s blood. Instead, she was now giving out a bizarre power. It had the silence of death, but it also felt rather different.

Even if Han Sen was there, he wouldn’t have been able to tell exactly how it was different. He could only feel that something had changed.

Han Sen and the Destroyer Wolf had no idea what kind of strange alterations were happening to the woman. A human and a wolf hurtled out of Rolling Dragon Lake, and the wolf chased the human into the sky.
