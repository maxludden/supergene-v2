<h2>Stone Field</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2415</h3>

<p>The xenogeneic space was a very rocky landscape. The ships
landed amidst an enormous field of stones, and the passengers of
the ships made camp nearby.</p>
<p>On Miss Mirror’s orders, the Spring Rain members began digging
into the stone field, unearthing even more rocks.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t instruct Han Sen to do anything, other than
telling him to stay in camp. While he didn’t have to do any
digging, his ability to wander around as he wished was limited.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Miss Mirror what sort of place they had come to
and what their mission was there, but she didn’t answer him. She
just told him that he would be safe as long as he stayed close, and
he would be called for when the time came for him to work.</p>
<p>“This is the xenogeneic space Ning Yue described. Ning Yue’s
little green sword came from one of the rocks that was found here.
It looks like Miss Mirror’s task here is the same as it was for the
Hell. They want to excavate something out of all this stone,” Han
Sen thought to himself. He really wanted to join the others in the
stone field, so he could examine the rocks.</p>
<p>But Miss Mirror was very firm that he shouldn’t leave camp, so
joining the others was out of the question.</p>
<p>Instead, Han Sen spent his time studying his geno arts and
absorbing King class xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>On their second day in the xenogeneic space, something occurred
in the stone fields. A few Spring Rain members had to be carried
back to camp. When Han Sen heard the commotion and came over to
see, he found that the unfortunate individuals were turning into
stone. Not long after, their entire bodies were fully petrified.
They were just a bunch of statues.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror and the two deified elites tried to stop the
petrification process, but they could do nothing. None of their
attempts even seemed to slow the transformation.</p>
<p>After this, the work in the stone fields was brought to a halt.
Although they were no longer digging, Miss Mirror showed no sign of
wanting to leave.</p>
<p>More ships arrived a few days later, bringing many different
creatures to the camp. They were from a variety of different races,
and all of them were Marquises or Dukes. They must have been
brought there to become workers in the stone field.</p>
<p>“Ning Yue.” As Han Sen watched the workers line up to register,
he saw a pretty woman with pink armor. He recognized her as Ning
Yue, and he felt his eyes widen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Not because Ning Yue was now a woman; Han
Sen knew that little factoid already.</p>
<p>It wasn’t strange that Ning Yue was actually there, either. Ning
Yue would have been looking for a chance to come back, so he could
find out what happened to his body. The Extreme King had recruited
workers, so it was reasonable that Ning Yue had joined their
ranks.</p>
<p>Han Sen was simply surprised by what he wore. He had a little
pink dress on, and he also had some pink earrings, rings,
necklaces, and red flowers in his hair. He was like a pink lady,
and he was genuinely pretty. If Han Sen hadn’t seen Ning Yue
before, he definitely wouldn’t have been able to recognize him.</p>
<p>“Oh no! What is wrong with Ning Yue? Even if his body turned
into the body of a woman, it doesn’t mean he has to dress up as
one,” Han Sen thought to himself. The longer he watched Ning Yue,
the more convinced he became that something was deeply wrong.</p>
<p>“How to talk to Ning Yue alone?” Han Sen wanted to ask him what
had happened, but he wasn’t permitted to talk to the workers. Even
if he could, everyone would be watching. There was nowhere they
could discuss matters privately.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it overnight. And the next day, he barged
into Miss Mirror’s office.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror! Miss Mirror! You brought me here, and yet you
aren’t letting me do anything. You won’t let me out, and you won’t
even let me go on the internet. What is this?” Han Sen
demanded.</p>
<p>“My Lady, we couldn’t stop the prince! He just barged in,” the
guards said tensely, trying to explain his sudden intrusion.</p>
<p>“You guys can leave,” Miss Mirror said in a cool voice. Her
pretty eyes didn’t even glance their way. Instead, she kept her
focus fixed on the documents she was reading.</p>
<p>After the guards closed the door, Han Sen said, “Even if you
don’t want to let me out, at least allow me to do something. If I’m
stuck at home all day again, I am going to go crazy. And Bao’er is
just a kid. She can’t remain cooped up all day, either.”</p>
<p>“You are the one who asked to bring her here. She is entirely
your responsibility.” Miss Mirror closed the file and looked at Han
Sen. “You will be given your task when the time comes. But for now,
your job is just to wait patiently in camp.”</p>
<p>“Fine. I can do that, but can you at least make nicer food?
Plus, I want Bao’er to have a maid to look after her. That isn’t
too much to ask, is it?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“We are here to work. We aren’t here on vacation.” After a brief
pause, Miss Mirror said, “I will find you a maid. Now go home.”</p>
<p>“That’s better. Find a pretty one, though. It annoys me if the
maid is ugly,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for a maid, or are you looking for a woman?”
Miss Mirror asked sternly.</p>
<p>“I am Prince Sixteen. Is there something wrong with having a
woman to please me?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Prince Sixteen?” Miss Mirror shot Han Sen a flat look.</p>
<p>Han Sen coughed. “I wasn’t going to do anything. I just want
someone to look after my kid. But you won’t let me go out, and I
must make myself look like more of a prince.”</p>
<p>“Any other concerns you would like to share?” Miss Mirror asked,
fixing Han Sen with another unnerving stare.</p>
<p>“No,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“If there is nothing more you require, then go home. I have work
to attend to,” Miss Mirror said in clear dismissal.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go now. Please be considerate when picking a maid for
me,” Han Sen said. Miss Mirror stared at him until he left the
office.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Miss Mirror will just pick a worker? If she picks a
worker, I think Ning Yue will have a high chance of being
selected,” Han Sen thought as he walked. It was all he could do,
after all.</p>
<p>If Miss Mirror didn’t pick a worker, then Han Sen would have to
find another way to get some alone time with his target.</p>
<p>The next day, after Han Sen opened the door to take Bao’er to
the canteen to eat, he saw a pretty Extreme King woman standing
directly before him.</p>
<p>“My Prince, Miss Mirror asked me to serve you.” The woman bowed
to Han Sen, but her face was expressionless.</p>
<p>“Not bad! What’s your name?” Han Sen smiled at the woman.</p>
<p>He had been prepared for this possibility, so he wasn’t
disappointed. If Miss Mirror had picked any random person, Han Sen
would have grown suspicious.</p>
<p>“Falling Leaf,” the woman answered.</p>
<p>“Falling Leaf, huh? Not bad. Not bad. Miss Mirror didn’t
disappoint me. Come. Let’s go find something to eat.” Han Sen
squinted slightly, lifting a smiling Bao’er up to sit on his
shoulder. Then the trio made their way to the canteen.</p>
<p>While they ate, Han Sen turned to Bao’er’s new maid. “Falling
Leaf, your mission is to take care of Bao’er. Satisfy all her
desires. You cannot make her cry. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Falling Leaf answered, her voice smooth and
emotionless.</p>
