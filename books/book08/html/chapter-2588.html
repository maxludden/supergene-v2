<p>“This must be happening because of the jian.” Han Sen gritted
his teeth, but no matter how long he spent trying to find out what
the precise problem was, he couldn’t figure it out. That made Han
Sen feel very unsettled.</p>
<p>Most of Han Sen’s discomfort was because of what had happened to
Ning Yue. The man had been ruined by the green sword that he found.
What happened to him was scary, and Han Sen was now worried that
the purple copper jian would ruin him as well.</p>
<p>Ning Yue’s personality and body had been wholly changed. He now
seemed almost entirely like a woman. Han Sen was afraid he would
end up transformed into a purple fox or something. He wasn’t going
to let that happen.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly thought of the white tiger’s face and why it
looked so familiar. He realized that he had recognized the
expression; the white tiger looked at him in the same way he looked
at Ning Yue.</p>
<p>“That d*mn tiger knew something like this was going to happen.”
Han Sen felt so angry.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t figure out a solution to this dilemma, though.
Han Sen then used his super god spirit body. He wanted to use the
invincible powers of the super god spirit body to rid himself of
any debilitating effects.</p>
<p>After Han Sen used his super god spirit body, the fox ears and
tail suddenly burned away. It made Han Sen let out a big sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>“It is lucky I have a super god spirit body. I won’t end up like
Ning Yue with this,” Han Sen said, pounding his chest.</p>
<p>When Ji Yanran and Ling’er saw that Han Sen’s fox tail and ears
were gone, they looked disappointed. It was like they had lost
their favorite toy.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t care about their disappointment, though. He
didn’t like looking weird. After deactivating the super god spirit
body, he stroked his head and touched his behind. Everything was
okay now. He felt much safer.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s joy was short-lived. When he went for a walk with
Ling’er later that day, the people in the streets started pointing
at him. One girl giggled hysterically. A worried sensation began to
gnaw at Han Sen’s stomach.</p>
<p>He touched his head, and he realized that the fox ears had
suddenly grown back. The tail was back as well, lifting his clothes
awkwardly.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face changed. Ling’er, on the other hand, was happy.
She sat on Han Sen’s shoulder, playing with the ears with one in
each hand. She kept rubbing them, looking delighted.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly flew to a place with no one around. And then, he
teleported home. He used his super god spirit body to rid himself
of the queer physical attributes.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen immediately teleported back to the
geno universe. He threw the purple copper jian into the black sea.
Once he made sure that the purple copper jian had sunk below the
waves, he returned to the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Not long after, Han Sen noticed that the purple copper jian was
attached to the belt on his waist.</p>
<p>“How is that possible?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>He was now in the sanctuaries, and yet the purple copper jian
had somehow reappeared next to him. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>The purple copper jian had only been with him for a matter of
seconds, and already his ears and tail were growing again.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to get rid of the jian many times. However, even
if he placed the weapon on a planet inside the core area, he
wouldn’t be rid of it for long. In a short amount of time, it would
reappear next to him.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen knew he had suffered a misfortune that was similar
to Ning Yue’s. A weird weapon was stuck with him, and there was
nothing he could do to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen regretted his recent choices. He shouldn’t have
taken the purple copper jian. If he had known this was going to
happen, he would have allowed Gu Qingcheng or Elysian Moon to take
and wield it. It was more acceptable for a woman to have fox ears
and a tail.</p>
<p>It was too late to think of that now, though. When they saw Han
Sen, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon tried their best not to laugh.
They pretended there was nothing amiss, but Han Sen could sense
that they were laughing incredibly hard on the inside.</p>
<p>“Can anyone tell me what this is?” Han Sen asked, throwing the
purple copper jian in front of the white tiger.</p>
<p>“Meow,” the white tiger said. It smiled with its moon-like
eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t speak the language of beasts, but he could tell
it was laughing.</p>
<p>“F*ck you. Tell me now, what is this? Tell me how to get rid of
it. If you don’t, I’ll skin you alive,” Han Sen threatened the
white tiger, grabbing it angrily.</p>
<p>The white tiger mewed a little, but Han Sen didn’t understand
what it was trying to tell him. When Han Sen let the creature go,
it hurriedly disappeared amidst the rocks.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t do anything. He made many attempts to separate
himself from the weapon, but he couldn’t be free of it.</p>
<p>But fortunately, the situation didn’t become any worse. Aside
from the fox ears on his head and the fox tail on his butt, there
was nothing else wrong with him.</p>
<p>The only silver lining in all this was that the head-mushrooms
were no longer an issue for Han Sen. When the fox tail and ears
grew, the mushroom on his head didn’t.</p>
<p>“The mushrooms are gone, but now I have the ears to contend
with. What do these things think my brain is? A hotel?” Han Sen was
very angry, but he had no way of resolving the matter.</p>
<p>“Dad, you look good like this.” Bao’er tilted her head to look
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I look good, my *ss.” Han Sen grumbled, but he had no choice
but to accept it. He couldn’t keep on using his super god spirit
body every five minutes.</p>
<p>“You’ll get used to it. That is what happened to me,” Ning Yue
said quietly.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked over at Ning Yue’s girly appearance. He felt a
chill as he thought, “No way. I must get rid of this crap! I can’t
end up like Ning Yue.”</p>
<p>Despite Han Sen’s determination, reality seemed set on
disappointing him. The real world was cruel. Han Sen used many
methods to try to free himself from the fox ears and tail, but
nothing seemed to work.</p>
<p>That day, Han Sen ransacked his mind for ideas on how to get rid
of his fox-like features. Suddenly, he saw a strong shift in the
fabric of space. A scary purple knife air broke through the mist
and cut through the air around him.</p>
<p>“Teeth power… is that…” Seeing that knife air, Han Sen was
shocked. Only one other person could use Teeth power in such a
frightening way.</p>
<p>A second after the display of knife air, Han Sen saw someone
drop through the air to land on the island. That person was clad in
purple armor. It was Yisha, and as she landed in a crouch, she
looked like a bad*ss.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” Han Sen was so happy. He never expected to see Yisha
there.</p>
<p>“There is no time. Follow me!” Yisha said coldly. Her face
didn’t show much in the way of emotion.</p>
<p>But Han Sen knew that it must have taken a lot of effort for
Yisha to come all the way to get him. Han Sen could even see that
Yisha’s armor was riddled with many cuts and dents. He was so
touched.</p>
<p>Yisha was his teacher, but not many teachers would be willing to
break into the Black Hole Spider’s belly to save their
students.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly gathered his people to board the white whale,
then he followed Yisha through the mist.</p>
<p>Yisha’s expression remained impassive. Her knife unleashed Teeth
powers that spread through the endless mist. Yisha was bringing Han
Sen and the others with her. They followed the crack in space that
Teeth Knife created.</p>
