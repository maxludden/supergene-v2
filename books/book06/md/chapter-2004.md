  The Red Reaper’s scythe slashed across the Stone Cow’s neck, but all it dealt was a minor scratch. It couldn’t even be considered an injury.

After all, there was a level difference between the two. Han Sen couldn’t blame the Red Reaper for not being strong enough.

But after the attack, the Stone Cow was only enraged. It turned around and looked at the Red Reaper. It reared with its legs and stamped down on the ground to create another shockwave.

The Red Reaper was petrified in mid-air. It dropped down to the ground and cracked, like an ordinary statue.

“Damn! This guy’s petrification is effective. It even took down the Red Reaper, which is practically smoke. Fortunately, it isn’t really a creature, and it’s only something shaped by a geno art,” Han Sen thought, shocked.

Han Sen’s body brimmed with energy, and from it, he generated another Red Reaper. Again, it moved to attack the Stone Cow. Han Sen wanted to buy some time.

He tried The Story of Genes, the Dongxuan Sutra, Jadeskin, and the Blood-Pulse Sutra, but none of them could free him from the petrification.

“Should I use super god spirit mode?” Han Sen frowned. But then, he suddenly remembered he had the Petrify skill. It was a little different than the Stone Cow’s petrification, in that he could only use it on himself. But perhaps it would work here.

Han Sen cast Petrify and petrified his own body. He deepened the power of the effect, petrifying himself far beyond what the Stone Cow had managed.

When Han Sen removed his petrification, the Stone Cow’s petrification disappeared as well.

“I did not expect Petrify to be this useful.” Han Sen grinned.

Meanwhile, the Stone Cow had just shattered the Red Reaper. It angrily turned back toward Han Sen, stomping the ground again to produce more shockwaves.

Han Sen pulled out his knife and slashed towards the Stone Cow. The knife and sword powers synergized into one and came out of Ghost Teeth Knife’s blade, headed right for the Stone Cow.

The knife and sword power struck the cow’s head. There was a boom, and the Stone Cow reeled backwards with a deep gash across its body. The knife and sword power had broken the creature’s horns.

The Stone Cow shook its head and got up. It wasn’t impaired by the attack. It roared and ran straight back at Han Sen.

Han Sen removed his petrification and slashed towards the Stone Cow again. The attack wasn’t very effective, though.

It could only move the Stone Cow back a little, and it left him petrified again.

The Stone Cow’s circular shockwave was an area-of-effect attack. It did not matter what direction Han Sen attacked from; he was petrified each time.

As the Stone Cow came for him again, Han Sen decided not to slash it this time. He used Turtle. And when Han Sen was petrified the next time, he cast it onto the beast’s head.

A turtle symbol glowed atop the cow’s head. Han Sen thought to himself, “It does not matter how strong you are, Turtle turns everyone into a slowpoke.”

Before Han Sen struck again, the Stone Cow stopped and created more shockwaves.

But this was stronger than the Stone Cow’s previous attacks. Han Sen removed the petrification, but he also noticed he had slowed down. He lowered his head and realized that the turtle symbol was now on him.

“Shit! The Stone Cow can reverse a geno art?” Han Sen was shocked. The Stone Cow kept stomping and stamping.

Each step sent out another shockwave.

Han Sen kept getting petrified, and each time it happened, another turtle image appeared on his body.

“F*ck this! This Stone Cow is too creepy.” Han Sen got rid of the petrification and Turtle effects. Then, he slashed towards the Stone Cow and ran.

Until he figured out what the thing could do, he would only be able to kill it with super god spirit.

The Stone Cow was directly behind Han Sen, mooing. It was extremely annoying, and Han Sen thought, “Wait until I become a Marquise, and I’ll be back to one-hit kill you. You won’t have nearly as much fun when you’re not bullying an Earl.”

Han Sen grew more and more frustrated as he ran. The Stone Cow’s shockwaves kept petrifying him. The Stone Cow would probably have already killed an average Marquise, especially since they wouldn’t be able to run away.

Fortunately, Han Sen had Petrify and the rabbit shoes.

Han Sen escaped the Stone Cow’s pursuit. He wiped the cold sweat from his brow and said, “That cannot be a Marquise mutant xenogeneic!”

Han Sen did not want to leave just yet. He allowed Spell to engage her sniper mode, and with it, he used her sniper scope to watch the Stone Cow.

Han Sen’s nose wrinkled in disgust. The Stone Cow was eating the other Stone Cow’s meat. It swallowed the xenogeneic gene heart before Han Sen could take it.

Han Sen thought the Stone Cow was angry because its relative had been murdered. But that thing seemed willing to eat the remains of its own people. It just wanted to eat the prey that someone else had gone to the work of killing.

“F*ck you! Let’s see who can last longer.” Han Sen began to think of ways he might get rid of the Stone Cow.

Its body was hard, so it must have been of the top tier of the Marquises. It would take multiple attacks at close range to hurt the Stone Cow.

However, because of the petrifying shockwaves, Han Sen could not get close. While Han Sen could remove the petrification, it took time. While he was petrified, Han Sen could not move. It was a difficult problem.

The scariest thing was how the Stone Cow could flip the turtle skill back onto him. That was just over-powered.

“No. It is not just reflecting the effect back to me, since the turtle spell remains active on the Stone Cow. The turtle symbol only disappeared when the power faded. While under Turtle’s effects, the Stone Cow did move slower and its shockwave was less effective. This is not just a reversal of my own attacks,” Han Sen thought.

Han Sen wanted to prove his theory correct, so he used his sniper rifle to take aim at the Stone Cow. Then he pulled the trigger.

Han Sen pulled ammo from the Turtle spell. The bullet went flying towards the Stone Cow.

The thing was still munching on the dead cow’s body when the bullet smacked into its butt. The image of a turtle appeared on its bum.

Moo! The Stone Cow spun around angrily, already stomping the ground to send out shockwaves.

But Han Sen was not petrified, and he did not have the Turtle skill reversed upon him. The turtle mark was still planted on the cow’s bum.

“Success,” Han Sen said with a smile.
