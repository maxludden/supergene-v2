    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face changed. The silver fox had only just been born, but
      it was already so quick. What&#8217;s more, it was accelerating as it got
      nearer. Before long, it stood just five meters from them. For a brief
      moment, Han Sen thought about summoning his wings to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the silver fox didn&#8217;t do anything. It just stood there watching
      Han Sen with its phoenix-like eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart was chilled, and he took a few steps back, removing
      himself from Yi Dong Mu&#8217;s proximity. He thought to himself,
      &#8220;What are you looking at me for? The person who attacked you is
      right there.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      But the silver fox didn&#8217;t look at Yi Dong Mu at all. Its eyes just
      traced Han Sen&#8217;s every move, which scared him.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen moved to the left, his steps were accompanied by the silver
      fox&#8217;s gaze.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart was thumping, and he said, &#8220;Oh no! Are this
      creature&#8217;s eyes so weak that it can&#8217;t recognize who harmed
      it?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dong Mu was still on the floor, but then all of a sudden, he quickly
      summoned another pair of purple wings and flew off into the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thanks so much, I&#8217;ll make sure to pay you back later!&#8221;
      Yi Dong Mu said, as he flew away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was angry, and said to himself, &#8220;What an ungrateful son of a
      troll! If I hadn&#8217;t saved you earlier, you&#8217;d be fox-puppy chow.
      And now you leave me here, all alone?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dong Mu didn&#8217;t even look back as he ascended - he just flew right
      above the Ice Valley and soared away. It wasn&#8217;t long before he had
      totally vanished from sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew that Yi Dong Mu had been heavily injured and left unable to
      fight. As such, he wasn&#8217;t really angry at him. It was a matter of
      principle, more than anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox continued to stare at Han Sen, but did so with a puzzled
      expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not feel that the silver fox was being aggressive and intended
      to kill him. But it was natural for creatures to do this, and such habits
      were not easily hidden. Still, Han Sen knew that the fox did not intend to
      murder him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as the fox stood there, staring at him, Han Sen couldn&#8217;t help
      but feel uneasy. After all, a creature&#8217;s whim can change in an
      instant. What if it became hungry in the next instant and decided to use
      Han Sen for a snack?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, little guy. Your bones have grown really strong, and your
      face has a holy aura; you&#8217;ll undoubtedly grow to become something
      quite powerful in the future. But if you want to eat, eat a sacred-blood
      creature or something. Not me. My flesh is cheap and lacks the nutrients a
      young and healthy fox such as yourself would require.&#8221; As Han Sen
      tried to appease the silver fox, he slowly stepped backwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      But every step back that Han Sen took, the silver fox stepped forwards.
      When Han Sen went left, it went right. The way it stared seemed to suggest
      that it recognised him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, what are you following me for?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s mind
      raced, wondering what exactly was going on.
    </p>

    <p>All of a sudden, he thought – cats and dogs loved to chase things!</p>

    <p>
      People would often throw balls for cats and dogs to catch or chase. The
      fox wasn&#8217;t too different from a cat or a dog - perhaps it shared the
      same habit?
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen rummaged through his pockets, but was unable to find a ball. All
      he could find was a fist-sized bottle. Inside it, however, was an elixir
      worth a tens of thousands. This was the sort of medicine he wasn&#8217;t
      willing to spend on Yi Dong Mu. With his own life on the line, however, he
      just bit down and lobbed the bottle away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was only trying to see what would happen, before the silver fox
      thought iof killing him. As he had hoped, the silver fox watched where the
      bottle went, sprang to its feet and chased after it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was delighted, as he hadn&#8217;t been sure whether it would
      actually work. With the time he&#8217;d just bought himself, he
      immediately turned and started running. The last thing he wanted to do was
      displease a super creature, and after seeing what had happened to Yi Dong
      Mu, he was aware of the stakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen hadn&#8217;t run far when he saw the silver fox running across
      the white snow. Despite running as fast as he could, the silver fox was
      able to catch up with him with ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the silver fox&#8217;s mouth, the creature was holding the bottle Han
      Sen had thrown away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was flabbergasted at how quickly the silver fox had caught up with
      him, and knew that his own running speed was nowhere close enough. Now he
      was seriously considering the prospect of summoning his wings and taking
      to the skies.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the next second, Han Sen gave up that idea. The silver fox then chose
      to rapidly climb a tall rock pillar, and when it reached the top, it
      jumped. Its leap arced over ten meters, and the speed at which it soared
      was faster than Han Sen&#8217;s Berserk sacred-blood wings. If Han Sen
      really did summon his wings, and that angered the silver fox, he was
      likely to incur a far more grievous attack than what befell Yi Dong Mu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stopped running, feeling hopeless. The silver fox also stopped and
      stood just a meter away. It placed the medicine bottle on the ground near
      Han Sen&#8217;s feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good boy.&#8221; Han Seen forced a smile. He wanted to pat the
      silver fox on his head and stroke it in congratulations, but he only
      stretched his arms out at half-length before freezing.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a super creature. If he reached out his hand and the silver fox
      did not think kindly of his approach and got angry, he would likely lose
      his arm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen stop moving, the silver fox walked closer. It gently
      approached his leg and began licking it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was so terrified that he almost kicked the silver fox in the face.
      But when he looked down, he noticed that the silver fox was licking him
      where Yi Dong Mu had bit him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the bleeding had stopped, the wound remained. But when the silver
      fox started licking it, something strange happened. With his own two eyes,
      Han Sen witnessed his wounds mysteriously vanish.
    </p>

    <p>
      He froze, almost unable to believe that the silver fox was healing him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox took a few steps back and like a cute little girl, stood to
      look up at him with a tilted head.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was perplexed and all at once, he felt his entire past
      understanding of creatures had not only been subverted but flipped
      entirely on its head.
    </p>

    <p>
      He tried reaching out his hand again and thought to stroke the silver
      fox&#8217;s head, but still, a fear nagged at him not to do it. His hand
      froze in place once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then the silver fox elegantly approached and actively placed its own
      head into the palms of Han Sen&#8217;s hand. It closed its eyes and rubbed
      its head there, seeming to enjoy it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is this thing really a wild creature?&#8221; Han Sen wasn&#8217;t
      quite sure what to say, so he engaged the silver fox himself. With that
      same hand, he began stroking its head.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was like a little girl, in the way that it was cute when
      Han Sen stroked its head. Just seeing the creature made you want to hug
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No. Foxes are cunning. Is this thing just tricking me into hugging
      it? Maybe it&#8217;s making me lower my guard, so it can attack me before
      I get a chance to defend myself!&#8221; Han Sen told himself. This was a
      super creature, after all, so he couldn&#8217;t afford to drop his guard.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after Han Sen stroked the silver fox a few more times, the creature
      walked between his legs and used its body to rub against them. It
      genuinely seemed as if it wanted some love.
