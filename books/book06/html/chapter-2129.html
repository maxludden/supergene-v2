<h2>Final Fight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2129</h3>

<p>Xie Qing King was too severely injured and too exhausted to
continue in the geno rank fights, so he ended up placing in the top
eight. The people that watched him and Odoga fight, however, were
of the firm belief that one of those two should have taken first
place. Unfortunately, the two powerhouses had ended up against each
other far too soon. One was defeated and beaten into a sorry state,
and the other was victorious but also beaten into a sorry
state.</p>
<p>The ranked fights continued with some surprising results. On the
fourth match of the King tier, Yisha actually ended up losing,
which surprised her many fans. Her final position rested at rank
number four.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t there to watch the fight, so he was unsure what
had led to her defeat. That being said, according to what he had
heard, something strange occurred during the bout.</p>
<p>Han Littleflower got to his final fight easily. His Sacred
powers allowed him to manipulate space and time, and no Viscount
was able to challenge that technique in the field of battle.</p>
<p>No one was stronger than Han Littleflower, so it was highly
likely that he would gain the number one position after completing
his final fight.</p>
<p>If not for Evil Eye, Han Sen would have been a shoo-in for
winning the entire Marquise tier bracket. But alas, it was not so.
With Evil Eye being there, there was no guarantee that Han Sen
would be victorious.</p>
<p>Han Sen had watched Evil Eye’s fights with intense focus. The
man looked frightening, but Han Sen thought there was something off
about him. What that was precisely, Han Sen could not put his
finger on.</p>
<p>Han Sen called Yisha to highlight his concern. He wanted to
comfort her after her loss, too.</p>
<p>“My Queen, I will come to Narrow Moon and visit you in just a
few short days.”</p>
<p>Yisha sat on her throne with her long white legs crossed
comfortably before her. She looked at Han Sen through the video
feed, smiled, and said, “You are coming back to comfort me?”</p>
<p>“No. You are the strongest woman of all. You simply missed and
that’s it.” Han Sen’s comforting skills already seemed to be
lacking.</p>
<p>Yisha still smiled, and she looked at Han Sen. “The Meka made a
generous offer in exchange for their win. We have what we need now.
Did you honestly believe I would lose?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised by this revelation. That was not what he
had expected from Yisha at all.</p>
<p>Yisha continued to smile and said, “The Rebate are a high race,
but we are not like Sky Palace. We don’t have anyone deified. We
need to grow a great deal to remain competitive. So, we had to give
up something. That was just how it had to be.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood that she had allowed herself to lose despite
her ardent desire to win. She had not lost to a genuine enemy in
battle; she had lost to politics.</p>
<p>“Go back to Sky Palace. These matters aren’t your concern. You
need to level up and become a King. Only then can you play these
games. Right now, you aren’t even a spare piece on the table of
play,” Yisha said, then abruptly hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that his level was still too low. The Story of
Genes was too difficult, and he repeatedly mulled the idea of just
giving it up. He could level up his other three geno arts to the
rank of King instead.</p>
<p>The final fight for the Marquise tier was about to start, and
Dollar and Evil Eye’s names were on the tip of every tongue. It was
the hottest topic of the day.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had shown powerful attacks, Dragon Eight was
the only opponent that he had defeated with true raw power. Lone
Bamboo’s non-fight had also disappointed a great many people.</p>
<p>Evil Eye’s track record over multiple lives was too impressive,
so most people thought that Evil Eye would be the one to win the
fight. After all, Evil Eye had been deified many times before, and
so he was the sort to see things differently. This point alone made
him the likeliest candidate for victory.</p>
<p>Still, it was not all doom and gloom in Dollar’s corner. Many
nobles still placed their faith in him becoming victorious. They
loved Dollar. Up until now, at least, Dollar had proved that Dollar
could defeat anything. Many people loved it.</p>
<p>At a gambling station located on a certain planet, a dirtbike
pulled up. The man who rode it came inside and dropped a heavy bag
on the table. When the workers opened the bag, their eyebrows rose
and wide smiles spread across their faces. One of them quickly
said, “Dear customer, who are you placing your money and faith
in?”</p>
<p>“What’s the winning forecast look like for Dollar?” the man
asked.</p>
<p>“1.84,” the worker answered. Then, he looked at the man with the
dirtbike strangely.</p>
<p>Most people believed Evil Eye would win, so there was no way
he’d be forecasted to lose. Nobody put their bets on Dollar.</p>
<p>“I bet that Dollar will win,” the man said as he straightened
his sunglasses.</p>
<p>If the man was willing to give away a sack of free money, then
none of the workers would turn him down. The worker cashed it in
and gave the man a receipt.</p>
<p>“Dumb*ss. He put all of his money on Dollar winning. The whole
universe knows Evil Eye won’t lose,” the worker said, upon seeing
the man with a motorbike take his leave.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang safely pocketed the receipt and went on his merry
way to a xenogeneic hunting zone.</p>
<p>When the final fight began, everyone was able to watch it. Only
two other creatures were still engaged in fights of their own.</p>
<p>In the past, the most famous and well-attended fights would
always take place in the King tier. But this year, things were
different. Marquises and Viscounts had received a lot of attention
this time around, particularly the Marquises. Because of Dollar and
Evil Eye, that tier of fights received more attention than King
class fights.</p>
<p>The Viscount tier received the focus it did because of
Littleflower and little else. But even then, there was nothing much
to watch in his fights. It wasn’t as if people believed any other
Viscount could defeat Littleflower, who wielded those Sacred
powers.</p>
<p>“It’s going to start! I wonder how long Dollar will be able to
last against Evil Eye.” Dragon Eight and Dragon Nine were keenly
watching the Geno Being Scroll flash. Their attention was focused
on the Marquise final fight’s battleground.</p>
<p>“If Brother Bamboo had not gone missing, it would be him
battling Evil Eye.” In Sky Palace, Thousand Feather Crane could not
help but sigh.</p>
<p>Everyone was focusing on that fight now, and that was especially
true of the research organizations. They were extremely interested
in Dollar and Evil Eye. Not even deified elites could live forever,
but Evil Eye had been reborn repeatedly. Everyone wished to know
his secret to immortality.</p>
<p>“I hope Dollar lasts as long as possible to draw out the secrets
that enshroud Evil Eye.” Sky Path Garden’s leader was keenly
watching the Geno Being Scroll.</p>
<p>“Between Dollar and Evil Eye’s secrets, we’re bound to learn
something today,” a researcher said.</p>
<p>“I want to see Evil Eye’s secret of rebirth,” the Sky Path
Garden leader coldly repeated.</p>
