The shadowed images left the inhabitants of the geno universe in a state of awe as they cycled through elite after elite. Then, they became dust across the scroll. And when all was said and done, nothing remained of them.

The names disappeared from the lists, leaving only empty brackets. All the names from a century ago were gone, including the names of the number one King, number one Duke, and number one Marquise. All that remained were the empty ranks now.

*Boom!*

All the lists cracked, breaking apart to reveal an image that seemed to tear its way through space itself. A picture was forming; one that showcased a mountain, water, stars, suns, and moons. There were seas and clouds, deserts and green fields.

This sweeping canvas had expanded across the whole sky. It cycled through the images, focusing on each one in turn. The images flashed by quickly enough to make an observer dizzy.

Countless stars began to fall from the painting. To Han Sen’s surprise, one of the stars fell directly before his feet.

When the glow diminished, he saw that a plain white sheet of paper had landed by his feet.

Han Sen glanced around at the others that were nearby. Every person around him had received a similar piece of paper, and many were already writing down their name and race. Some of the more primal creatures that lacked the ability to write would simply press their paws and claws down on the parchment to register.

But whether you wrote down your name or pressed your hand against the paper, the papers soon regained their glow and flew back into the sky, returning to the bronze scroll.

Across countless systems, many of those same star-like lights were racing off into space like an inverse meteor shower. They were all headed for the same bronze scroll.

Han Sen glanced at the paper in front of him and started to turn away. But suddenly, he felt himself compelled to write down his name as Dollar and list his race as human. As soon as Han finished writing and lifted his fingers off the paper, the registration sheet flew up into the sky and into the scroll.

“Well, if that god wants to look for a human, I will let him look. If he makes a move, then we will all be able to see what he tries.” Han Sen’s mind drifted back to the conversation he had with God’s Retribution.

While Han Sen was still mulling all of this over, his paper landed on the scroll with a strange light.

Han Sen felt his body twist and distort in a familiar fashion; it reminded him of how it felt to use a teleporter. When the process was over, and his footing was stable again, he found himself standing in the middle of a grassy field.

“It looks like I’m inside the Geno Being Scroll.” Han Sen looked around. He landed in the precise spot his sheet of paper did.

Han Sen continued looking around until he saw a giant monster rushing towards him. It was a Marquise xenogeneic.

The dinosaur-like monster came rumbling forward, but Han Sen did not move. When the monster was in front of him, he just put his hand out and touched the horn protruding from the beast’s nose.

*Boom!*

The monster stopped like it had hit a wall.

Han Sen then punched the monster, sending it flying. The monster’s body tore a trench into the ground as it skidded backwards, and it heaved up blood while it squirmed around. It quickly submitted to death.

“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Black Steel Beast: xenogeneic gene found.”

“It died that easily?” Han Sen was shocked.

When his Jadeskin leveled up to Marquise, Han Sen’s body and power became far stronger. It helped a whole lot more than the elevation of his Blood Pulse Sutra did.

Many Marquises saw this take place, and when they did, their faces changed. They quickly summoned their white papers and tore them up. Their bodies all twisted and vanished as they departed the Geno Being Scroll.

Han Sen summoned his own paper, looking down at his signature. Now he knew that if he destroyed the paper, he’d lose and be sent out of the scroll. Han Sen would never concede, of course. He commanded the paper to fly, and it hovered next to him like a fairy.

People could see the name Dollar and the race human. And Han Sen could also see the other Marquises displaying their own papers in a similar fashion.

No matter how hard or dirty a fight became, a paper couldn’t be affected by anyone other than its owner. Only the owner could decide whether or not they wanted to abandon the scroll.

Han Sen was walking on a grassy plain. He had heard that when contestants first entered the Geno Being Scroll, a bloodbath would ensue. The ten thousand left alive would appear on the list, and then a harder fight would follow to determine final ranking.

In the first fight, staying alive and in the scroll were the only things that mattered. If he lasted until there were only ten thousand people left, he’d succeed.

Because different races had different powers, some of them were choosing to hide themselves. Han Sen did not plan on hiding, though. He wanted every creature and god to know there was a human named Dollar in the geno universe.

A Dragon with wings and dragon horns walked toward Han Sen. He looked at Han Sen’s paper and smiled.

“Human? Never heard of it.”

“Dragon?” Han Sen asked the Dragon.

“Dragon Thirty-Nine. You are unlucky to encounter me,” Dragon Thirty-Nine said, raising his head. His masculine body was pumped full of hormones.

Not everyone joined the Geno Being Scroll fight, of course. Not many Dragons had decided to participate this time around. Dragon Nineteen and Dragon Nine were the only other Dragons who had decided to join.

Many Dragon elders were watching this fight, though.

Dragon Nineteen and Dragon Nine had come with Dragon Thirty-Nine, because Dragon Thirty-Nine was the weakest Dragon to participate in the Geno Being Scroll. Although he was the weakest of the Marquise Dragons, to an outsider, any pure Dragon was obscenely strong. He was only weak compared to the other pure Dragons.

“What is a human? I have never heard of it. Kill him quick and do not waste time.” Dragon Nine smiled.

Dragon Thirty-Nine seemed to hear what he said, and so he roared. Then, he threw a punch at Han Sen. A presence surged before his fist like a raging dragon.

Han Sen did not dodge, though. He just threw a punch to meet Dragon Thirty-Nine’s. He only used pure, plain strength, though. He didn’t even bother summoning a godlight.

“Ha! You’re trying to fight a Dragon with pure power? This human might be cute, but he is also naive…” Before Dragon Nine finished speaking, his face went blank.
