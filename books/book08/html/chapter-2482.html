<h2>The Man That Creates Deified Beings</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2482</h3>

<p>“This can’t be real!” As Wang Yuhang stared at the screen, it
looked like his eyes were about to pop out of their sockets.</p>
<p>Many other people were having similar reactions. Countless
elites of all sorts of different races had their eyes glued to the
screen in disbelief.</p>
<p>There were not many deifieds in the geno universe, and normal
people would never have a chance to see this process. Most people
had never even seen a deified being, other than occasional pictures
on the internet.</p>
<p>Even with the internet, it was very rare to watch a person
become deified. If there was footage of such events, it was
guaranteed to be carefully hidden and protected by the rulers of
that race. Without the correct authorization, you wouldn’t be
allowed to watch a video of someone leveling up to become
deified.</p>
<p>Right now, though, they were watching someone become deified in
a way that had never even dreamed of being possible.</p>
<p>Han Sen had brought a heavily-injured half-deified to his feet
and forced him to become deified. If they hadn’t watched it with
their own eyes, no one would have believed it to be true.</p>
<p>Even as they watched, many viewers had difficulty accepting what
their eyes were telling them. They thought this had to be some sort
of mistake, or maybe they were seeing things incorrectly.</p>
<p>Even all the deifieds across the universe stared at their
screens with rapt attention. Their mouths hung open in shock.</p>
<p>They had worked hard for years and years to become deified. They
had overcome arduous odds, dancing on the brink of death multiple
times in their bid to evolve.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had just nonchalantly touched Lando’s forehead, and
suddenly, the injured Dragon had become deified. Han Sen was just a
King, too. How were they supposed to believe this was possible?</p>
<p>“Fake! It must be fake.” Dragon One gritted his teeth. He
couldn’t believe Lando had become deified just like that.</p>
<p>Klose was struggling with the idea, as well. No one with a brain
could just accept the impossible thing they were seeing.</p>
<p>Han Sen was only a King, and a low-tier King at that. How could
he elevate someone else to deified? Even if a deified elite had
managed to bring someone else to deified, no one would believe it.
And Han Sen was just a King.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Tianxia Unicorn didn’t believe that Lando had ascended,
either. It attacked. Its scary substance chains combined to become
a gray light, and the light shot forward, punching through the
universe like a razor-sharp arrow to reach Lando.</p>
<p>The Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo writhed around Lando. He took a
step to get in front of Han Sen and punched toward the gray beam of
light.</p>
<p>Substance chains leaped from his fist, combining into a scary
purple demon dragon. It roared and went for the gray light.</p>
<p>This time, the gray light was unable to break the purple demon
dragon. The gray and purple colors collided with a deafening boom.
A black hole formed in space, and that black hole had gray and
purple powers swirling inside it. It looked like a spinning tai chi
symbol.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>A dragon’s roar shocked the sky. The purple color within the
black hole completely overwhelmed the gray, and then an enraged
dragon emerged from the black hole. It flapped its wings and soared
over to the Tianxia Unicorn.</p>
<p>The Tianxia Unicorn was stunned. Its substance chains
frantically withdrew and circled around the unicorn. The beast
tried to protect itself, but when the purple dragon struck the
protective shield, the shield snapped in two. The blow tossed the
Tianxia Unicorn a few thousand miles away before it came to a
stop.</p>
<p>“Lando really did become deified!” People watched the stream,
their minds blank. Their brains failed to function.</p>
<p>There was no longer any doubt about the fact that Lando had
become a deified. Only a deified elite could fight a deified
xenogeneic one-on-one like that.</p>
<p>Now that they knew that Lando was deified, all the creatures in
the geno universe looked at Han Sen with fire in their eyes.</p>
<p>He had brought a half-deified person up to deified. No matter
what level they were, Han Sen was a god in their eyes.</p>
<p>No. It was more like he was the father of the gods.</p>
<p>“He can produce gods!” Many half-deifieds stared at Han Sen’s
image, their eyes flaming with the lust for power.</p>
<p>King class elites required a ninth-tier area to become
half-deified, but after suffering for all that time, they had the
hope that they would somehow live long enough to achieve their real
goal. Even powerful half-deifieds could only hope for the best.</p>
<p>Taking the final step to become deified was very difficult. It
could easily take a few centuries to accomplish.</p>
<p>Few races knew how many half-deified they had, for many died
when they failed to become deified. Talent, resources, fate, luck,
effort—successful evolution required all five.</p>
<p>Many half-deified warriors had become hopeless over the years,
but today, their hope had been rekindled.</p>
<p>They would no longer have to risk their lives. They wouldn’t
have to fight and plunder rare treasures from across the universe.
They only needed the hand of one man to become deified. Just
thinking about it filled them with nervous energy. They all wanted
a piece of the Han Sen pie. They wanted him to bless them and make
them deified.</p>
<p>The Kings and Dukes, in the meanwhile, were thinking that if Han
Sen could elevate a half-deified, then surely leveling up someone
of a lesser rank would be easy.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, all the creatures in the universe looked at
Han Sen with burning eyes. They were like a bunch of men who hadn’t
had sex in thirty years, but they were now seeing a naked little
woman.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A scary power shook the image on their screens, snapping them
out of their dreams.</p>
<p>Lando was fighting the Tianxia Unicorn again. This time, Lando
wasn’t suppressed by the Tianxia Unicorn. Instead, he was the one
pushing the Tianxia Unicorn around.</p>
<p>Purple dragon substance chains flashed across the sky,
overpowering the Tianxia Unicorn’s substance chains.</p>
<p>The Tianxia Unicorn was quite strong when compared to other
deified beings. It wasn’t smart, but its raw power put it above the
majority of deified xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Lando had just become deified, and yet he was now dominating the
Tianxia Unicorn. All the creatures looked at Han Sen with even
hungrier eyes. They wanted to swallow him up.</p>
<p>In truth, the reason Lando had become so strong when he became
deified had nothing to do with Han Sen. It was because he had the
Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. That was what was giving Lando so much
strength.</p>
<p>With the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo on his back, Lando had a might
that equaled two deified creatures. The Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo
wasn’t an ordinary deified treasure, and it made Lando
extraordinarily strong.</p>
<p>But only high-ranking Dragon’s knew the significance of the
tattoo. Everyone else believed that Lando’s strength was due to Han
Sen’s help. So, they all wanted to get to know Han Sen and earn his
blessing.</p>
<p>A scream broke the sky. The Tianxia Unicorn’s horn had been
chipped. God-like blood spilled out in a heavy stream, and the
creature looked badly injured.</p>
<p>Lando went after the Tianxia Unicorn with demonic fervor. His
form looked like a purple demon dragon as he fought the Tianxia
Unicorn. His substance chains ripped and tore space every time they
moved.</p>
<p>Deified blood rained down over the clouds, dyeing everything a
deep crimson.</p>
<p>When the battle finally quieted down, the chaos of the video
stream started to resolve into discernable images once again. Many
creatures leaned forward, watching as Lando rode the bloody Tianxia
Unicorn out of the clouds. The Tianxia Unicorn looked as sad as if
its daddy had just died.</p>
