<h3>Chapter 3289</h3>

<p>Zhao Qiu Yi and Zhao Ning’er watched Han Sen explode with light.
The light expelled was so bright that they could not even open
their eyes. There was just bright light. Nothing else could be
seen.</p>
<p>After the light dimmed, Han Sen’s body vanished. All that was
left in the cave were the items Han Sen had thrown around.</p>
<p>“Han Sen… Han Sen, where are you?” Zhao Qiu Yi was in a panic as
she called out Han Sen’s name.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er sighed. “It looks like Han Sen could not make it
through. He was so strong, but not even he was able to fight the
God Chaos Party. If that is the case, who in this world can hope to
stand against the God Chaos Party?”</p>
<p>Although Zhao Qiu Yi did not believe Han Sen had died just like
that, the facts were in front of her. She had no choice but to
believe and accept it.</p>
<p>Before, Han Sen’s body had looked like it was there, but it was
not there. It seemed as if it was ready to vanish any second. The
last explosion must have used all of his energy. There could not
have been anything else left.</p>
<p>“Let’s collect his things. I heard he has a daughter in the Qin
Kingdom. I can only suppose we should return his things to his
family.” Zhao Ning’er started to collect his things.</p>
<p>Zhao Qiu Yi was very upset. She looked depressed, but she still
had to pick up all the items alongside Zhao Ning’er.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey… You guys, stop acting… Can’t you guys see me?” Han
Sen stood in front of the pair, talking to them both in shock.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi were unable to see Han Sen. They
were unable to hear him too. They could not feel his existence.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe it, so he tried to grab Zhao Ning’er,
who was currently picking up his things. His hands went right
through her body.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes opened wide. He watched his body go right through
Zhao Ning’er’s body. He was like a ghost that could not touch
anything.</p>
<p>“Does that mean… Does that mean… Am I dead?” Han Sen looked at
his hands and body in shock. From what he could tell, everything
seemed normal. Aside from him being in a spirit mode, there was
nothing else special about his circumstance. He could not accept
the fact he was dead.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just used the reverse version of The Story of
Genes. He wanted to expel the Ultimate Egg and Mirror Moon from his
body. By doing so, he triggered the Mirror Moon’s explosion. It
made Mirror Moon explode with the spirit power. It filled up Han
Sen’s body. He believed he was going to die. His body was almost
collapsing. Even when he used Super God Spirit mode, he was still
unable to hold the scary spirit explosion at bay.</p>
<p>Upon his body get destroyed in a big explosion, the Ultimate
Egg’s power displayed something rather miraculous.</p>
<p>At first, the Ultimate Egg just kept reversing Han Sen’s body
power. Finally, the Ultimate Egg lured out Mirror Moon’s spirit
power to reverse it too.</p>
<p>At that moment, the exploding scary spirit power turned into
another weird power.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon’s power had a soul element that burned everything.
When that power was flipped, it created a reverse Mirror Moon
power. It became the soul’s food.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s spirit body, which was going to collapse, had an
explosive spirit power to fill him up. Because of that, he
recovered his power. Still, the scary spirit powers kept changing
him.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon had too many spirit powers. It was hard to imagine
the powers with one explosion. Han Sen could not hold against the
spirit power. After he had too much spirit power, his body was
unable to control a thing. He had changed.</p>
<p>Because the spirit power exploded so fast, and the whole
changing progress was done in a second, Han Sen could not figure
out what had happened inside his body.</p>
<p>When that was all over, Han Sen noticed his body had completely
recovered. He was also still in his spirit body mode.</p>
<p>The spirit body mode was not like the Super God Spirit mode or
the reverse Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>His body did not have the white spirit light. There was no God
Spirit light at all. Han Sen felt like his body was just like he
had not entered the spirit mode. Everything was very natural.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Han Sen had not noticed that he was in a spirt
body mode. When Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi were not able to see
him, they were also unable to feel his presence. It made Han Sen
realize there was some kind of problem.</p>
<p>“No. I shouldn’t be dead. I have seen dead people’s spirits.
They have transparent soul bodies with no will. They can’t behave
like a living thing. They cannot have their own will.” Han Sen
looked into the sky and was given a fright.</p>
<p>In the past, he only used Mirror Moon’s power to see spirits
flying to the revealed presence of the geno hall.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen could see the spirits of the universe flying. He
could see the floating emptiness had a geno hall that looked like a
god building</p>
<p>Han Sen started to look weird. There were only two reasons why
he might be seeing this. One was that when Mirror Moon exploded,
the power had filled up his body with its residue to gift him the
powers of Mirror Moon.</p>
<p>The second possibility was that he really was dead, which was
why he was now able to see everything</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to grab the items that belonged to him, but the
results were the same as before. He was unable to touch a thing. In
spirit body mode, he was unable to use geno arts. It was not like
before. He could not back out of his spirit body mode.</p>
<p>“Am I really dead?” Han Sen was frozen as he looked at his
hands. He could not accept the fact he was already a dead man.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi packed up all the items and were
ready to leave. Han Sen hastily followed them. The Zhao family
sisters were still unable to see or hear Han Sen even though he was
able to see them and hear them.</p>
<p>“If they are going to the Qin Kingdom, I will follow them. Even
if they cannot see me, Bao’er will be able to see me.” Han Sen
comforted himself.</p>
<p>Although he was unable to use a geno art and his spirit body’s
power could not alter items around him, as a spirit body, he was
able to move quite fast.</p>
<p>Han Sen was worried about not being able to catch up with Zhao
Ning’er. He soon realized his worrying had been pointless. Within a
second, Han Sen was next to Zhao Ning’er. He was faster now than he
was in his ordinary speed.</p>
<p>After trying this a few times, Han Sen noticed that if his heart
jumped, his spirit body could reach anywhere.</p>
<p>“I see…” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He suddenly appeared inside
Jade Wall City’s Feng family castle. He was much faster getting
there than he would have been by using Galaxy Teleportation.</p>
<p>“Now, this is the real style of travel to reach places.” Han Sen
was surprised.</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen started feeling bad again. It was pointless
being able to go that fast. He was still just a spirit that could
not touch anything. So, what if he was invincible to the world?</p>
