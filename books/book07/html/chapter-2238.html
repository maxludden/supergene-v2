<p>When Han Sen arrived at Ice Blue Knight King’s office, the
Knight King and Mister White were already there. They both looked
at Han Sen with strange intensity as he entered.</p>
<p>“Ahem… Mister Knight King. Is there something you require of
me?” Han Sen asked with a cough.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King squinted while he looked at Han Sen. “Kid,
you are good. You are just like me in the days of my youth.”</p>
<p>“Mister Knight King, what is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen
looked at Ice Blue Knight with a modicum of confusion.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King handed Han Sen a form with a blank space
for his signature. “Queen Bai Wei would like to invite you to go to
the Extreme King homeworlds with her. The request has been
approved. If you sign this, you can leave with Queen Bai Wei.”</p>
<p>After giving Han Sen a quick rundown on the relevant details of
the trip, Ice Blue Knight King smiled and said, “You are good. It
only took you a few days to attract the desire of the arrogant
little Queen Bai Wei. She is a uniquely talented girl. Many nobles
of the Extreme King wish to marry her, but she has rejected the
advances of every one of them. I sure didn’t see this coming.”</p>
<p>“You misunderstand. I think Queen Bai Wei only admires my
power.” Han Sen didn’t really agree with Ice Blue Knight King’s
description of her talents.</p>
<p>But still, Bai Wei was strong. Her body wasn’t any weaker than
Han Sen’s, and she was a top Marquise by all accounts and
measurements. It was an exaggeration to say she was “uniquely
talented,” though. Lone Bamboo’s fitness was just as strong as Bai
Wei’s, and it’d be fair to say he was more skilled.</p>
<p>It seemed that Mister White could see right through Han Sen,
though. The man smiled and said, “You might not have heard this,
but there is something special about the Extreme King. Being
accepted amongst the three highest races has its perks. Right now,
Queen Bai Wei is top class. She might not be the strongest in the
universe, but if she becomes King class and activates her King
body, killing a half-deified enemy won’t be a difficult task for
someone like her. She might even be able to hold her own against a
fully deified opponent.”</p>
<p>“King body?” Han Sen looked at Mister White with shock.</p>
<p>“That is no secret. Although the Extreme King may not be born
deified like those of the Ancient God, we have King bodies. As long
as we achieve King class, we can activate King bodies. That power
makes us stronger than those of the same level. That being said, it
does cost a lot of energy, and it cannot be used infinitely. Still,
it is quite powerful. Plus, once we become deified, the King body
can give us a boost. That makes a deified Extreme King stronger
than the average deified.”</p>
<p>Mister White paused briefly, then resumed by saying, “It has
been discovered that Queen Bai Wei possesses a very brilliant King
body. She is one of the most gifted you can find amongst the
Extreme King. If she becomes King class, she can become
deified.”</p>
<p>“It’s that great?” Han Sen was surprised. Mister White seemed
quite willing to discuss the subject in depth.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King looked at Han Sen and said, “Mister White
has spoken a great deal to you, so you should understand our
situation.”</p>
<p>“I understand. I will stay away from her.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>With talent like Bai Wei’s, she would be very important to the
future of the Extreme King, and her marriage would be a very
complicated political matter.</p>
<p>The two men before Han Sen were giving him a warning. They
didn’t want him chasing after Bai Wei.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to think too much. We might be going overboard.
Just be yourself and don’t disobey her. Being Queen Bai Wei’s loyal
guard is an important posting. You will benefit greatly from that
position.” Ice Blue Knight King smiled.</p>
<p>“I don’t like leaving so soon. Please let me stay in the Ice
Blue System for a while.” Han Sen wasn’t interested in selling
himself off to the Extreme King.</p>
<p>Han Sen had little interest in being a loyal guard, and he
hadn’t yet discovered how to use the plate. He hadn’t tracked down
what Night River King had discovered out at the border of the Ice
Blue System, either. He didn’t want to leave with so many loose
ends.</p>
<p>“That won’t be possible. This transfer order is coming straight
from King Bai. You and your team have to go to the Extreme King
homeworld with Queen Bai Wei,” Ice Blue Knight King said.</p>
<p>“She said she was here as punishment, and she is going back so
soon?” Han Sen had a wry smile.</p>
<p>“After what happened with Night River King, King Bai doesn’t
believe she is safe here. So, she is being forced to return,”
Mister White said.</p>
<p>“Return to your rooms and ready yourself. In two days, I will be
escorting you to the Extreme King to be sure that nothing else
happens to you.” Ice Blue Knight King then waved his hand in
dismissal.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to leave Ice Blue Knight King’s office. As he
walked, he thought to himself, “Did King Bai find out that I took
the Undying Bird Nest? Is that why he’s actually summoning me?”</p>
<p>It had been two weeks, and the little red bird had remained
quietly in the nest the entire time. Han Sen had put other bird
eggs inside, and within two hours, they hatched. That meant the
nest still had its powers. He just didn’t know why the little red
bird was taking so long to hatch.</p>
<p>“I hope the little red bird hatches before I journey to the
Extreme King. If the Undying Bird Nest is taken by King Bai, I’ll
have no chance.”</p>
<p>Back in his rooms, Han Sen explained his situation to Han Yan
and his companions. They prepared to go to the Extreme King in a
few short days.</p>
<p>Edward heard the news, and it made him frown.</p>
<p>“If Han Sen goes to the homeworld, we’ll lose our chance to get
our hands on the item.” As the Ice Blue Knight spoke, his
expression turned pensive.</p>
<p>“We can’t allow him to go to the Extreme King. He has to stay
here,” Edward said.</p>
<p>“How do we make him stay? After the incident with Night River
King, Ice Blue Knight King himself is going to escort Han Sen to
the Extreme King. We wouldn’t stand a chance. You want to take on
people loyal to Ice Blue Knight King? We aren’t strong enough.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not.” Edward suddenly had a thought. “The only way is to
cooperate with Ice Blue Knight King.”</p>
<p>“What?” The Ice Blue Knight jumped out of his chair, staring at
Edward with wide eyes. “You’re going to tell Ice Blue Knight King
that Han Sen took the relic?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Edward nodded.</p>
<p>“No, no way!” the Ice Blue Knight shouted.</p>
<p>“It is the only way. That is how we keep Han Sen and the item,”
Edward stated coldly.</p>
<p>“But…” Before the Ice Blue Knight finished, Edward
interrupted.</p>
<p>“There is no ‘but.’ This is the only way.” Edward squinted in
thought. “Do not forget that Ice Blue Knight King doesn’t know
about the relic.”</p>
<p>The Ice Blue Knight was shocked. He sat down and forcibly calmed
himself, then said, “You mean we are going to tell Ice Blue Knight
King that Han Sen has a relic, but we won’t tell him what it
is?”</p>
