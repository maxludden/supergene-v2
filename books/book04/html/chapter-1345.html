      The chef approached Han Sen with her cleaver in-hand. Just as Han Sen was
      about to retaliate with Super Spank, he heard a chilly voice boom from the
      skies.
    </p>
    <p>“Did you kill the primitive creatures?”</p>
    <p>
      The chef stopped and looked up into the sky. Han Sen lowered his hand and
      also looked up at the phantom figure that was now addressing them. When
      his vision cleared, he could see a male spirit hovering high-up in the
      air. His eyes were fixed on the chef, and his face bore an expression of
      distaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought to himself, “Poor you, ‘bub.’ You pledged allegiance to
      the chef, and now she’s going to get her *ss handed to her! You chose the
      wrong side, pal.”
    </p>
    <p>“Who are you?” the chef asked the spirit.</p>
    <p>
      “You killed my creatures, you horrid hag! And you roam these lands without
      knowing who I am? I am the leader of Jade Hill! These lands you tread
      belong to me.” The spirit paused briefly. He continued to address the
      chef, his words simmering with restrained anger. “You killed my creatures,
      and that means there’s a price to pay. You will cough up!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit summoned a book in his hands. It was a book that was adorned
      with a number of strange scrawlings, symbols, and patterns.
    </p>
    <p>He opened the copper-like cover and began to draw with his fingertip.</p>
    <p>
      Due to Han Sen being trapped beneath the bowl, he was unable to see
      exactly what the spirit was drawing. Beneath the glass encasing, he could
      not make use of his Dongxuan Aura.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second later, though, he was done. And with a blinding font of light, a
      beast came out of the book. It was a three-meter-long creature that had
      emerged from the page of that book. It cried out and then flew down
      towards the chef.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit looked far stronger than the three-horned beast king the chef
      had slain earlier, so there was every chance she had met her match here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef frowned and threw up her left fist, and from out of nowhere, a
      fork appeared in her hand. Each prong pierced through the meaty hide,
      flesh, and body of the beast that was bearing down on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the creature stuck firmly in place upon her frightening utensil, the
      chef began to swing her cleaver at the beast with her one free arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beast, however, despite being lodged firmly upon her fork, did not
      seem to feel any pain. It still tried to attack the chef, flailing
      helplessly, but it could not reach her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef continued to swing and swing, slicing up the spirit’s
      newly-spawned creature like a giant sushi roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are good, but you are also dead.” The self-proclaimed boss of Jade
      Hill spoke calmly, but his tone was heavy with serious gravitas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boss of Jade Hill returned to his book and began conjuring something
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef, disposing of the mutilated creature on her fork, raised her
      kitchen utensils once more. She was ready to fight and destroy anything
      that dared come close. When the next creature was summoned, she destroyed
      it. And this was how it went for some time. Creature after creature was
      thrown at her, and before long, she could not keep up with the pace at
      which these creatures were summoned.
    </p>
    <p>The sheep, having seen this, began running away like a hare on fire.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked at the spectacle, and he knew he was in for a lot more
      surprises in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. This spirit’s geno core was
      obviously a book, and he wondered what others might possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also made him more eager to find out which geno core he would receive
      once he got one, and it spurred him with an even greater desire to max out
      his ordinary geno points as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The chef isn’t looking too good. He’s drawing way faster than she can
      exterminate. It’s a little cheap of this boss-leader guy, if I’m to be
      honest,” Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, if a spirit was unable to take down a
      shelter, they’d be unable to respawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the chef did not already have a shelter to call her own, she was in
      danger of being vanquished completely. She was in danger of death—an
      absolute one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing she could not keep up with the pace of monster spawns, she tried a
      different tactic. She leaped up into the skies to get
      up-close-and-personal with the boss of Jade Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boss conjured a bird and stood upon it as the chef approached. And
      then the bird began to retreat, further and further away as the boss of
      Jade Hill stuck to his cheap tricks of summoning creatures to attack the
      chef who was now doing her best to get him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef had battled her way through legions of creatures, and there were
      surely far more to come. She was in a bad spot, and the chances of her
      actually getting close enough to defeat the boss were looking slim.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t think she’s going to make it. It’s a shame, but I suppose now is
      the best opportunity I have to get away.” Han Sen, watching the corpses of
      slain creatures rain from the sky, tried punching his way through the
      crystal bowl to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, despite using Jadeskin to punch with all his might, there
      was not even a single crack rendered upon his cage’s surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why is this bowl so hard? Is it a geno core, perhaps?” Han Sen ventured a
      guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was going to try breaking through the bowl with Super Spank next,
      but then, the bowl suddenly flew back up towards the chef. Now that Han
      Sen was free, he wasn’t going to question the blessing. He took off
      running as fast as he could. Killing a spirit would not provide him with a
      benefit, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran in the opposite direction that the sheep had fled, knowing it was
      best for him to avoid the traitorous fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he left, he could hear cries, roars, and the general sounds of a
      fierce battle high in the sky behind him. That’s not to say he cared much
      for the trouble he was leaving behind. He was just happy to get away.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen needed a geno core more than anything, right now.</p>
    <p>
      Everyone appeared to use a geno core to fight, so that put him at a grave
      disadvantage. Han Sen didn’t think it was very fair. Because he had come
      to learn of this region well, Han Sen took off in the direction of a large
      mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A primitive Toxic-Tooth used to live there, but it had been killed by the
      chef shortly after Han Sen and the sheep joined its employ. At least now
      the area was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley he traversed was home to creatures named Jade Snails. They were
      slow and weak, but their geno cores and beast souls were good. Wanting to
      level up and increase his strength, Han Sen fancied taking a bunch of them
      down.
