  As his solid voice echoed, Kong Fei’s body started to unleash power.

The water wave did not come from his body, but it was as if the whole world was answering his summons.

The earth was quiet, and the stars in the sky were shining. Even though it was daytime, the stars were everywhere. It was as if he was breathing in the galaxy, brimming with power.

Kong Fei’s back was against the graves. He looked to the sky. Between the stars, there was a temple. It was floating, up in the atmosphere.

Amidst the endless numbers of planets and systems, they all saw this temple in the sky. They were all shocked.

“A geno hall has appeared? Who has what it takes to summon it? Who is the challenger?” wondered everyone who saw it. Even the higher races of the galaxy were shocked, seeing this.

It had been a thousand years since a geno hall last appeared, and there it was, showing up again. It felt like a great danger was descending once more. This was especially true for the races that had not been able to light a fire.

“No way!” All the Feather kings were in shock, and they stood up in response. They looked at Kong Fei, and the ancient temple that now appeared. They had a bad feeling.

Kong Fei started flying up towards the ancient temple.

As the ancient temple appeared, a voice came along with it Many strange shadows surrounded the temple, but whenever Han Sen looked at the shadows more closely, they vanished.

Kong Fei was in front of the door to the place. He pointed his finger at it, and a drop of blood flew forward to it.

Every creature was attracted to the sight of his blood. And their eyes watched as it floated forward to touch the gate. Boom!

The mysterious, ancient temple was opened by that blood. That meant the gates approved of the genes possessed by the one who wished to enter. Now, he could go forward and attempt to claim a spot.

But the blood still hovered right in front of the door. It was unable to enter fully, due to there being no space left inside.

All the fires in the temple quivered crazily. They released a power that was a grand threat. A warning.

Everyone turned to look at the naked man, hovering in the air. They were waiting for something.

Kong Fei’s face looked as if he was mocking something. He slowly said, “Feather!”

Boom!

The ancient temple’s lanterns became dimmer, but only one started to blaze brighter. The scary flames burst out like a volcano, all from a single lantern. It was hanging in the geno hall. The lantern also displayed gold lettering, which read “Feather.”

Those of all the other races felt greatly relieved. They even found it rather funny. Only the Feather Kings and their Nobles felt their faces turn green. They moved so fast that space itself crackled as they sought to reach the naked man.

“Interesting. A Feather wants to replace a Feather. Interesting.” Amidst the Pirates, a man looked to the sky. He looked evil.

In a dark hall, a few beasts looked at the man near the geno hall with the Feather lantern. An attractive lady in the middle of them said, “I cannot believe there are still interesting people like that around.”

At the zenith of Unsolid Mountain, a beast that was in the sky looked towards the lantern, quietly saying, “One of these days, the Roar will be in the geno hall. We will be at its highest spot.”

Han Sen, standing in front of Mosi Mountain, could feel the brilliance of that power. He had a lot of thoughts running through his mind.

The Feather Kings soon entered the space, and the Nobles were like a swarm, surrounding the naked man. They were so loud, they could have roused the entire universe out of a slumber.

Kong Fei had no more white feathers, as the original three thousand feathers had been returned to their owners. The two feathers that belonged to Kong Fei himself, were in Han Sen and Stay Up Late’s hands.

The Feathers’ light had brightened up. All the Feathers were heading for the air, because of the light. If the heavens ever fell, all the angels would fall to the earth and frighten all the other races.

No one had extinguished a light in a thousand years, but a billion years ago, fights like this were common events. This was an average fight between two different races. The competitors would use all they could muster to defeat their opponent, to take their place and light up a fire in the geno hall. This was ordinary.

But Kong Fei was fighting a race all alone. What was most unbelievable about this, though, was that he was a Feather without wings.

Seven Kings, the leader included, had come for him. The swordlights cracked the river of time, breaking it A scary presence was swallowing the galaxy.

All this power came from the sky, and Kong Fei did not take a look. He only stared at the lantern, with the word Feather on it.

Seven Feather Kings, with the other Feathers, landed on Kong Fei. But Kong Fei kept dodging, as a weird light beamed through his muscles, skin, and hair.

All that power came for him, but it didn’t even brush his hair. It was all just like wind, rustling around him.

Blergh!

But the Feather King and the other Nobles suddenly started to cough up blood. Many of the Feathers were falling, and it was difficult to tell how many of the Feathers had been killed. Their faces all looked pale, with plumes of feathers descending.

“God body! He became a god!” Holy Column King screamed as he coughed up blood.

He wasn’t just a god for the Feathers; this was for every race. Everyone was shocked, seeing this. Many people screamed just like Holy Column King did. They yelled, “God body!”

“Kong Fei, are you really not going to stop this?” King-Sky King wiped away his blood, looking at the man as he spoke.

“Death is the only thing that will stop me. Or your death, perhaps,” Kong Fei said coldly. He then raised his right hand and swung it at the lantern.

King-Sky King angrily shouted, “Protect our lantern!”

Millions of Feathers, and King-Sky King himself, roared in unison. The entire Feather race was racing for the fire.

The lantern was shining brightly, with power gathering up. It became a gold angel statue, clutching a greatsword. And it was swinging towards Kong Fei’s hand.
