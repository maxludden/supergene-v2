  “That means Bai Wan Jie is confident that he’ll be able to obtain a Sea Sky Eye?” Han Sen frowned.

Li Keer smiled. “That is why I said, if you think this is too troublesome, you don’t have to help me locate and destroy the creature. I want the Sea Sky Eye, but not as much as the Extreme King do.”

“I don’t mind trying to get it. The Extreme King might not be strong enough to take it down anyway,” Han Sen said flippantly. But inside, he was thinking about how he was going to get his hands on the Sea Sky Eye.

When Dia Robber finally returned, the royal knights still hadn’t found the Sea Sky Eye.

Clearly, the Destroyed had spotted the royal knights scouring the system for the Sea Sky Eye. When he saw them, he asked in surprise, “Why are the Extreme King here?

Dragon One explained the situation to him, and in response, Dia Robber said, “If the Extreme King believe they are going to get it, I doubt there will be much for us to do in this system. I have spoken to my people. Dollar, they have agreed to allow you to learn Big Destroyed as a reward for helping us slay a deified xenogeneic. I can’t give you part of the geno art as a downpayment, though. We are hoping that you will help us defeat the deified xenogeneic before receiving the reward, and in the event that you don’t trust us, we can give the Big Destroyed to a trusted third-party to hold onto. The third-party will pay you after the deified xenogeneic has been slain. What do you think of that, Dollar?”

“Sure. Let the Dragons hold onto the geno art, then,” Han Sen said.

“I thought of that as well. I would like to ask you to help us, Dragon One.” Dia Robber looked at Dragon One as he spoke.

“Sure.” The Dragon promptly agreed.

“I have brought Big Destroyed here with me. Should we sign the agreement now?” Dia Robber asked, presenting a little box.

“There is no rush. Let me finish-off this Sea Sky Eye, and then I will sign.” Han Sen waved his hand.

The people around him were shocked. No one had expected that Han Sen still intended to defeat the Sea Sky Eye after learning of the Extreme King’s interference.

“Brother Dollar, the Extreme King are very strong. Plus, they are very confident in their task here. They must have made special preparations, and they will have tricks up their sleeves. There is no need to fight with them over this,” Dragon One said, attempting to persuade Han Sen to drop the matter.

“I’m just here to try my luck. I have nothing against Bai Wan Jie.” Han Sen paused, and then went on to say, “In regards to signing the contract, let us wait until this has been resolved first. You guys probably shouldn’t stick around. Why don’t you leave for now? When I’m done here, I will contact you both.”

Dragon One and Dia Robber looked at each other with apprehension, and then they took their people and left.

The Dragons were frequent allies of the Extreme King. Although the Destroyed didn’t often see eye to eye with the Extreme King, they also didn’t want to risk a falling out with such a powerful race. So, they thought it was a good idea to leave now, as well.

After Dragon One and Dia Robber left, Han Sen spoke to Li Keer and said, “You should leave, too. If I get the Sea Sky Eye, I will deliver it to you.”

Li Keer smiled and said, “I’m not as strong as you, but I do have Galaxy Teleportation. I’m perfectly capable of getting myself out of trouble, if need be. You just mind your own business without fretting over my wellbeing.”

Han Sen had no response for that. He merely proceeded to wander around the system, slaying xenogeneics as he went. He seemed to be meandering aimlessly, but he carefully stayed within the borders of the system.

If the intruder had been anyone else, Bai Wan Jie would have sent his people to chase them away. The crown prince wouldn’t allow anyone to hover around him like a vulture. But Han Sen’s performance against the Gold Armor General had been terrifying. It made others fearful of him.

Although the Extreme King’s royal knights had an impressive reputation, they weren’t confident that they could defeat Han Sen in the core area. Instead of attempting to oust him, they sent scouts to watch him and attempt to contain him, if need be.

Han Sen didn’t feel guilty at all about his plan to steal from the Extreme King.

He had expected to wait a long time before the Sea Sky Eye was found, but it was only two days later when he felt a scary shockwave rolling out from a distant spot in the system. Bai Wan Jie must have discovered the Sea Sky Eye, and he was in the process of killing it.

Han Sen wanted to travel there, but two royal knights barred his way.

“Where are you going?” a royal guard said while looking at Han Sen.

“Why do I have to tell you where I’m going?” Han Sen asked icily.

The royal knight wasn’t angered, but his face remained impassive as he said, “You don’t have to tell me where you’re going, but if you are headed for the battlefield, then you will become an enemy of the Extreme King. I hope you think this through.”

Before Han Sen could speak, the other royal knight said, “Our crown prince said that if you are willing to stay here and not interfere in the fight, he will owe you a big favor. We would appreciate it greatly.”

“In that case, I will not go. Please tell the crown prince not to break his promise,” Han Sen said. Then he turned around to leave.

Both of them were shocked. When they were sent there, the two knights had been ordered to stop Dollar no matter what. They were prepared for a fight to the death, but Dollar was actually being nice. He departed after a brief exchange of words.

But they still felt uneasy. They followed Han Sen, not wanting to let him escape their watch.

“Giving up was a good idea. After all, they are the Extreme King.” Li Keer let out an exaggerated sigh.

Han Sen laughed and said, “Lady Keer, do you like chess?”

“Chess?” Li Keer was shocked.

“Yes, chess.” Han Sen nodded. “Do you play?”

“I know how to play chess, but why are you asking?” Li Keer didn’t know what Han Sen wanted.

“Please play a game of chess with me.” Han Sen pointed to a planet that was far away. “How about there?”

Li Keer knew Han Sen was up to something, but instead of asking what he was planning, she just nodded.

The two of them arrived on the planet. They found a quiet place and set up the chess game. When the two royal knights who were stalking him saw Dollar playing chess with a female Sky, they were surprised.

“What is he doing?” A royal knight mumbled in confusion.

The other royal knight laughed and said, “So, what? No matter how strong he is, he is just a King. Plus, he is a King from a nameless race. He wouldn’t dare make enemies of the Extreme King. He made the right decision.”

“I hope so. That way, we won’t have to die.” The royal knights were finally beginning to relax. They had seen Han Sen fight the Gold Armor General, and so they didn’t want to fight him.

Li Keer, who was playing chess with Han Sen, thought that they had dramatically misjudged Han Sen’s intentions. That was because she wasn’t actually playing chess with Han Sen; she was playing with a doppelganger. The real Han Sen had left a long time ago. Even Li Keer hadn’t felt it when he teleported away.

“This guy really is brave. He dares to steal from the Extreme King. Not only that, but he’s taking something that they want really badly.” Although Li Keer was playing chess, she wasn’t paying much attention to the game. Her eyes were flashing, and a starscape gleamed across them. It was the image of Bai Wan Jie fighting the Sea Sky Eye.
