  Night Ring 12th Street, capital city of Planet Night Ghost.

Planet Night Ghost was a planet belonging to Sky Palace. The planet was mostly populated by the Night Ghosts, however. They weren’t a higher race, but they sure enjoyed fighting. They were only active at night, and if it weren’t for being nocturnal, they’d have likely left Planet Night Ghost and become a higher race.

Their race could not stand the light, and because of this, they were practically stuck on Planet Night Ghost. Under the protection of Sky Palace, however, they were well off.

Over the past few months, strange things had begun to happen on Planet Night Ghost. Many Night Ghosts had been killed, but the perpetrator of the murders was still at large.

The entire planet had been scoured to find the murderer, but it was all to no avail.

In a certain castle in Night Ring 12th Street, the leader of the Night Ghosts, Sleepless Duke, was having a meeting with two young men. One of the men looked cold, whereas the other was smiling. He was holding a sweet-looking, five- year-old girl.

Those two young men were Lone Bamboo and Han Sen. They were here to investigate the strange deaths. It was a part of their training.

Han Sen hadn’t wanted to come, but he was ordered there by the elders. He couldn’t refuse the command, and so he had to go there with Lone Bamboo.

Han Sen was looking at the female Night Ghost leader, Sleepless Duke. She had a sexy body, highlighted with tight leather clothing. It revealed her curves as if she was wearing nothing at all.

It wasn’t long until Han Sen realized the truth; she really wasn’t wearing anything. The tight-leather clothing wasn’t clothes—it was her skin!

She had short black hair and eyes. She had black wings like those of a bat, and she had a tail that was like a black whip.

It made her look very sexy.

She was two meters tall, a little taller than Han Sen. She looked very strong.

“Mister Lone Bamboo, please find the murderer for us. If this continues, all the Night Ghosts will be slain,” Sleepless Duke growled, anger coloring her voice.

Sky Palace was very secretive, and not even the Night Ghosts knew who Han Sen and Bao’er were. They had only heard his name before, but his accomplishments were unknown to them.

The Night Ghosts themselves were quite secretive, as well.

“Are there bodies?” Lone Bamboo asked impassively.

Sleepless Duke shook her head. “When the victims die, they swiftly degrade into black water. It leaves little in the way of clues to examine.”

“Give me a Night Ghost that has died recently,” Lone Bamboo said.

“It has been prepared already. The information is here for you.” Sleepless Duke pointed to a document on the table while she spoke.

“Brother Lone Bamboo, you can handle this. I will go stretch my legs with Bao’er.” Han Sen waved at Lone Bamboo, and then he went outside for a walk.

“Sir! Why don’t I send a guard to accompany you?” Sleepless Duke did not know Han Sen, but she still stood up and made him the offer.

“It’s okay. I’ll be alright walking around Night Ring 12th Street.” Han Sen walked straight out of the Duke manor with Bao’er without waiting for a reply.

Planet Night Ghost had no sun, so the entire planet was very cold as a result. But there was no water, either, so there was no ice on the planet’s surface. The only things Han Sen could see were castles built from dull, grey rock.

A Night Ghosts were a very hardy race. They did not need food or water, and they could gain energy from the dark. It worked to charge them.

They were not afraid of high temperatures or low temperatures, and neither did they require oxygen. The only thing they were afraid of was the light. It blurred their vision, and if it was intense enough, it would permanently blind them. Aside from that, it wasn’t too bad, though.

All the Night Ghosts were xenogeneics, and they were bom as Barons. Their blood was very good, and many high races weren’t as powerful as they were.

They were limited by their obvious Achilles heel and their lack of resources. Their strongest member was just a Duke, too. There wasn’t a single King amongst them.

The whole planet was dark. Only the starlight flowed across the castles, casting faint shadows across the ground. As he walked, Han Sen got the sense that there were monsters lurking in the dark.

Night Ghosts were good at killing in the dark, but over the past few months, twenty of them had been murdered. Most of the victims were Marquises.

The Night Ghosts had employed many advanced technologies to search for the potential killer, but they had been unable to find a trace.

Two days ago, when another Marquise died, he was attending Sleepless Duke’s own dinner party. Most of the Night Ghost elites were there that day, but that Marquise had been silently slain on the balcony. No one there, including Sleepless Duke, had a clue how he had been killed. The Night Ghosts discovered his body on the balcony, but not before he was already dissolving into black water. His identity was confirmed by the clothing he had been wearing.

Han Sen was in Night Ring 12th Street. His Dongxuan Aura was turned on, and so everything was in his mind’s eye. He could see many Night Ghosts staring at him from the dark corners.

They looked cold, and they looked at him with disdain. That did not mean they were hostile, however. That was just how they were. They did not like outsiders, and they particularly didn’t like talking to them. Other races had occupied this planet thousands of years ago, but the Night Ghosts had killed them off.

The only ones they obeyed were the Sky, who had once defeated them.

Han Sen looked as if he belonged to the Sky, but his sense did not. The Night Ghosts could smell that Han Sen was not an actual Sky. On a dark street, an extremely curvy Night Ghost woman blocked Han Sen’s path.

“Sky Palace sent you here?”

“Yeah.” Han Sen nodded.

“Why are you not a Sky yourself? Matters like these are usually resolved by true Sky.” The female Night Ghost frowned.

Han Sen shrugged. “A real student of Sky Palace is in the Duke’s manor right now. He is a pure Sky. I’m just his assistant.”

“I see.” The female Night Ghost felt relieved. Learning that a Sky had come seemed to reassure her that their problems would soon be resolved.

“What’s your name?” Han Sen asked her.

“Li Duo,” the female Night Ghost said.

“I need to investigate on behalf of the Sky brother. Can you show me around?” Han Sen smiled.

“Where would you like to go?” Li Duo asked. Perhaps it was because Han Sen had mentioned his ties to the Sky, but she didn’t look as if she was going to refuse to guide him.

“Take me to where the Night Ghosts were murdered,” Han Sen said.
