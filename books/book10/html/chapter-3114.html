<p>The stone orb was like a sky full of stars. Thousand Mile Reach
used a mysterious way to reach Han Sen. Through the stars and chess
pieces, he blocked every possible way for Han Sen to evade.</p>
<p>Han Sen squinted his eyes. He wanted to get up and go past the
star tracks and appear before Thousand Mile Reach.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Thousand Mile Reach was, he was not as
strong as Han Sen. If he was able to get in front of him, Han Sen
could beat him up.</p>
<p>In this world, when faced with Han Sen, humans were like
sorcerers while he was a fighter. No matter how Han Sen’s body was
suppressed by the world, his strength remained. Even if it was a
small skirmish, it would not have been difficult for him to beat
Thousand Mile Reach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Han Sen had only just gathered up power. He moved
but immediately froze. He looked at the stone orb that was flying
down. He seemed to realize something.</p>
<p>Because he was restrained by the rules of the world, his powers
of sense were weak in the universe of kingdoms. Aside from ordinary
vision and hearing, his sense powers were not strong.</p>
<p>According to theory, when Han Sen used body power, he felt a
strong suppression from the rules of the world. It was like walking
up a waterfall.</p>
<p>This time, he gathered up power to move and did not feel such a
restriction.</p>
<p>“The chess world is not really a space world. It is just a
mental world.” Han Sen now understood it. This was a psychological
hallucination. It was a world that did not truly exist. His body
was still sitting near the chessboard playing chess with Thousand
Mile Reach. His real body wasn’t inside this world.</p>
<p>“This kind of mental world power is weird. As for competing
one’s mental powers with mine, even a God Spirit wouldn’t be able
to fight me.” Han Sen felt a huge relief.</p>
<p>If there was a power in that world that Han Sen could still use,
aside from his body, it was the mind he used to practice. He did
not bother using it.</p>
<p>With the power of attacks in the mental world, putting him
inside a mental world was like placing a sheep in the mouth of a
tiger. If Han Sen discovered that, it would not work to defeat
him.</p>
<p>The stone orb, which looked like starlight, fell. Han Sen stood
where he was without dodging. He just calmly watched it.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach saw Han Sen’s lips display a smile. For some
reason, his heart jumped. There was some unsettling feel growing in
his heart.</p>
<p>“No way. He has been pulled into my chess world. I am the god
here. I can control everything.” Thousand Mile Reach was deep in
thought.</p>
<p>Seeing the stone orb was going to land on him, Han Sen coldly
said. “The sky and the earth are like chess. I am a chess piece,
but so what? If there is no chess piece, then there can be no chess
match. Without me, there is no sky and earth. I am the sky and the
earth. The sky and the earth are me.”</p>
<p>His words sounded very crazy. Thousand Mile Reach coldly grunted
and wished to say something. He suddenly saw the stone orb
uncontrollably stop. It was like stars were spinning around Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach was shocked. He quickly used gene race
powers for his chess world. He wanted to take back control of the
chess world’s power. He was frightened to learn that under the
chess god’s buff, the chess world’s mental power was unable to move
Han Sen’s will.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? Is his willpower stronger than a Disaster
class God Spirit?” Thousand Mile Reach looked at Han Sen with
shock. He could not believe this was happening. “In the sky and on
the ground, I am the best. Whoever follows me will be treated
nicely. Whoever stands in my way will die.” Han Sen’s voice was
like that of a god. The whole chess world kept changing. Many stone
orbs turned into scary knife lights that tore up space. It was like
it was destroying the sky and the ground. It was like a tide going
into Thousand Mile Reach.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen thought, their bodies were perched at the
chessboard. They were just sitting there.</p>
<p>“Old Yang, what is going on? They moved one chess piece.
Suddenly, Han Sen and the teacher stopped moving.” Qin Bai looked
at the two of them, unaware of what was actually going on. “Crown
Prince, I do not know either.” Mister Yang smiled.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu was nearby. She looked at Qin Bai’s back. She
struggled with indecision. “Thousand Mile Reach has a chess soul
God Spirit Blood-Pulse. He is a high-class, god-blood noble. He has
the ultimate mode god-class gene race called chess world teacher.
His power is not something Han Sen is capable of dealing with. Han
Sen has just made a big mistake. If his psychology breaks and Crown
Prince Qin Bai is taken away, he is going to die. This is my final
chance to assassinate Qin Bai.”</p>
<p>Although she thought this way, the entire Feng castle was
surrounded by the king’s guards. There were also many elites there.
If she assassinated Qin Bai, she had nowhere to run.</p>
<p>If she missed out on this opportunity, she wouldn’t get
another.</p>
<p>“If he can break Qin Kingdom’s bloodline, then sacrificing my
life would be worth it for that endeavor.” Li Bing Yu made her
decision. She decided to kill Qin Bai. She felt shocked shortly
after and looked away.</p>
<p>She saw Jian Bu Gu was holding a tea set. He was walking toward
them from afar. He had a very innocent smile on his face.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu immediately stopped her murder attempt. She could not
do it because of Han Sen and Jian Bu Gu. Han Sen was controlled by
Thousand Mile Reach, but Jian Bu Gu was still there.</p>
<p>Although Jian Bu Gu made the promise not to use power, he used
to be the Qin Kingdom’s king teacher. He was King Jing Zhen’s
teacher. Li Bing Yu did not think he would just sit and watch the
only extension of the Qin Kingdom’s bloodline be murdered.</p>
<p>“Even if I do not fight now, I will not have another chance.”
While Li Bing Yu was still hesitating, the chessboard displayed
movement.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu looked over there. She saw Thousand Mile Reach
sitting there holding a chess piece. He suddenly coughed up a
mouthful of blood that dyed the chessboard red. He collapsed onto
the floor.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach laid on the floor with a pale face. His
white beard was colored red due to the blood. He opened his eyes in
shock and looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>The people watching were shocked. They wondered why Thousand
Mile Reach had become like that after only moving one chess
piece.</p>
<p>“Teacher, you never played checkers before. It is normal for you
not to know how to play it. You do not need to rush this.” Qin Bai
quickly went to hold Thousand Mile Reach. He comforted him, but he
was very happy. Inside, he thought, “Han Sen is very powerful. He
made the teacher end up like this. With Han Sen by my side, he will
never bully me again.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai picked up Thousand Mile Reach. He pointed at Han Sen and
wished to say something, but he suddenly saw another person next to
Han Sen. He was holding a tea set.</p>
<p>“Mister, the tea is done.” Jian Bu Gu put the tea set down in
front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>When Thousand Mile Reach saw Jian Bu Gu’s face, he was given a
shock. His eyes almost popped out of their sockets. It was like he
had seen a ghost. He shook off Qin Bai’s arm, went forward, and
bowed. “Teacher Jian, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Mister, you have mistaken me with someone else. I am only
Mister Han’s servant. I am not a teacher.” Jian Bu Gu placed a
teacup in front of Thousand Mile Reach. He told him to enjoy it and
left.</p>
