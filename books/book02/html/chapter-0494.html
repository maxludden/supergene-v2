    <p>
      Han Sen told Queen the story in details. The reason he was explaining was
      to let people know that he learned the footwork from Queen, in case anyone
      recognized the footwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      Huangfu Pingqing was surprised hearing the story. &#8220;So that&#8217;s
      what has happened. You are indeed a genius for making her treat you
      differently.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Unfortunately, I have only learned a little bit,&#8221; Han Sen
      licked his lips and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A little bit is quite nice already. Without the talent, one could
      not learn anything. Heavenly Go is definitely one of the top ten hyper
      geno arts, even better than Super Diamond Body. Not everyone has the
      chance to learn,&#8221; Huangfu Pingqing said admiringly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t your grandmother teach you?&#8221; Han Sen asked
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My grandmother said that my character and talents were not right
      for Heavenly Go. If I force it, I would probably get myself killed, which
      is why she did not teach me. In fact, I&#8217;m not the only one. No one
      in my family was taught Heavenly Go. Queen is her only student,&#8221;
      Huangfu Pingqing said helplessly. &#8220;So, I really envy you for having
      such talent.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s right. If one does not learn the kiting skills well,
      one would get oneself killed even faster,&#8221; Han Sen agreed with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The kiting skills that focused on calculation could easily be manipulated
      by the opponent if the user had poor abilities, which would cause the user
      to be killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, when Han Sen was against Queen, if he were to use the kiting
      skills, he would lose even faster, which was because Queen had better
      skills in calculation and designing. She was even able to turn Han
      Sen&#8217;s calculation against himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before he gained better abilities at calculation, Han Sen would rather
      stand still than use kiting skills in front of Queen if they were fighting
      for their lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe you could… Oh I have to go… Talk to you later…&#8221; It
      seemed that Huangfu Pingqing suddenly thought of something. She muttered
      some words out of order before she hung up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen shrugged helplessly, not knowing what had happened to Huangfu
      Pingqing. He had never seen her so disorganized before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ready to go to the military camp, Han Sen suddenly heard a crack in his
      sea of soul. The blood snail which had gone through transformation of
      several months eventually broke out of the cocoon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was suddenly overjoyed. Initially, he thought all the beast souls
      would finish the upgrade within one month. However, all beast souls had
      different paces. It took several months for the blood snail to finish its
      upgrade.
    </p>

    <p>
      The upgraded blood snail had different looks from before. It used to have
      a jade shell and red meat, looking like a snail shell floating on a red
      cloud. Currently, the entire blood snail had turned red, its shell looking
      like red crystal. The beast soul seemed to be on fire from afar.
    </p>

    <div class="tables">
      <table class="beast">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Berserk Super Blood Snail</td>
          <td>(Pet Armor)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- Type of beast soul of berserk super blood snail: pet armor. -->
    </div>

    <p>
      The introduction to the blood snail did not change much. There was only an
      extra word: berserk. Han Sen thought about it and went into a training
      field. He then summoned the golden rock worm king and equipped it with the
      super pet armor. The red armor turned the golden rock worm king into a red
      tank with a ferocious and fierce look.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used 30% of his force to hit the pet. Although the golden rock
      worm king backed off a little bit, the pet armor was still intact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen almost jumped with joy, hitting the golden rock worm king again
      with 60% of his force, and the pet was still fine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen increased his force gradually, but the golden rock worm king
      equipped with super pet armor was never injured, like a cockroach that
      could never be killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, Han Sen hit the golden rock worm king with all his strength,
      while he was only able to blow the pet away. With the protection of the
      super pet armor, the pet was not hurt severely.
    </p>

    <p>And the super pet armor only had a dent on it and was not broken.</p>

    <p>
      The result made Han Sen feel both surprised and disappointed. The blood
      snail did not turn into a beast soul of Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary like
      the holy angel. It seemed that not all the beast souls could evolve like
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black crystal only turned the blood snail into a berserk beast soul.
      However, a berserk super beast soul from First God&#8217;s Sanctuary was
      comparable to a sacred-blood beast soul from Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was great news to Han Sen. Han Sen suddenly had a thought, if I
      upgrade a beast soul from Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, I wonder if it
      could be turned into a berserk beast soul directly. If that is possible, I
      will be able to make a huge fortune.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the same beast soul, the value of a berserk one would be several times
      or several dozen times that of a normal beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>If he could turn a beast soul berserk, the profit was unimaginable.</p>

    <p>
      In addition, if he could turn the sacred-blood beast souls from Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary into berserk ones, it would be a great help for Han
      Sen to hunt super creatures in the future. Of course, what Han Sen was
      worried about the most was the time it took for the upgrade to take place.
      The holy angel only used a month, while it took several months for the
      blood snail to become berserk. Han Sen had not yet figured out the rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had no mood to go to the military camp anymore. He immediately
      went to the teleport device and entered Starwheel Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the plaza of the Starwheel Shelter, Han Sen bought an ordinary beast
      soul, which was the weakest of all, and made it swallow the black crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a snow kitty, the weakest creature on the icefield. The chance of
      getting a beast soul from this kind of creature is relatively high. Its
      beast soul was a cape, which worked well to protect people from cold.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the snow kitty swallowed the black crystal, light suddenly turned
      into a cocoon, wrapping the snow kitty up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen left the shelter, hunting while observing the progress of the snow
      kitty.
    </p>

    <p>
      After only one or two hours, the light cocoon had already cracked. The
      snow kitty that used to be white had turned into a silver color.
    </p>

    <div class="tables">
      <table class="beast">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Berserk Snow Kitty</td>
          <td>(Cape)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- Type of beast soul of berserk snow kitty: cape. -->
    </div>

    <p>
      Han Sen was thrilled. It was about the same as he thought. The black
      crystal could turn other beast souls into berserk beast souls. And it did
      not take much time for the ordinary creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, just upgrading ordinary beast souls would not be that helpful. He
      had to at least be able to upgrade mutant and sacred-blood beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth and gave the black crystal to the ghost-pawed
      ferret, trying to test how long it would take for the crystal to turn a
      sacred-blood beast soul into a berserk one. It turned out to be incredibly
      fast, which Han Sen did not expect.
    </p>

    <p>
      It only took less than three days for the ghost-pawed ferret beast soul to
      break out of the cocoon and turn into a berserk sacred-blood beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ghost-pawed claws became darker and sharper. It was as if a piece of
      iron was made into stainless steel. Han Sen knew it was much more advanced
      than it was before just by its look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Amazing, such good luck…&#8221; Han Sen was excited, because he
      knew how much it was worth.
