  Han Sen saw that the thing flying toward him was flat. He was not able to see what it was, but it was coming for the god spirit gene. Han Sen was not going to let it succeed. Just as he grabbed the evil purple lotus, another hand was also grabbing it.

Pang!

The flying thing was punched away by Han Sen with one hit. Han Sen did not feel a strong power coming from it, but Han Sen had not broken it.

Han Sen watched the thing as it was flying through the air. It was then that he saw what it was.

It appeared to be two big sticks that were stuck together. It was about a foot long and dark red. It was not eye-catching at all. He had no idea what it was.

Han Sen punched the flying thing that looked like two sticks. It was sent flying back, but it was still going after the evil purple lotus in Han Sen's hand.

Han Sen gathered up more power. He used all of his power to punch the thing away, but it still did not take any damage. After the punch again sent it flying backward, it simply headed straight for him.

When Han Sen used Sky Star Wolf glyph, his punch was as a strong as a larva class deified, yet it was not able to harm that thing. That surprised him.

Upon seeing it fly back to him, Han Sen summoned his Cold Light Sword. He slashed the circular stick.

Pang!

The two circular sticks were struck by Han Sen. It was thrown to the deck but not hurt by Han Sen. It bounced back off the ground and went into the sky to fly. It was headed for Han Sen's evil purple lotus again.

This time, Han Sen was very surprised. The Cold Light Sword beam was able to kill a butterfly xenogeneic. When it slashed the circular sticks, it did not even leave a white mark. Although that thing did not have strong power, the strength of the material could not be underestimated.

"What is that thing?" Londo and the others looked at the two circular sticks with shocked expressions.

As Bao Ying looked at the object, he said, "It looks like a drawing. I think it is a scroll with a drawing on it."

"It looks like that, but the texture of the drawing does not look like paper or cloth," Second Uncle said. "I do not know what material that is, but you cannot break through its layers."

Hearing them say it was a drawing, Han Sen realized that it did sort of look like what they described. The two circular sticks must have contained the drawing. There were also dark red papers inside it. Because the papers were sticking to the circular sticks, one could not see them if one did not look closely. One only saw that something was stuck between the two circular sticks.

"That's weird. The Kirin placed a metal box inside his palace and enclosed it in one of the statues. And the metal box held the drawing scroll. That scroll can steal the god spirit genes..." Han Sen was able to tell that the scroll was not very aggressive, but his power couldn't hurt it. His heart jumped. When the scroll fell back, he decided to capture it.

It was now in Han Sen's hands, but the scroll still struggled to try to get the purple evil lotus, which was also in his hands. Its power was not very strong, so it was unable to escape Han Sen's grasp on it.

Han Sen quickly realized that the scroll wasn't a threat to him, so he put away the evil purple lotus. He used both hands to hold onto the handles of the scroll. He opened the scroll to see if there really was a drawing on it.

When he pulled it apart, he felt as if the scroll had been stuck together with strong glue. Han Sen tried his best, but he could only open it about two or three centimeters.

Both sides of the scroll near where it had unrolled showed a part of the picture. It meant that where Han Sen was pulling open was the center of the drawing.

Han Sen knew his power was not enough to open the scroll. Its power was too strong. It eventually bounced back. Han Sen quickly looked at what he was able to see, hoping to glean something out of the meager view.

While he was looking, he saw something. There was a line of words visible. It was written in the geno universe's common language, so Han Sen could read each word. The text was black, and it was written on a red background. The words on the scroll read "Tai Yi," which was followed by a space. After that were three more words: "Killing the gods."

Han Sen thought, "Tai Yi... Is that the Tai Yi who I once met... Has he killed a god too? Are gods that easy to kill? I thought only people with super genes could kill gods. Sacred Leader researched it for a long time, and he was unable to kill the gods. Who is this random guy that came out of nowhere and killed gods?"

His power was already fading, and he was now losing focus. The power in his hands was growing weaker. The scroll closed where Han Sen had revealed the words, making a "pat" sound.

Second Uncle and the others flew over to him. Londo curiously asked, "Mister Holy Baby, did you learn what was inside this drawing?"

"I cannot open it. I don't know what's inside it." Han Sen was holding the squirming scroll as he spoke. He did not want to tell people about the scroll, especially people from the Extreme King.

"Let's not talk right now," Bao Ying said. "Let's just leave the big barren systems. This place is far too dangerous."

"What's there to be afraid of?" Londo apathetically asked. "With Mister Holy Baby around, why must we be afraid of the xenogeneics here? He has the ability to kill a god."

"Let's just leave." Han Sen knew his business. He was only able to kill Evil Lotus God because of Sky Vine Radish and the pottery powder. If he'd had to fight a true god class xenogeneic, not even his Cold Light Sword would have been enough. Plus, a god spirit was useless against a xenogeneic. Bad things were bound to happen to them.

Thinking of Cold Light Sword, Han Sen looked into his Sea of Soul and saw there were another two Cold Light Sword beast souls. He had received them when he slaughtered the big band of Cold Light Charms.

He looked at the Cold Light Charms' information and noticed they were the same as the one Han Sen had before. They were Cold Light Swords, but their descriptions were a bit different. One of them said it was broken, and the other was just like the one Han Sen had. That one said it was half-complete.

Han Sen looked and immediately noticed that the Cold Light Sword beast soul that was labeled as broken was weaker than the other two.

"I wonder if the Cold Light Sword beast souls can be combined." Han Sen's heart jumped at the possibility. He saw the three Cold Light Charm beast souls stick together. Their spirit bodies combined and started twisting around. They combined into a new Cold Light Sword beast soul.

This new Cold Light Charm beast soul was obviously stronger than the other three Cold Light Charm beast souls. Just looking at its presence, one could tell that it was much stronger.

Han Sen looked at the information, delighted.

[Deified Beast Soul Cold Light Charm: Cold Light Sword (perfect)]

"At half-complete, it was already like a butterfly treasure weapon. Now, it's perfect? Maybe the Cold Light Sword can compete with true god weapons. If that's true, I am going to be rich," Han Sen thought, mega excited. He anxiously anticipated using his Cold Light Sword again and flexing its power.
