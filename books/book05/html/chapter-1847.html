<p>Inside the base, people continued to become infected. Han Sen
wanted to leave, taking Little Angel, Zero, and the others with
him. But he was not sure if the strange contagion had already
spread to his companions. If he left now, with an infection amongst
them, things could turn pretty bleak.</p>
<p>If they stayed there and did get infected, at least Deep Blue
Viscount might be able to deduce a way in which it could be
stopped.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount said that when he had originally been
afflicted with the mark, he had eaten the root of a lotus that he
found in the palace. He reckoned that was why the mark hadn’t
affected him. All the other Nobles with him died, leaving him as
the sole survivor. But now, the mark had returned, and it was
getting darker and darker. That was why he wanted to return to the
planet and revisit the hall in order to eat more of the lotus
roots.</p>
<p>But there was a group of xenogeneics outside the entrance to the
palace, and some of them were Earl rank. So, Deep Blue Viscount had
been unable to find a way in which he could access the place.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount was curious about how Wind Viscount had
managed to penetrate the palace. He figured he would have to return
there to find out how.</p>
<p>Han Sen then thought of an important question to ask. When Deep
Blue Viscount entered the palace the first time, he was just a Kate
with geno armor. Now he was a Viscount. Becoming a Noble of that
rank was not an easy task.</p>
<p>Even a wealthy elite like Yisha only had a dozen of the geno
fluids that could encourage a second evolution, so how could Deep
Blue Viscount achieve such a rank? Han Sen asked this question, and
Deep Blue said that he did not know how he had managed to evolve a
second time, either. To his knowledge, he had not used any
treasures. But it wasn’t long before he left this planet that he
evolved for a second time. Perhaps it had something to do with the
lotus root.</p>
<p>Matters were proceeding to get worse, though. It wasn’t long
before Gu Qingcheng developed a mark on her forehead. Han Sen told
her about the palace and the lotus root, and he told her not to
worry. When the time came, they would head out and get one of the
lotus roots.</p>
<p>Black Steel was accurate, and four and a half hours later, he
did indeed land outside the front gate. But aside from Black Steel,
a few other of the Rebate had come as well. Judging from the
strength of their auras, Han Sen could immediately tell they were
not ordinary folk.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! What’s going on now?” Black Steel looked at Han Sen’s
forehead.</p>
<p>“It’s bad! Half of my people have been infected with the mark of
an egg.” It was starting to depress Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You go and confirm it,” one of the superior-looking Rebate
said.</p>
<p>The other Rebate went to check the foreheads of the women and
children, while Black Steel went into Han Sen’s office. With a
serious look, he said, “You are in trouble. If I am not mistaken,
Wind Viscount touched something which belonged to the Raven.”</p>
<p>“Raven?” Han Sen looked confused.</p>
<p>Black Steel explained to him, “Before the Rebate took over
Narrow Moon, it was the Raven who owned this place. They were a
strong xenogeneic group that had a grip on the entirety of Narrow
Moon. History says that they had the ability to mark other
xenogeneics and control them.”</p>
<p>Black Steel went on to say, “When we took down Narrow Moon, it
came at a great cost. If it wasn’t for our deified elder, it was
highly unlikely that we’d have won the fight. We thought the Raven
were entirely destroyed, following the battle.</p>
<p>I did not expect a relic of theirs to remain, especially one
that is still so deadly.”</p>
<p>“Is there a way to erase the mark of the Raven?” Han Sen thought
that if the Rebate took down Narrow Moon, there had to be a way. If
there wasn’t, they’d all have ended up infected, and they’d all be
dead.</p>
<p>“Not yet.” Black Steel shook his head.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by not yet?” Han Sen was confused.</p>
<p>“Many of my race suffered this mark. We discovered that killing
the Raven and drinking their blood was the only way to make the
mark disappear. If you want to get rid of it, the only way to
achieve that is to find the item Wind Viscount found. And then,
maybe you can.” Black Steel looked straight at Han Sen and went on
to say, “I am not sure if you are infected. We need to make sure
that the infection does not leave this place. And we must locate
the source of the infection, wherever it may be.”</p>
<p>Han Sen relayed to him what Deep Blue Viscount had told him.
Black Steel nodded and said, “If someone has info like this, that
is great. I brought one of my father’s guards with us. Captain Wood
is a Duke. The rest are Marquise. We are all prepared to go to the
Raven palace.”</p>
<p>Black Steel went to find Captain Wood and Deep Blue Viscount,
letting Deep Blue Viscount explain the situation again to him.</p>
<p>Captain Wood looked at Deep Blue Viscount and asked, “Why didn’t
you say this sooner?”</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount gave a wry smile. They were all dead, and
only I survived. I was worried I might get in trouble for telling
people what happened. Especially with the mark gone.”</p>
<p>Han Sen understood the man’s reasoning. If he admitted what had
happened, it was likely that the Rebate would have grown
suspicious. The only reason he was telling the story now was
because he had to go back to the palace. If the mark hadn’t
returned, he would not have wanted to come back to such a wretched
place.</p>
<p>After Captain Wood had finished asking Deep Blue Viscount about
various details, he decided to go to the Raven palace, as well.</p>
<p>Last time, Chiron Earl had taken some Viscounts and Earls, and
even some creatures with him. This time, they had Captain Wood and
four Marquise. It shouldn’t have been too hard to reach the same
point as Chiron.</p>
<p>Wood allowed Han Sen to select a few people to come along. Deep
Blue Viscount said there was a pool with the lotus fruit, and there
were many of them. It would be best if he brought some people to
collect as many roots as they could, in order to suppress the
mark.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng had the mark, so she elected to go there herself.
Xie Qing King wanted to go, too. Han Sen stopped Little Angel and
Zero, though. If no one was watching the base, it was impossible to
tell what the Barons might do after they became infected. There was
a high chance the women and children would be in danger.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t seem too bad. We can eat the roots as soon as we
get them,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Aside from them, Han Sen picked ten Barons to go with him. They
could help gather the roots, at the very least. There were so many
of them, and their time was almost up. If they couldn’t get to the
bottom of the issue, they’d have to bring a lot of the roots
back.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought Lake Viscount with him, as well. With Wood
there, he wouldn’t dare to say no.</p>
