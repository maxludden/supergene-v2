  Dong!

In the swordlight that brought ruin to everything, a golden light suddenly cracked the fabric of space. It traveled through the swordlight and smacked into Six Paths Sword, then stuck to it.

Everyone realized that the golden light was actually a coin. It was a beautiful coin.

Boom!

The Six Paths Sword, which had previously been at the center of existence, had now been wrecked by that coin.

The power that was going into the sword then started to travel into the coin.

The scariest thing about this was the fact that the super elites, who had previously been able to stop their energy from leaking, were now unable to stop the process. The leaders of Outer Sky and Sacred also suffered under the coin. A portion of their energy was being stolen by the coin.

Even the power and energy of the Six Paths Sword was being taken by the coin. Eventually, the coin was bigger than the sword itself.

Dong!

A crunchy noise sounded, and Six Paths Emperor was no longer able to control the sword. He allowed it to fall, and when it came to a stop, it stood erect with its tip dug into the ground. Six Paths Emperor was still clutching the handle, and it was clear he wished to pull it out of the ground but couldn’t The sword actually got heavier and heavier, and as it sank into the earth, Six Paths Emperor started to go down with it.

All the beings in the audience were shocked, watching was what was happening to the Six Paths Sword. The power Six Paths had gathered was nearly godlike, and yet, it had been beaten by what looked like a measly coin. His sword could not take the weight

Six Paths, who had now lost the sword, was frozen. That sword was something he had never lost before. To him, his life was his sword and his sword was his life. Having now lost his sword, he no longer wished to do combat.

“Even God is afraid of Collecting Taxes. Collecting Taxes is scary.” Han Sen sighed, and then he flicked his finger once more.

A shower of coins began to rain, and they covered the entire arena. They landed on Six Paths in frightening numbers, until he was buried beneath a mountain of them. A severe weight pressed down on him.

Six Paths didn’t move. All he could do was turn his head to see the coins that fell. He looked at Han Sen and smiled. “I lost, The sword is yours. There will be no other Six Paths Sword. When you see me again, all you will see is Six Paths.”

After that, Six Paths Emperor wiggled his fingers; he was disconnecting himself from the Six Paths Sword. And when he did that, the sword released its power and just fell on the floor. Six Paths Emperor’s mouth bled, but he still worked up a smile before leaving. He conceded, leaving behind the Six Paths Sword that was on the ground.

Han Sen did not feel joyous, though. After that fight, Six Paths had decided to abandon his sword. The sword in his heart must have been very scary, and if they fought again, victory would be even harder to achieve.

Han Sen picked up the sword and exited the arena, returning to his shelter.

Han Sen and Six Paths had left the stage, but the battle had been incredibly exciting. It had shocked the entire Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

Six Paths was half a god, but he had lost to the enigmatic Dollar. Everyone was curious about his true identity, and everyone thought Dollar would win the entire Divinity’s Bout. He would surpass the ten Son of Gods and become the first Son of God.

The media in the Alliance had reported the news, as well.

“Champion’s Return”, “The Dollar Crushes Everything”, “God Versus God”, “The Power of Dollar.” All sorts of articles were released after the fight. They spoke passionately about the battle and Dollar’s victory there.

“Dollar is the best!”

“He must be able to reach first place.”

“Don’t worry, Dollar will never disappoint us. If he wants to, he’ll definitely wind up in first place.”

The Fourth God’s Sanctuary’s Divinity’s Bout was something that had little to do with the general populace of the Alliance, but it was still a popular topic of conversation, nonetheless.

Not many people saw the fight, either. And journalists were only able to make write-ups through interviews that were held with demigod witnesses. It was the only way for them to learn what happened.

Due to their inability to locate Dollar, the journalists asked the demigods that watched the fight.

Fang Mingquan’s interview was the most popular, and that was because he was famous and knew a lot of people. He had interviewed many demigods in the past, and he was a big fan of Dollar. People that liked Dollar would often go and read his articles.

“Demigod Tang, what is your opinion of the fight between Dollar and Six Paths?” Fang Mingquan interviewed Tang Zhenliu, a person he was quite close with.

Tang Zhenliu smiled and said, “Where do I begin? I mean, Six Paths was strong, but he just wasn’t on the same level as Dollar. Dollar will be able to get to the top ten Son of Gods, for sure, and he might even achieve first place.”

…

Most demigods that accepted the interview said many similar things. They all thought Dollar could reach the top ten, at the very least.

But there were some unpleasant voices amidst the crowds, and some whispered Dollar was simply lucky. If he reached the top ten, it’d be through good fortune. There were many powerful spirits and creature ahead, and with them thinking Dollar was a cocky person, they didn’t think he’d reach the top hundred.

There were quite a few arguments surrounding this, and the Alliance turned its focus to the issue.

The elites in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary spent a lot of time researching the fight. They were looking for a way they might be able to disarm the coin and beat Dollar if he ever came for them.

Right now, Dollar had become their biggest, number one enemy. He was the likeliest candidate to reach the top ten thus far. The people felt very lucky when it was confirmed they might not have to face Dollar, but for those that had to fight him, they researched and researched. They wanted to find a way they might win.

Han Sen didn’t think much about any of this, though. He just retired to the practice of Dongxuan Sutra. The Dollar geno core had reached super class after the fight, and he was fairly confident he could reach first place.

If Han Sen could get all his geno cores to super, that would be even easier.

Before the next round started, Han Sen practiced constantly with the Dongxuan Sutra.

When Han Sen entered the arena next, it was four days later. He didn’t have to fight, though, as every opponent he went up against had to concede. No one dared to do combat with him.

The opponents of the next four rounds conceded, and all super elites grew fearful of Dollar.
