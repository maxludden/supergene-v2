<p>Han Sen opened the stone door and looked around its frame, already on full alert. On the other side, he found a black vortex. And before he had even the slightest chance to react, a powerful suction tried to yank him inside.</p>

<p>With a spike of adrenaline, Han Sen mustered as much power as he could to push himself back away from the door, but ultimately, he could not stave it off. He was pulled into the stone room.</p>

<p>Han Sen found himself in a dark, wet cave.</p>

<p>Wa-la-la! Wa-la-la!</p>

<p>The cave echoed with the sound of a chain whipping rock. Then, a large shape began to emerge from the darkness.</p>

<p>A monster was approaching, with a kirin body and green bird wings. It was ten meters tall and had the head of a tiger. Its glowing green eyes gave Han Sen the chills.</p>

<p>The monster was way too scary. Its mere presence was enough to rob Han Sen of breath.</p>

<p>Many long black chains perforated its body and were anchored to the stone of the cave. When it was only ten meters away from Han Sen, those black chains were yanked tight. It couldn’t reach Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not dare be reckless, and so he summoned his bai sema. The fiend was locked up, but it was powerful.</p>

<p>Even its breath would be destructive, and Han Sen knew full well his own inability to defeat it in combat.</p>

<p>“Is Sky Palace failing? Did it send you both here to die?” The monster coldly looked at Han Sen.</p>

<p>“What is this? Sky Palace leader can’t mean for me to go up against this thing, surely. Even though it is locked up, there is no way I can slay it,” Han Sen thought.</p>

<p>He used his Dongxuan Aura to observe the King class creature, but he noted that an accurate reading was rendered impossible by the chains. That being said, some of its power was spilling through the suppressing chains. It wasn’t completely locked down.</p>

<p>Han Sen stopped looking. The King class creature’s green eyes shone like green lanterns.</p>

<p>Han Sen hid within his Demon Bug Bai Sema as the monster’s eyes became brighter. The increasing glow was difficult to look away from, though.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Han Sen felt as if his brain had exploded in his head. Within those lantern-like eyes, Han Sen thought he saw a strange symbol. It didn’t look real.</p>

<p>That symbol was seared into his brain as if it had been branded by a hot iron, and when the symbol was fully imprinted, it kickstarted a storm inside of his mind.</p>

<p>It was a real storm, too, as Han Sen felt a wind blowing across his body. In his mind, he saw a soft wind stirring leaves, a sandstorm raging in a desert, and then a sea kicking up a violent tsunami. All these different sorts of wind powers were surging into his brain.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew that all of this was taking place inside his imagination, but it still affected him like it was real.</p>

<p>The black-masked woman stood outside the stone door, leaning against a wall as she waited. Her eyes were closed, and it almost looked as if she was waiting for something specific to happen.</p>

<p>“The seventy-two genes of original killing have been suppressed for a million years. Many Kings have wanted to learn the original gene spells, but they have always failed. Han Sen has been sent here to endure that original gene spell power. Is that old man insane? Even if Han Sen’s will is as strong as a King’s, he won’t be able to take the mental duress. Then I’ll have to deal with it.” The woman spoke to herself, eyes closed as if she was dreaming.</p>

<p>After a while, the woman opened her eyes and looked surprised.</p>

<p>“How can he endure the original gene spell power?” The woman frowned.</p>

<p>In a dark world, only one place had light. Under that dim light, a broken palace was visible. In its plaza, a six-year-old boy was engaged in combat with a strange bird.</p>

<p>The little boy kept moving, his shadow flickering over the ground like a real bird’s. His shadow occasionally aided him as he fought the bird in the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the bird and the boy split up. The strange bird laughed and said, “Littleflower is talented. If his holy body can become deified, he can make Sacred great again.”</p>

<p>“It will still take many years for him to become deified. It isn’t easy to raise a holy body to that level,” Auntie Mei said with a roll of her eyes. “But it is almost time for the Geno Being Scroll, so Littleflower can participate. He can earn Sacred some reputation, and let the old elites know that Sacred is still around.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he must join it.” Old Eagle nodded. He looked at the Nine-Life Cat and went on to say, “Old Cat, what do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think it is time for people to know Sacred has some new blood,” Old Cat said coldly.</p>

<p>“Good. This is it, then.” Old Eagle and the other monsters all looked excited. They all screamed, “Littleflower, you have to earn the number one spot for us!”</p>

<p>Over the next year, Han Sen made sure to enter the Hidden Path Cave each and every day. Every time he was there, he would have to endure the powers of the original gene kill spells.</p>

<p>The creature in the cave was chained and suppressed, but looking into its eyes could activate the original gene spell power. When Han Sen fought against that power, he learned something.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because he had been blessed by the ten thousand gourds, but he understood all the elements. When he looked at the original gene kill spell, it was easy for him to understand.</p>

<p>But those spells did not ever seem to work on Bao’er. She was with him every time he went to the cave, but she appeared to be completely unaffected by the kill spell and its effects. While Han Sen wrestled with the spell in his head, Bao’er would just look around curiously.</p>

<p>So, over the course of that year, Han Sen split his time between Hidden Path Cave and the White Jade Building, where he continued to absorb Jade Fairy Spirits whenever the Jade Air was released. The Jade Spirits were an opportunity he couldn’t afford to miss.</p>

<p>Going to the seventh floor to absorb the Jade Fairy Spirits became routine, but after a while, the growth of his Jadeskin’s power suddenly accelerated. The godlight gathered on him, and before long, he looked pretty much like a Jade Fairy Spirit himself. The fairy-like visage that covered him came out of his own shadow.</p>

<p>“Aha! Jadeskin has finally leveled up to Marquise.” Han Sen was pretty happy about this development, but it was a shame he was still inside the White Jade Tower when it popped. He was extremely eager to try out his new Jadeskin powers as soon as he possibly could.</p>
