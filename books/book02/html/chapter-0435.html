    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the shattered crystal on the floor, shocked. When humans
      were still living on planet Earth only, scientists at that time believed
      that human brains were only developed 10%, with lots potentials to tap
      into.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, with the development of science and technology, the theory had
      been proven absurd.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each part of human brain had its unique function, so there was no
      underdeveloped area at all. In order to enhance the ability of the brain,
      the brain must further evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      The evolution human went through in God’s Sanctuary could make one’s brain
      evolve as well. Therefore, in this day and age, people with higher degree
      of evolution would have a stronger brain, which made them smarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, compared to the evolution of the body, the evolution of the brain
      was significantly slower. The fact that the crystal from Crystallizer
      civilization could accelerate the evolution of the brain was amazing. At
      least until this point, human had not been able to manufacture any
      medicine or device that could directly stimulate the brain to evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      This technology alone showed how magnificent Crystallizer civilization
      was. What was more puzzling was what made such an ingenious species had
      disappeared in history.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There are many great things like this in Crystallizer technologies.
      However, the Crystallizer ruins were too dangerous, so we have not been
      able to get a lot from it. In addition, there are some objects from their
      civilization that we do not understand yet.&#8221; Ji Yanran then told Han
      Sen more about Crystallizers.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;These must be highly confidential. Is it okay you’re telling
      me?&#8221; Han Sen asked Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;These are indeed confidential. And you do not have the clearance
      yet. However, you’re my boyfriend and I am no selfless captain, just a
      woman. But don’t tell anyone about these, otherwise I would be in
      trouble.&#8221; Ji Yanran spit out her little tongue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Didn’t you say there is a surveillance camera… Ha, how dare you
      play me… You are so done…&#8221; Han Sen suddenly understood that he was
      played by Ji Yanran, grabbed her, held her down to the desk and spanked
      her hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I did not lie to you. There is really a surveillance camera. It’s
      just I turned it off temporarily. I know you would be so
      promiscuous…&#8221; Trying to ignore the sensation on her ass, Ji Yanran
      whispered.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;All right, I will show you how promiscuous I could be.&#8221; Han
      Sen suddenly pulled Ji Yanran’s white captain pants down.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;No…hmmm…&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen left the captain’s cabin, he felt very refreshed and relaxed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The thought of the captain suit and tender skin of Ji Yanran gave Han Sen
      an urge to return to Captain’s cabin and stay there forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, that was quite unlikely. Ji Yanran had already told Han Sen some
      information about Daphne. Although Ji Yanran was the captain, she was too
      young and inexperienced. If it were not for her family, she would not even
      be recognized as the captain because she was just a rookie evolver.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, Daphne was a special warship. There was a professor that had
      the same power as Ji Yanran, so she had to obey him at times, since the
      main mission was to explore and research the ruins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost all members of the expert panel had high social status, so they
      always had a say in the operation of the ship. There were many things that
      Ji Yanran could not decide on her own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, as much as Han Sen would like to sleep until he woke up
      naturally every day with his girlfriend in his arm, it was not realistic.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, if others knew Han Sen was Ji Yanran’s lover and that he was
      on the ship because of her, they would probably think even less of Ji
      Yanran, making it harder for her to stay in the management role.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew it was not easy for Ji Yanran to get him on board, so he was
      unwilling to see her getting in trouble because of him. So, for the
      moment, he had to keep his relationship with her a secret and perform his
      duty as a cookhouse soldier with his head down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the two of them were both on Daphne. When there was no one
      around, they could call each other using the special comlink on board.
      Occasionally, they could even meet each other in secret, to which Han Sen
      was looking forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feels like a clandestine love affair. Han Sen thought to himself
      contentedly and started to hum a little song.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was still thinking about the romance just now. Because it was on
      the warship, he let his guard down completely and wasn’t paying attention.
      As he turned around the corner, he bumped into someone immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had just been through some strenuous exercise, so his legs were
      still limp. Not paying attention, he stepped backward immediately.
      Fortunately, Han Sen reacted fast, steadied himself, and did not fall on
      the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Which department do you belong to? Why are you walking around here
      and humming?&#8221; It was a man in uniform between twenty and thirty
      years old. Judging from his badge, he should be a colonel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fats squad leader was also a colonel, so this guy was likely to be
      some squad leader as well. However, since Han Sen did not work for him,
      there was no need for Han Sen to explain anything. Without even looking at
      the man, Han Sen simply walked over, as if he did not exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’re lucky that I’m in a great mood, so I will just let you off the hook
      for the time being. Han Sen continued to walk forward joyfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What’s wrong with you? I was talking to you. Did you not hear me?
      Which department are you from?&#8221; The man became mad and quickly
      grabbed Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What does it have to do with you?&#8221; Han Sen frowned and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he was being careless, he was not walking fast. There was no way
      he would bump into someone directly. The main reason that the guy bumped
      into him was that the guy did not change his course at all after seeing
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Otherwise, with Han Sen’s reflex, there was no way they would bump into
      each other so hard. That guy was doing it on purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You don’t even look like a soldier. Stand straight…&#8221; The man
      snorted.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whether the cookhouse soldiers look like soldiers, it is up to me
      instead of the Warframe Department. Colonel Wang, Place mind your own
      department’s business,&#8221; the fat squad leader suddenly appeared and
      said to the guy coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Colonel Luo, I can’t even point it out when your soldier is bumping
      into people and humming songs. Is that what you’re saying?&#8221; Wang Hou
      stared at fat squad leader coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, that’s our hobby. Bite me.&#8221; The fat squad leader’s reply
      even surprised Han Sen. Wang Hou’s face suddenly turned purple, as he was
      rendered speechless.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why are you staying here?&#8221; The fat squad leader said to Han
      Sen and took him away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Hou bristled. When the fat squad leader and Han Sen walked far, Wang
      Hou murmured to himself, &#8220;Why did Ji Yanran keep a cookhouse soldier
      in her office for so long? If it were not for the stupid fatty, I should
      have fished more information.&#8221;
