<p>“Night God No Moon? Isn’t that the name given to Moon God by the
Qin Kingdom? Does she have a gene race in the Qin Kingdom?” Han Sen
was shocked by this.</p>
<p>If there was a gene race left behind by Moon God, it could be
unique.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen said, “Let’s not mention this person Night God No
Moon, but just this Mirror Moon gene race has a very legendary
story behind it.” “What is so amazing about this gene race?” Han
Sen asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen said, “This gene race has a legend that Night God
No Moon’s friend left behind. After that person died, Night God No
Moon did not keep the gene race. She kept it someplace. Whenever
she missed that friend, she went to see that gene race and speak
with it.”</p>
<p>“Of course, there is another side to the story. It says that
Night God No Moon was never able to claim that gene race, and that
was the reason why she kept it there. In fact, that gene race has
been in the Qin Kingdom for a billion years, but no one has ever
been able to claim it. Fortunately, its personality is considered a
rather nice one. As a matter of fact, it is even a bit lazy. If you
do not incite its wrath, it will not hurt anyone. It has always
been kept inside Jade Wall City.” “I did not know that.” Han Sen
was very curious about this creature, so he could not help but ask,
“What species is this gene race?”</p>
<p>“If you are interested, Mister Han, please go and take a look.”
Qin Jing Zhen paused. He spoke to an officer and said, “Take Han
Sen to Candle Garden.”</p>
<p>“Mister Han, I am sick. I cannot go with you. You go check it
out. It will be a fantastic thing if you are able to claim it. If
you cannot, we will think of something else.” Qin Jing Zhen coughed
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Take care, My King. I will leave you now.” Han Sen did not
suggest a way in which he could help Qin Jing Zhen yet.</p>
<p>It was not like Han Sen did not want to help him. It was just
that he had no better way to do it. Wan’er’s power was all over Qin
Jing Zhen. The only thing that could save his ravaging was Wan’er.
Not even Qin Xiu would have been able to help him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode repelled Wan’er’s power, but
Wan’er’s power was far stronger now. His Super God Spirit mode
worked on Qin Jing Zhen, but he could not scrub it all away.</p>
<p>Han Sen forced himself to break the rules of the universe to use
the Super God Spirit mode and delay the inevitable death of Qin
Jing Zhen. It was because of his Super God Spirit mode. Other
people were not even able to extend his life by one second, and
breaking the universe was considered taboo. It cost Super God
Spirit mode power to do this. Han Sen only asked for a God Spirit
gene race in return, so it was not too costly.</p>
<p>Han Sen said Qin Jing Zhen might one day be all better. That was
not entirely a lie.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen was Qin Xiu’s heir. If he was able to live when
Qin Xiu came back, perhaps there was a chance Wan’er would be
willing to save him. That was one of the possibilities Han Sen had
considered. If Han Sen was able to reverse his Super God Spirit
mode, he could save the dying king himself. That was another chance
he could put faith in.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, these two opportunities for
saving the king were in the future. At this point, no one could do
anything</p>
<p>Han Sen went to Candle Garden, which had a weird presence. It
kept appearing and disappearing. Sometimes it was there, and
sometimes it was not there. It made Han Sen be unable to look at
it.</p>
<p>“Candle Garden is a place where no trespassers may go,” the
officer said at the gate. He did not go forward. “Without the
king’s orders, no one is allowed to enter. I can only bring you
this far.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Han Sen pushed the door open and went into Candle
Garden.</p>
<p>Candle Garden was big, but the big garden did not have flowers,
grass, woods, or trees. It did not have fake mountains or streams
of water. The ground was composed of stone boards. There was also a
small pavilion. The small pavilion was very tiny. Compared to the
garden at large, it was very empty. Han Sen looked at the stone
desk inside the stone pavilion. The garden did not have anything in
it. There was only the stone desk on the inside, which had half a
white candle.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a weird presence earlier. He determined it came
from this strange half candle.</p>
<p>“Weird. If this half-candle is the legendary gene race, it
should be a fire element one. Why did Qin Jing Zhen say it was Yin
and cold? Why does the half-candle not seem to have anything to do
with Mirror Moon? Is this half-candle not Mirror Moon’s gene race?”
Han Sen frowned as he looked around. The results of the inspection
were the same as before. Aside from the half-burned candle, there
was nothing else to espy in the garden. Besides the fact that there
were no gene races there, there also weren’t any ordinary
plants.</p>
<p>“This is a little strange. Is the half-candle really Mirror
Moon?” Han Sen stepped toward the stone pavilion. He sensed that
the candle was nothing ordinary, but the presence was very hidden.
Han Sen could not see it clearly.</p>
<p>Outside the pavilion, he did not think the candle was very
special. When he went to the stone pavilion, he felt cold.
Everything seemed to go dark. It was like he had just entered a
cold and dark cave.</p>
<p>He could not see anything beyond the pavilion. Everything was
pitch black. He could not even see his fingers. All he could see
was the very dim light of the candle that was down upon the
table.</p>
<p>The light was weird. The candlelight outside the pavilion looked
yellowish. It looked like any ordinary candle.</p>
<p>As he looked upon it now, the candlelight was blueish and
greenish. It was a distinctly ghost-like fire, and it released a
scary and cold air. The cold air in the stone pavilion came from
the candle.</p>
<p>Han Sen entered the stone pavilion. He suddenly heard the old
man with white hair, whom he had encountered in the palace, coldly
said, “You are an outsider, yet you wish to take Mirror Moon. If
you were smart, you would leave right now. If you are too slow, I
am afraid you are just going to die here.” After pausing, the old
man with white hair said, “Jing Zhen fears his demise. He must have
become possessed. His wounds cannot be healed by an
Annihilation-class elite. He believes an outsider human can help
him. It looks like he is just a commoner after all. He is nothing
like how a true king should be. If the Qin Kingdom can ever hope to
unite the universe, it will always boil down to the strength of an
heir.”</p>
<p>After saying that, the old man with white hair looked glum as he
said, “Jing Zhen only has one son, Qin Bai. On top of that, the kid
is an asshole. The Qin Kingdom’s fate is something we should worry
about. I am afraid I will have to wait for the right moment. I
should wait for the real Qin king to show up.” Han Sen looked at
the candle and thought, “Qin Jing Zhen did not lie. This
half-candle is a Yin and cold gene race after all. Still, it is a
bit different. While it has fire, the fire is awfully cold. What
kind of gene race is this? Why is it called Mirror Moon?”</p>
<p>While he was thinking, Han Sen stepped toward the candle. Even
if that half-candle wasn’t a worthy match for Jadeskin, having that
powerful gene race was still beneficial.</p>
