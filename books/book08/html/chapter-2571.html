<h3>Chapter 2571</h3>

<p>Han Sen memorized the Crystal Furnace skill, then he broke the
crystal wall back down and tossed the remains into the burning
sea.</p>
<p>Although the Crocodile God hadn’t clamped down on his freedom to
explore, Han Sen knew that a being of such power would be to
control the whole fortress. If Han Sen did something bad, like
opening his core area hall, he would be immediately stopped. So,
Han Sen didn’t make any reckless escape attempts. Instead, he did
legitimate work, shoveling and cleaning things up properly. He
cleaned like a man who had come from a long line of noble
janitors.</p>
<p>The crystallizers were a race that focused on technology.
Unfortunately, it meant there were few leads for Han Sen to follow
up on. There were many tools available, but Han Sen didn’t know how
to make use of any of them. Most of the machines were probably too
broken to be repaired, anyway.</p>
<p>As he continued to fail to find anything useful, Han Sen became
less and less enthused with cleaning. He tried bringing out many
items to attract the attention of the little Crocodile God, but the
creature wasn’t interested in any of the things he offered to it.
Clearly, Han Sen had no idea what it fancied.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer kept trying to escape, but all their
attempts failed. They were in more of a rush to get out of there
than Han Sen was. However, every time they tried to run, the
Crocodile God’s control of gravity pulled them back. They were
unable to teleport away, either.</p>
<p>One day, as Han Sen was cleaning up a fallen room, he found a
table.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>The table and the room’s equipment were all broken. The table
was cut in half, and all four of the table’s legs were broken. But
there was a drawer under the table that hadn’t been damaged. Due to
the fact that the table had been broken, the drawer had popped
open. After quickly rummaging through it, Han Sen found a box.</p>
<p>The box was made of wood, which was rare to see in a
crystallizer’s territory. Han Sen opened the lid and found a pair
of glasses inside.</p>
<p>The glasses sort of looked like sunglasses. They looked really
cool, and the glass itself was dark like charcoal. They didn’t look
see-through at all.</p>
<p>“What is this rare and strange item? Were these glasses intended
for a blind man?” Han Sen murmured as he fiddled with the item.
There was nothing weird about them, and so he simply put them
on.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen put them on, the pitch-black glasses grew
transparent like crystal.</p>
<p>No, they were more transparent than crystal. When Han Sen looked
out through the glasses, he couldn’t even see the glass that was
resting across his own face. And as this happened, lots of data
began to scroll across the screen of the glasses. The data whizzed
by in a blur, and Han Sen soon heard a voice. It seemed to be
coming from the glasses, but it played directly in Han Sen’s
ears.</p>
<p>“System scanning… Genes confirmed… Crystallizer identity
confirmed… Crystal Furnace data opened.”</p>
<p>Han Sen suspected that this was a high-tech piece of equipment
since it could scan one’s genes. When the voice grew quiet, though,
Han Sen couldn’t feel anything different. The lights and numbers on
the glasses had disappeared.</p>
<p>Aside from that initial procedure, nothing seemed to be
happening.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you still there?” Han Sen asked the glasses.</p>
<p>“Please don’t ask dumb questions. The Crystal Furnace carries
intelligence and sense. Please align yourself with intelligence to
avoid sending the Crystal Furnace unnecessary messages. It is a
waste of energy.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the voice directly in his head, and he suppressed
a sigh. A pair of glasses didn’t like him.</p>
<p>“So…” Han Sen said one word, but then he decided to be quiet. He
spent a moment thinking about what he should say first. He ended up
telling the glasses, “Your name is Crystal Furnace, right? What
functions can you perform?”</p>
<p>“My full name is ZXT27 Crystal Furnace Database. I am in charge
of feeding juveniles.” The voice of the glasses played in Han Sen’s
ears again.</p>
<p>“ZX… what? I am just going to call you Glasses. And what did you
say about feeding juveniles?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I am designed to aid babies in growing up healthily,” Glasses
answered.</p>
<p>“Be specific. What can you do for babies?” Han Sen asked after a
second.</p>
<p>“The main services I provide are collecting a person’s data and
analyzing it with the Crystal Furnace Database.” That explanation
didn’t really help Han Sen. Clearly, Glasses wasn’t that smart.</p>
<p>Glasses seemed to be able to sense what Han Sen was thinking. It
said, “ZXT27 Crystal Furnace Database is the greatest piece of
crystallizer technology. It has an intelligence growth system. The
starting intelligence level is that of a five-year-old crystallizer
child.”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty good,” Han Sen complimented Glasses, but he was
still unable to figure out what it did.</p>
<p>As Han Sen tried to think of a way to ask Glasses more about its
purpose, he saw Exquisite approaching from the swimming pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He used his mind and spoke to Glasses.
“Let’s be more pragmatic. Do you have a see-through function that
allows you to see through walls, or maybe clothes?”</p>
<p>Han Sen remembered that pairs of glasses in fiction often had
that function. He had his Dongxuan Aura, but he couldn’t use it to
see through clothes. If Glasses had that function, then maybe the
device wasn’t too shabby.</p>
<p>“Voyeurism goes against crystallizer law, article 16221.
Violations can result in prison sentences of five to ten years.
ZXT27 is an AI for children, and so it does not allow that
function. A professional worker allowance card is required to
enable that function on your Crystal Furnace Database.”</p>
<p>“Are the crystallizers such good people?” After mulling that
over, Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>“Then, what is it that you do? Show me,” Han Sen said
finally.</p>
<p>“Please select a target,” the pair of glasses said.</p>
<p>“I want her,” Han Sen said as he directed his gaze at Exquisite,
who was coming over.</p>
<p>Symbols and data suddenly ran across Glasses’ screen. The view
of Exquisite zoomed in slightly, like a camera was focusing on her.
The crosshairs locked on tight as Glasses started its analysis.</p>
<p>The glasses didn’t release any light or anything, so Han Sen
didn’t know how Glasses was performing its analysis.</p>
<p>“Collecting data… analyzing data… data…”</p>
<p>Exquisite was already in front of him by now, and the device was
continuing to scroll through data.</p>
<p>“This thing is so slow. It’s as laggy as a dying computer,” Han
Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Why are you wearing black glasses that you can’t see through?
Are you pretending to be a blind man?” Exquisite said, peering at
Han Sen’s face.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m just messing around,” Han Sen said casually. But he
was actually thinking, “It looks like I’m the only person who can
see through the glasses. If other people look at the glasses, all
they see is black. This is quite smart.”</p>
<p>At this time, the voice in the glasses spoke in Han Sen’s head
again. “Scanning was successful. The data has been successfully
analyzed.”</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the image of Exquisite and the data being
displayed on Glasses’ screen. There was a report, too.</p>
<p>“Target: Very High female…” Han Sen looked at the first few
words in front of him in stunned silence.</p>
