<p>Across those big, endless ice fields, even if Han Sen had to use
his Dongxuan Aura to look. He could not find any land pulses or
gene eggs. It made Han Sen confess that his skill had a very
specific purpose. No matter how strong his powers were, he was not
going to be as good as Mister Yang or Bald Guy when it came to
sniffing out potential land pulses.</p>
<p>Tian Jing and Zhen Xia were obviously professionals. They had a
profound knowledge of land pulse discovery skills. According to the
information Bao’er was sending him, Tian Jing and Zhen Xia were
looking for a shocking sky god pulse that possibly contained a rare
gene race called an ice jade evil lady.</p>
<p>“That name suggests it might be compatible with my Jadeskin.
Perhaps my reverse Jadeskin body has hope.” Han Sen followed the
breadcrumb trail Bao’er left him. He tailed the two of them, Tian
Jing and Zhen Xia.</p>
<p>No one would have been defensive around a four- or five-year-old
girl. At least, Tian Jing and Zhen Xia did not think Bao’er was
much of a threat.</p>
<p>“Sister, where did you say this ice jade evil lady gene egg is?”
Zhen Xia asked as he kept walking. “Where do you think it will be
found?”</p>
<p>Tian Jing was holding Bao’er against her chest. She appeared to
be sleeping. She casually said, “Have you heard of ice floating on
the surface with jade hiding in the heart?”</p>
<p>“No. Please teach me,” Zhen Xia politely said.</p>
<p>“Ice is always on the surface, and jade stones always hide
beneath mountains,” Tian Jing said. “This ice jade evil lady has
ice and jade features. Therefore, if there really is a gene egg
that has the ice jade evil lady, it must be wrapped up in an icy
jade.” “What is an icy jade?” Zhen Xia still did not
understand.</p>
<p>Tian Jing looked at the ice fields of nothingness and said, “It
goes with the name. That means it is jade coated in ice. That place
will not have anything particularly strange. Only under a sheet of
ice will there be a jade pulse jade mountain. If there is a
location that resembles this, the ice jade evil lady will probably
be there.” “This ice field has buried god only knows how many
stars,” Zhen Xia said with a wry smile. “There must be some jade
mountain or jade mines below. If we dig it all up, we’ll have been
digging for a billion years. It will be hard to find the ice jade
evil lady.” Tian Jing laughed. “Perhaps not. Ordinarily, the jade
mountain jade pulses do not have ice jade evil ladies. Did I not
tell you that when jade pulses are buried beneath a mountain, the
mountain will be heavily polluted? The air will not be pure in such
a place, and you cannot breed ice jade evil ladies. So, we need to
find a place where the ice and jade pulses are. Aside from that,
you cannot have any pollution. It must be a pure place. That is the
only type of place where an ice jade evil lady gene egg can
exist.”</p>
<p>Zhen Xia suddenly understood something. “I see. I did not expect
there to be so much knowledge and detail within all this. If I came
alone, I do not think I would have been able to find an ice jade
evil lady gene egg. I might not even be able to find a single gene
egg.”</p>
<p>“Brother Zhen, you joined in late. It is totally normal for you
to not know all of this. You’re learning now, so it will benefit
you in the future.” Tian Jing paused and said, “Let’s just go.
Although these are some of the signs, the true scene has yet to be
revealed. Finding it will be a tricky endeavor.”</p>
<p>After that, Tian Jing hurried up her jade Kirin. She spurred it
to cross the ice fields with greater haste.</p>
<p>Zhen Xia sped up with her too, but he secretly dropped an item
on the floor. Tian Jing did not notice.</p>
<p>wa</p>
<p>Bao’er was asleep on Tian Jing’s chest. Her eyes opened a
little. She looked at Zhen Xia.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not in a rush to catch up with Tian Jing. He just
walked slowly across the ice. With Bao’er there, he was not afraid
of losing them.</p>
<p>Even if they found a god pulse, digging the god pulse up to get
the gene egg would take them a long time. So, Han Sen was not in
much of a rush.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen walked across the ice fields. Eventually, he heard some
heavy footsteps come from behind. He turned his head to have a look
and saw nine Holy Wen White Deer pulling a snow-white jade
carriage.</p>
<p>Han Sen used to have a Holy Wen White Deer, but he had given it
to Mister Yang so he could keep his shop running.</p>
<p>The Holy Wen White Deer were excruciatingly rare, but someone
was using nine Holy Wen White Deer to pull a carriage. Each of the
nine Holy Wen White Deer looked like they were in ultimate mode.
They were more beautiful and advanced than the one Han Sen had
given Mister Yang.</p>
<p>“I wonder who is in that carriage. It has to be a big show-off.”
Han Sen looked at the nine Holy Wen White Deer pulling the
carriage. Whoever it was, they seemed to be heading in the same
direction.</p>
<p>The Holy Wen White Deer were very fast. Within a second, they
went right past Han Sen. Because the jade carriage had lots of
mysterious marks, Han Sen’s eyes could not see into it.</p>
<p>Han Sen only saw the person driving. He acknowledged that it was
a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>The lady looked around 17 to 18 years old, yet she could lead
the nine Holy Wen White Deer very well. There was an 80% to 90%
chance that the nine Holy Wen White Deer were her gene races.</p>
<p>That being said, it did make Han Sen a touch more curious. For a
driver to have nine Holy Wen White Deer gene races spoke volumes to
whoever it was on the inside of the carriage. It must have been a
super-rich person or a noble with a lot of authority.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking about all of this, the nine Holy Wen
White Deer went right past him. They stopped. The legs of the nine
Holy Wen White Deer looked like they were pinned to the ice. The
snow-white jade carriage came to a stop too.</p>
<p>“Do you know about knives?” The clear voice of a man came from
inside the carriage.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. It was only him in the area. The voice in
the carriage was obviously addressing him, so he replied, “I
learned a little from my master, but I do not know much.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knife skills were not bad. It was one of the weapons
he was best at using, but he did not think he was only a knifeman.
His for the knife was similar to his skills with bows and swords.
He was just familiar with it. He was not very good at it.</p>
<p>“If your heart does not wield a knife, no matter how strong your
knife skills are, it still won’t be presentable.” Hearing Han Sen’s
answer, the clear voice sighed.</p>
<p>The Holy Wen White Deer started to move. They traveled a
thousand miles in a second and escaped Han Sen’s vision.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to understand what the person inside the jade
carriage meant, but it was different from how Han Sen interpreted
such things. From what Han Sen could tell, loving something and
being good at something was different. He was not like Six Path
King, who loved swords, but that did not mean he was not good with
swords.</p>
<p>The most important thing was whether or not he used his heart
when applying skills. It was not about love or hate.</p>
<p>Of course, if one had love then it was easier to practice, but
it still wasn’t necessary.</p>
<p>Han Sen was interested in many things. When he practiced, he
used his heart and always put in the effort. He did not think his
knife skills were worse than those of the people who loved
knives.</p>
<p>The person in the carriage did not think that way. Although he
sensed Han Sen’s knife skills, Han Sen’s answer told him he was not
someone who cared about knife skills. Therefore, he ignored Han
Sen.</p>
