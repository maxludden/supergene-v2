<p>“Dragon Thirteen of the Dragon,” the Dragon lady said in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>“Dragon Thirteen? Nice name, but this test is not fair,” Han Sen said, trying to buy himself some time.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen knew what Han Sen was doing, but she didn’t call him out on it. She simply smiled and asked, “What is unfair?”</p>

<p>“If I lose, I have to lead you guys somewhere that I might die. And if I win, I only get to live. That is what’s not fair,” Han Sen said with an innocent expression.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen was not mad, and so she asked him kindly, “That is not fair? Then what would you suggest is fair?”</p>

<p>“If I win, for my remaining time in Ancient God’s space, how about you be my bodyguard?” Han Sen suggested, raising an eyebrow at Dragon Thirteen.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen laughed and said, “That’s a good idea! I will be at a disadvantage, but that is okay. I agree to these terms of yours.”</p>

<p>“Then that is the deal,” Han Sen said seriously.</p>

<p>Yes.” Dragon Thirteen brought out a black, screw-shaped lance in her hands.</p>

<p>The moment she grabbed the lance, Han Sen felt spooked. She gave him a strange feeling. And Han Sen could not feel her inside his Dongxuan Aura, so he was unable to determine her true strength.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen held the screw lance, but she did not strike. She sounded confident when she said, “I am not Infinite Buddha. If you wish to use Empty White Teeth to return my attacks, think again.”</p>

<p>“Then what am I supposed to do?” Han Sen laughed.</p>

<p>Han Sen just wanted to buy himself some time so he could rest a little bit more. He did not actually expect Dragon Thirteen to reply.</p>

<p>“The Evilbreaker Lance of the Dragon can break any skill thrown against it. Your returning skill might work on other races, but it won’t work on me. If you seek victory, use your own strength. I hope you do,” Dragon Thirteen said calmly.</p>

<p>“Breaking all skills, you say? That is a bold claim to make,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen simply shrugged. “If you do not believe me, use your Empty White Teeth and see if you are able to return my attack.”</p>

<p>After that, Dragon Thirteen attacked Han Sen. The lance became a line that was sharper than a needle.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not make an attempt. Power that had been concentrated like that was not something he could’ve returned, even if she had not used a skill.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s rabbit shoes unleashed a burst of speed as he dodged Dragon Thirteen’s lance. His Blood Feather Knife was aimed for her neck.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen squinted. Han Sen was just an Earl that was under the Ancient God space’s hampering, and yet, he could be that quick. She was surprised.</p>

<p>She was only a little surprised, though. Dragon Thirteen spun her lance, and the lance temporarily disappeared. When it showed up again, the tip was going to come into contact with Han Sen’s throat.</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned and jumped to the sky. He dodged Dragon Thirteen’s lance and used his Blood Feather Knife.</p>

<p>They kept swooping and flashing between the rocks. No one could accurately trace their movements. They fought for a whole minute, going by each other many times. The knife and lance did not touch each other.</p>

<p>“What is this knifeskill? Teeth Knife should not look like this.” The White Tiger Marquise was in shock.</p>

<p>“That is not Teeth Knife. That is Sky Palace’s Under the Sky.” Sharon’s eyes looked sharp.</p>

<p>“Under the Sky? I have never heard of that before,” the White Tiger Marquise said doubtfully.</p>

<p>Sharon looked at Han Sen and said, “Under the Sky was created a long time ago by a Sky Palace elder. Due to there being many flaws with it, they forbid the students from ever learning it. It seems to me as if that flaw has been fixed, but who might have done that, I do not know.”</p>

<p>“What is so special about this knifeskill?” White Tiger Marquise asked.</p>

<p>“I do not know. I only know this knifeskill is modified and derived from the Textless Book. Due to no one using this skill before, no one really knows how strong it might be. But, people who haven’t learned the Textless Book should not be able to learn it. It is surprising Han Sen has learned Under the Sky, especially as he is an outsider.” Sharon said.</p>

<p>Han Sen used the speed of the rabbit shoes to fight Dragon Thirteen. Han Sen did not know if Evilbreaker Lance had the power to break skills, but he knew that he didn’t have that kind of strength himself. If he became a Marquise, he wagered he could give it a try.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen was not as complex as Lone Bamboo. She maintained simple lance techniques and a simple focus on power. There wasn’t much variety. But even so, the simplicity of the strikes was still very violent. She could use her power to drive them to the max.</p>

<p>If Han Sen did not have the aid of the rabbit shoes’ speed, and Dragon Thirteen was not mellowed by the force of the Ancient God space’s power, then Han Sen would have already been hit.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen is powerful! She is a shining example of pure bravery. Her lance conquers everything! Those of the same level must avoid her carefully. I am not a Marquise, and I am weaker,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

<p>Frighteningly, Dragon Thirteen was becoming bolder for some reason. Her speed and power were increasing, too.</p>

<p>The rabbit shoes started to fail in keeping up with her speed.</p>

<p>“Han Sen was naive to think he could fight Dragon Thirteen. She is the bravest of the Dragons for sure. No one at the same level can fight her. And furthermore, Dragons get stronger the longer they fight. The longer the fight lasts, the worse-off Han Sen will end up,” the White Tiger Marquise said.</p>

<p>Sharon frowned and did not speak. He thought something was wrong, but he couldn’t quite tell what it was.</p>

<p>Han Sen suddenly retreated to gain some distance. Dragon Thirteen, clutching her lance, tried to catch up with him.</p>

<p>But her armor started cracking as if it was being hit by something. It kept getting cut.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen stopped. She looked around and coldly said, “When did you leave this knife air around us?”</p>

<p>“My first strike came while I was airborne. All this time, I have generated countless knife airs. You can’t see them, but if you keep hitting them, you know what will eventually happen, yes?” Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>Combining Under the Sky’s strikes with Moon’s gentility, Han Sen had set up lots of knives in the air. They were like a mesh of puppet wires all around Dragon Thirteen. They hung in the air, strands of invisible knife silk.</p>
