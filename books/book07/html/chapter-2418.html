<p>While Miss Mirror was speaking with two of the four Spring Rain
Kings, whose names were Red Cloud and Night Wind, a sound erupted
from Han Sen’s place, interrupting their discussion.</p>
<p>“I am stupid!” someone screamed.</p>
<p>The three of them swapped strange glances. The voice undeniably
belonged to Falling Leaf, but they couldn’t believe Falling Leaf
would ever yell those words.</p>
<p>Aside from Miss Mirror and the four Kings of Spring Rain,
Falling Leaf was known as one of Spring Rain’s best. She was a very
cruel woman, but she worked hard. She was proud, violent, and
always ready for a fight. How could those words pass through the
mouth of someone like that?</p>
<p>“Was that who it sounded like?” Night Wind turned to Red Cloud
and Miss Mirror with a confused expression.</p>
<p>“We’ll end things here for now. You two can go home.” Miss
Mirror frowned. She stood up and went to Han Sen’s place. She
wanted to see what Han Sen was up to.</p>
<p>A woman like Falling Leaf wasn’t someone who could be forced to
say anything of the sort. She would rather die than make that sort
of admission.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had used some trick to fool Falling Leaf, Miss Mirror
wouldn’t ignore such a transgression. She had sent Falling Leaf to
look after Han Sen, but she wouldn’t stand for the woman being
bullied.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Han Sen asked with a pleasant smile when he
answered the door and saw Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>“What did you do to Falling Leaf?” Miss Mirror frowned.</p>
<p>“What did I do to her? I haven’t spoken much with her. She’s
been playing with Bao’er all this time. Go and take a look, if you
want to.” Han Sen moved aside and gestured for her to enter.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t believe Han Sen. She walked through the entry
and went into the living room. There she found Falling Leaf playing
card games with Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror!” Falling Leaf shot to her feet and bowed.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Falling Leaf’s forbidding face was covered in
little stickers. The sight almost made Miss Mirror want to crack up
in laughter.</p>
<p>“I’m okay.” Falling Leaf’s face blushed deeply, but she didn’t
remove the pieces of paper stuck to her face. She was a killer, and
killers always kept their word. She might have lost the game, but
she wasn’t going to disgrace the rules.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see you are okay.” Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen
and said in a hard voice, “Follow me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged and followed Miss Mirror into the garden.</p>
<p>“You know Falling Leaf is one of my people. You should be
careful how you choose to treat her.” Miss Mirror settled herself
into one of the garden chairs and looked at Han Sen as she
spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “I haven’t done a single thing to her, and I
wouldn’t want to do anything to offend her, either. She is merely
playing with Bao’er. You can ask her if you don’t believe me.”</p>
<p>“It is good that you haven’t mistreated her. I’m just warning
you, though. Don’t do anything that will make her or me unhappy,”
Miss Mirror said in a firm voice.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Han Sen shrugged again.</p>
<p>“Give me your hand.” Miss Mirror was looking at the ring Han Sen
wore, and her request came with the glimmer of hesitation.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen wasn’t a bad fighter, he was too low level.
Miss Mirror didn’t think Han Sen, with his current power, could be
of much assistance to her. But since she was there, she knew it
would be a good idea to get to know him a little better.</p>
<p>The mind and the heart were inseparably linked, so the best way
to learn someone’s personality was through their mind. It was a
very accurate way of reading people.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Han Sen asked as he extended his right
hand in front of Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>“Are you playing dumb?” Miss Mirror stared at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Of course not. You should have just told me more clearly.” Han
Sen laughed and pulled back his right hand. He extended his left
hand instead, the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring glinting on one of his
fingers.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror observed the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring, and a lump rose
in her throat. Seeing the ring made her mind harken back to the man
who had once worn it. That man had been smart and gentle.</p>
<p>Even now, thinking of that man made her heart leap.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror never regretted marrying that man. Choosing him had
been the most precious experience in her entire life, but God
hadn’t allowed her to be by his side forever.</p>
<p>Thinking of that man would have made any woman’s heart jump, and
then seeing the current master of the ring, Miss Mirror could only
sigh.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was good, compared to that man, she thought he
couldn’t begin to compare.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror reached out her hand and put her Mirror Spirit Eye
Ring next to Han Sen’s ring.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s face didn’t possess supermodel-like beauty. She
wasn’t as hot as someone like Gu Qingcheng, certainly. She was more
like a well-dressed and mature lady.</p>
<p>But Miss Mirror’s hands were too pretty to criticize. Every
finger was long and slender. Her skin was white like jade, and her
nails glittered like crystals.</p>
<p>Her hands were lovely and elegant. Han Sen had seen many pretty
women in his time, but this was the first time he had ever seen
such beautiful hands.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s hand came closer to Han Sen, and the Mirror Spirit
Eye Ring reacted. The emerald ring began to glow.</p>
<p>When those two eye-like gems touched each other, Han Sen and
Miss Mirror both shivered. They felt a strange power generate in
the Mirror Spirit Eye Rings, and then the power went into both of
their bodies. The energy traveled up their arms and straight into
their brains.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body vibrated. He looked around, finding himself in a
place where it was raining. The springtime rain was falling as if
God himself was crying.</p>
<p>But when those tears fell, they watered everything around him.
The trees, the flowers, the grass, the chestnuts. The rain soaked
into all of them, and the sadness held within the rain provided a
source of infinite lifeforce and hope.</p>
<p>Han Sen had studied the forty-eight water minds of Destiny’s
Tower, and the spring rain mind was one of them. Miss Mirror’s mind
was spring rain, but it wasn’t focused on the rain itself.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt the way her emotions shifted and swayed within her
mind. Suddenly, he really admired this woman. This mind was
professional and enduring. It was like the strongest a deified
being could achieve.</p>
<p>“No wonder her organization is called Spring Rain. This mind can
only be felt. It isn’t something that could be explained. Achieving
this sort of mind is very difficult. Miss Mirror is a very
complicated and even contradictory woman. I cannot judge her as I
normally would another.” As Han Sen observed and sensed the spring
rain mind, he learned much from it.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s body shivered, too. She felt a mind inside her
consciousness.</p>
<p>But that mind wasn’t too strong or surprising. It didn’t impress
her much.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t take Han Sen’s mind seriously, as she had
only touched their rings together so she could learn more about
him. But when the presence of his mind began to expand, Miss Mirror
was stunned.</p>
<p>What Miss Mirror saw, in terms of Han Sen’s mind, was something
akin to a flower ready to open. The mere bud might not have been
very impressive, but as she tried to understand, she peeled away
the petals. But try as she might, she couldn’t peel them all away.
She couldn’t get to the center of the flower, and that disturbed
her.</p>
