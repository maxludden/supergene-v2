<p>Brother Three was confused. He did not know why Sky King had
disembarked. There were no big characters around him to interact
with either.</p>
<p>Brother Three quickly noticed that after emerging from the
carriage, Sky King was walking toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Sky King must have recognized Han Sen. He is going to teach him
a lesson!” Brother Three coldly laughed. “Bald Guy wanting to be
friends with Han Sen is like having a death wish.”</p>
<p>While everyone was watching, Sky King walked before Han Sen.</p>
<p>Bald Guy was not looking too good. He was a bit worried. His
line of thinking was not too far off from Brother Three. He thought
Sky King had come looking for some trouble with Han Sen.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu thought the same thing too, but she was rather
excited. If Sky King did something to Han Sen, she could see what
Han Sen’s power was really like.</p>
<p>No one would have imagined that Sky King was going to walk in
front of Han Sen and smile. He looked like a pleasant old man. He
said hello to Han Sen and Bao’er in his arms. “Little Girl, do you
remember me?”</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. They did not expect Sky King to talk to
the little girl in Han Sen’s arms.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Do I know you?” Bao’er’s answer made Mister Wei
and his students look on strangely. Sky King’s expression had yet
to change. He smiled at her and asked, “Little Girl, have you
forgot? I gave you a beautiful pendant.”</p>
<p>“Ah! It is you, the very nice guy.” Bao’er now understood. She
pulled out the Sky Order from out of her clothes.</p>
<p>When everyone saw the jade pendant, they were shocked. They
witnessed this happening with looks of sheer disbelief. Not even
Bald Guy believed it.</p>
<p>That was the Sky Order. Besides how much it cost, it represented
Sky King. It was a priceless treasure.</p>
<p>It was hard to imagine Sky King had given Sky Order out to
others, especially a girl who was only four or five years old.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Who is this little girl? Why would Sky King
give her his Sky Order? Is she royalty? Is she a child of some
noble?” Brother Three had many questions he wished to ask.</p>
<p>Sky King’s subsequent actions made Brother Three and the others
even more confused.</p>
<p>Sky King’s face was still lit up with the brightest of smiles as
he greeted Han Sen. “Brother Han, I really like your daughter. I
want to take her as a student. What do you think about that,
Brother Han?”</p>
<p>After he said that, everyone was in shock. They only now learned
that the little girl was Han Sen’s daughter, and Sky King wanted to
take her as a student. That was way too shocking.</p>
<p>They did not think big characters like Sky King would randomly
take a student. Plus, she was Han Sen’s daughter. That reminded
them of many more things.</p>
<p>“Does this mean Sky King is trying to be friends with Han Sen?
What does that mean if he is? Does that mean Sky King is going to
be friends with the crown prince?” Everyone had these complicated
thoughts running through their minds.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “Although I am Bao’er’s father,
accepting a teacher is dependent on Bao’er.”</p>
<p>Before Sky King said anything, Bao’er rejected him and said, “I
don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Sky King was not mad, and he continued to smile as he replied,
“Why? If you are willing to accept me as a teacher, there will be a
lot of good stuff to eat and a lot of fun things to play with.
There will be endless gifts for you.”</p>
<p>“You are too weak,” Bao’er said with honesty.</p>
<p>Those words, in the ears of others, had them believe Bao’er was
ignorant.</p>
<p>This was Sky King, who was an Annihilation God Spirit
Blood-Pulse inheritor. Out of all the Qin Kingdom’s gods, there
were only four Annihilation God Spirits.</p>
<p>People were happy to admit Sky King was one of the Qin Kingdom’s
top five elites. Yet, the little girl had called him weak. They
thought they were ignorant people who did not know much.</p>
<p>“I want to see what Han Sen is going to do.” Brother Three
coldly laughed.</p>
<p>Bald Guy was worried about Han Sen. He tried to remind Han Sen
who he was dealing with through a glare in his eyes. He wanted to
quickly go against what Bao’er said.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, but you heard it from her, Mister.” Han Sen finally
said something, but what he said only made the faces of others look
stranger. They could not understand why Han Sen was not willing to
accept Sky King accepting his daughter as a student.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing about all of this was that the father
and the daughter were being treated like this by Sky King, but he
was not angered. He continued to smile and said, “That is fine. If
Bao’er does not want to, then that is fine. Are you guys going to
the Bee Planet to dig up a land pulse? Why don’t you all hop in the
carriage with us? We can all go together. It will get our work done
faster.” “We have so many people here,” Han Sen said. “Is that
appropriate?”.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. The more the merrier. I’d like to talk to Bao’er
anyway.” Sky King looked like some sort of kind elder.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not decline the offer. He led Bald Guy and the
others into Sky King’s carriage.</p>
<p>Brother Three and the others were frozen as they watched Bald
Guy, Han Sen, and the others all climb into Sky King’s carriage.
They could not accept the fact that this was happening. Sky King
was inviting Han Sen and the others inside. Even the people around
Han Sen were permitted into the carriage. Not even royals received
that sort of treatment.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Brother Three gnashed his teeth. He
disdainfully watched Bald Guy entering the carriage. He did not
understand.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Brother Three who was unable to understand. Even
Li Bing Yu did not understand.</p>
<p>She understood the Qin Kingdom had conflicts. Han Sen was the
crown prince Qin Bai’s friend. He was technically in the Qin Bai’s
faction. That was royalty. Sky King, however, was one of the kings
with a different surname. He was considered a noble. If Sky King
was willing to treat Crown Prince Qin Bai like that, no one would
have been surprised.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was regarded as a pet of the crown prince. He was
considered a traitor. Saying it straight, they compared Han Sen to
the crown prince’s dog. They could not comprehend Sky King’s
willingness to treat him that way. No one understood, but Sky King
understood a lot.</p>
<p>Although Bao’er and Han Sen had scammed him of his items, they
had technically managed to save his life. If Sky King ever had to
battle Han Sen, he would be the one dying.</p>
<p>“This father and daughter are special.” Sky King looked at
Bao’er as she held the white jade flying fish. He did not believe
this was just a coincidence. Brother Three thought it was glorious
for them to be permitted to follow Sky King’s carriage. Now, his
thoughts were on a different matter. Bald Guy was a special guest
of Sky King himself. He was happily sitting inside the carriage.
Because Brother Three could only follow the carriage, he felt
terrible. It was like a thousand eyes were on him laughing. He felt
grossly uncomfortable. Sky King’s carriage was very beautiful and
extremely comfortable. It was like a luxurious battleship with lots
of space.</p>
<p>“Master,” Bald Guy saw Mister Wei and bowed.</p>
<p>Mister Wei was surprised to see Bald Guy there. He then saw Han
Sen and Sky King pleasantly talking and merrily smiling as they
entered. His face looked even weirder.</p>
<p>He knew Sky King went out to greet a friend, but he never
expected it to be Han Sen. And it was not just Han Sen being
invited inside the carriage. Even the people next to Han Sen were
invited in by Sky King. Mister Wei understood Sky King, so he was
more surprised than anyone else. He knew Sky King took the carriage
very seriously. Normal people were never allowed to climb on board.
Even if other kings were there, they could only ride their own
vehicles. Friends and family had to wait outside the carriage.</p>
