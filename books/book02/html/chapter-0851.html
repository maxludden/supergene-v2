    <p>
      By this point, Han Sen was very weak. But so too were the three super
      creatures, who were now robbed of the protection that the now-slain Holy
      Lightshield Bug had given them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was prepared to allow Little Angel to slay the rest before they
      left, but a horrible roaring soon sounded. And when he heard it, he sensed
      the foreboding dread he felt when he first encountered the Devil-Blood
      King. It must have respawned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without hesitation, Han Sen ran out of the shelter under the protection of
      Little Angel. He brought with him the body of the holy bug and the Life
      Geno Essence of the witch.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King was strangely powerful. Han Sen had barely succeeded
      with his assassination attempt, and he didn&#8217;t fancy his chances if
      he were to fight against him head-to-head. Factoring in his current
      exhaustion, he thought it best to get out while the getting was good.
    </p>

    <p>
      After leaving the shelter, he met up with Moment Queen. Wang
      Yuhang&#8217;s clothing was tattered and severely bloodied. Still, he
      gleefully ran up to Han Sen and excitedly asked, &#8220;Tell me, bossman:
      What was your final tally, in your rabid slaying of super creatures on
      this day? How many beast souls have you amassed?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I killed two super creatures and I didn&#8217;t receive any beast
      souls.&#8221; Han Sen shook his head.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was severely disappointed upon hearing about the lack of beast
      souls. &#8220;The lint that has accumulated in my coinpurse is not
      sufficient for the purchasing of another high-class Angel Gene Fluid, you
      know.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      In response, Han Sen said, &#8220;Little Uncle, I managed to obtain two
      Life Geno Essences. One of them is yours. How about I provide you with a
      high-class Angel Gene Fluid in exchange for your Life Geno Essence? That
      way, I&#8217;ll have both.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I accept.&#8221; Wang Yuhang agreed without hesitation.</p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang previously had two Life Geno Essences, but he believed it was
      better for him to have the Angel Gene Fluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Angel Gene Fluid, they could continue killing super creatures and
      hold out for the prospect of better rewards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen handed the Angel Gene Fluid he owned over to Wang Yuhang, and then
      came into possession of two second generation Life Geno Essences.
    </p>

    <p>
      He fed the holy bug&#8217;s body to the Spirit Owl and Death Knell, in the
      hopes they would soon evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, these pets did not disappoint Han Sen. After eating the body,
      they both began evolving, and their battle modes activated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, Han Sen merely hoped they would finish their evolution process before
      the golden chests matured. If the stars aligned for this, Han Sen had
      confidence in his ability to protect the tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Searching for a safe place, Han Sen refined the two Life Geno Essences
      inside him. This time, he managed to gain fifteen super geno points, all
      in all. His total tally reached seventy-eight now.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen snuck away to do this, he could hear Wang Yuhang screaming in
      agony over the shocking healing he had to accept from the silver fox.
      After what he witnessed last time, the last thing Han Sen wanted was to be
      healed by the silver blighter, so he always made sure to heal himself with
      his holy light after a battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they had both recovered from their weakness and exhaustion, they
      returned to the shelter, wondering if they would have the chance to kill
      another super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this time, no matter which way Wang Yuhang attempted to attract the
      residents of that shelter, they would not come out. After what had
      happened, the super creatures did not dare leave, and so Han Sen and Wang
      Yuhang had no choice but to exit the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Devil-Blood King has fourteen super creatures left. We most
      certainly can&#8217;t draw them all out, but if he wants to try to steal
      the golden chest fruit, he&#8217;ll definitely have to leave a number of
      them behind. If so, I really do think I have a chance.&#8221; Back at
      Moment Shelter, Han Sen found himself in deep contemplation over the
      trials to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, might you tell me which class this shelter of yours
      is?&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked, his eyes glistening with awe as they scanned
      the surroundings. He was curious about everything.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a king-class shelter, the first one ever gained for
      humankind,&#8221; Han Sen said, with a cocky look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;'Tis a shame, though; I must regretfully confess. Without people to
      populate its cobbled roads and luxurious palaces, a remote shelter such as
      this is useless,&#8221; Wang Yuhang said, upon hearing Han Sen&#8217;s
      boast.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you think I need others?&#8221; Han Sen laughed, as he looked at
      silver fox and the rest of his pets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang eyed Big Black and Little Black, and his heart sank. He said,
      &#8220;Why do these super creatures follow you around and follow your
      commands? I am wealthier, smarter, and by all accounts more handsome than
      you. So, tell me, why are no super creatures inclined to accompany
      me?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It is because I am luckier than you.&#8221; Han Sen laughed.</p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang opened his mouth to speak, but the words never came. Instead,
      he just gritted his teeth and went to inspect the Jade-Gold Tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What do you suspect will reside inside the golden chests?&#8221;
      Wang Yuhang said, casting a famished gaze at the fruit as saliva drooled
      from his mouth. He could not wait to see what treasure was inside, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who knows? But it&#8217;ll take another two months for it to
      mature. I suppose we&#8217;ll find out then,&#8221; Han Sen said, as he
      looked at the tree. By now, it was three feet tall.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;And you said this little shrub of yours can lure a number of super
      creatures?&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You saw what happened with the Empty Vine, yes? This will be even
      greater, I assure you,&#8221; Han Sen answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You consider this a good thing? Only the ethereal rulers above know
      how many crazed super creatures this thing will have descending upon your
      shelter. The Devil-Blood King and his zealous lot were difficult
      enough!&#8221; Wang Yuhang frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew he&#8217;d have great trouble if the Spirit Owl and Death
      Knell didn&#8217;t finish evolving, but if they were active and ready to
      fight by the time that day came, he fancied his chances in repelling an
      invasion. Still, if he couldn&#8217;t, he wagered he could simply steal as
      much fruit as he could before fleeing the zone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Wang Yuhang both resided in Moment Shelter for the time that
      remained, but they also returned to the Alliance on occasion. They had to
      prepare in anticipation of giving the defense of the tree their all.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few days later, the Purple Mountain below Moment Shelter developed a new
      spring. The spring didn&#8217;t flow with water, however. It ran with
      blood. And it wasn&#8217;t only one spring, either. All across the
      mountain, springs popped up; it was as if the very mountain itself was
      bleeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen went to find out what was going on and examined the blood-red
      water that came out of the earth. He noted that it smelled like actual
      blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, I think a blood spring is a bad omen,&#8221; Wang Yuhang
      said, as he looked at the blood spring alongside Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, if I feared bad omens and rotten luck, I
      wouldn&#8217;t be standing here with you today.&#8221; While Han Sen said
      this, he used his dongxuan aura to scan the blood spring and see what he
      could learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not learn anything, strangely. Nothing organic resided within the
      blood springs, and there was not a single lifeforce to be found.
    </p>

    <p>
      After finding them all, Han Sen counted a total of seven springs.The blood
      springs only lasted seven days, and after that, they all ran dry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The day after the blood springs stopped, menacing clouds formed to conquer
      the skies. For hundreds of miles around, the clouds roofed the lands
      encompassing Moment Shelter. A thunderstorm raged for an entire day. And
      for all those miles around, all the plants were destroyed and burnt to
      ash. Only the peak of the mountain was okay, save for the suffocating
      smoke that tainted the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a day of thunderstorms, it began to rain. The rain was torrential
      and blood-red, too. Countless streams of blood formed at the coming of
      this rain, and it set the scene as a moody and foreboding one. It was
      quite terrifying.
