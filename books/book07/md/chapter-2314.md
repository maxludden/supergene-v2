  The stone dragon dove toward the blue metal wolf’s head, but Han Sen steadied his weapons and remained motionless.

Even a skinny camel was still bigger than a horse. So, while the blue metal wolf had sustained terrible injuries, it still had plenty of strength. It wouldn’t go down quickly. Therefore, Han Sen planned to let the stone dragon and the metal wolf duke it out for a while before initiating a strike of his own.

The stone dragon landed. Its area-of-effect covered the blue metal wolf, and stone markings appeared across the wolf’s body.

The stone dragon apparently had a petrifying ability, and judging by its effects, the skill was far stronger than the stone cow’s petrification.

The blue metal wolf hadn’t reacted to Han Sen’s petrifying shockwave, but the stone dragon’s attack had scrawled stony markings across the wolf’s body. The attack also seemed to sink deeper into the wolf’s wounds, as stone started to build up and solidify around the creature’s injuries.

The stone dragon’s talons reached out to seize the wolf’s neck.

The blue metal wolf had been keeping its head low. It didn’t use a King class area-of-effect of its own, but when the stone dragon’s talons closed in, the wolf raised its head.

The stone dragon’s talons slammed into the wolf’s face, but the blue metal creature had no reaction. The dragon’s talons were unable to pierce the wolf’s skin.

Katcha! The blue metal wolf bit into the stone dragon’s wings with enough force to rip them right off.

Han Sen watched in shock as the stone dragon screamed. The blue metal wolf didn’t make a sound; it simply went wild with its claws and fangs. A moment later, the King class stone dragon was torn open by the blue metal wolf. King class blood sprayed everywhere.

Once the stone dragon was ripped open, the blue metal wolf stopped and its stone markings faded. The powers of the stone dragon no longer seemed to have an effect on the wolf.

The metal wolf tore further into the dragon’s body, finding and ripping out the dragon’s petrifying spine. Han Sen figured it was the dragon’s xenogeneic gene. The beast chewed it a little, then swallowed it with a single gulp. Without sparing the body of the stone dragon a second glance, the wolf walked away.

Han Sen was stunned. The blue metal wolf hadn’t even used a King class area-of-effect, and it had still slain the King class stone dragon with ease. The strength it possessed was both terrifying and disconcerting.

Han Sen had initially wanted to take advantage of the wolf’s injured state, but after seeing the ferocity of the beast, he gave up on the idea.

“This guy must be a mutant King class xenogeneic,” Han Sen thought.

But Han Sen didn’t understand. The blue metal wolf was very strong, and it had displayed its strength during its brief battle with the stone dragon.

The King class stone dragon had been unable to puncture the metal body of the wolf. And after being petrified, the wolf had been able to recover. That meant it possessed impressive healing powers.

That was a scary xenogeneic by any metric. It had wounds that it couldn’t heal, though. It continued to bleed, which made Han Sen wonder how it had ended up in such a state.

According to the information he was able to gather on Knight’s Paradise, deified creatures did exist there. But it was unheard of for them to reside on Planet King Kong.

“Is Planet King Kong home to deified xenogeneics that have yet to be discovered?” Han Sen was shocked. He could probably handle himself against King class xenogeneics, but it would be impossible for him to go up against a deified being.

Seeing the blue metal wolf proceed to travel deeper into the desert, Han Sen hesitated for a moment. Ultimately, he decided to follow the blue metal wolf. He wanted to see where the wolf was going.

Han Sen thought that if the blue metal wolf was truly dying, he might still have a chance to claim its spoils once it gave up the ghost.

The blue metal wolf kept walking through the desert. It moved slowly despite its strength, which was something that Han Sen wouldn’t underestimate now that he had seen the beast in action. If it wanted to move faster, it certainly could.

Wherever the blue metal wolf went, every xenogeneic other than the stoneflies fled. Nothing wanted to be anywhere near the giant wolf.

The stoneflies stayed close, however. They gathered near the blue metal wolf and swarmed it, covering its wounds and drinking its blood.

The blue metal wolf didn’t plan on killing them. It continued on its way, proceeding deep into the far reaches of the desert.

Han Sen followed it for seventy-to-eighty universal hours. Eventually, the blue metal wolf came to a stop.

The valley in front of them was grand but also in disarray, and no water coursed through its stone. Instead, a flow of lava coursed through the valley. The blue metal wolf observed the stream of lava for a moment, then leaped right into the lava.

Splash!

The blue metal wolf jumped into the lava, sending out waves that were dozens of meters high. The lava splashed across the shores of the stream, and it released plumes of black smoke and fire as it landed.

Han Sen flew slowly around the large valley. After the blue metal wolf jumped into the lava, it quickly disappeared. It was as if the beast had drowned, for he could no longer see it.

“Weird. The blue metal wolf didn’t look like it was attuned to the element of fire. There is no way that the lava is his natural home. But if not, then what would bring him here? Perhaps the creature really did think that it was dying, so it wanted to end things here by jumping into the lava to prevent others from eating its remains? That can’t be right. There must be xenogeneics in the lava. The wolf can’t keep its body in the lava forever…” Han Sen thought this was very weird.

Han Sen looked around, and he eventually saw that the lava was home to stony-looking snakes. They didn’t go close to where the blue metal wolf had jumped in, though.

This didn’t really have anything to do with Han Sen, but he was simply curious. His desire to figure out what was going on was like an itch that he couldn’t scratch. He didn’t want to just leave.

Han Sen killed a xenogeneic nearby while waiting for the blue metal wolf to re-emerge. He didn’t stray too far from where the wolf had disappeared.

Almost four days went by, and the lava stream stayed quiet. It made Han Sen feel depressed.

Han Sen wanted to dive into the lava and take a closer look, but he couldn’t make up his mind.

Many xenogeneics lived in that land of lava, but none of them dared to go to that one specific area. Perhaps they were scared of the blue metal wolf, or maybe something even stranger was down there.

“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Rock Snake: xenogeneic gene found.”

Han Sen killed a Rock Snake, as there weren’t many other xenogeneics around. This was the last xenogeneic he could find to kill, and it was only a Marquise.

Han Sen gritted his teeth and went back to the zone of lava. He surmised that waiting there was a waste of time, so he now had to choose between two options. He could leave that place and continue hunting, or he could enter the lava and take a look.

Because of his curiosity, Han Sen went with the second option. He donned his Galactic Lobster Armor and activated his Dongxuan Aura, then dunked his head into the lava.
