<h2>Blessing Barr</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2559</h3>

<p>“Can we start the blessing process now?” Barr was standing atop
the big pile of King class xenogeneic genes as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Sure. Hang on a second. It will begin shortly. Let me just move
these xenogeneic genes into storage first.” Han Sen carted the
xenogeneic genes into his core area hall, then placed them all
inside Destiny’s Tower. Then, he returned to the core area.</p>
<p>“Let’s start now,” Han Sen said as he walked in front of Barr.
Then he asked curiously, “Why do you want me to bless you?”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t quite understand this. He knew that Barr had no
lack of willpower, and it was strange that the man was so desperate
for a blessing all of a sudden. With Barr’s personality being what
it was, it just seemed a bit out of character.</p>
<p>“There is someone I wish to defeat. But if I’m ever to
accomplish that task, I’m going to require a greater amount of
power. I need that strength, and I need it now,” Barr said with
frightening certainty.</p>
<p>“Who is that… um, lucky person?” Han Sen was going to say
“unlucky,” but then switched it to “lucky.” After all, Barr was a
customer. Han Sen knew that being Barr’s enemy was never a good
thing, anyway. In this case, Han Sen thought it was funny. And as
long as Barr wasn’t bothering him, he didn’t care who the unlucky
sod was.</p>
<p>“Dollar,” Barr answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt his eyes bulge upon hearing that. After half a day
of waiting, it was revealed that he himself was the unlucky guy
Barr harbored so much antipathy for.</p>
<p>“Hm, interesting.” Shaking off his momentary pause, Han Sen gave
Barr an uneasy thumbs up.</p>
<p>After everything that had happened, Han Sen couldn’t back out
now. He had already taken the goods, so he had no choice but to go
through with things.</p>
<p>Barr stood tall and straight like a tower, and Han Sen
reluctantly reached out his hands. He placed them on Barr’s
forehead like a priest. He said, “I… Han Sen… by the names of all
the gods… grant you… Barr… an eternal holy power… opening Destiny’s
Door.”</p>
<p>Han Sen made himself sound like a god. The warm light he
unleashed came from his hands. It became a deep red as it shined
down and entered Barr’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen said this, but he was hoping that Barr failed to level
up to become Deified. If this process was successful, then he had
just made a new enemy for himself. An even more formidable one, at
that.</p>
<p>There were many elites who were watching, both in the core area
and the outside universe, and none of them blinked. They intently
watched Han Sen hold Barr’s forehead.</p>
<p>Barr was taller than Han Sen, but as he stood before Han Sen
right now, he looked like some apostle being initiated into
monkhood. He closed his eyes and allowed the blood-like powers to
enter his body.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s self-cogwheel connected with Barr’s
self-cogwheel. When the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s self-cogwheel moved,
Barr’s self-cogwheel started to move as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to see that Barr’s self-cogwheel was black. It
was black like metal. His cogwheel was laden with triangular black
symbols. In the corners, there were faceless heads.</p>
<p>There was nothing distinguishing about the blank faces, but he
could tell that one of them was feminine. He could identify another
as being the face of a man. The third one, however, was different.
Trying to discern it was nearly impossible. It was so blurry that a
gender couldn’t be accurately defined.</p>
<p>“Dia Robber, do you think Han Sen can make Barr deified?” A
deified of the Destroyed, whose name was Arthur, asked Dia
Robber.</p>
<p>“He might not become deified, but I do believe that whatever
happens will be a great boon for Barr,” Dia Robber said.</p>
<p>Arthur frowned and said, “Dia Robber, you’ve spoiled Barr. If
you knew that Han Sen might not make him deified, why did you
borrow him so many xenogeneic genes? If it wasn’t for you, we would
never have approved this trade.”</p>
<p>Dia Robber bowed to Arthur and said, “Mr. Arthur, I lent out the
King xenogeneic genes. It is only a matter of time before we see
the sum returned. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Arthur shook his head. “I’m just saying, you shouldn’t spoil
him. After all, he isn’t a pure Destroyed.”</p>
<p>Dia Robber laughed and said, “Barr may be of impure blood, but
he is very talented. Everyone knows that.”</p>
<p>“His talents are excellent, but due to his blood, his chances of
becoming deified are pretty low,” Arthur said.</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s why I’m helping him. Han Sen might not make him
deified, but this blessing should at least help reinforce his
motley genes. Perhaps this is Barr’s chance,” Dia Robber said
calmly.</p>
<p>“Old Four, what do you think will happen with this blessing?”
The Sixth Uncle was drinking tea as he watched the stream of Han
Sen imparting his blessing upon Barr.</p>
<p>“It is hard to tell,” Meng Lie said quietly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it’s hard to tell? Those two thousand King
xenogeneic genes have likely just been squandered. And for what
purpose? To level up a measly King. The Destroyed are way too
hopeful, placing their faith in some silly myth surrounding that
arrogant boy.” The Sixth Uncle laughed.</p>
<p>Meng Lie didn’t say anything. He merely continued watching Barr
be blessed.</p>
<p>Many people were watching Barr. After Barr’s self-cogwheel was
pushed, it started to spin. The symbols on his self-cogwheel
started to shine.</p>
<p>Barr’s body began to change in a bizarre way. Barr wasn’t a pure
Destroyed. He had three faces, but not three heads. Furthermore,
they were all male. He didn’t have six arms. At first glance, no
one would believe he was considered one of the Destroyed.</p>
<p>But when his self-cogwheel started to spin, his three faces
underwent strange changes. The face in the front started to
disappear, and the left face started to become more masculine,
whereas the right face appeared more feminine.</p>
<p>The left face looked very murderous. It was like the face of a
demon from hell. The right face was very kind. It looked so nice,
and its appearance was somewhat reminiscent of a Buddha.</p>
<p>Only the face in the middle had no defining features.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As this happened, drastic changes rippled through Barr’s body.
His muscles were like gas-filled balloons. They swelled to become
ludicrously large, like he was some living caricature of strength.
And in all honesty, that wasn’t far from the truth.</p>
<p>A scary Destroyed power oozed out of him like black lava. Inside
that burning Destroyed power, Barr’s body melted away. His flesh
came off of him, revealing just his bones.</p>
<p>Those bones were different from ordinary bones. They were black
like steel, and their shape, composition, and arrangement seemed to
resemble something of a human skeleton. The only real, significant
difference was the head. The skull possessed three faces.</p>
<p>The left one looked demonic, whereas the right one looked like a
Buddha. The middle one still didn’t have any discerning features.
It was a blank slate, expressionless and unreadable.</p>
<p>Frightening black Destroyed powers began to sear the man’s
skeleton. Then, as countless elites watched, Barr’s three faces
began to scream.</p>
<p>His left face shrieked like a devil. His right face was
chanting. The middle one with no mouth was making a silent
scream.</p>
<p>With these three cries, Barr’s Destroyed power exploded. His
scary black bones were covered in energy. His Destroyed power
burned like a black sun. This creature no longer bore any
resemblance to the old Barr.</p>
<p>The dark Destroyed power began to get stronger. All of a sudden,
a white dot appeared within the darkness. That white spot was like
a sun, gleaming through the shadows. The black Destroyed power
became white.</p>
<p>“No way.” The Sixth Uncle’s eyes opened wide. In his sheer awe,
he had forgotten all about his cup of tea. His attention was now
fixated on the white dot of Destroyed power.</p>
<p>That white dot was small, but a deified like the Sixth Uncle
could tell it was a substance chain. Only deifieds could possess
substance chains.</p>
