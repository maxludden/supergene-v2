  The candle looked like a ghostly flame rising up. It covered Han Sen’s entire body.

The candle could not burn anything solid, but it could burn souls. No matter how strong the body was, it could not really protect someone’s soul.

Han Sen, however, seemed to be the exception. He had a Super God Spirit mode. His body and soul could not be separated. That was why his soul had not left his body and ascended.

Many people who came from the sanctuaries had Super God Spirit modes, but the Super God Spirit mode itself was different. It had many different elements.

Like Han Sen, his Super God Spirit mode was unique. Even Littleflower and Ling’er, who had his genes, both had different kinds of a Super God Spirit mode. It made their bodies able to become spirits.

Mirror Moon needed spirits. It did not need bodies. That fire was useless for the body. It created a problem for it.

Han Sen’s body and spirit were the same, but Mirror Moon only burned spirits. When the fire wrapped up Han Sen’s body, it had reacted to the candle although it should not have. Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Li watched Han Sen’s body become wreathed in fire. They did not know what to do about the curious thing. They had no clue if Mirror Moon was being cruel or nice to Han Sen. It was a mystery to them. Therefore, it was difficult for them to decide what to do about it.

Zhao Qiu Li looked at Zhao Ning’er. With a face full of concern, she asked, “Is Han Sen going to be OK like that?”

“That half-burned candle came out from Han Sen,” Zhao Ning’er said. “It is an item he owns. I do not think it will harm him. Besides, he is dying. Let’s just see if he can be fixed by this thing or not.” The two of them were frozen as they watched the candle set fire to Han Sen’s severely injured body. The muscles and fat beyond the wounds were being ravaged by the flames of the candle. They were on fire.

Han Sen’s broken and out-of-shape body was hastily burning

“Sister, is this really OK?” Zhao Qiu Li looked at Han Sen’s burning body with a feeling of grand uncertainty.

“Having a reaction is better than him being simply dead,” Zhao Ning’er said.

His body continued to burn. The bones and flesh did not burn very fast. Flesh kept smoldering, releasing a lot of smoke. That was the dirt Mirror Moon was unable to absorb.

Han Sen’s body was not reacting to this. After it was set aflame by the peculiar candle, it started to protect itself. A white color started to spread. It tore through the suppression rules of the universe. Han Sen turned into a Super God Spirit.

The power of the Super God Spirit, combined with the fire of the Mirror Moon candle, did not disable the fire. That was because the body was a spirit now, and it made the ravaging flames worse.

That was not exactly a bad thing. In Super God Spirit mode, Han Sen’s will returned.

Now that Han Sen could see his shape, he was in shock. The way in which his body had been broken was totally obscene. If he was a normal person, he should have died a few hundred times from the wounds he had incurred.

Even a human like him, with a body that had almost reached the highest point of evolution, would never wake up unless they had a Super God Spirit mode.

Only in Super God Spirit mode was he able to just about live.

That was thanks to the Mirror Moon activating his Super God Spirit mode. Had it not done that for him, Han Sen would have been a dead man.

Mirror Moon had given Han Sen another chance to live. It also brought Han Sen another big crisis to overcome. The scary fire kept burning Han Sen’s soul. Even his Super God Spirit mode could not fight things.

“What is Mirror Moon? Even my Super God Spirit mode can burn.” Han Sen was shocked. He knew this was not the time he should spend being curious. He had to find a way to sort out the trouble he was in.

Han Sen feel was happy that under the influence of his Super God Spirit mode, his geno arts could still be used. He quickly used another geno art to douse the flames.

It was a pointless effort though. The fire seemed to be latching on to the Super God Spirit mode. No other type of power could affect the fire. He could only use the Super God Spirit mode to fight back.

“What is this thing?” Han Sen had a grand headache come on.

It would be fine if Super God Spirit mode could restrict the fire, but the Super God Spirit mode was restricted by the fire. If this kept going, Han Sen would burn away into dust. He would not even have a chance to reincarnate.

Han Sen was wreathed by the fire. He kept feeling the pain that was deep in his nerves. He tried every way possible, but nothing would work. The Super God Spirit mode was becoming weaker and weaker.

“What do I do?” Han Sen’s heart cycled through many different ideas, but none of them worked.

“Big sky demon… Where are you?” Han Sen tried to call out for big sky demon. Perhaps the old monster, big sky demon, who had lived for countless years, would know how to deal with Mirror Moon.

Big sky demon did not respond to him. Han Sen did not know big sky demon was still badly wounded. She was living in Han Sen’s dreams. Unless Han Sen went into his dreams, he would be unable to see big sky demon.

Han Sen’s spirit was being burned. It was so painful that it could not be described. Every second was like a century. Han Sen could not endure the pain. He was unable to see a way out of this, and that was driving him insane. “Am I going to die here?” Han Sen thought of Ji Yanran. He thought of his son, Littleflower, and his daughter, Ling’er. He even thought of his mother, Luo Lan, and his dad, Han Yufei. He had many things left unfinished.

No matter how much he did not want to die, he did not have the power to reverse his situation.

To Qin Xiu, Han Sen was just an accident. He was just a guy who could not control the black crystal power and let the black crystal armor let him handle things.

Aside from that, Han Sen was nothing to Qin Xiu.

The humans from the sanctuaries were not created by Qin Xiu. They were products of World King God, who had Qin Xiu’s body and the crystallizers. In the sanctuaries, humans were not pure. He never even cared for the Qin Kingdom’s pure humans, who had Qin Xiu’s blood.

Han Sen was just the product of an accident. He kept on fighting to survive. He tried everything he could to survive.

“What do I do? What else can help me?” Han Sen brought out every item. Every item was the same. They did not work.

Even the demon god sword’s power did nothing to stop the fire.

Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi watched Han Sen throw all of his things out, but none of the items were burned by the fires. Only Han Sen’s body was burning. It was very weird.

It was a shame they still did not know what was going on.

Zhao Ning’er noticed something was wrong, so she asked, “Han Sen, do you need my help?”
