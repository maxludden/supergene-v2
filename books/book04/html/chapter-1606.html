    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Berserk Super Creature Fallen Slaughter Killed. Beast Soul Gained. Geno
        Core Destroyed. Flesh Cannot Be Eaten. Collect the Life Geno Essence to
        Gain One to Ten Super Geno Points Randomly.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      By the time the announcement came to an end, Han Sen had already grabbed
      Fallen Slaughter’s Life Geno Essence. Without slowing down, he kept
      running forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why are there so many stupid people?” Qing Ya sighed. In his hands, he
      held a box. It was the one he had given to Fallen Slaughter. Then, he
      disappeared from atop the peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Han Sen had managed to get a berserk super beast soul and a Life
      Geno Essence, he was still in danger. The scary creatures were still in
      hot pursuit, and because of Fallen Slaughter’s sudden appearance, their
      ire and rage had only been increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, Han Sen was staying ahead of them with the crystal shoe. He
      wasn’t wasting his own strength, so he wasn’t going to get winded by
      simply running. Without the shoe, outrunning his pursuers would have been
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there was nothing else to do while he ran, Han Sen decided to take a
      look inside his Sea of Soul. He wanted to see the specifics of his berserk
      super beast soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallen Slaughter was like a demon inside his Sea of Soul, one with a body
      wholly wrought of metal. When he glanced over the beast soul’s
      information, Han Sen came away delighted.
    </p>
    <div class="tables">
      <table class="beast">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Beast Soul</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Berserk Super Fallen Slaughter</td>
          <td>(Shapeshifting)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- Berserk Super Beast Soul Fallen Slaughter: Transformation-type-->
    </div>
    <p>
      It was a shapeshifting beast soul with a humanoid shape. It meant Han Sen
      could alter his body into something that would allow him to go toe-to-toe
      with berserk super creatures. He could really show the breadth of his
      strength with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that beast soul, Han Sen had gotten much stronger, and he wagered he
      could now fight any rival in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, Han Sen did not dare to stop right now. What happened to Fallen
      Slaughter was a warning to Han Sen, and it showed him how frightening the
      horde behind him really was. Even if he used his new gear and exerted all
      his might, he couldn’t take them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were reasons why no faction was able to construct anything in Wind
      Song Desert or occupy the area. It was strange, given how the individual
      creatures there were all stronger than what you would come across in any
      other shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was unable to take off the crystal shoe, but he thought he could
      try cutting his leg off when he found someplace safe. Someplace safe
      meaning, not anywhere in Wind Song Desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were too many creatures chasing him now. If he stopped for a moment,
      he’d be killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Han Sen calmed down, though, he realized he was now out of the
      desert The environment was a lot more familiar, and he realized it was
      actually a place that he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he saw what he was running toward, his face changed. He was on a
      collision course with Outer Sky Shelter. If the crystal shoe kept him
      going that way, he would practically be feeding himself to Yu Miao.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh no! Even though I have Fallen Slaughter’s beast soul, it would still
      be very hard. Outer Sky Shelter is home to many elites. It doesn’t matter
      how strong I am, I’ll probably end up dead.” Thinking of all the creatures
      in Outer Sky, Han Sen started to think, “Speaking of incredible power, I
      have a lot of creatures behind me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought of what happened to Fallen Slaughter again, and at that
      moment, another thought crossed his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This might be the opportunity I’ve been looking for. If I transform into
      Fallen Slaughter before I get to Outer Sky Shelter, Outer Sky will most
      likely just see the many wretched creatures behind me. They will think I
      am purposely bringing them to attack the shelter. They’ll end up being
      forced to fight the creatures from Wind Song Desert, providing me an
      opportunity to escape”, Han Sen thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he didn’t transform just yet. Transforming into Fallen Slaughter would
      cost a lot of energy. He would only be able to use it for a limited time,
      so he couldn’t waste a single moment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal shoe was still driving him forward without reprieve, and Outer
      Sky Shelter lay directly in front of him. When Han Sen got close to it, he
      immediately summoned Fallen Slaughter beast soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ridiculous strength surged through Han Sen’s body, and his mass expanded.
      He became a four-meter-tall, black metal demon. On his back were demonic
      metal wings. He looked very scary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal shoe on his foot looked a little strange, but compared to his
      Fallen Slaughter body, it was of little distinguishing importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outer Sky Shelter was just like its usual self that day. It stood stoic,
      with an air of mysticism. Countless creatures and spirits were there, all
      resting at the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, they all turned to look in one direction beyond its walls. There
      was a tremor-like shockwave coming for them. Then, they felt an
      immeasurable lifeforce rush toward them like the tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchers on the shelter’s towers and ramparts saw a black body
      approaching quickly. Behind him was an army of hellborn devils, all racing
      forward in madness and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Attack! Many creatures have come to attack the shelter!” A watcher cried
      out the warning, right before ringing the alarm bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells were positioned all across Outer Sky Shelter, and the occupants
      inside were all hastily frightened. They knew what that siren meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelters like Outer Sky were not something many would dare to challenge.
      And those who did decide to fight had to be very powerful themselves.
      Whenever a siege was underway, a horrific battle would soon follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many creatures and spirits were swiftly summoned to defensive positions.
    </p>
    <p>“Who is attacking our shelter?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know. It seems like a bunch of horrible creatures.”</p>
    <p>“Is it Sacred?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t think so. None of them look familiar.”</p>
    <p>
      All the people began to talk about it. Yu Miao was in the line of defense,
      and when she looked over the horde, her face went white. She said,
      “Endless Abyss Master, Fallen Slaughter! And creatures from the Wind Song
      Desert! Why are they here attacking Outer Sky Shelter in unison?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao wasn’t the only person in the shelter who was confused. Outer Sky
      was miles away from the Wind Song Desert, so why would such creatures
      randomly decide to cooperate against them?
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn’t have much time to ponder this conundrum, however, since Han
      Sen had already reached the perimeter of the shelter. He bellowed, “To all
      the scum that populates Outer Sky Shelter… Die!”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Han Sen threw a punch towards a spirit from the Yu family that
      was standing atop a tower.
