<h3>Chapter 2032</h3>

<p>Han Sen dodged. He was like a shadow as he slipped around Dragon Thirteen’s lance. He was even faster than before. “Two Sky Heart Locks?” Dragon Thirteen’s face went slack.</p>

<p>Han Sen was a powerful Earl. It was shocking to learn he was carrying even just one Sky Heart Lock. No one would have ever expected he might be carrying two of them.</p>

<p>If she hadn’t seen this for herself, she wouldn’t have believed it. The idea that an Earl could still fight her adequately while shouldering the burden of two Sky Heart Locks… It was unfathomable.</p>

<p>Now Han Sen felt very light. His body felt great. With every step he took, it seemed like he could shoot into the air like a prancing fairy.</p>

<p>The lance that had once seemed difficult to dodge was now easy to evade. He didn’t feel any of the pressure he had felt earlier.</p>

<p>He didn’t feel as easily tired as earlier, either. He was now active again.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen frowned. Han Sen had unlocked two Sky Heart Locks. She felt as if she was not suppressing him anymore.</p>

<p>The two of them moved fast, as knife airs came against the lance in rapid collisions. Han Sen’s power was a little weaker than hers, but unlike earlier, he could now hold her off.</p>

<p>While Han Sen was fighting Dragon Thirteen, Sharon was still engaged in battle with the silver glass bug. The silver glass bug’s silver shield was powerful. Sharon had delivered a few hundred strikes against it, but it had yet to buckle and break.</p>

<p>Sharon frowned. He wanted to get this fight over with quickly. Dragon Thirteen had been gone for some time, and he couldn’t help but feel as if something was wrong.</p>

<p>His power changed, and a black light began to shine. It gathered up across his scimitar as he slashed the silver glass bug again. The scimitar had done nothing to the silver armor earlier, but under this new attack, a crack was left across the silver surface.</p>

<p>“What powerful armor! It did not shatter, even with my Demon-Dragon Air. This guy’s defense must be the greatest of all Marquises.” Sharon frowned, but his scimitar did not relent. He kept on attacking.</p>

<p>Sharon was part of Demon, but his blood had ties to the Dragon. Aside from the Sky-Demon Sutra, he had also practiced with their Evilbreaker Secret. The Evilbreaker power he possessed was actually stronger than what Dragon Thirteen had.</p>

<p>Even amongst the Demon, it was a secret that Sharon harbored Dragon blood. Sharon wouldn’t use Evilbreaker powers on a whim. Now he was worried enough to use them without a second thought. He just wanted to kill the silver xenogeneic as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>Sharon kept striking the silver glass bug’s shield and making it flash. The armor was wreathed with more and more cracks, and it looked as if it’d break very soon.</p>

<p>The silver glass bug lost its will to fight before long, and it sought to escape. It was unable to, as Sharon pursued it like a ghost. He kept attacking it with his scimitar.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen continued chasing Han Sen, but she felt nervous.</p>

<p>Even though she had the title of bravest, that did not mean the Dragon were the strongest. And she felt as if she could no longer suppress the man who had just broken two Sky Heart Locks.</p>

<p>A cold light glowed within her, and her lance was like a dragon itself. Dragon Thirteen, with the Evilbreaker Lance, was firing on all cylinders. But when the lance pierced through Han Sen’s body, she knew she had failed.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Han Sen’s body exploded like a balloon. It was just a clone. The real Han Sen was twenty meters away, smiling at her.</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen lifted her screw-shaped lance to attack Han Sen again, but Han Sen quietly told her, “If I were you, I would not move.”</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen coldly hmph’d and ignored Han Sen’s warning. She moved forward.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The sound of armor cracking played in Dragon Thirteen’s ears. Her armor was annihilated by the knife silks. But this time, the knife silks were able to cut her skin. Like strands of steel wire, the silks were unbroken.</p>

<p>Han Sen waved his Blood Feather Knife. It looked as if no power was being mustered, but the many invisible strands of silk twisted together to bind Dragon Thirteen’s body. As Han Sen waved the knife, he pulled them in closer.</p>

<p>Countless silk strands tightened around her arms, legs, waist, and head. Dragon Thirteen’s body was tied up, suspending her in the air. Her armor eventually shattered into nothing but pieces.</p>

<p>The knife silks were starting to dig into her skin. Her pale white body was covered in marks of blood, but the blood that came out was in stark contrast to the beauty of her pale white skin.</p>

<p>“D*mn you!” Dragon Thirteen shouted angrily. Evilbreaker powers surged out of her body to destroy the knife silks binding her.</p>

<p>But the moment she got rid of them, more knife silks arose to take their place. They bound her again, and she could no longer draw closer to Han Sen. She hung in place.</p>

<p>“It looks like you have run out of chances. It’s still not too late to beg for your life, as I am willing to spare you.” Han Sen was clutching his Blood Feather Knife, staring at Dragon Thirteen who had been tied up. He said the same thing she did.</p>

<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>

<p>Dragon Thirteen’s Evilbreaker power exploded. It snapped the knife silks, but using her body to break the ties that bound her caused her even greater wounds. She was bleeding profusely from everywhere.</p>

<p>“The body of a Dragon is strong,” Han Sen complimented her.</p>

<p>After Dragon Thirteen escaped from the knife silks, her eyes were burning. With her lance, she again tried to attack Han Sen. But just as she raised it to strike, the knife silks were back to tie her up like a doll again.</p>

<p>Han Sen stood in front of her, but she could not attack. Every time she cut the knife silks, more arose to entangle her. She could not move at all.</p>

<p>“It is time to end this.” Han Sen’s Blood Feather Knife was shrouded in a purple mist. The knife silks had a purple air, too.</p>

<p>Endless numbers of knife silks cut Dragon Thirteen’s flesh. Purple mist seeped into her wounds.</p>

<p>“Teeth power.” Dragon Thirteen looked pale.</p>

<p>Teeth powers dealt more damage than her Evilbreaker powers did. There was no chance for any person to survive, once they were struck by it. And with the countless wounds already across her body, there was no hope of her escaping now.</p>
