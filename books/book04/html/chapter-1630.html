    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      In the swordlight that brought ruin to everything, a golden light suddenly
      cracked the fabric of space. It traveled through the swordlight and
      smacked into Six Paths Sword, then stuck to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone realized that the golden light was actually a coin. It was a
      beautiful coin.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The Six Paths Sword, which had previously been at the center of existence,
      had now been wrecked by that coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power that was going into the sword then started to travel into the
      coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scariest thing about this was the fact that the super elites, who had
      previously been able to stop their energy from leaking, were now unable to
      stop the process. The leaders of Outer Sky and Sacred also suffered under
      the coin. A portion of their energy was being stolen by the coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the power and energy of the Six Paths Sword was being taken by the
      coin. Eventually, the coin was bigger than the sword itself.
    </p>
    <p>Dong!</p>
    <p>
      A crunchy noise sounded, and Six Paths Emperor was no longer able to
      control the sword. He allowed it to fall, and when it came to a stop, it
      stood erect with its tip dug into the ground. Six Paths Emperor was still
      clutching the handle, and it was clear he wished to pull it out of the
      ground but couldn’t The sword actually got heavier and heavier, and as it
      sank into the earth, Six Paths Emperor started to go down with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the beings in the audience were shocked, watching was what was
      happening to the Six Paths Sword. The power Six Paths had gathered was
      nearly godlike, and yet, it had been beaten by what looked like a measly
      coin. His sword could not take the weight
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths, who had now lost the sword, was frozen. That sword was
      something he had never lost before. To him, his life was his sword and his
      sword was his life. Having now lost his sword, he no longer wished to do
      combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Even God is afraid of Collecting Taxes. Collecting Taxes is scary.” Han
      Sen sighed, and then he flicked his finger once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shower of coins began to rain, and they covered the entire arena. They
      landed on Six Paths in frightening numbers, until he was buried beneath a
      mountain of them. A severe weight pressed down on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths didn’t move. All he could do was turn his head to see the coins
      that fell. He looked at Han Sen and smiled. “I lost, The sword is yours.
      There will be no other Six Paths Sword. When you see me again, all you
      will see is Six Paths.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Six Paths Emperor wiggled his fingers; he was disconnecting
      himself from the Six Paths Sword. And when he did that, the sword released
      its power and just fell on the floor. Six Paths Emperor’s mouth bled, but
      he still worked up a smile before leaving. He conceded, leaving behind the
      Six Paths Sword that was on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not feel joyous, though. After that fight, Six Paths had
      decided to abandon his sword. The sword in his heart must have been very
      scary, and if they fought again, victory would be even harder to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen picked up the sword and exited the arena, returning to his
      shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Six Paths had left the stage, but the battle had been
      incredibly exciting. It had shocked the entire Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was half a god, but he had lost to the enigmatic Dollar.
      Everyone was curious about his true identity, and everyone thought Dollar
      would win the entire Divinity’s Bout. He would surpass the ten Son of Gods
      and become the first Son of God.
    </p>
    <p>The media in the Alliance had reported the news, as well.</p>
    <p>
      “Champion’s Return”, “The Dollar Crushes Everything”, “God Versus God”,
      “The Power of Dollar.” All sorts of articles were released after the
      fight. They spoke passionately about the battle and Dollar’s victory
      there.
    </p>
    <p>“Dollar is the best!”</p>
    <p>“He must be able to reach first place.”</p>
    <p>
      “Don’t worry, Dollar will never disappoint us. If he wants to, he’ll
      definitely wind up in first place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fourth God’s Sanctuary’s Divinity’s Bout was something that had little
      to do with the general populace of the Alliance, but it was still a
      popular topic of conversation, nonetheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many people saw the fight, either. And journalists were only able to
      make write-ups through interviews that were held with demigod witnesses.
      It was the only way for them to learn what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to their inability to locate Dollar, the journalists asked the
      demigods that watched the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fang Mingquan’s interview was the most popular, and that was because he
      was famous and knew a lot of people. He had interviewed many demigods in
      the past, and he was a big fan of Dollar. People that liked Dollar would
      often go and read his articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Demigod Tang, what is your opinion of the fight between Dollar and Six
      Paths?” Fang Mingquan interviewed Tang Zhenliu, a person he was quite
      close with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu smiled and said, “Where do I begin? I mean, Six Paths was
      strong, but he just wasn’t on the same level as Dollar. Dollar will be
      able to get to the top ten Son of Gods, for sure, and he might even
      achieve first place.”
    </p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>
      Most demigods that accepted the interview said many similar things. They
      all thought Dollar could reach the top ten, at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were some unpleasant voices amidst the crowds, and some
      whispered Dollar was simply lucky. If he reached the top ten, it’d be
      through good fortune. There were many powerful spirits and creature ahead,
      and with them thinking Dollar was a cocky person, they didn’t think he’d
      reach the top hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were quite a few arguments surrounding this, and the Alliance turned
      its focus to the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elites in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary spent a lot of time researching
      the fight. They were looking for a way they might be able to disarm the
      coin and beat Dollar if he ever came for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, Dollar had become their biggest, number one enemy. He was the
      likeliest candidate to reach the top ten thus far. The people felt very
      lucky when it was confirmed they might not have to face Dollar, but for
      those that had to fight him, they researched and researched. They wanted
      to find a way they might win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t think much about any of this, though. He just retired to
      the practice of Dongxuan Sutra. The Dollar geno core had reached super
      class after the fight, and he was fairly confident he could reach first
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen could get all his geno cores to super, that would be even
      easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the next round started, Han Sen practiced constantly with the
      Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen entered the arena next, it was four days later. He didn’t
      have to fight, though, as every opponent he went up against had to
      concede. No one dared to do combat with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opponents of the next four rounds conceded, and all super elites grew
      fearful of Dollar.
