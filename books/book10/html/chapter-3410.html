<p>“Sure.” Chaos nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Han Sen took Bao’er back with him to Space Garden. He called for
his family to convene. Together with Bao’er, they all had
dinner.</p>
<p>Aside from Littleflower and Ling’er, Tang Ming’er, Zero, Little
Angel, Little Silver, and the others were all there. The whole
family was complete.</p>
<p>Bao’er did not enjoy practicing. She had been trying hard for so
long that she had grown bored of it. Now, she was like a happy girl
again. This was a night that gave her a chance to have fun.</p>
<p>Bao’er and her siblings, the three of them, were playing games.
Han Sen and Ji Yanran sat on the couch watching them. Little Silver
lay across Han Sen’s lap. Its eyes were closed. It allowed Han Sen
to stroke its silver hair. Han Sen wished time could freeze then
and there.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s phone rang. It was displaying Mister White’s number,
so he answered the call.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not help but ask, “Mister White, have you learned
anything on the matter we discussed?”</p>
<p>“It is difficult for me to describe with mere words,” Mister
White said. “If you are free, I suggest you come visit my
place.”</p>
<p>“Sure. I will head over there now.” Han Sen put the phone down.
He had no choice but to send Bao’er back to the sanctuaries. He
then went to the place in Space Garden where Mister White
lived.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw Mister White, he quickly asked, “Mister White,
have you found anything?”</p>
<p>Mister White looked at Han Sen and said, “I have some
predictions, but I am not too sure how accurate they are. I will
have to conduct more tests. Can you use the Dongxuan Sutra
now?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “This is hard for me to say. I cannot use the
Dongxuan Sutra like I used to. When I am in danger and need to use
it, I can use the Dongxuan Aura and feel everything that poses a
threat to me. It not quite like the Dongxuan Aura I used to know.
It is difficult for me to describe.”</p>
<p>Mister White nodded. He suddenly reached his hand out and patted
Han Sen on the chest.</p>
<p>Mister White stood in front of Han Sen, who was not aware of
Mister White’s movement. His hand had suddenly moved. It was like a
phantom ghost hand.</p>
<p>Even if Qin Xiu was there, he might not have been able to avoid
it. Just as Mister White’s hand was going to touch Han Sen, his
body reacted on instinct and moved to avoid Mister White’s incoming
hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not fight back. He did not look alert. He did,
however, give Mister White a questioning look. He did not believe
Mister White wanted to hurt him. He must have had his reasons to do
that.</p>
<p>Mister White looked at Han Sen’s body and said, “I see. Your
body has reached With Light and Dust level.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was confused, which he shared with Mister White via a
look. He asked, “With Light and Dust level? What is that supposed
to mean?”</p>
<p>“I thought you were a student of Xuan Men. Are these simple Xuan
Men words already beyond your understanding? Did you not read the
Xuan Men dictionary I gave you?” Mister White looked like he was
smiling at Han Sen, but he was not smiling.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt embarrassed. “You know I cannot find time to relax
and read. Plus, I have very bad luck. Bad things follow me like a
bad smell. I can never have the time to study literature.”</p>
<p>Mister White laughed and said, “That is certainly nonsense. You
just don’t want to read books. Otherwise, with your evolving speed,
remembering these Xuan Men dictionaries would not be
difficult.”</p>
<p>Han Sen blushed. He felt rather sad by the insinuation and said,
“I am afraid this is useless. The Xuan Men is not really like
mathematics. If I cannot understand the text, remembering it would
be pointless.”</p>
<p>Mister White nodded and said, “You really are not suitable at
learning Xuan Men. If you do not practice Xuan Men but can practice
the Dongxuan Sutra to such a level, it is something I can only
describe as odd. If you have the time, you should explain the
Dongxuan Sutra to Ji Yanran. She is very good with Xuan Men. She
will achieve a lot with the Dongxuan Sutra.”</p>
<p>“If things are indeed that way, then that is great. I will go
and teach her tonight.” Han Sen felt a bit excited. When he started
speaking, his smile started to become bitter.</p>
<p>“You miss the Dongxuan Sutra.” Mister White looked at Han Sen
with a soft smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “Ji Yanran is a wife who has gone
through life-and-death situations with me. It is not just the
Dongxuan Sutra. I am willing to teach her anything and everything I
know. But like you said, Ji Yanran is very good with this stuff.
When she learns the Dongxuan Sutra, she will see through everything
and be more sensitive. That will be very hard for me to live
with.”</p>
<p>“What you are saying makes sense. If the water is too clear,
there can be no fish. If people get too close, there will be a
fissure growing. It is always good to have some space and
distance.” After saying that, Mister White said smiled. “Don’t you
worry. I already told you that your body has already reached the
With Light and Dust level. Even if Ji Yanran practiced the Dongxuan
Sutra to your level, she will still be unable to see through
you.”</p>
<p>“Mister White, was does this With Light and Dust level mean?”
Han Sen quickly asked.</p>
<p>“With means flat,” Mister White explained. “It means to cover.
And means equal, so there are no differences. Mirrors capture dust
and forbid shining. Whoever has the light will one day burn out and
go dark someday. It means to cover yourself with the light. It is
to be like dust. If you do not have light, you will not be
dark.”</p>
<p>After thinking about Mister White’s short speech, Han Sen asked,
“Are you saying to wait for the chance to come and do not reveal
yourself? What does any of that have to do with my body?”</p>
<p>Mister White nodded. “People are aware that swords are sharp,
and they know cannons can be destructive. There are things in this
world that cannot be sorted out by swords and cannons. It is like
when you are thirsty, you require water. When you are hungry, you
require food. Even if you have an indestructible, ultimate sword or
a cannon that can obliterate planets, they are pointless to have in
such situations.”</p>
<p>Han Sen retreated into thought. It looked like he was
understanding something, but he didn’t understand a thing.</p>
<p>Mister White went on to say, “Ordinary creatures evolve along a
path. There is a path of progress that leads them into obtaining
more power. That sort of guided evolution is very limiting. It can
be overbearing in the universe. In another area, such powers can be
useless.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that my body can do anything in this area?” Han
Sen understood what Mister White meant.</p>
<p>“Yes. You are not so stupid after all. Although your
understanding is not very accurate, that’s what it means.” Mister
White smiled.</p>
<p>“Why did I not have any feelings like that? Let’s not just say I
can do anything in any area and at the same time. Why can’t I do
something that my power is capable of achieving?” Han Sen looked at
Mister White with confusion trying to figure out was had happened
to him.</p>
<p>“That is because you have yet to understand your body,” Mister
White seriously said. “The hardest thing to understand in this
world is yourself. Try to understand yourself, and you will make
progress someday.”</p>
