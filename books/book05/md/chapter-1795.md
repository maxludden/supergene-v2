After entering the area with the grapevines, things became much easier for Han Sen.

The fighting skills that the four Chaos employed were rather simple and a little clumsy, but they weren’t weak. One versus one, Han Sen might win. But against four of them at the same time, there was a high chance he could stumble and fall.

Han Sen used all the judgment, prediction, and movement that his skills gave him. He did this so he could fight them more effectively in the grapevine area.

Han Sen kept escaping in the direction that Yisha had fled. But Yisha herself was now headed in the direction Mister Ji had gone, so Han Sen was unable to see her. If she had not been killed, she should still be in the grape area.

Han Sen was still curious about how she had managed to get rid of the Chaos that were chasing her.

The four Chaos ardently pursued Han Sen. He was able to kite and keep them at bay, though, keeping them from dealing any damage to him. In this manner, they went deep into the grapevines.

In the beginning, Han Sen could catch glimpses of Yisha’s trail. But after going this deep, he had lost sight of it.

“What did she do?” Han Sen frowned. He was fighting four Chaos all alone, hoping to find something that could help him out of the bind.

The grapevines there were very big. They were as thick as a man’s leg, and they tangled together like snakes. They webbed and clogged the skies, making it difficult for sunlight to pierce through and illuminate the undergrowth. The whole place was like one labyrinthine cave system.

Han Sen wouldn’t have dared go this deep if he didn’t know there were no xenogeneics there.

Han Sen thought the complicated geography could weaken the resolve of the Chaos. But they seemed to be very familiar with the place, and Han Sen still couldn’t shake them off his tail.

The Dongxuan Armor absorbed the power and strength of the earth, but it was very limited where they were right now. Perhaps it was because of the atmosphere that had been damaged by the two elites so long ago. And consequently, the Baron Dongxuan Armor was suppressed. To make matters worse, without the constant replenishment, the energy he was using was starting to make him feel tired.

When Han Sen wondered whether or not he should risk trying to take a hostage, he suddenly saw something bright. The vines seemed to be opening in front of him, and the sunlight was extra bright there. It was being reflected by something, and Han Sen assumed it might be water.

Han Sen did not know how he had gotten here. He ran forward, and lo and behold, he saw a lake that was skirted by the rest of the oasis’ vines.

A statue stood n the middle of the lake, and surprisingly, Yisha was there.

Yisha was sitting on the shoulder of the statue. She looked surprised when she saw Han Sen emerge from the knot of vines.

But when Han Sen left the vines and approached the shores of the lake, he heard the Chaos make warning sounds. They were warning Han Sen not to venture too close to it.

Han Sen didn’t care for what they thought, though, and he just continued on towards the lake. He jumped to Yisha’s statue.

The statue was sculpted to look like a person. It sort of looked like a human or a crystallizer. There were no butterfly wings, cat ears, or tail of any sort. It was just a three-meter-tall person with clothes on. The lower part of its legs was submerged beneath the surface of the lake.

When Han Sen jumped, the Chaos stopped near the shore. They gave up their chase, and neither did they fire any more arrows.

Han Sen flew to the left shoulder of the statue. Yisha, who was on the right shoulder of the statue, drew out her saw-like knife. She slashed it at Han Sen.

Han Sen had seen many powerful skills, like Falsified-Sky sword skills, but this was scary. There were many swordsmen in the sanctuary, and lots of them were masters. But Han Sen had never seen someone as cruel as she was before. Most sword skills he had seen so far were intended for slashing or stabbing. Sometimes they were fast and powerful.

But Yisha’s skills were weird. It looked like she was slashing and stabbing at the same time, like some toxic snake. Or the fangs of a hungry wolf. She was so fast, Han Sen could not determine the track of her attack.

Han Sen didn’t spare much time thinking this over, though. He used his powers to take to the air like a bird. He tried to dodge Yisha, but he was suppressed and unable to tell where she was attacking from. The suppression slowed him down, and while he did manage to mostly dodge the strike, he was slashed across the arm.

Han Sen did not know what that savage saw-knife was made of, but it cut straight through his armor and sliced him deeply enough to expose his bones.

Luckily, Han Sen’s blood was crystallized. Melting his blood would be difficult under the suppressive atmosphere, so no actual blood seeped through the wound.

Having failed to stop Han Sen, she lifted her weapon to strike again. She was going faster and faster, with more strength in each subsequent lunge. She was like some toxic beast opening its mouth to bite Han Sen.

Han Sen was in the air, flying like a bird. He tried to gain more distance to dodge Yisha’s attacks.

Yisha was still standing on the statue, though. Eventually, she was unable to reach Han Sen. She didn’t chase him, and it seemed as if she only wanted Han Sen off the statue.

But it was apparent by the look on her face that Yisha was surprised. She was stunned that Han Sen had managed to dodge her attack.

Han Sen was in the air, thinking over what had happened.

Yisha was far stronger than he had imagined she would be. Her attacks were almost as good as Han Sen’s. She was definitely a master with the blade.

She deliberately let go of Han Sen and Mister Ji, and it seemed like she had been using them as more than just bait Perhaps she was staying here, not because of the Chaos, but something else. Perhaps she had a plan that involved the lake, the statue, and maybe the entire oasis itself.

Han Sen felt as if he couldn’t use all his strength. If he had enough energy, he could fly freely and not worry about falling. But inside Demon Grave, Han Sen really was weak. Flying like he was, he had already lost much of his power. He wouldn’t last much longer.

Han Sen looked at the lake and noticed how clear the water was. He could see the bottom, of the small lake. The water reflected light very strongly, though. The reflections would hurt your eye.

There were no creatures in the lake, and neither was there anything like seaweed. But even so, with the fact that none of the Chaos would approach, Han Sen did not have a good feeling about the place.

Han Sen gritted his teeth and circled around in the air before trying to return to the statue.
