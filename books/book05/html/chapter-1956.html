<h3>Chapter 1956</h3>

<p>Clearly, the Meka Battle King and Clear Sea King had their
sights on Little Seven. Han Sen was wondering if he should back out
now, but as he was considering his options, a few people came out
of the house. It was Speechless and the other Buddhas.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not see Clear Sea King; it was just the young Buddha
men and women. Han Sen’s heart jumped.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed them and turned on his Dongxuan Aura. He didn’t
put a lot of effort into hiding himself, as Speechless and the
others didn’t seem to be too paranoid. They were just walking
around and chatting casually amongst each other, not suspecting
they were being followed.</p>
<p>But Han Sen followed them for half a day without learning a
single useful nugget of information. Their chatter was standard
fare. Just as he was going to give it up, though, a Buddha man
said, “What is the master thinking? Why would he swap Galaxy Sand
for those Meka babies?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised by this. He had heard of Galaxy Sand
before. It was a famous treasure belonging to the Buddha,
primarily.</p>
<p>Galaxy Sand was not really sand. They were the tears of a King
class xenogeneic called Galaxy Dragon. Each teardrop would become
Galaxy Sand, and it was a rare treasure.</p>
<p>Galaxy Sand possessed an impressive amount of energy. King class
creatures that refined Galaxy Sand received many benefits. Low
level creatures that used it would level straight immediately.</p>
<p>Clear Sea King was swapping it for Meka babies. It was a lot to
give up, so he must have been doing it for something even
bigger.</p>
<p>“Shush.” Another of the Buddha’s stopped him from talking. He
then lowered his voice and said, “Don’t talk about it. This is
where the Meka live; we cannot let them know about the trade.”</p>
<p>“What are we afraid of? This is the Battle King’s territory, and
he is the one selling us the goods. What can they say about it?”
The Buddha lifted his lips, but he didn’t look like he was going to
push the topic too much further.</p>
<p>Speechless Lady frowned and said, “Just be careful. Let’s stop
talking.”</p>
<p>Speechless and the others walked around, and then they headed
back to Battle King’s house. Han Sen thought he wouldn’t learn
anything more useful than that, but Speechless received a message.
Then, she told the other Buddhas, “Buddha King has asked me to
return. You guys go ahead, and I’ll go find out what’s going
on.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go with you?” a Buddha said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.” Speechless shook her head and then left.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed her. He could not fight Clear Sea King, but
Speechless was just a Viscount. If he had to, he could take
her.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned to capture her and ask her why Clear Sea King
was snapping up the Meka babies.</p>
<p>Speechless walked alone as she headed towards Battle King’s
house. When she turned one particular corner, however, she frowned.
A man that looked like a Buddha, wearing gold armor, appeared in
front of her. Something seemed odd about him, but she couldn’t
quite tell what.</p>
<p>“I am Speechless, the Buddha Lady of the Buddha. Who are you?
And why are you blocking my way?” Speechless Buddha Lady was being
careful, and she watched the man closely as she spoke.</p>
<p>She recognized Han Sen’s armor. It was the man who owned Little
Seven.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say a word, and he simply threw his hand forward
to grab her.</p>
<p>Speechless Lady saw the hand get bigger in her vision. It was
like it was consuming the entirety of space. It felt as if she had
nowhere to run, and it was now she realized she had bumped into an
elite.</p>
<p>Speechless’s Buddha Light burst out. She summoned a Buddha
sword. When it came to strike Han Sen, she spoke the Buddha
catchphrase.</p>
<p>The distance to the Battle King’s house was two kilometers, so
her cries would reach Clear Sea King. With his power, he could
definitely come and save her.</p>
<p>But when she opened her mouth, she unleashed a power minus its
sound. It was like an empty sonic blast.</p>
<p>Speechless’ face changed. Before she could react, Han Sen had
grabbed her Buddha sword. Then, he used his finger to fire a coin.
It landed on her chest.</p>
<p>Speechless suddenly felt so heavy. She ended up dropping to her
knees on the ground. She braced herself with her hands, though, so
she wasn’t completely flattened out.</p>
<p>Han Sen laid the Buddha sword across Speechless’s neck, coldly
telling her, “I will ask, and you will answer. If you don’t, I will
cut your head off.”</p>
<p>Speechless was putting all her strength into keeping herself
from collapsing. The scary power from the coin made it feel as if
her chest was going to explode. Pain radiated across her torso.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Don’t you know my Clear Sea King and the Meka’s
Battle King are nearby? If you kill me, you’ll be joining me soon,”
Speechless said, as if she was holding the ground at bay.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’ll be dead, but you will be for sure. That
is, if you refuse to answer my questions. Why are you buying up the
Meka?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Speechless didn’t answer, and it seemed as if it was a secret
she willing to take to the grave.</p>
<p>Han Sen swung the Buddha sword and cut open her armor. Her skin
was revealed.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Speechless’ face changed.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’m not interested in women like you. If you don’t
answer me, though, I will strip you completely. And you can prance
on down the street naked, so everyone can see you clearly. Only
after will I cut your head off.”</p>
<p>Han Sen then went on to say, “I am an impatient man, though, so
I will ask you one more time. Why are you buying the Meka?”</p>
<p>Speechless’ face remained unchanged. When she didn’t say, Han
Sen cut the lower part of her armor off. He grabbed her by the
scalp and started to drag her.</p>
<p>“We are buying the Meka to fix a deified weapon!” Speechless was
shocked. She couldn’t think anymore.</p>
<p>“What deified weapon? And how does it get fixed?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know! I have only heard a bit about it, but I know it’s
a knife. Only Clear Sea King knows the specifics,” Speechless
quickly said.</p>
<p>“Ugh, you don’t know anything. Why would I need you?” Han Sen
looked at Speechless without sympathy.</p>
<p>“If you let me go, I will tell you anything you wish to know! If
you let me go and gather the information, I will surely not
disappoint you!” Speechless said.</p>
<p>“I am giving you one last chance. If you still can’t answer for
me right here, enjoy performing on the streets,” Han Sen answered,
ignoring her plea. “Where is the Galaxy Sand you have stored to
purchase the Meka? Don’t tell me it’s in Clear Sea King’s
pockets!”</p>
<p>“But it really is with him…” Before Speechless finished, Han Sen
grabbed her head again and dragged her across the street.
Speechless* face changed and she shouted, “It really is on him! But
I have a way to get it for you.”</p>
