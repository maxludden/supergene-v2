  “Killed Break World beast: Gold Wing Big Bird. Found Break World gene.”

In Dust Sky, without their powers to boost them, lives were very weak. The Gold Wing Big Bird had its neck broken, and that was enough for it to die.

If they had fought outside, even cutting the creature in half would not have worked to slay the beast.

Han Sen turned to lie on the ground. His body was very tired after the brawl. In a place like Dust Sky, he felt as if he had gone to high land. He felt like a commoner, unable to adjust to the air. He felt tired.

After resting for a while, Han Sen started to pick up the body of the Gold Wing Big Bird. He dug into its body and pulled out the Break World gene.

It was a tear-shaped, gold crystal. It looked beautiful. Han Sen did not hesitate. He swallowed the Break World gene. He suddenly felt an amazing power surge through his body. It wiped away his tiredness. His body felt alive and vibrant again.

“Break World genes plus 10.”

An announcement sounded in his brain. The Gold Wing Big Bird was special. It had given him ten break world genes.

He chopped some wood out and cut the thighs of the Gold Wing Big Bird. He cleaned it and cooked it. The flesh would not give him Break World genes, but it still tasted good. The Gold Wing Big Bird was a Break World beast with a high Break World rate. It was more of a benefit than ever.

Fortunately, this was Dusk Sky. Otherwise, cooking the meat of the Gold Wing Big Bird would have been difficult. Being there made Han Sen realize that his life was a brittle thing.

“How can this body leave Dust Sky? To stay here, Bury Path God is sure to find me. If that happens, I am definitely going to be killed.” Han Sen looked into the campfire and thought things over.

After a while, Han Sen raised his head. He wanted to see if the Gold Wing Big Bird’s leg was cooked. He needed to see if he needed to turn it over and cook it some more.

When he had a look, he froze.

The fire he had been cooking with had no food cooking. All he seemed to be cooking was a bone. Only a few scraps of meat remained to the bone, which stopped it from falling.

Han Sen felt a chill. It was so close to him, yet something had quietly eaten the thigh meat he had been cooking. If that thing wanted to eat his neck, Han Sen did not know what might happen.

Han Sen looked around. He did not see any creatures around. There was nothing but pitch-black darkness all around the dark forest he was in. Han Sen was just a commoner now, so he could not see too far. He could not discern what was lurking in the woods.

He gnashed his teeth and chopped the next thigh off the other wing of the Gold Wing Big Bird. He placed it above the fire and resumed cooking. The forest around that place was dangerous, so venturing into it was ill-advised. He wanted to put more meat on the fire to see if he could draw the creature out. If he did that and snared it, it would increase his chances of winning a fight.

Fighting enemies was better than fighting sneaky enemies.

He put it to the fire to cook. This time, he stopped thinking about other stuff. All he did was stare at the bird’s leg. He wanted to see what ate his last thigh.

While the fire was up, the bird’s leg soon started to smell nice. The oil sizzled as droplets began to roll off the skin like honey. The smell and color were very enticing.

Han Sen remained on alert. He looked all around. Aside from the “sha-sha” noise of the blowing breeze and the birds screaming through the night, there was nothing else.

“Is that thing afraid of being seen? Is that why it is no longer coming out?” Han Sen thought of that and felt safer.

If that thing felt fear, it would not be a beast that was too scary. To him, it was pretty good news.

After that pause, Han Sen sat back a little. Just like earlier, he lowered his head and pretended to think. From the corner of his eyes, he kept his attention on the thigh.

The thigh, by this point, was being cooked very well. It smelled delicious, so it was almost done. Despite that, nothing showed up.

“Is that thing already full after eating a thigh?” Han Sen did not think that was possible. He then felt as if his clothes were being ruffled behind him.

Han Sen felt a chill. He shivered. He quickly turned around. When he turned around, he didn’t see anything. It was empty. In the distance behind him, around 90 to 120 feet away from his position, Han Sen sensed that there was nothing.

Han Sen looked back at the fire and the meat that was cooking, but his face made a ghastly wince. The cooked thigh had been eaten. There were only the scraps of a thigh bone hanging.

There was nothing else around that place. There was not even a shadow.

“What is this? This is Dust Sky. Aside from Bury Path God, other creatures should be subject to the rules of this world. They should not be able to use powers. Can ordinary creatures be that fast? Even with my full attention on the thigh, it was taken.” Han Sen could not believe it.

His body was powerful. It was the greatest in the universe. If someone at the same level was suppressed, not many people could be faster than him.

“That thing can obviously kill me if it wants to, so why doesn’t it? He just wants to eat the thigh. Is he not interested in me? Does he really only want the thigh? Does it actually want to play with me? Does it want a game of cat and mouse?” Han Sen was frozen. He frowned. He surveyed the area, but there was nothing to be found.

The fact that the night was so quiet made people feel pressure. The forest around was like an abyssal hell. It was very dark. One did not know what scary monsters might be lurking in wait.

As a normal person, that mental pressure would likely break their hearts. Han Sen fetched some more bird meat and went back to cooking it.

This time, he did not want to lure that creature out. He collected the meat the moment it was done. He was going to eat it.

He suddenly saw a cold light flicker. It swiftly flashed near Han Sen’s mouth. The bird meat in Han Sen’s hand flew away. Han Sen’s teeth sank into nothing.
