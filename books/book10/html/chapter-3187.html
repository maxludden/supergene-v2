<h2>Cutting Paper</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3187</h3>

<p>A mountain pierced through the skies. A strange god temple was
on its peak.</p>
<p>The god temple’s structure was very defined. The primary hall
was only nine feet tall. It had a few side halls. Overall, it
looked very large, but a large god temple like that gave people the
feeling that it could easily break. It was hard to describe how
weird it was.</p>
<p>When one looked a bit closer, one realized that the god temple
was composed of a white substance. It looked like it was made of
paper. It was no wonder that it looked like a place that could
easily tumble with one stab.</p>
<p>Everything about the white temple was strange. Even the tables,
god altar, god stove, and god statues were made of paper. It felt
like a very spooky and scary place.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at the god temple with interest. She seemed to be
rather interested in the locale.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at Rocky Dee and asked with a blink of her eyes,
“What would happen if I lit a match in here?”</p>
<p>“This is a god temple. It is not ordinary paper. Water, fire, or
any other kind of weapon cannot actually deal harm to this temple.”
Rocky Dee sat on a paper chair. He flicked his hands and had two
human-sized paper people bring a plate forward. They brought over
paper plates and paper cups. They poured out a cup of coffee for
Rocky Dee.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee drank his coffee in an elegant posture as he asked
Bao’er, “What does the cute little princess want to drink?”</p>
<p>“I want to drink tea.” Bao’er was not polite. She just sat down
on the paper chair.</p>
<p>The thin white paper turned into an S shape. Bao’er sat on it.
The paper trembled like the thin wings of a cicada, but it did not
break. In some ways, it was like a rocking chair.</p>
<p>The paper maid quickly brought a cup of tea over. Bao’er looked
at the paper man made of paper with genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>“These paper people look rather funny,” Bao’er said. She watched
the paper people with keen interest as she picked up the cup of tea
to wet her whistle.</p>
<p>“If you like, I can give you a few of these paper people. I can
cut them out into any face you like. If there is some handsome
celebrity or general you admire, I can cut them out for you.” Rocky
Dee drank his coffee with a warm smile.</p>
<p>“I like your face. Why don’t you give me a paper person that
looks just like you?” Bao’er happily looked at Rocky Dee.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s eyes twitched a little. He looked at Bao’er, who had
a big pair of gleaming eyes. She looked like a clear spring without
any dust. It did not look as if she was making a joke or toying
with him.</p>
<p>Plus, Bao’er had followed him there without issue. Rocky Dee
just thought she was a child who enjoyed playing around.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Rocky Dee’s lips developed a smile. His
beard lifted as he thought, “I really am a handsome gentleman who
has thousands of women and goddesses loving me. Despite how
troublesome it is to look this fine, I cannot help being so
attractive.”</p>
<p>He looked very cocky as his eyebrows raised. Rocky Dee put down
his cup. He coughed lightly and asked, “Do you really want it that
much?”</p>
<p>Bao’er nodded. Her little hands became two little fists in front
of her chest. She looked at Rocky Dee happily as she answered,
“Yes. I really, really, really want it. If your face became a paper
person, it would look so good.”</p>
<p>Rocky Dee smiled and nodded. “OK. Since you are being so sincere
about this, I can make one for you. But this is a limited edition,
OK? There will only be one in this entire universe. You need to
look after it with the utmost care.”</p>
<p>“I will treat it like the most important thing in my life.”
Bao’er raised her head as if she was making a solemn and profound
promise.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee loved Bao’er’s attitude. He took out a white sheet of
paper and said, “After I make you this, you must stay here nicely
until your father comes to pick you up.”</p>
<p>“With your paper copy, it is fine if my father does not come,”
Bao’er said.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee felt very cocky and thought, “Being too charming is a
bad thing. Even a small little girl like her fancies me to be her
daddy. Sigh. This is so troublesome.”</p>
<p>After that, Rocky Dee picked up a sheet of paper. His right
hand’s index and middle fingers behaved like a pair of scissors
that cut through the sheet. He kept cutting to cut out his face. He
put a lot of effort into the task.</p>
<p>It must be stated that Rocky Dee’s skills were very good.
Although it was only going to be something like a silhouette
without any precise facial details, it looked a lot like him. Even
the little beard on it was a bit raised.</p>
<p>After cutting, Rocky Dee trimmed it a little and happily gave it
to Bao’er. “You must look after this thing as if it were your
child. This is a unique silhouette.”</p>
<p>Bao’er picked up the paper silhouette and looked as if she
cherished it greatly. She said, “Thank you, Uncle.”</p>
<p>“Uncle?” Rocky Dee’s eyes twitched. He patted Bao’er on the head
and smiled. “Little Princess, you should think about calling me
Mister God. If you really want to start calling me Handsome Mister
Minister, I think that would be rather dandy. It is up to you, of
course.”</p>
<p>” I think calling you an uncle is very fitting,” Bao’er said as
she looked at Rocky Dee.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s face looked rather glum. He grunted. “Whatever. You
just stay here and sit still until Han Sen comes to pick you
up.”</p>
<p>“OK. If you are here with me, it is fine if my father does not
show,” Bao’er said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“I do not have any time to play around with you. You can
entertain yourself to pass the time.” After Rocky Dee said that, he
readied himself to leave.</p>
<p>“No, I want you to play with me,” Bao’er said with a shake of
her head.</p>
<p>“Who in this world would waste time playing with you? Besides, I
am a very busy man.” Rocky Dee wanted to ignore Bao’er. He turned
around and walked out of the god temple.</p>
<p>After walking a few steps, he felt as if his body was no longer
listening to him. He could no longer control his body. He walked
back to Bao’er.</p>
<p>“What… What is going on…” Rocky Dee’s face changed. He tried
using power to control his body, but it did not work.</p>
<p>He then saw Bao’er playing with the paper man he had just
made.</p>
<p>“Salute!” Bao’er was holding the paper man. She made the paper
man perform a saluting gesture.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s body lifted its right hand by its own volition. He
had no say in it. He was suddenly just like the paper man. He
performed the saluting gesture.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee’s face changed. “What… How is this possible… She has
that control power… Isn’t she a human girl? A human girl at that
age should not have such wicked powers. Even with a powerful gene
race, there is no way she could channel so much power without
fault. She did not even combine with a gene race. This… What is
going on?” Rocky Dee now regretted his deeds. If he had not cut out
his own silhouette for Bao’er and given it to her, no matter how
strong she was, she would have been unable to control him.</p>
<p>Aside from himself and one of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits,
he never thought there would be another being with the same type of
power and powerful enough to control him.</p>
<p>Even the God Spirit from the 12 Annihilation God Spirits would
have been unable to control him completely with his paper
shape.</p>
<p>“Take a dump.” Bao’er moved the paper man to open its legs and
squat into a pooping position.</p>
<p>“No… No… I am a gentleman… How could I perform such an
embarrassing action?” Rocky Dee shouted at the top of his lungs.
His face turned red. He wanted to smack a wall.</p>
<p>But he could not control his body. He looked like the paper man
who was taking a dump.</p>
