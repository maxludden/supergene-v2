<p>“I will bring him back,” Zhao Ning’er said with a frown. “He
cannot run far.” “I do not need him anymore,” Bury Path God coldly
said. His body developed a demonic presence as the sky went dark.
Zhao Ning’er looked as if she was being isolated from the outside
world.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er’s eyes froze. She stared at Bury Path God as she
said, “Bury Path God, this is the capital of the Zhao Kingdom. If
you dare do anything here, the guardian God Spirit will smite you
with its wrath.”</p>
<p>Bury Path God did not move. He walked toward Zhao Ning’er and
said, “I have plunged this planet into an abyss. Not even a sky
full of God Spirits will be able to figure what is going on here
now.”</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er’s face changed. She pulled Zhao Qiu Yi behind her.
She looked at Bury Path God and said, “You cannot kill me, and
there is no benefit for you killing me either. I can complete our
deal and get Han Sen back.”</p>
<p>“Killing you might not benefit me, but your life soul has
matured. It is time to get it back. As for Han Sen, if he has run,
you will never be able to get another chance.” Bury Path God kept
approaching at a slow pace. The whole world was buried by his
oppressive footsteps. They elicited extreme pressure and fear. Zhao
Ning’er felt as if she could not breathe. Zhao Qiu Yi, however, was
on the floor as if she had been physically crushed.</p>
<p>If it was not for Zhao Ning’er being there, Zhao Qiu Yi’s body
would have been completely crushed by the scary pressure.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er knew this fight could not be avoided. She did not
want Zhao Qiu Yi to deal with the pressure. Therefore, she shouted
and made a scary presence envelope her body. She was like a god
woman shouting at Bury Path God.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you, Bury Path God, how heavy is the sky?”</p>
<p>A raging god sound turned into a weird power. It went straight
to Bury Path God. It was like it was bumping into his body,
stopping Bury Path God from moving.</p>
<p>Bury Path God was emotionless. He coldly answered, “Your asking
heart power is surprisingly useful, but it does not work on me.
Stop wasting your time.”</p>
<p>“Bury Path God, let me ask you again. How heavy is the sky?”
Zhao Ning’er gnashed her teeth and used the asking heart
language.</p>
<p>A weird power wrapped up Bury Path God. It made Bury Path God
stop. He could not keep going. The world-breaking came to an
end.</p>
<p>Bury Path God coldly looked at Zhao Ning’er and said,
“Thirty-three.”</p>
<p>After that, Bury Path God walked forward and kept approaching
Zhao Ning’er. “Blergh!” Zhao Ning’er spat out blood. The asking
heart power backfired, but she was already prepared for that. She
knew Bury Path God would have an answer. “What is above the 33
skies?” Zhao Ning’er exploded with god light. This time, she was
scarier. A weird power broke the rules of the world and landed on
Bury Path God. He stopped again. “Above the 33 skies is Outer Sky,”
Bury Path God answered. With a sense of overbearing, he continued
marching forward. He was 10 steps away from Zhao Ning’er at this
point.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er coughed up more blood. Her body started to crack.
Blood seeped out through the gaps. Her nose started to bleed. The
asking heart language started to consume her again.</p>
<p>“What is above Outer Sky?” As Zhao Ning’er’s spoke, her hair
became a wild mess that started to float and fly. God light
exploded once more while she asked the question.</p>
<p>“Above 33 is Yin…” Bury Path God didn’t stop. He stepped forward
when he spoke the first word. The crushing world was coming closer
to Zhao Ning’er.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er was bleeding from seven orifices. Her asking heart
power needed her to ask difficult questions to stop the opponent so
they could turn that person into a mud man.</p>
<p>If the opponent’s heart was fine and unrattled, leading to them
being able to provide an answer to her question, the asking heart
power was useless.</p>
<p>She asked three questions, yet she was unable to stop Bury Path
God. It resulted in her being the one wounded. It was a really
terrible state of affairs.</p>
<p>“Big Sister… I am sorry… I was wrong…” Zhao Qiu Yi regretted
things very much. If it was not for her letting Han Sen go, Zhao
Ning’er would not be suffering.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with you,” Zhao Ning’er said. “It looks
like he wants to kill me anyway. Even if you had given me Han Sen,
he would still be doing this. Qiu Yi, you should just run.” She
forced herself to use Break World powers. She used the asking heart
language against Bury Path God. “What is above the Yin world?”</p>
<p>“My heart can go through you. From ancient times to now, the
universe’s 10 billion years are in one thought. Your asking heart
power does not work on me. You should stop wasting time.” Bury Path
God did not answer. He drew an item.</p>
<p>It was the size of a ping-pong ball. It was an egg that looked
like a crystal. A flame-like fire was inside of it.</p>
<p>Bury Path God used his fingertip to point at the egg. He mumbled
some mysterious chanting spells and conjured some weird power
inside his finger, which he then put onto the gene egg.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The gene egg’s fire blew up with a ravaging flame that burned.
It wrapped up the whole gene egg. “Argh!” Zhao Ning’er suddenly
screamed and was kneeling on the floor. She went on all fours as a
Break World power exploded madly. Her body was affected by the
power and started to change. Her black hair turned white. Her small
ears became long and sharp. Her back displayed snow-white wings.
Her armor exploded. Her skin had white feathers.</p>
<p>“Big Sister, what has happened to you?” Zhao Qiu Yi touched Zhao
Ning’er, but she could not ease her pain and revert her status.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er unleashed screams that could break hearts and one’s
lungs. Her body kept morphing. She turned from a human into a white
bird.</p>
<p>Bury Path God looked at Zhao Ning’er change. He spoke to
himself, “Did this test subject succeed?”</p>
<p>A shocking sky bird sound shocked the sky. Zhao Ning’er’s body
became a completely white god bird. Her entire body burned with a
mysterious flame. She was like a phoenix that was born from a
fire.</p>
<p>Bury Path God was holding a gene egg. The fire looked like the
shadow of Zhao Ning’er. She flapped her wings and flew around the
interior of the gene egg.</p>
<p>It seemed to reflect whatever the gene egg did. Zhao Ning’er’s
god bird started to fly. It blew Zhao Qiu Yi away. She flew into
the sky.</p>
<p>“Come. The Break World beast… Asking heart…” Bury Path God’s
eyes were on fire. He raised the gene egg in his hands.</p>
<p>It seemed to be drawn by some power. Zhao Ning’er’s god bird
flew toward the gene egg in Bury Path God’s hands. It was like a
moth flying to a flame.</p>
<p>“Big Sister… No…” Zhao Qiu Yi was crying so hard that it seemed
like she would tear up her lungs or heart. She crawled forward,
wanting to chase Zhao Ning’er’s god bird. Alas, she could not.
Hearing Zhao Qiu Yi cry, the god bird stopped. It stopped flying to
the gene egg. It looked like it was wrestling with indecision.</p>
<p>“Come. You will be the strongest creature in the universe. How
beautiful is this life? This is what you should have.” Bury Path
God looked excited. He put more power into his gene egg. The
shadows were on the gene egg. They were wrapped up by the flaming
god bird.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er looked as if she was struggling. She looked to be
in a lot of pain. Her eyes bled bloody tears, but her body flew to
the gene egg.</p>
