The two of them continued fighting, but they were unable to deal damage to each other.

Han Sen kept altering his knife skills. Shale’s punching skill didn’t change in the face of Han Sen’s rapidly mutating attacks. The two of them fought as hard and fast as they could, but neither of them could gain the upper hand.

It had been a very long time since Han Sen had a fight like this. In his recent fights, he had either lost to his enemies or crushed them almost immediately. He hadn’t put so much energy and effort into a fight since his contest with Lone Bamboo.

A fight like this drained a lot of energy from his body. It also forced him to use his mind constantly. If he made a mistake, his enemy would take advantage of the window and beat him. He couldn’t afford to make a single misstep.

As the Very High watched the pair conduct their battle, conflicted looks appeared across their faces. Both of the fighters were King class, but their minds were deified. The fight was so nuanced that the onlookers didn’t know what to make of it.

This was no ordinary battle. This fight took effort and brainpower. Many of the attacks and counters seemed simple, until the audience took a second to consider why the two fighters had chosen those moves. Every single action in this fight was done with an ulterior motive.

It looked like a simple fist and knife fight, but people would be thinking about it for a long time afterward.

Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng’s bodies were quivering. It was hard to tell who was going to win and who would lose. It looked as if winning or losing would only come from a hair-thin lead.

“Big Brother, having Shale as your silkworm is very fortuitous for you.” Bixi looked at his big brother Li Chun Qiu with grand admiration.

“Yu Shanxin isn’t bad, either,” Li Chun Qiu said distantly. Since Shale was his silkworm, he wasn’t really paying much attention to their conversation. He felt as if he was fighting Han Sen himself, right then and there. But there were many fighting minds and techniques he had to learn that he had never previously encountered. It felt so strange.

Experiencing the battle from Shale’s perspective was unique. He felt like he was fighting himself, but at the same time, he could step back and examine Shale’s choices with a critical eye. He could tell which decisions Shale made were better than his opponent and vice versa. He only absorbed the good battle experiences, while figuring out and filing away the bad ones.

Right now, Shale was only half-deified. In the future, Shale would travel through the deified ranks of primitive, transmutation, larva, butterfly, and maybe even true god. Li Chun Qiu could slowly absorb everything that Shale experienced.

At that point, Li Chun Qiu would only be half-deified. But he would have the experience of a true god. Li Chun Qiu could slowly study everything that Shale had learned through his evolution. Although he would only be half-deified himself, his mind would be on a different level.

Bixi looked bitter as he said, “This Yu Shanxin hides a great deal from me. He is so strong and tough. He is a difficult nut to crack. Even now, I have yet to learn a single thing from his mind.”

“Those silkworms might be the most challenging, but they’re also the most rewarding. Conquering them will yield better results in the long run,” Li Chun Qiu said.

“You are right, but… Well, never mind. I bet Exquisite and Li Keer have the same problem…” Bixi said.

Exquisite and Li Keer did have trouble, but Han Sen let them in when he fought. Like Li Chun Qiu, they gained a lot of battle experience from Han Sen. Each decision he made taught them a lot.

But while Han Sen was a ninth-tier King, he had a scary power and a scarier mind. It made them so happy. Even if Han Sen lost this fight, just getting to experience this battle would be more than worth it to them.

One thing caught them off guard, though. Despite the intensity of the fight, they could sense that Han Sen was deliberately hiding the true range of his powers.

“Is Han Sen not using all of his strength?” The possibility stunned them. He was already fighting at an unbelievable level, and yet he didn’t seem to have tapped into the full potential of his power. That was a scary thought.

Li Keer had always thought Dollar was stronger than Han Sen, but she now found herself looking at the man with a complicated expression.

Although he was fighting an elite like Shale, Han Sen could still hide some of his power. This was no longer just an intimidating display of ability; it was out-and-out frightening.

Although Han Sen tried his best to close off his mind and avoid thinking about the Dongxuan Sutra and his super god spirit body, Li Keer and Exquisite were still able to pick up that he was suppressing something. They would come to know that Han Sen was hiding his true power, but that couldn’t be avoided.

In truth, Han Sen’s ability to suppress his thoughts at all in this situation indicated that the power of his mind was terrifyingly profound. In a fight like that, most people would need to constantly think about which geno arts and powers they were good at.

“This guy is too scary…” Li Keer said while she watched Han Sen.

“He is rather frightening, isn’t he? I don’t think he will ever fail to surprise us. Every time we think we have seen it all, he goes the extra mile and does more,” Exquisite said with a nervous smile.

When she fought Han Sen, she thought that she had forced him to cast many of his skills. But it now looked like Han Sen had only used a fraction of his talent when he was fighting her. He was now bringing out more tools, but even more were still being kept hidden.

“We must dig into this man and unearth all of his secrets,” Li Keer said. Her eyes were brimming with excitement.

Li Keer had better potential than Exquisite, but she didn’t focus on the Very High Sense. Her Very High Forget Love wasn’t as developed as Exquisite’s, so she was prone to becoming more emotional.

Exquisite only coldly said, “There is no rush. We have four years. He will reveal his secrets to us in time. It doesn’t matter that he has managed to hide it all for now.”Open Sky Elder looked a bit gloomy, and he said, “The smallest move could determine how this plays out. Either one of them could win at this point. Han Sen is strong, but he is just a ninth-tier King. He is ranked lower than Shale. If they were in the same class, Han Sen would have a seventy percent chance of winning.”

Qiyu Elder shook his head and said, “No, it doesn’t work like that. Shale is half-deified, but his will is deified. Han Sen is just a ninth-tier King, and yet, he is holding his own against a powerful half-deified. That means his talent and potential are scarier than Shale’s.”

“Does that mean the eleven armor talent test was legit?” Open Sky Elder wondered with a frown.

“It is hard to say. If he isn’t doing this well because of his talent, then it is hard to imagine what Han Sen has that is letting him fight Shale.” Qiyu Elder looked at Han Sen, his face conflicted.

“A ten armor talent is very rare. A real eleven armor talent would make a man the greatest of his generation. Do you think Han Sen is this kind of great man?” Open Sky Elder asked, looking a little worried.

“I’m not sure about that, but it is plain to see that his talent is stunning. Li Keer and Exquisite got lucky when they signed a contract with him,” Qiyu Elder said.

“What is going on… Something is wrong with Shale!” Open Sky Elder wanted to say something, but he was in too much shock. Then, his face went white. He looked at Shale in the video and screamed, “He… He’s going to level up!”
