<p>“General Ghost Bone, you are to receive so many benefits off me,
can you at least let me die as an educated man?” Han Sen spoke it
strangely.</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone stopped his cackling and said, “Thank you for
doing so much for me, but I am afraid I do not have the time to
talk with you. All you need to know is that the relic you recovered
is a key that enables the opening of Sacred leader’s treasure box.
When I get the relic from the holy monument, I will use your body
to travel around the world. Your body will most certainly be a
famous one. You will not be dying in vain.”</p>
<p>“So what if you have a key? Do you even know where the holy
monument is?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“If I did not know, what would the point be in me taking that
plate? The holy monument resides on this very planet. I just need
to get out of this body. Then, I can go to the monument and recover
the leader’s relic.” General Ghost Bone seemed to be very excited.
He appeared to be drowning in his own dream.</p>
<p>Han Sen was only just a Duke, and back then, General Ghost Bone
was incredibly strong all around the world. He would even look down
to all the King class elites, but now, he had no choice. Given the
opportunity for something else, he wouldn’t have settled for a
Duke, though.</p>
<p>Back then, if he selected a deified body, he would have to
consider.</p>
<p>Now, a Duke was in his control. He thought that it was his item
already, and Han Sen was not so sure he could escape this.</p>
<p>Han Sen, after hearing a bit, acknowledged it was mostly General
Ghost Bone’s dreaming. He had not told him where the monument was
exactly. When he was just about to ask more, his body trembled. The
Ghost Bone Mask was reduced to dust across his face. General Ghost
Bone’s will was headed into his own will sea.</p>
<p>Right now, Han Sen had become a holy Bone. He looked as if he
was a crystal or a statue made from bone. It felt as if people that
saw him would definitely wish to obey him.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that his body had finished the modification
process. It was too late for him to ask General Ghost Bone anything
now.</p>
<p>“Everybody, I am back! Shake beneath the quake of my footsteps.”
General Ghost Bone’s will was something truly demonic. He was
screaming into Han Sen’s own will.</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone, when entering Han Sen’s will sea, became
shocked. “Why is your will sea like this?”</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone looked at the will sea. There was a tower in
the middle of it, and inside, there was all sorts of beasts and
xenogeneics around it. It was like a little world all of its own.
General Ghost Bone had not seen anything like that before.</p>
<p>“It’s actually called a Sea of Soul.” Han Sen’s voice sounded
inside the Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>“I do not care about what this Sea of Soul is, when I am here,
this is my territory.” General Ghost Bone’s powerful willpower was
suppressing the Sea of Soul. He wanted to claim that place and
destroy Han Sen’s will. Once he accomplished that, he could fully
claim Han Sen’s body for himself.</p>
<p>But as soon as his soul arrived there, in the corner of the Sea
of Soul, a black crystal armorset suddenly came to life and lit up
in his eyes. A scary will took over the entire Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>General Ghost Bone’s powerful deified will was destroyed when
that will came. He did not stand a chance.</p>
<p>“Impossible… Impossible… Argh…” General Ghost Bone did not have
the opportunity to escape the Sea of Soul. He screamed, and that
scary will of his was crushed into nothingness.</p>
<p>The black crystal armorset’s power faded. It was like nothing
had happened all that time. A general’s will had oh-so quickly been
entirely dismissed.</p>
<p>“Why was he in such a rush to commit suicide? He did not even
tell me where the holy monument was!” Han Sen knew this was going
to happen. Nothing would end up well for someone who sought to
invade his Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen might have felt a little sorry for what happened, but he
was ultimately made happy. General Ghost Bone’s leftover power was
still inside Han Sen’s body, and that was his own now. He could
become better with it.</p>
<p>Much Ghost Bone power gathered up in Han Sen’s body. If he
refined all that Ghost Bone power, he could become a Duke.</p>
<p>That being said, it really was just leftover power from General
Ghost Bone. It would not be as effective as a perfect and raw
power. Still, it was deified power. The strength and purity was
naturally far better than a Duke’s. Every ounce of that power was
utterly priceless.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen’s body was filled up with deified Ghost Bone power.
His body was like a treasure in itself. He did not have to locate
any more resources. He only had to refine that power, and likely
level up from it.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just his Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra that
would level up. Even his The Story of Genes might level up to
become Duke. It had the possibility of even going further.</p>
<p>“General Ghost Bone was nice. It was a shame he died so early.
It would have been perfect if he was able to tell me where the holy
monument is.” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking for a bit, and then, he opened his eyes. He
saw Fox Queen standing in front of him.</p>
<p>“My Dear, thank you so much,” Han Sen coldly said, as he looked
on Fox Queen. Now, his body was like Ghost Bone’s. Fox Queen had
not seen what had occurred inside the Sea of Soul, so she was not
yet aware that he had died. Now he could disguise himself as
General Ghost Bone, and in doing so, fool Fox Queen.</p>
<p>Fox Queen looked at Han Sen and laughed, “You look very evil.
Ghost Bone, do you think I will help you? You locked me up here for
a billion years, all to make me suffer. I have waited for this for
so long. Now that you have a body and you cannot use your power for
a while. You are just a Duke, too, so the time has come for me to
kill you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He did not expect this. He wanted to
disguise himself as General Ghost Bone, all so he could fool her.
He thought he could get some secrets from her, too. He did not know
this was going to happen.</p>
<p>Fox Queen looked strange. The substance chain around her body
was tangling her. Her white hair was waving and her fox tail was
trembling. She was going to break the air.</p>
<p>The chain and the shackles were full of a black smoke. Five
ghostly hand tried to hold onto Fox Queen’s neck, wrists, and
ankles.</p>
<p>Fox Queen’s substance chain blocked those black hands, though.
The hands could not stop her. Fox Queen reached her hand out, and
the substance chain was going right for Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Hang on! I am not General Ghost Bone, I am San Mu!” Han Sen
quickly said.</p>
<p>“Maybe that trick might work on others, but it won’t work on
me.” Fox Queen did not believe Han Sen, and the substance chain
kept going for him. It was not going to relent.</p>
<p>Fox Queen believed this was her only chance. Her body was tied
up, and she had spent most of her power suppressing the metal
chains. The actual power she could use was a very small amount to
her total, and she needed to kill General Ghost Bone while his body
was still only a Duke. If it was any later, she would not have that
chance.</p>
<p>Fox Queen had waited many years for this opportunity.</p>
