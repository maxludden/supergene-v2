	<p>Han Sen looked at the information available on the internet, but he could not find any others who were associated
		with the sanctuaries. It seemed no one else on Kate was.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wanted to know if things worked like they did in the sanctuaries. Where did genes come from? Were there
		beast souls to get? Stuff like that.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen exited the training room, everyone was gone. Hardman had already left, and everyone else had
		followed him out. They were not happy that Han Sen had failed, and they were not willing to sign any more
		contracts with him.</p>

	<p>But the contract was still not over, and despite knowing Hardman no longer wanted him, he knew he’d still have to
		stay until the terms of the contract were over and it expired.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen walked out, however, Lan Se was there. She had been waiting outside for him. When Han Sen approached
		her, she said, “You know my phone number. If you require more work, call me. The graveyard still has a free slot
		for you.”</p>

	<p>Lan Se knew Hardman would not want to keep Han Sen on any longer than he had to because he had not become a
		Noble. And she was afraid Han Sen might resort to desperate measures to survive that could bring harm to Planet
		Kate. She sympathized with him, and that was why she made the offer.</p>

	<p>“Thank you, Officer Lan.” Han Sen actually felt quite touched.</p>

	<p>Returning to his room, he noticed the door was open. Someone was already moving stuff into the room. Hardman’s
		secretary, who was wearing high heels on and stood with her arms crossed, appeared to be overseeing the move.
	</p>

	<p>“Secretary Lena, what’s going on?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>

	<p>The secretary swung her black and white tail, and with her arms still folded, she said, “I am sorry, but there is
		not enough space in the base. It is a waste to let you live alone in this room. So, the manager will give you
		another place where you can live with a roommate.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew that he had failed and Hardman no longer wished to invest in him. He couldn’t stay in the best room
		any longer, and his benefits would be severely reduced. Han Sen had nothing, so he just picked up a few of his
		extra clothes and walked back out of the room.</p>

	<p>“Secretary Lena, where is my new room?” he asked.</p>

	<p>“I am too busy to take you there. It’s room 702. Go there yourself.” Lena did not look at Han Sen. She was acting
		completely different than she had before.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not mind, though. He just took his stuff and left the room, headed for the seventh floor.</p>

	<p>The seventh floor was living quarters for the hunting group. But it was just an ordinary dorm room, where four
		people bunked together.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen reached 702, no one was there. He set up the room and got his own key for the place, then he took a
		shower and changed clothes. His old clothes had been destroyed, so he was walking around in his geno armor.
		Wearing it did not cost him energy as it had in the sanctuaries, but he didn’t really need to have it on right
		then.</p>

	<p>After the shower, Han Sen found an empty spot to put down his few possessions.</p>

	<p>To Han Sen’s surprise, when he touched the bone he had found with Old Cat, he heard an announcement play.</p>

	<p>“Xenogeneic Gene discovered.”</p>

	<p>Old Cat had told him that the bones were useful outside the sanctuary, but he hadn’t expected to have Old Cat’s
		words confirmed so soon.</p>

	<p>“How do I use this?” Han Sen checked out the bone, not entirely sure how he’d earn the geno points it contained.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen ran his skills, but the bone remained quiet. He gave it a drop of Real Blood, but it also stayed quiet.
	</p>

	<p>The voice from the sanctuary had only spoken once, and it was now silent. Whatever it was, it couldn’t help Han
		Sen any more.</p>

	<p>“Do I have to eat this to make it work?” Han Sen tried to bite the bone, but it was so f*cking hard, his teeth
		almost crumbled to pieces. That definitely wasn’t going to work.</p>

	<p>“It looks like I’ll have to cook it,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

	<p>The bone was not very big. It was red and purplish, and it had a metallic hue. If Han Sen had not have found it
		himself, he would not have believed that it had come from some creature’s body.</p>

	<p>He planned to make a soup out of it, despite not knowing if that would work.</p>

	<p>There was no other way, though. Han Sen wanted to at least try it, so he bought a small cooker from a shop and
		brought it back with him to the living quarters.</p>

	<p>Back in the living quarters, Han Sen filled up a pot with water and tossed the bone in. He then put a lid on it
		and plugged the cooker in. He turned it on and allowed it to cook.</p>

	<p>As he was doing this, the doorbell rang. Three Kate people, covered in sweat, came waltzing in. Everyone in the
		base knew Han Sen had made the flowers chime and that Hardman had bought him in the hopes of gaining a Noble.
		Even if they didn’t know, the word that Han Sen had failed to generate a geno weapon spread like wildfire.</p>

	<p>“Bud, don’t take it too hard. It’s okay if you didn’t evolve twice. 99.9% of people don’t, and you know what?
		We’re still living.” The Kate man patted Han Sen on the shoulder. He didn’t mean to mock Han Sen, though. It was
		a genuine attempt at comfort.</p>

	<p>“Thanks, but I’m okay.” Han Sen did not think failing was a big deal. When others failed, that was that. Han Sen
		still had the Dongxuan Sutra and the Blood-Pulse Sutra to work with, so he still had another two chances.</p>

	<p>It would be no big deal even if Han Sen failed completely. Han Sen thought that he could always absorb Xenogeneic
		genes to evolve, as well. There was more than one way to progress.</p>

	<p>“You are welcome. But don’t thank me. If one day you are in danger, and people come to your aid, it’ll cost you
		more than a thanks,” another Kate told him.</p>

	<p>叮hen what should I say?” Han Sen laughed</p>

	<p>“Say nothing. Now, do you have cigarettes?” a Kate asked, lying on the bed.</p>

	<p>“No, I don’t smoke.” Han Sen used to smoke, but he had been in the sanctuaries for too long. Since there were no
		cigarettes there, he was forced to stop.</p>

	<p>“Is that yours? What are you cooking?” The last Kate saw Han Sen’s cooker and just had to ask.</p>
