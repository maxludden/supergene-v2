Human beings, who used to stand on top of the food chain because of their wisdom and technology fell to the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>But when people killed certain relatively weak creatures and ate their flesh, they were surprised to find that their own bodies changed considerably and evolved quickly in ways that science could not explain.<\/p>\n<p>What made people pleasantly surprised was that in this world, with the evolution of the body, their lifespans also increased, which was amazing news to all mankind.<\/p>\n<p>In the following century, more and more people entered this world called \u201cGod\u2019s Sanctuary,\u201d gradually became familiar with the rules of this world, hunted its creatures, and saw their own bodies evolve. The higher the degree of physical evolution, the longer the life. Theoretically, if you could continue evolving, it could be possible to live forever.<\/p>\n<p>In this world, science and technology became completely useless. The only things that could help humans were the most primitive fighting skills. Ancient martial arts, which were almost forgotten in modern society, had an unexpected effect here.<\/p>\n<p>All kinds of ancient martial arts had been re-developed, and after more than 100 years of development, new martial arts schools were formed and became prominent.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to ancient martial arts, God\u2019s Sanctuary offered another tool to enhance humans, the beast soul.<\/p>\n<p>When killing a creature in God\u2019s Sanctuary, a person had a chance to obtain the beast soul of the creature. Beast souls had all kinds of forms and appearances. Some could be summoned to fight for men, and some appeared in the form of armor or weapon.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some beast souls could even help humans transform so they could take the shape of terrifying monsters, magical birds flying between heaven and earth, or insects drilling underground.<\/p>\n<p>Neither martial arts nor beast souls had anything to do with Han Sen.<\/p>\n<p>Even in modern society, advanced science and technology were in the hands of just a few people.<\/p>\n<p>Han Sen completed integrated compulsory education and entered God\u2019s Sanctuary when he turned 16. What he had learned from school was no more than the beginning level new martial arts that everyone knew.<\/p>\n<p>As for beast souls, they were so expensive that Han Sen couldn\u2019t afford even the cheapest.<\/p>\n<p>Without martial arts and beast souls, or even advanced man-made alloy weapons, Han Sen was only able to kill some low-level creatures to eat their flesh and evolve, and he was having a difficult time in God\u2019s Sanctuary.<\/p>\n<p>But the more meat of low-level creatures he ate, the less effect of evolution he gained. Three months in God\u2019s Sanctuary and he still could not complete a physical evolution.<\/p>\n<p>Han Sen had tried to kill some of the more powerful creatures, but even the weakest primitive creature, the copper-toothed beast, almost took his life. He had to rest for nearly a month before returning to God\u2019s Sanctuary.<\/p>\n<p>By this time Han Sen had eaten all kinds of ordinary creatures around him, and it wouldn\u2019t help to eat their flesh any more. If he didn\u2019t risk hunting more advanced creatures, he would never evolve.<\/p>\n<p>When he was about to try to kill a copper-toothed beast, Han Sen saw something climbing out from the ripples of the creek.<\/p>\n<p>He originally thought it was a black beetle, but immediately noticed something different: all black beetles had black shells, but a bright golden color caught his eye.<\/p>\n<p>Han Sen gazed at the creature climbing out of the water. It really was a black beetle, but different from the ordinary ones because of its golden body as big as a basketball. It was like a sculpture carved from gold, and its eyes were crystal clear, like gems. It did not even look like a living thing unless observed carefully.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is this black beetle so strange?\u201d Han Sen stared at the golden black beetle.<\/p>\n<p>Recently he had killed countless black beetles and knew everything about them. Their vision was poor, but their hearing was very sensitive. As long as he remained still, even in close proximity, a black beetle would not notice his presence.<\/p>\n<p>Han Sen stared at the strange beetle, and unexpectedly, it climbed toward him.<\/p>\n<p>Without hesitation, when the golden black beetle crawled next to Han Sen, he held down the golden black beetle\u2019s shell with one hand and swiftly cut into its fragile joints with the dagger in his other hand. He made six clean cuts vertically and horizontally to remove all six claws of the beetle.<\/p>\n<p>The golden black beetle struggled and flipped over. Taking this opportunity, Han Sen pierced his dagger into a white mark on its belly and turned it sharply. The golden black beetle suddenly stopped moving.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSacred-Blood Creature Black Beetle Killed. Beast Soul of Sacred-Blood Black Beetle Gained.

Some could be summoned to fight for men, and some appeared in the form of armor or weapon.\nIn addition, some beast souls could even help humans transform so they could take the shape of terrifying monsters, magical birds flying between heaven and earth, or insects drilling underground.\nNeither martial arts nor beast souls had anything to do with Han Sen.\nEven in modern society, advanced science and technology were in the hands of just a few people.\nHan Sen completed integrated compulsory education and entered God\u2019s Sanctuary when he turned 16. What he had learned from school was no more than the beginning level new martial arts that everyone knew.\nAs for beast souls, they were so expensive that Han Sen couldn\u2019t afford even the cheapest.\nWithout martial arts and beast souls, or even advanced man-made alloy weapons, Han Sen was only able to kill some low-level creatures to eat their flesh and evolve, and he was having a difficult time in God\u2019s Sanctuary.\nBut the more meat of low-level creatures he ate, the less effect of evolution he gained. Three months in God\u2019s Sanctuary and he still could not complete a physical evolution.\nHan Sen had tried to kill some of the more powerful creatures, but even the weakest primitive creature, the copper-toothed beast, almost took his life. He had to rest for nearly a month before returning to God's Sanctuary.\nBy this time Han Sen had eaten all kinds of ordinary creatures around him, and it wouldn\u2019t help to eat their flesh any more. If he didn\u2019t risk hunting more advanced creatures, he would never evolve.\nWhen he was about to try to kill a copper-toothed beast, Han Sen saw something climbing out from the ripples of the creek.\nHe originally thought it was a black beetle, but immediately noticed something different: all black beetles had black shells, but a bright golden color caught his eye.\nHan Sen gazed at the creature climbing out of the water. It really was a black beetle, but different from the ordinary ones because of its golden body as big as a basketball. It was like a sculpture carved from gold, and its eyes were crystal clear, like gems. It did not even look like a living thing unless observed carefully.\n\"Why is this black beetle so strange?\" Han Sen stared at the golden black beetle.\nRecently he had killed countless black beetles and knew everything about them. Their vision was poor, but their hearing was very sensitive. As long as he remained still, even in close proximity, a black beetle would not notice his presence.\nHan Sen stared at the strange beetle, and unexpectedly, it climbed toward him.\nWithout hesitation, when the golden black beetle crawled next to Han Sen, he held down the golden black beetle's shell with one hand and swiftly cut into its fragile joints with the dagger in his other hand. He made six clean cuts vertically and horizontally to remove all six claws of the beetle.\nThe golden black beetle struggled and flipped over. Taking this opportunity, Han Sen pierced his dagger into a white mark on its belly and turned it sharply. The golden black beetle suddenly stopped moving.\n\"Sacred-blood creature black beetle killed. Beast soul of sacred-blood black beetle gained. Eat the flesh of sacred-blood black beetle to gain 0 to 10 geno points randomly.\u201d",
