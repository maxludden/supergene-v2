<h2>Silver Winged Beetle</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2025</h3>

<p>The xenogeneic looked like it had been made entirely from
silver. It sort of looked like a trilobite. It was, however, one
meter long.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw the trilobite-looking silver xenogeneic, he
frowned. In his dream, he had not encountered this xenogeneic.</p>
<p>“Is it an Ancient God xenogeneic that Dream Beast was unaware
of?” Han Sen remained in thought, not yet ready to take action.</p>
<p>He killed the Ghost Face Spiders so confidently because he knew
what they were. But facing something unknown was dodgy, and he
wasn’t sure he wanted to take the risk.</p>
<p>“Do you know of this xenogeneic?” Han Sen looked at Hai’er.</p>
<p>Hai’er just shook her head. “You should fire a shot into the
water. Perhaps there are other silver xenogeneics lurking
within.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. Without knowing what he was getting into, he
didn’t want to fire a bullet. Ghost Face Spiders weren’t
intelligent, so they were unable to discern where the bullets were
fired from. It did not mean that the other xenogeneics were the
same, however. Attacking randomly, without caution, could put them
in danger.</p>
<p>They were bound by the powers that governed Ancient God space.
While that did not affect their strength, their speed was
definitely lowered. Their reactions to danger would be much slower.
They couldn’t take unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>After letting silence settle in for a bit, Han Sen moved his
fingers. A red gas drifted out of his fingertips. A reaper
appeared, clutching a red crystal scythe. It took off flying around
the cave before heading for the pool of water near the
waterfall.</p>
<p>Hai’er looked at the red reaper with curiosity. She was used to
Han Sen possessing all manners of tricks, but she was still
interested in finding out what the reaper was capable of.</p>
<p>When the reaper reached the water, the water exploded. A
trilobite-looking xenogeneic suddenly emerged, leaping up to
consume the red reaper.</p>
<p>The red reaper’s reaction was fast, however, and it struck the
creature’s silver shell. The reaper was a powerful little thing,
but all it did was leave a minor mark across the shell. It
certainly couldn’t break through it.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>More silver xenogeneics leapt out of the water. They were like
cannonballs, shooting up towards the red reaper.</p>
<p>The red reaper’s scythe could not bear the brunt of such force,
and one of the silver xenogeneics was able to strike its body.
Fortunately, the red reaper was made of smoke. After the silver
xenogeneic broke its misty form, it was able to quickly recompose
itself.</p>
<p>But the silver xenogeneics weren’t going to give up, and they
repeatedly tried to attack the red reaper.</p>
<p>When a xenogeneic’s jaws closed on the red reaper’s scythe, the
weapon was bitten off. Then, more and more silver xenogeneics leapt
up to bite the red scythe itself. Not long after, it had all been
chomped and broken to pieces.</p>
<p>The red crystal scythe was the strongest weapon that the red
reaper had at its disposal. It was also its greatest weakness. Once
it was broken, the red reaper would disappear.</p>
<p>After the red reaper was destroyed, the silver xenogeneics
started swimming around in the water like a legion of crocodiles on
the prowl for human flesh.</p>
<p>“They have some very strong bodies. And not to mention their
physical power… These things must rank amongst the best of Earls
out there. There are dozens of them, too. This will be tough to
deal with,” Han Sen said quietly.</p>
<p>If he only had to deal with the silver xenogeneics he had seen
so far, he wouldn’t be afraid. But if the Earl ones were that
powerful, then the power of a potential Marquise one would be
unimaginable.</p>
<p>Han Sen rested for a bit, then recomposed the red reaper. He
sent it out to the water again.</p>
<p>The silver xenogeneics weren’t deep in the water yet, so the red
reaper swooped down on one. And then, the silver xenogeneic
sunk.</p>
<p>The other silver xenogeneics started coming after the red reaper
again. Han Sen turned his sniper rifle into a rocket launcher, then
he mounted it on his shoulder and fired it at the red reaper.</p>
<p>A group comprised of a dozen silver xenogeneics latched onto the
red reaper’s scythe, breaking it immediately, just as the rocket
came.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A white mushroom light exploded from the midst of the silver
xenogeneic crowd. The strength blew each and every one of the
xenogeneics away.</p>
<p>But those silver xenogeneics’ bodies glowed with a strange aura.
They remained inside the fire, and the rocket’s explosive power was
unable to destroy their bodies.</p>
<p>“That is a powerful protection they possess. Not even Spell can
break through it.” Han Sen complimented them. “Why are you still
standing there? Run!” Hai’er said, before starting to run.</p>
<p>The silver xenogeneics were traveling towards them really
quickly, scrambling over the stones. Their speed was
frightening.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move, though. He stood firm with his rocket
launcher, then fired another rocket at the silver xenogeneics.</p>
<p>This time, however, he had glazed the effects of Turtle atop the
rocket.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A rocket exploded in the middle of the waves of silver
xenogeneics. They had an aura around them, shielding them from the
explosion. It also protected them from Turtle, preventing the
symbol from sticking on them. It had been blocked.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could attack again, a silver xenogeneic flew out
from that belly button. It looked like the first one they had seen
in the water. This one had transparent silver wings, though. It was
able to fly very fast.</p>
<p>There were four or five of them flying out towards Han Sen, in
total. They soon reached the frontlines, soaring towards him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not fall back. He pulled out the Blood Feather Knife
and used his knife and sword power on the blade. Then, he slashed
towards the silver winged xenogeneic nearest him.</p>
<p>The knife and sword power hit the silver winged xenogeneic and
activated its armor, but that scary knife and sword power was
sufficient to break the auras and hew the body of the silver winged
xenogeneic in half.</p>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Silver Winged Beetle: xenogeneic
gene found. Obtained mutant Silver Winged Beetle beast soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy, but he didn’t have time to stop and look at
his new beast soul. He was running towards the nearest silver
beetle that was coming his way.</p>
<p>He killed one of the silver beetles that could not fly. Those
silver beetles weren’t mutant. They were just ordinary Earl silver
beetles.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was having fun killing the beetles, something
screamed near the silver statue. There was a silver, glasslike
monster coming out. Its body was over ten meters long. Its head
possessed a silver beard, and there were four transparent wings on
its back. It was already before Han Sen.</p>
<p>A silver light came out of its mouth, moving much faster than
knife lights and sword airs.</p>
