<p>“Ridiculous!” Han Sen shouted, pretending to be angry. He used
his king area to cover Nine-Headed Bird.</p>
<p>The water area shrouded Nine-Headed Bird, turning into a rain of
water that restricted Nine-Headed Bird’s body.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird didn’t move. He stood still with the umbrella
open, and he allowed Han Sen’s water area to restrict his body.</p>
<p>“Why haven’t you moved?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“I am afraid,” Nine-Headed Bird said coldly.</p>
<p>“Afraid of what?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I am afraid my strikes will be too fast, and you will be killed
too soon. It isn’t like I am afraid of the Extreme King. You’re
nothing more than a nuisance,” Nine-Headed Bird said in a calm
voice.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “In this world, everything has a cost.
If you ever find something that is truly free, please let me
know.”</p>
<p>“You are right. Although Pirates are never at a disadvantage,
it’s rare to find something as valuable as that orb. I might not
ever find anything like it again. I’m not afraid of going to some
trouble to obtain the Ancient God Origin.” Nine-Headed Bird smiled
darkly. His swordlight lit up, cutting through Han Sen’s king area
immediately. The swordlight surrounded his body, holding back Han
Sen’s water area.</p>
<p>“You are half-deified.” Han Sen looked at him.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird approached Han Sen, striding through Han Sen’s
king area as if it was nothing. An ominous swordlight glowed from
his umbrella as he got close to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I am half-deified, and you only have a first tier king area.
You might think that I will hesitate to bully someone so weak, but
we Pirates are not afraid of looking like the bad guys,”
Nine-Headed Bird said. He closed the umbrella and thrust it towards
Han Sen like a rapier.</p>
<p>The swordlight looked rather simple on the surface, but there
was a hidden swordmind in the strike. It hid the strike’s true
depth.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Original Water King Body and his body became
water. He shot toward Nine-Headed Bird like a water dragon.</p>
<p>Han Sen was driving toward Nine-Headed Bird’s body. Nine-Headed
Bird’s umbrella, which looked like a sword, suddenly opened again.
Han Sen’s watery form slammed into it.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen was thrown back. His water body returned to a humanoid
shape, and he was about to leap toward Nine-Headed Bird again when
a swordlight came down on him. The strike had been perfectly
hidden, and Han Sen didn’t see it until it crushed his body.</p>
<p>The water that had composed Han Sen’s body shivered, trying to
gather itself up again, but something was keeping it from drawing
together. Because of this, it remained spread in puddles, shaking
and twitching.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird lifted his umbrella and smiled. “My Split-Day
swordlight can’t destroy your Original Water King Body, but I can
keep your body from drawing together again. It might not kill you,
but it can seal you for ten thousand years. Prince Sixteen, you
should just give me the Ancient God Origin. That will save us both
the trouble.”</p>
<p>As he finished his threat, Nine-Headed Bird suddenly frowned.
Han Sen’s water had begun shining gold. Every drop of water had a
gold Kingese flickering inside it.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Countless waterdrops regathered, and the hidden swordlight that
had suppressed Han Sen was now crushed. The shape of a human
reformed in front of Nine-Headed Bird.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird squinted at Han Sen in surprise. “Your body
contains that much Kingese? How did you do that?”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t speak. The Kingese of his body were quivering.
His bones were roaring and shaking. He punched towards Nine-Headed
Bird.</p>
<p>When he punched, although there was no power in the thrust, he
had the support of the ground and the sky. Everything in that world
was shaking under the weight of the Kingese. He got a quiet
response.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird’s face turned grim. He put away his umbrella
and gathered up his sword mind. The sword was aimed at Han Sen’s
fist.</p>
<p>He struck, but at first, there was no swordlight.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>As the two strikes collided, gold light and swordlights went
everywhere. Countless swordlights fell like rain toward Han Sen,
sometimes making it all the way to his skin before the Kingese
would flicker and ping them away.</p>
<p>The fist and the umbrella ground against each other. The
powerful half-deified was sent flying away under the force of Han
Sen’s punch. His umbrella was bent backwards like a bowl.</p>
<p>Incredible power surged through Han Sen’s legs, and he chased
after the arc of Nine-Headed Bird, still throwing punches as he
went.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s attacks were like sea waves, getting heavier and
heavier. The power of each punch was stronger than the last. When
Han Sen had seen Ancient Water God’s shocking water power, he had
immediately realized that he could combine it with the Extreme
King’s Shocking Sky Punch.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird’s face changed. He kept trying to dodge away
from the string of attacks, but no matter how unexpectedly he tried
to move, the world answered to the beck and call of the Kingese
rattling inside Han Sen’s body. Nine-Headed Bird couldn’t escape
now that Han Sen had locked onto him.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>The fist and the umbrella kept coming against each other in the
sky. In just a few punches, the King class item was broken under
Han Sen’s fist.</p>
<p>“Shit! Shouldn’t you have called that the Battle God King Body?
This is so f*cking ridiculous!” Nine-Headed Bird kept shouting as
he fought.</p>
<p>He was a half-deified being, but he was using every ounce of his
power to hold off Han Sen. And still, Han Sen had him at a severe
disadvantage. His bones were cracking, and it sounded like they
were going to snap.</p>
<p>Xius and the others were watching the two fight in the sky. As
she watched the gold shadow slowly beating the shit out of
Nine-Headed Bird, she was very surprised.</p>
<p>“No wonder the Extreme King are one of the top three races.
Nine-Headed Bird of the Pirate is very strong, but he still cannot
go against someone with the blood of the Extreme King.”</p>
<p>“That king area, at its first tier, is suppressing the
half-deified Nine-Headed Bird. The Extreme King are scary!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird, upon hearing these comments, became furious.
He knew that Han Sen was much weaker than him, but the Kingese
powering Han Sen’s body were simply too powerful. The whole
universe and all its creatures were answering to Han Sen. His every
punch was combined with the power of the sky and the ground. It was
enough to surpass Nine-Headed Bird’s own power.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird was punched in the face. He was sent flying
away again, sputtering in anger. “F*ck you! If I don’t attack with
everything I have, you’ll think I’m nothing more than a housecat.
Time to show you that I’m a tiger.”</p>
<p>He shook his arms, and a black light glowed out of his body. His
arms became black wings as his body began to swell. He became a
disturbing black bird.</p>
<p>The weird bird looked like a dark cloud with nine heads. The
eyes had gold lights within them, and its claws carried clouds.
When the bird flapped his wings, wind and fire were summoned. It
rose overhead like some demon of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>As Han Sen’s punches rolled across the sky like waves, the
Nine-Headed Bird released a strange, vibrating scream. That sound
could break stone, and the sky seemed to tear under the weight of
the voice. The bird’s talons fell to intercept Han Sen’s fist.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The fist and the talons collided with each other, but this time,
it was Han Sen who was blown backward. The Nine-Headed Bird flapped
its wings and dove after him. The bird kept screeching weirdly, its
eyes like thunder.</p>
<p>Han Sen prepared to move forward and attack again, but the
Nine-Headed Bird just hovered in the air. All nine of its heads
were making strange sounds, like a demon mumbling. As the mumbled
chant continued, a weird black area covered the region.</p>
