<p>Yun Suyi let the flying tiger soar at full speed. It raced into
the clouds in less than a second. When she turned around, no one
was behind her.</p>
<p>“Hmph! You made me wait so long; you deserve it!” Yun Suyi did
not allow her tiger to slow down. She flew straight to the
xenogeneic island.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi planned to reach the xenogeneic island and wait for Han
Sen there; she was curious to see how long it would take for him to
get there.</p>
<p>Her jade wing tiger was a Marquise class xenogeneic. It was one
of the fastest Marquise rank creatures, so it wasn’t surprising
that she had lost Han Sen so easily.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi felt cocky, but when the other students of Sky Palace
flew past, they all looked at Yun Suyi strangely.</p>
<p>“I know I’m pretty, but you don’t have to stare like that,” Yun
Suyi thought.</p>
<p>After a while, though, she felt that something must be amiss.
She knew many of the people she was passing, and although she
rarely went to the xenogeneic island, she never attracted this much
attention on her way there.</p>
<p>“Did something happen to my appearance?” Yun Suyi touched her
cheek and looked at her clothes. There was nothing wrong with
her.</p>
<p>She flew for a while longer, and people were still looking at
her. She frowned and pulled out a mirror to look at herself.</p>
<p>“Strange. There’s nothing wrong with me; everything is as it
should be. I’m just as pretty—ARGH!” As Yun Suyi moved the mirror
to check her face from different angles, a mysterious shadow
suddenly appeared in the mirror. A smiling person was sitting
behind. It was Han Sen.</p>
<p>“When did you get here?” Yun Suyi turned back to take a look.
Han Sen was sitting casually behind her on the tiger, and it was
now no wonder why people had been looking at her.</p>
<p>Those people were not really watching her, though. They were
looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“When you took the tiger into the sky, I was already sitting
atop it. Aren’t you supposed to be taking me to the xenogeneic
island? Is there something wrong with me being here? Have I
misunderstood your intent?” Han Sen looked at her with a smile.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s wrong.” Yun Suyi blushed, refusing to look at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>It weirded her out that Han Sen had managed to catch up.</p>
<p>Not even Thousand Feather Crane or Yun Sushang could match the
Jade Wing Tiger’s speed. Han Sen had just become an Earl, so there
was no way he could move that fast.</p>
<p>In truth, Han Sen did not have that speed, but he did have his
rabbit shoes. They were faster than the Jade Wing Tiger, even if
they lacked the ability of flight. When Jade Wing Tiger took off,
Han Sen used the rabbit shoes to leap onto the tiger’s back. He
then hid his presence, so Yun Suyi wouldn’t notice him.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi was confused, not understanding what had happened.</p>
<p>Jade Wing Tiger was quite fast, and they arrived at the
xenogeneic island shortly after.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic island was comprised of many gardens, with each
one containing a multitude of xenogeneic creatures. They didn’t
look bloodthirsty, so it was like they were all tamed. Fitting with
the theme of Sky Palace, most of them were of the flying
variety.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi took Han Sen to her garden, and someone there welcomed
them. Yun Suyi told them to get back to work, then brought Han Sen
into the garden alone.</p>
<p>“What class of xenogeneic mount do you want? Available mounts
run from Baron class all the way up to Marquise. They are already
tamed, so they listen to people.” She was actually asking Han Sen
how much he was willing to cough up for a xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought and said, “The cheaper the better. Anything to
substitute for walking.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was still new in the geno universe. There were many
creatures in the sanctuary that had yet to evolve. Han Sen did not
need to waste his resources.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to kill xenogeneics himself soon, anyway, and
there was always the chance he could nab a beast soul mount. Those
mounts would be far better than a tamed xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my sister said I can
give you the lowest possible price. You won’t get prices like this
anywhere else.”</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “I just want one that can help me fly. I
don’t need one that is strong.”</p>
<p>When Yun Suyi saw that Han Sen wasn’t kidding, she thought for a
minute. “The cheapest flying mount is a xenogeneic called a Jade
Night Crane. They are in every shop, but ours are different. You
saw Brother Crane’s Jade Night Crane, yes? Normally, they are Baron
and hard to level up. But that one was Earl, and it came from
us.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Give me one of those, then.” Han Sen was not picky. It
was just a riding mount, so it wouldn’t be anything too special
regardless of how much he paid.</p>
<p>You should go and pick one yourself. We have thousands of them.
They are all the same price, and they are all just as good.” Yun
Suyi took Han Sen to the area for the Jade Night Cranes.</p>
<p>Han Sen was remarkably surprised when he saw the birds swarming
in flocks that looked like clouds. Sky Palace was a big faction;
there weren’t many places where you could see this many tamed
xenogeneics in one place.</p>
<p>Taming a xenogeneic was far harder than killing one. It would be
easier to kill an Earl or Marquise xenogeneic than to tame a Baron
xenogeneic. It was amazing that the Sky had successfully done so
this many times.</p>
<p>“Where did these xenogeneics come from?” Han Sen asked, looking
at all the Jade Night Cranes.</p>
<p>“Some were caught, some were raised. We will take you to
Xuanyuan Cave. There is an Earl there that you can tame. If you can
catch it alive, it will fetch a far loftier price than selling the
xenogeneic gene material,” Yun Suyi said.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the Jade Night
Cranes. If she was going to let him choose, then he might as well
make the best choice that he could. He was going to pick the one
with the brightest life force.</p>
<p>Han Sen scanned them, and he found one among them that appeared
to be extra strong. When he saw it, the creature was just lying
down in the grass. It didn’t appear to be as active as the
others.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi, seeing Han Sen look at that Jade Night Crane, said,
“That one is a Viscount. It was a Baron xenogeneic that was bought
by a Viscount. It was later raised to become a Viscount itself, but
after a grueling fight, its legs were cut off and its wings were
damaged. It recovered from its wounds, but it is still disabled.
Now, its flying speed is only Baron class. Also, it still doesn’t
have legs…”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi stopped talking, but it was obvious what had
happened.</p>
