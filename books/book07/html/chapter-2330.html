<h2>Understanding the Statue</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2330</h3>

<p>Because King Bai was still around, his statue was sealed.
Treasure seekers would have to wait until he had passed away before
his statue was revealed in the Pavilion.</p>
<p>The statue wasn’t being shown right then to avoid giving his
children the opportunity to crack the statue. Why that would have
been a bad thing, the stone didn’t say. As a result, Han Sen didn’t
understand.</p>
<p>The last king before King Bai was called King Bao. Not much was
written about him, just a few words that looked like default-text
instead. He had beaten a race and expanded the breadth of the
Extreme King’s domain, but the name of the race he had beaten
wasn’t even listed.</p>
<p>The expanse controlled by the Extreme King had been maximized
during the reign of King Bao, so there wasn’t much room left for
them to develop nowadays unless they could defeat the Very High or
Ancient God. There was nothing else King Bai could do.</p>
<p>In fact, the twenty kings before King Bao were all fairly
boring. They maintained the Extreme King’s power and developed
fairly slowly.</p>
<p>But those other king statues had all been claimed. This boring
and normal king statue hadn’t been cracked, though.</p>
<p>Although the King Bao statue was the latest to show up, not many
had attempted to understand it. Its plain look might have been why,
even though King Bai was known to have some genius kids, like Bai
Wuchang and Bai Ling Shuang. They were geniuses with a vast array
of talents. Bai Wei was talented, as well, but she lacked fame.
There were many royal children of greatness, just hidden away like
that. If they didn’t have what it took to claim the King Bao
statue, then it had to be special.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the three statues. He was unable to use his
Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a close-up examination of them. He
would need to use his own senses. Plus, no matter how many Pavilion
Passes a prince got ahold of, they could never come back once they
claimed a statue.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang had tried to open the alpha statue before, and he
wasn’t the only prince that had tried.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned toward the strange face of the alpha statue.
“I’ll give this one a try.”</p>
<p>Each statue had a different atmosphere, but Han Sen felt his
attention being snared by the gourd that the alpha king was
holding. Han Sen couldn’t tell if that was a good thing or a bad
thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of Bao’er, Han Sen cared a lot about things that
resembled a gourd.</p>
<p>King Bao’s name had a Bao in it, but he didn’t have any weapons
or interesting items in his hands. He looked so poor, and so that
wasn’t what Han Sen wanted.</p>
<p>King Wen didn’t suit Han Sen’s style. Only the alpha king
interested Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat down before the alpha king statue and looked up into
the man’s eyes.</p>
<p>For some reason, the oppressive aura of the statue felt
different when he was sitting down.</p>
<p>If Han Sen looked at the statue while he was on his feet, the
statue appeared beautiful and intricately carved. When he sat on
the floor, however, it seemed as if the statue was truly coming
alive. It was like a living king was standing in front of him,
looking at Han Sen with what appeared to be a smile. The emotions
it inspired were completely different.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He moved a little on the stone and looked
at the statue again. The statue was back to normal. It didn’t look
alive anymore.</p>
<p>Han Sen changed spots a few times, but the results were the
same. He could only see the statue’s living-type aura when he sat
directly in front of it.</p>
<p>Han Sen ran to King Wen and King Bao’s statues. They were all
the same. Only sitting on the stone allowed him to detect the feel
of the statues.</p>
<p>“These king statues are amazing. I wonder how they do that.” Han
Sen sighed. He returned to his seat in front of the alpha king’s
statue and analyzed the feelings inspired by the statue.</p>
<p>When he looked at the alpha, a strange feeling settled over Han
Sen. King Wen and King Bao’s statues gave Han Sen the feeling that
he was sitting before a god and a devil, respectively. They
thrummed with strength that could rattle the whole universe, and
the things they knew were very mysterious. It was like even the
folds of their sleeves were jam-packed full of knowledge.</p>
<p>The alpha king was different, though. He was holding a gourd,
and it looked as if he was smiling. He looked like an elderly
neighbor who would sit outside the door smoking. He didn’t look
like an all-powerful tyrant. Han Sen didn’t know if his mind was
playing tricks on him, but Han Sen thought the old man’s eyes
looked rather horny.</p>
<p>“This alpha king is very interesting,” Han Sen thought
curiously. He carefully inspected the whole body, not willing to
overlook a single part.</p>
<p>But no matter where he looked, Han Sen couldn’t discern anything
meaningful from it. The statue had a spirit, but there was no sense
of godly might. It was just very plain.</p>
<p>King Wen and King Bai’s statues elicited feelings that were
scary to experience. Alpha king’s feelings were very weak by
comparison. It was difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat in front of the statue for a whole day, but he was
unable to learn a single thing. He frowned. He didn’t know if he
should give up on the alpha king, as King Wen and King Bao had
enticing amounts of power.</p>
<p>But Han Sen really cared about the gourd. He hesitated and
stopped looking at the alpha king. He turned his attention to focus
on the gourd instead.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at it for a while, and he soon felt something
weird.</p>
<p>Before, when Han Sen looked at a statue, he had focused on the
king himself. The gourd was just an accessory, so there was nothing
special to glean from looking at it.</p>
<p>But if he changed his perspective to center on the gourd as the
primary aspect of the statue, then the king was actually the
accessory, and things looked very different.</p>
<p>The children of the Extreme King were full of pride. They
carried pride in every part of their lives, but it centered on
their ancestors. They always showed them a great deal of respect.
No one would even consider that the alpha king was just an
accessory or a slave to the gourd.</p>
<p>Han Sen was an outsider. He wasn’t one of the Extreme King, so
he didn’t share their thought processes. He really took the gourd
seriously. He looked at it as if it was far more than a trinket,
and by doing so, the entire statue took on a different meaning. It
was as if he was stepping through a gate into a new world.</p>
<p>As Han Sen channeled his focus into the gourd instead of the
king, his emotions changed entirely.</p>
<p>Realization slowly dawned on his face. The more he watched the
gourd, the more familiar he thought it was. It looked like Bao’er
before she was born.</p>
<p>“No way! The Extreme King alpha is holding a gourd, and the
gourd is a statue of Bao’er before she was born?” Han Sen thought
in complete shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen determined that the gourd was indeed Bao’er. The meaning
of the gourd became clearer. A mysterious air began to spread, and
it looked as if it was wrapping Han Sen up inside it.</p>
<p>“This gourd statue, it cannot be Bao’er who created it, surely.”
Han Sen continued to stare at the statue, his expression cycling
rapidly through emotions.</p>
