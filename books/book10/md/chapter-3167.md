When the matches started, Bao’er and Feng Yin Yin only used their gene races to fight. They did not bother going into the battlegrounds, so there was no reason to fear for their safety.

When Han Sen saw the small flying fish, which was under Bao’er’s control, enter the space battleground, he knew it would be difficult for her to lose.

Han Sen thought about it. He combined with the blood god dragon and went through the god light screen to enter the space battleground.

The blood god dragon was very strong, but it still hadn’t absorbed the blood dragon god pulse to become a God Spirit gene race. If he encountered an opponent with a God Spirit gene race, beating such a fiend would be an incredibly tough task.

Yan Bei Fei was a royal of the Yan Kingdom. There was no guarantee that he did not have a weird gene race up his sleeve. Therefore, Han Sen decided to take part in the fight. He did not want to risk being kicked out from the god fights in the first round.

Chen Seven was in a good. He made his king-class gene race ascend to adult mode. He was ready to fight in the god fights.

He did not have any lofty, high-rank expectations. If he could at least perform reasonably well in the god fights, perhaps the God Spirit he believed in would be more impressed with him. That meant he had a chance to receive a better God Spirit Blood-Pulse.

The god fights were only for humans to participate in. For God Spirits, it was like a trial.

The God Spirits could see their believers fight. By watching them, the God Spirits could measure the strength of someone and see if they had a bright future ahead of them or not. If there was a member of its congregation that did not look outstanding but performed really well in the god fights, they might be given a second Blood-Pulse.

Of course, it had to be a sensational performance. If it was nothing special, the God Spirits were unlikely to be tempted. Of course, that all came with the caveat of it being a very low chance of occurring.

Although Han Sen had the authority of a God Spirit, the God of Wealth only had Feng Yin Yin. He had already given her the highest-class God Spirit Blood-Pulse, so there was no need to test her. Aside from that, every time Feng Yin Yin won, the God of Wealth received some god power as a reward. The higher the rank Feng Yin Yin earned, the more power the God of Wealth could receive. If Feng Yin Yin won first place, the power reward given to the God of Wealth was quite shocking. It would have been enough to compose another god base.

It was a shame that even though Feng Yin Yin had the gold wing peacock king, it was unlikely she could emerge victorious as first place. So, Han Sen did not place that much hope in her yet.

Chen Seven’s target was lower. He only wanted to display a decent performance. When he noticed his first opponent was a nameless God of Wealth member called Ingot, he was delighted.

He was afraid to meet members of a famous God Spirit. Putting aside the 12 Annihilation God Spirit members, even a Disaster God Spirit member was unlikely to be something he could overcome.

Chen Seven investigated all the known God Spirits. The God of Wealth didn’t appear to be an Annihilation or Disaster God Spirit. It was also not a famous Destroyed God Spirit. He had never heard of the name Ingot either. Therefore, he thought he had a good chance of winning

When Chen Seven saw a white jade flying fish, which was about a foot long, appear in the battleground, he almost laughed out loud.

Obviously, his opponent was too scared to enter the fight and had only sent a gene race in. He kept his cool and made no fuss.

The small flying fish looked like something of a joke. It was tiny, and it had wings. It looked cute but being cute was completely pointless. Seeing its face, it looked like one slap would be enough to send it flying.

“Don’t blame me, Chen Seven, for being cruel. Blame it on the world for being too cruel.” Chen Seven laughed. He summoned his king-class gene race tyrannosaurus rex king. Facing that small flying fish, Chen Seven did not plan on entering the fight himself. He wanted to use the tyrannosaurus rex king to crush the small flying fish in a flash.

The adult body of the tyrannosaurus rex king was large. It was three stories high. When it landed on the battleground, it raised its head to the sky and roared. The roar was enough to shake the mountains and rivers. It looked like a mean and violent beast. It was a big difference compared to the cute, small, and docile-looking fish that merrily flapped its fins.

“Number Seven, you are the best! It is no wonder you are my son.” “Brother Seven, you are the best!”

“Son, muster the courage to bum rush the enemy.”

“Old Seven, murder that small fish. Do not play nice. Being nice to the enemy is being cruel to yourself.”

Chen Seven’s friends and family were watching the video in front of a god temple. They were very hyped in their support of Chen Seven.

Although he could not hear their voices, Chen Seven was exuberant. He commanded the tyrannosaurus rex king to rush the small flying fish. It opened its bloody mouth and tried to swallow the small flying fish.

Seeing the small flying fish about to be swallowed, Chen Seven and his friends and family thought it was already over.

In the next second, the small flying fish spit out some small fire. It was not much. It looked like nothing hazardous. It looked like the small spark of a tiny, freshly ignited flame in front of the tyrannosaurus rex king. It landed on the tyrannosaurus rex king’s nose.

Boom!

Suddenly, the tyrannosaurus rex king was burning. Within the blink of an eye, it turned into charcoal. It was like a black charcoal statue had been placed there, depicting a monster with its mouth open wanting to bite into food.

The wind blew. The charcoal-looking tyrannosaurus rex king turned into dust and vanished.

Chen Seven and his friends and family were crazily excited a second ago. Now, they looked petrified. Their mouths were agape, and their eyes were open wide. It looked as if they might roll out of their sockets.

They suddenly felt that the world was fucking cruel.

Chen Seven instantly reacted. In a whoosh, he departed the battleground. He was afraid to go any closer, fearing the small flying fish would toast him too.

“My tyrannosaurus rex king…” Chen Seven kept running away while crying. His heart was broken in little bits.

When Han Sen entered his battleground, Yan Bei Fei was already waiting for him.

His title was Flying Yan Swordsman. A knife was attached to his waist. The knife was called Flying Yan. It was one of the seven most famous knives in the history of the Yan Kingdom. It had been crafted out of the bones of a rare gene race.

No matter how good a knife was, it was useless if its owner was no good with it. Yan Bei Fei was a good knife owner. He had the Yan Kingdom’s inheritor Blood-Pulse, which was imparted to him by Empty God. He also had the power of a powerful gene race. Regarding his fierceness, the most important thing was the fact that he could use all of that at max capacity. Once it left its scabbard, the Flying Yan knife was something no one had ever survived.

Yan Bei Fei noticed his opponent was wrapped up in a red air that veiled his face. His eyes became blurry.

He did not know what his opponent was like. Seeing him combine with a gene race, he knew his gene race was different. To Yan Bei Fei, there was no difference. Even if his opponent had an ultimate god-class gene race, he could kill it. “I do not want to kill people today,” Yan Bei Fei said to Han Sen as he looked at him. He knew it was overwhelmingly possible. If it was possible, he preferred to not have to use the knife.

“I do not like killing either,” Han Sen said.

“Oh,” Yan Bei Fei replied. He said nothing else. He knew Han Sen’s answer, so he grabbed the knife on his waist.
