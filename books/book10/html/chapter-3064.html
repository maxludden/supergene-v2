<p>Although Han Sen’s simplified assumption of them being slaves
was correct, this was simply how the seven kingdoms of the universe
worked. It wasn’t as if saving a few slaves would ever solve the
problem.</p>
<p>Seeing these slaves, he noticed there were many children in
their midst. They were all wearing AI bracelets and AI handcuffs.
They were like cats and dogs being chased. Han Sen shook his
head.</p>
<p>Mister Yang watched Han Sen shake his head and sighed. “People
did not have high or lower tiers before. With God Spirits and
Blood-Pulses, there is now that distinction.”</p>
<p>While they were talking, they suddenly heard a little girl cry,
“Mother… Mother…”</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others turned around to look. A young mother had
collapsed to the ground, blocking the advance of the slaves that
were bound to her. The guard holding the whip went over to strike
her with it.</p>
<p>The young mother seemed to have something wrong with her body.
She was unable to get up. She tried her best to hold the little
girl who was crying and let the whip only fall on her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a hand grabbed the whip. After looking, it was a
middle-aged man who had been nearby. Judging from the way he
appeared, he also had a necklace and bracelet. He was obviously one
of the other slaves being sold.</p>
<p>“You should be more forgiving. Killing them earns you nothing,
and you are only going to impact the profits of the sale.” The
middle-aged salve let the whip go as he spoke to the guard.</p>
<p>The guard was always bullying the slaves. Now, one of the slaves
was standing up to him. He felt humiliated. He looked furious. He
cracked the whip at that slave and madly yelled, “I am happy to
whip you guys all to your deaths!”</p>
<p>The middle-aged man accepted a few of those whip strikes. It led
to the development of bloody streaks on his body. Even so, he did
not allow the whip to fall on the mother and child. He stood firm
where he was.</p>
<p>As this kept on going, the guard was growing angrier. He swore
and hit even harder, saying, “Fuck! If you want to die, that is
fine by me.”</p>
<p>His wrist was suddenly grabbed by another hand. He was no longer
able to whip.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” The guard saw that the person holding him
back was not a slave. It was someone who had just come off the same
ship. He was not going to be as horrible to him as he was to the
slaves.</p>
<p>“How much are these three people? I am taking them.” Han Sen let
go of the whip and pointed at the middle-aged man, mother, and</p>
<p>girl.</p>
<p>“You want to buy three slaves?” A manager-looking man walked
over and checked Han Sen out.</p>
<p>“Manager Wen!” The guard quickly bowed to the man. He behaved
really politely.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Manager Wen stared at Han Sen for a bit and smiled. “These
slaves are meant for the Seven Hearts Department. Normally, we
cannot just sell prebooked ones.”</p>
<p>“Then, just give me a price that is higher than what they paid,”
Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Manager Wen was happy. He knew he had met a rich guy on this
day. He thought, “Fat pigs that deliver themselves… I must scam
them a lot!”</p>
<p>Manager Wen told the truth. The slaves were meant for the Seven
Hearts Department, and transporting slaves always resulted in a
death or two. When the slaves were delivered, they would always
send more than needed. Those people were slotted in the replacement
reserve.</p>
<p>This time, there were many in the backlog of reserves. If
someone was fine paying a higher price, he did not mind selling
three.</p>
<p>“Mister, you are causing me trouble here.” Manager Wen decided
to scam money from Han Sen. He tried acting as if this was a
difficult thing.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Manager Wen and asked, “What kind of price
would not trouble you?”</p>
<p>Manager Wen finally smiled and said, “If you take them this
quickly, Mister, then I will just sell them to you for a low price.
I will go ahead and find a way to explain this to the Seven Hearts
Department. These three slaves will cost 3,000 king money. You can
just take them. If the Seven Hearts Department wants an
explanation, they can answer to me. I will shoulder the
responsibilities.”</p>
<p>“Three thousand king money is way too high,” Mister Yang madly
said. In the market, an adult slave normally only cost 50 or 60
king money. Even young ones were only around a hundred. Those from
a big slave ship were usually even cheaper to buy. Three slaves for
3,000 king money was grossly overpriced.</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. These are the slaves the Seven Hearts
Department wants. I am taking you a huge risk here by giving them
to you.” Before Manager Wen finished his speech, Han Sen
interrupted him. He said to Mister Yang, “Mister, give him the
money. I want these three people.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang thought he had been totally scammed, but if Han Sen
agreed, he had no choice but to give Manager Wen the three 3,000
king money.</p>
<p>“Mister, you are smart. If there is anything else you need, come
and find me,” Manager Wen said as he accepted the 3,000 king money.
His expression looked extremely happy.</p>
<p>er</p>
<p>It was just three slaves, and they were not worth much. Yet he
had managed to sell them for a hundred times the original price.
Manager Wen happily gave him the slave contracts for the three
people.</p>
<p>Han Sen accepted the slave contracts. Mister Yang gave them to
the slaves. He lifted the mother and daughter.</p>
<p>“What is your name?” Han Sen waved at the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saving me. My name is Jian Bu Gu.” The
middle-aged man waved back.</p>
<p>After hearing the name, everybody was a bit shocked. After their
reactions were done, the guard who had been hitting the slaves
looked disdained and said, “You are a slave, yet your name is Jian
Bu Gu. Are you not afraid someone will cut your head off?”.</p>
<p>The other people laughed and said, “This slave’s name is very
bold. He uses the same name as the tutor of the Big Qin Kingdom’s
king Jian Bu Gu. It is a shame you have the same name but live a
totally different life. One is a famous king tutor in the Qin
Kingdom, and one is a cheap slave.”</p>
<p>Manager Wen thought it was funny. “A slave’s name is Jian Bu Gu.
If he can sell for 3,000 king money, I do not care what he is
called. He can even call himself Sky God.”</p>
<p>While everyone was talking, Han Sen understood what Jian Bu Gu’s
name was. The king’s tutor was one of the three main officers. When
the king was too young or no one was in charge, he would assert
stewardship over the kingdom.</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu was not just a king’s tutor. He was the first
swordsman of the Qin Kingdom. Ten years ago, Jian Bu Gu quit. No
one had heard about him for a long time.</p>
<p>No one would have thought that the slave in front of them was
the first swordsman of the Qin Kingdom, Jian Bu Gu.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if he was the real Jian Bu Gu. He had never
heard his name before, but he could tell that the man was special.
He was quiet, and not everyone had that aura about them.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu examined Jian Bu Gu. She did not believe Jian Bu Gu
had become a slave, but she did think this slave looked rather
familiar.</p>
<p>Although Li Bing Yu had never met Jian Bu Gu, there were
paintings of Jian Bu Gu in Wu Wei Dao Palace. That middle-aged man
looked a little older than the person in the Jian Bu Gu paintings.
He did not emanate the superior feeling of the Jian Bu Gu from the
paintings. When she looked closely, the eyebrows looked rather
similar.</p>
