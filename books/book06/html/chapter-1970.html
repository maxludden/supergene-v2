<p>Yun Suyi stopped practicing and opened her eyes. The Jade Air was no longer coming from the walls, so she looked around to see if Han Sen was around. He wasn’t.</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t Brother Crane brought Han Sen down? Are they on the fourth floor, maybe?” Yun Suyi wondered as she made her way up to the fourth floor.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Han Sen on the fourth floor. Yun Suyi frowned and turned back toward the stairs, intending to search the fifth floor next. But Han Sen, Thousand Feather Crane, Yun Sushang, and First Day were coming down from there.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi quickly moved towards them, glaring at Han Sen, “I told you to come down when I left, but you were too stubborn. Great. Now, Brother Crane and First Day have had to waste their time bringing you down. The Jade Air is only released once a week. You’ll have to wait another seven days now.”</p>

<p>Yun Sushang tugged at Yun Suyi and said, “Suyi, it’s not like that.”</p>

<p>“What is not like that?” Yun Suyi asked with obvious confusion.</p>

<p>First Day said, “Mister Han leveled up to Earl on the seventh floor. We have come down together, now that the Jade Air has come to an end.”</p>

<p>When Yu Suyi heard that, her eyes widened. She looked at Han Sen with utter disbelief. “You really stayed on the seventh floor and became an Earl?”</p>

<p>Han Sen nodded. He wasn’t going to hide his power.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi sensed Han Sen’s energy. She was at a loss, and while she opened her mouth, she didn’t say anything.</p>

<p>It was unheard of for a Viscount to withstand the Jade Air of the seventh floor and become an Earl. It beggared belief.</p>

<p>“Let’s go. We can talk more later.” Thousand Feather Crane led the way out of the White Jade Building.</p>

<p>White Jade Building would erupt twice in a day, and then it would go dormant for another six days. Han Sen broke through with The Story of Genes on the first day, so he didn’t care about anything else. He hadn’t discovered the secret of the White Jade Building, but he would fine to wait until the following week.</p>

<p>Han Sen was just happy that he had gotten Spell to Earl class.</p>

<p>When they said goodbye, Yun Sushang stopped Han Sen and said, “Han Sen, Brother Crane and I are going to Xuanyuan Cave in two days. If you have the time, you can come along.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t oppose my participation, I would like to come,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>They set up a time to meet, and then Thousand Feather Crane gave Han Sen a ride back to his floating island.</p>

<p>“In Sky Palace, it would be ideal to obtain a flying mount. It would be much more convenient for you, even if you cannot fly yourself,” Thousand Feather Crane said as he took Han Sen back.</p>

<p>“Where do I find a flying mount? Can I buy one outside Sky Palace?” Han Sen thought that if they would let him bring in a xenogeneic, he could summon Little Star.</p>

<p>Thousand Feather Crane shook his head. “No creature from the outside can enter here, but we have a xenogeneic island to grow them. You can buy a flying mount from there. If it is merely for traveling, even a Baron class will do. It won’t cost much, but it would be better if you invested in one that was Viscount.”</p>

<p>Han Sen asked for the location of that xenogeneic island, and then Thousand Feather Crane left.</p>

<p>Han Sen returned to his room and summoned Spell, who had just leveled up. He wanted to see how she had changed.</p>

<p>Spell appeared in her womanly form. She flew into Han Sen’s hand and became a white sniper rifle.</p>

<p>When Han Sen used his mind, the white sniper changed. It became a white-metal weapon that looked like a rocket launcher.</p>

<p>“Damn! It has a fourth stage. Each one is better than the last.” Han Sen was so happy.</p>

<p>But Han Sen could not test out its power in the stone house, so he put it away. He cast a spirit light and created a spell that had power in it.</p>

<p>“I’ll find a place to try the rocket launcher later. What does this spell power do?” Han Sen thought.</p>

<p>After resting for some time, Han Sen planned on going to review the rules of Sky Palace. He didn’t want to unwittingly break a rule.</p>

<p>He had no flying mount, so he used his own power to soar. Fortunately, he was Earl class. Spell’s power was very strong as a result, and it was enough to carry Han Sen to the floating island that possessed the tablet.</p>

<p>Han Sen read the rules and tried to memorize them.</p>

<p>Wherever he went, knowing the rules was always important to him. Knowing the rules meant he could behave. And when he met new people, he wouldn’t be seen as an enemy. Knowing the rules sometimes meant he could receive unexpected help.</p>

<p>There were many rules in Sky Palace. Although Han Sen could remember them all, he still took his time to memorize each one.</p>

<p>He looked around a little, and then, a xenogeneic that looked like a tiger landed in front of Han Sen. Yun Suyi was on its back, and she jumped down before him.</p>

<p>“Suyi, are you here to read the rules?” Han Sen asked her.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi smiled and said, “I was born in Sky Palace, and I have read the rules many times. Still, I get punished. I could recite each one with my eyes closed, so there’s no need for me to read this thing.”</p>

<p>That means you have come looking for me?” Han Sen looked around. There was no one else there except for him.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi nodded and said, “My sister knows you do not have a flying mount, so I am taking you to buy one. The Yun family is good at growing xenogeneics, and so we have a shop on the xenogeneic island. I can give you a discount.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Han Sen answered.</p>

<p>“Let’s go.” Yun Suyi seemed to be rather excited.</p>

<p>“Please wait a little while; I haven’t finished the rules yet.” Han Sen went back to reading the rules scrawled upon the tablet.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi waited, noticing how carefully Han Sen was reading them.</p>

<p>“Is he for real? I am waiting right here, and he’s still concentrating entirely on reading the tablet?” Yun Suyi waited for a while, and Han Sen continued to read. She felt depressed.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of the Tenth Elder. Many men wished to get close to her, but Han Sen was ignoring her, and paying attention to stupid rules instead. He was so focused, it was like he was reading through a powerful geno art.</p>

<p>If Yun Sushang hadn’t asked her to be nice, Yun Suyi would have left already.</p>

<p>A while later, Han Sen finished reading. Then, Yun Suyi jumped atop the flying tiger. She smiled at Han Sen. “I am taking you to the xenogeneic island now. You should follow!”</p>

<p>After that, Yun Suyi patted the tiger. Then, the tiger spread its wings and flew into the clouds. It was very fast.</p>

<p>“I waited so long for you, so now you can suffer a little,” Yun Suyi thought with a grin. She’d purposefully left before Han Sen could get on the mount.</p>
