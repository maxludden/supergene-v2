  Xina flew a few thousand meters away, and she didn’t stop in her ascent She lowered her head and suddenly looked very shocked.

There was not even enough time for her to scream as the holy light gleamed in her frightened eyes. It had pierced right through her body.

Pang!

It was like a firework in the dark. The bone arrow punched through Xina’s strong Viscount body, and a second later, she turned to dust. There wasn’t a single fragment of bone left for retrieval.

“Xenogeneic Viscount hunted: Gold Feather Witch.”

Han Sen heard the announcement play, but he didn’t hear anything about xenogeneic genes. The bone arrow was too strong, that much was dear. Her xenogeneic genes had been ruined by the wretched power, leaving nothing behind

After shooting Xina, the Archangel Bone Arrow flew back to Han Sen and floated in front of him. It was glowing with holy light, as if it was awaiting a master’s acknowledgment.

Han Sen was feeling weak right now, though, and he had to exit super king spirit mode. When he did, his body returned to normal.

When his body returned to normal, the bone arrow stopped shining. It fell back down onto the lotus. Now it was just like a normal arrow. It lost the strength it had previously displayed.

Han Sen knew he could only control the bone arrow in super king spirit mode. In his normal form, he couldn’t do anything to prompt an awakening.

So, Han Sen picked up the arrow and walked around. There was not a single soul living across the lotus, and Ghost Eye was almost out of breath.

Han Sen walked over to it and gave it a poke with his bone arrow. A fist-sized green crystal came out of the rotten eyeball. “Xenogeneic Viscount hunted; xenogeneic gene found: Ghost Eye Beast.”

Han Sen picked up the green crystal and walked towards Lone Wolf. He picked up the xenogeneic genes and tossed their bodies down into the black pit.

Han Sen used the bone arrow to tear into the lotus. He managed to dig up thirteen crystal lotus seeds. They were each about the height of a person, so he moved them to the sanctuary and left the hole.

The lotus died pretty quickly after losing all its seeds, and it fell down into the bottomless pit. A day later, word was received that the hole had collapsed, sealing itself off completely. That surprised Han Sen, and it saved him much trouble.

Mister Tiger called Han Sen, and he was surprised to learn that he was still alive.

Han Sen told him he didn’t go down too deep, and that he exited long before whatever disaster had happened. He said he had no clue what might have happened down there. Mister Tiger was confused by this, but he didn’t ask anything else. So, Han Sen buried what had happened as deep as he could. He wanted to avoid the chance of someone learning what he had done and trying to kill him for his actions.

Han Sen spent the next few days investigating his body. His super king spirit was now called super god spirit. And aside from that, there did not seem to be any grand changes.

But his body had most certainly changed quite a bit. His super god spirit still had its indestructible status, and beyond that, no normal power could hurt him. He really was like a god that could not be harmed.

When he used his super god spirit, Han Sen could activate the bone arrow’s power. That was most certainly not a coincidence. He did not know the extent of super god spirit’s actual power, though. He wanted to give it a test, but after transforming, it only lasted a few seconds. And it drained him of energy after use, costing him way too much for casual activation.

The Viscount xenogeneic gene material from Ghost Eye was placed into a pot. The green crystal, just like the bone he had eaten previously, melted into a stew after an overnight boil.

Han Sen thought he might be able to obtain Viscount genes, but after having a sip, all he received was an additional Baron gene.

Still, after Han Sen drank the last of the xenogeneic broth, he had received an additional nine Baron genes. Not a single Viscount gene was obtained.

The Baron genes still aided in making his body stronger, though. It especially improved his eyes, and he could see much clearer now. His vision in the dark had greatly increased.

The bone from the Lone Wolf was something the silver fox seemed to like, and the little creature enjoyed chewing it and rubbing it. So, Han Sen gifted it to the thing.

“Using high class genes will increase a lot of Baron genes, it would seem. But it doesn’t look like you can skip a tier and start upping those points right away. That means that if I kill a few more Viscounts, maxing out my Baron tally shouldn’t take too long,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Killing Baron xenogeneics did not satisfy Han Sen’s needs.

Han Sen didn’t know if the Feathers would be disturbed by the disappearance of Xina and Lone Wolf, but after that day, many different races came to inspect the site of the hole. Many Feathers did indeed come to the city.

But everyone was clueless about the events that had transpired down there. And no one would ever suspect Xina could have been killed by a commoner like Han Sen. No one thought he was a suspicious fellow.

The city wasn’t safe, but at least Wizard could return to normal operational status. Qiao accepted a few missions and brought Han Sen along to slay a few xenogeneics. They managed to get Wizard back on the right track.

After a while, Third Master appeared again. They established a time in which Han Sen could teach the man a few techniques.

Third Master did indeed offer a high payment for the services, and money was something in short supply for Han Sen. It was the perfect opportunity, really.

Aside from the things that Qiao needed herself, Han Sen bought all the ingredients that they found during their escapades. He ate some, and he also gave some to Little Angel and Golden Growler.

He was still wondering how he might make use of the thirteen magnet fruits, though.

The legends said that after a commoner ate one, their geno armor would evolve a second time. They’d become a Noble or xenogeneic, right away.

That was an over-powered effect, for sure. A commoner with geno armor was a person with no hope. Only Nobles and xenogeneics could expect to grow.

Han Sen did not know if he’d be affected by eating one, as his Spell geno armor hadn’t evolved a second time. It was just a geno armor, though, and if he knew the fruit would work, he’d eat one.

After Golden Growler gobbled down a few more xenogeneic genes, though, his body started to evolve and he started to generate his own geno armor.

So, Han Sen brought him to Kate, just in case he was sent into the Big Silence system once the armor was generated. “Please evolve twice…” Han Sen thought, looking at Golden Growler as he generated his armor.

Golden Growler was not like Han Sen, and if it didn’t work, Han Sen could at least feed him a magnet fruit to see what might happen.
