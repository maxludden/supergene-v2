Second Uncle looked up at the man, who looked like a god, and thought of something. His eyes started to narrow. "Do you come from the god hall?" He looked at the man with a moderate amount of fear as he spoke.

"You have a little knowledge," the young man coldly said. He removed his hand from Second Uncle's head.

"You really do come from the god hall!" Second Uncle stood up. He still looked at the young man in disbelief.

"There is no need to speak much. From now on, you just listen to what I tell you. Me. God." The young man spoke with a lot of pride.

This time, Second Uncle stopped questioning him. He bowed and said, "How should we refer to you, Mister God?"

"Evil Lotus," the young man proudly answered.

"What do you want us to do, Mister God? It would be an honor to serve Mister God." Second Uncle's words suddenly sounded very subservient.

Han Sen thought, God hall? Does that mean the geno hall? Can the creatures from the geno hall come out of there? They should be able to come out. Otherwise, Sky Vine Radish would not have been damaged in the Space Garden.

"It is good that you are listening now. All you must do is work hard for me. After we are done, you guys will receive your benefits." Evil Lotus seemed to know how to play them. He waved his hand, revealing he also knew how not to damage them. The god light shone on everyone. Their wounds quickly healed. They were back to being as fit as fiddles.

"I wonder what you want us to do, Mister God," Second Uncle politely said.

"Just follow me." Evil Lotus did not say much. He just had the people follow him into the big barren systems.

Second Uncle and the others were worried. Evil Lotus might have been able to survive in the big barren systems, but they could not. If they went any deeper, they did not know if they would be walking out alive.

Han Sen and Meng Lie were at the back of the group. Han Sen quietly asked Meng Lie, "Fourth Uncle, is this god from the geno hall?"

Meng Lie nodded and said, "Let's not talk too much. Let's just follow him. You stay with Bao Ying and do not leave my side too much."

Han Sen nodded, but he saw Evil Lotus turn his head to look at him. He knew Evil Lotus heard them speak, but he did not care.

Evil Lotus looked at Han Sen, but there was nothing more to hear. They kept traveling through the ruins. It seemed as if he was trying to avoid something. While he was traveling, he went by specific routes.

Han Sen thought to, Weird. The guys that call themselves gods should not be able to be damaged, and they cannot deal damage to people and creatures of the universe. Evil Lotus and Sky Vine Radish are clearly different, but why are there these differences? Are they not the same kind of gods?

Evil Lotus seemed to know his way around that place. It was a very safe trek. They did not encounter any of the horrible xenogeneics that prowled the big barren systems. They reached an old city that was in shambles.

That old city was not just destroyed. It was half-buried underground. The gates to the city were only a moon-like hole. The rest of it was buried underground. The city's carved plaque of the city was still there. Three words were written on it "East Holy Garden."

Second Uncle and the others saw the three words, "East Holy Garden," and was delivered another shock. "Is this the East Holy Garden that the Holy Kirin of the four holy beasts of Sacred comes from?"

"You know quite a lot. Do you know about the East Holy Kirin?" Evil Lotus looked at Second Uncle.

"I have only heard about it," Second Uncle quickly replied.

Evil Lotus looked at the three words, "East Holy Garden." He sounded a bit weird when he said, "Yes. This is the place where the Holy Kirin, one of the four holy beasts of Sacred, lived. Sacred's four holy beasts were born a true god. They were different to you lowlives. They were born as superior creatures. Somehow, even such superior creatures were used by Sacred Leader. I never understood how. I have come to the big barren systems because there is information I seek. I want to learn it from the houses of the four holy beasts."

After pausing, Evil Lotus pointed at East Holy Garden and said, "Right now, I have only found the ruins of the East Holy Garden, and half of it is buried in the ground. I need it to be dug away. You guys will be the ones to do that. Within a month, you must dig out the whole of the East Holy Garden."

Now, everyone knew Evil Lotus only wanted them there to do slave labor for him.

Although they knew Holy Kirin's house might not be dangerous, digging randomly was just a recipe for disaster. With Evil Lotus present, they did not dare disobey what they were ordered to do.

Everyone followed Evil Lotus's command and started digging at East Holy Garden's gate. The soil and rock of the big barren systems were special. They were much harder than the stones of other systems. The soil near the East Holy Garden was like crystal or jade. With deified powers, they could not dig up much of the rock and sand.

"If I turn this soil and sand into treasure, it will be better than any deified treasure," Han Sen quietly said.

Bao Ying, who was near him, said, "That is impossible. The big barren system has some scary power that corrodes the place for unknown reasons. The substances here have changed. You cannot make treasures out of it. By using high-tech tools to analyze the substances, it was learned that the substances here contain traces of nuclear dust. It is very radioactive. If creatures stay here for long, they are affected by radiation and start to exhibit changes in their body."

Bao Qin said, "We are deified. So, we can withstand the radiation just enough, but we cannot stay here for long. Otherwise, we will turn into those xenogeneics. Our minds will be destroyed, and we will be rendered monsters that only know how to kill."

Bao Qin looked at Han Sen and asked, "Speaking of that, Holy Baby, are you born-deified? How can your power be so weak?"

"My race is not very good at fighting," Han Sen quietly said.

Dong!

It seemed as if Meng Lie had found something. The tap emitted a metallic sound. Everyone quickly went over to look. They saw that where he was digging was the gate. The door opened. There was sand inside it. For some reason, the sand there had become red instead of grey.

The light red sand had become more solid. Every hit made a dinging noise. The deeper he dug, the darker and harder the sand was.

After digging several feet deep, they saw the sand ahead of them oozed a dark red liquid.

"Argh!" Londo's cow feet touched the dark red liquid, which resulted in him screaming. He quickly scrambled away. In the blink of an eye, his strong deified cow feet had been melted by the corrosive dark red liquid.
