<p>Not even an elite like Shale could block knife lights that
appeared to have been generated by everything in the universe. The
demonic lion surged toward Han Sen, determined to push through the
tide of knife lights. He was breaking through the rush of attacks
like a dam against a flood.</p>
<p>“Impossible… Shale cannot lose a fight like this… No, no, no!”
Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng’s jaws were clenched and their nostrils
flared. And then, their mouths fell open. They were too stunned by
the sight before them to even make a noise. In their hearts,
however, torrential tears of sadness were coming down.</p>
<p>But their inner cries wouldn’t be able to save Shale. As the
knife lights flooded into Shale, appearing relentlessly from the
sky and ground, the demonic lion began to break. Shale’s body
couldn’t take it anymore. The moment the demonic lion broke, the
substance chains across Shale’s body were shattered by the flood.
The knife lights began to slash directly across his body, and his
deified form was dealt a river of wounds.</p>
<p>The knife lights were only half-deified in level. One slash, ten
slashes, even a hundred slashes, wouldn’t have been enough to
damage the deified Shale.</p>
<p>But these knife lights were beyond counting. Their numbers
appeared infinite, and as they attacked in ceaseless succession,
not even Shale’s deified form was able to withstand the stream.</p>
<p>Of course, this was all because of Shale’s deified body wasn’t
strong enough. If he had achieved true invincibility, it wouldn’t
have mattered how many knife lights were thrown at him.
Regrettably, his body wasn’t that strong yet.</p>
<p>Seeing Shale’s body inside that flood of attacks, with blood
flying everywhere, Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng almost collapsed to
the floor. Open Sky Elder and the others, however, were in sheer
euphoria.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer were immeasurably happy, too. They could
feel Han Sen’s knifemind with Under the Sky in operation. By
watching this fight, they had been able to learn Under the Sky
knife skills.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that scary flood of knife lights hadn’t come
directly from the sky or the ground. Not even a little. It was all
a knife light Han Sen had already cast. After it broke, it melted
into the sky, the earth, everything there was. He used the powers
of the sky and the earth to reconstitute that energy into knife
lights.</p>
<p>This was similar to knife silks but even better. The sky and the
ground themselves had become carriers for the knife lights. After
the knife lights were generated, they appeared in every element
imaginable. They had become far scarier than the pure knife silks
that Han Sen had used for so long.</p>
<p>The knife lights that broke and entered water, after they
regenerated to become knife lights again, would carry the water
element with them. When the knife lights melted into the soil of
the mountains, after they generated again, they would carry the
elements of the mountains.</p>
<p>But Under the Sky still relied on Han Sen’s own powers. It had
taken a long time for Han Sen to accumulate enough power in his
surroundings to pull off this attack. The more Han Sen used knife
lights during a fight, the stronger the knife light flood would be
when he finally activated it.</p>
<p>That meant this skill required a lot of time to prepare.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to unleash such a vast amount
of power.</p>
<p>“Under the Sky is decent. With this skill, Han Sen can fight
others of the same level or a higher level. If he can repeat this
whenever he wishes, he will be an unbreakable combatant. If he can
last a long time, then when Under the Sky explodes, others of the
same level would never be able to block this knife light torrent
that is absolutely everywhere. It was unfortunate Shale ended up
going against Han Sen,” Li Keer concluded with a sigh, looking at
Shale. His body was out of his control. The endless flood of knife
lights were tossing his body away like flotsam on the ocean.</p>
<p>“To beat Han Sen, he would have had to defeat him quickly. Han
Sen’s enemies will have to defeat or suppress him in a short amount
of time, lest they end up losing,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>“His use of Under the Sky is excellent. It allowed him to
completely dominate Shale, right at the end. It looks like I will
have to focus on training Shale against this power. When they fight
again, Han Sen will not be able to use Under the Sky knife
anymore,” Li Chun Qiu coldly said. He didn’t get emotional about
Shale’s failure. Instead, he analyzed precisely why Shale was
losing, and how he could further perfect Shale as a warrior.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed and then stopped. He didn’t allow the flood of
knife lights to rip Shale entirely to shreds. He raised his hands,
and the knife lights everywhere shattered. They rose and
disappeared. The valley was returned to the sound of silence.</p>
<p>“You win.” Shale stood up. He could still fight, but he was now
willing to concede to Han Sen. After standing up, he teleported to
someplace beyond the seal.</p>
<p>He knew Han Sen had dismissed the attack halfway instead of
using its full power. If Shale had taken the full force of those
knife lights, he would have been torn to pieces. So, continuing to
struggle was pointless.</p>
<p>Li Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen were kneeling on the ground. Their
eyes were frozen, and they could scarcely believe the result. They
couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>“What do we do? We have to pay back a huge debt, and the Open
Sky jewelry…” The minds of the pair were struggling to work.</p>
<p>“Just one knife skill was enough to mimic Sky and Men Combined
Together. This Han Sen is fantastic material. It is a shame he is
just a silkworm and not a genuine heir of the Very High.” Open Sky
Elder was delighted that he had won the bet, but he couldn’t help
but feel that Han Sen’s low status was a terrible shame.</p>
<p>After the fight with Shale, no other silkworm dared challenge
Han Sen. They fought each other and eventually departed the valley.
In the end, only Han Sen remained inside the seal. When all the
others had left, the seal was lifted.</p>
<p>At the same time, a square, bronze chest appeared. It descended
from the sky, carried by warm light, to land beside Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the bronze chest and opened it. Inside were the
seven pieces that comprised the Apollo Set.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t bother pretending to be humble about all this. He
put on the Apollo Set immediately. There was a helmet, an upper
chest piece, a lower torso piece, a pair of gauntlets, and a pair
of battle boots. Seven deified treasures now clad his body. The
chrome of the armor made Han Sen look like a mirror man.</p>
<p>When Han Sen put on the last piece of the armor, a giant, silver
pair of wings appeared on Han Sen’s back. They really did make him
look like Apollo, shining in the sky.</p>
<p>Many of the silkworms looked at Han Sen with great envy, but Han
Sen actually had the audacity to complain. “What kind of crap is
this Apollo Set? It’s like I’m wearing a light bulb. This makes me
stick out like a sore thumb. I’ll be brighter than the sun itself.
The enemy will see me coming from tens of thousands of miles away.
It’s not like I’ll be able to hide in the bushes when I’m wearing
this thing. It’s like a giant, bright, neon target.”</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was complaining, the Apollo Set did exude a
powerful aura. That made Han Sen very happy.</p>
<p>His half-deified power wasn’t enough to activate the full might
of the Apollo Set just yet, but it would still complement his
current standing. It could already generate a few minor substance
chains. And that was especially true of the Apollo Wings that had
appeared behind him. They gave Han Sen a speed that could rival a
primitive deified. He might have even been a bit faster than
Shale.</p>
<p>Han Sen spread the Apollo Wings, then teleported next to Li Keer
and Exquisite. His speed was far greater than it had been
before.</p>
<p>“This is similar to the power I gain when I use the peacock soul
robe. The Apollo Wings don’t give me as much speed as the peacock
soul robe, but the power of the Apollo Set isn’t fully activated
yet. Once it is used to its full potential, I might be able to
fight larva deifieds like Meng Lie.” Han Sen admired his Apollo
Set. He really loved it.</p>
