    <p>
      Goddess was in the Martial Hall of Sacred shelter, watching the Divinity’s
      Bout A man covered in holy light walked onto the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost everyone in the Fourth Sanctuary knew about Dollar now. However, as
      Goddess looked at Dollar, she felt that he seemed familiar. It wasn’t
      because she had seen his fights like everyone else; she felt that she had
      met Dollar before, but she couldn’t recall when or where.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural that Goddess couldn’t recall. She couldn’t link this
      peerless being with someone who was defeated by her dog in a single
      strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      And also, Goddess hadn’t given Han Sen a second look. Before she actually
      saw Han Sen clearly, her black dog had already smacked him into a wall.
      Goddess thought Han Sen had already died, which was why she could kind of
      remember his shape, but she couldn’t remember where she actually met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred’s master entered the battlefield and summoned a golden scepter into
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pair of wings on his back, and he was wearing a beautiful
      armor. The golden scepter in his hands was gleaming, and he looked
      fabulous in the outfit. He really looked like some god from a religious
      legend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the master of Sacred shelter, and he was considering how
      he could kill his well-dressed opponent without giving him a chance to
      concede the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone in Sacred shelter was a super creature, and Sacred’s master was a
      berserk super creature. Even if Han Sen’s super geno points were already
      maxed, he was still very interested in the beast soul and geno core of a
      berserk super creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Han Sen moved, Sacred’s master started to strike. He raised the
      scepter in his hand, and the golden crystal started to release a gleaming
      halo, covering the entire battlefield with golden light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was completely invincible under his super king spirit mode, so he
      wasn’t afraid of that golden light at all. However, when the golden light
      fell on Han Sen’s body, it felt strange. It was as if the golden light
      wasn’t giving out any forces, and it didn’t affect Han Sen’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he couldn’t be sealed or dampened as a super king spirit, he
      would still feel something. Even if it wasn’t destructive, Han Sen would
      at least feel something.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Han Sen didn’t feel anything, which meant the golden light wasn’t
      trying to attack at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen couldn’t tell what the golden light was used for, but he didn’t
      have time to think about it Sacred’s master raised the scepter in his
      hands and rushed toward Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen stood still, and when the scepter was about to hit his body, he
      raised Blow Blood to his mouth and blew it toward the master of Sacred
      shelter.
    </p>
    <p>Peng!</p>
    <p>
      Even a great being like Sacred’s master couldn’t handle the destructive
      power of Blow Blood. The bloody light went through the face of Sacred’s
      master, and his entire head exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next second, the creature’s head recovered as if nothing had
      happened. The scepter moved toward Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned a bit, and he hit the scepter with his fist. The giant
      force from his fist bounced the scepter away, but it didn’t injure
      Sacred’s master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred’s master noticed that his own power hadn’t been reduced much, and
      he was exhilarated. He dashed toward Han Sen with the scepter in his hands
      again, with that terrifying golden light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen defended himself against the crazy attacks from Sacred’s master
      while shooting streams of bloody light with Blow Blood. The bloody light
      hit Sacred’s master and exploded on his body again and again, but Sacred’s
      master seemed to be a true immortal, like some kind of god. No matter how
      injured he got, he could recover in less than a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was recovering instead of healing. When his flesh and blood exploded,
      his body didn’t knit itself back together, it was just instantly restored
      to its previous state. Han Sen realized that Sacred’s master was
      recovering so quickly because that golden light was helping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the golden sacred light, the master of Sacred could endlessly store
      his body, and injuries meant nothing to him. They couldn’t even weaken his
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No wonder the golden light didn’t have any attacking power. He’s using
      the power on himself.” Han Sen was a bit surprised in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dollar isn’t that strong after all. He’s just a little bit stronger than
      Sacred’s master.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dollar is indeed inferior to the Armored Man. The master of Outer Sky,
      who is just as powerful as Sacred’s master, was killed instantly by the
      Armored Man, yet Dollar can’t even break Sacred’s Golden Light.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he loses this battle, he might not even get the second place of the
      Son of God’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No wonder Sacred’s master is a top-tier demigod. Dollar is still too
      young.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dollar seems to be much weaker than I expected. He isn’t as tyrannical as
      that Armored Man at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think Dollar just relied on his geno core. Without his geno core, he is
      just barely a top-tier being.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can’t say that. Dollar hasn’t used his self geno core yet, so it’s
      difficult to say who will win and who will lose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It doesn’t matter, really. Even if he wins, do you really think he is now
      qualified to fight the Armored Man for first place?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fight for first place? The Armored Man will definitely be the first
      place, and Dollar is likely to be the second place.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred’s master was indeed a top-tier being, and he wasn’t at a
      disadvantage at all against Han Sen in super king spirit mode. Within his
      Golden Light, he was like an undying god, and the fight became quite
      heated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was quite interested in the Golden Light of Sacred’s master. He
      didn’t care what the onlookers were talking about. He put away the Blow
      Blood geno core and summoned the Six Paths Sword that Six Paths had left
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Han Sen couldn’t use the Six Paths Sword as well as Six Paths
      Emperor, Han Sen didn’t intend to practice the entirety of Six Paths’
      sword technique. He only simulated the last technique, Six Paths as One.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was only around sixty percent alike, the power was still
      terrific. The power in the sky and earth flooded toward the Six Paths
      Sword, and the power in the sword grew stronger and stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was pretty surprised. Other people couldn’t tell Han Sen’s power,
      but they were all very surprised that Han Sen was able to perform the
      blade technique Six Paths as One.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was conceptualized and created by Six Paths himself, and it couldn’t be
      used simply by wielding a Six Paths Sword. When Han Sen performed it, it
      looked very much like the real Six Paths, so everyone was amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the power in the swords condensed, Han Sen slashed toward the scepter
      instead toward Sacred’s master himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred’s master was scared. He didn’t dare resist the Six Paths Sword
      directly, so he dodged it. Six Paths as One could be used several times,
      and that was what Han Sen did. Though the power wasn’t as strong as what
      Six Paths himself wielded, it was still incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred’s master didn’t dare to let the Six Paths Sword hit the crystal on
      his scepter, so he conceded and quit the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Han Sen won the battle, many people lost confidence in him. Nobody
      thought that he could beat the Armored Man anymore.
