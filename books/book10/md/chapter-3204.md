  “Killed Annihilation God Spirit gene race Weapon God. Got God Spirit. Found Annihilation god base.”

The announcement sounded in Han Sen’s brain. It made him happy. Along with an Annihilation god base, he received Weapon God’s God Spirit.

He collected the Annihilation god base and had a look inside his Sea of Soul. He saw Weapon God inside his Sea of Soul as a God Spirit.

“In that case, this should mean I have two Weapon Gods,” Han Sen said with glee.

“Han Sen, why are you here? Furthermore, you destroyed Weapon God Temple. You killed one of the eight Sky Kings Weapon God. Do you not want to live? Even if you do not want to live, do not bring harm to Master Bao’er.”

Han Sen heard a familiar voice. He noticed a paper man running his way. He was around the size of a hand. He went right up to Han Sen, stomping as he shouted.

“There are many God Spirit gene races in the Chaos God Party, so does it matter if I eliminate one or two?” Han Sen laughed. No universe laws were hampering him there. Ergo, he was not afraid of anyone.

In the universe of kingdoms, he could not use all of his powers in battle. He also could not fight for long. Things were different there.

The paper man was obviously Rocky Dee. Hearing Han Sen say what he did, he felt even more annoyed. “You killed an average member, so that was no big deal. This was one of the eight Sky Kings. That was Weapon God! He was in charge of guarding Soldier Knife Sky, an important core member. If he died, our leader will be extremely shocked. I highly advise you to get Bao’er out of Soldier Knife Sky right this minute!”

“Fine. I will let you handle things in my stead.” Han Sen wasn’t after another fight with the God Chaos Party.

Even God Hall Leader could not get rid of God Chaos Party. This was obviously grave trouble. The reason he had agreed with God Hall Leader to come and check it out was that he wanted a god base.

Now, he had just managed to get his hands on another Annihilation god base. He did not have to go any further. He did not want to become the anti-scapegoat of the God Spirits.

He used Galaxy Teleportation to reach Jian Bu Gu and the others. The power in his body then exploded. He took them to the exit of Soldier Knife Sky. After that, he looked at Soldier Knife Sky and exited the area.

Back in the universe of kingdoms, Han Sen felt as if he had been chained and bound. He felt incredibly uncomfortable. It felt like it cost him a lot of strength to do just the smallest of tasks.

“It really does feel better to not have any burdens,” Han Sen said with a dismal sigh.

He sent Qin Bai and the others away. Han Sen went to his room and put on his Sky King Crown. He returned to his God of Wealth Temple.

He put the god base down in one of the sub halls. As this happened, the sub hall exhibited some changes that flipped the sky and the ground. There was a god altar, a god table, and a god stove.

Han Sen felt weird about it because there was a distinct absence of Weapon God.

“Does that mean that after I take the God Spirit, the god base becomes empty?” Han Sen thought. After he mulled it over some more, that was the only explanation he could come up with.

“If this is an empty god base, does that mean I can allow Moment God to use this god base?”. Han Sen tried summoning Moment God’s God Spirit and put her into the god base.

Of course, Moment God’s God Spirit was able to enter the god base. It enabled the whole sub hall to become bathed in god light. The gold altar had Moment God’s god statue.

“It really works.” Han Sen was very happy.

After Moment God’s God Spirit received her god body, she walked down the god altar. She kneeled in front of Han Sen and said, “Moment is greeting Mister God of Wealth.”

Han Sen felt a lot of power enter his Sky God Crown. The power of the Sky God Crown increased a lot. It must have gone up at least 20%. Clearly, Moment God’s God Spirit had become stronger. She was stronger than Decapitation Queen in the God of Wealth temple.

“Ha! Ha! Ha! I wonder which Moment God is the real one. Is it mine or the one that resides inside the geno hall?” Han Sen was secretly overjoyed. After Moment God established her things, Han Sen had a look at his god power. He, Bao’er, and Feng Yin Yin achieved a high rank in the god fights. They received a lot of god base power for the God of Wealth temple. They should have been able to make a god base.

After going to another empty sub hall, Han Sen was able to make a new god base. Han Sen’s heart jumped. The sub hall he went into had undergone some big changes. The god altar was floating in the air, and god table went up with it. The god stove started to form.

“Destroyed-class god base has been completed.” After everything was done, the god temple had a weird god sound.

“Is it only Destroyed class? Can’t I make a higher-level god base?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

“God base power is not enough. A higher-level god base is not able to be made,” the voice of the god temple sounded again in reply to his question.

Han Sen was crushed by this disappointment. After working so hard for so long, he could only produce a Destroyed-class god base. It was no wonder the God Spirits leveled up so slowly, despite being able to practice for billions of years. He did not know how much god base power he required to make a god base become Annihilation class.

“It looks like destroying god temples to get my god bases will be faster,” Han Sen thought. He was planned to go after the God Chaos Party again.

In the Moment God temple, Moment God frowned. When the Moment God statue appeared in Han Sen’s God of Wealth Temple, her heart madly jumped.

“What happened? How can something bring so much unrest to my god heart?” Moment God said to herself. She could not detect where the core of this unrest came from.

At the same time, in the God Chaos Party, Rocky Dee kneeled inside a hall. He lowered his head and did not speak.

“Rocky Dee, you are a minister. How are you keeping up with things? The Decapitation Queen Temple has been destroyed for quite a while now, and you have not been able to capture the murderer who destroyed the god temple. Now, someone shit all over territory that belongs to the God Chaos Party. What did he do? Well, he destroyed Weapon God Temple in Soldier Knife Sky. The minister is useless. You might as well just quit.” A strong man was sitting on a high throne, but he did not speak. He just calmly looked at Rocky Dee, who was kneeling in front of him. The one who was speaking was Eight Arm Evil God.

Rocky Dee did not raise his head as he coldly said, “Regarding Decapitation Queen, it was me being useless. But I am only in charge of foreign affairs. I only deal with things outside. Whatever happened in Soldier Knife Sky had nothing to do with me.”

“If it was not you, the foreign affair minister being useless, how could there be no news about enemies invading Soldier Knife Sky? If this was not your fault, then whose fault was it?” Eight Arm Evil God coldly grunted.

Rocky Dee did not continue explaining. It was like he disdained what he was trying to say.

Eight Arm Evil God wished to say something more, but the strong man upon the throne started to speak. “All right, Rocky Dee is one of God Chaos Party’s founding members. He has never done anything bad. He knows what he is doing. There is no need to keep going on about it.”

“Yes, Master.” Eight Arm Evil God hastily bowed and backed off.

The strong man looked at Rocky Dee while he coldly asked, “Rocky Dee, why is the murderer who destroyed Weapon God Temple still at large? Why has he not been killed yet?” His words were not cruel, but they still made people feel pressure.

Rocky Dee raised his head to answer. “Mister Leader, the person who destroyed Decapitation God Temple is a member of God of Wealth Temple. I would like to find out more about this God of Wealth Temple, so that is why I have not acted on the culprit yet.”

The strong man nodded. “I see, but you do not need to pursue this any further. Kill that person. How long will you need?”

Rocky Dee’s heart jumped. He had to say, “Please give me three more days, Mister Leader.”
