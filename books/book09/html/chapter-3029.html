<p>Qin Xiu’s God Spirit level and universe level were quickly
devolving. Even though he had combined with the holy spine and an
Annihilation class God Spirit, his level was suddenly lowered to
something comparative to a Disaster class God Spirit. He was also
getting worse.</p>
<p>Littleflower’s universe level was falling too. True God,
Butterfly, Larva… It kept going down.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader and the other elites were both shocked and
happy. Han Sen had the name Han Godfather, but no one would have
believed he had the power to defeat Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>Seeing Qin Xiu’s body’s God Spirit level drop from Disaster
class, the geno hall no longer protected his body. He stopped
hesitating. Han Sen used the strongest power possible to try and
kill Qin Xiu and remove the universe’s biggest threat.</p>
<p>All kinds of power that could destroy the sky and ground rained
down. It was all going to kill Qin Xiu. Suddenly, there was the
flash of a shadow. Qin Xiu disappeared. The space was broken by a
scary power. It caved in and became a black hole.</p>
<p>Very High Leader shouted, “Han Sen, what are you doing? If you
don’t kill him now… What if</p>
<p>he…”</p>
<p>Everyone saw Han Sen use one hand to grab Qin Xiu as he appeared
on the other side of space.</p>
<p>They quickly noticed something. Qin Xiu had taken over the body
of Han Sen’s son. Han Sen would not watch his son be killed.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, Qin Xiu is a demon that wants to destroy the
universe,” Very High Leader said. “We cannot grant him a chance.
Kill him now, or there will be consequences.”</p>
<p>Han Sen coldly responded, “I don’t care what Qin Xiu thinks, but
my son cannot be allowed to die.”</p>
<p>Seeing Qin Xiu’s body devolving, Han Sen grabbed him. “Qin Xiu,
leave my son’s body. I don’t care about anything more than that. I
don’t even want to take your life.” The blue light in Qin Xiu’s
eyes was very cold. He could not move because Han Sen restricted
him, but he laughed and said, “Han Sen, I never imagined you would
be able to reverse the blue blood gene power. That is a genius
move. I never tried it before, so that surprises</p>
<p>me.”</p>
<p>“Stop talking crap! Leave my son’s body!” Han Sen grabbed Qin
Xiu and kept using the Xuan Yellow Sutra power on him. He continued
to suppress Qin Xiu’s body and ensure he continued to devolve.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu laughed like a madman. It was like he had not heard what
Han Sen had told him. He spoke to himself and said, “I should have
guessed this. That is very good. I am so happy.”</p>
<p>ver</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to say something, but a grand power suddenly came
out of Qin Xiu’s body. In his eyes, which were once dim blue, there
was a light that was red. The blue patterns on the armor turned
red. The light was scarier than it was when it was blue. It was
like his whole body was wrapped in a red flame.</p>
<p>The light on the back of the wings had even turned red. It
turned the whole of space red. The universe was reflecting the
color red.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power struck Qin Xiu’s power. It was blasted away.
Their faces looked dim.</p>
<p>Very High Leader and the others were incredibly shocked. Anyone
was able to tell that Han Sen had learned the power that could make
God Spirits drop their level.</p>
<p>In the past, Qin Xiu was invincible. Now, he had Han Sen’s
power. Wouldn’t that make people hopeless?</p>
<p>uy</p>
<p>Seeing Qin Xiu’s power explode, his God Spirit and body levels
had recovered. Very High Leader immediately roared. He pushed his
Very High Sense to the max. His entire body combined with the
universe’s rule power. He became sheer pressure focused on Qin Xiu.
At the same time, he shouted, “Before he recovers, we must kill
him!” Many elites of the universe did not hesitate. They all used
their strongest powers to attack Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at the sky and roared. A shockwave of red blasted
out of him. It broke the powers wielded by Very High Leader and the
other scary elites. It also blasted their bodies away. The most
shocking thing was that Very High Leader noticed their bodies were
devolving. They themselves were dropping to butterfly class and
continued to devolve. Aside from Han Sen, no one else escaped that
power.</p>
<p>“It is all over,” a Very High elder said. His face was pale. He
looked utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>It was not just him. The elites of the entire universe knew it
was over. Qin Xiu had learned Han Sen’s power, and he was doing
even better with it.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Han Sen,” Qin Xiu said. “Without you, I would have
never thought the blue blood’s gene power could be used this way.”
His entire body blazed with a blue flame as he approached the geno
hall.</p>
<p>“I did not create this,” Han Sen said as he stared at Qin
Xiu.</p>
<p>“I know,” Qin Xiu said with a nod. “If I have guessed correctly,
this was done by Old Cat. But you are the one who performed it.
That is your achievement.”</p>
<p>“Get out of my way,” Qin Xiu said. “You cannot stop me. With
your power, I will break the geno hall and have its destruction
benefit you. I can make you become the leader of the world. I can
make you bigger than God.” “Leave Littleflower’s body,” Han Sen
seriously said. “I don’t care what else you do.”</p>
<p>“If you insist on trying to stop me, do not blame me for
forgetting your kindness of taking care of Wan’er,” Qin Xiu said.
His body exploded with a blood flame. He teleported to Han Sen and
tried to grab him by the chest.</p>
<p>Han Sen generated the power of the Xuan Yellow Sutra again. He
threw a punch at Qin Xiu. Two blood powers combined. Han Sen
noticed his Xuan Yellow Sutra power was going into Qin Xiu. It gave
Qin Xiu more power.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu grabbed Han Sen’s fist and calmly said, “You are strong.
I will give you that, but your power originates from me. No matter
how hard you try, you cannot be greater than me. In this universe,
aside from me, no one can really use this power. Do you know
why?”.</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen wanted to shake Qin Xiu’s hand away, but he
noticed his body’s power was not listening to him. It was like he
had been sucked in by a very strong magnet. He kept going toward
Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>“Because I do not belong to this world,” Qin Xiu said. “My power
does not belong to this world. And you, you belong to this world.
Even though your body has my gene blood, you do not have the power
to control the world. Old Cat spent so much effort and even died
placing his faith in you, but he will never understand his plans
were doomed to failure. He was wrong from the very start.” He used
his other hand to grab Han Sen’s forehead through space.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt his Sea of Soul shake. Destiny’s Tower lost all
control. It flew out of the Sea of Soul and went into Qin Xiu’s
hands.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Destiny’s Tower broke. The stuff inside fell out, including
Wan’er. Qin Xiu used one hand to hold her body.</p>
