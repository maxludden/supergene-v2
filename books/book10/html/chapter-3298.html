<p>Ancient Devil peered at the geno tablet for a very long time. He
then turned around and left.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been watching Ancient Devil intently for a long
time. He immediately followed him. As Ancient Devil was flying, he
suddenly disappeared. It was like he was able to slip into an
invisible tunnel no one else could enter.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked by this. He teleported to the point where
Ancient Devil vanished, but there was nothing there to find. At
least, Han Sen was unable to discover anything.</p>
<p>“Damn it! How did he manage to leave this place?” Han Sen was a
little depressed by this.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the location where Ancient Devil vanished started to
showcase a strong vortex that was spinning fast. It was like a
whirlpool that kept increasing in size. It gradually turned into a
swirling spirit power.</p>
<p>Han Sen was quite shocked. He did not think he had a chance, but
he was suddenly feeling hopeful.</p>
<p>He did not know what the swirling spirit power was, but he was
fearless at this point. He gnashed his teeth and rushed inside.</p>
<p>The swirling spirit power did not last long. After Han Sen
drilled inside of it, the power started to fade. It quickly
disappeared.</p>
<p>The swirling spirit power did not harm Han Sen. He felt as if he
was sent through a space tunnel. The moment he emerged from it, he
was shocked by what he saw.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil felt bad. Back when things had been rebooted, he
was able to be like big sky demon or Bury Path God, sacrificing
some power to live. He had not done that. Instead, he used the
rebooting of the universe as a chance to use a glitch while it
rebooted to be reborn and maintain his full memories.</p>
<p>It was a very dangerous play. Keeping the memories of being
reborn was difficult. Not to mention that, he did not even know
what kind of creature he would end up as. He did not know what kind
of body he would end up having after being reborn. He did not know
if he could end up breaking the world.</p>
<p>Plus, Ancient Devil did not know anything about the other
universe. Compared with others, the only advantage he had was of
his memories from his previous life, but the memories he had might
not work in another universe.</p>
<p>It was a big risk, but Ancient Devil still chose to be reborn.
It was because Ancient Devil knew the other universe had a geno
tablet too. Only by being there could he have the chance to get
close to it. Otherwise, he would have to be like Bury Path God and
break through the 33 skies with his power. It would be even harder
than being reborn.</p>
<p>Without the power of the leader, Ancient Devil did not think
Bury Path God could break through the 33 skies. So, he was taking a
risk.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil thought he was very lucky, and he was right. He
had a new body. It was weaker than a child of the universe of
kingdoms, but it had a lot of potentials.</p>
<p>The magical world of the sanctuaries surprised Ancient Devil.
The power and levels obtained in the world of the sanctuaries were
not high, but the effect of a body’s evolution provided a huge
effect that Ancient Devil could not believe.</p>
<p>The experiences he had there were useless, so Ancient Devil had
to grow up. He had to reach the zenith of the purpose he was
striving for. When he went to the geno tablet, he noticed what the
leader had once said was correct. If he was not Reboot class, he
would be unable to access the geno tablet.</p>
<p>He exited the 33 skies. Ancient Devil’s soul returned to his
body.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil had only just managed to break the world. With his
power, the 33 skies were very close to the geno universe, but he
still could not get in.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did have an item that he had managed to bring with
him when he was reborn. That item had to be used with Break World
powers too. So, Ancient Devil had waited until this exact day. When
he finally managed to break the world, he used the item to gain
direct access to the 33rd sky.</p>
<p>That item could only be brought into the 33rd sky by Ancient
Devil’s spirit. His actual body could not go there.</p>
<p>Because he was so depressed, when Ancient Devil’s soul returned,
he did not disconnect the treasure’s power. He remained frozen for
a bit.</p>
<p>At that moment, Han Sen felt the movement of the treasure. He
used that treasure to get out of the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s luck was impressive. He had a pure spirit body. The
item only worked on spirits. Otherwise, even if he felt the
treasure, he could not go back.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil only froze for a moment. He quickly stopped being
frozen and withdrew his power.</p>
<p>The item that had lost Ancient Devil’s power did not return to
normal. It was still shining with a god light. It was becoming
stronger.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Ancient Devil frowned and looked at the
black crystal floating in front of him. It was the size of an
egg.</p>
<p>That thing had followed him for a long time. It had never left
his side. Nothing strange ever happened to it.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil gathered up a Break World power and put it into
the black crystal. He wanted to stabilize the black crystal, but
his power was rejected. Ancient Devil was even more shocked by
this.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Ancient Devil frowned and looked at the
black crystal. The black crystal had a black swirl floating around
it. The black flame was growing stronger.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil weirdly looked at it. He said to himself, “Weird.
This item is the geno prototype replica given by the leader, but a
replica is just a replica. It should not have the actual soul when
it is just a geno prototype. It only has a few features of the
prototype. Therefore, why would it keep running?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ancient Devil thought of something. His face changed.
“Does that mean there was another spirit in the 33rd sky? Did it
enter the black crystal? No. Bury Path God and the others cannot
gain access to the 33rd sky yet. Not even someone from the geno
hall can access the 33rd sky.”</p>
<p>Ancient Devil looked at the burning black crystal. He had a
strange expression on his face. The scary flame wrapped up the
crystal. He could not see what was inside the black crystal.</p>
<p>Han Sen was as shocked as Ancient Devil at this moment. After
his spirit body when through the 33rd sky’s swirling spirit power,
he ended up inside the black crystal.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very familiar with black crystals. This one was just
like the black crystal before it became the black crystal
armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen almost thought he had entered the black crystal armor.
When he looked closer, he realized he had not. That black crystal
was not the same as the black crystal armor. It was like the one
Horizontal Evil gave him.</p>
<p>He was affected by the black crystal. The Story of Genes started
to run. It made Han Sen both shocked and happy.</p>
<p>No matter how hard he had worked in the past, his spirit body
was unable to use geno arts. Now, the black crystal was making The
Story of Genes run. Han Sen loved it. He quickly admired his body.
He used the power changes to cast The Story of Genes’ skill.</p>
