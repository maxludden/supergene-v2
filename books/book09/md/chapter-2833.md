  Fortunately, this is just a 20-year-old Very High Leader. If it was the Very High Leader of the present, it would not be so easy to trick him. Han Sen felt a modicum of relief, which led him to sigh.

Very High Leader stared at Han Sen and asked, "Can you really learn geno arts from just a glance?"

"Not quite," Han Sen casually said. "Some of the more difficult geno arts require me to spend some time researching. Simple geno arts like those I can learn on a whim."

"Simple?" Very High Leader could not determine what that meant.

Very High Leader had a strange expression as he asked, "For you, Mister, what is a geno art that is hard?"

"Like your race's Very High Sense," Han Sen said. "That is a very difficult geno art."

Very High Leader felt more comfortable hearing that. At least the Very High had one geno art that commanded the man's respect.

Then, Han Sen added another sentence. "If there is a way, I can practice it in ten days to half a month."

After Han Sen said that, Very High Leader could not help but feel angry. He coldly asked, "Do you really think you can learn Very High Sense in ten days or half a month?"

"I suppose so. Anyway, it would not take me any longer than a month." Han Sen looked at him with much disdain.

"Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's do Very High Sense. I have a Very High Sense geno art here. I will give you the instructions. If you can practice it within a month, you can do anything to me." Very High Leader was angry.

"Sure. That sounds like a good deal." Han Sen agreed to the bet, which made him more than pleased.

For Han Sen, Very High Sense was something he could only simulate 30% to 40%. A high-class geno art like that was really difficult to simulate. Learning Very High Sense within a month was impossible.

That sort of bet was one that Han Sen was going to lose, but he did not mind winning or losing that bet. With this bet, and the few hours that remained, Very High Leader would not kill the butterfly lady. That meant Han Sen would win his bet with God. That was the result he ultimately wanted.

Very High Leader was furious. He brought out a geno art.

It was a geno art that came with Very High Sense. It required Very High Sense as a base for it. Otherwise, one was unable to learn it.

Han Sen was not able to learn it with ease, but he did not plan on learning it. He only needed Very High Leader to not kill the butterfly lady for the rest of the day.

God observed this very interesting turn of events but was not going to stop it. When Han Sen and the Very High Leader struck this bet, God smiled and said, "Your skill at turning the tables is something quite magical. If this was the first time I had seen this, you might have won. It is a shame that someone already tried making use of the same trick before you. I am not going to lose to this same trick a second time."

"Who did this last time? Was it Han Jinghzi?" Han Sen asked with curiosity.

"It was not Han Jingzhi. It was that guy from Sacred. He was just like you. I thought I was already going to win because I pushed him into a losing position, but he knew how to turn the tables the same way you did. He went along with what happened. By doing so, he reversed the entire thing." It looked like God was trying to remember what happened. A small smile formed on its mouth as it said, "But you are too unlucky. You were not the first person to use this sort of trick before me. Therefore, I suspect you are going to lose."

"We have not even had a result yet. How do you think I will end up losing?" After saying that, Han Sen felt a chill.

"You are right. It is not the end yet. Perhaps you will lose, too." God nodded with seriousness. It sounded as if it was apologizing for what it said.

Han Sen didn't speak. He pretended to study the geno art that Very High Leader gave him. He wanted to know what kind of trick God could perform to promote a turnabout.

Han Sen didn't know if Very High Leader would kill the butterfly lady, but over the next few hours, he probably had no intention of killing her.

God did not do anything special to incite or lure Very High Leader. God merely started reading Very High Sense.

Very High Leader heard it for a while. Eventually, his face changed to one of rage. He asked, "Where did you steal Very High Sense off my race?"

"You are going to kill me, anyway. Does it matter where I stole it from? I do have a few questions, and I am hoping you can help me." Before Very High Leader could respond, God went on to say, "Very High Sense features a sentence that reads 'forget myself and I will become everyone.' What does that mean?"

"This is a secret of my race," Very High Leader coldly said. "How could I tell you that?"

God did not mind and kept talking. "From what I can understand, regarding forgetting myself, it is not really about forgetting yourself. It is like a give and take sort of thing. When facing benefits, we use our benefits to help others. We use our hearts to treat others nicely. That way, they will all treat you like family. That is why there is a saying like, 'forget myself and I will become everyone.'"

"No. If the other side only comes close because of benefits, even if they treat you like family, it does not really count for you..." Very High Leader tried to object.

"I see. Then, how about whatever possibility is true? How do you explain that?" God did not talk about the butterfly lady. He spoke about Very High Sense with Very High Leader.

God was just going to teach, but the question he had was that same as Very High Leader. He could not help but object to God. As they were both talking, Very High Leader had many inspirations. There were many things he did not understand, but he was now able to understand it all. His mind had improved.

Han Sen felt terrible. He thought he had found a decent plan to stall Very High Leader from doing anything brash, but Very High Leader was becoming inspired by God. His Very High Sense had become stronger, and he understood the world far more. He had become smarter. Or, he had become less and less human. He only followed the rules to do things now, so it was hard to make sure he would not kill the butterfly lady.

Han Sen did not understand what Very High Forget Love meant, but everyone knew the Very High did not possess the capacity for love. They could abandon their bodies to combine with the universe. What else could they give up?

While he was talking to God, Very High Leader looked more and more serious. His eyes looked very calm. Han Sen was worried.

What can I do? Han Sen was suddenly unable to find a way to overcome this. Everything God said followed some sort of rule. It made Han Sen feel as if he was in a lot of trouble. It was like rowing a boat upstream. Nothing was going well.

Han Sen understood that it was because God could control the rules of the world and the hearts of the people. Fighting it face-to-face was impossible. God could not be beaten.

Han Sen looked at the butterfly lady. He was thinking of something. So, I need to use my sword and fight tooth and nail to save this situation.
