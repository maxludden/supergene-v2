Han Sen was on his way back to Qiao. Mister Tiger offered to take him home, but Han Sen politely declined.

Since Han Sen had nothing better to do, it was best that he exercised, anyway.

When he went past an alley, Han Sen felt a searing burn develop on his back. It was like someone had thrown boiling water across him.

Han Sen was shocked. He could endure the pain, but he could feel it growing and becoming hotter. A red light burst out of his back, and not even his clothes were able to dim the brightness.

Han Sen could see there were quite a few people around, so he summoned his geno armor to cover his body. The last thing he wanted was for people to see it Unfortunately, the light was getting even brighter, and the geno armor itself was starting to glow red. Han Sen looked around and quickly found a public bathroom he could dip into.

After he rushed inside, his back released more and more red light. Eventually, his entire body was pulled back into the light. The red light was like fireworks, and then, there was nothing. The red light disappeared, taking Han Sen’s body with it.

Planet Roca

The officer threw a punch at Zero’s head, when all of a sudden, a hand came out of the red light behind her. It punched towards the officer’s fist.

Pang!

Incredible power was unleashed in the collision of both forces. The officer’s body was sent reeling back, out of the atmosphere and into space. He looked back at Zero’s red light, and the fist that had emerged from it.

A tall body came out, and when everyone saw who it was, they were so happy. They all exuberantly shouted, “Han Sen!”

Han Sen had no clue what was going on, but he was able to guess, judging from what he had just done.

“What happened here?” Han Sen looked at the xenogeneic beast in the sky. It wasn’t from the sanctuary, he knew that much. It was too powerful for that.

“The officer used his powers to open the sanctuary gate. Stop him, or the creatures from the outside will enter!” Stay Up Late shouted.

“Dad!” Littleflower jumped into Han Sen’s chest from Zero.

Han Sen saw everyone there was injured, and even Ji Yanran was holding Bao’er, blood streaking the baby’s face and mouth.

They each looked wounded, and that made Han Sen a very angry man.

“Officer, I have no grudge with you, and yet you attack my family again! Do you think I’ll let this slide again?” Han Sen’s power was frighteningly strong. The geno armor’s power exploded away from him. Inside the sanctuary, there was no other power to suppress him. The geno armor’s power was difficult to rightly fathom.

“Blame Han Jinzhi!” the officer said, before teleporting in front of Han Sen and punching him.

Han Sen felt a strength that was greater than a crystallizer’s come into him. His foe had the presence of a xenogeneic from Kate planet. Han Sen frowned.

But Han Sen’s fist did not stop. It hit the officer’s fist again. He punched the officer and sent him back into space. Then, he followed up and chased after him.

“Impossible! How could you achieve such power? The sanctuary should be kicking you out for this. Why?” The officer’s mouth gaped in disbelief. He had spliced as many mutant genes as he could to earn that power, and he was going to leave soon.

But Han Sen was more powerful than him, and above that, he could stay in the sanctuary. He had surpassed the system and was above the rules.

Han Sen wasn’t interested in talking with him, though, so he just threw another punch.

The xenogeneic was entering the sanctuary, and Han Sen didn’t think it was just a Baron. If it entered fully, it could most certainly deal damage to the entire Alliance.

“Dad! Hit him!” Littleflower was clinging to Han Sen’s neck, and he looked very angry.

This was the first time Han Sen had seen Littleflower so angry, and it prompted him to increase the volume of power he was delivering.

Pang!

The officer’s eyes watched Han Sen’s fist come for him. He wanted to punch it back, but he couldn’t. The fist landed on his jaw, and he was sent flying.

Before he went too far, though, Han Sen appeared above him. His legs were like an axe, and heaven only knew how many of the officer’s bones snapped under the impact.

Swing. Fist. Punch. Uppercut. Kick. Knee. Elbow. Han Sen became a killing machine, with his repeated attacks on the officer.

The officer could block a few punches at first, but more of his bones soon broke. And as they did, his defenses crumbled. He started to bleed, and his armor started to break.

“Han Sen! Quickly kill him or it will be too late!” Stay Up Late shouted, as he looked up at the black vortex. Half of the

xenogeneic beast was already in, and it looked ready to slip through the black hole any second now.

Of course, Han Sen wanted to get rid of it. Unfortunately, although the officer’s body was broken, he was not destroyed. He was still alive.

“You can’t kill me. You can’t kill me. I have the xenogeneic power. You can’t kill me.” The officer took another punch, blood spraying from his body. He laughed, saying, “When it arrives, you’ll all be dead. Give me Littleflower, for only I will be able to save his life.”

“No one can take my son away.” Han Sen grunted. The shape of a half-transparent black dagger manifested in his hand. He thrust it into the villain, cutting open his flesh and armor.

The dagger sliced open the officer’s chest. It didn’t kill him, though, and his body was able to recover easily.

“This is pointless! You can’t kill me. Give me Littleflower and I will save him.” The officer was angry, but he didn’t care much for the wound.

Han Sen looked at him coldly. And as he repeatedly stabbed the officer’s body, he asked, “Why do you want him so much?” “Because he… he can be the real… aargh!” Before the officer finished, he screamed.

“There it is.” Han Sen looked murderous. He used the Rhino Horn Dagger, shoving it into the officer’s brain.

Katcha!

Something was broken by the dagger’s attack, and the officer’s face froze. Blood oozed from his head, rolling down to his lips.

“No way… I can’t die… me… aargh!” The officer’s head cracked wide open. In between the brain juices, a black crystal had been smashed in two.

Han Sen raised his head and his face changed. The officer died and the black hole shrank. But the xenogeneic had already come in, and that was terrifying.
