<p>Han Sen found a golden bone inside her corpse. It was ten
centimeters long.</p>
<p>When Han Sen removed it, the body started to return to its
original state. The gold wings became white again, and the
claw-like bones of her wings and arms also withdrew. She was still
sprawled out, though. She was dead.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are in trouble! You killed them. The Feathers will
surely come for you,” Mister Tiger said.</p>
<p>“Who said I killed them?” Han Sen said coldly, looking at Mister
Tiger.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger froze, and Han Sen went on to say, “We assisted two
Feathers in killing the xenogeneic. An unknown race came from the
sky to kill those two Feathers and steal the xenogeneic materials.
You, Hardman, and I went to lure the xenogeneic out. We were in the
water, and so two of us managed to escape the attack.”</p>
<p>Mister Tiger thought about what he had said. And after a while
of silence, he eventually had to ask, “Do you really think that
story is going to work?”</p>
<p>“Can you kill two Feathers?” Han Sen asked Mister Tiger.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger shook his head. “No. I am too weak.”</p>
<p>“If you are unable to do kill them, then it is fairly simple to
assume that a commoner with geno armor couldn’t either,” Han Sen
said quietly.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger understood now, and Han Sen was right It wouldn’t
seem possible that they could have killed the two Feathers. No one
would assume Han Sen had the power to kill a Noble feather and a
xenogeneic Feather the way he had. Mister Tiger was still trying to
wrap his head around the spectacle he had just witnessed.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the river and swim a little to make it believable.
Then, we can report what happened to the Feathers. Can Black Gold
Group contact the Feather society?” Han Sen grabbed the blue
crystal tentacle and then jumped into the Black River.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger hesitated for a moment, but he still jumped in
after him.</p>
<p>Following Han Sen into the river meant that he was agreeing to
the scheme. But if Mister Tiger didn’t jump in after Han Sen, then
he would become Han Sen’s enemy. Mister Tiger was fairly sure Han
Sen would be happy enough to kill him just to ensure there were no
witnesses who could contradict Han Sen’s story.</p>
<p>That’s what crossed his mind. And so, he followed after Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not afraid Mister Tiger was a snitch, though. And if
Mister Tiger told someone what had really happened, Han Sen would
just return to the sanctuary.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had returned as the only person alive, others might
have grown suspicious, too. They were more likely to believe the
cooked-up tale if two people managed to return, telling the same
story.</p>
<p>After going downstream, Han Sen uncovered a neat nook where he
could store the tentacle. He then went back with Mister Tiger. They
called for Black Gold Group to protect the scene, while Mister
Tiger got in touch with the high level officers. They took the
incident very seriously, and they made sure to report what had
occurred to the Feathers.</p>
<p>Qiao had not left yet. She had been waiting for Han Sen to come
back, and when he did return, relief washed over her.</p>
<p>After everyone left, Han Sen returned to the scene. He dug out
the blue crystal tentacle he had hidden, and he used the powers of
space travel to send the tentacle and the bone to the sanctuary.
The Feathers wouldn’t be able to find it there, no matter what they
did.</p>
<p>After Han Sen went back to Qiao’s house, he found an opportunity
to examine his new beast soul.</p>
<div class="tables">

<!-- Baron Xenogeneic Beast Soul: Gold Feather Witch (Bow Type) --></div>
<p>Han Sen summoned it to play with it in his room. It was a
beautiful feather bow that looked like a pair of spread golden
wings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were no arrows. It was pointless to have
just the bow, so Han Sen put it away for the moment.</p>
<p>The next day, Black Gold Group told Han Sen to come to their
headquarters. The Feathers were in Gran City meeting with Black
Gold Group, so Han Sen had to come to the meeting.</p>
<p>Inside a room that looked like it was meant for interrogation,
Han Sen saw a Feather. It was a woman. And she looked remarkably
similar to the one had just killed. Han Sen had trouble
distinguishing the members of a race if they weren’t human.</p>
<p>But this Feather’s lifeforce gave Han Sen a grand chill. The
power she had was not at all like the Feathers he had killed.
“Miss, why have you called me here?” Han Sen asked politely.</p>
<p>“Tell me what happened, and don’t skip any details,” the Feather
said coldly, staring at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen was wearing his geno armor, she didn’t suspect
he was responsible for what had happened. She’d never imagine a
commoner in geno armor could threaten two Baron feathers. One of
them was a xenogeneic, as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already discussed what their statements should be
with Mister Tiger, so he was going to repeat that.</p>
<p>The Feather could not see any discrepancy between the two
accounts, and neither did she think Han Sen or Mister Tiger could
have killed the Feathers if they tried. So, they were off the hook
with her.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave Gran City for some time. If I have any more
questions to ask, I’ll be needing to see you. Also, call me if you
uncover anything else. If it’s useful, I will reward you.” The
Feather waved her hand, signaling it was okay for Han Sen to
leave.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen too much. Occurrences like this were definitely
not going to make him nervous. He left Black Gold Group in a chill
mood.</p>
<p>“Lone Wolf, what do you think?” The Feather frowned after Han
Sen left.</p>
<p>A man with a wolf head walked into the room, politely saying,
“Miss Xina, West Gran is a small place. The strongest faction is
Black Gold Group, and they only have two Barons. I have seen them,
and they are far too weak. They could not have been the ones that
killed the two Feather Barons. One of the Feathers was a
xenogeneic, too!”</p>
<p>Xina did not speak, and just nodded for him to continue.</p>
<p>Long Wolf went on to say, “And as for that human? Well, that
would be impossible. He is just a creature with geno armor. Hmm, do
you think their deaths are related to the item?”</p>
<p>“Are you saying someone else was drawn here by the same
information, and ended up encountering our people?” Xina asked
quietly.</p>
<p>“If that’s true, then the item must be here. We will have to
hurry.” Lone Wolf looked excited.</p>
<p>“It’s just a myth, remember. We don’t know if the story is
actually true. We don’t know its location, so we can’t find it,”
Xina said.</p>
<p>“If it is here, things will become strange once it is born. We
can wait here, we will just have to be fast if we are to be
rewarded,” Lone Wolf said.</p>
<p>Xina nodded, and with a murderous look, she said, “Continue your
Black River investigation. We need to locate this murderer. We
cannot allow our people to die in vain.”</p>
