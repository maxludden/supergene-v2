  White Elephant looked at the mountain with passion and said, “Abandoned Thief stole things from all over. He took a lot of treasure. If Old Turtle followed in his footsteps, he’d be nothing more than the crook. Still, he might earn himself quite a bit of treasure, too.”

Mister Elephant smiled and nodded. “I see. If it wasn’t for that woman of the Pirates that came here, I wouldn’t have learned about this. Still, we need to be wary of any who have had contact with Abandoned Thief.”

White Elephant raised his head and said, “Do not worry, Sir. I will help you get the Old Turtle, no matter what comes.”

Mister Elephant smiled, and coldly said, “No rush, though. Maybe we don’t even need to do anything.”

White Elephant wished to say something more, but Mister Elephant had him walk towards the mountains ahead. They didn’t scale Old Dragon Rock Mountain.

Half a day later, a pretty shadow neared Old Dragon Rock Mountain. It was going up the mountain quite sneakily.

It was Hai’er. She was heading up Old Dragon Rock Mountain. When she came before the wall, she looked around her and proceeded to knock on it

A rock that had appeared seamless suddenly cracked open to reveal a cave.

“This is it,” Hai’er said to herself. Her small body slipped inside and disappeared into the cave.

Then, the rocks moved again. Not a crevice remained when the stone closed up the cave.

Not long after, Mister Elephant rode White Elephant up to the wall. He looked at the wall that was inconspicuously sealed. “Mister, should we enter?” White Elephant asked.

“No. Just wait here,” Mister Elephant answered placidly.

After Han Sen had obtained two Viscount arrows for himself, he was perfectly equipped. He could easily kill Viscounts now, and there was no need for him to be afraid of them.

Still, Han Sen did not make his presence known. He remained hidden as he traveled to Old Dragon Rock Mountain.

When Han Sen arrived, he saw Mister Elephant and White Elephant standing before the wall.

Old Dragon Rock Mountain lived up to its name. It was indeed shaped like a dragon, albeit one that was looking up to the sky. Mister Elephant and White Elephant were up near its neck.

Han Sen used Dongxuan Aura to hide his presence. He hid himself in a nearby wood and watched Mister Elephant. He wondered what he was doing.

There was a stone wall directly in front of him, but he couldn’t detect anything weird about that. Mister Elephant was still riding atop White Elephant. Like a robot without batteries, it stood in front of the wall without moving an inch.

Han Sen didn’t move, either. Mister Elephant might have been a Viscount, but a higher class of Viscount would be nothing like Hawei.

Han Sen thought White Elephant was nothing simple, either. It looked like Mr. Elephant’s mount, but Han Sen had the sneaking suspicion that the creature was a scarier foe than Mister Elephant himself.

Han Sen was hidden in the woods, waiting. He knew that Mister Elephant wouldn’t stand where he was for no reason. Something must have been on the precipice of happening.

After half a day, the wall made a katcha katcha sound. And the wall that had no seams suddenly started to open. It became a cave that was a few meters tall.

Before Han Sen could spy what was inside, a small shadow suddenly appeared. It was Hai’er.

Hai’er initially looked very happy, but when she saw Mister Elephant, her face changed completely.

“Lady Hai’er, I have been waiting for you for a long time.” Mister Elephant looked as if he was smiling. He looked at her like she was a little treasure for the taking.

“Why were you waiting for me?” Hai’er asked, her facial expression remaining carefully neutral.

Mister Elephant didn’t change at all, and went on to say, “I have heard Pirates are horrible, evil thieves. I didn’t believe it at first, but it seems all too real right now. You used that innocent lowlife to pull people’s attention away from you, so you could go and look for treasure undisturbed. Most people would have been fooled, completely oblivious to the fact that you had stolen their treasure.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I have come here about a xenogeneic. There is no treasure to claim.” Hai’er stepped to the side, wishing to walk right past him.

But the elephant raised its feet and stomped the earth. Rocks broke as a shockwave raced towards Hai’er.

Hai’er jumped back, with her path now broken.

Hai’er looked icily at Mister Elephant. “Elephant, how dare you? Do you think you can bully a Pirate?”

Mister Elephant smiled. “Calm down. Zhenyues only light up one lantern in the hall. They say we are of a higher race, but compared to the top races like the Pirates, we are lowly. I wouldn’t purposely be rude to you.”

“It’s good that you know.” Hai’er hummed and started to step past Mister Elephant

But Mister Elephant continued speaking. “But the leader of the Pirates, the powerful Abandoned Thief, promised they would not enter the Dan Xuan system. You wouldn’t touch anything here. We really respect him, and we always take his reputation into consideration. If you would like to leave, I won’t stop you. But please, leave behind the item that belongs here. Do not tarnish Abandoned Thief’s name.”

“I see. You should have told me this sooner.” Hai’er looked as if she really understood everything, She pulled out a pair of gold eggs and presented them to Mister Elephant. She said, “This is what I got from here. You can have them.”

After that, Hai’er moved like a bird. She jumped atop a wall, wanting to climb across.

“Lady Hai’er, if you are going to be this stubborn, then I will have to be rude,” Mister Elephant said in a hard voice. Then, White Elephant lifted its trunk, which struck directly toward Hai’er like a white snake.

Hai’er’s toes stepped across the wall, and she tried to dodge, but the trunk was too fast. Before she could dodge, it snared her body, wrapped her up, and pulled her down.

When Hai’er was captured by the White Elephant, a katcha noise sounded from the stone wall. The rocks opened up again, and a red shadow flew out It landed right near Hai’er.
