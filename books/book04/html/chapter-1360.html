    <p>
      Han Sen was taken aback when he saw what emerged from his Sea of Soul. It
      was an umbrella. It was thin-framed and elegant, like the sort you’d see
      fancy women use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its color was blacker than the filthiest coal, though. Even its handle
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the umbrella appeared, it flew above Han Sen’s head. Beneath this
      umbrella, Han Sen felt a veil or shroud envelope him.
    </p>
    <p>The cold and the shriek were gone.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen noticed, if he was able to stay within the umbrella’s covering
      radius, all the negative and detrimental effects were filtered and kept
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is this the geno core of the Dongxuan Sutra?” Han Sen quickly reviewed
      the information of the geno core.
    </p>
    <p>Self Geno Core: Bronze Bulwark Umbrella</p>
    <p>
      Beneath the protective canopy of the Bulwark Umbrella, no power was able
      to breach the defense and ravage them. Bao’er had returned to normal, and
      she seemed surprised by the sudden disappearance of the cold and sound.
      She examined the umbrella that now shielded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen went over to check on the Dragon Lady and Cheap Sheep. The lady
      was now doing fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheep was breathing in a raspy wheeze. It looked like the umbrella had
      manifested just in time, as the sheep had to have been hanging on to its
      life by a measly thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen healed Dragon Lady and Cheap Sheep as best he could for the time
      being. For the Dragon Lady, chunks of ice and frosty air were expelled
      from her mouth and various orifices. She was doing well, but the same
      could not be said for Cheap Sheep. He was doing poorly, despite the
      healing. He couldn’t even speak.
    </p>
    <p>“Are they gone?” Dragon Lady said, with a strained voice.</p>
    <p>“Not yet,” Han Sen replied, taking a look outside the bowl.</p>
    <p>
      She couldn’t sense anything outside, but that may have been a result of
      her condition. Han Sen, however, even though he could not detect much,
      could just feel a battle continuing to rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the Bulwark Umbrella had appeared to protect them when it
      did. With relief for their newfound safety, the group rested for a while
      as Han Sen tended to the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, a sound that was as loud as a toppled mountain was heard.
      And then, a soft and unnerving silence enveloped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It sounds as if there might have been a victor,” Han Sen thought to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn’t yet going to move from where he was, though. He didn’t know who
      was fighting or what the fighting was about. If he emerged, and the winner
      was in a foul mood, he’d be foolish to reveal himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, they waited where they were for a few hours. Nothing stirred for the
      duration of that time.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen decided to return the umbrella, and Dragon Lady her bowl.</p>
    <p>
      To cut and shovel their way through the snow that had almost buried them,
      Dragon Lady employed her various kitchen utensils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything around them was white. The mountains, the trees, the fields;
      all of it was perfectly blanketed in virgin snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That was scary,” Han Sen thought to himself, now that their frightening
      ordeal was over. If it wasn’t for the Bulwark Umbrella, they’d be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wondered if the shelter Dragon Lady had mentioned might have
      suffered the same freezing fate. If it had, it was very likely the
      occupants of the shelter would not have survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen hurried Dragon Lady to guide them to the shelter, but not out of
      concern for the inhabitants. Had they all died, it’d make for great, easy
      pickings. There’d be plenty of flesh and geno cores for the taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady started taking them there, but it was a struggle. The
      landscape was vastly different now, having been buried by so much snow,
      and she feared that she might lead them astray
    </p>
    <p>For a thousand miles, the snow lay thick across the land.</p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady had decided to find the shelter by choosing a direction and
      following it, as a crow would fly. But it was difficult for them, for
      they’d have to dig an entire trench that led there. The snow was too thick
      and too soft for them to delicately journey across.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen really wanted the treasure, though. And after a few hundred miles
      of non-stop walking, they thought they should have been close.
      Unfortunately for them, they were lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at least they were not in danger. It seemed as if the snow had reset
      the land, and everything within the snowglobe radius had been killed.
      There was nothing left alive to threaten them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind, then. Forget the shelter. Let’s just get out of this place;
      there’s nothing else for us here,” Han Sen said, with a dismal tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They selected a new direction and decided on leaving the snow-devastated
      landscape behind, opting to find fonder pastures. After a thousand miles
      of walking, they discovered nothing. They might as well have been back
      where they started, for each horizon was another line of white.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, wait a minute! Something is up ahead.” Cheap Sheep, who was doing
      better now, drew their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Dragon Lady climbed a slope that the sheep had pointed to, and
      there, in the snow, was an anomaly.
    </p>
    <p>Looking closer, they realized it was a tree.</p>
    <p>
      “Let’s take a look. If it survived when everything else didn’t, it must be
      something pretty special. If it bears fruit, we’re rich!” Han Sen quickly
      jumped before it, ensuring he’d be the first to grab its treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tree was ten meters tall, and pink flowers dressed the branches. It
      was like an oversized, pink bonsai. It possessed a lovely scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange, seeing this tree stand out amongst the snow that had
      covered everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if it had a Bulwark Umbrella of its own, it seemed as if the tree had
      been shielded by some force that provided it a radius of protection. There
      was no snow circling it on the ground, either, and you could see the grass
      below as clear as day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few creatures beneath the tree, as well. Han Sen imagined
      they had been hiding there, using the eaves for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the tree must have only protected them from the cold and
      snow, but not the noise. The creatures looked as if they were drunk,
      falling asleep.
