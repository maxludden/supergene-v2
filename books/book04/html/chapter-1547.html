    <p>
      Han Sen increased his pace, leaving Six Paths behind. Six Paths was
      getting far too tired, and he slowed down. With him slowing down and Han
      Sen speeding up, the distance between the two greatly increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths frowned. He didn’t let Han Sen’s progress affect him, though,
      and he continued at the pace he himself was most comfortable with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Yu Miao and Little Lion King saw the two, they were shocked. They
      found it all hard to believe. They were shocked that Han Sen could not
      only keep up with Six Paths, he could go further and faster. And Han Sen’s
      pace was actually accelerating, not slowing down.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had never seen anything like this before. Witnessing someone simply
      reaching the eighteenth Godlight was a supremely rare occurrence. It
      shocked them a lot to see Han Sen actually managing to speed up after
      going through it. They could not believe their eyes, and they thought it
      was a dream of some kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rubbed their eyes to double-check, and they realized they weren’t
      wrong. Han Sen was speeding up. He had been walking, but now he was going
      at a steady jog. He was nearing the nineteenth Godlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao and Little Lion King were too shocked to speak. Never in their
      wildest dreams could they picture someone jogging through the eighteenth
      portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s no wonder he beat me. He really is special!” Little Lion King wasn’t
      upset he had lost the bet. He felt as if it was within expectations that
      he had lost to Han Sen. Truth be told, he was actually a little glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao did not say anything. Her lips only trembled as she stared at Han
      Sen in the distance, who was still jogging.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is this possible… He is just a human. Just a human!” Yu Miao’s mood
      was a complicated one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not long after, Han Sen breached the nineteenth curtain of light. His
      speed did not slow down. He was getting quicker, going at the pace of a
      kid that was racing home after school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was still walking forward slowly, and he struggled with each
      step he took. Still, despite the struggle, he too managed to reach the
      nineteenth Godlight. He had simply gone slower than Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths looked determined. He continued at his own speed, and although
      his clothes were soaked with sweat, they weren’t stopping him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Six Paths was like a sword, a fearless sword. It did not matter what
      trouble or hardship lay ahead, nothing would make him quit his arduous
      struggle to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Six Paths passed through the nineteenth Godlight, Han Sen’s body
      suddenly disappeared at the end of the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Godlight Tunnel had nineteen Godlights that illuminated the entirety
      of the tunnel. Strangely, though, the far end was dark. No one knew what
      lay behind that curtain of black because no one had entered before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Han Sen had gone inside with ease, it made Six Paths’ eyes shine
      with zeal. Han Sen being there made him want to go and reach the end with
      a greater vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He reached the end of the tunnel.” They expected this would happen, but
      Yu Miao was still extremely shocked to see Han Sen reach the end and
      disappear into the darkness there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know how many years God’s Ruin had existed and how many
      creatures had become super there. Many super creatures and spirits that
      emerged from that place went on to become leaders elsewhere in the
      sanctuary. Some of them went on to be emperors or even berserk super
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, none of those had ever reached the end of the tunnel before. The
      eighteenth Godlight was the farthest a demigod had ever reached. Not many
      people could approach the nineteenth Godlight. Those that could were
      similar to Six Paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no matter how good they were or how talented they were, none could
      reach the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was just a human, and he had almost reached the end. And what’s
      more, he hadn’t struggled. He had freely run there. Yu Miao would claim
      such a story to be preposterous, had she not seen it with her own two
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew if she told the story to other spirits, they would not believe
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What kind of person is he? Can humans truly accomplish such a feat?” Yu
      Miao’s head was totally messed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s no wonder he became my boss. He is strong. He is too strong. This
      has never happened before.” Little Lion King’s eyes were opened wide. He
      did not think it was a shame to make Han Sen his boss. And he even found
      himself referring to him as boss already.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now trying to think of what benefits he might reap, having come
      into the service of Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was like an indestructible sword, approaching the end. Each step
      was solid, as if nothing in the universe could halt his advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One step. Two steps. Three steps. Six Paths was getting close to the
      finish line. He was close to the darkness at the tunnel’s end, and that
      was all he could see now.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Little Lion King and Yu Miao calmed down a bit, they then turned
      their attention to Six Paths. They wanted to see if Six Paths could also
      reach the end of the Godlight Tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was getting closer and closer to that darkness, but he was
      slowing down. Each step was slower than the next due to the increasing
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The powerful Godlight was something not even Six Paths could shirk. The
      weight was really starting to pile up.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      The tunnel’s floor had been shining with the Godlight for
      who-knew-how-long. It was believed to be indestructible, but it was
      cracking beneath Six Paths feet.
    </p>
    <p>Every step he took left a crater-like footprint in the stone below.</p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was less than a hundred meters away from the nineteenth
      Godlight, and aside from Han Sen, no one had ever come this far before.
      But Six Paths wanted more than this. He wanted to reach the black, just
      like Han Sen had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lion King and Yu Miao stared at Six Paths. It was not as if they
      were the ones there, but they were excited to watch, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      One step. Two steps. Three steps. Six Paths’ body felt sharper and
      sharper, and he no longer felt like a person. He felt as if he was a
      walking sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Almost there. Only ten meters to go.” Yu Miao clenched her fists in
      anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood inside Six Paths’ body began to seep out of his skin, making him
      look like a red sword. Every step Six Paths took made him bleed more
      profusely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hold on. Just a few steps left to go.” Yu Miao wanted Six Paths to reach
      the end, as that would make her feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths was wholly dyed red. He was incredibly slow, but he was directly
      before the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light and the dark painted two worlds side-by-side. Six Paths was
      standing in front of the black wall that separated the two. He couldn’t
      see anything yet, but he still had to take one last step before entering.
    </p>
    <p>But Six Paths just stood where he was, unable to make the last step.</p>
    <p>“Get in!” Yu Miao shouted out in her heart.</p>
    <p>
      Six Paths’ heart was screaming, too. The scary swordlight was encompassing
      his entire body, but if he took one more step into the darkness, he was
      afraid he would shatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horrible Godlight suppressed his entire body, and no matter how much
      more power he wished to unleash, his legs remained pinned on the ground.
      He couldn’t walk anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths wished to know what lay beyond the darkness, but he was unable
      to move his body. He could no longer even wriggle his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>He was only one step away, but the darkness seemed so far away.</p>
