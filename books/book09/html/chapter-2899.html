	<h2>New Guessing</h2>

	<h3>Chapter 2899</h3>

	<p>His method of geno art usage was common, so it did not look special. It looked like the other princes and
		princesses could use them too.</p>

	<p>When Bai Wanjie used them, all the geno arts combined like a glove. He was able to block the undead’s attacks and
		start to establish a much-needed advantage.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought, “Bai Wanjie’s talent is not as great as Bai Wuchang’s, but his mind and his skills are better
		than. So many geno art combinations are being executed perfectly. You would have to practice a lot to get to
		this level.”</p>

	<p>After fighting for an hour, Bai Wanjie was finally able to slay the yellow undead. It was different from the red
		undead. The yellow undead melted and disappeared. Suddenly, there was an electric voice that came from the
		Yellow Temple. Without emotion, it said, “Killed medium-class undead.”</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>A bridge appeared from the sea. It was leading to a third island.</p>

	<p>This time, the prince and princesses did not quickly head across it. Many princes and princesses remained where
		they were. They each wanted to enter the temple and battle the yellow undead for themselves to test their own
		mettle.</p>

	<p>On the last island, they had all the confidence needed to beat the red undead. It was not a foe they found too
		formidable, so they were happy enough to proceed and head to the next island. They did not feel as confident
		when they came to the yellow undead. It was not something they could easily defeat, if at all. It was natural
		for them to assume they would only encounter harder trials and stronger undead enemies the further they went. If
		they could not beat the current task, it would only put them in harsher danger by going forward.</p>

	<p>They could have chosen to proceed, but they preferred to stay and practice with the yellow undead. When they were
		able to beat the yellow undead, they would keep on going.</p>

	<p>After all, Starter King’s Land was a place for training. They weren’t rats in the maze searching for an exit.
		There was no rush, so a bit of practice was in order.</p>

	<p>Many of the princes and princesses thought that way. They entered the yellow temple. More yellow undead appeared
		from the metal box.</p>

	<p>They fought the yellow undead to increase their battle power.</p>

	<p>Only Bai Wanjie, Bai Wuchang, Bai Qingxian, Bai Lingshang, and Bai Wei went ahead on the next bridge. They
		merrily went along to the next island.</p>

	<p>Han Sen followed. There were so many prince and princesses there, so they should have been safe. Bai Wanjie and
		the others might encounter danger, so Han Sen was keen to see what the next undead looked like.</p>

	<p>Upon seeing him, Prince Qingxian said, “Holy Baby, you should stay here. If you are in danger, no one here can
		protect you.”</p>

	<p>“I can protect myself.” Han Sen laughed.</p>

	<p>Prince Qingxian said nothing further. Bai Wanjie, who was up ahead, had almost reached the third island. Bai
		Lingshang and Bai Wuchang followed with haste.</p>

	<p>Of course, Han Sen noticed the island had a temple of its own, as expected. This time, however, the temple was
		blue.</p>

	<p>When everyone went before the blue temple, the door opened on its own. It revealed the interior, which had a blue
		metal box inside it.</p>

	<p>Bai Wanjie and the others swapped stares with one another. In the end, Bai Wuchang stepped into the blue temple
		first.</p>

	<p>Katcha-cha!</p>

	<p>The blue metal box opened up. An undead came out from it.</p>

	<p>This undead looked like an Extreme King or human. Its body was not as transparent. It looked like it had been
		built from porcelain. Although there was a layer of crystal, one could not see the structure inside the body.
	</p>

	<p>Plus, its body had some color, including black hair and black pupils. It looked very alive. It looked like a
		living thing.</p>

	<p>Although it was still primitive class, the moment the undead lashed out, everyone felt that it was different from
		the other two undead.</p>

	<p>The last two undead were strong, but they were just strong. There was something about this undead that could not
		be described with words.</p>

	<p>If the previous the two undead were robots, this undead was a living thing.</p>

	<p>It still used the Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch, but its Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch was not just strong.
		It had a special level.</p>

	<p>Bai Wuchang used knife skills to fight the undead. He blocked three punches, but he was quickly suppressed. His
		Ghost Body was able to avoid all the attacks, but the undead’s Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch crushed space and
		broke it. Bai Wuchang could not walk between the real world and the underworld.</p>

	<p>“Wuchang, let me help you!” Bai Wanjie could see Bai Wuchang getting beat. He shouted and joined the fight.</p>

	<p>“Allow me to chip in too!” Bai Lingshang’s body looked like ice. She was like an ice goddess as she joined the
		fight.</p>

	<p>“How could you leave me behind?” Prince Qingxia cast Hatred Times Ten and joined the fight.</p>

	<p>Bai Wei did not say anything. She cast her own Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch to join the fight.</p>

	<p>The undead was getting attacked by five princes and princesses. Although they were all primitive class, it was
		still able to repel the five and not be beaten. It was difficult to tell who the victor would end up being.</p>

	<p>Han Sen watched from the sidelines. He thought the undead looked just like a spirit.</p>

	<p>“If Starter King’s Land is something the Extreme King Alpha brought from Sacred, these undead should be Sacred
		Leader’s research subjects. Fox Queen used to say Sacred Leader, in the sanctuaries, researched immortal
		spirits. The holy spirits should be these spirits now. Are these undead the spirits Sacred Leader tried to make?
		If so, how did he create them?”</p>

	<p>After thinking about that, Han Sen’s expression changed. “Hang on, Extreme King took out the spirit, but the
		spirits themselves are the immortal beings. Does this mean the undead are made from the spirits of the
		xenogeneics?”</p>

	<p>Although this was just Han Sen guessing, he thought it was possible.</p>

	<p>“If that is the theory, that means the spirits are a spirit body… God Spirits are one such form… Wait a minute…
		Spirits and God Spirits survive in familiar ways… They are immortal… They can be reborn…” Han Sen’s thought was
		chilling.</p>

	<p>There was something in the middle that could not be explained. Spirits were only exclusive to the sanctuaries.
		They did not need the body of another creature, yet they could still fight.</p>

	<p>God required another creature’s body to fight in the universe. This was like the undead spirits, but the undead
		were not as perfect as a spirit. It seemed as if there were many flaws.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He thought of something else that was possible. “I have heard Fox Queen say Sacred Leader
		researched immortal holy spirits in the sanctuaries. I thought the spirits existed in the sanctuaries before
		Sacred Leader, so he went there to research them. What if it was all the other way around?”</p>
