<h2>Yu Shanxin</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2065</h3>

<p>Han Sen saw something descend from the sky. It was a man in
green clothing. A fairly ordinary looking Sky.</p>
<p>That man’s approach wasn’t ominous like the Dragon was, and he
rode down atop a swallow mount. The bird was a pretty black and
white, but it was definitely a little too small. The Sky man
occupied all of its back, and he had to stand precariously on
it.</p>
<p>The swallow looked tired. It flew before Han Sen, allowing the
green-clothed man to nod at him. Then, it landed.</p>
<p>The swallow flew away in a rush, as if it was actually fleeing.
The green-clothed man spoke to the escaping swallow, saying, “Thank
you for bringing me here. I will return the favor some day!”</p>
<p>When the swallow heard what he said, it started flying away even
faster. It flew as fast and far as it could. Eventually, it
disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>“Greetings. I am Yu Shanxin. For my sake, give Han Sen a break.
I will take whatever punishment you have reserved for him. I won’t
fight back, and I will accept whatever you deal out until you are
satisfied.” The green-clothed man stood in front of Han Sen with a
gleeful smile.</p>
<p>Dragon One looked at the green-clothed man, and he said coldly,
“Yu Shanxin, is Sky Palace really going to accept the punishment on
his behalf?”</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin nodded seriously. “Han Sen is Knife Queen’s student.
She requested that Sky Palace take care of him. I need to see him
returned safely. If we didn’t do this, then… I am not sure how I
would even begin to explain things. It will ruin the reputation of
Sky Palace. You must understand my reasoning.”</p>
<p>The students of Knife Queen are that important? So important
that they can freely kill as many of the Dragon as they please?”
Dragon One coldly looked at Yu Shanxin.</p>
<p>The Dragon are a higher race. The Dragon are important enough.
How about this? A life for a life. I will pay on his behalf. If you
want to kill me, then just come at me,” Yu Shanxin said, lowering
his head.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked by this, and he quickly said, “I did this.
This has nothing to do with Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin smiled at Han Sen, and then he shook his head. “When
you entered Sky Palace, you were automatically made one of our
ranks. Furthermore, the leader is the one that instructed you to go
to the Ancient God space. Whatever you do is a responsibility of
ours.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but Yu Shanxin stopped him.</p>
<p>“Fine. Yu Shanxin, if you want to shoulder his debt, then take
my finger. If you survive, you may live. And then I will consider
our debt settled.” Dragon One looked at Yu Shanxin.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mister Dragon. I will be forever thankful,” Yu
Shanxin said gratefully.</p>
<p>“If you survive the touch of my finger, only then can you say
thank you.” After that, Dragon One pointed his finger at Yu
Shanxin’s forehead.</p>
<p>That finger looked as if it could poke through the entire
galaxy. Time and space collapsed around it, and everything vanished
around that finger.</p>
<p>Han Sen, who was standing behind Yu Shanxin, felt as if his body
was going to be perforated. It felt as if Dragon One’s finger could
turn everything to dust. But Yu Shanxin remained unmoved. He did
not raise his hand, and he let Dragon One point that finger at his
forehead.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. “Is that guy really going to die for me? I
can’t accept a favor like this.”</p>
<p>The next second, Han Sen saw the finger that could destroy the
world get pointed at Yu Shanxin. No power came out from it, though.
It looked as if Dragon One’s finger only poked the man, and that
was that.</p>
<p>“Thank you for letting me live,” Yu Shanxin showed true
appreciation as he bowed.</p>
<p>Dragon One looked at Yu Shanxin without expression. “It is no
wonder you are the one who broke through Sky Palace. Godslayer Yu,
who carried the Blood Coffin to Outer Sky, I promise you that the
Dragon’s grudge with Han Sen has been erased.”</p>
<p>After that, Dragon One went back to his carriage. The ten beasts
resumed pulling it, and it eventually disappeared. “Thank you for
saving my life,” Han Sen said quickly. He owed this man a great
deal.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin waved his hand and said, “You represented Sky Palace
in your trip to the Ancient God space. What transpired there was
not your fault. Sky Palace will not allow anything ill to befall
you. You deserved the bailout, so there is no need to thank
me.”</p>
<p>After that, Yu Shanxin waved his hand again and a black and
white swallow flew down from the mountains. It did so upside-down.
It reached his hands and could not fly away.</p>
<p>“Since you brought me here, you might as well take me back,” Yu
Shanxin said, stepping atop the swallow. He stood on one foot, and
the swallow took him away.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m still here!” Han Sen’s eyes were open wide. He
realized he was still surrounded by the Dragon, and that Yu Shanxin
was now gone.</p>
<p>“Sorry, please excuse me.” Han Sen gulped, then squeezed his way
through the Dragon xenogeneics and nobles.</p>
<p>They looked at Han Sen with anger, as if they wanted to eat him,
but now no one dared to touch him.</p>
<p>Han Sen made his way through the scary xenogeneics and nobles,
and it was lucky that he had a strong will. Ordinary Marquises
would have felt their legs shaking as they walked past.</p>
<p>“You are powerful. You got Yu Shanxin to save you.” After Han
Sen walked through, Xius appeared by his side. She sat down on a
stone and spoke to him.</p>
<p>“Is Master Yu famous?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You are a member of Sky Palace. Do you not know Godslayer Yu
Shanxin?” Xius looked at Han Sen with surprise. “Godslayer? He
looked like a nice chap. Why would he have such a title?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>Xius looked at him strangely, and she said, “Godslayer Yu was
his true name. Yu Shanxin is actually what he named himself. There
are many elites in this universe, but there is only one who was
brave enough to dare storming Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>“He is a member of Sky Palace? That makes no sense. You just
said that he stormed it,” Han Sen said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Xius realized that Han Sen really did not know anything about
the man, and so she explained, “Yu Shanxin’s teacher was set up by
his schoolmates and executed for the crime of treason. It was a
pointless death. Yu Shanxin brought his teacher’s coffin back to
Sky Palace, but someone stopped him. He was maddened by this, and
so he stormed in. He beat the ten elders, and he got so far into
Sky Palace that he was able to meet with the leader. He wanted to
make things right.”</p>
<p>“Anyone who was involved in his teacher’s death was killed. He
killed many in Sky Palace, all alone. Even the coffin itself was
dyed red. After doing all that, Godslayer Yu became quite famous. I
am not sure why he changed his name to Yu Shanxin, though.”</p>
