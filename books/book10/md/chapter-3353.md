  The small white rat could not speak, so it only ran forward and stopped a little. When Han Sen caught up, it kept on running.

It was unknown how long it had been running, and then the small white rat bent its waist and slid down a copper pillar.

Han Sen looked down. He noticed the copper pillar was empty. There was nothing there to grab hold of. Black and gray dust was layered across the wall. It was likely what the liquid from the dead body oil had become, except now it was gunky due to being dried up.

Han Sen slid down the copper pillar and soon discovered that the copper pillar’s bottom had a rat hole. The small white rat was looking around, waiting for Han Sen to catch up to it.

They crawled out of the rat hole. Han Sen noticed they were now in a copper hall. The hall featured a square pool that was half-filled with water. A green vine was inside the water. A little green gourd was above the vine.

“Squeak squeak… Squeak squeak… Squeak squeak…” The small white rat ran next to the water. It twisted its head and squeaked at Han Sen. It then went inside the pool as if it was going for a shower.

Han Sen did not know what the small white rat was trying to say. If it had gone there just to shower, it had led him a long way.

Han Sen kept looking at the gourd vine in the water. He walked next to the pool.

The white rat was swimming in the water, not planning on leaving. It was not planning on going any further.

After a while of silence, Han Sen went into the pool. After his body touched the pool’s water, Han Sen’s body felt as if it was lit on fire. He felt as if an invisible heat was burning him.

Han Sen was shocked and said, “This is a pool of water. Why does it have fire-like features?”

Before he jumped out of the pool, his small body started to grow bigger. He was returned to his usual size. His body power, which had been restricted by Dust Sky, had been returned to him.

“I can feel my power!” Han Sen was soaking in the water. He felt as if he was being reborn in a fire. He felt all of the power of the universe, and all his power came back to where it belonged.

Han Sen was shocked and happy. He really wanted to pick up the small white rat and kiss it. “Good people are given good karma. It seems that I did not waste my meat.”

The small white rat did not let him get close. It swam away and went toward the gourd and vine.

After a while, the burning sensation of the pool water was gone. It did not work on his body anymore. Han Sen jumped out of the pool and generated his Dongxuan Aura. He no longer felt any resistance. He was able to cast it like usual. It was just like the power he used when he was outside.

Han Sen was very happy that he was able to his true powers. It meant he had a chance of fighting anyone or anything he wished. Even if Qin Xiu showed up, he would be able to battle him.

He looked at the small white rat with gratitude, but it was already swimming to the gourd vine. He was wondering if he should climb there with it.

It looked as if the small white rat had made up its mind. Its body started to shake as if it was being electrified. Then, it bounced away.

Han Sen saw the snow-white skin of the small white rat start to blacken and charr. It was like the furry thing had been roasted alive.

The small white rat fell into the body of the pool. It did not move. Its behavior seemed to suggest it was dead.

Han Sen was shocked. He used his Dongxuan Aura to get a look at the small white rat. He discovered its lifeforce was not quite all gone. It was recovering in the pool.

Of course, a burned, poor little rat was in the water. Not long later, the burned color started to fade away. It brought back its white skin, and its lifeforce started to improve.

“This water is really good. It can bring people back to life.” Han Sen was shocked. He was really curious about the gourd vine that was inside the water.

He used the Dongxuan Aura to get a proper look at the gourd vine. He only saw a blur. He could not even see the base structure of the thing. That gave him a shock.

“What is this gourd vine? Not even I can make something out of it.” While Han Sen was wondering, he saw the small white rat recover. It rushed to the gourd vine again.

This time, the small white rat used its teeth to bite the gourd vine. When it touched the gourd vine, it was like it was being electrified to the point of looking like a block of charcoal. It fell to the bottom of the pool again.

Not long later, the small white rat looked like normal again. It went to the gourd vine again. It repeated this motion a few times. The snow-white rat knew it could not block the gourd vine’s power, but it kept going on. It looked as if it was determined to break it.

Han Sen was curious about the gourd vine too. He wanted to go down into the water and see if he could touch the gourd vine. He suddenly heard a voice sound from nearby.

Han Sen was shocked. He quickly looked around and saw the bronze hall’s door was closed. There should not have been anyone inside, yet he clearly heard that voice. He knew it was Ancient Devil.

He looked toward where the voice was seemingly coming from. He noticed it was coming from a rat hole in the corner of the wall. It was where the copper pillar was.

Han Sen stood still. The copper pillar could have led anywhere. It was like a system that channeled voices, but it had to be Ancient Devil talking somewhere around there. The rat hole enabled him to hear every word spoken.

That voice was not loud. After the pipe maximized the sound, he could hear it all clearly. Han Sen tried to peep and hear what he was talking about.

“Are you going to fight me for it?” Ancient Devil sounded cold and angry.

Han Sen was shocked. He had been with Ancient Devil for a while. He had never seen him get mad before. Even when he was locked up, he never got angry with him.

“Who is Ancient Devil talking to? Is it Bury Path God?” Han Sen wondered.

Han Sen quickly learned the answer. Another voice came out from the rat hole. Han Sen was no stranger to that acoustic. He knew who it belonged to.

“What do you mean to fight you for it? This is something Mister Leader left behind. It is my right to have a part of it. Are you saying only you, Ancient Devil, can have the items the leader left behind?” It was the voice of a seductive woman. It was big sky demon.

“In the past, you kept going against me,” Ancient Devil coldly said. “You are still the same. It looks like you and I should settle this score for good.”

“Big sky demon is in Dust Sky, and she is here. If Bury Path God comes back too, this is going to be quite the event.” Han Sen started to look weird. He remembered that big sky demon and another vice president were enemies. Han Sen thought it was Bury Path God. He now knew the vice president that big sky demon had mentioned was likely Ancient Devil.
