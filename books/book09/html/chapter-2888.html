<p>When feeling the power in that knife, even a deified elite would
have felt a chill.</p>
<p>“You insulted my Buddha! You will die!” Burning Lamp’s body
carried the presence of the causal karma knife. It was oscillating
at an extreme level. He was like an ancient god claiming the sky
with a god sound that was like a judgment sound. The causal karma
knife was coming down.</p>
<p>The power was strong. It could split the universe and space in
half. The scariest thing was that the knife light from the knife
had the ripping qualities of a Teeth Knife. This slash was stronger
than any attack wielded by Han Sen. It was unknown how many times
stronger it was.</p>
<p>All the Buddha were happy. This knife shocked them, but the
shock also made them feel awesome and happy.</p>
<p>“Die! You dared to challenge my Buddha! You insulted my alpha!
You should be ripped apart!” Many of the Buddha had lots of hatred
in their hearts. They wanted to see Han Sen get torn apart in a
single strike.</p>
<p>Seeing knife lights come like the end of the world, Han Sen
complimented it. “Like turning expectations on their head, that is
a very powerful causal karma knife.”</p>
<p>This knife made him feel as if he could not dodge it. It was so
powerful that he was afraid not even a true god xenogeneic would be
able to run.</p>
<p>“It is merely a shame that your opponent was me.” Han Sen’s eyes
froze. The power in his body changed. He used one arm like a knife
and slashed toward the incoming knife light.</p>
<p>“Is he directly fighting him?” Meng Lie looked surprised. Anyone
was able to tell that Burning Lamp’s knife had generated the
strength of Han Sen’s relentless attacks earlier for his own use.
One knife was able to kill a true god. Han Sen used one hit to go
against countless of his own strikes. It was not wise.</p>
<p>Bai Buyi shook his head. “It is not like he does not want to
dodge. He cannot dodge. Although the causal karma knife did not
have Demon Alpha’s Sky Demon Power, it carries the same causal
power. The causal karma knife has absorbed all the damage dealt to
Burning Lamp by Han Sen earlier, but the attack must land on Han
Sen. Even if Han Sen used Space Teleportation to somewhere a few
systems away, the karma is something he has to accept.”</p>
<p>“But a hit like that? How can Han Sen go against it?” Meng Lie
had a wry smile.</p>
<p>Just as Meng Lie believed, Exquisite, Li Keer, Han Yen, Yun
Suyi, Tang Zhenliu, and anyone else that had a connection to Han
Sen were all worried about him.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed, but his arm did not unleash knife air. It was
like he was slashing in space. He had no power.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked, wondering what was up with Han Sen. Such a
powerful knife had not unleashed knife air.</p>
<p>“Have you given up?” All the Buddha looked happy.</p>
<p>Seeing Burning Lamp’s scary knife light about to reach him, Han
Sen did not have the time to combat it.</p>
<p>In the next second, everyone froze. The scary knife light
stopped in front of Han Sen. It was like it had stopped in space.
The scary knife light was shaking as if it was afraid.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>While everyone was shocked, the scary knife light shattered
before Han Sen. It became purple knife silk. It was like a purple
flood that returned to Burning Lamp.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi was so surprised that she screamed, “Under the Sky
Knife skill!”</p>
<p>“How was he able to break the causal power knife like that?” Yun
Sushang was shocked.</p>
<p>“With Under the Sky, everything is a chess piece. Han Sen has
mastered Under the Sky.” Sky Palace Leader was impressed.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp’s expression immediately changed. The faces of the
Buddha were grey like ash. The knife they had placed all their
hopes and dreams on had suddenly been reversed. Its power was now
Han Sen’s power. No one could believe that.</p>
<p>“Impossible… The causal power cannot be controlled… That is
impossible.” Burning Lamp’s state of unbelief was magnified 1,000
times. At the end of the day, he had no choice but to believe
it.</p>
<p>Seeing that scary knife stream come, Burning Lamp realized he
was unable to block it. He gnashed his teeth and released the god
doll. The god doll suddenly grew bigger. It turned into a black
wood god doll. Mysterious flower symbols flashed across it. It was
punching at the scary knife stream.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A mysterious black punch was striking the purple knife stream.
The knife stream was broken. The power of the god doll was shaken
away.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader looked at the god doll in shock as he said,
“Huh, a true god class xenogeneic. No, that is not a xenogeneic… It
seems like a treasure…”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew it wasn’t a xenogeneic as well. It was a treasure.
He looked at the god doll and laughed. “Is that the true god reward
you received from the god fights? It is an interesting true god
weapon since it can fight on its own. It can also explode with true
god power. It is much better than your master.”</p>
<p>“Buddha brothers, listen! Activate the race lantern and kill
this thief!” Burning Lamp roared and controlled the god doll. He
commanded it to kill Han Sen.</p>
<p>All the Buddha heeded Burning Lamp’s order. They ceased all
hesitation and exploded the power inside their bodies. No matter
how strong or weak they were, they infused their power with the
race lantern.</p>
<p>The race lantern was shining brightly. It was like a volcano
erupting. In space, the gold lantern’s flame had become a giant and
gold old Buddha. His eyes flashed with a god light. It was like a
spotlight aiming down at Han Sen. The gold flames generated
incredible power through suppression.</p>
<p>It was the Buddha generating their entire race’s power to form a
race spirit. Its power was no worse than a deified elite. It
attacked Han Sen with the god doll and Burning Lamp Alpha.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by three scary creatures, Han Sen did not move.
His body was like a shadow. His hand turned into a knife and
slashed casually.</p>
<p>With Han Sen slashing, the broken knife stream appeared again. A
sky full of knife light turned into a flood that fought three
separate enemies. It was not losing.</p>
<p>The god’s doll was affected the most. It kept breaking the knife
stream, but the knife stream kept respawning. As time went by, the
knife stream grew bigger.</p>
<p>The universe’s creatures were shocked by what was on display.
Han Sen was fighting a god doll, Burning Lamp, and the race spirit
all alone. It looked like they had the advantage, but it was
Burning Lamp and the others that were actually being suppressed.
Although their powers shocked the sky, they could not break Han
Sen’s streams of knife lights.</p>
<p>“Under the Sky, everyone is a chess piece.” Han Sen stood in
space. He sounded like a god. His arm was like a knife slashing.
Instantly, 10,000 knife lights went toward his arm. It became a
Slash Sky god knife.</p>
<p>Under that knife, the whole of space was covered with knife
lights. There was nowhere to dodge. The god doll was being slashed.
It flew back a few dozen miles. The knife lights were still coming
down. They could not be blocked. They were slashing toward the
shocked Burning Lamp and Buddha race spirit.</p>
