<p>On the little jade island, Han Sen, Han Yan, and Bao’er were
sitting at a table with four gourds of various sizes laid out
across it. They were the four gourds Han Yan had collected from the
holy vine.</p>
<p>The three of them had briefly examined the gourds, but they
still didn’t know how to get the holy air out of them.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, can’t you make these things release their holy air?”
Han Sen asked, glancing at Bao’er.</p>
<p>Bao’er shook her head. “I could if I was at the vine, but not
right now.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean retrieving them was pointless, then?” Han Sen
felt depressed.</p>
<p>“Stop trying. Once the holy gourds are separated from the holy
vine, the holy air inside of them solidifies. They won’t release
anything.” Yun Changkong smiled as he walked over to them. Yun Suyi
and Yun Sushang were following behind him.</p>
<p>“Greetings, brother,” Han Yan said. She stood up and bowed to
Yun Changkong.</p>
<p>“Greetings, auntie…” Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang bowed, as
well.</p>
<p>“Why is this so messed up?” Han Sen thought. He bowed to Yun
Changkong, too, but only referred to him as Elder Yun.</p>
<p>The Yun sisters said hi to him. They had been close for some
time, so there was no need for a great deal of politeness.</p>
<p>After Han Sen instructed them all to take a seat, he had Zero
come and pour the tea. Yun Changkong had a sip and then said, “The
holy gourds cannot release holy air now that they have been picked.
But they are a material that can be used to forge deified
treasures. We should conduct a test and learn what elements they
are associated with. Then, I will have Sky Chance’s department make
the treasure for you. However, making the treasures will still
require other materials, and they might be expensive. The process
isn’t guaranteed to be successful, either. I would wager it to be
fifty-fifty.”</p>
<p>“What kind of materials will I be needing?” Han Yan asked.</p>
<p>“We won’t know that until we test the holy gourds. After we have
decided what sort of treasure you want, then we can make a list of
the materials that will be required.” Yun Changkong smiled and went
on to say, “Don’t worry about it, little sister. I will pay for the
materials in return for your willingness to join us. Please do not
object to my insistence. It is settled.”</p>
<p>Upon seeing Yun Changkong’s certainty, Han Yan didn’t turn down
his offer.</p>
<p>After chatting for a while, Yun Changkong turned to Han Sen.
“Han Sen, have you not been to the five cities?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet.” Han Sen shook his head and said, “I wanted to go
to the five cities, but a guard told me I need some sort of
special</p>
<p>pass.”</p>
<p>Yun Changkong pulled out a piece of paper with a black symbol
written on it. “The five cities are different from the twelve
towers. It is very dangerous there, and the cities are all
different from one another. Until you heal, you shouldn’t go to the
latter four. This is the Black King City spell of the five cities.
If you have this, you will be allowed to enter the Black King City.
Perhaps it can help you. But remember: you cannot lose the pass if
you enter there. And you cannot kill anything inside. Otherwise,
you will land in a lot of hot water.”</p>
<p>“What is inside the Black King City?” Han Sen asked with
curiosity.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you. But you will find out as soon as you go
there,” Yun Changkong said, waving his hand with a mysterious
air.</p>
<p>“This spell can only allow one person inside?” Han Sen asked
with more curiosity.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong nodded and said, “In the future, little sister’s
spell will be handled by Sky Palace Leader. Her level is low now,
so it is pointless for her to venture into the five cities. We will
need to wait until she is King class. Then she will receive her
five cities spell.”</p>
<p>Although Han Yan was now Yun Changkong’s sister, she was still
his student. Yun Changkong was explaining things to Han Yan just
like an average instructor would.</p>
<p>With Yun Changkong only being the senior student, the atmosphere
was so unnatural. The Yun sisters were very quiet because of
it.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong understood why, though. He dropped the info and
left, leaving Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang behind.</p>
<p>When only the youngsters remained, the atmosphere became far
more relaxed and comfortable. Amidst the liveliness, Han Sen was
keen on asking the Yun sisters about the Black King City.</p>
<p>“Father said that our powers are too weak, and we cannot go in
yet. That is why we don’t know much about the cities. I have heard
that Black King City is the safest of all the cities. As long as
you keep the spell on your person, and you don’t have any intent to
kill within you, it shouldn’t be too dangerous for you to go to the
Black King City.” Yun Suyi stopped to think for a moment, then
said, “The legends claim that Black King City has many rare
treasures in it. Many of the people that entered there came back
with grand trophies, but they were never willing to say how they
came into possession of them.”</p>
<p>The Yun sisters didn’t know much about the Black King City,
which only made Han Sen even more curious.</p>
<p>The next day, he rode his legless crane to the White Jade Jing.
He wanted to see the Black King City so he could see what was so
special about it.</p>
<p>Of course, when he reached the gate of the city, Han Sen was
stopped by a Sky Palace student.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, I’m so sorry. Without a pass from the leader, no
one is allowed to enter the Black King City.” That guard had once
attended lessons taught by Han Sen, so he was very polite.</p>
<p>“Will this do?” Han Sen took out his pass and handed it over to
the guard.</p>
<p>The student inspected it and then let him pass. Before Han Sen
went, though, the guard reminded him that he must carry his spell
at all times. He couldn’t, at any cost, lose the spell.</p>
<p>Han Sen thanked the guard and entered Black King City.</p>
<p>From the outside, the city looked like an ancient place built
from black jade. It looked old. It was mysterious and cold.</p>
<p>After entering the Black King City, Han Sen was shocked by what
he saw.</p>
<p>He had thought Black King City was a mysterious place, and that
there might be dark and dangerous creatures out on the prowl. He at
least thought it might look like the White Jade Tower, albeit with
the presence of creatures.</p>
<p>But as Han Sen stepped on to the city’s main street, he saw that
the place was quite populated. It was a town with all sorts of
people. There were merchants and farmers. There were even
restaurants in which people relaxed and chatted as they ate.</p>
<p>If Han Sen hadn’t come in through the clearly defined entrance,
he’d have assumed he had gone to the wrong place. This place
shouldn’t have been called Black King City. It was more like a
small town on some underdeveloped planet.“Peanuts! Walnuts! Pears!
Dates!” a seller was barking down the street.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see a farmer leading a cow. There were chickens
clucking in cages and dogs barking at one another on the street.
Han Sen felt strangely unsettled as he walked down the street. When
he was young, not even his home had been this underdeveloped. This
was the sort of thing he might have seen in an old movie.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the ancient city people around him and noted
that they looked very human. They were almost exactly the same as
his own people.</p>
<p>“How is this possible? How can there be humans here?” Han Sen
mumbled to himself in shock.</p>
<p>They looked exactly like humans. They were different from the
Very High, the Sky, and the Extreme King. They did not have the
additional features that the other races had. They were practically
identical to humans.</p>
<p>“Am I having some sort of hallucination? They cannot be humans,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Soon after, though, he realized that what he was seeing couldn’t
just be some sort of illusion. The beings around him were obviously
living humans.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to use his Dongxuan Aura to examine them more
closely, but he found that his power was all gone. Not a single
speck of it remained.</p>
