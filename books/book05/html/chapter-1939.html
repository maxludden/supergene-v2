<p>“Why are you following me?” Han Sen asked, looking at
Hai’er.</p>
<p>Hai’er sauntered casually behind him. “I gave you my end of the
bargain, so of course I’m going to follow you. Heaven is going to
open in a few days, and until then, I am attaching myself to
you.”</p>
<p>“I am going to listen to Burning Lamp Alpha’s speech. We can
meet there,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“There’s nowhere else for me to go, anyway. I might as well
follow you. It might be nice to meet up with Knife Queen, too.”
Hai’er really wanted to follow him.</p>
<p>Han Sen, seeing that Hai’er wasn’t leaving, allowed her to tag
along.</p>
<p>There were a few days to go until the speech was to commence,
and it felt like forever for Han Sen. On the day of the speech,
Yisha still hadn’t revealed herself.</p>
<p>“Weird. Where is Yisha? Did she go to the speech area straight
away?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“Are you really Knife Queen’s student? Where is she?” When the
speech was about to begin, Hai’er cast a suspicious glance at Han
Sen. She was starting to think she didn’t know who he really
was.</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me, then take your tablet back. Then we
can go our separate ways.” Han Sen held it out to her.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, he had researched the text on the
tablet. It looked like something very profound, but there was no
beginning or end to the text it included. It was just a section of
a greater geno art. You couldn’t learn anything from that.</p>
<p>Han Sen found out the tablet was rather well-known, though. The
section that Hai’er had was likely very real.</p>
<p>The Virtual Tablet had quite a lot of storage, and the geno art
filled all of it. If he only had one piece, then he only had one
part of the geno art. It was no wonder why Hai’er was willing to
give it to him.</p>
<p>“No! You’ve already read the contents. What’s the point of
giving it back to me now?” Hai’er shook her head.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored her, and he continued to frown.</p>
<p>The speech started, and Yisha had yet to return. Without Yisha,
Han Sen wouldn’t have the Buddha’s invitation to enter their
Heaven. He could not listen to the speech in the palace, so he’d
have to stay in the plaza and listen alongside the commoners.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp Alpha couldn’t be seen from the plaza. The audience
could only listen to his voice ringing out of yellow speakers.</p>
<p>Many creatures listened to the speech through the Buddha sound
system. When Han Sen heard what was being spoken, he thought it was
very meaningful. He felt as if his heart had leveled up.</p>
<p>But after thinking about it a little more, he thought it was
indeed a little too vague. If you could do what the speech told you
to do, you would have to be a saint. You wouldn’t have to learn
anything.</p>
<p>“It’s your fault! I am from the Pirate! I am supposed to listen
from the palace. Now I’m stuck in the plaza with these lowlifes and
you!” Hai’er sounded upset.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “You probably weren’t going to listen
all that well, anyway. It doesn’t matter where you were standing
when you heard him speak.”</p>
<p>“It’s different. Hearing it from the palace is a recognition of
your identity. It’s different when you’re there,” Hai’er said. Han
Sen didn’t think too much on the speech, though. He was concerned
for Yisha, who was still a no-show.</p>
<p>Far away, in a stone pavilion in the southwest corner of Buddha
Kingdom, an old man was sitting in front of a table. It looked as
if he was dozing off.</p>
<p>There was a game of chess sitting on the table, and it was in
the midst of a stalemate.</p>
<p>Yisha was sitting opposite the man, examining the stalemate in
play atop the table. She was holding a piece, trying to decide on
her next move.</p>
<p>The pavilion was fairly ordinary, but it gave others a feeling
of separation from the world outside. It was like a realm that did
not exist in full.</p>
<p>Time passed, and Yisha sat as still as if she had been turned to
stone.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t see Burning Lamp Alpha, and the speech lasted
the entire day. After that, the creatures all showed their thanks
to the Alpha, kowtowing before the palace.</p>
<p>The speech ended, and the heavens opened. Countless creatures
poured in towards the opening.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Hai’er were stuck in the crowd, looking at the way
to Heaven.</p>
<p>There were eight doors in the Buddha city, and three of them
were open. Five of them were always shut. One of the doors led to
Heaven, and that was the only way to Heaven. It was situated in the
west.</p>
<p>The western door was now open, and when they looked out at it,
they could see a Buddha light. It obviously did not lead to the
land outside the city, as one might expect.</p>
<p>Han Sen still hadn’t seen Yisha, so he decided to move with the
crowd towards the western door. When he went through the western
door, he was not taken outside the city. He found himself in a
desert.</p>
<p>Nothing was visible on those desert wastes; not even cacti. It
was just yellow sand, sizzling beneath a bright, hot sky.</p>
<p>After entering the desert, Han Sen heard something, like someone
whispering near him. It almost sounded like someone speaking the
Buddha catchphrase, but from an indiscernible source.</p>
<p>The noise flowed all around him in a constant susurrus. The
sound wasn’t loud, but he could hear it clearly. It was like it was
coming straight from his brain.</p>
<p>As he listened to that sound, Han Sen’s body wanted to move
along with it. It made him frown.</p>
<p>“Do you hear a noise?” Han Sen asked Hai’er.</p>
<p>“Of course. Did you not know that Heaven has the heavenly
sounds?” Hai’er rolled her eyes. If she hadn’t asked around, she
wouldn’t have believed Han Sen was the student of Knife Queen. He
didn’t know anything.</p>
<p>“What’s up with these heavenly sounds?” Han Sen was trying to
pinpoint its source, but he couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Hai’er kept walking and explained, “The music is everywhere, all
across this Heaven. At first, it will feel like it’s nothing. But
the longer you hear it for, the deeper it will touch you. If you
can’t stay composed and walk through this Heaven in time, your body
will begin to dance along with it. It won’t stop until you’re
dead.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and said, “If it’s that dangerous, and only ten
people can make it through, why are so many people coming here?
Aren’t they afraid of dying?”</p>
<p>“Well, you can turn back before you lose control. You’ll be safe
if you do that.” Hai’er looked around, but she could not catch
sight of Speechless. Then, she asked, “When will you and Speechless
meet up?”</p>
<p>“I told you! We are not in a relationship.” Han Sen looked
around and asked, “How do I know when to keep going or when I
should return?”</p>
<p>“It depends on who you are. Everyone has fear in their hearts.
You turn back when you’ve lost all hope. The more confident and
stubborn people are, the more danger they are in.” Hai’er rolled
her eyes, and continued on to say, “But you will be fine.
Speechless will protect you, and you will make it to the end.”</p>
