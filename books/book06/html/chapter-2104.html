<h2>Pool of Rebirth</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2104</h3>

<p>Holy Heaven’s Pool of Rebirth was one of the most famous pools
in the geno universe. Very few items existed that could help Kings
level up, but Pool of Rebirth was one of them.</p>
<p>The Pool of Rebirth had its flaws, though. The chance of making
a King half-deified was low, and there was a great deal of risk in
even making an attempt. Even so, many other races coveted the
treasure.</p>
<p>A King class Feather found Han Sen and led him to the legendary
Pool of Rebirth. Despite being called a “pool,” the item had no
water. It was a giant crystal altar, and in the center, there was
an angel statue.</p>
<p>That statue was white, and its angelic wings were folded
forward. It looked like a gentle Goddess reaching out to the
masses. Merely looking at the statue summoned a flood of emotion,
and it felt like a single glance would be enough to absolve a
person of all their deathly sorrows and sins.</p>
<p>“Up to three people can use the Pool of Rebirth at the same
time. If fewer people enter, much of the power might be wasted. I
am positive you know all about this. You do, don’t you?” Fairy
Feather said to Han Sen, who was directly in front of the
altar.</p>
<p>Yes.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen came to Holy Heaven as an envoy, the Sky Palace
leader had explained what he ought to expect. Han Sen understood
what was going to happen.</p>
<p>“Good. Sky Palace has only sent you here to use it. To keep from
wasting power, we will send an additional two Marquises to be
reborn with you. Is that okay?” Fairy Feather elder asked with a
smile.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“Angela and Andola. You two may enter and be reborn with Han
Sen. But of course, make sure to be careful. It would be most
uncouth if you were to disrupt our guest’s use of the pool.” Fairy
Feather elder admonished them loudly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had expected this. The Sky Palace leader had sent Han
Sen alone so he could absorb all of the pool’s power himself, but
the Sky Palace leader suspected that the Feathers would send in two
Dukes to fight Han Sen for the majority of the power. Their
assumption was mostly correct, except that the Feathers were
sending in Marquises instead of Dukes. This surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>But when the brothers Angela and Andola stepped toward him, he
understood why they had been selected.</p>
<p>They both looked like Feathers, with faces reminiscent of marble
statues, and their lifeforces were Marquise level. But just feeling
their presence, Han Sen knew immediately that something was amiss.
He did not believe for one second that they were truly Marquises,
plain and simple.</p>
<p>They were more impressive than any Duke that Han Sen had yet
met, and they looked as if they had a great disdain for any being
other than themselves. Not even most Nobles carried themselves with
such haughty confidence.</p>
<p>“Were they the top Dukes here? Were they just reduced to
Marquise when the lantern went out?” Han Sen guessed to
himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen was half-correct. Angela and Andola had been Kings. They
broke the law and were sent to jail, where they had been for the
last few centuries. They were tortured so much that their level
dropped down from King to Duke.</p>
<p>And then, the Feather lantern went out and all the Feathers
across the universe lost an entire level. Those two had to suffer a
drop from Duke to Marquise.</p>
<p>Because they had been in jail, no resources were made available
to help them recover. So, they had to remain Marquises.</p>
<p>Fairy Feather had somehow convinced the two brothers to fight
for the power against Han Sen. Their power might have been
Marquise, but their inner core was King. Their talents far exceeded
those of an ordinary Marquise.</p>
<p>In the past few days, they were healed enough to become Dukes
again. If they successfully absorbed the rebirthing power, there
was every chance they could become Kings again.</p>
<p>Using those two to fight against Han Sen was better than
employing an average Duke to do the same. Against the cruel power
of the brothers, Fairy Feather thought Han Sen would gain
nothing.</p>
<p>But he told them they had to allow Han Sen to gain some smidgen
of power, so Sky Palace wouldn’t be able to claim foul play.</p>
<p>“The Pool of Rebirth is going to open. Please, proceed to the
altar,” a Feather butler proclaimed.</p>
<p>The altar was surprisingly large. Han Sen went to stand near the
angel statue, where he would wait for the Pool of Rebirth to
open.</p>
<p>Angela and Andola stood on either side of the angel statue, with
Han Sen in the middle. They didn’t look at Han Sen once. They just
coldly stood where they were.</p>
<p>Angela and Andola did not take Han Sen for a threat. They used
to be Kings, so no matter how popular Han Sen might have been,
there was no reason for them to pay him any attention, they
believed.</p>
<p>Fairy Feather and the others were now all anticipating a good
show. Only the envoys from Sky Palace watched the Pool of Rebirth
curiously. They were keen to see how much Han Sen could gain from
it.</p>
<p>When Yun Changkong saw Angela and Andola, his eyes squinted.
Those two brothers were in Holy Heaven, and very few knew about
them. They had been locked up for centuries, so all memory of them
should have faded. Yun Changkong still knew a thing or two,
though.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong did not know the two brothers, but he was in
charge of the Cloudsmoke Building. It was a department that
collected intelligence on races throughout the geno universe. So,
he was familiar with famous Feathers across the ages.</p>
<p>The Feathers had called two strange Marquises to fight with Han
Sen, so Yun Changkong knew there was something abnormal going
on.</p>
<p>“There’s more to these guys than it seems,” Yun Changkong
thought. He was trying to guess who those two brothers were.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong found it very hard to believe that the Feathers
would pick two Marquises to fight Han Sen fairly.</p>
<p>The Feathers despised Kong Fei, and Han Sen had received Kong
Fei’s deified feather. There was also the Blood Feather Knife
incident. There was no way the Feathers were willing to let Han Sen
take their rebirthing powers.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong could not recall having heard of the two brothers,
but before long, the Pool of Rebirth opened.</p>
<p>The angel statue started to spew water, and the angelic wings
began to unfurl. Light glowed from the altar, and when it did,
water fountained up from the statue. It turned into a crystal
pillar that shot right up into the sky.</p>
