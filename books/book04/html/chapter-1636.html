      “I haven’t seen it yet, so I can’t be sure,” said Gu Qingcheng calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was there something like the Iron Chimenea in ancient times?” Han Sen
      found it hard to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans had been around for tens of thousands of years, and there was a
      time when humans didn’t keep historical records. But even so, the history
      of humans was not as long as that of the shura race, not to mention the
      ancient races like the Crystallizers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If humans had possessed something so powerful in ancient times, they
      would’ve risen in the universe a long time ago. They wouldn’t have taken
      so long to gain power, and the shura wouldn’t have maintained dominance
      for so many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At that point in history, humans controlled some strange items. Actually,
      you have one yourself, but it isn’t as powerful as it used to be.” Gu
      Qingcheng looked at Han Sen with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You mean Taia Sword?” Han Sen thought about it, and that sword was the
      only thing he had with a rich history, which came from the era of Gu
      Qingcheng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng nodded and said, “Taia Sword was mighty before it was broken.
      When I left, Taia Sword was still one of the top ten sacred swords, but
      out of nowhere, it got broken. Lots of things were lost or destroyed
      around that time, and I don’t know what happened after that. There’s one
      thing I can be sure of: if the Iron Chimenea is as you described, it’s
      probably an alchemy pot.”
    </p>
    <p>“Is it used for making medicines?” asked Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng paused for a while and said, “In that era, many Taoists
      wanted to become angels, and making medicines was one of the ways to
      achieve that. It was very popular among the Taoists, and the most famous
      alchemy pot was the long- living pot that belonged to the Taoist Xu Fu.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Xu Fu? I’ve heard that name somewhere before. An emperor in ancient times
      once went to find medicines that could help him live forever. Was that
      him?” Han Sen asked after a moment of thought. He had heard that story
      when he was in kindergarten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng shook her head. “He wasn’t an emperor. Xu Fu was a very
      famous Taoist, and he was great at making medications. He was using the
      Chimenea to reshape his own body.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Reshape his own body? He wanted to turn himself into a medication?” Han
      Sen was very surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course not. He was using the Chimenea to train his body, and he
      absorbed the forces from the medication. He then condensed the medications
      and tried to become an angel. Unfortunately, modern science has proven
      that there isn’t anything like heaven, and the so-called Taoist technique
      back then was proven to be just a rumor. Only a few seemed to actually
      break the space and ascend. Perhaps nobody actually succeeded, and even if
      one succeeded, nobody knew where they went, but it wouldn’t be heaven.” Gu
      Qingcheng shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s interest was piqued. If Dongxuan Zi broke through space and
      entered the sanctuary, then what about the other Taoists who broke through
      space? Did they reach the sanctuaries as well?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, that didn’t seem quite right. Jade Little Lion King once said
      that his father had seen that Iron Chimenea when it was still young, and
      based on the age of the Little Lion King’s father, that Iron Chimenea had
      been around much longer than humans had. If that ancient creature saw the
      Chimenea when it was young, there was no way that the device once belonged
      to humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think it’s just a coincidence that they look alike. The Iron Chimenea
      has been in God’s Ruin for so long, and it’s definitely older than human
      history. It’s not likely that it’s some pot that belonged to Xu Fu,” said
      Han Sen to Gu Qingcheng.
    </p>
    <p>“We need to see it first,” said Gu Qingcheng stubbornly.</p>
    <p>
      Seeing Gu Qingcheng insist on fighting the armored man, Han Sen stopped
      trying to persuade her to concede. He had already warned her and told her
      everything he knew, so it wouldn’t be his fault that something bad
      happened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Divinity’s Bout continued. Han Sen and the armored man didn’t run into
      any obstacles. All the creatures and spirits conceded, so they passed
      round after round of battles without fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After half a month, the battle between Gu Qingcheng and the armored man
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng also had great performance in her previous battles, so many
      creatures and spirits were attracted to her fight with the armored man.
      Lots of creatures were speculating on whether Gu Qingcheng had the courage
      to fight him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, Gu Qingcheng was a very stubborn person. Even though Han
      Sen warned her several times, Gu Qingcheng still insisted on fighting the
      armored man. When she showed up on the battlefield, lots of people
      cheered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were cheering for Gu Qingcheng’s courage, but at the same time, they
      would finally see the armored man strike again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody paid any attention to the armored man until his fight against the
      master of Outer Sky. And after that fight, no creatures dared to fight the
      armored man, so most of the crowd had never seen the armored man strike
      before, and they didn’t know exactly how powerful he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng was the first person since Outer Sky who had been willing to
      fight him, and this was the perfect time to see whether the armored man
      was indeed as invincible as the rumors said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t have a battle that day, so he left Shadow Shelter and went
      to watch the battle with Wang Yuhang and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew that Gu Qingcheng was powerful, but that armored man was also
      terrific. Han Sen wasn’t sure whether Gu Qingcheng could win or not, so he
      could only wish Gu Qingcheng good luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old Han, will sister Gu be okay?” Wang Yuhang was a bit worried. He had
      watched the armored man kill Outer Sky’s leader with one strike, so he
      knew how terrifying the armored man was. He was very worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If she thinks she can do it, I don’t think she’ll have a problem. With
      her power, even if she can’t defeat the armored man, she can still survive
      long enough to resign the fight. Nobody in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary can
      stop her.” Han Sen could only hope for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fleeing? It’ll be the armored man who’ll flee.” Elysian Moon sneered and
      walked toward him. She then sat down on the stone steps.
    </p>
    <p>“Let’s hope so,” said Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow also came to cheer for Gu Qingcheng.
      Unfortunately, Gu Qingcheng couldn’t hear anything in the battlefield of
      Divinity’s Bout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle had begun. Gu Qingcheng walked into the battlefield, and almost
      at the same time, a door of light showed up in opposition to Gu Qingcheng,
      and the armored man walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was staring at the armored man, and they were all greatly
      anticipating his performance. All the creatures were still thrilled by how
      the armored man killed the master of Outer Sky with one strike, and many
      people wished to see the same thing happen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng stared at the armored man thoughtfully. It seemed that she
      might’ve figured out something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The armored man didn’t say anything. He raised his fist, and fire started
      to burn across his body. But the burning fire wasn’t hot at all; instead,
      it was cold as ice.
