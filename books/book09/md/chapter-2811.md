Second Uncle and the group of people hoped the fugitive, Han Sen, had not escaped to the Lost Land and perhaps diverted his path on the way there. When Ger led them to the Lost Land, their final tether of hope was cut.

"Han Sen knows he made a mistake. That must be why he risked going to the Lost Land. Are we going in or not?" Everyone looked at Second Uncle. Bao Qin was the one who asked.

Second Uncle hesitated. Although the Lost Land was not a real big barren system, it made people mistakenly enter into the big barren systems.

The big barren systems contained the remnants of Sacred. It was weird how Sacred's downfall came about. After their demise, the lands once governed by Sacred became dead zones. Countless mutant xenogeneics roamed what was left.

They were different from ordinary xenogeneics. Xenogeneics in the big barren systems had mutated a great deal. They were far stronger than their counterparts of the same level, and they all seemed frenzied. They all had an insatiable bloodlust.

Even if a deified elite entered, unless they were true gods, it was highly unlikely they'd emerge from that place alive.

"The king sent many of us deifieds to capture Han Sen," Meng Lie said. "If we go back now, we cannot complete the objective given to us."

"Yeah. If we go back now, we really cannot finish our task," Second Uncle said. He nodded and went on to say, "It should be fine. If Han Sen was able to enter this place, then we can go in too. I do not think he would dare to venture into the big barren systems. He is probably just hiding someplace in the Lost Lands."

Everyone knew it was dangerous, but they also knew they could not go back without completing their objective. They were hoping to get Han Sen in the Lost Lands, so they agreed to go. If they did not fall into the big barren systems, they would be fine.

Second Uncle looked at Han Sen and said, "Holy Baby, the Lost Lands are too dangerous. You should not risk it. Let us have Bao Ying take you back."

Han Sen was not going to go back. With much braveness, he said, "I am a part of the Extreme King now, just like you, and I am the king's student. I cannot just turn back. That would be an embarrassment to the king. Please, Second Uncle, take me. I want to contribute to the Extreme King."

Han Sen said that via his mouth, but in his mind he thought, I am actually thinking that if I have the chance to enter the big barren systems, I might be able to seek out Littleflower. It would be great to go with you guys and do something like that. That means I have free muscle to guide me and cannon fodder to bite bullets on my behalf. I just hope this fake Han Sen we're after entered the big barren systems.

Hearing Han Sen say that, Second Uncle and everyone else looked at him like a star. But they thought it was not nonsense that Bai King had selected him as a student.

"If you really feel that way, let us push on! Let's capture Han Sen and accomplish our goal." Second Uncle nodded.

Meng Lie's attitude toward Han Sen was fairly nice. Before this, people weren't really fond of the idea that Bai King had accepted an outsider for a student.

They still weren't keen on who the student was, but he had scored a few points by feigning dedication to their cause.

Everybody entered the Lost Land. This was the first time Han Sen had ever been there. He saw the magnetic fields and light fizz in the skies, creating strange scenes.

A black hole was spinning in the halo, and some spots of light moving around really quickly like lightning. Some strings of light were all twisted. The Lost Land was a magical place. There were many things there that Han Sen had never seen before.

After entering the Lost Land, Ger's power stopped working. He looked depressed as he said, "My power needs an environment and space. The space here has been disturbed too much. It's twisted. I can barely grasp the faint semblance of an image here."

"Bao Ying, I guess it all falls on you. We are depending on you." Second Uncle seemed to have expected this would happen, so he addressed Bao Ying directly.

Everyone turned to look at Bao Ying. Han Sen was curious about what sort of power Bao Ying had. Her identity was still veiled in secrecy. It sparked some curiosity inside Han Sen.

Bao Ying nodded. She took out a jade bottle and held it in her hands. It was the same white jade bottle Han Sen had recently seen. It was likely her geno armament.

Bao Ying held her jade bottle up and said, "I need something that belongs to Han Sen."

"That is easy. Ger." Second Uncle waved at Ger.

Ger raised a hand. His fingerprints were laden with dust. He said, "Lady Bao Ying, this is the trail I have been tracking. It is only this much. Is that enough?"

"Let's give it a try." Bao Ying took the specks of dust and placed them inside the vase.

Han Sen saw strange movement inside the vase. Bao Ying quickly tilted the jade bottle. It was like she was pouring out water, but what came out from the bottle was not water. They were many sakura petals.

The petals were like butterflies, and they all took off flying in a certain direction. The petals were everywhere. They looked quite beautiful.

"Follow me." Bao Ying held onto her jade bottle as she started moving. The petals kept coming out of the bottle to lead the way.

Via the guidance of the petals, the group traveled quickly through the Lost Land. Thus far, there had been no danger.

Bao Ying's geno armaments are quite unique. I cannot tell what sort of power that is. Seeing those petals, it seems to suggest it might be a plant element. But there is no way the jade bottle is composed of something from the plant element." Han Sen was unable to use his Dongxuan Area, so his curiosity was at an all-time high. He had no idea what they were.

"Why did the petals fly into the black hole?" Bao Qin asked with shock.

Everyone saw that happen too. The petals, which were like a galaxy, were now flocking into the black hole ahead of them. After the petals entered the black hole, they disappeared. Soon, a majority of the petals had vanished.

Second Uncle looked at Bao Ying and asked, "Bao Ying, what is going on?"

"If the dust did come from Han Sen, then he really did go through this black hole," Bao Ying said that and paused. She looked at the black hole and said, "The petals are still alive after traveling through the black hole. They were not killed. This should be one of the more stable black holes. You can travel through it."

"I am afraid this is a black hole that leads to the big barren system. It is easy to go in, but how do we get out?" Bao Qin was displaying a wry smile.

"Bao Ying, do you have any other way to learn more about the situation as it currently stands?" Second Uncle asked.

Bao Ying shook her head. "I think it is too far away. I still feel the petals, but I cannot sense anything else."

"If it is so far away, this black hole might truly lead to the big barren systems. Fourth Brother, what do you think?" Second Uncle looked at Meng Lie, who was on par with Second Uncle in terms of command.

"If this is a stable black hole, why don't we go scope it out first?" Meng Lie suggested. "If there is any danger, we can just hop back through the black hole."

"Does it work that way?" Second Uncle looked at Bao Ying.

"We can try." Bao Ying looked at the black hole. She raised her jade bottle, which had a weird light spinning inside it. There was a galaxy-like number of petals returning from the black hole. They all returned to the jade bottle.

When the last petal returned to the jade bottle, Bao Ying said, "All of the petals are accounted for, and none of them were damaged during transport."
