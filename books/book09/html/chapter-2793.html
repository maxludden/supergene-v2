<h2>Leveling Up to Transmutation</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2793</h3>

<p>Han Sen felt as if his body was brimming with a strange sort of
power. It was like he was peeling off his skin. His gene database
kept refreshing by purging old genes and replacing them with new
ones that carried a different message. His body had changes that
flipped the ground and the sky. Black air was emitted out of his
body. It formed a giant cocoon that wholly encased him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt rather happy. It was fortunate he had locked up the
red-robed child inside Destiny’s Tower. He was unable to move now,
so it was lucky that he had not given the child a chance to run
amuck while he was busy.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought his evolution process would be over soon, but
his body kept on changing. He was like that for an entire month.
Still, he had not finished evolving.</p>
<p>Because his body was always changing, he could not pause for a
timeout. He had to continue without a break. He had to be patient
and wait for it all to be over.</p>
<p>He waited a long time. He eventually passed the two-month mark.
It was on day 70 that he felt as if his body had stopped changing.
The gene database stopped renewing. Nothing was being released from
his body anymore.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The black ball, which was like a cocoon, was broken. Han Sen
walked out of it.</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>Han Sen stepped onto thin air, which resulted in him falling to
the ground. His face almost got crushed. He clutched his face
painfully while his eyes dropped tears.</p>
<p>Where is my power? Han Sen was shocked. He no longer felt any
power in his body. It was like he was just a commoner that had
never bothered to practice. He would not have fallen over and felt
pain if he had his power.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly examined his body. What he saw made him freeze
where he was.</p>
<p>He had a small shoulder and small legs. They looked white and
cute. Han Sen was shocked. He looked like a child that was only 6
years old. He looked just like the red-robed child. He was inside
his body now.</p>
<p>Han Sen ran toward a mirror and looked. He saw that he was now
indeed a 5- to 6-year-old boy. Yet, he remembered that when he was
that age, he did not look like his current appearance.</p>
<p>The little boy in the mirror had black eyes and black hair. His
face looked as pale as a crystal. His facial structure was very
beautiful. He looked rather feminine.</p>
<p>Han Sen now knew why he was like this. When he combined with
Spell, he was likely bound to look a bit more feminine.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to cancel his combination, but it was no longer
working. He felt no power in his body. It really was like he had
the body of an average child.</p>
<p>How could I end up like this? Did something happen while I was
leveling up? Han Sen’s head flooded with a barrage of questions. He
quickly went to check his status.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although his power had gone, his Sea of Soul and
beast souls were still accessible. Han Sen then saw his status.</p>

<p>That is all correct. I leveled up to transmutation class, but
why is my body like this? And, why am I unable to use my power. Han
Sen’s heart flashed with many questions, but he could not find the
answers.</p>
<p>On a plane full of yellow sand, a man was stepping across the
yellow sand. He was walking. The sand, which was over the sky, did
not touch his clothes.</p>
<p>There was a valley not far through the desert. The man saw the
valley. He squinted his eyes and walked toward it.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>When the man had almost reached the valley, a bullet shot the
ground near his feet. It touched his shoes and hit the sand.</p>
<p>“This is not a place for people to travel,” the valley boomed
with a very loud voice.</p>
<p>“Are you Holy Pirate of the Pirates? My name is Bai Wanjie. I
would like to conduct business with Mister Holy Pirate.” Bai Wanjie
no longer walked forward. He stopped and tried to discuss it with
the valley.</p>
<p>“The Extreme King Prince Bai Wanjie?” The voice came from the
valley again. It was obviously confused by the traveler’s
announcement.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is me,” Bai Wanjie answered.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Is your old man Bai King here? If he is, he can talk to
me. You are just a pompous junior who does not have what it takes
to talk to me.” The voice sounded cold again.</p>
<p>“I have heard Mister Holy Pirate loves to research drawings.
There is a sky silk picture that belongs to my race. I was
wondering if you are interested in it, Mister Holy Pirate.” Bai
Wanjie pulled out a scroll that contained the drawing.</p>
<p>“Is it the sky silk picture that belonged to Shadow King?” While
he was talking, the shadow of an old man appeared in front of Bai
Wanjie. He stared at the painting in his hands.</p>
<p>“Yes, it belonged to Shadow King, our ancestor,” Bai Wanjie said
to him with a smile. “It is Shadow King’s sky silk picture. It was
drawn by him. I wonder if Mister Holy Pirate is interested in
obtaining it.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” The old man looked at Bai Wanjie.</p>
<p>“I would like Mister Holy Pirate to steal one thing for me,” Bai
Wanjie said in a serious tone. “Regardless of your success or
failure, I will give you this sky silk picture.”</p>
<p>“Is there a place the Extreme King cannot access?” the old man
asked while squinting his eyes. “There is no way you are asking me
to go to Outer Sky to steal something.”</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie shook his head. “I would like Mister Holy Pirate to
go and steal something from the Space Garden.”</p>
<p>“Space Garden? Indeed, that is an annoying place. Aside from me,
the Holy Pirate, no one else can force their way in.” The old man
nodded and asked, “What do you want me to steal for you? You should
know that there are three rules we bind ourselves to.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I know about Mister Holy Pirate’s pirate code,” Bai
Wanjie said with a smile. “What I want Mister Holy Pirate to steal
is a 5- to 6-year-old kid. He is just a kid, but he is actually a
xenogeneic. Stealing xenogeneics should not go against Mister Holy
Pirate’s three sacred rules.”</p>
<p>An hour later, Bai Wanjie left the valley with a smile. The sky
silk picture was no longer in his possession.</p>
<p>“That Holy Pirate agreed to help me. This is surely a done deal.
If I can steal that child, the Space Garden will belong to me.” Bai
Wanjie’s smile grew deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Although Bai Wanjie did not see Han Sen claim the red-robed
child, he saw Han Sen take the red-robed child to save the Flower
Gods. He was able to guess that the red-robed child was doing
something special.</p>
<p>But the Space Garden was already in Han Sen’s hands. It was too
hard for outsiders to infiltrate, and Bai Wanjie wanted to take the
Space Garden all for himself. He did not say this to the superiors
of the Extreme King, so he eventually thought of the Holy Pirate of
the Pirates.</p>
<p>The Pirates had been in the universe for many years. Only one
person was able to possess the title of Holy Pirate. The reason why
only he had become so famous was that he was the only one who was
able to sneak into Outer Sky and steal something. He made it out
alive. Everyone thought he was the best pirate, so he earned the
reputation of being able to steal anything and everything.</p>
