<p>“You are crazy. That word suits you very well,” Liyu Zhen coldly
grunted.</p>
<p>He had to be insane. And Liyu Zhen wasn’t the only person
thinking that. Even Open Sky Elder and the people who wanted Han
Sen to win believed everything he had said was way too crazy.</p>
<p>The path was the universe. The universe was the path. When they
considered Han Sen’s words, he seemed to be saying that his life
was the sole reason for the universe to exist. If Han Sen died, the
universe would die along with him.</p>
<p>Across history, even the true god elites wouldn’t have dared to
say something like that. There were not many true god elites, but
there were a few in every era. How many were currently alive was
unknown, though. And even when they died, the universe never died
along with them. And right now, Han Sen was someone who had just
become half-deified.</p>
<p>In truth, his words didn’t even qualify as crazy. They were
simply ignorant.</p>
<p>But people misunderstood what Han Sen meant. The “I” he was
referring to did not mean himself. He was referring to
everything.</p>
<p>Everyone was like a chess piece. They were controlled by the
strings of fate, but without those chess pieces, the chessboard was
meaningless. It didn’t matter how good a chessboard was, it was a
dead object. The chess pieces could lead to many events and
combinations of moves, which was what led to a path. A chess piece
led to a path and a road to traverse. Without a chess piece, there
was no path.</p>
<p>When Han Sen understood the meaning of this, happiness rolled
through him. He was too happy. And it was that glee that prompted
him to speak it out.</p>
<p>People thought Han Sen was crazy and ignorant. Only Li Keer and
Exquisite could understand the way Han Sen truly felt. Their pretty
eyes fluttered strangely.</p>
<p>Han Sen had gained understanding, which meant they understood as
well. They were drowned in the will of Under the Sky. That will was
so strong that they would only see something like this in a select
few of the strongest Very High currently living.</p>
<p>But on this day, under the influence of that powerful will, they
had learned something new. How could they not be surprised and
happy?</p>
<p>“This understanding is already beyond what a normal deified
could manage…” Li Keer had a very complex look on her face. She was
happy, but she also couldn’t believe what she was witnessing. Han
Sen was only a half-deified, and yet, he could understand the
entirety of that will.</p>
<p>Han Sen had self-learned all of this. And his Under the Sky
knife skills were supremely strong now. Before, he only used
knives. But now, the knives were infused with his own understanding
and knowledge. It was like he had given life to a concept.</p>
<p>Before, although Han Sen hadn’t been injured by Shale, he had
seemed to be on the brink of disaster. Han Sen had only been
hanging on by a thread, and he could have been killed at any
moment.</p>
<p>But now, all of a sudden, things seemed different. Han Sen was
still suppressed by Shale, but the audience sensed that he was more
relaxed than ever. Even within this danger, he seemed to be oh so
relaxed. He didn’t feel nervous or crushed.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his hands like they were knives. The knife skills
he deployed had a solid feeling to them. And it made people feel as
if he had set things up like this deliberately. But now, Han Sen
could use his skills at will, with almost casual ease. It was like
every attack was unleashed randomly, yet he continued to fight with
the exact same precision, and sometimes even more.</p>
<p>“The sky and the ground are a chessboard, and I am the chess
piece. Every breath and every sense are a path.” Han Sen was
totally drowned in the will of Under the Sky. As his knowledge of
it deepened, his attacks seemed to become even more random. But at
the same time, it seemed like the universe itself was guiding his
movements. As attacks rained down on him, there was a sinking
feeling in Shale’s gut.</p>
<p>Yes, he was feeling terrible. Although Han Sen wasn’t putting
him in any serious danger, Shale felt as if everything had gone
horribly wrong.</p>
<p>He couldn’t tell what precisely had gone wrong, but everything
about the fight now seemed… off.</p>
<p>The mountains were wrong. The rocks were wrong. Everything was
wrong. It felt as if the world around him was now working against
him, while Han Sen was moving smoothly between sky and earth. It
was like everything was working to assist Han Sen. Shale didn’t
know what to do.</p>
<p>“This… isn’t this Sky and Men Combined Together, a technique
from the Very High Sense?” Li Chun Qiu and the others who studied
the Very High Sense looked at Han Sen as if they were seeing a
ghost, with their eyes wide open.</p>
<p>By practicing the Very High Sense, one could practice Sky and
Men Combined Together. By connecting the skill with the universe,
the sky, and the ground, a practitioner could use it to borrow the
power of the universe.</p>
<p>But that power was only available to those who practiced the
Very High Sense. Only they should have been able to do what Han Sen
was doing. Exquisite could only barely scratch the surface of
learning it. She wasn’t fully proficient with Sky and Men Combined
Together.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never studied the Very High Sense, but the knife
skills he got from the Textless Book had achieved the same effect
as Sky and Men Combined Together. How could Li Chun Qiu and the
others not be shocked?</p>
<p>Even those who practiced the Very High Sense found themselves
shuddering. Despite his emotional detachment, Li Chun Qiu was
stunned.</p>
<p>“This kid is so weird…” Open Sky Elder mumbled.</p>
<p>He and Qiyu Elder hadn’t practiced the Very High Sense, but they
were behaving as if they had never eaten pork and were now seeing a
pig run. They had experienced a lot over their lives, and even if
they hadn’t practiced the Very High Sense personally, they knew a
lot about it.</p>
<p>Right now, Han Sen’s knife skills resembled the Very High Sense
and Sky and Men Combined Together. They were shocked.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t think that much about it. He was submerged in
the aura of his knife mind.</p>
<p>In this universe, every blade of grass, block of wood, mountain,
drop of water, and even specks of dust and bacteria, they all
seemed to harness a meaning in his eyes. It was like it all had
some kind of connection with his knife skills.</p>
<p>“Everything in this world is a chess piece. Every chess piece
can be used in a certain way. And you combine all these pieces to
compose a game of chess. The chess piece that isn’t connected is
actually connected. Every chess piece can affect the entirety of
the game. And what I need to do is become a chess piece that can
change the course of this game of chess.” Han Sen kept trying to
understand. “I don’t need a special power. I only need to use my
power in a place that requires me the most. If I go swimming, I
would be a fish. If I went into the sky, I would be a bird. I would
go along with the universe, the sky, and the earth. And I will help
the sky, the earth, and the universe.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s knife skills were becoming more and more
unpredictable, and those random attacks were causing Shale a lot of
trouble.</p>
<p>The Very High that had previously mocked Han Sen for being crazy
and ignorant had now fallen silent. Han Sen should have been at an
incredible disadvantage, but right now, he didn’t seem to be
struggling at all.</p>
<p>Instead, Shale’s attacks were the ones that seemed stiff. They
didn’t seem so smooth anymore.</p>
<p>“How very interesting. He’s used Under the Sky to create Sky and
Men Combined Together… Those Very High elders are going to go crazy
with jealousy…” As Yu Shanxin watched Han Sen’s remarkable knife
skill, the corners of his mouth rose. His smile was strange and
unreadable.</p>
