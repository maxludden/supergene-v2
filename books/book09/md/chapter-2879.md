A white, jade crown slowly fell on Han Sen. It landed atop his head. Holy light was spinning from the white jade crown. As the presence came out, it was like a God Spirit. A very strange God Spirit power came out from the white jade crown. It fell onto Han Sen and turned him into a being who looked like a God Spirit.

A message came out from the white jade crown. It was in Han Sen’s brain. It delivered him many messages.

[Sky God Crown: Destroyed class god personality armament]

Regarding how to use Sky God Crown, it also showed up in Han Sen’s head. He was instantly able to understand what power the Sky God Crown had.

“I see. It does not give me the god personality to become a God Spirit. It uses Sky God Crown’s power to give me the authority of coming in and out of the geno hall like a God Spirit.” Han Sen understood how he was supposed to use the Sky God Crown. He now knew what was going on. After figuring it out, Han Sen felt rather angry because every being in the top 100 had a true god weapon. A god personality armament was just like a true god class weapon. Han Sen didn’t feel as if there was much difference between the Sky Vine Radish God Lance and the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. They were practically the same level. He had earned first place, but he had only earned a god personality armament. Aside from enabling him to enter the geno hall, it did nothing. It did not seem particularly useful. While Han Sen was still thinking, the geno god list started to move. It teleported him back to the Extreme King garden.

“Congratulations. I was not expecting you to be No. 1,” God said with a smile. “You are being too cheap,” Han Sen complained. “Why does the No. 1 spot only earn a god personality armament? Second and third earned a god personality armament too, and the first received the same. That is not supposed to be the ultimate prize for No. 1, right?”

God looked at him with disdain as he said, “You have no idea of the luck you have now. They are destroyed class god personality armaments, just like your Sky Vine Radish God Lance. This god personality armament is destroyed class as well, but it is not the same. Plus, the Sky God Crown grants you passage into the geno hall. Do you know how many elites have craved that power across all of time?”

“What is the level of the god personality armament’s level? Is the destroyed class stronger than the destroyed class?” Han Sen quickly asked.

“You will know once you enter the geno hall,” God said with a smile. “Your little doggie went there. Are you not going to go take a look?”

“Cough! I am busy. I am not going yet.” Han Sen then asked, “Is it dangerous in the geno hall? With my current might, do you think I will end up in danger if I stay there for a while?”

“I do not know.” God was being tight-lipped about Han Sen’s fear. He ignored him and stopped answering his questions.

Han Sen wanted to go to the geno hall to take a look, especially since Little Gold Gold was in there. He wanted to go.

Yet, Han Sen still wanted to wait to become a true god before attempting to enter. If he wasn’t, he feared he would just become a burden for Little Gold Gold. That would be depressing and possibly make Little Gold Gold’s situation worse.

“I wonder when Wan’er will wake up. Otherwise, if she keeps staying next to me, suppressing my super God Spirit body, I cannot use my Super God Spirit mode for a long time. It stops me from doing what I want.” Han Sen looked at Destiny’s Tower, which was where Wan’er was. She was still fast asleep, but she looked much calmer than usual. Her lifeforce was lively and much better than the last time he saw her.

Dollar had been recognized as the top spot on the geno god list, and Golden Growler had entered the geno hall. Plus, Dollar and Golden Growler had a strange encounter. It made the geno god list fight the topic of many conversations. For a long time, the entire universe talked about them. Dollar and Golden Growler’s name became famous across the universe.

Many big races tried investigating where Dollar came from, which included Empty Mountain. No progress was made. No one was able to figure out where the elusive Dollar had come from.

No one was able to figure out anything more about the strange title of “human” either. Some old antiques knew about the existence of humans, but Dollar exuded the presence of a xenogeneic. He was different from the blue-blooded humans. They were not of the same race.

From what they had seen, the geno god list did have a human fighter, but he was not like Dollar. That human was Lou Lie, and he was ranked fourth.

“How do I go to the Buddha without anyone noticing me?” Han Sen had been killing xenogeneics in the Nine-Defense Palace to earn genes, but there were not many high-level xenogeneics in the palace. Han Sen had to eat butterfly class xenogeneics to increase his genes, so his level up progress was slow.

He wanted to go to the Buddha to get his knife back. He also wanted to get his revenge on Burning Lamp, who had turned him into an ant and harmed Yisha.

When he went back to the Buddha, he would use his Han Sen identity. He was going to get proper revenge. With Dollar’s name, even if he took the knife back, it would be pointless. Now that he had God next to him, if he was to become Han Sen, he would be exposed. He did not want that to happen.

Han Sen kept thinking of a way to solve this, but he came up empty. God seemed fairly ordinary and more like an uncle. He seemed to know a lot of things most of the time, but he also seemed weaker than very high-level gods, such as King Jun. Even so, the pressure Han Sen felt was greater than with King Jun. Han Sen was a bit worried, so he did not dare do too much.

While Han Sen was thinking about how to get rid of God, God approached him and said, “I am leaving for a while.”

Han Sen almost thought it was because he had been able to read his mind, and that was why he said it.

“That is a shame,” Han Sen replied. “I would like to play more rounds of chess with you.” “It is fine,” God said with a laugh. “I am going back to do something. I will be back in a few days.”

“Why are you in so much of a rush? What can be more important than playing chess?” Han Sen feigned surprise.

“The geno hall has a new member, so I am going to take a look,” God casually said.

“Are you visiting Golden Growler?” Han Sen’s heart sank. He did not think getting watched by God was a good thing.

“It is just an average, expected procedure,” God said with a laugh. “Since I know you, if he is in any danger, I will make sure to inform you.”

“Thanks a lot.” Although Han Sen said that, he thought there was something wrong. He thought, “Is he going to convince Little Gold Gold to push me to enter the geno hall?”
