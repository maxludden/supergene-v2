      It happened in a millisecond. The Blood Dog’s body suddenly split up into
      multiple parts, and they all became smaller Blood Bats. They then flew
      towards Dragon Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady was not weak; she was a king spirit, after all. She was also
      one of the strongest king spirits there was. Seeing the Blood Bats come
      towards her, though, she couldn’t help but scream. She summoned a big pot
      out of the sky and used it to trap the Blood Bats inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next second, Dragon Lady flipped the palms of her hands over. A
      fire began to blaze at the bottom of the pot, with the intent of cooking
      the bats that were trapped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bats inside all gathered up together, becoming a Blood Dog once more.
      With canine strength, it leaped up and knocked the lid open. Then the
      beast leaped towards Dragon Lady once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady summoned a cleaver and a frying pan. With both of them held
      akimbo, she did battle with the dog as if she was using a sword and
      shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised by what he was seeing. It was rare to see a spirit
      with so many different geno cores. It was almost as if she had more than
      Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, she had told Han Sen that her geno core was a set While
      it did look as if she had many geno cores, all her summoned cooking
      utensils were from the same geno core. Because of that, she could only
      take one rank on the leaderboards, unlike Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that magical geno core and the power she possessed, the king class
      Dragon Lady was able to do combat with Blood Dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field they were on was an unfortunate place for them to be, though.
      When volatile powers were cast, the ground was churned inside out and
      destroyed. Scars were left everywhere across the landscape, and it was
      difficult to find an open space with decent footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady’s fork could not stop the dog for long, so she tried slashing
      it But when she did, Blood Dog again became a swarm of bats. They raced
      towards her and bit her. When that was done, they reverted to the shape of
      a dog again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood Dog looked immortal, and Dragon Lady’s methods left her unable to do
      anything significant. If that were to continue, it was only a matter of
      time before she lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was in no rush to fight, though. That was because Blood Dog had
      immortal powers. Even if he did strike, it did not seem as if it would
      help. He knew he’d have to find a weakspot first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physical power did not seem to work. Dragon Lady’s cleaver had whacked the
      beast a few times, and she had even brought it down on the monster’s neck,
      but none of that seemed to do a speck of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any blood that was sprayed would turn into bats, and they’d fly back to
      the dog and heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After watching the beast for a while, Han Sen could not determine its
      weakspot. Dragon Lady was also starting to struggle. So, Han Sen decided
      to summon Golden Growler and see how capable he was at fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally, mount beast souls could not fight. But Golden Growler was
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was summoned, Golden Growler roared. It ran towards Blood Dog with
      insane speed. It was a far faster creature than Blood Dog was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood Dog wished to dodge Golden Growler, but Golden Growler already had
      its mouth open. While its body was the same size as an ordinary lion, its
      maw opened to the size of a house. Blood Dog was unable to dodge, and it
      was scooped up by Golden Growler’s mouth in a flash. Then, it was chewed
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a wretched, crunching sound, as if the bones were all being
      broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t eat it! It’s my ingredient!” Dragon Lady quickly said. She was
      worried Golden Growler would swallow the dog and she’d lose her precious
      ingredient.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn’t happen, though. Golden Growler was only able to chew it for a
      while, before a swarm of bats came flying out of its mouth. When the bats
      reformed to the shape of a hound again, Blood Dog looked at Golden Growler
      with obvious fear. It wanted to fly and escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood Dog was incredibly fast, and it far outpaced Dragon Lady who was
      left unable to keep up.
    </p>
    <p>“Get up!” Han Sen mounted Golden Growler and spoke to Dragon Lady.</p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady jumped up behind Han Sen, and Golden Growler carried them both
      in the pursuit of Blood Dog. It was much faster than the summoned
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dog was very devious. It kept changing direction, and the
      lumbering Golden Growler was unable to keep up with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dragon Lady got close to Blood Dog, she slashed towards it But
      attacks such as that would not work on the fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you have a way to kill it?” Dragon Lady asked with a rush. She was
      obviously unable to kill it, and she had no choice but to ask Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know how to kill it, either. Blood Dog is invincible, it would
      seem. It’ll be very hard to kill.” Han Sen shook his head, as he hadn’t
      had any promising ideas yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady kept trying to kill Blood Dog. None of her attempts worked.
      Golden Growler chased the creature for ten thousand miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood Dog kept running and running, until it suddenly came to an abrupt
      stop. It turned around and smiled at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Dragon Lady were given a spooky shock by that smile. It wasn’t
      really a smile, it was more of a cruel, menacing grin. It was an evil
      display that only looked like a smile. It was, in fact, very scary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden Growler was not afraid, though; it continued after Blood Dog. The
      Blood Dog jumped toward the mountain in front of it, and when the Blood
      Dog hit the cliffside, it fell inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall did not break; it was like the dog could just fall through the
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden Growler was unable to do this, and when he came against the wall,
      he came crashing into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had a blackout. But he opened his Bulwark Umbrella to prevent any
      follow-up sneak attacks. When Han Sen’s consciousness returned, he
      discovered that he had not been attacked. But what he saw surprised him
      and Dragon Lady both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the wall was not an underground labyrinth; it was just a field.
      There were lots of fallen buildings there. There was half a tower
      scattered across the ground, and a palace comprised of slopes. There were
      many stone constructs there, but they were all in ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not look as if they had been built there, though. It was more as if
      someone had just thrown them all away, and dropped them there upon the
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t see where Blood Dog went to. He looked around and
      eventually found a human that was half-buried in the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was actually the effigy of a woman. She was adorned with a crown that
      was reminiscent of the sun. One of her hands held a book, and the other
      held a torch above her head.
    </p>
    <p>There were a few more statues about, but they were all destroyed.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the buildings and the statues, and he frowned. The style
      of the rock was similar to that which he found in the Valley of Time. The
      stone was very similar.
