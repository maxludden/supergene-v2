Thousand Mile Reach was very shocked. He almost forgot the way out while leaving Feng Castle.

“That man had to be Jian Bu Gu. It has to be! It has to be Teacher Jian, but how could he…” Thousand Mile Reach was very confused. He could not understand why Grand Teacher Jian Bu Gu would call himself Han Sen’s servant. That was far too shocking.

That was Jian Bu Gu. He was one of the very few elites in the Qin Kingdom. Not even the likes of the almighty Wu Dao Palace were able to overcome him. They had all been kicked out by him. They were not even able to start up religion in the Qin Kingdom.

Full of suspicious emotions, Thousand Mile Reach returned to the palace and went straight to speak with King Jing Zhen.

Thousand Mile Reach said with a smile, “My King, I am useless. I was unable to bring Mister Crown Prince back.”

“Oh? Is my son really being that stubborn this time?” King Jing Zhen was truly surprised.

“Mister Crown Prince is very stubborn,” Thousand Mile Reach replied. “Han Sen did not ask anything, yet he did insist on staying in the Feng castle.”

King Jing Zhen nodded. He looked at Thousand Mile Reach and felt strange. “Teacher, you do not seem to be looking so good.”

“My King, I used the chess world to deal with Han Sen, but I was the one who ended up being hurt by him,” Thousand Mile Reach said with a bitter look. “I believe he must have a very special God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It might be an Annihilation class God Spirit Blood-Pulse that features mental powers.”

From what he knew, the ability to survive his chess world and use strong enough psychological powers to take over and control the chess world meant the man had to have had a stronger God Spirit Blood-Pulse. There was no other explanation.

“Annihilation class God Spirit Blood-Pulse?” King Jing Zhen frowned. In the whole universe of kingdoms, they had only found 12 Annihilation class god temples. King Qin was the strongest. One country had four Annihilation class god temples, which was why the Qin Kingdom was once so powerful.

The other six big kingdoms usually only had one or two Annihilation class god temples. The strongest one only had three Annihilation class god temples.

The Qin Kingdom had four Annihilation class god temples, two of which were controlled by the royals. The other two were under the command of other nobles who were not from the Qin Kingdom. After their country was destroyed, they came to the Qin Kingdom and became pillars of it. In fact, after the Qin Kingdom established its law system, many elites flocked to the Qin Kingdom. Naturally, that led to a strengthening of the Qin Kingdom. That was why the Qin Kingdom maintained its law system and the king and officers kept talking about it.

Aside from the 12 annihilation class god temples, it was not like there weren’t other ways to get an Annihilation class God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Within some super God Spirit Blood-Pulse, there were original God Spirit Blood-Pulse and weird scenes. If one was lucky enough to find one, one could get an Annihilation class God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Those God Spirit Blood-Pulse were considered wild.

Because there weren’t any god temples, there were no God Spirits combine buffs. Thus, wild God Spirit Blood-Pulse were usually weaker than the average God Spirit Blood-Pulse.

No matter how weak they were, Annihilation God Spirit Blood – Pulse were frightening regardless of where they came from. They made King Jing Zhen take such a thing very seriously.

King Jing Zhen frowned and said, “This Han Sen has an Annihilation God Spirit Blood – Pulse and is that close with the crown prince. Is there some kind of trick or conspiracy at play here?”

Thousand Mile Reach looked weird as he said, “My King, I do not know if there is a problem with Han Sen, but I saw Jian Bu Gu by his side.”

“What? Are you talking about my teacher?” King Jing Zhen stood up with his eyes wide open.

To King Jing Zhen, Jian Bu Gu was not just a teacher. It was like the relationship between Thousand Mile Reach and Qin Bai. Jian Bu Gu watched King Jing Zhen grow up. He was not just an officer. They were more like father and son. Deep inside King Jing Zhen’s heart, Jian Bu Gu was a very special person whom he had relied on. It was not something people easily understood.

Jian Bu Gu was different from Thousand Mile Reach. He was not a harsh teacher, but he had shaped King Jing Zhen into becoming a good king.

Ten years ago, King Jing Zhen wanted to kick Wu Wei Dao Palace out of the Qin Kingdom. He forced Jian Bu Gu, who had deep ties with the Wu Wei Dao Palace, to fight them.

Jian Bu Gu followed the orders and went to the Wu Wei Dao Palace. He exiled them out of the Qin Kingdom. After that, Jian Bu Gu left a letter and quit his post. He made the promise never to fight again.

King Jing Zhen did not regret his decision. Wu Wei Dao Palace had affected many citizens. If he had not removed them, the government would not have been able to control the people. Plus, Jian Bu Gu was the only one who could have done it.

He did not regret it, but he did feel guilty about Jian Bu Gu. Over the years, he had sent many people to seek out Jian Bu Gu, but the seekers always came back empty-handed. He was shocked to hear he might have suddenly been found.

King Jing Zhen was shaking as he asked, “Teach… Teacher… How is he?”

Thousand Mile Reach’s expression looked strange. He opened his mouth, but he was unsure of what to say.

“Did something happen to him?” King Jing Zhen’s body shook. He understood Jian Bu Gu, who once said he would not fight for 20 years. He was the sort of person to see something like that through. Even if it cost him his life, he would not fight.

He had been worrying about that prospect. He was the one who sent Jian Bu Gu to fight strong enemies like the Wu Wei Dao Palace, and Jian Bu Gu lost the protection of the Qin Kingdom without the ability to defend himself. It was hard to imagine the consequences of something like this. He was worried Jian Bu Gu was dead.

“No, no, no. You misunderstand. Teacher Jian is fine. He is not injured, but…” Thousand Mile Reach hesitated. He could not say it.

“Mister Thousand Mile, stop hesitating. What is the matter?” King Jing Zhen now knew Jian Bu Gu was alive. While he was relieved to hear that, he still wanted to learn more about his condition.

Thousand Mile Reach gnashed his teeth and said, “Jian Bu Gu told me Han Sen was his master.”

“What?” King Jing Zhen was shocked, which turned into anger. He chomped down on his teeth hard as he shouted, “Goddamn that Han Sen! How dare he humiliate my teacher! I am going to kill everyone he knows!”

“Please, don’t be mad,” Thousand Mile Reach quickly implored. “Teacher Jian is very strong. If he was not willing to, not even a sky full of spirits could make him kneel. I do not think Teacher Jian was forced. He was really polite to Han Sen. I think there has to be a good reason for it.”

King Jing Zhen was not a tyrant. After thinking about it for a bit, his anger faded.

“Teacher Jian was next to Han Sen when I saw him today,” Thousand Mile Reach said. “I think he is going to protect Han Sen. If you kill Han Sen, it might destroy Teacher Jian’s plan.”

King Jing Zhen nodded. “If the teacher is next to Han Sen and that guy has a problem, the teacher would do something. If the teacher does not mind him and does not stop my son from getting close with him, I guess Han Sen is an OK individual.”

After pausing a moment, King Jing Zhen presented a wry smile. “The trouble Han Sen has stirred up makes this a difficult situation to navigate.”
