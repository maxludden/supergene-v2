A very powerful xenogeneic... It looks like it is not just primitive deified. Han Sen knew that his arrows wouldn't be able to hurt the fiend. Before his body recovered, he did not think he would be able to do anything to it.

The xenogeneic did not react, though. It just coldly looked at Han Sen as if he was a clown.

So, Han Sen did not persist attacking. He exited the palace labeled 0002 and decided to check out a few more of the palaces. He noticed that 0003 and 0004 were empty. When he reached palace 0005, he saw another xenogeneic.

This time, Han Sen did not strike. That was because he did not need to strike. He saw the scary xenogeneic, which looked like a snow dragon, was breathing out an icy, snowy presence. Han Sen knew it was a larvae class with just one glance. Thus, he knew he could not kill it anytime soon.

I do not know how many deified xenogeneics are locked up here, but the quality of them is too high. Han Sen decided to stop looking. That Black Demon Ape xenogeneic gene was enough for him to eat for the next few days.

He dragged the body of the Black Demon Ape out of the Nine-Defense Palace. After he left the Nine-Defense Palace, he did not keep using his beast soul. He called on a few of the Extreme King guards to help him drag the Black Demon Ape's body back to the palace.

Han Sen soon noticed that the guards and the maids in the palace were looking at him strangely.

"Why are you looking at me?" Han Sen asked one of the maids.

"I am sorry, Mister Holy Baby." The maid looked scared. She swiftly kneeled upon the floor.

"I asked, why are you looking at me. Why don't you just answer me?" Han Sen frowned.

"I... I..." The maid was so shocked that she was unable to speak.

"You are very powerful, Mister Holy Baby." A voice stemmed from afar. It came from an elegant woman. She was dressed in extraordinarily beautiful clothes. She was of the Extreme King. She had many maids who all looked at Han Sen coldly.

"Who are you?" Han Sen knew this woman was likely one of Bai King's wives, but Bai King had too many wives. He did not recognize all of them. In fact, he did not care to learn the names of Bai King's wives.

"Xenogeneics really are xenogeneics. This guy has no manners." The elegant woman looked at Han Sen coldly but with pride.

"How dare you? Don't you bow before the queen?" a maid near her shouted.

"Oh, is this the teacher's wife?" Han Sen smiled, but he was not going to bow.

Bai King was the one who had forced him into adopting a new teacher. He never wanted to remain a student there, so he was not going to be respectful to all his wives.

Plus, if that woman was a queen, that meant she was Bai Wanjie and Bai Wuchang's mother. Those two guys were Han Sen's enemies. There was no need for him to respect her.

Han Sen thought the woman had gone there looking for trouble, so Han Sen was not going to just concede.

The queen looked more upset, so she addressed one of her maids. "Bao Ying, teach him the rules of this palace, just in case he creates trouble."

"Mister Holy Baby, you should bow to the queen." The maid, Bao Ying, was wearing a snow-white robe. It looked like a nun's robe, but she was not wearing a hood or veil. Her hair was done up in a bun.

Bao Ying's skin was as smooth as jade. She was extremely pretty. Her presence was like a fairy coming out of a plume of dust. Her face was so pretty that she looked like a perfect creation by God.

Bao Ying showed Han Sen how to perform the bow. It was a half-kneeled gesture. She did it very elegantly. When she lowered her head, her neck looked like a pale white jade. It was like the neck of a swan and extremely pretty.

"Bai King, that old man, is very lucky. Every woman in the palace is both pretty and stunning," Han Sen said to compliment her.

Han Sen was merely admiring Bao Ying, but he was not going to go ahead and perform what she had tried to teach him. The queen's face looked dimmer with each passing second. She eventually said, "Bao Ying, take him to the Manners Department to teach him a lesson or two."

"Yes," Bao Ying said. She looked at Han Sen and said, "Mister Holy Baby, please follow me to the Manners Department."

"I do not have time to go to the Manners Department. You guys can go on ahead." Han Sen said that and turned around, ready to return to his garden.

"I am sorry, Mister Holy Baby," Bao Ying said. She lifted her finger. It enabled a sakura flower to manifest atop its tip. It flew to Han Sen.

I can't believe she is so young yet is already deified. Han Sen was shocked by this. He immediately dodged the flower that was coming toward him.

But that sakura was like a living being. It was like a butterfly with wings, and it followed Han Sen's body as it moved. No matter what, he was unable to avoid it. He saw the sakura was about to land on him.

Han Sen's eyes froze as he flipped his hand. A skull appeared in his hand. The eye of the skull blew up with a green light and turned the sakura into nothing.

The skull was the Yin Head Ghost beast soul. Han Sen figured out it was a weapon beast soul. However, he had never wielded a weapon that was a skull before.

Its effectiveness was not bad, but it was just a little on the weak side. The green substance chains of the Yin Head Ghost had a total power weaker than the Six Core Snake Bow. Therefore, Han Sen did not use it much. He could have used his other beast souls in this situation, but he was happy to make use of this for the time being.

"He is resisting," the queen coldly said. "How dare you use a xenogeneic treasure inside the palace! Bao Ying, take him down!"

Bao Ying looked at Han Sen and sighed. "Mister Holy Baby, you should just come with me to the Manners Department."

"Bao Ying, I asked you to take him down!" The queen looked upset as she quietly but harshly made her demand.

"Yes." Bao Ying agreed. She reached out her hand and brought out a white, jade-like vase. It was quite small.

Han Sen knew it was Bao Ying's geno armament. He was not about to underestimate her. He held the skull and looked at the vase in Bao Ying's hand.

Seeing Bao Ying raise her vase, Bao King's voice suddenly boomed. "What are you doing?"

"My King!" Everyone bowed to Bai King.

Bai King approached the queen and looked at Han Sen as he asked, "My Queen, what are you doing here?"

The queen said, "This child is so rude. He disrespected me, and he used a xenogeneic treasure in the palace. I was just going to teach him a lesson. God knows how much trouble he might stir up in the future."

Bai King looked at Han Sen and asked. "Holy Baby, is that what happened?"

"Teacher, you should really watch your wife," Han Sen said with a smile. "When she is bored, she forces people to kneel before her. I do not have the time for that."

"My King, see how rude he is?" The queen was angered by his comments.

Upon seeing this scene, the maid's face looked weird. She had never seen someone speak to Bai King like that before. She expected him to get severely punished.

"Holy Baby is not being disrespectful. He is merely from a different race. Their manners and ways of showing respect are different. You do not have to force him to follow the rules we have imposed on ourselves." After Bai King said this, everyone was shocked. They thought they were dreaming.

"My King..." The queen looked terrible. She wished to say something, but Bai King interrupted her.

Bai King paused for a moment and said, "Alright, Shang Rong, I was looking for you. Holy Baby, you should go back now." He also spoke to Bao Ying. "He also needs to learn the rules. Bao Ying, you should try and teach Holy Baby the rules, but you can only teach him. You cannot hit him. Is that understood?"

"Yes, My King." Bao Ying awkwardly lowered her head.
