<p>The lantern’s light was suppressed by the knife stream. The area
that could be lit up for protection was small, so it could not
protect the whole holy palace. Some walls outside the holy palace
were hit by the knife streams. It left knife mark after another
knife mark on the stone walls.</p>
<p>It was unknown what the holy palace’s stone walls were made.
With the power of Han Sen’s knife airs, he was only able to leave
small marks upon the construct.</p>
<p>Even so, under the endless knife stream that attacked, the knife
marks in the stone wall grew greater. They all went by each other,
making it look like the walls were going to come undone.</p>
<p>The demon lady and the others were shocked. Back then, there
were five race lanterns there. During the battle, the holy palace
did not break.</p>
<p>Now, only three race lanterns were protecting the holy palace,
yet this was just Han Sen alone. It was not a god or some
spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen was operating alone, but he had the necessary might to
overcome the defensive attributes of the race stone lanterns that
were working in tandem with each other. It was too shocking.</p>
<p>Seeing the three stone lanterns were dying right there and then
and about to have their flames extinguished any second, the demon
lady, Old Vulture, and eyeless beast felt a bit of regret.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the creatures of the sanctuaries were just test
subjects left behind by Sacred Leader. Aside from Littleflower’s
body reaching the requirements needed for another that was as great
as Sacred Leader, which made him be considered one of the fruitful
test subjects, other creatures of the sanctuaries were deemed
failures of test subjects. They were not worth mentioning. They
were not worthy of them wasting their breath explaining.</p>
<p>Even though Han Sen had the Holy Kirin’s holy spirit, from what
they could tell, he only received it out of dumb luck. It was
because his soul was extra heavy.</p>
<p>The heaviness of the soul did not affect the talent practice.
The speed needed to level up, so they did not care too much about
it.</p>
<p>He could not use the holy spirit, which proved that Han Sen did
not have the necessary qualifications for replicating Sacred
Leader. He was considered a failed subject.</p>
<p>Who would thought that a failed test subject could suppress
three race lanterns with only a knife? He was going to break the
holy palace’s last line of defense.</p>
<p>If the holy palace was destroyed, the hope of rebuilding Sacred
would buckle with it. That was not something that had to do with
power. Without the holy palace, even if Littleflower’s holy body
became a true god and was as strong as Sacred Leader, it would only
lead to the repetition of history.</p>
<p>The demon lady and the others knew they needed this holy palace
and someone who could control the holy palace. That way, they could
fight against the God Spirits and the sky. They could rebuild the
past glory of Sacred and maintain it.</p>
<p>“If I was willing to have a nice chat with Han Sen, perhaps it
would not have come to this.” The demon lady was sad, but there was
no pill of regret to take. She sensed that Han Sen had a firm
resolve to destroy the holy palace.</p>
<p>There was a knife stream. It was like a galaxy falling. It
almost put out the three race lanterns. The radius of the light was
small. They were only able to light up a small portion of the holy
palace’s gate. The walls around the holy palace were hit by the
knife stream. Knife marks kept increasing. Stone and dust were
everywhere. They were watching the last hope of Sacred be torn down
by Han Sen’s knife stream.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Suddenly, there was a roaring sound. It sounded like a
lion or a tiger. It was coming toward them. A red shadow quickly
appeared out of the dark. It was like a crazy, running blob of
lava.</p>
<p>The demon lady, Old Vulture, and eyeless beast saw this. It made
them terribly happy. It was Red Ghost.</p>
<p>“Red Ghost, hurry up!” Old Vulture screamed with excitement.
“Light your race lantern! Let’s protect the holy palace!”</p>
<p>Red Ghost did not know what was going on, but he saw Han Sen
suppressing the demon lady and others with a knife. Even the holy
palace’s stone walls were about to buckle and fall. He could not
risk hesitating. He opened his mouth. A stone lantern appeared. It
went in front of the holy palace.</p>
<p>The four stone lanterns were all together. The fire inside the
three stone lanterns was almost gone. It was like they were now
filled with gas. The fire rose high. The holy palace was lit up,
and so was the plaza around them.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s scary knife stream hit the light. He was not able to
suppress the light. Four stone lanterns combined into one powerful
light, releasing a power that was not just one plus one equals two.
The four race lanterns were like a set. The power of the four
lanterns was greater than three lanterns. They had some special
buffs.</p>
<p>Old Vulture saw Han Sen was incapable of defeating the race
lanterns and so he mocked them. “Han Sen, no matter how strong your
body is, it is not a holy body. You cannot use a holy spirit
armament or a race lantern. You will never achieve what Sacred
Leader accomplished. After all, you are just a commoner.”</p>
<p>Although Han Sen tried his best, just like Old Vulture said, his
power was not enough to break the four stone lanterns’ defense.</p>
<p>Even Under the Sky Knife skill’s knife stream failed to do it.
Other geno arts were even worse off. He couldn’t break the
defensive attributes of the light.</p>
<p>“Do I really have to use my xenogeneic battle body?” Now, Han
Sen only had one way to increase his power. He only had the
xenogeneic battle body left. It would have increased his fitness a
lot, but no one knew if the xenogeneic battle body would be enough
to destroy the light’s defense.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are holding Sacred’s main lantern. You can try
it.” Sky Palace’s first seat’s voice came from not too far away. He
came out of the darkness and stood near the plaza.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Sky Palace’s first seat, the expressions of the
demon lady and the others immediately changed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Sky Palace’s first seat and asked, “What do
you mean?”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, Sacred has five race lanterns. There is one
superior lantern and four lesser ones. When Sacred was destroyed,
Sacred Leader used the five race lanterns to secure the holy
palace. Even the sky and the God Spirits did not get god benefits.
It left Sacred with some hope.” Sky Palace’s first seat looked at
the demon lady and their four stone lanterns. He went on to say,
“Sacred’s race lanterns are different from the race lanterns of
others. They have four subordinate race lanterns. One race lantern
is the primary one. The subordinate race lanterns can only protect.
They cannot trigger powerful power. Only the main race lantern can
buff the creature’s race power, and you can control the four
subordinate lanterns. Right now, Sacred’s main race lantern is in
your hands. If you can control it, you can control the four
subordinate race lanterns. If you want to break the holy palace, it
should be a piece of cake for you.”</p>
<p>The faces of the demon lady and the others changed. They did not
expect Sky Palace’s first seat to know so much about Sacred’s race
lanterns.</p>
<p>“You…” Old Vulture screamed. “You are all the dogs of God
Spirits. In the beginning, aside from Sacred elites like me and the
others, only the God Spirits saw the power of the race
lanterns.”</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat did not argue with him, nor did he feel
compelled to explain. He just went on to tell Han Sen, “Right now,
we need to see if you can control the primary race lantern. If you
can control it, everything is possible.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Sky Palace’s first seat and asked, “How is
this going to benefit you?”</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat quietly said, “I can only tell you that
people from Sky Palace do not want to see the second rise of
Sacred. I am being honest. You do not need to ask me, and I won’t
answer you.”</p>
