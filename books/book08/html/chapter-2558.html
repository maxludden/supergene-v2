<p>“Two thousand King xenogeneic genes? Why don’t you just go rob
someone?” Ji Yang Sheng was thinking. Ordinary King class people
wouldn’t have that many saved up.</p>
<p>Even a half-deified wouldn’t have that many King xenogeneic
genes in storage.</p>
<p>Apparently, Barr wasn’t a man who had stocked up an unbelievable
number of xenogeneic genes, either. So, his face looked pretty
gloomy.</p>
<p>With his personality being what it was, he wouldn’t have much in
the way of wealth. Although he could kill xenogeneics, he wouldn’t
be stockpiling their genes.</p>
<p>Even if he wanted to borrow them, he probably couldn’t. He had
no friends, after all. His only real friend was Dia Robber, but it
was unlikely that Dia Robber had that many to part with either.</p>
<p>“Sure. Wait until I collect the xenogeneic genes. When I have
what you have asked for, I will seek you out again,” Barr said.
Then, he opened the core area hall and departed.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t too concerned about this. Two thousand King
xenogeneic genes was a big number. If most Kings couldn’t pull that
many out of storage, it was doubly doubtful that Barr would be able
to.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had set this price to create a standard for the
people who were watching him. If others heard the price and offered
two thousand genes, then he wouldn’t mind exerting a little effort
to bless them in exchange.</p>
<p>If he had two thousand King xenogeneic genes, with the extra few
that he received via hunting, he would have enough to raise three
of his different areas to the ninth tier.</p>
<p>“He is crazy. Two thousand King genes. Can his blessing really
bring people up to the rank of deified?” a Demon mocked, upon
hearing this news.</p>
<p>Other people who had heard Han Sen’s conversation with Barr
thought the same thing. None of them could believe that Han Sen
could simply make another person deified. They thought something
special must have happened to Lando at the same time, or maybe some
sort of special treasure was used. Perhaps he made use of some
unknown force in that part of the universe. It couldn’t have been
Han Sen’s power alone that gave Lando the final push.</p>
<p>Of course, they accepted the fact that Han Sen’s power had some
sort of effect. But they didn’t think it was the sole reason that
Lando had become deified.</p>
<p>“Two thousand King class xenogeneic genes? That’s some easy
money. I’d bless someone for a thousand,” a half-deified Feather
grumbled to himself, dripping with disdain.</p>
<p>When the Fourth Uncle of the Extreme King Meng Lie heard this,
he frowned. The Sixth Uncle spoke up, saying, “This Han Sen is too
greedy. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes? Not even deified people
like you and I can get that many.”</p>
<p>“If he can really make someone deified, two thousand King class
genes is nothing,” Meng Lie replied.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? If this works, then why must we go to all
the trouble of practicing? Why don’t we all just go queue and await
his blessing?” Uncle Sixth asked with a look of scorn.</p>
<p>No one believed Barr would deliver Han Sen two thousand King
xenogeneic genes for a blessing. Not even Han Sen himself believed
something like that would happen.</p>
<p>A few Demons flew some distance away from Han Sen and shouted,
“Han Sen, two thousand King class xenogeneic genes is too
expensive. Can we haggle? We can pay one thousand King xenogeneic
genes for you to bless Mr. Ji.”</p>
<p>“No, but if you want to free him, you need to pay me five
hundred King class xenogeneic genes,” Han Sen said while pointing
at Ji Yang Sheng.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng was happy to hear this. He wanted the other Demons
to pay the xenogeneic gene ransom so he would never have to pull a
rickshaw ever again.</p>
<p>“What about the blessing?” the negotiating Demon asked with
confusion.</p>
<p>“Five hundred to be freed. Two thousand for a blessing. No
discounts,” Han Sen said simply.</p>
<p>“That… That’s too expensive! We cannot bring you that many
xenogeneic genes…” the Demon said with hesitation.</p>
<p>“When I said two thousand, I was giving you a fifty percent
discount. In the future, it won’t be this cheap,” Han Sen
warned.</p>
<p>The Demon King, when he heard Han Sen, understood that the price
wouldn’t go lower.</p>
<p>“I don’t need a blessing. Just let me leave!” Ji Yang Sheng
quickly said. He didn’t think Han Sen’s blessing was going to make
him deified, anyway. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes was
practically daylight robbery.</p>
<p>The negotiating Demons spoke for a while more, and they
eventually forked over five hundred King class xenogeneic genes for
Ji Yang Sheng’s freedom.</p>
<p>“You don’t want me to bless you? Two thousand is a small sum. If
you miss this chance now, it won’t be any cheaper for you later
on.” Han Sen smiled at Ji Yang Sheng.</p>
<p>“No one is going to pay you two thousand King class xenogeneic
genes for your blessings,” Ji Yang Sheng spat. Then he turned
around to leave. He didn’t want to see Han Sen ever again.</p>
<p>Han Sen leered at the pile of King class xenogeneic genes that
the Demons had just given him. He thought this was a fine business
venture. If he couldn’t get any more King class xenogeneic genes
for blessings, he could always bargain with the Extreme King using
Bai Wuchang. If he sold the prince back to the Extreme King, it
would be for a fine ransom.</p>
<p>But he thought the Extreme King wouldn’t be as fast to pay up as
the Demon. The Extreme King were one of the top three races in the
geno universe. They had to maintain their reputation, so there was
a chance they wouldn’t be willing to pay a ransom for the safety of
their people.</p>
<p>There was no one pulling the rickshaw anymore, so Han Sen
returned it to Destiny’s Tower. Its origin was in the Alliance. He
flew forward with Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng could fly atop her sword, while Elysian Moon used
her umbrella to float. It looked very beautiful. Han Sen had to fly
on his own. He had weapons, but he thought it wouldn’t look as cool
if he flew atop a rocket launcher or a sniper rifle. So, he gave up
on that idea and flew on his own.</p>
<p>After flying for half a day without seeing a single core
xenogeneic, he suddenly saw something flying crazily through space
after him. He had a closer look and noticed it was Barr.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I have prepared two thousand King class xenogeneic
genes for you. When can you start blessing me?” Barr shouted,
getting to the point immediately.</p>
<p>“You really want me to bless you?” Han Sen looked at Barr with
shock.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t, why would I come looking for you? When can you
begin?” Barr looked impatient.</p>
<p>“Pay me first, and then I will bless you. When the two thousand
King xenogeneic genes have arrived, I will begin the process.” Han
Sen paused and then went on to say, “But the blessing is just a
blessing. I can’t guarantee that you will become deified. It all
depends on the potential of your genes.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, as long as there is a chance. You wait here, and I
will go get the xenogeneic genes,” Barr said, and then he left the
core area. When he returned, he was lugging a mountain of King
class xenogeneic genes behind him.</p>
<p>Many King class people were watching Han Sen. They froze when
they saw that mountain of King class xenogeneic genes. The news of
Barr delivering two thousand King class xenogeneic genes to Han Sen
in exchange for a blessing spread across the entire universe.</p>
<p>“Is Barr crazy? Two thousand King class xenogeneic genes for Han
Sen’s blessing? Isn’t that a big waste?”</p>
<p>“No way Barr had that many King class xenogeneic genes. This
must have been given to him by the boss of the Destroyed.”</p>
<p>“The Destroyed really want a deified, don’t they? They are
willing to pay so many King class xenogeneic genes for this
ridiculous ceremony?”</p>
<p>Many King class people came close to watch. They wanted to see
how Barr’s blessing turned out. Many people had their filming
equipment at the ready. They streamed the images back to their
people.</p>
