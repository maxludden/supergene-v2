<h2>Familiar Presence</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2548</h3>

<p>The armored man vanished from Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon’s
vision. Then, he reappeared in front of Han Sen. His striking fist
approached Han Sen’s belly. Just as the armored man’s fist was
about to hit Han Sen, Han Sen’s body suddenly disappeared. He
reappeared elsewhere. His fast escape was a product of the
teleportation abilities he had been practicing.</p>
<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, the armored man threw another
punch. And with it, his body vanished just like last time. He
appeared in front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body blinked away again to avoid the incoming fist of
the armored man.</p>
<p>The two of them kept flashing across the expanse of space,
moving too fast for ordinary eyesight to follow. It was like they
could be in the sky at one point and on the ground in the next.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon moved to help Han Sen, but he told
them, “Stay back… you guys cannot evade his attacks. Use your power
to protect yourselves, and don’t leave any of your weaknesses
exposed.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing him, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon stopped in their
tracks. They watched Han Sen and the man in black armor do battle.
Elysian Moon opened the paper umbrella in her hands. A swordlight
flashed from the surface of the umbrella, then expanded to envelop
the two of them. Just as Han Sen wanted, it left no weaknesses
exposed.</p>
<p>“That man in armor isn’t using teleportation abilities,” Gu
Qingcheng said with certainty, as she observed the battlefield
ahead of her.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon nodded seriously. “It isn’t teleportation. It’s
more like… It’s more like…”</p>
<p>“Godslayer Luo.” Gu Qingcheng finished what Elysian Moon was
hesitant to say.</p>
<p>That old man was a lone warrior who had once obtained a foothold
in the sanctuaries for humanity.</p>
<p>When his power reached the max, the presence he gave off was
just like the one they felt from the armored man. He ignored the
rules of space to kill his enemies.</p>
<p>“Why does the armored man have Falsified Sky powers? No, wait…
that is Sky Demon power. The armored man is a Demon?” Gu Qingcheng
wondered aloud.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the armored man was using Sky Demon powers. He
clearly wasn’t using a space-based teleportation talent. Not many
powers could repel Sky Demon powers, but thankfully, Han Sen’s
Dongxuan Sutra was one of the few that could.</p>
<p>The armored man’s absolute strikes weren’t difficult for Han Sen
to break, but the armored man’s power was undeniably greater than
Han Sen’s. And that meant Han Sen couldn’t defeat him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a mixture of different emotions when he looked at
the armored man. He knew this attacker was different from the
Demons they had encountered earlier, but he wasn’t entirely sure
what the difference was.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng and a few of the Demon elites watched the fight
through a mirror. They appeared to be in shock. Even Ji Yang Sheng
was floored by what he was witnessing.</p>
<p>“He is a very powerful guy. He has dodged every attack that the
Demon Doll has thrown.” Ji Yang Sheng chewed his lip. That was what
he did when he was in thought.</p>
<p>“No wonder Han Sen escaped harm when he was pursued by the
Extreme King. He is very scary. He is dodging the attacks of the
Sky Demon powers somehow. I wonder what power he has been making
use of,” a few Demon elites said, their voices a mixture of
admiration and trepidation.</p>
<p>They knew that the Demon Doll’s Sky Demon power ensured that
every hit was a successful one unless the enemy possessed the same
causal powers. If the enemy didn’t, not even teleportation would
let them escape the Demon Doll’s strikes.</p>
<p>Sky Demon abilities were a causal power. Once the Demon Doll
locked onto Han Sen, even if Han Sen teleported away, he should
still be hit.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s teleportation let him dodge the Demon Doll’s attacks,
though. He was obviously using an advanced version of
teleportation. And as for what other powers Han Sen was employing,
Ji Yang Sheng couldn’t guess. He couldn’t understand what he was
witnessing.</p>
<p>“He might be dodging the Demon Doll’s strikes for now, but his
efforts are futile. He is slower and weaker than the Demon Doll. We
must take him with us today. Our race requires more than just a
blessing. Thousands of our people over the next few decades… No,
millions of our people over the next few centuries will need what
he can provide us,” Ji Yang Sheng declared. In an effort to speed
things up, he put more of his power into the purple horn. The
purple horn’s mysterious symbols glowed with a purple light.</p>
<p>The powers of blessing Han Sen had displayed made other races
take him very seriously. They needed his abilities.</p>
<p>If they could capture Han Sen, they wouldn’t hand him over to
the Extreme King. They would lock him up for themselves and force
him to bless their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>The mysterious symbols on the purple horn lit up further. And
then, the armored man who had been struggling to capture Han Sen
suddenly stopped. His body suddenly enlarged.</p>
<p>The muscles of the mystery man grew, and the black armor began
to swell. It had to morph in order to fit the bulging muscles. It
highlighted their ridiculous size all too well.</p>
<p>A dark purple presence intensified within that armor. It made
the armored man look like a demon from hell. His eyes were purple
like lightning.</p>
<p>“This… this is Shura Change.” Han Sen looked at the armored man
in shock. He whispered the words hoarsely.</p>
<p>He finally knew why the armored man’s presence felt different
from the other Demons. They looked so similar, but Han Sen could
feel that this guy was more like a shura from the Alliance’s
universe. His power, however, was obviously some variant of Sky
Demon power. That was what made him look just like one of the
Demon. It was very difficult to tell the difference, and so Han Sen
hadn’t caught on until now.</p>
<p>Once he used Shura Change, the shura’s presence became heavier.
Now, Han Sen was finally getting a better sense of what was
happening.</p>
<p>“Why is there a shura here? I never brought a shura to the geno
universe. Unless he is one of the shuras that come out of the
coffin in the Shura’s Graveyard… He… Could he be one of the shura
kings?” Han Sen looked at the Demon-like armored man with a
conflicted expression. And as he did, Han Sen kept thinking.</p>
<p>The armored man didn’t stop to think through things like Han Sen
had. After he finished changing, his purple lightning-like eyes
peered at Han Sen. Then, the muscular creature threw a punch toward
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen dodged the attack of the armored man, but when he
teleported away, the armored man appeared in front of him. Purple
flames burst to life around the man’s fist as it slammed into Han
Sen’s stomach.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>When that fist connected, Han Sen’s body shot away like a raging
fireball. He flew into a nearby asteroid. He went through it and
many more, cleaving a line through space.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could stop, the armored man appeared in front of
him and punched him again. Once more, he was sent flying.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Han Sen spat out some blood. He kept falling, and he couldn’t
even teleport away.</p>
