  The Dongxuan Aura kept being broken by the copper hall’s power. Han Sen had to keep trying his best to hear the sounds as all he was hearing were bits and bobs.

“For the sake of Mister Leader, I will admit he is the little master, but we cannot allow a guy that has a God Spirit Blood-Pulse ruin the God Chaos Party.” Bury Path God’s voice kept breaking as he spoke. “If you are this loyal to the little leader, I suppose you are not here to take the gene seed for yourselves. If you are both here for the same thing, then how dare you criticize me!”

Big sky demon laughed and said, “Well said. We are not in a place to judge you, but the gene seeds are not for you to take. Therefore, I can only say sorry.”

Bury Path God coldly hummed. “There are no apologies involved. The God Chaos Party has always focused on those who assert strength and are stronger than their peers. If you have what it takes, then there should be nothing stopping you from killing me. I never expected you two vice presidents would be cooperating with each other in a bid to challenge me. What a good show! This is so rare.”

Before Bury Path God could speak, Ancient Devil said, “I and big sky demon are not friends, but the reason for that is because our personal opinions differ. A difference of opinion is not something that should develop into a personal grudge. While we were at the party, we were friends. Now, the God Chaos Party is practically dead. There is no reason for us not to continue being friends.”

Big sky demon did not actually agree with Ancient Devil. She said, “Ancient Devil, you do not have to sugar-coat all this. You and I were ready and willing to kill each other. On this gene seed matter, we have the same purpose. If we do no kill Bury Path God, neither of us can claim the gene seed. All we can do is co-operate.”

“Hmph. Even if you guys do manage to kill me, you will not be able to claim the gene seed. Do not forget that is what Mister Leader left for the little leader. Do you guys really think Mister Leader would not have a backup plan?” Bury Path God coldly grunted.

“You do not have to occupy your mind about that,” big sky demon said. Her power started to rage. Han Sen heard Bury Path God grunt as the power surged crazily through the copper hall. When his Dongxuan Aura reached the hall, it broke. He was unable to hear anything more.

After hesitating, Han Sen turned his head to look at the pool and gourd vine. He saw that the little white rat had yet to give up. It kept trying to climb the vine gourd but kept failing.

Han Sen thought, “Bury Path God said something about the gene seed. He cannot be referring to this gourd vine, can he?”

Han Sen looked at the gourd vine and believed it was true. Bao’er had come from a gourd. If the God Chaos Party’s old leader really was going to leave her something, it made sense for it to be a gourd vine.

Han Sen thought, “It is a shame that Bao’er is not here. Otherwise, whether it is or not, I could take the gourd vine first. As he was thinking, his heart suddenly jumped. “I wonder if I will ever have the chance to come here again. I should at least try and take it with me. If I am able to, I can at least deliver to Bao’er.”

While Han Sen was in thought, he drifted over to the pool. He witnessed the little white rat almost get killed by the gourd vine. He had actually seen this many times, so Han Sen did not dare be reckless. He went into the water of the pool and swam to the gourd vine.

Han Sen had already made a plan. If the gourd vine’s power was too strong, and he could not withstand the power, he could end up like the small white rat. He could use the power of the pool’s water to repair his body.

As he went in front of the gourd vine, Han Sen put his body into xenogeneic mode. The four geno arts were able to break the world together. His entire body was wrapped up by black armor. Outside of his body, his form was ravaged by white, half-transparent fire. He reached his hand out and carefully grabbed the leaves of the gourd vine.

Seeing Han Sen was going to take the gourd leaf, the small white rat stopped trying to take the gourd vine. It floated in the water and watched. It opened its eyes wide. It did not look away while staring at Han Sen’s hand.

As his fingers were about to touch the gourd and its leaves, Han Sen felt rather conflicted. He made up his mind and grabbed the gourd leaf, ready to sustain a heavy amount of damage.

The scary power attack did not show up. Han Sen was able to grab the leaves of the gourd like they were any ordinary ones. No special kind of power zapped him.

The weirdest thing about this was that the gourd vine, which showed no movement before, was now moving as if it was a living thing. The green vine touched Han Sen’s hand. It then went around his waist. It was like a snake coiling around him, including his arms.

Han Sen did not dare move. He sensed that the gourd vine was not doing this for any harmful purposes. He felt as if he had a bond with it.

“This gourd vine is really related to Bao’er.” Han Sen now knew for sure this was the case. There was an 80% to 90% chance that this was the gene seed the others were talking about.

The small white rat’s disaster was now in front of him. Han Sen could not believe the God Chaos Party Leader would leave something so prestigious behind, yet he was able to pick it up so easily. Han Sen could only think of one simple reason for why he was able to interact with the gourd vine, and that was because of his relationship with Bao’er.

Although Han Sen was not Bao’er’s actual father, Bao’er accepted Han Sen’s blood to be born. When Han Sen built his body in the sanctuaries, he borrowed Bao’er’s power to build it. It was only normal for him to have Bao’er’s presence.

The gourd vine climbed onto Han Sen’s body. It was like a snake surrounding his body. In the end, the little green gourd vine came in front of Han Sen. A small gourd was hanging around in front of his forehead. It swung around his forehead. It was like it was trying to smell him.

Han Sen did not feel any hostility from the gourd vine, but he was still a bit nervous about all of this. After all, he was not Bao’er. Thus, he could not tell whether or not the gourd would approve him.

While Han Sen was feeling conflicted about all this, he saw the small green gourd shine like a lamp. It made the small gourd look like a green lamp.

Han Sen looked at the small gourd, unsure whether or not this was good or bad. Judging from the presence he could sense within the gourd, he thought it was weird. It was a presence that made Han Sen feel strange, yet it was very familiar.

The presence was like the black armor’s power. It was not the same though. It was not as strong as the black crystal armor he knew. This was so soft. It was like a small stream.
