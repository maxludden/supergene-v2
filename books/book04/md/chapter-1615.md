  Almost at the same time, Sha Linjia waved his fist that was wreathed in red flame towards Gu Qingcheng’s sword. Two scary forces collided.

Boom!

When those two powers hit, there was an explosion. It had the same devastation of a nuke, and when everything vanished in the blinding light, Gu Qingcheng and Sha Linjia were left standing in the air. Sha Linjia’s fire had been extinguished, and Gu Qingcheng’s swirling sword powers had also disappeared.

“Powerful sword!” Sha Linjia exclaimed. Some blood leaked from between his lips. A red mark became visible on his forehead, and then his entire body collapsed in two, originating from where that mark had landed. He couldn’t be any more dead.

“How is that possible? Sha Linjia has Father’s Godblood. How did he end up losing?” Tina was in shock.

Qing Ya looked down at Gu Qingcheng’s sword, lost in thought.

Gu Qingcheng had one-hit killed Sha Linjia. She looked back at the super creatures attacking the aura, but it was obvious that she had still been affected. She had been hurt; the color of her face had washed out and blood dribbled from the corner of her lips.

Gu Qingcheng was still able to go forward and cut down one of the advancing super creatures. The power she exuded through her sword was much weaker, though. It looked like the blast had damaged her a lot more than initially expected.

Han Sen could also tell she was pretty injured. He couldn’t wait any longer, and so he donned his Fallen Slaughter and went down to Gu Qingcheng. He helped her over to Little Silver and said, “Good job. I’ll deal with the rest.”

“Little Silver, heal her.” Han Sen then spoke to Little Silver, before drawing his sword and moving toward the super creatures.

Han Sen ran out of the shelter, wielding Split-Blade and Overbearing Shield. He also used his metallic butterfly wings in addition to the Bloodlust Ant King glyph.

A strong power had just been unleashed, and that was Han Sen. He swooped in toward one super creature. The super creatures around noticed and tried moving their geno cores to attack their new aggressor.

Han Sen lifted up his gold Overbearing Shield and bounced back the powers of the striking geno cores. Then he brought Split-Blade down across the neck of the first super creature he came to.

Blood squirted through the air as the beast’s neck was severed.

> “Super Creature Mountain River Beast Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Geno Core Destroyed. the Flesh Is Edible. Claim the Life Geno Essence to Gain Zero to Ten Super Geno Points Randomly.”

Even Han Sen was surprised by how easy it was to kill super creatures now. He knew the super creatures weren’t really berserk, though, and the liquid only imbued them with the equivalent strength for a time.

Han Sen felt calm. With the protection granted by his Overbearing Shield and the visceral might of Split-Blade, he came down on the crowd of super creatures and shura with a barrage of sword skills.

Many people were stronger than Han Sen in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, and his power was no greater than Gu Qingcheng’s or the Red Pony’s. Whenever he faced strong elites, Han Sen could not fight a group like Gu Qingcheng or Red Pony could.

But that didn’t mean Han Sen was afraid of group fights.

The gold pattern of his shield shone and his swordmind was unleashed. Like an ancient demon, Han Sen laid into the shura and super creatures with devastation. Their siege against Han Sen had not worked, and they ended up hurting themselves a lot more.

A powerful formation like that hadn’t stood a chance against Han Sen.

“How is that possible?” Tina opened her eyes wide, unable to believe what was happening.

Sha Linjia who had Godblood was murdered by a human woman. So many super creatures and shura had come to attack Han Sen, but Han Sen was like a tiger amidst a crowd of sheep.

“You underestimate Han Sen. He was called Skysword, and he solo’d Outer Sky Shelter. Sha Linjia was too arrogant. He made a mistake, and the New Community has suffered many losses now, as a result.” Qing Ya looked at Han Sen with surprise.

“It looks like we’ll have to wait until Father is born before we can kill that asshole.” Tina gritted her teeth and did not look happy.

“It does seem that way. Let’s go. Otherwise, we’ll be in danger.” Qing Ya’s hand touched Tina’s shoulder, and they both disappeared with the bird.

“Boss is good! Boss is the best!” Cheap Sheep and Green Cow waved a towel from the tower, like a couple of strange cheerleaders swinging a flag.

The creatures that had not been able to escape were frozen in place by the sight.

“It looks like Old Han has walked further than us. Even with ten years to catch up, it feels as if we have not closed the gap. If anything, he seems even further away.” Lin Feng gave a wry smile to Jing Jiwu.

“He’s practically a monster, at this point.” Jing Jiwu slumped his shoulders.

“It is fortunate we are alive, at least. For as long as I draw breath, I will hold true to the hope that one day, I will do battle with him as an equal,” Lin Feng said with passion as he looked at Han Sen, who was currently unleashing his rage like a demon.

“Me, too. I need to win back the loss I incurred in school.” Jing Jiwu smiled and looked very confident in that notion.

Han Sen killed six super creatures and seven shura, then the rest gave up on their attempt to fight and started to run away.

But Han Sen wasn’t willing to let them go. He chased after them, bringing his kills to eight super creatures and eleven shura. He was able to retrieve another eight Life Geno Essences from that, and one extra super beast soul. He also obtained one super geno core that had not shattered.

“It looks like the New Community is quite generous. I was looking for a place to kill super creatures to get strong, but they delivered all I wanted for free. Now I can max out my super geno points. The super beast soul and super geno core are a nice bonus, too,” Han Sen thought to himself.

People then came out to clean the area. Two bodies of super creatures had been claimed for eating, and they were fed to Little Silver and the other pets, so they could reach super class, as well.

While Han Sen tallied what he had gotten, he heard a strange movement in his Sea of Soul. Little Angel and Golden Growler’s lights were moving, indicating they were ready to emerge.

Those two orbs of light suddenly cracked and began to peel. Gold and white lights came out from the balls like erupting volcanos. The entirety of his Sea of Soul was dyed in the white and gold haze.

Boom!

The two orbs of light broke, and within the light, two familiar yet strange bodies were revealed.
