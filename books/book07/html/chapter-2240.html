<p>“Han Sen, you can still turn back from this,” Ice Blue Knight
King said gravely.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t answer, though. Instead, he kept thinking.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King had no personal vendetta against Han Sen.
Actually, considering their mutual connection with Yisha, Ice Blue
Knight King shouldn’t have been hostile towards him at all. And on
top of that, Bai Wei was supposed to be taking Han Sen to the
Extreme King very soon. There was no reason for Ice Blue Knight
King to attack him now. This was going against the will of the
Extreme King’s ruler, and thus, it could be considered a most
grievous crime.</p>
<p>As he thought about it, Han Sen could only pin it on the stone
tablet that was in his possession. Edward had even used the Ancient
God statuette to try to get his hands on the stone tablet.</p>
<p>“If Ice Blue Knight King knew about the stone tablet, he would
have attacked me already. Why would he have waited until this very
moment? He must have just learned about this, and only Edward knows
that I took the stone tablet. But if that is the case, what would
prompt Edward to suddenly tell Ice Blue Knight King that I have the
stone tablet?” Han Sen thought, racing to figure it out. “Right, it
has to be because Bai Wei now wants to take me away. Edward must
know that there is nothing he can do to stop me. Telling Ice Blue
Knight King would have been his last resort.”</p>
<p>“It looks like this stone tablet is worth more than I thought.
Even Ice Blue Knight King is willing to go against the king’s
decree by trying to keep me here. If they are that desperate to get
me to stay, perhaps the stone tablet only works here. Otherwise,
they could think of a way to get it back once I’m with the Extreme
King. They would have to be incredibly motivated to go against
their own ruler’s commands with such a reckless plan.”</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his head to look at Ice Blue Knight King high in
the sky. He could have already killed Han Sen had he wanted to.
With the man’s power and reputation, he probably could’ve murdered
Han Sen and gotten away with it.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had stayed his hand because of his memory of Yisha.
Maybe he didn’t actually want to hurt Han Sen, and all he wanted
was that tablet.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t want to give up the tablet, so there was a
conflict of interest. If Han Sen handed the tablet over, Ice Blue
Knight King would stop coming after Han Sen. Whatever the case
might be, it didn’t seem as if he’d stop unless he got the tablet,
and he would get it no matter what.</p>
<p>“D*mn it! How did Edward know I took the stone tablet? They
shouldn’t have any way of knowing what the stone tablet does. How
did he find out after I took it?” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>He had been so careful, but Edward still discovered the
theft.</p>
<p>He didn’t have time to think it over, though. If Han Sen wasn’t
willing to let go of the stone tablet, then he had to find a way to
escape.</p>
<p>They were currently in the headquarters of the Ice Blue Knights,
so Han Sen was surrounded by elites on all sides. Ice Blue Knight
King didn’t want to cause a big scene, and he didn’t want to push
Han Sen to the edge. So, he had come for him alone.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, that thing is useless for you. Leave it, and you can
still receive a reward.” Ice Blue Knight King hadn’t actually
attacked yet; he was only using his strength to suppress Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Han Sen used his knifemind and
swordmind to blast away Ice Blue Knight King’s powerful aura. As
soon as he struck back against the aura, the pressure released
him.</p>
<p>His knife and swordmind were half-deified, and so they were just
as good as Ice Blue Knight King’s. But there was such a difference
in physical power between the two that there was no chance of any
real competition between them.</p>
<p>“If you insist on this course, then I will have to take you back
myself.” Upon seeing Han Sen’s knifemind and swordmind, Ice Blue
Knight King’s eyes glowed with admiration.</p>
<p>It was very rare to see a Marquise Extreme King who had refined
their minds to such heights.</p>
<p>A glowing blue light had covered Ice Blue Knight King since he
forced his way into Han Sen’s rooms. It was only a passive effect,
but the longer it ran, the wider the glow became. It looked as if
the air itself was becoming blue. It surrounded Han Sen, and he
felt a chilling energy radiating from it. He felt as if that aura
was going to freeze him.</p>
<p>The cold power would limit Han Sen’s ability to fight back.
Attempting to teleport would be useless inside of that blue light.
Break Space Flash only let Han Sen teleport short distances, so he
couldn’t escape that radius.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bao’er were freezing inside that blue light. The two
looked like a pair of frozen ice cubes floating in the blue.</p>
<p>Inside the base, Edward watched the events unfold with a
satisfied smile. “Ice Blue Knight King isn’t a particularly
talented member of the Extreme King, but he has faith in principles
that others have forgotten. He is the only one who has brought the
Ice Blue geno art up to that level. It’s a basic skill that people
rarely spend any time on.”</p>
<p>“His attempts to rise are useless, though. Even from birth, we
knew that he would never become deified. He will be half-deified no
matter what.” The Ice Blue Knight next to Edward smiled. His gaze
then moved over to Han Sen. “I am curious about this Han Sen,
though. He has an amazing shield treasure, but he also managed to
kill Night River King. That isn’t something he could accomplish
simply by having a good defense.”</p>
<p>“Have you seen the little girl with the Jade Drum? That isn’t an
average Jade Drum. It is a mutant King class Jade Drum, and it has
a sonic attack power. I inspected Night River King’s body. Although
he was killed by being decapitated, his brain had already suffered
tremendous damage. He must not have blocked the Jade Drum’s
attack,” Edward said quietly.</p>
<p>“He is just a Marquise of some small race. He has so many
treasures that you and I want so badly, though.” The Ice Blue
Knight looked at Bao’er’s Jade Drum with greed.</p>
<p>“There’s more to this guy than it seems. We didn’t even know the
exact nature of the relic, but he was able to find it. If not for
him, we would never have noticed that the relic was just a small
stone plate that was fixed to the roof. It has a ridiculous amount
of power.” Edward narrowed his eyes as he looked at Han Sen. “If
possible, I would very much like to avoid making an enemy of him.
But we need that relic.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Han Sen will manage to escape? If we bring him
down here, no one will guess that a mere stone plate is the relic
that we’re looking for. We’ll have a perfect opportunity to grab it
from among his things. Then again, if he escapes, that will present
other opportunities.” The Ice Blue Knight looked at Edward.</p>
<p>“I think Ice Blue Knight King can stop him. But even if Han Sen
pulls another rabbit out of his hat to get past the Knight King, I
will ensure that things go our way.” Edward looked confident. “Ice
Blue Knight King can help us by explaining things to King Bai. We
just need to wait, and we’ll soon have our hands on the item.”</p>
<p>In another part of the base, Mister White and Crime were also
watching what was going on. Mister White frowned, but he remained
speechless. Crime asked with much curiosity, “Mister White, what is
going on? Why is Ice Blue Knight King attacking Han Sen?”</p>
<p>“There’s only one thing on this planet that could make Ice Blue
Knight King disobey orders and attack Han Sen.” Mister White looked
at Han Sen with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“No way; why would he have that?” Crime’s eyes opened wide in
disbelief.</p>
