Han Sen reached out his hand to touch the energy that looked like water. It now made sense that this place was called the Pool of Rebirth, as the energy it possessed was very thick and very much like liquid.

When he touched that energy, he felt as if his body was being overwhelmed by a sudden surge of hormones. All of his cells throbbed, as if they were on the precipice of exploding.

As quickly as he could, Han Sen used The Story of Genes to absorb the liquid energy.

Angela and Andola began absorbing that liquid energy, too. This, however, wasn’t the energy of rebirth. It was just a substance from the Pool of Rebirth that would ready them for the main course.

Earlier, the angel statue’s wings were folded forward in a way that cloaked its body from view. Even the statue’s arms had been hidden.

Now that the wings were open, though, the angel statue was revealed to be holding a stone vase. The energy held within that stone vase was the reason they had come. After a few seconds, the liquid energy flowed out of the vase, spreading as it came.

Pop!

Han Sen refined the liquid energy, and as he did, he heard a bubble pop from inside the vase. Shortly after, something white came out of the vase.

Before Han Sen could see what it was exactly, Angela and Andola began glowing with white light. They turned into big angel-like figures themselves, and they shrouded their own bodies in the plush comfort of their wings.

Han Sen watched for a little while before he got a clear view of the white thing that had come out of the vase.

“Okay,” he thought. “That’s just weird.”

The object was around the size of a hand, and when he looked closer, he saw that it was an egg with angel wings.

It looked rather cute, actually. At first, it flew in circles around the angel statue. Before long, it seemed to notice the power of Angela and Andola, and as a result, it flew towards Angela.

Han Sen knew that thing was the rebirthing power he had come for. Luckily, the Sky Palace leader had told him how to take the power for himself.

The rebirthing power was strange, and it was not something Han Sen could take through force. He needed to attract it towards him with his own lifeforce. Normally, Feathers were the best at attracting and absorbing the rebirthing power. But the Sky Palace leader taught Han Sen a method of doing this himself. Following the instructions he’d been given, he started off by casting The Story of Genes.

“Hm, I wonder if this will actually work?” Han Sen thought to himself.

The method the Sky Palace leader had given him was simple. It was so simple that Han Sen doubted it. It seemed too good to be true.

Han Sen started off by casting The Story of Genes. Then, a godlight appeared and took the shape of a ring. It was like a nice little halo, sculpted to the size of Han Sen’s head. In some ways, it looked like a mirror was perched directly above him.

When Han Sen created that ring, the rebirthing power swerved away from Angela and turned around. It flapped its wings and went towards Han Sen’s ring instead.

Seeing the rebirthing power heading for Han Sen, Fairy Feather and the others remained calm. They knew Han Sen would be tricky to deal with. It was because they knew this that they specifically sought out Angela and Andola to deal with him.

Seeing the rebirthing power flying to Han Sen, Angela and Andola looked at each other. Andola nodded, and then his angel shadow turned gold.

Boom!

Andola took one step forward, with his giant angel shadow appearing gold. He opened his arms and wings. In a gesture that looked like he was welcoming the morning glory of the sky, he radiated thousands of beams of golden light like a holy angel.

Everyone could see that Andola had leveled up to become a Duke. His lifeforce was strong, and he could attract the rebirthing power more strongly.

Yun Changkong, seeing Andola’s gold angel, thought, “Judgment Angel Light. That is a forbidden technique of the Feather. Not many can learn it. I remember there were two brothers that learned this technique a few centuries ago. Are they…”

Yun Changkong looked at Andola and Angela, and his expression turned gloomy. He thought to himself, “If they really are the brothers, then Han Sen is in danger. Even the ring skill the leader has taught him won’t be enough to overcome these two brothers.”

Yun Changkong was now able to effectively guess what scheme had been concocted, and why things were going the way they were.

Andola’s gold angel appeared, and the rebirthing power going into Han Sen stopped. The egg’s wings flapped in confusion as it bobbed back and forth, unsure where it should go.

As this occurred, there was a popping sound. Another winged egg emerged from the vase, and it behaved just like the other one, as well. It was also wondering where it should go.

Han Sen frowned. He was using the ring skill that the Sky Palace leader had taught him, but it didn’t seem to be enough to attract the rebirthing power.

Andola kept strengthening his gold angel light, but he was still engaged in overcoming the allure of Han Sen’s ring. Neither of them could attract the rebirthing power exclusively to themselves.

Fairy Feather and the others were glad that they had called on the brothers Angela and Andola. Ordinary Dukes would have definitely lost to Han Sen. When they saw Andola struggling to win, they realized how powerful the attraction of the ring was to the rebirthing power.

But as dire as things might have seemed for the pair, they weren’t worried, for Angela hadn’t fully entered the contest yet. If the brothers cast their powers at the same time, the power unleashed would surely result in Han Sen losing.

Yun Changkong frowned. The Sky Palace leader’s ring was very strong. Han Sen was only an Earl with The Story of Genes, and yet he could fight against Andola who was a Duke. That meant the ring was very attractive to the rebirthing power. But there was still Angela left to deal with, and that meant the chances of Han Sen actually winning were slim to none.

While Han Sen and Andola fought, many more winged eggs appeared out of the vase and became stuck between the two. In no time, a bunch of rebirthing powers were flying around in indecision.

Angela stepped up beside Andola and touched his head. His own angel shadow turned gold. Angela had absorbed enough liquid energy to become a Duke.

Angela then began to channel his power into Andola. His gold angel light was getting weaker, while Andola’s gold angel light was getting brighter and brighter.

The balance between the gold angel and the ring was broken. The rebirthing power started to flap their little wings and head for the gold angels.
