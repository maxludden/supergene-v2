<p>“Where are the gene races?” Han Sen saw the skinning hide, but
he did not see any of the gene races that were said to be
protecting it.</p>
<p>“If you can see that far, look toward the skinning hide’s grassy
heart person’s face,” Bald Guy said.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked and noticed something weird. He thought the
grassy heart person had a face. When he looked closer, he realized
it wasn’t actually a face. It was a red butterfly that had weird
markings. The butterfly was lying on the grassy person’s face. The
pattern on its back resembled eyes. Its body was like a little
person’s nose.</p>
<p>Mister God One went on to say, “The skinning hide looks weird,
but it is still some kind of grass. The grass heart looks a bit
like a child, but it is not actually a child. It does not have
facial structures like eyes or noses. In fact, what is on the
grassy person’s face is a gene race that is called a blood eye
butterfly. Ordinarily, the blood eye butterfly is marquise class.
That level wouldn’t be too hard to deal with. If there was a boss
blood eye butterfly around, we’d be tussling with a duke-class one.
If there is a blood eye butterfly king, it would be king
class.”</p>
<p>“Even a king-class blood eye butterfly wouldn’t be hard for you
to deal with.” Han Sen did not believe Mister God One was unable to
deal with a king-class gene race.</p>
<p>Mister God One presented a wry smile. “You overestimate me. The
level of the blood eye butterfly is not high, but it can punch
above its weight. If there are similar powers to fight back, even a
god-class gene race might be beaten by it.” “Oh, what power is
that?” Han Sen asked with curiosity. Mister God One looked at Bald
Guy and said, “Brother Xia is a student of Mister Wei. He is better
in that department than me. Let’s allow Brother Xia to explain
things to us.”</p>
<p>Bald Guy was not shy. He said it straight. “The blood eye
butterfly is very weird. Its name contains the word ‘eye,’ but it
does not have any eye powers. It is a toxic element gene race. Its
body can release toxic powers that can make others fall into an
illusion. If it touches your skin or is breathed in by your mouth
or nose, it can make you hallucinate. People tend to die during
those hallucinations. The illusion-creating toxic powder is not
what is most important about this beast. You just need a gene race
that is powerful enough to combine with or use a gene race that can
protect you. Do that, and you will not get infected by the toxic
powder.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Bald Guy went on to say, “The butterfly wings
have patterns like eyes. They have a special ability that enables
them to detect the approach of enemies. If that happens, the
butterfly’s eye patterns release a red light. It might not look
strong, as it looks like a red firefly, but if you see the red
light, even god-class gene races might end up hallucinating.”</p>
<p>“What if you don’t see it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t work, even if you don’t look at it,” Bald Guy
replied. “Did I not say the blood eye butterfly is not an eye gene
race? It is toxic, and the red light is toxic. Even if you close
your eyes and the red light touches you, you will still end up
hallucinating. Against ordinary blood eye butterflies, you will be
fine. if there is a king-class blood eye butterfly, even a
god-class gene race might end up defeated.”</p>
<p>While they were talking, a big snake was going down the
mountain. It was as thick as a barrel. It reached the platform.</p>
<p>Han Sen was seeing what Bald Guy had described. The eye patterns
on the blood eye butterfly’s back flickered. It was like the grass
person was opening and closing their eyes.</p>
<p>The big snake looked very powerful. It opened its mouth, wanting
to eat the skinning hide. Before the snake’s mouth could touch the
skinning hide, it stopped.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched a crazy scene unfold. The big snake went
completely mad. It began eating its own body, using its mouth to
eat its tail. Half of his body was inside itself. It created a
snake ring. It looked very weird.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>A sky full of red butterflies fluttered. It was like a cloud of
blood going into the non-moving big snake. A moment later, the big
snake only had bones left.</p>
<p>With the blood eye butterfly’s power, the leftover bones were
tossed off the mountain. Han Sen looked down the mountain. The
peacock king’s eyes were flickering. They peered through the mist
of the mountain. He saw the bottom of the mountain possess a large
mound of bones. Who knew how many gene races had been eaten and
thrown down there by the blood eye butterfly?</p>
<p>“That is a very powerful blood eye butterfly.” Han Sen had to
compliment it.</p>
<p>Mister God One said, “From what I have seen, in this group of
blood eyes, there is a king. It might be a mutant king class.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Bald Guy asked with shock.</p>
<p>Mister God One presented a wry smile and said, “I am not going
to lie. I have a toxic removal toad gene race at my disposal. This
gene race is only king class, but it is very effective against
toxic gene powers. I thought I could use this gene race to remove
the blood eye butterfly, but who would have known there was a
mutant king-class blood eye butterfly? It almost died there. That
was why I asked for Han Sen’s help.”</p>
<p>“The toxic removal toad gene uses a skill called toxic removal
shield,” Bald Guy said with a nod. “It can break all kinds of toxic
gene skills, but it cannot block the toxins unleashed by a
king-class blood eye butterfly. There might be a mutant butterfly
king.”</p>
<p>Mister God One looked at Han Sen and said, “I heard Brother Han
has a blood ghost spirit that can remove all toxins and
debilitations. We will most surely require Han Sen’s aid.”</p>
<p>“In that case, let me give it a go.” Han Sen put Bao’er aside.
He summoned the blood ghost spirit and combined with it. After he
combined with the gold wing peacock king, his evil-looking body
looked to possess a blood aura. He looked even eviler. He was like
some evil and handsome demon that had emerged from hell.</p>
<p>With the strength of Han Sen’s body, he should have been able to
be immune to the blood eye butterfly. Mister God One and the others
were there with him. He did not want to make himself look too
almighty.</p>
<p>“You guys wait for me here. I will be right back.” After saying
that, Han Sen flapped his wings and flew toward the skinning hide
platform.</p>
<p>In an instant, Han Sen landed on the platform. He saw the blood
eye butterfly atop the skinning hide. The butterfly wing’s eye
patterns shone. It was like many small red lanterns were glowing
with a weird crimson light.</p>
<p>The red lights did nothing to Han Sen. It was not able to invade
the blood air from blood ghost spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a lot of red dust scatter in the air. It had to have
been the toxic powder from the blood eye butterfly that could cause
hallucinations.</p>
<p>To Han Sen, the toxic powder was practically useless. Han Sen
landed on the platform. Suddenly, there was a sky full of
butterflies. Amidst all of those blood eye butterflies, Han Sen saw
one blood eye butterfly that was stranger than the rest.</p>
<p>The blood eye butterflies were the same size. It was unknown if
they were marquise or duke class. Aside from their powers being
different, their appearances were the same.</p>
<p>This blood eye butterfly was different. It was about the same
size as the other blood eye butterflies, but it was purple.</p>
<p>“That should be the mutant blood eye butterfly,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
