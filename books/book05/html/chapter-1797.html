<p>What do you mean?” Han Sen asked, with a frown.</p>

<p>“If you want to live, listen to me and follow my instructions closely. If you want to die, death can come easily. Just take a look at the wound on your arm for assurance,” Yisha said coldly.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked, and he looked at the wound on his arm.</p>

<p>The tear on the Dongxuan Armor was still there. It was difficult to recover in that place, but despite that, his wound had already healed. Han Sen’s healing abilities were remarkable.</p>

<p>He had a xenogeneic body, so he wouldn’t bleed. His healing abilities were better than the average Viscount’s.</p>

<p>After examining his wound, he determined that his arm was in good shape. His wound was going to be fine, and there wouldn’t even be a scar.</p>

<p>But just as Han Sen started to answer her, he felt pain stem from his wound. Somehow, the mostly-healed skin had come undone. In a second, the wound had reopened as if he had just been injured. He almost cried aloud.</p>

<p>Yisha said quietly, “You were hit by my teeth power. If I want to, I can ensure your body never heals, and any recovery you make can be broken. I can do this repeatedly until your entire body breaks. Even if you leave Demon Grave and find a King- class elite for aid, not even they will be able to break my teeth power. Not that you could find someone like that, but it would only take two weeks for me to rip up your whole body.”</p>

<p>Han Sen did not respond, but he could definitely feel that his wound was slowly tearing wider. It was slow, but difficult to control. It felt like there were a number of teeth in the wound, digging into his body. He tried to control it, but he could not stop the skin 什om tearing further and further.</p>

<p>“The only reason it would take me two weeks is because of your ability not to bleed. If you did bleed, you’d be dead within a day.” Yisha looked at Han Sen’s wound.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s bloodless wound was a strange sight for her. Her teeth power could break through flesh and speed up any bleeding process. Even those who incurred the slightest of wounds would bleed profusely, but Han Sen hadn’t bled a drop.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s face didn’t change, and he asked Yisha, “What do you want me to do? If you want me to die, you don’t have to say that”</p>

<p>Yisha sighed and told him emotionlessly, “I need you to do nothing.”</p>

<p>Han Sen understood what she meant. She wanted him to stay where he was, do nothing, and avoid disturbing her.</p>

<p>“If you can stand-still, you won’t disturb my business. We can avoid a feud, and I promise you that when we leave this place, I will remove the teeth powers I have inflicted upon you,” Yisha said.</p>

<p>Han Sen neither agreed nor disagreed, but he did say, “As long as you’re not putting me in danger, I can abide.”</p>

<p>Yisha frowned. She was not happy with Han Sen’s manner of promise.</p>

<p>More and more bubbles were appearing in the water, like a large jacuzzi. The bubbles had lovely acoustics, with their constant popping. But amongst the many bubbles, Han Sen saw a black bag. What it was, he did not know.</p>

<p>“Remember what you have told me. Otherwise, you’ll be wishing you were dead,” Yisha told Han Sen threateningly. She stared at the black thing in the lake, then, ignoring Han Sen.</p>

<p>“What is that?” Han Sen looked at it</p>

<p>Yisha ignored him. She continued staring at the lake, as if he did not exist.</p>

<p>Han Sen, getting ignored, did not speak. He was thinking if there was some manner of nice treasure down below, he’d like to steal it.</p>

<p>He didn’t believe the promise Yisha had made him. Once they left Demon Grave, it was likely she wouldn’t remove the teeth power. It was possible she’d just kill him.</p>

<p>Yisha took whatever was inside the lake seriously. If he could steal whatever it was, even if he could not use it himself, it might work as leverage over Yisha.</p>

<p>Whatever the thing in the water was, it was moving faster. And it produced a large number of waves. But then, suddenly, it burst out of the froth of bubbles.</p>

<p>When Han Sen was finally able to see the item, he was shocked.</p>

<p>Han Sen had expected to see something like a fish or a snake. He wouldn’t even have been surprised if it was a dead body, as anything could happen in that place.</p>

<p>But when Han Sen saw a scabbard come out of the water, he was shocked.</p>

<p>It would make sense if it was a blade, as it could easily be deemed as a treasure of some worth. Or perhaps even a geno armament like the Northern King Glove.</p>

<p>But it was just a scabbard that jumped out of the lake, minus a blade it could house. What use would a plain scabbard be for 3 gcno armgmcnl:”?</p>

<p>The scabbard was black, but it wasn’t a matte color. It was crystalline, like some sort of black diamond.</p>

<p>The scabbard hopped out of the lake like a fish. It’s movement looked almost happy.</p>

<p>“What is this scabbard?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>When Yisha continued ignoring him, Han Sen summoned his last horn arrow. He was going to shoot at the black crystal scabbard.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” Yisha was shocked, and her saw-knife immediately swung toward Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen ducked behind his shield and laughed. “I hate being lonely. If you don’t talk to me, perhaps I will do something weird. Don’t take it out on me, if I happen to ruin your business here.”</p>

<p>Yisha’s teeth were getting itchy. If someone like Han Sen had spoken to her in such a manner outside of Demon Grave, she could have had him killed a million times over with a mere wag of her finger.</p>

<p>Rebate Sword Queen was half a god. Even Kings tended to avoid her. No one had permission to speak to her in such a way.</p>

<p>“When I leave this place, I will kill you.” Yisha was very angry, but there was nothing she could do. If Han Sen wanted to ruin her business and steal the scabbard, there was nothing she could do to stop him.</p>

<p>“What is this scabbard?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“Have you heard about the crystallizers? If you haven’t, then you wouldn’t understand,” Yisha said coldly.</p>
