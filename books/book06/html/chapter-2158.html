<h2>Getting Beast Souls</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2158</h3>

<p>Han Sen slashed the dying Demon Bug King’s wounds. With the cut,
the Demon Bug King moaned, but it didn’t die.</p>
<p>He gathered more power and used Tusk alongside his Ghost Teeth
Knife. He had to strike the bug fourteen times before hearing the
familiar sound he enjoyed oh-so-much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Gold Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen was disappointed by this result. That mutant Gold Demon
Bug King hadn’t given him a beast soul.</p>
<p>“Well, there are still twenty-three more of these motherfuckers
to kill. There’s no need to panic just yet,” Han Sen thought to
himself. He turned back to the white Metal Beast.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast swallowed the mutant Gold Demon Bug King’s
body. And like it had with the lesser variants, it spat out the
mutant Gold Demon Bug King crystal. That crystal was even prettier
than an ordinary King class.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast pushed the mutant King-class and a few of
the King class crystals towards Metal Eater. It seemed like Metal
Beast intended them as a gift.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed about this. He had never encountered
anyone kind enough to gift him such a bounty of worthwhile gifts.
Metal Eater did not seem to be able to digest those King class bug
crystals, though. It tried to bite down on the crystals, but
despite the effort, they did not break.</p>
<p>“If he cannot eat them now, why not let me keep them?” Han Sen
asked with a smile.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast ignored him, though. It merely took the
bug crystals and stored them elsewhere. It wasn’t planning on Han
Sen walking away with them.</p>
<p>Han Sen could do nothing except shake his head in dismay. The
white Metal Beast then walked over to another gold cube. It made
some noises at Han Sen, as if telling him to do his thing and open
that one next.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to do this anyway, so he hastily ran over to the
gold cube and put his deified spectacle back on. With it, he
swiftly unlocked the password of the gold cube and opened it.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>The gold demon bugs swarmed out of the cube again. Just like
before, the white Metal Beast was able to swallow them all. But
this time, it did not spit out the bug crystals. After a while,
though, it did spit out a mutant Gold Demon Bug King. And just like
before, the poor bug was on the precipice of giving up the
ghost.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed it. The strike felt incredibly satisfying.
Killing a King class xenogeneic wasn’t a thing many Marquises could
ever hope to accomplish. And on top of that, this wasn’t just an
ordinary King-class creature; it was a mutant King-class
creature.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very weak right now, in the grand scheme of things.
Ghost Teeth Knife slashed the Demon Bug King’s wounds, and after a
few good swings, he finally slew the thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Gold Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen sighed. Again, there was no beast soul for him. He would
need to open the next cube to get what he sought.</p>
<p>One after another, they went through the cubes. After the
seventh Gold Demon Bug King was slain, Han Sen was delighted to
hear the announcement that informed him of his acquisition of a
beast soul.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Gold Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic
gene found. Obtained Mutant Gold Demon Bug beast soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Filled with excitement, Han Sen hurriedly checked out the Mutant
Gold Demon Bug beast soul he had just managed to snag.</p>
<div class="tables">
<table class="beast">
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mutant King Gold-Demon Bug King</td>
<td>(Bai Sema)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<!-- Mutant Gold Demon Bug King beast soul: Bai Sema-type --></div>
<p>Upon seeing it, Han Sen laughed. “Ha! Ha! I really do get
whatever I want! My luck is back.”</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen couldn’t wait to open the rest of the metal cubes.
The white Metal Beast was having a good time, too, so it merrily
followed along to eat its fill of the bugs that Han Sen was
providing.</p>
<p>The next few Mutant Gold Demon Bug Kings did not provide him
with any more beast souls, but just as he was resigning himself to
the fact that he might not receive another Mutant Gold Demon Bug
King beast soul, the last Mutant Gold Demon Bug King gave him
another.</p>
<p>Han Sen was grinning ear-to-ear. He then went on to open the
green cubes. He released the Green Demon Bugs so that the white
Metal Beast could eat them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Green Demon Bug King. Xenogeneic
gene found. Obtained Mutant Green Demon Bug beast soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Lady luck is head over heels for me, isn’t she?” Han Sen was
ecstatic. He had received a beast soul from the very first Mutant
Green Demon Bug King. That was quite a mood booster.</p>
<div class="tables">
<table class="beast">
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mutant King Green-Demon Bug King</td>
<td>(Bai Sema)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<!-- --></div>
<p>Seeing that the Green Demon Bug King’s beast soul was also a Bai
Sema, he was incredibly joyful.</p>
<p>But then, something changed. Han Sen kept killing the rest of
the creatures that the white Metal Beast left for him, but he
didn’t receive any more beast souls. Every time Han Sen believed he
would get another beast soul, he didn’t. Their progress quickly
devolved into a Mutant Demon Bug King murderfest.</p>
<p>“I am still quite happy to have gotten three mutant King beast
souls. That haul is pretty impressive.” Han Sen didn’t complain
about it too much, as he really was quite pleased to receive the
three he had.</p>
<p>He didn’t complain about it too much, as he really was quite
pleased to receive the three he had.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast scoffed down every demon bug it could, but
it kept spitting out the King class bug crystals for Metal Eater.
He didn’t take them back, either. They were like toys for Metal
Eater.</p>
<p>Han Sen had concluded that the white Metal Beast could access
another dimension. He was only storing the bug crystals, not eating
them himself.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, that did not matter to Han Sen. Having
three Demon Bug King beast souls made him a very happy man
already.</p>
<p>“Let’s see if the Gold Bai Sema and the Green Bai Sema are as
strong as the blue one.” Han Sen summoned the Gold Demon Bug King’s
beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a gold light appear around him. Aside from the color
being different, there did not seem to be anything separating it
from the Blue Demon Bug King’s Bai Sema.</p>
<p>After checking out the Green Bai Sema, he noticed that it was
exactly the same, as well. All that was different was the color.
The defensive properties were identical.</p>
<p>“Can I use these Bai Semas together?” Han Sen thought to
himself. Then, he summoned all of the Demon Bug King Bai Semas.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned all four Demon Bug King Bai Semas, but one of
them did not work.</p>
<p>The three Bai Semas he successfully summoned combined to become
a blue, gold, and green Bai Sema. The one that he couldn’t summon
for use was the second Gold Bai Sema.</p>
<p>“I can’t use the same-color Bai Sema beast souls together, but
those of different colors can be combined.” Han Sen was surprised.
He tried out the tri-color Demon Bug King Bai Sema, and noticed
that it was far stronger than any single color Bai Sema.</p>
<p>This discovery was as surprising as it was exciting. “These Bai
Sema beast souls can be combined. I wonder how many demon bugs the
Breakskies created? If there are more colors, perhaps I can stack
those together too. It might give me the defense of a deified
being.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the chances of that were extremely low, though.
Even if there were other colors out there, he might not be lucky
enough to get their beast souls. In addition to that, finding the
demon bugs would be a task and a half.</p>
<p>The Tri-Color Demon Bug King Bai Sema is strong enough for now.
It will certainly withstand a half-deified elite.” Han Sen felt so
happy.</p>
