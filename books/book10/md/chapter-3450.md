Human King only wanted to stop Littleflower. He really did not plan on using Han Ling’er as a meat shield to block Littleflower’s fist.

Who would have known Littleflower’s fist was not going to stop at all? It hit Han Ling’er’s belly. Han Ling’er’s belly glowed with white light. Littleflower’s body had the shadow of an angel. With that punch, it went right through Han Ling’er’s body.

Pang!

Human King grabbed Han Ling’er’s hand. He was blasted away by huge power, and it made him stumble back a little.

“I forgot to tell you that my Super God Spirit body’s name is called Holy Spirit Protect. Just like my faith, it exists to protect others.” Littleflower pulled back his fist. He looked at Han Ling’er.

Han Ling’er’s spirit body had become a Super God Spirit body. After combining with the holy spirit, she immediately grew up. From a little girl, she became an adult woman. The back of her wings spread gloriously. Her white, long hair was like a waterfall of spirit light that was cascading and imbuing its glow on everything. She looked very holy.

“How dare you bully my big brother, Littleflower! I will kill you for this!” Han Ling’er’s body had become bigger, but her thoughts never changed. She was still the Han Ling’er of the past. Littleflower’s Holy Spirit Protect was only for protection. It would not change the behavior of the person who was being protected. It would only bolster the resolve of their faith and their mind. It did not matter if the person being protected had a mind that was good or bad. They would be protected either way. That was because love could exist regardless of whether or not a person was good or evil.

Human King looked at the very angry Han Ling’er. He wished to say something, but a spirit light flashed. Han Ling’er was already in front of him, and her fist was already put to his jaw.

*Boom!* Human King’s body was like a rocket flying away. He coughed up a lot of blood, and his soul was well shaken. He was going to be a very broken man.

“How is that possible…” Human King shot through space. His pupils minimized as much as they could. He could not believe Han Ling’er was so fast that his own body could not react to her assault.

Human King’s rule powers covered Space Garden, but Han Ling’er’s punch broke it. The people who were previously frozen in space, including those from the God Chaos Party and Space Garden factions, were set free.

After they were set free, they merely stared into space with a petrified look. They saw Han Ling’er, who was like a holy spirit, move to madly beat up Human King.

Because Han Ling’er was so young, she had never practiced with geno arts before. Usually, the best she would do was learn a few leg and fist fighting skills. Now, as Han Ling’er went crazy, she was mainly using her fists and her legs to pummel her foe.

Her skills were basic. They could not be any more basic. She would unleash a straight punch, a hook punch, and a side punch-the most basic of basic. Her leg skills were so basic that a three-year-old could learn them.

But that kind of simple punching and leg skills were beating up Human King in space, strike after strike, all without reprieve.

Human King’s head and body were being punched by Han Ling’er’s fists and leg. Human King was like a Matryoshka doll swinging around in space. His pretty face was beaten and gnarled to the point he looked like a pig. His eyes, nose, and mouth were all oozing blood.

Katcha!

The black crystal armor, which was already burned, had a big chunk fall off due to the sheer force of Han Ling’er’s punch.

Everyone was shocked. This was Human King they were witnessing. He was an invincible existence that commanded the 33 skies. It only took one of his punches to destroy the world. He was the type of existence that could make the Geno Hall Leader not want to tango with him.

No one could believe Human King was being brutally pummeled by Han Ling’er in such a fashion.

“This… This is our new leader…” Itchy was looking at Human King being beat like so, but he failed to believe his eyes.

“Oh my God! Is that really Little Ling’er?” Tang Zhenliu was so shocked that he screamed.

“What Little Ling’er? That is my Goddess, OK?” Space Garden was very happy about this development. Human King was very shocked and angry about what was happening. He tried to use many different geno arts. It did not matter if it was a time and space geno art because, before Han Ling’er, no type of geno art seemed to work. The pure and holy power she wielded seemed to erase everything in its path.

To say it straight, she was simply violent. Her pure power crushed everything. Even Reboot-class geno arts were pointless before someone like Han Ling’er.

Human King had put half a step forward to reach Universe class. He had some universal power, but it was still being beaten by Han Ling’er’s fists and legs. It was like it was not the most powerful universe power after all. And all he had been using was just glass.

The power unleashed shocked his soul. If it was not for his soul being powerful, the souls of ordinary creatures would break after one measly punch. “Impossible… Impossible…” Human King could not accept the result.

He had been brooding for more than a few years. He had put a lot of effort into cultivating a pure Blood-Pulse for every generation so that his body could be purified. He had managed to eliminate every bad crystallizer gene in his body. All he had left was World King God’s and Qin Xiu’s powerful genes. He was supposed to have become the most powerful existence in all the world.

Now, he had rudely found out the two mixed kids, whom he believed had bad genes, could co-operate to release a power that well and truly shocked him. He could not accept any of this.

That failure was harder to accept than being beaten. The mixed kids he thought had bad genes were frighteningly strong. All of his years of practice had been rendered pointless. It was all for nothing. All of his sacrifices for Blood Legion had been in vain.

“No… My path is the correct one… My genes are the strongest ones… I just need to take that step… If I walk that step, I will be stronger than her…” Human King’s eyes looked purple. He was holding his body, which was being beaten by Han Ling’er. He changed positions.

Han Ling’er’s body was very strong, but she was only just a child. Her mind was not like Human King.

Human King’s chest received a punch. It sounded as if something had broken. A bloody hole manifested inside his chest. His strong body could not withstand Han Ling’er’s fist.

The chest and heart inside were exposed. It was all bloody. When Han Ling’er saw it, she was given a shock. She was just a child, and she had never hurt anyone else before.

At that moment, Human King’s body vanished.

“Oh, no!” Littleflower reacted first. He raced to Ji Yanran, but his holy spirit body had been combined with Han Ling’er. It was too late for him to go back. He was weak. Before he could even reach Ji Yanran, Human King was behind Ji Yanran. He grabbed Ji Yanran’s neck while the other hand punched Littleflower away. “Asshole! Let go of my mother!” Han Ling’er was furious. She flashed before Human King with a desire to destroy his face.

Human King lifted Ji Yanran. He blocked before Han Ling’er could pull her fist back. Human King swung another hand, making a grey and black universe power blow up Han Ling’er. It blasted Han Ling’er’s body away.

“Obscene! You are shameless…” Tang Zhenliu and all the others were shocked and angry.

Even the many scary creatures of God Chaos Party looked poorly on this. They had done this before, but he was the God Chaos Party Leader. To see him do this in front of everyone else in the world looked ugly.
