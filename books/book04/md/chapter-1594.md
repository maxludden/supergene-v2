“Lin Feng?” Han Sen asked when he heard the man’s voice. With much glee, he ran over to him.

Encountering friends in such a place was always a very happy occurrence.

“Why are you here?” They asked at the same time, prompting them both to laugh in unison.

Lin Feng shook the sand and dust out of his hair and patted himself down. With a smile, he said, “Jing Jiwu and I have been on a streak of good luck. We were able to meet each other and level up out here. We have been here for a few years, so you might consider us natives of the place.”

“That’s fantastic. With you guys here, we can hunt creatures with greater ease.” Han Sen was looking excited.

Han Sen had no doubt concerning the breadth of Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu’s potential power. Some people were simply good, no matter where they went. Jing Jiwu and Lin Feng were such people. They were the best of the best.

“We can take you there, but first, we will have to wait for the sandstorm to pass. The sandstorm has gotten too strong. Heading into it now will surely hurry our demise.” Lin Feng smiled.

“Old Lin, are there any solo super creatures out there to your knowledge?” Han Sen asked, after sitting down near the fire Lin Feng prepared for them. He had also been offered food and drink.

Lin Feng nodded. “There are quite a few. Jiwu and I have been observing them for a while, and I believe there are a few we can kill. When the sandstorm ends, we can call on Jiwu.”

Han Sen shook his head. “Whatever target you have in mind is yours. I will go for ones I find myself.”

Lin Feng smiled and said, “We have only seen them. We don’t yet have the experience to hunt them, so the ones we have in mind can’t really be called targets. Hunting with you, however, would let us gain experience and what-not. That is good enough. But this sandstorm will have us trapped inside here for a few days, I am afraid.”

The sandstorm was fierce. The noise outside was like howling thunder, but the soothing vocals still echoed softly under it all. It was a song that could most certainly hypnotize a person into a deep sleep.

As Han Sen was talked with Lin Feng, he did not realize that Bao’er had been enticed by the acoustics. So, she crawled out of the cave.

Han Sen was shocked when he noticed. He ran towards the entrance, and uncaring for the sandstorm, he ran out into it. He called out Bao’er’s name, wanting her to come back.

As soon as he exited the cave’s mouth, though, a lot of black and yellow sand came his way. He couldn’t see Bao’er, or even his own hands.

The severity of it all prompted Han Sen to return. Lin Feng and Xu Mi ran towards him. The former said, “You shouldn’t go out there. The sandstorm is far too powerful. I once saw a giant snake flee into it. When the dust settled, only its bones remained.”

Once Lin Feng said that, Han Sen’s worry about Bao’er increased.

Bao’er was strong, but Han Sen still considered her his child. Just like any parent, it did not matter how well their child grew up, they still harbored a strong yearning to keep them protected.

“Wait for me here. I’ll be back,” Han Sen said, then ran back out of the cave again. This time, he summoned the Bulwark Umbrella as he went.

Lady Chef wished to stop Han Sen, but she couldn’t. Han Sen was too quick.

When he opened the umbrella, though, the sand outside was parted. The sand could no longer harm Han Sen, but still, he was unable to see much. The storm was like a dragon in the sky, circling him.

“Bao’er!” Han Sen used the umbrella while calling out for Bao’er. Unfortunately, his voice was silenced in the midst of that storm, even if he used his sonic powers.

Han Sen frowned. He suddenly saw something flash inside the sandstorm. Eventually, Bao’er came racing into the shelter provided by the Bulwark Umbrella.

“Bao’er, why did you go running off like that? It’s dangerous out here!” Han Sen picked her up. He was happy he had found her, but he maintained a stern tone to tell her off.

“Dad, take a look at this. It’s beautiful!” Bao’er raised her chubby hand. She was holding onto something Han Sen had never seen before.

It was a ring made of gold. The stone at its center was jade, around the same size as a pigeon’s egg.

Seeing its style and the quality of its production, Han Sen deduced it was the craftwork of a human. Beings in the sanctuary would not put in the time or effort to create something that was pretty much just a luxury and nothing more.

“Bao’er, where did you get this from? Did someone die out here?” Han Sen asked her as he took the ring.

“I got it over there, but it’s just a ring.” Bao’er pointed in a particular direction, but nothing was visible due to the storm.

Han Sen was unable to see what she was pointing towards, but he couldn’t see the entrance of the cave behind him, either.

“Forget it, let’s go back. If someone did die out there, there’s nothing we can do about it now.” Han Sen held Bao’er and returned to the cave.

Han Sen remembered the direction to go back and he wasn’t led astray. He managed to get back to the cave without harm.

When Lin Feng saw Han Sen return, he and the rest all felt relief. Too many creatures had died in this sort of sandstorm.

This was Xu Mi’s first time there, but Lin Feng had occupied this area for a few years. He knew how dangerous this region could be, and he was very surprised to see Han Sen make it back.

“Lin Feng, do you recognize this?” Han Sen threw him the ring Bao’er had found.

Lin Feng had been there for a few years, so he should have known the other humans in the area. Perhaps he could put a name to the person the ring may have once belonged to.

Lin Feng examined the ring, but as soon as he did, his face changed. He stood up, staring at the ring. “Where did you get this?”

“I got it out in the desert. Do you know who it belongs to?” Han Sen could sense something was amiss.

“This is Jiwu’s ring. His first girlfriend gave it to him, back when he was in school. He always wore it, and he would never take it off, let alone leave it behind someplace.” Lin Feng stared out into the sandstorm before clenching his jaw.

“He came out here with you? Why is he not here with us now?” Han Sen’s heart jumped.

“He didn’t come with me. He should be in the shelter. Why would his ring be out here?” Lin Feng looked so shocked, and he kept his gaze fixed on the sandstorm.

Before Han Sen said anything more, though, Lin Feng rushed right out into the sandstorm, ring in hand.

As this was happening, the song that tainted the wind changed. The voice that had no words suddenly said something summoning-like.

“Han Sen… Han Sen…”
