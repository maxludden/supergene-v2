Everyone’s focus was on Han Sen. They knew watching Jade Shura was pointless. Falsified-Sky power was invisible anyway, and if they watched her, they wouldn’t see how the attack killed him.

“Is Dollar playing around? This is Falsified-Sky power he’s up against!” Tang Zhenliu’s hands were getting sweaty. He wasn’t related to the Luo family, and it was a shura using that power. He earnestly hoped Dollar would win. Nobody replied to him, because they didn’t know the answer, either. Everyone was intensely focused on Dollar.

Just as most people were expecting Dollar to start spewing blood, he moved half a step. He did it casually.

But after that step, everyone froze.

After that step, nothing happened. And the fact that nothing happened was what struck people with disbelief.

Falsified-Sky power had been cast, but nothing became of it. It was strange, and everyone turned to look at Han Sen with surprise; even Jade Shura. No one could believe that the Falsified-Sky powers had missed Dollar completely.

“Did he dodge the Falsified-Sky power?” Luo Li’s eyes opened wide. She had seen all that transpired, but she still couldn’t make sense of it

Luo Haitang looked just as surprised. But he only looked at Dollar without saying a word, retreating into thought.

Jade Shura was wearing a mask, so nobody could see her face. But Jade Shura knew her own face was full of shock. She couldn’t accept what had just happened, and she didn’t believe her Falsified-Sky power could be avoided.

Because Jade Shura only had half of the Falsified-Sky Sutra, it was not impossible to dodge. But hers was different. Her Falsified-Sky power was almost perfect due to her blood. In recent years, no one had been able to dodge her ability.

Jade Shura’s eyes looked cold. She didn’t say anything and simply cast it again. She swung both hands and kept repeatedly slashing towards Dollar.

Han Sen remained still and firm, only moving to casually dodge the strikes. And still, Jade Shura’s Falsified-Sky Sutra did not hit Han Sen, and he managed to dodge each and every attack.

Jade Shura’s Falsified-Sky powers were almost perfect. Even if she had a variant that was absolutely perfect, Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra would allow him to dodge it. He wouldn’t be struck by it.

“Is it fake, perhaps? It must be a fake Falsified-Sky power.”

“Shit! Dollar is too strong. Falsified-Sky power is useless against him.”

“I must be seeing a fake Falsified-Sky power.”

“Dollar is scary. Not only did the sealing power not work against him, but neither has Falsified-Sky powers. What power can work against him?”

Dollar will surely get into the top ten Son of Gods.

None of the beings had expected this. Godslayer Luo killed everything with his Falsified-Sky power, and he had even taken down a super shelter with it, so humans could have a place to call home in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. Spirits and creatures knew how powerful it could be.

Even top rank spirits and creatures would not underestimate Falsified-Sky powers. And yet, Dollar had effortlessly evaded it. It made them wonder if the ability they were witnessing was fake.

“The Falsified-Sky power is not fake; it’s just that Dollar is so strong! He broke Six Paths and is immune to sealing powers. Not even Falsified-Sky powers can hurt him. Where did he come from, wielding such power? I have never heard of such a thing before.” Sacred’s leader frowned while looking at Han Sen.

“Haha, see! This is a strong human.”

“Falsified-Sky powers are nothing. Dollar is God. In front of God, everything is rubbish.”

Many human demigods were fans of Dollar, but now they were even more hyped. They all wished they could be like Dollar, making battle with enemies of the different species in Divinity’s Bout and achieving a more widespread human glory.

Spirits and creatures did not believe Dollar was human.

“It’s not an elite human, it is a creature.”

“It’s not a creature, it is a spirit.”

The audience argued amongst themselves. Inside the arena, Yu Ming’er was still reeling in shock. The power she was most proud of had proven useless against her opponent.

No matter how hard she tried, the Falsified-Sky powers had lost their luster.

Han Sen’s moving body started to look bigger and bigger in her eyes. Her opponent looked so mysterious, and it knocked her confidence down more than a few pegs.

Han Sen now fully understood how proficient she really was with Falsified-Sky powers. Her ability was far from being perfect, and it was much worse than even Zero.

If Han Yan became super class, she’d be better than Jade Shura, as well.

“That Jade Shura is a potential threat. Even half of the Falsified-Sky Sutra is extremely dangerous. I should kill her to avoid further problems.” Han Sen’s expression turned murderous, and he suddenly started sprinting towards her.

Yu Ming’er’s confidence had been trampled, and her attacking momentum was now low, but she was still able to dodge the punch Han Sen threw. But Han Sen turned and revealed his Blow Blood geno core, then he blew it at her. A red light came flying at her face.

Yu Ming’er had the best blood out of all the Jade Shura. In a situation like this, she could still remain calm and evade the attack. But she was unable to dodge it completely. The red light went right for her face and broke a part of her mask off.

Han Sen teleported in front of her with his fist raised to punch her in the face, but when he saw her image, he stopped. He didn’t want to punch her.

“Why do you look so familiar?” Han Sen was in shock. Yu Ming’er looked just like Zero. If she hadn’t looked older than Zero, he would have believed that Zero herself was standing before him.

“Kill me, if that is your desire.” Yu Ming’er stood where she was, seeing the fist in front of her. She gritted her teeth in anticipation.

“Tell me; what is your name? And from which shura tribe do you hail?” Han Sen asked her.

Han Sen wanted to find out more about Zero, and although he’d never given up, there hadn’t been clues for the longest time. Now that he had seen Yu Ming’er, he was taken aback.

Until he could figure out the connection between the two, Han Sen was going to spare her life.

Yu Ming’er did not say anything. A door of light appeared behind her, and she ran towards it. In anger, she turned and said, “Dollar, right? I’ll remember you. I won’t lose next time.”

Han Sen watched Yu Ming’er concede and did not move to stop her. He had decided not to kill her, so stopping her would be unnecessary. And even though she had said nothing about the fact, Han Sen at least knew she was of the Jade Shura. She couldn’t run from him.
