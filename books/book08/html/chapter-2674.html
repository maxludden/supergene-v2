<h3>Chapter 2674</h3>

<p>“It looks like Han Sen is stronger than I thought. Even if I was
half-deified, I don’t think I would be able to suppress him with my
current power,” Shale said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked down on the bloodied-but-not-yet dead Gru. He was
going to finish him with a final shot. He wasn’t on good terms with
the Extreme King, and someone like Gru would definitely be used
against him. It would only lead to trouble further down the line.
He knew he would need to finish the man off then and there.</p>
<p>But before Han Sen could do anything, a shadow appeared next to
the heavily wounded Gru. The man looked at Han Sen, grabbed Gru,
and disappeared, teleporting away from the battlefield.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t need to guess. He knew that the Very High who had
taken Gru away was the same man who had signed a contract with
him.</p>
<p>“What a shame,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Han Sen really is a legendary dude. The power of one bullet was
enough to harm Gru like so. To be honest, it should make us feel
embarrassed,” said an approaching figure.</p>
<p>When Han Sen turned around, though, he saw more than one person.
There were three people following the speaker.</p>
<p>“What do you guys want?” Han Sen asked, looking at the four
people. He had seen them in the information booklet he had been
given. The leader of the crew was from the Extreme King. Of the
remaining three, one was Extreme King, and the other two belonged
to other races. If they had been taken on as silkworms, though,
then it was obvious they weren’t foes that Han Sen could take
lightly.</p>
<p>“You are strong, but we want to get a good ranking. So, we will
have to ask you to leave the valley,” the leading Extreme King man
said.</p>
<p>After that, the four silkworms surrounded Han Sen.</p>
<p>Although the Very High never suggested that silkworms should
team up, cooperative fights weren’t forbidden, and there were no
rules stating that silkworms should fight one on one. If things had
to be one-on-one at all times, there would have been no reason to
stick all twelve silkworms in a single valley.</p>
<p>The Very High didn’t only want to learn from the fighting
experience of their silkworms. They wanted to learn what would
happen to the mind during heated exchanges, so they could determine
which effects were useful and which were not. It would help the
Very High determine how to conduct themselves in the future.</p>
<p>“Are you going to leave with your head held high, or are we
going to have to send you home in a body bag?” a mantis-man asked
Han Sen snidely.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “You think you can bully me because
you outnumber me?”</p>
<p>“Han Sen, are you naive enough to believe we will fight you
one-on-one?” the mantis-man said with a disdainful look on his
face.</p>
<p>He and Han Sen were both from small races. Despite that
commonality, Han Sen was a famous fellow all across the universe.
Even amongst the Very High, he was considered a figure of much
prestige.</p>
<p>The mantis-man’s background was similar to Han Sen’s, but he had
never spent time in the limelight. That lack of fame led to him
hating Han Sen quite a lot.</p>
<p>“It isn’t like that. I’m just giving you a little advice. If you
want to bully me, four of you won’t be enough. You should go and
enlist a few others before you push your luck,” Han Sen said
quietly.</p>
<p>“What idiocy. Come on, then. Show us! Show us how good you
believe you are,” the mantis-man grunted coldly, as a purple and
red mantis arm suddenly broke through the fabric of space. It
slashed forward, hurtling down on Han Sen.</p>
<p>The mantis-man had space power. Wherever the mantis-man’s arm
went, a long mark was left in its wake.</p>
<p>Han Sen fell back, but he felt as if the space his body occupied
had become distorted. Although he had moved nearly a thousand
meters, the mantis-man was no farther away from him.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He looked to the side, and he saw an Extreme
King person unleashing a weird area power. He thought it must have
been the area power that was distorting the dimensions around
him.</p>
<p>As the mantis-arm came down, Han Sen used Spell’s two pistols to
take aim at the mantis scythe.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>It shouldn’t have been difficult to counter the mantis’ arm with
Han Sen’s power, but when they struck each other, Han Sen felt a
surprising amount of power coming against him. He stumbled back a
few steps, and his hands ached. He almost lost the tight grip he
was keeping on those two pistols.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes flicked back to the mantis. A weird, gold light
was covering the mantis arm. That gold light was shining on all
four half-deified, actually. One of the Extreme King was glowing
especially brightly. That was undoubtedly his area power.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could react, there was an arrow headed toward
him. It was a half-deified from the Aichi. The Aichi were born
archers, so their talents with a bow were exemplary.</p>
<p>Han Sen was fighting four people alone, which put him at a
considerable disadvantage. The four half-deified fighters were all
using their special powers in conjunction.</p>
<p>The mantis-man had a rare space power that could break space
with a scythe that was practically indestructible. One of the
Extreme King fighters could manipulate space, whereas the other
could buff the bodies of his companions. They restricted Han Sen’s
movements while also making their bodies stronger.</p>
<p>The Aichi archer was the icing on the cake. He had a scary
proficiency with the bow. He kept harassing Han Sen from afar, and
his area could buff the speed of the other three.</p>
<p>Because space was sometimes shortened or lengthened, the
distance Han Sen kept between himself and his enemies was no longer
reliable. The attacks that he could evade were now no longer
avoidable. The distances at which he could attack the enemy were
made longer, keeping him from touching them.</p>
<p>“Although Han Sen is strong, the other silkworms are very
strong, too. He is fighting four people all alone. Even I, a Very
High, cannot do that. He is just one Han Sen,” Liyu Zhen coldly
said.</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite weren’t too worried because they could
sense Han Sen’s heart. Although it seemed that Han Sen was being
oppressed and restrained at every turn, they could feel that Han
Sen’s heart was like a quiet well. There was a lot of confidence
inside him.</p>
<p>Although they hadn’t yet figured out where Han Sen’s coincidence
came from, they knew Han Sen’s situation wasn’t as dire as it
seemed.</p>
<p>An arrow was flying right toward Han Sen’s face, and a sword
light was coming at Han Sen’s waist. The mantis arm and Spell’s
pistol collided, sending Han Sen back a few hundred meters. Every
second of the engagement put Han Sen in a new life-and-death
situation. It seemed that if the mantis-man and the others worked
just a little harder, they could defeat Han Sen.</p>
<p>The battle raged furiously. Han Sen was attacked by many areas,
knife lights, and sword shadows, and despite it all, he kept
blocking everything that was thrown at him. He was countering the
attacks of four people.</p>
<p>In the beginning, those Han Sen’s four attackers had the
advantage, but as time passed, they realized with shock that their
restraints on Han Sen were becoming weaker and weaker. They could
no longer keep him contained within their areas.</p>
<p>In the end, Han Sen was easily engaging all four of them at the
same time. He was able to attack and defend as he pleased.</p>
<p>“This guy’s battle talents are too scary,” the Fox woman said.
She was watching Han Sen fight, stunned. Each of the four silkworms
was just as strong as she was, but Han Sen could fight all four of
them with stability. And he was only a ninth-tier King.</p>
