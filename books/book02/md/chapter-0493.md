  Han Sen won every fight he was in for a dozen times. Because many fans were trying to match with him, the better half of his opponents were his fans, among whom a girl even asked for his signature, blushing.

"This is a virtual platform. There is no way I am able do that." Han Sen had to log out of the official platform. If he kept going like this, it would not help him at all.

The news about Dollar appearing again was spread very fast. Many people were debating whether Kill Dollar was really Dollar himself. And more people were waiting for Dollar on the official platform.

Han Sen did not use the platform again. People were checking to see whether he was online twenty-four seven. There was no way to fight normally. Currently, what he needed was tough fight instead of fanfare.

Lying on the bed and resting, Han Sen decided to use the military virtual camp the next day instead of the official platform.

He could not fall asleep right away, so he dialed Ji Yanran's number. After a while, Ji Yanran picked up.

"Are you still busy with work so late?" Han Sen asked.

"No, I was on the official platform," said Ji Yanran excitedly. "Dollar appeared again with 40+ wings and no loss. So impressive! I was just watching him fighting, so good…"

"You also went to see Dollar? Are you his fan as well?" Han Sen was dazed, not knowing Ji Yanran was so interested in Dollar.

"Yes, I am his fan. Who wouldn't like such a hero? He used to save those kids and fight the golden-horned Shura, so manly…" Ji Yanran's face was filled with worship. There were almost hearts in her eyes.

"Hey, your boyfriend is still here. This is inappropriate," Han Sen curled his lips and said.

"Ha, why are you jealous? Idol is different from boyfriend. I only need to worship my idol from afar. If I got too close to him, I would definitely be disappointed. However, my boyfriend is my dearest person in the world, for whom I would give up everything," she said with a smile.

"I'm not that happy to hear this. Can't you worship your boyfriend? Your boyfriend is also awesome," Han Sen said reluctantly.

"That is different. In my mind, you are the best. However, Dollar is a national hero. I just can't compare the two of you," Ji Yanran said.

"Then I'll let you watch your national hero. I, this ordinary good guy, will go to sleep." Han Sen pretended to be hanging up.

"My dear, don't be like this. If you don't like it, I will not watch him anymore. What D-God? He's definitely a loser compared to my genius. A hundred Dollars can't even compare to your big toe. Forgive me my genius!" Ji Yanran said flirtatiously.

Tempted by her looks, Han Sen was enamored. He was not really mad anyways. He was not so bored that he would be jealous of himself.

Lying on the bed and chatting with his girlfriend, Han Sen gradually fell asleep after a long time. When he woke up, the comlink was still on. Ji Yanran was the same way, falling asleep during the call, and she was not up yet.

Not wanting to bother her, Han Sen turned his comlink off. After brushing his teeth, he went to eat something and got ready for his virtual camp fight. However, his comlink suddenly started to ring.

Han Sen thought it was Ji Yanran and answered it casually. However, in the holographic image that popped out Huangfu Pingqing appeared.

"Huangfu Pingqing, how come you have the time today?" Han Sen said casually. They were quite familiar with each other, so he did not bother to go through the greetings.

"Do you know that Dollar has appeared again?" Huangfu Pingqing said directly.

"I believe every evolver knows that," Han Sen said helplessly, spreading his hands.

He did not expect the attention he attracted by using an ID name related to Dollar.

"You really think that person is Dollar?" Huangfu Pingqing said.

"I think so," replied Han Sen.

"Why?" Huangfu Pingqing asked, puzzled.

"Instinct," Han Sen said casually, thinking, that person is me, so of course I know.

Huangfu Pingqing thought about it and said, "I also feel it is probably true. However, Dollar is making such a huge progress. I wonder which shelter he's at."

"If you don't know, I would know even less. Right, why do you look for him? Does Son of Heaven still want to go after him?" Han Sen asked, pretending to be casual.

"Although my cousin hates Dollar, he is not so bored. The reason I want to look for him is because the footwork he was using in the fights looked like Heavenly Go." Huangfu Pingqing said grimly.

"Even if he is using Heavenly Go, what does that have to do with you?" Han Sen asked, puzzled.

"Currently, in the Alliance there should be only two persons who practice Heavenly Go. One is my grandmother, and the other is the student of my grandmother. Even I did not manage to learn Heavenly Go. If he was really using that, Ares Martial Hall must investigate into that."

Hearing Huangfu Pingqing out, Han Sen felt puzzled. And then he looked at her and asked, "Is the student of your grandmother that Queen from Queen restaurant?"

"How do you know that?" Huangfu Pingqing looked at Han Sen, surprised, her breasts moving up and down dramatically.

Huangfu Pingqing's are the best. Although that girl has huge breasts, their shape was not as perky and perfect as Huangfu Pingqing's. Han Sen couldn't help thinking.

"I've met Queen on Gladiator before and learned some kiting skills from her. It helped me a lot, but I don't know if that's the Heavenly Go you mentioned," Han Sen said.

"Is that true?" Huangfu Pingqing was shocked, asking Han Sen to show her the skills he learned hastily.

Han Sen only demonstrated what he learned from Queen and did not expose any part of the technique in Dongxuan Sutra.

Huangfu Pingqing was even more surprised.

After she watched Han Sen's demonstration, she looked at Han Sen with a strange look and said, "Queen is a very proud person. Except for my grandparents, she did not care for anybody. Even I was ignored by her constantly. She would not even look at ordinary people. The fact that she would teach you Heavenly Go is simply incredulous, although she did not teach you a lot. Tell me, why is that?"
