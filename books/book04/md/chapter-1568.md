  The endless swordmind kept rushing against Han Sen’s will, and even Han Sen found it difficult to withstand. He felt as if he was falling into an abyss, where hope and lifeforces were gone forever.

If others were in his shoes, their wills would have broken. They would have given up. But Han Sen did not know what giving up meant. Beneath that pressure, his mind was still as hard as brushed steel, and he clung to the small amount of faith he had.

At a time like this, success was not achieved through strength. It wasn’t about talent, either. It was all determined by a person’s personality and the prior experiences that had shaped them.

If their personalities were weak, it did not matter how refined their skills were; their will would crumble. This was even true for super elites.

Even with a mind that was really strong, it was difficult to survive this sort of force.

Han Sen was a person with a mighty will, and he had adopted the stubborn personality that defined his parents. But even so, beneath the pressure of the swordmind, his grip and will were starting to lessen.

Furnace Emperor and Fire Empress saw Han Sen’s expression change, and they broke out in a cold sweat. They knew this was bad news. Han Sen might not be able to withstand the constant force much longer, and his swordmind and will could soon buckle and break.

Furnace Emperor and Fire Empress teleported to the garden. They planned to pull Han Sen out of the swordmark. But before they could try, Han Sen’s swordmind surged like an erupting volcano.

The force charged out from Han Sen’s swordmind to suppress the swordmind of the very mountain itself.

“How is this possible?” Fire Empress and Furnace Emperor were frozen in shock. They could not believe what their eyes were witnessing.

A human that did not even look super-class had a swordmind capable of suppressing Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind. They felt as if the world was changing right below their feet. They froze in place, unsure of exactly what they were doing.

Xu Mi was very excited at this point, and he said, “Teacher’s swordmind is so powerful! I don’t think I could find anyone with a stronger swordmind than his. Not even Six Paths Emperor could keep up with this performance.”

Han Sen felt terrible, though. When his swordmind almost broke, the sleeping Black Crystal Armor suddenly unleashed an additional portion of will directly into his swordmind to bolster it.

It was then that Han Sen’s swordmind erupted like mad, without any control. It allowed him to brush away Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind. He was even able to suppress the swordmind of the entire mountain.

But the will that came from the Black Crystal Armor was too strong, and when it entered Han Sen’s swordmind, he was almost unable to accept it all.

Fortunately, Han Sen had a strong personality and will. He made the best decision he could in the short amount of time he had to decide. He used his swordmind to reinforce that will.

Although it was hard, primarily due to the fact that Han Sen’s swordmind was weak and the boosting will was strong, Han Sen’s own will was strong, too. The boosting will was going accept him, so it was able to assimilate with Han Sen’s swordmind and allow a seamless increase in strength.

When that additional will refined itself inside Han Sen’s swordmind, it became stronger.

Boom!

Beneath the powerful impact of the swordmind, the mountain was sundered. It was cut in half and flung wide open. Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind was fading, and all that remained was Han Sen’s.

Furnace Emperor and Fire Empress felt their mouths drop. But they didn’t say anything, they just froze as if they had become petrified.

Holy Sword Emperor’s swordmind had been broken by Han Sen. It was difficult to believe.

Luo Yu, Luo Hui, Luo Li, and Jia Shidao had been waiting in the plaza for two days. But Han Sen had yet to return.

Luo Hui complained, “Han Sen is too arrogant! We are his elders, so why would he just leave us here?”

“This is not Godslayer Shelter, and it’s not his territory either. He can’t control anything here. Just wait a little longer,” Luo Li said.

“Yeah, we’re lucky we’re still breathing. Just wait a while,” Jia Shidao said.

Luo Yu started to say something, but before he could, the gates swung open. The two White Beasts stepped to either side as someone came out.

“Is he finally coming out?” The group of them had a look. It was indeed Han Sen who came striding out.

Luo Li wanted to shout Han Sen’s name, but she closed her mouth when she saw the people around him. Luo Yu and Luo Hui’s faces changed.

The people who walked out alongside Han Sen were Furnace Emperor and Fire Empress. They stood beside him, with Xu Mi trailing them from behind.

“Teacher Han, please teach Xu Mi well. Hit him if you need to. Treat and think of him as you would your own child,” Fire Empress said.

“Yes, Teacher Han. Let us know if there is anything you need. We will try to accommodate your needs in whatever way we can.” Furnace Emperor spoke with earnest passion.

Luo Li, Luo Yu, and Luo Hui were frozen in shock. They couldn’t believe what their eyes were telling them.

Furnace Emperor and Fire Empress were top-tier spirits of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, and yet, they were being friendly and very respectful to Han Sen.

It was hard to imagine how a human could get the likes of Furnace Emperor and Fire Empress to treat them that way. Not even Luo Haitang could accomplish that.

“Don’t worry; I will teach him. But how much he learns depends on his talent and his effort,” Han Sen said.

“You are right, Teacher Han. If Xu Mi can only learn a small bit from you, you can consider us satisfied,” Furnace Emperor said.

Fire Empress said, “It is up to Xu Mi how much he can learn from you. Even if he only learns a small amount from you, it is good enough for him.”

…

Jia Shidao and the others were all frozen. The two powerful spirits didn’t sound like emperors at all. Not as the humans had imagined. They looked like proper parents that were simply trying to snipe a good teacher for their kid.

“Is he really that strong?” Luo Li was confused.

She knew Han Sen was strong, but she found it hard to believe he was that strong. Even emperors were talking to him nicely. She hoped her own child might one day be able to study underneath his wing.

Luo Hui and Luo Yu’s brains were just empty. They could muster no reaction.

When they walked out of Furnace Shelter with Han Sen, they still felt as if they were in a dream and none of it was real.
