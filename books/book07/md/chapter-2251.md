“General Ghost Bone, you are to receive so many benefits off me, can you at least let me die as an educated man?” Han Sen spoke it strangely.

General Ghost Bone stopped his cackling and said, “Thank you for doing so much for me, but I am afraid I do not have the time to talk with you. All you need to know is that the relic you recovered is a key that enables the opening of Sacred leader’s treasure box. When I get the relic from the holy monument, I will use your body to travel around the world. Your body will most certainly be a famous one. You will not be dying in vain.”

“So what if you have a key? Do you even know where the holy monument is?” Han Sen asked.

“If I did not know, what would the point be in me taking that plate? The holy monument resides on this very planet. I just need to get out of this body. Then, I can go to the monument and recover the leader’s relic.” General Ghost Bone seemed to be very excited. He appeared to be drowning in his own dream.

Han Sen was only just a Duke, and back then, General Ghost Bone was incredibly strong all around the world. He would even look down to all the King class elites, but now, he had no choice. Given the opportunity for something else, he wouldn’t have settled for a Duke, though.

Back then, if he selected a deified body, he would have to consider.

Now, a Duke was in his control. He thought that it was his item already, and Han Sen was not so sure he could escape this.

Han Sen, after hearing a bit, acknowledged it was mostly General Ghost Bone’s dreaming. He had not told him where the monument was exactly. When he was just about to ask more, his body trembled. The Ghost Bone Mask was reduced to dust across his face. General Ghost Bone’s will was headed into his own will sea.

Right now, Han Sen had become a holy Bone. He looked as if he was a crystal or a statue made from bone. It felt as if people that saw him would definitely wish to obey him.

Han Sen knew that his body had finished the modification process. It was too late for him to ask General Ghost Bone anything now.

“Everybody, I am back! Shake beneath the quake of my footsteps.” General Ghost Bone’s will was something truly demonic. He was screaming into Han Sen’s own will.

General Ghost Bone, when entering Han Sen’s will sea, became shocked. “Why is your will sea like this?”

General Ghost Bone looked at the will sea. There was a tower in the middle of it, and inside, there was all sorts of beasts and xenogeneics around it. It was like a little world all of its own. General Ghost Bone had not seen anything like that before.

“It’s actually called a Sea of Soul.” Han Sen’s voice sounded inside the Sea of Soul.

“I do not care about what this Sea of Soul is, when I am here, this is my territory.” General Ghost Bone’s powerful willpower was suppressing the Sea of Soul. He wanted to claim that place and destroy Han Sen’s will. Once he accomplished that, he could fully claim Han Sen’s body for himself.

But as soon as his soul arrived there, in the corner of the Sea of Soul, a black crystal armorset suddenly came to life and lit up in his eyes. A scary will took over the entire Sea of Soul.

General Ghost Bone’s powerful deified will was destroyed when that will came. He did not stand a chance.

“Impossible… Impossible… Argh…” General Ghost Bone did not have the opportunity to escape the Sea of Soul. He screamed, and that scary will of his was crushed into nothingness.

The black crystal armorset’s power faded. It was like nothing had happened all that time. A general’s will had oh-so quickly been entirely dismissed.

“Why was he in such a rush to commit suicide? He did not even tell me where the holy monument was!” Han Sen knew this was going to happen. Nothing would end up well for someone who sought to invade his Sea of Soul.

Han Sen might have felt a little sorry for what happened, but he was ultimately made happy. General Ghost Bone’s leftover power was still inside Han Sen’s body, and that was his own now. He could become better with it.

Much Ghost Bone power gathered up in Han Sen’s body. If he refined all that Ghost Bone power, he could become a Duke.

That being said, it really was just leftover power from General Ghost Bone. It would not be as effective as a perfect and raw power. Still, it was deified power. The strength and purity was naturally far better than a Duke’s. Every ounce of that power was utterly priceless.

Now, Han Sen’s body was filled up with deified Ghost Bone power. His body was like a treasure in itself. He did not have to locate any more resources. He only had to refine that power, and likely level up from it.

And it wasn’t just his Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra that would level up. Even his The Story of Genes might level up to become Duke. It had the possibility of even going further.

“General Ghost Bone was nice. It was a shame he died so early. It would have been perfect if he was able to tell me where the holy monument is.” Han Sen sighed.

Han Sen was thinking for a bit, and then, he opened his eyes. He saw Fox Queen standing in front of him.

“My Dear, thank you so much,” Han Sen coldly said, as he looked on Fox Queen. Now, his body was like Ghost Bone’s. Fox Queen had not seen what had occurred inside the Sea of Soul, so she was not yet aware that he had died. Now he could disguise himself as General Ghost Bone, and in doing so, fool Fox Queen.

Fox Queen looked at Han Sen and laughed, “You look very evil. Ghost Bone, do you think I will help you? You locked me up here for a billion years, all to make me suffer. I have waited for this for so long. Now that you have a body and you cannot use your power for a while. You are just a Duke, too, so the time has come for me to kill you.”

Han Sen was shocked. He did not expect this. He wanted to disguise himself as General Ghost Bone, all so he could fool her. He thought he could get some secrets from her, too. He did not know this was going to happen.

Fox Queen looked strange. The substance chain around her body was tangling her. Her white hair was waving and her fox tail was trembling. She was going to break the air.

The chain and the shackles were full of a black smoke. Five ghostly hand tried to hold onto Fox Queen’s neck, wrists, and ankles.

Fox Queen’s substance chain blocked those black hands, though. The hands could not stop her. Fox Queen reached her hand out, and the substance chain was going right for Han Sen.

“Hang on! I am not General Ghost Bone, I am San Mu!” Han Sen quickly said.

“Maybe that trick might work on others, but it won’t work on me.” Fox Queen did not believe Han Sen, and the substance chain kept going for him. It was not going to relent.

Fox Queen believed this was her only chance. Her body was tied up, and she had spent most of her power suppressing the metal chains. The actual power she could use was a very small amount to her total, and she needed to kill General Ghost Bone while his body was still only a Duke. If it was any later, she would not have that chance.

Fox Queen had waited many years for this opportunity.
