<h2>Get Pregnant With Just a Rub?</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2075</h3>

<p>Ice crystals kept spreading across the Blood Feather Knife, and
it looked as if everything within the vacuumed container was going
to freeze. The ice crystals grew, branching out like blood vessels.
It was scary to watch.</p>
<p>“Yu Shanxin must be half-deified. If he wasn’t, there’s no way
he could freeze the vacuum.” Han Sen was surprised.</p>
<p>Everyone watched as the ice powers spread through the container,
freezing even the empty space within it. In the end, it was all
frozen. It looked like a perfect crystal ball.</p>
<p>The Absolute Container was shining, and something seemed to be
moving within the ice. Something was fighting against the cold
powers.</p>
<p>The researchers were fortunate that the Absolute Container was
deified. Despite their strength, the cold powers weren’t leaking
out of the container.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin pulled his hand out of the container. He looked as
ordinary as ever, and his hand showed no sign of the incredible
cold that he had just released.</p>
<p>“My work is done here. Let’s go, Old Wang,” Yu Shanxin said,
then pulled the dog Old Wang away. When he passed by Han Sen, Yu
Shanxin said quietly, “Why are you still standing here? Don’t
interrupt their research.”</p>
<p>Han Sen cocked his head, then followed Yu Shanxin to leave.</p>
<p>The researchers inside Sky Path Garden got back to work. Some of
them saw Han Sen leave with Yu Shanxin, but no one thought to stop
him.</p>
<p>“Mister Yu, do you have a grudge with the head researcher?” Han
Sen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Call me Yu Shanxin.” Yu Shanxin carried Old Wang as they
walked, and he went on to say, “There is no grudge. I just don’t
like the way they do things.”</p>
<p>“How do they do things?” Han Sen asked again.</p>
<p>“Do you know what Child Combine Liquid is made of?” Yu Shanxin
looked at the vial in Han Sen’s hand as he asked.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t know. This is the first time I’ve heard of this
item, actually,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Child Combine Liquid uses thousands of unborn xenogeneic babies
as an ingredient. There are intelligent creatures in there, like
you and me.” Yu Shanxin looked at Han Sen and smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised the Child Combine Liquid to the light so he could
take a look at it. He was surprised to hear this, and so he said,
“Where do these ingredients come from?”</p>
<p>“They come from the creatures that the members of Sky Path
Garden capture. They do tests on them. What do you think?” Yu
Shanxin asked. He noticed Han Sen was not having much of a
reaction，which interested him.</p>
<p>“I am a sinner with hands stained in blood. I cannot judge
them.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin laughed. He patted Han Sen on the shoulder and said,
“This is why I hate those people, but they are the ones that make
Sky Palace as strong as it is. I just don’t like it. Still, it
doesn’t matter. I’m a useless nobody here, and that’s just
that.”</p>
<p>Yu Shanxin left after that, still carrying Old Wang. He
disappeared amongst the islands somewhere.</p>
<p>“Why did he tell me that?” Han Sen looked at the Child Combine
Liquid and sighed. He was not very noble himself, as he had killed
so many. But after Yu Shanxin spoke about the ingredients inside
the vial, he didn’t think he could bring himself to drink it.</p>
<p>“Never mind; I’ll just give it to the others.” Han Sen put away
the Child Combine Liquid and went to the general service area.</p>
<p>Han Sen researched the rules of Sky Palace. If he wanted to
bring Bao’er here, legally, he’d need to go to the general service.
Han Sen asked the people there how he might bring another person
into Sky Palace, and it turned out to be an easier process than Han
Sen had expected.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s rank of Teacher was useful in many different ways in
Sky Palace. With that title, he could invite his family to come and
live with him. Without that title, no parent or spouse could ever
visit him here.</p>
<p>But annoyingly, if he said Bao’er was his daughter, then they’d
need to do a DNA test. Han Sen didn’t know exactly how the test
would be conducted, but there was no way the results would tell
them that Bao’er was indeed his actual daughter.</p>
<p>But according to the laws of Sky Palace, aside from parents and
grandparents, only wives and kids were allowed to reside with a
Teacher.</p>
<p>“It looks like I still can’t bring Bao’er into Sky Palace.” Han
Sen felt depressed.</p>
<p>The only other way was for Han Sen to make additional
contributions to Sky Palace and gain the approval of at least half
of the elders. Han Sen could also ask for the leader’s approval,
but attempting that seemed unrealistic.</p>
<p>His discoveries had made him curious about Bao’er’s DNA, though.
He had Bubble take on his appearance and go to sleep on Jade
Island. Then, he went back to the Alliance and visited Bao’er. He
took one of her hairs and went for a DNA test, wanting to see if
her genes looked like any creature in particular.</p>
<p>The DNA tests in the Alliance were rather advanced, but Bao’er
herself had come out of a gourd. None knew what her genes were
like.</p>
<p>Han Sen almost bought the entire planet and made the testing
place a temporary home. He walked in front of the gene tester and
put Bao’er’s hair inside so he could conduct the test.</p>
<p>Not long after, the test results were released. The results were
printed upon a sheet of paper, and what he saw made his eyes
widen.</p>
<p>The DNA test printout read, “Father and Daughter.”</p>
<p>“D*mn, what a broken machine! And I just bought this thing… Who
made this piece of shit? Ah, I see. It is Starry Group! I’ll
complain to Ning Yue later.” Han Sen did not believe the results,
so he did the same test on another DNA tester. The results almost
made his eyes fall out. All the tests were the same, telling him
that he and Bao’er were father and daughter.</p>
<p>“This is impossible.” Han Sen swore he had never cheated with a
gourd before. How could the results indicate that he and Bao’er
were genetically related?</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the report carefully. Bao’er’s genes had a
99.99% match with his. Aside from them actually being father and
daughter, there was no other explanation.</p>
<p>“How is this possible?” Han Sen looked at Bao’er, who was
looking innocent and unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>You can get pregnant with just a rub?” Han Sen remembered that
after he picked up the gourd, he used to fiddle with it while he
thought. Aside from that, though, he couldn’t think of any way they
could have formed this connection.</p>
<p>But now, Han Sen had to admit that Bao’er was his actual
daughter.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly destroyed all the test results. He took Bao’er
by the shoulders and smiled. “Bao’er, let’s not tell mom that we
came here for testing.”</p>
