<p>Han Sen was never too interested in things that were not pretty,
but he would never have guessed the purple copper sword was
actually Asura, the alpha of the Demon race.</p>
<p>He carried the little girl through the Soldier Weapon Sky while
in flight. He hoped to find a trace or two of Bao’er. Now, Soldier
Weapon Sky was bigger than ever. Han Sen flew through the air for
half a day, and he had yet to find a single sign of Bao’er’s body.
It made him feel really bad.</p>
<p>“If Bao’er became a weapon, I do not think I will be able to
find her,” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>While he was thinking, he suddenly heard the weapon forest
emanate with the sound of a moaning weapon. He used the Dongxuan
Aura to cover that place. It was a great ax that was moaning.</p>
<p>Han Sen carried the little girl with him as he descended to the
big ax. The big ax was 90-feet tall. Even the blade itself was two
stories tall. It was unknown what sort of being might have been
able to wield a weapon as large as that.</p>
<p>Judging from the moaning of the big ax, it was rather similar to
Han Sen. It used to be a creature once upon a time.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped. The little girl’s hands were still holding onto
the metal jian Han Sen. She looked like a little witch that was
riding a broomstick. She was not willing to let go.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a headache come on. He was not a heartless man. He
did not want to bring harm to the little girl, but the little girl
kept following him. That was not good for him.</p>
<p>A voice sounded from not too far away. “Hm, we found another
member of the soldiers, but it looks like you picked a useless
weapon.”</p>
<p>A young man had arrived. He was clad in armor and holding a
knife. His presence was very strange, but he was quite similar to
the little girl. Like the woman who took the purple copper sword,
he was likely a member of the soldiers too.</p>
<p>In the next second, the young man slashed the little girl. The
little girl leaped down from the metal jian. She held the metal
jian and fought the young man’s knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Jadeskin to turn the jian into one with an ice jade
body. He struck the incoming knife.</p>
<p>After the hit, the young man’s knife was snapped in half. The
ice-jade jian’s overbearing aura did not reduce either. It moved
forward to sever the young man’s head.</p>
<p>There was a “pang” as the young man’s head was squashed by the
ice-jade jian.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something unbelievable happened. The body of the young
man whose head had been broken turned into a spirit light. It went
into the little girl. The little girl looked as if she had just
been given a shot of adrenaline. She grew up very quickly. She now
looked to be around 10 years old.</p>
<p>When the little girl grew up, a strange power came from her. It
went into Han Sen’s jian, forcing it to exhibit some changes.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He discovered the strength of his body had
just increased. Even if his Break World rate had not been altered,
the increase in his body’s strength was still a great boon for
him.</p>
<p>“Can something that good really happen? Compared to
strengthening your body, I would prefer actually having a body.”
Han Sen felt a bit depressed.</p>
<p>While was thinking, a scary sword light arose. The sword light
was rather like a storm that destroyed the weapon forest.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura covered the place. It enabled him to see
a man and a woman, two holy soldiers, engaged in battle. The weapon
the woman was holding was a strange sort of sword.</p>
<p>The other soldier member, who was wielding a spear, had his
weapon broken by the woman’s sword. The man became a spirit light
that entered the woman’s body. It made her sword stronger as well.
The sword glowed even more.</p>
<p>After seeing the sword, Han Sen felt his heart jump. The sword
presence was something he was familiar with, but he could not be
entirely certain.</p>
<p>“Did Qin Xiu become a weapon too?” Han Sen observed the
sword.</p>
<p>The sword was straight, but both sides of the blade were
serrated. It looked like a really scary weapon. It felt like even
if one was just to inch closer to it, one would be hurt.</p>
<p>The presence of that sword was not unlike Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>“Qin Xiu and the people of the God Chaos Party were always in
the 33 skies, but they should not be down here in Soldier Weapon
Sky. How did Qin Xiu end up like a sword over here?” As Han Sen
wondered about this, the woman holding the sword discovered the
little girl. She looked cold as she waved her sword on her way to
slash her.</p>
<p>The woman swung her sword so quickly that the little girl could
not react in time. So, Han Sen jumped before her and went to clash
with the enemy sword.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The sword and jian collided against each other. The sword was
like a saw going to the jian. It left a mark on the ice-jade jian
whereas the opposing sword was fine.</p>
<p>“Is that really Qin Xiu?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He saw the
woman wave her sword. This time, Han Sen used the power of Super
Spank to strike the enemy blade.</p>
<p>Then, there was another gold-jade moaning sound. The ice-jade
jian was delivered a deep gash. Han Sen saw that the sword was not
damaged.</p>
<p>The woman holding the sword did not attack. She looked at Han
Sen strangely and said, “You have managed to block two of my sword
strikes, yet you are not dead. You have improved quite a bit.”</p>
<p>“Qin Xiu.” Han Sen was shocked. The woman’s voice sounded like a
woman, but its tone and the mannerisms used were like those of a
man.</p>
<p>Clearly, that soldier member was controlled by Qin Xiu. She was
not the one controlling the saw sword.</p>
<p>The woman said, “I did not expect to see you here, but this is a
good thing. If I kill you here, Wan’er will stop thinking about
you.” She picked up her sword and tried attacking Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen started to fly. The jian perforated the little girl’s
clothes to hook her body so she could go with him. He used Galaxy
Teleportation.</p>
<p>When Han Sen finished using Galaxy Teleportation, the woman was
in front of him with the saw sword slashing toward him.</p>
<p>“You can’t escape,” Qin Xiu coldly said.</p>
<p>“If I can’t run, then I will have to fight.” Han Sen put down
the little girl and used all the power in his body to open four
Break World-class geno arts. His jian glowed with a jade light. It
was going to the saw sword Qin Xiu had become.</p>
<p>With the buffing power of those four geno arts, the jian’s body
and opposing sword struck each other. The jian was delivered
another mark. After a few more hits, more gashes sprinkled the
composure of the jian.</p>
<p>“I do not know if this is going to work.” Han Sen tried to use
his Jadeskin power to create a hollow structure so he could make
the jian stronger.</p>
<p>The results were not so great. The jian received more
wounds.</p>
