<h2>The Meeting of Two Metal Beasts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2154</h3>

<p>After completing his preparations, Han Sen brought Bao’er and
Metal Eater to the Metal World.</p>
<p>After they arrived, Han Sen didn’t waste time looking around for
a threat. He grabbed Bao’er and Metal Eater in a hurry and
teleported away from the area.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his greatest worries were unfounded. The little
metal beast wasn’t waiting to attack him on his return.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen had a look around, depression sank into him.
The worst scenario might not have transpired, but that didn’t mean
his arrival had gone unnoticed. Rather than returning to the pit it
had emerged from, as Han Sen wished, the Metal Beast was sleeping
atop a ruin constructed of rubble as if it were a mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s teleportation had roused the Metal Beast. It got up
and looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“D*mn it! If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have
teleported. I should have snuck away.” Han Sen groused.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen, the Metal Beast stood up. But then, when it
noticed Metal Eater, its eyes widened. Han Sen’s Metal Eater looked
at the Metal Beast with equal amounts of curiosity. The black and
white Metal Beasts stared at each other.</p>
<p>“It worked!” Han Sen was happy.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast stared at the other for a while. It
squealed at Metal Eater. It seemed to be saying something, but Han
Sen had no clue what. At the very least, it didn’t sound
threatening.</p>
<p>Metal Eater wriggled out of Han Sen’s arms and dropped onto the
ground. Then, it made some noise at the white Metal Beast in
return.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast made another sound and ran towards Metal
Eater.</p>
<p>This made Han Sen nervous, of course. He wanted to grab Metal
Eater and run for it, but Metal Eater was actually running at the
white Metal Beast instead.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that Metal Eater wasn’t a terribly smart creature,
but it could sense danger. It wouldn’t allow itself to fall into
harm. So, Han Sen shelved his plan to teleport away and watched the
pair keenly.</p>
<p>The black and white Metal Beasts came together. They looked at
each other. Metal Eater was much larger than the white Metal Beast,
but its power was much weaker. That was an aspect of their meeting
that worried Han Sen.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>The two Metal Beasts both cast their shields. The white Metal
Beast’s shield was transparent, but Metal Eater’s shield was
infused with the power of Consume. Because of this, it was a bit
darker.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast circled Metal Eater and gave it a
sniff.</p>
<p>“Are they talking in code?” Han Sen was very worried. He was
worried that the white Metal Beast might discover that Metal Eater
wasn’t the same kind. Or maybe it would attack Metal Eater because
the sanctuary creature was too weak to compare.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast circled around Metal Eater some more, and
eventually, it jumped. Han Sen’s heart almost froze. And just as he
was about to move and save Metal Eater, he realized that the white
Metal Beast was actually jumping towards the pit it had initially
emerged from.</p>
<p>Metal Eater didn’t move. It looked in the direction that the
white Metal Beast had disappeared.</p>
<p>A cold sweat had gathered on Han Sen’s forehead. If the white
Metal Beast wished to kill Metal Eater, he didn’t know if he had
what it took to save his companion.</p>
<p>“Good… good… but what exactly happened? Did they recognize each
other? Or do they just need to talk some more?” Han Sen’s heart was
oscillating at a number of different speeds. Sometimes faster,
sometimes slower.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was still deep in thought, the white Metal Beast
returned from its hole. Its fat body came waddling over to Metal
Eater.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw that the white Metal Beast was holding a metal
branch about the length of a man’s arm. The branch contained a few
metallic fruits. The white Metal Beast moved over to Metal Eater
and placed the branch directly in front of him.</p>
<p>Metal Eater showed no reaction to it, so the white Metal Beast
walked closer to its alternate self and made some loud sniffing
noises.</p>
<p>Metal Eater lowered its head, rolled its tongue out, and gobbled
up one of the fruits.</p>
<p>When the white Metal Beast saw Metal Eater consume one of the
fruits, it merrily ran around it. It stood next to Metal Eater and
used its body to rub against the larger creature. It looked very
happy.</p>
<p>Metal Eater ate a few more of those metallic fruits, and its
body began to shine. Then, Metal Eater released a strange
substance. It became a geno armament to envelope its body, then
melted back inside the creature.</p>
<p>“Is it going to become a Baron?” Han Sen was as surprised as he
was delighted.</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy that the white Metal Beast had given Metal
Eater a metallic fruit that was obviously some good stuff, but he
was surprised that Metal Eater was becoming a Baron. Now it
couldn’t return to the sanctuary without being harmed.</p>
<p>“But a Metal World like this is far more suitable for it. It
won’t have to stay in the warehouse all alone,” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>The white Metal Beast appeared to guard Metal Eater while it
made the change to become a Baron. It stared at Han Sen and Bao’er
as if they were thieves.</p>
<p>“You are the outsider here,” it seemed to be saying. Han Sen
felt awkward.</p>
<p>Metal Eater’s evolution appeared to go well. Its form grew
darker and smaller, but its body looked more metallic than
ever.</p>
<p>Seeing Metal Eater’s successful evolution, the white Metal Beast
happily licked Metal Eater’s cheek. It was definitely a sign of
affection.</p>
<p>Han Sen became concerned, though. If he wasn’t certain Metal
Eater was a male, he would think that the white Metal Beast was
looking for someone to mate with.</p>
<p>“Metal Eater is male. If the white Metal Beast is female, then
they can mate. But the white Metal Beast is so strong… God knows
how long it’s been alive for. Isn’t it a bit too old for my Metal
Eater?” Han Sen looked at them strangely.</p>
<p>The very lovely scene, in Han Sen’s eyes, became vaguely
ominous.</p>
<p>Metal Eater was very quiet, unlike the white Metal Beast that
was so active. The white Metal Beast had spoken a few times, but it
had received a response only once.</p>
<p>But even so, the white Metal Beast was very happy. It returned
to the hole and provided Metal Eater with even more of its metallic
fruits.</p>
<p>“Shit! Is that thing hitting on my Metal Eater? If that is the
case, a sacrifice might have to be made. Whether or not we can
escape Metal World depends on you, Metal Eater. Work your charms!”
Han Sen encouraged Metal Eater.</p>
<p>But quite clearly, Metal Eater did not understand what it was
being told. All it did was munch on the fruit the white Metal Beast
had brought it. It was so lazy that it didn’t even speak.</p>
