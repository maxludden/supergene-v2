    <p>
      At a remote corner of the frozen lake, Han Sen made an ice hole from
      underneath the water and climbed out. He shook off the water on his body
      and quickly left the lake for the icefield seeing no one was around.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to go to Starwheel Shelter to ask Li Xinglun about the
      detailed information of Blackgod Shelter. Only when he had more
      information about his enemy could he hit his enemy harder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially, Han Sen must find out about Blackgod&#8217;s knife skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun was very glad to see Han Sen visiting him. Hearing Han Sen
      explaining his conflict with Blackgod, he frowned and said,
      &#8220;Blackgod is more and more arrogant and wanton.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun explained the background of Blackgod in details to Han Sen,
      which made Han Sen frowned slightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The family of Blackgod was quite ordinary, but he was working for a force
      in the Alliance, which made it almost impossible for Han Sen to kill him
      in the Alliance. Among all the shelters, he was the strongest on the
      icefield. In addition, every month he provided a large sum of income to
      the force in the Alliance, which gave him strong support. It was not easy
      to take him down.
    </p>

    <p>
      As for the knife skills of Blackgod, all Li Xinglun knew was that it was
      called Tornado Knife. He did not know how it worked either. Li Xinglun
      only knew that when Blackgod made the move, the knife would disappear for
      a moment, as if it was teleported.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, Blackgod was merely an evolver, so he could not have the
      ability to make the knife teleport. There must be some special techniques
      that they did not know of.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Tornado Knife, it sounds familiar somehow?&#8221; Han Sen felt he
      had heard about the name somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking about it, Han Sen then remembered that Tang Zhenliu had once said
      that one of his knife skills was Tornado Knife.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, from what Han Sen could remember, Tang Zhenliu did not have the
      ability to make his weapon disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Would this Blackgod be related to Tang Zhenliu?&#8221; Han Sen was
      determined to ask Tang Zhenliu first when he went back, to figure out what
      Tornado Knife was about.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he returned to the Alliance, Han Sen asked Ji Yanran to get him the
      number of Tang Zhenliu in the military. Han Sen then contacted Tang
      Zhenliu.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, how does it feel to be a soldier?&#8221; Tang Zhenliu
      asked Han Sen, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel much,&#8221; Han Sen shrugged and said.</p>

    <p>
      He was telling the truth. Although he was now Ji Yanran&#8217;s guard, the
      actual guard was Annie, so Han Sen was merely a declaration.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, no one expected that Han Sen could protect Ji Yanran as an
      evolver. His position was required by Ji Yanran herself, and initially her
      guard was only Annie.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, since Annie had arrived, Han Sen had a lot less time to spend
      with Ji Yanran. That woman was following Ji Yanran almost 24/7, which made
      Han Sen very mad about it, even questioning whether she was a lesbian in
      love with Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha ha, your life is great. With the beauty on your side, it is not
      like an ordinary service. You are completely on vacation with your girl.
      Lin Feng and I are having a terrible time. We are either training or
      fighting the Shura, almost losing our lives several times,&#8221; said
      Tang Zhenliu, feeling upset.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How come you guys are at the front?&#8221; Han Sen asked, puzzled.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the background of Tang Zhenliu and Lin Feng, it should be easy for
      them to stay in the back, but they were serving in the front.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is completely Lin Feng&#8217;s idea. He said only by doing this
      can we exercise ourselves. He must stay in this hell and the wars are so
      frequent that I have almost gone mad.&#8221; Although Tang Zhenliu said
      that, he was smiling. Obviously, he was just joking stop
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Tang Zhenliu carefully and found he had much darker skin
      than before. He also looked tougher with an injury that had not cured on
      his forehead, looking more like a man.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu explained briefly what was happening on his side. Lin Feng
      and he were warframe soldiers. And on their planet, humans and Shura were
      coexisting, fighting for the mines. However, because of the location of
      the planet, no one could take the entire planet. Both forces had armies on
      the planet and they fought once in a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they had finished chatting, Han Sen then asked about Blackgod and
      Tornado Knife. After hearing Han Sen&#8217;s words, Tang Zhenliu hit the
      table madly and said coldly, &#8220;Dammit. Han Sen, if you have the
      chance, killed the bastard for me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised to see Tang Zhenliu being so excited, so he asked
      Tang Zhenliu what had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu told Han Sen that Tornado Knife was originally one of the
      family secrets of the Tangs. Later on, due to some incidents in the
      family, Tornado Knife was robbed by others, which was a huge shame for the
      family.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then I could act freely.&#8221; Han Sen was initially afraid that
      there might be some kind of connection between Blackgod and Tang Zhenliu,
      which might be awkward in the future. At this point, he was completely
      relaxed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill him, and I will treat you to drinks. Do not worry about people
      supporting Blackgod. If you could kill him, I will take care of those
      people.&#8221; Tang Zhenliu told Han Sen about the core secret of Tornado
      Knife, wishing Han Sen could get rid of Tang Zhenliu, giving his family
      justice.
    </p>

    <p>
      After hearing Tang Zhenliu&#8217;s explanation, Han Sen understood why it
      looked like Blackgod&#8217;s knife had disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, it did not truly disappear. Just because the Tornado Knife was so
      fast, it felt like it had disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      The speed was not continuous, but a temporary effect in the attack. In a
      short amount of time, the speed of the knife increased greatly, making the
      high-speed even higher, causing a visual illusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, the knife seen by the eyes was the shadow of the knife. The real
      knife had already changed its location.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen had understood the mechanism of Tornado Knife, it was
      still very difficult to tackle it. At that kind of speed, even if he knew
      what was happening, it would be useless if he could not follow the knife.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Han Sen&#8217;s eyesight, he could not even see the knife, so even if
      he knew the knife was elsewhere, he could not block it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu did not have enough speed and strength in the past, so he did
      not achieve the same effect as Blackgod. Currently, if he used the skills,
      he would not be worse than Blackgod.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you have time tomorrow?&#8221; Tang Zhenliu asked Han Sen.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Han Sen.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay then. You go to the virtual camp tomorrow and I will spar with
      you. Today I have something else, so I must leave now.&#8221; Tang Zhenliu
      was a decisive person, so he directly hung up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew that Tang Zhenliu was going to spar with him using Tornado
      Knife, which was great news to Han Sen.
