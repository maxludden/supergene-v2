<h2>Flying Fish</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3127</h3>

<p>Sky King’s black hole consumed everything in its path. The sun
spirit gourd expelled a surge of the three-foot sunbirds, but they
were all quickly consumed by the black hole. It was futile for it
to even try.</p>
<p>Sky King rushed in front of the sun spirit gourd, which looked
like it was going to be swallowed by the black hole. The God Spirit
Blood-Pulse fish’s eyes below the sun spirit gourd suddenly opened.
They burned with a white flame. Suddenly, the entire world went
white. Not even the peacock king’s eye enabled vision through that
white light. No one was able to see what was happening. The God
Spirit Blood-Pulse spirit fish exploded with light. It came and
went fast. The lights suddenly started to dim. Han Sen quickly used
his peacock king eye-skill to see.</p>
<p>The God Spirit Blood-Pulse fish had vanished, but the sun spirit
gourd’s body was still burning with a white flame. It incinerated
everything around into nothing. Even Sky King’s black hole, which
was getting close to the gourd, was burned by the white flames.</p>
<p>Sky King’s expression changed. He pushed the black hole to keep
attacking the gourd. No matter how terrifying the black hole
appeared, it was burned into nothing once it got close to the
gourd. It was unable to consume the gourd.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>There was a crunching noise. The gourd had a crack.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that, Sky King was happy. Clearly, the gourd was
unable to endure his suppression powers. He raged on and produced
more black holes to fight against the gourd.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not feeling as good about it as Sky King. The gourd
breaking did not mean it had failed to withstand the pressure. He
thought that perhaps something else was emerging</p>
<p>He recalled having had such a feeling before. He remembered how
it had seemed like there were eyes inside the gourd looking at him.
He did not believe it was just the mere presence and aura of the
gourd.</p>
<p>Perhaps the gourd was just a shell harboring something else.
Perhaps what resided inside the shell was the true nemesis that had
to be contended with.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen had witnessed Bao’er being born from a gourd.
Whenever he saw a gourd, he tended to feel as if there was
something inside it.</p>
<p>Sky King was different. He had never seen life emerge from a
gourd. He thought that cracks appearing in the gourd meant it was a
gene race he was on the verge of killing, so he did not stop. He
kept pumping power into the gourd.</p>
<p>The gourd developed more cracks. It looked as if it would be
unable to endure much more pressure and was sure to break. Han Sen
did not feel safe and retreated. The gourd consumed the God Spirit
Blood-Pulse. According to the Cast God Court’s theory, the gourd
must have reached ultimate mode. If it was going any further, it
might evolve into a scary life level. Although it was a gene race,
it might become a wild God Spirit.</p>
<p>Of course, this was Cast God Court’s method. It required other
people to achieve. Han Sen did not know if a wild gene race could
accomplish this life-level change.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The gourd finally exploded. The snow-white shell, which looked
like jade, was obliterated into pieces. It quickly melted into the
white fire. It was suddenly reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>The expressions of Han Sen and Sky King changed. There was a
weird creature amidst the exploded gourd.</p>
<p>The creature looked like an eel, but it had wings. It was like a
fish and a bird combined, but it was not like the little red bird
that could change into a fish or a bird at will.</p>
<p>This was a bird and a fish at the same time. It was better to
call it a flying fish.</p>
<p>When the flying fish emerged, its eyes peered at Sky King. It
opened its mouth and cast a frightening amount of white fire. Sky
King looked glum. One of his hand’s clutched Yin and while the
other hand grabbed Yang. He stuck them together to create a giant
black hole. He flew at the flying fish with fire power that did not
look very powerful.</p>
<p>Chila!</p>
<p>The white flame perforated the black hole. It went into Sky
King’s hand.</p>
<p>Sky King’s expression changed. The flying fish quickly broke the
high-temperature liquid. Its body was glowing with a cold light. It
was like a strong current heading for his armor.</p>
<p>The white flame wasn’t put out. It just would not go out. It
spread onto his gauntlets.</p>
<p>Sky King was shocked. He did not bother to think. He cast away
his ravaged gauntlet to ease the pain of his burning hand.</p>
<p>The flaming flying fish did not want to let him go. It flapped
its wings and followed him, spewing more storms of fire.</p>
<p>Sky King still wanted to kill the gene race. Even without a God
Spirit Blood-Pulse, that powerful gene race was a good ingredient
for a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Now, he wasn’t so sure. He did not know what sort of gene race
he had combined with, but he had thunder wings. He flapped them and
flew away.</p>
<p>The flying fish was faster than him. Han Sen heard a scream. Sky
King’s ass was on fire. It looked as if he was doing poorly.</p>
<p>Sky King kept running and throwing away parts of his armor. He
did not have the courage to return and resume a fight like
that.</p>
<p>Han Sen hurriedly flapped his wings and flew up. He saw Sky King
get chased by the flying fish as his armor burned. He kept taking
off parts of his armor and tossing them aside. He was actually
willing to abandon the armor.</p>
<p>Both Sky King and the flying fish were very fast. They were so
fast that it was like they were teleporting. They raced off of the
planet and into space. Han Sen tried his hardest to catch up, but
the lead they had over him gradually increased.</p>
<p>Seeing he was going to lose them both. Han Sen had to break the
rules of the sky and use Galaxy Teleportation to get closer to them
and not lose them.</p>
<p>A normal people’s vision was unable to witness their movements.
They could not see Sky King and the flying fish, but Han Sen could.
The Qin Kingdom’s king with different surnamed, an existence who
shocked the universe, was being chased by a flying fish. He was
chased all the way from the ground and into space. His hair was
messed up. He looked terrible.</p>
<p>Sky King used all kinds of scary gene combination skills to try
and stop the flying fish’s pursuit. Everything he tried was in
vain. Nothing worked. The flames were terrifying. At such an
extreme level, they charred everything into nothing. Everything
around was easily ignited. If one touched it, one could not put it
out. Everything that came into contact with the flames was
roasted.</p>
<p>Sky King carelessly let his hair catch on fire. Without
hesitation, he cut off his white hair. He did not want the fire to
touch his head.</p>
<p>“This flying fish is against the sky.” Han Sen was shocked. The
unstoppable flames and scary speed were something an Annihilation
God Spirit was unable to defeat.</p>
<p>“This God Spirit Blood-Pulse must be Annihilation class. If it
wasn’t, the flying fish would not be that powerful.” Although Han
Sen wanted to turn the flying fish into an egg, he calculated that
if he broke the rules of the world to fight, he might not be able
to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Sky King was chased on the ground and into space. It was unknown
how many geno armaments were burned, but he did not dare let the
flame touch his body. He felt very sad about the losses, but he had
no choice.</p>
<p>In the end, without his geno armaments, he would summon a gene
race to take the damage for him if he could not evade the fire. Han
Sen would have felt bad for him if he had to see god-class gene
races burned to dust.</p>
