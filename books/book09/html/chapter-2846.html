<p>Han Sen did not watch the next fight. He had to quickly increase
his genes so he could become butterfly class. If he didn’t do that,
he wouldn’t stand a chance when it came to fighting top-class
deified creatures.</p>
<p>Han Sen went straight to the Nine-Defense Palace. Before the
next fight began, he was hoping to achieve butterfly class.</p>
<p>But his gene leveling-up progress was not very smooth. That was
because he was already larva class. He ate loads of low-class
deified xenogeneic genes, but it did not increase his gene tally
very much. He needed at least larva class deified genes if he
wanted to soundly earn more. It was the only way to gain the amount
of deified genes he needed.</p>
<p>Of course, it was great to have butterfly class deified genes.
He would get more genes from them, but the xenogeneics in
Nine-Defense Palace were mostly primitive classes. Xenogeneics like
Time Ghost, even though it was locked up, was not something Han Sen
had the chops to kill. So, his progression was going at a snail’s
pace for the time being,</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen’s next opponent was only going to be a
transmutation deified. He had a long time to go before the next
fight, and Han Sen won the fight smoothly.</p>
<p>In his third match, his opponent was similar and larva class. It
was a xenogeneic that looked like a giant dragon, but it was not an
opponent that truly challenged him. Han Sen wanted to kill it, but
the giant dragon was evil. The moment it saw things going sour, it
threw in the towel and escaped.</p>
<p>Han Sen won every battle he fought. The name Dollar was
something becoming learned across the universe.</p>
<p>It was a shame Han Sen had to focus all of his time on
practicing. He did not have much time to focus on the matches
conducted by others, so Han Sen had no idea that the most popular
name wasn’t actually Dollar. It had become Space Garden’s Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Space Garden did not have a deified, yet seven from there had
joined in the god fights. Although they were all primitive class,
their performances had been exceptional.</p>
<p>Aside from one of them having bad luck in which the person who
encountered a butterfly class xenogeneic had to get kicked out, the
other six were able to reach the third round.</p>
<p>Of course, luck was involved with them all. After all, they were
all primitive classes. They did not meet strong enemies in their
first two bouts, but their performances and powers displayed were
still quite shocking.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of them were the best of what a primitive
deified could achieve. They all had very good powers.</p>
<p>Everyone thought this was because of Han Sen. Thus, Space Garden
and Han Sen, who did not even use his real name to join the fights,
had become the hot topic of the universe.</p>
<p>“Godfather Han is so awesome. Sword Fairy, Queen, and Dragon
Lady Chef are all stronger than the others. I would like to go to
Space Garden. I wonder if Godfather would be willing to bless me
too. Then, I could come out and play here.”</p>
<p>“I think the little lady from Demon with purple clothing and the
little lady from the Feather are stronger.”</p>
<p>“I did not expect Teacher Xie to become deified as well. Also,
he is a part of Space Garden. That is so rare. But Teacher Xie’s
luck is so bad. He met a Very High true god class, so he had to
concede.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! Space Garden has seven deifieds. Only Teacher Xie was
the one who had the poorest luck. Even that weakest Wang Yuhang had
extremely good luck. He encountered two primitive deified
xenogeneics that were very weak, and it got him into the third
round.”</p>
<p>“It is a shame Godfather Han has chosen not to participate in
the fights. If he did take part, it would surely be quite
interesting.”</p>
<p>“Does Godfather Han need to join the fight? He can just spit out
deifieds. Does he need to join the god fights himself? He will earn
vast fortunes by just sitting at home.”</p>
<p>“How do we get Godfather Han to start blessing us? If I could
ask him, I would be willing to spend everything.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you even think about it. Every big race has tried
capturing Han Sen like crazy. He has created many deifieds. Even
the three high races are jealous of what he can do.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it will be long before Space Garden becomes the
fifth-biggest faction in the entire universe. It might even
threaten the four races ahead of it. I would suggest pledging our
allegiance to them quickly. If Space Garden really does become big,
we will be the very first few to support it.”</p>
<p>“What you are saying makes sense. If we are lucky and help them
out with something, we might be able to get Godfather Han to bless
us. If that happens, I can become deified too. Then, I can join the
god fights and become very famous. What should I call myself? Space
Garden… Cow God! What do you guys think of that name?”</p>
<p>Many ordinary creatures kept talking about this. Many of them
wanted to ally with Space Garden, but Space Garden was completely
cut off. No one was able to go in, so no creature was able to
join.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen bring so many scary deifieds there, the
group of Flower Gods felt very conflicted.</p>
<p>Many powerful deified elites were sitting there. They could
guarantee the safety of Space Garden, and they could hunt many of
the plant xenogeneics to ensure a steady stream of geno fluids.</p>
<p>Because there were so many deified elites there, it made the
Flower Gods feel a bit worried. They were afraid of their genes
being too inferior. They thought it might lead to Han Sen and the
others abandoning them because they were not successful in being
able to reach deified.</p>
<p>They were also hoping that one day, Han Sen could give the
Flower Gods some blessings to become deified.</p>
<p>The races that had the power to capture Han Sen were all trying
to find a way to gain access to Space Garden.</p>
<p>They were interested in the resources available in Space Garden
too. Their main interest was Han Sen. If they were able to choose
between Space Garden and Han Sen, they would select Han Sen without
a shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>That was especially true of the Very High. They wanted to get
Han Sen back. They were afraid of the curse that was believed to
plague Han Sen. They did not want to risk it coming true. The Very
High were also scared of Space Garden’s performance. As Han Sen
grew stronger, the more upset they felt.</p>
<p>Many creatures of the universe were looking for Holy Pirate
since he was the only one who could enter Space Garden without
approval. Even the Pirates themselves were searching for Holy
Pirate. It seemed as if Holy Pirate had truly disappeared.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate was feeling very sad. He was being sneaky and
feeling scared as he traveled around Extreme King.</p>
<p>He had promised Han Sen that he would save him from the Extreme
King. After a few attempts, there was no chance of him succeeding.
Therefore, he gave up.</p>
<p>As soon as the geno god list started and Space Garden had
stirred up such a big incident, even Holy Pirate himself had become
a target of the universe.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Holy Pirate was very good at running. If he wasn’t,
he would have been caught already.</p>
<p>Although his name possessed the word “holy,” there was nothing
holy about the man. He was just a runner in the universe. The
universe was big, and there was nowhere he couldn’t really go. Even
the Very High’s Outer Sky was a place he could enter easily. He
could steal from the Very High too. That was, after all, how he had
become famous in the universe in the first place.</p>
<p>Outsiders did not know he stole things. He only played with the
things he stole and quickly returned them to the Very High just as
they were when he took them. If he did not do that, they would not
let him get away so easily.</p>
<p>In regard to fighting, Holy Pirate did not think he could go up
against the best of the Very High or Extreme King. They were all
top-class deifieds.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate was getting chased by the old antiques, and he had
to hide. He went to the Extreme King. He was planning to take Han
Sen back so Han Sen would take him to Space Garden. With Han Sen,
he could control Space Garden, which was the perfect place for a
den for thieves. It was not too bad being a king.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate’s power enabled him to ignore many of the security
defenses of the Extreme King. He finally reached King’s Garden,
where Han Sen was.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate knew there was a guy called Holy Baby there. It was
Bai King’s student. When he looked into the garden, there was no
sign of Han Sen. He saw a girl. She was sitting in the garden
quietly watching the geno god list fight.</p>
