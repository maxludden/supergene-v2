<p>Han Sen quietly tracked the gang and saw they had set up a tent and made a fire.</p>

<p>Gu was tied up and Han Sen had not found any good opportunities to rescue him.</p>

<p>As Son of Heaven’s gang were about to finish eating, Han Sen thought if Gu was tortured again, the big guy would probably be useless even if rescued.</p>

<p>Having an idea, Han Sen summoned Meowth and ordered it to run toward the other side and roar at the gang.</p>

<p>&#8220;A creature!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s a sacred-blood creature!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not let it run away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knife and Baldy stay, we will go hunt that sacred-blood creature,&#8221; ordered Son of Heaven, leaving two guys watching the camp and Gu, while he chased the sacred-blood three-eyed cat with the rest.</p>

<p>Running, Son of Heaven instructed, &#8220;Spread out and circle around it. We could not go far since it’s dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing the gang running away, Han Sen summoned the wings and shapeshifted into bloody slayer, flying toward the camp in darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy, incoming!&#8221; shouted Knife when Han Sen was 30 feet from the camp.</p>

<p>Baldy quickly summoned a mutant beast soul spear and watched Han Sen closely. Knife also summoned his pair of daggers.</p>

<p>Han Sen was in their face in no more than the blink of an eye. Holding the Shura katana, Han Sen whacked it at Baldy.</p>

<p>This strike from above was swift and powerful, but Baldy raised his spear with two hands and tried to block it.</p>

<p>The Shura katana cut into the spear deeply, and Baldy’s legs were forced into the sand by Han Sen’s terrifying strength.</p>

<p>When Baldy thought that he had warded off the strike, his spear broke.</p>

<p>Baldy wanted to go back, but his legs were still in the sand and there was no way to run. Another katana strike cut Baldy in half.</p>

<p><em>Ding!</em> <em>Ding!</em></p>

<p>Two daggers were shot at Han Sen and mercilessly nailed in the gaps on the elbow part of his armor. To kill Baldy, Han Sen had no time to dodge.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these two daggers were only mutant beast souls. Although they were swift enough, they were still stuck before they could cut deeper. Otherwise, Han Sen’s arms would have been disabled.</p>

<p>After killing Baldy, Han Sen turned to deal with Knife, who immediately started running at an incredible speed, not leaving any chance for Han Sen to approach him.</p>

<p>Shouting while running, Knife managed to alert Son of Heaven and the rest of the gang.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not chase him, but lifted Gu who was tied up and ran away with all four hooves of the bloody slayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollar, you son of a bitch! If you are a man, fight me one-on-one,&#8221; cursed Son of Heaven behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is more like one gang on one person,&#8221; said Han Sen full of disdain, running at full speed.</p>

<p>The gang thought that lifting a big man like Gu must slow Han Sen down and they could eventually catch up. But suddenly, a black three-eyed tiger appeared next to Han Sen and he simply lay Gu on the tiger’s back. The bloody slayer and the tiger disappeared from their sight in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why would that sacred-blood creature help Dollar?&#8221; The gang members were confused.</p>

<p>Son of Heaven finally understood, &#8220;Damn, that is not a sacred-blood creature. It is a sacred-blood beast soul pet! That motherf*#er had fed a sacred-blood pet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone was shocked. A sacred-blood pet must have cost so much advanced creature meat to transform.</p>

<p>After chasing for a while, the gang gave up. In fact, when they found out that the tiger was a sacred-blood pet, they had lost confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he make a sacred-blood pet transform? Did he use sacred-blood creature meat to feed his pet?&#8221; Everyone was shocked by the fact that Dollar had a transformed sacred-blood pet, which implied incredible power of him.</p>

<p>Han Sen ran for a while and shapeshifted back after losing the gang. He put Gu on the ground and cut loose the ropes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollar?&#8221; Gu recognized him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend, how much do you think your life is worth?&#8221; asked Han Sen.</p>

<p>Gu was suddenly taken aback, &#8220;You also want my sacred-blood sledgehammer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily that beast soul, but I did save you. You do not mean to say the risks I took are for nothing, right?&#8221; said Han Sen.</p>

<p>Gu did not speak and cast an odd look at Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now you have nothing but injuries. Can you leave Devil Desert alone safely? If you pay me properly, I can get you back to the shelter,&#8221; Han Sen continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I believe in you?&#8221; asked Gu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have any other choice?&#8221; Han Sen laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except for the sacred-blood sledgehammer, you can pick from all the other beast souls I have. But you have to take me to the shelter first,&#8221; said Gu, wiping blood off his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother Gu, is it?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Gu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call me Gu Ming, or whatever you like. I will not hear Brother Gu ever again.&#8221; Gu Ming gnashed the teeth in anger.</p>

<p>Han Sen smiled, &#8220;OK. Now you have two options. One is to go out on your own, and the other is to pay up front. There is no other options. I am not Son of Heaven and will keep my promises. If you pay me two mutant beast souls, I could promise to get you back to the shelter alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gu Ming looked Han Sen up and down and summoned several beast souls. &#8220;The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I know you and Son of Heaven are enemies, so I believe you. Here are all my mutant beast souls. Take your pick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hen Sen glanced at them and pointed twice. &#8220;This one is my reward for saving you, and that one is the price to take you back to the shelter.&#8221;</p>
