<p>“Found it… I finally found it… So many people died… We finally
found it…”</p>
<p>In a very dark underground cave, an underground river led to a
waterfall. It had a very deep drop. A booming sound echoed to the
very bottom of the water.</p>
<p>If one looked closer, one would see that the underground river’s
water was red. Bloody dragons roaring. All in all, there were nine
of them.</p>
<p>Eight people wearing rugged clothing stood next to the water.
They stared into the water. All of them seemed to be extremely
excited. As they stood there, their bodies shivered and shook.</p>
<p>“Mister Yang, what is that thing in the water?” A middle-aged
man looked at an elderly fellow with white hair. His vocal cords
were trembling as he asked the question.</p>
<p>The elder, who was called Mister Yang, looked around. He looked
for a while and said, “This is certainly the place where the blood
dragon returned to its nest. It is a place where the pulse is loud
and clear. There is no doubting it. There truly must be a top-class
gene egg inside there. The only thing I do not know is if it truly
is the gene egg King Qin buried and the one that we are searching
for. I have no idea, but you will have to figure that out for
yourself, Mister Meng.” “I have faith. This has to be the right
place. This must be where King Qin buried the gene egg. The gene
egg must be in the water. Hurry up, go in there and pick up the
gene egg.” Mister Meng saw the red light under the waterfall’s red
basin, so hurried the others to go take a dunk and see precisely
what it was.</p>
<p>The people were a bit scared. With Mister Meng’s authority, they
had no choice but to jump into the blood pool. They swam to the red
light below the surface of the basin. Only Mister Meng and Mister
Yang stood away and watched the pool.</p>
<p>Not long later, the six people emerged from the water. Together,
they exited the pool and brought forth the fabled item they had
been in search of. It was a giant egg that was three-feet big.</p>
<p>When the egg-shaped item was brought out of the basin, the
water’s light disappeared. Only the egg remained glowing with a red
light. The giant egg was like a bloody jade. It looked good.</p>
<p>Seeing the weirdly pretty, big egg, everyone looked at it with
greedy obsession. Mister Meng was so excited that he started
talking nonsense. “This must be right. This is the gene egg. King
Qin was born with bad blood. He was bullied when he was young. His
sister Wan’er had very special blood that provided immeasurable
talent. To help her brother, Wan’er gave King Qin her own blood.
Then, they created the Qin Kingdom. But Wan’er lost her blood and
became rubbish that could not practice. She got ill and died. If
Wan’er had not lost her blood, she would have never become sick.
King Qin blamed himself for that. He was miserable. It drove him
absolutely crazy. He tried everything to make Wan’er come back to
life. Everyone knew the Qin Kingdom was searching for immortality,
but people never knew that it was not for himself. He did this for
his dead sister Wan’er. King Qin found this legendary, top-class
gene egg. He was hoping the gene power could make Wan’er come back
to life.”</p>
<p>“But their people could not come back to life. Wan’er was unable
to be brought back to life. Without Wan’er, the entire world seemed
to be pointless to King Qin. He threw away the gene egg. My
ancestors were royal guards for King Qin. They knew that King Qin
wanted to revive Wan’er here in this ancient, big god mountain. He
knew that King Qin did not take the gene egg and never returned to
this place again. Our ancestors did not really know where it was
exactly though. After all, many generations have passed, and all
those people died. I have finally found this gene egg. With this
gene egg… The Meng family will become very famous…” After finishing
talking, Mister Meng laughed. “Argh…” Before Mister Meng could put
an end to his cackling, someone in the team screamed horribly. Soon
after, it was not just a single person letting out cries. Each of
the six people that had collected the gene egg from the bloody
basin was on the ground screaming and rolling in tremendous
agony.</p>
<p>Mister Meng and Mister Yang were in shock by what was happening.
People were writhing across the ground. Their bodies were rolling
really quickly. They kept going on and on until they melted into
blood water.</p>
<p>“Mister… Save… Save us…” A few people reached out their hands.
They were feeling extreme pain. They wanted to ask Mister Meng for
help. Before they finished, they died.</p>
<p>Their bones started to rot and become liquid. Within the blink
of an eye, the six of them had turned into six puddles of blood
water. There was not a single tuft of hair spared from the
dissolution of their bodies.</p>
<p>Mister Meng and Mister Yang were shocked by this. They tested
the river water and did not discover anything weird. For this to
happen so suddenly, it really was quite weird.</p>
<p>Mister Meng was glad he had not touched the water in the
pool.</p>
<p>“Mister Yang, please help me take the gene egg back,” Mister
Meng said to Mister Yang. Mister Yang’s face froze. He had a wry
smile. “Mister Meng, I am just a mister. I did not practice.”
Mister Meng’s eyes glistened as he said, “Do not worry, Mister
Yang. They died because they touched the blood water. The gene egg
by itself is fine. You do not need to worry.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang thought, “If it is fine, then why don’t you carry it
yourself?” Although he thought that, Mister Yang could not refuse.
Under Mister Meng’s watch, he had no choice but to carefully walk
toward the big red jade-like egg.</p>
<p>Although the big egg was clean and had no blood water on it,
Mister Yang did not attempt to touch it. He took off his clothes
and wrapped them around the big egg. He tied a knot and picked it
up. He was going to carry the big egg. When Mister Yang exerted
strength, a “katcha” noise was heard. The jade-like big egg
cracked. The crack was spreading across the egg’s shell.</p>
<p>Mister Yang and Mister Meng were shocked. After a second, Mister
Meng was excited. “God helped the Meng family. I never expected the
gene egg to hatch now. I wonder what creature this legendary gene
egg holds inside it.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang looked at the cracked gene egg and said, “King Qin
was the king of the Qin Kingdom. It was so long ago. Everything
about him was just a legend. If the legends are true, this gene egg
can hatch us a very rare gene</p>
<p>race.”</p>
<p>While they were talking, there was another “katcha” noise. The
big egg’s crack was spreading. The red jade-like eggshell fell onto
the floor in pieces.</p>
<p>Mister Yang and Mister Meng looked at the broken eggshell with
their eyes wide open. They were immediately frozen.</p>
<p>A man who looked about 20 years old was inside the eggshell. He
had black hair and crystal skin. He was curled up as if he had been
sleeping.</p>
<p>“Human… Humanoid… Gene race…” Mister Meng was so excited that
his voice trembled.</p>
