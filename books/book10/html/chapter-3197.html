<p>“Han Sen, why is it like this? Why am I now able to grab the
diamond great sword with the wooden sword in my hand? Why did it
approve of me?” Qin Bai looked at Han Sen with confusion.</p>
<p>“There is a solution to everything in this world. It all depends
on whether or not your solution is the correct one. This small,
wooden sword is one such method, but it can only help you claim an
ordinary weapon.” Han Sen was not going to tell him that the small
wooden sword’s sword mind was equal to Jian Bu Gu’s. There would
not be a sword that did not approve of Jian Bu Gu’s sword.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder why Bao’er could conquer so many emerald short
swords!” Qin Bai exclaimed with shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not going to tell him that Bao’er had not used the
short wooden sword. She did not need the wooden sword to do what
she did.</p>
<p>“I want to conquer the other weapons, so what will I have to do
to get those?” Qin Bai asked with curiosity. “Is there a small
wooden knife and a small wooden spear?”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “The way to sort this out is not just
using a small wooden sword. If you can find the right solution, you
can conquer any weapon. You can return the small wooden sword to
Bao’er now.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai returned the small wooden sword to Bao’er. The weapons
there were different from people. They did not think much. If the
diamond great sword had already been conquered, even if there was
no small wooden sword, it would not leave him.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He looked at a knife and pointed it out
to Qin Bai. He said, “Try and pick up that knife.”</p>
<p>“Do I just walk there and pick it up? Don’t I need to ready
myself in some way?” Qin Bai asked as he peered at the knife.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, long knife with a scabbard. The scabbard and
handle were encrusted with gems. It seemed to be brightly
twinkling. It was very shiny.</p>
<p>“Nope,” Han Sen said with certainty. “You don’t need anything.
You just need to go over there and pick it up. I promise you it
will obey</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Qin Bai did not believe him.</p>
<p>“Just try it. Are you going to learn the truth or chicken out?”
Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach were curious and looked at
the knife. They guessed what Han Sen was trying to do, but they did
not believe he was that smart.</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu smiled but did not speak. He quietly watched what was
happening.</p>
<p>Qin Bai was easily provoked, so he ran over and tried to pick up
the knife.</p>
<p>Qin Bai had merely touched the handle when a will came surging
out of the knife. It seemed like it was dying to enter his arm. It
was easily picked up without any resistance.</p>
<p>Seeing the knife happily circle Qin Bai in flight, it adhered to
Qin Bai’s own actions by jumping. It was not just Qin Bai who was
surprised. Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen were shocked too.
They understood something. They looked at Han Sen with
admiration.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, why is it like this?” Qin Bai curiously asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen replied, “Didn’t I tell you there is always a solution
to figuring things out? It all depends on whether or not you can
use those methods. The weapons did not approve of you because you
did not know yourself or understand them. You approached them in
the wrong way, which is why you failed.” “What is that supposed to
mean?” Qin Bai did not understand.</p>
<p>“To sort out these problems, you must first understand the type
of problem you have,” Han Sen said. “Your problem lies in your will
not being able to match the will of the weapons. That was why they
did not obey you. Your will matches with this knife’s will. Thus,
when you tried to draw it, the knife was willing to follow
you.”</p>
<p>“I see. In that case, how am I supposed to find out which knife
has a will that is similar to mine?” Qin Bai looked at Han Sen with
interest. He wanted to use his own power to discern which weapons
to select.</p>
<p>“You will have to use a weapon-watching skill,” Han Sen said
with a smile. “Thousand Mile Reach is an expert with this. You
should probably ask her.”</p>
<p>“I would not dare. I am much worse than you, Mister Han.”
Thousand Mile Reach spoke honesty. He would not try to lick his
boots.</p>
<p>The weapons were asleep, so the presence of their will was at a
minimum. Thousand Mile Reach could not find a suitable weapon for
Qin Bai to select based solely on gauging their appearances.</p>
<p>“Thousand Mile Reach, you should stop being so humble,” Qin Bai
said with great interest. “Just tell me which it is.”</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach felt touched. He had taught Qin Bai for many
years, and this was the first time he had ever seen Qin Bai want to
learn something. He really admired Han Sen.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen strangely looked at Han Sen. She was shocked by Han
Sen’s knowledge, power, and patience. It was no wonder he was able
to teach Qin Bai a sword mind in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen thought, “It is no wonder why Mister Jian is so
willing to follow him. Han Sen is very peculiar.”</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach kept walking, explaining the foundation of
weapon-watching skills to Qin Bai. Qin Bai listened very intently
and kept on asking questions. He asked about many things. Before
this day, it would have been an impossible concept for him to
fathom.</p>
<p>In the past, when Qin Bai had his lessons, he felt as if he was
in pain all the time. He felt as if he was locked up in prison. He
only answered things when he was asked for. He was like a robot
that did not learn much. He would never actively seek things out to
learn.</p>
<p>Han Sen really to teach Qin Bai. After all, this was the boy who
had become his friend after he arrived in the universe of kingdoms.
Han Sen would have liked to help him in any way he could. He did
not want to watch him fail as a king and end up destroying the Qin
Kingdom.</p>
<p>If one took things from a serious perspective, Qin Bai was an
heir of Qin Xiu. Han Sen’s body had some of Qin Xiu’s blood in it.
In some way, they were related by blood. But outsiders could not
really help much. If Qin Bai wanted to become a king, then it was
good. It all depended on whether or not he could be awakened.</p>
<p>“Mister Jian, where is Soldier Knife Sky’s god temple?” Han Sen
took a walk with Jian Bu Gu, who had been at the back of the
group.</p>
<p>“Go in that direction. Within 3,000 miles, you should be able to
espy the presence of that god temple.” Jian Bu Gu looked ahead. He
appeared as if he was longing for something as he said, “I wonder
if the sword is still there.”</p>
<p>“What sword?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>“There is a sword a mile from here,” Jian Bu Gu said. “Back in
the day, I was there when I was almost beaten. In the end, I was
unable to draw it. After all these years, I do not know if it is
still there or not.”</p>
<p>“If you were almost beaten by that sword, Mister Jian, I bet it
must be a magical item. Why don’t you lead us there to take a
look?” Han Sen was interested in the sword.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen were of a similar mind. Qin
Bai showed excitement too. He wanted to try the watching-weapon
skill he had just learned.</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu pointed in a certain direction, so the group traveled
that way. There was not a single human seen. Aside from weapons, it
was as if there was nothing else there.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>After walking for almost 10 miles, an explosion came from the
sky. The wind suddenly changed. The sky looked dark. It looked like
a storm was rolling in.</p>
