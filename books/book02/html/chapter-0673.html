    <p>
      Han Sen, Wang Yuhang, and Li Xinglun sat in a triangular formation in an
      ice cave. They placed the fist-sized Life Geno essence in the middle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang gulped, asking, &#8220;Is this really a Life Geno
      essence?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun could not believe what they had accomplished this day, and so
      he said, &#8220;Did we really kill a super creature? Are we the first to
      ever do so in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, are you going to sell the Life Geno essence? According to
      the contract I signed with you, I should receive a 30% cut of the
      proceeds. If you want, I&#8217;ll pay you the additional 70% and purchase
      it off you entirely,&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked, looking at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the contract that they had signed, it stated that Han Sen was to
      receive 50%, Wang Yuhang was to receive 30%, and Li Xinglun was to receive
      20%.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen decided that he didn&#8217;t want it, what happened with the
      Life Geno essence next fell to Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course I want it; I want super geno points,&#8221; Han Sen
      replied succinctly. There was no way he was going to pass up such a
      treasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang coughed and said, &#8220;Bossman, from what I have heard,
      after the Ji family obtained their own Life Geno essence, no progress was
      made. They tried everything they could, but they were unable to obtain
      super geno points. If you return with this in your possession, it will
      most likely yield the same result. If you want, sell it to me. Or
      foregoing that, provide it to me and the Wang estate. We can investigate
      its secrets on your behalf and see if we can learn how to obtain super
      geno points from the Life Geno essence.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Ji family&#8217;s Life Geno essence was never consumed?&#8221;
      Han Sen was surprised to hear this. He had assumed that Ji Qing had eaten
      the Life Geno essence a long time ago. He did not expect that they were
      still investigating how to obtain super geno points from the artifact, and
      couldn&#8217;t simply eat it straight away.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, they have tried a great many different ways of eating it but
      they were all to no avail. The Life Geno essence is like obsidian. It
      cannot be hewn in two, burnt, or drowned,&#8221; Wang Yuhang said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun then chimed in to say, &#8220;It is, indeed. I hacked into the
      Ji family&#8217;s system and perused their records. They have tried
      countless different methods, but they were all hopeless. They&#8217;re at
      their wits end, trying to figure out how they might gain super geno
      points. They even called upon professionals from the Alliance, but that
      was futile, too. Zero progress has been made. That is most likely why the
      Alliance has yet to make an announcement about the super creature and
      super geno points.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Did they try swallowing it?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They did. It was useless swallowing it, as well. It came out whole
      and was not digested in the slightest,&#8221; Li Xinglun said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen frowned when he heard this. This was different than what he knew
      about super geno points. He had just licked it and swallowed it whole. Why
      was Ji Qing&#8217;s different?
    </p>

    <p>
      But it was not impossible. After all, the other two he had managed to
      collect here in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary were inedible, too. They
      were different than the one he managed to get in the First God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If the Ji family&#8217;s Life Geno essence is unedible, then that
      is quite interesting,&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself. He believed there
      had to be a problem somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, consider it! Lend it to me and the Wang family will do
      their best to investigate it. I promise you; the moment a discovery is
      made, you will be the first to know!&#8221; Wang Yuhang said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is my first time getting a Life Geno essence, as well. How
      about you let me investigate it first? The share you deserve; do you want
      it now or next time?&#8221; Han Sen did not want to give it to the Wang
      family for research. But, if he really couldn&#8217;t figure out how to
      consume the item, then he might have to reconsider.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Save it for next time,&#8221; Wang Yuhang and Li Xinglun replied,
      simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      They didn&#8217;t have any particular lack of finance, so they
      weren&#8217;t willing to give up their share for money. And so, they
      decided to save it for next time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen brought the frosty bear&#8217;s Life Geno essence back to
      research. This Life Geno essence was cold, and a striking opposite to the
      Fire-Scale T-rex&#8217;s Life Geno essence. But because Han Sen had
      Jadeskin, he was not afraid of its cold aura.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was in his room. As he held it in his hands, he repeatedly licked
      it. But no matter how many times he tried, nothing happened. He licked and
      licked, but it did not melt.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I still can&#8217;t eat it. What gives? What must I do to make this
      essence become super geno points?&#8221; Han Sen held onto the Life Geno
      essence, continuing to observe it. &#8220;Is it like those western fantasy
      stories? Perhaps these are the cores of beasts? Do I have to practice the
      same element to absorb it?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Whilst holding onto the icy crystal, Han Sen began running Jadeskin. He
      once absorbed Xue Yikuang&#8217;s frosted air. If he needed the same
      element to absorb the Life Geno essence, then could the cold air of the
      crystal be absorbed by Jadeskin?
    </p>

    <p>
      But no matter how many times or ways Han Sen tried casting Jadeskin, there
      was no reaction. It couldn&#8217;t be absorbed or refined or anything.
      Nothing would happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is strange. For what reason is it like this? If the Ji family
      were unable to figure out this Life Geno essence, does that mean the First
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary and Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary are the same? But
      if so, how was I able to eat a Life Geno essence whilst I was in the First
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary? And why can Ji Qing not eat one, despite being in
      the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, too?&#8221; Han Sen just couldn&#8217;t
      wrap his head around it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen now really wanted people in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary to
      kill more super creatures, so he could find out whether or not others in
      the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary could eat a Life Geno essence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was researching the Life Geno essence, and the rumor of him
      potentially slaying a super creature began to spread. After all, there
      were many witnesses. And there were many factions privy to the knowledge
      of the existence of super creatures. They were starting to believe what
      Han Sen had killed was a super creature of the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen is a special man.&#8221; When the Wang family heard of this
      through Wang Yuhang, they were rightfully shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Han&#8217;s child is special indeed. He has only been in the
      Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary for just over a year. He actually killed a
      super creature there&#8230;&#8221; The Ning family heard this news, too.
      And they immediately took it as fact that Han Sen was the child of Han
      Jingzhi.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Ji family came forward first, damn it!&#8221; The Ji
      family&#8217;s competitors heard the news, believing Han Sen belonged to
      the Ji family.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the Ji family members were confused. They did not know what to make of
      the situation. Ji Yanran&#8217;s boyfriend did not have a background of
      any particular renown, or any important ties. Some people in the Ji family
      did not like Han Sen very much, but now there was a rumor making the
      rounds that he had killed a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, the Ji family did not believe it. After all, the Ji family had
      spent on a lot on providing Ji Qing what she needed to slay a super
      creature. They hired three hundred elite evolvers to help Ji Qing kill a
      super creature in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. It was a big price to
      pay to hunt a creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the rumor also stated that Han Sen pretty much took care of the super
      creature solo. And it was a super creature of the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, too; it was difficult to believe.
