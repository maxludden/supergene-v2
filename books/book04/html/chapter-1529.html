      Although they were still under Little Fairy’s protection, as they traveled
      deeper into the forest, the chill of the cold began to return, ever so
      slightly. Even Little Fairy was struggling to withstand the pressure of
      the freezing force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the cold air was held back, but some gusts managed to break
      through. Fortunately, Han Sen’s fitness was of high enough to resist it
      doing any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen continued to look around as he went. He had his Dongxuan Aura
      firing on all cylinders as he tried to find out what was watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frozen Forest was very strange. It was no wonder the area was a part
      of God’s Ruin. Despite giving it his all, Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura could
      only cover a hundred-meter radius. He couldn’t see anything beyond that.
      And furthermore, he was unable to see where something might have been
      watching from.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they traveled deeper into the forest, the sensation of being watched
      continued to increase. Han Sen kept a permanent frown on his face. It
      wasn’t a good thing to know you were being watched in such a perilous
      place as God’s Ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This area’s security is high, but surely nothing can stay here for very
      long,” Han Sen was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, Little Fairy quietly shouted, “Be careful! Something is up ahead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, Little Silver, and Starsea Beast looked over in the direction she
      was referring to. Something was moving through the Frozen Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dongxuan Aura wasn’t very helpful there, so Han Sen had to resort to
      his basic, no-frills eyesight. Now, he was seeing things like Little
      Silver did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since they were already there, it wasn’t as if there was a point in
      heading back, either. So, Han Sen looked at Little Fairy and continued
      walking. Unsure of what lay ahead, and wishing to find out, they exercised
      more caution as they moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, the shadow in the woods became clearer to them. It was a
      one-meter tall seahorse. Its body looked to be completely made of ice, and
      it wriggled as it floated by, as if it was swimming through the air. It
      was silent in its passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ice Seahorse saw the group, but it did not appear to be hostile. It
      just continued floating by, on its way to wherever it was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Daddy, look. Many seahorses. So beautiful.” Bao’er was pointing at the
      other side of the forest with a happy expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked over to where Bao’er was pointing, and he noticed there
      were twenty or thirty seahorses floating around in the same manner. The
      smallest one was only a meter tall, but there were others amidst them of
      various sizes. The tallest one they could see was four meters high. As the
      creatures bobbed forward, they looked almost funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seahorses looked very tame, and they all seemed to want to keep to
      themselves. Han Sen was curious about them, but his Dongxuan Aura had been
      stifled by God’s Ruin, so he couldn’t tell what power resided inside the
      seahorses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er laughed and jumped onto the back of one of the Ice Seahorses. She
      held onto its neck like it was an average mare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked by her actions, and he wished to call her back
      immediately. They did look tame, yes, but who knew if they would remain so
      docile after being provoked?
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy made a hushed call. Han Sen turned to look at her, and he
      noticed she was staring at something that was behind the Ice Seahorse. The
      expression on her face made it look as if she had seen a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked over there and was shocked, as well. Behind the Ice
      Seahorse was another bunch of seahorses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heads of these seahorses were bigger, and they were all at least four
      meters tall. Their bodies looked to have been made of black diamonds, and
      they looked hardier than steel. They were different from the other Ice
      Seahorses that the group had previously observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely, there was a chain as thick as a human’s arm wrapped around the
      Black Seahorse’s bodies. It looked like a steel chain, and there were many
      symbols engraved into the metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There weren’t many Black Seahorses, and Han Sen was able to count eleven
      of them. They all looked the same. They floated in the air, but they
      weren’t doing so as randomly as the other Ice Seahorses were. They were
      all aligned, traveling in perfect tandem with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the Black Seahorses, their chains all seemed to connect to
      something. It was a big, black chimenea that was eight meters tall. It
      looked like a tall black furnace. The chute had blue flames coming out of
      it, which were burning fiercely inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But strangely, Han Sen couldn’t feel any warmth coming from it. And when
      the chimenea came closer, they actually felt colder. It was as if it was
      releasing cold instead of heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong, icy force was getting stronger, and even with the shielding
      provided by Little Fairy, Han Sen felt extremely cold. Not even her
      control of the ice element was able to protect them from that abhorrent
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was trying their best to resist the cold with the power they had,
      but it didn’t seem to be working very well. Slowly, they were all
      beginning to freeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We should run and wait until the chimenea has passed! We can come back
      later,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy agreed, as did the others. They were all of the mind to
      vacate the area at once. But unfortunately, their bodies weren’t
      listening. Their legs were sheathed in a layer of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly, that ice was spreading across their bodies. None of them were
      able to move. They felt as if they were robots, only able to move a tiny
      amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Bao’er, who was sitting upon the back of an Ice Seahorse, was okay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was shocked by what was going on, so Han Sen summoned his God
      geno core. It spawned ruby wings behind him, and his whole being began to
      glow red.
    </p>
    <p>
      That power pushed the cold back outside of him and kept the icy force from
      affecting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to bring his companions away, too, in case something even
      worse was about to happen. But suddenly, they saw the Black Seahorses stop
      pulling the chimenea. Then, they all looked at Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he said, “Oh, no! Has my performance made them
      hostile to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Han Sen realized they weren’t looking at him; they were
      looking at Bao’er, who was back on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was not affected by the cold at all, and she sat on Han Sen’s
      shoulder, dangling her legs. She was checking out the Black Seahorses and
      their black chimenea.
