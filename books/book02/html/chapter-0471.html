    <p>
      Han Sen remained still, watching the unicorn beetle made of green crystal
      climbing out of the gaps made by Li Mingtang&#8217;s grenade.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unicorn beetle was the size of a fist. It did not climb fast, and the
      gap was not wide. It took the beetle some effort to climb to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compared with the golden Rubik&#8217;s cube and simulating crystals, this
      unicorn beetle was obviously quite clumsy. It was climbing slowly, and it
      seemed it could not fly either.
    </p>

    <p>
      After climbing for a short distance, the horn of the beetle clashed with a
      statute. The little thing was so dumb that it did not even know how to
      turn. Struggling with its feet, it tried to move forward. However, its
      strength was obviously minimal so that it could not move the statue at
      all. The beetle looked like a toy car going around in circles.
    </p>

    <p>
      After some observation, Han Sen found that this guy was both dumb and
      weak. It could not be compared to the golden Rubik&#8217;s cube at all and
      did not seem that dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought about it and climbed out of the ear of the statute,
      throwing a crystal near the unicorn beetle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Startled by the sound, the unicorn beetle forgot about the statue it was
      trying to move, turned around and climbed toward the crystal that had
      fallen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shortly, it touched the crystal which was only slightly bigger than a
      fist. Using its horn to leverage the crystal, the unicorn beetle only
      managed to shake the crystal slightly and failed to move it away.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Among the stuff manufactured by Crystallizers, there is something
      so useless?&#8221; Han Sen was surprised. He walked over to the unicorn
      beetle, grabbed its shell and lifted it up. Like a turtle that was lying
      on its back, the unicorn beetle moved its feet around yet failed to touch
      anything. It was indeed very weak and could not get out of Han Sen&#8217;s
      hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This must be a pet made by Crystallizers?&#8221; Han Sen examined
      the beetle carefully. This pet was carved with the mysterious patterns of
      Crystallizers, similar to the ones on the black crystal gate, looking like
      the guts of a mechanical watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen touched the feet of the unicorn beetle with his finger, which was
      grabbed by the beetle immediately. However, it did not have much force.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grabbing Han Sen&#8217;s finger, the unicorn beetle came to the back of
      his hand. Holding Han Sen&#8217;s wrist, the beetle chirped at Han Sen
      twice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw that the beetle was completely useless, so he left it alone
      and walked to the gaps made by the grenade explosion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Mingtang&#8217;s grenade must be specially made. It&#8217;s broke the
      crystal floor and made a foot-long crack. Han Sen looked down the crack
      and was pleasantly surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was an oval chamber down the crack, with a dozen purple crystals inside
      it. Han Sen had seen this type of crystals before, which was the one that
      Ji Yanran had used on him, the crystal that could enhance brain
      development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to go down for those crystals, but he had no tools on him.
      This was, after all, just a doppelgänger. Afraid that the doppelgänger
      would be destroyed by the researchers, Han Sen did not leave any beast
      souls with it in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the strength of the beetle knight, it was not realistic for him to
      widen the crack. Han Sen had to stay put and wait for his own body and Ji
      Yanran to come over. At that time, he would think of some ways to take the
      crystals out from the chamber underneath.
    </p>

    <p>
      His own body and Ji Yanran were still a bit far away from his
      doppelgänger, so Han Sen the doppelgänger sat down and started to play
      with the unicorn beetle on his hand. This guy looked quite pretty yet
      incredibly clumsy. It was quite fun to play with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran followed the doppelgänger&#8217;s route. Han Sen
      told Ji Yanran about what had happened and took her over.
    </p>

    <p>
      He also described the looks of the unicorn beetle to Ji Yanran, but she
      did not know what it was either. Her guess was also that it can be a
      Crystallizers' toy or something like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      After seeing his doppelgänger, Han Sen seized the unicorn beetle and took
      the beetle knight back to his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Products of Crystallizers generally have some unique functions. The
      golden Rubik&#8217;s cube you just described was in fact a guard crystal.
      It could shoot light sabers that easily slice warframes apart, let alone
      human bodies. Unless someone was fast enough to escape before it started
      to use light sabers, there was no other way to go past it. Seemingly
      useless stuff like this is indeed quite rare in Crystallizer ruins.&#8221;
      Ji Yanran observed the unicorn beetle and did not see anything special
      about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is a Crystallizer product after all. Even if it is a toy, it is
      quite unique. I believe I can make some money if I take it back?&#8221;
      Looking at the unicorn beetle, all Han Sen could see was dollars.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Many collectors are very into Crystallizer products. If you find
      the right person, it could be worth a lot,&#8221; Ji Yanran nodded and
      said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then I will keep it first.&#8221; Han Sen put the unicorn beetle
      into a pocket and walked over to the gap. He then turned on his super
      biological warframe to widen the gap. After 20+ minutes, the gap was wide
      enough for a person to go down, so Han Sen put away the warframe and
      crawled inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no other things in the room than the purple crystals. Han Sen
      picked them up one by one and counted sixteen in excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran told him before that although the crystals called brain crystals
      by human could be spotted in a lot of Crystallizer ruins, the number was
      not huge.
    </p>

    <p>
      In smaller ruins, it would be lucky to find one or two brain crystals.
      Sometimes there was none.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even in larger ruins, it would be impressive to find 7 to 8 brain
      crystals. Human history, the most brain crystals they ever found in a ruin
      were 100+, which shocked the entire Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact that there were sixteen brain crystals in this place was
      definitely something huge.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you want to take these brain crystals for yourself, you will
      have to use them right here. Otherwise, they would be spotted in the
      scanning process before you board Daphne,&#8221; Ji Yanran told Han Sen,
      seeing how excited her boyfriend was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then let&#8217;s use them. We will each use half. For better, for
      worse.&#8221; Han Sen said and split the brain crystals into two portions,
      taking eight for himself and giving eight to Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Ji Yanran did not plan to take the crystals. Listening to Han
      Sen, she was happy to take the eight crystals and said, &#8220;We could
      only use one in twelve hours, otherwise the extra stimulation to the
      brains would cause a small problem.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen nodded and put a brain crystal on his forehead. Suddenly, he felt
      an electric current flowing into his brain and the brain crystal broke.
