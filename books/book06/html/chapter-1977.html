<p>After killing the Xuanyuan Dragon, the crew left Xuanyuan Cave.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t feel very well, and First Day and Yun Sushang were injured. They couldn’t keep going. They also had to carry out the dead bodies of the Xuanyuan Dragon and Ghost Claw Beasts.</p>

<p>The Xuanyuan Dragon’s body was very useful, and it also had xenogeneic genes. They didn’t want to waste it.</p>

<p>Han Sen cut open the Xuanyuan Dragon’s head under Thousand Feather Crane’s supervision. He took out a brain orb, which was the xenogeneic gene of this creature.</p>

<p>The brain orb was around the size of a fist. It looked like a black crystal. The strangest thing was that there was a Xuanyuan Dragon with wings inside it.</p>

<p>When Han Sen obtained the brain orb, an announcement played.</p>

<p>“Obtained Marquise Mutant xenogeneic gene. Insufficient Marquise genes. Cannot refine.”</p>

<p>Han Sen was surprised, and he thought, “What does that mean? Will absorbing that mutant gene require other genes as some sort of base?”</p>

<p>Han Sen put away the brain orb for the moment. He gathered up the other spoils and left the cave alongside the others.</p>

<p>“Han Sen, which geno art did you use on the Xuanyuan Dragon? You made it unable to move. That is something extremely powerful,” Yun Suyi said to Han Sen as they walked.</p>

<p>“It is a geno art that is used to reduce the speed of enemies. It is called Turtle,” Han Sen answered.</p>

<p>Hearing that name, Yun Suyi and the others looked surprised. Yun Suyi smiled and said, “This name is good. And you really did turn the Xuanyuan Dragon into a turtle.”</p>

<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the others were shocked. They didn’t expect a skill used to reduce speed could be that effective. It wasn’t an ordinary geno art, that was for sure.</p>

<p>After a short discussion, Han Sen sold the Xuanyuan Dragon to Yun Sushang. Yun Sushang called her people over from the shop to come and claim it.</p>

<p>Han Sen was only going to take the xenogeneic genes of the dragon and a few of the Ghost Claw Beasts with him. Then, he rode his legless bird back to his island.</p>

<p>On his way home, Han Sen looked at his new beast soul.</p>

<p>Ghost Claw Beast: Weapon</p>

<p>Han Sen summoned the Ghost Claw beast soul. It was indeed a weapon, and it looked very similar to the Ghost Claws.</p>

<p>Ghost Claw had a three-foot-long handle with a clawlike blade on the end. He wasn’t quite sure what kind of weapon it was.</p>

<p>He put away the Ghost Claw blade and summoned the mutant Xuanyuan beast soul.</p>

<p>Mutant Xuanyuan Dragon: Flying type</p>

<p>After Han Sen summoned it, he felt rather depressed. He had thought he would grow awesome wings behind him, but that wasn’t the case. When he summoned it, it wasn’t as intimidating as the black wings that had grown from the dragon’s back. Instead, a small pair of Xuanyuan wings spawned near Han Sen’s ears.</p>

<p>They weren’t broad wings; they were just a pair of small ear wings. They looked beautiful, but Han Sen did not think they would be very useful at all.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried flying with the wings, and it worked. They were very fast. They were almost as good as the rabbit shoes.</p>

<p>The rabbit shoes only increased his movement speed on the ground. They did not improve his flying speed. The dragon wings would improve his speed in the air, so they were very suitable for Sky Palace. This beast soul could turn out to be very useful.</p>

<p>There might be times he would have to fight while in the air. He couldn’t just use rabbit shoes to fight then, and so having the dragon wings would make things easier.</p>

<p>But when he used the dragon wings, he did look rather funny.</p>

<p>Han Sen melted the Ghost Claw Beast genes, and then he drank the broth. He felt the power spread through his body. He felt cold, as if he was being washed in a rush of cold water.</p>

<p>“Earl Xenogeneic Genes +1”</p>

<p>Han Sen had nine xenogeneic materials in total, from the Ghost Claw Beasts. After he ate them, he ended up with nine xenogeneic gene points.</p>

<p>Mutant Xuanyuan Dragon’s xenogeneic gene, however, could not be melted. Thus, Han Sen couldn’t eat it. It was just as the announcement had said; Han Sen did not have enough Marquise genes, so he couldn’t refine the mutant xenogeneic gene.</p>

<p>Han Sen rested for the night, and then there was nothing to do the next day, either. White Jade Jing had not opened yet, so there was no need to go there. As a result, he had nothing to do. So, he planned to go and kill xenogeneics inside Xuanyuan Cave again—this time, alone. He wanted to fill up his Earl gene tallies so that his geno arts would have an easier time breaking through.</p>

<p>Han Sen rode the legless crane to Xuanyuan Cave. He left it outside and entered the cave alone.</p>

<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the others hadn’t come, so Han Sen only had to worry about himself. He used his rabbit shoes to run deep into the cave at a speedy pace.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because the rabbit shoes were too fast, but the Xuan Jade Spirits did not make an appearance. He ran for three hours. He ran past where they killed the Xuanyuan Dragon, and there was still no sign of any xenogeneics.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t dare slow down, as he wanted to draw out whatever creatures he could. He met some people hunting xenogeneics; people from Sky Palace. They were in a group, and only Han Sen had entered alone.</p>

<p>When the Sky Palace students saw Han Sen running around by himself, they were shocked.</p>

<p>Xuan Jade Spirits could appear at random, so it was dangerous to venture inside alone. When students came there to hunt, they would always bring a partner. It was rare to see something like Han Sen venturing inside all alone.</p>

<p>As Han Sen walked forward, he didn’t see any Xuan Jade Spirits, but he heard a voice calling for help from deeper inside the cave.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked in that direction and saw a Sky man running toward him. There was an ant behind him with a head as big as a cat.</p>

<p>Han Sen summoned Spell. She lifted her sniper rifle and fired a bullet, blowing the xenogeneic’s head off from a few hundred meters away.</p>

<p>“Xenogeneic Viscount hunted. Jade Ant: xenogeneic gene found.”</p>

<p>“Run!” The Sky man came running, shouting at Han Sen as he came.</p>

<p>“Why run? It’s dead,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>The Sky man continued running, and he cried out, “It’s not just one. There are many!”</p>

<p>“How many?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“Many! Many! Run!” The Sky man ran past Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not ask anything further, as he saw Jade Ants pouring out of the cavern behind the Sky man. There were too many to count.</p>

<p>“That is a lot!” Han Sen was not scared. Instead, he was happy. His eyes turned bright.</p>

<p>Without Han Sen even needing to issue a command, Spell swapped her sniper rifle for an RPG. She placed the rocket launcher on her shoulder, put herself into position, and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>A rocket shot out and slammed into the center of the horde of ants.</p>
