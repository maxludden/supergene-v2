<h2>Abandoning the Fight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2127</h3>

<p>On the day Dollar and Lone Bamboo were supposed to fight, a
great number of elites turned their attention to the match. They
focused on it more than they did any of the King fights.</p>
<p>“Who do you think will win?”</p>
<p>“I think Lone Bamboo will be the one to win. Sky Palace is not
just any faction, you know. And Lone Bamboo is the absolute best
Marquise they have. Ordinary Marquises cannot hope to compete
against the likes of him. And while Dollar is indeed quite strong,
his talents are too simple. Aside from his sturdy body and his
Dollar, there does not appear to be anything else too significant
about him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. With the few techniques that Dollar possesses, it is
highly unlikely he’ll be able to reign supreme. An elite like Lone
Bamboo cannot find themselves defeated by just one measly geno art.
He’s just too strong.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that Dollar isn’t hiding extra geno arts that
we have yet to see?”</p>
<p>The bout was hotly debated, and before long, the Geno Being
Scroll shone in the sky. As soon as it did, contestants were
teleported into it.</p>
<p>“Lone Bamboo, let’s have a real fight!” Han Sen appeared in the
middle of the desert. He looked ahead of him, trying to spy his
opponent, but he could not see Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He had come to know Lone Bamboo well, and he
was most certainly not the type of person that would hide. If he
had a fight to attend, he would ensure that he was there promptly
to engage his opponent.</p>
<p>He looked around but could see no sign of Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>The viewers were confused by this. They keenly examined the
environment, but they couldn’t see any sign of Lone Bamboo
either.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the space around Han Sen distorted, sending him back
out of the Geno Being Scroll with his sheet of paper still
intact.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly realized what had transpired. Lone Bamboo had
decided not to attend the battle, and so Han Sen had been
automatically declared the victor.</p>
<p>Everyone was extremely shocked by this unexpected turn of
events. This bout had been highly anticipated by all, and it never
came about. Instead, Lone Bamboo had decided to throw in the towel
without even trying.</p>
<p>Rumors started to spread like wildfire throughout the universe.
There were whispers that Dollar himself was one of the Sky, and
that was why his peer Lone Bamboo had decided against fighting
him.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of other rumors, too, stating that Dollar had
struck a political deal with the head honchos of the Sky. Because
of these deals, the conspiracy theorists claimed, Lone Bamboo had
stayed away from the contest.</p>
<p>Even wilder were the numerous theories on how Dollar was in a
romantic relationship with Lone Bamboo, and that Lone Bamboo
forfeited so their love could go on.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not pay heed to any of these rumors, but he found
himself in quite worried. It wasn’t like Lone Bamboo to abandon a
fight. He had never done this before. Something must have happened
to stop him from attending the fight.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to call Yisha and let her know that he was safe.
After doing that, he contacted Sky Palace to let them know the same
thing. He also asked about Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>What he heard made him frown, though. He was told that Sky
Palace itself had no clue why Lone Bamboo hadn’t participated in
the bout. They said that he had been away for a few days and had
yet to return. Sky Palace had lost all contact with him.</p>
<p>The strangest thing, however, was that a spy had been discovered
at Lone Bamboo’s house. The spy was a Sky, but there was no record
of him in Sky Palace’s records. It was as if he had come out of
nowhere.</p>
<p>“What happened, I wonder?” Han Sen frowned. He knew something
bad must have happened to Lone Bamboo. And it was dire to learn
that Sky Palace could not find him or pick up the slightest trail
that might lead to his whereabouts.</p>
<p>After Han Sen’s discussion with the Sky Palace leader, Han Sen
told him his own story. He said that he would return to Sky Palace
by himself, and that there was no need for a pickup to be arranged
on his behalf.</p>
<p>On a primal planet, Evil Eye was sitting on a rock. He was
fishing on the banks of a gentle stream. The little girl was
sitting next to him, cradling her jaw and watching the water of the
river.</p>
<p>There was a tug on the line, and Evil Eye pulled the fishing rod
back and yanked the fish out of the water.</p>
<p>“Lunch.” Evil Eye smiled at the little girl.</p>
<p>The little girl smiled at Evil Eye, but after she glanced up at
him, she looked startled. She pointed at him and said, “Blood!”</p>
<p>Evil Eye frowned and wiped his forehead. His third eye, which
was currently closed, had started to bleed.</p>
<p>“This guy doesn’t know how to quit.” Evil Eye wiped the blood
from his brow and sneered.</p>
<p>“Did you completely absorb his body and power?” the little girl
asked, still reeling from the shock.</p>
<p>“I did combine myself with his body and power, but…” Evil Eye
trailed off.</p>
<p>“But what?” the little girl asked.</p>
<p>“His will is too strong. There is nothing I can do to dampen it.
I suppose it will just take some time.” Evil Eye shrugged his
shoulders, and then went on to say, “But that’s fine. His body and
power belong to me, and that’s the bottom line. The struggling of
his willpower is pointless. It’ll be crushed eventually.”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s a shame.” The little girl went back to watching
the stream with her jaw cradled in her hands.</p>
<p>Everyone thought Lone Bamboo’s decision to quit was strange, but
the Geno Being Scroll’s ranking went on without pause. Every tier
had now been whittled down to the top sixteen fighters.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Yisha, Littleflower, and Xie Qing King had reached that
last stage. They all just occupied different tiers.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s last couple fights wouldn’t be too difficult. He had a
strong body and Dollar. He beat one of the Destroyed and leaped
straight to number eight.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too difficult for Littleflower or Yisha, either.
Neither of them had any trouble to contend with, and it was all
smooth sailing.</p>
<p>But Xie Qie King did not fare as well. He found himself in a lot
of trouble. His opponent was also one of the Destroyed, and that
Earl Destroyed had a reputation that was not far off Lone
Bamboo’s.</p>
<p>Destroyed and the Sky were amongst the top ten higher races, so
even their Earl class members were incredibly strong.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King used his silver book to replicate the shape and
form of the Destroyed Earl, but try as he might, he could not block
the monster’s attacks. And any additional xenogeneics he spawned
were swiftly annihilated by the Destroyed Earl.</p>
<p>The Destroyed Earl had three heads and six arms. He wielded
light, dark, and chaos powers. His body was about the same strength
that Han Sen’s had been when he was an Earl. His geno arts were
quite scary, too. Xie Qing King’s drawing powers were useless
against him.</p>
<p>“That Xie Qing King is not too shabby. He is much inferior to
Earl Odoga, though.”</p>
<p>“His geno armament is a strange one, that’s for sure. And it
seems as if it’s not enough to defeat Odoga.”</p>
<p>“It looks like Odoga will top the Earl class rankings.”</p>
<p>The people that watched the Earl fights could tell that Xie Qing
King was in a dire situation.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>A powerful punch from Odoga destroyed Xie Qing King’s latest
drawing, then continued on towards his face. When the punch landed,
Xie Qing’s King and the silver book were sent soaring into a
mountainside. The resulting avalanche brought half of the mountain
down.</p>
<p>“That’s it.” Xie Qing King pulled himself out of the rubble. A
grin split his bloody mouth.</p>
<p>He stopped drawing and threw the book away, then plated his body
in a set of armor.</p>
<p>“You want to keep this fight up?” Odoga looked at him like a
disappointed instructor.</p>
<p>“This fight has only just begun.” Xie Qing King bared his teeth,
and a silver light came beaming out of him like a volcano. When Xie
Qing King put down his book, he revealed just how cruel he could
be.</p>
