<p>Han Sen thought Night Cry Valley would not have had any people
there for that place had eight sound bugs. The area had no land
pulses, and eight sound bugs were difficult to catch. No one should
have been there.</p>
<p>Shortly after Han Sen entered the valley, he saw a woman. Her
face was covered with a green veil. She was sitting atop a large
rock in Night Cry Valley. Her eyes were closed. It looked as if she
was resting.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw her face and understood she was there to capture
eight sound bugs too. The eight sound bugs only appeared in the
valley at night. She was obviously waiting for dark.</p>
<p>He believed no one should have been there, and so did the woman.
She was just as surprised to see Han Sen arrive.</p>
<p>Although he could not see her face, and she was wearing a very
large robe that hid her body shape, her eyes looked like autumn
water. People were bound to believe that she was a very pretty
person.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Maybe it’s just her eyes that look good.
Perhaps the rest of her face is ugly and weird. I don’t see another
reason as to why she might be hiding her face.” If Han Sen knew who
that woman was, he would have understood why she did her face as
she such.</p>
<p>She was one of the three big idols in the Big Qin Kingdom. She
was called Feng Fei Fei, and she was titled the Phoenix Singer. In
the Big Qin Kingdom, she was very famous. She had many fans. If she
did not hide her face when she went out, there would be traffic
everywhere.</p>
<p>The Big Qin Kingdom’s idols were not ordinary stars or
celebrities. Back in the day, King Qin’s singer Zhong Li Qing sung
one song and scared off Zhao Kingdom’s 10 battleships that sought
to invade Planet Chimo. It was the strongest one back then.</p>
<p>Of course, that was because Zhong Li Qing had the ultimate gene
race called absolute sound. The three big idols were not as famous
as Zhong Li Qing, but they were only a little away from being that
widely known. They were all elites who had god class sonic-element
gene races. They were not just some singers or stars.</p>
<p>In the universe of kingdoms, without the aid of powerful gene
races, one was not able to reach the top in any way. Every
professions’ top-class people made the scariest elites.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei had come to Night Cry Valley for an eight sound
bug. The eight sound bugs that had already hatched could not be
perfectly tamed, but they could be used to create gene medicine
that could moisturize the throat. For a singer, that was very good
stuff.</p>
<p>Of course, at Feng Fei Fei’s level, any ordinary eight sound bug
would not suit her. Before, she heard about Night Cry Valley
possessing a rare, mutant eight sound bug. She wanted to have a
look around and check out the validity of the claim. So, she came
to Night Cry Valley in search of that special eight sound bug.
Seeing Han Sen arrive in Night Cry Valley, Feng Fei Fei was not too
bothered. Even if Han Sen was there to catch eight sound bugs, she
did not believe he had the chops to beat her. Plus, she wanted a
mutant eight sound bug. She was not after any ordinary type of
eight sound bug.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei did not mind Han Sen being there, but Han Sen did
mind Feng Fei Fei’s presence. With an outsider there, he was not
able to freely use the Xuan Yellow Sutra. If an outsider saw him
turn a gene race into an egg, people would likely capture him for
research.</p>
<p>As Han Sen kept looking at Feng Fei Fei, he came to understand
she was not the type of person to mess around with. At least, that
was just the feeling he was getting. He did not have proof that was
the case.</p>
<p>Seeing Feng Fei Fei close her eyes again, Han Sen walked past
her. He kept heading into the deeper recesses of Night Cry Valley.
He wanted to keep his distance from her so she could not see what
he would be using.</p>
<p>Normal people who were good at singing should have also had good
hearing. Feng Fei Fei was one of the good ones, and her body had a
unique gene race. Although she did not open her eyes, Han Sen’s
movements were in her ears. In her mind, she pictured the scene of
him and his movements.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen not recognize her and walk straight into the
valley, Feng Fei Fei felt greatly relieved.</p>
<p>If she had been recognized, she would have been troubled. She
would have been unable to get the mutant eight sound bug as she had
hoped. If other people knew that the top singer and idol Feng Fei
Fei was fighting for an eight sound bug with a commoner, even if
she was there first, people would be talking about it a great
deal.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei was not afraid, but it was still something that
made her not feel very good.</p>
<p>In fact, Feng Fei Fei thought too much. Han Sen did not know
about the mutant eight sound bug. He was only there to catch an
ordinary eight sound bug.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked into the deeper parts of Night Cry Valley.
Although it was just nighttime, and the sky was not too dark, the
further he walked into the valley, the darker the valley
became.</p>
<p>Inside the valley, there were no big trees. There were just some
small plants around, but the grass and the leaves were very long.
They could have been a whole three feet tall. The reason the place
was called Night Cry Valley was that the gene races there mostly
appeared at night. One was unable to see them in the daytime. So,
Han Sen walked deeper into the valley to find gene races.
Strangely, however, he found none.</p>
<p>He walked to the farthest point of the valley and reached a dead
end. He decided to have a mosey about.</p>
<p>He was far away from that woman now. He no longer saw her, and
the area around him had grass that was three-feet high. If the
woman did not run there, she would not see what Han Sen was
doing</p>
<p>In the deepest part of the valley, there was a pool with very
clear water. It was not big. It was just half the size of a
basketball court. The water was clear. He saw some duck egg-like
stones beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Near the pool, there were some large stones. Han Sen sat atop
the biggest one. He was able to see in six different directions and
hear in eight directions. He would have time to aim.</p>
<p>The sky went dark. Before the sun had completely dipped into the
nether, Han Sen heard a “tzi-tzi” sound. It was something Han Sen
was quite familiar with. It was the sound of a cricket.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed where the sound came from, but he failed to
find the cricket. He discovered that the sound was coming from a
crack in the stone near the pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just going to have a look. He wanted to see if that
was a gene race, but his eyes froze. He saw movement in the
water.</p>
<p>Han Sen held his body stiff and peered into the water. Although
the light in the valley was minimal, Han Sen had a good pair of
eyes that enabled him to see the very bottom of the pool. He saw a
weird creature slowly moving.</p>
<p>The thing looked like a gecko. It was very big. It was one foot
long. Its body was dark green, and it was in the water. It was
camouflaging itself in the moss of the water, so it was hard to
notice.</p>
<p>That big, dark green, big gecko was twisting its body through
the water to climb. It was going to the stone gap that had the
“tzi-tzi” sound.</p>
<p>The big gecko emerged from the water, stared at the stone gap,
and climbed inside. It was like a toxic snake that ate people.</p>
<p>The dark green body did not have scales, but it had many small
lumps. It looked like a toad’s bumps. Seeing the big gecko come
before the stone gap, the stone gap flashed with a red color.
Something emerged from it.</p>
