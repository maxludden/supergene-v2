<h2>Ancient Wall</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2737</h3>

<p>Exquisite smiled and said, “Although the figure in the drawing
is something no one can understand, the picture has the meaning and
power of the elder that drew it. Just taking the time to study it
will be beneficial for you.”</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen was able to understand. Exquisite and Li Keer
wanted to let him experience the true god’s art because it would
ultimately benefit them. Through him, they could understand it
better and learn things from it. The experience would be beneficial
to them all, so it wasn’t a bad idea.</p>
<p>But the Ancient Wall was a leftover from the Very High
ancestors. Ordinary outsiders weren’t allowed to get close. Han Sen
and the silkworms could go there for a whole month after leveling
up to become deified, but the rules still forbade Bao’er—despite
being a family member—from going there.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer would be going to the Ancient Wall with
Han Sen, so they couldn’t take care of Bao’er.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen asked Bao’er for her opinion. Bao’er was
willing to stay at the Star Tree, and so Han Sen allowed her to
remain there. With the xenogeneics there, Bao’er wouldn’t be too
bored.</p>
<p>When the three of them left, the Six-Eared Macaque started to
become excited.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque was a different kind of xenogeneic. It was
intelligent enough that it had pretended to obey Han Sen as its
master. But in truth, it had just been observing. It wanted to find
a way to escape from the Star Tree.</p>
<p>The contract placed upon its body was very rigid, and the
Six-Eared Macaque couldn’t find any way to remove it. If it escaped
without removing the contract, it would still be restricted and
oppressed by the forces of the contract. Han Sen could easily take
over its mind, even if he was far away from whatever system the
monkey had hidden itself in. The monkey would be in agony until it
did what it was told.</p>
<p>“If I want genuine freedom, I must break the contract.” The
Six-Eared Macaque’s eyes glowed, and it watched Bao’er
intently.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque already knew Bao’er was Han Sen’s
daughter. She was obviously very dear to him. Now Han Sen wasn’t
around, and he wouldn’t be for a whole month.</p>
<p>“If I can capture her, I can use her to threaten Han Sen into
breaking the contract. Han Sen will have to do as I say.” The
Six-Eared Macaque felt that his chance had come.</p>
<p>“The other xenogeneics follow her commands, but there is only
one primitive deified in their midst. They have no chance of
defeating me. That being said, I don’t have to fight them. I just
need to use my fake body, go invisible, and knock her out.” The
Six-Eared Macaque was still forming his plan when he saw Bao’er
looking in his direction.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque was shocked. It thought Bao’er knew that
something was wrong, but then he heard Bao’er speak from beyond her
smile. She said, “Little Six, I’d like some of this fruit.”</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque really hated the name Little Six, but
Bao’er had called it over. It was the perfect opportunity. The
Six-Eared Macaque answered and quickly ran over to her.</p>
<p>“Little Master, what would you like to eat?” The Six-Eared
Macaque watched Bao’er carefully as she reclined comfortably. It
was thinking, “This is perfect. I don’t even need to be invisible.
I will just deliver her the fruit, knock her out, and then stuff
her someplace out of sight. That way, Han Sen will be forced to
break the contract with me.”</p>
<p>“I want that.” Bao’er raised her finger to indicate the piece
she wanted. She was wearing sunglasses while lying down on a
chair.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque picked up a fruit knife. He cut the fruit
into little pieces, took a slice, and brought it over to Bao’er. He
stretched it toward her, preparing to make his move.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at the Six-Eared Macaque. She didn’t reach out and
pick up the fruit. She smiled and said, “Did I say that I wanted to
eat it? Give the food to the other. One each. No more and no
less.”</p>
<p>The “other” Bao’er was talking about would be the little pigs.
They followed Bao’er around, eating good stuff all day long, but
their bodies never changed. They seemed as static and small as
ever.</p>
<p>“I’ll cut your *ss!” the Six-Eared Macaque suddenly shouted. It
raised its claws quickly to snatch Bao’er.</p>
<p>As the Six-Eared Macaque’s claws were about to make contact with
the pale, delicate skin of Bao’er’s neck, Bao’er suddenly shone
with a white light. The Six-Eared Macaque’s claws hit the light,
spraying a fountain of sparks. The monkey’s claws were unable to
break through that defense, and its attack had been entirely
blocked.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque was shocked. It leaned closer to take a
look. The light didn’t come from Bao’er. It came from the little
pigs around her.</p>
<p>Right now, the 16 little pigs were standing alertly around
Bao’er. Their eyes were wide and unblinking as they stared at the
Six-Eared Macaque. Mysterious symbols glowed on their foreheads,
and light shone from their bodies.</p>
<p>The holy light of the 16 little pigs combined and transformed
into a light shield that trapped the Six-Eared Macaque inside.</p>
<p>“You’re just a bunch of pigs! You can’t stop me,” the Six-Eared
Macaque growled. It shone with a golden light of its own, and it
slashed the light shield with its now-glowing claws.</p>
<p>Since it couldn’t assassinate its target, the monkey would have
to do this the hard way. The Six-Eared Macaque knew Han Sen
wouldn’t be back for a month, and it wagered it had enough time to
capture Bao’er. And in regards to the xenogeneics and the 16 little
pigs, the Six-Eared Macaque cared little for them.</p>
<p>But when its strike landed, the Six-Eared Macaque noticed that
its power wasn’t enough to rip through the shield that encased it.
The 16 little pigs were still holding it in place. None of them had
gotten hurt. They all just stared angrily at the monkey.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque was shocked. It used its power again,
hitting the light shield over and over. In growing astonishment,
the monkey tried its hardest, but it was unable to break the shield
of light. It really was trapped inside.</p>
<p>“Little Six, you are such a naughty boy.” Befuddled, the
Six-Eared Macaque watched Bao’er stand up, take off her sunglasses,
smile, and walk over to him.</p>
<p>For some reason, the Six-Eared Macaque felt a chill run down its
spine. It had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Tang Ming’er had only just entered Star Moon Shelter when
someone recognized her.</p>
<p>“Tang Ming’er. Are you Tang Ming’er?” A pretty boy wearing armor
approached. He was riding a tiger beast soul mount. He was leading
a group of knights, but he looked surprised as he stopped in front
of Tang Ming’er.</p>
<p>“I am Tang Ming’er. Who are you?” Tang Ming’er looked at the
pretty boy. She tried digging into her memories, but she could not
seem to recall who he was.</p>
<p>“I am Ning Bu Ao.” The pretty boy got off his mount and looked
at her with glee.</p>
<p>“Ning Bu Ao… you are uncle Ning’s son?” Tang Ming’er suddenly
remembered. She had seen Ning Bu Ao a few times, but she had only
been seven years old at the time. She didn’t remember him too well.
The pretty boy in front of her did look like the boy she used to
know as Ning Bu Ao.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao looked passionate as he said, “Ming’er, your timing
in arriving in Star Moon Shelter is most serendipitous. Since I am
here, I can guarantee no harm will befall you. If you want any type
of beast soul, just let me know. I will give you any in my
possession. I even have sacred-blood beast souls to give you.”</p>
<p>“Sister Ming’er, you guys chat. I’m tired and need to rest.” A
voice sounded near Tang Ming’er. Ning Bu Ao saw she had a little
boy next to her.</p>
<p>Ning Bu Ao’s brow furrowed. The boy only looked like he was 13
or 14 years old. He didn’t look like he belonged in the sanctuaries
just yet.</p>
