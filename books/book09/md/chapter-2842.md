  When Barr touched Han Sen's hand, his body exploded again. He became a black sun.

After the explosion, Barr was supposed to regenerate his power. Instead, the onlookers saw something weird. The black sun that had exploded was grabbed and lifted by Han Sen.

It was unlike energy generated by an explosion. It was like a big black ball.

Han Sen used one hand to grab the big black ball. He lifted it twice. The people were frozen as they watched Han Sen play ball. The audience did not know what was going on.

"The energy of the explosion has frozen. Is that an ice geno art?"

"I don't think so. There is no freezing effect."

"Holy shit! Is this the legendary time freeze?"

"You don't know shit. Time freeze stops things from moving. How could he just play with it like that?"

"Is it... Is it time freeze? Is Dollar's talent associated with time and space?"

"Impossible. The two talents of time and space are very rare. What are the odds of a guy from a small race having the two talents of time and space?"

"If it is not time and space, how can he play with it like that?"

Suddenly, many deified elites were in shock. Extreme King's Second Uncle Bai Buyi was stunned. "Are they really time and space talents? I thought time and space talents were hard to appear on the same creature. I thought only Sacred Leader had the two talents of time and space. This Dollar has the two talents of time and space too."

"It is hard to tell, but it does look like the two talents of time and space," an Extreme King elder said with a frown.

In a dark corner of the palace, Old Vulture asked with shock, "Old Cat, does this guy really have the two talents of time and space?"

"Impossible. The two talents of time and space are not that easy to find," Old Cat said. His face was riddled with confusion. He was also suspicious.

"No matter which way you look at it, that power looks like the two talents of time and space." Old Vulture looked at Han Sen, who was holding the black ball.

"It is hard to say, but it shouldn't be..." Old Cat insisted.

It was unknown how many scary beings were confused by what Han Sen was doing with his hands. They were not saying Han Sen's power was scary. They were saying that the two talents of time and space were very rare. If a pig had that talent, it would be a god pig.

In the garden, God's eyes narrowed into a squint. A very interesting facial expression appeared as God said, "He can control the universal cogwheels. That is an interesting power. Even the Very High's Very High Sense cannot achieve that. That is an interesting xenogeneic."

Han Sen lifted the black ball twice before throwing it. The black ball was thrown away like a ball into a planet. It blew the planet into nothing.

Barr showed up again. He was furious and wanted to charge Han Sen, but Han Sen coldly said, "If you come at me again, I will turn you into a ball forever."

Barr felt a chill. Although he had an undying body, being turned into a ball forever sounded like a fate that was worse than death.

"Right now, I am just primitive class. Let me become transmutation before fighting you again." Barr gnashed his teeth. He knew there was no point in fighting him. Therefore, he decided to concede and exit the geno god list.

Dollar's victory left many questions unanswered. It puzzled the elites throughout the universe. Even the hidden, old, antiques wanted to know who that Dollar was. The only answer they were going to get for now was "human."

Han Sen left the geno god list as a victor. He returned to the garden and looked like a child again. He did not want to use too much of his power.

"What was that geno art called?" God asked with a smile.

"Why would I tell you?" Han Sen knew what God's temper was like. It was a being that did not seem to get mad. If people did not know the truth, it was almost as if God could simply be bullied. Han Sen went to pour some tea.

God laughed because Han Sen did not answer but did not ask the question again. God just carried on watching the god fights that came next.

Han Sen was lying on a chair. He wanted to watch the next fight too because he wanted to watch Golden Growler. It was the fourth match, and Han Sen wanted to know if it was his Golden Growler.

Han Sen did not notice who the second bout was against. When he took a look, he was shocked.

The two deified creatures in the second round were ones Han Sen had never heard of. One was called a Dolek and named Dolek. He did not know what that was.

The other deified creature was called Space Garden's Queen.

Space Garden... How many Space Gardens are there in the universe? My Space Garden does not have a queen. Han Sen felt weird. He was looking at the space battleground on the geno god list.

A shadow entered the space battleground. Its body was weird. It was a blue transparent light. Its texture was like jelly that had been shined on. The body shape was like that of a giant.

When the other body showed up on the battleground, Han Sen screamed and lost his voice. It was Huangfu Jing.

"Huangfu Jing has become a primitive deified that fast?" Han Sen was shocked. It was no wonder she was willing to call herself Space Garden's Queen. Han Sen had warned all the humans there not to call themselves human. He guessed Huangfu Jing was already in Space Garden, which was why she used that name to participate in the god fights.

The Space Garden itself did not draw much attention because the Flower Gods of Space Garden were not well-known for their fighting. It was not even known if they had deified elites. Even if they did have one, it would not be anything spectacular.

On the other hand, the Dolek had drawn much attention.

"The Doleks. I cannot believe that race still exists. I thought Sky Palace had destroyed it."

"Since when were the Doleks that easy to destroy? They are considered one race and one body. As soon as one is alive, they can multiply and build their race. It looks like this Dolek just grew up not too long ago. He seems to have only just become primitive."

"A Dolek is good at splitting energy. Although it is not like Barr with his Destroyed god body, it is scary all the same. I bet that Space Garden Queen cannot beat it."

"Can the word Queen be used so randomly? That guy is too cocky."

While everyone was talking about the upcoming battle, they saw Dolek had a scary, blue substance chain. It punched toward Queen, covering the sky and ground in blue light.

Huangfu Jing was in front of the giant Dolek. She looked small. In the next second, Huangfu Jing's beautiful, long legs were raised. It was like a battleax striking Dolek.

Pang!

The substance chains, which were like blades, cut Dolek's blue light. It also cut his giant, jelly body in half.
