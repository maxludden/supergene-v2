<h2>Big Bad Luck</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3323</h3>

<p>Space Garden was saved, but they had only managed to keep the
area around the base. It was unknown how many Break World beasts
were out there hiding in the forest. They were combining with the
life souls. The longer time went by, the more their Break World
rate increased.</p>
<p>Han Sen left the base area. He held a Break World gene in his
hands. This Break World gene had come from Black King. He did not
have the time to refine it.</p>
<p>He put the tear-shaped Break World gene in his mouth. He felt a
weird power surge through his belly. His cells were changing
fast.</p>
<p>“Break World gene plus nine.” The announcement played in Han
Sen’s brain. Han Sen was happy about this. “I received nine Break
World genes at once. It looks like it will not be difficult getting
100 to max it all out. I just need to kill 10 Break World beasts.
With the amount of Break World beasts around in this universe,
killing 10 Break World beasts will not be difficult. Space Garden
itself should have at least more than 10 in the vicinity.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was set on leaving the base. He was determined to find
more Break World beasts around Space Garden. He wanted to max out
his Break World genes and get his Break World gene tally to a
hundred. He wanted to see what sort of changes his body would
develop.</p>
<p>The Break World genes were very weird. Although his Break World
gene amount had increased, the Break World rate of his four geno
arts did not increase. His Super God Spirit mode, however, did seem
to be affected. His spirit body underwent some changes. Because his
pure spirit body could not touch or manipulate anything, Han Sen
could not be certain if it was a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Big booming sounds were coming from the nearby
forest. It was like thunder heard from afar. The noise lasted a
long time.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he teleported. He went to where the
sound was coming from. He saw a white tiger with four wings lying
in blood. Its body was full of sword holes. It was like it had been
perforated by 10,000 knives and died. It kept bleeding without
reprieve.</p>
<p>A man with green feathers was above the four-winged tiger. It
was Ning Yue.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos of the Break World beast rampage earlier, Han
Sen had seen this four-winged white tiger. Its Break World rate was
not very high, but it was very fast. It was a wind element Break
World beast.</p>
<p>In that fight, it had not been killed. It was repelled.</p>
<p>Now, Ning Yue was killing it. The task seemed to be easy for him
to accomplish.</p>
<p>“Ning Yue, you have finally managed to conquer the little green
sword. Allow me to congratulate you.” Han Sen walked over to Ning
Yue.</p>
<p>Ning Yue descended from space and approached Han Sen. He stopped
one foot away from Han Sen. His eyes were calm and like a deep
well. He peered at Han Sen. “I am back. The fight between you and
me should begin now.”</p>
<p>“Can we not fight?” Han Sen shrugged his shoulders and replied,
“You know I’m a pacifist now, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Ning Yue curled his lips. He strangely looked at him. He
stumbled backward and looked at Han Sen. “Your unsettled heart did
not tell me that.”</p>
<p>“Things are different now,” Han Sen said. “Space Garden needs me
and you as well.”</p>
<p>“I have been waiting for this day for too long.” Ning Yue’s face
looked smaller. He stared at Han Sen and calmly said, “I want to
know how far I have come and how far you have come.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ning Yue and asked, “Must we fight?”</p>
<p>“It is not that I have to,” Ning Yue said. “It is just the fact
I have been waiting for this for so long. At least give me a reason
to keep waiting.”</p>
<p>“The geno tablet above the 33 skies,” Han Sen said. “Right now,
the whole universe of creatures wants to fight to become its
master. Why don’t you and I use the geno tablet for a bet? How
about we see which one of us can become its master?”</p>
<p>Ning Yue stared at the 33 skies and the headstone. He peered at
the geno tablet. He nodded and said, “That can work too.”</p>
<p>After that, Ning Yue turned around and readied himself to
leave.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at Ning Yue’s back and asked, “Ning Yue, do you
have a Break World gene?”</p>
<p>Ning Yue stopped in his tracks, but he did not turn around as he
replied, “Yes, I have got it.”</p>
<p>“What is the use of a Break World gene?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You have the Break World gene, too, don’t you? Don’t you know
what it is for?” Ning Yue paused and said, “The Break World gene
increased the strength of my Super God Spirit body.”</p>
<p>“I see. I wasn’t sure. I did not know if it was just me. It did
not improve the prowess of my geno arts.” Han Sen was able to
confirm his line of thinking.</p>
<p>“I do not know about others, but the Break World genes only
seemed to work on my Super God Spirit body. They do not work on my
geno arts,” Ning Yue said. He then flashed away and went deep into
the forests.</p>
<p>Clearly, he had a hankering to slay Break World beasts as well.
He wanted to increase his Break World genes like Han Sen. Ning Yue
was not in a rush to visit the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not go too deep into the forest. He took the
four-winged white tiger’s body back to Space Garden. Although the
Break World gene of the four-winged white tiger had been taken by
Ning Yue, its body would benefit humans and creatures.</p>
<p>After all, Space Garden did not have many Break World elites.
Its body would prove useful.</p>
<p>“Right now, the Break World beasts of the universe are
everywhere. If Ning Yue is in Space Garden, I will go to Sky
Palace.” Before Han Sen left, he gave the black king beast soul and
light king dragon’s beast soul to Ji Yanran so she could protect
herself.</p>
<p>The light god dragon beast soul was the stream light dragon
spear. The black king beast soul was an armor beast soul. It
created a black jade set of armor. Its Break World rate was 59%. It
only needed one more percent to reach 60%.</p>
<p>One was also able to improve the element. The stream god light
spear did not have an element. Han Sen did not know how to increase
the black king armor.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I feel so restless lately. I feel as if something bad
is going to happen.” While Han Sen was leaving, Ji Yanran pulled
him closer. This was the first time Ji Yanran had stopped Han Sen
from going.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. I am only going to Sky Palace to have a look. I
am not going to the 33 skies. I will be fine.” Han Sen held Ji
Yanran’s face and smiled.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, it is just me that is overthinking things. My Xuan
is not the best it can be yet. Maybe it just isn’t accurate
enough.” Ji Yanran forced a smile. She looked as if she was in a
bad mood.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Han Sen suggested, “How about this?
I will go to Mister White and have him calculate things. If things
are predicted to be bad, I will not go.”</p>
<p>Ji Yanran felt a bit safer after hearing that. She nodded and
said, “That would be for the best. You should go and see Mister
White.”</p>
<p>“Wait a while. I will be back soon.” Han Sen rubbed her cheeks
and left the garden. He went to see Mister White.</p>
<p>“Big bad luck!” Before Han Sen could even say anything, Mister
White said those three words to him the moment he saw him.</p>
