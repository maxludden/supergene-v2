<p>“Who told you I was one of the Very High?” Han Sen asked with
confusion.</p>
<p>Li Keer wanted to ask this, as well, but she didn’t have a
chance to.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, stop hiding it from us. We have heard that you
stole the Sea Sky Eye and the deified treasure Sky God Pillar from
Bai Wan Jie before he could even fart,” Dia Robber said.</p>
<p>Dragon One was technically an ally of the Extreme King, but the
three big races hadn’t started fighting yet. The Dragon wouldn’t do
anything to the people of the Very High. Instead, as the leader of
the three big races, the Very High had an even better reputation
than the Extreme King did. When it became a matter of life and
death, no one would ever oppose the Very High.</p>
<p>“I’m not one of the Very High. I am human. I said that a long
time ago,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“We understand that Brother Dollar is human.” Dragon One and Dia
Robber looked at each other. For a moment, Han Sen thought they
were going to wink knowingly at each other.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at their faces, and he knew he hadn’t explained
things well enough. But still, Han Sen wasn’t in the mood to talk
about it anymore. So, he didn’t speak.</p>
<p>Li Keer, however, was very frustrated. She wanted to say that
Dollar wasn’t one of the Very High and that she actually was, but
now wasn’t the time to mention something like that.</p>
<p>“How did things come to this?” Li Keer couldn’t figure out how
she had gotten herself into this situation.</p>
<p>Dollar said he was human, but now people were recognizing him as
one of the Very High. And a Very High like her couldn’t even
explain things clearly.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, do you have the time to hunt a deified
xenogeneic with me? I have prepared Big Destroyed,” Dia Robber said
to Han Sen with an excited look.</p>
<p>The Destroyed hadn’t been very happy to bargain with their
precious Big Destroyed, but now that they thought Han Sen was one
of the Very High, their apprehension vanished. They weren’t just
happy to proceed with the deal; they felt honored.</p>
<p>It was like saying, “Are you seeing this? Even the Very High are
interested in a geno art that we Destroyed have created. They want
to research our Big Destroyed. Do you know how strong our Destroyed
geno arts are? We have geno arts that even the Very High are
interested in.”</p>
<p>Of course, the Destroyed didn’t make their true feelings known
openly. They were just more than willing to make this exchange
using Big Destroyed. Han Sen wasn’t just going to be given Big
Destroyed, though; the Destroyed were going to provide a manual and
a heap of extra information to go along with the geno art. Unlike
their previous meeting, Dia Robber had actually brought the geno
art with him this time.</p>
<p>“Sure. We can go now. Sign the contract and give Big Destroyed
to Dragon One to hold onto.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>Dia Robber pushed the box containing Big Destroyed to Han Sen
and said, “I totally trust you. You can take a look at Big
Destroyed first. It’s okay!”</p>
<p>“There are actually some benefits to having that Very High title
erroneously above my head…” Han Sen thought. He knew that Dia
Robber still believed he was one of the Very High, which was why
the man was being so kind. Still, Han Sen didn’t see any point in
explaining since he had no intention of betraying his word.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Li Keer thought again. Hearing all this made
her want to cry.</p>
<p>Han Sen accepted Big Destroyed and had a look. He discovered
that there were many manuals and pamphlets of information, which
would make the geno art easier for him to learn.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly flicked through Big Destroyed and memorized all
the contents. He would practice it whenever he had the time to.</p>
<p>Due to the fact this geno art required the talents of the
Destroyed, Han Sen didn’t know if he would be able to learn it.</p>
<p>The deified xenogeneic Dia Robber wanted to kill was called Big
Evil Beast. It was both incredibly powerful and insanely fast. It
also possessed an evil area. Inside that area, no matter how great
your defenses were, you would be weakened. Even deified creatures
in its radius would be reduced to half-deified or even King level.
There was no way they could defeat the Big Evil Beast.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, how are we going to kill the Big Evil Beast?”
Dia Robber had plans of his own, and he only required Han Sen’s
power. But after learning that Han Sen was one of the Very High,
Dia Robber was more interested in hearing Han Sen’s thoughts and
ideas for tackling such a foe.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked, “How did you guys plan on fighting it?”</p>
<p>“We planned to combine our powers to restrain the Big Evil
Beast, and then have you perform the deadly strike,” Dia Robber
explained their attack strategy. “What do you think about the
plan?”</p>
<p>“We’ll use your plan, then.” Han Sen didn’t have an opinion on
the matter. He thought this plan would work because the Big Evil
Beast probably had a weakness somewhere, as well. It wouldn’t be
like ordinary deifieds outside the core area, which were flawless.
Cooperating with them to fell the Big Evil Beast wouldn’t be too
difficult.</p>
<p>Seeing that Dollar wasn’t opposed to their plan, Dia Robber and
Dragon One believed he was just too polite. They would never have
expected that Han Sen simply wasn’t interested in coming up with a
plan of his own.</p>
<p>Li Keer could see Dia Robber and Dragon One falling in love with
Han Sen, and it made her as angry as she was amused. She was the
genuine Very High of the assembly, and yet, no one even paid any
attention to her. And yet they lavished attention on Dollar, who
was a fake Very High.</p>
<p>“Wait until you guys learn the truth. It’ll be funny to see how
you respond to that revelation,” Li Keer laughed. She didn’t plan
to expose the reality of the situation, however. She was going to
go along with the charade for a while.</p>
<p>After a brief journey, everyone arrived where the Big Evil Beast
was said to reside. Dragon One and Dia Robber sent out a lot of
people to draw the creature into the open so Han Sen could perform
the final strike.</p>
<p>Dia Robber borrowed Dragon One’s Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger and
gave it to Han Sen. Although they believed Han Sen was one of the
Very High and thus had no lack of deified weaponry, they still did
what they believed was courteous and right. They didn’t want to
make a bad impression.</p>
<p>“I can use Galaxy Teleportation. If you need my help, I can lend
a hand,” Li Keer volunteered. She said this to Dia Robber, but she
only wanted to fight alongside Han Sen to further refine their
tender friendship.</p>
<p>But Dia Robber shook his head. “Thank you, Lady Keer, but you
can just spectate. We are fine with Dollar’s help.”</p>
<p>Li Keer felt so sad, and she thought to herself, “There is a
real Very High here, and yet you leave her on the sidelines. And
you’re spending so much to hire a fake Very High in the belief that
you’re getting a bargain. Are you guys stupid?”</p>
<p>Li Keer knew she couldn’t blame Dia Robber or the others, but
she still felt depressed about it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was waiting in the system. A short while later, Dragon
One and Dia Robber rushed out of a planet. They were being chased
by a very scary giant beast.</p>
<p>The beast looked like a tiger, and it was pitch black. Its body
was covered in scales, though, and a pair of enormous wings spread
out behind it. The tail looked like a lion’s tail.</p>
<p>When it flapped its wings to fly, black smoke billowed out
behind it. It was like a monster soaring out of the pits of
hell.</p>
<p>Dia Robber and Dragon One led a dozen half-deifieds to restrict
the Big Evil Beast, but their performance was worse than it had
been when they fought the Gold Armor General. After a short while,
they were on the cusp of losing.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, it is your time!” Dragon One cast the Dragon
Blood Evilbreaker and shouted to Han Sen.</p>
