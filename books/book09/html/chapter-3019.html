<p>Han Sen felt as if he was food on the chopping board. Anyone
could have done something to him.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady used all kinds of skills to torture him. She used a
knife to slash and an ax to strike. She used fire to burn and water
to boil. She used almost every method, even going so far as to
sprinkle spices on him. Han Sen wondered if Dragon Lady had wanted
to do this to him for a long time. It was as if she wanted to eat
him and see what he tasted like.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was not able to use geno arts, his body was
still very strong. The knives in Dragon Lady’s hands only inflicted
small wounds. They were unable to cause big cuts. His wounds also
recovered quickly. No scars remained after the wounds healed.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady was holding back. She never struck with the desire
or possibility of outright killing him. The bone-cutting knife hit
him a hundred times. It almost broke his belly, but there was never
a strike that endangered his life.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was a cow, Dragon Lady was a butcher. She could have
scraped all the meat and left nothing behind.</p>
<p>The intense pain was surging through Han Sen’s body. Although
his heart was tough, it was still very painful. He had to grit his
teeth to avoid roaring out loud.</p>
<p>“Pain is just an alarm system for your body,” said Han Yufei,
who was nearby. “The alarm is different and dependent on the
situation at hand. There are many different alarms, such as pain,
itching, soreness, and numbness. Ordinary people only feel the
strongest alarm systems, such as when your back is itchy, or you
step on a nail. Normal people only feel pain in the foot and ignore
the itch on the back. You must feel the deepest sense inside
everything. If you can understand every aspect of your body, you
can really control it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had to quiet down to feel the sensations of his body
being injured so that he could feel the pain. Hurting already made
people feel bad, but Han Sen needed to feel the nitty-gritty
details of it. There weren’t words to describe how bad that made a
person feel.</p>
<p>In this kind of situation, Han Yufei required Han Sen to be
absolutely still. She needed him to remain calm. That was like the
devil’s devil.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen was not like an ordinary person. It took
one day for Han Sen to get used to the feeling of pain. He was able
to calm down and come to grips with the details and feelings of the
pain. With a feeling like that, it was a little bit different. Even
though pain was one feeling, it had many subtle layers. Different
types of pain made the body react differently to the sensation.
That represented the body having different levels of hurt. In
response, the body made changes to it.</p>
<p>Feeling pain was terrible. If one used their heart to feel it,
some pain actually came along with some small and weird feelings.
It made people unable to discover if it was a good feeling or a bad
feeling.</p>
<p>“A normal creature’s evolution mode makes the body tough and
strong. They think that is power, but they will forget about the
reinforcement of feeling. It makes your body more solid. The
feeling powers will be delayed. This is actually the incorrect
course of evolution. Not feeling pain does not mean your body isn’t
getting hurt. Having a sensitive body can make your body react much
faster and more precisely. This reaction of the body makes you
think faster.”</p>
<p>Han Yufei kept explaining. “It would be like if you were
sleeping and your legs were burned by fire. Your body raises the
alarm of pain. It is sent to your brain, and your brain starts
thinking and making you react to deal with the situation. Pain
itself is a body’s alarm. You do not need to think about what you
have to do. You will make an ordinary reaction, and that is the
fastest reaction. If you can make do by just using your body’s
reaction during a fight, then you will be faster than everybody
because you do not have to think. Compared with others, that saves
you a lot of reaction time.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “That means I am just a brainless man with a
simple head but strong limbs.</p>
<p>She seemed to see through Han Sen’s thoughts. Han Yufei smiled
and said, “Do not underestimate the natural reactions of your body.
Brainless does not really mean you are dumb. If you can really make
the body react in a fight, with the Sacred blood power, you do not
even have to use your brain to kill other creatures.”</p>
<p>Although Han Yufei spoke as if it made sense, Han Sen did not
agree with her at all. He thought everything was better when he
relied on thinking</p>
<p>On the other hand, if he was able to get a reaction power like
Han Yufei was describing, it would not be a bad thing to
possess.</p>
<p>In fact, regarding what Han Yufei said, it wasn’t necessarily a
bad feeling. Yet, like many others, Han Sen ignored that
question.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his heart to feel. With Dragon Lady’s help, it only
took a few days for his body to react to small feelings. Even so,
Han Sen did not think he was controlling the blue blood. It was
still working with a mind of its own. It had not combined with his
red blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked his question. Han Yufei replied, “To understand
your own feelings is just the first step. What comes next is the
true beginning. Do you remember what I told you? You must go to the
absolute still level to really control the blue blood so that your
body will stop and feel the details of itself. It is down to you to
understand that. No one can help you.”</p>
<p>Ever since Dragon Lady stopped hurting him, Han Sen just stood
alone without moving.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly discovered that to be absolutely still was
entirely impossible.</p>
<p>He was able to make his heart stop pumping and his lungs stop
breathing. He had even made his blood stop flowing, but his body
still had many of its functions running.</p>
<p>Like the brain and changing of cells, Han Sen thought it would
be easy to quiet them down. The more he tried to suppress them, the
noisier his body became. Countless numbers of cells functioned. It
was like a partying nightclub. Because of that, his feelings grew
deeper. His feelings were supremely sensitive. The more he felt,
the more his body could not be kept still.</p>
<p>Han Sen was no longer able to resist telling Han Yufei, “It is
impossible to remain absolutely still.”</p>
<p>“Blue blood power has never fit into the rules of this
universe,” Han Yufei coldly said. “If you cannot achieve absolute
control of your body, how are you supposed to control a power that
exists outside the rules?”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything because what Han Yufei said sort of
made sense. Only rare people did rare things. If he did not have
the power to be better than everyone else, there was no way he
could control the powers that weren’t bound by the rules.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to calm down and make his body much quieter. He
hoped he could reach the absolutely still mode that Han Yufei
described.</p>
<p>The more Han Sen wanted his body to be still, the stronger the
reaction his body developed. Standing there and not moving seemed
to be more tiring than a fight to the death.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady looked at the near-petrified Han Sen, who was
standing still nearby. She asked Han Yufei, “Does this really
work?”</p>
<p>“He must do it,” Han Yufei seriously said. “It is the only way
to survive. God Spirits will not let anyone who possesses blue
blood go. When the God Spirits descend again, it won’t be another
goon like Shadow God.”</p>
