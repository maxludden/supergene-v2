      “The Destroyer Wolf at rank 139 on the super geno core leaderboard won’t
      be all that easy to kill,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “May I ask what your rank is on the super geno core leaderboard?” Han Sen
      asked, out of genuine curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>“I am seventeenth,” Gu Qingcheng said carelessly.</p>
    <p>
      “You’re that high? You’re seventeenth and you can’t defeat this Destroyer
      Wolf that is only 139?” Han Sen was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It can’t beat me in raw strength, but it has the ability to consume
      space. I will be unable to catch him, and that is why I’ll need you and
      Nightmare,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me, it sounds as if all you really need is the assistance of Little
      Red. Why don’t you just ask him straight away? I can’t make him come.” Han
      Sen shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He won’t accept my invitation, but you will be just as useful as him. You
      can come to help,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay. And just to confirm what you told me; I will be receiving the items
      once it’s dead, yes?” Han Sen smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you can truly help, sure. Would you plan on taking the loot even if
      you didn’t put any effort in?” Qu Qingcheng wasn’t very polite when it
      came to these sorts of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will see, but I am known to take out as much as I put in.” Han Sen did
      not argue and just went along with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to see how strong Gu Qingcheng was if she truly was ranked
      seventeenth on the super geno core leaderboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen followed Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon out of the shelter. The
      travel was dull for Han Sen, and he found himself bored. So, he asked,
      “Who is in first place on the super geno core leaderboard?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng was equally bored. She said, “The one currently in first
      place is the fellow who leads Sacred. He claims to be God’s own child, but
      there are others who have the same might as him. The person in first place
      switches every now and again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why does the person in first place frequently change?” Han Sen asked,
      having been surprised by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s so weird about that? There are many powerful geno cores there, of
      emperor class and berserk class. They’re all good at something. No one is
      the absolute strongest. That being said, when I first became a demigod, I
      heard there was a geno core that held first place for a very long time. It
      hadn’t lost once. But that is the only time in history when the first
      place on the super geno core leaderboard seemed fixed. Nowadays, the
      holder of the first position changes frequently,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was that geno core’s name? Is it still on the leaderboard?” Han Sen
      asked with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If it was still on the leaderboard, the ranks wouldn’t keep changing. I
      have only heard about it through hearsay, though. When I first arrived
      here, it was already gone. I suppose you could say it’s more of a myth
      now. Its name, however, was Destiny’s Tower. I can only suppose it left
      for the Fifth Sanctuary alongside its master,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen heard Gu Qingcheng say this, his heart jumped. If that
      stellar geno core was indeed Destiny’s Tower, it probably meant the one
      resting in his Sea of Soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shit! Destiny’s Tower is that strong?” Han Sen held onto his excitement
      and pretended the name didn’t ring any bells. Then, he asked, “Who was
      Destiny’s Tower’s master?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know, and I don’t think anyone does. It’s an old myth, and it is
      something I have only heard of once,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen asked a few more questions, but she didn’t know much. She said the
      master of Destiny’s Tower was strange. The rumors said when he first
      appeared on the geno core leaderboard, he did so at a low rank.
      Apparently, it was in the ten-thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had seen it in the first few ranks, but all of a sudden, it managed
      to reach number one. No one knew whether that was a good thing or a bad
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, this was just part of the myth. Gu Qingcheng had only heard
      about these events. She hadn’t witnessed them first-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen retreated into thought. “Is this Destiny’s Tower the same one
      that’s in my Sea of Soul? If it is that good, and so was its master, why
      did they not go on to the Fifth Sanctuary? And who was that being in armor
      that resided in the black chimenea? Why was he an enemy of Destiny’s
      Tower’s master?”
    </p>
    <p>
      All these questions now rattled around Han Sen’s head, but thinking he
      actually owned that tower now, he almost lost control and laughed his head
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dad, why are you so happy?” Bao’er was in Han Sen’s arms. She looked
      right at him as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it’s just because you’re next to me. That’s why I am happy,” Han Sen
      quickly said. He was worried Gu Qingcheng might have gotten suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bao’er heard this, she was delighted. She kissed Han Sen on the cheek
      and said, “I am happy too, when you are around me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysian Moon couldn’t bear watching it. She balked. “Ugh, you two are so
      gross!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re just jealous. You could be like me, if you had a beautiful
      daughter, too.” Han Sen held Bao’er and laughed at her.
    </p>
    <p>“Humph!” Elysian Moon turned glum and looked away.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt weird about that, though. He wasn’t sure what he said that
      might have upset her. What he said shouldn’t have peeved her as it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng then changed the subject. “When you see Destroyer Wolf, be
      careful. It can consume space, and it can also leap out at you from tears
      in the dimension, pouncing at you from any angle. If he slips into a
      space-crack, follow me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That sounds annoying. How do you plan on killing it?” Han Sen frowned and
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had enough power to fight super creatures, but this was a berserk
      super creature with space powers. It would be a hard fight. That was,
      unless he used his Destiny’s Tower. But that thing cost a lot of energy,
      and it wouldn’t be wise to show it off in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      If others recognized it was Destiny’s Tower, and it was in the hands of a
      human, all the emperors and super creatures would come dogpile on him to
      end him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe we should take a look first. There’s every chance we won’t get to
      him,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>“What do you mean?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
    <p>
      “That Destroyer Wolf offended some people. For some reason, many creatures
      and spirits are now after him. We’re just going to try our luck and see if
      we can get it. We might not even be able to find it,” Gu Qingcheng said.
    </p>
    <p>“Why didn’t you tell me any of this sooner?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
    <p>
      Hearing her say this, Han Sen knew this task would not be as simple as he
      had initially assumed.
