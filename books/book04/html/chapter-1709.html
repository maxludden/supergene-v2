      “What is this?” asked Xie Qing King, holding his nose and looking at the
      bodies and the liquids around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are creatures held for testing and experimentation. Some are
      prototypes of something else—like him.” Old Cat jumped toward one of the
      crystal tanks, and he spoke with eyes fixed on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Xie Qing King looked at Old Cat, and then observed the strange
      creatures contained within the tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could not describe what it was. It looked like a human, but a bug
      at the same time. It had human limbs, but the head had the eyes of a fly,
      with the multitude of lenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while the limbs were like a human’s, the joints were those of bugs. It
      looked very weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s just a disgusting bug.” After Old Cat said that, he leaped onto the
      tank and began slapping it with a paw. He obviously intended to break it
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you ready? Dead or alive, it doesn’t matter: behead the thing as soon
      as you are able to,” Old Cat said to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>“Yes.” Han Sen was in agreement Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The crystal tank broke, and the liquid and the bug man came spilling out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not say a word. He simply summoned the white geno armor, and
      with his hand like a blade, struck the neck of the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand, now clad in the gauntlets of the armor, made a metallic striking
      noise when it hit. Han Sen’s power and geno armor had only been able to
      make a slight scuff on its neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the bug-man showed no reaction. It looked to be already dead.
      But just to be safe, Han Sen gave it another hundred cuts until he was
      able to break its shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meat inside was like jam, and there was no blood. It looked like it
      had been dead for quite some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      God knew how many times Han Sen had to hit it after that, but eventually,
      the head was lopped off. As he worked on it, he thought to himself, “This
      thing is so tough! Thankfully, it is dead. If it wasn’t, this would be
      quite a lot of trouble.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, according to the terms of our deal, if it was dead when we found
      it, the item we came for belongs to me. You’ll hold up your end of our
      bargain, correct?” Old Cat saw the bug-man’s head fall off and quickly
      jumped on it to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine. Suit yourself.” Han Sen did not plan on stealing from him, so he
      just walked back a few steps and watched the Old Cat. He was keen to see
      what he was going to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat used his claws to scratch away at the bug-man’s armor. A deep
      crack was instantly formed, and that gave Han Sen quite the shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew Old Cat was not weak, but the action it had just performed
      was rather shocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if Han Sen used the glove, he knew he’d have much trouble trying to
      break the shell. It wouldn’t have been easy. Old Cat was certainly much
      stronger than he was letting on, and much stronger than Han Sen’s own
      estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat’s claws were sharper than a surgeon’s scalpel, that was for sure.
      In no time at all, he was peeling the creature open. And before long,
      pulled back a paw that was holding something green.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that? A stone?” Han Sen looked right at the item in Old Cat’s
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those are its guts.” Old Cat looked so happy to have obtained the
      jade-looking guts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t see where the cat put it, but he still asked, “They look
      like rocks, not organs. What are they truly for?” Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is good stuff. You’ll know all about it once you get out. With how
      you are now, you won’t understand.” After Old Cat dug up the guts, he
      ended his search. He jumped and said, “Let’s go, there is nothing left.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Xie Qing King, meanwhile, wasn’t feeling too good about this. He said,
      “While we’re here, shouldn’t we explore more of this strange place?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think we have come here to sightsee? You’ll die if you explore
      anymore.” Old Cat rolled his eyes and started walking out
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Xie Qing King looked at each other, and then followed after
      Old Cat, so they could be led back to where they had initially come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three of them walked past the greenhouse, and as they passed it, Old
      Cat hunkered a little and asked, “Did you touch the stuff in there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We were with you. You know that we didn’t take anything.” Xie Qing King
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old Cat, what’s going on?” Han Sen asked, looking across the greenhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Someone has been digging in the soil.” Old Cat stared at the disturbed
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Saw it, too. It was like a freshly dug grave, with soil churned up
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>“You didn’t dig this, did you?” Han Sen asked, with a frown.</p>
    <p>“If I did, why would I ask?” Old Cat madly rebutted.</p>
    <p>
      “If it wasn’t you or us two, might there be other creatures around? And if
      that isn’t possible, maybe the thing buried dug its own way out,” Xie Qing
      King said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Old Cat looked glum. No matter what the case was, this was bad
      news.
    </p>
    <p>“Let’s get out of here.” After Old Cat said that, he started to run.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Xie Qing King ran as well. They ran for a while, but
      eventually, their faces fell. They had run dozens of miles, but they
      hadn’t escaped the vicinity. They found that they had walked in a loop,
      ending up back at the greenhouse and the fresh hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave them a very bad feeling. They looked around, but it was all quiet.
      There didn’t seem to be anything else there that was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura could not feel the presence of other creatures.
      But they fell silent and went to examine the deep hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep going!” Old Cat told them to keep going, and so they did. This time,
      however, they walked faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t long before the three of them ended up back at the greenhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can this be happening?” Xie Qing King wasn’t afraid, and he was
      actually quite happy to see the greenhouse again. Han Sen and Old Cat
      looked at each other and prepared to run, but suddenly, they heard a
      strange noise.
    </p>
    <p>Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The soil around the grave started to explode. Many more black holes were
      created, and the entire graveyard looked like one giant beehive.
