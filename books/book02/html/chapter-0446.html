    <p>
      &#8220;If we do not join your gang, how much do we need to pay for an
      ice-armored beast?&#8221; A middle-aged man in his 40s or 50s asked Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;An A-Class Saint Hall license of the evolver level,&#8221; Han Sen
      said determinedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What? An A-Class Saint Hall license of the evolver level for an
      ice-armored beast? Why don’t you go rob someone instead?&#8221; The man
      shouted madly immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people also accused Han Sen of being shameless. Some even tried to
      snatch a body on the back of the golden growler.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was just human nature. Many people could go through hardship with you
      together, but could not share your wealth, let alone watch you become
      fortunate.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ouch!&#8221; Han Sen made a sudden move, and the cursed wolf dagger
      suddenly cut off the hand of someone who had touched the golden growler to
      snatch a body.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shrill scream made everyone feel dumbstruck. They all stopped moving
      and looked to Han Sen and the man with a broken arm was rolling around on
      the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Without my permission, I dare you touch my properties. If your
      hands touched it, you would lose your hands. If your feet moved, you would
      lose your feet. If your head came close, you would lose your head,&#8221;
      Han Sen said coldly with the blood the cursed wolf dagger.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dammit. He got some nerve to use violence. Let us kill the
      bastard.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;You injured our friend. Are you even a human being?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kill this animal!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Son of a bitch!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen suddenly became the person whom everyone hated, as if he was so
      guilty that everyone would kill him the first chance they got.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xu You and a few others tried to stop the rest of the group, because they
      were so few, four or five persons had already thrown themselves at Han
      Sen, who were all old-timers who had been in this place for more than two
      decades.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, they were not trying to avenge the person who had lost his
      hand, but to take all the bodies for themselves after getting rid of Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      In their eyes, Han Sen was no more than a brat who got lucky. Since he had
      just entered Second God’s Sanctuary, there was no way that he was their
      match. It would be a piece of cake to kill Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those people summoned their beast souls and tried to kill him with each
      move, ready to take Han Sen’s life. These bodies were so attractive,
      especially to those who had not seen so much mutant meat in decades. On
      top of that, there was even a sacred-blood bird leg. Lust had gone to
      their heads.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not change his expression at all. Smiling coldly, he had
      thought of this possibility when he brought back the meat and did not feel
      surprised at all. It was not even necessary to get angry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli’s face became stern. She summoned a bow and arrow, ready to
      help Han Sen. These people were the ones she despised the most.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because most people could potentially gain some benefits, they became
      self-righteous in grabbing what belonged to others. These people were
      nothing different from robbers, and even worse than robbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      At least robbers got the bad name that they deserved, while these people
      tried to justify their behaviors.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, before Yang Manli could even shoot an arrow, Han Sen suddenly
      moved. Instantaneously, he dashed between the first five people who made
      their attacks.
    </p>

    <p>Ouch!</p>

    <p>
      Five screams were made at the same time, so they sounded like it came from
      the same person. The first five people who threw themselves at Han Sen all
      lost their right hands which were holding their weapons. Blood jetted out,
      and the five persons were rolling around on the ground with their left
      hands covering their broken arms, pleading and crying.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone was dumbstruck by Han Sen who had a straight face and the five
      screaming persons, shocked at what had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those five people had been in Second God’s Sanctuary for more than a
      decade. They were all quite experienced. Although it was hard to get some
      meat in this place, their fitness level must be over forty after so many
      years. However, after one move, all of them lost their right hands, which
      made everyone shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who else want to take my life?&#8221; The code gaze of Han Sen
      swept across everyone’s face. Those who were trying to kill Han Sen were
      snatch some meat all felt a chill and stepped back involuntarily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli looked at Han Sen with a complicated expression, as she had not
      expected that Han Sen would be so aggressive.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Uncle Qing is here…&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Uncle Qing, you must help us. This bastard hurt his own
      kind.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Uncle Qing, we have always helped each other, and he is cruel even
      to one of us. He’s just an animal.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      A middle-aged man in his 70s or 80s came from the ice cave. For an evolver
      who had a lifespan of three hundred years old, eighty years old was indeed
      just middle-aged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the man called Uncle Qing, Yang Manli became nervous, put down her
      bow and arrow and said hastily, &#8220;Uncle Qing, don’t listen to them,
      they were trying to steal Han Sen’s…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Yang Manli even finished her words, Uncle Qing gestured her to
      stop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Uncle Qing’s behavior, the rest of the group became excited and
      blamed Han Sen for everything with exaggeration, as if it was a felony for
      Han Sen not to share his gains with them for free. Their behavior of
      stealing was also beautified as a move for justice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli looked upset. Uncle Qing should be the first person who was
      teleported to this place. He had been here for a few decades and had the
      most geno points among the group. He was also the only person who had
      killed a mutant creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Uncle Qing himself, his fitness level was around sixty, but
      Yang Manli believed it should be more than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, Uncle Qing had also practiced strong hyper geno arts design
      for evolvers, so he was not any average evolver. It was fair to say that
      Uncle Qing was the strongest person in the group.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen was strong, he had just entered Second God’s Sanctuary.
      If Uncle Qing was trying to harm Han Sen, Han Sen might be killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Uncle Qing, this is not all Han Sen’s fault…&#8221; Xu You gritted
      his teeth and said in Han Sen’s favor.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Uncle Qing gestured him to silence as well, and walked to Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli’s face became even more grim. She quickly walked to Han Sen,
      showing her attitude.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rest of the group were celebrating Han Sen’s mishap with expectation
      and greed. As long as Uncle Qing got rid of Han Sen, they should be able
      to split the meat. Uncle Qing had always been generous, so they should all
      be able to get some.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Uncle Qing walking straight to Han Sen, many people were shouting
      inwardly, &#8220;Kill him… Kill him…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen had some extraordinary performance and an impressive
      dagger, no one believed he could beat Uncle Qing who was absolutely
      stronger than him.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Uncle Qing was less than 6 feet from Han Sen, under everyone’s watch
      and expectation, he drew a Z-steel knife that looked ancient.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the surprising, suspicious, puzzled, confused, uneasy, and frightened
      looks from different people, Uncle Qing wielded the weapon and cut off the
      heads of the five people who were rolling around and screaming. Then,
      Uncle Qing bowed to Han Sen reverently.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Young Master Han, Ning Qing has come too late. I deserve any
      punishment from you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone was shocked at the moment. Uncle Qing was the strongest person in
      the group, the only one who had killed a mutant creature, acted as if he
      was Han Sen’s servant. Everyone felt they needed more brainpower to
      understand that.
