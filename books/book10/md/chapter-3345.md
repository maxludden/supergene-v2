Yet, the Break World beasts were forming a path for Wang Yuhang that enabled him to enter.

The space tunnel never opened for long. Wang Yuhang did not have time to take care of the heavily injured Break World beasts. He kept speeding things up. He became a light and entered the 33 skies.

After Wang Yuhang entered the 33 skies, the Break World beasts that seemed all crazy went back to normal.

Wang Yuhang felt major relief. He thought, “Luckily, the Break World rate of the Break World beasts in the geno universe is not high. If it wasn’t, I doubt my Super God Spirit body would have been able to affect them as much as it did.”

Wang Yuhang knew his body type was special. When he was young, his body type made him different from other children his age.

Everyone always thought Wang Yuhang was an unlucky person and very bad when it came to love. When he went to the sanctuaries, he attracted the ire of many creatures that all sought to attack him.

If 100 people were escaping in a different direction each, the creatures would always and only go for him. This kind of abnormal situation made Wang Yuhang experience many difficulties in growing up.

Other people treated him like a bad smell, in which he would only bring misfortune. It was not just outsiders who were like that with him. Even the Wang family did not want to maintain their connection with him. Everyone hated Wang Yuhang because they were afraid of being infected by his bad luck.

Wang Yuhang was able to keep living because the Wang family continued to give him resources and wipe his ass. The most important thing to know, however, was that Wang Yuhang was talented. He was someone who always had what it took to be great.

Amidst all those bad situations, he could still use his own power to keep on living through tough situations and scenarios.

His purpose was to just survive. It was that small. Even so, he paid a price ordinary people could not imagine.

Only Wang Yuhang knew he was not just an unlucky person. He had been researching his body type. Although there were no results to his research, the study of the people that had his body type led to him understanding something.

Wang Yuhang did not know how to describe his body type. If he had to describe it, there was not a description that was accurate or appropriate.

His body type was able to be described as one with imbalanced hormones, but that was not accurate. Of course, that kind of imbalance was not from him. It was because he could affect the hormones of other creatures. Rather, he had a substance that was like hormones. Because Wang Yuhang did not know what the name of this substance was, he chose to call it hormones. It was close to the substance. It was what he used as a name for it.

This substance affected creatures more than hormones did.

When Wang Yuhang was his usual self, his body type affected the creatures around him. It made the bodies of other creatures have a lesser amount of that substance. Their mass was reduced. Thus, the creatures created an emotion of hate toward him. It led to them being hostile toward him. This was why people called him someone of grand misfortune and a negative influence on others.

As Wang Yuhang grew up, the effectiveness of this became stronger. It led to people hating him more and more. He attracted the attention of many creatures to attack him at once while ignoring everyone else.

Ever since he met Han Sen and the others, though, Wang Yuhang started to at last feel as if he was not treated like a monster. That was why he liked being with people like Han Sen and the others.

He was then granted a Super God Spirit body. He understood his body type. Because of this body type, he received a Super God Spirit body that was called Super Hormone.

After getting this Super God Spirit body, Wang Yuhang was able to control his Super Hormone. All creatures had this Super Hormone. If he was able to make the Super Hormones of a creature lighter, the creatures around would hate him or treat him like a nemesis. They would try to kill him as fast as they could. They would shut out all other thoughts and do their best to kill him.

When Wang Yuhang’s Super Hormone increased, his body would become incredibly charming. It was not just the other gender. Even those of the same gender were unable to avoid his attraction. They would do anything for him. They would even gamble their lives for him.

This was a very scary and weird power. If normal people received this power, they would be very happy. Someone could get anyone from the opposite gender they wanted by using this power. They could make those of the opposite gender their slaves. Wang Yuhang was not happy with this power.

He saw countless creatures go crazy for him, and that disgusted him. He thought he was a monster. Only Han Sen and the others, who were also strange, made him feel like a human.

Now, he was possessed by a life soul. His Super Hormone body was able to break the world. Wang Yuhang was able to control the Super Hormone power to make others behave precisely how he wanted them to.

Under the influence of the Super Hormone, even Break World creatures developed a lot of affection from him. They would even die for him just to smile at them.

It was just that Wang Yuhang did not like this power. If Mister White had not said that Han Sen would have trouble in the 33 skies and might not come back, Wang Yuhang would not have exposed himself and let others know he had this power.

This time, he had to rely on his Super Hormone power to gain access to the 33 skies. There was no other way for him to do it.

He checked the area around. Wang Yuhang was shocked. He saw a straight road ahead of him. Aside from the road, there was only yellow sand around.

Wang Yuhang drove his bike, wanting to fly into the sky. He wanted to take a look at the entire area, but he soon realized he could not fly. He and the bike were on the ground.

“An air restriction power.” Wang Yuhang drove the bike down a straight road. In front of the road, he noticed that both sides of it had many weird creatures. They looked like xenogeneics or gene races. They looked like scorpions, but their heads were bigger than his bike. There were many of them.

Wang Yuhang was not in the mood to take care of those scorpions. It would take him a long time to take down all the scorpions. He did not know how long it would take. He was only there for one purpose, and that was to find Han Sen. He did not want to waste time on the scorpions.

He used his Super Hormone. This time, he used it on himself. With the effects of the Super Hormones, Wang Yuhang’s existence became weaker. He drove the bike past the scorpions. The scorpions ignored him.

The bike was loud, but the group of scorpions did not see it. It was like they were not interested. Wang Yuhang drove very fast. He drove further and further down the road, right past the pincers. Still, no scorpions sought to attack him.

After a while, Wang Yuhang’s face looked terrible. The road was seemingly endless. No matter how fast his bike was or for how long he rode, ahead of him was just an endless road. There was only the desert all around.
