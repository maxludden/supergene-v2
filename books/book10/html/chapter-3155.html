<h2>Comparing Sword Skills</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3155</h3>

<p>“Teacher Jia, what do you think of my sword skills?” After Qin
Bai finished his performance with Wavy Sword Skill, Jia Shi Zhen
looked surprised. She couldn’t believe what she had just witnessed.
Qin Bai suddenly exploded with confidence. He looked at Jia Shi
Zhen with confidence.</p>
<p>Usually, he never dared to talk to Jia Shi Zhen like that. Now,
he was cocky. He did not have the fear he usually harbored.</p>
<p>“Mister, your Wavy Sword Skills are very good,” Jia Shi Zhen
said with a nod. “If you combined with the nine-wave fish, you
could conduct a miraculous performance.”</p>
<p>She was very surprised, so she asked, “How did Mister Crown
Prince practice in the past two days? You have got the Wavy Sword
Mind. You are a genius.”</p>
<p>When Qin Bai heard that, his cockiness was amplified by a few
more levels. He did not want to tell her Bao’er tortured him to
learn it. He made it sound better. “You wanted me to learn sword
skills, but I did not know where to begin. So, I asked Han Sen for
help. He allowed his daughter to practice with me and help train
the Wavy Sword Skill. During the past two days, I have been
practicing sword skills. If you think I’m doing alright, then I
guess I succeeded.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai was a person who could just heal the sky and forget the
pain. He thought Han Sen had done well. Even Teacher Jia was
complimenting him. He never thought something like this could ever
happen, so he mentioned Han Sen for him to earn some credit. “In a
critical moment, Han Sen is the most helpful. If it was not for
him, Teacher Jia would not be complimenting me.” Qin Bai was
overjoyed.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen frowned. She looked at Bao’er and thought, “This
little girl is only four or five years old. How could the crown
prince learn a sword mind by practicing with her? I do not believe
this one bit!”</p>
<p>She did not believe it, but Qin Bai did learn a sword mind in
two days. If he had not practiced, then it would not explain his
achievement.</p>
<p>“It looks like many myths cannot be trusted. This Han Sen might
not be as useless as I first suspected.” Jia Shi Zhen looked at Han
Sen again. She now put everything on Han Sen. After all, Han Sen
had killed Steel Scene. If there was someone who was able to teach
Qin Bai a sword mind, it would have had to be Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Do you know the sword?” Jia Shi Zhen spoke to him with a
different tone of voice.</p>
<p>“I know a bit, but I am not very good.” Han Sen was being very
honest.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s sword and mind skills were not as good as Six Paths
King. He was not as good as Lone Bamboo either. They were the real
swordsmen. Han Sen did not put much effort into learning the sword
skills.</p>
<p>Words like that going into Jia Shi Zhen’s ears seemed wretched.
To be able to teach Qin Bai a sword mind was an extraordinarily
difficult thing.</p>
<p>“No worries. If you do know a few sword skills, why don’t we at
least compare sword skills?” Jia Shi Zhen really wanted to give it
a go. She wanted to know what skills Han Sen had.</p>
<p>If he was someone good, then it was fine for Qin Bai to spend
more time hanging out with him. If he had used some sort of trick
to let Qin Bai learn a sword mind, she could not let Qin Bai hang
out with him.</p>
<p>“The knife and the sword do not have eyes,” Han Sen said. “I am
afraid hurting each other is bad.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine,” Jia Shi Zhen said with a frown. “You and I can
compare sword skills. We don’t have to use gene-race power.”</p>
<p>By saying “hurting each other is bad,” Han Sen meant it would be
bad to hurt her.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen was determined. She did not want to accept his
answer.</p>
<p>“If the teacher really wants this, then I have no choice but to
comply.”</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen did not speak. She picked up two swords and threw
one to Han Sen. She held one in her hands. When she waved her
sword, it was the beginning of Wavy Sword Skill. It was called Calm
and Calm.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched her perform Calm and Calm. He knew precisely
what she meant. Jia Shi Zhen was going to test out his Wavy Sword
Skill.</p>
<p>Wavy Sword Skill was not a very powerful sword skill. Skills in
this world were not as great as the ones in the geno universe.</p>
<p>They depended on the outside power too much. It made their own
powers possess extraordinary flaws. Aside from some powerful
elites, no one could do them both well.</p>
<p>Sen already had skills that were similar to that. After he saw
Qin Bai’s performance, he was already familiar with Wavy Sword
Skill. He used the Calm and Calm beginner’s skill.</p>
<p>When Jia Shi Zhen watched Han Sen perform the same skill, she
frowned. She used Calm and Calm as a beginning skill because she
wanted Han Sen to strike first.</p>
<p>Han Sen did the same thing as her, which meant he wanted her to
go first.</p>
<p>She was a teacher of the Qin Kingdom, and she was widely
renowned for her sword skills. Han Sen’s behavior suggested he was
underestimating her. Jia Shi Zhen did not mind that. She readied
herself to attack Han Sen first. When it came to the point where
she needed to unleash a strike, she wasn’t sure where to begin.</p>
<p>Han Sen just stood where he was, using the Calm and Calm skill
she was very good at. When Han Sen used the skill, it looked fairly
average. Yet, when she wanted to attack, she could not discern a
single flaw in his performance.</p>
<p>When she couldn’t find a flaw, it gave Jia Shi Zhen the feeling
of being in a crisis. It was as if she’d receive a deadly
counterattack if she dared try to strike. If that happened, the
next strike would determine life and death.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen stopped her actions. She looked very serious. She
looked at Han Sen’s sword skill, wanting to find a breaking
point.</p>
<p>Try as she might, Jia Shi Zhen could not help herself from
thinking about how incredibly weird Han Sen’s wonderful performance
of the sword skill was. It was like an endless sea full of danger.
It looked like a calm sea, but under the water, many beasts lurked
in wait.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen’s forehead started to produce sweat. She did not
dare move. If she moved, she was afraid she would be the recipient
of a very scary counterattack.</p>
<p>She never thought Calm and Calm, which was not a very powerful
skill, could produce such a scary mind and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen thought Han Sen was a mysterious individual. She
thought the sword skill he used was like an endless sea with many
scary tricks and things hiding beneath the waves.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen felt like she could not attack. She felt as if she
was a lone human facing an endless sea. The power made her feel
small and insignificant.</p>
<p>If she was able to use a gene race, she could have used its
special powers to fight back. Unfortunately, this was a fight based
purely on their sword skills. It made Jia Shi Zhen’s entire body
develop a sweat. Her clothes were wet. She was unable to move. If
she moved, it felt like Han Sen would cast a deadly skill and kill
her.</p>
<p>“Who is this Han Sen? How can his sword skills be so scary? It
was just a very normal skill, yet he has made it so scary. It is no
wonder he can teach Qin Bai a sword mind.” Jia Shi Zhen’s
impression of Han Sen had radically shifted.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen did not believe someone who had such good sword
skills and mind was an evil influencer like a dog.</p>
