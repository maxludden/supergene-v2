	<p>The red thing was an old turtle with a red shell that was the size of a grinding wheel.</p>

	<p>The turtle stood on two feet, and it swung the other two like clawed hands to grab White Elephant by the trunk.
		The turtle managed to unfurl the nose that had grabbed Hai’er and save her.</p>

	<p>The turtle and the elephant were engaged in a tug-of-war, with neither of them clearly winning. But the rocks all
		around were breaking, as if getting struck by hammers.</p>

	<p>White Elephant pulled back its trunk, and eventually lifted Old Turtle off the ground. It was fast, and Old
		Turtle’s body whipped through the air. The turtle had latched on tightly though, with flames blooming from its
		claws. It crawled up the trunk to reach Mister Elephant.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant moved, jumping off of the elephant. Then, White Elephant’s trunk extinguished the fire and said,
		“Sir, I will deal with the turtle.”</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant did not hesitate. He simply chased after Hai’er, who had run off.</p>

	<p>Hai’er was tricky, but she was only just a Baron. She was weaker than Mister Elephant, and he managed to catch up
		easily. Mister Elephant hastily approached Hai’er, saying, “Lady Hai’er, leave the item behind and I will
		pretend I never saw you.” “Didn’t I give you the eggs?” Hai’er asked innocently.</p>

	<p>“If you still don’t understand, I will have to be rude.” Mister Elephant didn’t hesitate again, and he moved to
		grab hold of Hai’er.</p>

	<p>Hai’er was frightened, and she stumbled back. She tried to dodge but couldn’t. So, the precise moment that Mister
		Elephant was about to grab her by the shoulders, Hai’er drew a soft sword from her waistbelt. It was like water,
		and it rushed at Mister Elephant’s hands.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant seemed to recognize it, and so he jerked back his hands and said, “The Pirate Bone Sword? It
		seems as if your rank amongst the Pirates is higher than I thought.”</p>

	<p>“It’s good that you acknowledge this. Now get lost!” Hai’er spoke, with the sword raised.</p>

	<p>“Even though you are of the Pirates, and a first daughter at that, you have disobeyed the Abandoned Thief’s vow.
		They can’t stand for you any longer.” Mister Elephant was not afraid, and he moved to grab her again.</p>

	<p>Hai’er used her Pirate Bone Sword to fight him. The blade switched between being hard and soft on a whim. When it
		was hard, it was like steel. When it was soft, it was like a ribbon. It went well with Hai’er’s strange sword
		skills, and her strange swordlights. Although Mister Elephant was stronger, it did not seem as if he could do
		anything.</p>

	<p>“Women are born actresses.” When Han Sen had seen Hai’er’s techniques before, he knew she hadn’t been trying her
		best What he was witnessing now were the best skills she possessed.</p>

	<p>But most of Han Sen’s focus was on the bone sword. It was composed of a very strange material. It was thin like
		the spine of a cactus; all soft and weird.</p>

	<p>The swordlights it emitted were even stranger. They were things that not even Mister Elephant dared to touch.</p>

	<p>Han Sen watched the fight with his Dongxuan Aura. The sword was inferior to the Archangel Bone Arrow, but
		superior to the horn arrows. It could have been an Earl or Marquis treasure.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was very good when it came to the bow and sword. If he could find a good sword to complement his bow,
		he’d have a great time hunting xenogeneics.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant was afraid of the sword and the swordlight. But he was one class above her, and his techniques
		were good, too.</p>

	<p>He pulled out an ancient sword to fight against hers. He was careful, managing to evade every single swordlight
		as he tried to push her towards a stone wall she could not escape from.</p>

	<p>White Elephant was still engaged in combat with Old Turtle. Their clashing powers were sundering the very
		mountain.</p>

	<p>White Elephant was so powerful, but Old Turtle was very swift. It was difficult to determine which would be the
		victor.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at Old Turtle’s movements. If his turtle shell had not been red, Han Sen would have believed him
		to be one of the ninja turtles.</p>

	<p>White Elephant and Old Turtle were xenogeneics. They were both Earl class. Han Sen took one look at their fight,
		and he knew that he could not kill either of them. Not even the horn arrows could pierce their skin.</p>

	<p>But Han Sen still had one hope, despite it all. He fancied the idea of using the Archangel Bone Arrow to kill one
		of them.</p>

	<p>That would make for a fine reward.</p>

	<p>His transformation time would be limited, though; Han Sen believed he’d only be able to fire the arrow once. Even
		if he managed to kill one, he’d be unable to eat the body, but it’d at least benefit the others.</p>

	<p>So, Han Sen was just watching for now. He was hoping to find the right time to strike.</p>

	<p>White Elephant and Old Turtle were both strong, and it looked as if neither of the two would get tired. Many
		fires scorched the rocks all around them, as the elephant’s trunk smashed everything in its path. The
		mountainside was looking terrible.</p>

	<p>But they both managed to avoid the spot where Mister Elephant and Hai’er were fighting. They didn’t want to hurt
		them.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, Hai’er was doing bad on her own. Her bone sword and skills managed to block Mister Elephant’s
		strikes, but her endurance was not as high as a Viscount’s. Under the constant pressure of the fight, she soon
		exhausted all her power. Her subsequent strikes weren’t half as strong, and her speed fell off, as well.</p>

	<p>Han Sen could see Hai’er was doing poorly. If this continued and Mister Elephant managed to steal her item, it
		could be difficult to find again.</p>

	<p>Seeing White Elephant and Old Turtle still locked in combat, Han Sen had a thought. So, he summoned his Gold
		Feather Bow and planted a horn arrow on the string.</p>

	<p>Hai’er’s face looked glum, and things were continuing to go poorly for her.</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>Hai’er accidentally let Mister Elephant slap her hand. The Pirate Bone Sword fell to the ground.</p>

	<p>The Pirate Bone Sword was rare, but he didn’t dare touch it. It was a weapon that high level Pirates could wield.
		It wouldn’t be a good idea for an outsider to touch it</p>

	<p>“Miss Hai’er, hand over the item. Or do you want me to do it?” Mister Elephant had pushed her into a corner, and
		she could no longer fight back.</p>

	<p>“I have lost this time, so here. Take it” Hai’er pulled out an item and threw it at him.</p>

	<p>Mister Elephant did not catch it, though. He let it fall to the ground first Pang!</p>

	<p>It landed on the ground and exploded. A flash of light arose, and as everyone watched the display, Hai’er grabbed
		her Pirate Bone Sword and tried stabbing Mister Elephant.</p>

	<p>But Mister Elephant fell back and dodged the attack. Unfortunately for him, his chest was still cut open, and he
		began to bleed.</p>

	<p>Even Mister Elephant was afraid of the Pirates. He didn’t want to hurt her, but he was so angry, he shouted out
		like a golem. His body expanded, and his muscles tightened like steel. He punched the pirate sword, sending
		Hai’er and the blade flying back into the mountain wall.</p>
