1672 He Is Differen

Inside Han Manor, Ji Yanran was holding Littleflower and talking to Luo Lan. Zero was sitting near them.

Suddenly, Luo Lan stood up from the sofa, her face grim.

Ji Yanran looked at Luo Lan and noticed something was amiss. She held Littleflower tight and stood up off the sofa, as well. Pang!

One side of the house was blown up, and the garden went with it A giant black tiger that was the height of a grown man approached them from the outside.

He was wearing black crystal armor, and he didn’t walk robotically like an Al would.

“Give me the kid!” the black tiger said, looking at Littleflower.

“Animal, how dare you!” Luo Lan stood in front of Ji 丫anran and Littleflower. She spoke back to the tiger harshly and gestured for Ji Yanran to run off with the baby.

Ji Yanran did as instructed and fled. Before she could leave the room, though, the black tiger roared and leaped towards them.

But due to its speed being so great, Ji Yanran only saw the black tiger disappear. She felt nervous.

“D*mn.” Luo Lan’s face changed. She moved her hand and heard a dong sound. She had hit something.

The black tiger’s body re-appeared inside the house. Luo Lan had hit the tiger’s forehead, but she had not hurt him in the slightest. There was not even a mark on his armor.

Luo Lan was shocked that her Falsified-Sky powers had done nothing to the black tiger.

It wasn’t as if Falsified-Sky powers were useless, it was just because Luo Lan’s strength was far outclassed by the black tiger’s. She couldn’t break the armor.

The black tiger swung its paw and claws towards Luo Lan in retaliation, looking at her with great disdain. He had been in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary and obtained that armor from an officer. His power placed him among the Alliance’s best, and the powers of a surpasser would not be a concern.

The black tiger’s attacking paw was something Luo Lan could not dodge. There’d be no chance for her to escape.

Dong!

A bone knife appeared beneath the paws. Zero had blocked the strike, but the force sent her flying back into Luo Lan, and both of them crashed onto the ground.

*Boom!*

Zero stood up off the floor bleeding, but her blood was purple. Her eyes turned purple, then her hair followed. A pair of purple horns grew out of her skin.

“Shura?” The black tiger looked surprised, but it did not care. It did not matter who she was; as long as she did not have geno armor, there was nothing to be concerned about.

He increased the strength in his paws and leaped at Zero.

Zero’s hair moved like it was dancing. She evaded the strike of the claws and retaliated with a cut of the bone knife across the creature’s face.

Dong!

The Falsified-Sky power backed by the Bone Dagger was unable to penetrate the defense that armor provided. The black tiger headbutted Zero, and she slammed into a wall and broke it.

Luo Lan jumped towards her and pulled her out of the rubble. Zero slowly stood up, staring at the black tiger, and said, “Leave now.”

After that, Zero leaped toward the black tiger again.

Luo Lan tugged at Ji Yanran, prompting them to leave. But before they could get very far, the black tiger’s claw came down on Zero. She was delivered three deep clefts in her skin, and she was suddenly bleeding quite a lot.

Zero dodged the next direct attack, but the force still sent her flying one thousand meters with deep marks across her.

Seeing Zero bleeding and still wanting to fight the intruding black tiger, Luo Lan shouted to Ji Yanran, “Take Littleflower and run. Don’t look back.”

After that, Luo Lan jumped towards the black tiger. She knew Zero wouldn’t last in her current state.

“Mom!” Ji Yanran was shocked.

“Go, Littleflower!” Luo Lan said and flew, using her Falsified-Sky power against the black tiger.

Dong!

But Luo Lan was just a surpasses She wasn’t even a demigod. Her powers were far weaker than the black tiger with geno armor. She couldn’t even leave marks on its head.

The black tiger was irritated by Luo Lan, though. He attacked her before she could even react.

Zero pushed Luo Lan away, and her back was delivered a few more cuts. The shockwave from the claws tore a nearby building in half. That building was a dozen stories tall.

Blergh!

Zero fell in front of Luo Lan, bleeding profusely. There was a deep wound across her waist, which revealed the organs inside. Luo Lan picked up Zero with the intent of taking her away.

The black tiger saw Ji Yanran get into an aircraft. Since he was now short on time, he looked at Luo Lan and Zero and decided to stop trying to kill them. He jumped over to Ji Yanran.

Dong!

A bone-forged dagger fell from the sky and hit him on the head. The black tiger looked back and saw Zero being held by Luo Lan. Her hand was still extended from where she had thrown the knife.

The black tiger was enraged, and he attacked the aircraft and destroyed it. He turned around and jumped back to Zero. It looked like her hit had made the creature even angrier, and he wished to finish her off first.

Zero pushed Luo Lan away. She felt nothing in the face of that scary black tiger.

But Luo Lan pushed her to the side, smiled, and said, “You are like my daughter. And no mother would willingly watch her daughter die.”

Zero, who always looked emotionless, now had a conflicted expression. She wished to save Luo Lan, but she was too injured to do so. Before she could get up, the black tiger was in front of Luo Lan.

The black tiger wanted to kill Luo Lan right then, but he suddenly stopped and looked at Ji Yanran. The baby in Ji Yanran’s arms began to cry. And there was a scary presence in those tears. That was what made the black tiger stop.

The black tiger saw the lifeforce and looked at it in disbelief.

Littleflower’s body was glowing with a holy light The pupils were all white,and the hair grew obscenely long and white, too. The baby had suddenly become much stronger.

“He is different.” The black tiger looked very excited, and he ran straight for Littleflower.

Dong!

He crouched to leap forward and felt something hitting his legs. Luo Lan was hacking at them. And even though it may not have hurt, it was annoying.

The black tiger was going to grab the pesky Luo Lan and get rid of her.

“Take Littleflower.” Luo Lan knew she couldn’t run, so she just shouted at Ji Yanran instead of evading the incoming claws.

As the claws were about to land on Luo Lan, a hand suddenly appeared. It stopped the death-bringing claws in their tracks.
