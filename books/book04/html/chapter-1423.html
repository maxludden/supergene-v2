	<p>When the altar appeared, there was nothing that the creatures surrounding it could do. And almost immediately,
		they felt their lifeforces leave them, drifting towards the altar</p>

	<p>There were too many creatures, and so many lifeforces went towards the altar. They gathered up around the bust
		atop it.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s true self had acknowledged the summons while he was in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. He had already
		received news that the spirits had rebelled and were attacking the human shelters. So, now all he did was wait.
	</p>

	<p>He did not know if his blood was enough for him to be summoned, however. If he couldn’t be summoned back, then
		his mother and the humans of the Third God’s Sanctuary would be left to their own devices.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was starting to worry. He felt his body begin to burn. A strange sort of power was beginning to enter his
		body and swirl throughout.</p>

	<p>It was so powerful, it burned and had an effect on the area around him. He could feel and then see the dimension
		he was in begin to twist.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought to himself, “I guess it worked. I suppose it should come as no surprise that all those emperors
		and super creatures make for a worthy-enough sacrifice to summon me.”</p>

	<p>As Han Sen was lost in thought, his body became stronger and he opened a rift. He was suddenly pulled into a
		tunnel of sorts, and all that was there was a portal.</p>

	<br>

	<hr />

	<br>

	<p>Sky Mountain, in the Third God’s Sanctuary.</p>

	<p>No God Emperor saw the altar and muttered a few words of spite. “D*mn it! Curse these vermin; how can they always
		manage to summon demigods like this!?”</p>

	<p>Summoning demigods was no easy feat, however. It required a Demi-God Geno Core that had been left behind somehow,
		in the Third God’s Sanctuary. Such relics were exceptionally difficult to come by.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had once summoned Lotus Empress’s mother to stop No God Emperor.</p>

	<p>This time, Luo Lan was summoning Han Sen himself. It seemed this could be a repeat occurrence, since the same
		relic had been used to achieve this twice since its discovery.</p>

	<p>No God Emperor knew he should make himself scarce and flee. He had witnessed the power that Night Empress
		possessed. What awaited them was not something a being of the Third God’s Sanctuary could resist.</p>

	<p>And although Han Sen had only been a demigod for a short amount of time, he grossly outperformed everyone and
		everything else that existed in the Third God’s Sanctuary. No God Emperor wasn’t going to underestimate what the
		young man.</p>

	<p>Many of the creatures and spirits there had no clue what was occurring, while those that did spared no time in
		trying to run off.</p>

	<p>But before they could do that, they suddenly felt as if they had no place in that world.</p>

	<p>They couldn’t feel their bodies, and even if they could run, they weren’t sure where they could go.</p>

	<p>They were robbed of their senses, and they were unable to see or hear anything.</p>

	<p>They could not even smell, either. It was only them there, they could see, and the altar.</p>

	<p>What they could see was just that altar. It was like nothing else existed now.</p>

	<p>No God Emperor did his best to try and escape, but he could not even feel his body and his beloved No God Sword.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen had broken his No God Sword once before, and it had been tremendously difficult for him to get it back.
		And strangely, now, he could no longer feel the sword he was grossly atatched to.</p>

	<p>“Is he stronger than Night Empress?” No God Emperor was in shock. He was starting to suspect he might not escape
		this time.</p>

	<p>All the creatures and spirits in the region were feeling hopeless. They trembled in terror and worry. They
		couldn’t sense their comrades around them, and they each felt lost and alone.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s true body then appeared out of the statue. Each step shook the earth, increasing the pain and sense of
		hopelessness they all felt.</p>

	<p>“I am back.” Han Sen was fairly excited, as he was doing something only a very small handful of demigods could
		amange to accomplish.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t feel as free as he might. Perhaps it really was difficult for those from the Fourth
		God’s Sanctuary to remain, because it felt as if he was trying to breathe through mud.</p>

	<p>But he could feel the power inside him dwarf everything else in his proximity. Power that did not amount to much
		in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary was truly a devastating force to any being that resided in the Third God’s
		Sanctuary.</p>

	<p>Dongxuan Aura had stripped the enemies of their senses. The enemies could no longer feel themselves. They could
		see Han Sen approach from where he was, but that was it. They could not even move their fingers. Not even Ruin
		Emperor and No God Emperor could do anything.</p>

	<p>Queen looked at Han Sen with much admiration and joy. She had missed him, after all he had done for her. She
		never expected Han Sen could return after leaving for the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>

	<p>The situation that once looked like oblivion suddenly changed for the better.</p>

	<p>He was a demigod, and in this sanctuary he was practically invincible.</p>

	<p>Just seeing those emperors and super creatures around, and the way they reacted, you could tell how powerful and
		how much of a presence Han Sen had. The once ravenous hordes of enemies were all paralyzed before him.</p>

	<p>“Son, these bad people are bullying your poor pretty mother.” When Luo Lan spoke, she did so with light tears in
		her eyes, as if she had been subjected to bullying.</p>

	<p>When the spirits heard her say this, they thought to themselves, “What?! You practically laid waste to us, and we
		haven’t yet touched a single hair on your head.</p>

	<p>We didn’t bully you at all.”</p>
