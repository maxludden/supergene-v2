<h2>Sword Slashes Weapon God</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3203</h3>

<p>A snow-white spear flew out of the arsenal behind Weapon God. It
landed in front of Weapon God. His two hands gripped the long
spear. The long spear’s spear mind went into the sky. Han Sen and
the others felt chills run down their spines as the mountains and
fields around started to shake. Things were shattering everywhere.
The spear-type weapons on the ground exploded with scary power. It
released many spear lights that shocked the sky. They were all
headed toward the long spear in Weapon God’s hands.</p>
<p>The long spear absorbed the power of the sky full of spears. The
spear god light grew increasingly stronger. The snow-white spear’s
body and fire turned black. It was like an inky fire spear light
was breaking through space. It shook along the body of the
spear.</p>
<p>“A Break World power!” Han Sen was a little bit surprised, but
he immediately reacted.</p>
<p>Soldier Knife Sky’s gene races were a bit weird. They were not
purely gene races. The buffer zone between the two universes was
tainted by the geno universe a bit. Although the effect was
minimal, many spear gene race powers had gathered atop Weapon God’s
big spear so that the spear could force and break the world.</p>
<p>“Break World Spear Kill!” Weapon God coldly shouted. The tip of
the big spear in his hands created a cold light that was madly
going toward Han Sen. The light was fast, cruel and accurate. Its
power was very focused. It had scary features that made it seem
indestructible.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s sword was not weird. The Inch Grey Sword went straight
to meet with the tip of the spear. Seeing the Inch Grey Sword was
about to strike the tip of the spear, the tip of the spear’s gold
light suddenly split. It created a meteor shower with lots of
stars. They covered Han Sen from top to bottom and blocked every
possible avenue he could take advantage of to evade the strike.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan Yellow Sutra
were cast together. They smashed through the world. The Inch Grey
Sword in his hands was breaking and slashing.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The light of the spear was shattered by the Inch Grey Sword. At
the same time, the big spear that had gathered up countless spear
gene race power was broken.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked about how powerful the Inch Grey Sword was.
His Break World power was not just an attacking power, yet it could
break the Break World big spear. It had obviously benefitted by how
sharp the Inch Grey Sword was.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder it is a sword that the master used,” Weapon God
said to himself. His eyes also looked brighter. His hands were wide
open. The weaponry on his back was glowing. All the weapons started
to glow.</p>
<p>Knives, spears, swords, halberds, axes, onoes, hooks, tridents,
and various other weapons flickered with a shocking god light. The
entire ocean of weapons that populated Soldier Knife Sky glowed
with mesmerizing light. All that light went to imbue the array of
weaponry behind Weapon God.</p>
<p>There were many types of weapons within that arsenal. The entire
Soldier Knife Sky’s weapon gene races looked as if they had been
summoned by a god. They all gave their power to the weaponry.</p>
<p>The power was not the power of all the gene races, but it was
like a Soldier Knife Sky mini world. The creatures of the world all
lent it a part of their power. How scary was this power that had
gathered up?</p>
<p>The armor that Weapon God wore beneath that scary power
underwent some changes. It turned pitch-black. Scary black flames
were burning on it. It was like space was burning alongside it.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked a bit dim. He spoke to Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand
Mile Reach, saying, “You guys get the crown prince out of here for
now. I’ll handle things here.”</p>
<p>Weapon God had borrowed the world’s power, so he knew he should
not underestimate him. Even if Han Sen was not afraid, he was
afraid of the battle power having an adverse effect on Qin Bai.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, safety first!” Thousand Mile Reach shouted. He
picked up Qin Bai, ripped space, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen wanted to pick up Bao’er, but the girl was quick to
leap onto Han Sen’s shoulder. So, she flew away solo.</p>
<p>They were powerful, but they were only as powerful as humans. If
they did not combine with a God Spirit, no one would dare fight a
God Spirit elite.</p>
<p>е</p>
<p>Weapon God did not care for the small critters fleeing the
scene. All he cared for was the Inch Grey Sword. It looked as if
the sword mattered a lot to him.</p>
<p>“Go to hell!” Weapon God opened his hands. The weaponry behind
him shattered. They turned into a hundred kinds of different
weapons. Every weapon had a scary Break World power. All of it was
going for Han Sen. Han Sen’s eyes froze. The Break World power
exploded. The Inch Grey Sword in his hands slashed. Suddenly, he
broke a few weapons. No matter how sharp the Inch Grey Sword was,
breaking those big weapons was sure to take time. By the time he
broke a few weapons, the rest of the weapons had reached Han Sen’s
body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body suddenly turned into a white shadow. He looked
like a God Spirit with a semi-transparent body that had white light
that could explode. His body power moved.</p>
<p>The weapons with Break World power slashed against Han Sen’s
Super God Spirit mode. It was like they were coming down on cotton.
They only made the Super God Spirit cave in. They did not break his
form.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Inch Grey Sword to protect Bao’er on his
shoulder</p>
<p>“It looks like not all the Break World powers can damage my
Super God Spirit. Moon God’s level is nothing comparable to this
Weapon God.” Han Sen’s heart felt a whole lot safer. He saw all the
weapons come down on his body while his body shone with a god light
that shook them all away.</p>
<p>“What!” Seeing the sky full of flying and dancing break into
pieces, Weapon God’s face looked extremely shocked. That was an
incredibly powerful power to witness. He had only seen the God
Chaos Party leader do something comparable.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked cold. The Inch Grey Sword in his hands moved. He
suddenly ripped space and made Weapon God’s giant armor-clad self
be split in two.</p>
<p>“Without the rules of the universe suppressing, I feel
wonderful. It looks like my Super God Spirit mode is still stronger
than the Break World power.” Han Sen felt incredibly good. Without
restrictions and combined with his battle power, Super God Spirit
mode was not something an Annihilation God Spirit could
overcome.</p>
<p>He was just a beginner when it came to Break World powers. When
talking about his progress with Break World powers, one could say
he was not as good as Weapon God. His Blood-Pulse Sutra and Xuan
Yellow Sutra’s Break World power didn’t focus on combat, so they
were not as effective as Han Sen using his Super God Spirit
mode.</p>
<p>Weapon God’s body turned into starlight, and he faded away. Of
course, he did not die. Han Sen knew his true body was still in the
god temple being reborn. If the god base was still there, it would
never die.</p>
<p>When he looked at Weapon God Temple, Han Sen’s body teleported
straight into it. Weapon God was in the middle of respawning atop
the altar.</p>
<p>“I need more god bases. Thank you for your kindness.” Han Sen
raised his Inch Grey Sword and slashed it toward the altar of
Weapon God’s body.</p>
<p>The white Super God Spirit power generated a sword light. It was
like a knife that could slay the sky. It made the god altar and
Weapon God being regenerated be split in half. The powerful sword
light cut the entire temple in half.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach escorted Qin Bai over to
the rendezvous with Jian Bu Gu. They looked back and saw a sword
light come from a weird god temple and burst into the sky,
splitting the giant Weapon God Temple in two. It crumbled like a
mountain. The ground and mountains nearby quaked.</p>
