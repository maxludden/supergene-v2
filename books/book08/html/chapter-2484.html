<p>“You don’t look like someone who would become a traitor. Can you
tell me more about your past?” Han Sen asked with a look of great
curiosity. He was still sitting behind Lando on the Tianxia Unicorn
as they made their way out of the system.</p>
<p>He thought there had to be more to the story of Lando slaying
his teacher. With Lando’s power, assassinating a deified would have
been incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Plus, there shouldn’t have been a reason for him to kill his own
mentor. By doing so, he only would have gained the animosity of his
own race and the distrust of others. There was no benefit.</p>
<p>“You are wrong. I really am a traitor that killed his teacher,”
Lando said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me why?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Lando hesitated. Han Sen noticed and quickly said, “I don’t
believe that you would kill your teacher for no reason. But if you
don’t want to tell me about it, that’s fine. I won’t push.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s strategy of backing off the subject worked. Although
it took Lando some time to respond, he eventually said, “It’s not
like I’m trying to keep the story a secret. It’s just that if I
told people, they wouldn’t believe me anyway.”</p>
<p>“I would believe you,” Han Sen said with certainty.</p>
<p>“If I told you I was my teacher, would you believe it?” Lando
asked, turning around to stare into Han Sen’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m… not sure what to make of that statement. What do you
mean?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Lando faced forward again. They continued to fly forward for a
long, quiet moment.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s curiosity was amped up even more. He was afraid that
Lando might refuse to discuss the subject any further, but
fortunately, Lando again broke the silence. “You saw the Demon Hell
Dragon Tattoo on my back, did you not? You know what that is?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Han Sen shook his head. “Isn’t that some kind of
treasure?”</p>
<p>Lando explained the basics of what the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo
was and how it worked. Then he said, “People think my master worked
hard for 10,000 years to obtain that Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. But
that isn’t what happened at all. He found an easier way.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Han Sen felt a shiver pass through him. He
had an intuition about where this story was going.</p>
<p>Lando went on to say, “He tried it before, but the pain was too
much for even a deified being to endure. It wasn’t long before he
gave up on the idea, but he really wanted Dragon One’s position,
and he needed more power in order to claim it. So, he came up with
a plan. And that is why I’m here today.”</p>
<p>“In order to be successfully created and wielded, the Demon Hell
Dragon Tattoo needed a body as a base. But Dragon Two found a way
to circumvent the need to endure that pain. He used his genes to
create a duplicate of himself. Then he set that clone to practicing
with the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. When the process was complete,
he planned to take the tattoo for himself. Because the clone had
been created from his own genes, there wouldn’t have been any
compatibility issues. It would have been just like he had practiced
with the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo himself.”</p>
<p>“That means that the person who suffered for 10,000 years was
you?” Han Sen demanded angrily.</p>
<p>Lando nodded. “Because I was merely cloned from his genes, I
didn’t possess deified powers. Before I could practice with the
Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo, I had to achieve King class powers at the
very least. So, he let me start practicing. And to prevent the
chance of there being compatibility issues further down the line, I
learned all the same skills that he had learned in his youth.”</p>
<p>“I was just a genetic clone. I didn’t have memories, and I
couldn’t think for myself. I was like a baby. I only had the
knowledge, thought processes, and powers that I was given. Other
Dragons believed that I was his student. And his favorite student,
at that. People thought he treated me like a son and gave me
everything. He taught me many secret skills, but no one knew he did
that for the sole purpose of replicating himself within me. If he
hadn’t trained me exactly the way he had been trained, he thought
there might be issues when he tried to harvest the Demon Hell
Dragon Tattoo.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart sank as he listened. A deified elite had created
and brainwashed a baby, all so he could inflict unimaginable pain
on the child to further his own power.</p>
<p>Lando probably hadn’t even fully understood why he was
suffering.</p>
<p>“If you were a clone, you guys must have looked identical. Did
no one else notice that?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Lando smiled, and that smile was chilling. “Changing one’s
appearance isn’t difficult. You just need to change a small number
of your genes. For a deified, such a task is easy.”</p>
<p>“That’s what he thought, at least. He made a tiny change to my
genes, just enough to alter my appearance. However, he never
expected that this minor difference would end up changing
everything.”</p>
<p>“Although I was his clone, the environment I was raised in was
different than Dragon Two’s childhood. As the years went by, the
tiny change he made to my genes was compounded by the differences
in environment.”</p>
<p>“It was a shame I didn’t know anything about this back then. I
thought I was his student, someone that he treated like his real
son. I just wanted to show gratitude for what he had done for me. I
wanted to finish the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. No matter the pain I
suffered, I forced myself to endure it. I pushed myself so hard
that I lost all feeling in my body.” After saying that, Lando
laughed. But Han Sen could tell that the laugh was forced. It was
Lando’s way of showing that he wasn’t afraid of what had happened
anymore.</p>
<p>Lando trailed off. Han Sen could guess what had happened next.
Dragon Two must have revealed his scheme as Lando practiced the
Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. Lando must have fought with him, and that
was why Dragon Two had died.</p>
<p>But Han Sen still didn’t understand how Lando managed to kill
Dragon Two. Even if he was Dragon Two’s genetic clone, he didn’t
have Dragon Two’s deified power.</p>
<p>Lando seemed to notice Han Sen’s unspoken question. He shook his
head and said, “It isn’t what you’re thinking. I didn’t fight him.
We transferred the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo to him, and he couldn’t
wait to practice and push the tattoo to the final stage. The
process went smoothly, just as he expected. The Demon Hell Dragon
Tattoo came entirely under his control, and he used his own blood
to refine it. The blend was a success, and there didn’t seem to be
any problems. Then, once the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo reached
deified class, he discovered that the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo had
a very strong compatibility issue.”</p>
<p>“Imagine a man who has just had a heart transplant discovered
that there was a compatibility issue. He went insane. He had
already used more than half of his blood to push the Demon Hell
Dragon Tattoo to deified status. The Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo was
to be stronger than himself.”</p>
<p>“So, he died. And you took back the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo.
Why were you labeled a traitor?” Han Sen still didn’t
understand.</p>
<p>Lando quietly said, “In the end, he couldn’t handle the thought
of his impending death. He tried to take my body, hoping that he
could use my body to survive and regain control over the Demon Hell
Dragon Tattoo.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like this story,” Han Sen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it, either,” Lando said.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to say something more, but something suddenly
appeared in front of them. It came right toward Han Sen before he
even had a chance to react.</p>
<p>“A deified Demon?” When Han Sen got close enough to see the body
clearly, he raised his eyebrows.</p>
