<h2>Returning to the Red Mist Valley</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1890</h3>

<p>Han Sen thought about it, though, and he decided that the bike
was probably quite suitable for someone like Wang Yuhang. If the
man could use it to escape things chasing him, then it would be
useful enough. Perhaps when the armament evolved some more, it
would develop other abilities.</p>
<p>Yisha learned nothing from her trip to Planet Crooked Rock. All
the factions were now in search of Purgatory Heaven, but no one had
turned up any leads yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to take Wang Yuhang to explore the Red Mist
Valley, but Yisha gave Han Sen a call and told him they needed to
talk about something important.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to meet with her, all the while thinking over any
trace of evidence he might have left suggesting what had really
gone down on Planet Crooked Rock. He didn’t think he had,
though.</p>
<p>When they met, she said, “Buddha Ambassador will be visiting
Narrow Moon, and there will be a meeting. If you have nothing
important that requires your immediate attendance, I suggest you
attend,” Yisha said.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt some relief, hearing what she wanted. She didn’t
want to talk about Planet Crooked Rock and the missing Icebird
Duke. Knowing this, he felt much more at ease.</p>
<p>“Queen, why would the Buddha visit Narrow Moon? What is all this
going to be about?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Yisha said, “The Rebate are quite friendly with the Buddha. We
are close allies. The meeting is a formality to sustain our
friendship and exchange geno arts. The people who can join the
get-together are usually the best of the best.” Yisha paused for a
moment, before going on to say, “The Rebate usually send in members
of the Moon Garden. You may not be one of them, but you can still
observe the proceedings. The geno arts of the Buddhas are fairly
unique, and it might be quite useful for you to learn them. Even if
you cannot try them out, you can watch them, at least.”</p>
<p>Yes, my queen; I will take a look.” Han Sen did not know what
the point of going there actually was, but if Yisha was telling him
he should go, he thought there had to be more to it.</p>
<p>But Yisha didn’t explain any further, so he didn’t ask.</p>
<p>Yisha spoke about the Buddha, though. And it jogged Han Sen’s
memory about something.</p>
<p>After Buddha King was killed by Guya, Han Sen had found two
items. One was a Buddha necklace, and the other was a scroll.</p>
<p>The scroll was scrawled in the text of the Buddha. After its
translation, Han Sen learned that it was about a geno art called
Unlimited Sutra.</p>
<p>Han Sen checked it out. The main part of the text pertained to
evolving, which was practically useless where Han Sen was
concerned. He wasn’t interested in a technique that could generate
a geno armor.</p>
<p>What did interest him, though, were the additions of smaller
techniques around the main body of text. It was interesting, and it
helped Han Sen understand more about the Buddha.</p>
<p>The Buddha necklace was a high-class treasure, but Han Sen could
not use it. Maybe the user required a certain blood lineage or a
special power of some sort.</p>
<p>Yisha was allowing Han Sen to participate in the event, and Han
Sen thought it might give him a look into Unlimited Sutra. That
would only further his knowledge about the Buddha.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Han Sen left, Yisha picked up a book and got to reading
it. She was in a foul mood. Icebird Duke was still missing,
someplace on Planet Crooked Rock. And Yisha had no clue whether she
was alive or dead.</p>
<p>The spots for properly taking part in the event were only
available to members of the Moon Garden. But now, the ten Kings of
Narrow Moon—aside from two Kings that did not have any students of
their own—could allow their students and children to attend.</p>
<p>It was only Yisha’s student that wasn’t allowed a spot in the
proceedings. Hers was relegated to spectating. It made her feel
quite poorly.</p>
<p>Yisha still allowed Han Sen to go there, though, because she
wanted Han Sen to learn more.</p>
<p>There was something else that made her eager for him to go, too.
Han Sen was not a member, so if he was challenged by one of the
Buddha students, the challenge couldn’t happen.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to the base and got back to reading Unlimited
Sutra. Then, he gave Wang Yuhang a call. He also called the others
and told them all to rendezvous at Red Mist Valley.</p>
<p>The mist in Red Mist Valley was thick. It could be clearly seen
from as far as ten miles away. The mist resembled fiery clouds.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was Planet Eclipse. The magnetic storms and
vortexes in the sky were scary. No one could see such things from
the sky, and so many of the planet’s secrets had yet to be
discovered.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, all of this hinges on you,” Han Sen told Wang
Yuhang as he pointed down into the valley.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhuang was wearing the Marquise armor, and he confidently
gave Han Sen a don’t worry gesture. “I will handle this. I’m good
at this sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang summoned his bike and rode it towards the
valley.</p>
<p>He didn’t speed straight in. At first, he skirted the entrance
before spinning around. He shouted out towards the valley,
“Everyone hanging out in this mist, listen! Grampa Wang is here! If
you guys don’t come out of here, I’ll destroy you!”</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang shouted, and then a sudden chorus of screams erupted
from within the mist. And then, many fiery shadows started to
emerge, coming straight for him.</p>
<p>“Mama mia!” Wang Yuhang put his foot down on the pedal and
escaped with his bike. The bike’s speed was very good for a Baron
armament, but compared to the fiery shadows, it was actually quite
slow. He had only made it a few meters before the shadows had
caught up with him.</p>
<p>There was a pang and Wang Yuhang crashed his bike. He was sent
flying a dozen meters before he hit the ground. He rolled quite a
bit before coming to a total stop.</p>
<p>Luckily, Wang Yuhang was wearing the Marquise armor. If he
hadn’t, he’d have been a dead man by now.</p>
<p>But even though he had the armor, he still felt very dizzy. He
picked himself up off the ground, and soon enough, a fiery shadow
was before him again. It knocked him away once more.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Gu Qingcheng, and Xie Qing King finally noticed that
the fiery shadow was a beast shrouded in red mist. It looked a
mink, with three eyes.</p>
<p>The red mist looked as if it was actually under the red beast’s
control. Every time the creature attacked, though, it left marks
across Wang Yuhang’s armor.</p>
<p>“Quick! I’m going to die!” Wang Yuhang screamed as the creature
happily tossed him around. The beast could not break the Marquise
armor, but the force with which it shook him was still enough to
have him spewing blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen put on his rabbit shoes. Without hesitation, he leaped
towards the little monster and swung his Ghost Teeth Knife, which
was swirling with purple light.</p>
<p>There was no one else around, so he did not have to hide
anything. He used his Jadeskin’s godlight—which was Viscount
class—with the Ghost Teeth Knife’s knifemind, and struck the beast.
It cut through the shadow and left behind a cleft on the creature’s
skin.</p>
