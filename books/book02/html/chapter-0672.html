    <p>
      After the bear&#8217;s manic slaughter of evolvers, bodies and blood lay
      strewn across the snow. Those who joined the fray looking for an easy
      kill, and had been left alive, were green in their faces. They wished they
      could grow an additional two legs to run off faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was something wrong with the bear&#8217;s head. It didn&#8217;t care
      for much of anything, and it sought to kill anyone and anything that
      crossed its path indiscriminately. With the bodies disfigured and slumped
      across each other on the icy drifts, heaven knew how many it had happily
      killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though Han Sen wanted to stop it, he didn&#8217;t have the strength
      right now. His energy had yet to recover from his first usage of
      Elephant-Rex Strike, so he couldn&#8217;t use it again just yet. And
      ordinary strikes were useless against the rampaging behemoth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could only hope his energy would recover soon. If he could wallop
      the bear with one more Elephant-Rex Strike, it would surely perish.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh no! The frosty bear is headed towards one of my knight-class
      shelters.&#8221; Li Xinglun&#8217;s face changed. He called out to Wang
      Yuhang, saying, &#8220;Little Uncle, you have to draw it away!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang, with a depressed look on his face, said, &#8220;I assure you,
      I am trying. But the fiend is no longer right in the head! It won&#8217;t
      pay me heed as it once did.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun&#8217;s eyes turned red. He rushed ahead, attempting to
      evacuate the shelter that the bear was approaching. When the frosty bear
      saw it, the beast made no delay in targeting it. The people inside would
      not have enough time to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a shelter oriented around business, so most of the people inside
      didn&#8217;t even know how to fight. If the frosty bear entered,
      it&#8217;d be a massacre. Blood would run up and down the walls as it
      hacked and hewed the people inside with little to no resistance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people inside the shelter had witnessed the bear&#8217;s previous
      killing spree out on the tundra. It created mass chaos and panic, as
      people climbed over each other in a bid to escape with their lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The halls were clogged with people as they rushed out in disheveled
      unison. The gates were congested with the maddened people, which made
      evacuation efforts even slower.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun kept firing arrows at the frosty bear&#8217;s wounds, but that
      only enraged it further. Its violence was only increasing, perhaps in
      response to its near-death state. It wanted to lash out in one last blaze
      of blood and terror before it succumbed to its wounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked and frowned. Although the shelter belonged to Li Xinglun,
      every shelter across the Icefield paid taxes, which helped to line Han
      Sen&#8217;s pockets with cash. This shelter in particular was amongst the
      highest-paying shelters when it came to taxes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t want his income reduced, and neither did he want to
      see people slain. His energy had yet to recover, so he couldn&#8217;t use
      Elephant-Rex Strike again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The frosty bear drew near the shelter and threw its weight against the
      wall, as if it were trying to claw its way over. Its front paws created
      deep scratch marks on the surface of the wall. With its frosty air, it
      tried to climb the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people in the shelter, beyond those walls, screamed in fear. The wall
      was all that separated them from the frosty bear. They could see it,
      though; all murderous and mad-looking. The caved-in skull and bloody face
      only made it look even more fearsome. It was like a scary giant that ate
      people, and any second now, it&#8217;d be over the wall and ready to dine
      on the buffet of helpless residents.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw the frosty bear perched up against the wall of the shelter. He
      gritted his teeth, flapped his wings to pick up speed, and soared down
      towards his enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone watched Han Sen descend from the sky to land, with a giant
      fire-wreathed weapon in hand. It looked like an XXL drill head that was
      spinning at max speed. It looked terribly powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go to hell, bear! Eat my flaming asshole-cracker!&#8221; Han Sen
      leapt into the air, his war cry emboldening his spirit. The fiery rex
      spike was aimed at the butthole of the frosty bear, which was still up
      against the wall. With a tremendous thrust, Han Sen rammed his weapon up
      its anus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fire blazed and blood gushed as the two meter long drill ground inside the
      bear&#8217;s posterior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart was skipping like mad, and his bones groaned under
      the thundering power he had summoned. Han Sen had once again pushed his
      strength to the max, and with both hands clutching the weapon, he shoved
      it as deep as it could go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Half of the spinning rex spike had been pushed in, streams of blood
      squirting into the wind like petals on the breeze.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone who watched this scene was frozen in place, without motion. The
      strike they had just witnessed made them extremely happy, though the
      muscles in their buttocks clenched tighter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Roar!&#8221; The frosty bear let out a painful cry. It attempted to
      turn around and grab Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen let go of the Flaming Rex Spike to dodge, and when he was
      clear, he kicked the handle of the protruding rex spike seven times. Every
      kick was like a hammer, malleting a peg deeper and deeper into the brown
      earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the seventh kick, Han Sen shouted to the sky. He drew what remained
      of his power to his fists and punched the handle of the rex spike, the
      only part that had not been driven inside the bear. After that, the entire
      Flaming Rex Spike was inside its body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blood cascaded from its behind, as the bear cried out. But its yelp was
      cut short as the body slumped down to the ground heavily. It resulted in a
      quake that vibrated the entire shelter.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Hunted: Giant Frosty Bear. The Beast Soul Has Not
        Been Acquired. The Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You May
        Harvest Its Life Geno Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Obtain A
        Random Numeric Amount Of Super Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To
        Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen heard the familiar voice but was disappointed not to receive the
      beast soul, despite the incredible difficulty he had in slaying the super
      creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen had to expect it sometime. Still, he did have a high drop-rate
      of beast souls when it came to super creatures. Of course, no one would
      mind an extra goody for performing a trying task, and the same applied to
      Han Sen. Therefore, he had been hopeful that he&#8217;d be able to procure
      the frosty bear&#8217;s beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone&#8217;s eyes opened wide in bewilderment, watching Han Sen return
      to the skies like a god. No one spoke a word, and the area was deathly
      quiet.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, after a period of silence had passed, the evolvers inside the
      shelter began to celebrate his triumph. Someone shouted, &#8220;Hail to
      the leader!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The others who had just escaped death joined in, chanting, &#8220;Hail to
      the leader!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hail to the Asshole-Cracker God!&#8221; The lead chanter changed
      the chant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countless others followed suit once again, shouting, &#8220;Hail to the
      Asshole-Cracker God!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The voices rumbled to the sky and Han Sen almost plummeted back down after
      hearing the joyous cries. He actually felt kind of awkward. If he still
      had the strength, he&#8217;d go back down, find out who started such a
      ridiculous chant, and kill him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The frosty bear&#8217;s body disappeared. Han Sen grabbed the fist-sized
      ice crystal from where the corpse once lay and flew away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The news of Han Sen&#8217;s triumph over the frosty bear spread far and
      wide across the Icefield, but the news of Ji Qing&#8217;s own slaying of a
      super creature had yet to be announced. Ordinary people did not know about
      the existence of super creatures, and so it was believed that Han Sen had
      only slain an extra strong sacred-blood creature. No one knew it was a
      super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the people who witnessed the fight that transpired on that day
      recounted the tale of Han Sen cracking open a giant, frosty bear&#8217;s
      anus many times. And this story is what earned Han Sen the title
      &#8220;Asshole-Cracker God.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>When people heard this story, they wanted to know more about it.</p>
