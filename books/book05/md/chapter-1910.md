  Han Sen found a hidden place in Red Mist Valley. He was going to wait for the spring to burst.

He also hunted down many of the Viscount creatures that were around, in order to collect their materials and genes.

There were three or four days left now, according to the schedule Yisha had proposed. And over the course of those next few days, more and more creatures gathered. Han Sen guessed that there had to be around ten thousand in total, with most of them being Viscount. It was fortunate that no creature of a higher tier had come. If they had, Han Sen could not have guaranteed that he would be the one to benefit from the spring.

Perhaps because they were all too greedy in their desire for the spring, many of the creatures fought against each other. He had never seen so much conflict before.

As Han Sen was watching those xenogeneics fighting outside the valley, he eventually caught sight of a few xenogeneics retreating. They abandoned their position. It seemed as if something strong was coming.

“It can’t be a higher class xenogeneic, can it?” Han Sen was shocked. He looked that way.

But there were too many xenogeneics there. Many were two meters tall, and they obscured Han Sen’s vision. He couldn’t see whatever was coming.

Han Sen looked around and stayed close to the wall. He wanted to scale it and get a better looked.

There was a dark green centipede. Each part of its body gleamed with jewel-like eyes as it skittered across the earth. Every xenogeneic in its path backed off as soon as they saw it. None dared to stay within twenty meters of the creature.

The xenogeneic was ten meters long, but it wasn’t tall. Its body was only half a meter off the ground. That was why Han Sen had such difficulty trying to spot it.

Han Sen watched it for quite some time, and he didn’t think it was all-that high level. It should have been no better than a Viscount, so it was weird to see the fear with which so many xenogeneics regarded it.

Quickly, the centipede xenogeneic reached the entrance of the valley. It was different from the other xenogeneics, and it crawled right into the valley.

Han Sen was shocked. Yisha said that the red mist spring was good for xenogeneics. It could speed up their evolution, but the red mist itself was harmful by comparison. Until the spring was ready, the mist remained there. So, it was most wise to avoid the mist until then.

But the centipede climbed straight into the valley, and it did so without getting harmed by the mist.

“No! I have got to find that centipede. If it is going towards the spring, it might be able to swallow it the moment it opens up. I’ll lose my own opportunity!” Han Sen frowned.

He hadn’t thought the centipede was going to climb down into the valley. And now that it was in there, it would be extremely difficult to find the creature. You couldn’t even see your own hand in front of you, that mist was so thick. Trying to find the centipede would be difficult.

“I’ll have to try. Luckily, it is just a Viscount xenogeneic. It cannot be that large of a threat.” Han Sen donned his Marquise armor and the rabbit shoes. He flew past the heads of the xenogeneics and headed straight into the valley.

Just like before, the mist stifled Han Sen’s senses. It was as if he was deaf and blind.

Han Sen searched through the mist, hoping to find the centipede xenogeneic.

The valley was massive, and there were still a few days to go before the spring was supposed to erupt. Han Sen thought he’d be able to find the centipede.

Han Sen walked more quickly through the mist, but he did not dare go too fast. If he ran into a rock wall and injured himself, he’d become a joke.

Due to him being unable to see, though, he tried hugging the walls as he went. Once he had canvased the area that way, he maintained a steady distance from the wall and went along them again.

After searching the place like a neatly-fitted carpet, he hadn’t caught sight of the centipede. Eight hours had elapsed by now.

“That xenogeneic was rather large. It shouldn’t be too difficult to find. Why am I so unlucky?” Han Sen felt depressed.

Han Sen walked into the deepest recesses of the valley, and when he reached the far wall, he wished to turn back. But that wall felt different from the others.

Han Sen kept running his hands over it, and eventually, he realized there was a space next to it. It was a cave.

Han Sen thought he was adequately protected, with the Marquise armor and the rabbit shoes, so he entered the cave.

After entering, Han Sen’s eyes gleamed brightly. The red mist was gone, and he could see all that resided in the cave.

The red mist was like a fire burning behind him. It lit up the cave. The cave did not have any of the mist inside, though. All of Han Sen’s senses had returned.

Han Sen looked deeper into the cave, and when he did, something made him quite happy. The giant centipede was inside there.

“Does the spring reside in this cave? No way. Yisha said the spring would have a darker mist. How can there be none at all?” Han Sen thought. He didn’t stop moving, though, and he planned to get rid of the centipede, just in case.

It looked like that xenogeneic was a very sensitive creature, though. It detected Han Sen’s presence quickly, and so it turned around and used its jewel-like eyes to look at him.

Boom!

As this occurred, the jewel-like eyes shone with a green light.

The green light was too bright, especially for a cave that was so small. It blinded the entire cave with that channel of light, prompting Han Sen to run forward.

“It’s lucky I have this Marquise armor. A light like this looks Viscount level at the lowest,” Han Sen thought to himself. He drew his Ghost Teeth Knife, and with his ice powers and blood, he cut towards the light.

Ghost Teeth Knife sliced through the green light. The light had a tangible presence, and it filled up the entire area. When it landed on Han Sen, he himself turned green.

Han Sen then realized he could no longer move. It was as if he had been stopped by a strange power. He was stuck in the same position, unable to move.

“Crap! There is something wrong with that light.” Han Sen was shocked. He hastily used his power, trying to break through the light that was snaring him. He wanted his freedom back.

Han Sen fired up Jadeskin, the Blood-Pulse Sutra, the Dongxuan Sutra, and The Story of Genes, but still, he was unable to escape the green light.

The centipede-like xenogeneic, with its jewel-like eyes focused on Han Sen, continued to pound him with green light.
