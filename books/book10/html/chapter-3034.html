	<p>“Found it… I finally found it… So many people died… We finally found it…”</p>

	<p>In a very dark underground cave, an underground river led to a waterfall. It had a very deep drop. A booming
		sound echoed to the very bottom of the water.</p>

	<p>If one looked closer, one would see that the underground river’s water was red. Bloody dragons roaring. All in
		all, there were nine of them.</p>

	<p>Eight people wearing rugged clothing stood next to the water. They stared into the water. All of them seemed to
		be extremely excited. As they stood there, their bodies shivered and shook.</p>

	<p>“Mister Yang, what is that thing in the water?” A middle-aged man looked at an elderly fellow with white hair.
		His vocal cords were trembling as he asked the question.</p>

	<p>The elder, who was called Mister Yang, looked around. He looked for a while and said, “This is certainly the
		place where the blood dragon returned to its nest. It is a place where the pulse is loud and clear. There is no
		doubting it. There truly must be a top-class gene egg inside there. The only thing I do not know is if it truly
		is the gene egg King Qin buried and the one that we are searching for. I have no idea, but you will have to
		figure that out for yourself, Mister Meng.” “I have faith. This has to be the right place. This must be where
		King Qin buried the gene egg. The gene egg must be in the water. Hurry up, go in there and pick up the gene
		egg.” Mister Meng saw the red light under the waterfall’s red basin, so hurried the others to go take a dunk and
		see precisely what it was.</p>

	<p>The people were a bit scared. With Mister Meng’s authority, they had no choice but to jump into the blood pool.
		They swam to the red light below the surface of the basin. Only Mister Meng and Mister Yang stood away and
		watched the pool.</p>

	<p>Not long later, the six people emerged from the water. Together, they exited the pool and brought forth the
		fabled item they had been in search of. It was a giant egg that was three-feet big.</p>

	<p>When the egg-shaped item was brought out of the basin, the water’s light disappeared. Only the egg remained
		glowing with a red light. The giant egg was like a bloody jade. It looked good.</p>

	<p>Seeing the weirdly pretty, big egg, everyone looked at it with greedy obsession. Mister Meng was so excited that
		he started talking nonsense. “This must be right. This is the gene egg. King Qin was born with bad blood. He was
		bullied when he was young. His sister Wan’er had very special blood that provided immeasurable talent. To help
		her brother, Wan’er gave King Qin her own blood. Then, they created the Qin Kingdom. But Wan’er lost her blood
		and became rubbish that could not practice. She got ill and died. If Wan’er had not lost her blood, she would
		have never become sick. King Qin blamed himself for that. He was miserable. It drove him absolutely crazy. He
		tried everything to make Wan’er come back to life. Everyone knew the Qin Kingdom was searching for immortality,
		but people never knew that it was not for himself. He did this for his dead sister Wan’er. King Qin found this
		legendary, top-class gene egg. He was hoping the gene power could make Wan’er come back to life.”</p>

	<p>“But their people could not come back to life. Wan’er was unable to be brought back to life. Without Wan’er, the
		entire world seemed to be pointless to King Qin. He threw away the gene egg. My ancestors were royal guards for
		King Qin. They knew that King Qin wanted to revive Wan’er here in this ancient, big god mountain. He knew that
		King Qin did not take the gene egg and never returned to this place again. Our ancestors did not really know
		where it was exactly though. After all, many generations have passed, and all those people died. I have finally
		found this gene egg. With this gene egg… The Meng family will become very famous…” After finishing talking,
		Mister Meng laughed. “Argh…” Before Mister Meng could put an end to his cackling, someone in the team screamed
		horribly. Soon after, it was not just a single person letting out cries. Each of the six people that had
		collected the gene egg from the bloody basin was on the ground screaming and rolling in tremendous agony.</p>

	<p>Mister Meng and Mister Yang were in shock by what was happening. People were writhing across the ground. Their
		bodies were rolling really quickly. They kept going on and on until they melted into blood water.</p>

	<p>“Mister… Save… Save us…” A few people reached out their hands. They were feeling extreme pain. They wanted to ask
		Mister Meng for help. Before they finished, they died.</p>

	<p>Their bones started to rot and become liquid. Within the blink of an eye, the six of them had turned into six
		puddles of blood water. There was not a single tuft of hair spared from the dissolution of their bodies.</p>

	<p>Mister Meng and Mister Yang were shocked by this. They tested the river water and did not discover anything
		weird. For this to happen so suddenly, it really was quite weird.</p>

	<p>Mister Meng was glad he had not touched the water in the pool.</p>

	<p>“Mister Yang, please help me take the gene egg back,” Mister Meng said to Mister Yang. Mister Yang’s face froze.
		He had a wry smile. “Mister Meng, I am just a mister. I did not practice.” Mister Meng’s eyes glistened as he
		said, “Do not worry, Mister Yang. They died because they touched the blood water. The gene egg by itself is
		fine. You do not need to worry.”</p>

	<p>Mister Yang thought, “If it is fine, then why don’t you carry it yourself?” Although he thought that, Mister Yang
		could not refuse. Under Mister Meng’s watch, he had no choice but to carefully walk toward the big red jade-like
		egg.</p>

	<p>Although the big egg was clean and had no blood water on it, Mister Yang did not attempt to touch it. He took off
		his clothes and wrapped them around the big egg. He tied a knot and picked it up. He was going to carry the big
		egg. When Mister Yang exerted strength, a “katcha” noise was heard. The jade-like big egg cracked. The crack was
		spreading across the egg’s shell.</p>

	<p>Mister Yang and Mister Meng were shocked. After a second, Mister Meng was excited. “God helped the Meng family. I
		never expected the gene egg to hatch now. I wonder what creature this legendary gene egg holds inside it.”</p>

	<p>Mister Yang looked at the cracked gene egg and said, “King Qin was the king of the Qin Kingdom. It was so long
		ago. Everything about him was just a legend. If the legends are true, this gene egg can hatch us a very rare
		gene</p>

	<p>race.”</p>

	<p>While they were talking, there was another “katcha” noise. The big egg’s crack was spreading. The red jade-like
		eggshell fell onto the floor in pieces.</p>

	<p>Mister Yang and Mister Meng looked at the broken eggshell with their eyes wide open. They were immediately
		frozen.</p>

	<p>A man who looked about 20 years old was inside the eggshell. He had black hair and crystal skin. He was curled up
		as if he had been sleeping.</p>

	<p>“Human… Humanoid… Gene race…” Mister Meng was so excited that his voice trembled.</p>
