Yisha allowed Han Sen to write down the content of The Story of Genes so she could look over it. She wanted to help Han Sen learn and modify the later parts to facilitate his practice.

Because the practice method was so demanding, if no changes were made, it would be much harder to level up and ascend. It would be even harder to generate geno armaments. He would need to be a god to practice it in its entirety.

After the changes, the power would be decreased, but if it weren’t edited, then it couldn’t be learned at all. This thing was not created for the average joe to fool around with. Because modifying took a long time, she allowed Han Sen to continue practicing for now. And when she was done, they would begin anew.

Han Sen returned to his garden and summoned Spell. He wanted to know what powers she possessed. He was mostly interested in the two revolvers she wielded, and he wanted to know if the guns could fire bullets.

Spell moved by her own volition. She did so with gentle grace, and as she clutched the two revolvers, she was able to fly around effortlessly and shoot the flowers all about

The revolvers could fire bullets and hit the flowers. Her accuracy was good.

But Han Sen noticed that the bullets weren’t solid, and they cost energy to fire. Even Han Sen’s own energy was drained by the attacks. Spell was Han Sen’s geno armament, so it made sense that it could be used as a weapon. But he also realized the more power he was willing to put in, the more powerful the bullets fired would be.

Those bullets did not have any special powers, though. Perhaps it was because he was too low level. Becoming a Viscount might change things.

Barons couldn’t unleash powers from a distance. They had no ranged attacks they could use, so at least where Barons were concerned, having Spell was something that was a little overpowered.

Han Sen tested it quite a bit, and he realized he could command and control Spell in battle. Her movements were controlled by Han Sen’s thoughts. There was no delay, despite the distance that separated them.

Han Sen did not need to control her all the time, though. With just a thought, Spell could be put to any task, and she’d finish it by herself. She was like a living thing, for the most part, and she possessed a lot of intelligence.

“She’s like a real lifeform. Gee, that The Story of Genes is strange,” Han Sen thought to himself. He really liked Spell, and valued it far above something like a sword or whatever else he might have gotten. He could do a lot more with this.

Aside from Yisha, though, no one else had learned that he had a geno armament. The news about Yisha using twelve geno fluids to make Han Sen a geno armament did circulate, though.

All the Rebate that heard this could not believe their ears.

No matter how bad the creature was, one or two geno fluids should have made them Noble. And Han Sen had taken twelve. How bad was he?

Many of the high-class Rebates believed raising Han Sen was pointless. If it was so difficult for him to generate a geno armament, becoming a king and refining the feather would be so much harder.

“Don’t bother raising a talentless person like that”

“No wonder those elites did not invite Han Sen to join them. He is way too bad.”

“I don’t know what Queen was thinking, using twelve geno fluids. Even if he does have a deified feather, there is such a low chance he can become deified. How much is it going to cost to get him to that level? The resources she wasted could have made two semi-deified warriors.”

All of the Rebate were talking about this. Some ministers and elites had already come to consult with Yisha, informing her that she should give up on Han Sen now.

Yisha did not explain her reasoning, and neither did she take their advice. And she said that when the Narrow Moon tunnel opened up, Han Sen would be a part of it

After that, the Rebate communities exploded with talk of Han Sen and Yisha.

Twelve geno fluids to become a Noble Baron. Already it was seen as a pointless idea, but Yisha felt differently. She still wanted to raise Han Sen up. She even wanted to give him a name for the tunnel. It was hard to take the minds of others off of this idea.

Many of the elites thought that Yisha raising an outsider and taking him as a student meant they had some sort of secret relationship.

Yisha hadn’t even performed a ceremony when she accepted him as a student. With the sudden induction, they all believed she knew how bad he was, but she was forging ahead anyway.

Otherwise, why would the queen accept a student so quietly?

No one was willing to challenge Yisha’s desires, though. But even so, everyone was determined to continue hating Han Sen.

Han Sen stayed in the garden to practice with Spell. He had no idea people were talking about him the way they were.

Even if he had known, though, he wouldn’t have cared. Han Sen might have looked young, but he had gone through life and death experiences few others could equal. He had experienced everything a person could, a long time ago. He was not totally uncaring, but he wouldn’t waste many feelings on petty quarrels, either.

Yisha summoned him and told him to practice in Narrow Moon. If he went, that would be the first time he had exited the garden.

“Before you go to Narrow Moon, I will teach you a knife skill. Try to learn as much of this as you can.” When she said that to Han Sen, her voice sounded strange.

Han Sen didn’t notice, though. He didn’t realize how many talented young Rebates were waiting in Narrow Moon to teach him a lesson. Narrow Moon’s space tunnel opened once a year, and only Barons could enter. Only ten of them could go at a time. Only the best Barons would be there, as a result.

To claim a spot, you had to be an approved and formally recognized genius. And you also had to have proof to support any claim of excellence. In addition, you had to receive an invite from an elder.

Han Sen had nothing, and yet, Yisha had claimed a spot there for him. People weren’t very happy about that, and the young men who had claimed the other nine places didn’t like him at all.

Some of the young ones were preparing to teach him a lesson inside the tunnel, because when Han Sen got bullied in there, Yisha wouldn’t be able to do anything to save him.
