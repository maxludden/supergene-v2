  After looking at the opponents he would have to go up against, Han Sen glanced over Littleflower’s potential foes that were in the Viscount tier. He noticed that in the midst of them all, there was one particular race that he had never heard of before. It was represented by a simple paw print.

“Ugh, whatever. I don’t care. I just need to finish this next fight as soon as I am able to, so I can find out if that Viscount is truly my Littleflower,” Han Sen thought to himself.

The Geno Being Scroll was special. All the creatures in the galaxy could watch the fights unfold. Even creatures without eyes could feel what was happening in the fights. But no matter what tools or skills you used, nothing could record the fights for later viewing.

If you used a machine to try to record any of the matches that were taking place, and you later went to play the files you had created, you would only see footage of a bronze scroll in the sky. The scroll itself would look completely empty.

All the tiers started fighting at the same time, so Han Sen would have to finish his fights before Littleflower did. That way, he could race to see Littleflower.

The teams were established, and again, the names upon the scroll became dust. A painting then appeared instead.

Same as before, Han Sen felt things around him become distorted. He soon entered the scroll again, and the paper with his name written on it appeared next to him.

But the arena was different than it had been the last time. This time, he was on the sea. His body hovered above the waves. He looked around and saw a Demon man a few thousand meters away. He was looking at Han Sen, too.

Kahn saw Han Sen and frowned. He couldn’t tell what race his opponent was beneath the gold armor he was clad in, but he presumed him to be a Demon.

“Dollar? Human?” Kahn looked at Han Sen’s paper and mulled the details over to himself.

He was the strongest Marquise Demon to participate in the Geno Being Scroll. Even so, Kahn was not a reckless man, and he had taken the time to research every Marquise that he might be going against.

In regards to the human Dollar, Kahn knew he had defeated Dragon Thirty-Nine. So, Kahn would not underestimate him.

Katcha!

Kahn became a xenogeneic. He grew to ten meters tall, and a demonic air gathered around his body.

When Han Sen saw Kahn become a giant, he was surprised. He didn’t know how the Demon did it. Previously, Han Sen had annihilated his giant body, but he was fine now. He had been fixed, and he was a giant just like before. He seemed to be even stronger than before.

His transformation was a little different this time around, though. He was wearing a pair of gloves, which did not break as his body grew larger. They expanded with him.

The gloves looked to have been forged from black steel, but they were laden with spikes. One of them in particular was extremely long, and its tip was sharper than a needle.

Kahn had learned from his mistakes. He had repeatedly practiced with giant techniques, and in doing so, he obtained a treasure he’d be able to use in that form. It was for emergencies, in the event a killing blow missed.

The glove was a King class weapon called Lightning Spike. If Kahn hadn’t been so special to the Demons, he wouldn’t have been allowed to use a King class weapon. Although Kahn couldn’t access all of its power, he could still use some of it. It was enough to maximize his punching speed for a Marquise.

With Lightning Spike, his punching speed was as great as the red cloud. No one could take advantage of him when it came to speed now.

He had the power of a giant, and it was coupled with the speed of the Lightning Spike. Kahn didn’t know if he could defeat Evil Eye, but he was confident in his ability to compete wkh Lone Bamboo and Dragon Eight. He was certain that he could reach the top ten.

Kahn was not naive enough to think his current position within the top five could be maintained. Many elites did not care about the top ranking as they stood, though. Many of the top elites were happy enough to stay at the bottom of the list right now, but he would be satisfied if he could remain within the top ten when all was said and done.

“Go to hell!” Kahn roared. His giant body came running towards Han Sen across the sea. The gloves he wore were like black bolts of lightning. They came before Han Sen in a stunning display of strength.

Sky Demon powers, when married with the speed of the Lightning Spikes, was something Kahn hoped wouldn’t miss. With the addition of his giant powers, few could withstand a devastating blow like that. He just had to ensure his hit landed on the target.

It was a fight Han Sen wished to end quickly. Seeing Kahn rushing towards him like this was perfect. He cast his Blood- Pulse Sutra and Jadeskin and threw a punch towards the giant Kahn.

The crystallized blood boiled inside Han Sen’s body. His flesh became jade, as two separate powers fused inside him. But Han Sen did not release a Jadeskin godlight. He only used the actual strength of his body to combat Kahn’s incoming fist.

Katcha!

The Lightning Spike punched through Han Sen’s gold-plated gauntlet. Kahn looked murderous, wanting to ram the spike on through Han Sen’s body.

The next second, Kahn looked on in disbelief. The mighty Lightning Spike had only managed to pierce Han Sen’s armor. When it punched through the garb and came into contact with Han Sen’s skin, it rang with the sound of rattled metal and could not go any further.

When Han Sen’s Jadeskin became Marquise level, it was a much stronger change than what had occurred with the Blood-Pulse Sutra. Now, his body was as sturdy as a top tier Dragon’s.

Boom!

The two goliath powers collided. The ripples of the shockwave were so devastating that they created waves that were a hundred meters high. Kahn’s body was sent stumbling backward a few hundred meters, too. Han Sen, on the other hand, only fell back ten meters.

Kahn and the other Demons that were watching this were in shock. The vitality of Kahn’s giant body ought to have been unrivaled. Not many could beat him, especially of the Marquise rank. For Dollar to beat Kahn’s giant power was more than surprising.

“Wow, I wonder what humans are? How can they be that scary and strong? They are scarier than the Dragon,” someone exclaimed.

Kahn snarled. He was officially peeved now, because he could not believe that someone had just bested him with raw strength. He could only assume that it must have been a fluke, and so he gathered up more power to attack Han Sen again.

“I don’t have time to fight you. I need to see Littleflower.” Han Sen raised his hand, and then, a gold light appeared between his fingers. It became a coin.

Ding!

Han Sen moved his fingers, launching the coin out to strike Kahn’s incoming fist.
