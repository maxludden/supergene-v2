<p>The guillotine was an execution device used for carrying out
death sentences. In ancient times, some countries used the
guillotine to legally execute people. A famous queen was once
brought to the guillotine after being sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The guillotine looked like a doorframe. It had a platform at the
bottom and a blade above that looked like a gate. When the blade
was brought up to the highest point, the prisoner’s head was placed
on the platform below. Afterward, the rope holding the blade up was
cut. The small gate-like, heavy blade then dropped. No matter how
strong someone’s neck was, it was still severed.</p>
<p>The guillotine was 12 feet high. The frame was made of old,
bronze-looking wood. The platform and blade were composed of black
metal.</p>
<p>The frame looked very bloody. No one knew how much blood had
been spilled or how many heads had rolled beneath that frightening
machine.</p>
<p>The entire guillotine was full of a devilish, scary presence. It
was like countless angry spirits were there crying out in pain.
Before they walked close to the god temple, they already felt
countless demons pulling them closer to the guillotine.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the guillotine. He noticed Bald Guy walking
straight toward the guillotine inside the god temple. He looked
like a doll with no soul. Even the way he walked was
mechanical.</p>
<p>“Bald Guy!” Han Sen roared. The bald man, who was near the
river, woke up. Bald Guy noticed he was standing in the river. The
water was above his legs. In shock, he ran back.</p>
<p>“This thing is so evil,” Bald Guy said with shock. “As I looked
at the guillotine, I felt as if I want to put my head there. It’s
making me confused.”</p>
<p>“It’s OK. I am going to have a look at what it is.” After Han
Sen said that, he walked toward the god temple.</p>
<p>He sensed that the god temple and guillotine were very weird.
This was not like an ordinary God Spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen had entered many god temples and met many God Spirits,
but people like Evil Lotus God, Qin Jun, or even the person in the
geno hall had given Han Sen the feeling of being restricted and
bound.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful they were, they did things with order.
This Break Head God, however, made Han Sen feel that the God Spirit
very overbearing and extremely evil through and through. It was
unlike an ordinary God Spirit.</p>
<p>Bao’er sat on Han Sen’s shoulders. She held the little flying
fish. Her small face looked glum.</p>
<p>When Han Sen stepped into the ancient temple, he saw something
behind the decapitation platform.</p>
<p>The blade that connected to the guillotine had a rope in the
back. That rope was not tied to anything. It was as if it was being
held by a hand.</p>
<p>The hand was not a human hand. It belonged to a doll. It was an
old doll that looked like a woman wearing pretty noble clothing and
a crown.</p>
<p>Because the doll was so old, it had lost most of its color. It
had touched a lot of dirty blood and looked very old and weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the doll. The doll’s eyes, which previously had
been shut, were now open. Its blood-red eyes peered down on Han
Sen. The mouth, which could move, let out a strange laugh.</p>
<p>“You are here. I have waited for you for a long time.” The voice
was ghostly. The voice made people’s teeth sore. It sounded like a
voice that came from the depths of hell.</p>
<p>“Do you know me?” Han Sen asked the wooden doll.</p>
<p>The real God Spirits must have recognized him. This god temple
was very strange. It made Han Sen wonder if it was a real god
temple or not. “Of course, I know. I have been waiting for you for
a million years. You have finally arrived. Come… Come to me… Be a
god like me forever… Let’s not spend time apart again…” The doll
let out a shrill laugh.</p>
<p>As its vocal cords were still rattling out a laugh, the doll’s
body moved. It pulled a black rope that was soaked in blood. The
blade was pulled up.</p>
<p>When the blade went up, the entire guillotine’s purple and black
flames exploded. It was like there were tens of thousands of evil
spirits crying and roaring. The entirety of the Break Head God
Temple was surrounded by scary, black, and purple flames.</p>
<p>When the blade went higher, the scary purple and black flames
blazed stronger. When the purple and black flames rose, it was like
countless evil spirits came roaring and jumping toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>“A sky full of flying feathers.” Han Sen’s body exploded with
gold light. The peacock feathers formed a gold ring. A sky full of
feathers fired at the evil spirit like a hail of arrows.</p>
<p>In the next second, Han Sen shockingly discovered that the sky
full of flying feathers was unable to damage the evil spirit. It
pierced through the body. The peacock feathers were like a storm
that struck the pedestal. The scene broke into a shower of godly
light, but his power was unable to move the guillotine at all.</p>
<p>“It is pointless. I am God. No matter how powerful ordinary
people are, they cannot fight against a god. Normal people are just
a pathetic joke. Obey me, and you can achieve godly powers. You can
become immortal like me. You can look down on everything in this
world.” The doll sounded a bit crazed. The voice echoed throughout
the temple. The heavy blade squeaked with horrible, metal scraping
sounds. It amplified the sense that everything inside that tomb was
evil and scary.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. The gold wing peacock king powers he wielded
did not seem to deal the slightest amount of damage to the
guillotine. While that was very concerning, it did help to dispel
all doubt and prove one thing. It meant that the old temple they
had discovered was nothing manmade. It was a real god temple. If it
was a real god temple, it meant the guillotine and doll inside were
real God Spirits.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was in the geno universe, he had seen this sort of
thing quite often. The power of ordinary people did not work on God
Spirits. To hurt a god, a person needed a special sort of
power.</p>
<p>If it was not for Qin Xiu or World King God breaking the space
barrier and making the geno hall reveal itself, fewer people could
have hurt a God Spirit.</p>
<p>The universe of kingdoms was the same way. Even a god-class
mutant gold winged peacock king was unable to hurt the guillotine
and doll. Han Sen was not sure which power was required to damage
them.</p>
<p>While he was thinking, the purple and black flames landed on
him. It was like he was being pulled by countless evil spirits. Han
Sen was unable to control his body. He found himself compulsively
walking toward the guillotine.</p>
<p>“Come over here… Remove that head of yours… Lay it down and
become a god alongside me. Become a being that transcends the
trappings of mortality. Join me and become immortal…” The doll kept
pulling the rope while screaming and laughing. Han Sen cast the
Xuan Yellow Sutra to fight the evil spirit. Although he immediately
extinguished the evil spirit, more evil spirits were coming. It was
like they were endless.</p>
<p>Even Bald Guy and Li Bing Yu, who were standing far away from
the river, were affected. Li Bing Yu was able to resist a small
amount, but Bald Guy was already in a complete daze. He walked
straight to the old temple.</p>
<p>Han Sen was ready to break the restrictions of the world. He
wanted to use his powers to break the guillotine, but he suddenly
saw the small flying fish in Bao’er’s arm react. It was spitting
out a swathe of white fire.</p>
