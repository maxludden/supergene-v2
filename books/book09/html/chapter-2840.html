	<p>Han Sen killed the ink feather god bird. He did not receive a beast soul. God looked at the xenogeneic that had
		no spirit. After that, God said nothing more.</p>

	<p>Han Sen took the ink feather god bird&#8217;s flesh with him to leave the Nine-Defense Palace. He kept refining
		the flesh while waiting for the god fights to begin.</p>

	<p>Because there were deified beings that did not accept their invitation to the god fights, it would be another
		three days before the god fights began. For the next three days, the deifieds had some time to reconsider their
		invitation.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wanted to know if Bai King was going to join the god fights, but he still had not had the chance to meet
		up with him since his return. Han Sen was looking at the geno god list for a while, but he did not find Bai
		King&#8217;s name there.</p>

	<p>When Bao Ying came to teach Han Sen more manners, she carefully asked, &#8220;Mister Holy Baby, are you joining
		the geno god list fights?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Ever since what had happened, Bao Ying was far more polite to Han Sen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who knows? Maybe.&#8221; Han Sen answered like it worked both ways. He joined as an adult, and he had used
		the name Dollar. He did not want the Extreme King to know that.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If you do not join, it will be a grand shame. With your power, perhaps you would get into the top
		100.&#8221; Bao Ying spoke it as if it was a big shame. Clearly, she had seen the geno god list and not found
		Holy Baby&#8217;s name there.</p>

	<p>After Bao Ying left, Han Sen did not see God. Ever since they had returned from Nine-Defense Palace, God always
		took off alone. Han Sen did not know where God went.</p>

	<p>Three days later, Han Sen was finally able to start fighting. He first took a look at who he was going to go up
		against. He saw his name and Barr&#8217;s name matched with it.</p>

	<p>Is this guy Barr&#8230; Han Sen was shocked. He was the one who had pushed Barr to deified, and he knew the might
		Barr possessed.</p>

	<p>Although Barr&#8217;s level was not high, and he was only primitive or transmutation at best, his almost-immortal
		power frequently gave Han Sen a headache.</p>

	<p>I guess I was lucky to not encounter a true god class enemy. At least, Han Sen felt safer.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, over in the Destroyed realm, Barr saw he was being pitted against Dollar. His eyes looked slightly
		excited as he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe the first fight puts me against Dollar. With the Destroyed
		skills I created, he will be given quite the shock.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Dia Robber frowned and said, &#8220;Although the skills you created combine your god body elements, it is very
		powerful. Against Dollar, you should always be careful. That guy is not normal.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I know. But this time, it will not be so easy for him to defeat me. With my Destroyed skills, there is no
		way I can lose.&#8221; Barr was feeling confident.</p>

	<p>The geno god list appeared. It made all the creatures in the universe want to watch. It was so rare to see
		deified elites, and it was even rarer to see them do battle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I thought geno god list was the same as the geno being scroll. I thought many tiers would conduct fights
		at the same time, but it isn&#8217;t like that. It&#8217;s a mishmash, and each fight occurs consecutively. That
		is very good. We won&#8217;t miss any of the fights.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yeah. Deified-level fights are so exciting to watch. If a geno god list had not suddenly appeared, we
		would never have had the chance to see them fight. It will be great if I get to watch every fight.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Deified class geno god list is the first place on the god list. That should be the strongest person in the
		universe.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes. The strongest person in the universe without a doubt.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The two deifieds in the first fight are Barr from the Destroyed and the human Dollar. Human Dollar&#8230;
		Why does that name sound so familiar?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, that Dollar must have been the one who achieved first place in the Marquise bracket for the geno being
		scroll.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes! It is him. I remember. He defeated Lone Bamboo from Sky Palace and achieved first place in the
		Marquise bracket. How many years has it been, yet he has already achieved deified class? Isn&#8217;t that a bit
		too fast?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Human&#8230; What kind of race is that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Because there had never been a god fight before, in the first round of the god fights, every creature in the
		universe gave it all their focus.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had to transform into adult mode to enter the geno god list. He entered space and saw Barr far away. He
		was coming at him.</p>

	<p>In the red-dwarf palace, the man who looked like a king was watching Han Sen in the geno god list. It looked as
		if he was in deep thought. This Dollar is so weird. He uses the name human to travel around the universe and
		hasn&#8217;t been killed by God. That is special.</p>

	<p>In a dark world with a broken palace, a weird big bird sighed. &#8220;Human? That is a familiar and yet strange
		name.&#8221;</p>

	<p>A woman, who was quite pretty, looked at Nine-Life Cat and asked, &#8220;Old Cat, is this Dollar really
		human?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;In the sanctuaries, there was a person called Dollar,&#8221; Old Cat said after thinking for a moment.
		&#8220;But how could an ordinary human level up so fast? That just doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if he is. Besides, aside from Little Master, no one can really kill God. It is a shame
		Little Master is not deified yet. Otherwise, if he was to join this god fight, he would certainly earn first
		place. Then, Sacred would become feared once again.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What a shame. Who knew there would suddenly be a geno god list showing up. If we had known about this
		beforehand, we would have made Little Master become deified before it began. It is too late now.&#8221;</p>

	<br>

	<hr />

	<br>

	<p>&#8220;Dollar, I finally have a chance to fight you!&#8221; Barr flew excitedly shouted as he flew toward Han
		Sen. His entire body was surging with the eagerness to do battle. His eyes looked as if they were on fire.&quot;
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought, How could this guy still be the same? He still behaves like this as a deified. The guy
		hasn&#8217;t changed a bit.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was going to finish this fight quickly, but he then heard Barr say, &#8220;Dollar, I created a skill
		called Destroyed Skill. I can kill another of the same level as easy as I can kill a dog. Do not disappoint me,
		OK?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh. I would love to see it.&#8221; Han Sen knew that Barr&#8217;s destroyed body was strong. It was almost
		indestructible. But Barr&#8217;s fighting ability was average at best. He was a bit arrogant by saying killing
		him was as easy as killing a dog. Still, Han Sen was curious. He gave up on killing Barr right away. He wanted
		to see this Destroyed Skill.</p>

	<p>Upon hearing Barr say that, Dia Rober was speechless. He held his head down and felt a headache come on.</p>

	<p>That guy was the poster child of brainless people. His words offended many deified elites.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The people of the Destroyed are so powerful. Killing another as easily as killing a dog? I hope the next
		time we meet we can see who will end up killing who.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe he can&#8217;t go past the first round. He will get killed like a dog by the human.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Many deified elites were angry. While they were all mocking him, Barr moved. He was madly running at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>As Barr began to sprint, his whole body was on fire. He looked like a black sun.</p>
