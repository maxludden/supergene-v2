<p>“Just because you can’t do it now does not mean you can’t do it
later. Plus, you are a man. How can you say you can’t do it?” Big
sky demon looked at Han Sen and smiled.</p>
<p>“You can’t try to provoke me. You are not going to tell me
anyway.” Han Sen looked like a dead pig that was not afraid of hot
water.</p>
<p>Big sky demon sighed. “You are so hard to deal with, but you are
my little lover. Therefore, I can tell you the password. There is
something you should know, however. If the password is written down
on the geno tablet, the whole geno tablet will reset the 33 skies.
The entirety of the 33 skies will change. All of the creatures in
the 33 skies will be affected. Unless using it is an absolute must,
you should think long and hard before deciding what to do with
it.”</p>
<p>“What kind of effects are we talking about?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not really care about other creatures, but he was in
the 33 skies too. He might end up being affected.</p>
<p>“I have never tried it before.” How am I supposed to know? I
will tell you the password, but it is up to you whether or not it
is used. If something goes wrong, you can’t take it out on me.” Big
sky demon’s words were said to shirk all responsibility.</p>
<p>“You don’t know? In that case, how do you know anything will be
affected?” Han Sen looked at her untrustingly.</p>
<p>Big sky demon slumped her shoulders and said, “Mister Leader
told me. He is the one who told me the password and informed me
about what would happen if it was used. If you really want to know
the specifics, you should consider asking the leader himself.”</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to know where to find your leader?” Han Sen
had a wry smile.</p>
<p>“That is no concern of mine,” big sky demon said. She put out
her finger and drew 24 symbols in the air.</p>
<p>“These 24 symbols are the passwords needed to unlock the geno
tablet’s Return to Origin. You can put it down anywhere on the
tablet. It can be in any order as well. But you must remember that
the order of your writing of it cannot be changed. Otherwise, the
password will not work.”</p>
<p>After big sky demon said that, she waved her hand to erase the
24 symbols.</p>
<p>It was just 24 symbols, so Han Sen was able to recognize them
all with ease. The order in which he remembered them would not be
wrong either. Even so, Han Sen did not dare risk believing big sky
demon. Who knew if the geno password, those 24 words, would be as
useful as she was claiming them to be?</p>
<p>“I have told you the password,” big sky demon said. “It is now
up to you how you use it. My wounds have not yet recovered, so I
will be requiring more rest.” She was like a nightmare entering Han
Sen’s body. She then vanished.</p>
<p>“Did she really just leave like that?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>People like Ancient Devil and big sky demon would not really
force anyone to do anything, but most of the time, one had to do
what they said anyway. That was why they were such scary
people.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not planning on using big sky demon’s password since
he did not know what would happen.</p>
<p>If what big sky demon had told him was true, the geno tablet
would give him backlash. With Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode and
the power of The Story of Genes, he was not afraid of a gene
message invading his body.</p>
<p>Still, it was always a good thing to harbor doubt. Plus, Han Sen
did not think he required the password just yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat against the geno tablet’s bottom. He kept using geno
arts to recover his power.</p>
<p>He waited to see if the words would fully disappear. He wanted
to see if he would get backlash. Plus, if he did not keep drawing
symbols on the geno tablet, Sky King might end up being able to
open the holes in space again.</p>
<p>Time went by. As his mark started to lighten, its lights grew
dimmer. Before the geno spell wholly disappeared, Han Sen
understood that Ancient Devil was right.</p>
<p>When the geno spell’s symbols were not clear, the universe had
black dots again. It was the black holes reawakening.</p>
<p>“This is bad. Me being fully recovered, power-wise, aligns
perfectly with the time it takes for the spell to fade and my need
to renew it comes. Does that mean I will be trapped here unable to
do anything else?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>That was not what he was worried about the most. Even if he
wanted to keep the geno spell in place, there were still a few days
he had to freely go around. He just had to come back and top up the
geno spell every few days. If he did not get into a fight or spend
any energy, Han Sen would be fine.</p>
<p>Big sky demon had mentioned something to him about a backlash.
It made Han Sen nervous.</p>
<p>While the geno spell had not gone yet, Han Sen used his Super
God Spirit mode. He drew a geno spell on the stone tablet. He then
cast a geno art to recover power. He was going to accept the
backlash if it came for him.</p>
<p>“I hope The Story of Genes’ Forever Solid power can prohibit the
invasion of genes in my body,” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>An hour went by. The first geno spell finally disappeared. Han
Sen did not feel as if there was a gene invasion. He thought, “Was
big sky demon just yanking my chain?”</p>
<p>While he was thinking, where Han Sen had written down the geno
spell on the geno tablet spell lit up. The light was like a fairy
leaping out from the tablet. It flew to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen gathered up power to hit the light spell, but the light
spell was like something unreal. His power was unable to touch it.
The light spell was very fast. It landed on Han Sen’s forehead. He
had been unable to avoid it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very shocked. He only required one thought to
instantly travel very fast. He could go a thousand miles in the
blink of an eye, yet his reactions had not been fast enough. He had
a very bad feeling. He cast The Story of Genes and had his whole
body run its Forever Solid power.</p>
<p>According to theory, Forever Solid meant one’s gene messages
could not be altered. In front of that mysterious geno tablet, Han
Sen was not so sure it would still apply.</p>
<p>The light spell landed on Han Sen’s forehead. It looked as if it
melted into his skin.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt his entire body burn with what felt like fire. His
blood started to boil.</p>
<p>“The backlash is real…” Han Sen felt his cells burn like steel.
They were melting. A weird power was going into him. He could not
describe it. It made Han Sen feel either upset or pain.</p>
