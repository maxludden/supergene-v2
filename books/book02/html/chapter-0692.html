    <p>
      Han Sen tried simulating the Saint-Bone Elephant&#8217;s flow. Suddenly,
      he felt his pulse consist of a hundred elephant cries. An infinite cosmos
      of power brewed inside his body, filling his entirety like a mad flood. It
      was much stronger than before, when the gene lock hadn&#8217;t been
      broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen picked up the bone elephant&#8217;s essence. Under the strong
      energy flow of the bone elephant, the Life Geno essence vibrated in his
      hand. It suddenly flew out of his grasp and assimilated with his body. The
      essence melted into his body and he didn&#8217;t even need to eat it. The
      Life Geno essence simply entered, blending into his person.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Essence Absorbed: Saint-Bone Elephant. You Have Gained One Super
        Geno Point.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Essence Absorbed: Saint-Bone Elephant. You Have Gained One Super
        Geno Point.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      The familiar voice rang in his head. Han Sen almost released tears of joy.
      After all his hard work, he had finally discovered how to absorb a Life
      Geno essence.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen absorbed the entirety of the Life Geno essence, his bones
      immediately felt stronger. It was as if they glowed with a certain
      strength. In the end, Han Sen&#8217;s super geno points increased by ten.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Finally&#8230; finally I can continue my evolution and
      ascension.&#8221; Han Sen wished he could just shout it out to the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past, Han Sen worked as hard as he did to provide a better life,
      not just for himself, but for his family, also. He became stronger and
      stronger to uncover the truth behind his father&#8217;s accident.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was his purpose. But being an evolver was almost like an addiction.
    </p>

    <p>
      If an athlete who trained tirelessly each and every day were to
      immediately quit training, they&#8217;d feel uncomfortable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had grown used to getting stronger and earning new abilities. He
      was desperate to grow, and the reasons that may have fueled his ascension
      in the past didn&#8217;t mean anything anymore. Strength was the only
      thing that mattered now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart jumped, having simulated the silver fox&#8217;s
      energy flow. The crackle of silver lightning sparked across his body. He
      smiled in happiness.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen threw out his fist and a snap of lightning burst from his hand. It
      wasn&#8217;t how the silver fox did it, however; it could cast lightning
      bolts as if they were magical arrows.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was expected. The fitness of humans was limited in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary. Even if a person opened their first gene lock, it
      wasn&#8217;t truly opened in its entirety. Humans couldn&#8217;t
      commandeer and utilize powers in the way super creatures did.
    </p>

    <p>
      To unleash such wondrous powers, he&#8217;d have to wait until he became a
      Celestial Being.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then simulated the bear cub&#8217;s energy flow. When he did so,
      his body suddenly became stronger. His muscles hardened like a freshly
      inflated tire. His arms were bigger than his thighs and his whole body
      became tougher than ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      His entire body and the organs within became as sturdy as steel. His
      strength increased by a substantial amount, but unfortunately, this came
      at the cost of speed and mobility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was having fun with this. But he then recalled that the gourd had
      an energy flow of its own, too. He wondered what might happen if he
      simulated it.
    </p>

    <p>
      His heart jumped, and the Dongxuan Sutra&#8217;s energy began to change.
      It was following along with the gourd&#8217;s energy flow. Suddenly, a
      peculiar power began to blossom inside him.
    </p>

    <p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s body became magnetic. Everything inside the room was
      magnetized to Han Sen, and everything flew in his direction. He was
      unexpectedly battered.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were like homing missiles, and he had no chance of dodging the now
      dangerous furniture. Left and right he weaved, but to no avail. Everything
      in the room was now being glued to his person.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crystal chair, the lampstand, and even table was a threat. And they
      all piled against Han Sen. There was even a crystal bed, which was now
      looming over him, ready to fall on top of him. At the ghastly sight, Han
      Sen was utterly shocked. In haste, he ended the simulation of the
      gourd&#8217;s energy flow.
    </p>

    <p>Crash!</p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen cut the energy flow, everything that was sticking to his body
      crashed down to the floor. It was like he had switched on some magnetism
      mode inside him; he was quite confused.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What the heck is this energy flow. Did I just turn into a magnet
      that can pull everything towards me? What possible purpose could something
      like that serve?&#8221; Han Sen did not understand and was not quite sure
      what to think.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that was fine; Han Sen did not need this energy flow. Right now, he
      had finished his first tier of the Dongxuan Sutra, and now he could use it
      to secretly learn the energy flows of second generation super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each Qi Gong was like a different key, where different keys could unlock
      different chests, and each chest contained a different treasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The powers he had obtained from opening the first gene lock of Jadeskin
      were vastly different than the powers he had obtained by opening the first
      gene lock of the Dongxuan Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Abilities always had their pros and cons, very much like the differences
      between fire and water. They weren&#8217;t stronger or weaker than one
      another, they were just different.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when Han Sen unlocked the Dongxuan Sutra&#8217;s gene lock, it felt
      stronger than Jadeskin. His actual body felt stronger, at least.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dongxuan Sutra&#8217;s dongxuan aura and the Jadeskin&#8217;s seventh
      sense were different abilities, but they were kind of similar at the same
      time. Neither was stronger than the other; it was just that his perception
      of the Dongxuan aura&#8217;s nature was more substantial to him. It was
      not stronger than the seventh sense, it was just different.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tried to absorb the Life Geno essence of a first generation super
      creature, but with no success. He needed to learn the energy flow of a
      second generation super creature, slay it, and absorb its essence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past, this task would have seemed insurmountable to Han Sen. But
      having now unlocked the Dongxuan Sutra&#8217;s first gene lock, he
      didn&#8217;t think it would be a problem. He could steal the super
      creature&#8217;s energy flow whilst they were in battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I cannot absorb the Life Geno essence of a first generation
      super creature, maybe it&#8217;s best that I sell it to a big faction and
      earn some dosh.&#8221; Han Sen then took to wondering how and where he
      might sell them for the most money. But he then suddenly heard a voice
      coming from someplace within the Crystal Palace.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Announcement: The Second God&#8217;S Sanctuary&#8217;S Battle
        Arena Has Opened. Join The Battlegrounds, For The Holy Battles Begin In
        Thirty-Three Days.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The voice of a cold woman echoed throughout the Crystal Palace, which
      spooked Han Sen. Hearing what she had to say, however, put a strange look
      on his face.
    </p>

    <p>
      The holy battles in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary were different than
      the holy battles in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary because, aside from
      humans, spirits could also take part in the combat. It wasn&#8217;t purely
      human versus human.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what was more, this wasn&#8217;t an annual event like it was in the
      First God&#8217;s Sanctuary. The holy battles only took place every ten
      years in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. In the past, no human had been
      able to win and achieve the title &#8220;Son of God.&#8221; The previous
      nine &#8220;Son of God&#8221; titles were all won by spirits. They never
      failed once.
    </p>

    <p>No human knew what the reward for being the tenth Son of God was.</p>
