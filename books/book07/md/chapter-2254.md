  Han Sen was a Duke and he wanted to tame that blood kirin. Fox Queen thought that was a ridiculous notion.

The blood kirin was as exemplary as a King could be. It might not lose a fight against a half-deified being, even. And on top of that, it was the fostered son of White Bone Big Hell. That was its home turf, and that could see it buffed by belonging there.

It was lucky that Han Sen was able to make use of that shield of his to stay alive, but Fox Queen thought it was an absolute joke that he wanted to try and tame the blood kirin.

But since she had nothing else to do, it might have at least helped to stave off boredom for a little while.

After Han Sen entered White Bone Big Hell again, he headed for the lotus-like mountaintop. If he did not have what it took to tame the blood kirin, he’d instead resort to practicing Blood-Pulse Sutra, and at least bring it up to the rank of Duke. Then, he could use Jadeskin and Super Spank in the hopes that would be enough to break that chunk of the palace’s trappings.

Fox Queen was standing in front of the hellish skeletal gate. She was watching Han Sen’s movement. Han Sen had a Ghost Bone body, and in the blood kirin’s eye, that made him a perfect bevy of nutrients. Something interesting was sure to happen if the blood kirin sensed his coming.

Just like Fox Queen thought, Han Sen was fifty miles away from the lotus peak when a roar sounded from his destination.

A moment later, the blood kirin came down from the lotus mountaintop with its red cloud. Its bloody eyes were staring right at Han Sen. Then, the creature leapt towards him with the sounding of a strange cry.

Han Sen saw a red gust coming towards him like a bolt of lightning. That scary power came right before him, and he could not teleport. So, he summoned the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema.

Katcha!

The blood kirin’s talons were carrying a red light, and they came down on the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema. It left a few hefty scratch marks on its surface. It almost broke the Bai Sema completely, which gave Han Sen a bit of a shock.

Without saying a word, Han Sen turned around and ran. The blood kirin was stronger than Han Sen had believed it to be. Although it was King class, it was there in White Bone Big Hell. It was likely most half-deified beings would be unable to defeat it.

Fox Queen watched Han Sen making use of his gold shield in his hasty retreat. She laughed. “So, you still want to try and tame it, do you?”

Han Sen saw that the blood kirin seemed to be afraid of Fox Queen, and thus, it quit its pursuit. He felt a great deal of relief. He put away the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema and said, “Let me think of a better way.”

Fox Queen laughed. She returned to the palace, while Han Sen sat in front of the hellish skeletal gate. He thought about how he might deal with the blood kirin.

That blood kirin was roaring at Han Sen from a great distance away. Its blood power was booming far and wide, while the crimson clouds grew deeper and darker in the skies. The downpour began to increase in volume.

Han Sen sat there in the blood rain. He stared at the blood kirin and frowned. He used Purple-Eye Butterflies four pupils for examination, and in his eyes, the four images started to spin.

The blood kirin was very much like Ghost Bone. They were both born in White Bone Big Hell, but the blood kirin was not one of the Bone. Its powers were completely different to those of General Ghost Bone.

The Bone and their blood powers were different. It was impossible to use General Ghost Bone’s power to tame the beast, and if he tried to do that, it would end up consumed.

Han Sen could not think of a better way to accomplish that which he wished to. He sat on the peak and started to practice the Blood-Pulse Sutra. If he was unable to tame the blood kirin, then he would have to take that up to Duke in order to break the trappings of the palace.

Han Sen’s body had so much deified Ghost Bone power still in it. Han Sen used Blood-Pulse Sutra to refine it slowly, so he could extend the practice of Blood-Pulse Sutra.

Deified powers were very thick. Just a little power would enable Han Sen to practice all day. It made the Blood-Pulse Sutra swiftly improve, as well. It made Han Sen believe that General Ghost Bone was almost a good person.

Fox Queen went to visit Han Sen a number of times in an attempt to seduce him, but Han Sen never said a word to her. It made her feel as bored as ever, and her visits reduced in frequency.

Fox Queen liked it when people were clean. A place like White Bone Big Hell was not somewhere she was fond of.

Han Sen was sitting atop the peak practicing Blood-Pulse Sutra. Whenever that blood kirin came out to absorb the blood bone air, it would roar at Han Sen. But it was also scared of something. It would never attempt to go near the hellish skeletal gate. Again, it would just roar at Han Sen and that was it.

After a long amount of time went by, the blood kirin would occasionally take to coming a bit closer to watch. It had at the very least stopped roaring at Han Sen.

With the deified power’s help, the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s growth came quickly. When Han Sen studied the Blood-Pulse Sutra, the Blood-Pulse power was all over him. The blood would start to melt like the sea, and the Ghost Bone body would even have a layer of “bloodlight.

“I wonder what element it is, when Blood-Pulse Sutra becomes Duke. It cannot be an element to make babies.” Han Sen thought about the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s possible element and he felt strangely.

He thought Blood-Pulse Sutra’s element would be more suitable for a woman. A big man should not have been learning a technique that was designed for making babies. That made no sense.

But the Blood-Pulse Sutra did have many benefits. It always made Han Sen want to stay and not give up.

After almost a month went by, Han Sen had already managed to absorb five percent of the Ghost Bone power. And it was around that time when Han Sen’s Blood-Pulse Sutra started to break through to the Duke class.

“I hope when Blood-Pulse Sutra reached Duke class it will have an element in which I can fight with,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Han Sen ran the Blood-Pulse Sutra again, and then, a red air appeared everywhere. It made Han Sen’s cheeks look very rosy in color. That red color eventually covered him all, and had him looked like a red statue.

That blood kirin somehow inched its way atop the peak. It stared at Han Sen practicing the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and the look inside its bloody eyes was a very strange one.

The blood kirin usually appeared after the rainy blood had subsided, but the blood rain had not begun right now. It was not yet active. And with it there, staring at Han Sen, it was difficult to determine what it wanted.

Han Sen had not noticed, and this was his most important moment in breaking through with the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He did not have the time to concern himself with something else.

The blood kirin was scared of Fox Queen, and that is why it did not wish to get close to the hellish skeletal gate. But today, it was behaving differently. It may have still been a little hesitant to, but it walked around the peak while staring at the blood-air-looking Han Sen. It gritted its teeth and then walked towards the mountain where the hellish skeletal gate was.

The blood kirin used to be cruel, but now, it was approaching the white bone as if it was sneaking. It headed towards the peak, without the intent of alerting Han Sen.

Han Sen’s body became a blood crystal. It was the important moment now, which would see him become a Duke. The Ghost Bone power kept getting refined, and it was turning into a strong blood power. It made his body’s blood power get stronger. It was like an endless tsunami striking the end.
