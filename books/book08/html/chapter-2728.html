<p>The Six-Eared Macaque was deified, and Han Sen wasn’t being
supported by any treasures. In the eyes of the monkey, he was a
barebones half-deified. The monkey didn’t bother dodging Han Sen’s
strike, and so Han Sen’s attack swept over it. The monkey had
become too eager with the thought of tearing Han Sen to pieces.</p>
<p>But when the Xuan Yellow Sutra’s power came upon it, the
Six-Eared Macaque’s body shook. Its blood-pulse reversed, and its
power just disappeared. Its body and fur were changing, shriveling
as if it was dying.</p>
<p>“What is going on here…” The Six-Eared Macaque saw its body
withering away, more and more. It looked horrified.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t answer. He calmly looked upon the Six-Eared
Macaque.</p>
<p>The changes to the Six-Eared Macaque’s body became stronger and
stronger. Its gold hair that shone like a sun suddenly dimmed, and
its gold eyes no longer had their shine.</p>
<p>And then there was a weird snapping noise. The Six-Eared
Macaque’s substance chains fell apart. In a moment, it went from
deified to King class. It still had half-deified power, but it was
much worse than it had been before. Previously it had been high in
the sky, but now it was on the ground.</p>
<p>“This… how can this be possible?” The Six-Eared Macaque’s eyes
were wide with terror. It couldn’t believe it had become King
class.</p>
<p>“You… what did you do to me? What sort of trick have you used on
me again?” The Six-Eared Macaque snarled, then it spun toward Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Monkey, did you know that I have a title here in this
universe?” Han Sen asked, smiling at the Six-Eared Macaque.</p>
<p>“I don’t give a wet fart about your title. What trick did you
use on me?” The Six-Eared Macaque kept jumping around and shouting,
but it didn’t dare to attack Han Sen again.</p>
<p>One strike had reduced him to a lowly King class being. He never
imagined such a thing was possible. He was now quite scared of Han
Sen. He didn’t dare to attack Han Sen again.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored the squealing of the Six-Eared Macaque. He
laughed and said, “In the universe, people call me the Father of
God. Do you know why I earned this title?”</p>
<p>“How do I… God’s Father? You are so cocky…” Upon hearing Han
Sen’s title, the monkey looked even more annoyed.</p>
<p>That monkey was deified, but Han Sen seemed to be claiming to
have a higher rank. It was clear that the monkey didn’t agree with
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Six-Eared Macaque, and with a disdainful
tone of voice, he said, “The people in the universe call me God’s
Father because deified elites are like children before me. I let
them become my sons and daughters, if they are qualified. If I
don’t permit a man to become my son, then his best hope is to
become my grandchild. Just like you. You aren’t qualified to be my
son.”</p>
<p>The monkey was frozen. He wished to say something, but when he
thought of how Han Sen’s strike had reduced him to King class, what
Han Sen said seemed to make sense.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. You must have used some sort of trick on me… If
you think you have what it takes…”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Han Sen hissed coldly, cutting the monkey off. He
stared icily at the monkey and said, “I saw that there is talent in
you, and I wanted to keep you alive, but you still didn’t
appreciate my mercy. Do you really think I won’t kill you? The
gods, in my eyes, are a bunch of rubbish. I let them live. They
live. If I want them dead, they die. I let them be gods. If I am
not happy, the gods are mere toys to me.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen’s body shone with a godly light. He raised
his hand, ready to kill the monkey.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque was very scared already. Now, it was super
scared by the might of Han Sen. It shivered violently and shouted
with fear, saying, “Don’t kill me! I’m willing to obey…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. There’s no need to push yourself.” Han
Sen glared at the Six-Eared Macaque. His hands rose, ready to kill
the creature.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque quickly said, “I’m not pushing myself. I’m
really not pushing myself… It would be a glorious thing to follow
an elite like you! Can you return me to deified class?”</p>
<p>“That isn’t difficult. Come over here.” Han Sen looked like a
god as he stared down on the Six-Eared Macaque from above.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque looked hesitant and unwilling to come
close to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“If I wanted to kill you, all I would need to do is raise my
hand. It wouldn’t be that difficult.” Han Sen looked at the fiend
with disdain.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque forced a smile. “No, no… I’m not
suspicious of your intent…”</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque ran over to Han Sen. Its body was half the
average height of a human’s, and as it stood before Han Sen, it
looked like a little kid.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at it and raised his hand. He touched its head
like a godfather and said, “I… Han Sen… by the name of all gods…
give you eternal holy power… open the door of destiny…”</p>
<p>Han Sen made up a bunch of nonsense that worked well to bluff
the Six-Eared Macaque. It had no idea that Han Sen was just wasting
time and putting on a show. Han Sen just needed to wait until the
effects of the Xuan Yellow Sutra wore off. Then, the Six-Eared
Macaque would be deified again. Han Sen wouldn’t even need to use
the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He just randomly cast a light on the
Six-Eared Macaque’s head.</p>
<p>Han Sen calculated the time and slowly spoke his fabricated
blessing. By the time he was done, the Xuan Yellow Sutra’s power
had disintegrated. The body of the Six-Eared Macaque changed
again.</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque saw Han Sen’s power inside its body, and
it felt its body change. It quickly became deified again, which
filled the creature with joy and relief.</p>
<p>It was so happy to be deified again. And it was scared of the
man before it. He could reduce or raise the monkey’s level on a
whim.</p>
<p>“This guy is too scary. It looks like it might be true that he
is some sort of Father of God. He might be King class, but I am
inferior to him in every way. I can’t fight him. For a while, at
least, I need to stop trying to beat him,” the Six-Eared Macaque
tried to comfort itself. It was terrified, and it no longer dared
to fight Han Sen.</p>
<p>When the Six-Eared Macaque was back to deified class, it
immediately kneeled before Han Sen and said, “I’m willing to follow
you, now and forever. I hope you let bygones be bygones and are
still willing to take me under your wing.”</p>
<p>While its mouth spoke, in the Six-Eared Macaque’s heart, it was
saying to itself, “Let me find out your true self. Then, I will
find a chance to escape this trap and maybe even kill you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen could discern what the Six-Eared Macaque was thinking,
but he didn’t confront the beast. He coldly said, “You should think
this through. Once you start following me, there is no chance for
regret.”</p>
<p>“I have thought about it. I will only follow you for the rest of
my life, and I will only ever pledge allegiance to you,” the
Six-Eared Macaque said dramatically, but his true intent was the
opposite.</p>
<p>“Get up and tell me your name.” Han Sen allowed the Six-Eared
Macaque to stand up.</p>
<p>“I am the Six-Eared Macaque. I do not have a name,” the creature
said.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will give you a name.” Han Sen fell silent for
some time, and then said, “Since you are a monkey deified
xenogeneic and a Six-Eared Macaque, I will call you Little Number
Six.”</p>
<p>The Six-Eared Macaque froze when it heard Han Sen’s grand
pronouncement. Its heart complained, “That is a crap name! He was
quiet for so long, and he ended up giving me such a childish
name.”</p>
