<p>Han Sen had long been curious about Destiny’s Tower, and that
was because this stone Destiny’s Tower was just like the metal
Destiny’s Tower inside his Sea of Soul. Aside from the towers being
made of different materials—one having been made of stone and other
having been made of metal—there was no difference.</p>
<p>Four deified elites used their powers to force open the gate to
Destiny’s Tower. Only one person could go in while the gate was
being held up. Once he received the signal, Han Sen immediately ran
into the tower.</p>
<p>Deng!</p>
<p>Han Sen had just entered the tower when the door slammed shut
behind him.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen knew the process, though, he wasn’t afraid.</p>
<p>The four deified elites had to use formation powers just to get
the door open, and it could only be kept open for a single second.
It simply wasn’t feasible to keep it open any longer than that.</p>
<p>Han Sen was given one month to spend in Destiny’s Tower. When
that month was up, the door would open again, and Han Sen would be
allowed to leave.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around the tower. He had heard there was supposed
to be an amazing geno art located inside the tower, and any
creature that learned it would be able to increase the speed of
their evolution. But everyone who left the tower seemed to practice
different geno arts. That made Han Sen curious about whether the
rumor was true.</p>
<p>Han Sen was on the first floor of Destiny’s Tower. The layout
was exactly like his own Destiny’s Tower, but there were some
paintings hanging on the walls of this tower.</p>
<p>The pictures were supposedly the geno arts of legend, but when
Han Sen looked closer, he realized that the pictures were not geno
arts at all. They were drawings of people.</p>
<p>The pictures were of a man. Han Sen couldn’t tell if he was
human, crystallizer, Extreme King, or one of the Sky. They all
looked so similar that it was hard to tell the precise race of the
man in the painting.</p>
<p>But this man wasn’t drawn like an average person. He was drawn
like a god atop an altar. Every wall held a picture depicting the
same man in a different position, but no matter how he was posed,
he seemed to be looking out of the picture with disdain. It was
somehow uncomfortable to meet the painted man’s gaze.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen knew it was just a drawing, not a living man,
the painted man gave him a chilled feeling. It was like the eyes of
the man could see right through his soul or something.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He longer he looked at the painting, the more
he wanted to avoid it. That wasn’t normal.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with this drawing? Or is it like a
jade spirit in the White Jade Jing? Is it actually alive?” Han Sen
looked at the man in the painting, but try as he might, he couldn’t
discern its true nature.</p>
<p>He looked across the whole first floor, but he found nothing
except for pictures of that one man. Han Sen silently moved on to
the second floor.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the second floor, Han Sen frowned. This floor had
paintings of the man on every wall as well. He was just posed in
different positions than he had been on the first floor.</p>
<p>“This entire tower isn’t just full of this one man’s paintings,
is it?” Han Sen’s heart jumped, and so he proceeded to the third
floor.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen was unlucky. His guess had been correct. The
third floor held the same paintings.</p>
<p>Each floor in the tower had eight walls. Each wall had a
painting of its own. Han Sen walked all the way from the first
floor to the sixth floor, and he saw forty-eight of the man’s
paintings in total.</p>
<p>It was the same person in every painting. He was just in a
different position in each one. He would be sitting in one, while
in another, he could be standing or lying down. All the pictures
had the man in a different position. But no matter what his
position was, the man’s eyes were always the same. Han Sen hated
those eyes.</p>
<p>The man wasn’t ugly. In fact, Han Sen thought he was quite
handsome. The man had a smile that should have been loveable, but
instead, Han Sen loathed it. He couldn’t put his finger on why.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a little surprised by that realization, because he
didn’t like judging people by their appearance. It didn’t matter if
a person looked nice or horrible; he would not form a real opinion
on them until he learned more about who they really were.</p>
<p>But now, looking at these paintings, Han Sen already hated this
man. That was not normal at all.</p>
<p>Trying to suppress his hatred, Han Sen climbed to the highest
floor. This was the seventh floor.</p>
<p>If the stone Destiny’s Tower was related to his metal Destiny’s
Tower, the seventh floor should have a space Bai Sema. That was
where Han Sen imprisoned people in his own tower.</p>
<p>As soon as Han Sen stepped onto the seventh floor of Destiny’s
Tower, he stopped dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>There were no more of those paintings on the seventh floor.
There was just a stone platform in the middle of the room. Someone
was sitting atop the stone platform, and Han Sen realized instantly
that it was the same man showcased in the forty-eight paintings
across the lower floors.</p>
<p>He sat atop the stone platform, his legs crossed like a buddha.
His hands were down, and his eyes were shut. It was like he was
sleeping.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t detect a lifeforce coming from the man, though.
The man was like a statue. With Han Sen’s eyesight, though, he
could tell the man actually was alive. He could see the man’s pores
and the pink of his skin.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see most of his vessels, too. Aside from the fact
that he wasn’t breathing, he really did look like someone who was
alive.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to inspect the man. It was odd
that the man looked so alive while giving off utterly no indication
of lifeforce. Even after scanning the man, Han Sen couldn’t tell if
he was living or dead. That was extremely weird.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was examining the man, some sort of odd wave began
to pass through the air around the man’s body. The air moved in a
circle, like a nearly invisible whirlpool.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a step back. He soon realized that the swirl was
just a lifeforce, not anything harmful.</p>
<p>What astonished Han Sen the most, though, was that the black
crystal armor in his Sea of Soul reacted to the whirlpool. The
armor began to tremble. A mysterious power flowed out of the armor
and sank into Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt himself become really heavy. It was like the cells
inside his body had been frozen in place by that mysterious power.
The Dongxuan Sutra and Han Sen’s other primary geno arts had been
locked down by the strange power as well.</p>
<p>Only the Original Water King Body and a few other powers Han Sen
had absorbed were still active inside his body.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Han Sen asked in sudden trepidation. Then the
man slowly opened his eyes. It looked like he was smiling at Han
Sen, but he wasn’t.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart flared with that feeling of hatred again, but
this time, it was one thousand times stronger than it had been when
he saw those pictures. Han Sen managed to suppress the feelings and
keep them from showing on his face.</p>
<p>Han Sen finally figured out where the feelings were coming from,
though. The passionate hatred inside him was flowing out of the
black crystal armor. It wasn’t his own emotion.</p>
<p>The man stared at Han Sen the same way he’d gazed out of the
paintings. He smiled and coldly asked, “Do you believe that this
world has a God?”</p>
