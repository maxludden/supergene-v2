<h2>The Screen Is Gone</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2441</h3>

<p>Wan’er struck too fast for Han Sen to dodge. His fast reflexes
moved his head far enough back that she didn’t strike him directly,
but her fingertips still tore into his face.</p>
<p>Three deep gashes were torn into Han Sen’s face. The clefts were
so deep that his skull became visible through them.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He was still in his super god spirit body
mode, but Wan’er’s fingers had damaged him anyway. This was the
first time something of the sort had ever happened.</p>
<p>Luckily, he managed to dodge most of her attack. Otherwise, his
entire head would have split open like a cut watermelon.</p>
<p>Han Sen instinctually started to return to the sanctuaries. His
super god spirit body couldn’t block Wan’er’s power if she chose to
attack him again, so he couldn’t escape by traditional means if she
wanted to fight him.</p>
<p>But Wan’er didn’t attack him again. She stood where she was,
unmoving. She looked at the blood on her fingers, which was Han
Sen’s blood.</p>
<p>A little life came back to her eyes, and her golden power began
to fade.</p>
<p>“Do we affect each other?” Han Sen thought happily. He gritted
his teeth and grabbed Wan’er’s arm. He examined her.</p>
<p>As Wan’er’s body came closer to Han Sen, her gold color faded
much faster.</p>
<p>When he saw that Wan’er wasn’t resisting, Han Sen pulled her
into his arms. When their bodies were in physical contact, Wan’er’s
golden power vanished completely. Her eyes looked fully cognizant
for the first time.</p>
<p>“Good brother, it’s so nice to have you here,” Wan’er mumbled
against Han Sen’s chest. She was lying forward against him, and she
slowly closed her eyes.</p>
<p>After she spoke, Wan’er’s body went soft. Her consciousness
drifted away as it had before.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and looked at the girl in his arms. Her
lifeforce was weaker than it had been the previous time, when she
was in a coma. Now, her lifeforce was like that of a dying old
woman. She no longer had the vitality of a teenage lady.</p>
<p>“Does this mean that using the golden power costs her the
strength of her lifeforce?” Han Sen looked at the lady thoughtfully
as a variety of emotions shifted across her expression.</p>
<p>This girl was the only person Han Sen had ever encountered who
could threaten him in his super god spirit body mode. It might have
been a good idea to get rid of her, but there were so many unknowns
about the girl. A lot of questions had been raised by her
existence, and she did seem to harbor some sort of connection to
Han Sen. He really, really needed to figure out what was going on
here.</p>
<p>“As long as she is next to me, she can’t make use of that scary
power. So, I suppose I don’t have to be too afraid. I need to
figure out what she is before I do anything drastic.” Han Sen
sighed, set the girl down, and then looked across the hall.</p>
<p>The hall had only been home to the statue, and Han Sen looked
around for a while, but he didn’t find anything useful there. And
the materials that composed the hall were too tough to be broken
through, so Han Sen couldn’t search any further.</p>
<p>Han Sen did find a piece of red crystal that was around the size
of his hand, though. It was inside the remains of the red eyeball.
He put it in his pocket, then went back the way he had come.</p>
<p>“Now that the statue has been destroyed, I wonder if the red-eye
condition is still in effect.” Han Sen went back the way he had
come to take a look.</p>
<p>But when he reached the place that he had left Miss Mirror, he
didn’t see her there.</p>
<p>“Did she go back to camp? That really isn’t her style.” Han Sen
frowned, then began walking a little faster.</p>
<p>Even if the red-eye power infecting Miss Mirror had vanished,
she wouldn’t simply go home. She would have stayed where she was
and waited for Han Sen to return so she could grill him thoroughly
over what had happened.</p>
<p>Plus, the pieces of the shattered tree egg were still lying
around. If Miss Mirror had decided to leave, she would have at
least taken the pieces of the tree egg with her. They were a
valuable treasure.</p>
<p>“It’s good that she is gone, then. That means all of these tree
egg shards are mine.” Han Sen picked up a piece and started to put
it away. As he did, he noticed how nice the chunk of egg smelled.
But there didn’t seem to be any lifeforce within the pieces of egg.
And furthermore, there was no semblance of power. This definitely
wasn’t what Han Sen had expected.</p>
<p>“No wonder Miss Mirror left these behind. They’re already
useless. Did Wan’er absorb the powers of the tree egg while she was
inside it?” Han Sen guessed. He couldn’t think of any other
explanations.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept walking back the way he had come. He didn’t
encounter any more trouble. Wan’er was still in her coma, and her
body was so weak that it looked like the final tether of her life
would break at any second.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know why the girl had been reduced to such a
condition. If this continued, she wouldn’t last long.</p>
<p>Strangely, though, Han Sen found no evidence of the wall of
pictures on his return trip. The wall seemed to have just vanished
into thin air, without a trace.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued walking back toward camp, and when the first
statue came into view, he froze. Miss Mirror was lying in front of
the statue, and a woman was kneeling beside her. The woman was
praying to the statue of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes. It
was one of the four Kings. It was Red Cloud.</p>
<p>The scene before him was the same as the sixth picture depicted
on the screen’s mural. It gave Han Sen a chill.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Han Sen was confused. He looked at Red Cloud
and Miss Mirror, unsure what was happening.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s presence was still there. She wasn’t dead, but she
seemed to be badly wounded as she lay on the ground. She obviously
wasn’t doing well.</p>
<p>Red Cloud knelt before the statue like a sincere believer. Her
eyes were closed and her hands were folded as she prayed.</p>
<p>“No way! Red Cloud never saw the statue. And didn’t Miss Mirror
tell her to watch over the base? Why is she here? Did the red-eye
power become contagious? That means Bao’er and Ning Yue are in
danger.” Anxiety grew in the pit of Han Sen’s stomach, and he
started jogging forward.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen reached the statue, Red Cloud opened her eyes.
Her eyes were the color of blood, and they contained two pupils
each. That was the look people had when they were stricken with the
power of the Blood Eye Evil God.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen, Red Cloud looked murderous. She picked up
the broken sword, but instead of striking Han Sen, she turned and
thrust the broken blade into Miss Mirror’s chest.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he used his Jadeskin Area to freeze
Red Cloud.</p>
<p>Red Cloud was only King class, so she was unable to defeat Han
Sen. The red-eye powers were running through her too strongly for
her to know what she was doing. She couldn’t block Han Sen’s power,
and so she ended up frozen.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked up to Miss Mirror. He crouched, looked at her,
and smiled.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror, why are you lying around at a time like this?”</p>
<p>“Use your sword to break the statue,” Miss Mirror said quietly
through gritted teeth. Her eyes were still a deep red.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel that the statue still had that red-eye power,
but it wasn’t as strong as the statue Wan’er had destroyed earlier.
It didn’t make him want to run deep into the city. It just wanted
him to go to the statue itself.</p>
<p>Clearly, although the Blood Eye Evil God had been killed, this
statue still had some of that Blood Eye Evil God power.</p>
