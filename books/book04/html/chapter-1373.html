    <p>
      The moment Han Sen entered the tangled complex that was Hidden Valley, he
      felt his Dongxuan Aura become overwhelmed. The knotted labyrinth was
      almost too much for it to process, and it suffered, becoming little more
      than a garbled transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen did not need to use it like radar. He could still
      detect and sense the lifeforces of the land around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrusting into that messy region, Han Sen made sure to remain fleet of
      foot. Nan Litian was still pursuing, and he swung wildly at the plants
      that sought to slow his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was not slowed down by the brush, though. He utilized his Dongxuan
      Movement and Heavenly Go to sidestep every vine and leaf that reached out
      to slow him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the staggeringly tall trees and plants, vines wreathed their way
      through that wretched landscape, giving Han Sen flashbacks to his time in
      the Third God’s Sanctuary. Many of those vines were so thick, not even Nan
      Litian could cut his way through them, and he had to clumsily dodge around
      them instead. For the first time that day, Han Sen was at an advantage.
      With the delicate grace of his maneuvering, he went for the deepest,
      furthest, creepiest reaches of Hidden Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow told Han Sen there were many strange growths in the valley.
      There were trees composed of hideous, tangled snakes, and there were even
      vines that had bloodshot eyeballs that blinked ferociously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although most of the plants in that area were just there, and did not seek
      to bring harm to those brave enough to explore, the ones that did were
      extremely dangerous. Han Sen had to stay on his toes, not only for the
      enraged madman chasing him, but for what he might unwittingly find himself
      running into.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was sort of what Han Sen had hoped for. The last thing he wanted
      was to become swallowed by a man-eating plant, but he needed to lead Nan
      Litian into a hostile plant. If he was crafty enough, he could get the
      plants to free him from his pursuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen detected a nearby plant that possessed a mammoth
      lifeforce that blazed like the brightest bonfire. Han Sen ran towards it,
      ready to risk alerting its attention not to him, but to Nan Litian, who
      was still hot on his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was ten meters away from that lifeforce, the knots of the
      overgrowth swarmed Han Sen’s vision, obscuring where and what exactly that
      plant was. It was all a great mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had forced Han Sen to slow down, and it had provided Nan Litian the
      opportunity to catch up. His enemy thrust forward with his sword, ready to
      deliver a final strike. When his sword found a target, though, the sound
      of a metallic drang rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen raised his head, now alerted to Nan Litian’s alarmingly close
      presence. When he searched for what his foe had hit, he noticed the
      jade-like trunk of a tree he had not seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have just appeared there, and when Han Sen examined this tree, he
      looked down to observe the roots. There, half-submerged in the soil, were
      many jade bulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only their heads were sticking out of the soil, and one of them had taken
      notice of Han Sen. The bull stared at him with red, frightening eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian must have struck the horn of one of those bulls, and Han Sen
      now noticed the fiery lifeforce he had previously detected was a
      combination of the tree and those bulls.
    </p>
    <p>“Moo!”</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the bull Nan Litian had struck made a sound.</p>
    <p>
      The bull stomped its way out of the soil with the ground-shaking march of
      an elephant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lowered its head and exhaled a flame-tinged lung-full out of its
      twitching nostrils. It was mad, and it looked ready to chase down not just
      Nan Litian, but Han Sen, as well; making a fine kebab with its horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its speed was terrifying. Before Han Sen could bring himself to dodge the
      creature, it was before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen only had the time to reach out and grab the horn. But when his
      fingers fell upon it, the bull lifted its head upwards, throwing Han Sen
      into the air, towards the twig-pricking tops of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke through several branches on his way upwards, but he found himself
      brought to a stop against something soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt himself fall into the center of a silver flower. The bud
      inside was around the size of a double-bed. It was plush and comfy; a
      surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt a wash of relief come upon him, and for a brief instant, he
      thought himself safer than he had been all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he soon saw that this was not a place for respite. Han Sen’s landing
      there was not a coincidence, for he saw Nan Litian also fare an upward
      launching. His nemesis of the day ended up on another flower exactly like
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to escape before something worse was to occur. That which
      was most wretched, often disguised itself as the fairest, after all. And
      as soon as he tried to make a move, that proved to be true. The
      pleasantness of the flower swiftly evaporated, as a number of vines
      reached upwards to tie Han Sen up with the ease of a shoelace. Han Sen
      turned his gaze towards Nan Litian.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the same was happening to him. He too had been captured by a flower.
    </p>
    <p>They were wrapped up so much, they now looked like mummies.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought it might have been a carnivorous flower, but after it
      wrapped him up, nothing else occurred. No digestive acid was released, and
      no chomping teeth were revealed.
    </p>
    <p>“Moo!”</p>
    <p>
      The bull shouted in their direction again; then, it returned to the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bull went inside head first, and all they could see was its tail,
      sticking out at the base of the tree like a stubborn root.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen could not imagine how strong and hardy the tree was.</p>
    <p>
      But with nothing better to do, Han Sen was now able to examine it and
      record its finer details. He noticed there were eight bulls encircling the
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tree also had many more of the silver flowers the two had been trapped
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked around and saw Nan Litian struggling in an attempt to
      escape. It was a far tougher wrap than even he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why are you chasing me? Can you just tell me? Are you really willing to
      risk your life this much, if it means you get to kill me?” Han Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen still had Super Spank, so if he wanted to escape, he believed he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      But seeing as nothing else was going on, Han Sen thought it best to ask as
      many questions as he could, while his enemy was also restrained.
    </p>
    <p>“I need to kill the traitor,” Nan Litian coldly responded.</p>
    <p>“I thought you wanted my Nine-Life Cat pendant?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Who would want that? It’s just a trinket belonging to your family.” Nan
      Litian spoke in a voice that suggested he was humiliated by the question.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen eyed him queerly, thinking his reaction to be strange.</p>
