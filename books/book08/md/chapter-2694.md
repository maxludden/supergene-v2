  Aside from providing him with healing geno fluids, she gave him other kinds of geno fluids as well. They could help with all sorts of things involving his body and his practice. They were fluids synthesized by the Very High themselves. Due to the wealth of resources available in Outer Sky, Han Sen was being given access to resources that few Kings could ever hope to get their hands on.

The Very High didn’t have a large population. They didn’t have many people devoted to producing healing geno fluids, but they also rarely used healing geno fluids themselves. So, most of the time, the Very High created the geno fluids quite slowly. They kept enough on hand for ordinary use, but as Han Sen stubbornly continued to fight the Red Blood Demon, he had created a situation that the Very High were uniquely unprepared for.

Within a month, Han Sen had almost cleared out their geno fluid reserves. If he wanted more, he would have to wait for more to be created. That meant one every few days.

“Why are there no more healing geno fluids?” Han Sen saw the geno fluids Exquisite had brought him, and he noticed they weren’t the same geno fluids he usually used. Rather than the healing fluids that he really needed, these other geno fluids would merely reinforce his genes and physical power.

“Even if there was a whole warehouse full of healing geno fluid, it wouldn’t be enough to support the amount you keep consuming,” Exquisite said. She pointed toward a box with six red geno fluids and went on to say, “This is a high-class healing geno fluid. They only offer it to deified fighters. Since there are no more of the weaker fluids available, you are being gifted these. Do not go through them willy-nilly. If you use up these, you won’t be granted any more for the next two weeks.”

Exquisite didn’t know that Blood Marrow Geno Fluid had the xenogeneic genes of the Red Blood Demon in it. After all, few people knew exactly what was inside a medicine when they took it. The Red Blood Demon’s xenogeneic genes were just one element of these fluids. They weren’t even the primary ingredient.

Even if Exquisite had known the xenogeneic genes were in the fluid, she wouldn’t have known about the potential side effects in this situation. Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng knew about this because one of their elders had used a large amount of Blood Marrow Geno Fluid before going into the Jail Demon Hall to kill the Red Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon had instantly gone into a fury.

Luckily, the man had been a larva class deified. Despite the Red Blood Demon’s rage, he had been able to kill it. Only a few people who were close to that elite knew about this. Exquisite and Li Keer didn’t know much about that elite, so they didn’t know how taking the geno fluid would affect the monster inside the hall. Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng wouldn’t have come up with this plan if the creature’s reaction to the geno fluid was generally known.

Hearing that there was an even better geno fluid that he could use, Han Sen was more than pleased. If he could recover faster, he could spend more time fighting the Red Blood Demon.

Although he was unable to beat the Red Blood Demon, he was honing his talents as he fought the creature. That was because the Red Blood Demon had been continuously suppressing him. Han Sen had gained a huge amount of experience by being so determined.

“This kind of wound really hurts.” Han Sen looked down at his chest and saw his exposed heart, which had come close to being shredded. He had a wry smile.

If Han Sen had lacked his impressive abilities of recovery, such a strike would have likely killed him.

Opening a Blood Marrow Geno Fluid, Han Sen quickly gulped it all down. He felt a warm sensation race through his body. A numb, itchy feeling passed over his wounds, and Han Sen’s injuries began to heal. He watched in amazement as his wounds sealed closed.

“This is good stuff. No wonder this is considered a superior item usually reserved for deified elites. The effects are ten times stronger than what I was using before.” Han Sen grinned widely when he saw the wounds heal so quickly.

His wounds would have taken half a day to heal previously, but now they took less than an hour.

But the Apollo Set hadn’t recovered yet, so Han Sen had to keep waiting. Without the Apollo Set, his body wouldn’t last.

Han Sen didn’t waste a single second of his free time, though. He practiced Very Real Body and God’s Wander for a bit. Those two geno arts were very beneficial for him to practice with. They could be used at any time.

When the Apollo Set had finally recovered, Han Sen decided it was time to enter Jail Demon Hall again.

But to Han Sen’s surprise, the Red Blood Demon was sitting on the stairs staring at him when he entered. It didn’t attack him as soon as it saw him.

“What is this?” Han Sen wondered. It seemed odd that on this random day, the Red Blood Demon’s temper had improved so much.

While Han Sen wondered what it was doing, the Red Blood Demon’s body flashed with a bloody light. Its bug wings opened. The strange horn on its head flashed with a crimson that looked like a sun.

“Holy shit! What is going on with this guy? Why has it suddenly exploded with a scary power like this?” Han Sen was very confused. He had fought the Red Blood Demon for a very long time now, but he had never seen it so enraged. And it had suddenly gained a frightening amount of power.

Before Han Sen had time to consider his situation, he saw the Red Blood Demon’s evil-looking crimson eyes light up like lightbulbs and turn to stare at him. Han Sen didn’t say anything. He just wanted to teleport away from Jail Demon Hall.

Han Sen couldn’t fight the Red Blood Demon at its normal power level, but now, it was a raging version of itself. For all he knew, this thing could destroy his body in one punch and cripple him, leaving him no chance of teleporting away.

But the moment Han Sen ripped space open to leave, he saw all of the markings across Jail Demon Hall light up in a single, brilliant flash. The whole of the Jail Demon Hall was covered in a holy light.

Pang!

Han Sen bounced out of space and almost hit the ground. He descended into a nice roll, which was how he managed to maintain his balance.

“What is this? Why have Jail Demon Hall’s restrictions flared up and sealed the entire structure with me inside?” Han Sen’s face changed. He looked around frantically, and he found that wavy beams of light covered every surface of the hall. The whole building was sealed up tight, and there was no getting out now.

Han Sen realized that he was in a scary and dangerous situation. Jail Demon Hall was sealed, and he couldn’t use God’s Wander to leave. He was trapped inside with the beast.

Furthermore, the Red Blood Demon had become far more dangerous than usual. When Han Sen had fought the Red Blood Demon previously, he could only last a few minutes. But now, the Red Blood Demon was in a scary mode.

Thinking of this, Han Sen turned his attention back to the Red Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon’s eyes were giving off red light. It looked like a small flashlight—the beam of which landed on Han Sen.

“What is this… I thought we were friends! I’m just taking a break here, you go and do your stuff… No need to worry about me…” Han Sen forced a smile at the Red Blood Demon as he spoke.

The Red Blood Demon actually smiled back at Han Sen. But that smile sent a chill down his spine. The jagged, razor-like teeth that lined its maw were particularly menacing to see. It was like a demon that could destroy and devour anything.

The next second, the Red Blood Demon let out a strange screech. Its body was like a red shadow, and it was coming straight for Han Sen. Han Sen’s eyesight couldn’t read its movements, either. He saw the flash of a red shadow, but the Red Blood Demon remained where it was. Then, another Red Blood Demon appeared in front of him. Its sharp claws were already digging into his chest.
