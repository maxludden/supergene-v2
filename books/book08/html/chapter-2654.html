<h2>An Accurate Kill That Is Like a Surgical Incision</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2654</h3>

<p>Han Sen spent several long minutes in observation before he
finally flew forward to strike that bug. When he was close enough
to it, he suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already
above the bug’s shell.</p>
<p>“God’s Wander?” Exquisite was shocked to see this. She was
intimately familiar with the teleporting method he had used.
Although he was only teleporting a short distance, the move was
still impressive for a beginner. It was strange, though,
considering she had only given him God’s Wander a short while ago.
If Han Sen had become this proficient with it already, he was more
than brilliant. His talents really were out-of-this-world.</p>
<p>“Does he really have an eleven armor talent?” Exquisite couldn’t
help but wonder. Han Sen’s body was unique. If the God Spirit
Touch’s result was genuine, it was nuts.</p>
<p>Han Sen teleported behind the star beetle, but the star beetle
didn’t react. And then, Han Sen pointed a finger at its brain.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>There was a small ringing noise, like a steel needle striking
bone. It was barely even audible. And right after, Han Sen pulled
his finger away. The star beetle didn’t struggle at all after the
strike. It simply gave a tiny shiver. The beetle grew still again
as if nothing had happened, but its lifeforce was waning fast. It
didn’t take long for its flame to fully extinguish.</p>
<p>The star beetle was in the same position as before. It was lying
atop the branch, but if one looked closely, one could see a very
small hole in its head that led down to the creature’s brain.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic King hunted: Star Beetle. Xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>A hunting announcement rang in Han Sen’s head.</p>
<p>“What excellent powers of observation. That was a very strong
ability. His body is evolving fairly well. Exquisite, I think you
found yourself a decent silkworm,” the old man said. He looked at
Han Sen with a genuine sense of appreciation for the young man’s
performance.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s attack had been very good. What the elder admired most
about the scene was that Han Sen had taken the time to observe the
creature before committing to action. He wasn’t a reckless man
whose body operated faster than his brain.</p>
<p>Recklessness wasn’t always a bad thing. If a warrior fought
someone of the same tier, the fight was usually a matter of life or
death for both combatants. Neither fighter would have the
opportunity to spend time deliberating their actions. The body’s
first response was usually the most useful.</p>
<p>But taking care of those bugs didn’t require those instantaneous
reactions. Han Sen had no idea what the star beetles were before
this day. He had only observed them for a moment before killing one
in a single hit. He had managed to sever the star beetle’s nervous
system. It couldn’t even react before it died. So, the damage dealt
to the star tree was minimized. That was why the old man really
admired Han Sen.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen had known all about the star beetles before he even
began this test, but his methods of attack were still obscenely
rough. He wasn’t dealing much damage to the star tree, but compared
to Han Sen, he was leaving a lot of wreckage in his wake.</p>
<p>Han Sen started to attack more of the star beetles. He
teleported and used his Under the Sky knife skills. The knife silks
he controlled were as accurate as a surgical blade. His strikes
would pierce through the beetles’ shells and sever their major
nerve pathways. Under such precise attacks, each star beetle died
without the chance to fight back.</p>
<p>Star beetles were falling to Han Sen one after another. Han Sen
was like a skilled surgeon. Each cut he made had the precision of a
razor. He was able to kill a hundred star beetles without missing
once. None of the beetles stood a chance of resisting.</p>
<p>The old man was shocked. Exquisite’s eyes were glued to the
video. Her mind was also connected to Han Sen’s mind, and it was as
if she was with Han Sen, killing those star beetles right then and
there.</p>
<p>That was the benefit of having a silkworm. She could share a
bond and feel the same things as her silkworm did, thereby learning
and experiencing something that she wasn’t familiar with. It was a
learning experience for her, too.</p>
<p>As Han Sen went from King class to deified or even further,
Exquisite wouldn’t level up with him. However, she would feel his
evolution process as if it was happening to her. So, when she
became deified, she would have all that experience. It was like she
was being reborn, and there was no need for her to worry about
going along the wrong path.</p>
<p>The King class star beetles were nothing compared to Exquisite;
she could kill them with ease. Being as accurate as Han Sen and
obliterating a beetle’s nerves so that it couldn’t even struggle—in
addition to the fact he was killing so many star beetles without
making a mistake—Exquisite couldn’t have done the same.</p>
<p>Exquisite could feel Han Sen’s reactions, and that was what
shocked her the most.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s simple finger attack looked easy. But before he did
it, he used a lot of predictive powers. He calculated everything
that could happen while he was performing the strike.</p>
<p>Even a straight strike had many potential ramifications
depending on its speed and power. If Exquisite hadn’t been able to
feel what Han Sen was thinking, she never would have guessed that
there were so many complicated calculations running through his
mind.</p>
<p>“This guy’s power is so strong. It is something you rarely see.
Even those of us with the Very High Sense aren’t capable of
insanity like this.” Exquisite’s emotions were quite
conflicted.</p>
<p>The more she studied Han Sen, the more she believed him to be a
scary person.</p>
<p>Han Sen no longer looked like he was fighting. It was more like
he was finishing work that was supposed to have already been
finished. He didn’t have to worry about much because everything was
under his control.</p>
<p>Sharing Han Sen’s mind allowed Exquisite to learn a lot, but it
also made her feel even more conflicted with facing Han Sen
now.</p>
<p>The Very High were quite full of themselves, and that carried
through strongly in how they treated their silkworms. The masters
often acted high and mighty. Right now, Exquisite was feeling the
complete opposite.</p>
<p>The more she learned about Han Sen, the more she thought Han Sen
was scarier than she was.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic King hunted: Star Beetle. Xenogeneic gene found.
Obtained Star Beetle beast soul.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen killed a hundred star beetles, he earned a star
beetle beast soul. He looked into his Sea of Soul, and he
immediately noticed that the star beetle beast soul was an
armor-type.That didn’t surprise Han Sen. He had guessed that the
star beetles would drop armor beast souls as soon as he saw
them.</p>
<p>“Armor beast souls aren’t bad. When I take control of the
Constellation Sea, I can build a human army. At that point, beast
souls like this will definitely prove their worth.” Han Sen thought
about a human army decked out in beast soul armor. It would be a
shocking sight.</p>
<p>“It would be great if there was a deified class star beetle
beast soul up for grabs,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>This was merely a random thought, of course. He didn’t think he
would actually have to fight a deified star beetle because the old
man said he wouldn’t be allowed to use geno treasures. He didn’t
have enough power to kill a deified xenogeneic on his own yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew around the tree, searching for more star beetles to
slay. He eventually heard a buzzing noise in his ear.</p>
<p>The sound seemed to be coming from above. Han Sen raised his
head and glanced through the gaps between the leaves. There, he saw
a whole bunch of star beetles descending from the sky. They were
all coming to the star tree.</p>
<p>The leader of the star beetles had a body that looked like icy
jade. It glowed with a blue light, which was a beautiful sight. The
scary presence proved its identity, as well. It was a deified star
beetle.</p>
