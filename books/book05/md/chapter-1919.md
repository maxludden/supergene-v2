  “The Jade Turtle Spell? You already had a plan for slowing Han Sen down?” Flower King asked, looking at the spell that had been cast on Han Sen.

Moon Wheel King said coldly, “The speed of those shoes may not mean much to us, and they wouldn’t work if there were Dukes on the field. Against lower level opponents, however, they make the boy undefeatable. So, I had a plan to mitigate that.”

Flower King was shocked, and he said, “The Jade Turtle Spell comes from the remains of a deified turtle. There are only 1365 of them in existence. They can only be used once to suppress creatures and slow them down. Not even Kings can withstand them. After all these years, very few remain. It is a waste to use one on a Baron.”

Moon Wheel King looked tired, and he said, “That is why Rebecca did not use it at first. She did not expect this spring could provide so much. But since the spring was so abundant, and the shoes were proving too much of a challenge, she had no choice but to use the spell.”

“She made a good decision. From how the spring has performed thus far, I’m guessing that it will erupt another three or four times. It was worth using it. If we failed to bring back a single droplet, I doubt our wives would soon forgive us.” Flower King and Moon Wheel King both looked at each other.

Han Sen’s body was near the spring’s eye now. His legs felt as if they were made of lead. He used all the power he could to fuel his rabbit shoes, but he was still as slow as he would have been if he wasn’t wearing the shoes at all.

Han Sen wished to detach the spell card, but it stuck to him tightly. It was like it was magnetized to him and he couldn’t remove it. In addition to his decreased speed, his jumping and flying abilities were restricted. But those aside, Han Sen could still use his power.

Seeing Han Sen get hit by the turtle spell and fall next to the spring eye, Sword Know and the others were delighted. The Tego Earl ran forward with his tiger fist to strike Han Sen.

When Han Sen had been able to use his rabbit shoes to full-effect, he had not been afraid of the attack. But now that he was so slow, he could not dodge the fist and its hammering light.

Han Sen was next to the spring’s eye, yes, but he was not worried. Han Sen summoned something from his Sea of Soul, a red mist suddenly wrapped up his right hand. It was like a glove made of silk.

This glove was obtained from the Red Mist Mink that Han Sen had killed before. It was a glove beast soul that increased the speed and power of Han Sen’s hand.

Perhaps it was because he had yet to match the Earl class of the item itself, but it only wrapped up one hand.

But to Han Sen, that would be enough. The Nobles he contended with were Earls at best, and what’s more, they had only just become Earls. They’d only be slightly stronger than the glove at best, and it was likely they were weaker.

Han Sen donned the glove and clutched his Ghost Teeth Knife. Seeing the incoming strike headed for him, he did not try to evade it. Instead, he threw his own attack directly towards it.

Because Spell was not a Viscount yet, Han Sen could not use Jadeskin, Mutant Blood, nor the Dongxuan Sutra. He could only use The Story of Genes to fight the Tego Earl.

Everyone there, seeing Han Sen fighting the Tego Earl, frowned. There was no way a Baron could hope to defeat the Tego Earl. Han Sen was not wearing his Marquise armor, either. He could be killed with a single punch.

The Tego Earl saw Han Sen slashing towards his fist, and he looked cold. He increased his speed, hoping to finish Han Sen for good.

A black tiger punch of light came roaring towards Han Sen. It was probably going to turn him into dust.

Ghost Teeth Knife’s blade was purple-black. Without any god light or godly presence, the attack that came forward to meet with the fist looked ordinary.

Katcha!

That scary attack looked incredible, in the eyes of others. But it was cut open by the Ghost Teeth Knife. From top to bottom, it was sliced in two.

Ghost Teeth Knife and the Tego’s fist came against each other, and a dong noise sounded. Han Sen stood where he was, unmoving. The Tego, on the other hand, went stumbling back four steps.

The fist had an obvious knife mark, and blood leaked between the Earl’s fingers.

“Impossible!” The Tego Earl was shocked. The other Earls were stunned, too.

“That glove! There is something amiss with his glove! It is a powerful treasure that increases his strength and speed!” Rebecca was the heir of a half-deity. She knew far more than an ordinary Earl, and she could immediately identify the problem.

Pang!

Before anyone’s daze had been broken, the spring’s eye unleashed another red light. More springwater was up for grabs.

“His movement speed is being suppressed by the Jade Turtle Spell. He cannot steal any more from us, so ignore him!” an Earl shouted.

But Rebecca and the other Earls had already realized this. Silently, they rushed after the springwater.

Rebecca and the others could tell that Han Sen’s hand’s speed and power had increased, but he was still slow to move. He could not fly or pose a significant threat in battle for them. But this belief made the Earl that made the call too comfortable; it’s what prompted his shout. The others were moving already.

A red light shot out of the spring’s eye, as quick as lightning.

Rebecca and the others were prepared to steal the water this time, but just as the light came firing out, a hand snatched it a mere two meters above the ground. Then, many more red balls came out from the red mist spring’s red beam.

Everyone was shocked as they stared at Han Sen’s hand. He was standing near the spring’s eye, and they stared at him in a daze.

The springwater was random. When a droplet rose from the spring, it was initially moving at the speed of light. Not even a Marquise could capture one of those droplets at the moment it spawned. But Han Sen had managed to grab it with his bare hands. That was shocking.

“Dollarcidence?” Rebecca wondered, not able to believe what she was seeing.

“It’s not a coincidence,” Night River King said, as his eyes froze on Han Sen.

Moon Wheel King and the others had realized this, too. It wasn’t by chance, and it shocked them all.

“We cannot let him stay near the red mist spring!” Sword Know was furious now. He slashed towards Han Sen. The Tego came at Han Sen from the other side.
