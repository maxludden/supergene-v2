<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist and the half-deified bug’s claw collided. The
blade-like claws of the beast scratched Han Sen’s armor, drawing a
few light marks across its surface. The armor, however, wasn’t
broken.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist didn’t have enough power to knock away the bug’s
claws.</p>
<p>The bug squealed weirdly. Its body flashed with a purple and red
light, leaving afterimages as it moved. A flurry of purple and red
claw lights came toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>All of those claws, which could tear through space with ease,
came down on Han Sen. The strikes produced a number of light marks
across his Dongxuan Armor, but the light scratches vanished
quickly.</p>
<p>Dragon One and the others kept an eye on Han Sen. If he couldn’t
kite the half-deified bug, they would have to abandon the fight and
escape.</p>
<p>But when they turned to watch, they found Han Sen fighting the
half-deified creature head-to-head. Although he was suppressed, it
was remarkable that the half-deified bug was unable to penetrate
his armor.</p>
<p>“Is that guy really a first-tier King?” Dragon Eight looked
troubled. Even with his indestructible gold dragon body, he
couldn’t block the power of a half-deified’s strike. Han Sen, on
the other hand, seemed to be handling the battle rather easily.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unworried, but it wasn’t because of the strength of
his Dongxuan Armor.</p>
<p>It was true that the Dongxuan Armor was very resilient. For a
first-tier King, it would have ranked as a top-class defensive
armor.</p>
<p>But strength like that still wasn’t enough to withstand the
pummeling of a half-deified creature. Move Mountain Area’s power
was the real reason the bug couldn’t hurt Han Sen.</p>
<p>Move Mountain Area was actually quite special. It didn’t
increase Han Sen’s power or weaken his enemies. Instead, it simply
transferred power.</p>
<p>First, Move Mountain Area required a carrier, and that carrier
could not be a body. While the conch had used its own shell as a
carrier, Han Sen had chosen to use his Dongxuan Armor.</p>
<p>Under the effects of Move Mountain Area, any power that attacked
the carrier would instead be absorbed by the carrier.</p>
<p>It was like a hydroelectric plant on a river. The power of a
river could crush many things, but the Move Mountain Area could
separate some of that power and use it for other things.</p>
<p>Unless the enemy’s power was strong enough to break the Move
Mountain Area and the designated carrier outright, then additional
attacks wouldn’t do any good. In fact, they would actually increase
the carrier’s defensive capabilities.</p>
<p>But Move Mountain Area had two primary downsides. The first con
was that the power absorbed by the carrier couldn’t be transformed
into offensive power and turned back on foes.</p>
<p>The second con was something really bad. The more power the
carrier absorbed, the more pressure it would endure. Although it
wouldn’t crush Han Sen’s body, it would make him move very
slowly.</p>
<p>After using Move Mountain Area, Han Sen could shrug off powerful
blows. But if he wanted to run or attack, he would be too slow to
do so.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in this situation, Han Sen had no plans to attack
the half-deified bug. All he had to do was hold it in place until
Dragon One killed his own bug and came over to help. So, for this
purpose, Han Sen was happy to select Move Mountain Area.</p>
<p>Move Mountain Area had its benefits. Although the bug’s
consuming area continued trying to drain power from Han Sen, it
merely drained the stored power of the carrier. The enemy was
recollecting its own power, and thus it didn’t have any effect on
Han Sen.</p>
<p>The half-deified bug attacked Han Sen furiously. Han Sen tried
to dodge at first, but he soon gave up the attempt. The bug’s
attacks were focused on the Dongxuan Armor, and the destructive
powers the beast wielded had weakened. In the end, it didn’t really
affect Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was very encumbered by that power. He moved so
slowly that it was impossible for him to strike back at the
half-deified bug.</p>
<p>Dragon Eight and the others were all frozen. They saw Han Sen
floating in the air as if he wasn’t the least bit worried. He
ignored the half-deified bug’s attacks like they were no more than
a tickle. He was completely unmoving.</p>
<p>The bug’s creepy consuming area didn’t seem to work on him,
either. His power wasn’t growing any weaker.</p>
<p>They could tell that Han Sen’s blue light area was doing
something, but they were just as bewildered by it as Han Sen had
been when he first saw it. It seemed like magic, an ability that
defied rational explanation.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Dragon One was greatly relieved. He had been
worried that Han Sen wouldn’t be able to keep a half-deified bug
busy. Now, clearly, there was no need for concern. Dragon One
focused all his power on attacking the other half-deified bug.</p>
<p>As he drifted, Han Sen noticed that Dragon Eight was doing
badly. Han Sen sent a few lazy attacks toward the ordinary core
bugs surrounding Dragon Eight, drawing their attention. In seconds,
Han Sen was taking attacks from one half-deified bug and a few
dozen of the King class bugs. Even so, he was still in a totally
fine condition. Dragon Eight and the others stared at him with wide
eyes.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! What kind of defense is that? It’s sick,” a Dragon
King couldn’t help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Han Sen was bored out of his mind. He had grown stronger, but
his movement speed was so low. He moved like a snail. Running was
out of the question.</p>
<p>“I’m going to give this beast soul to Wang Yuhang. He’s the
perfect person to become a punching bag. Move Mountain Area will
suit him very well. He can take the brunt of the enemy’s aggression
while I attack. It really is perfect,” Han Sen thought, quite
pleased with the sudden idea.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen had drawn the attention of so many of the bugs,
Dragon Eight and the others were all free. Dragon One and a
half-deified bug were still engaged in combat.</p>
<p>Han Sen was bored, so he turned himself to watch the
half-deified Dragon fight. Han Sen had always admired the combat
skills of the Dragon. Dragon One’s enemy was half-deified as well,
but the bug was getting destroyed. It would die soon.</p>
<p>Also, while Dragon One was fighting the bugs in close-quarter
combat, the consuming area didn’t seem to affect him.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>As Han Sen was deep in thought, he saw Dragon One punch through
the side of the half-deified bug’s head and straight into its
brain. Despite losing its brain, however, it didn’t stop
fighting.</p>
<p>With a few more strikes, Dragon One ripped the bug’s body into
pieces. It stopped moving.</p>
<p>After Dragon One killed a half-deified bug, he flew over to Han
Sen. He was going to kill the other half-deified bug that Han Sen
had kept occupied.</p>
<p>Dragon One engaged the bug, relieving some of the pressure on
Han Sen. He put away his Move Mountain Area so that he could move
freely again.</p>
<p>The ordinary bugs were no threat to Han Sen. He used his
Dongxuan Movement to travel through the swarm of bugs. The King
class bugs couldn’t do a thing to him, and Han Sen soon found a
chance to take out two.</p>
<p>He didn’t earn a beast soul, though. Han Sen made sure that he
stayed within range of the half-deified bug as he traveled. After a
while, Dragon One delivered a strike that heavily damaged the
half-deified bug. Han Sen gathered up a coin on his finger.</p>
<p>As he used Saving Money, the number on the coin started to
increase. Just as the bug was about to die, Han Sen fired a coin
with the number “12” on its surface.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The badly injured bug exploded under the force of Han Sen’s
Saving Money.</p>
<p>“Mutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Core Demon Bug. Xenogeneic gene
found. Obtained King class mutant beast soul Core Demon Bug.”</p>
