<p>“Han Sen!” Yun Sushang said suddenly.</p>

<p>“Han Sen? What do you mean? Is this connected to Han Sen?” Thousand Feather Crane looked at Yun Sushang with confusion.</p>

<p>“Did you forget? Han Sen was the first in the exam, and through it, he received Under the Sky.” Yun Sushang looked strange as she spoke.</p>

<p>“How am I supposed to know what he selected? Only he made the decision, and I didn’t ask him.” Thousand Feather Crane looked at Yun Sushang. “How do you know that he selected Under the Sky?”</p>

<p>Yun Sushang gave a wry smile and told him the situation between Han Sen and Yun Suyi.</p>

<p>When she finished the story, Thousand Feather Crane’s eyes were wide. “You mean, Han Sen chose Under the Sky because of Yun Suyi? And he fixed Under the Sky’s flaw in such a short amount of time? And on top of that, he taught her the corrected version of Under the Sky? Is such a thing even possible?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t believe it, either. But you can see what she’s doing, plain as day. There are no flaws in her execution. I can’t think of another likelihood.” Yun Sushang’s expression looked disturbed.</p>

<p>“If this is true, then that means Han Sen has performed a great service for Sky Palace. He has fixed an ancient problem. This guy is a genius, no doubt. He will be an incredibly important person in the future.” Thousand Feather Crane complimented him.</p>

<p>“It is hard to say that now. Yun Suyi’s opponent is just Angia, remember. When she faces a stronger opponent, we will have to see if there are still flaws in Han Sen’s modifications.” Yun Sushang retreated into thought for a moment, before going on to say, “When this ends, we will take Yun Suyi with us to report to father. He should be able to find out the truth of this.”</p>

<p>As they had their discussion, Angia was in the midst of a difficult situation.</p>

<p>Angia was far stronger than Yun Suyi. If Yun Suyi’s power was equivalent to an average human, then Angia was a big and scary shark. His power could kill Yun Suyi with ease.</p>

<p>But currently, Angia was a shark that had been caught on a hook. Yun Suyi would add some slack to the cord whenever he struggled, so he couldn’t use strength to get away.</p>

<p>However, whenever he relaxed a little, the wire would tighten. Angia could not exercise any of his strengths. The hook continued to sink deeper into him, and he was getting tangled up even further by Under the Sky.</p>

<p>“I have lost. Sister Yun is very strong. This must be the Yun family’s technique that is called Under the Sky. It is fairly amazing. It is one of the best knifeskills in the world, for sure.” Angia was smart. He knew he was going to lose, so if he kept fighting for the sake of it, it’d only be a matter of time before things took an ugly turn for him. As a result, he chose to concede and save face.</p>

<p>But he carefully pointed out where Under the Sky came from, and he only admitted that he lost to Under the Sky. He did not make a single mention of the fact that it was a skill she had learned from Han Sen.</p>

<p>Many of the students had never before seen Under the Sky in action. They only noticed that’s what it was now, after Angia spoke.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi returned her Ice Knife to its scabbard and said darkly, “Under the Sky has always had a big flaw that rendered it unusable in combat. The Under the Sky I used was a variant that was modified by Han Sen. It corrects the problems of the original. I have not learned it well, and if I was to estimate, I am at around ten percent of Han Sen’s proficiency with it.”</p>

<p>After hearing that, all the students of Sky Palace were in shock. So many people had wished to modify Under the Sky, but no one had been able to solve the issues plaguing it. It was difficult to believe Han Sen had sorted it out.</p>

<p>Angia’s face, in the meantime, was turning green and white. Even a smart guy like him couldn’t think of anything else to</p>

<p>“Can I take the Blood Feather Knife now?” Yun Suyi said, looking right at Angia.</p>

<p>She was angry that Angia had mocked Han Sen, so she wasn’t going to be polite.</p>

<p>“Of course. Sister Yun’s knifeskill is strong, and so the knife is yours.” Angia forced a smile and passed the box to Yun Suyi.</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Yun Suyi put away the Blood Feather Knife and left the arena.</p>

<p>Yun Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane got up to meet her, and Yun Sushang asked, “Suyi, is what you said true? Under the Sky’s flaws have been fixed?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is true.” Yun Suyi nodded.</p>

<p>“Let’s go. We are going to have to see our father.” Yun Sushang pulled Yun Suyi away, and they left Cloud Island. The news that Under the Sky had been fixed was far too important. She couldn’t wait around for the event to end before going back.</p>

<p>And furthermore, Yun Suyi had received the Blood Feather Knife, so the event would soon be over anyway.</p>

<p>The other students started to leave, too. They also wished to know if Under the Sky had truly been fixed. If that was true, then Sky Palace had another exclusive knifeskill.</p>

<p>Angia and the other Feathers all looked depressed. No one wished to say a word.</p>

<p>They wanted to use Han Sen to get famous, but instead, Angia had been beaten by Han Sen’s student. They were all so upset. It was far worse than losing to Han Sen directly.</p>

<p>They wouldn’t gain any fame from this, and they couldn’t give the knife to the third elder as planned. And the biggest problem was that Yun Suyi had taken the knife without being the slightest bit impressed. This failure had certainly led to a loss of reputation.</p>

<p>Despite being unable to beat Yun Suyi, who had learned directly from Han Sen, Angia had provoked Han Sen multiple times. It’d sound fairly ridiculous.</p>

<p>He had completely lost, and it filled the Feathers with frustration. There was nothing they could to discharge their anger, either. All they could do was swallow it.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe Han Sen concocted a plan like that. I underestimated him. It looks like that man is not just a fighter,” Angia said through gritted teeth.</p>

<p>He thought Han Sen had planned to use Yun Suyi to fight him all along, but he was thinking too much, of course. Han Sen had never spared a thought about how he might deal with Angia.</p>

<p>It was still not over yet, though. Yun Sushang brought Yun Suyi to meet with Yun Changkong. They told him about Han Sen and Under the Sky.</p>

<p>“Really? Suyi, show me Han Sen’s modified version.” Yun Changkong did not believe Han Sen had what it took to fix the skill. He believed there had to be some sort of problem remaining.</p>

<p>After all, so many elites had tried and failed to fix it. Han Sen couldn’t just fix it within a month, even if he was a genius. But when Yun Changkong witnessed Yun Suyi’s performance, his mouth dropped wide open.</p>
