<h2>Black Crystal Stone</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3056</h3>

<p>In the symbols etched into the wall, Han Sen saw something with
which he was very familiar.</p>
<p>The carved symbol was in the shape of an egg. It looked like a
pigeon egg with a thousand stars floating inside it. It looked like
a small universe that existed within.</p>
<p>Although it was a simple line of a symbol, at this size, Han Sen
was far too familiar with it. Back in the sanctuaries, he had
killed a sacred-blood black armor bug and received the mysterious
black crystal stone. At this shape and size, what he saw carved
into the wall was precisely the same.</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen had absorbed the black crystal stone’s
shell. There was a black crystal armor inside the black crystal
stone. It was the black crystal armor that pulled Han Sen into that
world of kingdoms.</p>
<p>Now, on the wall, he saw a symbol of the black crystal stone. It
was extremely similar. He was super shocked.</p>
<p>“Is this a coincidence or a secret?” Han Sen’s mind flashed
through many different lines of thinking</p>
<p>The black crystal armor pulled him into the geno universe. Then,
he appeared in Ancient Big God Mountain. The location of that
drawing also just happened to be someplace in Ancient Big God
Mountain. It was hard to think that none of it was related.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly and carefully examined the details of the
carving. He discovered what was drawn there was like some human
performing a ritual.</p>
<p>The ritual did not have a god or a king or a sort of character
that required obeying. They were kneeling and obeying the black
crystal stone object.</p>
<p>“It looks like there is some kind of ritual going on in this
drawing, but it is weird,” Ghost Kill said. “As far as I know, the
seven kingdoms believe in the God Spirits. They just believe in
different God Spirits. I have never heard of a kingdom obeying an
egg before. That should be a gene egg.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t know, then I most certainly won’t,” Han Sen said.
Inside, he was actually thinking, “Is the black crystal body really
a gene egg? Is it a gene race inside the black crystal armor?”</p>
<p>After thinking about it, that did not seem right. If the black
crystal stone was really a gene egg, why would it run into the
first sanctuary in the Alliance? Plus, the gene race power was
different from the universal powers. If the black crystal stone
really was a gene egg, it should have been repelled by the geno
universe.</p>
<p>But it was different. The black crystal stone did not get
repelled, and it was used to reinforce creatures.</p>
<p>as U</p>
<p>The two of them kept on walking and observing the symbols across
the walls. It was like they were checking out one long drawing. All
of the drawings documented the entire process of a ritual.</p>
<p>Countless humans were praying before the black crystal stone. In
the end, humans were using their own blood to sacrifice themselves
on the black crystal stone.</p>
<p>Further ahead, the content of the carvings was even weirder. A
character who was like an officer of the ritual was holding the
black crystal stone. He threw the black crystal stone into a thing
that looked like the entrance to a volcano.</p>
<p>In the next drawing, at the entrance of the volcano, smoke was
rising. People were praying before the smoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Ghost Kill wanted to find out what happened next.
They hurried up and went forward. When they saw what happened next,
they were given a massive surprise.</p>
<p>The content near the end showed an outsider falling from the
sky. It entered the entrance of the volcano. In the next drawing,
that outsider was holding the black crystal stone as he escaped the
entrance of the volcano.</p>
<p>In the final picture, many angry humans were looking up at the
sky. Then, there were no more drawings. The carvings ended
there.</p>
<p>All of those depictions were very abstract. It was difficult to
tell what exactly was trying to be drawn. One was not really able
to figure out who was the one that stole the black crystal stone,
but Han Sen could not help but think of Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>But that was just Han Sen’s idle thoughts at work. There was no
proof that the one who stole the black crystal stone was Qin
Xiu.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of a story like this before?” Han Sen was not
very plugged-in to the history of this new universe. His knowledge
was lacking, so he looked at Ghost Kill hoping to learn something
useful from her. Ghost Kill was silent a moment before saying, “I
have never heard a story like this before. Perhaps the humans that
obey the gene egg are humans from a smaller kingdom. Back in
ancient times, there were many smaller kingdoms. It was not always
the case that there were seven like now. Perhaps the story on the
stone is just a folktale from some old country that no longer
exists.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He looked at the stone wall ahead. He did not
see any more carvings, but the stone cave ahead revealed stairs
that went down.</p>
<p>The stone staircase was a spiral one. It was unknown where it
might have led. They looked at each other and went down the stone
stairs together in a very co-operative fashion.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Ghost Kill were very interested in this place. They
wanted to know who had put so many things in that Ancient Big God
Mountain.</p>
<p>“From what I know, the lone sky dragon is a very rare god gene
race,” Ghost Kill said as she kept walking. “The legends of how
many times it has appeared can be counted on your fingers. The most
famous instance of a lone sky dragon was the one attributed to Mo
Li. If the purple-haired monkey really is a blood ghost spirit,
then the lone sky dragon from earlier could very well be the one Mo
Li used to own.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had no hesitation to ask what he was wondering about.
“But if Mo Li was killed in the Wei Kingdom’s palace, his gene
races should have died with him. How could they have appeared
here?”</p>
<p>“I do not know,” Ghost Kill said. “If they are not Mo Li’s, who
could have a lone sky dragon and blood ghost spirit at the same
time? How could that happen? It would be too much of a coincidence
if you ask me.”</p>
<p>“We cannot confirm if the purple-haired monkey is a blood ghost
spirit, so maybe it isn’t one,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“You are right.” Ghost Kill nodded and said nothing else.</p>
<p>The two of them went down the stone steps. They had walked down
at least a few hundred feet when the stone steps reached the end.
In front of them was a stone door.</p>
<p>While Ghost Kill was investigating it, she discovered there was
nothing weird about the stone door. She pushed it, but the stone
door did not budge.</p>
<p>“Allow me.” Han Sen used the metal pillar in his hand to strike
the stone door. He was very strong. After hitting it a few times,
the stone door shattered.</p>
<p>The two of them looked beyond the stone door. Beyond the ruin of
the door, there was an old hall. The walls had many different
styles that looked like the drawings from earlier.</p>
<p>A 9-foot-tall stove was situated in the center of the hall. A
green fire was burning under it. It lit up the entire palace.</p>
<p>The two of them entered the stone hall with great care. They
looked at the stone stove. A dead body was hanging upside down. It
was clad in armor. The bones were almost cracked. It looked as if
it had been dead for a long time.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed nothing special about the bones, so he looked at
the drawings above. After having a look, he was given a fright.</p>
<p>There was no text on the wall, just drawings. There was text
inside the drawings. Han Sen was able to understand it. On top, it
said “The Story of Genes.”</p>
