<p>“These are the systems of chaos, and anything can happen here.
Ready yourselves for death,” Mister White said when Han Sen
returned to the ship.</p>
<p>No one had expected to encounter the Galactic Shrimp just as
they were leaving that system, and the Ice Blue Knights had taken a
lot of casualties. The majority of them had made it through,
though. All in all, the battle had gone well.</p>
<p>The knights were also just happy that they had not woken up the
Black Hole Spider. If they had, their entire army would have surely
perished, not just the few they had lost to the shrimp.</p>
<p>The bodies of the dead knights couldn’t be retrieved, since no
one could return to the territory of the Galactic Shrimp and
recover the deceased. Even if they could have gone back, the
perished would have been eaten by the creatures by now.</p>
<p>They had lost much in that fight. They couldn’t bring back the
xenogeneic genes or the bodies of those they had slain; there
hadn’t been time to collect anything. And after leaving, they
couldn’t quite think about returning.</p>
<p>The ships had been extensively damaged. Fortunately, the ships
were designed to repel the assault of xenogeneics. The armor of the
hull was like the crust of the earth. Although the ships were badly
battered, their cores weren’t harmed. As a result, they could still
fly.</p>
<p>As he rested, Han Sen looked over the Galactic Shrimp and
Galactic Lobster beast souls he had retrieved.</p>
<p>Han Sen had earned many Galactic Shrimp beast souls, including
sixteen of Marquise rank and one that was Duke. That was far more
than he had expected. He had forgotten how many shrimp he had
actually killed over the course of the battle.</p>

<!--Galactic Shrimp beast soul: sword--></div>
<p>Han Sen summoned the Galactic Shrimp sword beast soul. Then, a
two-meter-long greatsword appeared in Han Sen’s hands. It wasn’t as
heavy as a normal greatsword, though.</p>
<p>The Galactic Shrimp greatsword was like the spike at the end of
a Galactic Shrimp. It was a transparent blue color, and it looked
like a saw, but with a sharp and pointy tip. It glowed blue. When
Han Sen swung the blade, it unleashed an explosion of blue
light.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave one of the Galactic Shrimp beast souls to each of
his companions. A Marquise class weapon wasn’t too shabby, after
all. As for the Duke one, he gave that to Ji Qing.</p>
<p>Ji Qing’s super god body was called Sword Soul. She was
reasonably skilled with a sword, and so Han Sen gave it to her for
Ji Yanran’s sake.</p>
<p>The most important thing he had managed to get, though, was the
Galactic Lobster beast soul. Han Sen turned his focus to that.</p>

<!--King class Galactic Lobster beast soul: armor--></div>
<p>“King class armor?” Han Sen gave a little whoop. He needed an
armor of such strength.</p>
<p>The Demon Bug King Bai Sema had a high level of defense, but Han
Sen couldn’t attack while the shield was up. A beast soul armor was
different. It was a basic item that everyone needed.</p>
<p>“It is a shame I only have one. If I had managed to kill a few
more, everyone would have this lobster armor. We’d be much safer in
the systems of chaos, that’s for sure,” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned the Galactic Lobster armor, and a translucent
blue crystal wrapped around him. Inside that blue crystal glowed a
shiny green light. Han Sen moved, and when he did, it looked like
the stars of an entire galaxy were moving with him.</p>
<p>“What a beautiful armor. Is that the Galactic Lobster’s beast
soul?” Ji Qing looked at Han Sen’s armor enviously.</p>
<p>That armor really was beautiful. It shone like a blue diamond,
and so it would definitely attract the gaze of any woman who walked
by.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t a fan of wearing something so flamboyant,
however. If he could choose its look, he would have preferred
something dull and grey. He did like to keep a low-profile, after
all.</p>
<p>Wearing armor like that made Han Sen look like a firefly in the
dark. It was so very shiny, and all kinds of enemies would be
attracted to him.</p>
<p>Even so, it was better than nothing. Han Sen then gave Han Yan
his gold Demon Bug King beast soul. Han Yan could now explore
alone, without needing to keep Little Angel next to her.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a set of lobster armor now, so the Demon Bug Bai
Sema wasn’t as important to him anymore. If he did require it, he
could just find Little Angel and the others.</p>
<p>After seeing the Galactic Shrimp in action, Han Sen had a much
better understanding of the breadth and danger of the systems of
chaos a whole lot more. Even with his three Demon Bug King Bai
Semas, his safety wasn’t certain.</p>
<p>“Now I understand how a woman like Yisha died out here.”
Thinking of Yisha, Han Sen had to end his thought with an audible
sigh.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King had someone deliver some Galactic Shrimp
xenogeneic genes and meat as a reward for Han Sen’s participation
and performance.</p>
<p>The person who delivered the items was that same fiery Ice Blue
Knight from before.</p>
<p>“Brother, my name is Exploding Bear. I am known for my
appearance as a raging bear. I will look after you from now on. If
you need anything from the Ice Blue Knights, all you must do is
call my name.” Exploding Bear pounded his chest before Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes, I will be sure to do that, and I will make hearty use of
your name,” Han Sen said with a smile. It was relieving to have an
ally in the Ice Blue Knights.</p>
<p>“Cool. If you have time, come and visit me on the sixth team.”
Exploding Bear laughed, and then patted Han Sen on the shoulder. He
left with the other knights that had carried in Han Sen’s
reward.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the Galactic Shrimp’s meat for a shrimp hotpot. He
sliced up the translucent shrimp meat and dipped it in some sauce.
When he put one in his mouth, the sweetness of the juices was
exquisite. He felt as if he was going to melt with the shrimp
itself.</p>
<p>The journey that followed wasn’t as dangerous or as eventful as
Han Sen thought it might be. They traveled for a whole week, and
they didn’t have to fight off a single xenogeneic in that time.</p>
<p>There were groups of xenogeneics that saw the ships, but they
all fled without causing trouble.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do, and at one point, Han Sen joined
Exploding Bear for a drink. Exploding Bear was captain of the sixth
team. His subordinate knights were nice to Han Sen, even though he
was just a Marquise.</p>
<p>The kindness was largely earned by Han Sen’s performance on the
day before. Powerful elites would receive a lot of respect
regardless of their rank or race.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Brother. The systems of chaos are not as scary as
you might fear. We have traveled this route many times, and it has
always remained clear. The Black Hole Spider and the Galactic
Shrimp were wild flukes. Big Bro Bear knows this way well, and I
can tell you, nothing will happen. Relax and enjoy the drink.”
Exploding Bear then proceeded to drain three entire kegs. He
gripped Han Sen’s shoulder and nudged another keg toward him.</p>
<p>“Brother Bear, it is not that I don’t want to drink, it’s that I
cannot drink. My belly is too small.” Han Sen looked at his bloated
belly.</p>
<p>Exploding Bear loved to eat, and while Han Sen cast Consume to
try to keep up, he still couldn’t eat much. He couldn’t fathom how
big the bear’s belly must have been.</p>
<p>Exploding Bear laughed and started to say something when an
alarm sounded and cut him off. Everyone froze.</p>
<p>“Battle alarm!” Exploding Bear shouted, with his eyes wide
open.</p>
<p>“It looks like Exploding Bear’s words are unreliable.” Han Sen
got up and went to the control room. He knew Mister White would
bring his companions there.</p>
