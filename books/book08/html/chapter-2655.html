<h2>Deified Star Beetle</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2655</h3>

<p>“This is exactly what I wanted, but this isn’t the right time. I
can’t use beast souls to fight. I would have to use my own power to
fight it, but I’m afraid that wouldn’t be enough to defeat a
deified star beetle.” Han Sen was troubled by this most recent
development.</p>
<p>Star beetles were very good at physical-reinforcement. Even a
primitive deified beetle would have a shell that was considerably
harder than most primitive deifieds. Even if Han Sen could make use
of his peacock soul robe or his Six Core Snake Bow, punching
through that shell would be no small feat. Plus, there was the
added fact that he couldn’t make use of those tools right now.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about tackling a deified star beetle. You are
better off sticking with the King class star beetles to get your
star fruit.” Han Sen continued looking around for star beetles to
slay.</p>
<p>He didn’t know where the star beetles had flown in from, but
there were indeed many of them. Han Sen had been worried that the
tree might not have one thousand star beetles for him to kill, but
now it looked like there were at least ten thousand star beetles
descending on the tree.</p>
<p>When the star beetle swarm reached the tree, they spread out and
landed on its leaves, branches, and fruit. Their sharp teeth began
to gnaw on the star tree. And while the star tree was very hard,
their teeth were sharp and hard enough to leave marks in the bark.
It didn’t seem like a big deal now, but if they kept chewing the
tree like that every day, it would only be a matter of time before
the tree fell.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued killing all that he could. He slew many star
beetles, and in three or four hours, he had brought down five
hundred of them. He had also earned three beast souls.</p>
<p>“It looks like I should be able to kill two thousand star
beetles before the timer is up. That means I will be able to grab
twenty star fruits. But the star fruits are so big, how will I even
cart them off?” As Han Sen pondered this conundrum, he felt
something cold approaching his back. He immediately teleported
away.</p>
<p>After he teleported off, the deified star beetle reached his old
position. It landed on a branch, and its small blue eyes peered at
the newly re-positioned Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Why did this guy come here?” Han Sen had deliberately
avoided the deified star beetle as he moved on down the tree. He
hadn’t expected the powerful beetle to come after him and attempt a
sneak attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have much time to think about it. The deified
star beetle was attacking him again. Its blue body became lightning
that zapped its way forward to reach Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t fast enough to dodge the beetle’s charge with
speed alone. He teleported away again. He put some distance between
himself and the deified star beetle. He didn’t stop there, either.
He teleported again to get even farther away from his attacker.</p>
<p>But the deified star beetle wasn’t keen on letting Han Sen off
the hook. It continued to use its blue light to try to attack him,
and Han Sen’s teleportation skills weren’t taking him far enough
away. He couldn’t shake off the star beetle. Every time Han Sen
appeared out of a fresh teleportation, the star beetle was coming
for him like a beam of blue light. Han Sen had no choice but to
continue teleporting. He no longer had enough time to continue
killing star beetles, as his focus rested on dealing with his new
deified foe.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t help but frown. Because he was being pursued by
the deified star beetle, he was missing out on any chance to kill
the average star beetles. If he didn’t kill one thousand beetles,
he wasn’t sure if the old man would allow him to collect star
fruit.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why won’t this deified star beetle let me go?” Han Sen
frowned. This creature seemed very driven to attack him.</p>
<p>“This is so strange. Why does this deified star beetle keep
chasing Han Sen?” Exquisite was confused, too. Star beetles weren’t
very intelligent, and even finding the star tree was a matter of
instinct for the creatures. If their intelligence had been higher,
they would have fled the moment they saw the old man sitting
beneath the tree.</p>
<p>Liyu Zhen laughed to himself. The moment the star beetles
descended, he and Han Sen both saw them. After seeing the deified
beetle, an idea hatched in his mind.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the power to control the star beetle, but he
didn’t need to control the deified; he just needed to give the
creature a target. Han Sen was hunting the star beetles, and wisps
of the dead beetles’ presence would be clinging to his body. Liyu
Zhen merely used a secret trick to enable the deified star beetle
to smell the presence of the exterminating Han Sen. It drew the
deified fiend to Han Sen exclusively.</p>
<p>“This deified star beetle’s appearance has saved me a lot of
trouble. I do still need to teach him that lesson, after all. I
didn’t even have to do this myself.” Liyu Zhen stopped focusing on
Han Sen, and he returned his focus to killing King class star
beetles.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen was able to escape the attacks of the deified
star beetle, he wouldn’t have the time to kill the King class star
beetles anymore. He wouldn’t achieve one thousand star beetle
kills, which would keep him from earning any star fruits.</p>
<p>The old man squinted, but his face didn’t change. Liyu Zhen’s
trick had been done in secret, but it hadn’t managed to escape his
attention. Still, the old man didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>He cared very little about a grudge between two boys. He only
needed someone who could effectively protect the star tree.</p>
<p>For now, Liyu Zhen’s performance hadn’t been bad. His abilities
were higher than others of the same class. He could scrape by and
be labeled guardian of the star tree.</p>
<p>The trick he used on Han Sen had been unfair, but it was also
another way of proving his power.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew things couldn’t keep going on this way. He didn’t
have the time to kill other star beetles, so if this continued, he
would fail the test.</p>
<p>“It looks like I can’t get rid of it. In that case, I will just
ignore it.” Han Sen’s brain was spinning quickly.</p>
<p>Exquisite was worried about Han Sen, but what he did next
shocked Exquisite even more.</p>
<p>Still being chased by the deified star beetle, Han Sen evaded
the next attack, then headed toward a King class star beetle.</p>
<p>From the perspective of others, it might have looked like a
coincidence. It would appear that when Han Sen dodged, he had just
happened to encounter a King class star beetle and randomly kill it
before teleporting away from the deified star beetle’s next attack.
It all played out so smoothly. It was like one grand move that
happened to look like a coincidence.</p>
<p>But Exquisite could clearly feel what Han Sen was thinking. This
wasn’t a coincidence. Han Sen was planning every move he made.</p>
<p>In this high-speed chase, Han Sen still had the power to plan
all that. Exquisite knew his methods, but if she was in his shoes,
she didn’t think she could have pulled it off.</p>
<p>The old man, as he watched Han Sen’s latest performance, looked
stunned.</p>
<p>Under the continued pursuit of the deified star beetle, Han Sen
took down another King class star beetle. It was the same as
before, and just as precise. The deified star beetle’s attacks
didn’t seem to be hampering him significantly. And he maintained
the surgical precision of his attacks. The King class star beetles
never had the chance to fight back, either, so they couldn’t deal
damage to the star tree.</p>
<p>“He is so young, and yet he is still so calm. He hasn’t freaked
out, and he has continued to do everything he has planned to the
best of his abilities. This crystallizer really is a genius. You
picked a tremendous silkworm,” the old man suddenly said to
Exquisite.</p>
