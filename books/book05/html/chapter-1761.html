<h3>Chapter 1761</h3>

<p>Han Sen had managed to put away some savings, and so he decided
to buy a house for himself in the south.</p>
<p>It was in a slum, and there were many hobos and creatures living
there. This was what Han Sen needed. A place where it wasn’t
strange to have other creatures appear.</p>
<p>Golden Growler was kept in a warehouse-like room as he generated
his geno armor. His body was full of some gold, mystic substance.
It was becoming a gold set of armor that covered his entire body.
Even his nails were wrapped up by this armor, leaving nothing
exposed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the geno armor that had generated successfully
for Golden Growler, and wondered how the creature would even
walk.</p>
<p>This was the beginning. Han Sen had lived on Planet Kate for a
while now, and he was weH-versed in the differences between a Noble
and a non-Noble. Although there was just one evolution separating
the two, the differences were staggering.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Golden Growler chuffed quietly. The geno armor on his body
started to melt and twist, delighting Han Sen.</p>
<p>The geno armor melted and became liquid, but that meant Golden
Growler was turning into a xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt nervous now. Xenogeneics were strong, and their
bodies were strong, but there were side effects to note. If Golden
Growler could not hold back the urge to kill, it would become a
killing machine. That would be worse than not evolving at all.</p>
<p>His golden geno armor became liquid, and it melted into Golden
Growler’s skin, fur, bones, and nails. It shocked Han Sen.</p>
<p>The xenogeneics he had seen only evolved in one part of their
body. Even for Han Sen, it had only been his blood. But the
entirety of Golden Growler was changing, not just one aspect of
him. Han Sen did not know if this was normal because he didn’t know
much about the evolving process of xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Golden Growler seemed to suffer some sort of pain, as his claws
gripped the ground, churning up the soil.</p>
<p>His golden hair became metallic. His nails were turning into
metal, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t see what was inside Golden Growler, though, so
he couldn’t tell what might have been going on below the surface.
Perhaps his organs were also becoming metal?</p>
<p>Han Sen knew how painful it was to become a xenogeneic, though.
Golden Growler would have to suffer through all this on his
own.</p>
<p>Much time passed, and Golden Growler became more and more
golden. He eventually looked like a golden statue. It made Han Sen
wonder what would happen when he finished evolving. Could he live
like an ordinary animal could? Or would he just become a metallic
thing that could not even budge?</p>
<p>Golden Growler raised his head in a silent roar. His body was
shining gold. There was a golden light coming from him, like an
ancient beast. It was roaring in the sky along with him.</p>
<p>The gold light only appeared for a moment, though, and it soon
faded. If Han Sen did not have good eyes, he would have thought
they were playing tricks on him.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had watched another creature
become a xenogeneic. He didn’t know if any of this was normal, and
he didn’t know if this was what he looked like when he was
evolving.</p>
<p>After the silent roar, Golden Growler’s body was normal again.
Although he still had a golden glow, the flesh was meaty again.
Still, it was a little different.</p>
<p>While Golden Growler’s evolution finished up, a few systems
away, there was a beast in space. Its eyes were wide open, staring
at Planet Kate.</p>
<p>After a while, it spoke to itself. “Is this possible? Are there
any more Roars living in this galaxy? The blood is quite pure. Is
that really a Roar?”</p>
<p>After asking himself this repeatedly, the galactic beast looked
very sure of his thoughts, and he seemed very happy.</p>
<p>The beast’s body was in space, and the storm in the galaxy did
nothing to it. It swung its tail, and its body flashed forward. It
was headed for Kate.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the xenogeneic Golden Growler no longer moving, and
he thought something might have happened. But Golden Growler
suddenly jumped and surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Golden Growler’s eyes were glowing gold, and there
wasn’t a single glint of murder in them. It made Han Sen feel a lot
safer.</p>
<p>Golden Growler jumped on Han Sen and licked his face. He looked
so happy, he swung his tail.</p>
<p>Han Sen patted Golden Growler on the head, looking delighted. He
was thinking of bringing Little Angel and the others over, too, so
he wouldn’t be so lonely. If they could all evolve twice, he and
his posse would be extremely powerful. It would be very helpful for
Han Sen in the geno universe.</p>
<p>He brought Golden Growler back with him to Wizard. Although his
presence would be difficult to explain, Han Sen would prefer to
have Golden Growler near him.</p>
<p>Golden Growler was down near Han Sen’s feet, checking out Planet
Kate’s streets. Compared to the Alliance, this planet was… for lack
of a better word: vintage. But it wasn’t barren, in any way. Many
different civilizations and technological advancements were all
meshed together.</p>
<p>As they walked, though, Han Sen’s face changed. He looked around
but did not see anything. Still, something made him feel very
worried and very nervous. His heart that had stopped
beating—because of the solid blood—suddenly started to move
again.</p>
<p>He was disturbed. Very disturbed.</p>
<p>It had been so long since Han Sen last felt like this, and his
face turned red as he looked around. And he was thinking to
himself, “Have the Feathers noticed I killed Xina? Have the
higher-class Feathers come to exact revenge?”</p>
<p>Before he could think, Han Sen used all his power to take Golden
Growler with him back to the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not sense where the danger was coming from, but he
knew he couldn’t fight back. So, he chose to run.</p>
<p>But it was too late. There was a roar on the street, blasting
shockwaves. It destroyed the entire block. After that, Han Sen felt
as if he had been robbed of all power. He could no longer even
stand. He was all soft, lying on the ground.</p>
<p>A green beast appeared on the street Its head was like a lion’s,
but with the body of a rabbit. It had green fur, with the ears of
an elf.</p>
<p>The beast approached, and as it came, the dimensions distorted
around it. It did not care for Han Sen, and its eyes were locked on
Golden Growler. And it looked excited.</p>
