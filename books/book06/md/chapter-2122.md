  Han Littleflower and the white tiger were engaged in a lengthy battle, and it was incredibly difficult to determine who the victor would be. But after a while, Han Littleflower suddenly stopped moving. His legs became very still, and he placed his hands against each other.

“Hm, a great opportunity has opened!” the white tiger shouted, as it flashed behind Han Littleflower’s back. Its claws were raised and ready to fall upon the boy’s head, looking like sharp white talons. They were as frightening as any weapon.

Han Littleflower did not move, aside from crossing his arms. But as he did so, the environment around them started to twist and distort.

The white tiger’s attack had almost reached Littleflower, but as it approached, its speed was suddenly slowed. Everything about the scene now seemed to be playing out in slow motion.

When Han Littleflower turned around, though, he seemed completely unaffected by the slowing effect. He threw a lightning-fast punch into the white tiger’s belly. The slowed white tiger was unable to react, and he most certainly couldn’t teleport away in time. All he could do was watch as his opponent’s fist came driving into his stomach.

Pang!

The white tiger’s face was brutally disfigured as the force caused his eyes to burst from their sockets. He immediately heaved up a bucket of blood, and his entire form started to fly backwards.

All this occurred in slow motion, of course. Every spectator was able to finely inspect the tiger’s every distraught emotion. It was weird and almost creepy.

Littleflower moved to catch up with the still-slow white tiger. He threw more punches without hesitation. They came thick and fast, morphing the white tiger’s face into pitiable mush. The changes still occurred in slow motion, however, and while it was creepy, it was also mildly humorous to see.

“Sacred power… He… He has a holy body… How… Sacred has a real heir…” The old man with the head of a dog stared in disbelief. His shock was so great that he almost dropped his staff.

Powerful elites all across the universe found themselves trembling in their boots. They shivered in pangs of fear at what they had just witnessed.

“Sacred… really Sacred… How… A holy body cannot be passed on… Why… Why…”

One particularly frightened elite found himself screaming aloud. Although Littleflower’s power was nothing to them right now, it was all about the long-term development of those powers. It was the future prospect that had them quivering in fear.

“Ha! Ha! Sacred has an heir! Someone can actually make use of Sacred’s powers? Wow, this is so very interesting. Those old guys better go put their diapers on, because they must be peeing themselves right now. Sacred being here, though; I wonder if that means they are finally able to pay their debt?” At the end of the world, a man watched Littleflower fighting and laughed. He laughed so hard, he almost found himself crying.

Pang!

The white tiger was lying on the ground now, his face swollen beyond recognition.

“Stop… Stop it… I concede…” the white tiger exclaimed. He wished to rip up the paper of his registration, but unfortunately, he was way too slow to do it in time. It was likely he was going to die before he had the chance to tear it up.

Han Littleflower, hearing the white tiger’s plea, halted his fist in midair. He relented, and simply looked upon the white tiger.

The dimension around the white tiger untwisted. The flow of time returned to normal for the white tiger, and the physics of Littleflower’s last blow took over, carrying the tiger back with the speed of an arrow.

Boom!

The tiger’s body punched a hole into a big mountain behind it. The white tiger came crawling out of the pit. It had the audacity to look at Littleflower and growl at him. “Do not even think about being so cocky! I’m only ten years old. When I grow up, I’ll bang your mom so hard, she won’t even recognize you.”

“Ten? Wow! You’re so much older than me. Did you know that I am only six years old?” Han Littleflower blinked at the creature.

Patong!

The white tiger almost hit the ground after hearing that.

Everyone else heard it, too, and onlookers across the universe stared with open mouths. If what he had just said was true, then that was terrifying. It was wild enough that he had become a Viscount at the age of six, but to then go on and defeat all the powerful and more renown Viscounts occupying the same league as him was something incredibly grave.

The old elites, hearing what he had to say for himself, almost wet themselves.

Inside the land of the Pirates, Hai’er visited a strange castle. She knocked at its stone gate and said, “Sister Kun, are you here?”

“Miss Hai’er, why have you come here? I thought you hated this place, and complained that it was too dirty and too ugly for your liking.” The stone gate opened, and when it did, a woman came walking out.

That woman looked fairly strange. She looked like a human wearing armor at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it was obvious that the garb wasn’t actually clothing. It was a part of her.

Of her face, only her jaw and mouth were human-like. The rest of her face and body were shelled in a carapace. And very much like an insect, her eyes were insectoid, too.

Behind her, a set of insect wings spread and vibrated strangely.

Hai’er lifted her lips and said, “I have a problem, of course. Why else would I ever want to visit this dump?”

“Okay, so what do you need me for, Miss?” Sister Kun asked with a warm smile.

Your next opponent is Dollar, isn’t it?” Hai’er said with a squint in her eyes.

Yes, that is correct.” Sister Kun also nodded in confirmation.

“Good. You have to beat him, no matter what. Do you think you stand a chance of killing him?” Bai’er asked roughly.

Sister Kun smiled. “That Dollar is strong. Dollar is strong. Even Dragon Eight lost to him. You know that, don’t you? But even so, well… I suppose his power is nothing compared to mine. My power will beat him easily.”

Sister Kun then changed her tone of voice and asked, “But why do you want me to kill him so badly?”

“That is none of your business. Just get this done and I’ll see that you are handsomely rewarded,” Hai’er said.

“As you command, my lady. This so-called Dollar is a dead man.” Sister Kun looked confident.

“Good.” Hai’er nodded, as her teeth itched in remembrance of what Dollar had done to her.

When Han Sen looked at his next opponent, he thought it was strange. His opponent’s name was simply listed as “Kun.” The list also said she was of the Pirate, and that was one thing Han Sen was familiar with.

“Not many Pirates joined the geno ranked fights. I wonder what Kun’s power is like, though.” Han Sen went on the internet to learn more about her, but he couldn’t find much of anything that was helpful.

Aside from a few famous Pirates, little was known about most of their members. And this lack of fame applied to Kun, too.

“It is a shame that Hai’er did not think to join. If she did, I could surely benefit from her involvement. She sure likes to dish out treasures.” Seeing the name Pirate, Han Sen thought back to Hai’er and the treasures she frequently possessed.

“Hachoo!” Hai’er was going home, but all of a sudden, she sneezed.

“Ugh, why am I getting ill? Have I been staying up too late recently?” Hai’er said, while rubbing her nose.
