<h2>Identity Exposed</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2346</h3>

<p>Han Sen didn’t believe what Miss Mirror told him. He had
inspected that ring many times, and he had never seen any semblance
of a soul inside it.</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard what she said, he raised his hand. He tilted
the ring’s green, eye-shaped gem toward his own face. He examined
the gem’s reflective surface carefully, and said, “I do see my own
reflection, but any gem would show me that.”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror laughed. She lifted her left hand.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror’s hand was white, and her fingers were long and
thin. There was a ring on her ring finger.</p>
<p>Seeing that ring, Han Sen’s heart leaped. That ring looked
exactly the same as his, aside from the fact that it was a little
bit smaller.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror lightly touched the green gem with her finger, and
the eye-like stone started to glow.</p>
<p>The ring on Han Sen’s finger trembled slightly. They both lit up
in the same way.</p>
<p>At that moment, Han Sen felt the gem on the ring come alive. It
was like a real eye looking at him.</p>
<p>In that eye, he could see his own reflection. But the gem wasn’t
reflecting Han Sen as he was now; instead, it showed Han Sen as a
naked baby.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a pang of panic roll through him. He hadn’t
expected the ring to reveal anything incriminating, and it was too
late for him to take it off.</p>
<p>“Auntie Princess, what is that geno art you used? It is quite
interesting. But stop joking around with me,” Han Sen said. He kept
his composure strong and unwavering.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror lowered her left hand, and the light of the rings
went dim. She looked like she was smiling, but she wasn’t. “You
have a silver tongue, but it won’t do you any good. If I hand you
over to the king, how long do you think it will take for you to
die? It might take tens of thousands of years. I’m afraid death
wouldn’t be granted to you for a long, long time.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had a wry smile on his face. He had planned to talk Miss
Mirror into believing that he was truly Bai Yi, so he could buy
himself some time to formulate a plan for escaping the Extreme
King.</p>
<p>But this was the first time they had met, and already, his
identity had been exposed. All his plans of escape had now been
reduced to nothing more than a ridiculous joke.</p>
<p>“If you have something you want to say, then get on with it and
spit it out.” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to tell you. You will be sentenced to death. I
will take you to the palace and let the king decide,” Miss Mirror
said flatly.</p>
<p>“If that was what you really intended, then there was no point
in confronting me here,” Han Sen said, as he looked at Miss
Mirror.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror didn’t respond. She just looked at Han Sen with
interest as the car traveled onward.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly realized that the car wasn’t headed for the
palace. They went to the biggest starport that could be found in
King’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Han Sen asked, following Miss Mirror out
of the car and onto a battleship. The battleship soon took off,
heading out of King’s Kingdom. He was shocked.</p>
<p>Instead of answering his question, Miss Mirror sent for someone
to take him to another room.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what Miss Mirror intended to do. She was Bai
Wei’s aunt and a trusted adviser of King Bai. If she noticed Han
Sen was a fake, she should have grabbed him by the collar and
marched him before King Bai.</p>
<p>Instead, they were leaving King’s Kingdom. She hadn’t decided to
incarcerate him, either. She just had him and the blood kirin taken
to an ordinary room. The blood kirin wasn’t locked up, either.</p>
<p>“What does this Miss Mirror want?” Han Sen wondered, but try as
he might, he couldn’t guess what the woman was planning.</p>
<p>Han Sen touched the Mirror Spirit Eye. He wanted to take it off,
but ever since the ring had been activated by Miss Mirror, it was
as if the piece of jewelry had melded into his hand. He was now
unable to remove it.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this ring?” Han Sen wondered, frustrated by
the fact that he couldn’t activate the Mirror Spirit Eye ring.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to take whatever opportunities come my way. It looks
as if I’m not talented enough to be a spy. I was exposed very
easily,” Han Sen thought to himself. “But if Miss Mirror hasn’t
brought me to King Bai, and I’m no longer in the confines of King’s
Kingdom, there is a chance that I can escape. The only bad thing is
that Bao’er is still in Lan Haixin’s place. How am I supposed to
get her out of there?”</p>
<p>The ship made a series of hyperspeed jumps that took them
through multiple systems after they left King’s Kingdom. Han Sen
had no idea where Miss Mirror was taking him.</p>
<p>When the battleship finally came to a stop, Han Sen realized he
was now in a system he had never seen before. The planet was very
cold, and it was still in a very primitive stage of development.
There were no creatures of high intelligence about, and there were
no xenogeneics. There were only low level creatures around.</p>
<p>But for such a primitive planet, it was surrounded by a
surprising number of battleships and airships from a variety of
different races. Han Sen followed Miss Mirror down onto the surface
of the planet, and he saw many races that were familiar to him.
There was the Dragon, Demon, Buddha, Destroyed, and all sorts of
others were represented.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed something rather odd, though. Everyone who had
been sent to the planet’s surface, no matter which race they were
from, possessed water powers.</p>
<p>Even if they didn’t come from a water-aligned species, they were
at least proficient in water-based techniques. They were all King
class, too. It was rare to find a Duke in their ranks.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Han Sen couldn’t help but ask Miss
Mirror.</p>
<p>“This is a nameless system of no notability,” she replied.</p>
<p>“What are we doing here?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“We are attending a funeral,” Miss Mirror answered simply.</p>
<p>“A funeral? Whose funeral?” Han Sen was confused. Instead of
handing Han Sen over to King Bai, Miss Mirror had dragged him all
this way to attend a funeral. This was weird.</p>
<p>“Time is almost up. Let’s find a seat.” Miss Mirror looked
around and walked to a peak.</p>
<p>If Miss Mirror didn’t want to answer Han Sen, then he had no
choice but to follow along behind her.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t plan on running. First, he might not have to
flee, and even if he could, this was not the time. Bao’er was still
in the Extreme King, so there was no use in him running off all
alone.</p>
<p>Plus, a woman like Miss Mirror would probably have contingencies
in place for any escapes Han Sen might attempt.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Miss Mirror reached the top of the peak, and a guard
brought her a chair and an umbrella. It was as if she was on
vacation.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t receive the same lovely treatment. He just stood
next to the blood kirin, trying to see what Miss Mirror was
inspecting. The only thing in front of them was a large sea. It was
very quiet, and no creatures were visible within its depths. There
was nothing special to see.</p>
