<p>“Say, brother<sub>friend</sub>! Are you from a higher race?” Lao Zhuoma was going to call Han Sen “brother,” but it wasn’t appropriate. So, he called him “friend.”</p>

<p>Lao Zhuoma thought Han Sen was from a higher race, because normal Barons should never reach that sort of level. It didn’t matter how much they practiced, they just couldn’t.</p>

<p>“On the form, didn’t I tell you I was human?” Han Sen acted like he didn’t understand what he was being asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, you did.” Lao Zhuoma felt disheartened, as he had never heard of a human before. And he knew there was no higher race called that.</p>

<p>Lao Zhuoma still felt depressed, and without saying much, he told Han Sen, “Dollar, you will have to wait a few days on this airship. But going to Seven Mirrors won’t take long, once we depart.”</p>

<p>“That’s okay. I greatly enjoy traveling,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Lao Zhuoma gave Han Sen a room to live in, but without anything to do, Han Sen found himself going up on deck. Many refugees wished to board the airship and go to Seven Mirrors. Going to an underdeveloped planet was better than remaining in a warzone, or so they felt.</p>

<p>But Seven Mirrors wasn’t willing to take just anybody. The Nobles were always favored, which made it difficult for commoners to be accepted.</p>

<p>Seven Mirrors was not a charity, and they were only going to take those who could prove themselves useful. The old, sick, or injured weren’t allowed on board.</p>

<p>“What race do you belong to? You don’t look like you’re from Planet Kate,” a Baron Kate asked. He had come forward to check Han Sen out</p>

<p>“Human,” Han Sen answered.</p>

<p>“I have never heard of them, so I can only assume they are even smaller than the Kate.” The Baron wasn’t insulting Han Sen; he was mocking himself, more than anything.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at him and asked, “What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“I am Mike.” The Baron introduced himself, and then said, “So, we’ve been recruited by Seven Mirrors and we’re headed to an underdeveloped planet for work? If you want, why don’t we go to the same place and partner up?”</p>

<p>“I still haven’t decided if I want to go yet.” Han Sen did not reply.</p>

<p>Mike shook his head. “When the fighting starts, it’s not only the common folk that will be in grave danger. The Barons will be, too. Land reclamation is hard, but it is still better than war. So, why the hesitation?”</p>

<p>“We’ll see.” Han Sen didn’t much care for what he was being told.</p>

<p>Han Sen had spoken to Qiao, and he was able to confirm that war had not yet reached Gran City. Qiao and Lan Se were thinking of ways they could escape and where they could go, but they had so far been unable to reach a decision.</p>

<p>Han Sen told them about Seven Mirrors recruiting, and they told him they might consider it. They’d talk about it in greater depth once they were all together again.</p>

<p>The Third Master had evacuated from Planet Kate with Mister Tiger, and they extended an invite for Han Sen to join them at another headquarters of the Black Gold Group. It was an offer Han Sen quickly rejected, though.</p>

<p>Mike wished to say something more to Han Sen, but something occurred down below.</p>

<p>They both looked down and saw a legion of centaurs in front of the airship. They surrounded the people who were waiting for a chance to conduct the test in the hopes of boarding the airship.</p>

<p>Lao Zhuoma quickly went down to meet the centaurs, though. He smiled and said, “Taurus, please do not misunderstand. We are from Seven Mirrors, and we are friends, not enemies.”</p>

<p>After that, Lao Zhuoma pointed at the Seven Mirrors emblem on the ship.</p>

<p>The leading centaur recognized it; in fact, it was the reason that the centaurs had taken action.</p>

<p>The centaur, seeing the Seven Mirrors symbol, looked at Lao Zhuoma and coldly said, “We don’t care about Seven Mirrors. Kill all these Kate.”</p>

<p>The centaur warriors lifted their spears to kill the Kate that had been lining up. Lao Zhuoma looked horrified at the wrath of the centaurs. He had joined Seven Mirrors, yes, but he was Kate. It hurt to see his own people get slaughtered.</p>

<p>“Can you show mercy? Seven Mirrors will be accepting these Kate. We were going to take them to help develop an empty planet. Please?” Lao Zhuoma gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>Although many people would fail the test, Lao Zhuoma was a Kate himself. He couldn’t just watch them die.</p>

<p>Mike looked just as angry, too. He said. “The low lives of Taurus happily licked the boots of the Feathers when they were in control, but now that they have fallen, these scumbags have aligned themselves with the enemies of the Feathers. This is f*cking horrible!”</p>

<p>“Which race did they sign up with?” Han Sen asked curiously.</p>

<p>“I think they are called Demons. They looked similar to the Kate, but they have horns on their heads,” Mike said.</p>

<p>Han Sen wished to say something, but the leader of the centaurs shouted, “What a load of crap! Only the people currently onboard the ship count as Seven Mirrors. Just kill the rest of them.”</p>

<p>After that, he commanded his warriors to attack the people.</p>

<p>“Stop!” Lao Zhuoma shouted.</p>

<p>The leader centaur coldly laughed and said, “What? Would you like to fight us, as a representative of Seven Mirrors?”</p>

<p>“No. We are merely recruiting. Please be nice and let us take these people. Seven Mirrors has bought their services,” Lao Zhuoma said politely.</p>

<p>Seven Mirrors was not weak, but they weren’t the sorts to engage in conflict. This time, when they came to Planet Kate, the supervisor had informed them not to come into contact with any Demons.</p>

<p>“Okay. Let’s make this simple; from now on, if they are on the airship they are yours. If they cannot get on board, then I am sorry.” After the centaur leader said that, he gestured with his hands for his soldiers to rush forward.</p>

<p>Lao Zhuoma didn’t fight He just shouted at the people, saying, “Get on the ship! Hurry!”</p>

<p>“Animal!” Mike shouted down from atop the ship.</p>

<p>“Why are they killing them? Don’t they need people to develop Planet Kate, too?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>

<p>Mike coldly said, “Taurus is a race that takes pleasure in killing. They have a grudge with the Kate, due to the Kate beating them once before. Now they’ve got a clear chance, they aren’t so willing to let us leave.”</p>

<p>There was some crying heard from the crowds, as people tried to rush forward and get aboard the barge. The entryway was narrow, though, and if many more people boarded, it would overload the airship.</p>

<p>The centaur warriors thundered into the crowds, butchering merrily. The Kate were all just commoners, and so they had no chance of killing the centaur warriors. They were not trained for anything of the sort.</p>

<p>In moments, a dozen of the Kate had been killed.</p>

<p>Lao Zhuoma called for everyone to hurry, but there was not enough room for everyone to get on.</p>
