<h2>Purgatory Heaven</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1876</h3>

<p>“Everyone should know that the pharmaceutical talents of the
Gana are connected with their power. The purer their blood, the
greater their medicine becomes. This Holy Lady is not of the royal
family, but her blood is as pure as it gets. She is undoubtedly the
best out of all the Gana. Her starting price is…” The Kao kept on
speaking.</p>
<p>The people around all started shouting out their bids, which
annoyed the auctioneers. The clamor shocked Han Sen quite a
bit.</p>
<p>There were only a few dozen Gana still waiting to be sold, which
put pressure on the bidders who still hadn’t secured a Gana. And
this was the Holy Lady, so she was a hot item.</p>
<p>Gold Jade King had not been actively bidding in the previous
auctions. He had seemed to be waiting for a Gana of pure blood.</p>
<p>Han Sen, seeing the lady on stage, looked awfully worried.</p>
<p>The lady was chained up, and her snake tail was stiffened so she
would stand and not fall over. She looked completely emotionless.
Her eyes were closed, revealing her long eyelashes.</p>
<p>Her pretty lips trembled. It looked as if she was a nun who was
in the midst of dire prayers. The noise around her could not cause
her expression to falter.</p>
<p>“Something is wrong.” Han Sen looked around again. The Gana that
had been bought were all doing the same. They had closed their
eyes, and they were in the midst of prayer.</p>
<p>No matter how Han Sen looked at them, they seemed to be praying.
Even the way they moved their mouths suggested this. Their voices
were quiet, and Han Sen could barely hear them. They were not using
the common language, however, so Han Sen was unsure what they were
saying.</p>
<p>“King, the Gana are mumbling something. What are they doing?”
Han Sen informed Gold Jade King. He was feeling very nervous about
it all.</p>
<p>Gold Jade King looked at the Gana and said, “This is the
language of the Gana. They are praying for the assistance of their
god. If their deified elite was here, their prayers might actually
help. But that elite betrayed the Gana long ago, and they might not
respond to the prayers.”</p>
<p>Gold Jade King went back to ignoring Han Sen and bidding on the
lady.</p>
<p>Many Kings were elites, and they were fearless. Even though
there was danger in being there, they wouldn’t stop. They would try
to grab whatever resources they could first.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not that strong, and he was afraid of what might
happen. He listened to Gold Jade King’s words and got even more
nervous.</p>
<p>“Icebird Duke, let’s go,” Han Sen said, standing up.</p>
<p>“Why?” Icebird Duke was able to sense something was wrong, but
not with the clarity Han Sen could.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have the time to explain. He walked away and
said, “I am uncomfortable. Let’s walk and talk, shall we?” Icebird
Duke was confused, but she still stood up and followed Han Sen out
of the hall.</p>
<p>Before they made it outside, however, the lady being sold on the
stage raised her voice. Emotionlessly, she called out, “Hearts like
glass, bodies like mirrors, fall to hell and become dust. If the
heart has heaven, only then will you be free.”</p>
<p>“If the heart has heaven, only then will you be free.” The
praying Gana all began to open their eyes. Their voices bellowed
over the proceedings of the auction.</p>
<p>“Shut up.” A Kao guard hit one of the girls.</p>
<p>She didn’t try to avoid the strike, and she allowed the whip to
hit her. Her lovely face was marred by the presence of a mark.</p>
<p>The girl that was hit ignored the strike, and she continued to
speak.</p>
<p>“I told you to shut up, didn’t I?” The Kao guard hit her again.
Her snow-white skin split open, and blood began to spill over her
body.</p>
<p>The lady still kept her holy look, though. She was chanting
alongside the other Gana, uncaring for the wounds she had
sustained. It seemed as if she wasn’t the one bleeding.</p>
<p>Kings like Gold Jade King were now starting to feel as if
something was really wrong. Thinking they were strong, though, they
did not believe they had a reason to fall back.</p>
<p>The strongest Gana there was no greater than a Duke, so they did
not think they had to be afraid. They did not have to give up the
Gana they had already bought, either.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the statue in the hall suddenly made a katcha noise.
The statue cracked, and the crack wreathed its way around the
entire statue.</p>
<p>A big slab of stone fell from the statue. It was followed by
another, and another, and another. When the rocks fell, they
revealed something gold inside the statue.</p>
<p>“Something is inside that Gana statue!” Everyone was shocked,
looking towards the statue.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There were too many cracks across the statue, and they
eventually caused it to shatter like glass. All the stone fell off,
revealing a gold statue on the inside.</p>
<p>That Gana goddess statue looked just like Guna, as well. Just
like the lady on stage did. The snake tail of the statue-
come-to-life slithered slowly back and forth. The floor began to
rise up as countless twisted arms. They looked like demonic arms
from hell. The goddess did not look down to the ground. Her hand
was raised, and her eyes looked up to the sky. She looked very
holy.</p>
<p>Seeing that weird Gana statue, Gold Jade King and the others
were all stunned. One Duke was so scared, he screamed, “Purgatory
Heaven! This is the Gana’s deified item. Why would it be here?”</p>
<p>“Kill these Gana, we cannot let them activate Purgatory Heaven!”
some Noble shouted.</p>
<p>Some people started to run off, but it was too late to do that.
The sky above the hall was shining with gold. You could not see the
stars or the galaxy high above.</p>
<p>The place was plunged into complete darkness. The machines came
to a stop. The sky above was bright, but its light didn’t reach the
ground. Only the gold Gana statue lit up the hall. Everything else
was dark; it looked like hell.</p>
<p>Someone drew out a weapon and killed the Gana right next to him,
but when the Gana died, their light was absorbed by the statue. And
when it did, the whole world became darker.</p>
<p>“Idiot! Don’t kill them. They are sacrificing themselves,” a
King shouted coldly.</p>
<p>Horrible screams began to erupt from the outside. A Kao from
outside rushed into the hall, but a large portion of her body had
already been ripped away. She struggled a bit and then died.</p>
