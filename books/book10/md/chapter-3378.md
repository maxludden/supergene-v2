  He only knew two Reboot God Spirits. One of them was Bao’er’s father. The other was the God Hall Leader, God, who was currently in front of him.

If Qin Xiu had a Reboot-class God Spirit gene, there was a 90% chance that the one Qin Xiu had was not the one currently in front of him. That seemed to leave out one of the options, which meant there was only one possibility remaining.

This manner of guessing seemed to surprise Han Sen. If Qin Xiu had the previous God Hall Leader’s genes, what could that mean? Han Sen felt as if his brain was not working right.

“Did Chaos not tell you about Qin Xiu?” God looked surprised.

“She told me Qin Xiu was Human Alpha, who was also Wu Wei Dao Alpha,” Han Sen said.

“That is correct, but Human Alpha himself is…” After saying that, God stopped speaking. He looked at Han Sen and said, “If Chaos did not tell you, then I should keep my mouth closed.”

Numerous frown lines sprung up on Han Sen’s forehead. He was very frustrated and wanted to step on God’s face.

“What are you doing here? This cannot just be a social call to check up on how I am doing.” Han Sen looked at God. He sounded very displeased.

“We are friends. I would never be cruel to you.” God smiled and said, “I came looking for you because I want to know how Bao’er is doing. If Qin Xiu makes his final step and controls the geno tablet, that would be disastrous. We are going to need Bao’er.”

“What does Qin Xiu actually want?” Han Sen didn’t get it. He did not actually know what Qin Xiu wanted.

God sighed and said, “I am not a bug in his stomach, so I do not know what he is thinking. Judging from his current course of action, I would say he wants to reboot the universe.”

“Reboot the universe? What does that have to do with him?” Han Sen did not understand.

Last time, the previous God Hall Leader rebooted the universe by sacrificing himself. Fortunately, aside from stopping the rise of the God Chaos Party, nothing truly terrible happened.

God said, “Ordinary universal reboots are a way to set the universe back to its origin point. It is similar to the geno tablet being rebooted. It will not really distort space, but Qin Xiu has the geno prototype armor. On top of that, he has reboot powers. He also has the geno tablet’s power. Maybe he can really reverse the universe’s space and have it go back to the moment Qin Xiu precisely wants.”

Han Sen was shocked. He seemed to understand something, so he asked, “Does Qin Xiu want to reverse the universe and send everything back to the point when Wan’er died?”

“Maybe. Qin Xiu’s relationship with Wan’er is very intimate,” God said. “He has real feelings for her. Aside from his feelings toward Wan’er, when Qin Xiu was Human Alpha, a massively bad thing happened. So, I am not sure how far back he wants to take the universe.”

“If Qin Xiu successfully reverses times, what will happen?” Han Sen asked.

God shook his head. “I do not know. No one has ever done this before. In theory, it should not be possible because time and space have a line. If it exists, there is always a trace. Things can never go back to how they used to be. Even if we have the Reboot-class God Spirit reboot power, it will only make the universe return to its origin. That is not really a reversal of time and space.”

After pausing for a moment, God said, “If this is really successful, there are two possibilities. First, when time reboots, all the time and space markings will be erased. Whatever happens after that will never have existed before.”

Han Sen was more interested in the second possibility. The first possibility seemed rather normal. Even he was able to guess that.

“The second possibility is probably much worse,” God said. “That is because the reversal of time and space betrays the laws of karma. It is a basic law and something that cannot be allowed. The existences that betray this causal power become erased.”

Han Sen did not understand. After thinking it over a few times, he suddenly developed a cold sweat.

Upon seeing Han Sen’s face, God understood the man before now understood what was being said. He seriously said, “It is just as you thought. If the second situation happens, it will be the end of the world. Everything will be reduced to zero, and that will include you and me.”

Han Sen looked at God and asked, “If you knew this, why did you not try and stop Qin Xiu?”

“Do you think I did not want to? I am God. I am the master of the God Hall. But even what I do must abide by the rules. What Qin Xiu does is outside the rules. Do you understand what I am saying?” God looked bitter.

“Is there no other way?” Han Sen frowned.

God looked at Han Sen seriously as he said, “Yes. We must make the last step and go beyond the rules. If we beat Qin Xiu, he cannot reboot the universe.”

“I do not want Bao’er to take on this much responsibility.” Han Sen shook his head.

“I did not say we should use Bao’er. I was saying we should use you.” God’s words surprised Han Sen.

“Did you not just say only Bao’er can fight Qin Xiu?” Han Sen looked at God with a confused expression.

“In theory, that is correct. From a gene perspective, only Bao’er can fight Qin Xiu. There is no third creature that has great genes like that.”

Han Sen knew God must have had more to say. He remained silent so he could keep going.

God went on to say, “There is an exception to everything. Perhaps you can be one such accident.”

Han Sen looked at God Hall Leader and asked, “What are the chances of that?”

“Up until now, I have not seen such a chance.” God’s answer made frown lines form on Han Sen’s forehead.

God smiled. He patted Han Sen on the shoulder and said, “If I can find a chance, it will not be an accident. So, just give it a try. Maybe you will be lucky enough to get the one out of a billion chance needed. Even if you fail, it will not matter to me. You are the one who will be dead. Not me.”

Han Sen was speechless. He felt as if God had only just gone there to make him angry.

“OK, I should go.” God turned around and readied himself to leave.

“Are you just going to sit there and wait for a result?” Han Sen did not believe God was going to sit back and do nothing, putting the fate of everything in the hands of others.

“Me? I am going to try my luck. Maybe I will end up the lucky one.” God did not look back. He smiled. His body then vanished.

Han Sen was shocked. God had said it so relaxed, but Han Sen had a bad feeling about this.
