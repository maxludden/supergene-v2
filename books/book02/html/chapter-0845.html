    <p>
      &#8220;Why do I always bend over backwards if it means securing a coin or
      two? I will die for this money, I tell you!&#8221; Wang Yuhang was
      speaking to himself, doing his best to inspire a return of confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Uncle, what you have just said is not down to luck. If you
      want to make an inspirational speech, don&#8217;t tell yourself you are
      going to die!&#8221; Han Sen laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang replied, &#8220;Oh, yes. That is correct! I am going to waltz
      into that mangled hive of doom and tango out with vast riches I can use to
      woo a woman and make her my wife! If you are listening, God, disregard
      what I said earlier.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang started to leg it forward, but Han Sen pulled him back and
      said, &#8220;Whoa, don&#8217;t rush. We should be extra sure of what
      we&#8217;re walking into here. Fire an arrow from afar and then run.
      You&#8217;ll need as much distance as you can get.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, yes. Of course! I am not an imbecile, I&#8217;ll have you know.
      I am an aged warrior, one who has far more experience than you in such
      arts.&#8221; Wang Yuhang rolled his eyes, and then started his approach
      from the nearby stands of trees. He slithered around like a snake doing
      the mamba, and when he was in firing range, fired an arrow towards the
      minotaur.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the arrow took flight, he didn&#8217;t wait to see if he had struck
      his desired target. As soon as the arrow loosed, he ran off quicker than a
      spooked bunny.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen froze in disbelief. He had missed, and the minotaur was none the
      wiser.
    </p>

    <p>Pat!</p>

    <p>
      But just as Han Sen believed Wang Yuhang to have failed, the ground seemed
      to quake and move. A rocky golem picked itself up out of the mud. Catching
      sight of the human who had disturbed its slumber, it cried out and chased
      after Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      This also spooked the minotaur, and after propping its spear, it ran after
      Wang Yuhang, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bird in the sky divebombed in his direction, with its razor eyes
      peering at its troublesome prey.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not bad.&#8221; Han Sen sighed with relief. The arrow had totally
      missed its target, but even despite that, he had managed to draw the ire
      of at least three super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Wang Yuhang about to lose his lead and succumb to the creatures
      that hounded him, Han Sen stealthily caught up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not dare attack just yet, as they were too close to the
      Devil-Blood Shelter. The creatures inside the shelter, if they were made
      aware of the trouble outside, would send out reinforcements before
      he&#8217;d be able to slay even just one. Escape from such a situation
      would be no trivial task.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, save me!&#8221; Wang Yuhang called out at the top of his
      lungs when he caught a glimpse of the manic bird that was descending upon
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was still too soon to do anything, however. To avoid his presence being
      known, Han Sen just continued to follow, ignoring Wang Yuhang&#8217;s
      plight. They still needed to go further before doing anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was a proficient kiter, but even his speed could not outpace a
      super creature. Eventually, the bird did indeed catch up. It twirled its
      lethal talons in the air to cast bladed gusts of wind after him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rocky giant, at the same time, threw its boulder-fist into the earth
      and created a large hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      As this was happening, the minotaur swung its spear to cast a fireball
      towards Wang Yuhang. Quite clearly, he was now in danger.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, save me! I will not last much longer, I beseech your
      immediate aid! This entire ordeal was a maniacal concoction of your own
      twisted mind. You tricked me into this. Aaargh!&#8221; Wang Yuhang cried
      out, pitiably.
    </p>

    <p>
      The razor-winds sliced his arm, drawing an alarming cascade of blood. The
      fireball caught his clothes on fire, which set him ablaze. Through the
      fire and blood, he was being pursued by three super creatures. And now,
      more than ever, he truly was in danger. His life was at risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      But still, Han Sen ignored his cries for aid. He expected Wang Yuhang to
      have used his Angel Gene Fluid by now, but he hadn&#8217;t. Han Sen
      thought it was typical of the cheap and stingy bastard he thought he was.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were still too close to the shelter. Attacking now would foil his
      plans of infiltration. And as Wang Yuhang was still alive and able to
      scream and shout just fine, he&#8217;d let him be chased for a while
      longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Wang Yuhang noticed his cries for help being ignored by Han Sen, he
      acknowledged the danger he was in. He realized that he might well and
      truly die where he was. With great regret, he knew what he had to do. He
      pulled out his injector and a vial of Angel Gene Fluid and gave himself a
      shot of the super juice.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Wang Yuhang ran, his eyes turned red. A horn grew out of his forehead,
      and his speed and agility increased.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was still under the cruel pursuit of three super creatures, but at
      least he wasn&#8217;t suffering anymore. Managing to flee their wrath with
      greater ease, he reached the cover of the forest much sooner.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He should have done that far sooner. Being stingy at a time like
      this is a surefire way to reach an early grave.&#8221; Han Sen despised
      his hesitance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang&#8217;s mobility was admirable as he attempted to escape. It
      was quite remarkable, watching him flee. Han Sen couldn&#8217;t help
      comparing it to a salmon leaping upstream with unpredictable movements.
      Still, it wasn&#8217;t anywhere near the dexterity one could exert when
      making use of Heavenly Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Impressed by what he saw, Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to track his
      movements. Surprisingly, he found it difficult to predict what he&#8217;d
      do next. He had mustered a very strange manner of flight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every time Han Sen predicted a movement, he&#8217;d be wrong. But he
      didn&#8217;t think Wang Yuhang moved the way he did consciously, and it
      was more like he was making up his movements as he went. Each step was
      random, but despite that, the results were good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t that it was entirely inferior to Heavenly Go, it
      was just different. Heavenly Go engaged your intelligence and abilities of
      prediction, in which you thought of where to move next before committing a
      step. Wang Yuhang was just moving, simple as that. He did whatever entered
      his mind, to surprisingly decent results.
    </p>

    <p>
      His ability to move with such recklessness and survive almost made Han Sen
      reconsider whether he had good luck or bad luck.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, I beseech your aid once more. Death follows me at a very
      near distance, it mocks me. It tells me I will be in his company very soon
      if you do not help me right now!&#8221; Wang Yuhang continued to scream.
      By now, he had been running for over an hour, and the red of his eyes
      began to fade. The size of his horn reduced.
    </p>

    <p>
      The benefits of his Angel Gene Fluid were quickly wearing away, and he
      wouldn&#8217;t last much longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Wang Yuhang reach a valley, Han Sen thought it was time. He
      summoned Moment Queen and the little angel, and commanded them to tackle a
      super creature each. He himself went to engage the minotaur.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen went up against the rock golem, and he commanded her to use
      speed to kite it away while he kited the minotaur.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen still depended on his little angel more than anything. She was
      currently possessed by the Steel-Knight King, which made her stronger than
      the average super creature. It made her more reliable to him now, as well.
      With her power, she&#8217;d be able to easily slay the wind-elemental
      bird.
    </p>

    <p>
      And as suspected, the little angel did not disappoint Han Sen. Within a
      few moments of fighting, she had covered the bird&#8217;s back with a
      number of lacerations and wounds. A whirlwind of loose feathers and blood
      formed in the sky as the bird struggled against its new foe. It would be
      killed very soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strange bird cawed to the skies, as if it were sending an SOS signal
      to the nearby shelter. And when it did this, Han Sen&#8217;s eyes looked
      murderous. His Flaming Rex Spike smacked into the minotaur&#8217;s spear,
      like two geysers of fire colliding. Han Sen was knocked back two steps,
      not as strong as the minotaur.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox, who was perched on Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder, suddenly
      opened its mouth and fired a thunderbolt at the minotaur.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The advantage the minotaur had just gained on Han Sen quickly disappeared.
      As the minotaur was unable to follow-up with an additional attack, the
      silver fox saved its master by delivering an unavoidable bolt of lightning
      to the minotaur.
