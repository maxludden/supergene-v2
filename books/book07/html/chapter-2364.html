<p>“Bai Yi…” Prince Swordstar shouted. He sounded as if he was
about to eat someone.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen unleashed his Shocking Sky Punch, and the half-deified
guard’s bones were pulverized. There wasn’t a single inch of bone
that remained intact. His body slumped to the ground like a sack of
mud.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the half-deified guard and lifted him back up.
The man’s body was trashed, but he wasn’t dead. Han Sen threw him
at Prince Swordstar.</p>
<p>“As per your request, he is alive,” Han Sen said flatly.</p>
<p>“Bai Yi, I will kill you.” Prince Swordstar caught the guard,
whose entire body had been devastated. Han Sen had even shattered
the guard’s xenogeneic gene. Prince Swordstar was furious.</p>
<p>“I have gone to so much trouble to be nice to you. You asked me
to keep him alive. I refrained from killing him, and you still
aren’t happy. It’s hard work being a big brother.” Han Sen said,
then he jumped.</p>
<p>The other three guards were overwhelmed with a mixture of anger
and fear. They wanted to run away, but the Shocking Sky Punch was
already coming down on them like the angry waves of a turbulent
sea.</p>
<p>They couldn’t escape that wrath, but if they tried to repel it,
that raging power would still crush their bodies. The punching
powers came for each of them in turn. The two ninth-tier Kings went
down first, then the last half-deified guard fell as well. Han Sen
trashed their bodies in a few quick punches, then tossed their
crippled bodies back toward Prince Swordstar.</p>
<p>The nearby royal children were shocked. Han Sen’s cruel and
overbearing skills made them think twice about how they might treat
him in the future.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar gritted his teeth until his jaws ached, and he
had to resist the urge to attack Han Sen himself. He glared at Han
Sen, then carried the four disabled guards away.</p>
<p>“Come on! That Prince Swordstar is such a wimp. He’s just
accepting that loss?” Prince Nineteen lifted his lips in a
sneer.</p>
<p>“That is why he is scary. That Prince Swordstar isn’t one to be
ruled by simple emotions.” Bai Canglang approached. He sighed and
said, “Our generation of the Extreme King is both the most
promising and the most hopeless generation there has ever been.
There are too many wonderful royal children, and now there are
people like Sixteen, Seventeen, and even Swordstar. When the time
comes for someone to claim leadership, it won’t happen
peacefully.”</p>
<p>“Chaos is fun. Otherwise, life is like a pool of stagnant water.
That is boring,” Prince Nineteen said.</p>
<p>Everyone watched as Han Sen climbed onto the primary root king
dragon. No one dared to provoke him; he had just suppressed
half-deified guards, after all. The royal children knew they
couldn’t compete against Han Sen. Even the ones that could fight
him knew that they didn’t want to do so in King’s Garden.</p>
<p>Han Sen took the blood kirin up to sit atop the king dragon’s
head with him. The other royal children drifted away.</p>
<p>After a few hours of daylight, the yellow leaves began to glow.
The primary root king dragon roared and dropped underground.</p>
<p>Unlike the small king dragon Han Sen had used before, this
primary root king dragon was big, and it went far underground. It
went so close to that golden spot.</p>
<p>When Han Sen had trained with Bai Wei, the source of power had
looked like a distant golden sun. Now, because he was so much
closer, it was too big to describe.</p>
<p>Waves of gold king air began to emerge and flow over Han Sen and
the blood kirin. Any king air he absorbed would help Han Sen refine
the powers in his body.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was sucking in the king air greedily, and he
looked healthier with every breath.</p>
<p>After Han Sen absorbed thirty waves of king air, he heard an
announcement play in his head.</p>
<p>Duke Gene +1.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, but he was also very happy. He said, “Are
these waves of king air actually xenogeneic genes?”</p>
<p>When he came last time, he had been very far from the tree. The
king air he absorbed had been too weak to generate a Duke gene. Now
he had a lot of king air, so he could exploit its full
strength.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t been terribly interested in the king air before,
but now he was motivated. He absorbed the king air as fast as he
could. He absorbed fifty waves of king air and heard the Duke gene
notification once more.</p>
<p>“If this is the case, I don’t need to find any more xenogeneics.
Simply absorbing this king air will give me enough Duke genes!” Han
Sen thought happily. He had claimed this primary root king dragon,
and so he was going to absorb the king air like mad.</p>
<p>While the primary root king dragon was still underground, Han
Sen’s Duke gene tally reached the prestigious one hundred. He
absorbed many waves of king air, but his Duke genes didn’t increase
beyond that.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the hundred Duke genes to open the first gene lock
of The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>It was a smooth process that went exactly as it had for
Jadeskin. After The Story of Genes had its first gene lock open, he
obtained an astral body in the geno universe.</p>
<p>One hundred Duke genes were gone from his total, and so Han Sen
stayed put to collect more of that king air. His Duke gene tally
started to rack up again.</p>
<p>“This is some good stuff.” Han Sen grinned. He had claimed this
primary root king dragon, so he wasn’t going to go anywhere. He
planned to use the king air to unlock the gene locks of a few
different geno arts.</p>
<p>Somewhere far away in King’s Kingdom, there was a mountain that
hung in the darkness. The mountain looked gigantic, but no matter
how long you spent flying toward its peak, you could never reach
the mountain.</p>
<p>It was known as Extreme Mountain, one of the three famous
mountains of King’s Kingdom. Countless terrifying legends swirled
around its existence, and many elites had been killed while
exploring its reaches. Many half-deified and deified elites were
said to roam there.</p>
<p>The secrets of Extreme Mountain had yet to be discovered, as
there were many places on the mountain’s slopes that not even King
Bai himself would dare explore.</p>
<p>On the left side of Extreme Mountain, a ghost-like man walked
along a path.</p>
<p>Every step he took was like some invincible power was coming
down on him, making his body look lighter. By the time he was
halfway up the slope, his body appeared half-transparent. He looked
as if he was going to fade away at any second.</p>
<p>But that man still stared up at the peak of Extreme Mountain,
and he kept walking forward in a bid to reach it.</p>
<p>“Half mountain, half sky, half extreme. One step, one life, one
world.” When he was halfway up the mountain, he saw that sentence
scrawled into a cliff face. It was written in blood.</p>
<p>The man saw it, but he kept on going up the mountain. He didn’t
pay any further attention to the writing.</p>
<p>The legends state that those words were left behind by the
Extreme King’s seventh king. The seventh king went there as a
half-deified, and he stopped there to write that down before
leaving.</p>
<p>After that, all the heirs of the Extreme King that ventured to
the Extreme Mountain and went past those words were known to have
died. There had only been one exception to that rule.</p>
<p>The exception was the previous ruler of the Extreme King, King
Bao. King Bao went past the writing, but he didn’t die. And he
never talked about his experiences on Extreme Mountain. All he said
was that if there was any person fortunate enough to reach the top
of Extreme Mountain, they would become the best of their generation
and achieve an invincible body.</p>
