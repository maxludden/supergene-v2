    <p>1696 God’s Organization’s Assaul</p>
    <p>
      On Planet Roca, seven creatures dressed in black were hovering in the air
      above Han Sen’s house. They were watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yake, you are being too careful. It is only the Han family, and we aren’t
      even certain they are descended from Han Jinzhi. Even if they were, you
      wouldn’t need me and Rudy here. And here we are, alongside Buck,” Gugia
      said to Yake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yake’s gaze was directed at Han Manor. He saw Ji Yanran, Zero, Bao’er, and
      Stay Up Late all eating food together in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be careful. Snake Witch, Black Tiger, and Lou Jia all died. Maybe Han
      Jinzhi is still protecting them. Our opponent is not Han Sen, after all.
      It is Han Jinzhi.” After Yake said this, he talked to a man with white
      hair. “New Community Leader, how are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Yufei, who had become the New Community Leader, calmly said, “The New
      Community has cut off all connections between Planet Roca and the galaxy
      outside. For the next two days, no one in the Alliance will be able to
      help this planet. I am not sure about the Ji family, but they won’t
      receive word of any suspicious activity for at least three hours. We have
      cordoned off the area, as well, not allowing any other human to approach
      the airspace.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good. Thank you,” Yake said coldly. Then he turned to Buck and another
      three creatures. “Do it. Handle the Han family. Han Sen and his son must
      be taken alive, but do with the others as you deem necessary. Me, Rudy,
      and Gugia will deal with Han Jinzhi or any other elites that show up. You
      will go in unopposed and undisturbed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” Buck and the other creatures heard what was said, and then flew
      down into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all members of God’s Organization, but there was a hierarchy and
      tiering between them. The geno armors that God’s Organization possessed
      all had limitations. The members had to be approved and authorized to make
      use of an armor before donning one. Yake, Rudy, and Gugia were of a higher
      tier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buck and the others were still in training after becoming gods. They did
      not have self-geno armor, and they could not be approved. So, their tier
      was lower. But the creatures that could level up to reach the Alliance
      were very powerful, of course. And they were very proud of their
      accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Jinzhi was there, or any other geno armor elites, they would be
      afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the garden, all they could see were a bunch of youngsters. They did
      not think they’d have much trouble dealing with them. After all, they had
      been in the top of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary in their time there. Some
      referred to them as actual Gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Lan was having food with the family at the table. Golden Growler, who
      looked like a lion-dog, suddenly stood up and roared to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran knew Golden Growler wouldn’t just randomly bark or
      howl, so they looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fiery dragon came swooping down. It was over a hundred meters long,
      carried by swathes of red and blue flame. When it got in close, it
      brightened everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left of the dragon was a monster with four wings. It had black
      scales. It was not as large as the dragon, but it was still ten meters
      long. On the right of it was an icy eagle. The wings of the creature were
      twenty meters long, and it came down shrouded in a snowstorm of its own
      creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three creatures covered the entire city. The building where the Han
      family lived suffered the brunt of that frightening aura.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Lan and Ji Yanran’s faces paled slightly. These attackers were
      stronger than demigods, so needless to say, they were scared quite a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buck and the others hadn’t been approved to wear geno armor, and neither
      did they have their own self geno armor. But still, they had been in the
      Alliance for many years. Their fitness was far better than the top
      demigods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans did not have many top-ranking demigods. Aside from Luo Haitang, the
      others were just gemstone class. And that was still a ways from Buck’s
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst Luo Lan’s fear, she heard a loud noise. Golden Growler’s body was
      expanding, and immediately, he went flying up towards Buck and the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was getting bigger in the air, like a mountain. And on top of that, he
      was wearing a gold set of armor. The fire dragon Buck looked like a lizard
      in front of the giant Golden Growler. The other two were tinier than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden Growler brought his gaping maw towards Buck as the dragon swung its
      talons defensively. But Golden Growler’s teeth came down on his neck and
      broke it. Blood cascaded down like a waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden Growler was using a geno armor to bully the would-be assaulters
      coming down from the sky. He ripped the three God-class creatures apart in
      no time. They were bleeding all over, shocking all who witnessed the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Lan and Ji Yanran were stunned by the sight, as they hadn’t expected
      Golden Growler to be that strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late observed Golden Growler’s geno armor and squinted in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yake, Rudy, and Gugia were shocked, too. They were waiting for other
      elites to back the family up, and they never suspected the dog-looking
      creature at the table was the one they feared. Golden Growler had managed
      to kill Buck and severely damage the other two creatures in no time at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s so wrong! An elite with geno armor pretending to be a simple pet
      dog. Oh, I am going to kill it!” Gugia roared. He flew in front of Golden
      Growler and stopped him from finishing off the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gugia looked like a human, but he had a third eye in his forehead. He was
      wearing white geno armor when he swooped down to go against Golden
      Growler.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      Golden Growler slapped Gugia, and he was sent rolling a few thousand
      miles. His face looked glum, and he immediately acknowledged that he was
      no match for Golden Growler’s strength.
