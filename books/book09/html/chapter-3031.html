<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The pillars of the geno hall were broken. The door was broken
too. One was able to see the door had flames waving. All the race
lanterns were becoming bright and dark like they were going to be
put out by a raging storm.</p>
<p>When the geno hall fell, all the god temples were shaken away by
the god light. It seemed as if the god temples and universe were
dead. Aside from hopeless cries, there were no other sounds.</p>
<p>Even the sky full of God Spirits went silent. There were only
the sounds of breaking.</p>
<p>“Such a disaster. I wonder how many creatures in the universe
can survive all this.” Sky Palace Leader’s face was cold like ice.
There were even all sorts of disasters in Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The White Jade Jing Tower and Jade City were revealed. A holy
air came out from there. The holy air of the White Jade Jing was
headed for Sky Palace. It made the people of Sky Palace cry. If
there had been no elites and the support of the holy gourd vine,
Sky Palace would have been broken by the holy air.</p>
<p>Outer Sky was not faring any better. The ground cracked. Loads
of holy air pillars came out like volcanic eruptions, making the
ground leak. Xenogeneics were running around like mad. All law and
order was broken.</p>
<p>Sky Palace and Outer Sky were like that too. Other xenogeneic
spaces and normal planets were like that as well.</p>
<p>“The universe is going to end.” A hopeless fear was in every
creature’s heart. No one knew if they would survive this
disaster.</p>
<p>Wah! Wah! In a stream, a Kate baby was floating. There was a sad
crying sound. In the flood’s roaring, it sounded quiet.</p>
<p>In a volcanic eruption, many cities and villages were destroyed.
Some planets were even hit by asteroids and blew up.</p>
<p>“Open it for me!” Qin Xiu’s eyes looked very passionate. With
blood flame suppression, he crushed the geno hall’s door. Shattered
rocks were strewn everywhere.</p>
<p>God’s body was crushed. He slipped into the geno hall. He
stopped before the 10,000 lanterns. Behind him, many of the race
lanterns were out.</p>
<p>When each race lantern was put out, one of the high races was
heavily damaged. It made the races that were already suffering
disasters fare even worse.</p>
<p>God looked at Qin Xiu and said, “One person is making a billion
races extinct. Is this really worth it?”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu coldly said, “When I was in my most hopeless time, there
was only one person next to me. To me, this world only consists of
this one person. There are billions of creatures, but they mean
nothing to me. I do not need to care about them.”</p>
<p>After that, Qin Xiu kept pushing forward to suppress the geno
hall. Each step Qin Xiu took resulted in God taking one step back.
He was going to strike the 10,000 race lanterns behind him.</p>
<p>All the races knew that if the race lanterns were snuffed out,
the geno hall would be done for. But no one was able to stop Qin
Xiu. Even the strongest god could not prohibit Qin Xiu’s march on
the geno hall.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu wanted to walk forward even more. He wanted to destroy
the geno hall, but he suddenly stopped. His gaze was frozen. He
turned around and looked into space.</p>
<p>The hearts of the many hopeless races jumped. They did not know
what happened. Why would Qin Xiu stop walking? It made them have a
slight glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>“At this time, what in the universe could make Qin Xiu care?”
Many elites were feeling both confused and nervous.</p>
<p>Most of the high races were already there. Under the suppression
of Qin Xiu, even a true god elite had dropped out of deified class.
No creatures were able to combat Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>They were hoping and praying for a miracle to strike, but they
knew the chance of a miracle was far too small.</p>
<p>They still looked in the direction Qin Xiu was looking. They
were hoping for something, but they did not spy any strong presence
from that direction.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked in that direction and said to himself, “What is
going on? Is this just my imagination? Why do I feel restless?” He
was feeling a strong sense of nervousness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the elites saw a white shadow slowly appear from that
direction. It was not fast or have a powerful presence. It was like
a morning sun rising into the sky. It walked into the geno hall’s
area.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader’s eyes were the strongest. He saw the white
shadow clearly, so he screamed aloud, “It’s Han Sen! He is still
alive!”</p>
<p>Many elites saw it clearly thereafter. It was Han Sen who had
walked into the geno hall</p>
<p>area.</p>
<p>Han Sen was different from how he had been before. His body did
not have the red fire. His body had a white color and was
half-transparent. He did not look like a creature from the
universe. He looked like a God Spirit.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu saw Han Sen step forward. His expression immediately
changed. He stared at Han Sen as if he had seen something
unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Impossible. The testing of super genes was not successful. How
could a power like this exist… It cannot be the perfect super gene…
It should have flaws like Wan’er does.” Qin Xiu was talking to
himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped a short distance away. His Super God Spirit mode
was still affected by Wan’er’s proximity. Han Sen looked at Qin Xiu
and said, “Qin Xiu, leave Littleflower’s body. This is your last
chance.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu coldly said, “I clearly underestimated you if your genes
were able to evolve to this level. Even if you are so close to the
super gene, you are still useless. Failure is failure. In front of
Wan’er, who is even closer to super gene, your power will be
suppressed.” “Really?” Han Sen coldly asked. The Story of Genes was
running in his body. When The Story of Genes ran, Han Sen’s body
was in xenogeneic mode.</p>
<p>Xenogeneic mode and Super God Spirit mode were activated on Han
Sen’s body. It made his presence appear a bit strange. “Dollar… Han
Sen is Dollar…” All the creatures of the universe were suddenly
frozen. They thought it was weird for Han Sen to be using Super God
Spirit body. Now, he had a xenogeneic battle body. It was clear to
them now. Anyone was able to tell that Han Sen and Dollar were the
same person. “Han Sen and Dollar are the same person,” Yisha said.
She looked very conflicted. She could not believe it. Her eyes
opened wide. She thought about the past and looked even more
complicated. Her face turned green, and her face turned white and
red. She did not know how to think or feel.</p>
<p>On Empty Mountain, the green-haired growler’s mouth opened wide.
He did not close it. Now, he understood why Golden Growler gave
Dollar first place and adhered to what he told it.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! Godfather Han and Dollar are the same person.”</p>
<p>“This… This is unbelievable…”</p>
<p>At the end of the world, many creatures were frozen. They could
not believe their eyes.</p>
<p>“This guy. He has finally exposed himself.” Wang Yuhang shrugged
with his shoulders. He knew this would happen.</p>
<p>The people in Space Garden were not so surprised. Han Sen never
told them anything, but most of them had figured it out.</p>
