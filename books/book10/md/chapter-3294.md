  When the flower died down, the flower’s vines wrapped around the skeleton came back to life. They started to grow bones and flesh. Han Sen was shocked by this development.

“Is this skeleton not fully dead yet? Is it going to revive?” Han Sen looked at the skeleton. He seemed hopeful.

This skeleton was a pure spirit body. If it was able to be revived, the same was likely possible for him. That would at least stop him from being so bored.

As to who this person was, whether or not he was good or bad was up for debate. Han Sen didn’t occupy his mind with such thoughts.

The white bones started to grow flesh. The scene was incredibly weird. Han Sen opened his eyes and watched the bones turn into a body that was wrapped in flesh.

It took 30 minutes for this process to be completed. Han Sen was now able to see what the person’s face was like, but he could not see the face yet. It was still very bloody. Still, Han Sen was able to tell it was a man.

Eventually, the skin grew. It soon started to look like a proper human.

When the man’s skin was complete and hair started to grow, Han Sen stared at the man’s face and frowned sternly.

“This guy looks like Dongxuan Zi.” Han Sen thought the man looked like Dongxuan Zi.

In the sanctuaries, Han Sen found Dongxuan Zi’s body. He had the Dongxuan Sutra on him, which fast became something very important to Han Sen. Without the Dongxuan Sutra, Han Sen would not have come as far as he had. He would have likely died a long time ago.

Han Sen had always admired Dongxuan Zi, but he was also always curious as to why Dongxuan Zi died in broken space.

These were all mysteries that Han Sen could not figure out. Now, he was looking at a dead body that looked like Dongxuan Zi. It filled him with a lot of strange feelings.

Not long later, the skeleton looked like a proper human. It looked like Dongxuan Zi. It looked like a worn, weathered, and tough man.

“Even if the body is rebuilt, if the spirit is long gone, he will not be able to live again. After all, humans are not God Spirits from the god temples. Even with bodies here, we cannot grow another spirit.” Han Sen looked at the man, who not moving at all. Although the power of the flesh was everywhere, he could not detect the presence of a life force.

Looking at things now, that man did not look like Dongxuan Zi anymore.

Han Sen looked at the man again. Earlier, he thought he was kind of familiar. Now that his hair was growing back and the face was cleared up, it did not look like him as much. It was just the face that was very familiar to him.

Han Sen peered at the man. He suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were as deep as the ocean. It was like he had been the toughness and happiness that came with being human.

Han Sen was shocked. The man opened his eyes, but the presence of a lifeforce was still absent.

Han Sen said to himself, “I forgot. He is a pure spirit body. Perhaps he can revive. The man started talking.

“I am a Dao student. I am here to watch the flower. It is a shame the universe has changed. The daylight shines across the land, burning everything there is. I am dying. I cannot guard the Otherside Flower anymore. I used the power of the Otherside Flower to leave behind my soul message. If a Dao student comes here, I hope he will be able to watch the Otherside Flower in my stead.” The man was speaking, but his eyes had no focus. He was like a robot with a low level of intelligence.

“This guy is calling himself a Dao student. Is he from Wu Wei Dao Palace?” Han Sen tried guessing.

The man went on to say, “I have guarded the Otherside Flower for many years. I have not done anything else since the day I started. I studied The Story of Genes for so long. There is much knowledge that is not in the party yet. It is all left behind here.”

When Han Sen heard that, he was well and truly shocked. That man knew The Story of Genes. That was really unbelievable.

“Bai Mo accepted Qin Xiu’s orders to find a way one could traverse along a path between the two worlds. Bai Mo’s last words were of him saying he found The Story of Genes and an old crystal in an old party. Does that mean the old party is the Dao, and this man belonged to that party?”

The man went on to say, “I studied the human body. I researched the secrets of the universe. I sought knowledge of humans and their association with the universe. The Story of Genes is a human password for genes. It is a key to the universe.”

Han Sen perked up his ears to listen to each word. He tried to remember everything the man was saying. The Story of Genes the man spoke about was not like Han Sen’s The Story of Genes. It sounded more like the reverse version of The Story of Genes.

They were still a bit different. Han Sen’s The Story of Genes was a modified version. Not just other people had modified it. Even when Han Sen practiced with it, he modified it too.

The man was referring to an older version.

Even so, it mattered little to Han Sen. He forced The Story of Genes to reverse, and something bad had happened to him.

Now, the man was talking about those skills. There was no doubt that this was a big breakthrough.

Unfortunately, Han Sen had a pure spirit body. Otherwise, with the man’s experience and The Story of Genes skill, perhaps he could make The Story of Genes break the world.

The man kept talking. His flesh started to dissolve. He was turning into a spirit light as he vanished. That spirit body’s spirit did not fly to the geno hall as an ordinary spirit would.

After the man was finished, his body had almost fully dissolved. He became a spirit light. It was like spirit rain falling on dust.

When the spirit light fell onto the black soil, the burned charcoal had no more life force. Now, it suddenly had a life force.

The dark faded away. It revealed the true colors of the ruins. Saplings were weaseling in through the gaps on the green stone bricks.

Without the covering of the charred soil, Han Sen could see a broken sign on the ruins. Two words were written on it: Sunrise Palace. This was not a god temple.

“Is this place really a remnant from the original era? In the original era, you could not travel through space. The Dao members could come to the planet called Day. Did he use his own powers to reach this place?” Han Sen looked at the Sunrise Palace plaque warily. It was kind of like a ruin.

Han Sen really wanted to move the collapsed stones away and find out if there was anything useful that he could nab from what remained of the Sunrise Palace. Unfortunately, his body went right through the stone.

“Having a spirit body sucks,” Han Sen said with a sigh. He had to give up on that idea.

“The Dao party sent a student to watch the Otherside Flower. Therefore, the Otherside Flower should be something quite special. Why did it vanish after I touched it?” Han Sen looked at his hands where the petal had melted into. There was no trace of it there anymore. Han Sen did not feel anything either.
