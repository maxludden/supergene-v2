<p>Back in Underwater Town, Han Sen decided to leave Bao’er in the
company of Lan Haixin, in case the Siren tried to do something that
would give him a headache later on.</p>
<p>A commoner could die, and no trouble would be caused, but if a
princess died, that could have dire repercussions for Planet Water
Zone. King Bai and many others would take the event quite
seriously. So, Han Sen needed to keep an eye on Lan Haixin.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with Bao’er by the woman’s side, he wasn’t worried
about her doing anything to rock the boat.</p>
<p>“Brother Sixteen, have you considered my proposal?” Bai Ling
Shuang’s video suddenly appeared on his phone.</p>
<p>“We can talk about this later. I’m not certain I will be able to
reach the peak of Rot Bone Mountain. If I make this agreement and
subsequently fail, I will only let you down,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“That is okay. As long as you try your best, I won’t attempt to
exact vengeance, even if you fail. And I will still give you your
rewards,” Bai Ling Shuang said.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can promise that?” Han Sen looked
hesitant.</p>
<p>“Brother Sixteen, tell me what you want. I will not be stingy in
what I offer. If you want Cher, Big Sister is happy to give her to
you.” Bai Ling Shuang smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re really willing to give me Cher?” Han Sen sounded
desperately hopeful, as if he was smitten in the throes of
love.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang smiled. “Brother Sixteen, the Foxes cannot be
trusted. You don’t really want a Fox as a guard, do you?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to let her go, Sister Ten?” Han Sen sounded
sad.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang shook her head. “Men have no resistance when it
comes to Foxes. It isn’t that I want to keep her from you; I’m just
afraid that something bad might happen if I don’t.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to let Cher go, Sister Ten, then give me one
hundred King class xenogeneic genes.” Han Sen looked annoyed as he
made this request.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t actually want Cher, of course. He had only
requested her so he could suggest the bounty of xenogeneic genes as
an alternative.</p>
<p>One hundred King class xenogeneic genes was a lot to ask for.
Even Bai Ling Shuang would feel a loss of that magnitude.</p>
<p>Of course, if Bai Ling Shuang gave Cher to him instead, Han Sen
would take her. If he had control of Cher, he might be able to use
her against Fox Queen. It would be perfect for him.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang frowned. One hundred King class xenogeneic genes
was too much. Even with her wealth, she couldn’t accept such an
offer easily.</p>
<p>She fell silent for a while. Then she looked back at Han Sen.
“How about this, Brother Sixteen? I will give you fifty King class
xenogeneic genes. If you help me reach the top of Rot Bone
Mountain, I will give you another fifty. If you are unable to reach
the top of the mountain, you can keep that first fifty just for
putting in the effort. What do you think of that?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Han Sen accepted the suggested bargain immediately.
Getting fifty King class genes would be perfect for Han Sen,
regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p>“Will you come to Night Charm Town, or do you want me to send
them to you?” Bai Ling Shuang asked in a level voice, fixing her
hair as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Let me come to Night Charm Town. I miss Cher. You wouldn’t be
too stingy to let her spend a night with me, would you, Sister
Ten?” Han Sen asked greedily.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang wasn’t fond of Han Sen’s avarice, but she still
agreed.</p>
<p>Bao’er and the little red bird were in Underwater Town, so Han
Sen wasn’t afraid that something ill would befall Lan Haixin and
Lilly.</p>
<p>Things went smoothly. Han Sen stayed with Cher for a night, but
instead of doing what Bai Ling Shuang thought they would be, they
laid on the bed and shared information.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought the fifty King class xenogeneic genes home with
him, but he couldn’t make use of them yet. When he reached King
class, Duke genes would be useless to him, so he needed to focus on
obtaining Duke genes for now. Using the King class genes while he
was still a Duke would be a waste.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the King class xenogeneic genes in storage and went
to King’s Garden. There, he absorbed a lot of king air to increase
his Duke gene tally.</p>
<p>Bai Yi was now considered one of the most powerful royal
children. The fact that Han Sen was no longer provoking the ire of
the real royal children was an indication of his strength. And
getting a primary root king dragon was not difficult.</p>
<p>Because he had access to the richest king air, Han Sen could
gain many Duke genes in a single day. He unlocked three gene locks
in each of his four geno arts, and he still had some time before
the big exam.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s element could fortify the body and provide
ice-sealing powers. Mutant Blood had the element of blood and a
genetic power. The Blood-Pulse Sutra was slightly different, in
that it had the element of time and space. And as for the Dongxuan
Sutra, Han Sen had no idea what category it belonged to.</p>
<p>The Story of Genes’ element was Eternity. It was able to freeze
things. As he gained control of different elements, the power of
Eternity would change and adapt. If he could use it well, it would
become very powerful.</p>
<p>After The Story of Genes opened its third gene lock, Han Sen
noticed a change when he used The Story of Genes. A strange
connection was forged with the black crystal armor. Although the
connection was weak, Han Sen could feel that the black crystal
armor had a lifeforce and will.</p>
<p>“Is the black crystal armor a living thing? Is there something
residing within the black crystal armor?” Han Sen didn’t
understand.</p>
<p>The connection was too weak, though, and it came and went.
Whenever he could feel it, the connection seemed blurry, like it
was distorted by static.</p>
<p>“After Spell levels up to King class, I should try to learn more
about the black crystal armor. Maybe I will find out what it is,”
Han Sen guessed to himself.</p>
<p>King’s Garden was very peaceful. The royal children were
preparing for their annual exams, and no one wanted to cause any
trouble before the exams were underway.</p>
<p>Han Sen left King’s Garden and returned to Underwater Town.
Right after he left King’s Garden, he felt a strange energy in his
ship. It was coming from behind him.</p>
<p>He looked over his shoulder and found Fox Queen sitting
there.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Han Sen turned back to the controls of his
ship.</p>
<p>Fox Queen remained sitting and smiled. “I am here because of
Destiny’s Tower.”</p>
<p>“My good Big Sister, many people have grown suspicious of me. It
is so difficult for me to protect myself. What do you want?” Han
Sen said.</p>
<p>“There is an opportunity sitting right before you, and it is
virtually devoid of risk. If you can rank among the top three in
the exam, you will gain access to Destiny’s Tower,” Fox Queen
said.</p>
<p>“I can enter Destiny’s Tower if I make it to the top three?” Han
Sen was shocked. If he had this chance, he would definitely like to
go to Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>“Yes, but you need to be in the top three,” Fox Queen nodded
with surety.</p>
<p>“Then I have no chance. There are two deified royal children,
and there are many half-deified. There are too many for me to
beat.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>Fox Queen smiled. “Be in the top three, or I will tell everyone
that you murdered Bai Yi. The choice is yours.”</p>
<p>“Why are you demanding something I cannot do? Can’t you be a
touch more reasonable?” Han Sen didn’t hear Fox Queen respond. He
looked back and saw that she was gone.</p>
