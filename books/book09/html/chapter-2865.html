<h3>Chapter 2865</h3>

<p>When Han Sen became butterfly class and his left eye combined
with the true god class Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye, he
accidentally leveled up.</p>
<p>It was a shame he failed to achieve true god class. Although his
leveling up had failed, the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye absorbed
Han Sen’s xenogeneic power. It resulted in a change. It combined
with Han Sen’s xenogeneic body, turning his left eye into a true
god class existence.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen’s whole body was mostly butterfly class. Only his
left eye was true god class. It was strange. His eye possessed law
power. With it combining with Han Sen’s xenogeneic power, it
created some sort of mutation. It was a bit different from the
Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye law power.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if his true god left eye could threaten Sky
Armor God, but this was a different god to the one in his house. He
sensed a very dark black color inside Sky Armor God’s body. It was
the color of crime. It was so dark that it was like ink. God only
knew how many sins Sky Armor God had committed to have this
color.</p>
<p>“It does not matter if you are a true god or a fake god. I will
judge your crimes today.” Han Sen sounded very cold. The
white-and-black colors of his eyes exploded.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>A black-and-white two-toned beam of light exploded from Han
Sen’s eye. It shone on Sky Armor God. The beam of light looked like
it was supposed to be there. Sky Armor God did not have any time to
react. His entire body was covered by the black-and-white two-toned
beam of light. The black beam of light became chains that entangled
Sky Armor God’s body. The white beam of light became a book. It was
in front of Sky Armor God.</p>
<p>Sky Armor God was shocked and angry. He tried his best to get
rid of the black chains, but he noticed his entire body had been
trapped by a weird power. He was unable to move.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? In the universe, there is a power that
can restrict my power. What is this power?” Sky Armor God was
shocked.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>Sky Armor God was tangled up by the black chains, so he could
not use his power. The bone slices around Han Sen started to fall
away. The purple bone slices turned into dust. Han Sen was set
free.</p>
<p>“Let me see what crimes Sky Armor God has committed.” Han Sen
raised his hands. The white beam of light became an old book that
landed on Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen flipped through the pages, but they were empty. There
was no law inside them. There also were no scales or counterweights
similar to when Han Sen was being judged.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen received the book, his brain had many images
playing like a movie. They kept flickering in his head. They made
Han Sen understand something. “Sky Armor God, you have committed
serious crimes. You should die.” Han Sen raised his head and wrote
down the word “die” in his book. The book suddenly flew up. The
word “die” started to shine. It became an executioner’s sword that
slashed toward Sky Armor God.</p>
<p>“How dare you, a low-life creature, judge a god like me.” Sky
Armor God was furious. Beneath the black chains that bound him, Sky
Armor God was unable to move his body.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The executioner’s sword came down. It cut off Sky Armor God’s
head, resulting in blood immediately squirting out. The creatures
in the universe were frozen. They could not believe what they were
seeing. Sky Armor God, who was so powerful earlier, had been simply
decapitated like that.</p>
<p>In Sky Palace, the woman opened her mouth in shock. “I… Am I
hallucinating? Sky Armor God was killed just like that?”</p>
<p>“That was like law power, but it was somewhat different.” Sky
Palace Leader also looked confused.</p>
<p>The Extreme King were very surprised. Bai Buyi was shocked.
“That power looked like the second leader of the Extreme King’s
Overbearing Eye, but it was still quite different. It is
scarier.”</p>
<p>“Can law power judge a god spirit? If we knew that, we should
have let our children and grandchildren learn the second leader’s
geno arts.”</p>
<p>“Who is this Dollar? He is too strange. Can he just kill a god
spirit like that?”</p>
<p>The universe was shocked to its core. Ordinary creatures did not
know how powerful god spirits were. Only the old antiques knew how
scary god spirits were. Every one of them looked surprised.</p>
<p>The execution ended. The black chains and old white book were
gone.</p>
<p>It did not make Han Sen feel relaxed. He still stared at Sky
Armor God’s body. Han Sen saw the body outside of the skeleton
armor was melting. Sky Armor God’s body looked like Deep Abyss
Knight again. After Han Sen slew Sky Armor God, the announcement he
got was for killing a butterfly Deep Abyss Knight. It was not for
killing Sky Armor God. Han Sen knew why this was happening. The
crime Han Sen saw did not belong to Sky Armor God. It belonged to
the true owner of the body, who was Deep Abyss Knight. The law
power could only judge Deep Abyss Knight’s body. It was unable to
kill Sky Armor God. It made Sky Armor God separate from Deep Abyss
Knight. He had become a god spirit with nothing. He left Deep Abyss
Knight’s body. Ordinary creatures could only see a purple bone
armor rise to the sky. They could not see the purple bone armor
with the god spirit Sky Armor God. “Dollar, this is not over yet,”
Sky Armor God angrily said to Han Sen. He sent the god personality
back to Sky Armor God’s temple.</p>
<p>After the god spirit and god personality combined with the
creatures in the universe, they could not just separate again. He
forced it to separate. Because of that, he was damaged. He could no
longer fight. One could have said he was in a bad situation. It was
worse than when Knife King stole his rib bone.</p>
<p>Without a universe god body, he could not do anything to the
creatures of the universe. Therefore, there was no point in him
staying any longer. “It is not over yet,” Han Sen coldly said.
“Only one of us will live.”</p>
<p>“It will not happen to you,” Sky Armor God coldly grunted. He
ignored Han Sen. He just wanted to return to Sky Armor God
Temple.</p>
<p>He was no longer able to attack creatures in the universe, but
creatures of the universe could not damage him. Thus, Sky Armor God
was not worried Han Sen could hurt him.</p>
<p>“Dollar, I am going to make you unable to die or live.” Sky
Armor God was madly cursing him. He was forced to separate from his
universe god body. The damage he incurred was worse than when Knife
King stole his rib bone.</p>
<p>Upon thinking of that, Sky Armor God, menacingly looked at Han
Sen. He was instantly shocked. Han Sen’s body had a giant, green
god spirit. It was holding Sky Radish God Lance. It came before
him.</p>
<p>“Sky Vine Radish… No!” Sky Armor God screamed, but he could only
shout no. The big green god spirit clutched the Sky Radish God
Lance to break his spirit body. The god personality fell. Han Sen
took it.</p>
<p>“God spirit hunted. Found god spirit gene.”</p>
<p>Other creatures were unable to see Sky Armor God and Sky Vine
Radish. After seeing Han Sen judge Deep Abyss Knife, a purple bone
armor rose from Deep Abyss Knight’s body. It looked like Han Sen
threw the green lance and purple bone armor fell from the sky.</p>
