<p>“I can’t even see a graveyard nearby. What important person died
and is going to be buried here? Are they going to scatter the ashes
into the ocean, maybe? Like a burial at sea?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>To be entirely honest, Han Sen didn’t actually believe Miss
Mirror’s claim. But with so many elites having shown up, something
big had to have been going down.</p>
<p>The elites of the other races were all terrified of Miss Mirror.
None dared to get close to her.</p>
<p>Most of them milling around near the sea, though. They were all
waiting for something to occur, just as Miss Mirror was.</p>
<p>But after a few days went by, nothing actually happened. Han Sen
saw no evidence of the funeral that Miss Mirror had claimed would
take place.</p>
<p>It had been six days by this point, and now, after all this
time, Han Sen couldn’t but ask a question. “Miss Mirror, has the
funeral not begun?”</p>
<p>Miss Mirror was being taken care of by her servants in the
meantime, as if she was on vacation. She had nice food to enjoy,
and people served her everything. They almost moved a bathtub there
for her. She was living in what was practically splendor. Han Sen
and the blood kirin, on the other hand, hadn’t had a bite to eat
over that entire length of time. Han Sen had reached the point
where he could survive on the sustenance provided by absorbing
universal energies, so while he would be fine, it was still pretty
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Why are you in such a rush? He isn’t dead yet,” Miss Mirror
responded carelessly.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes widened, and he thought to himself, “They’re
planning a funeral for someone who hasn’t yet died? And so many
people are already here. Aren’t they the ones in a rush? If the
dying guy knew about this, he’d probably be so angry that he’d have
a heart attack and die immediately.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this was a very strange scenario, but Miss
Mirror seemed unwilling to answer any other questions. So, there
was nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p>“Miss Mirror, can I walk around? I am hungry, and I want some
food to eat. Do not worry, I will not go far.” Han Sen looked at
Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>“You can go anywhere you wish. Just make sure you return before
the funeral.” Han Sen hadn’t expected Miss Mirror to agree so
simply. It was a quick response, as if she really had no desire to
keep him imprisoned.</p>
<p>“Thank you, madam.” Han Sen turned around and abandoned the
peak. After a while, he turned back to take a look. Miss Mirror
wasn’t watching him, and she hadn’t sent anyone to keep tabs on
him. It seemed as if she really did not care.</p>
<p>“Does she know that I won’t run off?” Han Sen thought that Miss
Mirror was a very strange woman. He wasn’t going to dare trying to
escape. He couldn’t allow himself to run until he had retrieved
Bao’er, at the very least.</p>
<p>After leaving the peak, Han Sen soon found that many elites from
all sorts of races were present. Many of the races he saw were ones
he had never seen before. After looking a little further, he found
that a temporary market had been established.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt relief well up in his heart, and he took off flying
to the market immediately. There were many races occupying the
various stalls. Lots of vendors had positioned themselves near the
sea, many of them selling all sorts of xenogeneic items.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of levels, too. Some of the people around
him looked like Viscounts or Barons, some looked like Kings, and
some were of a capacity Han Sen couldn’t even identify. Those were
very scary.</p>
<p>Again, he noticed that all the creatures there had water element
powers.</p>
<p>“This surely cannot be a coincidence. Is something going to
happen here that is associated with water powers? I already have
that Original Water King Body. Is that why Miss Mirror has brought
me here?” That didn’t seem right, though. Captain Water Moon was a
deified water elite. If this was an important opportunity for
water-users, Miss Mirror wouldn’t have needed to bring a fraudulent
prince there.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked into the market. There were so many people and
creatures there, so he figured it would be easy to collect some
info. Everyone was talking to the vendors, after all.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked around and watched the crowds before squatting
down in front of a stall. He didn’t choose the stall because of its
wares, but because the stall’s owner was low level. He could be
bullied. Plus, it was one of the Kate. Therefore, in the
consideration of other races, he was practically a nobody. His
stall was in a corner and barely even noticeable.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen wanted to bully him. It would be faster to
get info out of him through doing that than by being pleasant.</p>
<p>“Big Brother, what I sell are true water xenogeneic treasures.
What would you like?” The Kate Baron smiled, introducing his
unremarkable wares with genuine enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Who is your big brother?” Han Sen put on a dour expression.</p>
<p>“Oh… I am sorry, Hot Man,” the Kate Baron said quickly.</p>
<p>“That’s more like it.” Han Sen nodded, but inside, he thought,
“No, I am here to play the bad guy. I should be called a boss.”</p>
<p>Pretending to be evil didn’t suit Han Sen very well, so he gave
up the act. He pulled out a Viscount dagger and held it before the
Baron. He said, “Do you know what this is?”</p>
<p>“Handsome, I’m sorry! We do small business here. We only sell,
and we do not buy. What about over there? That guy is so rich, he
is sure to give you a high price.” The owner looked fairly
glum.</p>
<p>“Who said I am trying to sell you something? Look at me. Do I
look broke enough to sell my goods to someone like you?” Han Sen
tossed the dagger down in front of the owner and spoke with a rich
tone of voice. “Answer my questions and this can be yours.”</p>
<p>“You are here for information? You could have just told me that
sooner.” The owner put the dagger into his pocket, patted his
chest, and said, “Ask me anything, handsome. Nothing goes on here
that I don’t know about.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t think the man’s information was going to be very
reliable. For a Baron, he was talking a big game. He didn’t look
worried about giving away something that he shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen wasn’t hoping to learn any secrets. He just
needed answers to some simple questions.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Han Sen asked, looking around.</p>
<p>“Handsome, don’t you see? I’m here trying to earn money!” Alang
laughed.</p>
<p>“Be serious; who cares if you earn money. I’m asking what
everyone is doing here, on this planet!” Han Sen stared at Alang,
already regretting asking the man for information. He was
useless.</p>
<p>Alang looked as if he had woken from a dream, and he said, “Ah,
you are asking about that? Why are you asking this? Aren’t you here
for the same thing? Here to watch the Ancient Water God?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. There were stories of Water Gods in
various races, but this one was special. And it was approved by the
universe. Han Sen thought he had heard that this was a member of
the Ancient God race.</p>
<p>“Is the funeral Miss Mirror mentioned the Ancient Water God’s
funeral? No way. The legends of the Ancient Gods say that they are
all born deified. And they live so long, with a lifespan of a
billion years. It is rare to see one of the Ancient Gods dying,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
