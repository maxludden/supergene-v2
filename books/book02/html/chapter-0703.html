    <p>
      Fang Mingquan entered the battle arena from the shelter and found his
      seat. He looked to the center of the arena, waiting for Divinity&#8217;s
      Bout to begin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Fang Mingquan was in a royal shelter that had half a million
      people in it, the arena itself could seat very few.
    </p>

    <p>
      The humans in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary were not very enthusiastic
      about Divinity&#8217;s Bout. The primary focus of humans when it came to
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout was on the holy battles that took place between
      humans in their own shelters, so that they could see who was the best. But
      when it came to the actual Divinity&#8217;s Bout, interest quickly waned.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of humans would choose to concede following their qualification, as
      the battles to come were of life and death. If their opponents were
      powerful spirits, they were often ruthless; humans could only live once,
      and they couldn&#8217;t afford to squander their lives in battles they
      would most likely lose.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the deaths of human fighters was a frequent tragedy in
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout, as spirits showed no mercy in the brutality of
      their combat. As such, the entire event wasn&#8217;t something friendly
      and well-suited to humanity&#8217;s participation. Viewership of
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout was low, in stark contrast to its prominence in the
      First God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the media paid little attention to the events of Divinity&#8217;s
      Bout. After all, there had not been a single human Son of God yet, and
      they had no desire to spend time and resources reporting the victories of
      spirits. A simple list of names usually sufficed.
    </p>

    <p>
      People who did take the time to watch Divinity&#8217;s Bout were the
      higher-ups of the bigger factions of the Alliance. They were the sort of
      people that could take down spirit shelters, so observing the spirits that
      participated in Divinity&#8217;s Bout allowed them to collect intelligence
      on how to one-day face the spirits of shelters that had yet to be
      conquered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan was watching Divinity&#8217;s Bout in the hope that Dollar
      would be there. Dollar was in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, and it was
      likely an accomplished fighter such as he would be willing to participate.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, he didn&#8217;t have much hope. Dollar had only been in
      the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary for a short period of time. No matter his
      strength, the spirits were likely to dwarf any hopeful competitor. It was
      like that for any human who wished to test their mettle there.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fang Mingquan?&#8221; Fang Mingquan, waiting for the match to
      begin, heard his name called out from behind. He turned his head to the
      sight of someone he knew.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Hua?&#8221; Fang Mingquan quickly walked over and shook his
      hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mister Hua&#8217;s full name was Hua Ping. He had been in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary for a hundred years. He was one of the earliest
      evolvers. He now worked in the media, as well, and was a supervisor to
      Fang Mingquan.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are interested in Divinity&#8217;s Bout?&#8221; Hua Ping looked
      on Fang Mingquan with modest surprise. Fang Mingquan was the most
      well-known commentator in the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact that no one could record videos or take pictures of the
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout was the source of his surprise. If he wished to make
      reports or commentate, it would all have to be spoken or written. It
      didn&#8217;t make for entertaining reading or listening, either, due to
      the misery and losses that would make up every single report. This was
      another factor in its lack of prominence in the media.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am interested, yes. That is why I have come to watch. Old Hua,
      have you come here to report on Divinity&#8217;s Bout, as well?&#8221;
      Fang Mingquan asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Old Hua smiled and said in response, &#8220;Once every ten years, I do it.
      This is the thirteenth article I will have done in regards to
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout. Few people read them, so it is not likely many
      would know of this work.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If it&#8217;s that bad, why do you still insist on doing it?&#8221;
      Fang Mingquan asked, with visible confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Doing a show that no one paid heed to tended to go against the principles
      of someone in the media.
    </p>

    <p>
      For an old supervisor to insist on doing a show every tenth year on
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout was quite surprising.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Viewership figures are important, I must confess. But as a man of
      the media, I believe in reporting things that are meaningful for the
      progression of the human race. Humans don&#8217;t do well in
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout, that is true; but there are glimmers of inspiration
      and awe to be found. Talented people come here, every tenth year, in the
      hopes of securing honor and glory for humanity. Regardless of whether they
      win or lose, they are selfless heroes.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Old Hua sighed and then continued to say, &#8220;But now, I fear glory has
      taken a grander prominence in the hearts of men. Only victory and success
      define a person&#8217;s worth these days. Humans who fail are disdained,
      and that is something no person can bear. I make records of these battles
      so future competitors of Divinity&#8217;s Bout can learn something.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan saluted him. A media man with such values and integrity was
      rare, and even Fang Mingquan himself wasn&#8217;t sure he could do the
      same. Fang Mingquan was ordinary and didn&#8217;t harbor much
      sentimentality; he never really thought of things that way. Yet despite
      that, it didn&#8217;t stop him from admiring the grace of his peer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two of them chatted, waiting for the fight to start. The arena could
      house one hundred thousand spectators, but only a few thousand had come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other human shelters were like this, as well. Aside from the fighters, and
      important figures and officials of the Alliance&#8217;s greater
      organizations, humans weren&#8217;t likely to come and watch a fight that
      would most likely result in defeat for their entire race.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those who claimed victory would receive their time in the limelight, but
      the same could not be said for those who, despite significant effort and
      diligence, could not find the success they clamored for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans adored heroes, but they often failed to realize that it was the
      past failures of the heroes that resulted in their own victories further
      down the line. In the legends of heroes, failures did not matter. They
      were small and insignificant in the grander scheme of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout was soon to begin. Those who had placed first in the
      shelters of humans and spirits were now drawn into the battle arena.
    </p>

    <p>
      The arena was massive, and there were many smaller arenas separated neatly
      alongside each other, making it possible for a thousand fights to go on at
      the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans and spirits were put apart, not allowed to have contact with each
      other. This was to avoid conflict outside of the organized battles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because so many humans and spirits were taking part in the event, it was
      difficult to find a specific person. Fang Mingquan perused the list of
      participants intently, in the hopes of finding Dollar there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping, who was beside him, used a pen to record something. His face was
      very serious.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He really is here!&#8221; Fang Mingquan blurted out when he found
      Dollar&#8217;s name on the list of battlers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping looked confused. He turned his head to look at Fang Mingquan and
      asked, &#8220;You have a friend who has joined Divinity&#8217;s
      Bout?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Fang Mingquan responded with great enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>
      Although he had never met Dollar, or even exchanged words with him, he
      cherished him as a good friend in his heart. He considered him his best
      friend, as a matter of fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      He could not describe this feeling succinctly, but it was how he felt,
      regardless.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is the number of your friend&#8217;s battleground? Let me see
      if he&#8217;s going up against a spirit,&#8221; Hua Ping said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang Mingquan quickly gave him the number. Hua Ping was an expert, so
      he&#8217;d be able to tell him quickly what Dollar was about to go up
      against.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollar and Black-Gold; your friend is unlucky, it would seem. He
      has encountered a spirit in his very first match. Black-Gold is a very
      powerful royal spirit. He has armor that is nigh impenetrable. Even
      sacred-blood class weapons have great difficulty dealing damage to
      it,&#8221; Hua Ping said, as he looked.
