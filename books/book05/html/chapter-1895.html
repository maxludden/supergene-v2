<h2>Red Mist Spring</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1895</h3>

<p>Han Sen quickly fell back as Black Cliff roared. His body was on
fire, and he leaped towards Han Sen like a beast. He was shouting,
“Knife Blank! My Knife Blank!”</p>
<p>In that precise moment, the meeting room was blown up by the
power unleashed by Black Cliff. His Duke powers were scary to
witness.</p>
<p>Many people heard the commotion and came rushing toward them.
Han Sen shouted, “Please stay away! Run, as far as you are able
to!”</p>
<p>Han Sen held onto the Knife Blank and also ran. The rabbit shoes
were on his feet, and he headed out of the base.</p>
<p>Black Cliff was like a hungry beast as he ravenously pursued Han
Sen. He summoned a big black hammer and swung it forward. The fire
was like a living thing as it tore a big hole in the ground. The
nearby houses were being smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>Luckily, the rabbit shoes made Han Sen just as fast as Black
Cliff. Han Sen made it out of the base, but he hadn’t gained enough
of a lead to lose Black Cliff.</p>
<p>Black Cliff ran like a lunatic. He kept trying to smack Han Sen
with the hammer. He wanted to smash Han Sen into nothing but bits
and take the Knife Blank for himself.</p>
<p>“King Jun, that *sshole! He is so obscene.” Han Sen knew that
Black Cliff was not himself. The fire in his eyes was growing
brighter, and he attacked without holding back.</p>
<p>It was fortunate Han Sen had the rabbit shoes; otherwise, he’d
be mush right now.</p>
<p>“Zero, contact Queen!” Han Sen shouted as he kept running. He
was running towards the mountains, leading Black Cliff away from
the base so he wouldn’t inadvertently destroy it.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t lose him, but he used his Dongxuan Movements to
dodge each attack. He kept evading as he led the raging Rebate
towards the Red Mist Valley.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not fight Black Cliff. He needed Yisha to help,
but god only knew how long it would take her to get here. So, he
needed to find a way to buy himself some time. It’d be bad to
suffer even a single strike.</p>
<p>A random Duke class hit could be enough to break him to
pieces.</p>
<p>Han Sen guided Black Cliff towards the red mist, and in the
meantime, Zero got in touch with Yisha. Yisha had the time to see
her message.</p>
<p>“What? This has really happened? Black Cliff did this?” After
Yisha heard Zero explain the matters at hand, she frowned.</p>
<p>She could not believe he was willing to do such a thing.</p>
<p>But it was Han Sen’s subordinate that had contacted her, and she
knew Zero wouldn’t lie. Yisha went quiet and quickly left for
Planet Eclipse. She was soon at the base.</p>
<p>“Where are Black Cliff and Han Sen?” Yisha asked with a
frown.</p>
<p>“Master was getting chased. He was leading the enemy off that
way!” Zero pointed to Red Mist Valley.</p>
<p>Yisha did not delay. Like an act of teleportation, she instantly
disappeared.</p>
<p>Yisha was in a major rush right now. If what Zero had told her
was true, then there was a Duke chasing after Han Sen. It was
difficult to gauge how long Han Sen might last in such a pursuit.
He could have been whacked into jelly by now, already.</p>
<p>Yisha scanned the valley ahead, and what she saw shocked
her.</p>
<p>Han Sen was sitting on a rock outside the valley, singing.</p>
<p>“Where is Black Cliff?” Yisha asked as she ran up to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“In that valley,” Han Sen said, as he pointed down into it.</p>
<p>Han Sen had drawn Black Cliff into the valley, and his pursuer
had gotten lost in there. Han Sen was able to get back out and wait
for Yisha’s arrival. Black Cliff was still down there.</p>
<p>Yisha looked into the valley with much confusion. Her face
changed and she said, “A Red Mist Spring?”</p>
<p>“Do you know what it is?” Han Sen asked Yisha.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at the red mist plaguing the valley and said, “It
is a Red Mist Spring. I don’t know if it is good for you or bad for
you, though.”</p>
<p>“What is a Red Mist Spring?” Han Sen felt a chill hearing this,
but he asked her for more info.</p>
<p>They had been in the valley searching for quite some time, last
time they were there. There didn’t seem to be anything useful
inside. They couldn’t find what was causing the mist, either. Even
if there was a treasure, it seemed unlikely they could find it.</p>
<p>Now hearing Yisha say this, it sounded as if it might not have
been treasure that was inside there. It might have actually been
something harmful.</p>
<p>Just as Yisha was about to answer, Black Cliff came out of the
clouds with a big hammer. After seeing Han Sen, he roared and swung
towards him.</p>
<p>Yisha frowned. She could tell something was wrong with him, and
she knew he wouldn’t behave like that in front of her.</p>
<p>She waved her hand and a purple mist came out. It cracked Black
Cliff’s big hammer in an instant.</p>
<p>Black Cliff coughed up some blood. The hammer was his geno
armament, and as soon as Yisha broke it, harm was delivered to his
body. But even so, he still wanted to go after Han Sen and Han Sen
alone. He was acting like a man possessed.</p>
<p>Yisha then hit Black Cliff himself with the purple mist. She
didn’t want to kill him, though. All she wanted to do was knock him
out.</p>
<p>“We cannot let others learn about this spring. I will discuss
this with you when I return.” Yisha told Han Sen that, then picked
up the unconscious Black Cliff. After that, she warped away.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to the base. After what happened with Black
Cliff, he knew he’d have to be more careful. King Jun was able to
use Black Cliff to come after him, so it was clear he could assume
the form of other people to get to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Having an association with a god is a bad thing, indeed. They
are so powerful, but they won’t kill directly. Why is that? Maybe
if I find out why, I can kill King Jun.” Han Sen retreated into
thought.</p>
<p>When it was nighttime, Han Sen sought rest. When he turned
around, he saw Yisha standing right there. She had been behind him,
and her sudden presence there scared him.</p>
<p>“Queen, when did you get here?” Han Sen blinked.</p>
<p>Yisha smiled and said, “I just wanted to take a look at you. I
almost don’t recognize you.”</p>
<p>“Why? Why would you not recognize your student?” Han Sen
smiled.</p>
<p>“Under the threat of Black Cliffs pursuit, you managed to run so
far and so fast without sustaining any damage. I don’t even think a
Marquise could do such a thing.” Yisha squinted her eyes as she
spoke.</p>
<p>“You know, I have shoes that can give me speed. I’m weak in
other talents, so I guess I’m just good when it comes to being
speedy. These take me up to around Duke class, I think.” Han Sen
said that, and then used his rabbit shoes to walk three meters.</p>
<p>That is a good item. It gives Barons the speed of a Duke. That
is very rare. It is better than your holy item, even.” Yisha looked
at the rabbit shoes as she spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt strange, all of a sudden. He was afraid Yisha might
want to try them on. They were a beast soul, and Yisha couldn’t use
them because she was not from the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she was not interested in the rabbit shoes. She
thought of something else and said, “Do you know what the Red Mist
Spring is?”</p>
