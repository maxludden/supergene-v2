<h3>Chapter 1856</h3>

<p>Han Sen’s body was flashing in the air. When he struck the giant
egg, Captain Wood was completely shocked.</p>
<p>“A speed like that, and a knifemind like that… How… Is his Teeth
knifemind as good as the Queen’s? What is this…? Isn’t he just a
Baron?”</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife came against the giant egg, making it swing in
the air like a tumbler.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel the life inside it. Ghost Teeth and Han Sen’s
knifemind had definitely damaged whatever creature resided inside.
It had been a hearty blow to whatever was within.</p>
<p>After the egg was injured, the gold fire it used took on the
shape of a fiery bird. It chased after Han Sen wildly, but Han Sen
still had his Teeth Rabbit shoes. He could still move much faster
than that fiery bird, and it couldn’t even singe him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, though, a gold flame rose in the air like a blooming
flower. The gold fire started to peel, as a handsome man revealed
himself from the flickering lights. The man looked holy, like a god
of some sort.</p>
<p>“Han Sen; killing the Raven will not benefit you. If you let him
go, I can promise you three things,” the godlike man in the air
quietly told Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Is this Skygod’s true form?” Captain Wood was shocked again. He
didn’t think Skygod could leave the purple-bronze hall. He hadn’t
expected the elusive figure to show up outside the hall, and in
another form as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored the golden man, though. He still thrashed the
egg, making it rumble and rock even more.</p>
<p>“I can erase the marks you all possess, and performing three
services,” the man that was clad in gold clothes went on to</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on hitting the egg, though. Eventually, there was a
noise, and it prompted the egg to fall down and hit the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen jumped down next to it, with his Ghost Teeth Knife
rampaging like a beast. It kept on hitting the egg, until a strange
noise started to sound from inside it. It was like the sound of
something crying.</p>
<p>“Enough!” The gold-clothed man’s face changed now, and he gave
the command coldly.</p>
<p>Golden fire rained down like water, covering the world. The
gold-clothed man was in the air, staring down at Han Sen, asserting
himself like some sort of deity. And then, he said, “I broke my own
rules today, by letting you leave with your life. You figured out
that I am just a being who uses illusions.”</p>
<p>After the voice, the gold flame turned the palace into a realm
of lava. The gold fire became a monstrous entity, as dragons formed
of fire stormed through the air around them. It was like the whole
world was on that man’s side.</p>
<p>With that display of power, Wood Duke wanted to immediately
kowtow to the gold man. Han Sen stood defiantly, though, ignoring
him. He kept on slashing the egg, making the crying sound sing even
louder. The egg was beginning to get webbed with cracks.</p>
<p>The gold-clothed man was furious at this point, and the dragon
and fire-beasts heard his rage. They raced down towards Han Sen,
igniting the atmosphere with all sorts of fire.</p>
<p>Han Sen was like an ant before a flood. It seemed as if those
monstrous fires would have no trouble in destroying him.</p>
<p>A lot of those fiery beasts roared at Han Sen, with tongues of
flame lashing the air. They almost managed to get Han Sen. But
instead, they hit the ground and made the earth itself melt.</p>
<p>Han Sen still showed no concern with them, and he kept on
striking the egg. The egg made even more noise now, and even more
cracks began to show across its form.</p>
<p>Captain Wood and Black Steel were utterly gobsmacked as they
witnessed all this. It was difficult to believe Han Sen was able to
withstand the madness around him and continue attacking the egg. A
Duke like Captain Wood would have been a shivering mess on the
floor if he was faced with such outstanding pressure.</p>
<p>“How do I make you stop?” The godly-looking man’s eyes burned
with fire. His face was completely twisted.</p>
<p>The answer he received was delivered by the Ghost Teeth Knife,
though. Han Sen was acting as if he was completely oblivious to
everything except his enemy. Clutching the knife tight, he kept
wailing against the egg.</p>
<p>Eventually, the black egg could not withstand the might, and it
cracked deeply. A lava-like juice began to seep from the
crevice.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, if you hit this thing one more time, I will make your
entire race suffer!” the gold-robed man bellowed. Katcha!</p>
<p>Again, it was only the knife and the sound of a breaking egg
that answered him.</p>
<p>The egg was suffering with even more cracks now. The purple mist
of the blade came against the egg as a golden juice started to flow
out like blood.</p>
<p>“I, King Jun, swear to god; I will reduce your entire race to
their primitive days of sticks and stones. The entire intelligence
of your race will be reduced to a level that will only allow you to
eat meat,” the gold-robed man spat.</p>
<p>The entire mountain began to rock and rumble, with the noise of
what sounded like thunder. Clouds formed in the sky, and they
swirled as they cast a rain of blood. It was like his vow had been
answered.</p>
<p>There was a lot of thunder, like a lashing punishment from some
great god. The rivers of blood that were forming, alongside the
gold fires, made the mountain look like the result of an ensuing
apocalypse.</p>
<p>A bolt of lightning exploded right next to Han Sen. The fire
beasts roared into his ears, but even so, Han Sen showed no care or
concern. Without a single moment of hesitation, his grip on his
knife remained firm.</p>
<p>Slash after slash, Ghost Teeth Knife struck the egg like mad.
The egg was covered in marks, and the flow of the lavalike blood
increased. It was all over the place, along with the purple mist.
It was pretty creepy.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and Little Silver had the mark on
their heads. Little Angel back at base might have had it, too. And
that godlike figure that called himself King Jun did not seem like
the trustworthy sort. All the creatures that had made a wish with
him had met a grizzly end.</p>
<p>The only way to erase the mark now, Han Sen figured, was to
destroy the Raven egg. There wasn’t any other way. Han Sen knew
that King Jun God was limited by some sort of power, and that was
why the powerful being could not fight him directly.</p>
<p>Still, Han Sen believed that what he was doing now would yield
the best results.</p>
<p>The dragon-shaped thunder exploded next to Han Sen.</p>
<p>The rain of blood soaked Han Sen.</p>
<p>The fiery beasts and King Jun’s roars were like curses being
chanted from the pits of hell.</p>
<p>But despite all that, nothing could stop Han Sen’s Ghost Teeth
Knife.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>An unknown number of slashes later, the egg cracked open,
shattering into pieces. The lava-like juices cascaded out, flooding
its proximity.</p>
