<h2>God Pulse Weird Scene</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3042</h3>

<p>Han Sen’s power was nothing Mister Yang could compete with. He
tried to control his own power, but it was similar to a digging
machine. The little shovel was really fast as it dug out a trench.
The purple liquid inside the trench was funneled out.</p>
<p>It was weird. It was unknown what the purple liquid was. After
it was drained, it immediately vaporized not long after it flowed
away.</p>
<p>Smoke arose around the dig site. It was blown away by the winds
that scoured the fields.</p>
<p>Mister Yang did not dare get close, but he really did not dare
leave either. He stopped and watched the sight from afar. He just
prayed nothing bad happened to Han Sen.</p>
<p>It was fine for Han Sen to die, but without Han Sen’s
protection, he would be in grave trouble.</p>
<p>There was every chance Peaceful was still looking for him, and
Shibo’s family might not be so forgiving of him either.</p>
<p>“What kind of crime did I commit in my last life to meet this
goddamned thing I’ve following around right now?” Mister Yang’s
heart was wrought with sadness.</p>
<p>Han Sen dug a trench and drained the water, but the purple
spring’s liquid was still coming out. It was not slowing down
either. He had to jump into the water to start digging. Mister Yang
watched Han Sen dive into the spring water. It made his face fill
with black lines. His eyes kept twitching as he said, “Death wish…
This guy has a death wish…”</p>
<p>Han Sen stood inside the spring water. He felt that the purple
spring water was a bit cool. It was like he had been rubbed with
alcohol.</p>
<p>Still, that thing vaporized faster than alcohol did. Although
the purple liquid kept coming out, it did not create a lot of
water. Han Sen was still inside the hole. It did not even surpass
his knees.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Mister Yang had not departed and was instead just
watching from afar. He shouted at him, “Old Yang, how deep is the
gene egg?”</p>
<p>Earlier, Mister Yang had said the gene egg was very weak before
it hatched. He was worried about whether or not he had broken the
gene egg.</p>
<p>Mister Yang’s eyes twitched. He answered, “From my previous
estimation, it should only be half a foot away. If there is an evil
spirit spring down there, what I predicted must be wrong. It is
hard to calculate its depth. It will not be any further than nine
feet though.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard Mister Yang say that, he plunged his shovel
into the spring. It went into the soil. A scary power went with it.
He slashed a nine-foot-deep trench inside the hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not able to use his Dongxuan Aura, so he could not
scan what was down there. He still had the power to control things
and cut a hole in the ground that was nine feet deep. He should
have been able to measure that right.</p>
<p>When the big trench was cut out, the evil spirit spring, which
was only as thick as a baby’s arm, suddenly burst open like a
volcano erupting. It was 30 feet high and made Han Sen all wet.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Mister Yang was far away. He watched the spring water explode.
He saw a purple light shadow arise. It was blurry, but it looked
like a scary big beast. The big beast’s light shadow roared and
turned into purple air that disappeared into space. It was like the
night in the sky was dyed purple.</p>
<p>“This is… This is… God pulse weird scene… Ancient evil beast…”
Mister Yang was so shocked that he fell on his bottom. His eyes
opened wide. He started at the space as if he had just seen a
ghost.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the weird scene flash in front of him. He also heard
a beast roar, but he did not care much about that.</p>
<p>Earlier, the evil spirit spring water exploded. It was like it
exhausted the remainder of the purple water. Now, there was no
longer any more liquid. It quickly died down and stopped spilling.
The purple liquid that spilled out earlier was quickly vaporized.
Within a few seconds, there was no more liquid on the floor. There
was some purple air surrounding him. It was like it was there, but
it was not there. After the sun shined on it, though, it was
gone.</p>
<p>He dug three feet and felt like the things he touched with his
fingers were different. He felt happy. “Maybe I have found it!”</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly used his hands to dig the soil. There was a
black metal object visible down below. He thought it was the gene
egg. As he kept on digging, he soon found out that it was not the
gene egg.</p>
<p>“What is this thing?” Han Sen was suspicious about the item he
unearthed.</p>
<p>Although he did not understand gene eggs, he knew that the thing
in front of him was not a gene egg. Whose gene egg would have grown
like a big stick?</p>
<p>The stuff in front of him was a black metal pillar. The pillar’s
top was about the size of a bowl. Han Sen dug down three feet. The
rest of it was still in the soil. He did not know how deep it
went.</p>
<p>The part that was showing looked black. It had some carvings
with languages and symbols Han Sen did not understand. It looked
like an iron pipe with lots of scripture scrawled upon it.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Mister Yang from far away and said, “Old Yang,
come and take a look at what this is. How did I dig up an iron pipe
at a land pulse?”</p>
<p>Mister Yang seemed to be really scared. When he heard what Han
Sen said, his body shook. He got up off the ground and ran over to
the trench. He bent down and looked.</p>
<p>After taking a look, Mister Yang’s face looked even paler. It
looked as if he had lost his soul. He mumbled, “It is over. It is
all over… We are in big trouble…”</p>
<p>“It looks like you know what this thing is. Since I’ve dug it
up, why don’t you go ahead and tell me what this thing is?” Han Sen
was getting very interested in the item.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a very curious person. If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t
have made it to where he was. Mister Yang looked as if the sky had
fallen on him. The more he became curious, the more he wanted to
figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder… It is no wonder I was not able to tell there
was an evil spirit spring here. This place has an item that can
suppress pulses. We have just suffered eight lifetimes of bad luck.
If I had known there was a pulse suppression item, I would have
never tried to dig up a gene egg here.” Mister Yang was regretful.
His belly started to churn.</p>
<p>“Old Yang, if you keep talking like that, I am going to stick
this iron pipe into your body.” Han Sen looked at Mister Yang with
an unfriendly look.</p>
<p>Although he was polite, he did not like people talking like
that. He had encountered too many overly scared people.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen’s cold eyes, Mister Yang felt a chill come on. He
quickly said, “Please do not mind me, Mister. It was me talking a
bit excitedly. This iron pipe should be a pulse suppression item.
The elites use it to suppress land pulses.”</p>
<p>“Why do they suppress land pulses?” Seeing Mister Yang finally
start talking, Han Sen’s expression looked a bit friendlier. Mister
Yang sighed and said, “The land pulse has a very evil gene race.
When the elites found it, they did not want the gene race in the
land pulse to ever be born. Of course, they did not have the power
to destroy it. Therefore, they used an item to suppress the land
pulse and ensure no one else would come to make the gene race be
born.”</p>
