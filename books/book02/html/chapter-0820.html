      Ji Yanran told Ji Ruozhen about the shura liquid, and he took it for the
      serious, concerning matter that it was. Ji Ruozhen asked Han Sen to tell
      him about the liquid again, then retrieved the sample on the very same
      day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ji family was taking the entire affair more seriously than Han Sen
      believed they would. He hoped they could successfully research it, because
      if they could not, the Zhao family&#8217;s capabilities would shock the
      entire Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because Han Sen was getting ready to join the shura ball, he didn&#8217;t
      have time to return to the sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran began to describe the members of the group of shura that were
      coming, presenting him with pictures so he knew exactly who each one was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There are two royal families of shura coming. One of the royal
      family members is a fourth-rank shura fighter, and he is the one
      spearheading the entire collective that will be visiting. He isn&#8217;t a
      person to easily lose his temper, but even if he does, others will be the
      ones to take care of it. It&#8217;s not up to us to sort that out.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, Ji Yanran showed him a different picture. It was a picture of
      a young, handsome shura. He had a purple horn, and long purple hair. He
      looked both noble and mystic.
    </p>

    <p>It was difficult to find humans that could compare with him.</p>

    <p>
      The society of the shura was built on authority. It had existed far longer
      than humanity had. The royal monarchy had been established over many
      generations, and was something no human family could ever come close to
      resembling.
    </p>

    <p>
      When humanity first began its Interstellar Era, the shura provided them
      with aid because of their similar appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back then, the shura considered humanity to be inferior. Humans were not
      as technologically advanced, or as attractive, in their eyes. But they
      never expected that humanity would grow and achieve so much so quickly, or
      one day become their greatest enemy and threat.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, humans were ahead of the shura. The race of the shura was now in
      political turmoil because of their inability to assert a new king for the
      throne, and had to broker a peace.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the shura had always been arrogant, and they had never really
      respected humanity. Despite their advancement, the shura still considered
      humans to be an inferior species.
    </p>

    <p>
      The royal shura had always been a higher class, and every person in their
      society had to adore them. Human society did not work like that, and it
      was just another reason for the royals to despise their enemies.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This royal shura is called Yu Qieland. He is twenty-two years old
      and is a very notorious member of the Yu family. Our intel states that
      when the shura reach adulthood, their fitness level is gauged to be at
      around two hundred. If they continue to train and learn their shura
      skills, they can become even stronger. Yu Qielan&#8217;s fitness is
      estimated to be at around two hundred-sixty. That&#8217;s not a precise
      number, but it&#8217;s an educated approximation from our best
      information.&#8221; Ji Yanran introduced the man.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He sounds rather powerful, but there should be many human
      surpassers that are around twenty years old. Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier
      for you to just call upon a surpasser?&#8221; Han Sen asked, with visible
      confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans were able to enter the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary when they
      reached the age of sixteen. If they were lucky, they&#8217;d end up in a
      grand, populated shelter which offered much help from the larger factions.
      This saved people much time in collecting enough geno points to reach the
      Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary. The same thing applied in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary to becoming a surpasser.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although this did not happen very often, there were many people entering
      at all times, so a good number did end up being this fortuitous.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, yes. There are indeed plenty of fortunate young people that
      are surpassers. And although we are able to call upon them, the royal
      shura might not want to interact with them.&#8221; Ji Yanran gave a wry
      smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why? Aren&#8217;t they just as young?&#8221; Han Sen asked with
      surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Their identities would be different.&#8221; Ji Yanran then went on
      to explain, &#8220;In the eyes of the shura, humanity is considered a
      knock-off of their own kind. They wouldn&#8217;t say that in front of us,
      but deep-down they disdain us. If Yu Qielan wishes to fight, then he would
      most certainly call upon someone famous. If he wants someone to fight, he
      would most likely pick me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why?&#8221; Han Sen was becoming even more confused. Ji Yanran was
      not very popular in the Alliance, at all. She may have been the daughter
      of the president, but she wasn&#8217;t much of a fighter.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the way normal human logic worked in the Alliance, no one would
      challenge her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran laughed and said, &#8220;The shura think differently. To them,
      our president is the king. As the daughter, that would make me the
      princess. He is a royal shura, and he would end up being forced to pick me
      for a duel as the only half-viable candidate.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The shura know much about our society. If they challenge me, it is
      not because they don&#8217;t know that I cannot fight—they would wish to
      humiliate us.&#8221; Ji Yanran took a deep breath and then continued,
      &#8220;My father asked that you come for insurance. If he asks me to
      fight, then I would need you to be my champion. You are my fiancé, after
      all.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t I be called a prince? The husband of a princess is
      called prince, if I recall,&#8221; Han Sen said with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was very interested in the shura because he wished to know whether Zero
      was a human or a shura. It was one of his biggest unsolved mysteries at
      this point.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he found Zero, he also found a vial of an unknown substance. Han Sen
      did not dare show it to anyone, as he wasn&#8217;t sure what it did. Not
      wanting to bring him or her any trouble, he placed it in his bank for
      security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen guessed that the liquid was most likely related to Zero, but he
      did not trust any research organization enough to turn it over for
      examination and testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, Han Sen was keen to meet real shura and see if he could notice
      a difference between them and Zero if they entered a &#8220;shura
      mode.&#8221; He thought he might learn something.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had no problem fighting a royal shura, as it was a glorious thing
      for him to be allowed to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, humanity and the shura had fought each other in this galaxy for
      many years, and countless victims had fallen victim to their hands.
      Influenced by their education and environment, it was natural for humans
      to consider shura as their greatest enemy. Any triumph over them would be
      most glorious.
