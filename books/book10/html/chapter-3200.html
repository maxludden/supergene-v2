<p>“Looking back and smiling, Bai Meisheng, the sixth palace has no
color…”</p>
<p>It was such a beautiful poem. The scene made people’s hearts
jump.</p>
<p>Now, Thousand Mile Reach had an old face. With his white beard
and hair, the expression he had made him appear exceptionally
pretty when he looked back.</p>
<p>They could see the corners of his eyes fly. His eyes looked as
if they were hooking onto someone. They were so sensual but with an
evil undertone.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Qin Bai, and the other people were given a chill. They
all strangely watched the scene in front of them. That was
especially true of Qin Bai. His impression of Thousand Mile Reach
was that he was a little cold but a very righteous person. He was
like an old bookworm. Qin Bai never dreamed he might have a face
that could display emotions like this. It drove him insane.</p>
<p>Seeing Thousand Mile Reach’s intoxicated eyes follow the twist
of his body as he turned around, he looked horny and slutty. That
horniness was cheaply displayed. It was like a stereotypical
example of whore.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Bao’er, Qin Bai, and Jia Shi Zhen stood together. With
their mouths agape, they watched Thousand Mile Reach twist his
ridiculous body. It appeared he was dancing.</p>
<p>If the dance was performed by a beautiful woman, everyone would
have enjoyed it or had some thoughts that could not be described.
But this was an old man twisting his hips as he danced. He was
doing all kinds of sexy and seductive movements. He even put his
legs out to stroke them. It was the sort of scene that made people
freeze in place. A chill ran down Jia Shi Zhen’s spine. Her stomach
churned. She now understood why Jian Bu Gu looked so strange
whenever he talked about the sword. “Teacher Jian said he was
beaten by this sword. Did he…” As Jia Shi Zhen thought about this
weird scene, it made her shiver.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking the same thing. He wanted to know what it
would be like if it was Jian Bu Gu dancing this way.</p>
<p>In the next second, something even more shocking happened.
Thousand Mile Reach kept dancing but started taking off his robes.
He was like some stripper trying to tease the audience. He threw
his robes at them.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others almost felt their jaws drop. They started
to duck and dive. No one wanted to touch those robes.</p>
<p>Qin Bai looked very weird. He wanted to laugh, but he did not
dare do so. His face was red. He was on the cusp of shouting, “Take
it off!”</p>
<p>He was shocked and surprised. It was hard to remember that
Thousand Mile Reach was the man who had been teaching him ever
since he was a child. Now, he had been reduced to behaving like
this.</p>
<p>As he watched, Qin Bai looked delighted. “How is Thousand Mile
Reach going to act all high and mighty toward me in the future?”
Jia Shi Zhen forced herself not to laugh and looked at Han Sen.
“Mister Han, what do we do now? Should we control Thousand Mile
Reach first?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach, who was dancing and
taking his clothes off. He was silent a moment before replying,
“This sword is not mysterious or evil. It is like Mister Jian said.
It is not dangerous. I suppose we shouldn’t do anything. We should
not invoke the anger of that sword. If we do that, things might get
worse.”</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen looked weird as she nodded. “Yes, I supposed Mister
Jian was right. I just don’t know how we are supposed to return
Thousand Mile Reach to normal.”</p>
<p>While the two of them were talking, Thousand Mile Reach had
already taken off all his clothes except for his white underwear.
He had revealed his leathery, dried skin.</p>
<p>He looked at Han Sen and the others. He put his foot on a stone
and winked at his audience. He stroked his old legs seductively. It
was a scene that made Han Sen and the others almost throw up.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Thousand Mile Reach looked as if he was having a
stroke. He instantly stopped where he was and did not move. His
eyes made it look like he had been possessed. It was like the off
switch had been flipped.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach’s eyes looked bright. He looked at Han Sen
and the others for a few seconds. He then let out a sob that could
shock the sky. When they heard it, that crying made others want to
cry. If a crying baby heard in the middle of the night, it would
stop crying.</p>
<p>A little while later, Thousand Mile Reach put his clothes back
on. His old face still kept turning green and white. He just stood
there. It was like he had received many hits to the face.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Jia Shi Zhen knew now was not the best time to talk
to Thousand Mile Reach, so they did not even attempt to comfort
him. If they comforted him now, it would be like throwing gasoline
on an open bonfire.</p>
<p>“Cough. Cough. Teacher Jia, why don’t you try and take the sword
too?” Han Sen suggested.</p>
<p>Qin Bai agreed. “Yes! Yes! Yes! Teacher Jia is so smart, you
might gain the approval of the sword.”</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen looked at them both, trying to feign innocence.
When she thought about doing the same things Thousand Mile Reach
did, it made her blush.</p>
<p>“These two men are so evil.” Jia Shi Zhen knew what the pair
were thinking, but she didn’t openly air her grievances. She
pretended nothing happened. She looked at Han Sen and said, “I and
Thousand Mile Reach are too similar. If Thousand Mile Reach cannot
succeed, then I cannot succeed either. But Mister Han, you can
teach Mister Crown Prince a sword mind in just two days. Your
sword-mind level must be the highest here. I earnestly believe you
have what it takes to claim the sword.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes! Yes!” Qin Bai squealed in support. “I think only you
can claim that sword.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt conflicted. The sword was old. If he had seen it
correctly, that sword had already broken the world. Otherwise, it
would not have been able to affect Thousand Mile Reach so
effectively and make him lose control of his body.</p>
<p>He believed it would be great to have a sword like that. If he
wanted to conquer a sword like that, he knew it was not going to be
easy.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Since I am here, I might as well give it a
shot. Plus, there is no suppression in this part of the universe.
No matter how strong it is, I should not end up losing control of
myself. He nodded and said, “OK, I will give it a go.”</p>
<p>“Mister Han, be wary of the power the sword holds,” Thousand
Mile Reach said as he stood tall, frosty, and stiff. “Ordinary
material power does not work on it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Teacher Thousand Mile Reach.” Han Sen was grateful
for the reminder. Being able to shirk his shame and remind Han Sen
of that showed just how much of an honorable elder Thousand Mile
Reach was.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about the way Thousand Mile Reach had acted. The
image he had built was quick to cave in on itself. He had to force
his face not to crack.</p>
<p>“One-inch thinking, then one-inch grey. Was that poem born with
the sword, or was it added to the sword later?” Han Sen walked in
front of the sword and thought about it.</p>
<p>Soldier Knife Sky’s weapons were made of two things. They were
all half weapon and half gene race. It was normal for them to have
words. They had seen many carvings and symbols across many of the
weapons in that land.</p>
<p>But those few words did not seem to match the feelings of the
sword itself. It led Han Sen to think maybe someone had engraved
the words onto it.</p>
