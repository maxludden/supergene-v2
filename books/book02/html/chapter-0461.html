    <p>
      Zheng Guoxiong watched Han Sen going in the middle of the mutant creatures
      with a complicated expression. Twenty years ago, he was as brave as Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      At that day and age when it was still difficult to hunt a sacred-blood
      creature, he used his diligence, talent, and special privileges coming
      from his family to max out his sacred geno points and evolved as a
      sacred-blood evolver in First God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after he entered Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, when he was about
      to realize all his dreams, he found out what a terrible place he ended up
      at.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no strong teammates or available beast souls. He needed to risk
      his life even when trying to kill a primitive creature. At the same time,
      he must avoid the spirit shelter and large groups of creatures at all
      times.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the beginning, Zheng Guoxiong still fought with some hope. Shortly, he
      discovered that it was almost impossible to max out on ordinary geno
      points in this place, let alone primitive geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      It did not mean that Zheng Guoxiong was not strong enough to kill an
      ordinary creature. He was capable of that, but there were only so many
      types of ordinary creatures. As he ate many of a type, that type no longer
      provided ordinary geno points for him. If he wanted to look for other
      ordinary creatures, he needed to go beyond the spirit shelter, which was
      something he could not achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was the same case for primitive creatures, which made Zheng Guoxiong
      feel desperate. There was no way he could continue to increase the
      ordinary and mutant geno points. And he was not able to kill a mutant
      creature. Zheng Guoxiong gave up hope completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he lost hope, he spent his days on nothing for twenty years. When Han
      Sen appeared, Zheng Guoxiong felt like he had seen himself twenty years
      ago, so confident, proud, and arrogant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subconsciously, Zheng Guoxiong tried to say no to Han Sen, like he did to
      his younger self. However, after Han Sen created one miracle after
      another, Zheng Guoxiong suddenly realized that he wished Han Sen success
      strongly in his heart, because he saw Han Sen as his younger self. He did
      not really want to lose or continue to be a loser. He wanted to see
      someone succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was why Zheng Guoxiong joined Goddess Gang. When a lot of people told
      him to leave, he still followed Han Sen to the spirit shelter. He only
      wanted to give Han Sen a chance. Maybe he wanted to give himself a chance.
      Maybe there was miracle in this world. And maybe, he could start over
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was forty years old. Maybe he was no longer young, but he was not old
      either. Zheng Guoxiong wanted to stand up again, to feel the urge to
      pursue something with all he got, and to go after his own dream.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I am not old yetâ€¦&#8221; Zheng Guoxiong told himself.</p>

    <p>
      Watching Han Sen throwing himself at the mutant creatures, Zheng Guoxiong
      felt he had gone back to the hot-blooded era, when he was still fearless.
    </p>

    <p>
      At that moment, Zheng Guoxiong deeply felt that his blood had not gone
      cold yet. His heart was still warm. He still wanted to go to the top of
      all mountains like a man.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill!&#8221; Zheng Guoxiong roared and wielded his broadsword at an
      incoming ice-armored beast, beheading the beast immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the roar from Zheng Guoxiong, Han Sen also charged the mutant
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      A red and golden fire bird spread its beautiful wings in the hall and
      brought a pretty aura to everyone&#8217;s beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      People found that the abilities of their beast souls were significantly
      enhanced, which made it much easier for them to cope with the creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Beast soul aura! Is it a sacred-blood beast soul aura?&#8221; Zhu
      Ting looked to Han Sen in the middle of the mutant creatures in surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, Han Sen did not have time to answer him. He threw a sharp
      gaze at the mutant creatures and aristocrat spirit. Every single object
      and living creature in the hall was imprinted in his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using his brain power, Han Sen was quickly calculating every single
      possibility. Shapeshifting into fairy queen made his eyesight sharper and
      made his enemies look slower, giving him enough time to think.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen made a step and turned his entire body into jade. If someone could
      see his body under his armor, they would certainly appreciate how gorgeous
      and dedicate it looked.
    </p>

    <p>Crack!</p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen brushed by a snow wolf, a foot-long cut was made on the
      shoulder of the snow wolf. Blood jetted out, but the jade-like palm was
      not even colored by the blood. Han Sen&#8217;s performance just began.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the attack of a dozen mutant creatures and the aristocrat spirit,
      Han Sen was not in a hurry. He looked so calm that it seemed that nothing
      could affect him.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if Han Sen&#8217;s moves were to be observed closely, each and
      every one of his moves had a strong sense of purpose. No extra movements
      were made. His entire body was like a highly efficient machine, generating
      all the power he got.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aristocrats spirit wielded the ice spear, trying to kill Han Sen. A
      dozen mutant creatures tried to circle him, but Han Sen found the slim
      chance of survival in a seemingly impossible way, breaking through the
      block of the mutant creatures and rushing toward the gigantic statue of
      deity.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Uncle Qing and others were dumbstruck. They could hardly
      believe that Han Sen was still human. A dozen mutant creatures could not
      stop his footsteps at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aristocrat spirit was both astonished and mad. Unexpectedly, she could
      not even catch up with Han Sen and had to watch him beating one mutant
      creature after another.
    </p>

    <p>
      In just a dozen seconds, Han Sen broke the blockage of the mutant
      creatures and jumped on the shoulder of the statue.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aristocrat spirit could not even catch up with Han Sen, staring
      blankly at him. Han Sen stood on the shoulder of the statue and took out
      the spirit stone from the deity&#8217;s forehead.
    </p>

    <p>
      It all happened so fast that the aristocrat spirit and the gang members
      had no time to react.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen got his hands on the spirit stone, he suddenly felt a strange
      force from his palm, making the spirit stone light up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ice Aristocrat, Snow Charmer, gives you her absolute loyalty and
      hopes to be your servant.&#8221; The elegant female spirit suddenly bowed
      her head and kneeled in front of Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen placed at the spirit stone on top of the head of the spirit. The
      stone suddenly became even more bright, whose light almost blinded
      everyone. When the lights disappeared, both the stone and Snow Charmer
      were gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The spirit swore fealty!&#8221; The rest people watched it happen,
      astonished. After long while, they realized what had happened and looked
      incredulous. God knows how difficult it was to make a spirit swear
      allegiance. It was not something that could be achieved by violence. It
      basically all depended on luck.
