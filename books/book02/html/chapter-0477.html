    <p>
      Han Sen was staring at the red crystal held in Wang Hou&#8217;s left hand,
      not because he could tell something special about the crystal, but because
      the nine-life cat dependent was reacting to the red crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The red crystal looked very similar to the material of the nine-life cat
      pendant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without more time for Han Sen to examine the crystal, Wang Hou had already
      walked up to him. Han Sen stood in front of Ji Yanran and shapeshifted
      into the fairy queen, running Heresy Mantra and Overload at the same time
      to achieve his best.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I did not kill you because I did not want Li Mingtang to find out
      about my real strength. You think you could beat me with your miserable
      abilities?&#8221; Wang Hou snorted with contempt, stabbing his sword at
      Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Hou&#8217;s move was incredibly fast, and his sword reached Han
      Sen&#8217;s throat in an instant.
    </p>

    <p>
      His heart thumping, Han Sen fixed his eyes on Wang Hou. Stepping forward
      instead of going back, he approached Wang Hou like a ghost.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if Han Sen did everything he could, his fitness was still lacking
      compared to Wang Hou who had already passed a hundred in fitness. In
      addition, Wang Hou had a sacred-blood sword from Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary in his hand, while Han Sen had no proper weapon to use, which
      made it even harder for him to compete with Wang Hou.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen&#8217;s only chance to win was a close combat.</p>

    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen approaching himself, Wang Hou turned his sword around,
      changing from stabbing to cutting without so much as a pause. There was
      almost no way for Han Sen to defend himself.
    </p>

    <p>Swish!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was a bit slow at dodging the sword, and his neck was immediately
      marked with a cut. Blood started to flow. Although the injury was not
      fatal, it looked very scary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Watch out, Han Sen! It is Sprocket Sword. Do not let him strike
      again,&#8221; seeing Wang Hou&#8217;s sword skills, Ji Yanran alarmed Han
      Sen, appalled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are indeed someone from the Jis. So knowledgeable that you
      recognize Sprocket Sword. However, you know that too late.&#8221; Wang Hou
      moved his left hand and summoned another beast soul sword. With one sword
      in each hand, he attacked Han Sen continuously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had no way to block the incoming attacks. Wang Hou&#8217;s sword
      skills were so incredible that the two swords looked like they were
      designed to be used together. One sword after another, Wang Hou did not
      leave any chance for Han Sen to even breathe. The strikes were so tight
      that they were like two sprockets moving forward with their teeth
      intertwined with no gaps at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just in a moment, Han Sen had been cut in several places already, bleeding
      heavily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since Han Sen evolved to Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, he had never met
      such a strong enemy. There was no way for Han Sen to fight someone with a
      fitness over a hundred and using Sprocket Sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Summoning her dagger, Ji Yanran wanted to join the fight. Even if she had
      to sacrifice her life, she could not stand there and watch Han Sen getting
      killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t come over. I got it,&#8221; Han Sen exclaimed to stop
      Ji Yanran from coming, staring at the double swords of Wang Hou.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No rush. You will both die anyways.&#8221; Wang Hou&#8217;s swords
      were getting faster and faster, his face cold.
    </p>

    <p>
      The kiting skills that Han Sen had put a lot of effort into eventually
      became handy. With excellent calculation, Han Sen managed to stall Wang
      Hou. Although he did not have the ability to fight back, Wang Hou&#8217;s
      swords were never deadly to him either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Hou couldn&#8217;t help frowning slightly. Sprocket Sword was one of
      the best sword skills in making attacks. Once started, it could hardly be
      stopped by anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since Wang Hou succeeded in practicing Sprocket Sword, even an evolver
      stronger than himself could hardly survive his double swords. It would be
      impressive for someone to block one or two hundred strikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen&#8217;s fitness was obviously weaker than Wang Hou, but
      he had already blocked three hundred strikes before Wang Hou could launch
      a fatal attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, Wang Hou was starting to feel that it was harder and harder
      for his blades to hurt Han Sen. Although Han Sen was covered in injuries
      and blood all over, Wang Hou knew very well that those injuries were not
      deadly.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was even weirder was that Han Sen&#8217;s injuries only bled a bit
      when he just got hurt, but the bleeding stopped very soon, and the injury
      started to shrink.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s eyes were emotionless like a well, reflecting all his
      enemy&#8217;s moves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sprocket Sword was indeed very impressive. There was hardly any pause
      between two strikes. Each strike was carefully designed that once the
      first strike was made, every strike that followed was unstoppable. Each
      strike was targeted at a vital part, not leaving the enemy any chance to
      fight back before killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, humans were not machines with sprockets. And the design of
      Sprocket Sword even gave Han Sen some extra opportunities. When it came to
      the design in martial arts, Han Sen had never met anyone stronger than
      Queen, who was a real master.
    </p>

    <p>
      Different from Queen, Wang Hou&#8217;s sword skills were half fixed and
      half calculated, which made it more rigid than Queen&#8217;s kiting
      skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Queen was a real master, then Wang Hou was simply someone with a good
      set of sword skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter how good a set of sword skills was, it must be rigid with
      errors. When Han Sen was using kiting skills to dodge the attacks from
      Wang Hou, he was also continuously leading Wang Hou to make mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gradually, Han Sen came to understand the Sprocket Sword better, so it was
      harder and harder for Wang Hou to injure him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Hou became upset. It was the first time that he had encountered an
      opponent like this one. It seemed that Han Sen&#8217;s footwork was quite
      ordinary. However, no matter how fierce Wang Hou&#8217;s sword skills
      were, it was hard for him to kill Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s fitness was much worse than Wang Hou&#8217;s, but Wang Hou
      started to feel that he was about to lose control.
    </p>

    <p>
      The figure of Han Sen became more and more unpredictable in Wang
      Hou&#8217;s eyes, which consumed his confidence and made him feel that it
      was hard for him to kill Han Sen. Wang Hou was even worried that Han Sen
      might strike back.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible!&#8221; Wang Hou roared, hitting Han Sen even harder
      with his swords.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there was hardly effective. To the contrary, it made it even
      easier for Han Sen to cope with him. Anger will only cause more mistakes
      in Wang Hou&#8217;s sword skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, the situation seemed to be reversed. Wang Hou&#8217;s
      sword skills were still as fierce as ever, but for some reason, it felt he
      was at a disadvantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran was both surprised and happy. Wang Hou who had practiced
      Sprocket Sword, which was one of the strongest attacking sword skills,
      failed to kill Han Sen after the first strike, and Han Sen even turned the
      situation around, which was something Ji Yanran had never heard of before.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fitness level over a hundred and the well-known Sprocket Sword seemed to
      be completely useless in front of Han Sen. Han Sen became more and more
      flexible, while Wang Hou became more and more suppressed. With a strong
      fitness and sharp sacred-blood sword, Wang Hou could not put Han Sen down
      at all.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      With a punch from Han Sen, Wang Hou had to turn from offense to defense.
      The renowned Sprocket Sword was forced to be put on hold.
