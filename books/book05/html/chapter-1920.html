<h2>Empty Mouth, White Teeth</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1920</h3>

<p>Sword Know’s swordlight became a star in the sky. It descended
like a meteor shower, drenching Han Sen’s entire body in the starry
swordlight. From the other side, the Tego Earl was like a tiger.
His punch leaped forward like a beast, with Han Sen as its
prey.</p>
<p>Han Sen was under fire from both sides. He couldn’t speed up,
and neither could he hope to evade. He didn’t want to leave the
spring’s eye, either. With his immobility, he had to stop the
spring water the moment it appeared. If the droplets made it past
him, he wouldn’t stand any chance of retrieving them.</p>
<p>But there was a chance that the red beam was harmful, so he
couldn’t stand directly over the spout. Even if he could, he knew
Sword Know and the others wouldn’t let him stay there.</p>
<p>Rebecca and the other Earls did not fight alongside Sword Know
and Tego Earl. They believed Han Sen’s power might have been the
equivalent of an Earl, but his skill most certainly wasn’t.
Furthermore, his movement had been restricted until he was slower
than a Baron. He’d be lucky not to get killed by those two
Earls.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t disheartened by those odds, though. He put the
springwater into his mouth, while his other hand wielded Ghost
Teeth Knife. He spun it in a circle.</p>
<p>Sword Know’s starry swordlight impacted the twirling knife and
vanished into the blurring circle.</p>
<p>On the other side, the Tego Earl’s fist was falling towards Han
Sen. Han Sen moved his hand and pulled the knife circle closer. The
starry swordlight emerged from the knife circle, prepped to strike
the fist.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The swordlight and the fistlight shattered, creating a large
shockwave. Sword Know and the Tego stumbled back. Han Sen, on the
other hand, was unharmed. He remained standing exactly where he had
been.</p>
<p>Everyone was frozen. No one had expected this result.</p>
<p>“Empty Mouth, White Teeth! That is the hardest technique of
Teeth Knife. It can exchange black and white, yin and yang. Even
the few Dukes that have practiced Teeth Knife would not dare risk
using this. No one dares to use it because success is not
guaranteed. Han Sen has just used it, though, and he did succeed!”
Rebecca stared at the scene in disbelief.</p>
<p>Rebecca wasn’t the only one thinking this way, either. Flower
King and Moon Wheel King were in just as much shock.</p>
<p>Empty Mouth, White Teeth was not difficult to practice, but it
was extremely difficult to use in combat. The user had to have true
understanding of their own power and their enemy’s power as well.
They had to know a lot, too. If they didn’t, they’d only end up
bringing harm upon themselves.</p>
<p>Out of all the Rebate, the only one who could use this ability
in combat was Knife Queen.</p>
<p>A few of the Dukes that had practiced Teeth Knife had given it a
try in the past, but they all failed. And since a miss in combat
could result in death, few others were keen on trying it.</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s shock, the spring’s eye gleamed with another
red light. Another orb of spring water was shooting out.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out his hand and grabbed the droplet. It was
really pleasing to see him do this, like watching someone catch a
fly with chopsticks.</p>
<p>“I have to get him away from the spring’s eye!” Rebecca turned
into a light, and she shot towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Sword Know and the Tego Earl were running towards Han Sen, too.
They wanted to get him away from the spring; they’d kill him if
they had to.</p>
<p>Du Lishe and the other Viscounts were still dealing with the
xenogeneics. Du Lishe was still a little weak, though, and Moon
Wheel King had not permitted her to become an Earl there. So, she
did not go to the red mist spring’s eye. Still, she was able to
keep an eye on the situation unfolding there.</p>
<p>Han Sen had taken all the spring water alone, and he had managed
to do it while beating back the Tego Earl and Sword Know. Needless
to say, she was surprised. But when Rebecca decided to join the two
attacking Han Sen, what happened next made Du Lishe believe she was
dreaming.</p>
<p>The purple-black Ghost Teeth Knife moved in the same way Han Sen
did. It was difficult to predict. He was fighting back the Earls,
and despite Rebecca joining in to help, they could still not remove
him from the spring’s eye.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about all this was that when Han Sen and
Rebecca were fighting, Han Sen wasn’t looking at the spring’s eye.
But when a red orb flew out, Han Sen would lean in and grab it
really quick. He was faster than lightning, and in a flash, he’d
have put it in his mouth.</p>
<p>Not only Du Lishe was shocked by this. Rebecca, the other Earls,
and all the Kings that were observing the events were in shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Teeth Knife was like a raging beast. His skills were
very serious, and he looked like a champion. The Teeth Knife skill
was helping Han Sen a lot right now. He was surrounded, but even
so, he never slipped up once. He wasn’t even rushed or panicked,
and his performance was flawless.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty of performing Empty Mouth, White Teeth in
combat, Han Sen used it twenty times without fail. Now they knew
that Han Sen was really like Knife Queen. He could use the ability
in combat, to a degree that exceeded the chance of being a lucky
fluke.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As the observers watched the fight, Han Sen and his knife seemed
to merge. Han Sen was Han Sen, and Ghost Teeth Knife was Ghost
Teeth Knife, but now they were combined. They were one, like an
evil-looking beast with a grin. It gave people the willies.</p>
<p>“Teeth Knife knifemind!” Suddenly, Night River King let out a
scream.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a Teeth Knife knifemind: the purest example of one,
actually. And it was coming from a Baron.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King and the others were speechless. Even with their
years of experience, they had no idea how Han Sen could practice
Teeth Knife knifemind in such a small amount of time.</p>
<p>But this was the Rebate’s Teeth Knife. It was something most
Rebate could not practice. Han Sen was just an outsider, and he had
learned it all within a month. Moon Wheel King and the rest
wouldn’t have believed it if they weren’t there to see it
themselves.</p>
<p>“Is he a knife skill genius?” The Kings looked at him with
complicated expressions.</p>
<p>Rebecca was shocked, too. The scariest thing was that Han Sen’s
knifemind was gradually increasing.</p>
