<p>Han Sen knew that he had finally gotten through to the butterfly
lady. He looked at God next to him. He saw God just sit there and
watch like a member of the audience. God was not going to prohibit
Han Sen from trying.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a deep breath and said, “Stopping him is not that
hard. You just need to destroy his geno art and body. Take him with
you and keep him alive. But throughout his whole life, do not allow
him to practice again. Have him hover between life and death where
he can see his way forward but cannot do anything to venture there.
I am sure the pain he suffers will be as grand as yours. That way,
you can relish in the pain he feels each and every day. Isn’t that
better than killing him?”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew this idea he devised would likely shackle him with
a lot of bad karma. Given the circumstances, he did not care about
that all that much. Allowing the Very High to suffer was much
better than letting himself become a slave for 100 years.</p>
<p>When the butterfly lady heard Han Sen, her eyes turned bright.
She was almost insanely happy. Her teeth were chattering. She
stared at the half-dead Very High Leader and laughed. “Not bad… I
want to watch you suffer as bad as I have… I want you to suffer
through torture and torment every day…”</p>
<p>While she was talking, the butterfly lady came before Very High
Leader. She grabbed Very High Leader, who was now like a skeleton,
not caring for the fact he had blood everywhere. She held him in
her arms like a baby. She flapped her wings and flew into the
mountains.</p>
<p>“It looks like your plan failed.” Han Sen felt weird. God did
not stop the butterfly lady from leaving.</p>
<p>“Yes, you win,” God said with a nod.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He looked at God for a while. The bet was
not over yet. God could still perform one last twist of the knife.
With God’s mind, tricks, and powers, Han Sen did not believe there
was nothing more it could do.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at God as he asked, “Aren’t you even going to
try? There is still more time.” Of course, he was not trying to
sway God. He was just worried about God having another conspiracy
in the works. He didn’t want the rug pulled from under him.</p>
<p>God smiled. “There is no need. I want to watch and find out what
the ending is, but there won’t be enough time. So, let’s end it
here. You win the bet.”</p>
<p>“Can you give Wan’er to me now?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course. You go back first. I will stay here and watch the
ending alone.” God waved a hand. Han Sen felt the sky and the
ground spin. He experienced another painful teleport.</p>
<p>When his body returned to normal, he was already back upon God’s
Farm.</p>
<p>That God was so weird. It was willing to lose all because it
wanted to watch the ending. But that is not a bad thing. Otherwise,
I have no idea who would have ended up winning. Although Han Sen
had won the bet, the pressure put upon him by God had not been
reduced.</p>
<p>In the past, when he was facing King, Empty God, and other scary
god spirits, Han Sen did not feel so pressured. That weird-looking
God, which did not look so scary, did not give him pressure.</p>
<p>That was not because God’s power was stronger than his. It was
the invisible, mental pressure. It was a natural reaction to feel
when one subconsciously felt danger.</p>
<p>So far, to make Han Sen feel this form of crisis, only God had
been able to do it.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he might have to wait for a long time. After an
hour, God returned and approached Han Sen with tears in its
eyes.</p>
<p>That fast? Did the butterfly lady go mad and kill Very High
Leader? Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>God seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking and said, “I only
fast-forwarded time. I went to watch their grim ending. You still
won the bet.”</p>
<p>“What was the end like?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>“You are not going to like it,” God coldly said. It did not tell
him the ending of the butterfly lady and Very High Leader’s
story.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at God, who had taken over Wan’er’s body, and
asked, “Now, can you give Wan’er back to me?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” God said with a nod. “Where would you like to go? Let’s
go!”</p>
<p>“What does that mean? Are you going to break the promise?” Han
Sen asked with a frown. If God was betraying the deal, there was
nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p>“I only promised to give you Wan’er. I never said I would exit
her body.” God smiled and spoke as if it was the one in the
right.</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, he froze. He knew he would not beat God
with such word games. The most important thing was the simple fact
that God had more power. The one who had more power was the one Han
Sen could not beat. He could not properly object.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to stop talking. Taking a Wan’er that had been
taken over by God was worse than not bringing her back at all. It
would only make Lone Bamboo even sadder.</p>
<p>God seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. He coldly said, “I
am planning to travel through the universe. So, how about this? You
can be my tour guide. In six months, I will give you the complete
Wan’er.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face did not look any better following that. Being
with such a dangerous God for half a year, made Han Sen unsure of
how he might end up dead.</p>
<p>“Of course, you could give her up, but that would be your
decision to give up Wan’er,” God said. “That would not be me
breaking a promise.”</p>
<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth. “Sure. But no more bets over the next
half a year while you’re with me. And, you cannot ask me to make
wishes.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” God smiled and nodded. It did not waste time
thinking.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at God with a complex look. He knew this was
dangerous, but it was now the only way to save Wan’er. With God’s
scary power, unless his power was enough to breach the geno hall,
there was no other way for him to get Wan’er back.</p>
<p>This bet was only won through luck. It was the reason why he had
won. If he had to do it again, Han Sen was not sure if he would
win.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, How did Han Jingzhi beat him 11 times
before?</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Where are we going next?” God looked at Han Sen with
interest.</p>
<p>“Where would you like to go?” Han Sen glumly asked. “I will take
you there.”</p>
<p>“Your home.” What God said made Han Sen’s mouth drop open. He
could not close it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mind flashed through many ideas. Is my home someplace
you can go to? Even if I could, I would not take you there. That is
like inviting a wolf into a room. No, that is not like inviting a
wolf into a room. It is like inviting God into a room. Gods are
much scarier than wolves, but where can I take him? My body cannot
be an adult for much longer. I will be a child soon… Then, it will
be worse…</p>
<p>In the past, Han Sen was worried that his body would become a
child, but he did not change. He only noticed when he returned to
God’s Farm that the time he came back was the same as the time when
he went in. He was able to guess why he had not already turned into
a child.</p>
<p>Regarding why God came out late, Han Sen did not understand.</p>
