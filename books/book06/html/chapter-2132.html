<p>When the flowers on Evil Eye’s armor opened in bloom, the mass of his power reached a truly frightening level. He was much scarier than even Dragon Eight’s gold Dragon body.</p>

<p>“Your knowledge and control are better than mine, it would appear. But so what? Before a sufficient amount of raw, physical power, you have no hope of triumphing. You will ultimately lose.” Evil Eye looked at Han Sen coldly.</p>

<p>“What? You lack skill, so you want to start brawling?” Han Sen laughed.</p>

<p>“Power and skill are never distinguishable as two separate things. Your knowledge and your ability to control the fluctuations of power is impressive, but can you apply that talent in actual combat? Mere talk is useless.” Evil Eye said, his power continuing to burgeon.</p>

<p>“Then come and give it a try,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>“Ha, this is precisely how I wanted it.” Evil Eye’s body shot toward Han Sen like a purple shadow.</p>

<p>His skills were no better than Dragon Eight’s, but his entire body had been transformed into a killing machine. Purple flowers began to appear across his limbs. They swayed as if they were alive, and their sole purpose was to pursue Han Sen.</p>

<p>For Han Sen, Evil Eye was the rare sort of enemy that required his full effort and attention. He was not the type of foe Han Sen could afford to underestimate, so he focused his powers and prepared the Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go to engage Evil Eye properly. He also planned to make use of Super Spank.</p>

<p>Evil Eye’s use of skills was fluid, though. They kept on changing. He had a roster of techniques, after all. He had the skills of the Dragon, the Buddha, the Destroyed, and so on. But what’s more, it felt as if every skill was mastered. While they might have all had different purposes and meanings, he was able to combine them all seamlessly.</p>

<p>Every technique was stunningly employed, and every blow was followed by an unexpected change of style.</p>

<p>The elites were all confused by what they saw. Many of their faces changed, especially when they realized that they were seeing glimpses of the legendary techniques of the race they belonged to.</p>

<p>Han Sen, on the other hand, fought in a totally different manner. His skills were very clear. They appeared simple, but they still had a depth to them that the onlookers couldn’t quite understand.</p>

<p>After watching many of his moves, the audience was able to understand how he was using his kicks and punches.</p>

<p>No matter how much Evil Eye was able to alter his attacks, wherever Han Sen touched, Evil Eye’s power would be reduced to dust. Super Spank was able to break and disintegrate every sequence structure it came into contact with.</p>

<p>Evil Eye’s body split into two, and both bodies attacked Han Sen. There was no illusion, and the two forms really did comprise Evil Eye’s actual body. And they were both equally powerful.</p>

<p>“Destroyed’s Doppelganger! Isn’t that a technique that only one of the Destroyed is able to learn?” Everyone was shocked by this reveal.</p>

<p>In the next second, that shock turned into awe. The two Evil Eye’s split again, and now there were four Evil Eye’s on the battleground.</p>

<p>Destroyed’s Doppelganger technique was only able to split a person into three due to the origin race having three heads and six arms.</p>

<p>Evil Eye was not one of the Destroyed. He didn’t have three heads and six arms, so he was able to split into four. That was rather scary.</p>

<p>Han Sen made no move yet, though. Heavenly Go was still pumping in his heart. Fighting four people was an insane thing to attempt, but even when faced with that, he was able to keep his calm.</p>

<p>The four Evil Eye’s piled on the pressure by surrounding Han Sen on all sides with different techniques. The nobles that watched were all confused by what they saw, but they were able to understand that despite all that, Evil Eye hadn’t exactly gained the upper-hand.</p>

<p>“Powerful Evil Eye! Scary Dollar!”</p>

<p>“Dollar is the one that is able to breakdown any skill he sees. The Evilbreaker powers of the Dragon were weak to him, don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Argh, he is so strong! Where did these humans come from? Aren’t they so scary? Are all humans like this?”</p>

<p>“No way. If all humans were this strong, wouldn’t they be famous? They surely wouldn’t be nameless and shrouded in mystery as this fellow is. I think Dollar must be the first elite humans have had in millions of years.”</p>

<p>“What ability is Dollar using? Fighters are always weak against particular elements, but no matter what geno art is used against him, he is able to break it in a flash. This is terrifying me.”</p>

<p>In Sky Palace, Thousand Feather Crane and the others were all frozen. Yun Suyi pulled Yun Changkong and asked, “Father, what is Dollar using? How can he break every skill and render all of Evil Eye’s geno arts useless?”</p>

<p>Because Yun Changkong had business with the Feather, he hadn’t returned to Sky Palace with Han Sen. If he had been with Han Sen, then Han Sen wouldn’t have vanished in the attack.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I do not understand, either.” Yun Changkong shook his head.</p>

<p>Hearing that, the Yun sisters and Thousand Feather Crane felt their eyes widen. Dollar was just a Marquise, despite how strong he was. But he did things that not even a King class person like Yun Changkong could understand. It was a very strange scenario, for sure.</p>

<p>Evil Eye looked very glum, as all this transpired. He felt as if the breadth of his power was actually much stronger than Han Sen’s, but every time he came against the human, his powers were shattered. All in all, it made him realize something.</p>

<p>“He can use that dismantling power in combat like this?” Evil Eye was starting to think that Dollar was some sort of old monster from ages past, and that he had lived through time by being reborn in the same manner Evil Eye had. To him, there was no other explanation for Han Sen’s performance.</p>

<p>Although he was able to dismantle powers, it wasn’t something he was fast enough to do in a real fight. He could only see the weaknesses if he had time to examine them.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Han Sen punched an Evil Eye, and that body degraded swiftly into nothing.</p>

<p>The Dongxuan Sutra’s judgment and the formation employed by Heavenly Go were starting to come together. Han Sen was now the one controlling the fight.</p>

<p>Evil Eye suddenly stumbled back and left the immediate battlefield. The two doppelgangers still functioning returned to the primary host and melded back into him. Just as everyone was guessing what Evil Eye would do next, his forehead cracked open. The third eye that had four purple pupils appeared on his forehead.</p>

<p>Yun Changkong and the Sky screamed. “Sky! Evil Eye became one of the Sky!”</p>

<p>“That explains why I was unable to see Evil Eye’s four evil eyes. They resided inside his third Sky eye.”</p>

<p>“Shit! He is one of the Sky. That means Evil Eye has not been fighting with power. For the Sky, opening their third eye means things are just getting started.”</p>

<p>“Evil Eye looks pretty p*ssed.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Dollar will be able to compete against Evil Eye with his Sky eye open.”</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at Evil Eye’s third eye. The pupils looked familiar, for some reason. And now that he realized that Evil Eye was one of the Sky, that sense of familiarity heightened.</p>

<p>“In front of this monstrous power, your skills will matter very little.” Evil Eye opened his Sky eye. His power had increased by a vast amount, and the purple light of his Sky eye flared the purple flowers across his armor. A fire kicked up, and it enveloped Evil Eye’s entire body.</p>
