      Luckily, the meat of the ghost-pawed ferret was very sweet and tasty,
      without any foul smell or taste. In fact, it was extremely good with
      sauces, comparable to sashimi.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Meat Of Ghost-Pawed Ferret Eaten. One Sacred Geno Point
        Gained.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Hearing the voice ringing over and over, Han Sen was very pleased. Roughly
      speaking, two sacred geno points could increase his fitness index by one
      point. If this ferret could give him ten sacred geno points, his fitness
      index would be increased by five.
    </p>

    <p>
      After eating a small part of the ferret, Han Sen suddenly saw a ride
      coming over on the ice field. To his surprise, it was the man fighting
      four sacred-blood creatures in Starwheel Shelter earlier.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen did not know why the man would be here.</p>

    <p>
      As he was puzzled, he saw the man examining the spot where Han Sen killed
      the evil gargoyle and tracing the footsteps to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen suddenly became alerted, watching the man running his way and
      approaching him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Friend, do not get the wrong idea. I did not mean you harm by
      tracking you down, but only wanted to make a friend.&#8221; Seeing Han
      Sen, Li Xinglun became happy and told Han Sen why he was here.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you just want to thank me, then it&#8217;s not necessary,&#8221;
      said Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I will only want to thank you, I did not need to chase you for
      more than 300 miles,&#8221; Li Xinglun said in a clear voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are you trying to do then?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Li
      Xinglun, feeling curious.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is hard to see someone I like, and I do not want to miss a
      friend,&#8221; Li Xinglun said seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You could not make someone your friend by talking,&#8221; said Han
      Sen after eating another piece of meat.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But I first need to know you. If I don&#8217;t know you, strangers
      can never become friends.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun sat down opposite Han Sen, and the two started chatting. After
      a while, Han Sen felt this person was quite interesting. He was gallant,
      intelligent, and humorous, the kind of person that easily lets others put
      their guard down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen was vigilant, he could not help feeling impressed by his
      knowledge and manner. This person was definitely from a prominent family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to Li Xinglun, Han Sen had a general grasp of the situation at this
      place. On this ice field, there were as many human shelters as 20 to 30.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, most of them were shelters taken from squire spirits and knight
      spirits. There were only three shelters that were taken from aristocrat
      spirits, and each of the three shelters was managed by a different person.
      The three persons represented the three largest forces on the icefield.
      Other smaller shelters were almost all under the control of the three
      forces, and Starwheel Shelter managed by Li Xinglun was one of the three
      largest shelter on the ice field.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, there was that shelter of the royal spirit, blocking the way
      between the icefield and outside. Although the situation in this place was
      much better than Han Sen&#8217;s Goddess Shelter, it was still an area
      relatively desolate, not connected to the vast population of humans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xinglun had always been wanting to take down the royal spirit shelter
      and expand the hunting area. Otherwise, the resources were limited in this
      area, which made it hard for him to max out on sacred geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, depending on the ability of Starwheel Shelter alone, there was no
      way they could take down the royal spirit shelter. In addition, human
      shelters on this ice field had been competing against each other for
      years, so there were lots of grudges between them, making it hard for them
      to work together to conquer the royal spirit shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Li Xinglun had been trying to urge all the shelters to unite
      since he took over the Starwheel Shelter, the grudge and hatred that had
      accumulated for centuries were not that easy to be resolved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen admired Li Xinglun&#8217;s strategy and way of thinking quite a
      lot, so he agreed that he would help if Li Xinglun could persuade the
      other two shelters to conquer the royal spirit shelter together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew his own strength very well. Although he had killed the royal
      spirit once, it was a sneak attack, which would only work for the first
      time. Next time, the royal spirit would be guarded.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he fought the royal spirit one on one, face to face, he might not be
      her match. In addition, there were a lot of sacred-blood creatures in the
      royal spirit. Han Sen could cope with one or two of them. If there were
      more, he had to run for his life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, there was no way he could conquer the royal spirit shelter on
      his own. If Li Xinglun could unite the three forces to conquer the royal
      spirit shelter, Han Sen would not miss the opportunity to take part in it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, as long as he could get the spirit stone, he would be able to
      gain the allegiance from the royal spirit for sure, which was the most
      valuable thing in the royal spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had also learned that the creatures in this area were almost all
      split up by the three large forces. In addition, there were not many
      creatures in the area to begin with. Therefore, it would be hard for him
      to hunt other sacred-blood creatures. To increase his geno points in a
      short amount of time was out of the question. Han Sen thought about it and
      stopped hunting. He followed Li Xinglun back to the Starwheel Shelter and
      teleported back to the Alliance using the teleport device inside the
      shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ghost-pawed ferret gave him ten sacred geno points as he expected.
      With the two sacred geno points he already had, Han Sen now had twelve
      sacred geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      With such gains, Han Sen was very satisfied with this trip. Initially, he
      did not have much hope for hunting an edible sacred-blood creature, which
      was completely a surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since he could not increase his geno points in a short amount of time, Han
      Sen decided not to hunt anymore. Before the military contest began, he
      would like to focus on practicing the techniques written in Dongxuan
      Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the fight against the royal spirit, Han Sen had some new
      understandings of the techniques in Dongxuan Sutra, which he hoped to
      reinforce through lots of sparring and practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought about it and logged in to the official Skynet platform of
      the Alliance. Before he became an evolver, he could not enter the evolver
      section on the official platform, which was why he chose to go to
      Gladiator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now with the official identity as evolver, he could register at the
      official platform to fight evolvers from all over the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the official platform had a benefit. Although the account
      information on the official platform was private and was protected by law,
      the marks of aristocracy would show when someone entered the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aristocrats with different titles were most likely matched with opponents
      with the same title.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was a sacred-blood aristocrat, which would be marked next to his
      account on the official platform. This way, the majority of his opponents
      would be sacred-blood aristocrats, same as him. And a small part of his
      opponents would be other people with good record.
    </p>

    <p>
      That meant it was easy for Han Sen to meet master fighters on this
      platform, which was why Han Sen gave up the Gladiator and chose the
      official platform instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      When registering, Han Sen thought about it and used the name of Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after he entered the ID name, he saw it had already existed. Han
      Sen then added some words and changed it into &#8220;I am Dollar,&#8221;
      which still could not be used.
