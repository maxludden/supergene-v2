<p>Two days later, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were happy to
report to Han Sen that they had not grown any older. Although their
connection was still there, they no longer had to combine if they
wanted to survive.</p>
<p>Han Sen let out a long sigh. This was the best result he could
have hoped for. If the problem hadn’t been resolved when he
completed their genes, he had no other ideas on how to fix the
issue. In the meantime, he spent all his energy practicing Big
Destroyed. As he attempted to practice Big Destroyed safely, he
wasn’t putting in enough power to fully cast Big Destroyed. But as
time passed, and he practiced more and more, he was able to
generate Big Destroyed’s light. But the Big Destroyed light he
created wasn’t even enough to kill a Duke in its current state.
That meant it couldn’t be used to consume King class xenogeneic
genes.</p>
<p>Progress was progress, though, and his advancement thus far made
Han Sen happy. If he could successfully activate Big Destroyed’s
godlight, that meant developing power and control with the
technique was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept practicing Big Destroyed. As he got used to how Big
Destroyed’s godlight worked, he grew more and more powerful with
it.</p>
<p>Han Sen used King class xenogeneic genes to practice. A month
later, his Big Destroyed godlight could digest King class
xenogeneic genes. It turned them into a pile of dust that was
smaller than a speck of powder.</p>
<p>He used Consume to eat the King class xenogeneic genes that he
had ground up with Big Destroyed. When he tested the process, Han
Sen noticed his digestive speed had increased. Within a day, he was
able to absorb a dozen King class xenogeneic genes that had been
ground up into a powder, earning a dozen King genes. “Hahaha! Big
Destroyed is different. Right now, I still haven’t mastered the
technique, but if I can practice and take Big Destroyed to the max,
I think I’ll be able to absorb King class xenogeneic genes
incredibly quickly. I might even be able to eat one hundred King
class genes in a single day.” Han Sen was delighted. Within a few
days, his Dongxuan Sutra’s area had broken through to another
tier.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng wanted to go to the core area to
hunt xenogeneics. When they told Han Sen where they were, he
discovered that they were close to his Jadeskin spawn point. He had
them wait there for him, and he entered the core area himself. He
found Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon, and after the rendezvous, they
went out to hunt core xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Most people never really worried about the future; they only
worried about the present. Han Sen had lots of King class
xenogeneic genes, but his Big Destroyed and Consume were getting
stronger and stronger. If he was able to break down a hundred genes
a day, eating a thousand King class xenogeneic genes would only
take a week and a half.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were first-tier Kings, but their
powers exceeded what the average first-tier King could do. They
were practically the same as Han Sen had been at his first-tier.
Their skills and area powers were very good, so killing King class
xenogeneics was a trivial affair.</p>
<p>But their digestion speed was much slower than Han Sen’s
Consume. Even if Han Sen used Big Destroyed to break their
xenogeneic genes down for them, they could only digest one per day.
Han Sen wasn’t in a rush, but Li Keer was. She had been there for a
whole month, waiting on Dollar’s return. Not even the flicker of
his shadow showed up, though. It was like he never planned on
coming back. Li Keer’s teeth itched.</p>
<p>“That *sshole.” Li Keer sat in the front of her ship, gritting
her teeth and looking up into the sky. If he showed up, she’d
probably have to fight off the urge to smack him.</p>
<p>“Little Sister, this is bad. The Very High should be
emotionless, but you are very emotional right now. This is bad for
you.” A very pretty woman appeared on her ship. She stood behind Li
Keer and looked at her.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, why are you here?” Li Keer turned around to find
a green-clothed woman standing behind her. The woman was pretty,
but she was emotionless. Her face was like ice.</p>
<p>“I hear you have selected your target. Let me see how your
silkworm is,” the woman said coldly.</p>
<p>“Good or bad, it doesn’t concern you.” Li Keer lifted her
lips.</p>
<p>The woman, seeing Li Keer’s face, shook her head. “You’re
displaying too many emotions. Your practice of the Very High
talents isn’t up to par. I’m worried about you failing, or
resorting to selecting a poor silkworm that can’t do anything in
service of the Very High.”</p>
<p>“Good or bad, it is none of your business,” Li Keer
insisted.</p>
<p>Third Sister didn’t become angry. She acted as if she hadn’t
heard Li Keer at all, and emotionlessly said, “It doesn’t matter
whether you admit it or not; I am your Third Sister. I cannot let
you walk along this path of constant failure.”</p>
<p>Before she could reply, Third Sister continued, “Okay. Now tell
me, where is this person you’ve chosen? Let me see if he is capable
of serving the Very High.”</p>
<p>“He isn’t here right now,” Li Keer said.</p>
<p>“Why not call him over?” Third Sister said.</p>
<p>“I haven’t told him I am claiming him. I can’t contact him. If
you are so smart, why don’t you go and find him for me?” Li Keer
snarled.</p>
<p>“You are so slow. You still haven’t claimed him? What have you
been doing all this time?” Third Sister frowned. She wasn’t happy
with Li Keer’s progress.</p>
<p>Li Keer blushed. She had spent so much effort trying to convince
Han Sen, but it never worked out. She hadn’t told him who she was,
and thus, she couldn’t claim him.</p>
<p>Third Sister looked at Li Keer’s face but did not say anything.
Something in her eyes swirled, looking as if a spinning galaxy was
residing with them.“Tell me who your target is.” Third Sister’s
eyes looked very magical.</p>
<p>“If you are so smart, why don’t you guess who it is?” Li Keer
said in a sulky manner.</p>
<p>Again, Third Sister didn’t become angry. She just reached her
hand out and grabbed one of Li Keer’s hairs. Then, she stared into
that strand of hair with her shiny eyes.</p>
<p>Her spinning galaxy-like eyes revealed the image of Li Keer. The
image danced as if the woman was rewinding time, revealing what Li
Keer had been doing. Everything she had done in the past few days
played before the woman’s eyes. Time quickly went back to when she
parted ways with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“He is your target, yes? Dollar. I have heard his name. Right.
He came first in the Geno Being Scroll. He defeated Lone Bamboo,”
Third Sister said, her voice neutral. Then, she stopped looking.
Her eyes returned to normal, and the strand of hair turned to dust
in her hand.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, how could you read my past without my
permission?” Li Keer sounded annoyed.</p>
<p>“Behavior like this doesn’t belong in the Very High.” Third
Sister shook her head, ignoring Li Keer’s protest. The stars in her
eyes were still spinning when she spoke to herself, saying, “Let me
help you take a look at what this Dollar is doing. I will see if he
can be your silkworm.”</p>
<p>Her eyes spun and the lights in them flashed. A shadow that
looked like Han Sen appeared.</p>
