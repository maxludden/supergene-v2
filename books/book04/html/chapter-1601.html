	<p>Han Sen tried a lot of things, but he still couldn’t get the crystal shoe off his foot. That shoe seemed to have
		been permanently attached to him, and he couldn’t even get the thing to wiggle.</p>

	<p>After a short while, a sand mouse managed to cross the entire fluorescent lake and reached the island.</p>

	<p>The island was very small, around two thousand square feet in total area, and there was a fruit tree growing in
		the middle of the island.</p>

	<p>The fruit tree wasn’t very tall, and it looked like an ordinary pear tree. Despite the fact that it was around
		ten feet tall, there were only three pieces of fruit hanging on it. Perhaps some of the fruit had already been
		taken.</p>

	<p>One of the pears was green, one was red, and the third one was yellow. It was strange how different all the
		pieces of fruit looked from each other.</p>

	<p>If the green pear hadn’t matured yet, then what about the red pear and the yellow pear? Which one had matured?
	</p>

	<p>“Let’s get onto the island first.” Han Sen saw that he couldn’t get the crystal heel off at the moment, so he let
		Little Star fly to the island anyway.</p>

	<p>He wasn’t anxious at all. Since entering super king spirit mode had some impact on the crystal heel, he would
		probably try to deal with the problem that way. Even if everything else he tried failed, he could just cut off
		his foot. With Han Sen’s physical strength and the curing power of Little Silver, his foot would regrow again.
	</p>

	<p>When Little Star flew to the island, it was already late. The sand mouse, which had somehow made it to the
		island, had climbed up the fruit tree, and taken a bite out of the yellow pear.</p>

	<p>The pear wasn’t large, about the size of a man’s fist. When the sand mouse bit into it, almost half of the pear
		disappeared down the mouse’s throat. The fluids of the pear were rich, and a delicious smell permeated the air.
	</p>

	<p>The sand mouse wanted more, but before it could take another bite, its body got stiffened as if it were
		petrified, and it fell down from the tree.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the others were all shocked, and they didn’t dare to move forward after seeing the mouse’s reaction.
	</p>

	<p>The sand mouse fell on the ground, and there was yellow light coming out of its body. The original dark fur had
		seemed to have been dyed, and it became golden yellow.</p>

	<p>It looked like a lively golden sculpture.</p>

	<p>The light coming from the mouse’s body got denser and denser, and the golden light became purer and purer. The
		mouse’s lifeforce, however, became weaker and weaker.</p>

	<p>After a short while, the sand mouse became completely lifeless, and the light vanished. The mouse became a
		motionless golden sculpture.</p>

	<p>Han Sen and the others looked at each other, and none of them moved. Even Xu Mi, who had been craving the fruit,
		didn’t dare to touch it now.</p>

	<p>It seems that it isn’t entirely beneficial to eat that fruit. The king of mice might’ve eaten a fruit that is
		beneficial to its body, and that’s how it got so powerful. As for that sand mouse, it wasn’t so lucky. It seems
		that it made a bad choice, said Xu Mi, looking at the two and a half pears on the tree.</p>

	<p>“Can anyone tell which fruit is good and which is bad?” Lin Feng looked at everyone.</p>

	<p>“Dragon Chef, you know the most about this stuff. Can you tell?” Han Sen looked at the female cook. He couldn’t
		tell the differences between the three fruit.</p>

	<p>All the fruit looked good, and there was nothing unusual about them. Han Sen couldn’t see anything different
		about them other than their colors.</p>

	<p>Dragon Chef shook her head and said, “I’ve never seen fruit like this, and from my perspective, there’s nothing
		wrong with any of the fruit I just can’t figure out why the sand mouse had such a bad reaction after eating it.”
	</p>

	<p>The Dragon Chef couldn’t tell, even though she was an experienced cook, so Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu had no idea how
		to figure out which of the fruit were safe.</p>

	<p>The treasure was right in front of them, but none of them dared to take it.</p>

	<p>Han Sen walked around on the island, trying to find something that might help him. He was wearing a crystal shoe
		on his left foot. He hadn’t felt anything when he was in the water, but now that he was walking on the ground,
		his feet were unbalanced. Though it didn’t affect him much, he still felt weird walking like this.</p>

	<p>Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu had the same plan as Han Sen. They all walked around the island, and after walking around
		for a while, they found something.</p>

	<p>They walked around the fruit tree, and then they found that there was a line of characters on the trunk of the
		fruit tree, and they belonged to an ancient human language.</p>

	<p>“If there was no parting grief before the eye, I don’t believe men on earth would have white hair.” Lin Feng read
		the sentence out loud. Apparently, he had also studied ancient languages.</p>

	<p>“It seems that it’s been a long time since the characters were carved here, and the tree has grown deeply around
		the words. Unfortunately, we don’t know about the growth cycle of this tree, so we can’t tell when the carving
		was made”, said Jing Jiwu, frowning.</p>

	<p>“Which human demigod did this, and how did he come here so long ago? Did he eat the fruit?” Lin Feng wondered out
		loud.</p>

	<p>Both Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu assumed that the characters had been left by a human demigod. Though Han Sen also
		thought it was possible, he wasn’t as sure as the others.</p>

	<p>In the past few years, Han Sen had discovered that humans weren’t the only ones who used ancient human languages.
	</p>

	<p>“It must have been a woman who left these characters”, said the Dragon Chef, suddenly.</p>

	<p>“Why?” Han Sen and the others looked to the Dragon Chef, but they didn’t have any idea how she had come to the
		conclusion.</p>

	<p>The growth of the tree had changed the writing a little bit. The handwriting was still visible, and it was even
		very neat and regular, but it was difficult to tell whether the letters were beautiful or forceful, so it was
		difficult to tell whether they came from a woman or a man.</p>

	<p>“My natural instinct as a woman”, said the Dragon Chef.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t know how to react. “Women’s intuition” wasn’t accurate or reliable at all, and besides, the Dragon
		Chef wasn’t a woman but a female spirit.</p>

	<p>No matter where the handwriting came from, it was completely useless to Han Sen. Han Sen and the others searched
		the island carefully again, but they couldn’t find anything else.</p>

	<p>The sand mice were still trying to swim toward the island. Most of the ten thousand sand mice had sunk into the
		lake, and now, there were only a few dozen of them struggling to swim toward the island. The mice were still
		being dragged into the lake, so it was difficult to tell whether any other sand mice would make it.</p>

	<p>While everyone was thinking about what to do, Bao’er climbed up in the tree and took a bite of the green fruit.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen was completely shocked. He knew that Bao’er was exceptional, yet he was still worried. After all, they
		had almost no information on the fruit, so nobody could say for sure that Bao’er would be safe.</p>

	<p>Bao’er finished the green pear in three bites. Similar to a pear, the fruit didn’t have a stone inside. Bao’er
		swallowed the entire fruit.</p>

	<p>Bao’er licked her lips. It seemed that she still wanted more. However, green light shone from her body, and she
		fell from the tree, which terrified Han Sen.</p>
