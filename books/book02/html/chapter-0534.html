    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen&#8230;&#8221; Li Xing Lun was a little nervous. Judging
      from his knowledge of Blackgod, he knew his true intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s okay. If someone wants to give me the beast soul for
      free, I will gladly accept it. So it&#8217;s settled.&#8221; Han Sen
      stopped Li Xing Lun from talking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew that Li Xing Lun was trying to be nice, and he also
      understood Blackgod&#8217;s line of thought, but this went perfectly with
      his own idea. He and Tang Zhen Liu had been in training for a long time
      and they had 100% confidence in their ability to repel the Tornado Knife
      skill. It went well with their irritation at being unable to take care of
      Blackgod once and for all. But now he had delivered himself here, and Han
      Sen was extremely glad.
    </p>

    <p>
      He could also get his Inferno Bull back. Han Sen would not let this
      opportunity pass him by.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good! That was a quick decision; I think I&#8217;m starting to grow
      fond of you.&#8221; Blackgod laughed coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go to the plaza, this place is too open.&#8221; Han Sen said,
      equally coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good,&#8221; Blackgod replied, though he did not allow his men to
      leave. They surrounded Han Sen as they left for the plaza, as if they were
      escorting a dangerous criminal. They were unsure whether Han Sen would run
      off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun had also brought his own people to escort Han Sen. When they
      arrived at the plaza, Han Sen and Blackgod handed their beast souls over
      to Li Xing Lun.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Please,&#8221; Blackgod said, as he went onto the stage of the
      plaza, staring at Han Sen as he went.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ever since he had taken control of Blackgod Shelter, he had never been put
      at such a disadvantage. If he had the opportunity, he would relish killing
      Han Sen immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time, he did not want only the return of his beast soul - he wanted
      his life back too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod was highly confident in his Tornado Knife skill. He had battled
      with Han Sen once before, so he thought he knew the extent of his
      abilities. That is why the idea of combatting on-stage intimidated Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Word of the bet between Blackgod and Han Sen spread quickly, and drew
      quite the crowd to the Starwheel Shelter to observe it first-hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun began to feel hopeless. If Han Sen did not agree to the bet,
      he could still protect Han Sen and keep him safe inside the Starwheel
      Shelter. But if Blackgod managed to kill Han Sen, then there was nothing
      he could do but to adhere to the terms of the wager and provide the beast
      souls all to Blackgod.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once Han Sen was on-stage, Blackgod no longer felt no desire to exchange
      words with him. He wanted to bite into Han Sen&#8217;s flesh with a savage
      ferocity. He summoned the Black beast soul knife and started swiping at
      Han Sen with fierce desire.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen meanwhile summoned Ghost-Pawed Claws and returned an attack.</p>

    <p>
      The slashes looked shallow, but they made Blackgod furrow his brow. A
      strange look came from his hawkish eyes. If he continued to slash in that
      manner, his elbows were looking likely to be sliced off by the Ghost-Pawed
      Claws - he would be feeding the weapon of his enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeling hopeless, Blackgod could only pull back. After he dodged a swipe
      from Han Sen&#8217;s claws, he mustered another attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was confident in his Tornado Knife skill, though for others in the same
      class, it was incredibly rare to see someone block such an attack twice.
      It should be impossible for Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Numerous people thought the same thing as Blackgod, as his Tornado Knife
      skill as renowned across the ice fields, where it was known as &#8220;The
      Disappeared Demon Knife&#8221;.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people weren&#8217;t aware of who Han Sen was. Aside from Li Xing
      Lun, who did know him, they couldn&#8217;t fathom what sort of a person
      would willingly do battle with Blackgod.
    </p>

    <p>
      But quickly the audience&#8217;s eyes were opened. They could hardly
      believe what they were witnessing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod took a step back and dodged the Ghost-Pawed Claws. He took up his
      stance with the knife again and attempted to attack, but he had only
      raised his weapon half-way when he realized he couldn&#8217;t do what he
      had planned.
    </p>

    <p>
      As before, if he opened himself up with a wide attack, his waist would be
      exposed to the fury of the Ghost-Pawed Claws.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollarcidence?&#8221; Blackgod was stricken with worry, unable to
      believe what was happening. Nor could he believe that someone could so
      effectively block his Tornado Knife skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod took a step back and attacked again, his face distorted into an
      ugly grimace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod swiped toward Han Sen a dozen times, but none of the attacks made
      in a whirlwind of madness landed. His weapon had barely extended past
      halfway before he was forced to return it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod had no chance but to cast the Tornado Knife skill twice as fast,
      which made his face darken with anger. He had never faced something like
      this before, though he still thought it might just have been an unlucky
      day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people watching were already shocked. Those outside as well inside the
      arena could see quite clearly everything that was happening. The famous
      knife skill of Blackgod was utterly useless against Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t just useless in terms of effectiveness, but also that few
      attacks could be made due to Blackgod having to constantly return his
      weapon.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the sword Blackgod used had been a scabbard, he would only have been
      afraid that he would not even be given the opportunity to draw it at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every time Blackgod moved his waist to unsheathe a knife, the next moment,
      he would be forced to bring it back. No matter what he did, he
      couldn&#8217;t find any opportunity to draw his weapon.
    </p>

    <p>
      From head to foot, Blackgod kept backing off. Watching him was like
      viewing an apprentice trying to draw a knife out for the first time - or
      like training in front of a teacher, where the teacher can predict every
      move and strike a weak spot before his student even knew it was there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The &#8220;Disappearing Demon Knife, Tornado Knife skill&#8221; seemed to
      have all of a sudden become a total joke. Blackgod could not even draw his
      knife out, so there was no way he could attempt to attack twice as fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fall back&#8230; keep falling back&#8230; It seemed as if there were no
      choices other than to fall back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blackgod had never appeared so lame, so feeble, as at this very moment.
      The Tornado Knife skill that had given him a reputation suddenly looked
      utterly useless skill. He even started to feel like he had completely
      forgotten how to use a knife.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s so strong! Who is this person? It&#8217;s so scary!
      It&#8217;s like watching a father punish his own son!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Since when has the ice field harbored such a strong individual?
      Blackgod is getting beaten like despised child! Is this really Blackgod
      from Blackgod Shelter?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He must be a phony! How can Blackgod&#8217;s infernal knife be so
      useless?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s not that surprising! Have you ever heard of someone with
      a reputation they don&#8217;t deserve? Blackgod is like that. It&#8217;s
      only because he has so many diligent subordinates that people put stock in
      the claims he is great. But the man behind the curtain is nothing. When
      he&#8217;s on stage alone he gets beaten like a novice!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;But who is that other person?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Blackgod&#8217;s movement had been wholly restricted, and it was if he had
      become entangled within thorny vines. He couldn&#8217;t get a limb free,
      and if he moved even the smallest amount, he would be pricked by a lethal
      spike. Blackgod was dejected, and expressed his displeasure by crying out.
    </p>

    <p>
      And hearing the conversations from below the stage, he was so enraged that
      he felt faint.
    </p>

    <p>
      He screamed, and began waving his sword to attack without concern for his
      well-being. As he tried to strike, he realized that if he did not bring
      back his sword-wielding arm, it would be lopped off. So he swallowed his
      anger and forced himself to pull back yet again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hopeless. He felt hopeless. Blackgod was suddenly overwhelmed with the
      fear that he was going to die, and that his bladder would give way if he
      couldn&#8217;t reach a bathroom in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the few observers from Blackgod Shelter were shocked at what they
      were seeing. They were close to being unable to believe their eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      They clearly knew the strength and extent of Blackgod&#8217;s power, and
      the ferocity of his Tornado Knife&#8217;s skill ought to have made him
      unbeatable in the ice fields. How could it be suppressed in the way they
      were seeing?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Where did this guy come from?&#8221; Their faces were bursting with
      surprise. If Blackgod was already close to submission, they would end up
      in a far worse condition if they were to go on stage. Two or three hits
      would probably be enough to end their lives.
