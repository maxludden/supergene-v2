<p>“What is wrong with this woman? Does she have some sort of
grudge against me?” Han Sen was depressed.</p>
<p>Even the Dragon thought Han Sen had left Return Ruin Sea by now,
but Xius was still determined to find him. That was why he was so
depressed.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Xius, escaping Return Ruin Sea would have been
a much simpler affair.</p>
<p>“Does she know something about me claiming Purgatory Heaven? Is
that why she wishes to catch me so badly?” Han Sen thought that
would be impossible, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t really use Purgatory Heaven, so he had hidden
it in Planet Eclipse. No one knew about it, so he couldn’t think of
any way that it could have been discovered.</p>
<p>Xius rested in her room for a time, and Han Sen followed her.
Xius reclined on a deck chair to relax, but she didn’t go to sleep.
As she did, she stroked the Stone Cow’s head.</p>
<p>“Where is Han Sen hiding?” Han Sen was planning on resting, too,
but she suddenly started talking to herself.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to ask her why she was looking for him, but he
was unable to.</p>
<p>“Maybe he really did leave Return Ruin Sea, but that means it
will now be impossible to catch him. The Dragon and the Demon
cannot go to Sky Palace to capture him.” Xius continued speaking to
herself, trying to formulate a plan.</p>
<p>“Keep talking. Why do you want to catch me? Come on…” Han Sen
was desperate to know. Judging from the tone of her voice, there
had to be a reason why she wanted to find him so badly.</p>
<p>But Xius did not say anything more, and she just fell
asleep.</p>
<p>Han Sen was depressed, but he had no choice but to rest. He cast
a geno art to recover his power.</p>
<p>He was a Marquise, so he could transform into a Marquise class
being for a long time. It wasn’t unlimited, however. Han Sen
guessed that in his current state, he could last around four more
days. If he wasn’t able to escape by then, he’d be in trouble.</p>
<p>Seeing Xius’ determination, he knew she wasn’t going to stop her
search. He didn’t think he’d be able to escape in four days.</p>
<p>“If I cannot escape, then I will have to take a risk. I should
kidnap Dragon Nineteen and take her as a hostage. Or maybe I should
try to put pressure on Xius and threaten her to take me out of
here?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought Dragon Nineteen was very strong. The bodies of
the Dragon were impressive, and it would be hard to take her down
without drawing the attention of others.</p>
<p>Xius’ Gana body did not look weak, either. Although her power
wasn’t as flashy as a Dragon’s, she had many tricky geno arts. It
would be hard to keep her suppressed in secret, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that he should ultimately target Xius. Capturing
Dragon Nineteen would only make the Dragons want his head even
more.</p>
<p>But there were many elites within the Dragon race, and some of
them were deified. Even if he had a hostage, it wouldn’t be safe.
There was every chance he could be beaten before bringing the knife
across Dragon Nineteen’s throat.</p>
<p>Xius was different. She was alone within the Dragon. The Dragon
might not care too much about her life, and Xius might not risk her
life to save Dragon Nineteen.</p>
<p>Of the two, Han Sen thought Xius was flat-out simpler to get
to.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking about how he might avoid the attention of
the others on the ship if he captured Xius. There was no point in
capturing her, otherwise. He had to take her down quietly, and he
could not hurt her in a way that would draw the suspicion of the
other Dragon. He would need to use her to escape that place.</p>
<p>“It will be hard to threaten her without hurting her.” Han Sen
turned it over in his head for a while. Eventually, however, he
thought of a way.</p>
<p>A power like Teeth power could work, but if that power hurt her,
it would be seen. He couldn’t use it. Out of all Han Sen’s powers
that could take Xius without attracting attention, his best chance
was the Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>
<p>He could put a drop of his own crystal blood into Xius’s
bloodstream, and then, it would be very hard for her to separate
the two.</p>
<p>When Xius fell asleep, Han Sen looked at her hand. He only
needed to poke a hole in her finger and then put his own blood
inside. Then, it’d be done.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not hesitate, and he used his tongue to lick her
hand. A normal tongue would have been useless, but Han Sen had
practiced the art of Tongue Sword. It was no joke to get licked by
his tongue.</p>
<p>But before Han Sen could get close to her hand, Xius was already
looking at him. Han Sen’s heart jumped.</p>
<p>“This woman is tough! She has strong senses.” Han Sen’s eyes
opened wide, and he acted all cute. He kept on licking her hand,
just like Little Silver did.</p>
<p>When Xius saw Stone Cow being so cute, she smiled. She reached
her hand out to stroke his head.</p>
<p>Han Sen was glad that he hadn’t generated Tongue Sword just yet.
He was just trying out licking her right now. If he hadn’t tested
it, he would have exposed himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept rubbing Xius’s hand with his tongue. Xius did not
pull away, and Han Sen was able to continue licking her
fingers.</p>
<p>Han Sen licked her twice without using Tongue Sword, but on the
third time, when his tongue reached her fingers, the tongue
produced a red sword air. That red sword air went into Xius’
fingertip and expelled a drop of blood.</p>
<p>Xius reacted quickly, and when the red sword air touched her
finger, she hastily fell back. Then, her body glowed with holy
light.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt the halo on his neck tighten up. It was going to
break his neck.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I would calm down and talk about this.” Han Sen
released his Dongxuan Aura and blanketed the room. The voices and
the presences within were all locked down. He shapeshifted back
into his true self.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” Xius’ face changed. She never would have guessed that
the Stone Cow was Han Sen. She felt so embarrassed that Han Sen had
been licking her fingers only moments before.</p>
<p>“Don’t be mad. Look at your finger.” Han Sen pointed at her
injured finger as he spoke.</p>
<p>Xius looked down. She could feel a strange power overlapping her
middle finger. She used her own power against it, but she could not
stop that power’s movement.</p>
<p>Within a second, that power went rushing into her heart. Then,
it disappeared.</p>
