After being called for the first questioning, Han Sen was left alone by the Feathers.

Mister Tiger had been so scared. He didn’t dare meet-up with Han Sen again, in fear that the Feathers would suspect collusion. He wasn’t going to snitch on Han Sen, as he was still very fond of him. It was just a sensitive matter, and one that he couldn’t do anything about.

He was not allowed to leave Gran City, so any news concerning xenogeneics in the area was pointless. There were no xenogeneics in the city, only existed beyond its borders.

Han Sen spent his time practicing the Dongxuan Sutra, hoping to generate its geno armor.

Due to Jadeskin not having any further progression available, Han Sen could not practice it. If he wanted it to continue, he’d have to forge something first, but he didn’t have the time to do that.

Han Sen also searched for information regarding the Nine Life Cat on the internet. All he could learn was based on myth, and there was no mention about whether or not such a race existed. And where they originally lived, he was not told. If Han Sen wanted to locate the Nine-Life Cat, he didn’t know where to start So, Han Sen chose to focus on leveling up, first.

Han Sen could deal with Barons, no sweat. He was quite a high level in the western Gran City, but when compared to the universe at large, he was still rather weak.

Han Sen knew he most certainly could not deal with the Feather called Xina.

It was time for food, and Qiao was looking particularly tired that day. She didn’t say a word. She couldn’t hunt xenogeneics, and it was taking its toll.

As she ate, the doorbell rang. The auntie opened the door, and Lan Se came strolling in.

“Qiao, be careful. Do not go outside,” Lan Se quickly said to Qiao, coming right in.

“What’s going on?” Qiao raised her head to look at Lan Se, and she asked in confusion.

Han Sen and Bao’er looked at Lan Se, unsure what was happening.

“A great many outsiders have come to Gran City. They don’t look like they’re of a normal race, so something must be going on,” Lan Se said.

“It sounds to me as if something big is going to happen soon. I am curious why two small Feathers would visit this backwater city. They tried to steal our xenogeneic and got killed for it It’s all too weird. What is going on these days?” Qiao quietly said.

“No matter what it is, it’s definitely not something we can take part in. My supervisor ordered us not to provoke them. If something happened, I’m afraid our entire department won’t be able to stop it So, it’s best to stay home,” Lan Se said.

Qiao was looking more and more disheartened, and she said, “Han Sen can’t leave town now, anyway. We can’t do anything.”

After Lan Se left, Han Sen retreated into thought. He didn’t know what had happened to prompt a visit from so many outsiders, either.

“It is a shame I don’t have my usual intel. I have no clue about what is going on. Maybe there is something I can get out of it, though,” Han Sen thought to himself, wondering if he could grab an outsider and ask.

But thinking of that female Feather Xina, Han Sen quickly discarded the idea. If she knew he was up to something, it wouldn’t bode well.

Two days later, when Lan Se returned again, she looked terrible. She warned Qiao and Han Sen not to go out if it wasn’t absolutely necessary.

Qiao asked about what was happening, and Lan Se told them of a strange scene unfolding in Gran City. Many people were dying.

In an abandoned mine on the west side, a big hole had opened. It seemed bottomless. At night, however, there was the sound of a crying woman. And from that hole, a light would shine.

Many people were drawn there to take a look, but those who visited the place at night never returned. No bodies had been recovered, either.

It was only safe to go there during the daytime, when there was no curious light and no crying woman.

The security department sent a drone down into the hole, and for the first few hundred meters, there was only stone to see. But if the drone went deeper than a thousand meters, it would also disappear and be lost to recovery.

The supervisor had given orders to evacuate the place. The officers were warning residents to stay far away from the place.

The outsiders in the city had shown great interest in that place. They all showed up there now, mainly. Very infrequently were they seen scouring the city.

Two days later, more strange things were reported to have happened. The buildings near the hole suddenly collapsed, and all the scrap metal in the rubble was dragged into the hole.

Two days after again, even stranger things occurred. The cars around, the billboards, and everything else made of metal was drawn into that hole.

The western end of Gran City, even portions that were rather far from the hole, were affected by this. Pots and pans, knives and forks, whatever metal items there were, were drawn to the hole. It was like they were being pulled away by a magnet. The suction wasn’t very strong, but it caused panic in the city.

Han Sen was curious about the black hole, but he couldn’t figure out how he might go and see it.

In the world full of darkness, Littleflower was sitting on a bronze throne. There was a table before him, laden with fruit

“Holy Child, try this. It takes thirty thousand years to grow, and another thirty thousand years to mature. And it also takes thirty thousand to prepare the fruit. It tastes extra sweet.” A red beast was trying to feed Littleflower fruit.

Littleflower looked at the red fruit and seemed depressed. He said, “Jade King, I cannot eat. Can you help me?”

“You have to eat. You are growing up, so it is fine to eat a lot. And there is also an Empty Fruit that has been growing for the past billion years for you. There is also the Dragon Saliva fruit.” An evil-looking woman peeled the fruit, setting it down next to Littleflower. She smiled.

“Ah, Auntie. I cannot eat anymore.” Littleflower burped, and looked to be in pain as he rubbed his belly.

“If you cannot eat, then exercise. Eat again once you have digested what you’ve currently got. Old Vulture, it is your turn to teach him,” Auntie Mei spoke to a bird.

“Holy Child, let us begin.” Old Vulture flapped his wings and brought Littleflower to a plaza. He placed him down on the floor. Then, his black feathers turned into a dark rain of arrows, firing at the child.

Littleflower held his belly as he dodged the strikes. He looked very depressed.
