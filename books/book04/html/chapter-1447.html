      Han Sen brought Snow Ape to Shadow Shelter, feeling exuberantly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, Han Sen asked the creature many questions. Snow Ape was the
      heir of a super creature known as Daymoon Ape. After he was born, though,
      for reasons he never learned, he was unable to see his parents. Not long
      after that, Nan Litian captured him and brought him back to the shelter to
      conducts tests and experiments on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nan Litian did not expect to get so lucky and capture the baby of a super
      creature. But still, Snow Ape was actually a sacred-blood creature. Snow
      Ape claimed it was Sacred Blood because its blood may have been impure. Su
      Mianhua had taken much of his blood to run many tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been fortunate to escape captivity one day, while Nan Litian was
      away from the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, he got even luckier. He leveled up and his geno core became a
      super geno core. With such might and confidence, he planned to return one
      day to slay Nan Litian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, that was a long time ago. He was young when those
      atrocities were committed. He didn’t actually remember Nan Litian’s name,
      and neither did he remember what he looked like. He only remembered a vow
      he made long ago, and that was to kill the master of Shadow Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt relieved he had narrowly avoided being the ape’s target, and
      he thought to himself, “It’s lucky Qing Le came when he did. If he hadn’t,
      this big ape would be out for my blood instead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Snow Ape didn’t sound like a bad person, though. He was very grumpy, but
      he wanted to keep his rampage focused on the person he vowed to kill. He
      didn’t want to kill anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      They traveled back to Shadow Shelter, and when Snow Ape’s eyes saw it,
      they turned red. The ape cried aloud, “This is the shelter!”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Snow Ape attempted to run right for the shelter. But Han Sen
      stopped him first and said, “Mister, don’t go yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not? Are you going to try and stop me?” Snow Ape stared at Han Sen
      with anger, as if he—rightfully—knew the human would be unable to stop
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, not at all. But you don’t know what his face looks like. If you go in
      with such bluster, you’ll frighten everyone. And the master is sly, so he
      will probably blend in with the terrified crowds and not admit to being
      the one you’re looking for,” Han Sen quickly explained.
    </p>
    <p>“That makes sense.” Snow Ape groaned.</p>
    <p>
      “How about you hide your strength, like you did earlier, and come back
      there with me? I’ll help you find the master, and once he admits his
      identity, you can go right on ahead and kill him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      On the inside, Han Sen thought to himself, “I killed Nan Litian and
      already got you your vengeance. Now you can return the favor and help me
      get rid of Qing Le.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Snow Ape heard what Han Sen told him, he replied, “Good thinking.
      Take me to the *sshole so I can kill him.”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen nodded and brought the Snow Ape straight to the spirit hall.</p>
    <p>
      Qing Le was having a meeting in the spirit hall at the time. He was
      sitting upon the throne, gobbling up all the geno fruit Cheap Sheep and
      Green Cow had been delivering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadow Shelter was better developed that he believed it to be. He thought
      he could rake in quite a lot of profits with this place under his control;
      it was a concept that perked up his mood quite a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden, someone unwelcome entered the hall. Qing Le thought it
      might have been a Metal Eater, but it wasn’t. It was Han Sen, and at his
      side was a white ape.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen? What are you doing here?” Han Sen was useless to Qing Le now, so
      he was going to spare all his courtesies and niceties.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re asking me why I’m here? Why are you sitting there?” Han Sen asked,
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why? Because I am the master of this shelter.” Qing Le spoke very
      cockily, gesturing with his arms that the entire place belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words were perfect. Han Sen was delighted to hear him say that, as
      he expected he’d have to say a lot more to get the spirit to admit it.
      Qing Le was so arrogant, he jumped right into the admittance. It rendered
      Han Sen’s prepared speech useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You really are the master of this shelter?” Snow Ape did not make a move
      yet, and just tried to suppress his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I’m not, who else is? You?” Qing Le did not have Dongxuan Aura, so he
      couldn’t tell how incredibly strong the Snow Ape really was. Thinking him
      average, and knowing no other creature there could stop him, he was
      fearless.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen heard this, he again felt relief. And he thought to himself,
      “Qing Le, you just played yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After this answer, Snow Ape kicked up a display of wrath before Qing Le.
      His gold claws immediately came down on the spirit’s head.
    </p>
    <p>Qing Le was shocked, and he quickly shouted, “Gah! Who are you?!”</p>
    <p>
      The ape snorted and answered, “I am the little ape you once captured and
      drained the blood of. I am here to exact my revenge!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Qing Le was confused, but before he could plead his innocence, the Snow
      Ape tore the spirit in half. His blood coated the spirit hall red. He had
      no chance of fighting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qing Le was a spirit that obeyed Outer Sky Shelter. His spirit stone was a
      part of his body, just like Moment Queen’s. He could put his spirit stone
      in the spirit statue, but he’d still be unable to revive.
    </p>
    <p>Now that Snow Ape had ripped him apart, he was gone for good.</p>
    <p>
      Snow Ape was still extremely angry. He repeatedly pounded the ground and
      smashed the guts and limbs of the lifeless spirit into mush, over and
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor guy. How dare you pretend to be Cheap Sheep’s boss.” Han Sen looked
      at what remained of Qing Le and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were frozen. Qing Le was a powerful royal
      spirit, and he had just been torn to pieces in a flash. He didn’t even
      stand a chance of fighting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures and spirits that had arrived there for the meeting saw the
      messy leftovers of what had transpired, and they were brought to shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      After killing Qing Le, the ape turned around and left. He did not fancy
      staying there a second longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen reminded him, “Be careful. He obeyed Outer Sky Shelter, and if
      they find out he was killed by your hands, they will come after you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll kill whatever comes my way.” Snow Ape spoke with anger as he slowly
      walked off.
