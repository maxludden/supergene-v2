<h3>Chapter 1909</h3>

<p>Han Sen started running out of the lodge. The man might be
lying, but it was better to run than risking everything by
remaining. If Han Sen was transported to another star system,
that’d be pretty bad.</p>
<p>When he made it some distance away, Han Sen turned around to
face the man and ask, “What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Left Crazy,” the man answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to ask something more, but he felt the mountain
begin to shake. Without hesitation, he said goodbye and hastily
departed the mountain.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With the speed of his rabbit shoes aiding his flight, Han Sen
was able to just about get off the mountain before hearing that
deafening sound. The mountains all around were vibrating like mad,
and when Han Sen turned back around to face where the mountain had
been, he saw nothing. It was as if the mountain did not exist.</p>
<p>“How did that mountain move so quickly? I thought the man said
that rocks were slow.” Cold sweat dripped off Han Sen’s forehead.
It was fortunate he had moved as fast as he had. If he hadn’t, he’d
have been long gone.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a gander at the book he had been given by Left
Crazy. There was no name, and it had all been written by hand.</p>
<p>“Petrify? That sounds so lame. It sounds like a skill that can
make your skin as hard as stone,” Han Sen thought, as he started to
read the text.</p>
<p>But as he read, his expression turned to surprise. The skill was
called petrify, and while the name was lame, the contents were
impressive.</p>
<p>It was a complete geno art. From commoner to Baron, from
Viscount to King, all could practice and become proficient with it.
It had its own power.</p>
<p>Practicing Petrify did not make your body harder, though. It
would just make your body closer to that of the rocky creatures.
Grystallizers were like hurrmns, so they couldiVt become like rocks
completely. “The higher your petrification was, the closer to the
life of a rock you’d attune.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t become completely the same as a rock, you’d only
adopt some of their attributes. Petrify made humans and
crystallizers petrified. It gave them the life of a rock.</p>
<p>Petrify couldn’t make someone impervious to death, but time had
more difficulty leaving its marks on petrified bodies. Thousands of
years result in many humans and crystallizers dying, but to a rock,
it was only a moment. It did not affect them.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined the requirements for bringing Petrify up to
King class, if that was what he chose to do. At that point, he
would have a life that was very similar to a rock’s. And with a
body like that, many millions of years could come and go without
affecting him.</p>
<p>There was one significant flaw to Petrify, though. When you used
it, your body really would turn to stone. You’d be unable to move
because of it. And your mind would still be there, active, too. The
more you practiced the skill, the closer to the life of a rock you
would get.</p>
<p>“It sounds really cool, but it seems fairly useless. You’d only
turn into a rock, and rocks aren’t hard enough to provide great
protection. And you can’t move, either. Why would that guy bother
creating this skill?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen was able to come up with a useful
application for it.</p>
<p>“If I can practice while petrified, then time would be of no
issue for me. I could just keep practicing without eating or
drinking.”</p>
<p>In that case, Petrify might be really useful. He planned to
learn it, thinking it might come in handy.</p>
<p>Petrify was a geno art that allowed for the swapping of genes.
It did not make your body better. You still needed a strength like
The Story of Gene as a basis.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it was a crystallizer geno art, so he used The
Story of Genes to practice with it.</p>
<p>Han Sen found a safe cave to take refuge in, where he could
practice Petrify. It was easier to learn than he expected. After
casting it once, his skin started to feel rocky. Already, Han Sen
could tell that he had learned the first tier of Petrify.</p>
<p>“Hmm, that was much easier than I thought it’d be.” Han Sen then
moved on to try the second tier. It was a Baron class Petrify.</p>
<p>Han Sen finished Baron Petrify easily, too. He kept on going,
and he realized that Petrify really was exceptionally easy to
learn. He only spent two days practicing with it to get it all the
way up to King class.</p>
<p>After reaching King class, he noticed Left Crazy had not written
anything more. That was likely due to the fact he had yet to reach
that level. He guessed that after the King level, you could
actually become petrified.</p>
<p>Without a skill that would teach him how to proceed, Han Sen
decided to try other things.</p>
<p>If he became a rock and was unable to return to a human form,
then his life would be over.</p>
<p>“Why is it like that? According to Left Crazy, you had to reach
a certain level before practicing such a skill. So, why did nothing
stop him from reaching King class? Is it because of The Story of
Genes?” Han Sen guessed a number of things, but he wasn’t sure
enough to put stock in anything.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried using his Petrify, and he learned other geno arts
could not be practiced as long as it was in use. That was because
Petrify made a big change to the body. Geno arts for the human body
were useless. Only The Story of Genes could run while he was in a
petrified state.</p>
<p>“This geno art is so weird. Although it can take you to a very
high level, its usefulness is practically nonexistent.” Losing
interest in Petrify, Han Sen decided to return to practicing with
the Dongxuan Sutra.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained in the mountains for an entire month. He fought
and practiced with his Dongxuan Sutra a great amount. Dongxuan
Sutra was on the precipice of breaking through, but it had yet to
do so.</p>
<p>There were ten days left before the red mist spring erupted.
After realizing this, Han Sen decided it was time to leave the
mountains and head to the spring. His Spell Geno Armament required
this spring so it could become a Viscount. He couldn’t afford to
miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>Before long, Han Sen was right outside Red Mist Valley. There
were hordes of xenogeneics wandering around, and it was clear they
had all come there for the red mist spring, as well.</p>
<p>They all hung outside the valley. None of them had entered the
mist yet. They were waiting for the spring to erupt.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. The xenogeneics there were Baron or
Viscount. There were no higher level sorts.</p>
<p>Yisha told Han Sen that the red mist spring only worked for
Viscounts. It would be ineffective on those of a higher level, so,
there was no point in high class xenogeneics coming.</p>
