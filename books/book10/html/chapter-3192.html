<h2>God Chaos Party Old Nest</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3192</h3>

<p>When Han Sen returned to the Feng family castle, he felt a bit
depressed. The xuan holy turtle was good stuff. It was a rare gene
race. It was just that it was a newborn baby that had recently
hatched. It had a scary level of defense. After combining with it,
one had a xuan holy body. It enabled the body’s strength to
increase and gave it a shake-back power.</p>
<p>The xuan holy turtle was good at everything. The only problem
was the fact the xuan holy turtle used earth elemental powers. It
did not go well with the Dongxuan Sutra or Jadeskin. Therefore, it
could not be used with the reverse gene races of those two
skills.</p>
<p>Han Sen was wondering if God Hall Leader was enacting payback
for his behavior in the god fights. While giving him a decent
reward might have seemed great, it was basically God Hall Leader
giving him a gene race Han Sen had no use for. It made Han Sen feel
terrible.</p>
<p>“It looks like I will have to go to that buffer zone. Otherwise,
getting rare gene races will be too difficult,” Han Sen said with a
sigh. He still used the black crystal armor to evolve the xuan holy
turtle.</p>
<p>Although he could not use it as a reverse gene race, it was
still Han Sen’s first rare gene race. If he was able to find a God
Spirit Blood-Pulse that went well with it, he could level it up as
a God Spirit gene race. It would at least be useful in some
capacity.</p>
<p>Seeing the xuan holy turtle in his Sea of Soul swallow the black
crystal armor, it turned into a black orb. Han Sen remembered the
things God Hall Leader told him.</p>
<p>According to the theories of God Hall Leader, the powers to
break the world were called Break World. Not many elites were
actually able to use Break World. God Chaos Party’s leader was one
such individual, and Qin Xin was barely half of that, but others
couldn’t.</p>
<p>The reason Qin Xiu was only half of that was that he used a
glitch in the world to access the geno universe. He did not use his
own power to accomplish that.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unable to break the world. The reason he was able to
go to the universe of kingdoms was because of World God King’s
power.</p>
<p>The Super God Spirit mode was strong, but he could not use it to
break into another world. Han Sen had only just reached the Break
World level. He was practically a beginner. He was still far away
from the real Break World level.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen was not just able to break the world. Even God
Chaos Party’s leader, who was the vice-president of the God Chaos
Party in the past, was unable to reach a Break World level.</p>
<p>When there was a big fight and the universe had to be rebooted,
the world was fractured with glitches. Now, God Chaos Party’s
leader was planning to use those glitches to make a tunnel that
would enable access to the other universe.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how forging a path between the worlds would
benefit the God Chaos Party, so he asked about it.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader looked at Han Sen, licked his lips, and said,
“The two are made from opposites. To the geno universe, the
universe of kingdoms is the anti-material world. To the universe of
kingdoms, the geno universe is the anti-material world. That means
to one universe, the other can be considered hell. When the tunnel
between both worlds opens, the creatures of these two universes can
go between the universes. That would be like demons from hell
crawling into the ordinary world. The two universes would be in
chaos.”</p>
<p>Han Sen rubbed his nose. He knew God Hall Leader meant he was a
demon, and he had nothing to defend himself against that claim.
Since he had been in the universe of kingdoms, he hadn’t exactly
done anything positive.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader also told Han Sen the creatures of the universe
of kingdoms would have an extremely hard time when trying to
practice Break World powers. If the two worlds were to be opened,
there would be many creatures like Han Sen or Qin Xiu appearing who
could easily learn Break World powers. The God Chaos Party wanted
to absorb those creatures.</p>
<p>If that situation did come to pass, there would be too many
Break World people appearing. Even God Spirits would be unable to
maintain control of the world. The aftermath would undoubtedly be
something quite severe. Fortunately, for now, the world had
glitches. Breaking the worlds would not be easy. The God Chaos
Party was only in the initial stages of planning. Putting aside if
it would work, if they wanted to break through it and did work, it
would take a billion years to punch through a hole in the fabric of
the universe.</p>
<p>The God Hall Leader did not really expect Han Sen to be capable
of destroying the God Chaos Party. He only wanted Han Sen to give
the God Chaos Party some trouble.</p>
<p>After rebooting, the two universe’s buffer zones had been torn
to shreds. Each layer did not connect. The Outer Sky, which
belonged to the Very High, was just one layer. It was the one that
was the closest to the geno universe.</p>
<p>There were 33 buffer zones in existence, similar to that of the
Outer Sky. They were in places God Spirits were unable to occupy.
It was dangerous for God Spirits to venture to such places.</p>
<p>Because the two universes had a space between them, the geno
hall and the god temple palaces would be unable to work. If the God
Spirits died there, they would be unable to respawn in their god
temples.</p>
<p>According to the news he had received in the past, the God Chaos
Party had broken seven layers near the universe of kingdoms. It
would still take them a long time to break through the rest. Now,
the seven layers were all occupied by the God Chaos Party. If God
Spirits entered such a place, they would have to be careful. It had
been a long time since news of their progress had been
received.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader was saying he wanted Han Sen to get in there and
kill as many members of the God Chaos Party as he was able to. If
he was unable to kill them, he could at least harvest some
information. That way, he could find out how many layers the God
Chaos Party had managed to breakthrough.</p>
<p>God Hall Leader promised that if Han Sen delivered him accurate
news, he could give Han Sen a very special and rare gene race.
Apparently, Han Sen was going to love it.</p>
<p>It was a tempting proposition, but the territory of the God
Chaos Party was not the sort of place one could freely waltz into.
The only thing Han Sen had on his side was that the two universe’s
powers would not be suppressed when inside a buffer zone. By being
there, Han Sen could use all of his powers and not be
restricted.</p>
<p>Of course, what tempted Han Sen even more was the god temples of
the God Chaos Party’s members. By destroying god temples, he could
get more god bases. No one wanted fewer god bases.</p>
<p>Han Sen had asked God Hall Leader why the members of the God
Chaos Party were not called God Spirits despite them having god
temples and god bases. The God Hall Leader did not answer him. He
just told Han Sen how to get there.</p>
<p>Han Sen was interested to see it. Before that, he wanted to see
the Qin Kingdom’s alpha temple.</p>
<p>“The Qin Kingdom must have had people who could break the world.
Let’s not mention anyone else, but Jian Bu Gu must have been a
Break World elite. My powers are restricted by the universe.
Breaking an alpha temple would be difficult.” Han Sen kept
thinking. He still planned on sneaking into the alpha temple to
have a look.</p>
<p>To prevent trouble pursuing him, Han Sen went looking for Qin
Bai. He planned to take Qin Bai with him to the alpha temple.
Having the Qin Kingdom’s future king Qin Bai there could make a big
problem become a very small problem if he was discovered. He could
turn a very small problem into not a problem at all. He could avoid
a lot of unnecessary troubles.</p>
<p>“Qin Bai, is Bao’er at home?” When Qin Bai went to the Feng
family castle, he did not go inside. He asked his men to bring Han
Sen out. He looked angry.</p>
<p>“I am playing in the garden with Feng Yin Yin,” Han Sen said
with a smile. “If the crown prince wants her, then I can go get
her.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no.” Qin Bai’s face turned white as he pulled Han
Sen.</p>
