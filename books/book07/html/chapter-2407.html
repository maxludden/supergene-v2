<h3>Chapter 2407</h3>

<p>Fox Queen wanted to go to Planet Water Zone immediately to see
if Han Sen had managed to get the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror from
Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>But Bai Canglang had something he needed her to do, so she
didn’t have time to go to Planet Water Zone yet. In order to
protect her cover identity, she had to suppress her impatience for
the time being.</p>
<p>But Fox Queen couldn’t stop thinking about how Han Sen had
activated the Sacred Blood Statue, yet somehow managed to survive.
She couldn’t figure out how he had pulled that off.</p>
<p>Long ago, Sacred Leader used the Sacred Blood Statue to control
subordinates. Even his deified soldiers were subject to it. And the
Sacred Blood Statue on Han Sen’s back had been drawn in Ancient
Blood Dragon Lady’s blood. That sort of Sacred Blood Statue was
reserved for use against deifieds. Han Sen was just a Duke. He
wasn’t even a King yet, so how could he survive?</p>
<p>Fox Queen was very confused, but it would be a while before she
could travel to Planet Water Zone and find answers to her
questions.</p>
<p>After Han Sen returned to Underwater Town, he began researching
the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. He couldn’t discover anything unique
about it. He put power into it, but he couldn’t seem to activate
the item. His only option was to drip his blood onto the stone
mirror in the hope that it would come to acknowledge him as its
master further down the line.</p>
<p>Every time Han Sen placed his blood upon the stone mirror, it
would light up with the shadow of the Nine-Tailed Fox. When the
shadow disappeared, the blood would go with it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was trying to use the same method he had with the Jade
Drum, but it didn’t seem to be working.</p>
<p>“Did King Bao put the Foxes’ Nine Spin Destiny Mirror in
Destiny’s Tower and place it beneath that statue? If so, why would
he do that?” Han Sen couldn’t come up with any answers to that
question.</p>
<p>The stone mirror wasn’t making any progress, and for the moment,
there didn’t seem to be anything Han Sen could do about that. The
water fairy in the jade gourd was helping Han Sen grow stronger,
though. She embodied the feelings of the Proud Bone Swordmind for
him, and as a result, Han Sen felt as if his own swordmind was
about to have a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t copy Mad Sword’s swordmind, though. He used his
own swordmind to fight with Mad Sword’s. At first the fights were
entirely one-sided, but after a while, Han Sen started to develop
some resistance.</p>
<p>Mad Sword’s swordmind wasn’t suitable for Han Sen, so he didn’t
plan on using it directly. Instead, he used it as a grinding stone,
sharpening his own swordmind against it.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how strong Mad Sword’s swordmind is; it isn’t
my own. It would only belong to me if I could fully understand it.”
Although improvements like this were much slower than if he were to
simply copy Mad Sword’s swordmind, Han Sen wasn’t in any particular
rush. He focused on each aspect of his swordmind, improving it a
piece at a time.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had many King class core genes, and he had one
hundred King class xenogeneic genes, he would need many more in the
coming days. So, Han Sen still planned on going back to the core
area to hunt for more core genes. It was always good to have more
in the shed, after all.</p>
<p>If Han Sen’s guess was correct, one hundred King class
xenogeneic genes might raise his King area by one tier.</p>
<p>Han Sen pushed his self-cogwheel to enter the core area again.
He returned to the location where he had left, which wasn’t too far
from Planet Dark Zone.</p>
<p>Han Sen wouldn’t dare visit Planet Dark Zone again. Until he had
enough strength, provoking that weird insect would basically mean
committing suicide. His super god body didn’t make him invincible,
and the time limit was always a headache.</p>
<p>“Once I become deified, will I be able to use an infinite amount
of super god spirit body?” Han Sen wondered as he flew.</p>
<p>“Dollar, what a coincidence. Are you interested in cooperating
again?” Han Sen hadn’t been flying for long when a group of people
approached him. It was Dragon One, Dragon Eight, and some other
Dragons.</p>
<p>But Dragon One and Dragon Eight were the only Dragons who had
survived their last venture. The Dragons accompanying them now were
new.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t answer. From another direction, a second group of
people was swiftly approaching. The leader of that bunch was Dia
Robber. As he flew closer, he said, “If you guys are cooperating,
might it be okay if we join?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He had only just entered the core area, and
these two had already found him. This couldn’t be a
coincidence.</p>
<p>“People, I am flattered. But I was hoping to venture out alone
this time. Maybe another time?” Han Sen said, rejecting their
offers politely. He didn’t know what they were after, and he didn’t
want to fight with them.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned to leave, but Dia Robber immediately said, “If
you don’t wish to work with us, that’s fine. But I have a few
mutant King class xenogeneics to go after. Are you interested in
taking a look?”</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped. It took time to find mutant xenogeneics, so
being able to travel straight to them would be a great help for Han
Sen’s leveling. If they were killing mutants, Han Sen could gain
the xenogeneics’ talents without needing to practice them.</p>
<p>“Not bad, not bad. I have a lead on a few mutant xenogeneics, as
well. If you are interested, you know the rules and shares,” Dragon
One then said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very tempted by both offers. If things really were
as they said, killing a few mutant xenogeneics would be very
beneficial for Han Sen. Plus, he would be getting fifty percent of
the spoils from the entire fight, not just what he personally
killed. And there would be no need to spend time seeking the
xenogeneics out. Opportunities like this were hard to come by.</p>
<p>After a brief period of silent thought, Han Sen still turned
down both offers. If he chose a side now, he would only end up
offending the other.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried about offending others, but in this case,
it was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Since Han Sen hadn’t agreed, they still wouldn’t be able to kill
those mutant xenogeneics by themselves. They would need Han Sen’s
help in the future, anyway. Perhaps he could receive more benefits
like this later on.</p>
<p>Dragon One and Dia Robber seemed to expect Han Sen to turn them
down, so they didn’t appear to be disappointed. They still spoke to
Han Sen with glee and respect, hoping they could cooperate again in
the near future.</p>
<p>“Why are you so nice to him? Do you think the Destroyed need a
King like him?” Barr asked once Han Sen had left.</p>
<p>Dia Robber was one of the few people that could make Barr
listen. If Dia Robber wasn’t there, he would have fought Han Sen.
It wasn’t that Barr didn’t like Han Sen; he just enjoyed fighting
powerful people.</p>
<p>Dia Robber nodded with sincerity, and he said, “Yes, we really
need someone like him.”</p>
<p>Seeing Barr fall silent, Dia Robber sighed and said, “We need
him because he is stronger than us. Sure, the deified members of
our race are stronger than he is, but that matters little because
they can’t enter the core area.”</p>
<p>“If they cannot come, then they cannot come. What’s the big
deal?” Barr grunted in annoyance.</p>
<p>Dia Robber smiled and said, “There is no big deal. But if we
want to kill deified core xenogeneics in the core area, then we
need him. Do you think our Destroyed Kings could escape a deified
xenogeneic the way Dollar did?”</p>
<p>“If they didn’t have an area power to restrict strength, an
ordinary deified xenogeneic couldn’t kill me,” Barr said.</p>
<p>“You are the best King we have, but hunting deified xenogeneics
with just you and I would be an impossible task. We might succeed,
but we would sacrifice a lot. With Dollar’s help, that can change.
The success rate would be higher, and we wouldn’t sacrifice as
much. What is the harm in that?” Dia Robber asked, shaking his
head.</p>
