“I think it was just a coincidence,” Han Sen said with a shrug.

Thousand Feather Crane did not believe in coincidences, but these things happened around Han Sen often. He was used to that.

“I think I’ll go up and take a look at another floor.” Han Sen signaled to Thousand Feather Crane and the others, then headed for the fifth floor.

On the fifth floor, there were only Marquise students. Jade Spirits worked for those of the Marquise class, as well. And many people of the Marquise class frequented this floor to kill Jade Spirits. There were a few Marquise students in front of every Jade Spirit.

When the Jade Spirit emerged, no one would run forward. It all depended on who the Jade Spirit chose to go for. Stealing was forbidden in the White Jade Building.

This was why Sky Palace had to control the number of people that could enter White Jade Jing. Resources were limited, and there were already too many students that needed what was available.

Without pause, Han Sen went straight to the sixth floor. There were many Sky there, and each picture had two or three Marquise students before it.

On the seventh floor, there were significantly fewer people. There were only five or six Marquises in total. Han Sen knew one of them, and that was Lone Bamboo who had leveled up to Marquise during the exam.

Lone Bamboo saw Han Sen and waved him over. He wanted to see him. Han Sen hadn’t expected Lone Bamboo to want to talk, so he walked up to him with surprise.

“Do you have time after you’re done in the White Jade Jing?” Lone Bamboo asked.

“I suppose. What do you need?” Han Sen looked at Lone Bamboo with confusion.

“Are you interested in going to Rainbow Cloud Peak to hunt a Cloud Beast?” Lone Bamboo got down to brass tacks immediately.

“I am interested in hunting xenogeneics, but if we’re going together, the xenogeneics won’t stand a chance.” Han Sen laughed.

Lone Bamboo smiled and said, “A Cloud Beast has been in Rainbow Cloud Peak for millions of years. Up until now, no one has been able to capture it. I would like to tame it for a mount. You can come, if you are interested. Whoever claims it, owns it.”

“No way. If that many Sky Palace elites have failed to capture it, how do you think we’ll be able to?” Han Sen thought about Yu Shanxin. He did not believe there was a xenogeneic out there that man couldn’t have handled.

If there really was something beyond that man’s strength, Han Sen didn’t think he stood a chance.

The resources of Sky Palace have to be protected, and because of this, only Marquise Teachers can enter Rainbow Cloud Peak. The rule is intended to prevent a Duke or King from just entering and killing all the xenogeneics there. In all these years, no one has been able to slay the Cloud Beast,” Lone Bamboo said casually.

That means the Cloud Beast has been in luck. If we both go, it’s going to end up calling us daddy.” Han Sen laughed.

“I don’t know if it will call me daddy, but I’m sure it will kneel.” Lone Bamboo said seriously.

“Alright!” Han Sen nodded. He asked Lone Bamboo for some more information concerning the Cloud Beast, and after hearing it all, he thought the Cloud Beast sounded similar to the Cloud Beast Han Sen had seen in the sanctuary.

Han Sen had many little cloud beasts before, and he had always wanted the beast soul of a super class little cloud beast. It was a shame he never managed to get one.

“I wonder if this Cloud Beast can drop me a beast soul? Even if it does, though, it’s bound to look different than the beast souls I got in the sanctuaries,” Han Sen thought.

Han Sen looked around the seventh floor. Many of the paintings had no one in front of them. Han Sen selected an image of a Jade Fairy and then sat down.

Han Sen waited until the Jade Air came out and the Jade Fairy spirit flew down from the wall. Just as it had on the fourth floor, it entered Han Sen’s body as if it was seeking to possess him. It was inside Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen felt a chill. This one was much stronger than the spirit on the fourth floor. If Han Sen did not have his Jadeskin, he knew he wouldn’t have been able to stand what he was now forced to endure.

Han Sen ran his Jadeskin like mad, and his cells felt as if they were undergoing individual explosions. When the cold air was suppressed by Jadeskin, the Jade Fairy Spirit re-emerged from his body. It turned into a Jade Fairy Spirit Orb right in front of him.

Han Sen grabbed the orb but did not refine it. He walked to another Jade Fairy Spirit painting, and when he was in front of it, another Jade Fairy Spirit came out. It went into Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen refined another Jade Fairy Spirit while the Jade Air was still active. All the while, the other students were still trying to refine their first. No one had done so yet.

“Jadeskin is really helpful in the White Jade Jing. My Jadeskin is just Earl class, and even so, I can refine these Jade Spirits so easily. If I level up to Marquise class, I can earn myself a whole plethora of them.” Han Sen felt cocky as he walked over to another Jade Spirit painting.

Because there were no more Jade Fairy Spirit paintings, however, Han Sen had to select a White Jade Tiger to sit in front of.

Roar! A tiger’s roar rocked his soul, and it almost made him cough up blood.

Han Sen thought it would be easily refined like the Jade Fairy Spirits, but he did not expect it to throw his blood into turmoil. Fortunately, Han Sen had a strong will. He didn’t freak out. He concentrated and put his blood back into his veins. Then, he used all the power he could to refine the White Jade Tiger.

It was a spirit that was generated by Jade Air, and yet Han Sen found it difficult to refine. It was not half as easy as the Jade Fairy Spirits were.

The White Jade Tiger kept roaring in front of him, and it made his head buzz. He almost expected his nose to start bleeding.

When Han Sen finally suppressed the White Jade Tiger, he opened his eyes and the Jade Air was gone. The students were gone, also. Only Lone Bamboo remained, waiting for him.

The White Jade Tiger had become a Jade Tiger Spirit Orb. After Han Sen put it away, he asked Lone Bamboo, “What time is it?”

“The White Jade Jing shut down five hours ago,” Lone Bamboo answered.

Han Sen was shocked. It had taken him less than half an hour to suppress two Jade Fairy Spirits, but he had spent seven hours to do a sole White Jade Tiger.

But the White Jade Tiger’s Jade Air was less than the Jade Fairy Spirit. That meant the Jade Fairy Spirit aligned with his Jadeskin a whole lot more. That was why they were so easily refined. The White Jade Tiger and Jadeskin did not go well together, and that was why it had been so difficult.
