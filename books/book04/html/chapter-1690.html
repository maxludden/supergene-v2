    <p>1690 Laboratory</p>
    <p>
      Old Cat was shocked. He leaped down from the tablet and ran toward Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the glove had pulled him away too quickly, and by the time Old Cat
      reached the spot Han Sen had been in, he was gone. There were some broken
      buildings and paths ahead, but Old Cat wasn’t sure which one Han Sen had
      taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat stopped. He looked around and sniffed what he could before
      deciding on a trail to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had been dragged deeper into the ruins by the glove. His legs were
      simply dragging, leaving two trenches in the ground for a wake. Still,
      nothing stopped the force that pulled him along.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taken into a broken building, and after a few twists and turns, the
      glove drilled into another building’s entrance that was half-buried by
      rubble.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark inside there, and Han Sen couldn’t tell what was around him.
      He felt very nervous, though, being dragged in the way he was. But that
      nervousness did not lead to panic. He’d been through a lot, and he’d had a
      lot of experience with dire and uncertain situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen fumbled around the dark with his free fist and hit something. The
      item was shattered, whatever it was, but the glove did not stop pulling
      him onwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke a few more items after that, but eventually, the glove stopped.
    </p>
    <p>The place was dark and still. There wasn’t a sound to be heard.</p>
    <p>
      The glove was ahead of Han Sen, and then it jerked him forward and up so
      that he was standing up straight
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why did this thing stop here? Is there another glove here?” Han Sen
      wondered to himself. He swung his left hand and ignited a flame upon it to
      use as a torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of Han Sen was a dried-up corpse that was staring right at Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Argh!” Han Sen screamed, wanting to fall back. But the glove held him
      firmly, and no matter how he tried to resist and move away, his arm
      remained still.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen calmed-down from the sudden surprise, he noticed it wasn’t
      moving. There was no lifeforce, and it was very dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body was sitting on a chair, with its clothes all rotten and its skin
      dry. It was very complete, though, and it looked like some zombie in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked around and noticed it was a crystallizer room. There were
      crystallizer tools everywhere, far more than he had seen in the main
      control room. It made Han Sen feel as if he was standing in a lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the tools, though, Han Sen spied the presence of a number of
      crystal containers. They were full of liquid, and things were soaking
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were animals, livestock, plants, even things Han Sen had never seen
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it just as Old Cat said? Is this a greenhouse? A laboratory in their
      base?” Han Sen thought. But then, his right hand moved, and it started to
      drag him forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was being brought towards the dead body that was slumped in a
      chair. The glove began feeling around the corpse, as if it was searching
      for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shit! Is this thing a necrophiliac?” Han Sen felt depressed, but
      fortunately, nothing really messed up occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, the right hand found something inside a tattered pocket. It
      pulled it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because his hand was being controlled, though, Han Sen was unable to see
      what it was. Then the hand returned to his chest, Han Sen felt like he
      could control it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Han Sen could feel himself holding something hard like a chestnut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took a peek and was shocked. It was like a seed, and it was
      smaller than a ping-pong ball. It was dark grey, with a green sproutling
      on it. It had a circumference of around three centimeters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had assumed that the glove was like the crystal shoe, in search of
      another glove to complete the pair. He hadn’t expected it to have been
      searching for a seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does it want to grow another glove?” Han Sen wondered. The glove had done
      him no harm, ultimately. And the glove had now given back control to Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanting to look around now, Han Sen pocketed the seed. He could not read
      the text that adorned the tools of that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what concerned him the most were the items inside the crystal
      containers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The containers looked similar to the one Stay Up Late was found inside,
      but the liquid was certainly different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late had been soaking in a colorless liquid. But in that place,
      the colors ranged from yellow, to green, to even blue. Some were plain and
      transparent, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had a look. Anything could have been inside them. Some included
      armor and helmets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, everything he saw seemed broken and twisted. It gave Han Sen the
      impression that they were not yet complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like these might be failed products,” Han Sen thought, right as
      his eyes grew wide and bright
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a container with transparent liquid, and inside it there was a
      humanoid creature that looked both male and female. It had white wings,
      and it looked like an angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like Little Angel, but this one seems genderless.” Han Sen
      observed the angel-looking creature, and then looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It has no penis. Maybe this thing is a failure, as well.” Han Sen saw the
      person was very smooth down below, and due to it not having any
      gender-specific parts, it could have very well have been a failure, he
      believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen looked down, he looked up. But right at that moment, the
      angel creature opened its eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes opened wide, but there were only pupils there. It wasn’t like an
      ordinary creature. The red pupils consumed the whole eye, but turned to
      gaze right at Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, and so he started walking backward slowly. The red
      eyes followed him wherever he moved. The head turned like a robot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t be this unlucky!” Han Sen felt glum. Crystallizers made weird
      stuff, and that thing inside the container didn’t look too friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cat appeared in the lab, and after he saw the angel inside the
      container, he shouted at Han Sen. “Run! It’s a Feather!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not react. The angel-looking creature burst through the
      container, and then the creepy and beautiful body came forward to grab
      him.
