<p>As he spoke to Huangfu Jing, Han Sen had a look at the route and
estimated the travel time it would take for him to get there.
“Don’t register it just yet. Wait for me on Planet Jade Drum. I’ll
be there in four days; can you wait that long?”</p>
<p>Since the entry pass for Planet Jade Drum was only valid for ten
days, visitors would be forced out if their allotted time expired.
That was why Han Sen had to confirm that he would make it in
time.</p>
<p>Yes, I am still eligible to be here for another six days,”
Huangfu Jing answered.</p>
<p>“Okay, then. Wait for me.” Han Sen sighed with relief.</p>
<p>Han Sen hung up the phone and readied himself to go to Planet
Jade Drum. With Huangfu Jing’s ability-level and intelligence, he
wouldn’t worry too much for her safety there. But bringing the Jade
Drum back safely would be difficult.</p>
<p>Planet Jade Drum was named after the Jade Drums, but Jade Drums
were rare. Many sonic Kings wished to locate a Jade Drum in order
to grow their powers.</p>
<p>It would be rather magnificent if they managed to get a King
class Jade Drum for themselves. But Huangfu Jing, who was only an
Earl, had managed to secure a Jade Drum for herself. It was going
to be hard to get it away from there without attracting unwanted
attention.</p>
<p>Han Sen had his Demon Bug shield, so he wasn’t afraid of any
King class enemies. All he feared was the prospect of more than one
King on the lookout for him. That could go badly.</p>
<p>Han Sen packed up his things and told Han Yan and the others not
to leave the base while he was away.</p>
<p>He took Bao’er with him as he left Narrow Moon, and they used a
wormhole to get to Planet Jade Drum.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just left Narrow Moon when Night River King
received word of his departure.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you know what? It’s fine if I can’t kill you. I can
still make you suffer a fate worse than death.” Night River King’s
face was all twisted, and his eyes shone with a malevolent
hatred.</p>
<p>A Duke came and bowed to Night River King. “My King, I have done
everything you asked me to.”</p>
<p>“Good. Very good.” Night River King waved his hand to excuse the
Duke. He then turned his attention to the screen that displayed
Planet Eclipse. With a twisted smile, he said, “Han Sen, I can’t
wait to see the look on your face when you come back and realize
all your friends are dead. I will be looking forward to that.”</p>
<p>The day after Han Sen’s departure, a fleet of ships entered
Narrow Moon. They were cargo ships that delivered produce. They
were outsiders to Narrow Moon, so they had to pay taxes to
enter.</p>
<p>There were many resources aboard, with many hailing from a
variety of different planets. There were many xenogeneics, which
made for their primary load of cargo.</p>
<p>When the ship went by Planet Eclipse, one of the ships broke
down. Many of the xenogeneics escaped from the ship and scattered
across Narrow Moon. The people of Narrow Moon attempted to capture
them again.</p>
<p>As this occurred, someone snuck into Planet Eclipse and placed
one of those xenogeneics atop a mountain there.</p>
<p>It was a xenogeneic that looked like a queen bee. Instead of the
expected yellow and black, however, its body was dark red. When
that xenogeneic regained its freedom, it killed a whole host of
xenogeneics all across that mountain. Then, it placed eggs inside
the bodies of the slain. The eggs were red, as well.</p>
<p>Those eggs incubated quickly, and as this happened, the corpses
dried and shriveled into husks. It was like the eggs were absorbing
all the nutrients that the bodies had to offer.</p>
<p>Not long after, the bees began to hatch and journey to a single
mountain amidst a vast range. Together, they hollowed it out. There
were many entrances all across the mountain’s slopes. It was like a
huge beehive, and many of those red bees came in and out.</p>
<p>As all this occurred, no one in the base took notice. Han Sen
had told everyone to stay inside the base when he left, so his
people did as they were instructed; no one went hunting and no one
left.</p>
<p>This situation made the murderous Night River King frown deeply.
He quickly said, “Han Sen is evil! After he left, he told all of
his friends to hide in the base. But hiding away won’t do them any
good. They’re all going to die. We just need to lure the Shadow
Queen Bee their way with an incense she likes. If we guide her
toward the base, she is sure to kill all of them. Han Sen! When you
come back and see all your friends and family have been implanted
by the eggs of the queen bee, I wonder what the look on your face
will be like!”</p>
<p>Han Sen followed the designated route and arrived at Planet Jade
Drum in time. Four days wasn’t a long time, but to Han Sen, the
delay was quite worrying. He was afraid Queen and the Jade Drum
might have been discovered by this point.</p>
<p>Luckily, all that he feared had not come to pass. He paid the
Thousand Treasures some cash, then entered Planet Jade Drum.</p>
<p>When flying over Planet Jade Drum, the planet was visibly
covered in grey mountains. No life was visible. There was no
countryside, and there were no xenogeneics.</p>
<p>But that was just the surface of the planet. Inside a large
mountain on Planet Jade Drum, there was a slew of mines. The Drum
xenogeneics lived there.</p>
<p>To look for them, people had to explore the mines and dig. The
level of creature they found, however, was determined by a
combination of luck and their own abilities.</p>
<p>Even King class elites might only be able to locate a low-level
Bronze Drum or Silver Drum. Jade Drums were incredibly rare. The
rate of finding them was often below one per year.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his phone to give Queen a call, but the call didn’t
go through. She had turned her communicator off, and that made Han
Sen frown.</p>
<p>Before entering Planet Jade Drum, he had been talking to Queen.
But now, the phones weren’t working. It suggested to him that
something must have happened.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen already knew her last location. So, he
summoned his red cloud and went right for her with Bao’er.</p>
<p>Inside a specific mountain on Planet Jade Drum, there was a
Taurus Marquise clutching a strange treasure weapon. He looked
murderous. He looked at Huangfu Jing and laughed. “I was just
coming here to search for a Jade Drum and see if I could steal it.
Thanks to you, I have found it right here. Give it to me, and I
will let you leave here alive.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing didn’t move, and she calmly looked at the Taurus
Marquise. She was confused, unsure how he knew she had managed to
find a Jade Drum.</p>
<p>When Huangfu Jing spoke to Han Sen, they used their human
language. It was very different from the common tongue of the geno
universe. Even if they were overheard, no one should have been able
to understand what they were saying.</p>
<p>The Taurus slowly neared her. He grinned proudly and said, “You
must think it is weird that I understand your language. But I think
it’s the most natural thing in the universe, because I study sound.
No sound can escape my ears. It is a power that allows me to
understand any language I hear, even if I have never heard it
before. Nothing you say can escape my ears.”</p>
