<h2>Using a Fist to Punch Eighteen Soldiers</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2304</h3>

<p>“The eighteen-weapon strikes get stronger the closer to the end
you are. The first hit is about the level of an ordinary Duke-level
striking with full strength. I suppose that an ordinary Duke could
break the lance with brute force. His fitness isn’t too bad, then.”
The woman in the control room thought that she was being pretty
generous when she defined Han Sen as “not bad.”</p>
<p>That level of fitness was common for the people of the Extreme
King. Even Bai Wei, who had just become a Duke, could probably do
the same thing with her Extreme King Punch. Han Sen’s attack wasn’t
a very unusual thing for the woman to see.</p>
<p>That woman liked smart and brave men. She didn’t like reckless
men, who fought with nothing more than muscle power.</p>
<p>The woman believed that power could be increased in a number of
different ways. If the intelligence and emotions of a person were
weak, however, it would be hard for them to ever become strong.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s punch broke a lance, and immediately after, another
weapon was flying toward him. The attacks didn’t even give him a
second to breathe.</p>
<p>His assailant was a knife this time, and when the knife came
soaring towards Han Sen, it took the image of a tiger that was
ready to devour the world. It roared as it came for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen threw a punch, breaking the knife’s tiger strike. That
strong collision of powers didn’t even leave a wound on Han Sen’s
mighty fist. It still glistened like white jade.</p>
<p>The eighteen weapons attacked Han Sen, one after another. Each
weapon had its own special power; the lance had been precise, while
the knife was strong. Next came a sword that could cause intense
pain. Every strike from each weapon was performed in a very skilled
and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Normally, the princes and princesses could choose to fight on
their own or let their guards fight on their behalf. Depending on
the element of the incoming weapon, they could select the best
fighter to deal with each individual threat.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t care about efficiency. It didn’t matter if it
was a sword or a lance or a stick coming for him; he demolished
each one with a swing of his fist. By this point, eight weapons had
been wrecked by his hands. And the whole time, Han Sen’s feet
remained firmly planted in the same place he had started.</p>
<p>“His fitness isn’t bad. If he plans to use his body’s power to
endure all eighteen hits, though, that will be a very naive thing
to attempt. Even if Lone Bamboo was here, he wouldn’t be able to
perform such a feat.” The woman looked shocked.</p>
<p>There were many who could break eight weapons, but Han Sen was
acting as if nothing remotely remarkable had occurred. Not just any
Duke could remain so calm under such circumstances. The eight
punches so far could easily earn Han Sen recognition as one of the
top Dukes.</p>
<p>It was frightening to think that a Duke who hadn’t awakened
their astral body could reach this level.</p>
<p>Bai Wei stood behind Han Sen, and she looked a little bit
confused. She understood that the eighteen weapons would become a
lot stronger towards the end. She wasn’t confident she could
complete the second set of nine attacks. She had wanted Han Sen to
do the last nine, while she did the first nine.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had started fighting immediately. She was worried
that Han Sen wouldn’t have enough strength to reach the end.</p>
<p>After all, Han Sen was just an original body Duke. He wasn’t
like an astral body Duke that could utilize the powers of a planet.
He wasn’t like a celestial body Duke, either, who could use the
power of the universe to heal themselves.</p>
<p>Han Sen evidently planned to absorb all eighteen hits. Bai Wei
didn’t think she could do something like that. If she had what it
took, she wouldn’t have asked Han Sen for help.</p>
<p>Clearly, Bai Wei’s worries were unfounded. The eighteen weapons
kept on attacking, but Han Sen was still as stable as a mountain.
One hit, one weapon. He broke each and every attack.</p>
<p>Regardless of the power or craftiness of the weapons’ attacks,
they could not escape Han Sen’s powerful punches.</p>
<p>A dozen weapons had been destroyed by Han Sen, and he was still
behaving as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Bai Wei
was staring at him in surprise, while the woman in the control room
looked very strange.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen punched the final weapon, and the woman in the control
room looked stunned.</p>
<p>“No wonder he is considered to be on the same level as Lone
Bamboo. He really does just depend on the power of the body. He is
quite the character. But people like that can easily find
themselves suppressed by higher level enemies. After all, he is
quite reckless.” The woman then thought of something. She laughed
and resumed talking to herself. “This is good! Someone with such
simple power will be easy to control. He won’t be able to cause
much trouble. He’ll be a decent Royal Guard after all. Bai Wei made
a fine choice.”</p>
<p>After that, the woman stood up and walked out of the control
room. Now that Bai Wei and Han Sen had entered The Grave of
Soldiers and Kings, the camera would not be able to record them.
There was no point in her hanging around.</p>
<p>When the space station’s captain saw the woman leaving, he wiped
the cold sweat from his brow. “That was too scary. It is fortunate
that Miss Mirror didn’t get angry.”</p>
<p>Being Bai King’s little sister, the woman was very famous. The
last king had made her marry a deified elite of the Extreme King,
but the man died in battle shortly after. She never sought to
remarry, ever since.</p>
<p>Among the Extreme King, Miss Mirror was only spoken of in hushed
tones. People didn’t fear her personal power; they feared her
because she was in charge of King Bai’s secret organization called
Spring Rain. She was King Bai’s most trusted confidante. Miss
Mirror named her organization Spring Rain, but no one was ever
really sure why.</p>
<p>Han Sen broke the eighteen weapons, and the grave beasts
returned to looking like dead objects again. He and Bai Wei could
now cross the plaza and enter the grave.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked at Han Sen strangely. He was just a Duke, and yet
he had managed to beat all eighteen weapon strikes by himself. Not
many people in the Extreme King could do something like that, but
Han Sen appeared to have done it rather easily. He was a far more
powerful person than she initially believed him to be.</p>
<p>“How are we going to take the weapons?” Han Sen asked, while
looking at the graves and gravestones.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t really care about the xenogeneic treasure, he
wasn’t going to miss out on any freebies.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked back, then glanced at the graves around them. She
said, “The graves with a crown symbol carved into them are the
graves belonging to one of the royal family. You cannot take the
weapons buried in those. The weapons of any other grave can be
taken, however. Just push the grave open and take the weapon
inside.”</p>
<p>“Is it really that easy?” Han Sen asked, unconvinced.</p>
<p>Bai Wei shook her head. “It’s not that simple, you’re right. We
don’t know who is buried in which grave. Because of that, we don’t
know which graves contain good weapons. Once you have pushed the
grave open, it doesn’t matter if the weapon inside is good or bad;
you still have to take it. No swapping, either. You only have one
chance. It is a shame I don’t have someone like Mister White. He
could definitely calculate which grave has a deified weapon. In
that case, I could base my choice on something more than dumb
luck.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Bai Wei resumed speaking. “Luckily, we have come
here mainly to gain access to the King’s Garden. I would be
thrilled to get a high-class treasure, but it is fine if that is
not what I receive.”</p>
<p>“Since we are here, I am going to get one no matter what.” Han
Sen laughed as he looked across the graves.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t a fan of luck. His Xuan Men wasn’t perfect, and
nowhere near Mister White’s level, so he used his Dongxuan Aura and
Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine the graves.</p>
